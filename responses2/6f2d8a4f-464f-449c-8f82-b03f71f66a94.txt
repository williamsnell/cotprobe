Okay, so I'm trying to solve this collision problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about two different collisions: Collision A and Collision B. I need to figure out which statement about the quantities in each collision is correct.

So, Collision A is two carts colliding and bouncing off each other. Collision B is a ball that sticks to a rigid rod, causing it to rotate about the combined center of mass.

The options are multiple choice, each option A through H, each giving a statement about both collisions. I need to pick the correct statement.

Let me think about each collision.

Starting with Collision A: Two carts collide and bounce off. In a perfectly elastic collision, the forces during the collision are equal and opposite, right? But the problem doesn't specify if it's elastic. It just says they bounce off each other. So during the collision, the forces are equal and opposite, and the time of collision is the same for both. Also, since it's a collision, I think momentum is conserved. So the change in momentum for each cart would be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but what about linear momentum? Since the collision is elastic, the kinetic energy is conserved. But the question is about the collision itself, not the outcome. So in terms of the collision itself, the forces would be the same magnitude and opposite, same time, and same change in velocity.

Wait, but the question is about quantities in each collision. So for Collision A, each cart experiences the same force, same time, and same change in velocity.

Hmm, maybe. Because in a collision, the forces are equal and opposite during the collision. So the time of collision is the same for both. The change in velocity would be the same magnitude but opposite direction. So the change (Δv) is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but the question says "change in velocity." So for each cart, the magnitude is the same, but the direction is opposite. So the change in velocity could be considered the same in terms of magnitude, but the actual vector is opposite.

So for the collision, each cart experiences the same force, same time, and same change in velocity (magnitude-wise). But wait, no, because the impulse (force multiplied by time) is equal to the change in momentum. So the impulse is the same for each. So the impulse (force times time) is same for each cart. So the force is same, time same, impulse same.

But the change in velocity would be same in magnitude but opposite direction. So the change in velocity (Δv) is same in magnitude, but different in direction. So if the question refers to the change in velocity as a vector, then the vectors are different. But if it's the magnitude, then same.

So for each cart, the change in velocity's magnitude is same, but direction is opposite. So in terms of the collision, the same force for same time, same change in velocity (magnitude-wise), but with opposite direction.

Wait, but the question is about what's correct about quantities. So for each collision, what is correct.

Now, Collision B: a ball sticks to a rod. The rod rotates about the center of mass.

What's happening here? It's a perfectly inelastic collision. So the collision is inelastic, no energy is lost, but kinetic energy is not conserved. The collision imparts angular momentum to the rod.

So during the collision, the torque is zero, right? Because torque is the rate of change of angular momentum. If there's no external torque, angular momentum is conserved. But in this case, during the collision, the system (ball and rod) is being struck, so external forces may be acting. Wait, no. If the collision is smooth, perhaps the point of contact is frictionless, so no external torque. But the system (ball and stick to rod) is moving after the collision, so the center of mass is moving. Wait, but in the collision, the point of contact is part of the system, so external forces (like friction) might act. So during collision, torque is applied.

Wait, but when a ball is stuck to a rod, the collision is inelastic. The collision is instantaneous, so the initial and final angular momentum are the same.

Let me think about torque. Torque is force times the lever arm. During the collision, if the collision occurs over a very short time, the torque might be considered negligible, or perhaps the problem assumes that the collision is instantaneous, so the time of collision is considered the same as the duration of the collision. But if the collision is instantaneous, the duration is zero, making torque zero. But in reality, the collision might have a very short duration, so during that time, external forces (like friction) might act, so torque is non-zero.

But the question says, "which of the following statements about quantities in each collision is correct." So for each collision, what is true about the quantities.

For Collision A: each cart experiences same force, same time, same change in velocity.

Wait, each cart experiences same impulse (force * time) during collision. Because the collision is between the two, the total impulse is equal to the change in momentum for each. So same impulse, same time, so same change in momentum (Δp). Since each cart's mass is different, their Δv would be different, but magnitude same.

So each cart's change in velocity has the same magnitude but opposite direction. So for the collision, the change in velocity's magnitude is same, but direction is opposite.

But the question is about the collision. So for each cart, during the collision, the change in velocity is same magnitude, but direction is opposite. So the change in velocity is same in magnitude, but opposite in direction. So the change in velocity (Δv) is same in magnitude, but Δv vector is opposite.

So for each cart, same force, same time, same change in velocity (magnitude-wise), but opposite direction. So the statement about Collision A would be correct if each cart experiences same force, same time, same change in velocity.

Wait, but the question in option A says: "Collision A: each cart experiences the same force, time of collision, and change in velocity." So if the change in velocity (Δv) is the same in magnitude, but opposite in direction, but the question refers to change in velocity as a vector, then it's different. But perhaps in the context of the question, it's considering the magnitude. So the change in velocity's magnitude is same for each cart.

So for Collision A, each cart experiences same force, same time, same magnitude of change in velocity. So option A's first part is correct.

Now for Collision B: the ball and rod each experience same torque, same time, same change in rotational kinetic energy.

Wait, the time of collision is same. Torque is the rate of change of angular momentum. So during the collision, if there's a torque acting on the system, then angular momentum changes. But if the collision is instantaneous, then the torque would be zero. Because during the collision, the duration is so short that the external forces (like friction) would have a negligible torque.

Wait, but since the collision is inelastic, the external torque is zero. So angular momentum is conserved during the collision. So torque is zero during the collision. So the change in angular momentum is zero. So each cart experiences no torque during the collision. So the torque for each is zero.

But the question says, "each experiences same torque." So that's correct if the torque is zero.

But wait, maybe during the collision, the force is applied over a time, so torque is applied. But if the collision is fast, the time is small, but the duration would be considered the same as the collision time. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, during the collision, the system (ball and rod) is subjected to external forces, like friction at the point of contact. So if the collision is between the ball and the rod, then when the ball sticks, the frictional force acts on both the ball and the rod during the collision. So during the collision, torque is present because the point of contact is experiencing a force, which causes a torque about the center of mass.

Wait, in this case, the rod is rotating about the center of mass. So perhaps the torque is provided by the ball's weight. The torque would be the weight (force) multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the point of impact.

So the torque τ is m * g * d, where d is the distance from the center of mass to the point where the ball hits the rod.

So during the collision, the torque is τ. The angular momentum before collision is m*v*r, where v is the velocity of the ball at impact. But wait, no, the system is the rod plus the ball. Before collision, the rod is stationary, so its angular momentum is zero. The ball has some linear momentum, but it's at a distance r from the center of mass. So the angular momentum of the ball is m*v*r, where v is the velocity of the ball at impact.

After the collision, the rod and ball are rotating about the center of mass. The total angular momentum is I * ω, where I is the moment of inertia of the rod about its center of mass (which is (1/12) m L²) plus m r² (since the ball is at a distance r from the center). So I = (1/12) m L² + m r².

So angular momentum before collision is m v r, and after is I ω. So during the collision, the torque would cause a change in angular momentum. But during the collision, the torque is applied for a time Δt. So the change in angular momentum is τ * Δt. So τ is m g r, I think, because d is r, the distance from the contact point to the center of mass.

Wait, but torque is the moment of force. So if the ball is hitting the rod, the force is mg (weight) acting at a point at distance r from the center of mass. So torque is τ = r * (mg) * sin(theta), but if the collision is head-on, theta is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) is 1.

So τ = r * m g.

So during the collision, the torque is τ = m g r.

So during the collision, the torque is τ = m g r, same for both the rod and the ball? Or is it only for the system as a whole? Because the center of mass is moving, so the system's angular momentum is considered.

Wait, but the question is about each of the objects in the system. The rod and the ball. So for the rod, the torque τ is provided by the ball's weight. So the torque on the rod is τ_r = r * m g. Similarly, the torque on the ball is τ_b = r * m g. So their torques are same.

But the question says, "each experiences the same torque." So that's correct because both the rod and the ball experience torque τ = m g r.

The collision time is the same (Δt). So torque times time is the change in angular momentum. So angular momentum changes by τ * Δt.

But the question says, "change in rotational kinetic energy." Let's see. The initial angular momentum is L_initial = m v r. After the collision, the system's angular momentum is I ω. So the change in angular momentum is I ω - m v r.

But the initial angular momentum is m v r, the final is I ω. The initial is before collision, the final after.

Wait, the question is about the change in rotational kinetic energy. So during the collision, what happens to the kinetic energy? Since the collision is inelastic, some energy is lost as heat or sound. So the kinetic energy of the system decreases. But which object's kinetic energy changes?

Wait, the rod is rotating, and the ball is moving. But initially, the rod is stationary, and the ball is moving with velocity v. After the collision, the rod is rotating, and the ball is moving with some velocity. Or wait, no. Because the ball sticks to the rod, so they move together after the collision.

So after the collision, the system (rod + ball) has some rotational speed ω. The kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω².

So during the collision, the kinetic energy of the system changes. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v r (since the rod is stationary). The final is (1/2) I ω².

But the question is about the change in rotational kinetic energy for each object. Hmm, but the rod is part of the system, and the ball is a part of the system. So perhaps the rotational kinetic energy change is for the system as a whole. However, the question says, "change in rotational kinetic energy" for each object. So this is ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy of each object. Like, the ball and the rod each experience a change in their own kinetic energy. Or perhaps each experiences a change in the system's kinetic energy.

But the question says, "the ball and the rod each experience the same torque, time of collision, and change in rotational kinetic energy." So, torque is same (correct), time of collision same (correct), and change in rotational kinetic energy same.

But what is the change in rotational kinetic energy of each.

Wait, perhaps each object (ball and rod) has their own kinetic energy change during the collision.

But the rod is rotating, so its kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω². The ball is moving, so its kinetic energy is (1/2) m v'², where v' is its velocity after collision.

But the collision is inelastic, so the kinetic energy is lost. So the change in the rod's kinetic energy is (1/2 I ω²) - (1/2 m r² v'), since the rod's initial kinetic energy was (1/2) m r² v² (if v is the initial velocity of the ball). Wait, no, before collision, the rod is stationary, so its velocity is zero. The ball has initial velocity v. So initial kinetic energy of the system is (1/2) m v².

After collision, the rod and ball rotate with angular velocity ω. So the kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω² + (1/2) m v'².

So the change in kinetic energy is (1/2 I ω² + 1/2 m v'²) - (1/2 m v²) = 1/2 (I ω² + m v'² - m v²).

But during the collision, the rod's initial kinetic energy is zero. So I think the rod's initial KE is (1/2) I ω_initial². But what is ω_initial? It's zero because before collision, the rod is not moving. So the initial KE of the rod is zero. The initial KE of the ball is (1/2) m v². So change in KE of the system is (1/2 I ω² + 0) - (1/2 m v²).

But the question says, "the change in rotational kinetic energy" for each object. So for the rod, its change is (1/2 I ω²) - 0 = 1/2 I ω². For the ball, the change is (1/2 m v'²) - (1/2 m v²). So unless v' equals v, this is not same as the rod's change.

But in an inelastic collision, the rod and the ball will have the same speed at the point of contact. So the velocity of the rod's center is v' plus the tangential velocity due to rotation. Wait, no. Actually, the rod is rotating about its center of mass, so the velocity of any point on the rod is ω × r (where r is the distance from the center of mass). But the point where the ball sticks is at a distance r from the center. So the velocity of that point before collision is v, but after collision, it's ω r. So ω r = v, because the collision is perfectly inelastic. Wait, but in an inelastic collision, the relative velocity at impact is zero. So the velocity of the point of impact (before collision) is v_ball = ω r (if the rod had some initial velocity, but in this case, the rod is initially stationary, so the point of impact is moving with v relative to the rod. So, the velocity of the point where the ball hits is v - ω r = 0. So v = ω r.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me think. The rod is initially at rest. The point of impact is at velocity v (from the ball's perspective). After collision, the rod starts rotating. The point where the ball hits has velocity v, but that's in the lab frame. So the velocity of the rod at that point is ω r, where r is the distance from the center. So to have the point's velocity be zero (so that the relative velocity is zero), we must have ω r = v. Because v is the initial velocity of the ball relative to the rod.

Wait, no. The relative velocity between the ball and the rod at the point of impact must be zero. Because in an inelastic collision, there's no external force (except maybe during the collision, but that's complicated). So the point of impact has the same velocity as the rod before collision. So the velocity of the rod's point of impact is v, but the rod is initially stationary. So the rod must have velocity v in the lab frame. So, v = ω r (since the point of impact is at r from the center, so the rod's velocity is ω r). So ω = v / r.

So ω is v divided by the distance from the center of mass to the point of collision.

So in this case, for the collision between the ball and the rod, the rod's initial velocity is v, but the point of impact is at r from the center. So the rod's velocity at impact is v, and so the point where the ball hits, the velocity is v. So the rod's velocity at the point of impact is v.

So after collision, the rod is rotating with angular velocity ω = v/r.

So the velocity of the rod's center is zero (since it's rotating), but the ball is moving with velocity v. Wait, no, after collision, the rod and the ball move together. So their speed is the same. So the rod's center will have velocity v after collision? No, wait. Before collision, the rod is stationary, and the ball is moving with velocity v. The collision is inelastic, so the ball sticks to the rod. So the system (rod + ball) is moving together with some velocity. So during collision, the point of contact is at velocity v. After collision, the rod and ball move with velocity v.

Wait, but that's not possible if the rod was initially stationary. Let me think again. The rod is initially at rest. The ball is moving with velocity v towards the rod. So the point where they collide is at a distance r from the center of the rod. So the velocity of the point at collision is v (from the ball's perspective). But the rod was initially at rest, so during the collision, the point of contact has velocity v, and the rod has to move so that the relative velocity is zero. So the rod must have a velocity of v at the point of contact. So the velocity of the rod's center is higher because the rod is rotating.

Wait, no. The rod is a rigid body. So if the point of contact has velocity v, then the entire rod must have a velocity of v at that point. Because the rod is rigid, the velocity at the point of contact is the same as the velocity of the rod's center of mass plus the angular velocity times the distance. So v = ω r. So ω = v/r.

So the velocity of the rod's center of mass is v / r * r? No, wait, no, the velocity of the rod's center of mass is zero, because it's stationary. So the rod has to rotate such that the point of contact has velocity v. So the angular velocity ω is v divided by the distance from the center of mass to the point of contact.

So the velocity of the rod's center of mass is v / r * r? No, wait, the rod's center of mass is at a distance r from the point of contact. So during the collision, the point of contact has velocity v, and the rod must rotate such that the point of contact has velocity v. So the angular velocity is ω = v / r.

So the velocity of the rod's center of mass is (v / r) * r = v. Which makes sense because the rod is rotating, so the center of mass is moving. Wait, no, the center of mass is moving with velocity v. So the velocity of the rod's center of mass after collision is v. So that's correct.

So after the collision, the rod and the ball are rotating together with angular velocity ω = v / r. So the velocity of the rod's center of mass is v, and the velocity of the ball is v as well, because they're moving together.

Wait, no. The rod is rotating, so the velocity of the center of mass is v. The point of contact is at velocity v. So the velocity of the rod's center of mass is v, and the velocity of the ball is v as well. So the rod and the ball move together.

So the kinetic energy of the rod after collision is (1/2) I ω². The kinetic energy of the ball is (1/2) m v². But the total kinetic energy of the system is (1/2) I ω² + (1/2) m v². But since v = ω r, so v = (v/r) * r → v = v. So substituting, v = ω r, so ω = v/r.

So substituting into I ω²:

I = (1/12) m L², where L is the length of the rod. So I = (1/12) m L².

So I ω² = (1/12) m L² * (v/r)².

And the kinetic energy of the ball is (1/2) m v².

So the total KE is (1/12) m L² * v² / r² + (1/2) m v².

Factor out m v²:

m v² ( (1/12) L² / r² + 1/2 )

So the change in the system's kinetic energy is from (1/2) m v² (before collision) to (1/12 m L² v² / r² + 1/2 m v²) after collision.

Wait, no. Before collision, the rod's speed is zero, and the ball has speed v. So the system's initial KE is (1/2) m v².

After collision, the rod's KE is (1/2) I ω², and the ball's KE is (1/2) m v². So the system's final KE is (1/2 I ω²) + (1/2 m v²).

The change in KE is final - initial = (1/2 I ω² + 1/2 m v²) - (1/2 m v²) = 1/2 I ω².

Which is the same as the change in rotational KE of the rod. So for the rod, its change in KE is 1/2 I ω² = (1/2) * (1/12 m L²) * (v² / r²) = (1/24) m L² v² / r².

But the question is, does each object (ball and rod) experience the same change in their own KE? So the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the ball's change is (1/2 m v² - 1/2 m v²) = 0. So that can't be.

Wait, but the system's KE change is (1/24) m L² v² / r². So the question is, "the change in rotational kinetic energy for each object." So the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², the ball's change is zero. So they're not the same.

Wait, but perhaps the question is referring to the rod's change in KE, and the ball's KE change. So the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the ball's change is (1/2) m v² - (1/2 m v²) = 0. So not the same.

So this suggests that the answer for Collision B is incorrect. None of the options seem to fit.

But looking back, the options are:

A. both correct

B. Collision A correct, B incorrect? No.

C. None of the above.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, for Collision B, the question is about the change in rotational kinetic energy for each object. So the rod and the ball. But the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the ball's is zero. So they are not the same.

Therefore, the statement in option B is incorrect. So the correct answer would be option C, which says that each object (rod and ball) experiences the same torque, time, and change in rotational KE.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me go back.

For Collision A: two objects collide, and the change in linear momentum is equal for both (each object's change is the same). The change in KE is zero. The change in linear momentum is the same for both, but since they're the same, the momentum change is the same for each. So for each object, change in linear momentum is same, change in KE is zero. So in Collision A, statements are correct.

For Collision B: inelastic collision. The rod and ball stick together. The change in linear momentum is the same for both (since they're the same object; wait, no, the rod and ball are different objects. So their change in momentum is different. So the change in linear momentum is different. So the statement in option B is incorrect.

The change in rotational KE: for each object, the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², the ball's is zero. So they are not the same.

Torque: the torque is same for both the rod and the ball during the collision. So statement is correct.

Time of collision: same for both. So correct.

Change in rotational KE: rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², which is not same as the ball's (zero). So incorrect.

So option B is incorrect. So the correct answer is option C, which says each object (rod and ball) experiences the same torque, time, and change in rotational KE.

Wait, but according to that, the change in rotational KE for the rod is (1/24) m L² v² / r², which is not same as the ball's (zero). So the statement is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the rod and ball are rotating, so they have the same change in KE. But the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the ball's change is (1/2 m v² - 1/2 m v²) = 0. So they are not same.

Alternatively, perhaps the rod and ball have the same change in KE? No, because one is moving and the other isn't. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for the rod, the change in KE is (1/2 I ω²) = (1/2) (1/12 m L²) (v² / r²) ) = (1/24) m L² v² / r². For the ball, the change in KE is (1/2) m v² (because the rod is no longer moving, and the ball is moving with speed v). So the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the ball's is (1/2) m v². So unless L r = 2 v, which is not the case, these are not the same.

Wait, but is there a way for the rod's change in KE to be the same as the ball's? Let's set them equal.

(1/24) m L² v² / r² = (1/2) m v².

Simplify: (1/24) L² / r² = (1/2).

Multiply both sides by 24: L² / r² = 12.

So L = 2 r sqrt(3). So that's possible. But in general, this isn't the case. So we can't say that the rod and the ball have the same change in KE.

So the statement in option B is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option C: each object experiences the same torque, the same time, and the same change in rotational kinetic energy.

Wait, but option C says the same. Let me check.

Option C: Collision A: each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE. Correct.

Collision B: each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE. Incorrect.

So option C is correct for Collision A, but incorrect for Collision B.

So the overall correct answer would be collision B with incorrect statements, but looking for the option that says each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in KE. But that's not correct, because the rod's change in KE is (1/24) m L² v² / r², the ball's is zero. So the person who answered the question would select option C as correct, but that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the change in KE is the same for both? No, the rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the ball's is (1/2) m v². These are only the same if L r = 2 v, which isn't a general case.

So the correct answer is option C, but only for Collision A. But the question is asking about both Collision A and Collision B. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no. Option C says each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE. But for Collision A, the change in rotational KE of the rod is same as the change in the system's KE. Wait, for Collision A, the system's KE is zero, so the rod's change in KE is zero. So for the rod, the change in KE is zero, and the system's change is zero. So the collision's statements are correct.

But for the collision in Collision B, the rod's change in KE is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the system's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r². So the rod's change in KE is (1/24) m L² v² / r², while the system's change is same as rod's. So each object's change in KE is different.

So option C is not correct because for Collision B, the rod and the ball have different changes in KE. So option C is incorrect.

Wait, but option C says each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE. So each object's torque, time, and change in KE is same. Which is not correct.

So option C is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option C is incorrect, so correct option is option B.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Let me restate:

Which of the options is correct?

Option A: Both correct.

Option B: Collision A correct, B incorrect.

Option C: Both correct?

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Collision A: each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE.

Yes: torque is same (both same), time is same (Δt same), change in rotational KE same (rod and system same).

So option A is correct.

Collision B: each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE.

No: torque same (yes), time same (Δt same, yes), but the change in rotational KE for rod is (1/24) m L² v² / r², while the change in KE for the ball is (1/2) m v². So they are not same. So option B is incorrect.

So the overall correct option is option A for Collision A and option B is incorrect.

So the overall correct answer is option B is incorrect, so option C would be wrong.

Wait, I'm getting nowhere. Let's just read all the options.

Option A: Both collision A and B correct.

Option B: Collision A correct, B incorrect.

Option C: Each object (rod and ball) experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE.

So for the collision A, the statements are correct.

For collision B, the statements are incorrect.

So the correct answer would be either option A is correct, but the question is asking which option is correct, which includes option B.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about which option is correct. So option B is incorrect, but option A is correct. So the correct overall answer is option A.

Wait, no, but the question is about both collision A and B. So the correct answer is option A, which states that Collision A's statements are correct, and Collision B's statements are incorrect.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, I'm getting too confused. Let me think about the options.

Option A: Both correct. So collision A and collision B each have correct statements.

But Collision B's statements are incorrect. So the option A is incorrect.

Option B: Collision A correct, B incorrect. So the option B is correct.

Option C: Each object (rod and ball) experiences same torque, same time, same change in KE.

So each object's torque is same (yes), time is same (Δt same, yes), change in KE is same (no, because rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r² and the ball's is (1/2) m v², which are not same). So option C is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but no. Let me think again.

Collision A: each object experiences same torque (yes), same time (Δt same, yes), same change in rotational KE (yes), so option A is correct.

Collision B: each object experiences same torque (yes), same time (Δt same, yes), same change in rotational KE (no, because rod's change is (1/24) m L² v² / r², and the ball's is (1/2) m v², which are not same), so option B is incorrect.

So the overall correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I thought option C was correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: each object experiences same torque, same time, same change in rotational KE. But that's not correct, because for collision B, the change in KE is different between the rod and the ball.

So the correct answer is option B: Collision A correct, B incorrect.

So the answer is option B.
</think>

The collision between the rod and the ball (Collision B) involves an inelastic collision where the rod and the ball stick together. The rod and the ball will experience the same torque, the same time (Δt), and a different change in rotational kinetic energy (ΔKE) because the rod's change in KE is (1/24) m L² v² / r², while the ball's change in KE is (1/2) m v². Therefore, the statements about Collision B are incorrect.

For Collision A, the two objects collide in an elastic collision. The rod and the ball experience the same torque, the same time (Δt), and the same change in rotational kinetic energy (ΔKE). Thus, the statements about Collision A are correct.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **Option A**: Both collision A and B are correct.  
  This is incorrect because the statements about Collision B are incorrect.

- **Option B**: Collision A is correct, and B is incorrect.  
  This is correct because Collision A's statements are correct, and Collision B's statements are incorrect.

- **Option C**: Each object experiences the same torque, the same time, and the same change in rotational kinetic energy.  
  This is incorrect because the change in rotational kinetic energy for the rod and the ball is different.

- **Option D**: None of the above.  
  This is incorrect because Option B is correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, which states that Collision A is correct, and Collision B is incorrect.
