Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options is a remote Trojan. I remember that trojans are a type of malware, specifically malicious software that spreads sideways through a network. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, especially about remote ones.

Let me think. The options are A: Troya, B: DaCryptic, C: BankerA, D: Game-Troj. Hmm. I know that a remote trojan is one that doesn't rely on a specific client or device to install itself. So it's a standalone piece of malware that can infect any client.

Looking at the names, I'm not sure if any of them are classic remote trojans. I recall that some classic remote trojans include things like Sy unit or the one from the X-15. Wait, but those aren't among the options here. So perhaps the question is more about identifying which of the options is a remote one.

Option D is "Game-Troj." I'm not sure, but I think "Game" is a general term for game trojans. Game trojans are a subset of remote trojans that target specific clients like Windows or Mac. So if "Game-Troj" is a type of Game trojan, it wouldn't be a remote one. It would be a specific variant.

Option B is "Dacryptic." Dacryptic rings a bell as one of the early remote trojans. I think it was a病毒 designed to install itself on Windows systems. So that's definitely a remote one.

Option C is "BankerA." I'm not as familiar with this one, but I don't think it's a remote trojan. It might be a custom-built or a different type of malware.

Option A is "Troya." I'm not sure what "Troya" stands for. It could be a different type of malware, perhaps a different variant of a remote one, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I remember that "Troya" is actually a client-based trojan. It's called the "Trunk" trojan, which is a remote one that infects clients. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Putting it together, the classic remote trojans are like the Sy unit, X-15, and the Game trojans. So among the options, D is a Game trojan, which is a remote one. So the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: Game-Troj. Game trojans are a subset of remote trojans that target specific client operating systems like Windows or Mac. Therefore, Game-Troj is a remote trojan.

Answer: D
