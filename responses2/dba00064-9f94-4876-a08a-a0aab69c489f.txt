Okay, I've got this question about real interest rates and how they change when the nominal interest rate and inflation change. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the nominal interest rate has risen from 8% to 10% over three years. Meanwhile, the inflation rate has increased from 3% to 5%. I need to figure out what happened to the real interest rate.

Hmm, right. The real interest rate is the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. So, it's a measure of the return on investment after adjusting for inflation. So, the formula is Real Interest Rate = Nominal Rate - Inflation Rate.

Wait, but wait—no, actually, is it that simple? Or does it consider the time value of money and compounding? Because sometimes real interest rates can be calculated using more precise formulas, like the Fisher equation which accounts for compounding periods and so on.

Let me think. The basic approach is that the real interest rate (r) is the nominal rate (i) minus the inflation rate (π). So here, the nominal rate went from 8% to 10%, and inflation went from 3% to 5%. So the real rate would have changed by (10% - 5%) = 5% and (8% -3%)=5%. Wait, but that seems same as the change in inflation, but that's not the case because the actual real interest rate is computed differently.

Wait no, wait a second. That approach would say real rate goes from 5% to 5%, but that's ignoring the fact that the nominal rate and inflation might not change by the same amount each year. Oh wait, no, in this question, both the nominal rate and inflation are increasing by the same amount each year. So the change in the real rate would be (10-5)=5% and (8-3)=5%, but that's a 0% change? That can't be right because the real rate depends on the actual rate of change in the nominal rate and inflation.

Wait another thought. Maybe I should calculate the real rate in each scenario.

Let's take the first year: nominal rate is 8%, inflation is 3%. So real rate is 8% - 3% = 5%.

Second year: nominal 10%, inflation 5%. So real rate is 10% -5% =5%. Wait, so both years, the real rate remains at 5%? That can't be right because if the real rate is the same, then the purchasing power is the same each year. But in reality, the real interest rate does change because the nominal rate and inflation rates are changing each year.

Wait, no. The question states the interest rate has risen from 8% to 10% over three years. So maybe the nominal rate is compounded annually, and the inflation is also increasing each year. Let me think about the actual calculation.

The real interest rate can be calculated using the Fisher equation, which is: i = r + π + (rπ)/100, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula (1 + i) = (1 + r) * (1 + π). Then, the real interest rate is r = [(1+i)/(1+π)] - 1.

Wait, no, that's the formula for the real rate of return when considering the nominal rate and inflation. So, the real interest rate is the nominal rate divided by (1 plus inflation rate), minus 1.

Wait, let me get this right. The real interest rate (r) is given by:

(1 + i) = (1 + r) * (1 + π)

Where i is the nominal rate, r is real, and π is inflation.

So to find r, we rearrange:

r = (1 + i)/(1 + π) - 1

So for the first year:

i =8%, π=3%.

r = (1.08)/(1.03) -1 = approx 1.08/1.03 =1.048543... → 0.048543 or about 4.85%.

Wait, but that's the real rate for the first year. Then, in the next year, the nominal rate is 10%, inflation is 5%:

r = (1.10)/(1.05) -1 = approx 1.047619 -1 = ~0.0476 or 4.76%.

Wait, so the real rate went from approximately 4.85% to 4.76% in two years. So it's actually decreasing. Because the nominal rate went up by 2% (from 8 to 10) and inflation also went up by 2% (from 3 to 5), but the way the real rate is calculated, the change isn't the same.

Wait, but wait: 8% increase and 3% inflation: 8-3=5. So, the initial real rate would be 5%. Then, 10% and 5%: 10-5=5. So, 5% real rate. Wait, but that would mean the real rate is the same. But according to the calculation, it's actually going down a bit each year.

So that's confusing. Let me recalculate.

First year:

i =8%, π=3%.

r = (1.08)/(1.03) -1 = 1.08 /1.03 is 1.048543... subtract 1 gives 0.048543, which is ~4.85%.

Second year:

i=10%, π=5%.

r = (1.10)/(1.05) -1 = 1.10 divided by 1.05 is approximately 1.047619, minus 1 is 0.0476 or ~4.76%.

So the real rate decreased from 4.85% to 4.76%, which is a small decrease. So the real interest rate has decreased.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: Real decreases by 2% → No, because the change was small.

B: Real more than doubles → No, because it went from 4.85% to 4.76, which isn't a big change.

C: Real decreases → This seems correct because real rate went down.

D: Real increases → No.

E: Real is halved → No, real rate decreased by about 0.09%, not exactly halved.

F: Inflation constant → No, inflation increased.

G: Inflation overtakes interest rate → No, inflation increased more.

H: Real rate remains constant → No, because it's going down.

I: Nominal rate constant → No, it's increasing.

J: Real interest rate increases by 2% → No, it's decreasing.

So the correct answer should be C: Real interest rate decreases.

The real interest rate is calculated as the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate, using the formula:

\[
r = \frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} - 1
\]

where \(i\) is the nominal interest rate and \(\pi\) is the inflation rate.

### Year 1:
- Nominal rate (\(i\)) = 8%, Inflation (\(\pi\)) = 3%
- Real rate (\(r\)) = \(\frac{1.08}{1.03} - 1 \approx 4.85\%\)

### Year 2:
- Nominal rate (\(i\)) = 10%, Inflation (\(\pi\)) = 5%
- Real rate (\(r\)) = \(\frac{1.10}{1.05} - 1 \approx 4.76\%\)

The real interest rate decreased from approximately 4.85% to 4.76%. This is because the nominal rate increased by 2% (from 8% to 10%), but inflation also increased by 2% (from 3% to 5%), leading to a slightly smaller real rate.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Real interest rate decreases by 2%** → Incorrect, as the change in real rate was smaller.
- **B: Real interest rate more than doubles** → Incorrect, as the real rate only decreased slightly.
- **C: Real interest rate decreases** → Correct, as the real rate decreased.
- **D: Real interest rate increases** → Incorrect, as the real rate decreased.
- **E: Real interest rate is halved** → Incorrect, as the real rate decreased by less than 50%.
- **F: Inflation rate constant** → Incorrect, as inflation increased.
- **G: Inflation rate overtakes the interest rate** → Incorrect, as inflation increased more.
- **H: Real interest rate remains constant** → Incorrect, as the real rate changed.
- **I: The nominal interest rate is constant** → Incorrect, as the nominal rate increased.
- **J: Real interest rate increases by 2%** → Incorrect, as the real rate decreased.
