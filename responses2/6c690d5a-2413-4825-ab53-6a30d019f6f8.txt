Okay, so I've got this invoice problem to solve. Let me read it again. The invoice is dated March 2 for $416.50. It's less 15% and 2.5%. The terms are 2% for 10 days, and then net 30 days. Wait, no, the term is 2% and 10-EOM, which I think means 2% for 10 days and then net 30 days. So I need to calculate the amount after the discounts and then figure out the payment date.

So, the payment was made on April 10. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the original amount is $416.50. Then, there are two percentages to apply: 15% and 2.5%. I think these are successive discounts. So first, I'll apply the 15%, then the 2.5% on the reduced amount.

Let me calculate the first discount. 15% of 416.50. 

15% is 0.15, so 416.50 * 0.15 = 62.475. So subtracting that from the original: 416.50 - 62.475 = 354.025. Hmm, but wait, sometimes discounts are applied sequentially, so maybe it's 416.50 * (1 - 0.15) = 416.50 * 0.85. Let me compute that: 0.85 * 416.50. Let me do the multiplication. 416.50 * 0.85. 

Well, 400 * 0.85 = 340, 16.50 * 0.85 = 14.025. So total is 340 + 14.025 = 354.025. So yes, $354.025 after first discount.

Now, apply the second discount of 2.5%. So 2.5% of 354.025. Let me calculate that: 354.025 * 0.025. Hmm. 354 * 0.025 is 8.85, plus 0.025 * 0.025 (which is negligible). So 8.85 approximately. So subtracting that from 354.025 gives 354.025 - 8.85 = 345.175. So the amount after both discounts is $345.18 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, the terms are 2% for 10 days, net 30 days. So the payment is due within 10 days, otherwise, the net 30 period applies. The invoice was dated March 2nd. So let's see when April 10th falls in terms of the payment period.

March has 31 days. So March 2 to March 31 is 29 days (since starting on day 2, March 3 is day 1). Wait, no, March 2 is the first day. So from March 2 to March 10 is 9 days. Wait, no, March 2 is the date, so March 2 is day 0. Then March 10 is 8 days after. Because March 2 is the first day. Wait, March 2 is day 1, March 3 is day 2, up to March 10 being day 9. Wait, maybe I should calculate the number of days between March 2 and April 10.

March has 31 days. So March 2 to March 31 is 31 - 2 + 1 = 30 days. Because from March 2 to March 31 is 30 days (including March 2 and March 31). So March 2 is day 0, March 31 is day 30. Then April 10 is 10 days in April. So total days from March 2 to April 10 is 30 + 10 = 40 days.

The terms are 2% for 10 days, then net 30 days. So if the payment is made within 10 days, the 2% discount is applied. Otherwise, net 30 days applies. Since April 10 is 40 days after March 2, which is longer than 10 days, the 2% discount is not applicable. So the net 30 days period applies.

Wait, no. The terms are 2% for 10 days (so 10 days after the invoice date). Then the net 30: which means 30 days from the invoice date. Wait, perhaps the terms are 2% for 10 days, and then net 30 days from the invoice date. So if you pay within 10 days, you get the 2% discount. If not, you have to pay the net amount due 30 days after.

So, March 2 is the invoice date. The payment was made on April 10. Let me calculate the number of days between March 2 and April 10.

March has 31 days. So March 2 to March 31 is 30 days (since March 2 is day 0, March 31 is day 30). Then April 10 is 10 days into April. So total is 30 + 10 = 40 days.

Now, the 2% discount is for 10 days. So if the payment is made within 10 days of March 2 (i.e., by April 1), then the 2% discount applies. April 10 is 40 days after March 2, which is more than 10 days. So the 2% discount is not applicable. The net 30 days period applies, meaning that after 30 days from March 2, the full amount is due. So April 10 is 40 days after, which is beyond the net 30, so the 2% discount isn't applied.

Therefore, the amount to be paid is the amount after both discounts, which is $345.18. Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because the options don't have $345.17, but option C is $345.17. So that would be the amount.

Wait, the options: looking back, option C is $345.17, which matches our calculation.

The invoice amount is $416.50, with successive discounts of 15% and 2.5%. First, apply the 15% discount: $416.50 × 0.85 = $354.025. Then, apply the 2.5% discount: $354.025 × 0.975 = $345.175. Rounded to two decimal places, the amount after discounts is $345.18.

The payment was made on April 10, which is 40 days after the invoice date (March 2). The terms are 2% for 10 days, net 30 days. Since the payment is due after 10 days, the 2% discount is not applicable. Therefore, the amount to be paid is $345.18.

Among the options provided, the correct amount is $345.17, which corresponds to option C.
