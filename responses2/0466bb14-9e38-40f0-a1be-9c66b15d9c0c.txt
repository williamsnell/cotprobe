Okay, so I've got this question about gas effusion. Hmm, I remember that Graham's law has something to do with the rate at which gases effuse through a pinhole. Let me try to recall the details.

Graham's law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. Oh right, the formula is r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where r is the effusion rate and M is the molar mass. So, if one gas effuses faster, its molar mass is smaller because the rate is higher.

The question says helium effuses 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas. So, let's assign variables. Let me call the unknown gas 'X'. So, r_X is the rate of effusion for X, and r_He is for helium.

So, r_X = (1/5.33) * r_He. Because helium is faster, so its rate is higher. Wait, no wait, wait. Wait, wait. If helium is 5.33 times faster than X, that would mean r_He = 5.33 * r_X. Oh, wait no, no. Let me think. If X is slower, then X's rate is less than He's. So, r_He = 5.33 * r_X.

Wait, no, the question says helium effuses 5.33 times faster than X. So, r_He / r_X = 5.33. So, r_X = r_He /5.33.

In Graham's law, the ratio of their rates is sqrt(M_X / M_He). Because the rate is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. So, (r_X / r_He) ) = sqrt(M_He / M_X).

Wait, let me make sure. Let me restate the formula. The rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So, r_X / r_He = sqrt(M_He / M_X).

Wait, because if M_X is smaller (so X is lighter), the rate should be faster. So if X is lighter, it effuses faster than He. So, in this case, X is the unknown, and it's slower than He. So, r_X is less than r_He.

So, r_X / r_He = sqrt(M_He / M_X) )? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The formula is r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where r1 is the rate of gas 1 and r2 is rate of gas 2. So, for He and X, if X is slower, then r_X / r_He = sqrt(M_He / M_X) )?

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up the equation correctly. Let me denote:

r_X is the effusion rate of gas X, which is slower than He. So, r_X < r_He.

From Graham's law, (r_X / r_He) = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

Because the formula is r1/r2 = sqrt(M2 / M1), so if r_X is the first, then r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1).

Wait, no, the formula is r1 is for gas 1, r2 for gas 2. So, r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So, gas 1 is r1, and gas 2 is r2.

In the problem, gas X is the one whose rate we're comparing to He. So, let's say gas X is the first, so r_X is r1, and He is gas 2, r_He is r2.

So, r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So, solving for M_X: M_X = M_He * ( (r_X / r_He) )^2.

Wait, but in the problem, r_X / r_He is what? Because the question says helium is 5.33 times faster. So, r_X = (1/5.33) * r_He. Because if X is slower, it takes longer to effuse, so its rate is lower.

Wait, no: if X's rate is slower than He, then r_X = r_He / 5.33.

So, plugging into the equation:

r_X / r_He = (1/5.33) = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So, square both sides:

(1/5.33)^2 = M_He / M_X

=> M_X = M_He * (5.33)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express the equation:

( r_X / r_He ) = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

=> (1/5.33) = sqrt( (4.0026) / M_X )

Wait, wait, the molar mass of He, Helium, is about 4.0026 g/mol. So, M_He = 4.0026.

So, rearranging the equation:

(1/5.33) = sqrt( 4.0026 / M_X )

Square both sides:

(1/(5.33)^2) = 4.0026 / M_X

So, M_X = 4.0026 * (5.33)^2.

Compute 5.33 squared: 5.33 *5.33. Let me compute that.

5 *5=25. 5 *0.33=1.65. 0.33*5=1.65. 0.33^2=0.1089.

So, (5 +0.33)^2 = 25 + 2*(5 *0.33) + 0.33^2 = 25 + 3.3 + 0.1089 = 28.4089.

Wait, actually, 5.33 is 5.33. 5.33 *5.33:

Let me compute 5 *5=25. 5 *0.33=1.65. 0.33*5=1.65. 0.33 *0.33=0.1089.

So, (5 +0.33)^2 = 25 + 2*(5*0.33) + 0.33^2.

Calculating each term:

5 *0.33 *2 = 3.3.

0.33^2 =0.1089.

So, summing up:

25 +3.3=28.3; 28.3 +0.1089=28.4089.

So, 5.33^2=28.4089.

So, M_X = 4.0026 * 28.4089.

Let me compute 4 *28.4089 = 113.6356, and 0.0026 *28.4089 ≈ 0.07386.

So, M_X ≈ 113.6356 +0.07386 ≈ 113.7095 g/mol.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. Hmm. That can't be right because the options are all gases with molar masses around 16, 28, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, what's the molar mass of helium? That's about 4 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the numerator and denominator in the ratio. Because the formula is (r1/r2) = sqrt(M2/M1), so if I have r_X is slower, then r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

Wait, yes, because if X is lighter, it's effusing faster.

Wait, but according to the problem, helium is faster. So, X is the unknown gas.

So, the rate of X is slower than He. So, r_X = (1/5.33) * r_He.

So, (r_X)/(r_He) = 1/5.33 = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So, (1/5.33)^2 = M_He / M_X.

So, M_X = M_He * (5.33)^2.

Which is 4.0026 * 28.4089 ≈ let me compute this.

4.0026 *28.4089.

Let me compute 4 *28.4089 = 113.6356.

0.0026 *28.4089 ≈ 0.07386.

Adding them, 113.6356 + 0.07386 ≈ 113.7095 g/mol.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. The options are all gases with molar masses around 16-58 g/mol, but 113 is way too high. So, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (r1/r2) = sqrt( M2/M1 ), where r1 is the rate of gas 1, and r2 is rate of gas 2.

So, in this case, if X is gas 1, and helium is gas 2, then r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So, (r_X)/(r_He) ) = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X )

Which I think is correct.

But if I do (1/5.33) = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X )

Square both sides: (1/(5.33)^2) = 4.0026 / M_X

M_X = 4.0026 * (5.33)^2 = 4.0026 * 28.4089 ≈ 113.7 g/mol.

Wait, but that's way beyond any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Let me think.

If X is the unknown, and it's slower (so it's slower than He), then r_X < r_He.

So, the ratio r_X / r_He is less than 1.

But according to the formula, (r_X / r_He) = sqrt(M_He / M_X).

Wait, wait, no, I think I got the formula inverted. Let me double-check.

The correct formula is: effusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. So, r ∝ 1/sqrt(M).

So, if gas 1 effuses faster than gas 2, then M2 > M1.

So, r1 > r2 → M2 > M1.

So, in this problem, He (4 g/mol) effuses faster than X. So, M_X > M_He.

So, M_X > 4.0026.

But in the options, all the gases have molar masses above 16? No, let me check the options.

Options:

A: Ne: 20.18

B: CO2: 44.0

C: Ar: 39.95

D: CH4: 16.04

E: O2: 32.00

F: C5H12: 84.23 (assuming C5H12 is 84.23 g/mol)

G: SO2: 64.07

H: N2: 28.01

I: H2O: 18.02

J: C8H18: 114.23 (if C8H18 is 114.23 g/mol)

Wait, so all the options except J have molar masses around 16-114. The problem is that I'm getting M_X ≈ 113.7, which is way higher than any option. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me recompute the math.

We have:

r_X / r_He = sqrt(M_He / M_X )

We know that r_X / r_He = 1/5.33.

So,

1/5.33 = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X)

Square both sides:

(1/(5.33)^2) = 4.0026 / M_X.

So,

M_X = 4.0026 * (5.33)^2.

Compute 5.33 squared.

5.33 *5.33: let's compute it accurately.

5 *5 =25.

5 * 0.33 =1.65.

0.33 *5=1.65.

0.33 *0.33=0.1089.

So, (5 + 0.33)^2 = 25 + 2*(5 *0.33) + 0.33^2.

25 + 3.3 + 0.1089 =25+3.3=28.3; 28.3 +0.1089=28.4089.

So,

M_X =4.0026 *28.4089.

Wait, let me compute 4 *28.4089 = 113.6356.

Then, 0.0026 *28.4089.

Multiply 28.4089 *0.0026.

0.0026 *28 = 0.0728.

0.0026 *0.4089 = approx 0.001063.

So sum: 0.0728 +0.001063=0.073863.

So total M_X =113.6356 +0.073863≈113.7095 g/mol.

Hmm, that's way higher than any of the options. The closest higher option is J:114.23. But why is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, another way: Maybe the question says helium is 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas. That would mean helium's rate is 5.33 times higher. So, r_He = 5.33 * r_X.

Which would mean that r_X / r_He = 1/5.33.

But wait, according to Graham's law, r_X / r_He = sqrt(M_He / M_X).

So, 1/5.33 = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X).

Square both sides:

1/(5.33^2) =4.0026 / M_X.

So, M_X =4.0026 * (5.33)^2=113.7 g/mol.

This again suggests 113.7, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, what if the formula is M_X = M_He * (r_He / r_X)^2.

Because, if X is slower, then r_X = (r_He) /5.33. So,

r_X / r_He = (1/5.33 ), so M_X = M_He * (5.33 )^2.

But that's what I did earlier, which gives 113.7, which isn't in options.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is J: C8H18, which has a molar mass of about 114.23 g/mol. So that's very close to 113.7.

Wait, perhaps due to rounding? Let me re-examine the initial setup.

Wait, what if the unknown gas is lighter than helium, so it's faster. But the question says it's slower, so helium is faster.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong gas for X. Let me re-examine the problem.

Question says: "Helium effuses through a pinhole 5.33 times faster than an unknown gas."

So, helium is faster than the unknown gas. So, M_X < M_He.

But in my calculation, M_X is about 113.7, which is way larger than any option. So, perhaps I need to re-examine the setup.

Wait, maybe the formula is inverted. Let's think about the equation again.

r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So,

(1/5.33 ) = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X )

Square both sides:

1/(5.33)^2 = 4.0026 / M_X.

So,

M_X = 4.0026 * (5.33)^2.

Wait, that's correct.

But if M_X is 113.7, but the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Let me think again. Maybe the question is using inverse rates. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is that the formula is r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

But if I have r_X = 1/5.33 * r_He, then (r_X / r_He ) = 1/5.33.

So, 1/5.33 = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X )

Square: 1 / (5.33^2 ) = 4.0026 / M_X.

So, M_X = 4.0026 * (5.33 )^2 = 4.0026 *28.4089=113.709.

Hmm, but none of the options match 113.7. The next option is J: C8H18, which is 114.23.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that helium is 5.33 times faster than the unknown, meaning r_X = (1/5.33 ) r_He.

So, the setup is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is phrased as X is 5.33 times faster than helium. No, it's the reverse.

Wait, let me think about the problem again.

The question says:

Helium effuses 5.33 times faster than an unknown gas.

So, X is the unknown gas, which effuses slower than helium. So, r_X = (1/5.33 ) r_He.

So, the setup is correct.

But if my calculation gives M_X=113.7, and the options don't have that, maybe I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is r_X = sqrt( M_X / M_He ) * r_He.

No, that's not right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is to take the ratio as (r_X / r_He ) = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the ratio.

No, let's make sure.

Wait, perhaps for the same gas, smaller molar mass leads to faster effusion.

So, if gas X has a smaller molar mass than helium, it will effuse faster. Since the question says helium is faster, X is a gas with a larger molar mass.

But in my calculation, X's molar mass is 113.7, which is way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is r_He =5.33 * r_X.

Which would mean that helium is faster, and the unknown gas is slower.

So, if r_He =5.33 * r_X,

then from Graham's law,

r_X / r_He = sqrt(M_He / M_X )

But if r_X = (1/5.33) r_He,

then,

(1/5.33) = sqrt(M_He / M_X )

So,

(1/5.33)^2 = M_He / M_X.

So,

M_X = M_He * (5.33)^2 =4.0026 *28.4089≈113.7.

Again, same answer.

But none of the options match 113.7. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question uses the rate difference in a different way. Suppose the problem is not about the effusion rates, but perhaps the molar masses are in a different ratio.

Wait, but no. The setup is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M_X = M_He * (r_He / r_X )^2.

Which would give M_X =4.0026*(5.33)^2=113.7.

But the question is asking which of the gases is likely, and the closest is option J: C8H18, which is 114.23.

Hmm, that's very close. So, perhaps the correct answer is option J.

Wait, but why? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the formula. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

r_X / r_He = sqrt(M_He / M_X)

Which is correct.

So, 1/5.33 = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X )

Square both sides:

1/(5.33)^2 =4.0026 / M_X

So,

M_X =4.0026 * (5.33)^2 =113.7.

But none of the options match, except J:114.23.

So, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but why? Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the ratio. Let me think: if the unknown gas is lighter than helium, then its rate is faster. But in the question, helium is faster, so the unknown gas is slower. So, the unknown gas's molar mass is higher.

Wait, but the available options don't have 113.7. So, perhaps the correct answer is J:114.23.

But why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (r_X / r_He ) = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So, if r_X is the unknown gas, which is slower, so r_X / r_He = (M_He / M_X )^0.5.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as r_X = r_He * sqrt( M_He / M_X )

Which would be correct if r_X is slower.

But in the question, r_He =5.33 * r_X.

So,

r_He =5.33 * r_X → r_X = (r_He ) /5.33.

So,

r_X = (r_He ) /5.33.

But according to Graham's law,

r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So,

1/5.33 = sqrt(4.0026 / M_X )

Square both sides:

(1/(5.33)^2 )=4.0026 / M_X.

So,

M_X=4.0026*(5.33)^2=113.7.

So, which option is closest? J is 114.23, which is about 0.53 g/mol higher than 113.7.

That's a 0.4% difference, which might be acceptable, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.33 squared again.

5.33 *5.33:

5*5=25.

5*0.33=1.65. 0.33*5=1.65. So, 5*.33 *2=3.3.

0.33 *0.33=0.1089.

So,

(5 +0.33)^2=25 +2*(5*.33) +0.33^2.

Which is 25 +3.3 +0.1089=28.4089.

So, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question intended that the unknown gas is lighter than helium, and the ratio is 1/5.33.

In that case, the correct M_X is 113.7, which is not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is inverted.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (r_X / r_He ) = sqrt( M_X / M_He )

But that can't be right.

Wait, no, because if X is lighter, its effusion rate is higher.

Wait, but our calculation gives M_X=113.7, which is higher than any options except J.

So, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute 4.0026 multiplied by 28.4089 more accurately.

Let me compute 4.0026 *28.4089.

Compute 4 *28.4089 = 113.6356.

0.0026 *28.4089 = let's compute 28.4089 *0.0026.

28.4089 *0.002 = 0.0568178.

28.4089 *0.0006 = 0.01704534.

Adding these together: 0.0568178 +0.01704534=0.07386314.

So, 0.0026 *28.4089=0.07386314.

So, adding to 113.6356: 113.6356 +0.07386314=113.70946314.

So, M_X=113.70946314 g/mol.

Which is approximately 113.71 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is C8H18, which has a molar mass of 114.23 g/mol.

So, the closest option is J, but it's higher by about 0.52 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rate difference. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (r_X / r_He ) = sqrt( M_X / M_He )

Which would be correct if X is lighter.

Wait, but that's not correct.

Wait, no, because if X is lighter, then effusion rate is higher. So, r_X > r_He.

But in the question, helium is 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas. So, r_He =5.33 *r_X.

So, r_X = (1/5.33) r_He.

So, X is slower than He.

So, X is lighter than He.

So, X is a gas lighter than He, so He has higher molar mass.

So, in this case, the formula should be:

r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_X / M_He )

But if X is lighter, then r_X > r_He. But in our case, r_X < r_He.

So, perhaps the formula is:

r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

Which would imply that r_X < r_He if M_X > M_He.

Wait, that's correct.

So, in this case, r_X / r_He = sqrt( M_He / M_X )

So, 1/5.33= sqrt(4.0026 / M_X )

Square both sides:

1/(5.33)^2 =4.0026 / M_X

So,

M_X=4.0026 * (5.33)^2=113.7.

Which is what I calculated.

But in the options, the closest is J:114.23, which is about 0.53 g/mol higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the setup.

Wait, let me try another approach.

Let me compute the ratio (r_X / r_He ) =1/5.33=0.1876.

Now, according to Graham's law, (r_X / r_He )^2 = M_He / M_X.

So,

(0.1876)^2 =4.0026 / M_X.

Compute 0.1876^2:

0.18 *0.18=0.0324.

0.0076^2=0.00005776.

But more accurately, 0.1876 *0.1876.

Compute 0.18 *0.18 =0.0324.

0.0076 *0.18 =0.001368.

0.18 *0.0076=0.001368.

0.0076 *0.0076=0.00005776.

So, adding all together: 0.0324 +0.001368 +0.001368 +0.00005776.

Total: 0.0324 +0.002736 +0.00005776=0.03519376.

So, (0.1876)^2=0.03519376.

Now, setting this equal to 4.0026 / M_X:

0.03519376 =4.0026 / M_X

So,

M_X=4.0026 /0.03519376.

Compute 4.0026 divided by 0.03519376.

So, 4 /0.03519376= approximately 113.7.

Yes, because 0.03519376 *113.7 ≈4.0026.

So, M_X≈113.7 g/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: C8H18, which has a molar mass of approximately 114.23 g/mol.

So, the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but why? Because the exact molar mass is 113.7, which is very close to J's 114.23.

I think perhaps the intended answer is J, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the square.

Wait, let me compute 4.0026 /0.03519376.

Compute 4 /0.03519376.

0.03519376 *113.7 =4.0026.

So, yes, 4 /0.03519376=113.7.

So, M_X=113.7.

Which is 113.7 g/mol, which is about 0.5 g/mol less than J's 114.23.

So, that's a difference of about 0.4%, which is close.

So, perhaps the intended answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 4.0026 divided by 0.03519376.

4.0026 /0.03519376.

Compute 4.0026 /0.03519376.

Let me compute 4.0026 ÷0.03519376.

We can compute this division as:

4.0026 ÷0.03519376 = (4.0026 *100000000) / (0.03519376 *100000000) =400260000 /35193.76.

Now, compute 400260000 ÷35193.76.

Let me compute this.

35193.76 ×11370= ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 35193.76 ×11370.

Compute 35193.76 ×11370.

= 35193.76 ×10000=351937600.

=35193.76 ×10000=351937600.

=35193.76 ×3000=10,558,1280.

=35193.76 ×70=2,463,563.2.

Adding them all up: 351937600 +10,558,1280 =362,495,728.

+2,463,563.2=364,959,291.2.

So, 35193.76 ×11370=364,959,291.2.

But 400260000 is larger than that.

So, 400260000 -364,959,291.2=35,300,708.8.

Now, 35,300,708.8 ÷35193.76 = approx.

35193.76 ×1000=35,193,760.

35193.76 ×1001=35,193,760 +35,193.76=35,228,953.76.

Hmm, but 35193.76 × 10000=351,937,600.

But 35193.76 ×10000=351,937,600.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 400260000 ÷35193.76.

Dividing 400260000 by 35193.76.

We can write this as 400260000 ÷35193.76 = (400260000 ÷3.519376) ÷1000.

So, first compute 400260000 ÷3.519376.

Then, divide by 1000.

Compute 400260000 ÷3.519376.

Let me compute 400260000 ÷3.519376.

3.519376 ×1,137,000=?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 400260000 ÷3.519376.

Compute 400260000 ÷3.519376.

Compute 400260000 ÷3.519376.

Let me compute 3.519376 ×1,137,000.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to accept that 4.0026 /0.03519376=113.7.

So, M_X=113.7 g/mol.

Which is very close to J:114.23.

So, the correct answer is J.

Therefore, the answer is J, so the correct option is J.

To determine the correct answer, we apply Graham's law of effusion. The problem states that helium is 5.33 times faster than an unknown gas. Using Graham's law:

\[
\left(\frac{r_{\text{X}}}{r_{\text{He}}}\right)^2 = \frac{M_{\text{He}}}{M_{\text{X}}}
\]

Given \( r_{\text{He}} = 5.33 \times r_{\text{X}} \), we have:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5.33}\right)^2 = \frac{4.0026}{M_{\text{X}}}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{28.4089} = \frac{4.0026}{M_{\text{X}}}
\]

\[
M_{\text{X}} = 4.0026 \times 28.4089 \approx 113.7 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The closest option to 113.7 g/mol is J: C8H18, which has a molar mass of approximately 114.23 g/mol. Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
