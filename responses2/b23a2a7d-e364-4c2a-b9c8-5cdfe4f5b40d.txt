Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force between an electron and a positron. Hmm, okay, I remember that both are subatomic particles, but opposite in charge. Let me think about the concepts involved.

Wait, the question gives the charges as -e and +e, so their charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. And then the masses are each 9.11e-31 kg. Oh, right, because they're the same particle, except positron is like electron but positive.

The problem is about the ratio of the electrical force (F_e) to the gravitational force (F_g). So, F_e / F_g. 

I think the formula for the electrical force is Coulomb's law: F = k * (q1 * q2) / r². And the gravitational force is Newton's law of gravitation: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r². 

So the ratio would be (k e² / r²) divided by (G (e^2) / r²). Oh wait, because both have e squared and r squared, so they cancel out. That leaves me with (k) divided by (G). Because the e's and r's are same for both, so (e²)/(e²) is 1, and r² cancels too. So the ratio is just k/(G).

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm the formula. The electrical force between two point charges is F_e = k * (e * e) / r². The gravitational is F_g = G * (e * e) / r². So when I take the ratio F_e / F_g, the e² terms and the r² terms cancel, leaving k/(G).

So the ratio is just (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) divided by (6.674e-11 N·m²/kg²). Let me calculate this.

Let me plug in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²
G = 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg²

So, k/G = (8.988e9) / (6.674e-11) = (8.988 / 6.674) * (1e9 / 1e-11) 

Wait, 1e9 divided by 1e-11 is 1e20. So, (approx 1.348) * 1e20 = 1.348e20? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait, that calculation is wrong because I forgot to calculate the exponents correctly.

Wait, let me recompute. Let's handle the exponents first. 1e9 divided by 1e-11 is 1e(9 - (-11)) = 1e20. So 8.988e9 / 6.674e-11 = (8.988 / 6.674) * 1e20.

What's 8.988 divided by 6.674? Let me compute that. 

6.674 * 1.3 = approx 8.676. 6.674 * 1.348 ≈ 8.988? Let me think: 6.674 * 1 is 6.674. 6.674 * 0.3 is 2.0022. 6.674 * 0.048 is about 0.320. So 1.348 times 6.674 ≈ 6.674 + 2.0022 + 0.320 ≈ 8.996. Oh yeah, so approximately 1.348. So 8.988 / 6.674 ≈ 1.348.

So 1.348e20 is the value of k/G. But wait, wait, the question is about the ratio of F_e over F_g. So the ratio is k/(G), so 1.348e20. But that can't be right because looking at the options, the largest option is about 1e42. Oh, wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait wait, no, maybe I got the charges wrong. Because the mass is same, but the charges are same in magnitude. Wait, but the question says the charges are -e and +e, so same as two electrons. So their charges are same in magnitude. So the ratio F_e / F_g is k/(G), which is about 1.348e20. But that's way smaller than the options given.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e42. That's way bigger. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait—no, wait, the question is about an electron and a positron. Oh, wait, electron is -e, positron is +e. So when they are brought together, the charges are -e and +e. So q1*q2 is (-e)(+e) = -e². But in Coulomb's law, the force's magnitude is based on the product of the magnitudes. So when you take absolute values, it's e².

Wait, but wait a second, the question is about the ratio of the electrical force to gravitational force. So the ratio is F_e / F_g. But F_e is (k * e^2)/r², and F_g is (G * e^2)/r². So the e^2 terms cancel, leaving k/(G). So the ratio is k/(G). But earlier calculation I made only gave about 1.3e20, but the options are around 1e42. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation or perhaps in understanding the problem.

Hmm, perhaps I confused which force is which. Wait, the question says the ratio of the electrical force to gravitational force. So F_e / F_g. But wait, no, because F_e is (k e²)/r² and F_g is (G e²)/r². So F_e / F_g is (k/(G)) * (e²/(e²)) * (1/(r²/r²)) ), which is k/(G).

Wait, so that would mean the ratio is k/(G). But then why the options are so much higher?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. No, I think the formula is correct. Wait, but wait: in the question, the charges are both e and -e? No, the charges are -e and +e. So product is (-e)(+e) = -e². But when you take the force magnitude, it's positive, but in the question, the force is F_e, so it's positive.

Wait, but the ratio F_e / F_g would be (k e² / r²) / (G e² / r²) ) = (k e²) / (G e²) ) * (r²/r²) ) = k/(G). So, it's (8.988e9)/(6.674e-11) = approximately 1.35e20. But the options are all 1e42 or higher. So that's way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I forgot that the mass of the positron is the same as the electron. Because, in the gravitational force, it's the product of their masses. So m_e * m_e, not m_e * m_p. But wait, no, the positron has same mass as electron. So m1 and m2 are both e's mass. So F_g would be G * m_e² / r², which is the same as F_g = G * (e)^2 / r².

Wait, so the ratio is k/(G) again. So that's 1.35e20. But the options are all 1e42 or higher. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I confused the charges. Let me think again. The charges are -e and +e, so product is -e^2. But for force magnitude, it's absolute, so e^2. So when I plug into F_e, it's (k e²)/(r²). So same as before.

But my calculation gives 1.35e20, but the options are all in 1e42.

Wait, maybe I should check the exponent calculations again. Let's compute 8.988e9 / 6.674e-11.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9. 6.674e-11 is 6.674 x 10^-11.

So 8.988e9 / 6.674e-11 = (8.988 / 6.674) * 1e(9 - (-11)) )

= (1.348) * 1e20 = 1.348e20.

Wait, but the options are in 1e42. So that's a factor of 1e20, which is way off. So maybe I'm missing a factor of 1e22 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I confused G and k. Wait, k is Coulomb's constant, which is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

Wait, but what if the denominator is wrong? No, I think that's correct. Because both forces are based on the same distance between the particles. So the distance r^2 would cancel out.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me recompute 8.988e9 divided by 6.674e-11.

So 8.988e9 = 8.988 * 10^9.

6.674e-11 = 6.674 * 10^-11.

So 8.988e9 /6.674e-11 = (8.988 /6.674 ) * (1e9 / 1e-11 )

1e9 / 1e-11 = 1e20.

8.988 /6.674 ≈ 1.348.

So 1.348 * 1e20 = 1.348e20. So the ratio is approx 1.3e20. But that's not in any of the options. The options are 1e42 or 1e42.

Wait, but the options are all 1e42 or 1e42. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps I forgot that the masses are both the same as the electron mass, but in the gravitational force, I should consider the sum of the masses, but in this case, it's an electron and a positron, which are each mass m_e. So m1 and m2 are both m_e. So F_g is G (m_e * m_e) / r². So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the mass of the electron for both charges. So the question gives the charges, but the masses are both e. So perhaps I should compute the ratio as (k * e²) / (G * e²) ) = k/(G), correct.

So why is the answer not matching with the options, which are all around 1e42? Is there a miscalculation?

Wait, wait—hold on, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio. Let me do it more accurately.

Calculate (8.988e9) / (6.674e-11).

Let me compute 8.988 / 6.674. Let me do this division accurately.

6.674 goes into 8.988 how many times?

6.674 * 1 =6.674. 8.988 -6.674=2.314.

Now, 6.674 * 0.35 = approx 2.3359. Hmm. Let me compute 6.674 * 1.348.

Wait, perhaps using exact division.

Wait, 6.674 * 1.348 = ?

Let me compute 6.674 * 1.3 = 8.6762.

6.674 * 0.048 = 0.320352.

Adding these: 8.6762 + 0.320352 = 8.996552.

But the numerator is 8.988, which is 8.988. So 8.988 is less than 8.996552. So 1.348 * 6.674 would be 8.996552, which is a bit more than 8.988. So perhaps the accurate value is 1.348 minus a little.

Wait, so 6.674 * x =8.988. Let me compute x.

I can set up the equation: x = 8.988 /6.674.

Compute 8.988 /6.674.

Let me compute this as:

6.674 * 1.348 = 8.996552, which is a little bit over 8.988.

So 8.996552 -8.988=0.008552.

So the difference is 0.008552. So how much more than 1.348 is x?

We can model this as x = 1.348 + delta.

So 6.674*(1.348 + delta) =8.988.

8.988 + (6.674 * delta) =8.988.

So 6.674 * delta =0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6.674*(1.348) =8.996552>8.988, so 8.996552-8.988=0.008552.

So 6.674 * delta =0.008552.

So delta =0.008552 /6.674 ≈ 0.00128.

So x=1.348 + 0.00128=1.34928.

So x≈1.34928.

So 8.988/6.674 ≈1.34928.

So now, 8.988e9 /6.674e-11 = 1.34928e20.

So approximately 1.349e20.

But the given answer options are all around 1e42. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I confused the signs. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait, I think I got the charges wrong. The charges are -e and +e, so their product is -e². But in the ratio, when you divide F_e by F_g, it's (k * (-e^2)/(r²)) divided by (G * (e^2)/(r²)).

Wait, but the ratio would be (k * (-e^2) / r²) / (G * (e^2)/r² ) = (-k e²) / (G e²) ) * (1/r^2 / 1/r^2) )= (-k / G). But then the ratio would be negative, but the question is about the ratio of the magnitudes? Or perhaps they just want the magnitude.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force. So if F_e is positive (as it's a attractive force, but the question is about the magnitude), probably the ratio is positive, so the negative sign is perhaps irrelevant. But the options are all positive, so perhaps |F_e| / |F_g| would be k/(G) in absolute terms.

But then the calculation still gives 1.349e20. But the given options are about 1e42.

Wait, I'm missing something. Perhaps I forgot that the charges are both e, so the product is e², not -e². Because if you have a -e and a +e, their product is -e². But when you take the ratio, the signs would cancel because the gravitational force is always positive (since it's an attractive force, but its magnitude is positive).

Wait, but the gravitational force is always attractive, so it's a positive force. The electrical force is either attractive or repulsive, but the question refers to the ratio of their magnitudes. So the ratio would be F_e / F_g = (k * e^2 / r^2) / (G * e^2 / r^2) ) = k/(G), which is 1.349e20.

But the options are around 1e42. So this can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the gravitational constant as 6.674e-11, but I might have miscalculated exponents.

Wait, 8.988e9 /6.674e-11 = (8.988 /6.674) * (1e9 /1e-11) )= (1.3492) * (1e20) ) = 1.3492e20.

But the options are 1e42, which is 1e20 times larger. So, perhaps I missed a factor of 1e22 somewhere. But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gravitational force formula. Wait, no, the gravitational force formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the masses. Wait, the problem states that the electron and positron have the same mass, so each is m_e. So F_g is G*(m_e^2)/r².

Wait, but perhaps I need to compute the ratio of the charges to the product of the masses, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I didn't consider that the charges are both e, so the product is e², but the gravitational force would be calculated with mass as m_e and m_e, so m_e^2. So perhaps the ratio is (k e^2)/(G m_e^2) ), but that would be different.

Wait, but the problem says the charges are -e and +e, so the product is -e². But when calculating the ratio F_e / F_g, since both are divided by r², the r² cancels, and the e^2 terms cancel, leaving k/(G), which is 1.3e20.

But the options are much higher, so perhaps the problem was supposed to use the masses of the electron and positron, which are same as individual masses. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the gravitational constant as 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg², but the question is about the gravitational force between two particles each of mass m_e. So the gravitational force would be (G m_e^2) / r^2.

But the question asks for the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force. So F_e / F_g = (k e^2 / r^2) / (G m_e^2 / r^2 ) = (k e^2)/(G m_e^2) )

Ah! So I forgot to include the masses in the gravitational force. So the gravitational force is F_g = G (m_e m_e) / r². So the ratio would be (k e^2) / (G m_e^2) )

Ah, that's a key point I missed. So I need to calculate that instead of just F_e / F_g = k/(G).

So the correct ratio is (k e²) / (G m_e² )

So let's compute that.

Given:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C (charge of electron)

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg (mass of electron)

So substituting into the ratio:

(k e²) / (G m_e² )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute e²:

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Then compute G m_e²:

G = 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg²

m_e² = (9.109e-31 kg)^2 = 8.297e-61 kg².

G m_e² = 6.674e-11 *8.297e-61.

Compute 6.674e-11 * 8.297e-61:

6.674 *8.297 ≈55.55.

Exponents: 1e-11 *1e-61=1e-72.

So 6.674e-11 *8.297e-61≈55.55e-72 =5.555e-71.

So G m_e² ≈5.555e-71 N·m².

Now, compute (k e²)/(G m_e²) = (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) ) / (5.555e-71 )

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = let's compute 8.988 *2.566 = approximately 23.02. Then exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29. So 23.02e-29 =2.302e-28.

Denominator:5.555e-71.

So the ratio is (2.302e-28) / (5.555e-71) )= (2.302 /5.555) ) * (1e-28 /1e-71) )

Compute 2.302 /5.555: approximately 0.415.

Exponents:1e-28 /1e-71 =1e43.

So 0.415e43 =4.15e42.

Wait, so that's approximately 4.15e42. But the options are A)4.16e42, B)8.32e42, C)1.66e42, D)3.33e42.

Wait, so the calculated ratio is approximately 4.15e42, which matches option A (4.16e42) very closely.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force between an electron and a positron, we proceed as follows:

### Key Equations and Constants:
1. **Electrical Force**:  
   \( F_e = \frac{k e^2}{r^2} \)  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \).

2. **Gravitational Force**:  
   \( F_g = \frac{G m_e^2}{r^2} \)  
   where \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \).

3. **Ratio**:  
   \( \frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{\frac{k e^2}{r^2}}{\frac{G m_e^2}{r^2}} = \frac{k e^2}{G m_e^2} \).

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( e^2 \):  
   \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \).

2. Compute \( G m_e^2 \):  
   \( m_e^2 = (9.109 \times 10^{-31})^2 = 8.297 \times 10^{-61} \, \text{kg}^2 \).  
   \( G m_e^2 = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \times (8.297 \times 10^{-61}) = 5.555 \times 10^{-71} \, \text{N·m}^2 \).

3. Compute \( \frac{k e^2}{G m_e^2} \):  
   \( \frac{k e^2}{G m_e^2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \times (2.566 \times 10^{-38})}{(5.555 \times 10^{-71})} \).

4. Simplify:  
   \( \frac{k e^2}{G m_e^2} = \frac{(2.302 \times 10^{-28})}{(5.555 \times 10^{-71})} = 4.15 \times 10^{42} \).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force is approximately \( 4.16 \times 10^{42} \). This matches option A.
