Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the weight of sulfuric acid in a solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says: Calculate the weight in grams of sulfuric acid in 2.00 liters of a 0.100 molars solution. The molecular weight (MW) of H2SO4 is given as 98.1 g/mol.

Wait, molars solution means molarity, right? Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.100 M means there are 0.100 moles of H2SO4 in each liter of solution.

But the question is about the entire 2 liters of the solution, so I need to calculate the total moles first, then multiply by the molecular weight to get grams.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total moles of H2SO4 in 2 liters.
2. Multiply the moles by the molecular weight to get grams.

Step 1: Molarity is moles per liter. So, 0.100 mol/L * 2.00 L = 0.200 moles of H2SO4.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.100 mol/L multiplied by 2 liters is 0.200 moles. Oh wait, yes, that's correct.

Step 2: Moles × MW = grams. So 0.200 moles × 98.1 g/mol = ?

Let me compute that. 0.2 times 98.1. Well, 0.2 is 1/5, so 98.1 divided by 5. 98.1 /5 is 19.62 grams. So approximately 19.6 grams.

Looking at the options, option E is 19.6 g. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think: Molarity is 0.1 M in 2 L, so moles = M × L = 0.1 × 2 = 0.2. Then 0.2 × 98.1 is indeed 19.62, so 19.6 g, which matches option E.

To calculate the weight in grams of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in 2.00 liters of a 0.100 molarsolution, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the total moles of H₂SO₄**:  
   Molarity (M) is defined as moles per liter. Thus,  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume in liters} = 0.100 \, \text{mol/L} \times 2.00 \, \text{L} = 0.200 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. **Convert moles to grams using the molecular weight**:  
   The molecular weight (MW) of H₂SO₄ is 98.1 g/mol. Therefore,  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{MW} = 0.200 \, \text{mol} \times 98.1 \, \text{g/mol} = 19.62 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Match the result to the options**:  
   The calculated mass is approximately 19.6 g, which corresponds to option E.
