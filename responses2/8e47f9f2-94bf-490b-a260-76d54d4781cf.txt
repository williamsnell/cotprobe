Okay, so I have to evaluate this line integral using Green's Theorem. The integral is ∮_C xy dx + x²y³ dy, where C is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2), and the orientation is positive, which means counterclockwise.

First, I remember that Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the region D enclosed by C. The theorem says that ∮_C P dx + Q dy = ∬_D (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA, where P and Q are the components of the vector field.

So, in this problem, P is xy and Q is x²y³. Let me compute the partial derivatives.

∂P/∂y: derivative of xy with respect to y. That's x * derivative of y with respect to y, which is x * 1 = x.

∂Q/∂x: derivative of x²y³ with respect to x. That's 2x y³.

So, the integrand for the double integral would be (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) = (2x y³ - x) = x(2 y³ - 1).

Now, I need to set up the double integral over the region D. The region D is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2). Let me sketch this mentally. It starts at the origin, goes along the x-axis to (1,0), then up to (1,2), and back to (0,0). So it's a right triangle.

To set up the double integral, I can describe D in terms of x and y. Let's think about the limits. For x, it goes from 0 to 1. For a given x, y ranges from the line from (0,0) to (1,2) up to (1,2), but wait, actually, the triangle has sides: from (0,0) to (1,0) is the base, from (1,0) to (1,2) is a vertical line, and from (1,2) back to (0,0) is a diagonal line.

Alternatively, I can express y in terms of x. Let's find the equations of the two lines forming the hypotenuse.

The line from (0,0) to (1,2) has a slope of (2-0)/(1-0) = 2. So its equation is y = 2x.

The other side is the vertical line x=1. But wait, the region is bounded by x from 0 to 1, and for each x, y from the line y = 2x up to y = 2. Wait, no. Wait, the triangle has the three vertices: (0,0), (1,0), and (1, 2). So, the line from (1,0) to (1,2) is x=1, from (0,0) to (1,0) is y=0, and the line from (1,2) to (0,0) is y = 2x.

Wait no, the line from (1,2) to (0,0) is y = 2x, right? Because when x=1, y=2, and when x=0, y=0.

So, the region D can be described as x going from 0 to 1, and y from 0 up to the line y = 2x, but wait, that's not correct because the triangle is bounded by (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2). So actually, when x is between 0 and 1, the lower boundary is y=0, and the upper boundary is the line from (1,2) to (0,0) which is y = 2x, but wait, no. Wait, when x is 1, y is 2. When x is 0, y is 0. So for x between 0 and 1, the upper boundary is not y=2x, because for x between 0 and 1, y=2x starts at (0,0) and goes up to (1,2). But the triangle's other side is the vertical line x=1, which goes from y=0 to y=2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should sketch it.

Alternative approach: Let me think of the triangle as consisting of two regions. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use a different order for the integrals. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the double integral by splitting the region into two parts.

Wait, maybe I should sketch the triangle. The triangle has vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2). So imagine the base along the x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0), and then up to (1,2), and back to (0,0). So the region is a right triangle with base 1 and height 2.

Wait, to set up the double integral, perhaps it's easier to integrate with respect to y first. For a given x, y ranges from the line y=0 (the base) up to y=2x (the hypotenuse) for x from 0 to 1. Wait, no, because at x=1, 2x is 2, which is the same as the vertical line. Wait, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, when x is between 0 and 1, the line from (0,0) to (1,2) is y=2x. So for each x in [0,1], y ranges from 0 up to 2x. So the region is x from 0 to 1, and for each x, y from 0 to 2x.

Wait, but wait, no: the triangle's other edge is from (1,0) to (1,2), which is a vertical line at x=1 from y=0 to y=2. So, for x between 0 and 1, the upper boundary is the line y=2x, but the lower boundary is y=0. But then, the region is a triangle bounded by these three points. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to integrate over x from 0 to 1, and for each x, y ranges from 0 to 2x.

Wait, let's confirm. So when x is 0, y ranges from 0 to 0 (since y=0 and y=2x=0). As x increases, the upper y boundary is 2x, and the lower is 0. So yes, the region D is described by 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2x.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when x is 1, y ranges from 0 to 2. But the vertical line at x=1 goes up to y=2, so the region is indeed bounded by y=0, y=2x, and x=1. Wait, but in that case, for x from 0 to 1, y ranges from 0 to 2x.

So then the double integral becomes ∫ (from x=0 to 1) ∫ (y=0 to 2x) [ x (2 y³ - 1) ] dy dx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute by switching the order of integration. Let's think about y first. The vertical extent of the region is from y=0 to y=2, because the triangle goes up to (1,2). For each y, x ranges from 0 to the line y=2x, which implies x ≤ y/2.

So, the region can also be described as 0 ≤ y ≤ 2, and for each y, x goes from 0 to y/2.

So which order is easier? Let's compute using both methods and see which is simpler.

First method: x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to 2x.

Second method: y from 0 to 2, x from 0 to y/2.

Let me compute both and see.

Option 1:

Double integral = ∫ (x=0 to 1) [ ∫ (y=0 to 2x) x(2y³ -1) dy ] dx.

Compute inner integral first:

∫ (y=0 to 2x) (2y³ - 1) dy = 2*(y⁴/4) from 0 to 2x - ∫ (0 to 2x) 1 dy.

So, 2*( ( (2x)^4 ) /4 ) - (2x - 0) 

= 2*( (16 x^4)/4 ) - 2x 

= 2*(4x⁴) - 2x 

=8x^4 - 2x.

Multiply by x (from the outer integral):

x*(8x^4 -2x) )= 8x^5 - 2x².

Now integrate this from x=0 to x=1.

∫ (8x^5 - 2x²) dx from 0 to1.

= [ (8/6)x^6 - (2/3)x³ ] from 0 to1.

= (8/6)(1) - (2/3)(1) -0.

Simplify: 8/6 = 4/3, 2/3 remains.

So 4/3 - 2/3 = 2/3.

So, the double integral is 2/3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct, because I might have made a mistake in the integration steps.

Wait, let me recheck the inner integral. Let me recalculate:

Inner integral: ∫ (0 to 2x) (2y³ -1) dy.

Integral of 2y³ is 2*(y⁴/4) = (y⁴/2).

Integral of -1 is -y.

So evaluated from 0 to 2x:

(y⁴/2)|0 to 2x = ( (2x)^4 ) /2 - 0 = 16x⁴ / 2 =8x⁴.

Then, minus the integral of 1, which is [y] from 0 to 2x: 2x -0= 2x.

So the inner integral is 8x⁴ - 2x.

Multiply by x (from outer integral):

x*(8x⁴ -2x) =8x^5 - 2x².

Integrate 8x^5 from 0 to 1: 8*(1^6/6) =8/6=4/3.

Integral of -2x² is -2*(x³/3) evaluated from 0 to1: -2*(1/3) = -2/3.

So total is 4/3 - 2/3 = 2/3.

So the double integral is 2/3.

Alternatively, let's try the other method: integrate with respect to x first.

Option 2:

Double integral = ∫ (y=0 to 2) [ ∫ (x=0 to y/2) x(2y³ -1) dx ] dy.

Compute the inner integral:

∫ (x=0 to y/2) x(2y³ -1) dx.

Factor out (2y³ -1):

= (2y³ -1) ∫ x dx from 0 to y/2.

Integral of x is (x²/2). Evaluated from 0 to y/2:

(y/2)^2 / 2 = (y²/4)/2 = y²/(8).

So,

(2y³ -1) * (y²/8) = [2y³ * y² -1 * y² ] /8 = (2y^5 - y²)/8.

Now integrate this with respect to y from 0 to 2.

∫ [ (2y^5 - y² ) /8 ] dy = (1/8) ∫ (2y^5 - y^2) dy.

Compute the integral:

Integral of 2y^5 is 2*(y^6/6) = y^6/3.

Integral of -y² is -y³/3.

So, (1/8) [ y^6/3 - y³/3 ] evaluated from 0 to 2.

At y=2: (64/3 - 8/3) = (56/3). Multiply by 1/8: 56/(3*8) =7/3.

At y=0: 0. So total is 7/3.

Wait, wait, that's 7/3, which is about 2.3333, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I got 2/3 with the first method, which is about 0.6667. That's a discrepancy, which means I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me see. So in the first method, I integrated x from 0 to1, and for each x, y from 0 to 2x. So, the integrand was x*(2y³-1) dy dx.

Wait, but in the second method, I integrated y from 0 to2, and for each y, x from 0 to y/2. So the integrand was x*(2y³-1) dx dy.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second method. Let me re-examine the second integral.

In Option 2:

The inner integral is ∫ [x=0 to y/2] x(2y³ -1) dx.

So, factor out (2y³ -1):

(2y³ -1) * ∫ x dx from 0 to y/2.

Which is (2y³ -1) * [ (x²/2) ] from 0 to y/2.

At x=y/2: ( (y/2)^2 ) / 2 = (y²/4) / 2 = y²/8.

So,

(2y³ -1) * (y²/8) = [2y^5 - y²]/8.

Yes, correct.

Now integrating [ (2y^5 - y²) /8 ] dy from 0 to 2.

So,

(1/8) ∫ 2y^5 dy - (1/8) ∫ y² dy.

Compute each term:

∫ 2y^5 dy = 2*(y^6/6) = y^6/3.

∫ y² dy = y^3/3.

So,

(1/8)[ (y^6/3) - (y^3/3) ] from 0 to2.

At y=2:

(64/3 - 8/3) = 56/3.

Multiply by 1/8: (56/3)*(1/8) =56/(24) =7/3 ≈2.3333.

So the double integral is 7/3, which is approximately 2.3333, option C.

But wait, in the first method, the integral was 2/3. So, that's a problem because Green's theorem says that the line integral is equal to the double integral, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method.

Wait, let me recheck the first method.

First method steps:

1. Compute the partial derivatives:

∂P/∂y = x.

∂Q/∂x = 2x y³.

Integrand: ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y = 2x y³ - x = x(2 y³ -1).

2. Set up the double integral over D.

3. Choose the limits of integration. I considered x from 0 to1, and for each x, y from 0 to 2x.

So, the integral becomes ∫ (x=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to 2x) x(2y³ -1) dy dx.

Compute inner integral:

∫ (2y³ -1) dy from 0 to 2x is:

2*(y^4/4) from 0 to 2x → (2*( (2x)^4 ))/4 → 2*(16x^4)/4 = (32x^4)/4 =8x^4.

Then subtract ∫1 dy from 0 to 2x → 2x.

So, inner integral is 8x^4 -2x.

Multiply by x: x*(8x^4 -2x) =8x^5 -2x².

Integrate from x=0 to1: ∫8x^5 dx is (8/6)x^6, evaluated from 0 to1 → 8/6 =4/3.

∫-2x² dx → -(2/3)x³ evaluated from 0 to1 → -2/3.

So total integral is 4/3 -2/3 = 2/3.

So the double integral is 2/3.

But in the second method, I get 7/3 ≈2.3333.

So I'm getting two different answers. Which one is correct? That can't be.

Wait a minute, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the limits of integration for the double integral. Let me re-examine the region.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's better to evaluate the double integral by switching the order of integration. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the first method's calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the first method's inner integral.

Inner integral in first method: ∫ (y=0 to 2x) (2y³ -1) dy.

Compute: 2*(y^4/4) from 0 to 2x → 2*( ( (2x)^4 ) /4 - 0 ) → 2*( (16x^4)/4 ) → 2*(4x^4) )=8x^4.

Then subtract ∫1 dy from 0 to 2x → 2x.

So total inner integral is 8x^4 - 2x.

Multiply by x: 8x^5 -2x².

Integrate from 0 to1: 8*(1/6) - 2*(1/3) → (8/6 - 2/3) = (4/3 - 2/3) → 2/3.

So the first method gives 2/3.

But the second method gives 7/3, which is about 2.3333.

This inconsistency implies that I made a mistake in one of the methods.

Let me check the second method again.

In the second method, I set up the integral as y from 0 to2, and for each y, x from 0 to y/2.

So, double integral = ∫ (y=0 to2) ∫ (x=0 to y/2) x(2y³ -1) dx dy.

Compute inner integral in terms of x:

∫ x (2y³ -1) dx from 0 to y/2.

So, factor out (2y³ -1):

(2y³ -1) * ∫ x dx from 0 to y/2.

Integral of x is (x²/2) from 0 to y/2.

At x= y/2: ( (y/2)^2 ) /2 → (y²/4)/2 → y²/(8).

So,

(2y³ -1) * (y²/8) )= (2y³ * y² )/8 - (1 * y²)/8 → (2y^5)/8 - y²/8 → (y^5 /4 ) - (y² /8).

So, the inner integral is (y^5 /4) - (y² /8).

Now, integrate this with respect to y from 0 to 2.

So,

∫ [ (y^5 /4) - (y²/8) ] dy from 0 to 2.

Compute each part:

∫ y^5 /4 dy = (1/4) * (y^6/6) )= y^6/(24).

∫ y² /8 dy = (1/8) * (y^3/3) )= y^3/(24).

So, the integral becomes:

[ y^6/(24) - y^3/(24) ] evaluated from 0 to2.

At y=2:

(64/24) - (8/24) = (64 -8)/24 =56/24 =14/6 =7/3.

At y=0:0.

So the total is 7/3.

Wait, so the second method gives 7/3, which is about 2.3333.

But the first method gives 2/3.

So which is correct? I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the limits of integration in the first method.

Wait, let me think again: the first method set up the limits for x from 0 to1, and for each x, y from 0 to 2x.

But perhaps the region is a different shape, and the limits are wrong. Let me sketch the region again.

The triangle has points (0,0), (1,0), (1,2). So, it's a right triangle with base 1, height 2, and hypotenuse from (1,2) to (0,0).

Wait, no, because the other side from (1,0) to (1,2) is vertical, but the line from (0,0) to (1,2) is the hypotenuse.

Wait, but the region is a triangle bounded by (0,0), (1,0), and (1,2). So, to compute the double integral, perhaps the limits should be x from 0 to1, and for each x, y from 0 to max(0, 2x). Wait, but 2x is the upper boundary of y for x from 0 to1.

Wait, but 2x is only positive when x is positive.

So, for all x from 0 to 1, y ranges from 0 to 2x.

So the limits are correct as in the first method.

But why does the second method give a different answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the Green's theorem application.

Wait, the line integral around the closed curve is equal to the double integral of the curl. So, the line integral is ∮ ( x(2y³ -1) ) dy dx.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign during the Green's theorem application.

Wait, Green's theorem states ∮ (Pdx + Qdy) = ∫∫ (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA.

In the problem, P = xy, Q = y^2 x.

Wait, no: wait, P is the function that gives x dx. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the line integral is ∮ (P dx + Q dy), where P = x y, and Q = y^2 x.

Wait, no:

Wait, the line integral is ∮ (P dx + Q dy), where P = x y, Q = y^2 x.

Wait, no, wait: no, wait, no:

Wait, the line integral is given as ∮ (P dx + Q dy), where P and Q are the functions in the problem.

Wait, in the problem, the integral is ∮ (x^2 y dx + x y^2 dy).

Wait, no, the problem says:
