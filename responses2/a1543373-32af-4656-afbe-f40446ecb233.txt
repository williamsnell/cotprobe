Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here. Let me see... The equation is y'' - y' - 2y = 0, with initial conditions y(0) = α and y'(0) = 2. The question is asking me to find α such that the solution approaches zero as t approaches infinity. The options are from A to J, with some numbers. Hmm, I remember that for linear differential equations with constant coefficients, we often solve them using characteristic equations. Let me try to recall how that works.

First, the differential equation is linear and homogeneous, which is good. So, I can write the characteristic equation by assuming a solution of the form y = e^(rt). Plugging that into the DE should give me a quadratic equation in r. Let me set up the characteristic equation:

r² - r - 2 = 0.

Wait, is that right? Because the DE is y'' - y' - 2y =0, so substituting y = e^(rt) gives y'' = r²e^(rt), y' = re^(rt), so substituting:

r²e^(rt) - r e^(rt) - 2 e^(rt) = 0.

Divide both sides by e^(rt) (since it's never zero), so the characteristic equation is r² - r - 2 = 0. Yep, that's correct.

Now I need to solve the quadratic equation r² - r - 2 = 0. Let me factor this or use the quadratic formula. Let me see, factors of -2 that add up to -1. Hmm, 2 and -1: 2 * (-1) = -2, and 2 + (-1) = 1. Wait, but the equation is r² - r - 2, so the signs would be different. Let me check: (r - 2)(r + 1) = r² + r - 2r - 2 = r² - r -2. Yes, that's correct. So the roots are r = 2 and r = -1.

So the general solution of the DE is y(t) = C1 e^(2t) + C2 e^(-t), right? Because the roots are real and distinct, so the solution is a combination of exponentials with those exponents.

Now, apply the initial conditions. Let's write down the initial conditions:

y(0) = α = C1 e^(0) + C2 e^(0) = C1 + C2.

y'(0) = 2. Let's compute y'. y' = 2 C1 e^(2t) - C2 e^(-t). At t=0, y'(0) = 2 C1 - C2.

So, we have a system of equations:

1) C1 + C2 = α

2) 2 C1 - C2 = 2.

We can solve for C1 and C2. Let's add the two equations:

Equation 1: C1 + C2 = α

Equation 2: 2 C1 - C2 = 2

Adding them: 3 C1 = α + 2 → C1 = (α + 2)/3.

Then, substituting back into equation 1: (α + 2)/3 + C2 = α → C2 = α - (α +2)/3 = (3α - α -2)/3 = (2α - 2)/3.

So now, the solution is y(t) = [(α + 2)/3] e^(2t) + [(2α - 2)/3] e^(-t).

Now, the question is about the solution approaching zero as t approaches infinity. So, for y(t) to approach zero, each term in the solution must approach zero as t → ∞. 

Looking at the terms: e^(2t) grows without bound as t increases, so the coefficient of that term, (α +2)/3, must be zero to prevent y(t) from blowing up. Otherwise, the term would dominate and y(t) wouldn't approach zero. Similarly, the term with e^(-t) will go to zero as t increases regardless of its coefficient, so we don't need to worry about that term. 

So, set (α +2)/3 = 0 → α +2 = 0 → α = -2.

Is that right? Let me double-check. If α is -2, then C1 = ( -2 + 2 )/3 = 0. And C2 is ( 2*(-2) - 2 ) /3 = (-4 -2)/3 = -6/3 = -2. So the solution becomes y(t) = 0*e^(2t) + (-2)e^(-t) = -2 e^(-t). So as t approaches infinity, e^(-t) approaches zero, so y(t) approaches zero. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, B is -2. So that's the answer.

To solve the initial value problem \( y'' - y' - 2y = 0 \) with \( y(0) = \alpha \) and \( y'(0) = 2 \), we start by finding the characteristic equation:

\[
r^2 - r - 2 = 0
\]

Factoring, we get \( (r - 2)(r + 1) = 0 \), so the roots are \( r = 2 \) and \( r = -1 \). The general solution is:

\[
y(t) = C_1 e^{2t} + C_2 e^{-t}
\]

Applying the initial conditions:

1. \( y(0) = \alpha = C_1 + C_2 \)
2. \( y'(0) = 2 = 2C_1 - C_2 \)

Solving these equations, we find:

\[
C_1 = \frac{\alpha + 2}{3}, \quad C_2 = \frac{2\alpha - 2}{3}
\]

For \( y(t) \) to approach zero as \( t \to \infty \), the coefficient of \( e^{2t} \) must be zero, giving \( \alpha = -2 \).

**Answer:** B
