Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Find the number that makes the statement 2 over 9 equals 14 over something true. The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 14 to 63. Hmm, I think I need to figure out what number goes in the blank so that both fractions are equal.

Let me write down the fractions: 2/9 and 14/? So, the equation would be 2/9 = 14/x. I remember that when two fractions are equal, their cross products should be equal too. That is, 2 times x should equal 9 times 14. So, 2x = 126. To find x, I divide both sides by 2, which gives me x = 63. Wait, but I should check the options to see if 63 is there. Looking back, option G is 63. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Alternatively, I can think about it as a proportion. If 2 is to 9 as 14 is to x, then x should be (14 * 9)/2. Let me calculate that: 14 times 9 is 126, divided by 2 is 63. Yep, that confirms it. So option G is correct.

The correct number is 63, which corresponds to option G.
