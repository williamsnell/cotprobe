Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.
"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 would have been generally endorsed by the Progressive Party of that era. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Progressive Party was founded in 1866 by Thomas P. Morgan and was known for advocating for the public interest, equal opportunities, and the principle of equality for all. They supported the idea of a republic, not a monarchy, and were against strict taxation. They also promoted the "Square Deal" idea, which aimed to reduce the burden on the government by allowing states to pass laws to regulate trade and enforcement of tariffs.

The Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 was a significant law that implemented a higher tax on imports. It was part of the 1911 Tariff of Gavins, which was a series of tariffs on various imports, including steel, coal, sugar, and others. The Underwood-Simmons Tariff raised the import duty on steel and other essential industrial goods, and it was a major shift in the U.S. trade policy.

The Progressive Party was a pro-trade unionist party. They believed that the U.S. should rely on the private sector for economic growth and that the government should play a smaller role. They supported industrial policies, like the "Square Deal," which aimed to reduce the burden on the government by allowing states to regulate trade and enforcement of tariffs.

So, if the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was seen as a way to reduce government intervention in trade (by increasing tariffs), that would align with the Progressive Party's values. The Progressive Party was pro-union, so they would likely support such a policy, believing that it would lead to a more efficient and fair trade system.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes because supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's "Square Deal." The underwood-simmons was about reducing government intervention through tariffs, which is what the Progressive Party was pro- Square Deal. So A could be correct.

B: Tariff promoted industrial justice. The underwood-simmons did have a focus on industrial trade, promoting increased industrial production. So B is correct too.

C: No because it didn't promote equal opportunity. The Progressive Party did support equal opportunity. So C would be incorrect.

D: No because it was a perversion. But the underwood-simmons was a way to promote industrial trade, so the Progressive Party would support it, not oppose it. So D is incorrect.

E: Yes because most Democrats supported lower duties. The Progressive Party was against strict lower duties. They did support higher tariffs. So E is incorrect.

F: No because mostly opposed Woodrow Wilson. The underwood-simmons was more about industrial trade than about foreign tariffs. So F is incorrect.

G: No because Progressive was against any form of taxation. No, because they did tax but in a pro-union way. So G is incorrect.

H: No because supporters of Teddy. The underwood-simmons was about reducing government intervention, not supporting Teddy. So H is incorrect.

So the options are A, B, and C. But wait, the question is whether the Progressive Party would generally endorse the Tariff. Since the Progressive Party supported the "Square Deal" and promoted industrial trade, the Tariff aligns with their vision, so the answer would be A and B.

Wait, but the question is the answer options are A to H. So the correct answer should be that the Progressive Party would support the underwood-simmons tariff. Looking at the options, the answer would include either A or B.

But wait, the question is phrased as "would the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era?"

The underwood-simmons aimed to increase tariffs on certain goods, which the Progressive Party saw as a way to promote industrial and trade growth. So the Progressive Party would have supported this policy. So the answer would be either A or B.

Looking back at the options, the question is which option is correct. The options are:

A: Yes, because supporters of Teddy's Square Deal.

B: Yes, because it promoted industrial justice.

So both A and B seem correct. But wait, the question is asking whether the Progressive party would generally endorse the underwood-simmons tariff. The underwood-simmons was about industrial trade, so the Progressive party would support it.

Wait, the issue is whether the Progressive Party would endorse or oppose theUnderwood-Simmons Tariff. The Progressive Party was pro-union, pro-industrial, pro- Tariff on trade.

Option A says yes because supporters of Teddy's Square Deal. That's correct because the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal.

Option B says yes because it promoted industrial justice. That's also correct because they supported industrial policies.

Wait, but both A and B are correct from the options. But the answer can only be one letter.

Wait, but the question is about whether the Progressive Party would generally support the Tariff. The underwood-simmons aimed to increase the import duty on certain goods. So the Progressive Party would have supported it.

So the options are A and B. But the question is about which of these is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is whether the Progressive party would generally endorse. So the answer is yes. So the options are A, B, and perhaps others.

Wait, the options are A to H, and the answer must be one letter.

So the options are A: yes because of Teddy's Square Deal, B: yes because of industrial justice.

So both A and B are correct. But looking back, the underwood-simmons was a key part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party was a proponent of. So option A is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the underwood-simmons. Let me think again. The underwood-simmons was part of the "Square Deal," which the Progressive Party supported. So A is correct.

But wait, another angle: the Progressive Party was against strict lower duties. The underwood-simmons was about higher duties, promoting industrial trade. So the underwood-simmons aligns with their pro-union, pro-industrial policy.

So the answer would be either A or B.

But looking at the answer options, the correct answer is A or B.

Wait, the options are:

A: yes, because supporters of Teddy's Square Deal

B: yes, because it promoted industrial justice

So both are correct, but the question is which of the following is the answer.

Wait, but the question is which is the correct option. The question is, would the Underwood-Simmons Tariff be generally endorsed by Progressives?

The underwood-simmons was a proposal that the Progressive Party supported. So the answer is A or B.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: Yes, because supporters of Teddy's "Square Deal"

B: Yes, because the tariff promoted industrial justice

So both A and B seem correct. But the options are letters, so the answer must be one letter.

Wait, the question is about whether the Progressive party would support the underwood-simmons. The underwood-simmons was aimed at promoting industrial trade, so they would support it. So both A and B are correct, but in the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, but the question is which of the options is correct. The options are A to H, and the correct answer is either A, B, C, etc.

Wait, let me see: the underwood-simmons was about increasing tariffs on imports, promoting industrial growth. The Progressive Party supported that by supporting the "Square Deal." So the underwood-simmons was a part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party was a supporter of. So the answer would be option A, because the underwood-simmons was aimed at the Square Deal.

Alternatively, option B, which says the tariff promoted industrial justice. The underwood-simmons did promote industrial trade, so option B is also correct.

Wait, but the question is, would the Progressive party generally endorse the underwood-simmons? So the answer is yes, and the underwood-simmons was a pro-union, pro-industrial policy, so the answer is either A or B.

Wait, but looking back, the Progressive Party was a pro-union, pro-industrial, pro- Tariff on trade. So they would support any policy that aimed to promote industrial growth and reduce government intervention. The underwood-simmons was part of that.

So the answer would be either A or B.

Looking at the options, both A and B are correct, but the question is which letter is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because it's about the Square Deal. But the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, and the Progressive Party was a supporter.

Alternatively, both A and B are correct. But looking at the options, both are correct in this case. But the question is, the underwood-simmons was a way to promote industrial justice. So option B is correct.

Wait, perhaps the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which aimed at industrialization, so the Progressive Party would support it.

In that case, both A and B are correct, but in the options, only one letter is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because the underwood-simmons was aimed at the "Square Deal," which the Progressive Party was a supporter of.

Alternatively, the underwood-simmons was more about industrial trade, which the Progressive Party supported.

Wait, the question is whether the Progressive party would support the underwood-simmons. The underwood-simmons was a way to promote industrial trade and reduce government intervention. So the answer should be yes, and the correct option is either A or B.

Wait, the options are:

A: Yes, because supporters of Teddy's "Square Deal"

B: Yes, because the tariff promoted industrial justice

So both A and B are correct. But the question is asking for which option is correct.

Wait, but in the options, only one letter is correct. So perhaps the answer is option A because underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party was pro-.

Alternatively, the underwood-simmons aimed at promoting industrial trade, so option B is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. The question is whether the underwood-simmons would be generally endorsed by Progressives.

Underwood-simmons was about increasing tariffs on certain goods. The Progressive Party was a pro-union, pro-industrialist; they supported a system that allowed states to regulate trade, not to impose their own tariffs. So the underwood-simmons was a way to align with that vision. Hence, the Progressive Party would support it.

So both A and B are correct. But the options are A to H, and each letter is a separate option. So perhaps the answer is A and B, but the options are exclusive.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct answers would be A and B. But I have to choose one. Hmm, but the question is presented as a single-choice question, so perhaps the correct answer is either A or B.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party supported. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, the underwood-simmons promoted industrial trade, so the answer is B.

But looking at the options, both A and B are correct. Hmm, perhaps the answer is A because the underwood-simmons was aimed at promoting a Square Deal, which the Progressive Party supported. So the answer is A.

Wait, but the underwood-simmons was also about promoting industrial justice, so option B is also correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and B. But the question only allows one letter, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the underwood-simmons was a proposal that the Progressive Party would have supported. The underwood-simmons aimed to reduce the burden on the government, which the Progressive Party would have done because they supported a republic. So the answer is either A or B.

Wait, but the question is about the underwood-simmons being generally endorsed. The underwood-simmons was a part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party supported. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, the underwood-simmons promoted industrial justice, which the Progressive Party supported. So the answer is B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option says.

Option A: Yes, because supporters of Teddy's "Square Deal."

The underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party supported. So A is correct.

Option B: Yes, because the tariff promoted industrial justice.

The underwood-simmons did promote industrial trade, so B is correct.

Now, the options are A and B as correct. But the question requires a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the underwood-simmons aligns with the Square Deal, and the Progressive Party was pro- Square Deal.

Alternatively, the underwood-simmons was aimed at promoting industrial trade, so option B is correct.

But the question is whether the Progressive party would support the underwood-simmons. The underwood-simmons was a proposal that the Progressive Party would support, as it was part of the Square Deal. So the answer is A.

Wait, but the underwood-simmons also promoted industrial justice. So both A and B are correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because the underwood-simmons was about reducing government intervention in trade, which was a key aspect of the Progressive Party's vision. Option A says the Progressive party was broadly supporting the "Square Deal," which the underwood-simmons was part of.

Alternatively, the underwood-simmons was promoted as a way to promote industrial trade, so option B is correct.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to look for the most accurate option. The underwood-simmons aimed to increase tariffs on certain imports, promoting industrial trade. So the Progressive Party would have supported this. So option B is correct.

Wait, no, the underwood-simmons was a way to promote industrial trade, so the Progressive Party would support it. So option B is correct.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Another approach: the Progressive Party was pro-union, pro-industrial, pro Tariffs. The underwood-simmons aimed to reduce government intervention in trade, promoting industrial growth. So the answer is A.

But the underwood-simmons also promoted industrial justice, which would make B correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both A and B, but the options are exclusive. So the question might have a mistake, but assuming the options are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A because the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party was a proponent of.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's about the Square Deal. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the underwood-simmons was aimed at reducing government intervention, which the Progressive Party did support. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, the underwood-simmons promoted industrial justice, so the answer is B.

But I'm not entirely confident. I'll have to go with the best reasoning.

The underwood-simmons aimed to increase tariffs on certain imports, which promoted industrial trade. The Progressive Party supported this because they were pro- Tariffs and wanted to reduce government intervention. So option B is correct.

But wait, the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party was pro- about. So option A is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I think I should make an educated guess. Looking for the most accurate option.

The underwood-simmons was a proposal that aimed to promote industrial trade and reduce government intervention. The Progressive Party was a pro-union, pro-industrialist. So the answer is both A and B are correct, but in the options, the correct answer is either A or B.

Wait, perhaps the underwood-simmons was aimed more at promoting industrial justice, which the Progressive Party did support. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party was pro- about. So the answer is A.

Wait, but the question is about the underwood-simmons. So the correct answer is either A or B.

Wait, perhaps the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party supported, but it also promoted industrial justice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and B, but the options are exclusive. So I think the best answer is A, because the underwood-simmons was part of the Square Deal, which the Progressive Party was pro- about. Alternatively, the underwood-simmons promoted industrial trade, so B is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the underwood-simmons aimed to promote industrial trade and thus align with the Progressive Party's vision.

So I think the answer is A.
