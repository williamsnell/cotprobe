Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which pair of religions are both universalizing. Hmm, universalizing means they have a broad historical and cultural impact, right? I remember that some religions spread widely, like in different regions and have a significant global presence.

Let's go through the options. Option A is Christianity and Buddhism. I know both have a big influence across the world, but I'm not sure. Do they both have universalizing effects? I recall that Christianity is pretty widespread, but Buddhism's universalizing power might be limited. Maybe not both.

Option B is Taoism and Shinto. I think both are local religions, used in specific regions. They don't really spread to many places, so they're not universalizing. So probably not this pair.

Option C is Judaism and Buddhism. Both are widely spread. I remember that Judaism is in every country, and Buddhism also spreads across many places. So this might be a possibility. But I should check the others to make sure.

Option D is Hinduism and Buddhism. Both are well-known and spread widely. Hinduism is in almost every country, and Buddhism also has a big presence. So this could be another correct pair.

Option E is Islam and Sikhism. Both are widely used in different regions. But do they spread to many places globally? I'm not sure. I think they both have significant influence, but perhaps they're not the same in their universality. Maybe they're similar in that they're both global, but they might not be both considered universalizing in the same way.

Option F is Taoism and Islam. I'm not sure about the extent of their influence. I think both are widely used, but perhaps not as much as other religions. So maybe not both universalizing.

Option G is Shinto and Hinduism. Shinto is a local religion used in Japan, while Hinduism is in many places. So they're both widely used but in different regions. So they both have universalizing effects, but the question is about which pair.

Option H is Sikhism and Judaism. Both are widely used in different regions, but do they both have a universalizing effect? I'm not as sure about this one.

Option I is Islam and Judaism. Both are widely used, but they're both monotheistic, so their universalizing effects might be similar. Do they both have a broad influence? I think they do. Both have a global presence and are widely taught, so this could be another correct pair.

Option J is Zoroastrianism and Judaism. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion in Iran, but I'm not sure if it's widely used. I think it's more in the north. Whereas Judaism is global. So they might not both be considered universalizing in the same way.

So looking back, the correct options are C (Judaism and Buddhism), D (Hinduism and Buddhism), and I (Islam and Judaism). Wait, but the question asks for a pair, so only one option should be the correct answer. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct answer is either C, D, or I. Maybe the question expects only one correct answer. Let me recall: which of these are both universalizing.

Option C: Both are widely spread. So yes.

Option D: Both are well-known and spread widely.

Option I: Both are widely used. So yes.

But wait, the options are separate; only one is correct. So I need to find which of these four options is correct. Let's see.

I think the right answer is C: Judaism and Buddhism. Because both have a broad global influence. The question is about which pair are both universalizing. So I think the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C: Judaism and Buddhism. Both religions are widely influential and have a global presence, making them both universalizing. 

Answer: C
