Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the molarity of a sulfuric acid solution. Hmm, molarity is the concentration of a solution, right? Molarity (M) is moles of solute per liter of solution. I remember the formula is M = moles / liters.

The problem says there's 10.0 grams of sulfuric acid in 500 ml of solution. The molecular weight (MW) of sulfuric acid is given as 98.1 g/mol. Oh, right, MW is the molar mass, so grams divided by MW gives moles.

Wait, wait. Let me think step by step. First, find the moles of H2SO4. Moles = mass / MW. So, 10.0 grams divided by 98.1 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 10.0 / 98.1 is approximately 0.1019 moles. Hmm, about 0.1019 mol.

But wait, that's in 500 ml of solution. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, the solution volume is 500 ml, which is 0.5 liters. Oh right, because 1 liter is 1000 ml, so 500 is half that.

So the volume is 0.5 L. Molarity is moles divided by liters. So I have 0.1019 mol / 0.5 L. Let's compute that. 0.1019 / 0.5 is 0.2038 M. Oh, so approximately 0.204 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.204 M, which matches. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes grams are tricky, but yeah, 10g divided by 98.1 is roughly 0.1019. Then, 0.1019 divided by 0.5 is 0.2038, which rounds to 0.204. So A seems correct.

To calculate the molarity of the sulfuric acid solution, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}}
\]

1. **Calculate moles of H₂SO₄**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molecular weight (g/mol)}} = \frac{10.0 \, \text{g}}{98.1 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.1019 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Convert volume to liters**:  
   \[
   500 \, \text{ml} = 0.5 \, \text{L}
   \]

3. **Calculate molarity**:  
   \[
   \text{Molarity} = \frac{0.1019 \, \text{mol}}{0.5 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.204 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Select the correct option**:  
   The calculated molarity is approximately **0.204 M**, which corresponds to option **A**.
