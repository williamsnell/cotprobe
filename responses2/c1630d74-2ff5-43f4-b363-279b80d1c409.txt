Okay, so I have this physics problem about single-slit diffraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the width of a single slit when certain conditions are met. Let me read it again.

The setup is a single slit illuminated by red light (650 nm) causing first-order Fraunhofer diffraction minima at an angular distance of θ = 5 degrees from the optic axis. I need to find the slit width from the given options.

Wait, I remember that Fraunhofer diffraction is the same as diffraction at a very far distance, so we can use the formula for the minima. Oh right, the formula for the minima in single-slit diffraction is a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order of the minimum.

Wait, the first-order minima would be m=1, right? So m equals the order of the minimum. So for the first order, it's m=1.

So the equation is a * sinθ = m * λ. The question gives θ as 5 degrees. So I can solve for a.

But wait, do I need to convert degrees to radians for this? Because sine functions in physics equations usually use radians. But wait, the problem gives θ in degrees, so I need to make sure my calculator uses degrees or I convert it first.

Alternatively, I could compute sin(5 degrees) numerically. Let me think, 5 degrees is small, so sin(θ) is approximately θ in radians. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 5 degrees is about 0.087 radians. So sin(5 degrees) ≈ 0.087. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately. Let me think, sin(5°) is approximately 0.08716.

So plugging in the numbers: a = (m * λ) / sinθ.

The wavelength λ is 650 nm. Wait, nm is 1e-9 meters. So 650 nm is 650e-9 meters.

m is 1, right? So a = (1 * 650e-9 m) / 0.08716.

Wait, let me compute that. 650e-9 divided by 0.08716.

Wait, 650e-9 is 6.5e-7 m.

6.5e-7 m / 0.08716 ≈ ?

Let me compute this. 6.5e-7 / 0.08716. Let's do the division. 

Hmm, 6.5e-7 / 0.08716 ≈ approximately 7.45e-5 m. Wait, because 0.08716 * 7.45e-5 = 6.5e-7. Let me check that.

Wait, 7.45e-5 is 0.0000745. Multiply by 0.08716: 0.0000745 * 0.08716 ≈ 0.0000065 (since 745e-7 * 8716e-5 = 650e-12 * 10^(-7+5) = wait, maybe it's easier to approximate.

Wait, 7.45e-5 * 0.08716 = ?

7.45e-5 * 0.08716 = (7.45 * 0.08716) * 1e-5.

7.45 * 0.08716 is approximately 0.649, so 0.649e-5 = 6.49e-6 m. Wait, but 650 nm is 6.5e-7 m. Hmm, so I'm getting a value a bit higher than that. That suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 6.49e-6 m is 6.49e-3 mm, since 1 m is 1000 mm. Oh no, wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 mm is 1e-3 m. So 6.49e-6 m is 6.49e-3 mm.

But the options are in the range of 5e-3 mm (option E) up to 3e-3 mm (H). Hmm, wait, 6.49e-3 is about 6.5e-3 mm. But looking at the options, option I is 2e-4 mm, which is way smaller.

Wait, but I'm getting 6.49e-3 mm, which is 6.49 mm. Oh wait no, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, 1e-3 m is 1 mm. So 6.49e-6 m is 6.49e-3 mm? Because 6.49e-6 m is 0.00649 mm. Oh, no, because 1 mm is 1e-3 m, so 1e-6 m is 0.001 mm. So 6.49e-6 m is 0.00649 mm. Hmm, but none of the options are around 0.006 mm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should write it in meters:

a = (1 * 650e-9 m) / (0.08716) 

So a = 650e-9 / 0.08716.

Let me compute 650e-9 divided by 0.08716.

650e-9 is 6.5e-7 m.

6.5e-7 / 0.08716 = ?

Let me compute 6.5e-7 / 0.08716.

I can write 0.08716 as 8.716e-2.

So 6.5e-7 / 8.716e-2 = (6.5 / 8.716 ) * 1e-5.

6.5 / 8.716 ≈ 0.745.

So 0.745 * 1e-5 = 7.45e-6 meters.

Wait, 7.45e-6 meters is 0.00745 mm. Because 1e-6 m is 0.001 mm. So 7.45e-6 m is 7.45e-3 mm. Oh, because 7.45e-6 m = 7.45e-3 mm.

Wait, because 1 mm is 1e-3 m. So 1e-6 m is 1e-3 mm, so 7.45e-6 m is 7.45e-3 mm.

Ah, so the slit width is approximately 7.45e-3 mm. Looking at the options, option C is 7.45 × 10^-3 mm. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait again. Because I thought 0.00745 mm is 7.45e-3 mm. Because 0.00745 is 7.45e-3. So the slit width is 7.45e-3 mm.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the width of the single slit, we use the condition for the minima in Fraunhofer diffraction, given by the formula:

\[
a \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

Here:
- \( a \) is the slit width (to be determined),
- \( \theta = 5^\circ \) is the angular distance of the minima,
- \( m = 1 \) is the first-order minimum,
- \( \lambda = 650 \, \text{nm} = 650 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) is the wavelength of the light.

### Step 1: Solve for \( a \)
Rearranging the formula:

\[
a = \frac{m \lambda}{\sin \theta}
\]

Substitute the known values:
- \( m = 1 \),
- \( \lambda = 650 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( \theta = 5^\circ \).

First, calculate \( \sin \theta \). Since \( \theta \) is in degrees, it is approximately \( \sin(5^\circ) \approx 0.08716 \).

\[
a = \frac{1 \times 650 \times 10^{-9}}{0.08716}
\]

### Step 2: Perform the calculation
\[
a = \frac{650 \times 10^{-9}}{0.08716} \approx 7.45 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert meters to millimeters (\( 1 \, \text{mm} = 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
a \approx 7.45 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The calculated slit width is \( 7.45 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mm} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
