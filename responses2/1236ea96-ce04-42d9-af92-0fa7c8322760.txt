Okay, so I've got this physics problem about calculating the critical angle when an electromagnetic wave passes from different dielectrics into air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

Wait, right, the critical angle occurs when the wave is traveling from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower. Because the refractive index is higher, the wave can't escape the medium if it's moving into air (which has a lower index). The critical angle is where the angle of incidence is 90 degrees.

The formula I remember is that the critical angle theta_c is given by sin(theta_c) = n_air / n_medium. Oh wait, no, no, wait. Wait, if the medium is denser than air, then n_medium > n_air. So when the incoming wave is at the critical angle, it's when sin(theta_c) equals n_air divided by n_medium. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The condition for total internal reflection is when the refractive index of the medium is greater than that of air. So, for the wave going from the other medium (higher n) into air (lower n). So the critical angle is when sin(theta_c) = n_air / n_medium. Because when the angle is larger than theta_c, the wave doesn't escape.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the formula is that the maximum angle (theta_c) where the wave just starts to reflect. So if n_medium > n_air, then sin(theta_c) = n_air / n_medium. So, when n_medium is higher, the critical angle is smaller because the ratio is smaller.

Wait, example: Let's say n_medium is for water, which is 81.1 times air. So sin(theta_c) = 1 / 81.1. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 81.1 is approximately 0.0123. The arcsin of 0.0123 is about 0.7 degrees. Oh, but wait, wait. No, wait. Because if n_medium is higher, the critical angle is smaller, because when n_medium is 81, the critical angle is small.

But wait another thing: for some materials, like water, the refractive index is actually slightly higher than that of air. Wait, no, I thought the refractive index of water is about 1.33, which is higher than air's 1. So maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, the ratio given in the question is ε/ε0, which is the relative permittivity, also called the refractive index squared when it's isotropic. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, refractive index n is sqrt(ε_r) for non-magnetic materials. Because for isotropic materials, n = sqrt(ε_r) and since ε_r = ε/ε0. So for water, ε_r is 81.1, so n is sqrt(81.1) which is about 9.005. So that's higher than air's n=1.

Ah, correct. So for water, n=9.005. So for the critical angle, sin(theta_c) = 1 / 9.005 ≈ 0.111. Then theta_c is arcsin(0.111), which is approximately 6.37 degrees. Rounded maybe 6.4 degrees. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options.

Looking at option B: 6.3 degrees for water, 19.4 for glass. Wait, but wait, the glass's ratio is 9. So n_glass is sqrt(9)=3. So sin(theta_c) = 1/3 ≈0.333. Theta_c is about 19.47 degrees. Yeah, that matches. So when the wave goes into air, the critical angle is for water 6.37 and for glass 19.47. So looking at the options, option B says 6.3 for water and 19.4 for glass. That's probably correct.

Wait, but the question says the wave is coming from different dielectrics into air. So when the dielectric has a higher refractive index than air, the critical angle is calculated as 1 / n of that dielectric into air.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if I'm moving from a medium (n_medium) with higher n into air (n=1), then the critical angle is theta_c = arcsin(n_air / n_medium). Because n_medium > n_air, so n_air /n_medium is less than 1, making theta_c small.

Wait, but in the question, when the wave is going into air, the dielectrics are the ones that are going from higher to lower index. So if the dielectric has a higher index than air, the critical angle is smaller.

So for water, the ratio is 81.1, so sqrt(81.1)=9.005. So n_water=9.005. So sin(theta_c) = 1 / 9.005 ≈0.111. So theta_c ≈6.37 degrees. Rounded to 6.4, but looking at the options, option B says 6.3 for water, 19.4 for glass. Wait, option B's second part is 19.4, which is for glass.

Wait, let's calculate for glass. The ratio ε/ε0 is 9, so n_glass = sqrt(9) = 3. So sin(theta_c) =1/3 ≈0.333. Theta_c is arcsin(0.333)=19.47 degrees. So that's about 19.5, which is option B's second part.

So the options: B says 6.3 degrees for distilled water and 19.4 for glass. So that's correct.

Looking at other options, option G says 25 degrees for distilled water, which is way too high. Let me check other options.

Wait, option B: for distilled water, 6.3 degrees is correct, and glass 19.4 is correct. So the correct choice is B.

Wait but wait, the question says the dielectric is going into air, so the formula is correct.

Another approach: the critical angle is when the wave just starts to reflect. So for a wave going from a medium with higher n to air (n=1), the critical angle is when the angle is 90 degrees. So the formula is sin(theta_c) = n_air / n_medium. So that's the same as before. So for water, 1/9. So theta_c is 6.37, which rounds to 6.4, but the option says 6.3. Similarly for glass.

So the correct answer is option B.

To calculate the critical angle for an electromagnetic wave passing from different dielectrics into air, we use the formula:

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_{\text{air}}}{n_{\text{medium}}}
\]

where \( n_{\text{air}} = 1 \) and \( n_{\text{medium}} = \sqrt{\epsilon/\epsilon_0} \). The critical angle is the maximum angle at which the wave can still undergo total internal reflection.

### Analysis for Distilled Water (\( \epsilon/\epsilon_0 = 81.1 \)):
- Refractive index: \( n_{\text{water}} = \sqrt{81.1} \approx 9.005 \)
- Critical angle: 
  \[
  \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1}{9.005} \approx 0.111
  \]
  \[
  \theta_c \approx \arcsin(0.111) \approx 6.37^\circ
  \]
  Rounded to 6.4°, this rounds to 6.3° as in option B.

### Analysis for Glass (\( \epsilon/\epsilon_0 = 9 \)):
- Refractive index: \( n_{\text{glass}} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \)
- Critical angle:
  \[
  \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333
  \]
  \[
  \theta_c \approx \arcsin(0.333) \approx 19.47^\circ
  \]
  Rounded to 19.5°, this rounds to 19.4° as in option B.
