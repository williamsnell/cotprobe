Alright, so I've got this ring theory question in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about the properties of a ring R and its right ideals.

Okay, the setup: R is a ring with a multiplicative identity. U is a right ideal of R. The definition given is that for any u in U and any r in R, ur is also in U. So, that's what a right ideal is. 

The question says that R has exactly two right ideals, and we need to determine which of the statements I, II, III must be true. The statements are about whether R is commutative, whether it's a division ring, and whether it's infinite. The options are multiple choices, from A to J, each being different combinations of these statements.

Wait, the actual question options are A through J, each representing a different combination. So, the options are:

A: R is a finite ring.
B: R is a ring without a multiplicative identity.
C: II and III only.
D: II only.
E: I and III only.
F: I and II only.
G: None of the above.
H: III only.
I: I only.
J: I, II and III.

So, I need to figure out which of the three statements (I, II, III) must be true if R has exactly two right ideals.

Hmm. Let me recall some ring theory. I remember that the structure of ideals in a ring can tell us a lot about the ring itself. For example, in a simple ring, the only ideals are the zero ideal and the ring itself. But wait, the question says R has exactly two right ideals, not necessarily simple.

Wait, but if a ring has exactly two right ideals, that might imply it's a simple ring. Because a simple ring has no non-trivial two-sided ideals, but here we're talking about right ideals. But wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, a simple ring is one that has no two-sided ideals other than zero and itself. But in this case, the ring R has exactly two right ideals. So, are all right ideals also two-sided? Well, a right ideal is a subset that is closed under multiplication from the right, but not necessarily the left.

Wait, but in general, the ring could have two-sided ideals and possibly some right ideals that aren't two-sided. But if R has exactly two right ideals, maybe it's a division ring? Or perhaps a field.

Wait, let me think about some examples. For instance, consider a simple ring. For example, the ring of n√ón matrices over a field is simple, and it has only two two-sided ideals: zero and the entire ring. So, in that case, the ring would have exactly two right ideals. So, if R is simple, then it has only two right ideals. But wait, R could also have a two-sided ideal that is not a right ideal. Hmm, no, because if a two-sided ideal is also a right ideal, then it's a two-sided ideal, and in such a case, R would have more than two right ideals if it's simple. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, R has exactly two right ideals. So, that could be similar to a division ring. Because in a division ring, the only right ideals are the zero ideal and the entire ring. So, that would mean there are exactly two right ideals. So, statement II says R is a division ring. That would be true. So, statement II is true.

Wait, but what about a field? A field is a commutative ring with a multiplicative identity. All elements except zero have inverses. In a field, the only right ideals are zero and the field itself. So, R would have exactly two right ideals. So, field satisfies II. But statement I says R is commutative. Well, a field is commutative, but a non-commutative division ring is a division ring, but it's not commutative. So, if R has exactly two right ideals, R could be a field, which is a division ring and commutative. But R could also be a non-commutative division ring, which would mean that statement I doesn't have to be true. So, II must be true, but I might not necessarily be.

Let me think again. If R is a field, then it's a commutative ring, so statement I is true. But if R is a division ring that's not commutative, then it's a non-commutative division ring, and it would satisfy that it has exactly two right ideals. So, statement I doesn't have to be true, but statement II does.

So, II is a necessary condition, but I is not necessarily the case.

Now, statement III: R is infinite. The question is, does having exactly two right ideals imply that R is infinite? Or could it be a finite ring with exactly two right ideals?

Wait, for example, a field is an infinite ring. But suppose R is a finite division ring. Wait, according to Wedderburn's little theorem, finite division rings are fields. So, a finite division ring must be a finite field. But a finite field has infinite elements. Wait, no, a finite field has a finite number of elements, but that's just the size. Wait, no, a finite field is finite in size, but it has a finite number of elements, like GF(p^n) where p is prime and n is a positive integer.

Wait, but all finite division rings are finite fields. So, if R is a finite division ring, then it's a field, and thus it's commutative. But in that case, R would have two right ideals: zero and itself. So, R could be a finite division ring, which is a field, so it has exactly two right ideals. So, statement III would not have to be true because R could be finite with exactly two right ideals, as in a finite field.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. If R is a finite ring, it can have more than two right ideals. For example, the ring of n x n matrices over a finite field is a ring with more than two right ideals. Or perhaps, a finite field has only two right ideals, which is what we're considering.

Wait, so R could be a finite field, which is a division ring with exactly two right ideals, so R could be finite. So, statement III (R is infinite) isn't necessarily true. So, statement III doesn't have to be true.

Wait, but the question is which statements must be true. So, if R has exactly two right ideals, is R necessarily infinite? No, because R could be a finite division ring, which is a field, which is finite. So, III doesn't have to be true.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let me think about the possibilities. If R is a division ring with exactly two right ideals, then R is a field. But a field is infinite (like GF(p)). Wait, no, no. GF(p) is a finite field, which is a division ring (and a field) and has exactly two right ideals. So, in that case, R is finite. So, in that case, statement III (R is infinite) is false, because R is finite.

Wait, but wait. If R is a division ring with exactly two right ideals, then it's a field, which is finite. So, R could be finite. So, statement III would not necessarily be true, because R could be finite.

Wait, but earlier I thought that statement II is true, because R would have exactly two right ideals, implying it's a division ring. But in the case where R is a finite field, which is a division ring, it satisfies statement II. But in the case where R is an infinite division ring, it also satisfies statement II, and it's infinite.

So, statement II is necessary because if R has exactly two right ideals, it must be a division ring, regardless of whether it's finite or infinite. Because if it's a division ring, it can only have two right ideals. So, II is always true.

Now, let's go back to statement I. Statement I says R is commutative. But as I thought earlier, a field is a commutative division ring, but a non-commutative division ring is a division ring that's not commutative. So, R could be a finite field (which is commutative) or a non-commutative division ring (non-commutative). So, R may not be commutative. So, statement I isn't necessarily true. So, statement I doesn't have to be true.

So, II is true, I isn't. So, option D says II only. So, that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait. The original question states that R has exactly two right ideals. So, if R is a field, it's definitely satisfies II and I (if it's commutative). But if R is a non-commutative division ring, then it's not commutative (I is false), and it's a division ring (II is true). So, in that case, II is true but I is false.

So, the correct statements are II only. So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me think again about the structure of rings with exactly two right ideals. If R is a ring with exactly two right ideals, what can R look like? Well, a ring that is a field has exactly two right ideals. A finite field is a field, which has two right ideals. But a non-commutative division ring could also satisfy that condition, but such rings are known to be finite, and they are fields.

Wait, but wait, in non-commutative division rings, are they finite? According to Wedderburn's theorem, every finite division ring is a field, but non-commutative division rings are not finite. So, if a division ring is finite, it's commutative. So, if a ring has exactly two right ideals, and it's a division ring, then it must be a finite field, which is commutative. So, in that case, R is commutative.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about it again. If R is a division ring with exactly two right ideals, then R is a field, which is commutative. So, in that case, statement I (commutative) is true. But if R is a non-commutative division ring, it would have more than two right ideals, right? Or perhaps not. Wait, no, non-commutative division rings are actually not possible as finite rings. So, let me clarify.

Wait, Wedderburn's theorem says that every finite division ring is a field. So, if a finite ring is a division ring, it's commutative. So, any finite division ring is a finite field, which is commutative. So, if R is a finite ring and has exactly two right ideals, it's a finite field, which is commutative. So, in that case, statement I is true.

But wait, the question is about a ring R with exactly two right ideals. So, R could be a finite field (so, statement I and II are true, III is false). Or, R could be an infinite division ring, which is a field, and in that case, it's commutative, so statement I would be true, II is true. But wait, no, wait. If R is an infinite division ring, it's a field, which is commutative. So, statement I would be true. But in that case, R is infinite, but statement III would be false because R is infinite, but I is true.

Wait, but the question is which of the statements must be true, given that R has exactly two right ideals. So, if R is a finite field, then I and II are true, but III is false. If R is an infinite field (a division ring), then R is a field, so II is true, I is true, but III is false. So, in both cases, II is true and I is true, but R could be finite or infinite.

Wait, but wait, let me think about whether R could be a non-commutative division ring. No, because non-commutative division rings are infinite, and finite non-commutative division rings don't exist. So, if a ring R has exactly two right ideals, and it's a division ring, then R must be a finite field (commutative), which would make I true. Or, R could be an infinite division ring (which is a field), which would also make it commutative, making I true. So, in either case, I is true.

Wait, but wait, is there any other possibility? Like, if R is a ring which is not a division ring but still has exactly two right ideals. Let's think: Suppose R is a local ring with a unique maximal ideal. Then, the right ideals would be the two-sided ideals, but that might not necessarily give exactly two right ideals. Wait, no, perhaps in some cases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the ring R with exactly two right ideals. So, the right ideals are R itself and another ideal. Let's call this other ideal I. So, I is a right ideal, and R is the ring.

Now, since I is a right ideal, every element of I multiplied on the right by any element of R remains in I. Now, if I is the only non-trivial right ideal, then perhaps R is a simple ring. Wait, but a simple ring is one with no two-sided ideals other than zero and itself. But in this case, we're only considering right ideals. So, perhaps R has exactly two right ideals, which are R and I, and no others.

Wait, but for a ring to have exactly two right ideals, it must be such that the ring is either a field (if it's a commutative ring) or a division ring with exactly two right ideals.

Wait, another thought. If a ring has exactly two right ideals, then it's a simple ring because right ideals are only R and I. But in that case, if it's simple, it must be a simple Artinian ring, so according to Artin-Wedderburn, it's commutative. So, in that case, a simple ring with exactly two right ideals would be a field, which is commutative. So, I is commutative, II is division ring with exactly two right ideals, so yes, it's a field, which is commutative. So, statement I is true.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if R is a simple Artinian ring, then it's a matrix ring over a division ring. But for R to have exactly two right ideals, the matrix ring must only have the zero matrix and R itself as right ideals. But for matrix rings, the right ideals are the sets of matrices of lower rank. So, for example, for M_n(D), where D is a division ring, there are infinitely many right ideals, each corresponding to a different size of matrices. So, for R to have exactly two right ideals, it must be a ring with very few right ideals, which only happens if it's a field.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about R being a division ring with exactly two right ideals. Then, R is a field, which is commutative. So, statement I is true. So, if R is a field (which it is because it's a division ring with exactly two right ideals), then it's commutative. So, statement I is true.

Wait, but wait. If R is a finite division ring, which is a field, then it is commutative. So, statement I is true. But if R is an infinite division ring (which is a field), it's also commutative. So, in either case, statement I is true.

Wait, but earlier I thought that non-commutative division rings can't be finite. So, if R is a division ring and has exactly two right ideals, then R is a finite field, so it's commutative. So, statement I is true.

Wait, then statement II is true (because it's a division ring with two right ideals), statement I is true, but III (infinite) is not necessarily true, because R could be finite.

Wait, but earlier I thought that non-commutative division rings are non-finite, but no, according to Wedderburn's theorem, finite division rings are fields. So, any finite division ring is a field. So, if R is a finite division ring, it's a finite field, which is commutative. So, statement I is true.

Wait, but wait a minute. If R is a ring with exactly two right ideals, then R must be a division ring. Because in a non-commutative division ring, which is finite, it's a field, which is commutative. So, R must be a division ring, which is a field, which is commutative. So, statement I is true.

Wait, so then III says R is infinite. But R could be a finite field, which is a division ring with exactly two right ideals, so R is finite. So, statement III is not necessarily true. So, statement III is not always true.

So, putting it all together, statements I and II are correct, and statement III is not necessarily correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that II must be true, but let me re-express. The question says that R has exactly two right ideals. So, any ring with exactly two right ideals must be a division ring. Because if a ring has only two right ideals, then it can't have any two-sided ideals except zero and itself. So, R is a division ring.

Wait, but if R is a division ring with exactly two right ideals, then it's a field, which is commutative. So, statement I is true, statement II is true, and statement III is not necessarily true because R could be finite.

So, in that case, statements I and II are true, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that statement III says R is infinite. So, if R is a finite division ring (which is a field), then III would be false. So, statement III is not necessarily true.

So, the correct answer is option D: II only.

Wait, but wait. Let me go through a concrete example. Let's take R as a field, like GF(p). It's a division ring, so it has exactly two right ideals: zero and R itself. So, in this case, statement I is true (because it's commutative), II is true (because it's a division ring), and III is false (since it's finite). So, if R is a field, then statement III is false.

Now, what if R is an infinite field? For example, GF(p^‚àû), which is a field. It has exactly two right ideals: zero and itself. So, in this case, I is true, II is true, but III is also true.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in a division ring with exactly two right ideals, R must be a finite field. But is that the case? Let me think again about the structure. If R is a division ring with exactly two right ideals, then those are R itself and zero. So, R must be a field. But can a division ring be infinite? Yes, according to Wedderburn's theorem. So, an infinite division ring is a field, which is a field.

So, in all cases where R has exactly two right ideals, it's a field, which is commutative. So, I is true, II is true, III is not necessarily true.

So, the correct statements are I and II, which is option D.

Wait, but another angle: Suppose R is a ring with exactly two right ideals. Then, R is a division ring. Because if R is a non-commutative division ring, which is finite, it's a field, which is commutative. So, R must be a field. So, in all cases, R is a field, which is a division ring.

So, statement I is true (because it's commutative), statement II is true (because it's a division ring), and statement III is not necessarily true (since R could be finite).

So, the correct answer is option D: II only.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the answer was D. But let me think about the options again. The options are:

I. R is commutative.

II. R is a division ring.

III. R is infinite.

So, if the ring R is a field, then it's a division ring, which is commutative, and it's infinite. But R could also be a finite field, which is a division ring, commutative, and finite.

So, in any case, statement I is true because it's a field (commutative). Statement II is true because it's a division ring. Statement III is not necessarily true because R could be finite.

Wait, but wait. The question is whether R is infinite. So, if R is a finite field, then III is false. So, the statement III is not necessarily true.

So, the correct statements are I and II, so the answer is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the answer was D. So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

So, to recap: If R has exactly two right ideals, then R is a division ring (so II is true), and it's commutative (so I is true). However, R could be a finite field, which would make III false. So, the correct answer is that II is true, and I and III are not necessarily true.

So, the answer would be D.

The question asks about a ring \( R \) with exactly two right ideals and whether certain statements (I, II, III) must be true.

### Analysis

1. **Statement II: \( R \) is a division ring.**
   - A ring \( R \) with exactly two right ideals must be a division ring. This is because a division ring has only two right ideals (zero and itself), matching the condition given. Therefore, **II is true**.

2. **Statement I: \( R \) is commutative.**
   - A division ring with exactly two right ideals is necessarily commutative. This follows from Wedderburn's little theorem, which states that every finite division ring is a field. Fields are commutative, so \( R \) must be commutative. Therefore, **I is true**.

3. **Statement III: \( R \) is infinite.**
   - A finite division ring (which is a field) is commutative. For example, \( \text{GF}(p) \), a finite field, is commutative but finite. Thus, \( R \) could be finite, making III **false**.

### Conclusion

The statements that must be true are I and II. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. II only**.
