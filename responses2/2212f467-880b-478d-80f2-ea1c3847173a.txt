Okay, so I have this question about the origins of Lassa病毒 and Ebolavirus, right? I remember that these are both viruses that have been spreading in Africa. I think they're called Emergent viruses, so they come from outside their usual hosts. 

Hmm, the question is asking about their origin. The options are various animals and plants. Let me think. I remember that these viruses are often spread by vectors, like mosquitoes, and they can come from various hosts. 

Wait, I think Lassa virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. But where do mosquitoes come from? Maybe from the environment or other species. Oh! I remember something about primates. There's a study where primates, like monkeys, birds, and rhinos, have been shown to carry these viruses. So when primates come into contact with mosquitoes, they can transmit the virus. 

Ebola is similar. I think both Lassa and Ebolavirus are transmitted by mosquitoes, and their origin is likely from primates. So the answer should be C: Primates, right? I'm pretty sure that's it.

The correct answer is C: Primates.
