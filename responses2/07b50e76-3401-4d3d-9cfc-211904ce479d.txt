Okay, let's see. I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about calculating ΔG for a process where nitrogen gas expands isothermally. Hmm, I remember that for an ideal gas, there are certain equations and formulas that apply here.

The problem states: 2.5 mmol of N₂ (g) occupies 42 cm³ at 300 K and expands isothermally to 600 cm³. I need to find ΔG. The options are A to J, each with a different value in joules.

Wait, right, ΔG for an isothermal process. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, wait. I think I need to recall the correct formula for Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) in an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas.

I remember that for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is equal to the maximum non-expansion work that can be done. Alternatively, another formula I recall is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps it's the change in Gibbs free energy for an ideal gas during an expansion or compression. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between ΔG and the work done. Oh, right, for an isothermal reversible expansion, the Gibbs free energy change is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1) but I'm not sure which one is correct.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. For an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) during an isothermal process can be calculated using the formula: ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) or ΔG = nRT ln(V1/V2) depending on whether it's expansion or compression. Wait, no, I think it's ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) for expansion. Because when a gas expands, the pressure decreases, so P2 is less than P1, making ln(P2/P1) negative, implying that ΔG is negative, which makes sense because expansion is exothermic in some processes.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again. Oh, right, for an isothermal process, the Gibbs free energy change is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, another version I've seen is ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1), but that would only be if the process is at constant volume, which isn't isothermal. So maybe the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1).

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: the change in Gibbs free energy for an ideal gas during an isothermal process can be calculated using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). Alternatively, since PV = nRT, and at constant temperature, P1 V1 = P2 V2. So, P1/P2 = V2/V1. Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(P1/P2) = ln(V2/V1). So, ln(P2/P1) would be - ln(V2/V1). So, substituting into the ΔG formula: ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) = nRT (- ln(V2/V1)) = -nRT ln(V2/V1). Hmm, but wait, then ΔG would be negative if V increases, because ln(V2/V1) is positive when V2 > V1. So, if V increases, then V2/V1 >1, so ln is positive, and ΔG is negative.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach this with the data given.

So, given:

- n (moles of N₂) = 2.5 mmol. Wait, that's 0.0025 mol, right? Because 1 mmol is 0.001 mol. So 2.5 mmol is 0.0025 mol.

- Initial volume V1 = 42 cm³, which is 0.042 L (since 1 L is 1000 cm³). Wait, wait, wait, let me confirm units. Oh wait, 42 cm³ is 0.042 liters, yes.

- Final volume V2 = 600 cm³ = 0.6 L.

- Temperature T = 300 K.

Wait, the process is isothermal, so T is constant. So, the formula can be rewritten.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to calculate ΔG using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the signs. Let's proceed.

Alternatively, I remember that for an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy change is given by:

ΔG = VΔP - nRT ln(P), but that seems more complicated. Hmm. Alternatively, another approach: The Gibbs free energy change for an ideal gas during expansion can be calculated using the formula:

ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1)

Alternatively, another formula I've seen is:

ΔG = nRT ln(V1/V2) but with a negative sign. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the sign.

Wait, let's think about the signs. For expansion, the pressure decreases, so P2 < P1. Therefore, ln(P2/P1) is negative. So, ΔG would be negative, which makes sense because expansion is an exothermic process, releasing energy.

Alternatively, another way to calculate it is using the formula for expansion at constant temperature. Another formula I remember is:

ΔG = VΔP - nRT ln(P)

Wait, but I'm not recalling the exact formula. Wait, perhaps I should go back to the fundamental thermodynamic equation.

The Gibbs free energy change is given by:

ΔG = H - TS

But H is enthalpy, which is U + PV. So, ΔG = (U + PV) - T S.

But for an ideal gas, the internal energy U depends only on temperature, so if the process is at constant temperature, the change in U is zero. So, ΔG = PV - T S. But for an ideal gas, S is a function of T and V. Hmm, this might complicate things, but perhaps I'm better off using the formula that relates to pressure and volume.

Wait, another approach: For an ideal gas, the change in Gibbs free energy during a process can be calculated using the formula:

ΔG = nR T ln(P2 / P1) + n R T ln(V1 / V2) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P2 / P1). Let me see.

Wait, but wait, another approach: Let's calculate the work done and then find ΔG. But I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Alternatively, considering that for an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy change can be expressed as:

ΔG = VΔP - nRT ln(P)

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, another approach: The Gibbs free energy change for a process is the maximum non-expansion work obtainable. But that's more for determining maximum work, which might not be necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I should stick with the formula for the Gibbs free energy change in an isothermal process for an ideal gas.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the formula again. For an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the formula for ΔG is:

ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1)

But wait, another formula I've seen is ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln P. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of pressure and volume. Let me recall that for an ideal gas, PV = nRT. So, at constant T, P1 V1 = P2 V2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find ΔG. Let me think about the formula for the Gibbs free energy change for an isothermal process. I think it's given by:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

But for an ideal gas, ΔH is n R T ln(V2/V1) or something like that. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let me look for a better approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the change in Gibbs free energy for an ideal gas during an isothermal process is:

ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1)

Wait, but earlier I thought that when P2 < P1, ln(P2/P1) is negative, so ΔG would be negative, which makes sense because expansion releases energy.

Wait, but wait, another formula I've seen is ΔG = VΔP - n R T ln(P), but I'm not sure.

Hm. Let me think again. I think for an ideal gas, the change in Gibbs free energy during an isothermal process can be found using:

ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1)

Wait, but let's verify. If the process is isothermal, then T is constant. So, the formula would involve the change in pressure.

Wait, but wait, let's think about expansion in terms of pressure. Since the process is isothermal, the relation PV = nRT holds. So, P1 V1 = P2 V2.

We can express P2 in terms of P1 and V ratio.

Given that V2 > V1 (because 600 cm³ > 42 cm³), P2 must be less than P1.

So, let's compute ln(P2 / P1) = ln( (nRT/V2) / (nRT/V1) ) ) = ln( V1 / V2 )

Wait, substituting into the formula, ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1) = n R T ln(V1 / V2)

But wait, no, because when I substitute P2 = (nRT)/V2, and P1 = (nRT)/V1, so P2/P1 = (V1)/(V2).

So,

ΔG = n R T ln( V1 / V2 )

Alternatively, this can be written as:

ΔG = -n R T ln( V2 / V1 )

But wait, let me compute that.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

n = 2.5 mmol = 0.0025 mol.

R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T is 300 K.

V1 = 42 cm³ = 0.042 L.

V2 = 600 cm³ = 0.6 L.

So, V2/V1 = 0.6 / 0.042 ≈ 14.2857.

So, ln(V2/V1) = ln(14.2857) ≈ 2.666.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly. Let me calculate 0.6 divided by 0.042.

0.6 / 0.042 = (600 / 42) = (600 ÷ 42) = 14.2857. So, ln(14.2857) is approximately 2.666.

But wait, V2 is larger than V1, so V2/V1 is greater than 1, so ln would be positive. Thus, ΔG would be negative, because it's n R T ln(V1/V2) = n R T ln(1/14.2857) = negative.

Wait, wait, no. Let me go back. Oh wait, wait, the formula I derived is:

ΔG = n R T ln(V1/V2)

But V1 is 42 cm³, V2 is 600 cm³. So, V1/V2 = 0.042 / 0.6 = 0.07. So, ln(0.07) is negative. So, ΔG would be negative, which makes sense because expansion releases energy.

So, let me compute this value.

n = 0.0025 mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 300 K.

ln(V1/V2) = ln(0.042 / 0.6) = ln(0.07) ≈ -2.659.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.07). Hmm, I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.2) is about -1.609, ln(0.07) would be even more negative. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.07 is 7e-2. Let's think in terms of calculator: ln(0.07) ≈ -2.659. Let me confirm that on a calculator.

Yes, I think ln(0.07) is approximately -2.659.

So, ΔG = 0.0025 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K * (-2.659)

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the formula again. I derived that ΔG = n R T ln(V1/V2). So, with V1/V2 = 0.07, ln is negative, so ΔG is negative.

So, substituting the numbers:

0.0025 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K * (-2.659) =

First compute 0.0025 * 8.314 = 0.020785.

Multiply by 300: 0.020785 * 300 = 6.2355.

Multiply by -2.659: 6.2355 * (-2.659) ≈ -16.59 J.

So, ΔG ≈ -16.59 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: -5 J, or F: -22 J, or G: -12 J, H: -30 J, I: 0 J, J: -17 J.

Wait, -16.59 is close to -17 J. So option J would be -17 J.

But wait, wait another moment. Did I get the formula right? Because earlier, I thought that ΔG = n R T ln(P2/P1), which in this case would have P2 < P1, so ln(P2/P1) is negative. So, ΔG would be negative.

Wait, but wait, another approach: let's compute the work done during expansion or compression, and then find ΔG from that. The work done at constant temperature is given by:

w = -n R T ln(V2/V1)

Which is the same as w = n R T ln(V1/V2) but with a negative sign.

Wait, so work done is negative when the system does work on the surroundings. So, the formula for work done at constant temperature is:

w = -n R T ln(V2/V1)

But then, since the first law is ΔU = q + w, and for ideal gases, ΔU = n C_v ΔT. But since T is constant, ΔT =0, so ΔU =0. So, q = -w.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful for finding ΔG. Because I know that ΔG = q_p - T ΔS, where q_p is the heat at constant pressure.

Wait, but for an ideal gas, ΔH = n C_p ΔT. Since T is constant, ΔH = n C_p ΔT = 0, so ΔH =0. Then ΔG = ΔH - T ΔS.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: For an ideal gas undergoing a process, ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula I derived earlier. Let me recheck my earlier calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me start again.

The formula for ΔG in an isothermal process is:

ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1).

Wait, but wait, if P2 is less than P1, then P2/P1 is less than 1, and ln is negative. So, ΔG is negative.

Alternatively, another formula I found in some references: For an ideal gas, the change in Gibbs free energy is given by ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1) if the process is at constant temperature and volume? No, that doesn't make sense. I think I need to get this right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it via the thermodynamic potentials. For an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy is given by:

G = U + PV.

Since U is a function of temperature only (for ideal gases), and PV is nRT, which is a function of temperature and volume.

Wait, but since the process is isothermal, T is constant. So, G depends on P and V. But in this case, the process is expansion, so V increases. Let me think about how G changes.

Wait, another formula for Gibbs free energy change is:

ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P)

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps thinking about the change in G for expansion.

Wait, let me think about the formula for an ideal gas during expansion.

Another approach: For an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the change in Gibbs free energy can be found using:

ΔG = VΔP - n R T ln(P)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps think of the work done.

Wait, the work done in an isothermal process for an ideal gas is given by:

w = -n R T ln(V2 / V1)

But wait, wait, the work done by the system (expansion) is positive, so perhaps the formula is:

w = n R T ln(V1 / V2)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the formula for Gibbs free energy in an isothermal process.

Wait, another approach: Since the process is isothermal, and the ideal gas law holds, perhaps using the formula:

ΔG = (V2 - V1) ΔP - n R T ln(P)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P), where V is the volume at pressure P. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should try to calculate the work done during the expansion and then find ΔG from that. Wait, but I'm not sure how to get ΔG from the work done.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for Gibbs free energy change in terms of pressure and volume. Wait, another approach: The Gibbs free energy change for an ideal gas is given by:

ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1) + n R T ln(V1 / V2) 

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the formula as ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P) + ... ?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think differently. Since the process is isothermal, the Gibbs free energy change can be determined using the formula:

ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P)

Wait, but perhaps I should look for a formula that relates the change in Gibbs free energy to the pressure change and volume.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the work done during the process and then find ΔG using the first law.

Wait, the work done by the system during an expansion is W = -P_ext ΔV, but since the external pressure is changing, it's difficult. Alternatively, for an isothermal process, the work done is:

W = n R T ln(V1 / V2)

Wait, but that's the work done by the system. So, if the system is expanding (V2 > V1), then W is negative, which makes sense because the system is doing work on the surroundings.

But wait, Gibbs free energy change is given by ΔG = W + Q, where Q is the heat exchanged. But for an isothermal process, Q = T ΔS. Also, for an ideal gas, ΔS = n C_v ln(T/T) + ... but since T is constant, ΔS is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Because for an ideal gas, the entropy change is zero at constant temperature, but that's only for a reversible process. But in reality, when the gas is expanding isothermally, the entropy change is positive because the system is increasing disorder.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on another approach. Let me think back to the formula I used earlier.

I had:

ΔG = n R T ln(V1 / V2 )

But wait, let me compute that again.

n = 0.0025 mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 300 K.

V1 = 42 cm³.

V2 = 600 cm³.

So, V1 / V2 = 42 / 600 = 0.07.

So, ln(0.07) ≈ -2.659.

So, ΔG = 0.0025 * 8.314 * 300 * (-2.659)

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, compute 0.0025 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 0.020785 J/K.

Then, multiply by 300 K: 0.020785 J/K * 300 K = 6.2355 J.

Then, multiply by (-2.659): 6.2355 J * (-2.659) ≈ -16.59 J.

So, ΔG ≈ -16.59 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: -17 J.

But wait, let me double-check the formula.

Earlier, I thought that ΔG = n R T ln(V1 / V2). But wait, another formula I came across is ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P).

Wait, but let me think about the formula again. Let me consider that for an ideal gas expanding at constant temperature, the change in Gibbs free energy is:

ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P)

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔG = V ΔP - n R T ln(P)

But I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the first law of thermodynamics.

The first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done by the system.

For an ideal gas, ΔU = n C_v ΔT. Since T is constant, ΔU =0.

So, q = -w.

So, q = -w.

The work done by the system is w = -P_ext ΔV, but if the external pressure is constant, then w = -P ΔV. However, for an ideal gas, the external pressure is not necessarily constant, so this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the work done in terms of pressure change.

Wait, another approach: The work done during the expansion is W = n R T ln(V1 / V2).

Wait, but that's the same as the formula I used earlier.

So, perhaps the correct formula is indeed ΔG = n R T ln(V1/V2).

Wait, but in that case, for the given values, the calculation gives ΔG ≈ -16.59 J, which is closest to option J: -17 J.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes when you're dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, let me compute 0.0025 * 8.314 * 300 * ln(0.07).

Computing 0.0025 * 8.314:

0.0025 * 8 = 0.02, 0.0025 * 0.314 = 0.000785, so total is 0.020785.

Multiply by 300:

0.020785 * 300 = 6.2355.

Multiply by ln(0.07), which is approximately -2.659.

So, 6.2355 * (-2.659) = ?

6 * (-2.659) = -15.954.

0.2355 * (-2.659) ≈ -0.623.

So, total is approximately -16.577 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So, ΔG ≈ -16.58 J.

Looking at the options:

A. -5 J

B. -10 J

C. -15 J

D. -20 J

E. -25 J

F. -22 J

G. -12 J

H. -30 J

I. 0 J

J. -17 J

So, the closest option is J: -17 J, which is -17 J, very close to our calculation of -16.58 J.

Wait, but why is there a difference? Because in the problem statement, the initial and final volumes are given as 42 cm³ and 600 cm³. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of ln(0.07).

Wait, ln(0.07) is the natural logarithm of 0.07. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, ln(0.07) ≈ -2.659.

So, the calculation is correct.

Hmm. So, the correct answer should be option J: -17 J.

Wait, but I just thought, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another approach.

Wait, another formula I've found in some references is:

ΔG = VΔP - n R T ln(P)

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔG = VΔP - n R T ln(P)

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the change in Gibbs free energy as:

ΔG = VΔP - n R T ln(P)

But without knowing the correct formula, perhaps it's better to think that I might have made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔG = n R T ln(P2 / P1) = n R T ln(V1 / V2) [since P2 = P1 (V1/V2)].

Wait, but then:

n = 0.0025 mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 300 K.

V1 = 42 cm³.

So, ln(V1/V2) = ln(42/600) = ln(0.07) ≈ -2.659.

Thus, ΔG = 0.0025 * 8.314 * 300 * (-2.659) ≈ -16.58 J.

Therefore, the correct answer is J: -17 J.

But wait, wait a moment. Let me make sure that I didn't confuse the formula for the correct sign.

Wait, because for expansion, the system is doing work on the surroundings, so the work is negative. But in terms of Gibbs free energy, perhaps the formula is negative because expansion is work done by the system.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the Gibbs free energy change is negative, which makes sense because expansion releases energy, and Gibbs free energy is a state function, so it depends on the path.

Wait, or perhaps not. Because Gibbs free energy is a state function, so its value depends only on the initial and final states, not the path taken. But in this problem, the process is isothermal expansion, so perhaps the value is negative, which matches our calculation.

So, I think the correct answer is J: -17 J.
</think>

To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the process, we use the formula for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process:

\[
\Delta G = n R T \ln\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- \( n = 0.0025 \, \text{mol} \) (converted from 2.5 mmol)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)
- \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- \( V_1 = 42 \, \text{cm}^3 \)
- \( V_2 = 600 \, \text{cm}^3 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the ratio \( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \)
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{42}{600} = 0.07
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \ln\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right) \)
\[
\ln(0.07) \approx -2.659
\]

### Step 4: Substitute into the formula for ΔG
\[
\Delta G = (0.0025) \cdot (8.314) \cdot (300) \cdot (-2.659)
\]

### Step 5: Perform the calculations
1. Compute \( 0.0025 \cdot 8.314 \):
   \[
   0.0025 \cdot 8.314 = 0.020785
   \]

2. Multiply by \( 300 \):
   \[
   0.020785 \cdot 300 = 6.2355
   \]

3. Multiply by \( -2.659 \):
   \[
   6.2355 \cdot (-2.659) \approx -16.58 \, \text{J}
   \]

### Step 6: Match the result with the options
The closest option to \( \Delta G \approx -16.58 \, \text{J} \) is **J: -17 J**.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{J}
\]
