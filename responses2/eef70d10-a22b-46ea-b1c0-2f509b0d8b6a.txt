Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area between two curves, y = (sin x + cos x)^4 and y = (sin x - cos x)^4, between x = 0 and the next point where they intersect. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out the smallest positive value of x where they intersect after x = 0, and then compute the area between them over that interval.

First, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

y1 = (sin x + cos x)^4

y2 = (sin x - cos x)^4

I remember that when two curves intersect, their y-values are equal at that point. So, I can set y1 = y2 and solve for x.

So, setting them equal:

(sin x + cos x)^4 = (sin x - cos x)^4

Hmm. Since both sides are raised to the 4th power, they're both non-negative, so taking the 4th root on both sides would give |sin x + cos x| = |sin x - cos x|.

But wait, actually, since both sides are non-negative, if a^4 = b^4, then |a| = |b|, so yeah, that's correct.

So, |sin x + cos x| = |sin x - cos x|

Now, I need to find all x where this holds. The smallest positive x after x=0.

Let me think about the cases when |sin x + cos x| equals |sin x - cos x|. Let me square both sides to remove the absolute value, maybe that's easier.

So, (sin x + cos x)^2 = (sin x - cos x)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left side: sin²x + 2 sinx cosx + cos²x

Right side: sin²x - 2 sinx cosx + cos²x

Subtract right side from left side:

(sin²x + 2 sinx cosx + cos²x) - (sin²x - 2 sinx cosx + cos²x) = 0

Simplify:

sin²x + 2 sinx cosx + cos²x - sin²x + 2 sinx cosx - cos²x = 0

Simplify terms:

The sin²x and -sin²x cancel.

The cos²x and -cos²x cancel.

Left with: 2 sinx cosx + 2 sinx cosx = 0

So 4 sinx cosx = 0

Which means either sinx = 0 or cosx = 0.

So, sinx = 0 implies x = nπ, where n is integer.

cosx = 0 implies x = (π/2) + nπ, where n is integer.

So, the solutions are x = nπ/2, where n is integer.

But we're looking for the smallest positive x after x=0, other than x=0 itself. So the next possible point is x= π/2, because x=0 is already given.

Wait, let me double-check this. Is x=π/2 the next positive point where they intersect?

Because at x=0, both curves meet. Then, let's see what happens at x=π/2. Let's compute y1 and y2 at π/2.

sin(π/2) = 1, cos(π/2) = 0.

So y1 = (1 + 0)^4 = 1^4 = 1.

y2 = (1 - 0)^4 = 1^4 = 1.

So, they meet again at x=π/2. So that's the point a.

So, a = π/2.

Wait, but I should check if there's a smaller positive x beyond 0 where they intersect. Because sometimes, for equations like this, even if sinx =0 or cosx=0, maybe they intersect again at a smaller x.

Wait, for x=π/2, yes, they meet. What about x=π/4? Let me compute both functions at x=π/4.

sin(π/4) = √2/2, cos(π/4) = √2/2.

So y1 = (√2/2 + √2/2)^4 = (√2)^4 = (2)^(2) = 4.

y2 = (√2/2 - √2/2)^4 = 0^4 = 0.

So at x=π/4, they don't meet.

What about x= π/3?

sin(π/3)=√3/2, cos(π/3)=1/2.

So y1 = (√3/2 + 1/2)^4. Let's compute that:

√3/2 ≈ 0.866, 1/2 = 0.5, so sum ≈ 1.366. 1.366^4 ≈ 3.41

y2 = (√3/2 - 1/2)^4. √3/2 -1/2 ≈ 0.366. 0.366^4 ≈ 0.017

So they don't meet.

What about x= π/6?

sin(π/6)=1/2, cos(π/6)=√3/2.

y1 = (1/2 + √3/2)^4. Let's compute (approx) (0.5 + 0.866)=1.366, 1.366^4≈3.41

y2 = (1/2 - √3/2)^4. That's (0.5 - 0.866)= -0.366, but since we're to the 4th power, it's positive, so (0.366)^4≈0.017.

So again, they don't meet.

Therefore, the next intersection after x=0 is at x=π/2.

So a=π/2.

Now, I need to find the area between the curves from x=0 to x=π/2.

So, the area would be the integral from 0 to π/2 of |y1 - y2| dx.

But since y1 and y2 are both non-negative and we know at x=0, they are equal, and after that, which one is on top?

At x=0, both are 1, as we saw.

At x=π/2, both are 1.

Let me check the behavior in between. Let me pick x=π/4.

At x=π/4, y1=4, y2=0, so y1 is above.

Similarly, let me check at x=π/3. y1 is ~3.41, y2 is ~0.017; so y1 is above.

Wait, so from 0 to π/2, y1 is always above y2?

Wait, let me pick another point, say x=π/6.

y1 is (0.5 + √3/2)^4 ≈ (0.5+0.866)^4≈1.366^4≈3.41.

y2 is (0.5 - √3/2)^4≈(-0.366)^4≈0.017.

So y1 is much larger.

So, it seems that y1 is always above y2 in the interval [0, π/2], so the area is the integral of y1 - y2 from 0 to π/2.

So, compute A = ∫ (y1 - y2) dx from 0 to π/2.

Which is ∫ [(sinx + cosx)^4 - (sinx - cosx)^4] dx from 0 to π/2.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities to simplify (sinx + cosx)^4 and (sinx - cosx)^4.

Let me consider expanding both expressions.

First, (sinx + cosx)^4.

Using binomial expansion:

= (sinx)^4 + 4 (sinx)^3 (cosx) + 6 (sinx)^2 (cosx)^2 + 4 (sinx)(cosx)^3 + (cosx)^4

Similarly, (sinx - cosx)^4 = (sinx)^4 - 4 (sinx)^3 (cosx) + 6 (sinx)^2 (cosx)^2 - 4 sinx (cosx)^3 + (cosx)^4

Now, subtract (sinx - cosx)^4 from (sinx + cosx)^4.

So, (sinx + cosx)^4 - (sinx - cosx)^4 = [terms] - [terms] = 

Looking term by term:

The (sinx)^4 and (cosx)^4 terms cancel.

The 4 (sinx)^3 (cosx) term in the first expression is subtracted by (-4 (sinx)^3 (cosx)), so 4 + 4 = 8 (sinx)^3 (cosx)

Similarly, 6 (sinx)^2 (cosx)^2 remains the same.

The 4 sinx (cosx)^3 term in the first expression minus (-4 sinx (cosx)^3) gives 4 + 4 = 8 sinx (cosx)^3.

So overall:

= 8 (sinx)^3 (cosx) + 8 sinx (cosx)^3 + 6 (sinx)^2 (cosx)^2

So, the integrand simplifies to 8 sin³x cosx + 8 sinx cos³x + 6 sin²x cos²x.

Hmm, maybe this can be simplified more.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me think about using substitution for the integral.

But before that, perhaps using trigonometric identities to make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe notice that:

Let me factor the expression:

8 sin³x cosx + 8 sinx cos³x + 6 sin²x cos²x

I can factor 2 sinx cosx from the first two terms:

2 sinx cosx (4 sin²x + 4 cos²x) + 6 sin²x cos²x.

But since sin²x + cos²x =1, so 4 sin²x +4 cos²x =4(sin²x + cos²x)=4*1=4.

So that becomes:

2 sinx cosx *4 +6 sin²x cos²x = 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x.

So, the integrand is now 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x.

That's better.

So, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x ) dx, from 0 to π/2.

Let me split this into two integrals:

A = 8 ∫ sinx cosx dx + 6 ∫ sin²x cos²x dx, from 0 to π/2.

Let me solve each integral separately.

First integral: 8 ∫ sinx cosx dx.

Let me make substitution u = sinx, then du = cosx dx.

So, ∫ sinx cosx dx = ∫ u du = (1/2) u² + C = (1/2) sin²x + C.

So, evaluating from 0 to π/2:

At π/2: sin²(π/2)=1, so 1/2.

At 0: sin²(0)=0, so 0.

Thus, the first integral is 8*(1/2 -0)=8*(1/2)=4.

Second integral: 6 ∫ sin²x cos²x dx, from 0 to π/2.

Hmm, that's a bit more complicated. Maybe express sin^2 x cos^2 x in terms of multiple angles.

I recall that sin²x cos²x can be written as (1/4) sin²(2x). Because sin(2x)=2 sinx cosx, so sin²(2x)=4 sin²x cos²x, so sin²x cos²x = (1/4) sin²(2x).

So, the integral becomes 6*(1/4) ∫ sin²(2x) dx from 0 to π/2.

Simplify: 6*(1/4)= 3/2. So, (3/2) ∫ sin²(2x) dx from 0 to π/2.

Now, let me make substitution u=2x, so when x=0, u=0; x=π/2, u=π.

So, dx = du/2.

Thus, the integral becomes (3/2) ∫ sin² u * (du/2) from 0 to π.

So, (3/2)*(1/2) ∫ sin² u du from 0 to π.

Which is (3/4) ∫ sin² u du from 0 to π.

Now, the integral of sin² u over 0 to π is a standard integral. I know that ∫ sin² u du = (u/2 - (sin(2u))/4 ) + C.

Evaluating from 0 to π:

At π: (π/2 - (sin(2π))/4 )= π/2 -0 = π/2.

At 0: 0 -0=0.

So, the integral is π/2 -0 = π/2.

Thus, the second integral is (3/4)*(π/2)= (3/4)*(π/2)= 3π/8.

So, total area A is the sum of the two integrals:

First integral:4

Second integral:3π/8

So, A=4 + 3π/8.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Wait, this doesn't seem to match any of the answer choices. The options are all numbers, not involving pi. Hmmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Because the answer choices don't have 4 + 3π/8, but the options are 5,3,2, etc., which are numbers, not involving pi. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me go back. Hmm.

Wait, in the second integral, I had 6 ∫ sin²x cos²x dx from 0 to π/2.

I rewrote sin²x cos²x as (1/4) sin²(2x). So that part is correct.

Then, integral becomes (6)*(1/4)= 6/4=3/2 times ∫ sin²(2x) dx from 0 to π/2.

Then, I substituted u=2x, so du=2dx, so dx=du/2.

Hence, the integral becomes (3/2) * (1/2) ∫ sin²u du from 0 to π.

Which is (3/4) ∫ sin²u du from 0 to π.

Now, integral of sin²u from 0 to π is (u/2 - (sin(2u))/4) evaluated from 0 to π.

At π: (π/2 - 0) = π/2.

At 0: 0 -0 = 0.

So, integral is π/2. Thus, (3/4)*(π/2)= 3π/8.

So, the second integral is indeed 3π/8.

So, the total area is 4 + 3π/8.

But the answer choices are all integers, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the absolute difference between (y1 - y2). Wait, but from x=0 to x=pi/2, is y1 always greater than y2? Earlier, I saw that at x=pi/4, y1=4, y2=0; at x=pi/3, y1≈3.41, y2≈0.017. So y1 is always above y2 in [0, pi/2]. So the area is indeed the integral of (y1 - y2) dx, which is 4 + 3pi/8.

But since the answer options don't have 4 + 3pi/8, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me re-examine the integrand. Let me go back.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in simplifying the integrand. Let me go back to the beginning.

Original integrand after simplifying was:

8 sin^3x cosx +8 sinx cos^3x +6 sin²x cos²x.

Wait, perhaps I can compute each integral step by step.

Compute the first integral: 8 ∫ sinx cosx dx.

Which is 8*(1/2 sin²x) from 0 to pi/2.

Evaluate at pi/2: 1, so 8*(1/2)=4.

Second integral: 6 ∫ sin^2x cos^2x dx.

Let me compute this integral again.

I know that sin^2x cos^2x = (1/4) sin^2(2x).

So, 6 * ∫ (1/4) sin^2(2x) dx = (6/4) ∫ sin²(2x) dx = (3/2) ∫ sin²(2x) dx.

Let me make substitution u=2x, so du=2dx, so dx=du/2.

So, integral becomes (3/2) ∫ sin² u (du/2) = (3/4) ∫ sin² u du.

The integral of sin² u is (u/2 - (sin(2u))/4 ) + C.

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

At u=pi: (pi/2 - 0) = pi/2.

At u=0: (0 -0)=0.

So, the integral is pi/2.

Thus, the second integral is (3/4)*(pi/2)= 3pi/8.

So, the area becomes 4 + 3pi/8.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the answer choices, which are all integers or pi multiples.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that y1 is always above y2. Let me check at x=0, both are 1. At x=pi/2, both are 1. Let me check another point, say x=pi/3.

y1 = (sin(pi/3)+cos(pi/3))^4 = (sqrt(3)/2 +1/2)^4.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approx 0.866, 1/2 is 0.5, so sum is approx 1.366.

1.366^4 ≈ (1.366)^2 = 1.866, then squared is about 3.48.

y2 = (sin(pi/3) - cos(pi/3))^4 = (0.866 -0.5)^4 = (0.366)^4≈ 0.017.

So, y1 is much larger. What about x=pi/6.

y1 = (sqrt(3)/2 + 1/2)^4 ≈ (0.866 + 0.5)^4≈1.366^4≈3.41.

y2 = (sqrt(3)/2 -1/2)^4≈(0.866 -0.5)^4≈0.366^4≈0.017.

Again, y1 is larger.

Wait, so maybe I was correct. So area is 4 + 3pi/8, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered y1 and y2 in terms of (cosx - sinx), but no, wait, y1 is (sinx +cosx)^4, which is always positive, y2 is (sinx -cosx)^4, which is always positive too because any number to the 4th power is positive. So, the difference is always positive, so the area is indeed the integral of (y1 - y2) dx, which is 4 + 3pi/8.

But since the answer choices are numbers, perhaps I made a mistake in the integrand.

Wait, let me think again. Let me compute the integrand y1 - y2 again.

After expanding, we had:

y1 - y2 = 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x.

Wait, 8 sinx cosx is correct.

But wait, in the second integral, I had 6 sin²x cos²x, which I converted to 6*(1/4) sin²(2x) = (6/4) sin²(2x) = 3/2 sin²(2x). Then, integrated over 0 to pi/2.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the integral of sin²(2x) from 0 to pi/2. Let me do that.

Integral of sin²(2x) dx from 0 to pi/2.

Let me set u=2x, so du=2dx, dx=du/2.

When x=0, u=0; x=pi/2, u=pi.

So, integral becomes (1/2) ∫ sin²u du from 0 to pi.

The integral of sin²u is (u/2 - (sin(2u))/4 ) evaluated from 0 to pi.

At pi: (pi/2 - 0 )= pi/2.

At 0: 0 -0=0.

So, the integral is pi/2.

Therefore, (1/2)*(pi/2)= pi/4.

So, the second integral is (3/2)*(pi/4)= 3pi/8.

So, the area is 4 + 3pi/8.

But the answer choices don't have 4 + 3pi/8. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, let me check the original problem statement.

Wait, the problem is to find the area between the curves y = (sinx + cosx)^4 and y = (sinx - cosx)^4 from x=0 to x=pi/2.

But I think I might have miscalculated the integrand. Wait, perhaps I should have used substitution earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have made substitution for the entire integral.

Wait, but let me see. Let me try to compute the integral 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x.

Wait, 8 sinx cosx can be rewritten as 4 sin(2x).

And 6 sin²x cos²x can be written as 6*(sinx cosx)^2 =6*( (sin(2x)/2 )^2 )=6*( sin²(2x)/4 )= (6/4) sin²(2x)= (3/2) sin²(2x).

So, the integral is 4 sin(2x) + (3/2) sin²(2x).

Let me compute each term.

First term: ∫4 sin(2x) dx.

Let u=2x, du=2 dx, dx=du/2.

So, integral becomes ∫4 sinu * (du/2)= 2 ∫ sinu du = 2*(-cosu) + C = -2 cos(2x) + C.

Evaluating from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: -2 cos(pi)= -2*(-1)=2.

At 0: -2 cos(0)= -2*(1)= -2.

So, the first integral is 2 - (-2)=4.

Second term: ∫ (3/2) sin²(2x) dx.

Again, use substitution: u=2x, du=2dx, dx=du/2.

So, integral becomes (3/2)*(1/2) ∫ sin²u du from 0 to pi.

Which is (3/4) ∫ sin²u du.

As before, the integral of sin²u from 0 to pi is pi/2, so (3/4)*(pi/2)= 3pi/8.

So, the second term is 3pi/8.

Adding both integrals: 4 + 3pi/8.

Hmm, but the answer choices don't include 4 + 3pi/8. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, maybe I should have subtracted the other way. Wait, but no, we already took the absolute difference.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that during the integration, the substitution might have introduced an error.

Wait, but let me think again about the problem. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute the area without expanding everything.

Wait, another approach: since y1 = (sinx +cosx)^4 and y2=(sinx -cosx)^4, perhaps using binomial coefficients.

Wait, but perhaps using (a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4 = ?

Wait, let me compute (a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4.

Expanding both:

(a + b)^4 = a^4 +4a^3b +6a^2b^2 +4ab^3 +b^4.

(a - b)^4= a^4 -4a^3b +6a^2b^2 -4ab^3 +b^4.

Subtracting: (a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4 = [8a^3b +8ab^3] + [12a^2b^2].

Wait, no, let me compute term by term.

(a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4 = (a^4 -a^4) + (4a^3b +4a^3b) + (6a^2b^2 -6a^2b^2) + (4ab^3 +4ab^3) + (b^4 -b^4).

So, it's 8a^3b +8ab^3.

Thus, (a + b)^4 - (a -b)^4=8ab(a^2 +b^2).

Hmm, so in our case, a=sinx, b=cosx.

Thus, (sinx +cosx)^4 - (sinx -cosx)^4=8 sinx cosx (sin²x + cos²x).

But sin²x + cos²x=1, so it becomes 8 sinx cosx.

Wait, but that's just the first term of the integrand.

Wait, but that doesn't include the second term, 6 sin²x cos²x.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we had:

y1 - y2 =8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x.

But according to this, it's only 8 sinx cosx.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding (sinx + cosx)^4 - (sinx - cosx)^4.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, let me compute (a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4 again.

Expanding (a + b)^4:

a^4 +4a^3b +6a^2b^2 +4ab^3 +b^4.

Expanding (a - b)^4:

a^4 -4a^3b +6a^2b^2 -4ab^3 +b^4.

Subtracting:

(a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4 = [ (a^4 -a^4) + (4a^3b +4a^3b) + (6a^2b^2 -6a^2b^2) + (4ab^3 +4ab^3) + (b^4 -b^4) ]

So, that gives:

8a^3b +8ab^3.

Which is 8ab(a^2 + b^2).

Which, with a=sinx, b=cosx, gives 8 sinx cosx (sin²x + cos²x) =8 sinx cosx.

But that would mean y1 - y2 =8 sinx cosx, which contradicts our earlier analysis.

Wait, but that can't be right because when we plug in x=pi/4, sinx=cosx=sqrt(2)/2, so 8 sinx cosx=8*(1/2)=4, which seems correct.

But then, when we plug into the integral, we have (y1 - y2)=8 sinx cosx, so the integral becomes ∫8 sinx cosx dx from 0 to pi/2.

Which is 4, as we calculated earlier.

But then, where does the 6 sin²x cos²x come into play? Because according to this, it's not there.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the expansion.

Wait, let me re-calculate the expansion.

Wait, (a +b)^4 - (a - b)^4.

Let me expand each term.

(a + b)^4 = a^4 +4a^3b +6a^2b^2 +4ab^3 +b^4.

(a - b)^4 =a^4 -4a^3b +6a^2b^2 -4ab^3 +b^4.

Subtracting the two:

(a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4 = [ (a^4 -a^4) + (4a^3b +4a^3b) + (6a^2b^2 -6a^2b^2) + (4ab^3 +4ab^3) + (b^4 -b^4) ]

So, this simplifies to:

0 +8a^3b +0 +8ab^3 +0 =8a^3b +8ab^3.

Which is correct.

So, that means (a +b)^4 - (a -b)^4=8ab(a^2 +b^2).

In our case, a=sinx, b=cosx.

So, (sinx +cosx)^4 - (sinx -cosx)^4=8 sinx cosx (sin²x +cos²x)=8 sinx cosx.

So, the integrand is 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x, but according to this, the integrand should only be 8 sinx cosx.

Wait, now I'm confused. Where is the 6 sin²x cos²x coming from?

Wait, perhaps in the expansion, there's a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a term.

Wait, (a +b)^4 - (a -b)^4.

Let me compute the expansion of (a +b)^4 and (a -b)^4 again.

(a +b)^4:

a^4 +4a^3b +6a^2b^2 +4ab^3 +b^4.

(a -b)^4:

a^4 -4a^3b +6a^2b^2 -4ab^3 +b^4.

Subtract:

(a +b)^4 - (a -b)^4 = (8a^3b +8ab^3).

So, that's correct.

So, in our problem, y1 - y2 =8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x.

But according to the expansion, it should only be 8 sinx cosx.

Wait, so that implies that 6 sin²x cos²x is zero, which is not the case.

Wait, that suggests that my earlier analysis is incorrect.

Wait, that's impossible because when I plug in x= pi/4, 6 sin²x cos²x is 6*(1/2)^2*(1/2)^2=6*(1/4)*(1/4)=6/16=3/8, which is not zero.

Wait, but according to the expansion, the difference is 8 sinx cosx.

So, that suggests that my earlier analysis is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the integrand is not 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x, but only 8 sinx cosx.

Wait, that would mean that the problem is to find the area between the curves y=(sinx +cosx)^4 and y=(sinx -cosx)^4 from x=0 to x=pi/2, and perhaps the difference is just 8 sinx cosx, making the integral ∫8 sinx cosx dx, which is 4, but then why is the answer option 4.

Wait, but the answer choices are: A. 5, B.8, C. 4, D.3. So, 4 is an option, C.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C.4.

Wait, but the problem is presented in a way that suggests it's more complicated, so maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, but according to the expansion, the difference is 8 sinx cosx, so the integrand is 8 sinx cosx, and the area is ∫8 sinx cosx dx from 0 to pi/2.

Which is 4, as I computed.

So, perhaps the answer is 4, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the integrand should have an additional 6 sin²x cos²x term, but that seems to be incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me check using a different method.

Let me compute (sinx + cosx)^4 - (sinx - cosx)^4 using binomial expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the difference using another identity.

Wait, let me note that (a + b)^4 - (a - b)^4 = 8ab(a^2 + b^2).

Which is correct.

So, in our case, a = sinx, b=cosx, so:

Difference =8 sinx cosx (sin²x + cos²x) =8 sinx cosx.

So, integrand is 8 sinx cosx.

Thus, area is ∫8 sinx cosx dx from 0 to pi/2.

Which is 4.

So, the answer is C.4.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the integrand was 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x, but that was a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps that was a mistake, because according to the expansion, the difference is only 8 sinx cosx.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is 4, which is option C.

But wait, the initial problem says "the curves y=(sinx +cosx)^4 and y=(sinx -cosx)^4". So, perhaps the curves are (sinx +cosx)^4 and (sinx -cosx)^4, so their difference is (sinx +cosx)^4 - (sinx -cosx)^4, which is 8 sinx cosx, as per the expansion.

Hence, the area between the curves is the integral of 8 sinx cosx dx from 0 to pi/2, which is 4.

So, the answer is C.4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the integrand was 8 sinx cosx +6 sin²x cos²x, but that was a mistake.

Therefore, the correct answer is 4, which is option C.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}
</think>

To find the area between the curves \( y = (\sin x + \cos x)^4 \) and \( y = (\sin x - \cos x)^4 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \), we first need to determine the points of intersection. These points occur at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Next, we simplify the expression for the difference between the two curves using the binomial expansion. We find that the difference between the two curves is given by:

\[
(\sin x + \cos x)^4 - (\sin x - \cos x)^4 = 8 \sin x \cos x
\]

This simplifies the integrand. We then compute the integral of this simplified integrand from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{\pi}{2} \):

\[
\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 8 \sin x \cos x \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \sin x \), we find that the integral evaluates to:

\[
4
\]

Thus, the area between the curves is:

\[
\boxed{C}
