Alright, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the probability that the sample mean, X bar, falls within a certain range. The given parameters are:

- The population mean, μ, is 54.030.
- The population standard deviation, σ, is 5.8.
- The sample size, n, is 47.

We need to find P(52.761 ≤ X bar ≤ 54.453). The options are multiple-choice letters, so I need to compute this probability and match it to one of the options given.

First, I remember that when dealing with sample means, especially for large samples, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that the distribution of X bar will be approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. Since n is 47, which is reasonably large, I can apply the CLT here.

So, the sampling distribution of X bar is approximately normal with mean μ and standard error σ divided by the square root of n. 

Let me write that down:

- Mean of X bar (μ_x̄) = μ = 54.030
- Standard error (σ_x̄) = σ / sqrt(n) = 5.8 / sqrt(47)

I need to calculate the standard error. Let's compute sqrt(47). Hmm, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(47) is slightly less, maybe around 6.8557. So, 5.8 divided by 6.8557 is approximately 0.846. Let me check that with a calculator.

Wait, 6.8557 × 0.846 ≈ 5.8. So, σ_x̄ ≈ 0.846.

Now, the next step is to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the interval. The z-score formula is:

z = (X - μ_x̄) / σ_x̄

So, for the lower bound, X = 52.761.

z_lower = (52.761 - 54.030) / 0.846

Calculating numerator: 52.761 - 54.030 = -1.269

Then, z_lower = (-1.269) / 0.846 ≈ -1.501

Similarly, for the upper bound, X = 54.453.

z_upper = (54.453 - 54.030) / 0.846

Calculating numerator: 54.453 - 54.030 = 0.423

Then, z_upper = 0.423 / 0.846 ≈ 0.500

Wait, that can't be right. Let me redo the calculations.

Wait, 52.761 minus 54.030 is indeed -1.269. Divided by 0.846 is approximately -1.501.

For 54.453, 54.453 -54.030 is 0.423. Divided by 0.846 is 0.500.

So, the z-scores are approximately -1.501 and 0.500.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is between -1.501 and 0.500. Since Z is approximately standard normal, I can use standard normal distribution tables or a calculator.

I think the standard normal table gives the area to the left of a certain z-score. So, P(-1.501 ≤ Z ≤ 0.500) is equal to P(Z ≤ 0.500) minus P(Z ≤ -1.501).

Looking up these values:

For z = 0.500: From the standard normal table, the cumulative probability is 0.6915.

For z = -1.501: Since the table might not have exact -1.50, I can approximate. Let's think about z = -1.50 and z = -1.51.

Looking at the table, z = -1.50 corresponds to 0.0668, and z = -1.51 is 0.0655. But since -1.501 is just slightly more negative than -1.50, the probability will be slightly higher than 0.0668. Let's say approximately 0.0663.

So, P(Z ≤ 0.500) = 0.6915

P(Z ≤ -1.501) ≈ 0.0663

Subtracting: 0.6915 - 0.0663 = 0.6252.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.6252 as an option. The closest is option G, which is 0.7753, option C is 0.6247, which is very close.

Wait, perhaps my approximation was a bit off. Let me check the exact z-scores and the precise probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check the z-scores again.

Wait, for X=52.761:

(52.761 - 54.030) = -1.269

Divide by σ_x̄ = 5.8 / sqrt(47) = 5.8 / 6.8557 ≈ 0.846.

So, z = -1.269 / 0.846 ≈ -1.500.

Wait, more accurately, 1.269 / 0.846 ≈ 1.500. So, z is -1.500.

Similarly, for X=54.453: 0.423 / 0.846 ≈ 0.500.

So, z_upper is 0.500.

So, P(-1.500 ≤ Z ≤ 0.500) is the probability we're looking for.

Using the standard normal table:

At z=0.50, the cumulative probability is 0.6915.

At z=-1.50, it's 0.0668.

So, the area between -1.50 and 0.50 is 0.6915 - 0.0668 = 0.6247.

So, the probability is approximately 0.6247, which is option C.

Wait, but the options are A: 0.7021, B: 0.5462, C: 0.6247, D: 0.5000, E: 0.9456, F: 0.4835, G: 0.7753, H: 0.2589, I: 0.8118, J: 0.3764.

So, option C is 0.6247. That's what I got.

Wait, but I just remember sometimes when computing with more precise z-scores, the exact z would be a bit different. Let me compute the exact z-scores again.

Wait, σ_x̄ is 5.8 / sqrt(47). Let me compute sqrt(47) more accurately. 6.8557 is 47's square root. So, 5.8 divided by 6.8557 is approximately 0.846.

Wait, let me compute 5.8 divided by 6.8557:

5.8 ÷ 6.8557 ≈ 0.846.

Wait, let me compute 5.8 × 100 / 685.57 = 580 / 685.57 ≈ 0.846.

So, that's correct.

So, the z-scores are indeed -1.500 and 0.500.

Looking at the standard normal table, the area from z=-1.50 to z=0.50 is 0.6247.

So, the answer should be 0.6247, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we use the Central Limit Theorem since the sample size is large (n=47). The population mean (μ) is 54.030 and the population standard deviation (σ) is 5.8. The standard error (σ_x̄) is calculated as:

σ_x̄ = σ / sqrt(n) = 5.8 / sqrt(47) ≈ 0.846.

The sample mean (X bar) follows a normal distribution with μ_x̄ = 54.030 and σ_x̄ ≈ 0.846. We need to find P(52.761 ≤ X bar ≤ 54.453). Converting these to z-scores:

- For X = 52.761: z = (52.761 - 54.030) / 0.846 ≈ -1.500
- For X = 54.453: z = (54.453 - 54.030) / 0.846 ≈ 0.500

Using the standard normal table, the area to the left of z = 0.500 is 0.6915, and the area to the left of z = -1.500 is 0.0668. The probability between these z-scores is 0.6915 - 0.0668 = 0.6247.
