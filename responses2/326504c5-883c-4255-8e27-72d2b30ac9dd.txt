Question:

A condominium development consists of two buildings, one with balconies attached to each unit, and one withno balconies. For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?

Options:

A: Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.
B: No, because the amendment was promptly recorded and is legally binding.
C: Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.
D: No, because the association is acting in the best interests of child safety.
E: No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.
F: No, because the association has the right to approve all sales.
G: No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about property law, specifically regarding fair housing laws. The scenario involves a condominium development with two buildings: one with balconies and one without. The owner of a unit with a balcony is selling it to a family with a child, and they're being told that the buyer can't buy it because they have children. But then the buyer complains and brings it to a fair housing agency, claiming the amendment wasn't enforceable because it violated federal laws.

First, I need to understand the facts. The owner is part of a condominium where the sale of units with balconies is prohibited. So the owner is selling to a family with children, which is prohibited. But the owner is being told that they can't buy the unit because it has a balcony. However, the owner is selling to someone else, a family without children, who is then approached by the fair housing agency, claiming that the law was violated because the sales were prohibited.

I need to determine if there's reasonable cause to believe that the amendment (the covenants against sale) is unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws.

So, the key here is understanding the legal implications of the sales covenants. The development has a clause that prohibits the sale of units with balconies to families with children. This is a restriction on sales. The owner is selling to a family with children, which is prohibited. But the owner is being told they can't buy it because of the balcony. Then, a buyer comes in, complains, and the agency says the covenants are unenforceable.

Now, the question is about whether the covenants were unenforceable because of the existence of children in the building. 

In property law, a covenant that prohibits the sale of a certain type of property is considered enforceable if the owner is required to sell such properties to everyone. But in this case, the owner is selling to a family with children, which is prohibited. So, the owner is required to sell such units to non-children. But the owner is selling to a child, which is prohibited, and the owner is being told they can't buy it because it has a balcony. So, the owner is selling to a child but under a restriction that they can't buy it because of the balcony.

Wait, but the owner is prohibited from selling to families with children. So, if they were to try to sell to a family with a child, they couldn't. But the owner is trying to sell because they have children. So, the owner is prohibited from selling to them, but they are in the process of selling. So, the owner is acting in violation of the covenants.

Wait, but the owner is being told that they can't buy the unit because they have children. So, the owner is being prohibited from selling, but they're selling. So, the owner is acting in violation. But the owner is not allowed to sell under the covenants, so they must have been in breach.

Wait, but the owner is required to inform families with children that they can't buy the unit. So, the owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children. So, when the owner tries to sell, they're prohibited, but they proceed anyway. So, perhaps they are in breach.

But in this scenario, the owner is in the process of selling to a family with children, but is being told they can't buy it. So, that seems like a violation of the covenants.

Now, the key is whether the covenants against sale are enforceable. The covenants are part of the covenant against sale clause. So, if the owner is required to sell to non-children, then selling to children (prohibited by the covenants) is a violation.

But in this case, the owner is being told they can't buy the unit because of the children. So, perhaps the owner is in violation because they can't sell to the children, but they are attempting to sell. So, the owner is in violation.

Wait, but the owner is trying to sell to a child, but the covenants prohibit sales to families with children. So, if the owner is trying to sell to a family with children, that's a violation. But in this scenario, the owner's attempt to sell is not to a child but to someone else, but the owner is in the process of selling. So, perhaps the owner is acting in violation.

But the owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children. So, if they were to try to sell to a family with children, they couldn't. But they are in the process of selling to a family without children. So, they're not a problem.

Wait, but the owner is being told they can't buy the unit because of the children, but the owner is trying to sell. So, perhaps the owner is in violation because trying to sell to a child, but that's not a family with children. Wait, no. If the unit has a balcony, then a family with children can't live there, but it's okay for a family without children to live there. So, the owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children (regardless of the unit's features). So, if the owner is selling to a family with children, they can't do that. But the owner is trying to sell to a family without children. So, their attempt is to sell to a family that's allowed to live there, but the owner's intention is to sell to a family with children, which is prohibited.

So, the owner is in a position where they're trying to sell to a family with children, but the unit has a balcony, making it unsuitable for that family. So, the owner is violating the covenants because they're trying to sell to a family that's prohibited, despite the unit having a balcony.

But the owner is being told they can't buy the unit, so perhaps they're in a position to sell. So, perhaps they're acting in violation because they're trying to sell to a family with children, but the unit prohibits that.

Alternatively, perhaps the owner's attempt is to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from doing so regardless of the unit's features. So, the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from doing that.

Wait, but the owner is trying to sell because they have children, but the unit prohibits them from doing so. So, they're in violation because they're trying to sell to a family who is prohibited from living there.

So, in this scenario, the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from doing so. So, the owner is acting in violation.

But when the owner tries to sell, they are prohibited. So, the owner is in a breach of the covenants against sale. So, the covenants are not enforceable because the owner is acting in violation by trying to sell to a family with children.

Wait, but the owner's attempt is to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from doing that. So, perhaps the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children, regardless of the unit's features.

Wait, no. The unit has a balcony, which is a separate feature. The covenants against sale prohibit the sale to families with children, regardless of the unit's existence. So, the unit has a balcony, which is a separate issue. The owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children. So, if the owner is trying to sell to a family with children, even if the unit has a balcony, that's prohibited.

So, in this scenario, the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from doing so because the family is a prohibited one. So, the owner is acting in violation.

But the owner is being told they can't buy the unit because they have children. So, perhaps they're in violation.

Alternatively, perhaps the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children, regardless of the unit's features. So, the owner's attempt to sell is to a prohibited family, which is a violation.

So, in that case, the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from doing so. So, the owner is acting in violation of the covenants.

Now, the question is whether this constitutes a violation of federal fair housing laws. The covenants against sale are a covenant against sale, which is a common law covenant. So, the covenant against sale is considered enforceable if the owner is required to sell to non-conforming parties.

In this case, the owner is trying to sell to a family with children, which is a prohibited category. So, the owner is acting in violation of the covenant against sale. Therefore, the amendment is unenforceable because it violates the covenants, which in turn violate the federal fair housing laws.

But wait, the owner is in the process of selling, and the owner is being told they can't buy the unit because of the children. So, the owner is trying to sell, but under a restriction that they can't do so. So, that's a violation because they're in breach of the covenant against sale.

But the owner is allowed to sell to non-prohibited families, like the one without a balcony, because the owner is prohibited from selling to families with children. So, the owner is not required to sell to families with children, regardless of whether the unit has a balcony or not. So, the owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children.

So, the owner is trying to sell to a family with children, which is prohibited, regardless of the unit's features. Therefore, the owner is acting in violation of the covenants.

Thus, the amendment was unenforceable because it prohibited the owner from selling to families with children, which is a violation of the covenant against sale.

But let's think about the options.

Option A: Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because the owner is selling to a family with children, but the unit has a balcony, which is prohibited. So, the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, but the owner is prohibited from doing so. Thus, the owner is acting in violation, so the covenants are unenforceable.

Option B: No, because the amendment was promptly recorded and is legally binding. But the question is about whether it's unenforceable, not whether it's binding. So, B is about enforcement, not violation.

Option C: Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated. Hmm, segregation of units is a separate issue. The covenants are about sales, not about the units themselves. But in this scenario, the owner is selling to a family with children, which is a prohibited category, regardless of the unit's features. So, the covenants are about the sales, not the units.

Option D: No, because the association is acting in the best interests of the children. But the owner is selling to a family with children, which is prohibited. The owner is acting in violation, not in good faith. So, D is incorrect.

Option E: No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units without balconies. But the owner is selling to a family without children, so this is not relevant.

So, the main point is whether the owner is in a position to sell to a family with children, which is prohibited, thus the owner is in violation.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Yes, because the owner is acting in violation of the covenants against sale, which are unenforceable, leading to a violation of federal fair housing laws.

But wait, the owner is being told they can't buy the unit because they have children. So, perhaps the owner is in a position to sell because the owner is trying to sell to a family with children, but the owner can't because the covenants prohibit it. So, the owner is in a violation, so the amendment is unenforceable.

But the owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children. So, the owner can't sell to a family with children, but in this scenario, the owner is trying to sell, so they are in violation.

So, the answer is A.

The question revolves around whether the covenants against sale in a condominium development are enforceable, given that the owner of a unit with a balcony is attempting to sell to a family with children. The owner is being told they cannot buy the unit due to the presence of children, even though the unit has a balcony. The key issue is whether the owner's actions constitute a violation of the covenants, which could lead to a violation of federal fair housing laws.

1. **Understanding the Covenants**: The development prohibits the sale of units with balconies to families with children. This creates a covenant against sale, which is a common law covenant. The covenant is enforceable if the owner is required to sell to non-conforming parties.

2. **Owner's Actions**: The owner is in the process of selling to a family with children, despite the unit having a balcony. The owner is being told they cannot buy the unit, which is a violation of the covenant against sale.

3. **Violation of Covenants**: The owner is acting in violation because they are attempting to sell to a family with children, which is prohibited by the covenants. The owner is prohibited from selling to any family with children, regardless of the unit's features.

4. **Impact on Fair Housing Laws**: The violation of the covenants against sale directly violates federal fair housing laws. The covenants are not enforceable because the owner is acting in violation by attempting to sell to a prohibited category of families.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **A**: Correct. The owner is in violation of the covenants against sale, which are unenforceable because they prohibit the sale to families with children, violating federal fair housing laws.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The covenants are not legally binding; they are enforced based on the owner's actions, not their prompt recording.
   - **C**: Incorrect. Segregation of units is a separate issue and not addressed by the covenants.
   - **D**: Incorrect. The owner is acting in violation, not in good faith, about the children's best interests.
   - **E**: Incorrect. The owner is not allowed to sell to families without balconies; the issue is specifically about families with children.
