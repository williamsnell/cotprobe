Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the amount of Btu needed to raise the temperature of water. Hmm, let's think. The question is about 2 pounds of water changing temperature from 32°F to 212°F. I remember that Btu stands for British Thermal Units, which is a unit of energy. 

Wait, the formula for calculating the heat required is Q = m * c * ΔT, right? Where Q is the heat in Btu, m is mass in pounds, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. But wait, what's the specific heat of water in Btu units? I'm a bit rusty on this. 

I think the specific heat of water is about 1 Btu per pound per degree Fahrenheit. Or wait, no, isn't that kilocalories? Because I remember that 1 Btu is roughly 2500 Bcals. But wait, to clarify: the specific heat capacity of water is about 1 Btu/lb°F. So that should be correct. 

So the mass m is 2 pounds. The change in temperature ΔT is from 32°F to 212°F. Let me calculate that. 212 minus 32 is 180°F. So ΔT is 180°F. 

Now, plugging into the formula: Q = 2 lb * 1 Btu/lb°F * 180°F. So that's 2 * 180 = 360 Btu. Looking at the options, F is 360 Btu. Wait, but wait, is that right? Another thought: sometimes specific heat varies with temperature, but for water, it's approximately constant over such a small range. So I think that's fine. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the units. Oh, wait, 1 Btu is 778 calories. But wait, that's for converting between units, but in this case, since we're using Btu as the unit for energy and Fahrenheit for temperature, the specific heat is 1 Btu per pound per degree Fahrenheit. So yeah, the calculation looks correct. So the answer should be 360 Btu. Hmm, looking back at the options, option F is 360. So the correct answer is F.

To determine the amount of Btu required to raise the temperature of 2 pounds of water from 32°F to 212°F, we use the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \). Here, \( m = 2 \) pounds, \( c = 1 \) Btu/lb°F, and \( \Delta T = 212 - 32 = 180°F \). Calculating, \( Q = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 180 = 360 \) Btu. The correct option is F: 360 Btu.

Answer: F
