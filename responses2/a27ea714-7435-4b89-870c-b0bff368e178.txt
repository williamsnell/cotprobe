Okay, so I've got this question about gases and their diffusion rates. Let me try to think it through. The question says that at standard conditions, 1 liter of oxygen weighs almost 1.44 grams, and 1 liter of hydrogen weighs only 0.09 grams. The question is asking which gas diffuses faster and by how much. The options are A through J, with each stating the ratio of diffusion speeds.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember something about Graham's law. Oh right, Graham's law relates the rates of diffusion or effusion of gases to their molar masses. The law states that the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So the lighter gas should effuse faster than the heavier one.

Let me jot down the given data. Oxygen (O2) has a molar mass of about 32 g/mol, and hydrogen (H2) is 2 g/mol. So the molar mass of O2 is 16 times that of H2 (since 32 is 16*2). 

Graham's law formula, if I'm not mistaken, is Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where M is molar mass. But wait, sometimes I get it backward. Let me think. The rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So the lighter gas effuses faster. So for the same volume and time, the heavier gas will effuse slower.

So for O2 and H2, the rates would be inversely proportional to their square roots of molar masses. O2 is heavier than H2. So O2's rate is lower than H2's.

Wait, the question is which diffuses faster. So H2 diffuses faster than O2. Now, how much faster? Let's calculate the ratio.

The formula is Rate_H2 / Rate_O2 = sqrt(M_O2 / M_H2) = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) = 4. So H2 is 4 times faster than O2. So H2 diffuses four times as fast as O2.

Looking at the options: Option D is Hydrogen diffuses 4 times faster than Oxygen. Option B says Oxygen is 2x faster, which would be incorrect. Option H says H2 is 1.5x faster, which is wrong. Option E says H2 is 2x faster, which is wrong. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine which gas diffuses faster between oxygen (O₂) and hydrogen (H₂), we use Graham's law of effusion, which states that the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas. 

Given:
- Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol
- Molar mass of H₂ = 2 g/mol

According to Graham's law:
\[
\text{Rate of diffusion} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{Molar Mass}}}
\]

For H₂ and O₂:
\[
\frac{\text{Rate of H₂}}{\text{Rate of O₂}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Molar Mass of O₂}}{\text{Molar Mass of H₂}}} = \sqrt{\frac{32}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4
\]

This means hydrogen diffuses 4 times faster than oxygen. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Incorrect (same rate) and **B**: Incorrect (O₂ is not 2x faster than H₂).
- **C**: Incorrect (H₂ is not 16x faster than O₂).
- **D**: Correct (H₂ is 4x faster than O₂).
- **E**: Incorrect (H₂ is not 2x faster than O₂).
- **F**: Incorrect (O₂ is not faster than H₂).
- **G**: Incorrect (H₂ is not 8x faster than O₂).
- **H**: Incorrect (H₂ is not 1.5x faster than O₂).
- **I**: Incorrect (H₂ is not 3x faster than O₂).
- **J**: Incorrect (H₂ is not faster than O₂).

Thus, the correct answer is **D**: Hydrogen diffuses 4 times faster than oxygen.
