Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the history of art and its purpose. The question is asking which movement abandoned the idea of making traditional, saleable art objects. The options are A to J, each representing different art movements.

Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means. I know that art movements have different focuses and goals. For example, Surrealism was all about creating unusual and imaginative works, while Abstract Expressionism was more about representing emotions through color and form. 

The question is specifically about the reason why traditional art objects were abandoned. I remember that many art movements were trying to push boundaries or create something new, but some refused to do that, leading to their abandonment.

I think that the Surrealists, represented by option A, were into creating unusual and sometimes even humorous pieces. But I'm not sure if they abandoned traditional objects. Or maybe they didn't find a reason to do so, so the idea of traditional objects being abandoned might not be their choice.

Futurists (option B) were associated with the 1920s and 1930s, focusing on modern and futuristic designs. I don't recall Futurists abandoning traditional objects. They were more about the future and didn't seem to have a preference for traditional forms.

Cubists (option C) were into the cubism movement, which was all about taking apart and reassembling objects to create new forms. They were quite traditional in that sense, so I don't think they abandoned traditional objects.

Pop artists (D) were known for their diverse styles, including pop art, which often uses traditional objects as props. So they might have been influenced by them, but the question is about abandonment, not influence.

Abstract Expressionists (F) were more about expressing emotions through color and form, so they might not have abandoned traditional objects. They focused on the visual, not just the material.

Conceptual artists (G) were interested in abstract concepts and didn't use traditional materials, so they might not have abandoned traditional objects either.

Impressionists (H) were into capturing the moment, not necessarily traditional objects, so they probably didn't abandon them.

Dadaists (I) were known for their use of color, experimentation, and often depicted objects in a more colorful and unconventional way. They might not have abandoned traditional objects but rather pushed into a different style.

Fauvists (J) were into preserving certain elements of a work while removing others. They might have been influenced by traditional objects but not necessarily abandoning them.

Wait, but the question is about what abandoned traditional objects. So which movement did not focus on traditional or functional art objects? I think the Surrealists, Surrealism, were more about creating unconventional and sometimes humorous pieces, but perhaps they didn't abandon traditional objects. Alternatively, maybe the answer is different.

Hmm, another angle: sometimes movements were criticized for their lack of traditional value, leading to them being abandoned. For example, maybe they abandoned their traditional objects because they didn't recognize their value or didn't see the aesthetic appeal of certain traditional art.

Wait, the question is about the abandonment of traditional art objects as an intention. So perhaps the movement that didn't create traditional, functional objects. I'm trying to remember specific movements.

Wait, the term "art objects" is a bit ambiguous. Are they referring to traditional but more functional objects (like vases or mugs) or traditional and functional? Or are they talking about traditional art pieces that have become impractical or unattractive.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: The idea that artists abandoned traditional objects could mean that they no longer made traditional objects. So which movement didn't make traditional objects?

Wait, maybe the answer is Surrealists. Because Surrealism often focused on imaginative, unconventional designs, which might have led to their rejection of traditional objects, which are more functional and practical.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Fauvists, but Fauvists were more about preserving traditional elements, so they were probably not abandoning them.

Wait, another thought: The question says "making traditional, saleable art objects." So maybe they wanted to create objects that were both traditional and useful. So if a movement abandoned that, they would no longer make traditional objects.

Looking back, the Surrealists were known for their use of humor and unconventional forms, which might have led them to reject traditional, functional objects. So the answer might be A: Surrealists.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the term "art objects" could refer to any art objects, functional or not. So perhaps the answer is someone who didn't create traditional, functional art objects.

Alternatively, I might have this backwards. Maybe the answer is someone who didn't create traditional objects, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about the movements. Abstract Expressionists were known for their unique style, which often involved traditional materials but in a more colorful and unconventional way. So they might have not abandoned traditional objects but used them creatively.

Wait, the question is about the intention of making traditional, saleable art objects being abandoned. So maybe it's the opposite: the movement that didn't make traditional objects because they were not considered traditional.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option:

- Surrealists (A): They were into humor and imaginative, which might have led them to not create traditional, functional objects.
- Futurists (B): They focused on futuristic designs, which might have been more in line with functional objects.
- Cubists (C): They were traditional, focusing on breaking down objects into parts.
- Pop artists (D): They often used traditional objects as props.
- Abstract Expressionists (F): Used traditional materials but in a more unconventional way.
- Conceptual artists (G): Focus on ideas, not materials.
- Impressionists (H): Captured the moment, so maybe didn't create traditional objects.
- Dadaists (I): Used color and experimentation, which might not have been traditional.
- Fauvists (J): Preserved traditional elements, so they might not have abandoned them.

Hmm, so which of these movements didn't create traditional objects as saleable. Surrealists were known for their humorous and non-traditional art, which might have led them to not make traditional objects. So the answer would be A: Surrealists.

The correct answer is A: Surrealists. Their focus on humorous and imaginative art, often rejecting traditional, functional forms, led them to abandon the creation of traditional, saleable art objects, which were more practical and utilitarian.
