Okay, so I've got this problem here about Brownian motion. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking for the probability that W(1) + W(2) is greater than 2. W(t) is standard Brownian motion, which I remember means it's a continuous-time Gaussian process with independent increments, right? And it's defined on a probability space with W(0) = 0.

So, W(t) is a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance t. That's because for a standard Brownian motion, each W(t) ~ N(0, t). So W(1) ~ N(0,1), W(2) ~ N(0,2). But wait, we're looking at W(1) + W(2). Hmm.

Wait, wait. Because W(1) and W(2) are not independent. Oh wait, no, actually, they are. Because W(2) = W(1) + (W(2) - W(1)), where W(2) - W(1) is independent of W(1). So W(1) and W(2) are jointly normal. Since they are normal variables, their sum is also normal. That's a key point.

So let me write down the sum: X = W(1) + W(2). Since W(1) and W(2) are both normal, X is normal too. What's the mean and variance of X?

The mean of W(1) is 0, and the mean of W(2) is 0. So the mean of X is 0 + 0 = 0.

What about the variance? Since Var(aX + bY) = a² Var(X) + b² Var(Y) + 2ab Cov(X, Y). But wait, here X is W(1) + W(2). Since W(1) and W(2) are not independent, their covariance is not zero. The covariance is Cov(W(1), W(2)).

Wait, the covariance between W(t) and W(s) for t ≤ s is Cov(W(t), W(s)) = min(t, s). Because for Brownian motion, increments are independent. So for t ≤ s, Cov(W(t), W(s)) = t. So Cov(W(1), W(2)) = 1.

So the variance of X = Var(W(1) + W(2)) = Var(W(1)) + Var(W(2)) + 2*Cov(W(1), W(2)).

That equals 1 + 2 + 2*(1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5? Wait, wait. Wait, wait again. Wait, Var(W(1)) is 1, Var(W(2)) is 2. And Cov(W(1), W(2)) is 1. So 1+2 is 3, plus 2*1 is 5. So the variance is 5, so the standard deviation is sqrt(5).

So X is N(0,5), or equivalently, X ~ N(0, 5).

Wait, let me double-check. The variance of W(1) + W(2) is Var(W(1)) + Var(W(2)) + 2*Cov(W(1), W(2)). So 1 + 2 + 2*(1) = 5. Yep.

So, X ~ N(0,5).

So, we need to find P(X > 2), which is P(W(1)+W(2) > 2).

Since X is normal with mean 0 and variance 5, we can standardize it. The Z-score would be (2 - 0)/sqrt(5) = 2/sqrt(5).

Wait, so the probability is P(Z > 2/sqrt(5)), where Z is standard normal.

What's 2/sqrt(5)? Let me compute that. sqrt(5) is approximately 2.2361. So 2 divided by that is about 0.8944.

So the probability that Z is greater than 0.8944. Let's think about standard normal distribution tables.

The standard normal distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives P(Z ≤ z). So P(Z > 0.8944) = 1 - P(Z ≤ 0.8944).

Looking up 0.8944 in a standard normal table. Alternatively, using the Z-table. Let me remember, the Z of 0.89 is about 0.89. Wait, let me think. Or perhaps I can use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z = 0.89, the CDF is about 0.8133. So 1 - 0.8133 is about 0.1867.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, I can compute this using the standard normal CDF function. Let me think, for example, if I have a calculator, Z=0.8944 is approximately 0.8944. Let me recall that:

The standard normal distribution for z=0.89 is approximately 0.8133. But what about 0.8944?

Wait, perhaps I should get more precise. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the options include 0.186 (option D) and 0.1867 is close to that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: if I have Z=2/sqrt(5) = 2/(2.2360679775) ≈ 0.894427191.

Now, let me recall that for z=0.89, the CDF is about 0.8133 (from standard tables). But for z=0.8944, which is 0.0044 higher than 0.89.

Wait, perhaps using a linear approximation between the two.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for normal CDF. Let me think, the cumulative distribution function can be approximated using the error function. The formula is P(Z ≤ z) = 0.5 * [1 + erf(z / sqrt(2))].

But perhaps it's easier to remember that:

For z=0.89, P(Z ≤ z) ≈ 0.8133.

For z=0.895, which is 0.89 + 0.005, perhaps the P increases a little beyond 0.8133. Alternatively, maybe using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that 0.8944 is approximately 0.8944.

Wait, let me think: the value I need is 1 - 0.8133 = 0.1867. So that's approximately 0.1867.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.186, which is close to that. But wait, other options: looking at the options, option D is 0.186, which is approximately 0.1867. But what about option F is 0.368, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the variance. Because another approach: perhaps I should think about the covariance correctly.

Wait, wait. Wait, W(1) and W(2) are dependent, but their covariance is Cov(W(1), W(2)) = min(1, 2) = 1, which is correct. So the variance of X is 1 + 2 + 2*(1) = 5.

So X is N(0,5), correct.

Wait, another way: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Var(X). Let me double-check.

Let me consider X = W(1) + W(2). Then Var(X) = Var(W(1)) + Var(W(2)) + 2 Cov(W(1), W(2)).

Since W(1) and W(2) are independent? No, wait, no, they're not independent. Because W(2) is W(1) plus an independent increment. So their covariance is 1.

So, Var(X) = Var(W(1)) + Var(W(2)) + 2*1.

Which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So yes, correct.

So X is N(0,5). So, to find P(X > 2).

Which is P(Z > 2/sqrt(5)) = P(Z > 0.8944).

Looking up in the standard normal table, z=0.89: 0.8133, z=0.90: 0.8413. Wait, but 0.8944 is between 0.89 and 0.90. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the normal CDF at 2/sqrt(5):

I can use a calculator or a computational tool to find this. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation.

But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can use an online table.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the value. Let me think, 2/sqrt(5) is approximately 0.8944.

So using a standard normal table, z=0.89 is 0.8133; z=0.90 is 0.8413.

The difference between z=0.89 and 0.90 is 0.01 in z, which corresponds to a change of 0.8413 - 0.8133 = 0.028 in the CDF.

Wait, wait, no, that's the CDF values. So between 0.89 and 0.90, the CDF increases from 0.8133 to 0.8413, which is a change of about 0.028 over a z-increase of 0.01.

So for a z of 0.8944, which is between 0.89 and 0.90 by 0.0044.

So the increase from 0.89 to 0.8944 is 0.0044 / 0.01 = 0.44 of the interval. So 0.44 * 0.028 = 0.0123.

So the CDF at 0.8944 is 0.8133 + 0.0123 = 0.8256.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.8944 is higher than 0.89, so the CDF should increase. So 0.8133 + 0.0123 is 0.8256. So 1-P(Z ≤ 0.8944) = 1 - 0.8256 = 0.1744.

Wait, that's approximately 0.1744. Hmm, but that's 0.1744, which is about 0.174.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.186, which is a bit higher. Option F is 0.368, which is higher, but that's more than 1/2. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the variance. Because perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the sum W(1) + W(2) is actually W(1) + (W(2) - W(1)) + W(1) = W(2) + W(1), which is the same as X. So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is that W(1) + W(2) is not W(2), but perhaps the question is to compute P(W(1) + W(2) > 2). So perhaps I should think of this as a sum of two normal variables.

Alternatively, perhaps a mistake is made in the variance calculation.

Wait, another approach: X = W(1) + W(2). Since W(1) and W(2) are independent, but wait, no, they're not. So their covariance is 1, so the variance is 1 + 2 + 2*1 =5. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Because the problem is phrased as W(1) + W(2) > 2. So perhaps I'm supposed to model this differently.

Wait, maybe I should model X = W(1) + W(2). But W(1) is N(0,1), W(2) is N(0,2). So X is N(0,5). Therefore, P(X>2) is P(Z>2/sqrt(5)).

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the possible mistake of considering a different distribution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is to compute P(W(1) + W(2) > 2). So W(1) and W(2) are independent. Oh wait, wait, is that correct? No, they are not independent. Because W(2) = W(1) + (W(2) - W(1)). So W(2) is dependent on W(1). So they're dependent. So their covariance is 1, as I thought earlier.

So, the variance of X is 5.

Hmm. So the correct approach is as I did earlier: X is N(0,5), so P(X>2) = P(Z> 2/sqrt(5)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2/sqrt(5) precisely. Let me compute sqrt(5) = 2.2360679775. So 2 / 2.2360679775 ≈ 0.894427191.

So, the Z-score is approximately 0.8944.

Looking up this in the standard normal table, the CDF at z=0.8944 is 0.8133 plus a small increment.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator for more precision. Let me think, perhaps I can use the inverse of the standard normal CDF.

But without a calculator, perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, let me think that for z=0.89, the CDF is 0.8133. For z=0.8944, which is 0.0044 higher than 0.89.

The derivative of the CDF at z is the PDF at z, which is 1/sqrt(2π) e^{-z²/2}.

At z=0.89, the PDF is 1/sqrt(2π) * e^{-(0.89)^2 /2}.

Compute (0.89)^2: 0.7921. Divided by 2: 0.39605.

e^{-0.39605} is approximately 0.673.

So the PDF is 1/(2.5066) * 0.673 ≈ (0.399) * 0.673 ≈ 0.268.

So the rate of change of the CDF at z=0.89 is approximately 0.268 per unit z.

So, for a small delta z (0.0044), the change in CDF is approximately 0.268 * 0.0044 ≈ 0.001179.

So, the CDF at z=0.8944 is approximately 0.8133 + 0.001179 ≈ 0.8145.

So, P(Z>0.8944) = 1 - 0.8145 = 0.1855, approximately 0.186.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.186, so that's probably the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the Brownian motion \( W(t) \), which is a standard Brownian motion with \( W(t) \sim N(0, t) \). We need to find \( P(W(1) + W(2) > 2) \).

1. **Identify the sum of Brownian motions**: Let \( X = W(1) + W(2) \). Since \( W(1) \) and \( W(2) \) are jointly normal with mean 0 and variances 1 and 2, respectively, we compute their covariance:
   - \( \text{Cov}(W(1), W(2)) = \min(1, 2) = 1 \).
   - The variance of \( X \) is:
     \[
     \text{Var}(X) = \text{Var}(W(1)) + \text{Var}(W(2)) + 2 \cdot \text{Cov}(W(1), W(2)) = 1 + 2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 5.
     \]
   - Thus, \( X \sim N(0, 5) \).

2. **Standardize the normal variable**: To find \( P(X > 2) \), we standardize \( X \):
   \[
   Z = \frac{X - \mu_X}{\sigma_X} = \frac{X - 0}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{X}{\sqrt{5}}.
   \]
   We need \( P(X > 2) = P\left(Z > \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right) \).

3. **Compute the threshold**: Calculate \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \):
   \[
   \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \approx \frac{2}{2.23607} \approx 0.8944.
   \]

4. **Find the probability using the standard normal distribution**: Using the standard normal table, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at \( z = 0.8944 \) is approximately 0.8133. Thus:
   \[
   P\left(Z > 0.8944\right) = 1 - 0.8133 \approx 0.1867.
   \]

5. **Match the result to the options**: The computed probability \( 0.1867 \) is closest to option D (\( 0.186 \)).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: D**
