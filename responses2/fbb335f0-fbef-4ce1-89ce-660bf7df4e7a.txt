Okay, so I've got this question about the OLS estimator and its standard errors. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about four statements (i to iv) and which are true about the standard error of the slope coefficient. The options are A to J, each a combination of these statements.

First, I remember that the standard error (SE) of the OLS estimator is related to the variance of the error term, which I think is denoted as sigma squared (σ²) or something similar. So, the SE depends on σ².

Statement (i): The standard error will be positively related to the residual variance. Hmm. Residual variance is σ², so if σ² increases, SE should increase. So yes, positive relationship. So (i) is true.

Statement (ii): The standard error will be negatively related to the dispersion of observations on the explanatory variable about their mean. Dispersion refers to how spread out the X values are around their mean. If X is more spread out, does that affect SE? I think SE depends on the variance of X. Wait, the formula for SE is σ * sqrt(1/n + (sum of squares of residuals)/(sum of squares of X)). Or wait, the standard error for the slope is σ * sqrt(1/(sum (x_i - x̄)^2)) where x̄ is the mean of X. So if the dispersion (sum of squares) increases, the denominator increases, so 1 over that decreases, making SE smaller. So higher dispersion (X is more spread out) would mean lower SE, which is a negative relationship. So (ii) is true.

Statement (iii): The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size. Well, SE is inversely proportional to the square root of n, because in the formula sqrt(1/n) appears. So as n increases, SE decreases. So the SE is negatively related to n. So (iii) is true.

Statement (iv): The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate. I think that's correct. The standard error is a measure of the variability of the estimator, so it reflects how much the coefficient estimate might vary if we took different samples. So (iv) is true.

So if all four statements are true, then which option fits? Let's look at the options.

The options are:
A: (i), (ii), (iv)
B: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)
C: (i), (ii), (iii)
D: (iii) and (iv)
E: (ii) and (iii)
F: (i) and (iv)
G: (i), (iii), (iv)
H: (i), (iii), (iv)
Wait, no, H says (i), (iii), (iv) only. Wait the initial options list G as (i), (iii), (iv) only.

Wait, what about option H? The user wrote H: (i), (iii), (iv) only. Let me check.

The options are:

A: (i), (ii), (iv) only
B: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)
C: (i), (ii), (iii) only
D: (iii) and (iv) only
E: (ii) and (iii) only
F: (i) and (iv) only
G: (i), (iii), (iv) only
H: (i), (iii), (iv) only
Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote:

Options:

A: (i), (ii), (iv) only
B: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)
C: (i), (ii), (iii) only
D: (iii) and (iv) only
E: (ii) and (iii) only
F: (i) and (iv) only
G: (i), (iii), (iv) only
H: (i), (iii), (iv) only
I: (ii) and (iv) only
J: (ii), (iii), (iv) only

So, the correct statements are (i), (ii), (iii), (iv). Wait, but I thought (iv) is correct, and (i), (ii), (iii) are correct. So the four statements are all true. But none of the options seems to include all four. Wait, wait, looking again. Wait, the options are A to J, each a combination. Let me check each option.

Looking at the options:

A: (i), (ii), (iv) only → missing (iii)
B: all four → correct.
C: (i), (ii), (iii) → missing (iv)
D: (iii) and (iv) → missing (i) and (ii)
E: (ii) and (iii) → missing (i) and (iv)
F: (i) and (iv) → missing (ii) and (iii)
G: (i), (iii), (iv) → missing (ii)
H: (i), (iii), (iv) → missing (ii)
Wait, no, that can't be. Looking again, the option G is (i), (iii), (iv) only. Option H is the same.

Wait, no, the options are A to J, each option is:

A: (i), (ii), (iv) only → includes (i), (ii), (iv) but not (iii). So (iii) is not included.

B: all four → includes (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) → correct.

C: (i), (ii), (iii) only → missing (iv)

D: (iii) and (iv) → misses (i) and (ii)

E: (ii) and (iii) → misses (i) and (iv)

F: (i) and (iv) → misses (ii) and (iii)

G: (i), (iii), (iv) only → misses (ii)

H: (i), (iii), (iv) only → same as G? Wait, no. Looking at the user's response, H is (i), (iii), (iv) only. But in the list given, option H is (i), (iii), (iv) only. So option B is (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) → which includes all four.

Wait but the user's options may differ. Wait, the initial problem statement shows how the options are presented, but the user's question shows the options as from A to J, each an option.

So the correct four statements are (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), but looking at the available options, option B is (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) only. But option B is the fourth option, and the user's options are:

A: (i), (ii), (iv) only
B: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) only
C: (i), (ii), (iii) only
D: (iii) and (iv) only
E: (ii) and (iii) only
F: (i) and (iv) only
G: (i), (iii), (iv) only
H: (i), (iii), (iv) only
I: (ii) and (iv) only
J: (ii), (iii), (iv) only

Wait, option B includes all four. So the correct answer is option B, which includes all four statements.

Wait, earlier I thought all four were correct. But looking back, are all four statements correct?

Wait, statement (ii): The SE is negatively related to the dispersion of X around the mean. Because σ is the standard deviation, which is the square root of the dispersion. The standard error formula includes sigma squared multiplied by (1/(sum (x_i - x̄)^2)). So as the dispersion increases (sum of squares increases), the denominator increases, so overall SE decreases. So yes, negatively related. So (ii) is correct.

Thus, all four statements: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) are correct. So the correct option must be B, which includes all four.

To determine which statements about the OLS estimator's standard error are true, let's analyze each statement:

1. **Statement (i):** The standard error is positively related to the residual variance.  
   - Residual variance is denoted as \( \sigma^2 \). As \( \sigma^2 \) increases, the standard error increases. Thus, this statement is true.

2. **Statement (ii):** The standard error is negatively related to the dispersion of observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value.  
   - Dispersion is measured by the sum of squared deviations from the mean (\( \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \)). A higher dispersion increases the denominator in the standard error formula, reducing the standard error. Therefore, this statement is true.

3. **Statement (iii):** The standard error is negatively related to the sample size.  
   - The standard error decreases as the sample size \( n \) increases because it is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{n} \). Thus, this statement is true.

4. **Statement (iv):** The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate.  
   - The standard error reflects the variability of the estimator, indicating how precise the coefficient estimate is. Hence, this statement is true.

Since all four statements are true, the correct option is:

**B: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) only**
