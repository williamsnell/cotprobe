Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the horsepower developed by a shaft. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the problem says: a shaft with a 1-inch diameter, a standard solid shaft, designed to transmit power at 150 rpm, and has a shear stress of 8000 psi. I need to find the horsepower it develops.

Wait, shear stress. I think shear stress is related to torsion. Oh right, when a shaft is subjected to torque, it causes shear stress. The formula for maximum shear stress in a solid shaft is (T * r)/J. Where T is torque, r is the radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, what's J for a solid shaft? Oh right, J is (π * d^4)/32. Because for a solid circular shaft, the polar moment is J = (π d^4)/(32). And the radius r is half of the diameter, so for 1 inch, r is 0.5 inches.

So, the shear stress formula is τ = (T * r)/J. Plugging in J, τ = (T * r) * (32)/(π d^4). Wait, let me rearrange that to solve for T. T = (τ * π d^4) / (32 r). But since r is d/2, substituting that in gives T = (τ * π d^4) / (32 * (d/2)) ) = τ * π d^3 / 16.

Wait, let me double-check that. The formula for maximum shear stress is τ_max = (T * r) / J. J for a solid shaft is (π d^4)/32. So substituting, τ_max = (T * r) / (π d^4 / 32) ) = (32 T r) / (π d^4). Solving for T: T = (τ_max * π d^4) / (32 r).

Since r = d/2, substitute that in: T = (τ_max * π d^4) / (32 * (d/2)) ) = (τ_max * π d^4) / (16 d) ) = (τ_max * π d^3) / 16.

So T = (π * 8000 psi * (1 inch)^3 ) / 16. Let me compute that.

First, π is approximately 3.1416. So 3.1416 * 8000 = about 25132. Then divide by 16: 25132 /16 ≈ 1570.75. So T is approximately 1570.75 pound-inches.

Wait, but horsepower is related to power, which is torque times angular velocity. So power in horsepower can be calculated with the formula:

Power (hp) = ( Torque (lb-in) * Angular Velocity (radians per second) ) / 33000.

Wait, why 33000? Oh right, because 1 horsepower is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, so 550 * 12 = 6600 lb-ft/s. And 1 lb-ft is 1 lb-in * (1/12) ft, since 1 foot is 12 inches. So 1 lb-ft is (1 lb-in * 1/12) = 1/12 lb-in*ft/s. So 550 ft-lb/s = 550 *12 lb-in/s. Wait, no, that's in ft-lb. Maybe I should think in terms of converting lb-in to hp.

Alternatively, the basic relation is 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s. So 1 hp = 550 lb-ft/s. But 1 lb-ft is equal to 1 lb * 1 ft. But we can convert lb-ft to lb-in by multiplying by 12, so 1 lb-ft = 1 lb * 12 in. So 1 lb-ft = 12 lb-in. So 550 ft-lb/s = 550 *12 lb-in/s = 6600 lb-in/s. Therefore, 1 hp = 6600 lb-in/s.

So the power in horsepower is ( Torque (lb-in) * angular velocity (radians/s) ) / 6600.

Wait, let me get the units right. So the formula for power in horsepower is:

Power (hp) = ( Torque (lb-in) * Angular velocity (radians/sec) ) / (33000) ?

Wait, no, let me think. Because 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s, and 1 ft-lb = 12 lb-in. So 1 hp = 550 * 12 = 6600 lb-in/s.

So power in horsepower is (Torque in lb-in * angular velocity in rad/s) / (33000). Because 1 hp = 33000 lb-in/s. Wait, no. Let me do the unit conversion.

Wait, 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/s. Since 1 lb-ft = 12 lb-in (because 1 ft = 12 inches), 1 lb-ft = 12 lb-in. So 550 ft-lb/s = 550 *12 lb-in/s = 6600 lb-in/s. So 1 hp = 6600 lb-in/s.

So to get power in hp, divide by 6600. So Power (hp) = (T * ω) / 6600, where T is torque in lb-in and ω is angular velocity in rad/s.

Alternatively, since 1 hp = 550 lb-ft/s = 550 *12 lb-in/s = 6600 lb-in/s.

So the formula is correct. So first, compute the torque T in lb-in, then find the angular velocity in rad/s, and plug into the formula.

So let's calculate T first. T = (π * 8000 psi * d^3 ) / 16. Wait, d is 1 inch. So d^3 is 1^3 =1 in^3.

So T = (3.1416 * 8000 * 1 ) / 16. Let me compute that.

3.1416 *8000 = 25132.8. Divided by 16 is 25132.8 /16 = 1570.799 lb-in. So T ≈ 1570.8 lb-in.

Next, find the angular velocity ω. The shaft is rotating at 150 rpm. So 150 revolutions per minute. To get rad/s, we multiply by 2π (since one revolution is 2π radians) and divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).

So ω = 150 * 2π /60. Let's compute that.

150 *2 =300. 300 /60 =5. So 5 * π ≈ 15.70796 rad/s.

So ω ≈15.708 rad/s.

Now, compute power in hp: (T * ω) /6600.

So T=1570.8 lb-in, ω=15.708 rad/s.

1570.8 *15.708 = let's compute that. Hmm, 1570 *15 is 23550, 1570 *0.708 is about 1570 *0.7=1100, 1570 *0.008=12.56. So 1100+12.56=1112.56. So total approx 23550 + 1112.56=24662.56. So about 24662.56 (lb-in * rad/s).

Wait, but wait, 1570.8 *15.708 is actually 1570.8 *15.708. Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me approximate 1570.8 *15.708. Let me think:

1570.8 *15 = 23562.

1570.8 *0.708 = let's compute 1570.8 *0.7=1099.56, 1570.8 *0.008=12.5664. So total for 0.708 is 1099.56 +12.5664=1112.1264.

So total is 23562 +1112.1264 = 24674.1264 (lb-in * rad/s).

Now divide by 6600 to get hp.

24674.1264 /6600 ≈ Approximately 3.735 hp.

Wait, but let me do the division more accurately.

6600 goes into 24674 about 3.735 times because 6600 *3=19800. 24674-19800=4874. 6600 *0.7=4620. So 3.7 gives 6600*3.7=24420. 24674-24420=254. So 254/6600 is approximately 0.038. So total is about 3.738 hp. Approximately 3.74 hp.

Wait, but I thought the options include option E as 3.74 hp. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations because sometimes when you're in a hurry, you can make a mistake.

Wait, the formula for power is (T * ω) /6600.

So, T = 1570.8 lb-in.

ω =15.708 rad/s.

Multiply them: 1570.8 *15.708 = let me do this more accurately.

1570.8 *15 = 23562.

1570.8 *0.708.

Wait, 1570.8 *0.7 is 1099.56, 1570.8 *0.008 =12.5664. So total is 1099.56 +12.5664=1112.1264.

So total T*ω is 23562 + 1112.1264 = 24674.1264.

Divide by6600:

24674.1264 /6600.

Let me compute 24674.1264 ÷6600.

Well, 6600 x3 =19800. 3*6600=19800.

24674-19800=4874.

4874 /6600 ≈0.737.

Wait but 6600 *3.7 = 24420. 24674-24420=254. 254 /6600≈0.038.

So total is 3.738 hp, which is approximately 3.74 hp.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.74 hp. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thought: Did I calculate the shear stress correctly? I used τ = T * r / J. J is (π d^4)/32.

Let me recheck that.

Yes, for a solid shaft, the polar moment J is (π d^4)/(32).

So r is d/2. Plugging into τ = (T * r) / J,

τ = (T*(d/2)) / (π d^4 /32) ) → T*(16 d) / (π d^4 * 2) → Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, τ = (T * r ) / J.

J = (π d^4)/32. So substituting:

τ = (T * (d/2)) / (π d^4 /32) = ( T d / 2 ) * (32)/(π d^4 ) → (16 T )/( π d^3 ).

So τ = (16 T )/( π d^3 ) → T = (τ π d^3 )/(16).

Which is exactly what I used.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think: for a solid shaft, the maximum shear stress is given by τ = (8 T )/( π d^3 ). Wait, wait, is that correct? Because I recall another formula: τ_max = (2 T )/( π d^3 ). Wait, now I'm confused. Let me derive it.

Another approach. For a circular shaft, the shear stress τ at radius r is given by τ = (T r) / J. So J is (π d^4 )/32.

So τ = (T r) * 32 / (π d^4 ). But r = d/2. So τ = (T (d/2) * 32 ) / (π d^4 ) → (16 T )/( π d^3 ). So τ = (16 T )/( π d^3 ).

So solving for T: T = (τ π d^3 ) / 16. Which is what I used.

But wait, another formula that I've seen elsewhere is τ_max = (16 T )/( π d^3 ). So if that's the case, then perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, so let me think. If τ = (16 T )/( π d^3 ), then T = (τ π d^3 )/(16). So that's correct.

But wait, let's think about whether that's correct. Let me use a simple example. Suppose T is 100 lb-in, d = 1 in. Then τ is (16 *100 )/( π *1 ) ≈ 509.3 psi? That seems high, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but let's think about a solid circular shaft. For T = 100 lb-in, d=1 in.

So J = (π *1^4)/32 = π/32 in^4.

r = 0.5 in.

τ = (100 * 0.5 ) / ( π/32 ) → (50 ) * (32/π ) ≈ 50 *10.19 ≈509.6 psi.

Hmm, that seems high, but I think it's correct.

But wait, let's think about the other formula. Another formula I've heard is τ_max = (2 T )/( π d^3 ). Let me see. Let's calculate with T=100.

Then τ = (2 *100 )/( π *1 ) ≈ 63.66 psi. Which is lower than the 509.6 I just got. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive τ_max.

For a solid shaft:

The shear stress at radius r is τ = (T r ) / J.

J = π d^4 /32.

So τ = (T r ) *32/(π d^4 ).

Since r = d/2, τ = (T (d/2) *32 )/( π d^4 ) ) = (16 T )/( π d^3 ).

So that's correct. So that formula is accurate.

So why the discrepancy with the alternative formula? Because I think I might have confused the formula with another shear stress scenario.

Therefore, I shouldn't use the alternative formula, but stick with τ = (16 T )/( π d^3 ), hence T = (τ π d^3 ) /16.

So my initial calculation was correct. So T is approximately 1570.8 lb-in.

Therefore, the power is about 3.74 hp.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.74 hp. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the horsepower developed by the shaft, we start by determining the torque \( T \) using the formula for maximum shear stress in a solid shaft:

\[
\tau = \frac{T \cdot r}{J}
\]

where:
- \( \tau \) is the maximum shear stress (\( 8000 \, \text{psi} \)),
- \( r \) is the radius (\( 0.5 \, \text{in} \)),
- \( J \) is the polar moment of inertia for a solid shaft, given by \( J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32} \) (\( d = 1 \, \text{in} \)).

Substituting \( J = \frac{\pi}{32} \, \text{in}^4 \) and \( r = 0.5 \, \text{in} \), we solve for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{\tau \cdot \pi \cdot d^3}{16}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
T = \frac{8000 \cdot \pi \cdot 1^3}{16} = \frac{8000 \cdot \pi}{16} \approx 1570.799 \, \text{lb-in}.
\]

Next, we calculate the angular velocity \( \omega \) in radians per second. The shaft rotates at \( 150 \, \text{rpm} \):

\[
\omega = 150 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{60} = 15.708 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

Finally, we calculate the power in horsepower using the formula:

\[
P = \frac{T \cdot \omega}{6600}
\]

Substituting \( T = 1570.8 \, \text{lb-in} \) and \( \omega = 15.708 \, \text{rad/s} \):

\[
P = \frac{1570.8 \cdot 15.708}{6600} \approx \frac{24674.1}{6600} \approx 3.74 \, \text{hp}.
\]

Thus, the horsepower developed by the shaft is approximately \( 3.74 \, \text{hp} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
