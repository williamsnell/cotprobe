Okay, so I've got this property tax question to solve. Let me try to think it through. The question is asking for the property tax on a house with an assessed value of $3,250, and the tax rate is 2.351%. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on tax calculations, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that property taxes are calculated based on a percentage of the assessed value of the property. So the formula is pretty straightforward: Tax = (Assessed Value) × (Tax Rate). But wait, do I need to convert the tax rate from a percentage to a decimal? Oh yeah, right, to do that, I divide by 100. So 2.351% would be 0.02351 in decimal form.

Let me write that down. Tax = 3250 × 0.02351. Hmm, I should make sure I multiply correctly. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 

Calculating each part: 3250 multiplied by 0.02 is 65. Then 3250 multiplied by 0.00351. Wait, maybe it's easier to break it down. Let's calculate 3250 × 0.02351 directly.

Alternatively, I can break it into parts. 0.02 is 2%, so 3250 × 0.02 = 65. Then 0.00351 is 0.351%, which is 351 per 1000. So 3250 × 0.351 = ?

Wait, no, maybe it's better to compute 3250 × 0.00351. Let me do that step by step. 3250 × 0.003 is 9.75. Then 3250 × 0.00051 is... let's see. 3250 × 0.0005 is 1.625, and 3250 ×0.00001 is 0.0325. So adding those gives 1.625 + 0.0325 = 1.6575. So total for 0.00351 is 9.75 +1.6575 = 11.4075. 

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 0.02351 is 0.02 + 0.00351, so 65 +11.4075 equals 76.4075. So the tax would be approximately $76.41. Let me check the options. Option C is $76.41. So that's the answer.

Wait, did I do that correctly? Let me recheck the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator approach.

3250 x 0.02351.

Another approach: 3250 × 0.02 = 65, 3250 × 0.00351.

Wait, 0.00351 is 351 ten-thousandths. So 3250 × 351 = let's compute that. Wait no, 3250 × 0.00351 is same as 3250 × 351 × 1e-6. But perhaps breaking it down:

Compute 3250 × 351:

3250 * 300 = 975,000
3250 *50=162,500
3250 *1=3,250
Total = 975,000 + 162,500 = 1,137,500 +3,250 = 1,140,750.

Multiply by 1e-6: 1,140,750 * 0.000001 = 1.14075.

So 3250 × 0.00351 = 1.14075.

So the total tax is 65 + 1.14075 = 66.14075. Wait, that's about $66.14, but that's not matching the previous result of $76.41. Hmm, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me redo the calculation.

Wait, 3250 × 0.02351. Let's compute it as:

3250 × 0.02 = 65.

3250 × 0.00351 is:

0.00351 is 351/100000.

So 3250 × 351 = ?

Let me compute 3250 × 350 first.

3250 × 350 = 3250 * 35 * 10.

3250 ×35: 3250 ×30 = 97,500; 3250 ×5=16,250. Total 97,500 +16,250 =113,750. Multiply by 10 → 1,137,500.

Then add 3250 ×1 =3,250 → 1,137,500 +3,250 = 1,140,750.

Now, 3250 × 0.00351 = 1,140,750 × 1e-6 → 1.14075.

Adding to the 65 from before, that's 65 +1.14075 = 66.14075, which is approximately $66.14. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it correctly. Let me try another way.

Let me calculate 3250 × 2.351% step by step.

2.351% = 2.351 per 100, so 3250 × (2.351/100) = 3250 × 0.02351.

Let me compute 3250 × 2.351.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 3250 × 2.351.

Wait, 3250 × 2 = 6500.

3250 × 0.351 = ?

Let me compute 3250 ×0.3 = 975.

3250 ×0.05 =162.5.

3250 ×0.001=3.25.

So 0.351 is 0.3 +0.05 +0.001.

So 975 +162.5 =1137.5 +3.25=1140.75.

So 3250 × 2.351 = 6500 +1140.75 = 7640.75.

Wait, but that would be 3250 ×2.351 =7640.75, but wait, that can't be right because 3250 × 2.351% is 76.4075 dollars, not 7640.75.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the decimal places. Because 2.351% is 0.02351, not 2.351. So 3250 × 0.02351 = ?

Ah, I see. So 3250 × 0.02 is 65, 3250 ×0.00351 is 1.14075. So adding them gives 66.14075, which is approximately $66.14.

But wait, the options are all higher than that. The options are:

A: $64.12

B: $83.69

C: $76.41

D: $68.24

E: $74.58

F: $80.35

G: $81.23

H: $78.94

I: $72.51

J: $69.75

Hmm, none of these are 66.14. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should compute 3250 × 0.02351 using another method. Let's use the standard multiplication approach.

3250 × 0.02351.

Let me write it out:

3250 × 0.02351.

I can think of 0.02351 as 2351 ×1e-6.

But perhaps using another approach. Alternatively, perhaps doing it in fractions.

Wait, maybe I should compute 3250 × 0.02351.

Let me do 3250 × 0.02 = 65.

Then 3250 × 0.0035 = ?

3250 ×0.001 is 3.25. So 3250 ×0.003 is 9.75.

3250 ×0.0005 is 1.625.

So 3250 ×0.0035 = 9.75 +1.625 = 11.375.

Then 3250 ×0.00001 =0.0325.

So 3250 ×0.00351 = 11.375 +0.0325= 11.4075.

Now, adding the 0.02 part: 65 +11.4075=76.4075.

Which is approximately $76.41, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought 3250 ×2.351% was 76.41. But 2.351% is 0.02351, so 3250 ×0.02351 is indeed 76.41.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, when I thought 3250 ×2.351 equals 7640, that was a mistake. Because 2.351 is a larger number than 2.351%. Oh wait, no, because 2.351% is 0.02351. So 3250 ×0.02351 is 76.41.

So the correct answer should be C: $76.41.
</think>

The property tax is calculated as assessed value multiplied by the tax rate. The assessed value is $3,250, and the tax rate is 2.351%, which converts to 0.02351 in decimal form. 

Tax = 3250 × 0.02351 = 76.4075, which rounds to $76.41. 

Answer: C: $76.41
