Okay, so I've got this question about rings and their characteristics. The question is asking for the characteristic of the ring Z × Z. Hmm, I remember that the characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n times the multiplicative identity equals zero. If no such n exists, the characteristic is zero. 

Wait, right. So for the ring Z (the integers), the characteristic is 1 because 1*1=1, 2*1=2, and so on, but since in Z, 1 is the multiplicative identity, and 1*1=1, which isn't zero unless we're modding out by 1. So for Z, characteristic is 1.

But this question is about the product ring Z × Z. I think the characteristic of a product ring is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of the individual rings. So if both are Z, each has characteristic 1. So LCM of 1 and 1 is 1. That would mean the characteristic of Z × Z is 1. 

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. The characteristic of a product ring A × B is equal to the least common multiple of the characteristics of A and B, provided that both rings have finite characteristics. Since both Z and Z have characteristic 1, the LCM of 1 and 1 is 1. So the characteristic of Z × Z should be 1. 

Looking at the options: A is 4, B 10, C 12, D 20, E 1, F 30, G 0, H 2, I 3, J 5. So option E is 1, which matches my reasoning. 

Wait, but another thought: sometimes people get confused between the characteristic of the ring and something else, like the exponent for additive order. But in this case, since each component in Z has characteristic 1, I think the product ring's characteristic is indeed 1.

The characteristic of the ring Z × Z is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of each component ring. Since both Z and Z have a characteristic of 1, the LCM is 1.
