Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the number of coulombs of positive charge in 250 cm³ of neutral water. Hmm, okay. So, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Each atom has a certain number of protons, which gives the positive charge.

Wait, the hint says a hydrogen atom has one proton and an oxygen atom has eight. So, each water molecule has a hydrogen, an oxygen, and two hydrogen atoms attached. Wait, no, let me think. Each water molecule is H2O, right? So that's two hydrogen and one oxygen. So each water molecule has 2 + 8 (from O) protons? No, wait, each oxygen has 8 protons. So each H2O has 2 H and 8 O? Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, an H has 1 proton, O has 8. So each water molecule has 2 H (so 2 protons) and 8 O (so 8 protons). So total 10 protons per water molecule. Oh, but wait, that's assuming each H has one proton and O has eight. So each H2O has 2 H and 8 O, so 10 protons in total per molecule. So, each molecule contributes 10 coulombs of positive charge because each proton has a charge of +e, where e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.6e-19 coulombs.

So to find the total charge, I need to find how many water molecules are in 250 cm³ of water, then multiply by 10, then by the charge per proton.

Wait wait, but wait. What's the density of water? I think it's about 1 gram per cm³. So 250 cm³ would be 250 grams of water. So the number of moles of water is mass divided by molar mass. Molar mass of water is about 18 g/mol (1 H2O is 2 H (each 1 g/mol) and 16 O (16 g/mol) → 18 g/mol). So 250 grams / 18 g/mol is approximately 13.89 moles. So the number of molecules is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number, which is about 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

Wait, 13.89 mol * 6.022e23 = approx 8.36e24 molecules.

Each molecule has 10 protons (2 H and 8 O), so total protons are 8.36e24 *10 = 8.36e25 protons.

Each proton contributes +1.6e-19 C. So total charge is 8.36e25 * 1.6e-19 C.

Let me compute that: 8.36e25 * 1.6e-19 = (8.36 *1.6) * 1e6. 8.36 *1.6 is about 13.376. So 13.376e6 coulombs, which is 1.3376e7 coulombs. Looking at the options, option A is 1.3e7, which is close. Option B is 7.8e6, which is about half of that. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of protons per molecule. Let me check again. Each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 2 H and 8 O. So 2+8=10 protons per molecule. That seems correct.

Wait, 250 cm³ is 250 mL. Water's density is 1g/cm³, so 250g. Moles of H2O would be 250 / 18 = 13.888... mol.

Molecules: 13.888 * 6.022e23 = approximately 8.36e24.

Each molecule contributes 10 protons, so 8.36e24 *10=8.36e25 protons.

Charge per proton is 1.6e-19 C, so total is 8.36e25 * 1.6e-19 = (8.36 *1.6) *1e6. 8.36 *1.6 is 13.376. So 13.376e6, which is 1.3376e7 C. So option A is 1.3e7, which is the closest. But wait, I see another possibility. Did I forget something?

Wait, another thought. Maybe the number of protons per molecule is not 10, but perhaps because oxygen has 8, and each H2O has 2 H. So 2 + 8 = 10 yes. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the number of positive charges. So yeah, 10 protons per molecule.

Wait, but another approach: find the number of moles of water, then multiply by Avogadro's number and the number of protons per molecule, then multiply by elementary charge.

So, moles of H2O: 250 cm³ is 250g. Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 250 /18 = about 13.89 mol.

Number of H2O molecules: 13.89 * 6e23 ≈ 8.33e24.

Each molecule has 10 protons → 8.33e24 *10 = 8.33e25 protons.

Each proton is 1.6e-19 C.

Total charge: 8.33e25 * 1.6e-19 = 8.33 *1.6 * 1e6.

8.33 * 1.6: 8 *1.6 is 12.8; 0.33*1.6 is about 0.528. So 12.8+0.528=13.328. So 13.328e6 C → 1.3328e7 C. So about 1.3×10^7 C, which is option A.

Another way: perhaps I should think of the charge per molecule. So each H2O has 10 protons, each contributing +e. So 10e C per molecule.

So charge per molecule is 10 * 1.6e-19 = 1.6e-18 C.

Number of molecules is 250 cm³ = 250 mL = 250g. Moles is 250/18 ≈ 13.888. Molecules: 13.888 * 6e23 ≈ 8.33e24.

Total charge: 8.33e24 * 1.6e-18 C.

Compute that: 8.33e24 *1.6e-18 = (8.33 *1.6) * 1e6.

8.33 *1.6 = 13.328 → 1.3328e7 C. So same as before.

So the closest option is A: 1.3e7 C. So the answer should be option A.

To calculate the number of coulombs of positive charge in 250 cm³ of neutral water, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the number of moles of water**:  
   The density of water is approximately 1 g/cm³, so 250 cm³ of water weighs 250 grams.  
   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{250}{18} \approx 13.89 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of water molecules**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}\)):  
   \[
   \text{Number of H}_2\text{O molecules} = 13.89 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 8.36 \times 10^{24} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

3. **Determine the number of protons per water molecule**:  
   Each hydrogen atom has 1 proton, and each oxygen atom has 8 protons. Water (H₂O) contains 2 hydrogens and 1 oxygen:  
   \[
   \text{Protons per H}_2\text{O} = 2 + 8 = 10.
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of protons in 250 cm³ of water**:  
   \[
   \text{Total protons} = 8.36 \times 10^{24} \times 10 = 8.36 \times 10^{25} \, \text{protons}.
   \]

5. **Convert protons to charge**:  
   Each proton has a charge of \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\).  
   \[
   \text{Total charge} = 8.36 \times 10^{25} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 1.3376 \times 10^7 \, \text{C}.
   \]

6. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest value to \(1.3376 \times 10^7 \, \text{C}\) is \(1.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{C}\), which corresponds to option A.
