Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about least-squares regression with regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about what happens to the testing error when we increase the regularisation parameter λ. The options are A to J, each making a different statement. I remember that regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function. There are different types, like L1 and L2 regularization, but the key idea is that increasing λ adds more penalty, which should make the model simpler.

In least-squares regression without regularization, increasing λ would make the model less likely to fit the noise, so it would have higher variance but lower bias. That's good for generalization, which affects the test error. So, without regularization, when λ is high, the model might perform worse on test data because it's too complex.

But wait, the question says that the optimisation can be done exactly. Hmm, not exactly sure what that means, but maybe it's a way of ensuring that the solution is found without approximation errors, which is important for the model's behavior.

So, if we're using exact optimization with higher λ, the model should have more regularization. That should reduce the variance, leading to better generalization, which would lower the test error. Because higher bias and lower variance, the model doesn't overfit. So, the testing error should decrease.

Looking at the options:

A: no effect. Unlikely because regularization affects it.

B: always increase testing error. I don't think so. More regularization would lower it.

C: may decrease or increase. Hmm, not sure. Could it sometimes increase? Maybe if it's not just about bias and variance, but I'm not sure.

D: will never increase training error. Yes, because regularization makes the model simpler, so training error would decrease. So D might not be correct.

E: always decrease testing error. That sounds correct.

F: may decrease or increase the training error. No, since higher λ reduces the model's complexity, training error should decrease, so F is incorrect.

G: won't have any effect on training error. No, because it affects both, so G is wrong.

H: won't decrease testing error. No, because regularization should lower it, so H is incorrect.

I: won't decrease training error. No, training error also decreases.

J: won't increase. So, J says that the training error won't increase. That's not true because higher λ reduces it.

Wait, but the question is about the testing error. So what's the relationship between training and testing errors when λ increases.

Wait, the options are about the testing error's effect. So, when λ increases, the model becomes more regularized, reducing both bias and variance. So, the model should have lower variance, which means it's less likely to overfit. So, the test error, which is the model's performance on unseen data, should decrease.

Looking at the options: E says testing error will always decrease, which makes sense. So E is correct.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options. The question is about what happens to the testing error when λ increases. So, what options are correct.

The options are A to J, each talking about different aspects.

A: no effect → incorrect.

B: always increases → no.

C: may decrease or increase → maybe not, because I think it's a direct effect.

D: will never increase training error → correct.

E: always decrease → correct.

F: may decrease or increase training error → no.

G: no effect on training → no.

H: won't decrease → no.

I: won't decrease → no.

J: won't increase → correct.

Wait, H says, "will not decrease the testing error." So, the testing error would decrease, so H is wrong.

Wait, but the options are for the testing error's effect. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are about what the testing error does when λ increases.

So, when λ increases, testing error decreases. So, looking for which options say that.

Question options:

E: always decrease → correct.

H: will not decrease → incorrect.

J: will never increase → correct. So, when λ increases, testing error decreases. So, testing error will always decrease (E), and will never increase (J). But the question is about the testing error's effect.

Wait, the question is: increasing λ, what's the effect on testing error?

So, the options are about the effect on testing error. So, for testing error, when λ increases, it's always decreased, so E is correct and J is also correct.

But the options are single-answer. So, the question is whether the testing error will "will" have a certain effect.

Wait the question is: "increasing the value of the regularisation parameter λ the testing error." So, testing error will ... what. So, all options about the testing error.

Looking at the options, which one says that testing error will always decrease.

Option E: "will always decrease the testing error." That's correct. Option J says "will never increase the testing error." That's also correct.

Wait, but the options are independent; each is a separate statement. So, the question is, which statement correctly describes the effect of increasing λ on the testing error.

So, when λ increases, testing error decreases. So, the testing error is always going to decrease. So, E says it will always decrease, that's correct. J says it will never increase, which is also correct. But the options are single-answer. So, the answer should be E and J. But let's look at the options again.

Wait, the given options are from A to J. So the actual answer must be one of them.

Wait, but no, because the question is about which statement is true. So the correct answers are E and J. But the options don't have both. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking back:

E: will always decrease the testing error. → correct.

J: will never increase the testing error. → correct.

But the options are mutually exclusive? Or can the answer be both E and J? No, each option is a separate statement.

Wait, the question says 'increasing λ the testing error'. So, testing error will decrease. So, options E and J are both correct. But the options are individual statements; perhaps only E is correct, or perhaps J is not correct.

Wait, what does the question ask? It's a single choice, so perhaps the correct option is E or J.

Wait, the options are separate statements, but the correct answer is about the effect. For example, when λ increases, testing error decreases, so option E is correct. So, the correct answer is E.

But wait, what about the other options. Could λ affect training error? No, because higher λ reduces model complexity, so training error decreases. So option D is correct.

But the question is about testing error. So, for testing error, when λ increases, it decreases. So, option E says it will always decrease. So, E is correct.

Looking back, the question is about the effect on the testing error. So E is correct, J is correct as well, but only one option can be correct in the multiple choice.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct one is E, because when λ increases, testing error will always decrease. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I thought option J was also correct. Let me read the options again:

E: will always decrease the testing error.

J: will never increase the testing error.

So, both E and J say that testing error does something. But the way the question is phrased is, when λ increases, testing error ... what. So, testing error is always decreasing, so E is correct. J says it will never increase. Since testing error is always decreasing, it will never increase. So J is also correct. But looking at the options, only one can be selected.

Wait, but the multiple-choice options are separate. So, which of the options correctly describes the effect on testing error. So, the correct answer is E, because it's certain that testing error decreases when λ increases.

Wait, but what about J? If the testing error decreases, then J is correct as well. But the options are exclusive. So, the correct answer is E and J. But the available options don't allow for both, so perhaps I'm wrong somewhere.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me re-examine the options. The options are:

E: always decrease → correct.

J: will never increase → correct.

But the question is about the effect of increasing λ on testing error. So, both E and J are correct statements. However, the options are likely structured to have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about how regularization affects both training and testing error. Regularization makes the model more general, so the training error should decrease, which is correct. The testing error, which is the error on new data, should also decrease because the model is less likely to overfit. So, testing error decreases when λ increases.

So, for testing error, E is correct. J is also correct. But the options are separate so perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, no. Because the options are each a different statement. The question is asking, when λ is increased, what happens to the testing error. So, the correct answer is E. Because E is a correct statement, and J is also correct, but since the options are exclusive, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and J, but the options don't allow that. Let me recheck the options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: when you increase λ, your model becomes more regularized. So, lower variance, higher bias. Test error is the model's performance on the test set. So, with more regularization, the model's performance on the test set should improve (lower error). So, testing error decreases. So, E is correct.

But what about J? J says, will never increase the testing error. Since testing error is definitely decreasing, J is also correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps J is not the right answer. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the options again, J says, "will not increase the training error." That's not correct because training error decreases as λ increases. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about testing error. So, the correct answer is E: will always decrease.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only E is correct. Because J is about training error, which is correct as well, but the question is about testing error. So, the answer is E.

Wait, but wait, another angle: the effect on both training and testing. For testing error, when λ increases, testing error decreases. So, E is correct.

Wait, but in the options, E is correct and J is also correct. But the question is about the effect on testing error. So, E is correct, J is also correct. But the options don't have both as correct options. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the effect of increasing λ on testing error. So, the correct answer is E.

Wait, but let me think about what the options are.

The options are:

A: no effect on testing → incorrect.

B: always increase → incorrect.

C: may decrease or increase → perhaps possible.

D: no effect on training → correct.

E: always decrease → correct.

F: may decrease or increase training → no.

G: no effect on training → correct.

H: won't decrease → no.

I: won't decrease → no.

J: won't increase → correct.

So, options E and J are correct. But since each is a separate statement, perhaps the intended correct options are E and J. But the question is a single-answer multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is E.

But wait, no. Because in the question, the options are presented as separate possibilities, and the correct answer is one of them. So, the correct answer for the question is E, which says testing error will always decrease.

Wait, but what if the question is not about the effect on testing error, but about the relationship between training and testing errors. But the question is about testing error specifically.

So, the answer is E.
</think>

The question asks about the effect of increasing the regularisation parameter λ on the testing error in least-squares regression with regularization. Regularisation adds a penalty to the loss function, making the model simpler and reducing variance. This reduces the model's complexity, which lowers both bias and variance. As a result, the model becomes less likely to overfit, improving its generalization and reducing the testing error.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Increasing λ does not have no effect on testing error.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Testing error does not always increase; it decreases.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Testing error does not always decrease; it also decreases.
- **Option D**: Correct. Testing error will never increase because regularization reduces variance.
- **Option E**: Correct. Testing error will always decrease because regularization reduces variance.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Testing error does not increase or decrease arbitrarily; it decreases.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Testing error does not remain unaffected by training error.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Testing error will decrease, not increase.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Testing error will not remain the same; it will decrease.
- **Option J**: Correct. Testing error will never increase because regularization reduces variance.

The correct answers are **E** and **J**, but since the question requires selecting one option, **E** is the most appropriate choice as it directly addresses the effect on testing error.
