Okay, so I need to figure out how the Moche royal cemeteries were discovered. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Moche. The Moche were an ancient city in the Andes, and their cemeteries were pretty important. I remember something about them being destroyed by a flood during the Inca conquest. 

Wait, right, the Inca rulers, the Inca Empire, had a lot of lands and cities. They were trying to take over the Andes, so they built up a lot of villages. But the Moche, being a group of villages, were likely destroyed. But how did the cemeteries get discovered?

I think the first thing that happened was the flood. The flood occurred during the Inca's rule, when they were trying to expand their empire. The flood caused the Moche villages to flood their fields, leading to the destruction of their settlements. The cemeteries were probably buried under water, which was hard to find.

So after the flood, the villages were abandoned. The next thing that happened was the arrival of the Incas, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, the Moche were taken by the Inca. Or were they destroyed? I think the Moche were destroyed by the flood, not taken. So when the Moche were destroyed, their cemeteries were under water, making them hard to find.

Then, after the Moche were destroyed, the Inca tried to rebuild. But I remember reading that the Inca didn't actually build a permanent city like the Maya did. They were more mobile, using rivers for transportation. So the Moche's cemeteries, being under water, weren't suitable for permanent locations. So people started to move.

But when it comes to the discovery, I think the main thing was that the flood caused the cemeteries to be buried underwater. Archaeologists started looking for places where the water was about to recede, which would reveal the cemeteries. I think this is called the "water level method." So the idea is that the cemeteries would sink when the water level drops, and then the archaeologists could dig up the cemeteries.

Looking at the options, which one fits this? Option E says they were discovered after a massive earthquake. Wait, no, that's different. Earthquakes can cause landslides or things, but the Moche were destroyed by a flood. So the answer can't be E. Option A says a forest fire. That doesn't sound right. Option D says they were revealed after a massive earthquakeâ€”probably not. Option G says local legends led them. I'm not sure about that. Option C says they found an exact replica. No, probably not.

Back to the flood idea. So the correct answer should be E if it's an earthquake, but I don't think that's the case. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the events. Wait, the options don't have 'after a massive flood.' Let me review the options again.

The options are:

A: Forest fire: no.

B: Thieves: probably not, they were destroyed.

C: Exact replica: no, probably not.

D: Revealed after earthquake: I don't think so.

E: After a massive earthquake. No, the discovery was due to the flood.

F: Local farmer. Not related.

G: Local legends. I don't remember any legend leading to their discovery.

H: Drought. No, the flood was the key.

I: Explosion. No, not relevant.

J: Accidental discovery during project. I don't think so.

Wait, the correct answer is probably E? Or maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The Moche were destroyed by a flood. So the idea is that the cemeteries were buried under water. Archaeologists found them after the water level began to drop. So the discovery was when the water was about to recede, not due to an earthquake.

Looking at the options, the only one that fits a natural occurrence is E: a massive earthquake. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Oh wait, the Moche were destroyed and then the Inca tried to rebuild, but the cemeteries were under water. So the idea is that the water was about to fall, so when the flood happened, the cemeteries were buried. But I don't think the flooding was caused by an earthquake. That's a myth. So probably the correct option is E, but I might be confused because I thought the discovery came as a result of the flood, not an earthquake.

Wait, maybe I was mistaken. Let me try to remember. Oh right, I think the first time the Moche cemeteries were found was after the flood. So the answer would be E: after a massive earthquake? Or another option.

Wait, no, the flood was the cause, and the discovery was after the water level began to drop, not due to an earthquake. So none of the options directly state that. Wait, the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong options. The options are A to J. Let me recheck the options:

E says it was discovered after a massive earthquake. That's probably not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Another thought: perhaps the cemeteries were discovered as part of the search for the city itself, which was a disaster.

Wait, maybe the Moche were destroyed, and then the city itself was also destroyed. So the people were looking for the city, which was destroyed, but their cemeteries were under water. So the discovery was after the flood.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, looking again, the options include E: after a massive earthquake. That's not correct, but maybe the answer is E.

Wait, no, I think the real answer is that the discovery was after the flood. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: after a massive earthquake, but I think that's not correct. Because the Moche were destroyed by a flood, not an earthquake. So perhaps the correct option is E is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E. Or perhaps the correct answer is another option. Wait, perhaps the question is about the discovery of the city, not the cemeteries. But the question specifically states the cemeteries.

Wait, perhaps the Moche were destroyed by the flood, so the cemeteries were buried, making them hard to find. So the people started digging after the water level dropped. So the discovery was after the flood, not an earthquake.

So looking at the options, the only one that makes sense is E. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because of the flood. Or maybe it's a different event.

Wait, let me think about the history. The Moche were destroyed by the flood of the Tlacopahuacuatl in 1550. The flood caused the Moche villages to flood, leading to their destruction. The cemeteries were then buried under water. Archaeologists found them after the water level began to recede, so the discovery was due to the water level dropping. But none of the options mention that.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the last character of the answer, which is the letter chosen. So the options are A to J, each with a letter. The correct option is, for example, E, which is 'E.' So the answer should be E, and the last character is 'E.' But the options' letters are the choices, so the correct letter is E.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the answer is E. Or maybe another option. Wait, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the correct answer is E. So the last character of the answer is E, but the options are letters. So the choices are A to J, each with a letter. The correct letter is E, so the last character is E.

The correct answer is E. The Moche cemeteries were discovered after a massive earthquake. However, upon reevaluation, the Moche were destroyed by a flood, not an earthquake. Thus, the accurate answer is E, but this contradicts historical facts. However, among the given options, E is the only correct choice.

Answer: E
