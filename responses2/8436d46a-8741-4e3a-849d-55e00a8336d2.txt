Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question says that an atom is in an excited state for a duration of 1e-8 seconds, and I need to find the uncertainty in the energy of that state. The options are given from A to J, each with different values in ergs.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in time (Δt). The formula I think is something like ΔE = h / (Δt), where h is Planck's constant. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact expression. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2, but this is about energy and time, so I think it's ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2 or something like that. 

Wait, yeah, the general form is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe it's just ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2. Oh wait, sometimes it's written as ΔEΔt ≥ h/(2π), since ħ is h/(2π). So I need to make sure which one I'm using.

The problem gives the time as 1e-8 seconds, which is 1e-8 seconds. I need to plug that into the formula. So ΔE would be approximately h/(2Δt). Wait, no, the uncertainty in energy is on the order of h/(Δt), but I need to be precise.

So I should probably write it down. Let's outline the steps:

1. The uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ h / (Δt)
2. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.
3. The time Δt is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So ΔE would be (6.626e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) ) → 6.626e-34 / 1e-8 → 6.626e-26 J. But the question asks for the uncertainty in energy in ergs, not joules. Oh, right, since 1 J = 10^7 ergs (because 1 J = 10^7 ergs; because 1 erg = 10^-7 J). So to convert J to ergs, multiply by 1e7.

So 6.626e-26 J * 1e7 erg/J = 6.626e-19 ergs.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure about the units. So ΔE = h / Δt. h is in J·s, so when you divide by Δt in seconds, you get Joules. Then convert Joules to ergs by multiplying by 1e7.

So 6.626e-34 J·s / 1e-8 s = 6.626e-26 J. Multiply by 1e7 ergs/J → 6.626e-19 erg.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.6e-19 ergs, option J is 9.9e-20.

Hmm, so where am I going wrong? Let me think again. Wait, maybe the formula is ΔE = ħ / Δt, where ħ is h/(2π). So perhaps I should use ħ instead of h.

Ah, right! Because the uncertainty principle can be written as ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2. So ΔE = ħ / (2Δt). Oh, yes, that's correct because the Heisenberg equation for energy and time is ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2. So I should use ħ instead of h. 

So let's recalculate. ħ is h/(2π) = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ΔE = ħ / (Δt) → (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) → 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert that to ergs: 1.05457e-26 J * 1e7 erg/J = 1.05457e-19 erg.

So approximately 1.05e-19 erg. Looking at the options, option C is 1.0e-17, option G is 6.6e-20, so option E is 6.6e-19, which is close but E is 6.6e-19, which is about 1.0e-19, but wait our calculation gives about 1.05e-19, which is 1.05 x 10^-19 erg. But none of the options exactly match. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, the exact calculation: h is 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2pi) = approx 1.05457e-34 J·s. So ΔE = ħ/(Δt) = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J. Multiply by 1e7 erg/J gives 1.05457e-19 erg. So approximately 1.05e-19 erg, which is about 1.05 x 1e-19.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.6e-19, option J is 9.9e-20. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the correct formula but made a calculation mistake.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the uncertainty is written as ΔE = h / (2Δt). Let me think. Let's see, the standard form of the uncertainty principle is ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2. So ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). So using ħ = 1.05e-34, Δt = 1e-8. Then ΔE = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J. Convert to ergs: 5.25e-27 J *1e7 ergs/J = 5.25e-20 erg. So that's 5.25e-20 ergs. Looking at the options, option F is 5.0e-19, which is 5e-19, but that's 5e-20 is 5e-20. Wait, no, 1e-20 is smaller than 1e-19. So 5.25e-20 is 5.25 × 1e-20, which is 5.25e-20. None of the options have that except maybe E? No, E is 6.6e-19, which is 6.6 × 1e-19, which is 6.6e-19 ergs. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The general uncertainty principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, which is the same as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula. Let me recheck the calculation. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2pi) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ΔE = ħ / (Δt) → 1.05457e-34 / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J. Convert to ergs: multiply by 1e7 → 1.05457e-19 ergs. So approximately 1.05e-19 ergs.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option E: 6.6e-19. Hmm, but 6.6e-19 is about 6.6 × 1e-19, which is 6.6e-19, which is higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another way is to use the formula ΔE = h / (4πΔt). Because sometimes the uncertainty principle is written as ΔE^2 Δt^2 ≥ (h/(4π))^2 / 4, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the correct form is:

ΔE × Δt ≥ ħ/2.

So, yes, ħ is h/(2π). So our calculations seem right.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ. Let me recalculate h/(2π). h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) → 6.626e-34 / 6.2832 → approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So our previous calculation stands.

So our ΔE is approximately 1.05e-19 ergs.

Looking at the options again:

A: 7.5e-20

B: 8e-18

C: 1e-17

D:6.6e-21

E:6.6e-19

F:5e-19

G:6.6e-20

H:6.6e-18

I:4.4e-19

J:9.9e-20.

Hmm, so option E is 6.6e-19, which is close to our 1.05e-19. So perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact formula. Let me think: the correct formula is ΔE = h/(2Δt).

Wait, no, perhaps I should use ΔE = h/(Δt) × some factor. Another way to write the uncertainty principle is ΔE × Δt ≥ ħ/2.

So, ΔE = (ħ)/(2Δt).

Which is (1.05457e-34 J·s)/(2 * 1e-8 s) = 1.05457e-34/(2e-8) = (1.05457e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.27285e-27 J.

Convert to ergs: 5.27285e-27 J * 1e7 erg/J → 5.27285e-20 ergs.

So, approximately 5.27e-20 ergs.

Looking at the options, the nearest is E:6.6e-19 or J:9.9e-20. Hmm, none match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the units used are wrong. Because 1 erg is 1e-7 joules. So, converting J to ergs, you multiply by 1e7.

Wait, perhaps my calculation was correct, but perhaps the actual answer is not among the options. But the options given don't include 5.27e-20. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is ΔE = (h / (2π)) / (Δt), which is the same as ħ / (Δt). So that's correct.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps the formula is ΔE = (h / (Δt)) × something else. Like, perhaps, it's (h / (4π)) / (Δt).

Wait, let's compute that. So h/(4π) = 6.626e-34 / (4 * 3.1416) ≈ 6.626e-34 / 12.5664 ≈ 5.27e-35 J·s.

Wait, wait, that's way smaller. But that would make ΔE = 5.27e-35 / 1e-8 = 5.27e-27 J, which is still same as before, which converts to 5.27e-20 ergs. So again, same result.

Hmm, so perhaps the answer is not among the options, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the square root of the uncertainty principle.

Wait, but no, the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question says "the uncertainty in the energy", not the energy uncertainty. But the question says uncertainty in the energy of the state, which is the same as the energy uncertainty. So we're good.

Wait, perhaps I should use h instead of ħ. Let me try that. Using h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

ΔE = h / (Δt) = 6.626e-34 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-26 J. Convert to ergs → 6.626e-26 J * 1e7 erg/J = 6.626e-19 erg. So approximately 6.6e-19 ergs, which is option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct formula is ΔE = ħ/ (Δt), because the uncertainty principle is ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2. So why is it h/(Δt) here?

Wait, no, because in the equation, ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2, so ΔE = ħ/(Δt) → h/(2π Δt).

So perhaps I was correct earlier, leading to 1.05e-19, but E is 6.6e-19.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different form of the uncertainty principle, like ΔE = (h / (2π)) * (1/Δt). So that would be ħ / Δt.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.

An alternative formula: ΔE = ħ/(Δt). So if h is 6.626e-34, then ħ is 1.05e-34. So (1.05e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s) = 1.05e-26 J. To ergs: 1.05e-26 J * 1e7 erg/J = 1.05e-19 ergs. So around 1.05e-19 ergs. So, approximately 1.05e-19.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:6.6e-19. But 1.05e-19 is not exactly 6.6e-19. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the uncertainty in time is 1e-8 seconds, but perhaps it's in terms of frequency. No, the question clearly states the time as 1e-8 seconds. So that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔE = h/(Δt), but without the 2π factor. So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s) → 6.626e-26 J. Convert to ergs: 6.626e-26 * 1e7 → 6.626e-19 erg. So same result.

Hmm, so why does the option E have 6.6e-19, which is approximately 6.6e-19, which is 6.6 times 1e-20. Wait, no, 6.6e-19 is 6.6 × 1e-19, whereas our calculation is approximately 1.05e-19. So why isn't 1.05e-19 among the options? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula ΔE = (h / (2π)) / (Δt). So let me recalculate with that.

h/(2π) is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. Then, 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to ergs: 1.05e-26 * 1e7 = 1.05e-19 erg. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not present in the options, but if I have to choose the closest, maybe option E is 6.6e-19, which is double of my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question or in the options. But I can't change the question. So perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, maybe the formula uses ΔE = (h/(Δt)). So 6.626e-34 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-26 J. 6.626e-26 J * 1e7 erg/J → 6.626e-19 erg. So approximately 6.6e-19, which is option E.

But wait, that's the same as my calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, 6.6e-19 erg.

But earlier when I thought, the ħ approach gave the same result.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is ΔE = (h/(2pi)) / (Δt) → which is ħ / Δt.

So with ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s, ΔE = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. To ergs, 1.05e-26 * 1e7 = 1.05e-19 ergs.

So, 1.05e-19 is approximately 1.05e-19 ergs, which is not exactly any of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but considering the options, option E is 6.6e-19, which is about 6.6 times larger than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me think in terms of frequency. The energy of a photon is E = hν, where ν is the frequency. But the question is about the energy uncertainty, not the photon energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper formula is ΔE = (h/(2π Δt)). So, using h = 6.626e-34, and Δt = 1e-8.

h/(2π) = 1.05e-34. So 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to ergs: 1.05e-26 * 1e7 = 1.05e-19 ergs. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula ΔE = (h/(Δt)) without dividing by 2π. So, using h = 6.626e-34, Δt = 1e-8, then ΔE = 6.626e-34 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-26 J. Convert to ergs: 6.626e-26 * 1e7 = 6.626e-19 ergs. So approximately 6.6e-19, which is option E.

Wait, this is the same calculation as before. So why isn't this reflected in the options? Or perhaps I overlooked some factor.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula regarding the order of the terms. Let me think, the uncertainty principle is ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2, which can be written as ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

So using h = 6.626e-34, so ħ = h/(2pi) ≈ 1.05e-34.

So ΔE = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to ergs: 5.25e-27 J * 1e7 erg/J = 5.25e-20 erg.

So, approximately 5.25e-20 ergs. Looking at the options, the closest is E: 6.6e-19, which is 6.6e-19. So that's a big difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the correct formula. Let me try again.

Using ΔE = ħ/(Δt).

ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s.

So, 1.05e-34 J·s / (1e-8 s) = 1.05e-26 J.

To convert to ergs: 1.05e-26 J * 1e7 erg/J = 1.05e-19 erg.

Which is 1.05e-19, which is not among the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps I should select option E, which is 6.6e-19, but that's double what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, another approach: The uncertainty relation is ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2.

So, ΔE = (ħ/2) / Δt.

Now, ħ is 1.05e-34 J·s.

So, (1.05e-34 / 2) / (1e-8) = (5.25e-35) / (1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to ergs: 5.25e-27 J * 1e7 erg/J = 5.25e-20 erg.

So, approximately 5.25e-20 ergs.

Which is close to option E:6.6e-19. But 5.25e-20 is 5.25e-20, which is 5.25e-20, but that's 5.25 times 1e-20, which is 5.25e-20. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E:6.6e-19. Because 6.6e-19 is approximately twice the value I calculated. Let me think about this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think, perhaps the formula is ΔE = (h/(2π Δt)).

Wait, that's the same as before. So, 1.05e-34 / (1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J.

To ergs: 1.05e-26 * 1e7 = 1.05e-19.

So, same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is ΔE = h/(Δt). So, ΔE = 6.626e-34 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-26 J.

Convert to ergs: 6.626e-26 * 1e7 = 6.626e-19 ergs.

Ah! So this is exactly option E:6.6e-19.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is ΔE = h/(Δt), not ΔE = ħ/(Δt).

Wait, but the uncertainty principle is ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2.

So, if ΔE = h/(Δt), then ΔEΔt = h, which is greater than ħ/2. So h = 6.626e-34, which is greater than ħ/2, which is approximately 5.27e-34. So h is 6.6e-34, which is bigger than 5.27e-34. So, that would satisfy the uncertainty principle.

Wait, so the formula ΔE = h/(Δt) would give ΔEΔt = h, which is 6.6e-34, which is bigger than ħ/2 (5.27e-34), so the uncertainty principle is satisfied.

Ah! So this is a mistake in my initial approach. The correct formula is ΔE = h/(Δt), not using ħ.

So, in that case, the calculation would be:

ΔE = h/(Δt) = 6.626e-34 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-26 J.

Convert to ergs: 6.626e-26 J * 1e7 erg/J = 6.626e-19 ergs.

Which is approximately 6.6e-19, which is option E.

So, the correct answer is option E:6.6e-19.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct formula was ΔE = ħ/(Δt), but this seems to be incorrect.

Wait, let me re-derive it.

The uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.

So rearranged, ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, no, that would be the case. Because if I solve for ΔE, then ΔE ≥ (ħ)/(2Δt).

Wait, but that would make ΔE much smaller than the earlier approach.

Wait, but that can't be correct, because I know that the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.

So, solving for ΔE, we get ΔE ≥ (ħ)/(2Δt).

So, that's the correct approach.

So, if I use this formula, then ΔE = (ħ)/(2Δt).

Which gives:

ΔE = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to ergs: 5.25e-27 * 1e7 = 5.25e-20 ergs.

Hmm, but this is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made another mistake.

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is ΔE = (h/(2π)) / (Δt).

So, using h = 6.626e-34, ħ = 1.05e-34.

So, (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to ergs: 5.25e-27 * 1e7 = 5.25e-20 ergs.

Which again is 5.25e-20, which is 5.25e-20, which is not in the options.

Wait, but if I use the correct formula as ΔE = h/(Δt), then:

h/(Δt) = 6.626e-34 / 1e-8 = 6.626e-26 J.

Convert to ergs: 6.626e-26 * 1e7 = 6.626e-19 ergs.

So, 6.626e-19 is approximately 6.6e-19, which is option E.

Ah! So, the correct formula is ΔE = h/(Δt), not using ħ. So, perhaps the confusion comes from using ħ instead of h in the formula.

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is option E:6.6e-19.
</think>

The uncertainty principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty ($\Delta E$) and the time uncertainty ($\Delta t$)) is at least half the reduced Planck constant ($\hbar$): 

$$\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.$$

To find $\Delta E$, we rearrange the formula:

$$\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.$$

Given:
- $\Delta t = 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}$,
- $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2\pi} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$.

Substituting the values:

$$\Delta E = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.25 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.$$

Convert to ergs ($1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{erg}$):

$$\Delta E = 5.25 \times 10^{-27} \times 10^7 = 5.25 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{erg}.$$

However, considering the correct formula $\Delta E = \frac{h}{\Delta t}$, where $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$:

$$\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1 \times 10^{-8}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.$$

Convert to ergs:

$$\Delta E = 6.626 \times 10^{-26} \times 10^7 = 6.626 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{erg}.$$

Thus, the correct answer is closest to **option E: 6.6e-19**.

ANSWER: E
