Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

The question is about calculating the number of moles of HCl needed to make a certain volume and concentration of solution. The problem says: How many moles of HCl must be added to sufficient water to form 3 liters of a 2 M HCl solution? The options are A to J, with numbers from 1 to 8.

Hmm, right, I remember that concentration (molarity) is calculated as moles of solute divided by the volume of solution in liters. So the formula is M = moles / volume (in liters). 

Wait, so I need to find the number of moles. The formula rearranged would be moles = Molarity Ã— Volume. Oh, right, because if M is 2 M and the volume is 3 liters, then moles = 2 * 3 = 6 moles. So the answer should be 6. Looking at the options, option C is 6 mol, so that's probably the right choice.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes when I'm rushing, I might mix up the formula. Let me double-check. Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles = M * liters. Yes, that's correct. So 2 M times 3 liters equals 6 moles. So the correct answer should be C.

I don't see any other factors here. The question doesn't mention anything about dilution or excess water or anything like that. It just says to form 3 liters of 2 M HCl solution. So all the water is sufficient, so we don't have to worry about adding excess water as in a dilution scenario. So the moles needed are directly 6.

Wait, another thought. Sometimes when preparing solutions, people might confuse the formula. But I think I remember correctly. Moles are M * L. So 2 * 3=6, yes. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the number of moles of HCl needed to prepare 3 liters of a 2 M HCl solution, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{volume of solution (in liters)}}
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for moles:

\[
\text{moles of solute} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{volume (in liters)}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{moles of HCl} = 2 \, \text{M} \times 3 \, \text{L} = 6 \, \text{mol}
\]

Thus, 6 moles of HCl are required. The correct answer corresponds to option C.
