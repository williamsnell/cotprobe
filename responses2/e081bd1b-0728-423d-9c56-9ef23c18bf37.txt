Okay, let me try to figure out the answer to this question. The question is about the difficulties in classifying the tissues of higher plants. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully.

First, I should understand what "classification of tissues" means. Tissue classification is about grouping different tissues together based on their structures and functions. For example, we know that plants have various tissues like leaves, stems, roots, flowers, etc.

Now, the question is asking what are the difficulties people face when trying to classify these tissues. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Inability to observe cells. Hmm, I think this might relate to a different aspect, like cellular level observations. For tissue classification, we mainly look at structures, not individual cells. So maybe this isn't the main difficulty.

Option B: Homogeneity of cell structures in all tissues. Wait, homogeneity refers to uniformity. If all tissues have uniform cell structures, that would make classification easier. But higher plants do have diverse cell types, like epiploides (leaf cells), primary (stem), secondary (fibres), and secondary versa (flower cells). So this option might be a difficulty because tissues have varying cell types, making classification tricky.

Option C: Identical functional roles for all tissue types. That rings a bell. I remember that older plants classified all tissues as having the same functions, but now research suggests that some have different roles. Like, the function of a stem versus a leaf is important. So this would be a difficulty because it's not uniform across all tissues.

Option D: Intergrade cells, variety of cell types, unreliable maturity-based classification. I think intergrade cells are those that develop from a single cell and have intermediate structures. This is a concept from developmental biology. Tissues are classified based on when they mature, but if cells are intergrade, their structures can differ. This leads to a mix of cell types contributing to the same tissue. Also, the classification might not be reliable because different sources might use different classification methods. So this seems like a significant difficulty.

Option E: Tissues are too robust to be classified. I'm not sure about this. If tissues are too robust, perhaps it's hard to separate them because their structures are complex. But I don't remember this as a major difficulty. Maybe more about the biological complexity than classification difficulty.

Option F: Lack of suitable technology. Well, without suitable technology, classifying tissues would be difficult. But the question is about the difficulties in the classification process, not the technology itself. So maybe this is a factor, but perhaps it's not the main difficulty.

Looking back, the question is about the difficulties, so which of these options are the main issues leading to problems in classification.

Homogeneity (B) is a challenge because each tissue has different cell types. Identical function (C) is another issue because not all tissues have the same role. Intergrade cells (D) add to the confusion because they develop from a single cell, leading to intermediate structures, which might not fit neatly into tissue classification. The variety of cell types (D) and intergrade cells (D) together suggest this is a big difficulty.

So the main difficulties are B, C, and D. However, the options are single letters, so I need to choose the best fit.

Wait, let me read the options again. The question is asking what are the difficulties. So each option is a different difficulty. The options are A, B, C, D, E, F.

The question asks for the difficulties. So the four main points are:

1. Tissues have varying cell structures (B).
2. Some tissues don't have identical functions (C).
3. Cells may be intergrade (D).
4. Different classification methods may lead to different results (D).

Wait, but option D is about intergrade cells and variety of cell types, which is a difficulty. So the correct answers are B, C, D, and perhaps another.

Wait, option B says homogeneity of cell structures in all tissues. Since not all tissues have uniform cell structures (like stems vs. leaves), this is a difficulty. So B is a difficulty.

Option D is about intergrade cells, which are a type of cell that develops into a tissue, differing from other cells in a tissue. This can complicate classification because they might contribute to various tissues. So D is a difficulty.

Option C is about identical functional roles. Since not all tissues have the same function, this is another difficulty.

So the question is, which of these are the main difficulties? Let me see the options again.

The options list four points:

A: Inability to observe cells. I don't think this is the main issue because we can see cells.

B: Homogeneity of cell structures. Yes, definitely a difficulty because each tissue has different cell types.

C: Identical functional roles. Also a difficulty because not all tissues function the same.

D: Intergrade cells, variety of cell types, unreliable maturity-based classification. Hmm, this seems to cover the intergrade aspect and the variety, making it a difficulty.

E: Tissues are too robust to be classified. Maybe less about classification difficulty than about the biological complexity.

F: Lack of suitable technology. Technological issues here, but perhaps not the main difficulty.

So the options B, C, D, and F.

Wait, the question is about "difficulties in classification", which includes things like the inability to observe cells, but I don't think that's it. So which of these are the main?

The main difficulties are that tissues have varying structures (B), some have different functions (C), and that intergrade cells are a factor (D). So the options B, C, D, and D.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice with single options. Let me re-read the options.

The options are:

A: Inability to observe cells. That's probably a different aspect; more about observation.

B: Homogeneity of cell structures in all tissues. That's correct.

C: Identical functional roles for all tissues. Correct.

D: Intergrade cells, variety of cell types, unreliable maturity-based classification. Correct.

E: Tissues too robust. Maybe less likely.

F: Lack of technology. Hmm, perhaps this is a factor, but I'm not sure if it's the main difficulty.

Wait, the question is about the difficulties in the classification. So B, C, D are difficulties.

But the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, the options are labeled A to F, and the question is which statement is a difficulty. So looking for the correct ones.

Option D lists three things: intergrade cells, variety of cell types, unreliable classification.

So the correct answer would be D. Because these are all difficulties. So the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, option B is a difficulty, but perhaps more so than others.

Wait, the question is, what are the difficulties. So all the options except perhaps A are about difficulties.

Wait, the options are A through F. So the correct answer is D, which covers intergrade cells, variety, and unreliable classification.

So the answer should be D.

The question asks about the difficulties in classifying plant tissues. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Inability to observe cells. This relates to cell observation rather than classification difficulty, making it less relevant.
- **Option B**: Homogeneity of cell structures in all tissues. This is a clear difficulty because tissues have diverse cell types, leading to varying structures.
- **Option C**: Identical functional roles for all tissues. This is another difficulty, as not all tissues have uniform functions.
- **Option D**: Intergrade cells, variety of cell types, unreliable maturity-based classification. This covers aspects of complexity, interplay of cells, and classification reliability, making it a comprehensive difficulty.
- **Option E**: Tissues are too robust to be classified. While a biological complexity issue, it is not the primary difficulty.
- **Option F**: Lack of suitable technology. Technological challenges could be relevant but are less central to the classification difficulty.

The main difficulties are the diversity of cell structures, functional roles, and classification reliability, which are best captured by **Option D**.
