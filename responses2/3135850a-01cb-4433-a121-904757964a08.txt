Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about objective criteria for something, probably a goal or target. The options are A through I, and I need to figure out which one is NOT an objective. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in project management and goal setting, objectives are usually measured using certain criteria. Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. They should also be detailed enough to guide the project without being too vague.

Looking at the options:

A: Achievable – Makes sense. An objective should have a clear measure of what's possible.
B: Specific – Yes, specific objectives are easier to achieve and measure.
C: Broad – Hmm, broad might not be specific enough. If it's too vague, it's harder to measure and implement.
D: Measurable – Definitely a key part of objectives. Without a way to measure success, the goal isn't actionable.
E: Relevant – Important because without relevance, it doesn't address the issue at hand.
F: Realistic – Important to avoid being impossible, which could lead to frustration or burnout.
G: Detailed – Yes, detailed objectives are more feasible because they break down tasks into smaller steps.
H: Time-bound – Time constraints are crucial in project management to ensure timely completion.
I: Ambiguous – If the objective isn't clear, it's harder to assess success. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and potential misalignment.

So the question is asking which option is NOT an objective. I think I should identify the one that's not a standard part of an objective. Looking back, I remember that objectives typically include all these aspects except for something that might be too vague or unclear.

Wait, option C is "Broad." If it's too broad, it might not be actionable or measureable. For example, a goal that's too vague like "improve efficiency" is better measured by something like "reduce downtime." So broadness might not make it a proper objective because it lacks specificity.

So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: Broad. A broad objective lacks specificity, making it unmeasurable and impractical.
