Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Statement 1| Traditional machine learning results assume that the train and test sets are independent and identically distributed. Statement 2| In 2017, COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet.

C: False, False
D: False, True
E: Not stated, False
F: True, Not stated

Okay, so I've got this multiple choice question about machine learning. Hmm, let's take it step by step. 

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. I need to determine if each is true or false, and then choose the correct option from A to J based on that.

Statement 1 says: Traditional machine learning assumes that the train and test sets are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Wait, I remember that i.i.d. means each sample is independent and the same distribution as the others. So yes, in traditional ML, we often split data into training and test sets that are like a sample from the same distribution. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: In 2017, COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet. COCO is COCO Handling Objects, right? I think COCO models are trained on ImageNet. COCO is a large image dataset used for object recognition. So yes, COCO models were pretrained on ImageNet. So Statement 2 is also True.

Now, looking at the options, I need to figure out what combination of these is correct. The options are combinations like A: True, False; B: False, Not stated, etc.

Wait, the options are A to J, each with two answers. But the statements are both about facts. So, each option is a pair of two letters. So for each option, both statements are either true or false.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is True. So looking at the options, which option says True and True? Let me check.

Options:

A: True, False → No.

B: False, Not stated → No, both are true.

C: False, False → No.

D: False, True → No.

E: Not stated, True → No, both are true.

F: True, Not stated → No.

G: True, Not applicable → No, but I'm not sure.

H: True, True → Yes, this is correct.

I: Not stated, True → No, both are true.

J: Not stated, Not stated → No.

So the correct answer is H: True, True.

The statements are both true. Statement 1 is about traditional ML assumptions, and Statement 2 is about COCO models being pretrained on ImageNet. Therefore, the correct answer is H: True, True.

**Answer: H**
