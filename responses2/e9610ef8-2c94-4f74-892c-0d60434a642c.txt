Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about producing chlorine from molten sodium chloride. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when you electrolyze sodium chloride, it produces chlorine gas and sodium metal. But wait, the question is about how many grams would be produced using a certain current. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should figure out the relevant chemical reaction. I think the reaction is NaCl being decomposed into Na and Cl2. So the equation is probably NaCl → Na + Cl2. But wait, in electrolysis, the decomposition produces Cl2 because chlorine is more easily oxidized than sodium. Sodium is more reactive, but I think in the decomposition of NaCl, the Cl- ions are the ones that get oxidized.

Right, so the decomposition of NaCl under electrolysis would produce chlorine gas. The chemical equation is 2 NaCl → 2 Na + Cl2↑. Oh wait, right, the stoichiometry is important here. So for every mole of NaCl that decomposes, you get one mole of Cl2. So the moles of Cl2 produced would be equal to the moles of NaCl used.

But wait, I need to relate this to the current. I remember that the amount of substance produced depends on the amount of electricity passed through the solution. The formula for Faraday's laws is Q = n F E, where Q is the charge in coulombs, n is moles of electrons, F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), and E is the electric potential in volts.

Wait, but in this case, the current is given as 1 amp for 5 minutes. Wait, 5 minutes is 5*60=300 seconds. Current is in amperes, so to find the charge, I should multiply current (A) by time (s) to get coulombs. So Q = I * t.

So I can calculate the charge, then use Faraday's law to find the moles of electrons, and then the moles of Cl2 produced. Then convert moles of Cl2 to grams.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate total charge (Q): I=1A, t=5 minutes=300s. So Q=1 * 300 = 300 C.
2. Find moles of electrons (n): Q = n F → n = Q/(F) = 300 / 96485 ≈ 3.1e-3 mol. Wait, let me compute that. 300 / 96485 is approximately 0.003113 mol of electrons.
3. Since each Cl2 molecule requires 2 electrons, the moles of Cl2 produced will be half of the moles of electrons. Because each Cl2 needs 2 e- → moles Cl2 = n_electrons / 2.

Wait, wait. Wait, in the electrolysis of NaCl, each mole of Cl2 produced requires 2 moles of electrons. So the moles of Cl2 is Q/(n F) * (1/2). So n_electrons is (Q)/(F) → 300/96485 ≈ 3.11e-3 mol e-. Then moles Cl2 is 3.11e-3 / 2 ≈ 1.555e-3 mol.

Then, the molar mass of Cl2 is 70.906 g/mol (since Cl is about 35.45 g/mol, so 35.45*2=70.90). So grams of Cl2 = moles * molar mass → 1.555e-3 * 70.906 ≈ approximately 0.110 grams.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Let me recompute n.

n = Q / F = 300 C / 96485 C/mol = 0.003113 mol. Then Cl2 is 0.003113 / 2 = 0.0015565 mol. Then 0.0015565 * 70.906 ≈ 0.110 grams. Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 0.111g, option H is 2.11g, etc.

Wait, but wait, another thing. The formula for the decomposition of NaCl in electrolysis is 2 NaCl → 2 Na + Cl2. So for every 2 moles of NaCl decomposed, 1 mole of Cl2 is produced. So the molar ratio is 2:1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the stoichiometry. So the reaction is NaCl → Na + Cl2. So 1 mole of NaCl produces 1 mole of Cl2. So moles of Cl2 = moles of NaCl.

So based on that, if I have 0.0015565 moles of Cl2, that would be 0.0015565 * 70.906 = approximately 0.110 grams.

But looking at the options, option E is 0.111g, which is very close. But wait, let me recount the exact calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the charge. Let me check: 1 amp for 5 minutes (300 seconds). So charge is 300 C. So n = Q/(96485) = 300/96485 ≈ 0.003113 mol. Chlorine requires 2 electrons per mole, so moles Cl2 is 0.003113/2 = 0.001556 mol. Chlorine is 70.906 g/mol: 0.001556 * 70.906 = approx 0.110 grams.

Wait, but some options have 0.111g. Option E is 0.111g.

Wait, but wait another thing. The current is 1 amp. I think I need to make sure the time is correctly converted. Oh wait, 5 minutes is 300 seconds. So Q=I*t=1*300=300 C. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the faraday's constant. Let me check: Faraday's constant is 96485 C/mol e-. Yes, correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use a more precise calculation.

Compute n = 300 / 96485.

Let me compute that: 300 / 96485 = approximately 0.003113 mol e-.

So moles Cl2 = 0.003113 / 2 = 0.001556 mol.

Mass Cl2 = 0.001556 * 70.906 → 0.001556 *70.906 = let's compute this.

0.001556 *70 = 0.10892, and 0.001556*0.906=approx 0.001406. So total around 0.10892+0.001406=0.11032 grams. So approx 0.110 grams.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.111g, which is very close.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the stoichiometry correct? Because sometimes, in electrolysis, the decomposition of NaCl might produce 2 moles of Cl2 from 2 moles of NaCl. Wait, no, the correct stoichiometry is 2 NaCl → 2 Na + Cl2. So for every 2 moles of NaCl, you get 1 mole of Cl2. Which means the ratio is 1:1.

So moles Cl2 is same as moles NaCl. So that calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait, wait. The reaction I wrote earlier was 2 NaCl → 2 Na + Cl2. So that's 2 moles of NaCl to 1 mole of Cl2. So moles of Cl2 = moles of NaCl. So moles of Cl2 is 0.001556.

Wait, but another way: if 2 moles of NaCl → 1 mole Cl2, then 300 C would produce (300/96485) * (1/2) moles Cl2. So same as before.

So 0.001556 mol Cl2, which is 0.110 grams. So the closest option is E (0.111g).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the charge. Let me double-check that.

I have 1 amp for 5 minutes. 1 amp means 1 coulomb per second.

5 minutes = 5 * 60 = 300 seconds.

Charge Q = I * t = 1 A *300 s = 300 C.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, but now I'm a bit confused because I thought the correct answer was around 0.11 grams, but looking at the options, option E is 0.111g, which is the same as our calculation.

Wait, but let me check other options to see if another option is close. Let's see:

Another approach: maybe use the formula for grams of product.

The formula is grams = (Molarity × Volume) × (Faraday's constant × charge) / (n × molar mass of product).

Alternatively, another formula is: grams = (I * t / F) * (molar mass of product) / n.

Wait, let me think. The amount of substance (moles) is (I * t) / F. Since each mole of Cl2 requires 2 electrons, the moles of Cl2 is (I * t)/(2F).

So, moles Cl2 = (1 *300)/(2 *96485) = 300/(192970) ≈ 1.555e-3 mol.

Molar mass of Cl2 is 70.906 g/mol. So 1.555e-3 * 70.906 ≈ 0.1104 grams. So that's about 0.110g. So option E is 0.111g, which is the closest.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.111g, option H is 2.11g, etc. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine how many grams of chlorine (Cl₂) can be produced by electrolyzing molten NaCl with a current of 1 amp for 5.00 minutes, the following steps are taken:

1. **Reaction and Stoichiometry**: The decomposition of NaCl in electrolysis produces Cl₂ gas according to the reaction:  
   \[
   2 \text{NaCl} \rightarrow 2 \text{Na} + \text{Cl}_2
   \]  
   This means 2 moles of NaCl produce 1 mole of Cl₂. Thus, the moles of Cl₂ produced are equal to the moles of NaCl decomposed.

2. **Charge Calculation**: The total charge (Q) passed through the solution is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   Q = I \cdot t
   \]  
   where \( I = 1 \, \text{A} \) and \( t = 5.00 \, \text{minutes} = 5.00 \cdot 60 = 300 \, \text{s} \). Thus, \( Q = 1 \cdot 300 = 300 \, \text{C} \).

3. **Moles of Electrons**: Using Faraday's constant (\( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \)), the moles of electrons (\( n_e \)) are:  
   \[
   n_e = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{300}{96485} \approx 0.003113 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Moles of Cl₂**: Since each mole of Cl₂ requires 2 moles of electrons, the moles of Cl₂ produced are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Cl}_2 = \frac{n_e}{2} = \frac{0.003113}{2} \approx 0.001556 \, \text{mol}
   \]

5. **Mass of Cl₂**: The molar mass of Cl₂ is \( 70.906 \, \text{g/mol} \). Therefore, the mass of Cl₂ produced is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Cl}_2 = \text{Moles of Cl}_2 \cdot \text{Molar Mass} = 0.001556 \cdot 70.906 \approx 0.110 \, \text{g}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated mass of 0.110 g is closest to option E (\( 0.111 \, \text{g} \)).
