Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the coordinate vector of a vector x in a given basis B. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the basis B is made up of two vectors: v1 = [3, 1] and v2 = [-1, 3]. I remember that a basis is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the vector space, which in this case is R². So, any vector in R² can be expressed as a linear combination of these two basis vectors.

The vector x is given as [10, 10]. I need to find the coordinates of x in the basis B. That is, I need to find scalars a and b such that x = a*v1 + b*v2. Once I have a and b, those will form the coordinate vector [a, b] in the basis B.

Let me write this out as equations. So, substituting the vectors:

10 = 3a + (-1)b
10 = 1a + 3b

So now I have a system of two equations with two variables. Let me write them:

1) 3a - b = 10
2) a + 3b = 10

I need to solve for a and b. I can use either substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Maybe multiply the first equation by 3 so that the coefficients of b are opposites.

Multiplying equation 1 by 3: 
3*(3a - b) = 3*10
9a - 3b = 30

Now, equation 2 is a + 3b =10. Let me add these two equations together to eliminate b.

Adding:
(9a - 3b) + (a + 3b) = 30 + 10
10a = 40

So, 10a =40 → a = 4.

Now, substitute a=4 into one of the original equations. Let's use equation 2: a + 3b =10.

Substituting a=4: 4 + 3b =10 → 3b=10-4=6 → b=2.

Wait, so a=4 and b=2. So the coordinate vector of x in basis B is [4, 2]. Let me check if that's one of the options. Looking back: options C is [7,3], D is [6,0], E is [3,1], H is [2,4], I is [0,6], J is [1,7]. Hmm, none of these are [4,2]. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 

Equation 1: 3a -b =10.
Equation 2: a +3b=10.

I solved equation 1 for b: 3a -10 = b. Then substituted into equation 2.

So, a +3*(3a -10) =10 → a +9a -30 =10 → 10a=40 → a=4. Then b= 3*4 -10=12-10=2. So yes, a=4, b=2. That seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is [2,4], which is the reverse of [4,2]. Maybe I made a mistake in how I set up the equations.

Wait, perhaps the coordinates are [a, b] where x = a*v1 + b*v2, but maybe I should represent it differently. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should express x as a linear combination of v1 and v2, so x= a*v1 + b*v2, which is what I did. Wait, but the options don't include [4,2]. 

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the equations. Let me try substituting the values again. So, x is [10,10]. So 3a -b =10 and a +3b=10.

Wait, let's solve this again. Let me write the equations:

Equation 1: 3a -b =10 → b=3a -10.

Substitute into equation 2: a +3*(3a -10) =10 → a +9a -30 =10 → 10a=40 → a=4. Then b=3*4 -10=12-10=2. So a=4, b=2. So the vector coordinates are [4,2].

Looking at the options, H is [2,4], which is different. Did I perhaps have the basis vectors in the wrong order? Wait, no, because the question says the basis is v1 and v2, which are [3,1] and [-1,3]. Wait, but the order of the basis vectors doesn't affect the solution, right? Because we're solving for the coefficients a and b such that x = a*v1 + b*v2. So the order of the basis vectors doesn't change the way I set up the equations.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in solving. Let me check another approach: using matrices. Let me set up the matrix equation. The basis vectors are the columns of the matrix. So the matrix M is:

[ 3   -1 ]
[ 1   3 ]

We need to find M^{-1} multiplied by x to get the coordinates. Alternatively, we can solve the system.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Cramer's rule.

The determinant of M is (3)(3) - (-1)(1) =9 +1=10.

So, the inverse of M is (1/det)*[3 1; -1 3] = (1/10)*[3 1; -1 3].

Multiply this inverse by x, which is [10, 10]^T.

So, the coordinates would be:

[3/10*10 + 1/10*10   ; (-1/10)*10 + 3/10*10 ]

Wait, let's compute that:

Numerator: 3*10 +1*10 =30+10=40 → divided by 10 →4.

Wait, no: Wait, the first component is (3*10 +1*10)/10 = (30 +10)/10=40/10=4.

Second component: (-1*10 +3*10)/10 = (-10 +30)/10=20/10=2.

So the coordinates are [4, 2], which is option H. Wait, but in the options, H is [2,4]. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the inverse.

Wait, wait, the inverse matrix would have the elements as follows:

The inverse of M is (1/10)*[3 1; -1 3], right? So when you multiply this by x, which is [10,10]^T, you get:

3*10/10 +1*10/10 = (30 +10)/10=40/10=4.

For the second component: (-1)*10/10 +3*10/10 = (-10 +30)/10=20/10=2.

So yes, the coordinates are [4,2], which is option H. But wait, looking back at the options, option H is [2,4], which is different. So why am I getting [4,2], but the options don't have this?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express x as a linear combination of v1 and v2. So, x = a*v1 + b*v2. So:

3a - b =10

a +3b =10.

Wait, I think I did that correctly. So, solving gives a=4, b=2. So the coordinate is [4,2], which is option H. But according to the options given, H is [2,4]. So either I have a mistake, or perhaps I have the basis vectors in a different order.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "the basis B of R^2 consisting of vectors v_1 = [3,1] and v_2 = [-1,3]." So, v1 is [3,1], v2 is [-1,3]. So, my setup is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the coordinates in the basis B, but I might have to consider that the basis vectors are ordered differently. No, because the basis is fixed as v1 and v2.

Wait, perhaps I should check what [4,2] would be in the standard basis. But the question is asking for the coordinate vector in basis B, so [4,2] is correct.

But looking at the options, option H is [2,4]. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me double-check the initial equations.

Wait, perhaps I set up the equations incorrectly. Let's write the system again.

We have x = a*v1 + b*v2.

So, x = [10,10] = a*[3,1] + b*[-1,3].

Which gives two equations:

3a -b =10

1a +3b=10.

Yes, that's correct. So solving, a=4, b=2. So [4,2] is the coordinate vector. But looking at the options, I see option H is [2,4], which is the reverse. So, perhaps I should check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem is correct. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the basis. Maybe the basis is given as [v1, v2], but perhaps the coordinates are expressed as [a, b], meaning that the first component is the coefficient for v1 and the second for v2. So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Wait, option H is [2,4], which would correspond to a=2, b=4. Let's see if that satisfies the equations.

If a=2, b=4, then 3*2 -4=6-4=2, which is not 10. So that's not correct. Therefore, my solution must be correct as [4,2], which is option H? But in the options, option H is given as [2,4], which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I swapped the equations. Let me try solving again.

Equation 1: 3a -b =10

Equation 2: a +3b =10

Let me solve for b in equation 1: 3a -10 = b.

Substitute into equation 2: a +3*(3a -10) =10 → a +9a -30=10 → 10a=40 → a=4.

So b=3*4 -10=12-10=2. So [4,2] is correct.

But in the options, option H is [2,4], which is the same as [b,a], maybe.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the coordinate vector is [a, b], but perhaps the way the basis is set up, maybe the given answer is [a,b] where the first element is the coefficient for v1 and the second for v2. So, in this case, [4,2] is correct, but in the options, perhaps H is [2,4], which would be if I thought a=2, b=4, which doesn't satisfy the equations.

Wait, perhaps I should check for a=2, b=4: 3*2 -4=6-4=2, but the first component needs to be 10. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inverse calculation. Let me try another method.

Another way: set up the augmented matrix [v1 | x], and perform row operations.

Matrix:

[3  1 | 10]

[1  3 | 10]

Let me make the first element of the second row as 3, then eliminate below. But perhaps it's easier to swap rows.

Let me swap the two rows:

Row1: [1 3 |10]

Row2: [3 1 |10]

Now, eliminate the 3 in Row2, Col1: subtract 3*Row1 from Row2.

Row2 becomes: 3-3*1=0, 1-3*3=1-9=-8, 10-3*10=10-30=-20.

So Row2 is [-8, -20 | -20].

Now, the matrix is:

Row1: [1 3 |10]

Row2: [-8 -20 | -20]

We can multiply Row2 by -1/8 to simplify.

Row2: [1 2.5 |2.5]

Now, subtract Row1 from Row2 to eliminate a.

But wait, maybe it's easier to proceed with the inverse.

Alternatively, let me use the first method.

Wait, perhaps I can use substitution.

From equation 1: 3a -b=10 → b=3a-10.

Substitute into equation 2: a +3b =10 → a +3*(3a-10)=10 → a +9a -30=10 →10a=40 →a=4.

So yes, a=4, b=2.

So the coordinate vector is [4,2], which is H. But in the options, H is [2,4]. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's basis vectors.

Wait, perhaps I got the basis vectors mixed up. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says the basis is v1 = [3,1] and v2 = [-1,3]. So, perhaps in the problem, the basis is [v1, v2], but when I set up the equations, I might have written it in the reverse. Let me try that.

Suppose I set up the equations as:

3a +1b =10

-1a +3b =10.

Wait, but that would be if I were expressing x as a combination of v2 and v1, but that's not the case. The problem says x = a*v1 + b*v2, so I think that setup is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if [4,2] is the correct answer. Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me try solving another way. Let me express x as a combination of v1 and v2.

So:

x = a*v1 + b*v2 → [10,10] = a[3,1] + b[-1,3].

So, equations:

3a -b =10

a +3b =10.

Alternatively, maybe I can solve for a in terms of b from the first equation.

From 3a - b =10 → 3a=10 +b → a = (10 +b)/3.

Substitute into second equation:

(10 +b)/3 +3b =10.

Multiply through by 3 to eliminate denominator:

10 + b +9b =30 → 10 +10b=30 → 10b=20 → b=2.

Then a=(10+2)/3=12/3=4. So same result: a=4, b=2. So the coordinate vector is [4,2], which is option H.

Wait, but the options don't have [4,2] as H. Wait, looking back, the options are A to J. Let me check.

Options:

A: [-1, 3]

B: [5,5]

C: [7,3]

D: [6,0]

E: [3,1]

F: [10,10]

G: [4,2]

H: [2,4]

I: [0,6]

J: [1,7]

Ah, so option G is [4,2], which matches our result. So the correct answer is G: [4,2].

But wait, earlier I thought option G was [4,2], which is correct, but in the problem statement, option H is [2,4]. So perhaps I made a mistake in solving, but no. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but I thought the correct answer is [4,2], so option G.

Wait, but the problem statement's options list G as [4,2], which is correct. So the answer is G.

But looking back, the problem asks for the coordinate vector, which would be [4,2], which is option G.

So the correct answer is G: [4,2].
</think>

The given basis vectors are \( v_1 = [3, 1] \) and \( v_2 = [-1, 3] \). We need to find the coordinate vector of \( x = [10, 10] \) in this basis. 

To do this, we express \( x \) as a linear combination of \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \):
\[
x = a \cdot v_1 + b \cdot v_2
\]
Substituting the vectors:
\[
[10, 10] = a \cdot [3, 1] + b \cdot [-1, 3]
\]
This gives us the system of equations:
\[
3a - b = 10 \quad \text{(1)} \\
a + 3b = 10 \quad \text{(2)}
\]
Solving equation (1) for \( b \):
\[
b = 3a - 10
\]
Substitute into equation (2):
\[
a + 3(3a - 10) = 10 \\
a + 9a - 30 = 10 \\
10a = 40 \\
a = 4
\]
Substitute \( a = 4 \) back into \( b = 3a - 10 \):
\[
b = 12 - 10 = 2
\]
Thus, \( x \) can be expressed as \( 4v_1 + 2v_2 \), and the coordinate vector is \( [4, 2] \), which corresponds to option G.
