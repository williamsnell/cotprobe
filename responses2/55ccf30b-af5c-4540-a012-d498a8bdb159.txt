Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that the standard deviation of person longevity in a locality is 14 years. I need to find the mean longevity when 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. It also mentions to assume a normal distribution. Hmm, I remember that in a normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation are key parameters.

Wait, the problem is about the mean. But wait, the wording says 30% live longer than 75. So, that means 75 is the 70th percentile, right? Because 30% are above it, so 70% are below or equal. So 75 is the value that separates the lower 70% from the upper 30%.

In a normal distribution, percentiles can be found using the z-score. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is. The formula for the z-score is z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

But wait, I need to find the mean, not the z-score. So I should express μ in terms of X, σ, and z. Let me rearrange the formula: μ = X - z * σ.

But what is the z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile? I think that's where I need to look. A standard normal distribution table or a calculator can help here. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value of the z-score for 70%, but I remember that the 70th percentile is approximately 0.5244 in the standard normal distribution. Wait, let me think. No, wait, no. Wait, the z-score for the 70th percentile is actually about 0.5244? Or is it 0.8413? Wait, no—no, wait. Let me think again. I think the 50th percentile is at 0, 68th is about 0.84, 90th is about 1.28. So the 70th percentile would be around 0.5244. Wait, but I might be mixing up. Alternatively, I can remember that the 60th percentile is about 0.2533, and 70th is around 0.5244. Oh right, the z-score for the 70th percentile is approximately 0.5244. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So, putting it all together, μ = 75 - (0.5244 * 14), because X is 75, z is 0.5244, and σ is 14. So the mean would be 75 minus (0.5244 * 14). Looking at the options, option F is 75 - 0.5244(14), and G is 75 + 0.4756(14). Wait, why am I getting 0.5244 but one of the options is 0.4756. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the percentile. Because I've heard that some sources say the 70th percentile is about 0.5244, but maybe some sources use the inverse of the standard normal distribution. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the z-score for 70% being 0.5244. Let me check my notes.

Wait, another thought. Maybe I should use the inverse of the standard normal distribution function to find the z-score. For the 70th percentile, the z-score is the value where 70% of the area is to the left. So, I think that’s about 0.5244. So, the calculation would be μ = 75 - (0.5244 * 14). So the mean is 75 minus 0.5244 times 14. So looking at the options, that would be option F: 75 - 0.5244(14).

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think: if the mean is μ, then 75 is X, which is 75. So X = μ + z * σ. So rearranged, μ = X - z * σ. Yes, that's correct. So yes, μ is 75 minus 0.5244 * 14. So the mean is 75 - (0.5244 *14). Looking at the options, option F is 75 - 0.5244(14), which would make sense.

Wait, but another thought—am I using the correct percentile? Because the problem says 30% live longer than 75. So, 75 is the 70th percentile. So, the z-score is positive because 75 is above the mean. So, μ is 75 minus z * σ. Wait, no, wait. Because X is 75, which is above the mean. So, X = μ + z * σ. So, 75 = μ + z *14 → μ =75 - z*14. So, yes, that's correct. So the mean is 75 minus (z *14). So the mean is less than 75, which makes sense. So, the options are F and G. F is 75 -0.5244(14), G is 75 + 0.4756(14).

Wait, but I thought the z-score for 70th percentile is 0.5244, so that's correct. So the mean is 75 - (0.5244 *14). So the correct option is F.

Wait, but let me think again about the calculation. 0.5244 *14 is approximately 7.3416. So 75 minus 7.3416 is about 67.6584. That seems too low, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 0.70 in terms of z, but that would give a higher mean. Wait, no—no, I think the logic is correct. So, the mean would be 75 minus the z-score times 14.

Wait, but another angle: in the standard normal distribution, the 70th percentile is the value where 70% of the data is below it. So, the z-score for 70% is 0.5244. So, that's correct. So, the mean is 75 minus (0.5244 *14), which is option F.

The problem involves finding the mean longevity when 30% of people live longer than 75 years, assuming a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 14 years. Since 30% live longer than 75, 75 is the 70th percentile. The z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile is approximately 0.5244. Using the formula for the mean in terms of the percentile value:

\[
\mu = X - z \cdot \sigma
\]

Substituting the given values (\(X = 75\), \(z = 0.5244\), \(\sigma = 14\)):

\[
\mu = 75 - (0.5244 \cdot 14)
\]

Thus, the mean longevity is \(75 - 0.5244(14)\), which corresponds to option **F**.
