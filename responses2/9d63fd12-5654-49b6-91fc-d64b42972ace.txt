Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about a rhombus QRST. The diagonals intersect at point P. I need to find the measure of angle TSP. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. That means they cut each other exactly in half and form 90-degree angles where they meet. 

The problem states that the measure of angle QTS is 76 degrees. Let me visualize rhombus QRST. Let me label the vertices: Q, R, S, T. So, the sides are QR, RS, ST, and TQ. The diagonals are QS and RT, intersecting at point P.

Since the diagonals intersect at P, they form four right triangles within the rhombus. For example, triangle QPT, triangle TSP, etc. Each of these triangles is a right-angled triangle because the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees.

Now, angle QTS is given as 76 degrees. Let me figure out where angle QTS is located. In the rhombus QRST, angle QTS is at vertex T, between sides QT and TS. Wait, no, actually, angle QTS is at point T, but looking at the points Q-T-S, that's the angle at T. So, Q-T-S is the angle between the two sides meeting at T, which are TQ and TS. 

Since QRST is a rhombus, the sides QT and TS are adjacent sides meeting at T. The angle between them is 76 degrees. Now, in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, each of these diagonals will split the angles into two equal parts.

Wait, but no. Actually, in a rhombus, each diagonal bisects the vertex angles. So, the diagonal QS will bisect angle Q, and RT will bisect angle T. But angle QTS is at T, so maybe the diagonal RT passes through T and P, and splits angle T into two equal parts.

Wait, maybe I should think about the triangles formed by the diagonals. The diagonals intersect at P, so they form four triangles: QPT, TSP, SRP, and RQS. Each of these triangles is a right-angled triangle because the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees.

Since angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the angle at vertex T between sides QT and TS. But wait, in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles, so perhaps angle QTS is one of the angles formed by the diagonal and a side. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps angle QTS is one of the angles in triangle TSP. Because TSP is the angle at S between points T, S, and P. So, if I can find triangle TSP, which is a right-angled triangle at P, then angle TSP would be the other non-right angle in that triangle.

Wait, let me clarify: in triangle TSP, point P is where the diagonals intersect. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, angle at P is 90 degrees. So, in triangle TSP, angle at P is 90, angle at S would be something, and angle at T would be another.

But wait, angle QTS is 76 degrees. Let's see: angle QTS is at T, between sides Q-T and S-T. So, in the rhombus, the diagonal RT would pass through T and P, bisecting angle T into two equal parts. So, angle QTS is 76 degrees, but that's the angle between QT and TS, which is a side and a diagonal. Wait, actually, no. Wait, in the rhombus, the diagonal RT connects R to T, so point T is connected to R and S. So, angle QTS is the angle at T between Q-T and S-T. So, that's the angle between side QT and side ST.

Wait, but in the rhombus, the diagonal RT is a diagonal, so it splits angle T into two equal angles. So, if angle QTS is 76 degrees, that's the angle between side QT and diagonal RT. So, the diagonal RT splits angle T into two angles of 76/2 = 38 degrees each.

So, each of the angles formed by diagonal RT at point T is 38 degrees. So, at point T, the diagonal RT is splitting angle T into two 38-degree angles. Now, looking at triangle TSP, which is part of the rhombus. Wait, no, triangle TSP is not a triangle in the rhombus; perhaps I'm mixing up the points.

Wait, maybe I should label the points again. Let me think: in rhombus QRST, the four vertices are Q, R, S, T in order. So, the sides are QR, RS, ST, and TQ. The diagonals are QS and RT, which intersect at P. So, the diagonals divide the rhombus into four right-angled triangles.

So, angle QTS is the angle at T between sides QT and TS. But in the rhombus, the sides QT and TS meet at T, and the diagonal RT is from R to T. So, angle QTS is actually the angle between side QT and diagonal RT. Wait, no, angle QTS is between sides QT and TS, which are sides of the rhombus. But the diagonal RT is from R to T, so perhaps angle QTS is a part of triangle QTR? Or maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angles created by the diagonals. Since the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees, each of the four triangles formed is a right-angled triangle. So, triangle QPT is right-angled at P, triangle TSP is right-angled at P, etc.

Now, angle QTS is 76 degrees. So, point Q-T-S. So, in the rhombus, the angle at T between sides QT and TS is 76 degrees. The diagonal RT from R to T splits this angle into two equal parts, each of 38 degrees. So, angle QTR is 38 degrees, and angle STP would be 38 degrees as well? Or wait, perhaps not. Let me clarify.

Wait, at point T, the angle is 76 degrees between QT and ST. The diagonal RT is drawn from R to T, and it splits this angle into two parts. So, the angle between QT and RT is 38 degrees, and the angle between RT and ST is also 38 degrees. So, RT is the angle bisector of angle T, splitting it into two 38-degree angles.

Now, considering triangle TSP. Point S is connected to point T and P. So, in triangle TSP, we have a right angle at P because the diagonals intersect at right angles. The other two angles are at S and T.

Wait, but angle at T in triangle TSP is not the same as angle QTS. Because angle QTS is the angle between QT and TS, which is 76 degrees, but in triangle TSP, the angle at T is between TS and SP. So, perhaps angle at T in triangle TSP is different from the 38 degrees. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the diagonals intersect at P, and in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles. So, angle QTS is 76 degrees at point T. The diagonal RT bisects angle T into two angles of 38 degrees each. So, angle between RT and ST is 38 degrees.

Now, in triangle TSP, which is a right-angled triangle at P, the angles at S and T are the other two angles. Let's call angle at S as angle TSP, which is what we're looking for, and angle at T as angle STP.

Wait, but in the rhombus, the sides QT and TS are equal in length, and the sides QR and RS are equal. Also, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, all four triangles formed are congruent right-angled triangles.

Wait, but angle QTS is 76 degrees. So, in triangle TSP, which is a right-angled triangle at P, the angles at T and S would be 38 degrees each, but that can't be because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180. Wait, no, that's not correct because angle T in triangle TSP is not the same as angle QTS.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, angle at T is 76 degrees, so each of the two angles formed by diagonal RT is 38 degrees. So, at point T, angle between RT and ST is 38 degrees, and the angle between RT and QT is 38 degrees as well.

Now, in triangle TSP, which is a right-angled triangle at P, the angles at S and T would sum to 90 degrees. Wait, no, because triangle TSP is formed by points T, S, and P. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, angle at P is 90 degrees, so the other two angles must add up to 90.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find another approach. Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the four triangles are all congruent. So, each triangle has angles that are half of the angles of the rhombus.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to consider the angles at the diagonals. Since diagonal RT splits angle T into two 38-degree angles, then in triangle TSP, which is formed by one of these 38-degree angles and the right angle at P, the other angle would be 52 degrees? Because 38 + 52 = 90. Wait, no, because triangle TSP is a right-angled triangle at P, and one of its angles is 38 degrees (from the diagonal RT). So, the other non-right angle would be 90 - 38 = 52 degrees. So, angle TSP would be 52 degrees.

So, looking at the options, option E is 52. So, the answer should be E: 52.

Wait, let me double-check that reasoning. In the rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees. The angle at T is 76 degrees, so the diagonal RT splits it into two 38-degree angles. Now, in triangle TSP, which is a right-angled triangle at P, one of the angles is 38 degrees (from triangle RT split by diagonal). Therefore, the other non-right angle is 90 - 38 = 52 degrees. So, angle TSP is 52 degrees. That should be option E.
</think>

The diagonals of rhombus QRST intersect at P, creating right angles. Angle QTS is 76 degrees, which is bisected by diagonal RT into two 38-degree angles. In triangle TSP, which is right-angled at P, one angle is 38 degrees. Thus, the other angle (angle TSP) is 90 - 38 = 52 degrees.

Answer: E: 52
