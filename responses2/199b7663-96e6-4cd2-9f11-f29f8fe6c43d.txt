Question:

What was the importance of peace research during the 1980s?

Options:

A: Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.
B: There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.
C: The importance of peace research was largely due to its focus on economic stability, rather than political or military issues.
D: The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.
E: Peace research was not relevant during the 1980s due to the lack of major conflicts.
F: Peace research was primarily used for the development of military strategies during the period of the Cold War.
G: There was an increased focus on peace research due to the rise in global terrorism.
H: The importance of peace research was diminished as it was seen as too theoretical and not applicable to real-world situations.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the importance of peace research during the 1980s. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking what was the importance of peace research back then. The options are A through H. I'll need to go through each one and think about what I know about peace research during that decade.

First, what do I remember about peace research? I think it's a field that looks at the causes and solutions for world peace. It probably involves looking at issues like conflict, arms control, international relations, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically oriented with immediate policy responsibility accountable to major powers. Hmm, major powers in the 1980s were like the US, UK, and probably others. So, if it was politically oriented, that might mean it's influenced by the major powers' priorities. That makes sense because policy is often tied to the nations or countries involved.

Option B: European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The 1980s were part of the Cold War, and security issues were a big topic. So maybe peace research, especially in Europe, became more about security, which in turn became a political issue. So this could be a point of contention or a development. But I'm not sure if this was the main reason or just one aspect.

Option C: The focus was on economic stability rather than political or military issues. I don't think that's right. I remember peace research often looked at more than just economic factors. It seems more about the social and political aspects, like how conflicts are structured.

Option D: Political theory was dominant, and peace research was isolated. I don't think so. The field definitely was influenced by political theory, especially since many of the issues like international relations and conflict were studied through political theory.

Option E: Peace research wasn't relevant during the 1980s because of lack of major conflicts. No, that doesn't sound right. I remember hearing about the Cold War and how peace research was more about understanding the issues rather than predicting conflicts. So maybe it was more about the theory and analysis, not just the practical application.

Option F: Primary focus on military strategies during Cold War. That seems a bit off. I think peace research was more about understanding the structure of conflict, not just military tactics.

Option G: Increased focus on global terrorism. I'm not sure about this. While global terrorism is a current issue, I don't recall specific studies from the 1980s focusing on that. Maybe it's a more recent development.

Option H: Peace research diminished because it was seen as too theoretical. I think that's more of a trend now. Theoretical research can become less relevant if it doesn't address real-world problems. But was that the case during the 1980s? I'm not certain.

So going back to option A: It's talking about being inter-disciplinary, politically oriented, and with major powers responsible. That fits because in the 1980s, the US, UK, and perhaps others were major players. So policy responsibility was tied to these powers, which made sense during that time. Peace research was about understanding how conflicts develop and what can be done about them, which is a broad field that requires international cooperation.

Option B is about Europe's security studies becoming political. While security was a big topic, I think the main focus was more on the causes and structure of conflict, not just the political aspects. So maybe B isn't the primary reason.

Option D and E don't seem right. Peace research wasn't just about theory; it had practical implications too. So D is about theory dominating and peace research being separate, which doesn't fit. E is about relevance, but there were definitely studies during that time.

So I think option A is the correct answer because it highlights the interdisciplinary nature and the political responsibility tied to major powers. That makes peace research a key area for policy decisions in the early 1980s.

The importance of peace research during the 1980s, as highlighted in the options, stems from its focus on understanding the causes and solutions for world peace. It was inter-disciplinary, influenced by major powers, and had immediate policy responsibilities, such as those of the US, UK, and others. This ties into the political orientation and the need for international cooperation.
