Okay, so I've got this question about barometers and the density of gallium. Hmm, I remember that barometers measure pressure, right? Mercury barometers are the classic ones, right? They use mercury in a column, and the height depends on the atmospheric pressure. But wait, this question is using gallium instead of mercury. So, I guess the approach is similar but using the density of gallium instead.

Let me think about how a barometer works. The pressure is supported by a column of liquid. The pressure at the bottom of the column (where the atmospheric pressure is) must balance the pressure from the column itself. So I think I need to use the formula involving density, gravity, and the height of the liquid column.

Wait, the formula I remember is P = ρgh, where P is pressure, ρ is density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height. But wait, in this question, they're comparing the gallium barometer to mercury. So the height in gallium's barometer would be higher or lower than mercury's? Because if the density is higher, the same pressure would require a shorter column. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Mercury is less dense than gallium, so if the pressure is the same, the height would be shorter. So in the mercury case, the height is higher, and in gallium, it's shorter. But wait, the question is about how much height the gallium column would have at 1atm pressure.

Wait, wait, the question says, what is the height of a gallium column sustained at 1 atm. So it's the same pressure as 1 atm, but using the density of gallium. So it's like, how tall would a gallium column be at 1 atm pressure.

So, the formula would be the same: pressure = density * gravity * height. But wait, I need to be careful about units. The question gives the density in g/cm³, and the height is to be expressed in mm. So let me convert the units properly.

First, I'll need to find the height in cm, then convert to mm. So let me outline the steps:

1. Convert 1 atm pressure to Pascals. Because the density is in g/cm³, and I want to use meters and kilograms. I remember 1 atm is about 101325 Pascals. Let me check that number. Yeah, 1 atm is 101325 Pa.

2. Convert density of gallium to kg/m³. Because the standard unit for density in these calculations is kg/m³. The given density is 6.09 g/cm³. To convert to kg/m³, I multiply by 1000 (since 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³). So 6.09 g/cm³ * 1000 = 6090 kg/m³.

Wait, wait, no. Because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So yes, 6.09 g/cm³ is 6.09 * 1000 = 6090 kg/m³.

3. The formula is P = ρ * g * h. So solving for h: h = P / (ρ * g).

4. Now, I need to plug in the numbers. But wait, what units for g? Since earlier I used Pascals, I need g in m/s². So g is about 9.80665 m/s².

So, let's compute h:

h = P / (ρ * g) = (101325 Pa) / (6090 kg/m³ * 9.80665 m/s²)

Wait, wait, but wait: wait, the units may complicate things, but since I'm using the same units, let me compute step by step.

So, denominator: 6090 kg/m³ * 9.80665 m/s² = 6090 * 9.80665. Let me calculate that.

6090 * 9.80665:

Let me approximate 6090 * 10 is 60900, but since 9.80665 is about 0.2 less than 10, I'll subtract a little.

6090 * 9.80665 ≈ 6090 * 9.8 = 6090 * (10 - 0.2) )= 6090*10 - 6090*0.2 = 60900 - 1218 = 60900 - 1218 = 59682.

Wait, but maybe I should use a calculator approach. Let me compute 6090 * 9.80665 more accurately.

Wait, 9.80665 is approximately 9.8067.

So 6090 * 9.8067 = let me compute 6090 * 9 = 54810, 6090 * 0.8 = 4872, 6090 * 0.0067 ≈ 40.743.

Adding all: 54810 + 4872 = 59682, plus 40.743 is 59722.743 kg/(m²s²) or kg/(m·s²) which is the same as kg/(m·s²) which is the correct unit for pressure (since P = kg/(m·s²)).

So denominator is approximately 59722.743 kg/(m·s²).

Now, numerator is 101325 Pa, which is 101325 kg/(m·s²).

So h = 101325 / 59722.743 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 101325 by 59722.743:

Approximately 1.7 (since 59722 * 1.7 = 59722 * 1 + 59722 * 0.7 = 59722 + 41805.4 ≈ 101527.4, which is a bit higher than 101325. So maybe around 1.696).

Wait, let me do it more precisely.

Let me compute 59722.743 * 1.7 = 59722.743 * 1 = 59722.743,

plus 0.7 * 59722.743 → 41805.9201.

Total is approx 59722.743 + 41805.9201 = 101528.6631. But our numerator is 101325, which is 1033.6631 less than that. So how much less is 101325 compared to 101528.6631? It's a difference of 203.6631.

So, each 1 unit of h gives 59722.743. So 203.6631 / 59722.743 ≈ 0.00341. So the h is approximately 1.7 - 0.00341 = about 1.69659 meters.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because I think I messed up the decimal points. Let me correct.

Wait, wait, the denominator calculation is 6090 * 9.80665 ≈ 59722.743 kg/(m·s²). So denominator is 59722.743 kg/(m·s²).

Wait, pressure in Pa is kg/(m·s²). So denominator is kg/(m·s²), numerator is kg/(m·s²), so the division will be (kg/(m·s²)) / (kg/(m·s²)) ) → unitless, giving a dimensionless value — which is correct for height (meters).

So h = 101325 / 59722.743 ≈ let me compute that.

101325 ÷ 59722.743 ≈ 1.7 meters.

Wait, but wait, 59722.743 is approximately 5.972e4 (59,722.743), and 101,325 is 1.013e5.

So 1.013e5 / 5.972e4 ≈ (1.013 / 5.972) * 10 ≈ approximately (0.17) * 10 = 1.7 meters.

Wait, but wait, let's do it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.01325e5 / 5.9722743e4.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e4: 10.1325 / 5.9722743 ≈ 1.695.

So, h ≈ 1.695 meters. But wait, wait, that's 1695 mm. Because 1 meter is 1000 mm. So 1.695 m = 1695 mm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is A: 1697 mm, which is about 1697 mm. So the answer would be approximately 1697 mm.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, let me make sure about the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 101325 / (6090 *9.80665).

Compute 6090 *9.80665:

6090 * 9 = 54,810;

6090 * 0.8 = 4,872;

6090 * 0.00665 = approx 6090 * 0.006 = 36.54, plus 6090 * 0.00065 = 3.9585 → total 36.54 +3.9585≈40.4985.

So 6090 *9.80665 ≈ 54,810 + 4,872 = 59,682 +40.5≈59,722.5 kg/(m·s²).

So denominator is 59,722.5.

Numerator: 101,325.

So 101,325 /59,722.5 = let's compute it.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 101.325 /59.7225.

Hmm, 59.7225 *1.695 = let's check.

59.7225 * 1 =59.7225

59.7225 * 0.6 =35.8335 → total 59.7225 +35.8335 =95.556

59.7225 *0.09 =5.375025 → total 95.556 +5.375025=100.931

Wait, but 100.931 is more than 101.325. So 1.695 would give 100.931. So to get 101.325, it's 1.695 + (0.394 /59.7225).

Wait, 0.394 /59.7225 ≈0.0066.

So 1.695 +0.0066≈1.7016 meters.

Wait, but as before, that gives h =1.7016 m =1701.6 mm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1697 mm. So about 1697. Hmm. So why is my calculation giving 1701.6? Did I make a mistake?

Let me recheck the calculations because perhaps I lost a decimal point somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units in the initial step. Let me recompute the denominator.

Wait, I think I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me recalculate 6090 kg/m³ *9.80665 m/s².

Calculating 6090 * 9.80665:

Let me compute 6000 *9.80665 = 58,839.9.

Then 90 *9.80665 = 882.5985.

So 58,839.9 +882.5985 =59,722.4985 kg/(m²·s²) → same as kg/(m·s²), which is correct because pressure is in Pascals (kg/(m·s²)).

So the denominator is correct.

So 101325 /59722.4985 ≈ ?

Let me compute 101325 divided by 59722.5.

Well, 59722.5 * 1.7 = 59722.5 *1.7 → 59722.5 *1=59722.5, 59722.5 *0.7=41805.75 → total 101528.25.

Which is a bit higher than 101325, so 1.7 is too high. So 1.69722 m? Let me compute 1.69722 *59722.5.

Wait, wait, let me compute 1.69722 *59722.5:

1.69722 *59722.5 = ?

Let me compute:

1 * 59722.5 =59722.5

0.69722 *59722.5 → 0.69722 is approximately 0.69722 ≈ 0.6972.

0.6972 *59722.5 = 59722.5 * (0.6 + 0.09 +0.0072)

=59722.5 *0.6 =35833.5

59722.5 *0.09=5375.025

59722.5 *0.0072=426.396

Adding all: 35833.5 +5375.025=41208.525 +426.396=41634.921.

So 0.6972 *59722.5 ≈41634.921.

So total 59722.5 +41634.921=101357.421.

Wait, but our numerator is 101325, which is a bit less than this. So the actual h is a little less than 1.69722 m.

Wait, but wait, that's conflicting with earlier calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it using a calculator-style approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation steps, so let me try another approach.

Let me use the formula:

h = (P) / ( ρ * g )

So P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

ρ =6.09 g/cm³ = 6090 kg/m³.

g=9.80665 m/s².

So plug in the numbers:

h = 101325 / (6090 *9.80665 )

Compute denominator: 6090 *9.80665 = 6090 * (9 + 0.8 + 0.00665) → 6090 *9=54810, 6090*.8=4872, 6090*.00665≈40.4985 → sum 54810+4872=59682 +40.4985=59722.4985.

So denominator is 59722.5.

So h=101325 /59722.5 ≈ let's compute that as a division.

We can compute it as 101325 ÷59722.5.

But 59722.5 is approximately 5.97e4, and 101325 is 1.013e5.

So 1.013e5 /5.97e4 → (1.013 /5.97) *10 → approx (0.17) *10 →1.7 meters.

Wait, but again I'm getting 1.7 meters, which is 1700 mm. But the options don't have 1700, but option A is 1697 mm. So perhaps I did a miscalculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values, like using the exact value of g.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of g as 9.80665 m/s², which is more precise.

So, perhaps I should compute denominator as 6090 *9.80665.

Let me compute 6090 *9.80665.

6090 *9 =54810.

6090 *0.8=4872.

6090 *0.00665= let's compute 6090 *0.006=36.54; 6090 *0.00065=4.0035.

So 36.54 +4.0035=40.5435.

So total denominator is 54810 +4872=59682 +40.5435=59722.5435 kg/(m·s²).

So denominator is 59722.5435.

Now, h = 101325 /59722.5435.

So let's compute this division.

59722.5435 *1.7 →59722.5435 *1=59722.5435, *0.7=41805.7805. So sum 59722.5435 +41805.7805=101528.324.

Which is higher than 101325 by 100.324.

So how much less than 1.7 is the required h?

Let me compute 101325 /59722.5435.

We can express it as 101325 =59722.5435 *x + remainder.

So, the value x is approximately 1.7 minus (101325 -59722.5435 *1.7) /59722.5435.

Wait, let me compute 59722.5435 *1.7:

59722.5435 *1 =59722.5435.

59722.5435 *0.7 =41805.78045.

Adding them: 59722.5435 +41805.78045 =101528.32395.

Now, the numerator is 101325, which is less than 101528.32395 by 203.32395.

So, the remainder is 203.32395.

So, (101325 -59722.5435*1.7 )=203.32395.

So the fraction is 203.32395 /59722.5435 ≈ approximately 0.00341.

So, the value x is 1.7 -0.00341 ≈1.69659.

So h ≈1.69659 meters.

Which is 1696.59 mm. So about 1697 mm, which matches option A.

Hmm, but earlier I thought I made a mistake because I thought the answer was 1.695 meters, which is 1695 mm. But the calculation here is more precise, and the result is approximately 1696.6 mm, which is 1697 mm.

So, the correct answer should be A: 1697 mm.
