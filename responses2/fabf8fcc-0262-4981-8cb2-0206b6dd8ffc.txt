Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about cyclotron frequency and I need to find the mass of a particle. Let me think through this step by step. I remember that cyclotron frequency has something to do with the motion of charged particles in a magnetic field. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, so I'll need to recall what I learned in class.

The question says the particle has a charge twice that of an electron. Oh right, an electron's charge is about 1.6e-19 coulombs, so twice that would be 3.2e-19 C. Got it.

The magnetic field strength is π/4 tesla. π is approximately 3.14, so π/4 is about 0.785 tesla. Perpendicular to the velocity, so the motion is circular, right? Because a charged particle moving perpendicular to a magnetic field experiences a centripetal force, causing circular motion.

The cyclotron frequency is given as 1,600 Hz. Wait, cyclotron frequency is the frequency at which the particle completes a cycle. I think the formula for cyclotron frequency (f) is related to the magnetic field (B), the charge (q), the mass (m), and the velocity (v). Oh, right, the formula is f = (qB)/(2πm). Yeah, that rings a bell. Because the angular frequency ω is qB/m, and frequency is ω/(2π).

So, solving for mass m: m = (qB)/(2πf). Let's plug in the values.

q is 3.2e-19 C. B is π/4 T, which is 0.785 T. f is 1600 Hz.

Plugging these into the equation: m = (3.2e-19 C * 0.785 T) / (2 * π * 1600 Hz). Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: 3.2e-19 * 0.785. Let me compute 3.2 * 0.785. 3 * 0.785 is 2.355, 0.2 * 0.785 is 0.157. Adding them gives 2.512. So 2.512e-19 C·T.

Denominator: 2 * π * 1600. Pi is about 3.1416, so 2 *3.1416 is about 6.2832. Multiply by 1600. 6.2832 * 1600. Let's see, 6 *1600 = 9600; 0.2832 *1600 is approximately 453.12. So total is around 10,053.12.

So m = (2.512e-19) / (10,053.12). Let me compute that.

Divide 2.512e-19 by 1e4 (which is 10,000) to get 2.512e-23. But wait, 10,053 is a bit more than 1e4, so maybe around 2.5e-19 / 1e4 = 2.5e-23, but the actual denominator is 10,053.12, so the denominator is ~1e4 * 1.005312.

So 2.512e-19 / (1e4 * 1.005312) )= (2.512 /10053.12 )e-19. Let me compute 2.512 /10053.12. Hmm, 10053 is approx 1e4, 2.512e-19 / 1e4 is 2.512e-23. But since denominator is a bit larger, the mass is a bit smaller. Let me compute 2.512 /10053.12.

Wait, 10053.12 is ~10,053.12. 2.512e-19 / (10,053.12) = (2.512 /10053.12) * 1e-19.

Wait, 2.512 /10053.12 is approximately 2.512 ÷ 1e4 = 2.512e-4. So 2.512e-4 *1e-19 = 2.512e-23 kg.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 2.512 divided by 10053.12.

Let me calculate 10053.12 ÷ 2.512. Let's see, 10053.12 divided by 2.512. Well, 2.512 * 4000 = 10,048. So 2.512 * 4000 = 10,048. So 2.512 * 4000 = 10048, which is just a bit less than 10053.12.

Wait, 2.512 *4000=10048, so 10048 +5.12 =10053.12.

So 2.512 * x =10053.12. x= (10053.12)/(2.512) =4000 + (5.12/2.512). 5.12/2.512 is approx 2.036.

So 4000 +2.036 =4002.036. So 2.512/(10053.12) =1/(4002.036) ≈2.5e-4.

So, 2.512e-19 /10053.12 is approximately (2.512e-19) * (1/10053.12) )=2.512e-19 * (2.5e-4) )= 2.512 *2.5e-23 =6.28e-23 kg. But wait, no, wait. Because 1/10053.12 ≈0.0000995, which is about 1e-4. So 2.512e-19 * 1e-4 =2.512e-23, but with a tiny bit more.

Wait, perhaps I should use calculator-like approach. Let me compute 2.512e-19 / (10053.12).

So 2.512e-19 / 10053.12 = (2.512 / 10053.12) * 1e-19.

Compute 2.512 /10053.12.

Hmm, 10053 is about 10000.

2.512 /10000 is 0.0002512.

But 10053 is larger than 10000 by 53. So 2.512 /10053 is approximately 0.0002512 - (53 * 0.0000002512).

Wait, perhaps more accurately, 2.512 /10053.12= (2.512)/(1.005312e4) )=2.512/(1.005312 *1e4) )= (2.512/1.005312) *1e-4.

Compute 2.512 /1.005312: Let me do 1.005312 *2.5 = 2.5133. Oh wait, 1.005312 *2.5 = approximately 2.5133. But our numerator is 2.512, which is a bit less than 2.5133. So approximately 2.5 * (2.5133/2.512) which is about 2.5 * (2.5133/2.512) ≈2.5 * (approx 1.0026). So 2.5 *1.0026 ≈2.5065. So 2.512/1.005312≈2.5065. So 2.5065 *1e-4 =2.5065e-4.

So 2.512e-19 /10053.12 =2.5065e-4 *1e-19 =2.5065e-23 kg.

So m≈2.5065e-23 kg. Let me look at the options.

Options: Let's see the options are in the format of 1e-22, 1e-23, etc.

A: 3.3e-22

B:6.7e-23

C:7.5e-21

D:4.1e-22

E:1.0e-21

F:5.0e-21

G:2.5e-23

H:8.3e-22

I:1e-21

J:9e-23

So our calculation gives around 2.5e-23 kg. Looking at the options, option F is 5.0e-21 which is way bigger, option G is 2.5e-23. So J is 9e-23, which is larger, H is 8.3e-22, which is about 8e-22. Our calculation is 2.5e-23, which is 0.25e-22, so 2.5e-23 is in the 2.5e-23 range.

Wait, the options don't have exactly 2.5e-23. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 3.3e-22

B:6.7e-23

C:7.5e-21

D:4.1e-22

E:1e-21

F:5.0e-21

G:2.5e-23

H:8.3e-22

I:1e-21

J:9.0e-23

So option G is 2.5e-23, which is exactly what I got. So the answer should be option G. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the formula, cyclotron frequency f = (qB)/(2πm). So m = (qB)/(2πf).

Wait, substituting the numbers again.

q = 3.2e-19 C, B=π/4 T, f=1600 Hz.

So m= (3.2e-19 * 0.785) / (2 * π * 1600).

Compute numerator: 3.2e-19 * 0.785 ≈2.512e-19 C·T.

Denominator: 2 * π * 1600 = 10053.12.

So m = 2.512e-19 / 10053.12 = approx 2.512e-23 kg.

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier in the approach. Let me recompute the denominator.

Wait, 2*π*1600 = 2*3.1416*1600= 6.2832 *1600. Let me compute 6 *1600=9600. 0.2832 *1600=453.12. So total 10053.12. So that's correct.

Wait, then why is option G 2.5e-23, which is exactly the same as the calculation. So the answer is G: 2.5e-23 kg.

To determine the mass of the particle, we use the formula for cyclotron frequency:

\[
f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
\]

Rearranging for mass \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{qB}{2\pi f}
\]

### Given values:
- Charge of the particle: \(q = 2e-19 \, \text{C}\) (twice the electron charge).
- Magnetic field: \(B = \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{T} \approx 0.785 \, \text{T}\).
- Cyclotron frequency: \(f = 1600 \, \text{Hz}\).

### Calculation:
1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   qB = (3.2 \times 10^{-19}) \times (0.785) \approx 2.512 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C·T}.
   \]

2. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   2\pi f = 2 \times \pi \times 1600 \approx 10053.12.
   \]

3. Divide numerator by denominator:
   \[
   m = \frac{2.512 \times 10^{-19}}{10053.12} \approx 2.512 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

### Comparison with options:
The calculated mass \(m \approx 2.512 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{kg}\) matches closely with option **G: 2.5 × 10⁻²³ kg**.
