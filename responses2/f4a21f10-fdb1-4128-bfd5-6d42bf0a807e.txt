Okay, so I need to find the product of 5.7 multiplied by 8 using the Distributive Property. Hmm, let me think. The Distributive Property is something like a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, maybe I can break down 5.7 into parts that are easier to multiply by 8.

Let me rewrite 5.7 as 5 + 0.7. That should make it easier to distribute. So, 5.7 times 8 is the same as (5 + 0.7) multiplied by 8. Breaking it down, that would be 5 * 8 plus 0.7 * 8.

Calculating each part separately: 5 times 8 is straightforward. 5 multiplied by 8 is 40. Then, 0.7 multiplied by 8. Wait, 0.7 is the same as 7 tenths. So, 7 tenths times 8 is 56 tenths. But 56 tenths is the same as 5.6. 

Now, adding those two results together: 40 plus 5.6 equals 45.6. So, the product of 5.7 and 8 is 45.6. Looking at the options, option E is 45.6. That should be the correct answer.

The product of 5.7 and 8 using the Distributive Property is calculated as follows:

\[
5.7 \times 8 = (5 + 0.7) \times 8 = (5 \times 8) + (0.7 \times 8) = 40 + 5.6 = 45.6
\]

**Answer:** E: 45.6
