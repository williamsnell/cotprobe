Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about the radius of the circular path of ionized isotopes projected into a uniform magnetic field. The key points are that the isotope's initial velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and all have the same speed. We need to find which combination of mass and charge will result in the largest radius.

I remember from my notes that the radius of the circular path of a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by the formula r = (mv)/(qB), where:
- r is the radius,
- m is the mass,
- v is the velocity,
- q is the charge,
- B is the magnetic field strength.

Since all the particles have the same speed and the same B, the radius depends directly on (m * v) divided by (q * B). But since B and v are the same for all, the radius is proportional to (m)/(q). Wait, no, wait: more accurately, it's (mv)/(qB), so for same v and B, the radius is proportional to m/q. So larger m and smaller |q| would give a larger radius. But wait, wait, the charge could be negative or positive, but the radius formula uses absolute value of q, right? Because the force is F = qvB, and the centripetal acceleration is mv²/r. So the formula is r = mv/(qB) for motion in a plane perpendicular to B, but if q is negative, the direction of the force is opposite, but the radius is still determined by the magnitude of q. So the radius is proportional to m/|q|.

So, for each option, we can compute m/(|q|). The larger this value, the larger the radius, assuming all else is equal (same v, same B).

Let me note down each option with m and q:

A: m=20u, q=-2e → |q|=2 → 20/2=10
B: 20u, -1e → 20/1=20
C: 18u, -3e →18/3=6
D:16u, -5e→16/5=3.2
E:18u, -4e→18/4=4.5
F:17u, -4e→17/4=4.25
G:19u, -2e→19/2=9.5
H:16u, -6e→16/6≈2.666
I:21u, -1e→21/1=21
J:22u, -2e→22/2=11

Wait, I think I forgot to compute H correctly. H is 16u and q=-6e, so 16/(6) is about 2.666.

Wait, wait, for each option, what's m/(|q|)?

Let me re-calculate:

Option A: 20/(2) = 10
B:20/1=20
C:18/3=6
D:16/5=3.2
E:18/4=4.5
F:17/4=4.25
G:19/2=9.5
H:16/6≈2.666
I:21/1=21
J:22/2=11

So the largest is option I, which has 21u and q=-6e, giving 21/(6)=3.5? Wait wait, wait, wait.

Wait no, wait. 21u divided by 6 (since q is -6e) is 21/6, which is 3.5. But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate each option properly.

Wait, let me do each one correctly now:

Option A: 20 u, q=-2e → |q|=2 → 20 / 2 = 10 → radius proportional to 10.

Option B:20u, q=-1e → 20/1=20 → 20.

Option C:18u, q=-3e → 18/3=6 →6.

Option D:16u, q=-5e →16/5=3.2.

Option E:18u, q=-4e→18/4=4.5.

Option F:17u, q=-4e→17/4=4.25.

Option G:19u, q=-2e→19/2=9.5.

Option H:16u, q=-6e→16/6≈2.666...

Option I:21u, q=-1e →21/1=21 →21.

Option J:22u, q=-2e →22/2=11→11.

Wait, so option I gives 21, which is the largest. Because 21 is larger than 20, 19, 18, etc. So the radius is larger for I. But wait, what about option J: 22/(2)=11. So 21 is larger than 11, so option I has the highest value.

So the largest radius is option I, which has a radius proportional to 21/(1) =21.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

Looking back, the options are A to I, with H:16u, q=-6e.

Wait, the options given are:

Looking at the question, the options are labeled A to I.

So the largest m/(|q|) is I:21/(1)=21, which is higher than option J (22/(2)=11).

Wait, no, wait. So the largest value among all is I with 21.

Wait, but looking for the largest radius. So the correct option is I, which is option H?

Wait, looking back, the options:

H is m=16u, q=-6e → 16/6 ≈ 2.666.

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake in option I's calculation.

Wait, option I's mass is 21 u, and q is –1e. So |q|=1.

So 21/1 =21.

Yes, that's correct.

So which option has the highest m/(|q|)?

Looking at all the options:

A:10, B:20, C:6, D:3.2, E:4.5, F:4.25, G:9.5, H:2.666, I:21, J:11.

So the largest is option I (21) and J (11). Wait, but option I is 21, which is higher. So the largest radius is option I.

Wait, but wait, the options are labeled A to I. Let me double-check each.

Wait, option I is 21u, q=-1e → so 21/1=21.

Option J is 22u, q=-2e →22/2=11.

So option I has the highest value.

So the correct answer would be option I, because 21 is the highest.

But wait, looking at the options: what is option I?

Looking back, option I is m=21u, q=-1e. So yes.

But wait, looking again, the options are:

A: 20u, -2e → 20/2=10.

B:20u, -1e →20.

C:18u, -3e→6.

D:16u, -5e→3.2.

E:18u, -4e→4.5.

F:17u, -4e→4.25.

G:19u, -2e→9.5.

H:16u, -6e→2.666.

I:21u, -1e→21.

J:22u, -2e→11.

So the largest value is I:21, which is option I.

Wait, wait, but looking at the options, but it's possible that I might have made a mistake. Let me check each option again.

Wait, option I is 21u and -1e. So m/(|q|) is 21/1=21.

Option J is 22u, -2e →22/2=11. So I is higher.

So the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is labeled as option H? Let me check the options again.

Wait, no, the options are labeled A to I. So option I is the one with m=21u and q=-1e.

So the correct answer is option I, which has the highest m/(|q|).

Wait, but wait, what about option G:19u, q=-2e →19/2=9.5. So less than I.

So yes, option I has the highest value. So the correct answer is I.

To determine which combination of mass and charge results in the largest radius for the circular path of ionized isotopes projected into a uniform magnetic field, we use the formula for the radius of the path: 

\[
r = \frac{m v}{q B}
\]

Since the speed \(v\) and magnetic field \(B\) are the same for all particles, the radius is proportional to \(m / |q|\), where \(m\) is the mass and \(q\) is the charge. The particle with the largest value of \(m / |q|\) will have the largest radius.

### Calculations for Each Option:
1. **Option A**: \(m = 20 \, \text{u}, q = -2e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. **Option B**: \(m = 20 \, \text{u}, q = -1e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{20}{1} = 20
   \]

3. **Option C**: \(m = 18 \, \text{u}, q = -3e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

4. **Option D**: \(m = 16 \, \text{u}, q = -5e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{16}{5} = 3.2
   \]

5. **Option E**: \(m = 18 \, \text{u}, q = -4e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5
   \]

6. **Option F**: \(m = 17 \, \text{u}, q = -4e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{17}{4} = 4.25
   \]

7. **Option G**: \(m = 19 \, \text{u}, q = -2e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5
   \]

8. **Option H**: \(m = 16 \, \text{u}, q = -6e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{16}{6} \approx 2.666
   \]

9. **Option I**: \(m = 21 \, \text{u}, q = -1e\)  
   \[
   \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{21}{1} = 21
   \]

10. **Option J**: \(m = 22 \, \text{u}, q = -2e\)  
    \[
    \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{22}{2} = 11
    \]

### Comparison:
The calculated values of \(m / |q|\) for all options are:
- **A**: 10
- **B**: 20
- **C**: 6
- **D**: 3.2
- **E**: 4.5
- **F**: 4.25
- **G**: 9.5
- **H**: 2.666
- **I**: 21
- **J**: 11

The largest value is **21**, corresponding to **Option I**. Therefore, the combination of mass \(m = 21 \, \text{u}\) and charge \(q = -1e\) results in the largest radius.
