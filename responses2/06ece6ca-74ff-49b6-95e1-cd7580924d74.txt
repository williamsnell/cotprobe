Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about objects sliding down an incline without rotating. Hmm, let's see. The question says there are a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder, all of the same mass. They're released from rest at the top of a short incline, and the surface is super slick so they don't rotate. They just slide, which means friction is low, so their only force is gravity.

Wait, the problem is about which one reaches the bottom first. So I need to figure out which object has the best acceleration. I remember that in situations with rolling without slipping, different objects have different accelerations, but in this case, they're sliding, not rolling. So they don't spin, so it's just about their linear acceleration.

Right, the idea is that the acceleration depends on the moment of inertia. Oh wait, but wait, because they're sliding without rotating, their moment of inertia isn't the same as for rolling. So, for a sphere, the moment of inertia is (2/5)MR². For a cylinder, it's (1/2)MR². And a cube—wait, a cube's moment of inertia is... I think for a cube, the moment of inertia depends on its mass distribution. For a solid cube, the moment of inertia about an axis through its center is (1/6)MR², but wait, no, wait, no—I think I might be mixing this up.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The moment of inertia for a sphere is (2/5)MR². For a hollow cylinder (like a pipe), it's (1/2)MR², but a solid cylinder is (1/2)MR². Wait, no, that's for a hollow cylinder. Oh, wait, no, when it's a solid cylinder (like a typical metal cylinder), it's (1/2)MR². Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me clarify.

Wait, the moment of inertia for a hollow cylinder (a thin-walled cylinder) is ( MR² ). No, wait, no. The moment of inertia for a hollow cylinder about its central axis is I = MR². Wait, no, wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of the shape. For a solid cylinder (like a solid disk), it's I = (1/2)MR². For a hollow cylinder (like a hoop), I = MR². Oh wait, the question is about a cylinder, so maybe it's a solid cylinder, so I = (1/2)MR².

Now, the acceleration of a sliding object on an incline is given by a = g sin(theta) / (1 + (I)/(MR²)).

So, the formula for acceleration a is (g sinθ) divided by (1 + (I/(MR²))).

So I need to compute 1 + (I/(MR²)) for each object.

Let's list them:

Sphere: I = (2/5) MR². So I/(MR²) = 2/5. So 1 + 2/5 = 7/5.

Cube: Hmm, what's the moment of inertia for a cube. For a solid cube, I think the moment of inertia about an axis through its center is (1/6) MR². Wait, I'm not sure. Wait, for a cube, the moment of inertia about an axis through its center (like for a solid cube) is (1/6) MR². So I/(MR²) = 1/6. So 1 + 1/6 = 7/6.

Cylinder: If it's a solid cylinder, I = (1/2) MR². So I/(MR²)=1/2. So 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the cube and the cylinder might be different. Oh, wait, the options say the cube and cylinder. Oh, wait, the options are:

The options are A to J, with answers about which one reaches first. The given options are C, D, etc.

So the formula is a = g sinθ / (1 + I/(MR²)).

So for each object:

Sphere: 1 + (2/5) = 7/5. So a_sphere = (5/7) g sinθ.

Cube: 1 + (1/6) = 7/6. So a_cube = (6/7) g sinθ.

Cylinder: 1 + (1/2) = 3/2. So a_cylinder = (2/3) g sinθ.

Wait, let me compute these:

a_sphere = g sinθ * (5/7) ≈ 0.714 g sinθ.

a_cube = g sinθ * (6/7) ≈ 0.857 g sinθ.

a_cylinder = g sinθ * (2/3) ≈ 0.666 g sinθ.

Wait, wait, no—no, wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the formula is a = g sinθ / (1 + I/(MR²)).

So for the sphere:

I/(MR²) = 2/5.

So denominator is 1 + 2/5 = 7/5.

So a_sphere = g sinθ / (7/5) ) → 5g sinθ /7 ≈ 0.714 g sinθ.

Cube: I/(MR²) = 1/6 → denominator is 7/6.

So a_cube = g sinθ / (7/6) → 6g sinθ /7 ≈ 0.857 g sinθ.

Cylinder: I/(MR²)= (1/2) → denominator 3/2.

So a_cylinder = g sinθ / (3/2) → 2g sinθ /3 ≈ 0.666 g sinθ.

Wait, so the acceleration depends on the inverse of (1 + I/(MR²)).

So the smaller the 1 + I/(MR²), the higher the acceleration.

So the cube has the highest value of 1 + I/(MR²) (7/6), so it has the smallest a, so it will reach the bottom fastest.

Wait, wait no. Wait, lower a means it's moving faster, so it'll reach the bottom first.

Wait, so the moment of inertia is for a cube. So the cube's a is 6/7 g sinθ, which is higher than sphere's 5/7. Wait, no, wait—wait, 5/7 is about 0.714, and 6/7 is about 0.857. So cube's a is larger than sphere's, so cube will reach the bottom faster than the sphere. And the cylinder's a is 2/3 (approx 0.666) which is lower than the sphere's. So cylinder would reach the bottom first.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the acceleration is inversely proportional to (1 + I/(MR²)). So the larger the denominator, the smaller the a.

So, the cube has the largest denominator (7/6), so a is 6/7 g sinθ which is the lowest a. So it's the fastest.

The sphere has a denominator of 7/5, so a is 5/7 which is 0.714.

The cylinder has denominator 3/2, so a is 2/3, which is ~0.666.

So, the order from fastest to slowest is: cylinder, sphere, cube.

Wait, no—that can't be. Wait, because 2/3 is about 0.666, 5/7 is about 0.714, and 6/7 is 0.857.

So the acceleration from largest to smallest is:

a_cylinder (0.666) > a_sphere (0.714) > a_cube (0.857).

Wait wait, wait. That would mean that cube has the largest a, so it's the fastest. Then sphere, then cylinder.

So the cube reaches the bottom first, then sphere, then cylinder.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the sphere's a is 5/7 (0.714), cube's is 6/7 (0.857), which is higher than sphere. So the cube has the highest a. So cube is fastest, then sphere, then cylinder.

Wait, but wait, the cube's a is 6/7, which is bigger than sphere's 5/7. So cube would reach the bottom first.

But then, the options are:

Options C says the cube and the cylinder reach at the same time before the sphere.

Wait, but according to this, the cube (fastest), then sphere, then cylinder (slowest). So the order is cube > sphere > cylinder.

Wait, but looking again at the options, which option matches this?

Looking back at the options:

A: The object that is released first — no, all reach the bottom.

B: The object that is released last — no, cube reaches first.

C: The cube and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the sphere — that's not correct. Because cube's a is higher than sphere.

D: the sphere — no, sphere is next.

E: the cylinder — no, cylinder is slowest.

Wait, none of these options match. Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Wait, options are:

A: First release.

B: Last.

C: cube and cylinder at same time, before sphere.

D: sphere.

E: cylinder.

F: cube.

G: middle.

H: all same.

I: sphere and cylinder reach same time before cube. (I think no.)

J: sphere and cylinder reach same time before cube — no, same as I.

Wait, wait, none of the options correctly state that cube is the fastest, sphere next, cylinder slowest.

Looking at the options again.

Option C says cube and cylinder reach first and last, before sphere. No, that's not it.

Wait, the options are:

C: The cube and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the sphere. (So cube and cylinder first, then sphere.)

No, that's not correct because cube has higher a.

So, none of the options correctly state that cube is fastest, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another thought: When an object rolls without slipping, the acceleration is a = (g sinθ) / (1 + I/(MR²)), but when it slides, the only force is mg sinθ, and the acceleration is a = g sinθ * (1 - (I)/(MR²)).

Wait, wait, no, that's when considering the moment of inertia for rolling. Because when rolling, the acceleration is a = (g sinθ) (1 - (I)/(MR²)). But in this problem, the objects are sliding, so they don't rotate, so their moment of inertia is that of a point mass at the center, which for a sphere is I = (2/5) MR². For a cylinder, it's I = MR² (if it's a hollow cylinder). For a cube, it's I = (1/6) MR².

Wait, but wait, the problem says the object doesn't rotate when released. So, the moment of inertia for each is:

Sphere: I = (2/5) MR².

Cylinder: If it's a solid cylinder, I = (1/2) MR². Wait, wait, no, for a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia about its central axis is (1/2) MR². For a hollow cylinder (like a pipe), it's MR². But the question says the object doesn't rotate when released, which implies that they are sliding without any rotation. So, for a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia is (1/2) MR².

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder is (1/2) MR², which is correct. So let's recompute the accelerations.

So for each object:

Sphere: I = (2/5) MR².

So 1 + I/(MR²) = 1 + 2/5 = 7/5.

So acceleration a_sphere = g sinθ / (7/5) = (5/7) g sinθ ≈ 0.714 g sinθ.

Cube: I = (1/2) MR².

So 1 + (1/2) = 3/2.

a_cube = g sinθ / (3/2) = (2/3) g sinθ ≈ 0.666 g sinθ.

Cylinder: I = (1/2) MR² (assuming it's a solid cylinder). Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no. I think I got confused. For a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia is (1/2) MR², yes.

So a_cylinder = g sinθ / (1 + (1/2)) = g sinθ / (3/2) = (2/3) g sinθ ≈ 0.666 g sinθ.

Wait, that can't be right because 2/3 is about 0.666, which is less than the sphere's 0.714, but cube's is 0.666, which is the same as the cylinder's. So cube and cylinder reach same time? No, because their a's are different.

Wait, no, if a = 0.666 and 0.714, then the cube's a is lower than the sphere's, but equal to the cylinder's.

Wait, no, in this case, the cube and cylinder have the same a? No, wait, no.

Wait, sphere's a is 5/7 (0.714), cube's is 2/3 (0.666), cylinder's a is 2/3 (0.666). So cube and cylinder have the same a.

Wait, so in this case, cube and cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the sphere.

So looking back at the options, option C says: The cube and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the sphere.

Ah, that's option C.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the cylinder is a 'cylinder,' which could be either hollow or solid. If it's a solid cylinder, then the moment of inertia is (1/2) MR², so 1 + I/(MR²) is 3/2, so a is 2/3 g sinθ.

In that case, the cube and the cylinder have the same a, and that's the smallest. So they reach the base at the same time, before the sphere.

So the correct answer would be option C.
</think>

To determine which object reaches the base of the incline first, we analyze the acceleration of each object sliding down the incline without rotation. The acceleration is given by:

\[
a = \frac{g \sin \theta}{1 + \frac{I}{MR^2}}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia, \(M\) is the mass, and \(R\) is the radius. Since all objects have the same mass, the comparison depends on the denominator \(1 + \frac{I}{MR^2}\), which is inversely proportional to the acceleration. The object with the smallest denominator will have the largest acceleration and reach the base first.

### Moment of Inertia and Acceleration:
1. **Sphere**: The moment of inertia for a solid sphere is \(I = \frac{2}{5} MR^2\). Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   1 + \frac{I}{MR^2} = 1 + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5}
   \]
   \[
   a_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{g \sin \theta}{7/5} = \frac{5}{7} g \sin \theta \approx 0.714 g \sin \theta
   \]

2. **Cube**: The moment of inertia for a solid cube is \(I = \frac{1}{6} MR^2\). Substituting:
   \[
   1 + \frac{I}{MR^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{6}
   \]
   \[
   a_{\text{cube}} = \frac{g \sin \theta}{7/6} = \frac{6}{7} g \sin \theta \approx 0.857 g \sin \theta
   \]

3. **Cylinder**: Assuming the cylinder is a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia is \(I = \frac{1}{2} MR^2\). Substituting:
   \[
   1 + \frac{I}{MR^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   \[
   a_{\text{cylinder}} = \frac{g \sin \theta}{3/2} = \frac{2}{3} g \sin \theta \approx 0.666 g \sin \theta
   \]

### Acceleration Comparison:
- Sphere: \(a_{\text{sphere}} \approx 0.714 g \sin \theta\)
- Cube: \(a_{\text{cube}} \approx 0.857 g \sin \theta\)
- Cylinder: \(a_{\text{cylinder}} \approx 0.666 g \sin \theta\)

The smallest denominator corresponds to the largest acceleration, so the objects reach the base in the order: **Cylinder** (fastest), **Sphere**, **Cube** (slowest).

### Correct Answer:
The cylinder reaches the base first, followed by the sphere, and then the cube. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: The cube and the cylinder reach the base at the same time, before the sphere.**
