Okay, so I've got this question about Article 51 of the UN Charter and the meaning of "armed attack." Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that the UN Charter's Article 51 deals with the use of force by states. The general idea is that states can use force against each other, but it's not without conditions. I think the core is that states have the right to use force against each other if it's necessary to maintain stability, security, or to prevent an armed attack.

Now, the question is asking about what "armed attack" specifically means in Article 51. The options are A to D. Let me go through each option to see which makes the most sense.

Option A says "Armed attack includes all types of armed force." That doesn't sound right. Because Article 51 talks about the use of force, not the type of force. So maybe this is incorrect.

Option B: "Armed attack includes all high intensity instances of armed force." Hmm, high intensity could imply something that's very violent or severe. But the term "armed attack" in this context isn't about the intensity but the type of action. So I'm not sure this is correct.

Option C: "Armed attack includes terrorist attacks." That's a possibility. I think some sources say that a terrorist attack is a form of armed attack because it involves violence and aims to disrupt a state's security. So this might be a correct answer.

Option D: "An 'armed attack' gives the right to invade the aggressor state." Wait, that doesn't sound right. The right to invade is more about the right to occupy and control territory, not necessarily using force. So I don't think this is correct.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is C because a terrorist attack is considered an armed attack in the context of Article 51. The UN's Article 51 allows states to use force, including that which is a terrorist act, to maintain peace and security.

The correct answer is **C: Armed attack includes terrorist attacks**. 

**Explanation:**
- **Option C** is correct because a terrorist attack is a form of armed attack. According to Article 51 of the UN Charter, states can use force, including those involving violence aimed at disrupting the security of an aggressor state. This includes terrorist acts. The other options either describe the type of force (A) or a different right (D), which doesn't align with the specifics of Article 51.
