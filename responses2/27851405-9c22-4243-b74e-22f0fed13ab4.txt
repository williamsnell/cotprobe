Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the mole fraction of CO₂ in a supersonic transport's exhaust mixture. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that mole fraction is the ratio of the number of moles of the desired component to the total number of moles in the mixture. So, I need to find out how many moles of CO₂ there are and then divide that by the total moles of all the substances involved.

Looking at the data provided, each compound has a molecular weight and a mass. Oh wait, the mass is given in grams. Wait, but for mole calculation, I should probably use molar mass. So, for each compound, I can find the moles by dividing their mass by their molecular weight. 

Let me list the compounds and their details again:

- H₂O: Molecular Weight 18 g/mol, Mass 8.0 × 10^7 g
- CO₂: 44 g/mol, 6.6 × 10^7 g
- CO: 28 g/mol, 3.6 × 10^6 g
- NO: 30 g/mol, 3.6 × 10^6 g

Wait, the problem says "determine the mole fraction of CO₂." So I only need CO₂'s moles.

I need to calculate the moles for CO₂. So mass is 6.6e7 g. Molecular weight is 44 g/mol. So moles of CO₂ = 6.6e7 / 44. Let me compute that.

6.6e7 divided by 44. Hmm, let's see. 6.6 divided by 44 is 0.15, and the exponent is 1e7, so 0.15e7? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 44 is 4.4e1. So 6.6e7 divided by 44 is (6.6 /44) * 1e7. 6.6/44 is 0.15, so 0.15e7 is 1.5e6. So 1.5e6 moles of CO₂.

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly. 6.6e7 g = 66,000,000 g. Molecular weight is 44 g/mol. So 66,000,000 /44. Let me compute 66,000,000 divided by 44. 

Well, 44 times 1e6 is 44,000,000. That's less than 66 million. 66,000,000 minus 44,000,000 is 22,000,000. So that's 1.5e6 (since 22 million is 0.5 times 44 million, which is 0.5e7). So 1.5e6 + 0.5e7 is 6.5e6? Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, my initial calculation was 66,000,000 /44. Let me compute it more accurately.

44 times 1.5e6 is 44 *1.5 *1e6 = 66 * 1e6 = 6.6e7. Oh wait, but the mass is 6.6e7 g. So 6.6e7 g /44 g/mol is 1.5e6 mol of CO₂. Wait, no. Wait, 44 times 1.5e6 is 66e6, which is 6.6e7. So yes, 6.6e7 g is 1.5e6 moles of CO₂.

So moles of CO₂ = 1.5e6 mol.

But wait, are there other components? I don't think so. The question says this is the exhaust composition, so maybe all these are the only components contributing? Or perhaps there are more? But the question lists four compounds, so perhaps all are present.

So, I need the total moles of all the components. Let me compute each:

CO₂: 1.5e6 mol (as above)
H₂O: 8.0e7 g / 18 g/mol = (8e7 / 18) = let's compute that.

8e7 ÷18. 8/18 is 4/9, which is approximately 0.444. So 0.444e7 = 4.44e6 mol. Wait, let me calculate it accurately: 8e7 /18 = (8/18)*1e7 = (4/9)*1e7 ≈ 0.444444444...e7 = 4.444444444e6 mol.

CO: 3.6e6 g /28 g/mol = 3.6e6 /28 = let's compute: 28 × 1.2857e5 = 3.6e6. Hmm wait, 3.6e6 divided by 28 is 3.6e6 /28 = (3.6 /28)*1e6. 3.6 divided by 28 is 0.12857... So 0.12857e6 = 1.2857e5 mol.

NO: 3.6e6 g /30 g/mol = 3.6e6 /30 = 1.2e5 mol.

Now, adding all these up.

So CO₂: 1.5e6
H₂O: 4.444e6
CO: 1.2857e5
NO: 1.2e5

Wait, let me write them all in the same exponent for easier addition.

1.5e6 = 1500000
4.444e6 =44,444,444
1.2857e5 =128,570
1.2e5=120,000

Wait, adding all together: 1500000 + 44444444 = 45944444; then plus 128570 gives 46073000 +120000=46193000? Wait, maybe I should calculate each step:

Wait, let me do it properly:

CO₂: 1.5e6 → 1,500,000
H₂O: 4.44444e6 →4,444,444
CO: 1.2857e5 →128,570
NO: 1.2e5 →120,000

Adding them:

1,500,000 +4,444,444 =5,944,444

5,944,444 + 128,570 =6,073,014

6,073,014 +120,000 =6,193,014 mol total?

Wait, that can't be right. Because if each component is in millions, and we have four components, each with millions, the sum is 6 million, which seems possible.

Wait, but wait, CO₂ is 1.5e6, which is 1.5 million, then H₂O is about 4.444 million, CO is 0.12857 million, NO is 0.12 million. So adding them: 1.5 +4.444 =5.944; plus 0.12857≈6.07257; plus 0.12≈6.19257 million total moles.

So the total is 6.19257e6 moles.

Wait, wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, CO₂:1.5e6 (1.5 million)

H₂O: 4.444444444e6 (4.444444444 million)

CO: 1.285714286e5 (128,571.4286)

NO:1.2e5 (120,000)

Adding all together:

1,500,000 (CO₂)

+4,444,444.444 (H₂O) → 5,944,444.444

+128,571.4286 →5,944,444.444 +128,571.4286 =6,073,015.8726

+120,000 →6,193,015.8726 mol.

So approximately 6,193,016 mol total.

Now, the mole fraction of CO₂ is moles of CO₂ divided by total.

Moles of CO₂: 1.5e6 =1,500,000.

So 1,500,000 / 6,193,016.

Let me compute that. 1.5e6 /6.193e6 = approx 0.242.

Wait, 6.193e6 is 6,193,000. 1,500,000 /6,193,000 = approximately 0.242.

Wait, let me compute 1.5e6 /6.193e6 = 1.5 /6.193 ≈ 0.242.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.24, which is close.

But wait, wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Wait, another way to compute that: 1,500,000 /6,193,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e6: 1.5 /6.193.

Let me compute 6.193 * 0.24. 

0.24 *6=1.44, 0.24 *0.193= approx 0.04632. So 1.44 +0.04632=1.48632. That's 0.24 *6.193 =1.48632. But the numerator is 1.5, which is bigger than that. So 0.24 gives 1.486, which is less than 1.5. So the actual value is a bit higher than 0.24.

Wait, what's 0.242 *6.193 = ?

0.2 *6.193 =1.2386

0.04 *6.193=0.24772

0.002 *6.193=0.012386

Adding: 1.2386 +0.24772=1.48632; +0.012386=1.498706.

So 0.242 *6.193≈1.4987, which is just under 1.5.

So how much more do we need?

1.5-1.4987=0.0013.

We can compute how much more x beyond 0.242 gives 6.193 * (0.242 +x) =1.5.

We have 6.193 *0.242=1.4987.

We need 1.5, so 0.0013 left.

So 0.0013 /6.193 ≈ 0.0002095.

So x≈0.0002095.

So total is 0.242 +0.0002095≈0.24221.

So approximately 0.2422.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.24. Option G is 0.30, C is 0.20, etc. So the closest is 0.24, which is option H.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the options are:

A:0.28

B:0.10

C:0.20

D:0.40

E:0.35

F:0.18

G:0.30

H:0.24

I:0.15

J:0.25

So H is 0.24, which is the closest to our calculated 0.242. So the answer is H, 0.24.

To determine the mole fraction of CO₂ in the exhaust mixture, we calculate the mole fraction as the ratio of the moles of CO₂ to the total moles of all components. The molecular weights and masses of the compounds are provided, allowing us to compute the moles for each component:

1. **Moles of CO₂**:  
   The mass of CO₂ is \(6.6 \times 10^7 \, \text{g}\), and its molecular weight is \(44 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO₂} = \frac{6.6 \times 10^7}{44} = 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of H₂O**:  
   The mass of H₂O is \(8.0 \times 10^7 \, \text{g}\), and its molecular weight is \(18 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{8.0 \times 10^7}{18} \approx 4.444 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of CO**:  
   The mass of CO is \(3.6 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}\), and its molecular weight is \(28 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO} = \frac{3.6 \times 10^6}{28} \approx 1.286 \times 10^5 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Moles of NO**:  
   The mass of NO is \(3.6 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}\), and its molecular weight is \(30 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of NO} = \frac{3.6 \times 10^6}{30} = 1.2 \times 10^5 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

5. **Total moles of all components**:  
   Adding the moles of all components:  
   \[
   \text{Total moles} = 1.5 \times 10^6 + 4.444 \times 10^6 + 1.286 \times 10^5 + 1.2 \times 10^5.
   \]  
   Converting to the same exponent:  
   \[
   \text{Total moles} \approx 6.193 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

6. **Mole fraction of CO₂**:  
   The mole fraction is the ratio of the moles of CO₂ to the total moles:  
   \[
   \text{Mole fraction of CO₂} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^6}{6.193 \times 10^6} \approx 0.242.
   \]

7. **Comparison with options**:  
   The calculated mole fraction of \(0.242\) is closest to option **H (0.24)**.
