Okay, so I need to find the 5th term in a series where the first term is 2, and each subsequent term is -2 multiplied by the previous term. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, let me write down what each term would be. The first term is given as 2. Then each next term is multiplied by -2. So let's list them out step by step.

Term 1: 2

Term 2: 2 * (-2) = -4

Term 3: -4 * (-2) = 8

Term 4: 8 * (-2) = -16

Term 5: -16 * (-2) = 32

Wait, so term 5 is 32. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option C is 32. So the answer should be C.

Just to make sure I'm not making a mistake in calculations. Let me compute each step again:

Term 1: 2

Term 2: 2 * (-2) = -4

Term 3: -4 * (-2) = 8

Term 4: 8 * (-2) = -16

Term 5: -16 * (-2) = 32. Yep, that's correct. So the 5th term is 32, which is option C.

The series starts at 2 and each term is multiplied by -2. Calculating each term step by step:

- Term 1: 2  
- Term 2: 2 * (-2) = -4  
- Term 3: -4 * (-2) = 8  
- Term 4: 8 * (-2) = -16  
- Term 5: -16 * (-2) = 32  

The 5th term is **32**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
