Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, Paul owed $56.30 plus a 3% sales tax. Hmm, first I need to calculate the total amount he owes before any discounts. 

Wait, let's break it down. The original amount is $56.30, and then there's a 3% sales tax. So, I'll calculate 3% of 56.30. Let me do the math. 3% is 0.03, so 56.30 * 0.03 is... 56.30 * 0.03 equals 1.689. So adding that to the original, the total is 56.30 + 1.689 = $57.989. Oh, wait, rounding to the nearest cent, that's $57.99.

But wait, the terms are (2/10), (n/30). Oh right, that's a discount offer. So, the customer gets a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days. Otherwise, the full amount is due within 30 days. 

Paul paid one week after the agreement. Hmm, so what's the timing here? The terms are (2/10), which means 2% discount if paid within 10 days. If he doesn't pay within 10 days, it's net 30 days. So if he paid one week later, that's 7 days after the agreement. Since 7 is less than 10, he doesn't qualify for the discount. 

Oh wait, wait! Wait, the terms are (2/10), (n/30). So, the 2% is for the 10th day. So, if he pays on day 10 or earlier, he gets the discount. If he pays on day 11 or later, he doesn't get the discount. 

So, he paid one week after the agreement. Let's see, if the agreement was, say, today, then one week is 7 days. So, if the agreement is today, one week later is day 7. Since 7 is less than 10, he doesn't get the discount. 

Wait, but sometimes the terms are expressed as (2/10, n/30), meaning 2% off if paid within 10 days, else no discount but net 30 days. So, if he pays one week (7 days) after the agreement, he doesn't get the discount. 

So, he has to pay the full amount of $57.99. Wait, but let me double-check. The original amount is $56.30, plus tax. So, the total is $57.99. If he doesn't take the discount, he has to pay $57.99. 

But looking at the options, the choices are A: $57.99, B: $60.35, etc. So the correct answer would be A: $57.99. 

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation of the discount. 2% of $57.99 is 1.1598, so subtracting that: 57.99 -1.1598 is approximately $56.83. But if he doesn't take the discount, he has to pay $57.99. Since he didn't take the discount, the total is $57.99. So the answer is A.

Paul owed $56.30 plus 3% sales tax. The total amount including tax is $57.99. The terms (2/10), (n/30) mean a 2% discount if paid within 10 days. Paul paid one week after the agreement, which is less than 10 days, so no discount applies. Therefore, the amount he paid is $57.99.

Answer: A
