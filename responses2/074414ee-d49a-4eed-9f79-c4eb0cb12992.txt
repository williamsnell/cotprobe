Question:

In a hypothetical environment, fishes called pike-cichlids are visual predators of algae-eating fish (i.e., they locate their prey by sight). If a population of algae-eaters experiences predation pressure from pike-cichlids, which of the following should least likely be observed in the algae-eater population over the course of many generations?

Options:

A: Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young
B: Selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters
C: Selection for algae-eaters that reproduce more frequently
D: Selection for algae-eaters with smaller eyes
E: Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes
F: Selection for algae-eaters that can camouflage with algae
G: Selection for algae-eaters that feed on a different type of algae
H: Selection for nocturnal algae-eaters (active only at night)
I: Selection for algae-eaters with faster swimming speeds
J: Selection for algae-eaters that can burrow in the sand

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about fish predation and selection. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says that pike-cichlids are visual predators of algae-eating fish. So they use sight to find their prey. If a population of these algae-eaters experiences predation pressure from pike-cichlids, which of the following should least likely be observed over many generations?

The options are A to J, each suggesting a different trait.

Let me think about each option. So, the key point here is that pike-cichlids are predators, so the fish they eat are likely to be in areas where the pike-cichlids are present. So, the prey (the algae-eaters) would be looking for a mate or food that pike-cichlids can catch, which probably means the pike-cichlids are somewhere near the prey.

So, if the prey (algae-eaters) are under predation, their traits would be selected against. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Selection for larger female with broods of larger, more young. That makes sense because larger females might have a better chance of surviving, and if the prey is abundant, they can produce more offspring quickly. So this is likely to happen.

Option B: Selection for drab coloration. Well, fish often have coloration that's not particularly useful for predators. So if pike-cichlids can't see the color, they might not be able to find them. So maybe the fish would lose this trait. So this is possible.

Option C: Selection for reproduction frequency. If pike-cichlids are predators, they might have more opportunities to reproduce. But wait, if the prey is under selection, maybe the reproduction rate is linked. Like, if the predators are abundant, more eggs might be laid. So this is possible too.

Option D: Selection for smaller eyes. The prey is being eaten by fish that can't see well. So fish with smaller eyes might have a higher survival rate, so this could be an advantage. So D is likely.

Option E: Selection for sexually mature at a smaller size. If the prey is abundant and the fish are in a good spot, they might stop looking for food once it's there. So they might stop looking, which could mean they stop looking for prey, so they become sexually mature. So E is likely.

Option F: Selection for algal camouflaging. If pike-cichlids can't see the algae, they might be able to hide, so the algae might be hard to spot. So this would be beneficial because they can't be found by predators. So F is a likely scenario, so it's not the correct answer (the least likely to happen).

Option G: Selection for feeding on a different type. If the prey is the fish themselves, and the predators are the pike-cichlids, then the fish might have other options. So G is another possible trait, so it's not the least likely.

Option H: Selection for nocturnal. If the pike-cichlids are active at night and can't see during the day, they might target their food at night, so the algae-eaters that are active at night would be more likely to survive. So H is possible.

Option I: Selection for faster swimming speeds. If the prey is in a certain place and the fish are looking for it, maybe they need to move quickly to reach it. So faster swimming might be advantageous. I think this is a possible trait, so I's more likely.

Option J: Selection for burrowing in sand. If the pike-cichlids are active in areas where burrowing is possible, then the algae might have to burrow as well. So this would allow them to survive in those areas. So J is a possible selection.

Wait, but the question is about what's least likely to be observed. So which trait would not be selected against. So the process is that the fish are being targeted by predators, so traits that are advantageous for the prey would be selected against. So which one is not a trait that the prey would avoid.

In the options, which trait isn't a reason to avoid.

Option E: Algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller size. If the prey is abundant and they can't find anything else, they might stop looking, so they stop searching for food, meaning they stop looking for mates either. So they would stop looking for food, which might lead them to stop looking for prey. So E is likely. So the question is which is least likely.

Wait, let me think about each. Another approach: which trait is something that the prey wouldn't have an advantage in. So the prey would not be looking for that trait because it's not useful for them.

So, looking at each option:

A: Larger females. If the prey is abundant, larger females (maybe bigger prey) would have higher survival rates. So A is a likely selection.

B: Drab color. If the predators can't see them, they might not find them. So B is a likely selection.

C: Reproduction frequency. If the prey is in certain areas, maybe fish with more frequent reproduction would not be needed. So C is a possible trait.

D: Smaller eyes. If they can't see well for predators, they have a higher survival rate. So D is a likely trait.

E: sexually mature at smaller size. If they stop looking for food because it's gone, they are sexually mature. So E is a likely trait.

F: Algal camouflage. If the prey is hard to find, they can hide. So F is a likely trait.

G: Different type of algae. If they have alternative food, that could be selected for. So G is likely.

H: nocturnal. If predators can't see during the day, they target at night. So H is a likely trait.

I: Faster swimming. If the prey is in a place that requires movement, they might swim faster. So I is a likely trait.

J: Burrow. If the area is suitable, they would burrow. So J is a likely trait.

Wait, so all the options except one are traits that could be selected against. The question is which is least likely. So which one is not a trait that the prey would avoid.

Wait, the question is which should least likely be observed. So which trait would not be a reason for selection.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The scenario is that pike-cichlids are predators. So the prey (algae-eaters) are looking for the fish. So if the prey is under predation, they would have traits that help them avoid being eaten.

So, the best traits for the prey would be those that are not advantageous. So which is least likely to be selected against.

Looking again:

Option E: Algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes. If the prey are abundant, the fish might stop looking for it, so they stop looking for food. So they become sexually mature. So E is a likely trait. So it's not the correct answer.

Which traits would be least favorable for the prey. The question is which should least likely be observed. So which trait would not be selected against.

The options are A to J, each a possible trait the prey could have.

So the least likely trait would be one that's not a reason to avoid. So which of these is not something the prey would avoid.

Looking at the options, what is something that doesn't help the prey? Perhaps the one that's not a trait that is useful for survival.

Hmm. Another approach: The question is, which trait is least likely to be observed.

So, each option is a possible trait the prey could have.

So, the least likely would be the one that would not be selected against.

Wait, what's the opposite? The traits that are selected against.

So, which trait is not a reason for the prey to avoid.

The prey (algae-eaters) are under selection because they're being eaten by pike-cichlids.

So for the prey, the traits that are not advantageous would be those that are selected against.

So, for example, if the prey is looking for food, and the predators can find it, then the prey would have traits that help them find food. So traits that prevent the prey from finding food.

So, the question is which trait is least likely, meaning not an advantage.

Looking again:

Option F: Camouflage. If the fish can't see, they can't be eaten. So F is a selection for.

Option H: Active at night. If the prey is in a place where the predators are active at night, then the prey would be there and have to stay there. So H is a trait.

Option J: Burrow. If the area is suitable, and the prey can't escape, then they can burrow in the sand.

Which trait would not be a reason for selection.

Wait, the question is about which trait should least likely be observed. So the one that's not a reason for the prey to avoid.

Wait, let me think of each option:

A: Larger females. So if the prey is abundant, larger females are more likely to survive, so A is a likely trait.

B: Drab color. If they can't see, they avoid it, so B is a likely trait.

C: Reproduction frequency. Reproductive success could be linked with survival. So if the prey is present, fish might reproduce more, so C is a likely trait.

D: Smaller eyes. If they can't see, they have a higher chance of survival, so this is a likely trait.

E: sexually mature at smaller sizes. If the prey is abundant, they might stop looking for it, so becomes sexually mature. So E is a likely trait.

F: Camouflage. If they can't see, they can hide, so F is a likely trait.

G: Different algal. If other algal are better, the prey would not be attracted to the same type. So G is a likely trait.

H: nocturnal. If predators are active at night, and prey can't be found during the day, then the prey would be active at night. So H is a likely trait.

I: faster swimming. If prey is in a place that requires movement, then faster swimming would help. I is a likely trait.

J: burrow. If the area is suitable, they may burrow. So J is a likely trait.

Wait, so all options except one are traits that would be selected against.

But the question is which is least likely.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about which trait is not a trait the prey would avoid.

Alternatively, think about which trait would not be selected against. So the trait that is not a reason for survival.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to think about which trait is not about avoiding the predator. Because the predator is looking for prey, the prey are looking for the predator.

So the traits that do not help the prey would be the least likely.

Wait, the question is about the least likely to be observed. So I need to find the trait that is not a reason why the prey would survive. Or, in other words, a trait that is not selected against.

So, the traits that would be selected against are those that are unfavorable.

Wait, the question is, which trait should least likely be observed.

So, the answer would be the trait that is least likely to be selected against.

Wait, but all the options are traits that would be selected against. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, the correct answer is selection for algal-eaters that can burrow in the sand (J). Because if the pike-cichlids are active at night, and the prey (algae) are in a dark area, the pike-cichlids would be active there, and the algal-eaters would have to burrow in the sand to find the prey. So J is a likely trait. So it's not the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of what the prey would not avoid. So, the least likely is the one that the prey wouldn't avoid.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each trait in terms of what would be selected against.

The selection process: the prey (algae-eaters) are under the threat of being eaten by pike-cichlids. So the traits that help them avoid being eaten are selected against.

So, for the prey, any trait that would make them more likely to be eaten is selected against.

So, the traits that would be selected against are any that make them less likely to survive.

So, which trait is not a trait that makes the prey more likely to be eaten, meaning it's not a survival advantage.

Looking at the options:

A: Larger females. If the prey is abundant, larger females would have a higher chance of survival, so this is a survival advantage, so it's selected against.

B: Drab color. If they can't see, they avoid predators, so this is a survival advantage.

C: Reproduction frequency. If the prey is abundant, fish would reproduce more, so this is a survival advantage.

D: Smaller eyes. They can't see, so higher survival, so this is a survival advantage.

E: sexually mature at smaller size. If the prey stops being available, the fish become sexually mature. So this is a survival advantage.

F: Camouflage. If they can't see, they can hide, so this is a survival advantage.

G: Different algal. If other algal are better, the prey wouldn't be attracted to these. So G is a survival advantage.

H: nocturnal. If predators are active at night, the prey become active at night. So H is a survival advantage.

I: faster swimming. If the prey is in a place that requires movement, this is a survival advantage.

J: burrow in the sand. If it's a good spot, they can burrow. So J is a survival advantage.

So all options are traits that would be selected against, except perhaps one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. What if the trait is "no fast swimming"? That would not be a survival advantage.

But all the options are survival traits that the prey would avoid.

Wait, perhaps the least likely is the one that is a survival trait, but the question is which is least likely to be observed.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about which would not be a factor in survival.

Wait, the original question is which should least likely be observed. So we need to find the trait that is not a survival advantage.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: Algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.

Wait, but why? Because if they stop looking for food, that would lead them to become sexually mature. So E is a survival advantage.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

The correct answer is the least likely to be observed. So the trait that is not a survival trait for the prey.

Wait, perhaps the least likely is F: selection for algal camouflaging. Because if the prey is in an area where the pike-cichlids can't see, then they'd try to hide. So F is a survival advantage.

Wait, maybe another approach: which trait would not be a reason why the prey would not be selected against.

Wait, the question is about which trait is not a factor that makes the prey less likely to survive.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because if the prey is abundant, the fish would stop looking for food, so they become sexually mature. So E is a likely trait.

Wait, but I might be getting stuck. Let me think about which of these traits are not a reason for the prey to avoid.

Wait, another approach: the pike-cichlids are predators. So the prey is looking for the fish. If the prey can't find anything else, they would stop looking. So their survival depends on being able to find food. So any trait that makes them more likely to find food would be a survival advantage.

So all the options are traits that the prey would avoid, except one. Wait, but I thought all are survival traits.

Wait, perhaps the least likely is the one that is not a survival trait. Oh! Wait, the question is which trait should least likely be observed. So the one that is not a survival trait.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: selection for algal camouflaging. Because if the prey is in an area that's hard to see, the pike-cichlids can't find it, so the algal-eaters can't be eaten. So selection for algal-eaters that can camouflage is a survival trait, so F is a likely trait.

Wait, but the question is which trait is least likely. So perhaps E is a survival trait, but maybe not the least likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the least likely is selection for algal-eaters that can burrow in the sand (J). Because if the pike-cichlids are active at night and the algal-eaters can't find the food, they'd have to burrow. So J is a survival trait.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because if the prey is abundant, the fish would become sexually mature. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer that is not a trait the prey would avoid. So which trait is not a survival trait.

Wait, the question is, which trait should least likely be observed? So the one that is not a factor the prey avoids.

Wait, the question is about the least likely observation. So, the observation that is not a survival trait.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because it's a trait that the prey would not select against. Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about which trait is not a factor that the prey would avoid. For example, the fish would have a higher survival rate when they are able to find food, so traits that prevent them from doing that are selected against.

So, in that case, the trait that is a survival trait is the one that would be selected against. So the trait that is least likely to be observed is the one that is a survival trait.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about each option as a survival factor.

Option A: Larger females would have a higher chance of survival, so it's a survival trait, so this is selected against. So A is a likely trait.

Option B: Drab color would make them less likely to be eaten, so selected against.

Option C: Reproductive frequency would be higher, so selected against.

Option D: Smaller eyes would make them less likely to be eaten, selected against.

Option E: sexually mature at smaller size. If the prey is abundant, the fish become sexually mature. So this is a survival trait, so E is selected against.

Option F: Camouflaging would make them less likely to be eaten, so selected against.

Option G: Different algal would make them less likely to be eaten, selected against.

Option H: nocturnal. If the prey can't be found during the day, then the fish become active at night. So H is a survival trait.

Option I: faster swimming. If the prey is in a location that requires movement, they can do so. So I is selected against.

Option J: burrow in the sand. If they can't find the food, they have to burrow. So J is selected against.

Wait, so all the options are traits that would be selected against. So the question is, which is least likely to be observed.

But the options are all traits the prey would avoid. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The question is asking about the least likely to be observed, so the trait that is not a factor that would be selected against.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: Algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.

Wait, why? Because if the pike-cichlids are active at night and the prey are in the dark, the algal-eaters would have to move around to find food. So they would become sexually mature. So E is a survival trait, so it is a likely observation.

Wait, then perhaps the correct answer is J, but why? Because they can't find the food, so they have to burrow. So J is a survival trait.

Hmm. Maybe I'm making a wrong assumption. Let me think about each option in terms of traits that the prey would avoid.

Wait, perhaps the least likely is F: selection for algal-eaters that can camouflage. Because if the prey is in a specific area, and the algal can't be found, then the algal-eaters are less likely to be found, so F is a survival trait, so it's selected against.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which trait is the least likely to be a survival advantage.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the trait that is not a survival advantage, so the correct answer would be the one that is a survival disadvantage.

Wait, but I can't think of any. All the options are traits the prey would avoid.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The question is, which trait is least likely to be observed in the scenario where pike-cichlids are predators of algae-eaters.

So, which trait is not a reason why the prey would survive. So the correct answer would be the one that is a survival disadvantage.

Wait, but the options all are traits the prey would avoid. So perhaps none of them are correct. But the problem is, the options are provided, and one of them is the correct answer.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E: Algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.

Wait, because if the prey is abundant, the fish would stop looking for food, so they become sexually mature. So E is a survival trait.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J: Algae-eaters that can burrow in the sand.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of each option in terms of survival factors.

The question is about the least likely to be observed. So, which of these traits is not a survival trait that the prey would avoid.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but why? Because the prey would not be selecting against E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong and the correct answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the scenario. If pike-cichlids are active at night, and the algal-eaters are in a dark area, then the algal-eaters would have to move to find food. So they would become sexually mature. So E is a surviving trait.

So, all options are survival traits. So, the question is which trait should least likely be observed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is "which should least likely be observed". So, perhaps the correct answer is the trait that is not a factor in survival.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J, because they can't find the food, so they have to burrow.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think of the answer as E.

Another approach: The correct answer is E.

So, the answer is E: selection for algal-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.
</think>

The question asks which trait should least likely be observed in a scenario where pike-cichlids are predators of algae-eaters. Pike-cichlids are visual predators, meaning they preferentially locate and capture prey. The analysis of each option reveals that all traits described in the options are survival traits that the prey would avoid. For example:

- Larger females (A): More likely to survive.
- Drab color (B): Avoids being eaten.
- Reproductive frequency (C): More likely to survive.
- Smaller eyes (D): Avoids being eaten.
- sexually mature at smaller size (E): More likely to survive.
- Camouflage (F): Avoids being eaten.
- Different algal (G): Avoids being eaten.
- Faster swimming (I): More likely to survive.
- Burrow in the sand (J): More likely to survive.

Since all options represent survival traits that the prey would avoid, none of the options correctly describe a survival advantage. However, the question asks for the trait that should least likely be observed. After careful consideration, the correct answer is **E: Algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes**. This is because if the prey is abundant, the fish would stop looking for food, leading them to become sexually mature. Thus, E is a survival trait, and the question's phrasing suggests that none of the options are correct. However, based on the analysis, E is the only option that represents a survival advantage.

ANSWER: E
