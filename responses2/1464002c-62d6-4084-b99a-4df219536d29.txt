Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is: What is the probability of getting exactly three heads in five flips of a balanced coin?

Hmm, I remember that for probability questions involving coins, it's usually a binomial distribution problem. The formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes (which in this case would be heads) in n trials is given by P = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). 

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So for five flips (n=5) and three heads (k=3), I need to calculate C(5, 3). 

What's the combination formula again? Oh right, C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). So for 5 choose 3, that's 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4*3!)/(3!*2*1) = (5*4)/(2*1) = 20/2 = 10. So C(5,3) is 10.

Next, p is the probability of success on a single trial. Since the coin is balanced, p is 0.5 for heads. So p^3 is (0.5)^3, which is 0.125. Similarly, (1-p) is 0.5, and since we're flipping two tails, (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

Now, multiply all these together: 10 * 0.125 * 0.25. Let me compute that step by step. 0.125 * 0.25 is 0.03125. Then 10 * 0.03125 equals 0.3125.

Wait, 0.3125 as a percentage is 31.25%. So looking at the options, I see option G is 31.25 percent. So the probability should be G.

But wait, let me double-check. Oh, sometimes I mix up whether it's heads or tails; but no, the calculation should be correct because heads and tails are equally likely, so the probabilities are consistent.

Alternatively, I can list all possible outcomes. But with five flips, the number of possible outcomes is 2^5 = 32. The number of favorable outcomes is C(5,3) =10. So probability is 10/32, which simplifies to 5/16. Converting that to decimal: 5/16 is 0.3125, which is 31.25%. Yep, that matches what I calculated before.

So the answer should be G: 31.25 percent.

The correct answer is G: 31.25 percent.
