Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of stock. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says, "Find the cost in dollars of $200,000 worth of stock at retail if the markup is 30% of selling price." And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Wait, let's break this down. The stock is worth $200,000 at retail. That probably means the retail price is $200,000, right? So, the cost at cost price would be what we're trying to find.

The markup is 30% of the selling price. I remember that markup can be a bit tricky. Oh wait, markup usually refers to the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So if the markup is 30% of the selling price, that means the cost plus 30% of the selling price equals the selling price.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of cost, selling price, and markup. So the formula is: Selling Price = Cost + Markup. But the markup here is 30% of the selling price. So that would be:

Selling Price = Cost + 0.30 * Selling Price.

Let me rearrange that. Subtract 0.30*SP from both sides: Selling Price - 0.30 Selling Price = Cost. So 0.70 SP = Cost. That means Cost = 0.70 * SP.

Wait, so the cost is 70% of the selling price. So if the selling price is $200,000, then the cost would be 0.7 * 200,000 = 140,000. Wait, but let me check that again because I'm a bit confused about the markup definition.

Alternatively, another approach could be to think that markup is 30% of the selling price, which is the same as saying the markup is 0.3 * SP. So the cost is SP - 0.3 SP = 0.7 SP, which gives the same result as before. So the cost would be 0.7 times the SP.

Wait, but the SP is $200,000. So 0.7 * 200,000 = 140,000. So the cost is $140,000. Looking at the options, option C is $140,000. So that's the answer.

But wait, I'm a little confused because sometimes markup is calculated differently. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up markup on cost and markup on selling price. Oh, right, in this problem, the markup is 30% of the selling price, not of the cost. So that's 30% of SP.

Alternatively, if the markup was 30% of the cost, the formula would be different. Let's see. If markup is 0.3 * Cost, then Selling Price = Cost + 0.3 Cost = 1.3 Cost. So Cost = SP / 1.3. But that's not the case here. Here it's 30% of SP. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So, the cost is 140,000, which is option C. Let me make sure none of the other options fit. For example, if I thought the markup was on the cost, then SP = Cost + 0.3 Cost = 1.3 Cost. So Cost would be 200,000 / 1.3 â‰ˆ 153,846. But that's not one of the options. So the correct approach is the first one.

So the correct answer is C: $140,000.

The cost of the stock is calculated by considering that the markup is 30% of the selling price. Using the formula: Selling Price = Cost + 0.30 * Selling Price, we rearrange to find Cost = 0.70 * Selling Price. Substituting the given SP of $200,000, the cost is 0.70 * 200,000 = $140,000. 

Answer: C
