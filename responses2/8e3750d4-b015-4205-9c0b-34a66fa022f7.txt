Question:

Alice has 8 buckets. Each bucket has t tennis balls in it. There are a total of 56 tennis balls in the buckets. Which number sentence shows how to find, t, the number of tennis balls in each bucket?

Options:

A: 56 - t = 8
B: t ÷ 8 = 56
C: t + 8 = 56
D: 8 × t = 56
E: 8 + t = 56
F: t - 8 = 56
G: 8 ÷ t = 56
H: 56 + t = 8

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Alice and her tennis balls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Hmm, the question says Alice has 8 buckets, and each bucket has 't' tennis balls. The total number of tennis balls in all the buckets is 56. They're asking which number sentence will help find 't', the number of balls in each bucket.

So, first, I need to translate the words into a mathematical equation. Let me break it down. There are 8 buckets, each with 't' balls. So the total is 8 multiplied by t. That makes sense because each bucket contributes 't' balls, and there are 8 of them. So, total = 8 * t.

Now, the total is given as 56. So putting that together, the equation is 8 * t = 56. Looking at the options, that's option D. 

Wait, let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A: 56 - t =8. Hmm, that would mean if I subtract t from 56, I get 8. That doesn't make sense because 56 is the total, and t is the number per bucket. So this can't be right.

Option B: t ÷ 8 =56. That would mean t is 56 divided by 8. But that would make each bucket have more balls than the total, which doesn't make sense. For example, 56 divided by 8 is 7, so t would be 7, meaning each bucket has 7 balls. But 8 buckets of 7 each would be 56 total, which matches. Wait, wait, that's actually correct because 8*7=56. So that's option B. But wait, wait, I thought 8 buckets each with 7 balls would give 56, which is correct. So why am I confused?

Wait, I thought the correct answer is option D. Let me think again. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: t is the number in each bucket. So the total is 8*t. So 8*t=56, which is option D.

But option B says t ÷8 =56. If I rearrange that, t=56*8. That would be t=448, which is way too big. Because 8 buckets each with 448 would be way beyond the total. So that can't be right. So option B is incorrect.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the problem again. The problem says each bucket has t balls, and there are 8 buckets. So 8*t =56. So option D is correct.

What about option E: 8 + t =56. That would mean t=48. Because 8+48=56. But that would mean each bucket has 48, which would make 8*48=384, which is way over 56. So that's not right. So E is wrong.

Option F: t -8=56. That would mean t=64. Because 64-8=56. But then 64*8=512, which is way more than 56. So that's not right.

Option G: 8 ÷ t =56. That would mean t=8/56, which is 1/7. But that can't be, because you can't have a fraction of a ball in a bucket. So G is wrong.

Option H: 56 + t =8. That would mean t= -48, which doesn't make sense because you can't have negative balls. So H is wrong.

So the only correct equation is option D: 8*t =56. The other options are incorrect for various reasons.

The correct equation is D: 8 × t = 56.
