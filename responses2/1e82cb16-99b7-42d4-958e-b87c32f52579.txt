Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an astronaut being put into orbit. Hmm, I remember that orbits are circular, so I need to find the orbital speed. The question gives me the radius of the orbit above Earth's surface. Let me see.

Wait, the problem says the distance is 1.6e5 meters from the Earth's surface. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the Earth's radius is given as 6.37e6 meters. So the total radius of the orbit, R, would be Earth's radius plus the altitude, right? So R = 6.37e6 m + 1.6e5 m. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 6.37e6 is 6,370,000 meters. 1.6e5 is 160,000. Adding them together gives 6,530,000 meters. So R is approximately 6.53e6 meters.

But wait, do I add those? Oh right, because the altitude is above the Earth's surface. So yeah, R = 6.37e6 + 1.6e5 = 6.53e6 meters.

Now, the formula for orbital speed. Oh, right, the formula is v = sqrt(G*M / R), where G is the gravitational constant, M the mass of Earth, and R the orbital radius. I remember that.

So I need the values for G and M. G is 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻², and M is 5.98e24 kg.

Wait, let me plug them in. So v squared is (G*M)/R. Let's compute G*M first.

G * M = 6.674e-11 * 5.98e24. Let me calculate that.

6.674e-11 * 5.98e24. Let's do the exponents first: 10^(-11) * 10^24 is 10^13. So 6.674 *5.98 is approximately... Let me compute 6.674 *5.98.

6 *5 is 30. 6*0.98 is about 5.88. 0.674 *5 is 3.37, 0.674 *0.98 is about 0.66. So adding up: 30 +5.88 =35.88 +3.37=39.25 +0.66=40. So approximately 40. So 40e13 m³/s².

So G*M is about 4e14 m³/s²? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6.674e-11 *5.98e24 = (6.674 *5.98) * 1e(24-11) )= 40 * 1e13 = 4e14. So yeah, 4e14 m³/s².

Then divide by R, which is 6.53e6 meters.

So 4e14 /6.53e6 = (4 /6.53) * 1e8. Let me compute 4/6.53. Hmm, 6.53 is approximately 6.5. 4/6.5 is roughly 0.615. So approximately 0.615e8 m²/s².

So sqrt(0.615e8) m/s. Let's compute that. sqrt(6.15e7) because 0.615e8 is 6.15e7. Wait, wait, no. 0.615e8 is 6.15e7, right?

Wait, no: 0.615e8 is the same as 6.15e7. Because 0.615 *1e8 is 6.15e7. So I need to find the square root of 6.15e7.

Let me compute the square root. The square root of 6.15 is about 2.48, and the square root of 1e7 is 3162.27766... So 2.48 * 3162.27766 is approximately.

Wait, 2.48 * 3e3 is 7.44e3. 2.48 * 162.27766 is about 400. So total is about 7.44e3 + 400 = 7.84e3 m/s. So approximately 7.84e3 m/s.

Looking at the options, the choices are: A:8e3, D:7.91e3, H:8.41e3, etc. So 7.84e3 is closest to option D (7.91e3). But wait, maybe I did some rounding inaccurately. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.

Let me compute G*M more precisely. G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻². M =5.98e24 kg.

So G*M = (6.67430e-11) * (5.98e24) = let's multiply 6.67430 *5.98.

Calculating 6.67430 * 5.98:

5 *6.67430 =33.3715

0.98 *6.67430 = approx 6.5408

33.3715 +6.5408 = 39.9123

So G*M = 39.9123e(24-11) =39.9123e13 = 3.99123e14 m³/s².

Wait, that's better. So G*M is 3.99123e14 m³/s².

Then R is 6.53e6 meters.

So G*M / R = (3.99123e14) / (6.53e6) = (3.99123 /6.53) *1e8.

3.99123 /6.53 is approximately 0.613.

So 0.613e8 =6.13e7 m²/s².

Square root of 6.13e7 m²/s² is sqrt(6.13e7) = sqrt(6.13) *1e3.5.

Wait, wait. 6.13e7 is 6.13 *1e7. The square root is sqrt(6.13) * sqrt(1e7).

sqrt(6.13) is about 2.475. sqrt(1e7) is sqrt(1e7)=1e3.5= 3.16227766e3.

So 2.475 * 3.162e3 = 2.475 *3162 ≈ let's compute this.

2 *3162 =6324, 0.475 *3162 ≈ 1512.45.

6324 +1512.45=7836.45. So about 7.836e3 m/s.

So approximately 7.84e3 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is D:7.91e3 m/s, which is 7910 m/s. Hmm, but wait, why isn't it 7.84e3? Let me check the exact computation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of G*M. Let me compute 6.6743e-11 *5.98e24.

6.6743e-11 *5.98e24 = (6.6743 * 5.98) * 1e( -11 +24 ) = (39.9123) * 1e13 = 3.99123e14 m³/s². That's correct.

R is 6.53e6 m.

So 3.99123e14 /6.53e6 = 3.99123e14 /6.53e6 = (3.99123 /6.53) *1e8.

3.99123 /6.53 → let me compute this division more accurately.

6.53 × 0.613 = ?

Wait, 6.53 * 0.6 = 3.918, 6.53 * 0.01 =0.0653, 6.53 * 0.003=0.01959. So 0.613 is 0.6 +0.01 +0.003.

So 3.918 +0.0653 +0.01959 = 3.993. Hmm, our numerator is 3.99123, which is a little less than 3.993. So 0.613 is a bit more than needed. So maybe 0.6129 or something.

So approximately 0.6129.

So 0.6129e8 is 6.129e7 m²/s².

The square root of 6.129e7 is sqrt(6.129) * sqrt(1e7) ≈ 2.4756 *3.16227766e3.

Let me compute that:

2.4756 *3.16227766e3 ≈ 2.4756 *3162.27766.

Let me compute this step by step.

3162 *2.4756.

Let me compute 3162 *2 =6324.

3162 *0.4 =1264.8.

3162 *0.07 =221.34.

3162 *0.0056 = approx 17.79.

Wait, no, 0.0056 is 5.6e-3, so 3162 *5.6e-3 =17.79 (since 3162 *5e-3 is 15.81, 3162*0.6e-3 is 1.8972 → add those: 17.7072).

So adding up:

6324 (from 2) +1264.8 (0.4) → 7588.8.

Plus 221.34 → 7809.14.

Plus 17.7072 → 7826.8472.

So approximately 7827 m/s. So about 7.827e3 m/s.

Looking at the options, D is 7.91e3, which is about 0.083 higher. H is 8.41e3, which is 8.41 vs 7.827. So the closest is D and H. Let's see which one is closer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of G*M. Let me check.

Wait, G is 6.674e-11, M is 5.98e24.

So 6.674e-11 *5.98e24 = (6.674 *5.98) *1e13. Let me compute 6.674 *5.98.

6.674 *5 is 33.37, 6.674 *0.98 is about 6.5405. So 33.37 +6.5405 = 39.9105. So 39.9105e13 =3.99105e14. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I need to compute the exact value. Let me compute 39.9105e13 /6.53e6.

39.9105e13 is 3.99105e14.

Divide by 6.53e6: 3.99105e14 /6.53e6 = (3.99105/6.53) *1e8.

3.99105 ÷6.53 → let me compute that.

6.53 *0.614 ≈ 3.99. Because 6.53 *0.6 = 3.918, 6.53 *0.014=0.09142 → sum 3.918+0.09142=3.99942 → which is a bit over 3.99105.

So 0.614 is a bit too high. Hmm, perhaps 0.613.

6.53 *0.613 = let's compute 6.53 *0.6 = 3.918, 0.01 *6.53 =0.0653, 0.003 *6.53=0.01959. So 3.918+0.0653=3.9833, plus 0.01959 is 3.9833+0.01959=3.99289. But our numerator is 3.99105, which is a bit less than 3.99289. So 0.613 gives 3.99289, which is higher than 3.99105. So the actual value is a bit less than 0.613. Let's say 0.613 - a small amount.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, the approximate calculation is sufficient.

So approximately 0.613e8 → 6.13e7 m²/s².

Square root of 6.13e7 is sqrt(6.13) * sqrt(1e7).

sqrt(6.13) = about 2.475.

sqrt(1e7) = 3162.27766.

So 2.475 *3162.27766 → let's compute this.

2 *3162.27766 =6324.55532.

0.475 *3162.27766 → let's compute 0.4 *3162.27766=1264.91106, 0.07*3162.27766=221.36, 0.005*3162.27766=15.811.

Wait, 0.475 is 0.4 + 0.07 + 0.005.

So 1264.91106 +221.36 =1486.27106 +15.811=1499.98206.

So adding the 6324.55532 + 1499.98206 = 7824.53738 m/s.

So approximately 7824.54 m/s.

Looking again at the options:

A: 8030 m/s (8e3)
B:6030 m/s
C:9030 m/s
D:7910 m/s (7.91e3)
H: 8410 m/s (8.41e3)

So 7.82e3 is 7820 m/s, which is closest to D (7.91e3) but D is higher.

Wait, is there a way to get closer? Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is off by a factor I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the square root correctly. Let me compute 7824.53738 m/s and see which option is closest. The options are:

D is 7.91e3, which is 7910. So 7824 is about 7824, which is 7824 m/s. So 7.82e3 is 7820, so the difference between 7820 and 7910 is 90. So 7820 is 90 less than 7910.

Wait, but what about option A (8e3), which is 8000. 7824 is 7824, which is 76 less than 8000.

So 7824 is closer to D (7910) than to A (8000). Because 7824 is 7824, so 7824-7824 is 0, 7824-7910 is 86. So 7824 is closer to D.

Alternatively, is there a way to get more precise? Let me compute sqrt(6.13e7) precisely.

Wait, 6.13e7 is 61,300,000. The square root of 61,300,000 is the same as sqrt(613 *1e5) → sqrt(613) * 1e2.5. Wait, 1e5 is 10^5, so 1e2.5 is 10^(5/2)=316.227766.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the exact square root.

Wait, let me compute 6.13e7 as 61300000.

The square root of 61300000 is approximately 7829 m/s.

Let me compute 7829^2:

7829 *7829 = (7820 +9)^2 =7820² + 2*7820*9 +9².

7820^2 = (7800 +20)^2 =7800² + 2*7800*20 +20².

7800² =60,840,000.

2*7800*20 = 312,000.

20²=400.

So 7800² =60,840,000 +312,000 =61,152,000 +400= 61,152,400.

Then 2*7820*9= 2*7820=15640 *9= 140,760.

And 9²=81.

So adding all together:61,152,400 +140,760 =61,293,160 +81=61,293,241.

Wait, but 7829^2 is 61,293,241.

Wait, but our target is 61,300,000. The difference is 61,300,000 -61,293,241 =6,759.

So add 1 to 7829: 7830.

7830^2 = (7829+1)^2 =7829² +2*7829 +1.

We know 7829² is 61,293,241.

2*7829 =15658.

So 61,293,241 +15658=61,308,899.

Wait, but that's larger than 61,300,000. So 7829²=61,293,241.

The target is 61,300,000.

So the square is between 7829² and7830². So the actual square root is between 7829 and7830.

The difference between 61,300,000 and61,293,241 is 6,759.

The difference between 7830² and7829² is 7830² -7829²= (7829+1)^2 -7829²=2*7829 +1=15659.

So the fraction is 6759/15659.

So the square root is 7829 + (6759/15659) ≈7829 +0.432≈7829.432.

So approximately 7829.43 m/s.

Which is about 7.829e3. So the closest option is D:7.91e3, but that's 7910, which is 0.081 higher than 7829.43.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me try to compute the square root more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator, but since I don't have that option, perhaps I'll proceed.

So the orbital speed is approximately 7829 m/s, which is 7.829e3 m/s. The options are:

A:8.0e3

B:6.0e3

C:9.0e3

D:7.91e3

H:8.41e3

So 7.829e3 is 7829 m/s.

So which option is closest? Option D is7.91e3=7910, which is 0.081 higher than7829.

Option A is8e3=8000 m/s, which is 70.1 m/s lower than7829.

So 7910 is closer to7829 than8000 is.

So the correct answer would be D:7.91e3 m/s.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. Did I miscalculate the square root? Let me check: 7829.43 squared.

7829 *7829=61,293,241.

0.43^2=0.1849.

2*7829 *0.43=2*7829=15658 *0.43=6667.34.

So 61,293,241 +6667.34=61,299,908.34 +0.1849=61,299,908.5249.

Wait, that's approximately 61,299,908.525 m²/s².

Hmm, but our target is 61,300,000.

So 7829.43^2=61,299,908.525.

Which is 61,300,000 -61,299,908.525 =91.475 m²/s².

So approximately 91.475 more than needed.

So how much more to add?

Each additional 0.01 in the speed adds approximately 2*0.01*7829.43 =0.02*7829.43=156.5886 m²/s².

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, to find the correct speed, perhaps this calculation shows that 7829.43 is just a little over the needed speed.

But for the purposes of the multiple-choice question, the closest option is D:7.91e3 m/s.

Wait, but let me think again. The question gives the options with 7.91e3 and 8.41e3. So if our calculation is 7.829e3, which is 7829 m/s, which is 7.829e3.

So 7.829e3 is 7829.

So which option is closer? Option D is7.91e3=7910, which is 0.081 higher.

Option A is8e3=8000, which is 70.1 m/s lower.

So 7910 is closer than 8000 is.

So the correct answer is D:7.91e3.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, because I'm getting 7.829e3, which is 7829 m/s, which is 7.829e3, but the options are:

A:8e3 → 8000 m/s

B:6e3 →6000

C:9e3 →9000

D:7.91e3 →7910

H:8.41e3 →8410.

So 7829 is closer to 7910 than to 8000.

So the correct answer should be D:7.91e3.

Wait, but wait a moment more. Maybe I should calculate the orbital speed using the formula v = sqrt(G*M/(r)), but in this case, the radius is the Earth's radius plus the altitude. So perhaps I should include Earth's radius in the calculation.

Wait, let me correct this. The formula for the orbital speed is v = sqrt( (G*M) / (r - R) ), where r is the distance from the center of the Earth, and R is the radius of the Earth.

In our problem, the distance from the Earth's center is 6.5e6 +1.6e5 =6.66e6 meters.

Wait, but no, wait. Wait, the Earth's radius is about 6.37e6 meters. So if the distance from the center is 6.5e6 meters (from the problem), then the actual altitude is 6.5e6 -6.37e6 ≈1.3e6 meters.

But perhaps I made a mistake in not considering the Earth's radius. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the orbital speed at that altitude, which would be v = sqrt( (G*M) / (R + h) ), where R is the Earth's radius and h is the altitude.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the Earth's radius in the calculation instead of the distance from the center.

Wait, let me re-calculate v as sqrt( (G*M) / (r - R) ), where r is the total distance from the center.

Wait, I think perhaps I should redo the calculation with the correct formula.

Wait, the formula for the orbital speed is v = sqrt( (G*M) / (r - R) ), where r is the distance from the center of the Earth, and R is the radius of the Earth.

In the problem, the distance from the center is 6.5e6 meters (since the problem says the altitude is 1.6e5 meters). So r =6.5e6 meters.

Wait, but that would mean that the altitude is 6.5e6 -6.37e6 =1.3e6 meters. So the altitude is 1.3e6 meters.

Wait, but let me recalculate the orbital speed using this formula.

Wait, let me compute v = sqrt( (G*M) / (r - R) ), where r=6.5e6 m, R=6.37e6 m.

So r - R =6.5e6 -6.37e6 =1.3e6 meters.

So v = sqrt( (6.67e-11 *5.98e24) / (1.3e6) )

Compute the numerator:6.67e-11 *5.98e24 = (6.67*5.98) *1e13 =39.91e13 =3.991e14.

Divide by 1.3e6: 3.991e14 /1.3e6 = (3.991 /1.3) *1e8.

3.991 /1.3 = approx 3.07.

So 3.07 *1e8 =3.07e8 m/s.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 3.07e8 is 307,000 m/s, which is 307,000 m/s. But that's way too high for an orbital speed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute:

(6.67e-11) * (5.98e24) =6.67 *5.98 * 1e-11 +24.

Wait, 6.67 *5.98 is about 6.67 *6 =40.02, minus 0.02*6.67=0.1334, so approx 40.02 -0.1334=39.8866.

So 39.8866e(24-11)=39.8866e13.

So 39.8866e13 / (1.3e6) = (39.8866 /1.3) ) *1e7.

39.8866 /1.3 is about 30.6828.

So 30.6828e7 =3.06828e8 m/s.

Which is 306,828 m/s, which is way too high for an orbital speed.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v = sqrt( (G*M) / (r) ), where r is the distance from the center. But that doesn't make sense because the orbital speed should depend on the radius.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v = sqrt( (G*M)/(r) ), but that would imply that at the Earth's surface, the orbital speed is zero, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

The formula for the orbital speed is derived from the balance between gravitational force and centripetal force. So gravitational force is G*M*m/(r²), where m is the mass of the object. Centripetal force is m*v²/r, where v is the orbital speed.

So setting them equal:

G*M*m/(r²) = m*v²/r → G*M/(r²) = v²/r → G*M/(r) = v² → v = sqrt( G*M / r ).

Wait, so the formula is correct. So v = sqrt( (G*M) / r ), where r is the distance from the center of the Earth.

In our problem, the distance from the center is 6.5e6 meters. So r =6.5e6 m.

So v = sqrt( (6.67e-11 *5.98e24) /6.5e6 )

Compute numerator:6.67e-11 *5.98e24 =3.991e14.

Divide by 6.5e6: 3.991e14 /6.5e6 = (3.991/6.5) ) *1e8.

3.991/6.5 = approx 0.614.

0.614 *1e8 =6.14e7 m/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 6.14e7 m/s is way too high for orbital speed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me do the division again.

3.991e14 /6.5e6 = (3.991 /6.5) * (1e14 /1e6) )= (0.614) * (1e8)=6.14e7 m/s.

Wait, but this is 61,400,000 m/s, which is way too high.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v = sqrt( G*M / r ), but that would imply that the orbital speed is higher as r decreases, which is not correct.

Wait, no, because as r decreases (closer to the Earth's center), the gravitational force is stronger, so the orbital speed should be higher, not lower. Wait, that can't be. Because if you're closer to the Earth, you would have a higher orbital speed. Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is correct, and I'm making a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me compute G*M again.

G =6.67e-11

M=5.98e24

So G*M=6.67e-11 *5.98e24 = (6.67 *5.98) *1e( -11 +24 )=39.8866 *1e13=3.98866e14.

Now, dividing by r=6.5e6:

3.98866e14 /6.5e6 = (3.98866 /6.5) ) *1e8.

3.98866 /6.5 = approx 0.614.

So 0.614 *1e8=6.14e7 m/s.

Wait, that's 61,400,000 m/s, which is way higher than the typical orbital speed of about 7,800 m/s. So perhaps the problem is that I have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken r as the radius of the Earth, not the distance from the center. Let me try that.

So, if r is the Earth's radius, which is about 6.37e6 meters.

So r =6.37e6 m.

Then, v = sqrt( (G*M)/r ) = sqrt(3.98866e14 /6.37e6 ) = sqrt(6.28e7 )= approx 7.93e3 m/s.

Which is 7,930 m/s, which matches option D:7.91e3.

Wait, okay, so perhaps the problem was that I used the distance from the Earth's center instead of the Earth's radius, which resulted in a higher orbital speed than expected. Thus, the correct answer is option D.

To determine the orbital speed of a satellite in a circular orbit, we use the formula:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
\]

where:
- \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \),
- \( M = 5.98 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( r \) is the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite.

### Step 1: Calculate \( G \cdot M \)
\[
G \cdot M = (6.67 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.98 \times 10^{24}) = 3.991 \times 10^{14} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}.
\]

### Step 2: Choose \( r \)
The problem specifies the altitude of the satellite as \( 1.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \). To find the distance from the center of the Earth, we add this altitude to the Earth's radius (\( 6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)):
\[
r = 6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} + 1.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} = 6.53 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( v \)
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot M}{r}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.991 \times 10^{14}}{6.53 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.991}{6.53}} \cdot 10^4.
\]

\[
\frac{3.991}{6.53} \approx 0.613, \quad \sqrt{0.613} \approx 0.783.
\]

\[
v \approx 0.783 \cdot 10^4 = 7.83 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The closest option to \( 7.83 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s} \) is **D: 7.91 × 10³ m/s**.
