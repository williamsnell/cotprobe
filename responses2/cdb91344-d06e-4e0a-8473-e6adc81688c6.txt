Question:

Explain what is meant by an animal's ecological niche, and definecompetitive exclusion.

Options:

A: Niche refers to the specific diet of an organism, while competitive exclusion is the dominance of one species over another in acquiring food.
B: Niche is the physical area where an organism lives
C: An ecological niche is the temperature range an organism prefers, and competitive exclusion means that species with the same temperature preferences cannot live in the same area.
D: Niche is defined by the habitat of an organism
E: Competitive exclusion means two species with similar niches can coexist in the same habitat
F: Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem. Competitive exclusion states that unless the niches of two species differ, they cannot coexist in the same habitat.
G: Competitive exclusion refers to the idea that no two species can share the same predators, while a niche is determined by the predators of an organism.
H: Niche is the set of behaviors an organism exhibits, and competitive exclusion implies that two species will eventually merge into one if they have similar behaviors.
I: Niche is the social role of an organism in a group, and competitive exclusion dictates that two species with the same social roles cannot exist together in a social group.
J: Ecological niche is the time of day an animal is most active. Competitive exclusion suggests that two species cannot be active at the same time.

Okay, so I've got this question about ecological niches and competitive exclusion. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

First, what's an ecological niche? From what I remember, it's the range of environmental conditions that an organism can tolerate and thrive in. So it's not just about what it eats; it's about its physical characteristics, habitat, and other life skills. Oh right, it's like the spot in the ecosystem where the organism can live. Like, if a bird lives in a certain type of tree, its niche would be that tree's range of conditions. So the options that talk about the environment or habitat seem relevant here.

Looking at the options, option A says "Niche refers to the specific diet." Wait, no, that's not right. Because niche also includes more than just dietâ€”it's about how it uses resources and interacts with the environment.

Option B says "Niche is the physical area where an organism lives." That seems too specific, maybe. Because I think it's more about where it lives within the ecosystem rather than just the physical space. So B might be incorrect.

Option C says it's the temperature range, and competitive exclusion is species can't live in the same area. Hmm, temperature range is part of the niche, but competitive exclusion refers to when two species with the same ecological niches outcompete each other and can't coexist. So C doesn't seem to define competitive exclusion correctly. It's just describing the niche.

Option D says "Niche is defined by the habitat." That's correct, but it doesn't mention anything about competitive exclusion. So D alone can't answer the question.

Option E says competitive exclusion means two species with similar niches can't coexist. That sounds precisely like what I remember. So E could be a contender.

Option F says "Niche is the functional role and position in the ecosystem." Wait, maybe that's another way of saying the same thing as option D. So F is similar to D, but not defining competitive exclusion.

Option G talks about predators, which is about competition in terms of predators, not in terms of the niche itself. So G is about another aspect, not the question.

Option H says "Niche is the behaviors an organism exhibits." Hmm, I thought the niche is about the environment the organism can live in, not its behaviors. So H is incorrect.

Option I says it's about social roles, which is similar to H, so I is incorrect.

Option J says ecological niche is the time of day an animal is active. That's too specific and not a general definition. So J is wrong.

Option F, I think, is a correct definition of competitive exclusion. Competitive exclusion refers to the situation where two species with the same ecological niche cannot coexist because they outcompete each other and can't survive in the same environment. So F's second part is correct about competitive exclusion.

Looking back, the question is asking me to explain both ecological niche and competitive exclusion.

So, the correct definitions are:

Niche: The set of environmental conditions, behaviors, and physical traits that an organism can tolerate and utilize, determining its habitat within an ecosystem. It's about the organism's ability to survive and reproduce in a particular range of conditions.

Competitive Exclusion: The principle that two species with identical ecological niches cannot coexist in the same environment or habitat. They will outcompete each other, leading to one species' decline or exclusion from the ecosystem.

Looking at the options, which ones define these?

Option F: "Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem. Competitive exclusion states that unless the niches of two species differ, they cannot coexist in the same habitat."

Wait, F says "Niche is the functional role and position within its ecosystem." That's correct because it's about the organism's role. Then, competitive exclusion is about species differing in their niches. So F correctly defines both.

Looking again, the options:

F: Correct.

E: Correct, but only defines competitive exclusion. It's the definition of competitive exclusion. The question is about both definitions.

Wait, the question is about defining what ecological niche is and what competitive exclusion is.

So, looking for the options that explain both.

Option F defines competitive exclusion correctly. But what about the first part of F? Does it correctly explain the ecological niche?

F's first part says "Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem." That's correct. So F correctly explains both.

Wait, but the question is about explaining each term. So the definition of competitive exclusion is in F, and the definition of ecological niche is in F's first part.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the definitions, not about which option correctly defines both.

So the correct answers would be:

Competitive Exclusion: two species with the same ecological niche cannot coexist.

Ecological Niche: the range of environmental conditions an organism can tolerate and thrive in.

Looking at the options:

Option F's first part correctly defines the ecological niche. But the second part is about competitive exclusion.

So option F is correct in both parts.

Wait, the question is asking which option defines both.

Wait, the question says: "Explain what is meant by an animal's ecological niche, and define competitive exclusion."

So, the correct definitions are:

Ecological Niche: The set of environmental conditions, behaviors, and traits that an organism can tolerate and utilize, determining its habitat in an ecosystem.

Competitive Exclusion: Two species with identical ecological niches cannot coexist in the same environment, leading to one's decline or exclusion.

Looking at the options, which one correctly explains both points.

Option F says, "Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem." That's correct for ecological niche. Then, the second part is competitive exclusion.

Wait, looking back: The question is which option explains both ecological niche and competitive exclusion.

I think the correct answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check each option.

Looking at option F: It defines competitive exclusion as the point where species with same niches can't coexist. And defines the first part as the ecological niche.

So yes, F correctly defines both terms in the question.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the definitions.

So, in the options, which one correctly states both.

Option F says: "Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem. Competitive exclusion means two species with the same niches cannot coexist in the same habitat."

Yes, that's correct. So F is the correct answer.

To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate each option based on its definition of ecological niche and competitive exclusion.

1. **Ecological Niche**: This refers to the specific environmental conditions, behaviors, and physical traits that an organism can tolerate and utilize, thereby determining its habitat within an ecosystem.

2. **Competitive Exclusion**: This principle states that two species with identical ecological niches cannot coexist in the same environment, as they would outcompete each other.

Now, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While it mentions diet, it does not define ecological niche or competitive exclusion.
  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It describes the physical area an organism lives in, which is more specific than ecological niche.
  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It defines the temperature range as part of the niche but does not explain competitive exclusion.
  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While it defines ecological niche, it does not explain competitive exclusion.
  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It states that competitive exclusion means two species with similar niches can coexist, which is the opposite of the definition.
  
- **Option F**: Correct. It accurately defines both terms:
  - "Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem." This is correct.
  - "Competitive Exclusion means that two species with the same niches cannot coexist in the same habitat." This is also correct.
  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. It focuses on predator competition, not ecological niche.
  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It defines behaviors as part of the niche, which is not accurate.
  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It defines social roles, not ecological niche or competitive exclusion.
  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. It describes the time of day an animal is active, which is too specific and not a general definition.

The only option that correctly defines both ecological niche and competitive exclusion is **Option F**.

**ANSWER: F**
