Question:

A behavioral response called a fixed action pattern shown by animals

Options:

A: is a learned behavior that can be unlearned
B: occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life
C: only occurs during the animal's sleep cycle
D: is a response that only occurs in the presence of other animals
E: is a response that is influenced by the animal's diet
F: is a response that develops as the animal ages
G: is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment
H: is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously
I: occurs in the absence of sensory feedback
J: is a reflex action triggered by external stimuli

Okay, so I've got this question about behavioral responses, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again.

The question is asking about a fixed action pattern shown by animals. The options are A to J, each describing different behavioral responses.

I remember that a fixed action pattern is a learned behavior where an animal responds to a specific stimulus in a predictable way, often without much effort. It's a type of learned behavior that's usually reinforced.

Looking at the options:

A: A learned behavior that can be unlearned. Hmm, that sounds like something like classical conditioning, where a behavior can be strengthened or even learned again. But a fixed action pattern is learned, so maybe it's not A.

B: Occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life. That sounds more like extinction. Once a learned behavior is extinguished, it doesn't occur unless there's a new reinforcement. So B might be about extinction, not a fixed pattern.

C: Only occurs during the animal's sleep cycle. I don't think so. Sleep is more about rest and recovery, not directly about a learned fixed response.

D: Involves other animals. That's probably about social learning, like when animals observe others and copy their behaviors. Fixed responses aren't social; that's more individual.

E: Influenced by diet. Diet affects behavior, but not sure how it relates to fixed action patterns. Maybe it's more about a reflex or a learned behavior, but not the specific fixed pattern.

F: Triggered as the animal ages. Fixed actions might change with age, but I'm not certain. I think older animals might have slower reflexes, but the pattern itself could be similar.

G: Triggered by multiple sensory signals. That makes sense because fixed responses rely on a lot of sensory information to occur, like touch, sound, light, etc. So G could be right.

H: A motor response that's spontaneous once released. That sounds like a reflex, which is a learned motor response that occurs without conscious thought. But fixed actions are learned, so maybe H isn't correct.

I: Occurs without sensory feedback. That doesn't fit, because if there's no feedback, how does the response happen? Maybe it's a reflex, but I'm not sure.

J: A reflex triggered by external stimuli. Reflexes are a type of fixed response, so this fits. Reflexes are learned motor responses that occur without prior conditioning because they are automatic.

So the options that fit are F and J. Let's think again. Fixed action patterns are learned, so they happen after some conditioning and are often reinforced. The options are about what they are.

F says it occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus. That's about extinction, not fixed patterns.

J says it's a reflex action triggered by external stimuli. That's definitely a fixed action pattern because reflexes are learned and automatic.

So the correct answer should be F or J. Wait, but the question is about a fixed action pattern, which is a learned behavior. So J is a reflex, which is a type of fixed response.

Looking back at the options, F is triggered by diet, which isn't directly about the fixed pattern. J is about being a reflex.

So the answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. A behavioral response that is a reflex action triggered by external stimuli is described as a fixed action pattern because reflexes are learned motor responses that occur automatically without prior conditioning. 

Answer: J
