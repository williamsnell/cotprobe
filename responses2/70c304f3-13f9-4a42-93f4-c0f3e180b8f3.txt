Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about presidential elections since 1972. Let me go through each option step by step.

The question asks which statement is most accurate regarding voter behavior in presidential elections. The options are A to G, each making a different claim about how voters choose candidates.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about election trends over time. I remember that as elections have become more frequent and the media has expanded, people have more ways to gather information. That might have changed their voting patterns. Also, the candidates have changed over time, and sometimes there's political polarization or changes in party platforms.

Looking at option A: Voters increasingly vote based on a party's platform. I think in recent years, especially since 1972, candidates have more complex platforms. People might not just stick to their party's position but consider other factors. So this could be true, but I'm not sure if it's the most accurate statement.

Option B: Voters increasingly vote based on a candidate's gender. I don't recall any significant trend in recent elections that would favor one gender over another. In fact, candidates have often been more diverse in their party platforms, so this probably isn't accurate.

Option C: Voters have become less interested in politics. That doesn't sound right. I think people still care a lot about politics, especially for their elections. The changes aren't about disinterest but more about how they gather and evaluate information.

Option D: Voters increasingly vote based on a candidate's personal life. Personal interests can play a role, but it's not a dominant trend. Personal factors vary widely, so this might not be a standard assumption.

Option E: Elections have become less competitive. I think the political landscape has become more competitive. Candidates often face more challenges, and there's more emphasis on specific issues, leading to more detailed voter choices.

Option F: Voters increasingly get their information from newspapers. With the rise of the internet and social media, newspapers have become less of the primary source. However, newer platforms might still contribute, so this might be true but maybe not the most accurate statement.

Option G: Voters increasingly focus on individual candidates. This seems accurate because each election is about a single candidate, and people are often more focused on that candidate's performance. That's a common trend in modern elections, especially in the U.S.

So, considering all this, option G seems the most accurate. Voters are increasingly focused on individual candidates, especially as the elections become more personal and less about the broader party platforms.

The most accurate statement is G: Voters increasingly focus on individual candidates.

Answer: G
