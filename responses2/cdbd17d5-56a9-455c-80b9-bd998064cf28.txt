Okay, so I've got this question here about Mill's approach to determining whether one pleasure is more valuable than another. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Mill was a philosopher, specifically interested in ethics and moral philosophy. He wrote about the value of different pleasures. I think he had a particular approach to this.

The question is asking what Mill would do to compare two pleasures. The options are A to J, each describing a different method or belief.

Let me go through each option. 

Option A says to determine which pleasure is preferred by most people. I think Mill's main idea was about comparing two pleasures, not just which is preferred by everyone. He wanted a more objective way to decide, rather than relying on subjective preferences.

Option B is consulting science. That doesn't seem right. Mill was more about philosophy and ethics rather than relying on scientific methods.

Option C is consulting religious leaders. I don't recall Mill doing much with religion, so probably not this one.

Option D: determine which is objectively most pleasurable. Hmm, that sounds more like a concept Mill might have used. Like, he might have talked about what's inherently pleasurable without human experience.

Option E: measure the intensity. That's more of a scientific approach, measuring how strong or intense something is. But Mill's method was more about subjective value, not necessarily measuring intensity.

Option F: consider which is easiest to attain. I think Mill focused on subjective experiences, not practical attainability.

Option G: determine which is most universally preferred. That's another approach, but I'm not sure if that's Mill's method. He might have been more about comparing two pleasures rather than a universal preference.

Option H: determine which lasts the longest. That's about duration, which is subjective again. Mill was more concerned with the inherent pleasure rather than duration.

Option I: measure the duration. Again, that's about the physical experience, not the subjective value.

Option J: consult past philosophers. Mill was critical of empiricism, so he might have referenced older thinkers, but the question is about the method he used, not the source of the information.

So, putting it together, Mill's approach was about comparing two pleasures rather than choosing based on what people find most pleasurable. He might have focused on the subjective experience and its inherent value, rather than just which is preferred. So option D says determining which is objectively most pleasurable. That aligns with what I remember Mill being interested in. He would compare two pleasures to see which is more enjoyable, perhaps through a method that doesn't involve extensive human testing.

The correct answer is D: determine which is objectively most pleasurable.
