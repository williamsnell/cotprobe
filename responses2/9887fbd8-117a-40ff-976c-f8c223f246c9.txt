Question:

Which of the following is NOT true of the χ2 probability distribution function?

Options:

C: χ2 is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable.
D: For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom decreases, the critical value for the rejection region increases.
E: For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the chi-square probability distribution function. Hmm, I need to find which statement is NOT true. Let me think about each option step by step.

The question is asking which option is incorrect. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness. Oh wait, I remember that the chi-square distribution is skewed. For example, when the degrees of freedom (df) are small, like 2 or 3, the distribution is highly skewed to the right. So I think A is true. So A is not the correct answer because the question is about the false statement.

Option B: The area under the chi-square curve is 1. Right, the total area under any probability distribution curve is 1. So B is definitely true. So B can't be the answer.

Option C: Chi-square is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable. Yes, because chi-square is the sum of squared standard normal variables, which are all non-negative. So C is true. So C can't be the wrong one.

Option D: For the same alpha, as the number of degrees of freedom decreases, the critical value for the rejection region increases. Wait, critical value increases or decreases? Let's think. The critical value is the point beyond which we reject the null hypothesis. For a given alpha, as df decreases, the critical value (which is the value that would give us alpha significance) increases. Because with fewer degrees of freedom, the distribution is more spread out. For example, the critical chi-square value for a 0.05 alpha level decreases as df increases but increases as df decreases. So D is true. So D is correct, so not the answer.

Option E: For the same alpha, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases. Right, because more degrees of freedom make the distribution flatter and more spread out. So the critical value, which is beyond the lower tail, is smaller. So E is correct. So E is true.

Wait, but wait. The question is which option is NOT true. So looking back, the options are A, B, C, D, E. So the only one that's incorrect is A, because it's true for small df. So the answer should be option A.

The question asks which statement about the chi-square distribution is NOT true. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness.  
  This is true because the chi-square distribution is skewed for small df.  
- **Option B**: The area under the chi-square curve is 1.  
  This is correct, as the total area under any probability distribution is 1.  
- **Option C**: Chi-square is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable.  
  This is correct because chi-square is the sum of squared standard normal variables, which are non-negative.  
- **Option D**: For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom decreases, the critical value for the rejection region increases.  
  This is true. As df decreases, the critical value increases because the distribution becomes more spread out.  
- **Option E**: For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases.  
  This is also true. With more df, the distribution is flatter, so the critical value (required to achieve α) is smaller.

The statement that is NOT true is **Option A**.

**Answer**: A
