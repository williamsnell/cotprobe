Okay, so I have this question about fiscal policy and its impact on the economy, specifically when there's a recessionary gap. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, what's a recessionary gap? I remember it's when the economy is producing below its potential GDP. So, there's a negative gap because actual GDP is lower than the natural or full-employment GDP. To fix this, the government wants to increase GDP, so they need to close the gap.

Fiscal policy refers to government spending and taxation. The two main tools are expansionary and contractionary. An expansionary policy aims to stimulate the economy, while a contractionary one is meant to reduce unemployment and reduce inflation.

So, the question is asking which fiscal policy would eliminate the gap (i.e., close the gap) and what the predicted effects are on real GDP and unemployment.

The options are A to I, each with a different combination of spending and taxes, and the impact on real GDP and unemployment.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Increase spending. Decrease Real GDP, Increase Unemployment. So, if the government increases spending, it adds to the economy. But if the economy is already struggling, this might lead to too much demand. In the short run, it might cause inflation (if the economy can't absorb it), which could lead to higher prices but perhaps not necessarily higher unemployment. Wait, but I'm not sure how this affects the gap. I think if the economy is undersupplied, increasing spending would shift the curve, but without knowing the multiplier, it's hard to say. Maybe this leads to a higher GDP but perhaps less of an increase in unemployment. Not entirely sure about the impact.

Option B: Increase taxes. Decrease Real GDP, Increase Unemployment. So, if taxes go up, that reduces disposable income for people. That could mean lower consumption and less demand, so real GDP would go down. But since it's a contractionary policy (assuming the government is using it to reduce GDP), this would increase unemployment because people are less able to find jobs or may lose their jobs if demand is down. So, this could close the recessionary gap.

Option C: No change in taxes. No change in spending. So, no change in real GDP and unemployment. That can't be right because the economy isn't closing a gap. So this is probably incorrect.

Option D: Decrease taxes. Increase Real GDP, Decrease Unemployment. Wait, if taxes decrease, people have more disposable income, leading to higher consumption and increased spending. This would stimulate the economy, leading to higher real GDP and lower unemployment because more people are employed. But this is a contractionary policy, so maybe the gap isn't closed. It's more of a positive policy to fix the problem, but perhaps not enough to close the recessionary gap. So, maybe this isn't the right answer because it's more expansionary, which would make the economy recover, not just close a recession.

Option E: Decrease taxes. Increase Real GDP, Increase Unemployment. Wait, this can't be right because if taxes are decreased, more money is available for spending, which would increase real GDP. But this also increases unemployment because people might not be able to find jobs as much. So, this seems like a contractionary policy, which would reduce GDP and increase unemployment, but this option suggests an expansionary effect, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is incorrect.

Option F: Decrease spending. Decrease Real GDP, Increase Unemployment. So if the government decreases spending, it reduces demand. That would lower real GDP, but again, considering the size of the multiplier, it's a contractionary measure. Unemployment would rise because people are likely to lose jobs when demand drops. So this might help close the gap.

Option G: Increase taxes. Increase Real GDP, Increase Unemployment. That's the opposite of option B. If taxes are increased, less disposable income, lower spending. So this would lead to lower real GDP and higher unemployment. This could be a contractionary policy, but it's a contractionary measure, so it's bad for the economy. So this would not be effective in closing the recessionary gap.

Option H: Increase taxes. Increase Real GDP, Decrease Unemployment. Wait, that seems conflicting. If taxes go up, more money is available for spending, which should increase real GDP. But then, perhaps people are more employed because the economy is growing. So, this could be a contractionary policy (if the government is using it to reduce the recession) but the effect would be positive. But I'm not sure. Maybe this is a bit of a stretch.

Option I: Decrease spending. Increase Real GDP, Decrease Unemployment. So, less spending means less demand, lower GDP. But this is contractionary, so it would reduce real GDP and unemployment. Again, similar to option F, but this option suggests that reducing spending would lead to lower GDP, higher unemployment. But I'm not sure if this is the correct fiscal policy for a recession.

Wait, the question is about a recessionary gap. So, the correct policy should stimulate the economy, which is expansionary. So options B, E, G, and H seem less likely because E and G suggest contractionary effects, which are not what's needed here. So the options to consider are B, F, and perhaps others.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is asking for an appropriate fiscal policy to eliminate the gap. So, the policy should stimulate the economy, which is expansionary. So options B, F, and H. But wait, option H says Increase taxes and Decrease spending. That's a contractionary policy. So if the economy is in a recession, the government should use expansionary methods. So I should eliminate the gap by making the economy grow, not just decrease GDP.

So looking again at the options, the correct fiscal policy would be either B, F, or G (but G is probably incorrect as discussed). Let's check each.

Option B: Increase taxes, which leads to lower real GDP and higher unemployment. So that's a contractionary policy, which would make the economy worse. But this is a way to close a recessionary gap by reducing the demand. Wait, no, if the economy is undersupplied, increasing taxes reduces demand (since people have less money to spend). So in the short run, that would lead to lower GDP and perhaps higher unemployment. But in the long run, maybe the economy can recover, but the question is about the short-term impact.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, but what about option H? Option H says to increase taxes and decrease spending. That's a contractionary policy (since both taxes and spending are reduced), so that would slow GDP and increase unemployment. So that's not the way to close the gap, it's the opposite.

Option F is Decrease taxes and increase real GDP. So that's a contractionary approach, which would reduce GDP and increase unemployment. Not helpful for closing the gap.

So the correct option for expansionary policy is option B: increase taxes, leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem is that the economy is in a recession, so they need to stimulate it. So expansionary policy is needed. So the government would increase spending or decrease taxes.

Wait, in the options, option B is increasing taxes, which is contractionary, so that would reduce real GDP and increase unemployment. But that would close the gap. Alternatively, option H is increasing taxes and decreasing spending, which is contractionary as well.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Expansionary policies are those that increase GDP, like increasing spending (like option A, but I'm not sure about that), or decreasing taxes (option B). Contractionary policies are decreasing spending or increasing taxes (like option H or option F).

So, the correct policy to stimulate the economy (closing the recession gap) would be one that increases real GDP and reduces unemployment. So looking at the options:

Option B: Increase taxes → Lower real GDP and higher unemployment.

Option A: Increase spending → Maybe leads to higher real GDP, but perhaps not the most effective in the short run.

Option G: Increase taxes → Higher GDP, but lower unemployment? That doesn't seem right. Maybe if taxes are increased, people have more money left to spend, leading to higher real GDP because the economy is more active. But I'm not sure about the effect on unemployment. Maybe it's a positive effect, but it's a contractionary policy.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the impact of each option on real GDP and unemployment.

In a recessionary gap, the economy is below its potential GDP. So, to close the gap, the government needs to increase GDP.

Option B: Increase taxes. This would reduce disposable income, so people have less to spend. That would lower real GDP and increase unemployment. So the gap is closed because we're trying to stimulate the economy.

Option H: Increase taxes and decrease spending. Both of these are contractionary. So, this would reduce real GDP even more (as in, decrease even more) and increase unemployment. So this would not help close the recession gap.

Option G: Increase taxes and increase spending. That would increase real GDP because spending increases, but also higher taxes. The effect on real GDP would depend on the multiplier effect, but the impact on unemployment would be a bit unclear. Let me think: higher taxes might reduce demand, but higher spending might increase demand. It's unclear if the net effect is positive or negative.

Option B seems the best bet for a contractionary policy that reduces the demand gap.

Wait, but the question is about an appropriate fiscal policy. So, if the economy is in a recession, the government should use expansionary tools. But none of the options present an expansionary policy. So perhaps the correct approach is to think about which option leads to closing the gap.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again.

The correct answer is option B: Increase taxes, leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment.

But wait, some sources say that increasing taxes can reduce demand, which would lower real GDP and increase unemployment. So, that's a contractionary approach, which would close the gap but reduce the economy's growth. But the question doesn't specify whether the gap needs to be closed in the short run or long run. However, since it's a recession, the goal is to stimulate.

Alternatively, the correct answer may be option H: increase taxes and decrease spending. Wait, no, that's a contractionary policy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think of the options again.

Wait, the question is asking which policy would eliminate the gap. So, it's a contractionary policy. So, the correct policy is to decrease taxes or increase spending. Let's see the options.

Option B: increase taxes → leads to lower real GDP and higher unemployment. That's a contractionary policy, which would close the recessionary gap.

Option G: increase taxes and increase spending. I'm not sure about the net effect.

Option H: increase taxes and decrease spending. Both are contractionary, so worse.

Option F: decrease taxes and increase real GDP. That's a contractionary policy, which is bad.

So, the correct options for a contractionary policy are B, F, and H.

But the question is about which one would eliminate the gap. So perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, but another thought: when the government increases taxes, it's a contractionary policy. So, if the economy is in a recessionary gap, this would reduce demand, leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment, thus closing the gap.

So, the policy is to increase taxes (option B), leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment. So the impact is lower real GDP and higher unemployment.

But wait, in some contexts, increasing taxes can also lead to increased government spending, but that's not an option here.

Looking at the options again: the correct answer is option B.

The question involves identifying the appropriate fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap and its impact on real GDP and unemployment. A recessionary gap occurs when the economy produces below its potential GDP, requiring expansionary measures to stimulate activity. The goal is to close this gap by increasing real GDP and reducing unemployment.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: Increase spending**  
   Expanding spending can stimulate the economy but may lead to inflation or over-production, which complicates addressing the recessionary gap without addressing the root cause.

2. **Option B: Increase taxes**  
   Increasing taxes reduces disposable income, leading to lower consumer spending, a contractionary policy. This reduces real GDP and increases unemployment, effectively closing the recessionary gap.

3. **Option C: No change in taxes or spending**  
   This option leaves the economy undisturbed, as there's no change in GDP or unemployment, failing to close the gap.

4. **Option D: Decrease taxes**  
   Lower taxes increase disposable income, boosting spending and potentially stimulating the economy. However, this is an expansionary policy, which may not help close the recessionary gap.

5. **Option E: Decrease taxes and increase real GDP**  
   This is a contractionary policy, as lower taxes reduce demand, leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment. It does not address the recessionary gap.

6. **Option F: Decrease taxes and increase real GDP**  
   Similar to Option E, this is a contractionary policy that reduces demand, leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment, not effective in closing the gap.

7. **Option G: Increase taxes and increase spending**  
   Both policies are contractionary. While increasing taxes reduces demand, increasing spending may increase demand. The net effect is unclear, but this approach does not effectively close the recessionary gap.

8. **Option H: Increase taxes and decrease spending**  
   Both policies are contractionary, leading to lower demand and higher unemployment, which does not address the recessionary gap.

9. **Option I: Decrease spending and decrease real GDP**  
   This is a contractionary policy, as lower spending reduces demand, leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment, not helpful in closing the gap.

### Conclusion:
The correct policy to address a recessionary gap is **Option B: Increase taxes**. This contractionary policy reduces demand, leading to lower real GDP and higher unemployment, effectively closing the gap.
