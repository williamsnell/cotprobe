Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which group was converted to Christianity in the tenth century CE by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. The options are a bunch of different ethnic groups, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Byzantine Empire was a major power in Eastern Europe during the 10th and 11th centuries. They were involved in missionary work, which is when they spread Christianity to different regions. So the question is asking which group was converted during this period.

Looking at the options: A is Goths, B is Huns, C is Normans, D is Franks, E is Russians, F is Anglo-Saxons, G is Vandals, H is Moors, I is Celts, J is Visigoths.

I think the key here is to find the group that was either already a Christian group or could convert to Christianity through missionaries. I remember that the Moors were a big Christian group, especially around the Iberian Peninsula. The Byzantine Empire was known for their missionary work, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula.

Wait, the Moors were already quite Christian. So if the Byzantine missionaries came in, maybe they converted them? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timeline. I think the Moors were already in Christian communities, so perhaps they were the ones who were converted. Or maybe it's the other way around, that the Byzantines were the ones converting the Moors. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about which group was converted, meaning that the original group was non-Christina and the missionary spread Christianity there.

Wait, let me think again. The question says which group was converted. So the group that converted to Christianity. So the group that was converted would be the one whose members were brought by the Byzantines to Christianity.

I think the Moors were among the first groups that were converted. Because the Byzantines were involved in spreading Christianity there. Alternatively, the question might be about which group the missionaries from the Byzantines were converting. So the answer would be the group they converted, which would be the Moors, because the Byzantine Empire was known for their missionary work.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the Goths, but I'm not sure. Wait, the Goths were in the Iberian Peninsula, but I don't think they were the ones converted. The Moors were more likely the ones converted.

Wait, also, the Visigoths were a different group. They were from the Iberian Peninsula but were also converted? I'm not sure. Maybe the Moors were the ones who were converted.

Wait, the options are: H is Moors. So I think that's the right choice.

The correct answer is H: Moors. The Byzantine Empire's missionary work in the Iberian Peninsula, including the Moors, likely led to their conversion to Christianity. 

Answer: H
