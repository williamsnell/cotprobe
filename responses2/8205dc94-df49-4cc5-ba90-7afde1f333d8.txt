The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?

Options:

A: The bag will expand and eventually burst due to the pressure of water flow.
B: The solute will flow into the dialysis bag from the beaker.
C: The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.
D: The bag will shrink in size and the beaker will overflow due to the movement of water.
E: The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.
F: The water will evaporate from the bag, leaving only the solute.
G: There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.
H: There will be a net flow of water out of the beaker, causing it to decrease in size.
I: The water in the bag will freeze due to the change in environment.
J: There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about osmosis. Let me think about what I remember. Osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane. The process depends on the difference in solute concentration on either side. 

The question says the student used a dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution. Then he put it into a beaker with a 0.6 M solution. Now, if he puts it into distilled water, which is 0 M, what happens?

I remember that in osmosis, water moves from an area of lower solute concentration to higher. So, when the dialysis bag is in a higher concentration solution, water moves in. The bag is a semipermeable bag, so only the solvent (water) can pass through, not the solute particles.

So, if the bag is placed in a beaker with 0.6 M, which is higher than 0.5 M, water moves into the bag. That makes the bag expand. But if the bag is placed in distilled water (0 M), that's lower than 0.5 M. So water would move from the bag into the distilled water, causing the bag to shrink. 

Looking at the options, which ones fit this scenario. 

Option B says the solute will flow into the bag. No, because the solute couldn't pass through the semipermeable membrane. So B is incorrect.

Option G says the bag will expand because of net water in. No, because if it's in a higher concentration, water moves in, bag expands. If in lower, it shrinks. 

Option H is about water flowing out of the bag, making it decrease. That matches the scenario. So when placed in 0 M, the bag will lose water, so its size decreases. 

Looking at the options, H is "There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size." So that's the correct one.

Other options: A is about the bag expanding and bursting. That's if it's in a higher concentration. But here, the concentration is lower, so the bag won't burst. So A isn't right.

Option E says water evaporates, leaving solute. No, because the bag is on a beaker, so evaporation would be from the bag itself, but the solute is in the bag. Probably, the bag would lose water, but I think the main point is the movement of water, not evaporation.

So the correct answer should be H.

When a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed into a beaker with 0.6 M solution, water moves into the bag due to osmosis, causing the bag to expand. However, if the bag is instead placed into distilled water (0 M), water moves out of the bag into the distilled water, causing the bag to shrink. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as the bag will shrink, not burst, when placed in a lower concentration.
- **B**: Incorrect, as solute particles cannot pass through the semipermeable membrane.
- **C**: Incorrect, as the bag will shrink, not remain the same, when placed in a lower concentration.
- **D**: Incorrect, as the bag will shrink, not expand, when placed in a lower concentration.
- **E**: Incorrect, as evaporation is not the primary factor here; water movement is the main focus.
- **F**: Incorrect, as water will flow out of the bag, not evaporate.
- **G**: Incorrect, as the bag will shrink, not expand.
- **H**: Correct, as water flows out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.
- **I**: Incorrect, as water does not freeze in this scenario.
- **J**: Incorrect, as there is no net flow of water out of the bag; instead, water flows out.

The correct answer is **H**: There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.

Answer: H
