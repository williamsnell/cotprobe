Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about individual freedom to schedule work. Let me think about what each option means and how they relate to the question. 

The question is asking what individual freedom to schedule work is an example of. The options include job design, job planning, job specification, job satisfaction, job rate, job security, job enrichment, job analysis, job evaluation, job rotation, and so on. I need to figure out which of these is a direct example.

First, I should understand what each term means. Individual freedom to schedule work probably refers to the ability to choose when and where work is done. For example, you can decide to work on weekends or during holidays, or even on different days, or even at home.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Job design - This is about how the job is structured, like the tasks and responsibilities. It's more about the structure, not freedom to choose when to work.

B: Job planning - This involves planning the job, the tasks, and the schedule. It's about the process, but not the freedom itself.

C: Job specification - This is about the specific job requirements, like the tasks, responsibilities, and pay. Again, more about the job's structure than the freedom to choose.

D: Job satisfaction - This relates to how satisfied you feel about the job. It's more about the personal satisfaction, not the freedom to schedule.

E: Job rate - This refers to the pay based on hours worked. It's about compensation, not the ability to choose when to work.

F: Job security - This is about the stability of the job, like benefits and company longevity. Not directly about scheduling.

G: Job enrichment - This involves opportunities for personal growth, like learning new skills or experiences. It's about enhancing the job itself, not the ability to choose when to work.

H: Job analysis - This is about examining the job to understand it better. It's more about understanding the job rather than the freedom.

I: Job evaluation - This is about assessing the job's performance and determining if it's fair. Not the freedom itself.

J: Job rotation - This is about changing the job duties periodically, which allows for different tasks and schedules. This sounds like it's directly related to individual freedom to schedule.

So, the best example seems to be job rotation, which allows for changing work schedules. That makes sense because it gives the individual the ability to choose when and where to work, which is freedom.

The correct answer is J: Job rotation. Job rotation allows individuals to change their work schedules, providing individual freedom to choose when and where to work.

Answer: J
