Okay, so I've got this question about economic growth, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that real GDP per capita was $10,000 in 1990 and $15,000 in 2000. I need to find the amount of economic growth between these two years. The options are given, so I need to calculate it and see which one matches.

First, I remember that real GDP per capita is calculated by dividing real GDP by the population. But wait, the question doesn't give me the population figures for those years. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the population, I can't directly calculate the growth rate. Oh wait, maybe the question is assuming that the population remained constant between 1990 and 2000. That would make sense because otherwise, the growth rate would require population data.

So, let's proceed under that assumption. If the population is the same each year, then the percentage change in real GDP per capita would directly give me the growth rate.

In 1990, real GDP per capita is $10,000. In 2000, it's $15,000. The change is $15k - $10k = $5k. To find the growth rate, I divide the change by the original value.

So, $5k / $10k = 0.5. To express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives 50%. 

Looking at the options, option I is 50 percent. So that should be the right answer.

Wait, did I consider all possibilities? Oh, another thought: sometimes, people calculate growth rates using the formula (current - past)/ past. So (15000-10000)/10000 = 0.5, which is 50%. So yes, that aligns with my calculation.

I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that without population data, we assume population is constant, which is a standard approach in such problems.

To calculate the economic growth between 1990 and 2000, we compare real GDP per capita growth. Assuming population remains constant, the growth rate is:

Growth rate = ((2000 GDP per capita - 1990 GDP per capita) / 1990 GDP per capita) × 100  
= ((15,000 - 10,000) / 10,000) × 100  
= 50%.

Thus, the correct answer is **50 percent**.

**Answer: I: 50 percent.**
