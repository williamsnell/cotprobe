Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says, "An object carries a charge of –1 C. How many excess electrons does it contain?" Hmm, right, I remember that charge involves electrons because they're the fundamental units of charge. 

So, I think the charge of an electron is a negative value, right? Let me recall. Oh yes, each electron has a charge of -1.602 × 10^-19 coulombs. Wait, but the object here has a charge of -1 C. So, that's a big number. 

Wait, so the object is negative, meaning it has more electrons than protons, because electrons are negative and protons are positive. So the charge is calculated as the number of excess electrons multiplied by the charge per electron. 

So, the formula would be: charge (Q) equals n * e, where n is the number of excess electrons and e is the charge of an electron. But wait, the charge here is negative, so Q is -1 C. But the number of electrons is positive because they're in excess. 

Let me write that out: Q = n * e. So rearranging, n = Q / e. 

Wait, but wait, the charge is negative, so n will be positive. Let's plug in the numbers. So, Q is -1 C. e is -1.602e-19 C per electron. But since I'm looking for the number of electrons, the negatives will cancel out. So n = (1 C) / (1.602e-19 C/electron). 

Wait, but wait, the object is negative, so the number of electrons would be positive. So n is 1 / 1.602e-19. Let me compute that. 

1 divided by 1.602e-19 equals approximately 6.24e18. Oh wait, so that's about 6.24 times 10^18 electrons. 

Looking at the options, option D is 6.25 × 10^18. That's one of the choices. 

Wait, but I remember that sometimes, when you calculate, you might get more precise numbers due to significant figures or rounding. Let me double-check the calculation. 

So 1 divided by 1.602e-19. Let's compute it step by step. 1 ÷ 1.602e-19 = (1 / 1.602) × 1e19. 1/1.602 is approximately 0.6242. So 0.6242e19 is the same as 6.242e18. Oh, so around 6.24e18. 

Looking at the options, D is 6.25e18, which is close. Wait, but wait, the charge is -1 C. So if the object is -1 C, that's one more electron. So the calculation seems right. 

Wait, but wait: e is the charge per electron, which is -1.602e-19 C. So, for Q = n * e, we have Q = -1e0 C. So, n = Q / e = (-1) / (-1.602e-19) = 1/(1.602e-19) which is 6.24e18. So the number of excess electrons is approximately 6.24e18. 

Looking at the options, D is 6.25e18. So perhaps they rounded it to 6.25. But wait, another thing I remember is that sometimes when you calculate, especially with exact values, you might get a slightly different number. Let me think about the exact value: e is approximately 1.602176634e-19 C. So 1/(1.602176634e-19) is approximately 6.2415e18. 

So 6.2415e18 is about 6.2415 × 10^18. The options are D as 6.25e18, so that's the closest. But wait, the options are given with significant figures. Let's see the options:

Option D is 6.25e18. So that's correct to three significant figures. The calculation I did gives about 6.2415e18, which rounds to 6.24e18, but if they approximate to 6.25, that's three sig figs. So that's probably correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. The charge is negative, does that mean the number of excess electrons is positive? Yes. So our calculation is correct. 

Wait, but the problem says the object carries a charge of –1 C. So the excess electrons are positive because they're in excess. So the number is positive, which matches option D. 

So the correct answer should be D: 6.25 × 10^18.

To determine how many excess electrons an object with a charge of –1 C contains, we use the relationship between charge and the elementary charge. The charge of an electron is –1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C. Since the object has a negative charge, it means it has excess electrons, as electrons are the negative charge carriers.

The formula to calculate the number of excess electrons is:

\[
n = \frac{Q}{e}
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the total charge of the object,
- \( e \) is the charge of a single electron.

Substituting the given values:
\[
n = \frac{-1 \, \text{C}}{-1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/electron}} = \frac{1}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{electrons}
\]

Performing the calculation:
\[
n \approx 6.24 \times 10^{18} \, \text{electrons}
\]

Since the charge is –1 C, the number of excess electrons is positive, and the closest option to this value is **6.25 × 10¹⁸**, which corresponds to option D.
