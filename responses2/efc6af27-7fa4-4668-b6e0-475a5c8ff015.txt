Question:

Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem. Let's read through it carefully.

The problem says that X is uniformly distributed over the set {1, 2, ..., m}, and m is given as 2^n. So m is a power of two. The process involves asking a series of random questions: whether X is in subsets S1, S2, etc. Each time, only one integer remains. All 2^m subsets are equally likely for each question. We're asking n + sqrt(n) random questions. We need to use Markov's inequality to find the probability of error, meaning one or more wrong objects (i.e., the remaining X's) when n is very large.

Hmm. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with uniform distributions and subsets, each element has a certain probability of being in each subset. Since all subsets are equally likely, each element has a 50% chance of being in any given subset. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Actually, each subset is equally likely, but each element is included in a subset with a certain probability. Let's rephrase that.

For each question, we're checking if X is in a randomly chosen subset. Since all subsets are equally likely, the probability that X is in any given subset is 1/2. Because each element is in exactly half of the subsets (since for each element, it's present in 2^{m-1} subsets out of 2^m, which is 1/2).

But wait, that's if each subset is equally likely. So each question is effectively a Bernoulli trial where the outcome is whether X is in the subset. Each trial is independent because each subset is chosen uniformly at random and the next subset is chosen independently.

So after each question, we're effectively eliminating the possibility of X being in that subset. So if we ask n + sqrt(n) questions, each of which is a Bernoulli trial with p=1/2, we want to find the probability that X is not eliminated by all of them. Or wait, no, the problem says the probability of error is one or more wrong objects remaining. So that's the probability that X is not eliminated after all the questions.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the probability that one or more wrong objects remain. Since X is a single element, the probability that X is not eliminated after all the questions. Or wait, perhaps the error occurs if more than one object remains. But since m is a power of two, and each question halves the possible remaining candidates, but I think I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the probability that X is not in any of the subsets S1, S2, etc., after n + sqrt(n) questions.

Wait, but each question is a random subset, so each question is like a Bernoulli trial with 50% chance. But since we're dealing with n + sqrt(n) questions, each of which is a 50% chance, perhaps the probability that X is not eliminated is (1/2)^{n+sqrt(n)} }, but that seems too small because the options don't have values that low except maybe option D (0.0). But let me think again.

Wait, but perhaps the problem isn't as straightforward because each subset is chosen uniformly at random, but each element's inclusion in each subset is independent. So for each element, the probability that it's not in any of the n + sqrt(n) subsets is (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)}.

But when n is large, like going to infinity, this probability becomes extremely small. So the probability of X not being eliminated is tiny, so the error probability (i.e., X not being eliminated) is (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)}, which goes to zero as n approaches infinity. So the probability of error would be approximately zero.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of error, which is the probability that one or more wrong objects remain. So if X is eliminated, it's correct. If not, then it's a wrong object. Since m is finite and we're only considering the case where X is not eliminated, the probability of error would be the probability that X is not eliminated.

Alternatively, the probability that after n + sqrt(n) questions, X is not in any of the subsets. Since each subset is a Bernoulli trial with 50% chance, the probability that X is in none is (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)}.

So as n approaches infinity, this probability approaches zero. So the probability of error is zero.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of error when n goes to infinity. So as n increases, the probability that X is not eliminated approaches zero, so the error probability approaches zero. So the answer would be 0.0, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the process. Each time, a random subset is chosen, and the question is whether X is in that subset. If X is in the subset, we proceed, else we eliminate it. But since the process is until only one integer remains, perhaps the process stops when only one integer is left, which would imply that in each step, the subset S_i is chosen such that X is in S_i, otherwise, we're left with X.

Wait, no, the question says that all subsets are equally likely, and each question is whether X is in S_i. So each S_i is a subset, and each time, the question is whether X is in S_i, and if yes, we "keep" X, else X is eliminated. So the process continues until only X remains.

Wait, but in this case, X is eliminated only when the subset S_i does not contain X. So the error occurs when X is eliminated. So the probability that X is not eliminated is the probability that all the subsets chosen contain X, which is (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)}.

As n grows, this probability becomes negligible, approaching zero. So the error probability is approaching zero.

So the limit as n approaches infinity of the probability of error is zero. Thus, the answer is option D: 0.0.
</think>

To determine the probability of error when n approaches infinity, we analyze the process of eliminating X through a series of random subset queries. Each query has a 50% chance of X being included, as all subsets are equally likely. The probability that X is not eliminated after n + sqrt(n) queries is (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)}. As n grows large, this probability approaches zero. Therefore, the probability of error (X being eliminated) approaches zero.

Answer: D: 0.0
