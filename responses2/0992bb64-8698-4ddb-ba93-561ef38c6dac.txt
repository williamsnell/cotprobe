Okay, so I've got this question about Euler's Totient Function, phi(n), and I'm supposed to find phi(29791). Hmm, I remember Euler's totient function counts the number of integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. Oh right, and for a prime number p, phi(p) is p-1 because all numbers less than a prime are coprime to it.

Wait, but 29791—I wonder if that's a prime number. Let me try to check. I'll think of some methods. Maybe trial division? Or maybe look for small factors.

Let me try dividing by small primes. 29791 is odd, so not divisible by 2. Sum of digits: 2+9+7+9+1 = 28, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a factor. Ends with 1, so 5 isn't either. Let's try 7: 29791 divided by 7. 7*4250 is 29750. 29791 minus 29750 is 41. 41 divided by 7 is 5 with a remainder of 6. So no, not divisible by 7.

How about 11? The rule for 11 is alternating sum: (2+7+1) - (9+9) = (10) - (18) = -8. Since that's not a multiple of 11, 11 isn't a factor. Next, 13. Let me see, 13 times 2292 is 29796, which is a bit over. So 13*2291= 29783 (since 13*2290=29770, plus 13 is 29783). 29791 minus 29783 is 8. So not divisible by 13.

Next, 17. Let me try 17*1750 is 29750, right? 17*1750 = 29750. Then 29750 + 17*3=51 → 29750+51=29801, which is bigger than 29791. So 29791-29750=41. 41/17 is about 2.41. So 17*1752=29784, and 29791-29784=7. Not divisible by 17.

19? Let's see, 19*1567 is 29773 (19*1500=28500, 19*67=1273. 28500+1273=29773). 29791-29773=18. 18 isn't divisible by 19, so no.

23? 23*1295 is 29785 (23*1300=29900 minus 23*5=115 → 29900-115=29785). 29791-29785=6. Not divisible.

29? Let's try. 29*1027 is 29783 (because 29*1000=29000, 29*27=783; 29000+783=29783). 29791-29783=8. Not divisible.

31? 31*961 is 29791? Wait, 31*900=27900, 31*60=1860 → 27900+1860=29760. 29760 + 31*1= 29791? 29760 +31=29791. Oh! Wait, 31*961 = 31*(900+60+1)=31*900 +31*60 +31*1=27900 + 1860 +31=27900+1860=29760+31=29791. Oh wait, so 31*961=29791. So that means 29791 is 31 multiplied by 961. But wait, is 961 a prime? Or can it be broken down further.

Wait, 961 is 31 squared, right? Because 31*31=961. So 29791 is 31 *31 *31, but wait, 31*31 is 961, so 31 *961 is 29791, but I thought 961 is 31^2, so 29791 =31^3? Let me check: 31^3=31*31*31=31*961=29791. Oh yeah, so 29791 is 31 cubed.

So phi(n) for n=p^k is p^k - p^(k-1). So for p=31, k=3. So phi(31^3)=31^3 - 31^2.

Calculating that: 31^3 is 31 * 31 *31= 31 * 961. 31*961=29791. 31^2 is 961. So phi(29791)=29791 -961=29791-961= 28830. Oh wait, because 29791 is 31^3, so phi(31^3)=31^3 -31^2= (31^2)(31-1)=961 *30= 28830.

Looking back at the options, option J is 28830. So the correct answer should be J.
</think>

The number 29791 factors into 31^3 (since 31 × 31 × 31 = 29791). Euler's totient function for a prime power p^k is given by φ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1). Applying this:

φ(31^3) = 31^3 - 31^2 = 29791 - 961 = 28830.

The correct answer is **J: 28830**.
