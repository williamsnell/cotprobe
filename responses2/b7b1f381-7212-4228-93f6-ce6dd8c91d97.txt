Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a treaty between Spain and Portugal, specifically the Treaty of Tordesillas, which took place in 1494. The question is asking about the reason why the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon wanted Spain to control territory west of the demarcation line.

Hmm, I remember that the treaty was a big deal because it ended the Age of Exploration in Europe. Spain and Portugal were splitting the world, and this division was crucial for their expansion. So, the main point was to prevent Portugal from expanding too far west, which would have made it harder for them to conquer other parts of Asia, including India.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The Spanish wanted to convert Barbary states to Catholicism. Oh wait, Barbary states were part of Africa, but I think Spain wanted to convert them to Christianity, which would prevent them from claiming them as their own. That must have been a reason. But I'm not sure how that directly ties to the demarcation line.

Option B: The Spanish believed Portugal didn't know about the New World. That's more about Portugal's unawareness, but I think the treaty was more about the expansion tactics and the need to protect themselves from Portugal. So maybe this isn't the main reason.

Option C: The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World. Oh, right! The idea was that if Spain controlled much of the West Coast, they could prevent Portugal from expanding into the Indian Ocean. The New World was a buffer zone. So this makes sense. They didn't want to lose the independence of the indigenous populations there.

Option D: The Spanish thought India was harder to conquer than the New World. I don't think that was the main reason. The New World was more threatening because it was a larger area and had more resources. The theory was more about strategic buffer zones.

So, the correct answer should be C. The treaty was to protect the independence of the indigenous peoples of the New World, preventing Portugal from conquering it. Therefore, the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon wanted Spain to keep the indigenous territories safe.

The correct answer is C: The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.
