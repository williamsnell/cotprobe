Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. It says an automobile accelerates from 15 mi/hr to 45 mi/hr in 10 seconds while moving in a straight line. I need to find the average acceleration and choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, average acceleration, right.

Wait, I remember that average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the change in time. Oh right, the formula is a_avg = (v_final - v_initial) / t. So I need to calculate the difference in speed and divide by time. But wait, the initial speed is given in miles per hour, and the time is in seconds. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me convert the speeds from miles per hour to feet per second because the answer options are in ft/sec². I think 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So to convert mi/hr to ft/s, I multiply by (5280 ft)/(3600 s). Let me compute that factor: 5280 divided by 3600. Let's see, 5280 ÷ 3600 is 1.466666... approximately, which is 1.4667 when rounded to four decimal places.

So initial speed is 15 mi/hr. Multiply by 1.4667: 15 * 1.4667. Let me calculate that. 15 * 1 is 15, 15 * 0.4667 is approximately 6.9995, so adding them gives about 21.9995 mi/hr. Rounded to a reasonable figure, that's roughly 22 mi/hr. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no: 15 * 1.4667 equals... let's do it precisely.

Actually, 1.4667 is 1 + 4/6 + 2/60 or something? Wait, no, 0.4667 is 7/15 approximately. So 15 * (7/15) is 7. So 15 * 7/15 is 7. So the initial speed in ft/s is 15 * (5280/3600) = 15 * (4/3) = 20 mi/hr. Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait 5280/3600 is 1.466666... So 15 *1.466666 is 22 mi/hr (since 15 *1 is 15, 15*0.466666 is 7, total 22 mi/hr). Wait, no 15 * 1=15, 15 *0.4=6, 15 * 0.066666=1. So 15*0.466666 is 6 + 1=7. So 15 *1.466666=22 mi/hr.

Wait, no, wait. 15 * (5280/3600) = 15 * (4/3) = 20 mi/hr. Oh wait, because 5280/3600 = 4/3. So 15 * (4/3) = 20 mi/hr. Oh, I see, that's easier. So initial speed is 20 mi/hr. Similarly, final speed is 45 mi/hr. So the change in speed is 45-20 =25 mi/hr. 

Wait, but wait: 45-20 is 25 mi/hr. So the change is 25 mi/hr over 10 seconds. So to find the average acceleration, I divide 25 mi/hr by 10 seconds. That gives 2.5 mi/hr per second. Wait, but the answer options are in ft/sec², so I need to convert this.

So 2.5 mi/hr/s. Let's convert mi/hr/s to ft/sec². Since 1 mi/hr is (5280 ft) / (3600 s) = 1.466666... ft/s. So 2.5 mi/hr/s equals 2.5 * (5280/3600) ft/s².

Let me compute that. 2.5 * (5280/3600). So 5280/3600 is 1.466666... So 2.5 * 1.466666 equals approximately 3.666665 ft/s². Hmm, but wait, let me do it more accurately. Let me see:

2.5 * 5280 = ?

2 * 5280 =10560.

0.5 *5280=2640.

So 10560 +2640=13200.

13200 divided by 3600 is 3.666666... So 2.5 mi/hr/s is 3.6667 ft/s². But wait, the answer options have 2.2, 3.3, etc. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait another approach: Let's compute the average acceleration in mi/hr/s first. The change in speed is 25 mi/hr over 10 seconds, so 2.5 mi/hr/s. Now, to convert to ft/s², multiply by 5280/3600. 2.5 * 5280/3600.

Let me compute 5280/3600: 5280 ÷ 3600. Let's compute that. 3600 goes into 5280 once, with 1680 left. 1680 ÷ 3600 is 0.466666... So 5280/3600 = 1.466666... So 2.5 * 1.466666 is 3.666665 ft/s², which is approximately 3.6667 ft/s².

But looking at the options, none of them is exactly that. Wait, the options are:

A: 0

B:5.5

C:4.4

D:6.6

E:8.8

F:7.7

G:9.9

H:1.1

I:3.3

J:2.2

Hmm, my calculation gives about 3.6667, which is approximately 3.67, but the closest option is 3.3 (option I) or 3.6667 is not there. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average acceleration in ft/s² from the initial and final speeds in ft/s, without converting the velocities first.

Alternative approach: Take the speeds in ft/s, then compute the change per second.

So, initial speed: 15 mi/hr. 15 * (5280 ft)/(3600 s) = (15 *5280)/3600.

15 *5280 = 79200. Divided by 3600: 79200 ÷ 3600 = 22 mi/hr. Wait, same as before.

Wait, but 22 mi/hr is 22 * (5280 ft)/(3600 s). Let's compute that.

22 * 5280 = 116,160 ft.

Divide by 3600 s: 116160 /3600 = 32.266666... ft/s.

Wait, wait, 116160 ÷ 3600: 3600 * 32 = 115200, so 116160 - 115200 =960. 960/3600 = 0.266666... So total is 32.266666 ft/s.

Similarly, final speed: 45 mi/hr. 45 *5280 ft = 237,600 ft. Divided by 3600 s: 237600/3600 = 66 ft/s.

So the change in velocity is 66 - 32.266666 = 33.733333 ft/s over 10 seconds. So average acceleration is 33.733333 ft/s² divided by 10 seconds. Wait, no, average acceleration is change in velocity over time. So 33.733333 ft/s / 10 s = 3.373333 ft/s².

Wait, so about 3.373 ft/s², which is approximately 3.37 ft/s². Looking at the options: option I is 3.3, option G is 9.9. So 3.3 is the closest. So the answer would be option I, 3.3 ft/s².

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it without converting the initial speed. Let me try that.

Alternatively, compute the acceleration in mi/hr/s first, then convert. Let me see.

Change in velocity is 25 mi/hr over 10 sec. So 2.5 mi/hr per second. Now, to convert this to ft/s²:

1 mi/hr/s = (5280 ft) / (3600 s²) = 5280/(3600) ft/s² = 1.466666... ft/s². So 2.5 mi/hr/s is 2.5 * 1.466666 = 3.666665 ft/s². Hmm, so approximately 3.6667 ft/s², which is about 3.67. But looking at the options again, none match this exactly except maybe option I which is 3.3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the acceleration in ft/s² using the initial and final speeds in ft/s.

Wait, initial speed is 15 mi/hr = 15 * (5280 ft)/(3600 s) = (15 *5280)/3600 = (15 * 1.466666...) = 22 mi/hr. Wait, 15*1.466666 is 22, so 22 mi/hr. Then, 22 mi/hr is equal to 22 * (5280 ft)/3600 s.

Wait, 22 * (5280 /3600) = 22 * (4.666666..) = 102.666666 ft/s. Wait, 5280/3600 is 1.466666, so 22 *1.466666= 32.26666 ft/s.

Final speed is 45 mi/hr.

45 * (5280/3600) = 45 * 1.466666 ≈ 66 ft/s.

So the change in velocity is 66 - 32.26666 =33.73333 ft/s over 10 seconds.

So average acceleration is 33.73333 ft/s divided by 10 s = 3.37333 ft/s².

Wait, that's approximately 3.373 ft/s². So the closest option is I:3.3. But wait, 3.37 is about 3.4, but let's see how the options are presented. Option I is 3.3, which is 3.3. So why is the correct answer 3.3? Or is there a mistake in my calculation?

Wait another approach: Let me compute the acceleration using the formula a = (v_f - v_i) / t. So v_i is 15 mi/hr, v_f is 45 mi/hr, t=10s.

So, a = (45-15) mi/hr / 10 s = 30 mi/hr /10 s = 3 mi/hr/s.

Now, convert 3 mi/hr/s to ft/s².

Since 1 mi/hr/s = (5280 ft) / (3600 s) = 5280/3600 ft/s² = 1.466666 ft/s².

So 3 mi/hr/s * 1.466666 = 4.4 ft/s². Wait, that's option C.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I found earlier. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that's confusing. Because using two different methods, I get two different answers. Let me double-check.

In the first method, I converted the speeds to ft/s and then used (change in ft/s)/time.

Initial speed: 15 mi/hr is 15 * 5280/3600 ft/s.

Wait, 15 *5280 =79200. Divided by 3600 is 22 mi/hr. 22 *5280/3600 = let me compute 22 * 1.466666 = 32.2666 ft/s.

45 mi/hr is 45 *5280/3600 =45 *1.466666 =66 ft/s.

So change is 33.7333 ft/s over 10 seconds, which is 3.3733 ft/s². That would mean the average acceleration is approximately 3.37 ft/s², which is closer to 3.38, but the options don't have that. So why is the first method giving a different result?

Wait, what's the correct way to convert? Because in the first method, I converted the initial speed to ft/s, then found the change in velocity in ft/s over 10 seconds. So yes, that should be correct.

So, 33.7333 ft/s over 10 s is 3.3733 ft/s², so approximately 3.37 ft/s², which is around 3.4, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial step.

Wait another approach: Perhaps the initial speed is 15 mi/hr. Let's compute that in ft/s.

15 mi/hr =15 * 5280 ft/mile * 1 hr/3600 s = (15 *5280)/3600 = (79200)/3600 = 22 ft/s. Because 5280/3600 =1.466666..., 15 *1.466666 is 22 ft/s.

Wait, but 15 mi/hr is 22 ft/s. So initial speed is 22 ft/s. Final speed is 45 mi/hr, which is 45 *5280 /3600. Let me compute that: 45 *5280 = 237600; 237600 /3600=66 ft/s.

So change in velocity is 66-22=44 ft/s over 10 seconds. So average acceleration is 44 ft/s divided by 10 s =4.4 ft/s². Oh wait! So that would be option C.

Wait, so why did I get conflicting results earlier? Because I think I made a mistake in one of the calculations earlier.

Wait, let's recap:

Method 1:

Change in speed: 45-15=30 mi/hr.

Convert 30 mi/hr to ft/s: 30 *5280 /3600 =30 *1.466666=44 ft/s.

Change in velocity:44 ft/s.

Time:10 s.

a=44/10=4.4 ft/s². So option C.

Method 2:

Initial speed:15 mi/hr=22 ft/s.

Change in speed:22 to 66, so 44 ft/s.

Average acceleration:44/10=4.4.

So this matches. So why earlier in the first method did I get 3.37 ft/s²? Because I incorrectly converted 45 mi/hr to ft/s.

Wait, 45 mi/hr is 45 *5280/3600 ft/s.

45 *5280 =237600.

237600/3600=66 ft/s.

15 mi/hr is 22 ft/s.

So change is 66-22=44 ft/s over 10 s.

So 44/10=4.4 ft/s². So the average acceleration is 4.4 ft/s², which is option C.

But wait, earlier in another approach, I had 3.37 ft/s². So perhaps I made a mistake in that method.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the velocity in ft/s, then computed the change over time.

Wait, the initial velocity in ft/s is 15 * (5280/3600)=22 ft/s.

The final velocity is 45 * (5280/3600)=66 ft/s.

Change in velocity:66-22=44 ft/s.

Time taken:10s.

So average acceleration:44/10=4.4 ft/s². Option C.

So why earlier I thought it was 3.3? Because I made a mistake in the calculation.

So the correct answer is option C:4.4 ft/s².
</think>

To calculate the average acceleration, use the formula:

\[
a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{v_{\text{final}} - v_{\text{initial}}}{\Delta t}
\]

Given:
- Initial speed: \(15 \, \text{mi/hr}\)
- Final speed: \(45 \, \text{mi/hr}\)
- Time: \(10 \, \text{sec}\)

First, convert the speeds to feet per second (\( \text{ft/s} \)):

\[
v_{\text{initial}} = 15 \, \text{mi/hr} = 15 \times \frac{5280}{3600} = 15 \times 1.4667 \approx 22 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

\[
v_{\text{final}} = 45 \, \text{mi/hr} = 45 \times \frac{5280}{3600} = 45 \times 1.4667 \approx 66 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Change in velocity:

\[
\Delta v = v_{\text{final}} - v_{\text{initial}} = 66 - 22 = 44 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Average acceleration:

\[
a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{44}{10} = 4.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **C: 4.4 ft/s²**.
