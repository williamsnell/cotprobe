Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about measuring the length of a rod. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects move at high speeds relative to an observer, their length appears contracted. But wait, the question is about how fast the observer must move to reduce the rod's length to 0.80 m from 1.00 m. Let me think.

So, the setup is that the rod is at rest in its own frame, right? And the observer is moving parallel to the rod. I think that when an object is moving, its length in the direction of motion is contracted by a factor of gamma (γ), which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh wait, but wait—gamma is only for length contraction in the direction of motion. So if the rod is moving, the length in the direction of motion (like the rod's length) would be shorter.

Wait, but wait a second—no, wait, no, the problem says the rod's rest length is 1.00 m, and the observer measures it as 0.80 m. So length contraction is happening here. So the length observed (L) is the proper length (L0) multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma, but wait, no, that's not right. Because when an object is moving, its length in the direction of motion is shorter. So the formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, L is the contracted length.

So, in this case, L is 0.80 m and L0 is 1.00 m. So plugging in, 0.8 = 1 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me write that down:

0.8 = sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(0.8)^2 = 1 - v²/c²
0.64 = 1 - (v²/c²)
Then, v²/c² = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36
So, v/c = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6.

Wait, because v/c can't be more than 1. So v is 0.6c. So the speed must be 0.6c for the observer to measure the length as 0.80 m.

Wait, but wait a moment. The question says the rod is moving, so the observer is moving relative to the rod. But in this problem, I think the setup is that the rod is at rest, and the observer is moving in the opposite direction, or perhaps along the length. So the length contraction is when the rod is moving. So the observer is moving such that the rod's length is contracted.

Alternatively, if the observer is moving towards the rod, their frame would see the rod's length as longer, but that's not the case here. Because the rod's length is 1.00 m, and the observer measures it as 0.80 m, which is shorter. So that must mean the rod is moving towards the observer, but wait, no, in this case, the rod is at rest, and the observer is moving. So the observer, moving relative to the rod's rest frame, would see the rod's length contracted.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the rod measures 1.00 m in its rest system. So the observer is moving such that the rod's length is 0.80 m. So the rod's length is contracted, meaning the rod is moving towards the observer, but I'm not sure. Because if the rod is moving towards the observer, the observer would perceive a shorter length. Wait, no, if the rod is moving towards the observer, it's moving in the same direction as the observer's motion. Hmm, maybe I should stick with the formula.

So, using the formula I applied, v = 0.6c. So among the options, that's option E: 0.60c.

Wait, but wait a second, the problem says "an observer move to measure its length to be 0.80 m". So the observer is moving relative to the rod. The rod is at rest, so the observer's frame would see the rod's length contracted. So yeah, using the formula, that's correct.

To determine the speed at which an observer must move parallel to a rod to measure its length as 0.80 m, we use the concept of length contraction from special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( L \) is the observed length (0.80 m),
- \( L_0 \) is the proper length (1.00 m),
- \( v \) is the relative speed between the rod and the observer,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

Substituting the given values:

\[
0.80 = 1.00 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
0.64 = 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \( v = 0.60c \). Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**E: 0.60c**
