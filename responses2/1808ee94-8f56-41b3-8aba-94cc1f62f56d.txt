Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about depreciating a cage using the declining balance method. Hmm, I remember that depreciation is a way to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life. The question says the accountants are using the declining balance method with a rate of 15%. I think the declining balance method is also called the accelerated depreciation method because it's a higher rate than simple straight-line.

The cage was purchased for $1,950 and we need to find its book value after 3 years. The options are from A to J, all different amounts. I need to figure out the formula for declining balance depreciation.

Wait, right, the formula for the book value each year is calculated based on the remaining value multiplied by the depreciation rate. So each year, the book value is reduced by the depreciation amount.

So the formula for each year's depreciation is usually (Cost * Rate). But since it's declining balance, the rate is applied to the book value each year, not the original cost. So each year, the depreciation is (current book value) * rate.

Let me think step by step.

First year's depreciation: 15% of $1,950.

15% is 0.15. So 1,950 * 0.15 = 292.5. So the book value after first year is 1950 - 292.5 = 1657.5.

Second year: Depreciation is 15% of 1657.5. Let's calculate that.

15% of 1657.5 is 0.15 * 1657.5. Let me compute that: 1657.5 * 0.15. Hmm, 1657.5 * 0.1 is 165.75, and 1657.5 * 0.05 is 82.875. Adding them: 165.75 +82.875 = 248.625. So the depreciation is $248.625. The book value after second year is 1657.5 - 248.625 = 1408.875.

Third year: Depreciation is 15% of 1408.875.

15% of 1408.875 is 0.15 * 1408.875. Let's calculate that: 1408.875 * 0.1 is 140.8875, 1408.875 * 0.05 is 70.44375. Adding them: 140.8875 +70.44375=211.33125. So depreciation is $211.33125. The book value after third year is 1408.875 - 211.33125 = 1197.54375.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one is closest to that. Let's check the options:

Option C is $1,197.54 which is approximately what I got. Option E is $1,750 which is way higher. So the correct answer should be C.

The book value of the cage after 3 years using the declining balance method with a 15% rate is $1,197.54.

Answer: C
