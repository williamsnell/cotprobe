Okay, so I have this question about demographic transitions. I remember that demography is all about population changes, right? There are different stages in a person's life that affect birth and death rates. Let me think about the stages.

I think the first stage is called the 'high birth rate' stage. Hmm, where do I remember this from? Oh right, during this stage, the population grows because people are having more children. So birth rates are high, but what about death rates?

Wait, I think during the first stage, death rates are also high. Because people are having children, there's still a lot of people dying. So high birth and high death rates. But the problem is, the death rates don't keep increasing. They probably plateau or start to decline because of other factors, like disease, pollution, or maybe the old age of people.

Looking at the options, option E says high birth rates with declining death rates. That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: low birth rates, which I don't think is the first stage. B: low birth, high death. No, because first stage is high both. C: high, steady death. No, they're not steady, they start to decline. D: steadily declining birth, high death. No, that's the next stage. F: fluctuating. I think that's the second stage. G: low birth rates, high death. No, first stage is high. H: fluctuating birth, high death. No, the birth is high. J: low, low death. No, the first stage is high.

So E is correct. The first stage has high birth rates, but death rates keep going down. So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: high birth rates with declining death rates.
