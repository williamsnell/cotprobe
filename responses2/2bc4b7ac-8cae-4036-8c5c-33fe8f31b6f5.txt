Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about balancing a chemical reaction and then determining the amount of CO2 produced. 

Alright, the problem says that we have 84 grams of ethane and unlimited oxygen. I need to find out how many grams of CO2 result. The reaction given isn't balanced, so first I should balance it.

The unbalanced reaction given is: C₂H₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O. Hmm, I remember from class that balancing reactions requires making sure the number of each type of atom is the same on both sides.

Starting with ethane (C₂H₄). On the left side, there are 2 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms. On the right, each CO₂ has one carbon and two H₂O have two hydrogens each. Let's balance them.

First, balance the carbon atoms. There are two on the left, so I'll put 2 CO₂ on the right. Now, the equation looks like C₂H₄ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + H₂O.

Next, look at the hydrogen. On the left, there are 4 H's, and on the right, each H₂O has 2 H's. So I need 2 H₂O to balance the H. Now the equation is C₂H₄ + O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O.

Now, balance oxygen. Let's count them. On the right, 2 CO₂ have 2*2=4 O, and 2 H₂O have 2*1=2 O. So total O is 6 on the right. On the left, we have O₂, which is 2 O per molecule. Let's see how many O₂ molecules are needed.

If 2 O₂ molecules contribute 4 O atoms (since each O₂ has two O), but wait, the right side needs 6 O in total. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, each O₂ has two O atoms. So for the right side, 4 O from CO2 and 2 O from H2O is 6 O. So O on the right is 6. O on the left is 2 times the number of O2 molecules. So 2 O₂ * 2 = 4 O. So we have 4 O on the left, but need 6 on the right. Hmm, so we're missing 2 O. So how to add that?

Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. The right side has 2 CO₂ (each has 2 O) = 4 O, and 2 H₂O (each has 1 O) = 2 O, so 6 O total. Left side: O2 has 2 O each, so O2 must be 3 molecules (3*2=6). Oh, wait, that's correct! Because 3 O2 molecules give 6 O atoms. So the balanced equation is:

C₂H₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O.

Let me check again. Carbon: 2 on each side. Hydrogen: 4 on each side. Oxygen: 6 on each side. Yep, that's balanced.

Now, the next step is to find out how much CO2 is produced when 84 grams of ethane reacts completely with oxygen.

First, I should find the molar masses of ethane and CO2.

Ethane (C₂H₄): Carbon is 12 g/mol, hydrogen is 1. So 2*12 + 4*1 = 24 +4=28 g/mol.

CO2: Carbon is 12, each O is 16. So 12 + 2*16 = 12+32=44 g/mol.

So the molar ratio from the balanced equation is 1 mole C₂H4 → 2 moles CO2.

So, moles of C₂H4 = mass / molar mass = 84g /28 g/mol.

84 divided by 28 is 3. So 3 moles of ethane.

Since the reaction produces 2 CO2 per mole of ethane, 3 moles would produce 3 *2 =6 moles of CO2.

Now, the mass of CO2 is moles * molar mass. 6 moles *44 g/mol= 264 grams.

Looking at the options, option G is 264g. So the answer should be G.

To determine how many grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂) are produced when 84 grams of ethane (C₂H₄) reacts completely with unlimited oxygen, we first balance the chemical reaction. The balanced reaction is:

C₂H₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O.

Next, we calculate the molar masses:
- Ethane (C₂H₄): 2(12) + 4(1) = 28 g/mol.
- Carbon dioxide (CO₂): 12 + 2(16) = 44 g/mol.

The molar ratio from the balanced equation is 1 mole of ethane to 2 moles of CO₂. 

1. Convert the mass of ethane to moles:
   \[
   \text{Moles of ethane} = \frac{84 \, \text{g}}{28 \, \text{g/mol}} = 3 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. Use the molar ratio to find moles of CO₂:
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO₂} = 3 \, \text{moles of ethane} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{moles of CO₂}.
   \]

3. Convert moles of CO₂ to grams:
   \[
   \text{Mass of CO₂} = 6 \, \text{moles} \times 44 \, \text{g/mol} = 264 \, \text{g}.
   \]

Thus, the mass of CO₂ produced is **264 g**. The correct answer is **G**.
