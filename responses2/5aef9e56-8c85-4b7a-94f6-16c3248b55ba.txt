Question:

Sometimes, when the percentages in a discount series are familiar fractions, such as 33(1/2)% = (1/3) , 12(1/2)% = (1/8) or 6(1/4)% = (1/16) you can solve the problem more easily if you change the order of the discounting. What is the net amount you get from (a) $63.60 less 16(2/3)% and 10% (b) $126.00 less 2% and 66(2/3)%?

Options:

A: $54.24, $44.52
B: $50.88, $37.80
C: $47.70, $41.16
D: $53.00, $42.00
E: $5.30, $0.84
F: $48.96, $38.88
G: $42.84, $39.06
H: $45.30, $43.20
I: $60.00, $40.00
J: $10.60, $84.00

Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the net amount after applying discounts. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

The problem has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): $63.60 less 16(2/3)% and then 10%. I need to find the net amount after both discounts. Wait, wait, I remember that when you apply multiple discounts, you have to apply them one after the other. So first, I'll apply the 16(2/3)% discount, then the 10% discount on the resulting amount.

Let me calculate 16(2/3)% as a fraction. 16 and two-thirds is 16.666...%, which is equal to 50/3 percent. To convert this percentage to a decimal, I divide 50 by 3 and then divide by 100. So 50/3 is approximately 16.6667%, which as a decimal is about 0.166667. 

So the first discount is 16.6667% of $63.60. Let me compute that. 63.60 multiplied by 0.166667. Let's see, 63.60 * 0.166667 is approximately 10.60. So subtracting that from the original amount: 63.60 - 10.60 = 53.00. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 63.60 minus 10.60 is 53.00? That seems low. Wait, 10.60 is 16.6667%, so 63.60 * (50/3)/100 is 63.60 * (50/300) = 63.60 * (1/6) = 10.60. So yes, 63.60 minus 10.60 is 53.00, correct.

Now, the second discount is 10%. So we take 10% of 53.00. 53 * 0.10 = 5.30. Subtracting this from 53.00 gives 53.00 - 5.30 = 47.70. So the net amount is $47.70. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Or did I mess up the order of applying the discounts?

Wait, wait, no, wait. Because when you have multiple discounts, you have to apply them in the order they are given. So first, 16(2/3)% is applied, then 10%. So I think that's correct. So the net amount for part (a) is $47.70.

Moving on to part (b): $126.00 less 2% and 66(2/3)%.

Again, applying discounts in sequence. First, 2%, then 66(2/3)%. Let's compute each step.

First, 2% of $126.00 is 126 * 0.02 = 2.52. Subtracting that from 126 gives 126 - 2.52 = 123.48.

Now, the next discount is 66(2/3)%, which is 66.6667%, or 200/3 percent. Wait, no. Wait, 66(2/3)% is 200/3%? Wait, no. Wait, 66 and two-thirds percent is 66.666...%, which is 200/3 divided by 100? Wait, 66.666666...% is 200/3 divided by 100? Wait, wait, 66.666666...% is equal to 200/3 divided by 100? No, wait, 66.666666...% is 66 and 2/3 percent, which is 200/3% when expressed as a fraction. Because 2/3 is 0.666..., so 66 and two-thirds percent is 66.666...%, which is 200/3 percent as a fraction. Wait, wait, let me double-check. 66.666...% is equal to 200/3 divided by 100? Because 200/3 is approximately 66.666...%. Yes, because 200/3 is 66.(6), so percent-wise, that's 66.(6)%.

So to convert 66.666666...% to a decimal for calculation, it's 0.6666666. So, 66.666666% is 200/3 percent, which as a decimal is 0.6666666.

So the next step is to take 200/3% of 123.48. Let me compute 123.48 * (200/3)/100. Simplify that: 123.48 * 200/(3*100) = 123.48 * 200/300 = 123.48 * (2/3) = 82.32.

Wait, wait, let's compute that step by step. Alternatively, 123.48 * (200/3)/100. Let's compute 200/3 = approx 66.6666667, but perhaps it's better to compute as (123.48) * (200)/300 = 123.48 * (2/3). So 123.48 divided by 3 is about 41.16, multiplied by 2 gives 82.32.

So, 123.48 minus 82.32 is equal to 41.16. So the net amount is $41.16.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check: 66.666666% is 200/3 percent. So:

First discount: 2% of 126 is 2.52, so 126 - 2.52 = 123.48.

Second discount: 66.666666% of 123.48 is 66.666666% * 123.48.

Wait, maybe another way to compute the total discount is to realize that applying 100% - 66.666666% = 33.333333% discount is equivalent to multiplying by (1 - 0.6666666) = 0.3333333.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2% plus 66.666666% discounts. Wait, no, the total discount would be 2% + 66.666666% = 68.6666666667% discount. So the net is 100% - 68.6666666667% = 31.3333333333%.

So the net amount is 126 * (31.3333333333/100) = 126 * (1/3.2) or 126 * 0.3133333333.

Wait, 31.3333333333% is approximately 1/3.2, because 1/3 is 33.33333333%, which is 30% of 3.333333333.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 126 * (31.3333333333/100) = 126 * 0.3133333333.

Calculating 126 * 0.3133333333:

0.3133333333 is approximately 0.313333.

So 126 * 0.313333 = let's compute 126 * 0.3 = 37.8, and 126 * 0.013333 ≈ 126 * (1/75) ≈ 1.68. So total is approx 37.8 + 1.68 = 39.48. Wait, but that doesn't match with the earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 126 * (100 - 68.66666666667)/100 = 126 * 31.3333333333/100.

Wait, 31.3333333333% of 126.

Alternatively, 31.3333333333% is 1/3.2. So 126 * (1/3.2) = 126 / 3.2 = 39.375.

Wait, but this is conflicting with the previous calculation of 41.16. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, let me go back. Let's recalculate part (b).

First, 2% of $126 is 2.52. So after the first discount, it's 126 - 2.52 = 123.48.

Second discount is 66.6666667%, which is 200/3 percent. So 66.6666667% of $123.48.

Wait, 66.6666667% is two-thirds (2/3). So 66.6666667% of 123.48 is (2/3)*123.48 = 82.32. So subtracting that from 123.48 gives 41.16.

So the net amount is $41.16.

Wait, but earlier I tried a different method and got 39.375. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 123.48 * (66.66666666666667/100).

66.66666666666667% is 66.66666666666667/100 = 0.6666666666666667.

So 123.48 * 0.6666666666666667 = ?

Well, 123.48 * (2/3) = (123.48 * 2)/3 = 246.96 /3 = 82.32. So yes, correct.

So the net amount is 123.48 - 82.32 = 41.16.

So part (b) is $41.16.

Wait, but looking at the options, the net amounts are in the options A through J.

Looking at the options:

Looking at part (a) and (b), let's see the options. The options are labeled A to J, each with two amounts.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: $50.88, $37.80.

Option C: $47.70, $41.16.

Option D: $53.00, $42.00.

Option E: $60.00, $40.00.

Option F: $48.96, $38.88.

Option G: $42.84, $39.06.

Option H: $45.30, $43.20.

Option I: $60.00, $40.00.

Option J: $10.60, $84.00.

So from our calculations:

(a) net is $47.70.

(b) net is $41.16.

Looking for an option where the first number is $47.70 and the second is $41.16.

Looking at the options:

Option C: $47.70, $41.16. Yes, that's option C.

Wait, but let me check: the options for part (b) is $41.16, which is option C's second number.

So the correct answer is option C: (a) $47.70, (b) $41.16.
</think>

The correct option is C: $47.70, $41.16.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

(a) Calculate 16(2/3)% (which is 50/3%) of $63.60, then subtract that from $63.60:
- 16(2/3)% of 63.60 = 63.60 * (50/3)/100 = 63.60 * (50/300) = 10.60.
- Subtract from 63.60: 63.60 - 10.60 = 53.00.
- Apply 10% discount: 53.00 * 0.10 = 5.30.
- Net amount: 53.00 - 5.30 = 47.70.

(b) Calculate 2% of $126.00, then subtract that, then apply 66(2/3)% (which is 200/3%) discount:
- 2% of 126.00 = 2.52.
- Subtract: 126.00 - 2.52 = 123.48.
- 66(2/3)% of 123.48 = 123.48 * (200/3)/100 = 82.32.
- Subtract: 123.48 - 82.32 = 41.16.

Answer: (a) $47.70, (b) $41.16 → Option C.
