Okay, so I've got this question about powerful numbers. Let me think. I remember that a powerful number is a positive integer where, for every prime factor p of n, p squared (p²) is also a factor of n. Hmm. So, each prime in the prime factorization of n must appear at least twice.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: 297. Let's factorize 297. 297 divided by 3 is 99, which is 9*11, so 297 is 3³ * 11. The prime factors are 3 and 11. Now, 3² is 9, which divides 297, but 11² is 121. Does 121 divide 297? 297 divided by 121 is 2.45... So no, it doesn't. So 297 is not powerful.

Option B: 392. Let's break that down. 392 divided by 2 is 196, then 196 is 14², which is 2² * 7². So 392 is 2³ * 7². So the primes are 2 and 7. 2² is 4, which divides 392, and 7² is 49, which also divides it. So 392 is powerful.

Option C: 300. Let's factorize. 300 is 3 * 100, which is 3 * 10². 10² is (2*5)² = 2² *5². So 300 is 2² * 3 *5². So primes are 2, 3, 5. Each squared is a factor. Wait, 2² is 4, which divides 300. 3² is 9, does 9 divide 300? 300 divided by 9 is 33.333... So no. So 300 is not powerful.

Option D: 240. Let's factorize. 240 is 16 * 15, which is 16 is 2⁴. 15 is 3*5. So 240 is 2⁴ *3 *5. The primes are 2,3,5. 2² is 4, which divides 240. 3² is 9, does 240 divide by 9? 240/9 is 26.666... So no. So 240 isn't powerful.

Option E: 336. Let's factorize. 336 divided by 2 is 168, divided by 2 again is 84, again is 42, again is 21. So 2⁴ *21. 21 is 3*7. So 336 is 2⁴ *3 *7. So primes are 2,3,7. 2² is 4: 336/4 is 84, which is good. 3² is 9: 336/9 is 37.333... So no, 9 doesn't divide 336. So 336 isn't powerful.

Option F: 360. Let's factorize 360. 360 is 36 *10, which is 6² * 2*5. 6² is 2²*3², so 360 is (2² *3²) * 2 *5. So that's 2³ *3² *5. So primes are 2,3,5. 2² is 4: 360/4 is 90, which is okay. 3² is 9: 360/9 is 40, yes. 5² is 25: 360/25 is 14.4. So 25 doesn't divide 360. So 360 isn't powerful.

Option G: 408. Let's factorize. 408/2 is 204, /2 is 102, /2 is 51. So 2³ *51. 51 is 3*17. So 408 is 2³ *3 *17. Primes are 2,3,17. 2² is 4: 408/4 is 102, okay. 3² is 9: 408/9 is 45.333... So no. 17² is 289, which doesn't divide 408. So 408 isn't powerful.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in some of these. Let me double-check.

Looking back, option B is 392. Its factors are 2³ and 7², which are both squared. So that's the one. The other options don't meet the condition. So the correct answer is B: 392.

The correct answer is B: 392, as it is the only number in the options where all prime factors have squares dividing the number.

Answer: B
