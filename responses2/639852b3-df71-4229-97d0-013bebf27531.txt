Okay, so I've got this sum to evaluate: 1/(2^1) + 2/(2^2) + 3/(2^3) + ... and so on. I remember that this is a series where each term is of the form k/(2^k). I think this is a type of infinite series that converges to a specific value. 

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula, but I recall something about the sum of k*r^k. Wait, right! There's a formula for the sum of k*r^k from k=1 to infinity. Let me think. I think it's r/(1 - r)^2, but I'm not certain. Oh wait, r is a ratio between -1 and 1 for convergence. In this case, r would be 1/2 because each term is divided by 2^k, which is (1/2)^k. So r is 1/2, so the formula would be (1/2) divided by (1 - 1/2)^2.

Let me calculate that. The denominator (1 - 1/2) is 1/2, and squared is 1/4. So 1/2 divided by 1/4 is the same as (1/2) * (4/1) which equals 2. So the sum should be 2. Let me cross-check. If I plug in the first few terms, 1/2 is 0.5, 2/4 is 0.5, 3/8 is 0.375, adding up to about 1.375. The next term is 4/16, which is 0.25, bringing the total to 1.625. Then 5/32 is about 0.156, bringing it to 1.781, and so on. It seems like it's approaching 2. So I think the answer is 2, which is option A.

The sum is a geometric series variant. Using the formula for the sum of k/(2^k), which converges to 2. Therefore, the answer is A: 2.
