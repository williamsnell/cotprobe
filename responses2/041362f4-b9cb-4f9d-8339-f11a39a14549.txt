Okay, so I have this question about Bulimia Nervosa and its treatment. I've heard a bit about it before, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that Bulimia Nervosa is a type of depression caused by an inability to eat properly. The main symptoms include feeling hungry, weight gain, and maybe even mood swings. The question is about what is considered correct regarding treatment.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: It is not useful to discuss weight with patients. Hmm, I don't think this is correct. Weight is definitely a symptom, and discussing it might help in managing the mood and reducing the effects of bulimia. So maybe A is wrong.

Option B: Treatment should focus solely on physical symptoms. I remember reading that while physical symptoms are important, it's not the only thing. The psychological aspects are also crucial. So B might not be the correct answer.

Option C: Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics. I think that's a common approach. People often try to avoid what's going on, so avoiding food is a big part of treatment. So C could be correct.

Option D: Use of antipsychotic medication is first-line treatment. Wait, I think that's not the case. I recall that in many cases, especially for bulimia, it's more about behavioral changes rather than medications. So D might not be right.

Option E: The first approach is to discuss body image. I don't think discussing body image is the first line. It's more about addressing the underlying causes, like diet and avoidances. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit. Fluoxetine is a medication used for mood and depression, but I'm not sure if it's the first-line treatment for bulimia. I think it's used sometimes, but not necessarily the first choice. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: Treatment should prioritize on patients' social relationships. I don't think that's part of the standard approach. Social aspects are more about managing relationships, not directly addressing the physical causes of bulimia. So G might be wrong.

Option H: Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices. Purging is about avoiding food, which is a common tactic, but I don't think it's the only approach. There are other methods too, so H might not be the correct choice.

Option I: The main treatment approach is diet control. I think diet control is one method, but again, not the only one. So I might be wrong, but maybe it's a part of the treatment rather than the primary approach.

Option J: Treatment should ignore the psychological aspects of the disorder. That doesn't make sense. The disorder is about eating, which ties into the mind. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me go back. The options are A through J. The question is asking which statement is correct about the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa.

So, the correct answer would be either C or possibly another.

I remember that treating bulimia involves addressing both the physical and psychological factors. So the first line of treatment might not be medications, but rather behavioral changes. So option C says therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics. That makes sense because avoiding food is a key part of the treatment.

Another point is that the treatment often includes behavioral therapy and might not focus solely on physical symptoms. So option B is incorrect because it says solely on physical symptoms, which isn't the case.

So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics. 

**Answer:** C
