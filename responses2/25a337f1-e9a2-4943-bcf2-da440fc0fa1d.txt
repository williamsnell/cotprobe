Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the human genome and protein encoding. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I know that the human genome is the entire set of DNA in the human body. It's made up of about 2.7 billion base pairs. Proteins are made from these DNA sequences, so a lot of the genome is involved in making proteins. But how much exactly?

I remember hearing that about 60-70% of the genome is involved in making proteins. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me think. I think the exact proportion is around 75-80%. Oh, wait, maybe it's less. I'm trying to recall from biology classes. 

So, the options given are: A is 50%, B is 5%, C is 60%, D is 25%, E is 90%, F is 10%, G is 80%, H is 75%, I is 2%, J is 35%. 

Wait, option G is 80%, which fits the idea that about two-thirds of the genome is involved. But wait, what's the exact figure? I think in some studies, it's around 70-75%, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Another way to approach this: the human genome encodes about 20-30% of all the proteins on Earth. Wait, but that's a different measure. The total number of proteins is way more. So 20-30% of all proteins, but the question is about the genomic portion. 

I've heard that the proportion of the genome that codes for proteins is about 75-80%. So looking at the options, G is 80% and H is 75%. I'm a bit confused because I think the exact percentage is closer to 75%. 

Wait, another approach: I think the RNA from the genome (mRNA and tRNA) are involved in making proteins. But the DNA sequence is about half of the proteins, but that's not the whole story because proteins are encoded by the DNA, but not all of it because the ribosomes and other structures are involved. 

Alternatively, I remember an example: humans have about 20,000-30,000 proteins. But the entire genome is about 2.7 billion base pairs. So the fraction is roughly (2.7e9) divided by (number of proteins). If proteins are around say 100,000, then 2.7e9 / 1e5 = about 27,000. So 27,000 / 2.7e9 = 0.01, which is 1%. But that's a very rough calculation. 

Wait, but the actual number of proteins is much higher. I think the exact number is about 140,000 proteins in humans. So 2.7e9 / 1.4e5 = about 19,285,714. That's approximately 20 million. So 20 million / 2.7e9 ≈ 0.0074, which is 0.74%, about 1/133. That's way lower than 10%, but that can't be right because I remember that the DNA is about 20% of the proteins. 

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbers. Let's think differently. Suppose the genome encodes about 60-70% of all proteins. So if all proteins are about 10,000, but no, that's way less. Wait, perhaps the fraction is about 75%. Because 75% of the DNA is involved in making a third of the proteins. Or maybe the other way around: if the DNA has about 20% of all proteins, then the genome is about 70% of all proteins. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused now. 

Wait, let me think. The human genome is about 2.7 billion base pairs. Proteins are about 20,000-30,000. So the fraction is 2.7e9 / 3e4 ≈ 9e4, which is about 0.003 or 0.3% of the genome. But that's if each protein is 3000 bases. But I think the actual number of proteins is higher. Wait, I think it's about 140,000 proteins. So 2.7e9 / 1.4e5 = about 19,285,714 (approx 19.3 million). So 19.3 million / 2.7e9 ≈ 0.007 or 0.7%, which is about 1/143. So that's about 0.7% or 1/143. But none of the options are close to 0.7%, except maybe option J (35%) or D (25%). 

Wait, another approach: I've read that around 60-70% of the genome is involved in protein synthesis, but that's not the same as the fraction of the genome that encodes proteins. So the numbers might vary, but the answer is somewhere in the middle. 

Wait, the correct answer is about 75-80% of the genome coding for proteins. Looking at the options, G is 80%, which is the closest. So the correct answer would be G, 80%. Alternatively, H is 75%, which is also a possibility. 

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think of another way. The human genome is about 2.7e9 bp. Proteins are made from about 20,000 proteins. Wait, no, that's the number of proteins, but each is a few thousand bp. So 20,000 proteins * 3000 bp = 60 million bp. So 60,000,000 / 2.7e9 ≈ 2.22%. So about 2% of the genome is involved in making proteins. But that's a very rough estimate. 

Wait, but I've read that the DNA sequence is involved in a third of the proteins. So 1/3 of the genome is involved in about a third of the proteins. So that would be about 80% of the genome (since 1/3 is about 33%, so 33% * 3 is 100%). Wait, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, each protein is made from a few thousand base pairs. If a protein is 2000 bp, then 2000/2.7e9 = approx 0.00074%, which is 0.007% of the genome. But if each protein is 5000 bp, 5000/2.7e9 ≈ 1.85e-5, which is 0.0185%. So that's about 0.02% per protein. But if a person has about 20,000 proteins, that's 20,000 * 0.02% = 0.4% of the genome. 

Wait, but this is getting too detailed. I think I should rely on what I remember. I recall that the human genome encodes about 75-80% of the proteins on Earth. So the correct answer is probably G) 80% or H)75%. 

Looking at the options, option G is 80%. So the answer is G. Alternatively, option H is 75%, which is also correct. But wait, I think the correct fraction is closer to 74%, so 75% is the closest option. 

Wait, another angle: the question is about the fraction of the genome that encodes proteins. So I'm pretty sure that the answer is 75-80%, so G (80%) or H (75%). But the options are G and H. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 75%. I've read that about 75% of the DNA is involved in making proteins, which would make the fraction of the genome encoding about 75%. So the answer would be H)75%. 

Wait, but another source I've seen says that about 75% of the genome encodes for proteins, so the correct answer is H)75%. 

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to find a more concrete approach. 

I remember that the human genome encodes about 20,000 proteins. So, 2.7e9 bp / 20,000 proteins = 135,000,000 bp per protein on average. So, 135,000,000 / 2.7e9 = 0.05 or 5% of the genome is involved in making each protein. So 5% * 20k proteins = 1000% of the genome? That can't be right, because 20k proteins require 2e8 bp (20,000 * 1e4 = 2e8). Wait, no, that's 20,000 * 1000 bp = 2e7. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. 

Alternatively, if each protein is 1000 bp, then 20k proteins require 20,000,000 bp. So 20,000,000 / 2.7e9 = ~7.4%, which is about 7%. So that's 7% of the genome. But that's a rough estimate. 

I think the correct answer is around 75-80%, so the options are G (80%) or H (75%). I'm a bit torn, but I think the correct answer is G) 80% because most sources say that about 75-80% of the genome encodes proteins. 

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Another approach: The human genome has 2.7e9 bp. Proteins are made from about 20,000 proteins, each about 1000 bp. So 2e4 * 1e3 = 2e7 bp. So 2e7 / 2.7e9 = approx 0.0074 or 0.74%. So about 0.7% of the genome is involved in producing proteins. But that's about 0.7% of the entire genome. So the fraction is 0.7% of the genome, which is about 0.007 or 0.7%. But the options provided don't include 0.7%, so perhaps the question is asking for a different number. 

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the fraction of the genome that codes for proteins in terms of the number of genes. So if each gene encodes several proteins, but the total number of genes is about 20,000, then the fraction would be different. But the question is about the genome, which codes for proteins, not the genes themselves. 

I think I'm stuck here, but based on what I know, the correct answer is approximately 75-80% of the genome encodes proteins. So the options are G (80%) and H (75%). I think the correct answer should be G) 80%.

The question asks for the fraction of the human genome that encodes proteins. The human genome is approximately 2.7 billion base pairs (bp), and proteins are encoded by this DNA. The fraction of the genome involved in protein coding is typically estimated to be around 75-80%. 

To determine this, consider that the human genome encodes approximately 20,000 proteins, each on average around 1000 bp. This results in about 20,000 × 1000 = 20,000,000 bp of protein-coding regions. Dividing this by the total genome size (2.7e9 bp) gives approximately 0.0074 or 0.74%, which is about 0.7% of the genome. However, this is a very rough estimate, and the actual fraction is closer to 75-80%.

Looking at the options provided, the closest answer is **G: 80%**. While 75% (option H) is also plausible, 80% is more commonly cited as the approximate fraction of the genome that encodes proteins.

Answer: G
