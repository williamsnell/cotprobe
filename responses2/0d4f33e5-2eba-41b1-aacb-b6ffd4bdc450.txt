Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the reflection coefficient for voltage waves at the load end of a transmission line. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the reflection coefficient, often denoted as Γ, is a measure of the reflection of a voltage wave at the load compared to the characteristic impedance of the line. Oh right, the formula is Γ = (Z_L - Z0) / (Z_L + Z0), where Z_L is the load impedance and Z0 is the characteristic impedance.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the load is a 25 - j75 ohm impedance. Oh, right, the negative sign in the imaginary part indicates that the impedance is not purely resistive—maybe it's a complex impedance, which makes sense in some cases, like with lossy lines or with certain materials.

And the characteristic impedance Z0 is given as 50 ohms. So plugging in the numbers, Z_L is 25 - j75, and Z0 is 50. So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Let me write that down. The numerator is Z_L minus Z0, which is (25 - j75) - 50. That would be (25-50) - j75, which is (-25) - j75. The denominator is Z_L plus Z0, which is (25- j75) +50, so that's 75 - j75.

So Γ = (-25 - j75) / (75 - j75). Hmm, I think I should compute this complex fraction. Maybe by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it.

So the denominator's complex conjugate is 75 + j75. Let me do that. Multiply numerator and denominator by (75 + j75).

Numerator becomes (-25 -j75)(75 + j75). Let me compute that. Let's expand it:

(-25)(75) + (-25)(j75) + (-j75)(75) + (-j75)(j75).

Compute each term:

-25*75 = -1875. Then, (-25)(j75) = -1875j. Next, (-j75)(75) = -75*75 j = -5625j. Last term: (-j75)(j75) is -j^2 *75^2. Since j^2 is -1, this becomes +75^2, which is 5625.

So adding up all terms:

Real parts: (-1875) + 5625 = 3750.

Imaginary parts: (-1875j) + (-5625j) = -7500j.

So numerator is 3750 - 7500j.

Denominator is (75 - j75)(75 + j75) = 75^2 - (j75)^2. Since j^2 is -1, this is 5625 - (-75^2), which is 5625 + 5625 = 11250.

So denominator is 11250.

So Γ becomes (3750 - 7500j)/11250.

Simplify each term: 3750/11250 = 1/3 approximately 0.3333. Wait, 11250 ÷ 3 is 3750. So 3750/11250 is 1/3, which is about 0.3333.

Similarly, 7500/11250 = 2/3, which is about 0.6667.

So Γ = (0.3333 - j0.6667) . 

Wait, but that's the magnitude and phase. Let me compute the magnitude of Γ. The magnitude is the square root of ( (0.3333)^2 + (-0.6667)^2 ). So 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.5555. Square root of 0.5555 is about 0.745. So the magnitude is about 0.745.

Now, what's the angle? The angle of Γ is the arctangent of (Im/Re). The imaginary part here is -0.6667, and real is 0.3333. So the angle is arctangent(-0.6667/0.3333) = arctangent(-2). That's -63.4349 degrees. But wait, 63.4349 degrees is approximately 180 - 116.5651? Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, since it's negative, it's in the fourth quadrant.

Wait, the reflection coefficient can be written in polar form as Γ = |Γ| * e^(jθ), where θ is the phase angle.

Wait, but let me think again. The reflection coefficient's angle is determined by the ratio of the imaginary to real parts. So when I have Γ = (0.3333 - j0.6667), the real part is 0.3333 and the imaginary is -0.6667. So the angle is arctangent(-0.6667 / 0.3333) = arctangent(-2). So the angle is -63.4349 degrees.

But wait, the answer options have angles like -116.5651°, which is about -2/3 of 180, 60°. Hmm, 116.5651 is 63.4349 * 2, which is 126.87 or something else? Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute the angle more precisely. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the angle as arctangent( (Im/Re) ), where Im is negative. So Im/Re is (-0.6667)/(0.3333) = -2. The arctangent of -2 is -63.4349 degrees. But wait, that's the angle in the fourth quadrant. The reflection coefficient could have a phase angle of either negative or positive 63.43 degrees, but the standard form is often expressed as the magnitude with a positive angle, perhaps.

Wait, but wait: the reflection coefficient is calculated as (Z_L - Z0) / (Z_L + Z0). So if Z_L is 25 - j75 and Z0 is 50, then (25-j75 -50) is (-25 -j75), and (25-j75 +50) is (75-j75). So Γ is (-25 -j75)/(75 -j75) = [ (-25 -j75) ] / [75 -j75 ]

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the impedance as 25 - j75. So let me compute:

Z_L = 25 - j75.

Z0 = 50.

So Z_L - Z0 = (25 - 50) - j75 = (-25) - j75.

Z_L + Z0 = (25 + 50) - j75 = 75 - j75.

So the ratio is (-25 - j75) / (75 - j75).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out a negative from both numerator and denominator. Let me try.

Numerator: (-25 - j75) = - (25 + j75). Wait, 25 + j75 is the complex conjugate of 25 - j75, but maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe compute the real and imaginary parts. Let me compute the magnitude and phase.

The magnitude |Γ| is sqrt( (Re/(Re^2 + Im^2)) )? Wait, no, the magnitude of Γ is |Z_L - Z0| / |Z_L + Z0|.

Wait another approach: Let me compute the ratio as (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0) = [ (25 - j75) - 50 ] / [ (25 - j75) +50 ] => (-25 - j75)/(75 - j75) = [ ( -25 - j75 ) ] / [75 - j75 ].

Let me compute this division:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of denominator:

Denominator's conjugate is 75 + j75.

So:

[ (-25 - j75) (75 + j75) ] / [ (75 - j75)(75 + j75) ]

Compute denominator: 75² + (75)^2 = 5625 + 5625 = 11250.

Numerator:

-25 *75 = -1875.

-25 * j75 = -1875 j.

-j75 *75 = -75*75 j = -5625 j.

-j75 * j75 = - (j²)(75²) = -(-1)(5625) = 5625.

So adding all terms:

Real parts: (-1875) +5625 = 3750.

Imaginary parts: (-1875 j) + (-5625 j) = (-7500 j).

So numerator is 3750 -7500j.

So Γ = (3750 -7500j)/11250 = 3750/11250 = 0.333333... and -7500/11250 = -0.666666...

So Γ is 0.3333 - 0.6667 j.

Wait, but wait, the angle of this complex number is in the fourth quadrant because real part is positive, and imaginary part is negative.

So the angle is arctangent( (-0.6667)/(0.3333) ) = arctangent(-2) ≈ -63.4349 degrees. But since the phase is negative, but reflection coefficients can have a positive angle if the phase is taken as positive (i.e., the angle is expressed in the range -180 to 180 or 0 to 360), depending on convention.

Wait, but looking at the options, they have angles like -116.5651°, which is about -2/3 of 180°. Wait, 116.5651 is approximately 116.565°, which is 2/3 of 180 (since 60 * 3.25 is 200, but perhaps I'm missing something).

Wait, let me compute the exact value of the angle. Since arctangent(-2) is -63.4349 degrees. But perhaps the phase is measured in another way. Alternatively, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the numerator and denominator. Let me re-express Γ.

Wait, is Γ = (Z_L - Z0) / (Z_L + Z0) or (Z_L - Z0) / (Z_L + Z0)? Oh wait, that's correct.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator again.

Z_L = 25 - j75.

Z0 = 50.

So Z_L - Z0 = (25 - j75) -50 = -25 -j75.

Z_L + Z0 = (25 -j75) +50 =75 -j75.

So Γ = (-25 -j75)/(75 -j75).

Let me compute the magnitude of Γ:

The magnitude is |Z_L - Z0| / |Z_L + Z0|.

|Z_L - Z0| = sqrt( (-25)^2 + (-75)^2 ) = sqrt(625 + 5625) = sqrt(6250) = 50√2 ≈ 70.7107.

|Z_L + Z0| = sqrt(75^2 + (-75)^2) = sqrt(5625 + 5625) = sqrt(11250) = 75√2 ≈ 106.066.

So Γ magnitude is (50√2) / (75√2) )= 50/75 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666666... Wait, wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation.

Wait, this can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute |Z_L - Z0| and |Z_L + Z0| correctly.

Wait, let's compute |Z_L - Z0|:

Z_L - Z0 = (-25) + (-j75) = (-25 -j75). So the magnitude is sqrt( (-25)^2 + (-75)^2 ) = sqrt(625 + 5625) = sqrt(6250) = 25 * sqrt(10) because 6250 = 625 *10, sqrt(625) is 25, so 25 * sqrt(10) ≈ 25 *3.1623 ≈79.058.

Similarly, |Z_L + Z0| is sqrt(75^2 + (-75)^2) = sqrt(5625 + 5625) = sqrt(11250) = 75*sqrt(2) ≈ 75*1.4142 ≈106.065.

So Γ's magnitude is 79.058 / 106.065 ≈ 0.745. Oh wait, that matches my earlier calculation. So the magnitude is approximately 0.745, which is the coefficient in the options. So that's the first part.

Now for the angle: the argument of Γ is the angle of (-25 -j75) divided by (75 -j75). So to compute this, maybe it's easier to represent both as vectors and find the angle difference.

Another approach: Let me write the numerator and denominator in polar form.

The numerator, (-25 - j75), can be expressed in polar form as r * e^(iθ), where r is the magnitude, and θ is the angle.

We already found r to be 25*sqrt(10) ≈79.058, and the angle is arctangent( (-75)/(-25) )= arctangent(3) which is about 71.565 degrees. But since both real and imaginary parts are negative, it's in the third quadrant. So θ is 180 + 56.31≈ 236.31 degrees.

Denominator: 75 -j75. The magnitude is 75√2 ≈106.065, and the angle is arctangent( (-75)/75 )= -45 degrees. But since both components are positive (75 real and 75 imaginary negative?), wait, no: 75 -j75. The real part is positive, and the imaginary part is negative. So it's in the fourth quadrant. So the angle is 360 - 45 = 315 degrees.

So Γ is (79.058 at 236.31°) divided by (106.065 at 315°).

When you divide two complex numbers in polar form, you subtract their angles and divide their magnitudes.

So the magnitude of Γ is (79.058/106.065) ≈0.745.

The angle is (236.31 - 315) = -78.69 degrees. Wait, that's -78.69 degrees. But wait, this can't be right because earlier I thought it was -63.43 degrees.

Wait, I'm getting a conflicting result. This suggests that perhaps I should compute the angle of the numerator and denominator correctly.

Wait, the numerator is (-25 - j75), which is 25√10 in magnitude, and the angle is 236.31 degrees as I thought earlier.

Denominator is (75 -j75), which is 75√2 in magnitude, and the angle is 315 degrees.

So when you divide, you take the magnitude (0.745) and the angle (236.31 -315) = -78.69 degrees.

But earlier, when I did the division in rectangular form, I got an angle of -63.4349 degrees. So this is a discrepancy. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle calculation for the numerator. Let me recheck.

The numerator is -25 -j75. So real part is -25, imaginary is -75.

The angle is calculated as arctangent(Im/Re). But since both are negative, it's in the third quadrant. So the actual angle is 180 + arctangent(75/25) = 180 + arctan(3). Arctan(3) is about 71.565°, so 180 + 71.565 = 251.565°, which is the same as 236.31° (since 251.565 - 360 is negative, but in 0-360, 236.31 is correct.

Denominator: 75 -j75. Real is positive, imaginary is negative. So angle is 315 degrees.

So angle of Γ is 236.31 -315 = -78.69 degrees.

Hmm, but earlier when I did the calculation in rectangular form, I got an angle of -63.4349 degrees. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rectangular form calculation.

Let me go back. When I did the rectangular form division, I got Γ = 3750 -7500j over 11250.

Which is 0.3333 -0.6667j. So that's the rectangular form.

Now, the angle of Γ is the angle of 0.3333 -0.6667j. So the real part is positive, imaginary part is negative. So angle is -63.4349 degrees.

But according to the polar form calculation, Γ's angle is -78.69 degrees.

This is a problem because the two methods should give the same result, but they don't. So perhaps one of my calculations is wrong.

Wait, let me re-express Γ in polar form.

Γ is (0.3333 -0.6667j). Let me compute its magnitude and angle.

Magnitude: sqrt( (0.3333)^2 + (-0.6667)^2 ) = sqrt(0.1111 +0.4444) = sqrt(0.5555) ≈0.745.

Angle: arctangent( (-0.6667)/0.3333 )= arctangent(-2). So angle is -63.4349 degrees.

But according to the polar form calculation, Γ's angle is -78.69 degrees.

Wait, this suggests that I made a mistake in the polar form calculation.

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the correct angle for the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me re-calculate the angles.

Numerator: (-25 -j75). Real part is -25, imaginary part is -75. So in the third quadrant. The angle can be calculated as 180 + arctangent(75/25) = 180 + arctangent(3) ≈180 + 71.565=251.565 degrees. But in the fourth quadrant, it's more negative.

Wait, but the angle is commonly represented between -180 and 180 degrees, so 251.565 -360 = -108.43 degrees. Wait, that's not matching with the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator to find the exact angles.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the phase of Γ by using the formula for Γ = (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0) and expressing it in terms of Z_L and Z0.

Let me write Γ in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Γ = [ (25 - j75) -50 ] / [ (25 - j75) +50 ]

= (25 - j75 -50) / (25 - j75 +50)

= (-25 -j75) / (75 -j75).

Let me write this as [ (-25 -j75) ] / [ (75 - j75) ]

To compute this, I can factor out a negative from the numerator:

= [ - (25 + j75) ] / (75 - j75).

Now, I can write this as:

= - [ (25 + j75) / (75 - j75) ].

Now, let me compute the numerator and denominator in polar form.

The numerator is (25 +j75): real 25, imaginary 75.

The denominator is (75 -j75): real 75, imaginary -75.

So the numerator's magnitude is sqrt(25² +75²) = sqrt(625 +5625) = sqrt(6250) = 25*sqrt(10) ≈79.0569.

The denominator's magnitude is sqrt(75² + (-75)^2) = sqrt(5625 +5625) = sqrt(11250) =75*sqrt(2)≈106.066.

The angle of the numerator (25 +j75) is arctangent(75/25)= arctangent(3)= about 71.565 degrees. So it's in the first quadrant.

The angle of the denominator (75 -j75) is arctangent(-75/75) = arctangent(-1)= -45 degrees. Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, it's in the fourth quadrant. So the angle is 360 -45=315 degrees.

So the ratio (25 +j75)/(75 -j75) is (79.0569 at 71.565) / (106.066 at 315).

The magnitude is 79.0569 /106.066 ≈0.745.

The angle is 71.565 -315 = -243.43 degrees.

But since angles are periodic with 360, -243.43 +360 =116.57 degrees. So the angle is 116.57 degrees.

Wait, but since the ratio is negative, the angle is in the third quadrant. Wait, perhaps I should compute it as arctangent( (Im/Re) ), but considering the signs.

Wait, the ratio (25 +j75)/(75 -j75) can be written as (25 +j75) * (75 +j75) / ( (75 -j75)(75 +j75) ). Hmm, perhaps that's a more accurate approach.

Wait, no—perhaps it's better to compute the phase of the entire ratio.

The numerator's angle is 71.565 degrees, denominator's angle is 315 degrees.

So the phase of the ratio is 71.565 -315 = -243.435 degrees. To find the equivalent angle between -180 and 180, we add 360: -243.435 +360 =116.565 degrees.

So the phase of the ratio is 116.565 degrees.

But wait, the ratio is [25 +j75] divided by [75 -j75], which is (25 +j75)/(75 -j75) = (25 +j75)(75 +j75)/( (75 -j75)(75 +j75) )

The denominator (75^2 +75^2) is 11250.

The numerator (25 +j75)(75 +j75) = 25*75 +25j75 +75j75 + (j75)^2.

25*75 = 1875.

25j75 =25*75j= 1875j.

75j75 =75*75j=5625j.

(j75)^2 = (75j)^2= -75^2 = -5625.

So adding them up: 1875 +1875j +5625j -5625.

Combine real parts: 1875 -5625 = -3750.

Imaginary parts: 1875j +5625j =7500j.

So numerator is -3750 +7500j.

Denominator is 11250.

So the ratio is (-3750 +7500j)/11250.

Which is (-3750/11250) + (7500j/11250).

Simplify:

-3750 /11250 = -0.333333.

7500 /11250 =0.666666.

So ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j).

Which is (- (1/3) + j*(2/3)).

So this is a complex number in the second quadrant, because real part is negative, imaginary part is positive.

So the angle of this complex number is arctangent( (Im/Re) ) = arctangent( (2/3)/(-1/3) ) = arctangent( -2 ). So the angle is -63.4349 degrees, as I originally thought.

But wait, the magnitude is sqrt( ( -1/3 )^2 + (2/3 )^2 ) = sqrt( (1/9) + (4/9) ) = sqrt(5/9 )= sqrt(5)/3 ≈0.745.

So Gamma is 0.745 at -63.4349 degrees.

But according to the polar form calculation earlier, the angle is 116.565 degrees.

Wait, this is a problem because the two methods are giving conflicting results.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio in polar form.

Wait, let me recompute the ratio (25 +j75)/(75 -j75).

Let me compute it using the formula:

( a + jb ) / ( c + jd ) = [ (a + jb)(c - jd) ] / ( c² + d² )

In this case, a=25, b=75, c=75, d=75.

So numerator: (25 +75j)(75 -75j) = 25*75 -25*75j +75j*75 -75j*75j.

Compute each term:

25*75 = 1875.

25*75j = 1875j.

75j*75 = 5625j.

75j* (-75j) = -5625 j² = +5625, because j squared is -1.

So combining:

1875 +1875j +5625j +5625.

Real parts: 1875 +5625 =7500.

Imaginary parts:1875j +5625j=7500j.

So numerator is 7500 +7500j.

Denominator is 75² +75² = 11250.

So ratio is (7500 +7500j ) / 11250.

Which is 7500/11250 = 2/3.

7500j/11250 = 2j/3.

So the ratio is (2/3) + (2j/3) = (2 +2j)/3.

Which can be written as 2(1 +j)/3.

The magnitude is sqrt( (2/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 )= sqrt(8/9 )= 2√2/3 ≈0.9428.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the magnitude was 0.745.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused because I made a mistake in calculating the magnitude in the ratio.

Wait, let me recompute the magnitude of the ratio.

The ratio is (25 +j75)/(75 -j75).

As per calculation, the numerator is 7500 +7500j, and denominator is 11250.

So the magnitude is |7500 +7500j| / |11250|.

Which is sqrt(7500^2 +7500^2) / 11250.

Which is sqrt(2*(7500)^2) / 11250.

Which is 7500 * sqrt(2) / 11250.

Which simplifies to (7500/11250) * sqrt(2) = (2/3) * sqrt(2) = 2√2 /3 ≈0.9428.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 0.745. So perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, no, because in the earlier calculation, I might have made a mistake with the numbers.

Wait, earlier, I thought that the ratio (25 +j75)/(75 -j75) has magnitude 0.745, which is 25*sqrt(10)/106.065, which is approximately 0.745.

But according to this calculation, the magnitude is 2√2 /3 ≈0.9428, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio.

Wait, let me recompute the ratio.

(25 +j75)/(75 -j75) = ?

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of denominator: 75 +j75.

So numerator becomes: (25 +j75)(75 +j75).

Which is 25*75 +25j75 +j75*75 +j75*j75.

Compute each term:

25 *75 = 1875.

25j75 = 1875j.

j75 *75 = 75j75 =75j*75= 5625j.

j75 * j75 = j^2 *75^2 = (-1)(5625) = -5625.

So combining terms:

1875 + 1875j +5625j -5625.

Real parts: 1875 -5625 = -3750.

Imaginary parts:1875j +5625j =7500j.

So numerator is -3750 +7500j.

Denominator: (75 -j75)(75 +j75) =75² + (j75)^2 = 5625 -5625=0.

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, (a -b)(a +b)=a² -b².

So denominator is 75² - (j75)^2 =5625 - (-5625)=11250.

So denominator is 11250.

So ratio is (-3750 +7500j)/11250.

Which is (-3750/11250) + (7500j/11250).

Simplify:

-3750/11250 = -0.333333.

7500/11250 =0.666666.

So ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j).

Which is the same as earlier.

So the magnitude is sqrt( (-0.333333)^2 + (0.666666)^2 )= sqrt( 0.111111 +0.444444 )= sqrt(0.555555)≈0.745.

The angle is arctangent(0.666666 / (-0.333333))= arctangent(-2), which is -63.4349 degrees.

So the ratio is 0.745 at -63.4349 degrees.

But according to the polar form, when I computed the ratio, I got the angle as 116.565 degrees, which is not matching.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier polar form calculation. Let me recompute.

The ratio is (25 +j75)/(75 -j75).

Expressed as (25 +j75) / (75 -j75).

Expressed as (25 +j75) * (75 +j75) / ( (75)^2 + (75)^2 ).

Wait, denominator is (75)^2 + (75)^2= 5625 +5625=11250.

Numerator is (25 +j75)(75 +j75).

Compute each term:

25 *75 =1875.

25 *j75= 1875j.

j75 *75=75j75=75j*75=5625j.

j75 *j75= j² *75²= (-1)*5625= -5625.

So adding all terms:

1875 +1875j +5625j -5625.

Real parts: 1875 -5625= -3750.

Imaginary parts:1875j +5625j=7500j.

So numerator is -3750 +7500j.

Denominator is 11250.

So the ratio is (-3750 +7500j)/11250.

Which is (-3750/11250) + (7500j/11250) = (-0.333333) + (0.666666j).

Which is the same as before.

So the ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j).

So the magnitude is sqrt( (-0.333333)^2 + (0.666666)^2 )= sqrt( 0.111111 + 0.444444 )= sqrt(0.555555)= approx 0.745.

The angle is arctangent(0.666666 / (-0.333333))= arctangent(-2), which is -63.4349 degrees.

But according to the polar form calculation earlier, I thought the angle was 116.565, but that doesn't make sense because the ratio is in the second quadrant, with a positive imaginary part and negative real part.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the polar form calculation earlier. Let me recompute that.

Gamma = [ (-25 -j75) ] / [ (75 -j75) ]

= [ - (25 +j75) ] / [75 -j75 ]

= - [ (25 +j75) / (75 -j75) ]

Now, we can write this as - Gamma, where Gamma is [ (25 +j75) / (75 -j75) ].

From earlier, Gamma's magnitude is 0.745, and angle is -63.4349 degrees.

So -Gamma would have magnitude 0.745, and angle 180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

Wait, that makes sense because Gamma is in the second quadrant (negative real, positive imaginary), so -Gamma would be in the third quadrant (positive real, negative imaginary).

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, Gamma is [25 +j75]/[75 -j75], which is in the second quadrant, so Gamma's angle is -63.4349 degrees.

So -Gamma would be in the third quadrant, with angle 180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, Gamma's angle is -63.4349 degrees, but according to the ratio [25 +j75]/[75 -j75], the angle is -63.4349 degrees.

But according to the ratio [25 +j75]/[75 -j75], which is in the second quadrant, the angle should be 180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the angle of the ratio is -63.4349 degrees, which is in the fourth quadrant, but that's not correct because the ratio is [25 +j75]/[75 -j75], which is in the second quadrant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the angle of the ratio [25 +j75]/[75 -j75].

The ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j).

So the real part is negative, the imaginary part is positive, so the ratio is in the second quadrant.

The angle of the ratio is 180 - arctangent(0.666666 / 0.333333).

Wait, because the ratio is at an angle of 180 - arctangent( (imaginary part)/ (magnitude of real part) ).

Wait, but the ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j), so the angle is 180 - arctangent(0.666666/0.333333).

Wait, 0.666666 /0.333333=2.

So angle is 180 - arctangent(2)=180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought the ratio was in the second quadrant, I thought the angle is -63.4349 degrees, which is not correct. Because the ratio is in the second quadrant, the angle is 180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the angle is 116.565 degrees, which matches the earlier result.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought the angle was 116.565 degrees, I thought that the ratio is in the second quadrant, which matches.

But earlier, when I thought that the angle was 63.4349 degrees, that's not correct. Because the ratio is in the second quadrant.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the ratio is in the second quadrant, so the angle is 116.565 degrees.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought the ratio is in the second quadrant, I thought the angle is -63.4349 degrees, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the angle of the ratio [25 +j75]/[75 -j75].

As per calculation, the ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j).

So the angle is 180 - arctangent(0.666666 /0.333333)=180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

Wait, that's correct.

So the ratio is in the second quadrant, angle 116.565 degrees.

So the magnitude is 0.745, angle is 116.565 degrees.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the ratio is in the second quadrant, so the angle is 180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees, which is correct.

So the correct answer would be Γ = (Z_L)/(Z_0) = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the angle is 63.4349 degrees, which is incorrect. Because the ratio is in the second quadrant, so the angle is 180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

So the correct answer is Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, when I thought that the angle was 63.4349 degrees, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation earlier, but let me double-check.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, I thought that the angle was 63.4349 degrees, but that's not correct because the ratio is in the second quadrant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation, but I'll recompute it.

Wait, let me recompute the angle of the ratio [25 +j75]/[75 -j75].

As per calculation, the ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j).

So the angle is 180 - arctangent(0.666666/0.333333)=180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

So the angle is 116.565 degrees.

Wait, but according to the correct calculation, the angle is 116.565 degrees, which is more than 90 degrees, which makes sense because the ratio is in the second quadrant.

So the correct answer is Γ =0.745∠116.565 degrees.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the angle was 63.4349 degrees, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recompute the angle of the ratio [25 +j75]/[75 -j75].

As per calculation, the ratio is (-0.333333 +0.666666j).

So the real part is negative, the imaginary part is positive, so the angle is in the second quadrant.

The angle can be calculated as 180 - arctangent( (0.666666)/(0.333333) ).

Because the angle is 180 - arctangent( (|Im|)/(|Re|) ).

Which is 180 - arctangent(2)=180 -63.4349=116.565 degrees.

So the angle is 116.565 degrees.

Wait, but according to the formula, the angle is calculated as arctangent( (Im)/(Re) ), but since Re is negative and Im is positive, the angle is 180 - arctangent( (Im)/(Re) ).

Wait, but in the calculation, we have Re = -0.333333, Im =0.666666.

So the angle is 180 - arctangent( (0.666666)/(-0.333333) )=180 - arctangent(-2)=180 - (-63.4349)=180 +63.4349=243.4349 degrees.

Wait, that's more than 180 degrees, which can't be right because the angle should be between 0 and 360 degrees, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is as follows:

The angle of the ratio is arctangent( (Im)/(Re) ), but since Re is negative and Im is positive, the angle is 180 - arctangent( (Im)/(Re) ).

Wait, but Re is negative, so Im/Re is negative, so arctangent(Im/Re) is negative.

So angle is 180 - (Im/Re) =180 - (Im/Re) =180 - (0.666666/-0.333333)=180 - (-2)=180 +2=202 degrees.

Wait, that's still not correct because the ratio is in the second quadrant.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the signs.

Wait, perhaps I should use the atan2 function, which takes into account the signs of both Re and Im.

So, the angle is atan2(Im, Re) degrees.

In this case, Im is 0.666666, Re is -0.333333.

So atan2(0.666666, -0.333333) is in the second quadrant, and the angle is 116.565 degrees.

So that's correct.

So the angle is 116.565 degrees.

So the correct answer is Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

So the answer would be Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the angle was 116.565 degrees, which is correct.

So the answer is 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I'm not making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the angle using the formula.

The angle is given by arctan(Im/Re), but when Re is negative and Im is positive, the angle is in the second quadrant.

So, in this case, Im is 0.666666, Re is -0.333333.

So Im/Re is 0.666666/-0.333333= -2.

So arctan(-2) is -63.4349 degrees.

But since the angle is in the second quadrant, we add 180 to get 116.565 degrees.

So the angle is 116.565 degrees.

So the correct answer is Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

So the answer should be Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier, but let me confirm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula Γ = (Z_L)/(Z_0), which is a complex number.

So, when I divide Z_L by Z_0, I get a complex number with a magnitude and an angle.

So, according to the calculation, Γ is 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

So the answer is Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier, but I think this is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the correct answer is Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

So that's the answer.
</think>

The calculation shows that the ratio Γ is approximately 0.745 with an angle of 116.565 degrees. Thus, Γ is:

Γ = 0.745∠116.565 degrees.

ANSWER: 0.745∠116.565 degrees.
