Question:

On May 19, a telephone operator for the local telephone company received a call in which a male voice said: "I want to report that the downtown sporting arena is going to be blown up tonight. " The caller then hung up. The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely

A: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.
B: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.
C: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was a simple mistake.
D: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in financial harm.
E: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.

H: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in public humiliation.
I: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made in the course of her employment.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a defamation case involving a telephone operator and a police officer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario starts with a man calling a local telephone operator saying the downtown sporting arena is going to be blown up. The line he's on is owned by a woman. He hangs up, then a police officer comes in, asks her to listen to a voice, and she does. The operator says she's positive it's from the person threatening the arena. But then, the operator's identification is found to be incorrect, leading to the woman's boyfriend being exonerated. Now, the question is about whether the boyfriend's defamation action against the telephone operator will succeed.

The options are A to I, each offering a different reason why the action might fail or succeed. I need to figure out which reason is correct.

First, I should recall the rules of defamation law, especially regarding the operator's erroneous identification. Defamation requires that the harm caused must be intentional and that the harm must be done for the good of the community.

The operator's statement was an error, which could mean several things. One thing to consider is whether the error was a qualified privilege. QP is a privilege that allows certain statements to be used without the need for the defendant's consent. The operator's identification was made in her employment, which might be a key point.

Looking at the options:

A: Not succeed because the operator's identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest. I think QP is a privilege, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for the public interest. Also, the operator's mistake might be considered a mistake rather than a privilege. So A might not be correct.

B: Not succeed because the operator's error was made without actual malice. Actual malice is about the operator's intent to fabricate the statement. The question doesn't mention anything about intent, so I don't think this is the reasonâ€”defamation requires actual malice for some elements.

C: Not succeed because the operator's error was a simple mistake. A simple mistake might not qualify as a qualified privilege. Also, QP requires more than just a mistake; it's about the nature of the statement and the purpose behind it.

D: Succeed because the error caused financial harm. Well, financial harm is a common ground in defamation, but the issue is whether the harm was intentional and caused for the good of the community. If the harm was accidental or not intentional, it might not succeed.

E: Succeed because the error was slander. Slander typically involves an intentional harm to the public interest. The operator's mistake could be considered slander if it's a deliberate attempt to harm the community. However, the operator's mistake might not be malicious, so it's not slander.

F: Succeed because of loss of reputation. This is a strong point. If the operator's statement caused harm that led to the boyfriend's reputation being damaged, it could succeed. The mistake could have been intentional or accidental, but the loss of reputation is a clear indicator of defamation.

G: Because of reckless disregard. If the operator disregarded truthfulness, that's a different issue. It's more about whether the operator knew the truth, not whether they were reckless. So G might not apply here.

H: Because of public humiliation. Similar to F, it's about reputation damage. If the error caused embarrassment and ridicule, it's a likely defamation case.

I: Not succeed because the error was in her job. This is about whether the operator's mistake was intentional or accidental. If it was in her employment, it might be a mistake, but the question is whether it caused harm for the good of the community.

Now, applying the four-factor test: intent, harm, purpose, and result.

In this case, the operator's mistake caused harm. The harm was intentional because the operator's mistake was made with the intent to cause harm. The harm was done for the good of the community because the operator's statement could have hurt the girlfriend's reputation and led to the man's husband's ex-felony charge. 

Wait, but the operator's mistake was a mistake, not a QP. So is it slander? Slander requires that the harm is intentional and for the good of the community. If the operator's mistake was accidental, then it might not be slander, but if it was intentional, then it could be slander.

But the question is about whether the error was a simple mistake. Simple mistake would imply it was a factual error without intent. If the operator's mistake was made without intent, it wouldn't be slander.

However, the question is about whether the error constitutes a QP. If the operator's mistake was made in the course of her employment, perhaps that's considered a mistake, but whether it's a QP depends on the nature of the statement.

The operator's statement was an error in identifying the person. If the error was made in the course of her employment, that might not qualify as a QP. QP is generally for statements made for the public interest or for specific purposes. So the error here might not be a QP, but it's a mistake.

But then, the error led to the woman's boyfriend being charged. The error itself was a mistake, not a QP. So the operator's statement wasn't protected by QP, which is a privilege. So the error isn't a QP, so the operator's statement isn't protected, meaning the boyfriend's action might succeed.

Wait, but the options are asking whether the action will succeed. So the key is whether the operator's error was a QP. If it was, then the error wouldn't succeed; otherwise, it might.

In this case, the error was made in her employment, but the reason for the error might not be the public interest. So perhaps it's a simple mistake. If that's the case, then option C (not succeed because it's a simple mistake) might be correct.

Wait, but option F says the error caused loss of good reputation, which is a strong indicator. So perhaps the error isn't a simple mistake but a deliberate one, which would be slander. But the question is about the operator's identification being erroneous, not whether it was deliberate.

Another angle: the operator's identification was an error. If it's a QP, then she wouldn't be able to sue for slander. But if it's a mistake, then she might be able to.

But I'm not sure if the error was made for the public interest. If the operator's identification was made in her job, perhaps it's not a QP. So the error wouldn't be protected, meaning the operator's statement isn't a QP, so the woman's boyfriend can sue.

Wait, but the question is about whether the operator's error (the identification) is a QP. If the error was made for the public interest, then it's a QP, so the woman's boyfriend can't sue. But if the error was made without the purpose to protect the public, then it's not a QP, so the woman's boyfriend could succeed.

So the key is whether the error was made in the public interest. The scenario doesn't specify that the woman owned a line in the city or anything like that. It's just a local telephone company. So the error was made in her employment, but it's not necessarily protected by QP.

If the error was made without the intent to protect the public, then it's slander, so option E (slander) or F (loss of reputation) would apply. But the woman's boyfriend's action is about slander, so if the operator's statement was slanderous, the boyfriend could succeed.

Wait, but the operator's statement is an errorâ€”so if the error was intentional, it's slander. If it's accidental, it's not. But the question is whether the error was made with the intent to cause harm. I think the operator's identification may have been made with the intent to cause harm, so it's slander.

Alternatively, if the error was made without intent, then the operator's statement wouldn't be slanderous.

But the question says the operator is a telephone operator, and the statement was an error made in her job. So perhaps the operator's mistake wasn't intentional. If the operator didn't intend to make the statement, then it's not slander.

However, the problem is that the operator's identification was made with the intent to slander, which is a common ground. So the boyfriend's action would be successful.

Looking at the options, option F says the error caused loss of good reputation. That's a strong indicator. So the action would succeed.

But wait, another point: The operator's identification was made in the course of her employment. But whether that's sufficient to qualify as slander depends on the purpose. If the purpose was to slander, then it's slanderous. If the purpose was to cause a mistake, then it's a mistake.

But the question is about whether the error was a QP. If the error was made in the course of her employment, perhaps it's not a QP. But the operator's statement was made with the intent to slander, which is a known ground.

Alternatively, the woman's boyfriend's action is about slander, so he can sue. But the options don't have an option that says the error was a simple mistake. So I need to think about the QP.

QP applies when the statement is made for the public interest or for a specific purpose. If the operator's statement was made for the public interest, then the QP protection doesn't apply. Otherwise, it's not a QP. But the question doesn't state that the operator's statement was made for the public interest.

So the error was made in her job, but it's not necessarily a QP. Therefore, the operator's statement wasn't a QP, so the woman's boyfriend could successfully sue for slander, leading to her ex-felony charge. So the action would succeed.

Looking at the options:

Option F is about loss of reputation. That's a strong ground. So the boyfriend's action would succeed.

But wait, the question is about the error being a simple mistake. If the error was made without the intent to slander, it's not slander. But if it was made with the intent to slander, it's slander.

I think the key is whether the error was made with the intent to cause harm. If the operator intended to slander, then it's slanderous. But the question doesn't state that the operator intended itâ€”she just made the statement. So the operator's statement is an error, but whether it was made with intent.

If the operator's mistake was a simple mistake (without intent), then it's not slander. However, if it was made with the intent to cause harm, then it's slander.

But the question is about the error in the operator's identification. The error itself was made in her job, but the operator's mistake could be intentional or accidental. The question doesn't say that the operator knew the truth, so she might have made an accidental mistake.

If it's accidental, the operator's statement isn't slanderous. But the option F is about loss of reputation, which is a known ground.

But the problem is, the question is about whether the error would be a simple mistake. If the error was made without intent, it's a mistake. If made with intent, it's slander. But without knowing the intent, we can't say.

Wait, the options don't have an option that says that the error was a simple mistake. So perhaps the key is whether it's a QP. If it's a simple mistake, it's not a QP. So the operator's statement isn't protected by QP, so the boyfriend could be successful.

Looking at the options, option F says the error caused loss of reputation. That's a clear indicator. So if the error caused harm, it's likely slander. So the boyfriend can sue.

But I'm a bit confused because the woman's boyfriend was charged, but the operator's statement is an error. If the error was made without the intent, then it's not slander. But I think the correct reasoning is that the error was made with the intent to cause harm, so it's slander, leading to the boyfriend's ex-felony charge.

Another point: The woman's boyfriend was charged because the operator's statement was made, but if the operator's statement was an error, then the statement is not true. So the woman's boyfriend's case is about slander, not defamation. So the boyfriend can use slander as a defense.

So the correct answer is F: succeed because the operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.

The question revolves around whether the telephone operator's erroneous identification of the person threatening the downtown sporting arena would succeed in a defamation action. The key points to consider are whether the error was intentional, whether it was a qualified privilege (QP), and whether it was a simple mistake.

1. **QP vs. Simple Mistake**: The error was made in the operator's employment, but whether it qualifies as a QP (qualified privilege) depends on the nature of the statement and the purpose. Since the scenario does not specify that the operator's statement was made for the public interest or a specific purpose, it is not a QP. Therefore, the error is likely a simple mistake.

2. **Slander vs. Loss of Reputation**: The error could be considered slander if it was made with the intent to cause harm. The operator's statement was an error in identifying the threat, which could have led to embarrassment and ridicule. The loss of good reputation is a strong ground for slander, making the boyfriend's action likely successful.

3. **Defamation and slander**: Defamation requires intentional harm for the good of the community. The error in identifying the threat could have caused harm, particularly if it led to the woman's boyfriend being charged. The loss of reputation is a clear indicator of slander.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. QP is not applicable here because the statement was made without intent to protect the public interest.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The error was not made without actual malice; the question does not provide evidence of malicious intent.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The error was not necessarily a simple mistake; it could have been intentional.
   - **D**: Incorrect. Financial harm alone does not suffice for slander.
   - **E**: Incorrect. slander requires intentional harm for the good of the community, not just financial harm.
   - **F**: Correct. The loss of reputation is a strong ground for slander, which the boyfriend's action would succeed in.
   - **G**: Incorrect. reckless disregard for the truth is not relevant here.
   - **H**: Incorrect. Public humiliation is not the primary ground for slander in this context.
   - **I**: Incorrect. The error was not made in the course of her employment in a way that constitutes a mistake.
   - **J**: Incorrect. The options provided do not include "slander," so F is the closest fit.

The best answer is **F**, as the error caused the loss of reputation, which is a strong ground for slander in this case.
