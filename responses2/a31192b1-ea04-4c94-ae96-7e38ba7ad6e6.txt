Okay, so I've got this question about whether the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution is log-concave. Hmm, I remember that a function is log-concave if the logarithm of the function is a concave function. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, log-concave functions satisfy the inequality f(x)^2 ≥ f(x1)f(x2) when x is the average of x1 and x2. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, I think it's that the logarithm of the function is concave. So, if log f is concave, then f is log-concave.

The CDF of the standard normal is given by F(x) = 1/√(2π) ∫_{-∞}^x e^{-t²/2} dt. The question is whether this F(x) is log-concave.

I remember that for certain distributions, their log-concave properties can be determined. The standard normal distribution is a classic example. Wait, what's the log-concave property for the normal distribution? Oh right, I think the log-concave is a property of the density function, not the CDF itself. Because the CDF is the integral of the density.

Wait, so the CDF F(x) is the integral of the standard normal density from -infinity to x. So, F(x) is a monotonically increasing function, as it's the integral of a positive function.

So, the question is, is F(x) log-concave? What's the definition again? A function g is log-concave if log(g) is concave. Alternatively, another definition is that for any x1 < x2 < x3, g(x2)^2 ≥ g(x1)g(x3). But I think the first definition is more precise.

So, I need to determine whether F(x) is log-concave. I think that the standard normal distribution's CDF is log-concave. Because the normal distribution itself is log-concave. Wait, the density function of the normal distribution is f(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}, right? And log-concave functions are closed under multiplication, but in this case, the density function is the product of a constant and e^{-x²/2}. So, since e^{-x²/2} is a log-concave function, because its logarithm is -x²/2 which is a concave function. So since e^{-x²/2} is log-concave, and the constant factor doesn't affect log-concavity, the density is log-concave.

But wait, the question is about the CDF. So, is F(x) log-concave? Hmm. I'm not so sure. Because F(x) is an integral of a log-concave function. Does the integral of a log-concave function preserve log-concavity? I don't think so. I remember that the log-concave property isn't preserved under integration in general. For example, the standard normal CDF isn't log-concave. So, I need to check whether F(x) is log-concave.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the properties of F(x). Since F(x) is the integral of a log-concave function, but integrating a log-concave function doesn't necessarily result in a log-concave function. For example, integrating e^{-x²} (which is log-concave) gives the error function, which is not log-concave. So, perhaps the CDF of the normal distribution isn't log-concave.

Alternatively, I remember that log-concave functions have the property that their integrals are log-concave. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, if f is log-concave, then its integral (up to x) is also log-concave? Or is it the other way around? Because I think that if the density is log-concave, then the CDF is log-concave. Wait, wait no, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the definition again. A function g is log-concave if log(g(x)) is concave. So, for F(x), log(F(x)) must be concave. But is that true?

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the CDF of the normal distribution is log-concave. I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Because I think that the normal distribution's density is log-concave, but the CDF is not necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps the CDF is log-concave, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember that the CDF of the normal distribution is not log-concave. Because the log of the normal CDF would not be concave. So, the answer would be no, it's not log-concave, so the answer is 0.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose F(x) is the CDF. The log of F(x) would be log( ∫_{-∞}^x e^{-t²/2} dt ). Is this function concave? Let's consider x1 < x2. Let me check for the concavity of log(F(x)).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the definition. For any x1 < x2 < x3, does 2 log F(x2) ≥ log F(x1) + log F(x3)?

But without knowing the exact properties, it's tricky. Alternatively, I think that the standard normal CDF is not log-concave. Because, for example, consider the integral of e^{-t²/2} from -∞ to x. If I take x1 = -a, x2 = 0, x3 = a for some a >0. Then, F(x1) = F(-a), F(x2) = 0.5, F(x3) = F(a). So, 2 log F(x2) = log 0.5 + log 0.5 = log(0.25). On the other hand, log F(x1) + log F(x3) = log F(-a) + log F(a). Since F is symmetric, F(-a) = F(a), so this is 2 log F(a). So, 2 log F(x2) = log(0.25) while log F(x1) + log F(x3) = 2 log F(a).

So, if 2 log F(x2) ≥ log F(x1) + log F(x3), then log F(x2) ≥ log F(x1) + log F(x3) / 2. That would require log F(a) ≤ 0.25 log F(a) ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because F(a) is less than 1, so log F(a) is negative. So, 0.25 log F(a) is even more negative. So, for example, if F(a) is 0.5, then log F(a) is -ln(2) ≈ -0.693. So 0.25 * (-0.693) ≈ -0.173. But 2 log F(x2) = 2 * log 0.5 = -1. So, -1 ≥ -0.173? No, that's not true. So, the inequality 2 log F(x2) ≥ log F(x1) + log F(x3) is not satisfied, which would mean that log F(x) is not concave. Because the function F(x) is concave in log? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this the other way.

Wait, the definition of log-concave is that for any x1 < x2 <x3, 2 log f(x2) ≥ log f(x1) + log f(x3). So, in the example I considered, x1 = -a, x2 =0, x3 =a. So, 2 log F(0) = log 0.5 + log 0.5 = -1. And log F(-a) + log F(a) = 2 log F(a). Suppose F(a) is 0.7. Then 2 log F(a) would be 2 ln(0.7) ≈ 2*(-0.3567) ≈ -0.713. But 2 log F(0) is -1, which is less than -0.713. So 2 log F(0) < log F(-a) + log F(a). That violates the log-concave condition. Hence, F(x) is not log-concave.

So, the answer would be 0, meaning no, the CDF is not log-concave.

Wait, but I thought I heard that the CDF of the normal distribution is log-concave. Oh wait, no, perhaps I was confusing it with the normal distribution's density. Wait, the normal density is f(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}, which is log-concave. But the CDF, as we saw, is not log-concave. So, the answer is no, it's not log-concave. So, the answer would be 0, meaning 0 points for yes/no.

The question asks whether the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution is log-concave. 

To determine this, we analyze the properties of the CDF, F(x) = 1/√(2π) ∫_{-∞}^x e^{-t²/2} dt. A function is log-concave if its logarithm is concave. The CDF is the integral of the standard normal density, which is log-concave. However, integrating a log-concave function does not necessarily preserve log-concavity. 

By considering specific points and applying the definition of log-concavity, it was found that the condition 2 log F(x2) ≥ log F(x1) + log F(x3) is not satisfied for the CDF. Therefore, the CDF of the standard normal distribution is not log-concave.
