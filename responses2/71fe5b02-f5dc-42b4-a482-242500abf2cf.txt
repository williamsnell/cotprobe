Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it again.

The question is about solder, which is a lead-tin alloy. They treated 1.00 gram of this alloy with warm 30% HNO3 and got a lead nitrate solution and some insoluble white residue. After drying, the residue weighed 0.600 grams and was SnO2. I need to find the percentage of tin in the sample. The options are A through J.

Hmm, right. So the reaction given is Sn + 4HNO3 + SnO2 + 4N2 + 2H2O. I remember that this reaction is the oxidation of tin in the alloy to form SnO2. So the HNO3 is acting as an oxidizing agent here.

Let me think about what's happening. The alloy has both lead and tin. When treated with HNO3, the tin in the alloy reacts, and the lead remains as is. The product is lead nitrate (so Pb(NO3)2) and the white residue is SnO2.

I think the first step is to find out how much tin was in the alloy. Because the precipitate is SnO2, which is derived from the tin in the alloy. So if I can find the amount of tin in the precipitate, I can then find the percentage in the original sample.

The mass of the precipitate is 0.600 grams of SnO2. Let me calculate the moles of SnO2 there. The molar mass of SnO2 is (118.71) + (32.00) = 150.71 g/mol. Wait, 118.71 for Sn and 32 for O2.

Wait, 1 Sn has an atomic weight of about 118.71 g/mol. O is 16, so O2 is 32. So yes, 118.71 +32 = 150.71 g/mol.

So moles of SnO2 = mass / molar mass = 0.600 g / 150.71 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.6 divided by 150.71. Well, 0.6 /150 is approximately 0.003999 (since 150 is 0.00666667 mol for 1g, so 0.6g is 0.003999...mol). Let's be more precise. Let me compute 0.6 ÷ 150.71.

Hmm, 150.71 * 0.00399 equals about 0.6. So about 0.00399 mol SnO2.

But wait, each SnO2 has one Sn atom. So moles of Sn is also 0.00399 mol.

Sn (atomic weight ~118.71) → moles = 0.00399.

Now, to find the mass of Sn in the precipitate: moles * atomic weight. So 0.00399 mol * 118.71 g/mol = let's compute that.

0.00399 * 118.71. Let me do that step by step. 0.00399 * 100 = 0.399; 0.00399 * 18.71 is about 0.0751. So total is approximately 0.4741 grams.

Wait, that's about 0.474 grams of Sn in the precipitate. Then, since the precipitate comes from the tin in the alloy, the total alloy mass is 1.00g. So the percentage of tin in the alloy is (0.474 /1.00) * 100% = 47.4%.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options, option F is 47.2%, which is very close. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Wait, the precipitate is SnO2 with a mass of 0.6g. So moles of SnO2 is 0.6 / 150.71 ≈ 0.003987 mol. Multiply by 118.71 g/mol gives 0.003987 * 118.71 ≈ 0.474 grams Sn.

But wait, the problem mentions that the sample was treated with 30% HNO3. So perhaps the stoichiometry is different. Let me double-check the reaction.

The reaction is: Sn + 4HNO3 → Sn^2+ (aq) + 2NO2↑ + 2H2O + 2NO.

Wait, but the given reaction is Sn +4HNO3 + SnO2 +4N2 +2H2O. So the equation is balanced as is, which is correct.

So in the reaction, 1 mole of Sn reacts with 4 moles of HNO3. So the amount of HNO3 used is 4 moles of HNO3 per mole Sn.

But the question doesn't give the concentration of HNO3, but tells us that it's warm enough to oxidize the tin. So the amount of HNO3 is probably in excess, but we don't need to consider all of it because the problem only asks for the tin content.

So the calculation is correct. The precipitate's mass is 0.6g, so Sn is 0.474g. So tin percentage is (0.474 /1.00) *100% = 47.4%. The closest option is F, which is 47.2%. So the answer should be F.

The problem involves determining the percentage of tin in a lead-tin alloy sample. The alloy, containing 1.00 g of a mixture of lead (Pb) and tin (Sn), was treated with 30% HNO₃, resulting in a precipitate of 0.600 g of SnO₂. The reaction is:

\[
\text{Sn} + 4\text{HNO}_3 + \text{SnO}_2 + 4\text{N}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass of SnO₂**: The precipitate formed is 0.600 g of SnO₂. The molar mass of SnO₂ is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of SnO}_2 = 118.71 \, (\text{Sn}) + 32.00 \, (\text{O}_2) = 150.71 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of SnO₂**: Using the mass of SnO₂ and its molar mass:
   \[
   \text{Moles of SnO}_2 = \frac{0.600 \, \text{g}}{150.71 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.003987 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of Sn**: Since each SnO₂ molecule contains one Sn atom:
   \[
   \text{Moles of Sn} = 0.003987 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Mass of Sn in SnO₂**: The atomic weight of Sn is approximately 118.71 g/mol. Thus:
   \[
   \text{Mass of Sn} = 0.003987 \, \text{mol} \times 118.71 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 0.474 \, \text{g}.
   \]

5. **Percentage of Sn in the alloy**: The alloy's total mass is 1.00 g, and the mass of Sn is 0.474 g. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Sn} = \left( \frac{0.474 \, \text{g}}{1.00 \, \text{g}} \right) \times 100\% \approx 47.4\%.
   \]

6. **Closest Option**: Among the given options, the closest value to 47.4% is **47.2%**.
