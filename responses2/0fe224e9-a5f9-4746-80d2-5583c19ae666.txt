Okay, so I need to figure out which primates humans descend from. Hmm, let me think. I remember that humans are related to several apes, but I'm a bit confused about the exact ones. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A is bonobos. I think bonobos are a type of monkey, but I'm not sure if they're on the same evolutionary path as humans. I recall that bonobos are closely related to apes and maybe even share some evolutionary links with humans. But I'm not certain if humans descended from them.

Option B is orangutans. Wait, I know that orangutans are primates, but I don't think they're the ones from which humans come. Humans are more closely related to apes, like elephants and placexanthines, not the orangutans.

Option C is gibbons. Oh, wait, I'm pretty sure that gibbons are a group of primates that includes gorillas. But wait, humans are not directly descended from gibbons. They're more closely related to apes than to gibbons. So maybe gibbons are not the right answer.

Option D is chimpanzees. I remember that chimpanzees are a large group, including gorillas and primates. But again, humans are not directly from chimpanzees. They're more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees.

Option E is baboons. No, baboons are a different group altogether. They're part of the baboon order, which is a class of primates, but not the ones humans descended from.

Option F is gorillas. Oh, right! Humans and gorillas share a close evolutionary relationship. Humans are a close relative of gorillas. So this seems like a strong contender.

Option G is capuchin monkeys. Those are another group of apes, but I don't think they're the ones from which humans descended. They're more closely related to other primates, like bonobos.

Option H is lemurs. I remember that lemurs are a group of primates, but again, humans are not directly descended from lemurs. They're more closely related to others.

Option I is tarsiers. Those are another type of primate, but not the direct ones from which humans come.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be F: gorillas. Because humans and gorillas are closely related, and they're a group of apes. The other options are either not directly related or belong to different groups.

The correct answer is F: gorillas. Humans and gorillas are closely related, making them the correct option.
