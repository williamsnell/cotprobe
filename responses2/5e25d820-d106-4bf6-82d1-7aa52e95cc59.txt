Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about GDP and I need to figure out which option is classified under C. Hmm, let's start by recalling what GDP is. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period of time.

The question is asking which of these options falls under category C when calculating GDP. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down.

First, I need to remember the typical categories of GDP. Usually, GDP is divided into consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. So, each option should be categorized under one of these.

Let's look at each option:

A: The purchase of a new car by a car rental company. Wait, the rental company is the buyer. But in GDP terms, this would be counted as consumption because the car is the consumer's purchase. So this is probably under consumption.

B: The purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company. Again, it's a purchase by a company of a new item. Since the crane is a construction tool, it's likely a consumption item. So this would be consumption.

C: A company buying a new office building. This is a purchase by a business of a new structure. That's definitely investment. Because investment in GDP refers to businesses buying property to expand, not the consumption by the existing customers.

D: A homeowner mowing her own lawn. That's a service done by someone else. Wait, mowing your own lawn is a service that could be counted as consumptionâ€”because it's a service provided by another person. But I'm not sure if it's counted as consumption or just not part of the GDP. Alternatively, it might be part of consumption because it's a service provided by a person, which is a consumer. Or perhaps it's an endogenous service, and thus not directly counted as part of GDP. Or maybe it's not counted at all.

E: Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts. Flour is a raw material used in production. In GDP, the value of inputs (like flour) is subtracted from the value of outputs (like donuts). So the flour's value is not part of the final goods and services counted in GDP. So this would fall under investment or government spending. Wait, no, the question is about which category is under C. So flour is an intermediate good, so it's not part of consumption but part of investment or government spending.

Wait, let me think again. Intermediate goods are used in the production of other goods, so their value is not included in GDP. Therefore, E's purchase of flour wouldn't be counted in GDP. So E is not under C.

F: Purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm. This is a purchase by a business (accounting firm) of software. So as a business purchase, it's investment. So this would be under investment, not C.

G: $50 spent eating out at a restaurant. This is a consumer spending on a meal. So this is consumption.

H: A barber cutting his own hair. This is a service provided by the barber. Since it's a service that's provided to a customer, but it's not a purchase by a business. So does this fall under investment? Or is it considered a service that's not counted in GDP? Wait, services are counted in GDP. So the barber's work is a service, so it's part of investment? Or is it a service that's part of consumption? Wait, when the barber cuts his own hair, he's not buying any new goods; he's just providing a service. So, in GDP terms, this would be counted as consumption because the service is provided to the customer. Or wait, maybe not. Because the haircut is a service, but the barber is the producer. So in the context of GDP, this would be considered as part of investment because it's a business activity that produces services, but the haircut is a service that's provided to the customer. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the haircut is an endogenous service. So, it's not a purchase by a business, but a service provided by a consumer. So perhaps it's not counted in GDP. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's counted as investment because it's what a business does to produce a service. But I think that in GDP, services are counted as consumption. So when the barber cuts his own hair, he's using his own labor to produce a service. So the haircut's value is part of consumption. So this would be consumption.

Wait, but the question is about which is under C, and the options are A to H. Let's recap.

The options are labeled A to H, and the question is which is under C.

Earlier analysis: A is consumption, B is consumption, C is investment, D is consumption, E is investment, F is investment, G is consumption, H is not counted in GDP.

Wait, but H is a service that the barber provides, but it's a service he does not buy. So he isn't buying anything new. So if the haircut is a service he provides, but he doesn't buy any new goods, so it's not an investment. It's not a purchase by a business. So in GDP terms, this isn't counted. But wait, sometimes services are considered part of consumption. So if the haircut is a service that the barber provides, and he's not buying anything, but he's doing it, then perhaps it's considered as part of consumption, as it's a service provided by the consumer. Hmm. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: think about what each option represents in terms of categories.

C is investment.

So which option is investment?

C: Company buying a new office building. That's investment. Because the company is buying property to expand, so it's an investment in capital goods.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Looking back at the options, the answer is C.

To determine which option is classified under C when calculating GDP, we need to categorize each option into consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports.

- **A: The purchase of a new car by a car rental company**  
  This is a consumption item because the car is a consumer's purchase.

- **B: The purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company**  
  This is also a consumption item as the crane is a consumer's purchase.

- **C: A company buying a new office building**  
  This is an investment item because the company is purchasing capital goods to expand its operations.

- **D: A homeowner mowing her own lawn**  
  This is a consumption item as it is a service provided by another person.

- **E: Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts**  
  This is an investment item because it is an intermediate good used in production.

- **F: The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm**  
  This is an investment item as it is purchased by a business.

- **G: $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant**  
  This is a consumption item as it is a consumer spending.

- **H: A barber cutting his own hair**  
  This is not counted in GDP because it is a service provided by a consumer, not a purchase by a business. However, it might be considered as consumption if the barber is a business owner, but it's not a purchase.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **C: A company buying a new office building**, as it falls under the investment category.

**Answer: C**
