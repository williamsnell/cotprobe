Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for three random variables X, Y, and Z. The joint density function is given as f(x, y, z) = e^-(x+y+z) for x, y, z all greater than 0. 

First, I remember that the CDF F(x, y, z) is the probability that X ≤ x, Y ≤ y, and Z ≤ z. So, F(x, y, z) = P(X ≤ x, Y ≤ y, Z ≤ z). 

Since the joint density function is given, I can compute the CDF by integrating the joint density over the region where X ≤ x, Y ≤ y, and Z ≤ z. But wait, I need to be careful because the integration might not just be straightforward. 

Let me think about the limits of integration. Since all variables are positive, the integration limits will be from 0 to x for X, 0 to y for Y, and 0 to z for Z. But wait, the joint density is only defined for x, y, z > 0. So, if any of x, y, z is negative, the probability is zero.

So, the CDF is the triple integral of f(x, y, z) over the region where 0 ≤ x' ≤ x, 0 ≤ y' ≤ y, 0 ≤ z' ≤ z. So, mathematically, F(x, y, z) = ∫ (from 0 to x) ∫ (from 0 to y) ∫ (from 0 to z) e^-(x' + y' + z') dx' dy' dz'.

I can compute this integral step by step. Let's first compute the innermost integral with respect to x'. So the integral from 0 to x of e^-(x' + y + z') dx' is e^(-y - z') times the integral of e^(-x') dx' from 0 to x. The integral of e^(-x') dx' is -e^(-x') + 1. So evaluating from 0 to x gives [ -e^(-x) + 1 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly. The innermost integral is ∫ (from 0 to x) e^-(x' + y + z') dx'. Let's factor out e^(-y - z') since it's a constant with respect to x'. So we have e^(-y - z') ∫ (from 0 to x) e^(-x') dx'. The integral of e^(-x') is -e^(-x') evaluated from 0 to x. So that becomes -e^(-x) + 1, which is 1 - e^(-x). 

So the integral becomes (1 - e^(-x)) * e^(-y - z').

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the integral over x' is e^(-y - z') times the integral from 0 to x of e^(-x') dx'. Which is e^(-y - z') * [ -e^(-x') ] from 0 to x. That is e^(-y - z') [ -e^(-x) + 1 ] = (1 - e^(-x)) e^(-y - z').

Then, we move to the next integral, which is integrating this expression with respect to y' from 0 to y. So, we have ∫ (from 0 to y) (1 - e^(-x)) e^(-y' - z') dy'. 

Again, (1 - e^(-x)) is a constant with respect to y', so that's (1 - e^(-x)) ∫ (from 0 to y) e^(-y' - z') dy'. Let's factor out e^(-z') because it's a constant with respect to y'. So that becomes (1 - e^(-x)) e^(-z') ∫ (from 0 to y) e^(-y') dy'.

The integral of e^(-y') is -e^(-y') from 0 to y, which is -e^(-y) + 1 = 1 - e^(-y).

Putting it all together, the integral is (1 - e^(-x)) e^(-z') * (1 - e^(-y)) evaluated from 0 to z'. Wait, wait, no, because z' is the integration variable, so we have to re-express it. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the triple integral as the product of three separate exponentials because the joint density is a product of exponentials in each variable, which suggests that the joint distribution is separable. 

In other words, since f(x, y, z) = e^(-x) e^(-y) e^(-z), which can be written as the product of three functions each depending on only one variable. So, the joint density is separable, so the CDF can be written as the product of the marginal CDFs for each variable.

The marginal CDF for X is P(X ≤ x) = ∫ (from 0 to x) e^(-x') dx' = 1 - e^(-x). Similarly for Y and Z.

So, the joint CDF F(x, y, z) is the product of the marginal CDFs: [1 - e^(-x)] * [1 - e^(-y)] * [1 - e^(-z)].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that: (1 - e^-x) / (1 - e^-y) / (1 - e^-z) for x, y, z > 0. Wait, no, the denominator doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, each term is (1 - e^-var), so the product is (1 - e^-x)(1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z), which is option F.

Wait wait, let me check the options again. Option F is (1 - e^-x)(1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z) for x, y, z > 0.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be F. 

Wait, but another thought: the joint density is e^-(x+y+z), which is the product of individual exponentials, so the variables are independent. Therefore, the CDF is just the product of the individual CDFs. So each CDF is 1 - e^(-x), etc.

But wait, I'm a little confused because when the joint density is separable, the CDF is the product of the marginals. So as per the variables, each being independent, the CDF is the product of the individual probabilities. So the answer should be F.

Alternatively, perhaps the options I read have option B as e^(-x y z), which would be the joint PDF if it were independent, but that's not the case here. Because the given joint PDF is e^-(x+y+z), which factors into the product of e^-x e^-y e^-z, so the variables are independent. So the marginal CDF for each is 1 - e^(-x), etc.

So the correct F is F = (1 - e^-x)(1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z). So option F.
</think>

The joint density function of the random variables \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) is given as \(f(x, y, z) = e^{-(x+y+z)}\) for \(x, y, z > 0\). To find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) \(F(x, y, z)\), we compute the probability that \(X \leq x\), \(Y \leq y\), and \(Z \leq z\). Since the joint density is separable, the CDF is the product of the marginal CDFs for each variable.

The marginal CDF for each variable is:
\[
P(X \leq x) = P(Y \leq y) = P(Z \leq z) = \int_{0}^{x} e^{-t} dt = 1 - e^{-x}.
\]

Thus, the joint CDF is:
\[
F(x, y, z) = (1 - e^{-x})(1 - e^{-y})(1 - e^{-z}).
\]

This matches option F.
