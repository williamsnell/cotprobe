Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of dinitrogen tetroxide, N₂O₄, into NO₂. The reaction is N₂O₄ ⇌ 2 NO₂. The question is about determining the percentage decomposition when the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. Hmm, wait, let me read that again.

Wait, the setup says: At 273 K and 1 atm, 1 liter of N₂O₄ decomposes into NO₂. The problem is, when the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. Oh wait, I think I might have misread that part. Let me check the question again.

Oh wait, the question is about decomposition, but wait, the initial state is 1 liter of N₂O₄. But when the volume is 25% less than the existing volume. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, perhaps it's that the original volume (the unreacted N₂O₄) is 25% less than the existing volume after decomposition. Or wait, is it that the original volume is 25% less than the total volume after decomposition?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles. Let me try to rephrase the problem.

The reaction is N₂O₄ (g) ⇌ 2 NO₂ (g). Let's say initially, I have 1 liter of N₂O₄ gas. Let's denote the initial amount as 1 mole, but wait, wait, wait, no, the problem says the original volume is 1 liter. Wait, no, perhaps the original volume of N₂O₄ is 1 liter, but when it decomposes, the volume decreases. Or, perhaps the existing volume after decomposition is 25% more than the original?

Wait, the question says, "the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume." So the original (unreacted) volume is 25% less than the existing (reacted) volume. Let me think about that.

Wait, maybe I got that reversed. Let me restate it: The original volume (before any decomposition) is 25% less than the existing volume (after decomposition). So, V_original = 0.75 * V_existent. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the problem says: "the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume."

So, the original volume (unreacted) is 25% less than the existing (reacted) volume. So, V_original = V_existent - 0.25 * V_existent → V_original = 0.75 * V_existent.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me parse that. The wording is: "the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume." So, original volume (before reaction) is 25% less than the existing (after reaction). So, original = (100 -25)% * existing → original = 0.75 * existing.

Wait, but this would mean that the existing volume (reacted) is larger than the original. That seems a bit counterintuitive because when a substance decomposes, you would expect the total volume to increase. Wait, but in this case, perhaps the initial volume is the unreacted N₂O₄, and the existing volume is the total after decomposition. So, V_unreacted = 25% less than V_total. So, V_unreacted = 0.75 * V_total.

Wait, but that would mean that when N₂O₄ decomposes, the total volume increases because more gas is present (since N₂O₄ breaks down into NO₂). So, when the unreacted volume is 25% less than the total, that makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial volume of N₂O₄ is 1 liter, but after decomposition, the remaining N₂O₄ (unreacted) is 25% less than the total. So, for example, if the total is 1 liter, then unreacted is 0.75 liters. But wait, that's not the way the problem is phrased. Let me read carefully.

Question says: "the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume". So, let's clarify: in the initial state, before any reaction, the volume is 25% less than the volume after reaction. So, if after reaction, the volume is V, then before reaction, the unreacted is 0.75V.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the wording is, "the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume." So, the existing volume (after reaction) is larger than the original. So, the original is 25% less than existing.

So, let me model this. Let’s suppose the initial amount (unreacted) is V_initial = X. After decomposition, V_total = Y. According to the problem, V_initial = 0.75 Y. So, X = 0.75 Y.

The reaction is N₂O₄ ⇌ 2 NO₂. Let's let the amount of N₂O₄ that decomposes be 'n' moles. So, initially, [N₂O₄] = 1 mole (assuming 1 liter at 273 K and 1 atm, which is ideal gas, so moles are proportional to volume). But wait, perhaps it's better to model it in terms of moles.

Wait, but maybe I should assume that the initial amount is 1 liter of N₂O₄, but wait, perhaps it's easier to use moles since the volume and pressure are constants.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the initial and final volumes. Let's model it as:

At the start, we have V_initial = X (unreacted) = 0.75 Y (where Y is the total volume after reaction). We're told that when the original (X) is 25% less than the existing (Y), so X = 0.75 Y.

But wait, the problem is asking about the extent of decomposition. So, when some of N₂O₄ decomposes, the amount changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up an ICE table. Let me think.

Let me denote the initial moles of N₂O₄ as 1 mole (since the volume is 1 liter at 273 K and 1 atm, so using PV = nRT, and R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, so n = PV/(RT) = (1)(1)/(0.0821 * 273) ≈ 4.17 moles. Wait, that's probably more complicated than I need, but perhaps it's better to proceed.

Wait, wait, perhaps the initial volume of N₂O₄ is 1 liter. But wait, the problem states "the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume." So, original (unreacted) volume (V_initial) = 0.75 V_total (V_total being the volume after reaction).

So, let me model this.

Let me denote the initial moles of N₂O₄ as 1 mole (since 1 liter at 273 K and 1 atm, which is ideal, so 1 mole). Let 'x' be the moles that decompose. So:

At the beginning,

N₂O₄: 1 mole

At equilibrium,

N₂O₄: 1 - x

NO₂: 2x (since each mole of N₂O₄ produces 2 moles of NO₂)

The total volume after reaction is (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x.

But according to the problem, the original (before reaction) volume is 25% less than the existing (after reaction).

So, V_initial = 0.75 * V_total.

But V_initial is 1 liter, and V_total is 1 + x liters.

So,

1 = 0.75 (1 + x)

Because V_initial is 1 liter, V_total is 1 + x liters.

So,

1 = 0.75 (1 + x)

Let me solve for x.

Divide both sides by 0.75:

1 / 0.75 = 1 + x

1 / 0.75 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...

So,

4/3 = 1 + x → x = 4/3 - 1 → x = 1/3 ≈ 0.333... moles.

So, x is 1/3 moles.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage decomposition. Percentage decomposition is (x / initial amount) * 100.

The initial amount is 1 mole.

So, ( (1/3) / 1 ) * 100 = 33.333...%, which is approximately 33.3%. Looking at the options, option A is 33%, option E is 66%.

Wait, but wait, let me check if I got the setup right.

Wait, perhaps I confused the initial and existing volumes. Because another approach is to model the volume in the reverse way. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says, "the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume." So, the existing (after reaction) volume is 125% of the original. So, V_total = (100 +25)% of V_initial → V_total = 1.25 V_initial.

So, V_initial = 0.8 V_total. Wait, that's a different setup. Hmm, that's a possible mistake in my earlier approach.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The original volume (before reaction) is X. The existing volume (after reaction) is Y. According to the problem, X = 0.25 Y → X = 0.25 Y → Y = 4 X.

So, the existing volume (Y) is four times the original (X). So, Y =4 X.

Now, setting up the ICE table again:

At the beginning,

N₂O₄: 1 mole → volume X.

At equilibrium,

N₂O₄: 1 - x moles → volume (1 - x) * V, where V is the volume per mole (but since moles and volume are proportional, assuming ideal gas, the volume is proportional to moles).

NO₂: 2x moles → volume 2x V.

The total volume Y = (1 -x)V + 2x V = (1 + x)V.

But Y is 4X moles. Wait, perhaps this is getting a bit messy. Let me think in terms of moles and volumes.

Wait, another approach: Let me think in terms of the initial and final volumes.

Initial volume (unreacted): V_initial = X.

After reaction, the total volume is V_initial + ΔV = X + ΔV.

According to the problem, V_initial = 0.75 * (X + ΔV).

Wait, because the original volume is 25% less than the existing. Wait, no, the problem says that the original volume is 25% less than the existing. So, V_initial = (1 - 0.25) V_total → V_initial = 0.75 V_total.

So, V_total = V_initial / 0.75 = (X) / 0.75.

But V_total is also the sum of remaining N₂O₄ and the produced NO₂.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me set V_initial = 1 L. Then V_total after reaction is 1 L / 0.75 = 4/3 L.

So, V_total = 4/3 L. Which must be equal to (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x. So,

1 + x = 4/3 → x = 4/3 -1 = 1/3 → x=0.333 moles.

So, moles of N₂O₄ that decomposed is 1/3. The initial moles were 1 mole. So, the percentage decomposition is (1/3)/1 *100% = 33.333%, which is approximately 33%, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the reaction in another way. Perhaps I should consider the change in volume.

Wait, another way: the decomposition increases the volume because N₂O₄ turns into NO₂. The initial volume is 1L, and the existing (after reaction) is 4/3 L. So, the increase is 1/3 L. But wait, that's an increase in volume, which makes sense.

So, the amount that decomposes is 1/3 mole. So, percentage is 33.3% decomposition. So, option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with A being 33%, and others.

Wait, the options list 33%, which is option A.

So, the answer should be option A: 33% decomposition.

To determine the percentage decomposition of nitrogen dioxide (\( \text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \)) into nitrogen (\( \text{NO}_2 \)) at 273 K and 1 atm, we analyze the reaction:

\[
\text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \rightleftharpoons 2 \text{NO}_2
\]

### Key Information:
1. The original volume (\( V_{\text{initial}} \)) is 25% less than the existing volume (\( V_{\text{total}} \)) after decomposition.
2. The initial volume of \( \text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \) is 1 liter.
3. The total volume after decomposition is \( V_{\text{total}} \), and the original volume is \( V_{\text{initial}} = 0.75 V_{\text{total}} \).

### Setup:
Let \( x \) be the moles of \( \text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \) that decompose. Initially, there is 1 mole of \( \text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \). After decomposition:
- Remaining \( \text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \): \( 1 - x \) moles.
- Produced \( \text{NO}_2 \): \( 2x \) moles.

The total volume after decomposition is:
\[
V_{\text{total}} = (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x
\]

From the problem, \( V_{\text{initial}} = 0.75 V_{\text{total}} \), and since \( V_{\text{initial}} = 1 \) liter, we have:
\[
1 = 0.75 (1 + x)
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
1 = 0.75 + 0.75x \\
0.25 = 0.75x \\
x = \frac{0.25}{0.75} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, \( x = 1/3 \) moles of \( \text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \) decomposed.

### Percentage Decomposition:
The percentage decomposition is calculated as:
\[
\text{Percentage Decomposition} = \left( \frac{x}{\text{Initial moles}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1/3}{1} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\%
\]

### Conclusion:
The percentage decomposition of \( \text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \) is approximately \( 33\% \), which corresponds to option **A**.
