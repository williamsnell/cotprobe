Okay, so I need to figure out what (1+i)^10 is. Hmm, I remember that complex numbers can be a bit tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about the properties of complex numbers.

First, I recall that 1+i is a complex number in the form a + bi, where a and b are both 1. Maybe I can use polar form for this because raising to a power is easier in polar form, thanks to De Moivre's theorem.

To convert 1+i into polar form, I need to find the magnitude and the angle. The magnitude r is the square root of (a² + b²). So, for 1+i, that would be sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2). The angle θ is the arctangent of (b/a), which is arctan(1/1) = 45 degrees or π/4 radians.

So, 1+i can be written as sqrt(2) * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)).

Now, I need to raise this to the 10th power. Using De Moivre's theorem, (r)(cosθ + i sinθ)^n = r^n (cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)).

So, applying this to (1+i)^10, r is sqrt(2), n is 10, and θ is π/4.

r^10 is (sqrt(2))^10. Let's calculate that. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^10 is 2^(5) = 32.

Then, nθ is 10*(π/4) = (10/4)π = (5/2)π. That's the same as 2π + π/2, but since cosine and sine have a period of 2π, cos(5π/2) is the same as cos(π/2), and sin(5π/2) is same as sin(π/2).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5π/2 is equal to 2π + π/2. Because 2π is a full circle, so 5π/2 is π/2 plus two full circles. So cos(5π/2) is same as cos(π/2), which is 0. Similarly, sin(5π/2) is same as sin(π/2), which is 1.

So putting it together, (1+i)^10 = 32 [cos(5π/2) + i sin(5π/2)] = 32*(0 + i*1) = 32i.

Wait, but I should check if I did the exponents correctly. Let me double-check the angle. 10*(π/4) is 10π/4 = 5π/2, which is 2π + π/2, so yes, the angle is equivalent to π/2. So the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is 32.

Looking at the options, option C is 32i. So that would be the answer.

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

To solve (1+i)^10, we use polar form and De Moivre's theorem. The magnitude of 1+i is sqrt(2), and its angle is π/4. Raising to the 10th power, we get (sqrt(2))^10 = 32 and the angle becomes 5π/2, which simplifies to π/2. Thus, (1+i)^10 = 32i.
