Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because gas laws can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's an 11-liter flask containing neon and hydrogen. The gas density is 0.002 g/cm³ at 0°C. They're asking for the average molecular weight, the mass of hydrogen, and the pressure. Also, the options are given, so I can check my results against them.

First, I remember that gas density (d) is given by the formula d = (mass) / (volume). Oh wait, but wait, the units are a bit confusing. Let me think: 0.002 g/cm³. Wait, 1 cm³ is 1 mL. So the density is 0.002 g/mL. Since the flask is 11 liters, which is 11,000 mL, right?

Wait, but the formula for density is mass divided by volume. So I can rearrange it to find the total mass. Mass = density × volume.

Wait, so the total mass of neon and hydrogen is 0.002 g/mL * 11,000 mL. Let me calculate that. 0.002 * 11000 = 22 grams. Oh wait, that's 22 grams total? Because 0.002 multiplied by 11000 (since 11 L is 11,000 mL) is 22 grams. That's the combined mass of neon and hydrogen.

Wait, but the problem gives me the mass of neon as 20 grams. Oh, wait, because the mass of neon is 20 grams, that's given in the question. So the mass of hydrogen would be total mass minus neon's mass. So 22g - 20g = 2g. But wait, that's 2 grams of hydrogen, so the mass of hydrogen is 2 grams. But wait, looking at the options, I see one option says 2 grams of hydrogen. Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, the problem says the flask has 20g of neon and an unknown weight of hydrogen. So yes, the hydrogen is 2 grams. Wait, but looking at the options, option G says 2 grams of hydrogen, but it also talks about 11 gm/mole. Hmm. So perhaps that's correct, but maybe I should double-check.

Wait, no, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me redo the math. If the total mass is 22 grams, and neon is 20 grams, then hydrogen is 2 grams. So the hydrogen mass is 2 grams. But looking at the options, I see option G has 2 grams, but option G's average molecular weight is 11gm/mole, which is a lot lower than other options.

Wait, but let me think about the average molecular weight. Because the formula for density is (PM)/(RT), but wait, perhaps I should use that. Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But for density, maybe it's better to think in terms of molar mass. The density of a gas is (PM) / (RT), but wait, let me get the correct formula.

Oh right, the equation for density is d = (PM) / (MRT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it in terms of molar density.

Wait, another approach: molar mass (M) is mass (m) divided by moles (n). So n = m/M. The volume (V) is given, so the density is m/(V), so m = d * V.

Wait, so if density is (22g) / 11,000 mL = 0.002 g/mL. Which matches the given density.

Wait, so the total mass of neon and hydrogen is 22g. Neon's mass is 20g, so hydrogen is 2g. So the mass of hydrogen is 2g.

Now, the average molecular weight of the mixture. Wait, the problem says 'average molecular weight of the mixture.' So the mixture is neon and hydrogen.

The average molecular weight is the sum of (mass of each component) multiplied by their molar masses, divided by the total mass. Or wait, no: perhaps it's the sum of (number of moles of each) times their molar masses, divided by total moles. But that's the same as the average molecular weight.

Alternatively, since density is mass/volume, and using the ideal gas law PV = nRT, and density d = m/V.

So, for each gas, the number of moles is m/M, so for neon, moles = 20g / M_Ne. For hydrogen, moles = 2g / M_H2.

The total moles, n_total = (20 + 2)/M_avg, where M_avg is the average molar mass.

But wait, from the ideal gas law, PV = nRT => n = PV/(RT).

So, for the mixture, n_total = (P * V)/(R T).

But each gas contributes to the pressure. Hmm, perhaps I can think in terms of partial pressures.

Wait, the density of the mixture is 0.002 g/cm³ = 22 g/L? No, wait, 0.002 g/mL is 22 g/L, because 1 mL is 0.001 L. So 0.002g/mL is 22 g/L. Wait, no, wait: 1 g/mL is 1000 g/L. So 0.002 g/mL is 0.002 * 1000 = 2 g/L. Wait, no, wait, 1 mL is 0.001 L. So 1 g/mL is 1000 g/L. So 0.002 g/mL is 0.002 * 1000 = 2 g/L. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think: if density is 0.002 g/mL, then in grams per liter, it's 0.002 * 1000 = 2 g/L. So the density is 2 g/L.

Wait, but the volume is 11 liters, so mass is 2 g/L * 11 L = 22 grams, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the density d is 22g / 11 L = 2 g/L. Wait, so the density is 2 g/L. Because 11 L * 2 g/L is 22g.

So, the total mass is 22 grams.

Neon's mass is 20g. So hydrogen is 2g.

Now, the average molar mass M_avg = (mass of neon + mass of H2) / (moles of neon + moles of H2).

But moles = mass / M, so moles of neon = 20g / M_Ne, and moles of H2 = 2g / M_H2.

But M_Ne is 20 g/mol (given by the atomic weight), and M_H2 is 2 g/mol.

So, moles of neon: 20 / 20 = 1 mole.

Moles of H2: 2 / 2 = 1 mole.

So total moles: 2 (1+1). So M_avg is (20 + 2) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11 g/mol.

Wait, so the average molecular weight is 11 g/mol.

Hmm, looking at the options, some have M_avg as 11. So options B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The mass of hydrogen we found is 2g.

Now, the pressure. We need to find the pressure in atm.

We can use the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

Wait, but we need to find the pressure. Let's make sure about units.

Given:
d = 22 g/L (since 22 g in 11L)
T is 0°C, which is 273 K.
Molar mass M_avg is 11 g/mol.

We can find n using PV = nRT, but perhaps it's easier to find n from the mass and molar mass.

n = total mass / M_avg = 22g / 11g/mol = 2 moles.

So n = 2.

Now, using PV = nRT.

We can solve for P: P = (nRT)/V.

But units: n is in moles, R is in L·atm/(mol·K), T in K, V in L.

Let's plug in:

n = 2 mol
R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T = 273 K
V = 11 L

So P = (2 * 0.0821 * 273) / 11

Let me calculate that step by step.

0.0821 * 273 = approx 22.4433 (since 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 0.0821 * 273. Let me compute:

0.08 * 273 = 21.84
0.0021 * 273 = approx 0.5733.
So total is 21.84 + 0.5733 ≈ 22.4133.

Multiply by 2: 2 * 22.4133 ≈ 44.8266.

Divide by 11: 44.8266 / 11 ≈ 4.075 atm.

So pressure is approximately 4.075 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 2 grams of H2, 11 gm/mole, and 4.07 atm. That's very close to our calculation.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Are we using the correct R value? I think 0.0821 is correct. So yes.

Alternatively, perhaps using 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) is correct.

So the options:

Looking for 2g H2, 11 g/mol, and 4.07 atm. That would be option G.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

For example, option D: 0.5g H2, 11 g/mol, 4.2 atm.

Wait, but our calculation gave 2g H2, not 0.5. So option G is the correct one.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total mass of neon and hydrogen in the flask. The density of the gas is given as 0.002 g/mL, and the volume of the flask is 11 L (or 11,000 mL). Using the formula for density, \( d = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} \), the total mass is:

\[
\text{Total mass} = d \times \text{volume} = 0.002 \, \text{g/mL} \times 11,000 \, \text{mL} = 22 \, \text{g}.
\]

The mass of neon is given as 20 g, so the mass of hydrogen is:

\[
\text{Mass of hydrogen} = \text{Total mass} - \text{Mass of neon} = 22 \, \text{g} - 20 \, \text{g} = 2 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we calculate the average molecular weight of the mixture. The average molecular weight (\( M_{\text{avg}} \)) is determined by the total mass divided by the total moles. Neon's molar mass is 20 g/mol, and hydrogen's molar mass is 2 g/mol. The moles of neon and hydrogen are:

\[
\text{Moles of neon} = \frac{\text{Mass of neon}}{\text{Molar mass of neon}} = \frac{20 \, \text{g}}{20 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of hydrogen} = \frac{\text{Mass of hydrogen}}{\text{Molar mass of hydrogen}} = \frac{2 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total moles are:

\[
\text{Total moles} = 1 \, \text{mol (neon)} + 1 \, \text{mol (hydrogen)} = 2 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The average molecular weight is:

\[
M_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{Total mass}}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{22 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{mol}} = 11 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Now, we calculate the pressure using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \). Rearranging for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V}.
\]

The total mass is 22 g, so the number of moles \( n \) is:

\[
n = \frac{\text{Total mass}}{M_{\text{avg}}} = \frac{22 \, \text{g}}{11 \, \text{g/mol}} = 2 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Using \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \), and \( V = 11 \, \text{L} \):

\[
P = \frac{(2 \, \text{mol})(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(273 \, \text{K})}{11 \, \text{L}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \times 0.0821 \times 273 = 44.8266 \, \text{L·atm}.
\]

Then divide by the volume:

\[
P = \frac{44.8266}{11} \approx 4.075 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Finally, rounding to two decimal places, the pressure is approximately \( 4.07 \, \text{atm} \).

### Final Answer:
The average molecular weight is \( 11 \, \text{g/mol} \), the mass of hydrogen is \( 2 \, \text{g} \), and the pressure is \( 4.07 \, \text{atm} \). This matches **option G**.
