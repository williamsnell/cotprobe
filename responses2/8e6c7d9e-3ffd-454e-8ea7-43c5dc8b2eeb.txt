Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is asking me to find the pH of a 1.0 M NaCN solution. Hmm, NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that NaCN is a salt, and since it's made from a strong base (NaOH or NaOH and water) and a weak acid (HCN), it should hydrolyze in water. Oh right, hydrolysis is when a salt solution reacts with water to produce an acid or a base.

So, the salt here is NaCN, which dissociates into Na+ and CN- ions. The Na+ is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect the pH. The CN- ion comes from the weak acid HCN. Since HCN is a weak acid, it won't completely dissociate in water, so the CN- ion will hydrolyze to produce some H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

I remember the formula for the pH of a weak acid solution is pH = ½ (pKa - pOH), but wait, no, that's for weak bases. Oh right, for weak acids, the pH can be calculated using the formula pH = pKa - (1/2) log (Kw / K_a), but wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, since we're dealing with a weak base, but in this case, it's a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe I should set up an ICE table and do the calculations.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The cyanide ion (CN-) is the conjugate base of HCN. The reaction for its hydrolysis is: 

HCN ↔ H+ + CN-

Since HCN is a weak acid, CN- is a weak base. So, the solution will have some H+ ions, hence an acidic solution. The pH can be found using the formula for weak acid, but perhaps I should approach it through the Kb of CN-.

The Kb of CN- is the reciprocal of Ka for HCN. Because Ka = 4.0e-10, then Kb = 1/(4.0e-10) = 2.5e9? Wait, wait. No, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the K values. Because K_a is for the acid, and K_b is for the conjugate base. So for HCN, K_a is 4.0e-10. So K_b for CN- is 1/(4.0e-10) = 2.5e9? Oh wait no, that's impossible. Because K_b cannot be that high. Wait, no, wait: K_a is 4.0e-10, so K_b is 1/(4e-10) = 2.5e9? Wait, that's way higher than the ion product of water, which is 1e-14. Because Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb would be Kw / Ka. Oh right, I think I made a mistake earlier.

So, Kb = Kw / Ka. So let me compute that. Kw is 1.0e-14, and Ka is 4e-10. So Kb = (1e-14)/(4e-10) = (1/4)*1e-4 = 0.25e-4 = 2.5e-5.

Ah, yes, that makes more sense. So Kb for CN- is 2.5e-5.

Now, the cyanide ion in solution will hydrolyze as:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN-

But wait, no, wait: the correct equation is HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-. Because HCN is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate much. So the CN- will take a proton from water, leading to the HCN reaction.

So, let's set up the equilibrium. Let's let x be the concentration of H+ produced. Then the initial concentrations are:

[HCN] = 1.0 M

[CN^-] = 1.0 M

Change: -x, +x, +x.

At equilibrium:

[HCN] = 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0 M (since x is small)

[CN^-] = 1.0 + x ≈ 1.0 M

[H+] = x

So the expression for Kb is:

Kb = [H+][CN^-] / [HCN] = x^2 / (1.0) = x^2.

Since Kb is 2.5e-5, x^2 = 2.5e-5. So x = sqrt(2.5e-5) 

Calculating that: sqrt(2.5) is about 1.581, sqrt(1e-5) is 1e-2.5, which is 3.16e-3. So 1.581 * 3.16e-3 ≈ 5.09e-3.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately. 

2.5e-5 is 0.000025.

sqrt(0.000025) = 0.005, because 0.005^2 is 0.000025. Oh wait, so x is 0.005 M. So [H+] is 0.005 M.

So the pH is -log(0.005) = log(1/0.005) = log(200). Log(200) is log(2e2) = log(2) + log(100) = 0.3010 + 2 = 2.3010. So pH is about 2.30. Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right because the options don't have anything near that.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recheck that. 

Kw = 1e-14.

Ka = 4e-10.

So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (4e-10) = (1/4) * 1e-4 = 0.25e-4 = 2.5e-5. Correct. So Kb is 2.5e-5.

So when setting up the equation for Kb:

x^2 = Kb = 2.5e-5 → x = sqrt(2.5e-5) = sqrt(2.5)*1e-2.5 → 1.5811 * 3.1623e-3 → approximately 5.00e-3 M. So [H+] is 0.005 M.

Wait, but that would give pH = -log(0.005) = 2.30. But looking at the options, the closest is option F (9.00) which is way too high. Hmm, that can't be right. So what did I do wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I confused the Ka and Kb. Wait, I thought that HCN is the acid, so Kb is for CN^-. So the setup is correct. But is the approximation valid? Because x is 0.005, which is 5e-3. The initial concentration is 1.0 M, so x is 5% of 1.0 M. So the assumption that 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0 is valid. So that's fine.

Wait, but then why isn't the pH in the options? Oh wait, looking back at the options, the pH's are all around 9 to 12. So my calculation would give an pH of about 2.30, which isn't even among the options. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I confused the Ka and Kb. Maybe I should have used the Ka for HCN instead of Kb. Let me re-examine that.

HCN is a weak acid, its Ka is 4e-10.

So, for the hydrolysis:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-

But wait, that's not correct. Because when HCN donates a proton, it becomes H+ and CN^-. So the correct equation is HCN → H+ + CN^-. So the Kb for CN^- would be Kw / Ka, which is 1e-14 / 4e-10 = 2.5e-5.

So that part was correct. So why isn't my pH matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let's compute x again accurately.

x = sqrt(2.5e-5) = sqrt(0.000025) = 0.005. So [H+] is 0.005 M.

pH = -log(0.005) = log(200), because 1/0.005 is 200. Log(200) is log(2 * 100) = log(2) + 2 = 0.3010 + 2 = 2.3010. So pH ≈ 2.30.

But the options are all around 9 to 12, so this suggests I made a mistake in the approach. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the formula for the pH of a weak base, but in this case, it's a weak acid. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for the pH of a salt solution that's a weak base and a strong acid. Wait, no, NaCN is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. Oh wait, no, NaCN is a salt of a weak acid (HCN) and a strong base (NaOH, but actually Na is a spectator and CN- is the conjugate base).

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. The pH can be calculated using the formula: pH = ½ (pKa - pOH) → but wait, no, that's for when you have a weak base. Because for a weak base, the pH is calculated using pKa of the conjugate acid. Alternatively, for a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the pH can be found using the formula: pH = ½ (pKa - pKw) + ½ (pKw - pKb?), I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). But wait, in this case, the solution is a salt of a weak acid (HCN) and a strong base (NaCN). So CN- is the conjugate base of HCN. So the buffer here is HCN and CN-.

But wait, the solution is a salt of HCN (a weak acid) and NaOH (a strong base), so the solution is a basic solution because NaOH is a strong base. Wait, no, NaCN is the conjugate base of HCN (weak acid), so the solution should be basic. So how do I calculate the pH? 

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies to buffer solutions where you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Since CN- is the conjugate base of HCN, the solution has a buffer. So pH = pKa + log([CN-]/[HCN]).

Wait, but wait! Wait, the concentration of CN- is 1.0 M as well. Because NaCN dissociates into Na+ and CN-, so in 1.0 M NaCN, both ions are 1.0 M. So, [CN-] = 1.0 M, [HCN] = 1.0 M.

So, pH = pKa + log(1.0/1.0) = pKa + 0 → pH = pKa. Because log(1) is 0.

Wait, but pKa is for HCN, which is 4.0e-10. So pKa = -log(4.0e-10) → let me compute that.

log(4e-10) is log(4) + log(1e-10) → log(4)=0.602, so 0.602 -10 = -9.398. So pKa = 9.398.

Wait, that's a much higher pH. But wait, wait a second. Wait, I'm getting conflicting results here. Earlier, I thought using the Kb approach gave pH around 2.3, but using the buffer approach gives pH around 9.4. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the buffer approach. Let's rethink.

The buffer is HCN and CN-. The concentrations of both are 1.0 M, so the ratio is 1. So the pH should be equal to the pKa of HCN. Because in Henderson-Hasselbalch, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) → since [A-] = [HA], the log is zero, pH = pKa.

So in this case, pKa is 9.398. So pH is approximately 9.4.

Looking at the options, option H is 11.70, G is 10.70, I is 9.40. So option I is 9.40. 

Wait, but earlier, when I used the Kb approach, I thought the pH was 2.3, but that's wrong because I messed up the setup. So perhaps my mistake was confusing the approach. Let me re-derive it correctly.

Wait, the initial mistake was that I used the Kb for CN^- in the setup, but perhaps I should have used the HCN's Ka and applied the buffer approach correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the salt NaCN is a strong electrolyte, so in solution: Na+ and CN^-.

CN^- is the conjugate base of HCN (weak acid), so when it's in solution, it will hydrolyze. But since NaCN is the salt of the weak acid and a strong base, the solution should be basic. So the pH will be higher.

Wait, but earlier, using the buffer approach, pH = pKa (HCN) = 9.398, so about 9.4. That's option I.

But earlier, I used the Kb approach and thought the pH was 2.3, which is not an option. But perhaps that was a mistake because I didn't use the correct approach.

Wait, but according to the buffer approach, it's 9.4. So the correct answer is option I: 9.40.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. The formula is pH = pKa + (1/2) log (Kw / (Kw * [base]/[acid]))? Or wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base.

Wait, another approach: for a salt of a weak acid (HA) and a strong base (NaB), the pH is given by pH = pKa + (1/2) log (Kw / (Kw * [base]/[acid]))? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the pH of a salt derived from a weak acid and a strong base is: pH = (pKa + pKb)/2 + (1/2) log (Kw) ) → but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the buffer equation correctly.

Wait, the buffer equation is pH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]). In the case of NaCN, [A-] is [CN^-], which is 1.0 M, and [HA] is [HCN], which is 1.0 M. So the ratio is 1, so pH = pKa.

pKa is calculated as -log (Ka). Ka is 4.0e-10 → log(4e-10) is log(4) + log(1e-10) → 0.602 -10 = -9.398 → pKa ≈9.398.

So pH should be approximately 9.40, which is option I.

But earlier, when I used the Kb approach, I got a pH of about 2.3, which is incorrect. So perhaps I confused the Kb setup. Alternatively, perhaps the Kb approach should be applied to another ion.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the hydrolysis of HCN, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the dissociation of CN^-.

Wait, the correct approach is the one using the buffer equation, which gives pH = 9.40. So option I is correct.

Looking again at the options, option I is 9.40.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another approach. Another way to compute is to use the formula for pH when a salt is formed from a weak acid and a strong base.

The formula is pH = pKa + (1/2) log (Kw / (Kw * [base]/[acid])) ) → but I'm not confident about this. Another approach is to calculate the [H+] using the Ka of the acid.

Wait, wait, the correct approach is: when NaCN is dissolved, it dissociates into Na+ and CN^- ions. The CN^- ion will hydrolyze in water, producing H+ and CN^-.

So the reaction is:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

Wait, no, that's not right. Because HCN is a weak acid, it will donate a proton. So the reaction should be:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-

But wait, that's the same as before. So the setup is correct. But why did the buffer approach give a different result?

Ah, perhaps I should have considered the reverse. Wait, the opposite reaction is HCN dissociating: HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-. So the Kb is for the conjugate base. But perhaps I should have considered the correct way using the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the Kb expression for the CN^- ion. Let me set up the ICE table again.

CN^- is the conjugate base of HCN. So, the reaction is:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-

Wait, but that's not correct. Because HCN is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate much, so the CN^- ion would take a proton from water, leading to the hydrolysis:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

Wait, but that's not right. Because water can accept a proton from the CN^- ion, leading to the reaction:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

Wait, but that's not correct. The correct hydrolysis of CN^- is:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the correct hydrolysis is:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, let me think again. The correct reaction is:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-

But CN^- is a base, so it will accept a proton from water. So:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

But that can't be correct because HCN is a weak acid. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me try another approach.

Let me write the expression for the hydrolysis of CN^-.

The reaction is:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

Wait, but HCN is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the equilibrium is:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-

But wait, that's the same as before. So the setup is correct.

We have to proceed with the Kb approach, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me try again. The Kb expression is [HCN][OH^-] / [CN^-] = Kb.

Assuming [HCN] ≈ 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0.

So the equation becomes:

(1.0)(x) / (1.0) = Kb → x = Kb.

Wait, that's the same as before. But wait, if Kb = 2.5e-5, then x = 2.5e-5, which gives [H+] = 2.5e-5 → pH = 4.60. But none of the options are near that.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the buffer approach gives pH = pKa = ~9.398. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I've confused the formula for the pH of a salt with the buffer equation. Let me clarify.

The buffer equation applies when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base in solution. The pH can be calculated using pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

In this case, the salt NaCN provides CN^- and Na+ ions. CN^- is the conjugate base of HCN. So the concentrations of CN^- and HCN in solution are both 1.0 M.

So, [A-] = [CN^-] = 1.0 M, [HA] = [HCN] = 1.0 M.

So, pH = pKa + log(1) → pH = pKa.

Which is 9.398, approximately 9.4.

But earlier, when I used the Kb approach, I thought [H+] = sqrt(Kb) = 0.005 M, which would make pH ~2.3. That's conflicting with the buffer approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the buffer approach. Let me re-examine it.

The buffer approach applies when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base in solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, in the case where the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal, the ratio is 1, so log(1) is 0. Therefore, pH = pKa.

So that's correct. So why did the Kb approach give a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the Kb equation. Let me write the expression correctly.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

HCN ↔ H+ + CN^-

But wait, that's not correct because HCN is a weak acid and will not dissociate much, so the correct reaction is:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

Wait, but that's the same as before. So perhaps I should have considered the reverse reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the reaction of HCN with water, but that's not right because HCN is a weak acid. So, the correct hydrolysis of CN^- is:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

But wait, HCN is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate much, meaning that the equilibrium is not achieved, and the hydrolysis doesn't go to completion. So, the [HCN] is less than 1.0 M.

But in the buffer equation, the [A-] and [HA] are both 1.0 M, so the pH is pKa, but the actual [HCN] is less than 1.0 M because the hydrolysis doesn't go to completion. Therefore, the pH would be lower than pKa, which is not the case.

Wait, but the buffer equation is based on the assumption that the concentrations of the acid and conjugate base are equal, which may not hold in this case because the acid isn't fully ionized. Therefore, the buffer equation may not be applicable here.

Thus, perhaps the correct approach is to use the buffer equation, which gives pH = pKa, but in reality, the pH would be lower, which contradicts the data. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use the buffer equation and the fact that in the solution, the concentration of HCN is less than 1.0 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation but considering the dilution. Wait, but the buffer equation doesn't account for dilution. So, this approach may not be correct.

Wait, another approach: Since the solution is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the pH can be calculated using the formula pH = pKa + (1/2) log (Kw / (Kw [base]/[acid])).

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the fact that the solution is a weak base and calculated the pH accordingly. But that's not correct because the solution contains a weak acid and a strong base.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the hydrolysis of the CN^- ion.

The reaction is:

CN^- + H2O ↔ HCN + OH^-

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kw / Kb, where Kb is the base dissociation constant.

But wait, the Kb is for the CN^- ion. Let me compute Kb.

Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is the acid dissociation constant of HCN: 4.0e-10.

Kb = (1e-14)/(4e-10) = 2.5e-5.

So, the equilibrium constant for the reaction is Kb = 2.5e-5.

The equilibrium expression is:

Kb = [HCN][OH^-]/[CN^-]

Assuming that [HCN] = x, [OH^-] = y, and [CN^-] = 1.0.

But wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer and use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

In the buffer equation, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

In this case, [A-] is [CN^-] = 1.0 M, [HA] is [HCN] = 1.0 M.

So, pH = pKa + log(1) → 9.4.

So the pH is 9.4, option I.

But earlier, when I did the Kb approach, I thought [H+] was 0.005 M, which would be pH 2.3.

But that can't be correct because the buffer equation is correct only if [A-] = [HA].

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong because I didn't realize that the correct way to calculate pH is using the buffer equation, which gives pH = pKa. Therefore, the correct answer should be option I: 9.40.

So the correct answer is option I.
</think>

To determine the pH of a 1.0 M NaCN solution, we analyze the problem using the buffer approach. NaCN dissociates into Na⁺ and CN⁻ ions in solution, where CN⁻ is the conjugate base of the weak acid HCN. Thus, the solution acts as a buffer containing HCN (weak acid) and CN⁻ (conjugate base). 

The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]

Here:
- \([\text{A}^-] = [\text{CN}^-] = 1.0 \, \text{M}\) (concentration of the conjugate base),
- \([\text{HA}] = [\text{HCN}] = 1.0 \, \text{M}\) (concentration of the weak acid),
- \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(K_a)\), and \(K_a = 4.0 \times 10^{-10}\).

Calculating \(\text{p}K_a\):
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(4.0 \times 10^{-10}) = -\left(\log(4) + \log(10^{-10})\right) = -\left(0.602 - 10\right) = 9.398
\]

Since \([\text{A}^-] = [\text{HA}]\), the ratio \(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = 1\), and \(\log(1) = 0\). Thus, the pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + 0 = 9.398
\]

Rounding to the nearest decimal place, the pH is approximately \(9.40\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
