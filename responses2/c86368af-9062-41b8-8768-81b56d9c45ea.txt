Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and pH calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: Calculate the number of grams of NH_4Cl that must be added to 2 liters of 0.1 M NH3 to prepare a solution with pH 11.3 at 25°C. The Kb for NH3 is 1.8×10^-5. The equilibrium is NH3 + H2O <-> NH4+ + OH^-.

Hmm, okay. I remember that NH3 is a weak base, and NH4Cl is its conjugate acid. So, when we add NH4Cl to NH3 solution, it should form a buffer solution. Buffer solutions resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. But wait, the question is about pH, so I'll need to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is for buffers involving acid and its conjugate base. So in this case, the NH3 is the base (conjugate base), and NH4+ is the acid (conjugate acid). So the equation would be pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but wait, the Kb is given, not Ka. Oh right, because Kb is for the base. So I need to find the Ka of NH4+ because the Henderson equation uses pKa. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, Ka = Kw / Kb. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So let me compute Ka first. Kb is 1.8e-5. So:

Ka = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) = (1/(1.8)) * 1e-9. Let me compute that. 1/1.8 is approximately 0.5556. So 0.5556e-9, which is 5.556e-10. So Ka is approximately 5.556e-10.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson equation uses pKa, which is the negative log of Ka. So pKa = -log(5.556e-10). Let me calculate that. Log of 5.556e-10 is log(5.556) + log(1e-10) = about 0.745 + (-10) = -9.255. So pKa is 9.255.

Now, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). We have pH given as 11.3. So 11.3 = 9.255 + log([base]/[acid]).

Subtracting pKa from both sides: 11.3 - 9.255 = 2.045. So log([base]/[acid]) = 2.045. Which means [base]/[acid] = 10^2.045 ≈ 111.0? Wait, 10^2 is 100, 10^0.045 is about 1.11, so 100 * 1.11 = 111.

So [base]/[acid] ≈ 111. So [base] = 111 * [acid].

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the concentrations are based on the moles. Let me think about the initial solution.

The initial solution is 2 liters of 0.1 M NH3. So the moles of NH3 is 2 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.2 mol. Since NH3 is a weak base and NH4Cl is a strong electrolyte (completely dissociates), adding NH4Cl will provide moles of NH4+ equal to the moles of NH4Cl added. 

Wait, but when NH4Cl dissolves, it dissociates into NH4+ and Cl^- ions. So the moles of NH4+ added will be equal to the moles of NH4Cl added.

So, let's denote the moles of NH3 as 0.2 mol (since it's 0.1 M in 2 liters), and the moles of NH4+ as n (the amount we are trying to find).

But wait, the buffer solution will have both NH3 and NH4+ in solution, so the concentrations can be calculated as:

[base] = (moles NH3) / (volume) = 0.2 mol / 2 L = 0.1 M.

Wait, wait, the volume is 2 liters. So the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.1 M before adding NH4Cl. But when you add NH4Cl, it dissociates, so moles of NH4+ added will be equal to the moles of NH4Cl added.

Now, in the buffer solution, the concentrations of NH3 and NH4+ are [NH3] and [NH4+] respectively. But the Henderson equation is about the ratio of these concentrations.

Wait, but wait, when we add NH4Cl, it doesn't change the volume of the solution, so the concentrations of NH3 and NH4+ are each divided by the same volume.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles.

Let me restate. Let me let x be the number of moles of NH4Cl added. 

So, the moles of NH3 initially is 0.2 mol. Moles of NH4+ added is x.

The volume of the solution is 2 L.

So, [NH3] = 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 M.

[NH4+] = x / 2.

Now, according to the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

We have pH = 11.3, pKa=9.255.

So 11.3 = 9.255 + log(0.1 / (x/2)).

Subtracting 9.255 from both sides: 2.045 = log(0.1 / (x/2)).

Wait, 0.1 is the concentration of NH3. Wait, no, wait: [base] is 0.1 M, [acid] is x/(2 L).

Wait, no, [base] is [NH3] = 0.2 mol / 2 L = 0.1 M.

Wait, and [acid] is [NH4+] = x / 2.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is (0.1)/(x/2) = 0.2 / x.

So, 2.045 = log(0.2 / x).

Hmm, wait, no that's not right. Because 0.1 is the concentration of NH3, and x/2 is the concentration of NH4+.

So the ratio is [NH3]/[NH4+] = 0.1 / (x/(2)) = (0.1 * 2) / x = 0.2/x.

So in the Henderson equation, it's [base]/[acid] = 0.2 / x.

Wait, wait, no. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

So [base] is 0.1 M, [acid] is x/2.

So, (0.1) / (x/2) = 0.2 / x.

So, log(0.2 / x) = 2.045.

So, 0.2 / x = 10^2.045.

10^2.045 is 10^0.045 * 10^2. Let me compute that.

10^0.045: since log10(1.11) is about 0.045 (because 10^0.045 ≈ 1.11). So 10^0.045 ≈ 1.11. So 10^2.045 = 1.11 * 100 = 111.

So 0.2 / x = 111 → x = 0.2 / 111 → x ≈ 0.0018018 mol.

Wait, wait, that's 0.0018 moles of NH4Cl. But wait, that's 0.0018 mol, which is 0.0018 / 0.0635 kg? No, wait, no, wait, the question is about grams of NH4Cl, not moles.

Wait, no. Moles are 0.0018 mol. To get grams, we multiply by molar mass.

NH4Cl's molar mass is (14 + 4*1 + 35.45) = 14 +4=18, plus 35.45 is 53.45 g/mol.

So grams = 0.0018 * 53.45 ≈ 0.0962 g.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.096 g, G is 0.095, etc. So 0.096 is option F.

Wait, but wait, I thought I got 0.0018 mol, which is 0.0018 * 53.45 = about 0.0962 grams. So that's 0.096 g, which matches option F.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me go back. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the equations.

So, the moles of NH3 is 0.2 (since 2 L * 0.1 M = 0.2 mol). The added NH4Cl gives x moles of NH4+.

The Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log( [NH3] / [NH4+] )

We have pH = 11.3, pKa = 9.255. So 11.3 -9.255 = 2.045 = log (0.1 / (x/(2)) )

Wait, [NH3] is 0.2 mol / 2 L = 0.1 M, [NH4+] is x/(2 L). So ratio is 0.1 / (x/2) = 0.2/x.

So 2.045 = log(0.2/(x)).

Wait, wait, no, wait, 0.1 / (x/2) equals 0.2/(x). Because 0.1 * 2 is 0.2, and divided by x.

So 0.2 / x = 10^2.045 → 10^2.045 is about 111.

So 0.2 = 111 * x → x = 0.2 / 111 ≈ 0.0018018 mol.

Mass of NH4Cl is 0.0018018 mol * 53.45 g/mol.

Wait, 53.45 * 0.0018 is 0.096213 grams, so about 0.0962 grams. Looking at the options:

F: 0.096 g of NH4Cl.

So the answer should be F.

To calculate the number of grams of NH₄Cl that must be added to 2 L of 0.1 M NH₃ to prepare a solution with pH = 11.3 at 25°C, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate pKa
The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^-
\]

The base dissociation constant \(K_b\) is given as \(1.8 \times 10^{-5}\). Using \(K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}\), the acid dissociation constant \(K_a\) is:

\[
K_a = \frac{K_w}{K_b} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10}
\]

The pKa is:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a) = -\log(5.56 \times 10^{-10}) \approx 9.255
\]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The given pH is 11.3. Substituting into the equation:

\[
11.3 = 9.255 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{NH}_3]}{[\text{NH}_4^+]}\right)
\]

Subtracting 9.255 from both sides:

\[
11.3 - 9.255 = 2.045 = \log\left(\frac{[\text{NH}_3]}{[\text{NH}_4^+]}\right)
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{[\text{NH}_3]}{[\text{NH}_4^+]} = 10^{2.045} \approx 111.1
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{[\text{NH}_3]}{[\text{NH}_4^+]} = \frac{0.1}{x/2} = 111.1
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
\frac{0.1}{x/2} = 111.1 \implies x = \frac{0.2}{111.1} \approx 0.0018018 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Convert moles of NH₄Cl to grams
The molar mass of NH₄Cl is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of NH}_4^+ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 35.45 = 53.46 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of NH₄Cl required is:

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.0018018 \, \text{mol} \times 53.46 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 0.0962 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The closest option to 0.0962 g is **0.096 g of NH₄Cl**.
