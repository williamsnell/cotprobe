Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home.
B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract.
C: The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant prohibiting mobile homes.
D: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
E: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.
F: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
G: The buyer should have had actual notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
H: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
I: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office.
J: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could only be enforced by the original developer.

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. Okay, so the question is about property law, specifically contract and covenant issues. I remember that when there are covenants in a deed, the transfer of ownership affects whether the covenant still applies.

So, the scenario goes like this: The developer bought a tract in 1996 and created a subdivision with 100 lots. Each of the first 60 lots was sold by deed in 1997, each specifying that no trailer or mobile homes were allowed. The developer then sold the remaining 40 to a builder in 2003, using a deed identical to the first 60. These were recorded. Then, in 2008, the builder sold all 40 lots. The buyer bought one lot from the builder and placed a mobile home on it. The question is about the buyer's deed regarding mobile homes.

The question is asking which statement is least accurate with respect to the buyer's deed. The options are A to J, each making a different claim about the covenant.

The key point is understanding the transfer of covenants. The original covenants in the first 60 deeds are recorded with the county recorder's office. The builder's deed, which included the same clauses, was recorded too. But the covenants were transferred to the builder, meaning they're no longer on the developer's record.

So, when the builder sells the lots, the covenants (no trailer or mobile home) are no longer on the developer's record. Later, when the builder sells again, the builder's deed records the covenants, but those covenants were transferred from the developer's record to the builder's. So, when the buyer gets the lots, their ownership doesn't transfer the covenants. The covenants are still in the builder's possession until they're recorded.

Now, the buyer's deed, which includes the same clauses as the original 60 deeds, but without mentioning mobile homes, would it affect the covenant? Wait, no. Because the original covenants are on the developer's record, but as the builder records, the covenants are now on the builder's. So, the builder's deed doesn't change that.

So, when the builder sells the lots, the covenants (no trailer or mobile home) are on the builder's record. The buyer's deed doesn't include this covenant because the covenants were already recorded with the builder. So, the covenant is still in the builder's interest.

The question is about the buyer's deed. So, if the buyer's deed doesn't specify the mobile home covenant, then it's not part of the original deed. The covenants were recorded when the builder sold the lots, so they are in the builder's interest, but not on the developer's record. The developer's deed to the builder doesn't include the mobile home clause because it's already on the builder's record.

Looking at the options, option C says the builder's deed didn't include the mobile home clause. That's correct because the developer recorded the original 60 deeds, but the builder's deed included the same clauses as the developer's, not including the mobile home. So the mobile home covenant is in the builder's deed, not in the developer's.

The other options:

A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home. Well, the builder's deed includes the restriction, so the buyer would have a right to remove it. So, A is correct.

B: All subsequent grantees would be in privity. The builder's deed is a grant, and the builder's subsequent grantees would be in privity. So B is correct.

D: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not as far as the buyer. The covenants were with the land the developer had, but they were with the builder's land. So D is correct.

E: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate. Since the builder's deed was recorded, the grantees would be in privity. So E is correct.

J: The covenant was not recorded. But the developer's deed to the builder did include the mobile home clause, so J is incorrect. Because J says the covenant wasn't recorded. But the developer recorded the original covenants, but then the builder recorded theirs. So J is wrong because the covenant was recorded with the county recorder's office. So J is inaccurate.

Wait, the question is which statement is least accurate. So J is the least accurate because the covenant was recorded with the county recorder's office. So J is incorrect.

The question revolves around property law, specifically covenant enforcement and transfer of ownership. The key issue is understanding whether the covenants in the developer's deed are still enforceable after the transfer to the builder.

- **Option A**: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home because the builder's deed includes the covenant, giving the buyer the right to remove it. This statement is correct.

- **Option B**: Subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract because the builder's deed was recorded. This statement is correct.

- **Option C**: The builder's deed did not include the mobile home covenant, as it was recorded when the builder sold the lots. This statement is correct.

- **Option D**: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder's land, as it was transferred from the developer's land to the builder's. This statement is correct.

- **Option E**: Subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate because the builder's deed was recorded. This statement is correct.

- **Option F**: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction, as the developer recorded the original covenants. However, this statement is incorrect because the covenants were in the builder's interest, not the developer's, and the developer did not record the mobile home covenant with the county recorder's office.

- **Option G**: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder's land, as it was recorded when the builder sold the lots. This statement is correct.

- **Option H**: The covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner because it was recorded with the county recorder's office. This statement is correct.

- **Option I**: The covenant was not recorded with the county recorder's office, as the developer recorded the original covenants. This statement is incorrect.

- **Option J**: The covenant was recorded with the county recorder's office, so this statement is incorrect.

The least accurate statement is **Option J**, as the covenant was indeed recorded with the county recorder's office. However, the question asks for the least accurate statement, and **Option J** is incorrect based on the facts provided.

**ANSWER: J**
