Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me read through it again. The question says, calculate the temperature change of 1 mole of a diatomic gas contained in a piston. We're given q is 65 J and w is 210 J. The options are A through J.

Hmm. Wait, I remember that in thermodynamics, the first law is ΔU = q + w. But wait, I also remember whether it's q plus w or minus. Oh, right, in physics it's often written as ΔU = q - w, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, no. Wait, wait—I should think about the conventions. If the system is doing work on the surroundings, then w is negative. So the formula is ΔU = q + w, because work done by the system is positive. Or wait, some sources say ΔU = q - w, but I might be getting this mixed up.

Wait, let me clarify. The first law is ΔU = q + w. But wait, no, no, wait. Wait, when the system does work on the surroundings, w is negative because the system is losing energy. So if the system releases heat, it's q negative, and the system doing work would be w negative. So let me think again. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the confusion arises because different textbooks have different conventions. Let me try to get it straight. The standard formula is ΔU = q + w, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, some sources say ΔU = q - w. Hmm. Let's think about the signs. If the system absorbs heat (q positive) and does work (w negative), then ΔU = q + w. Because the system gains heat and loses energy via work, so the total change in internal energy is q plus w. Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: when the system does work, it loses energy. So if the system does 210 J of work, that's w = -210 J. Because work done by the system is considered negative in the equation. So, wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔU = q + w, and w is the work done by the system. So in this case, the system does 210 J of work, so w = -210.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that w is 210 J. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the sign. Alternatively, maybe in the problem, w is positive when the gas expands. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the first law regardless of the sign. The main point is the calculation. The question states that the system is losing heat, because q is 65 J. Wait, wait, q is 65 J. Wait, but wait: in the first law, if the system loses heat, q is negative. Because heat is leaving the system. So q is -65 J.

Oh wait, perhaps that's the key point. Because the problem gives q as 65 J, but I think that's the heat absorbed. Or did I get it wrong? No, let me read the question again. The question says q is 65 J, and w is 210 J. So, what's the sign convention here? If the system is losing heat, then q is negative. So perhaps the correct q is -65 J.

But wait, no, the question might not be considering the sign of q. Let me think: The formula is ΔU = q + w. So if the system absorbs heat, q is positive. But if the system does work, w is negative. So if the system does work, the value of w is negative.

Wait, but the problem states that q is 65 J. So if the system is losing heat, then q would be negative. So perhaps the correct way is to take q as -65 J. Or perhaps the question is using the sign convention where work done by the system is positive, so w is 210 J.

Wait, but the problem states that w is 210 J. I think I need to clarify that. Let me read the problem again: The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen. The question says q is 65 J and w is 210 J.

So, according to the problem, q is 65 J, and the work done is 210 J. So, without any signs given, perhaps the sign depends on the convention. But perhaps I should proceed by assuming the correct signs based on common conventions.

Wait, but the problem is about the temperature change, which is ΔU (since internal energy change is what's being calculated). Assuming ΔU is the change in internal energy, and the problem is asking for the temperature change. Wait, but wait, no. ΔU is the change in internal energy, which is equal to the heat added to the system plus the work done on the system. So, the formula is correct as ΔU = q + w, but I need to make sure about the signs.

Wait, let's think about the system. The system is doing work on the surroundings, so the system's internal energy decreases. So if the system does 210 J of work, and it absorbs 65 J of heat, what's the change in internal energy?

Wait, but wait, let me think about the first law. The system is losing heat (so q is negative) and doing work (so w is negative because it's work done by the system). So ΔU = q + w. Q is -65, W is -210. So ΔU = (-65) + (-210) = -275 J. That's the change in internal energy.

But wait, the question is about the temperature change, which is ΔU divided by the number of moles times the molar specific heat at constant volume, I think. Because, for gases, the internal energy change depends on temperature.

Wait, since it's a diatomic gas, the molar heat capacity at constant volume Cv is (5/2) R per mole. Because Cv for diatomic is (5/2) R. So, for 1 mole, Cv = (5/2) R.

So, ΔU = n Cv ΔT. Since n=1 mole, ΔU = (5/2) R ΔT.

Wait, but the units are in joules. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So ΔT would be (ΔU) * (2)/(5 R).

Let me plug in the numbers. ΔU is -275 J.

So, ΔT = (ΔU) * 2 / (5 * 8.314) )

Calculating that: (-275) * 2 / (41.57) ) = (-550) /41.57 ≈ -13.21 K.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -13.5 K, which is close to this.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the signs.

Wait, the calculation of ΔU: If the system does work, then the internal energy decreases. So, in the first law, ΔU = q + w.

If q is heat added to the system (positive), and w is work done on the system (positive), then ΔU is the sum.

But if the system does work (w is negative), then the equation becomes ΔU = q + (−w), where w is work done by the system.

Wait, no. Let me get back. The correct formula is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done by the system. So, if the system does 210 J of work, then w is -210 J.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: the system does work (w is positive if it's work done on the system), but if it's work done by the system, then the system loses energy, so w is negative.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔU = q - w, where w is the work done by the system. So, if the system does 210 J of work, then w = 210 J (but that's work done by the system, so in the formula, it's treated as positive, but the work is subtracted).

Wait, but I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me look for a clear formula.

The first law of thermodynamics is: ΔU = q + W, where W is the work done on the system. Alternatively, if W is the work done by the system, then it's ΔU = q - W.

Hmm, perhaps I should refer to standard definitions. According to standard conventions, the work done on the system is positive. So, if the system does work (expels energy), then W is negative. So, the first law would be ΔU = q + W, where W is the work done on the system.

So, in this case, the system does 210 J of work, which is W = -210 J.

So, ΔU = q + W. q is the heat added to the system. The problem says q is 65 J. But wait, if q is the heat absorbed, then it's positive. But if the system is losing heat (doing work), then q is negative.

Wait, the problem says q is 65 J. I think that's the heat absorbed, so q is positive 65 J. But then, assuming that the system is doing 210 J of work, which is W = -210 J.

So, ΔU = 65 + (-210) = -145 J.

Wait, so ΔU is -145 J.

Now, since ΔU = n Cv ΔT, and n=1 mole, Cv is (5/2) R.

So, ΔT = ΔU / (n Cv) ) = (-145 J) / ( (5/2) * 8.314 J/mol K )

Calculating denominator: (5/2) * 8.314 ≈ 20.785 J/(mol K).

So, ΔT = (-145) / 20.785 ≈ -6.98 K.

Wait, that's approximately -6.98 K. Looking at the options, option H is -7.0 K, which is close. So the temperature change would be approximately -7 K.

But wait, wait, why is ΔU negative? Because the system is doing work and also losing heat, right?

Because the system is losing heat (q is negative), and doing work (W is negative), so ΔU is the sum of both. So yes, the internal energy is decreasing.

But wait, the question is about the temperature change. So the temperature change is ΔT = (ΔU) / (n Cv). But wait, for diatomic gases, Cv is (5/2) R per mole, so that's correct.

So, putting in the numbers:

ΔU = 65 J (heat) + (-210 J) (work done by the system) = -145 J.

So, ΔT = (-145 J) / ( (5/2) * 8.314 J/mol K ) )

Calculating denominator again: (5/2) * 8.314 ≈ 20.785 J/(mol K).

Thus, ΔT = (-145) / 20.785 ≈ -6.98 K.

So, the temperature change is approximately -7 K. Looking at the options, option H is -7.0 K.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: -275J — no, that's not a temperature change.

B: -13.5K — too small.

C:13.5K — positive, which doesn't make sense, because the internal energy is negative.

D:7.0K — positive, but negative.

E:65K — way too big.

F:145J — no, no.

G:210K — no.

H: -7.0K — yes.

So, the correct answer should be H: -7.0 K.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Am I sure about the sign of ΔU?

Because the system does 210 J work, which means the system's internal energy decreases by 210 J. Also, the system loses 65 J of heat, so the internal energy decreases by another 65 J. So, total ΔU is -275 J, which is what I calculated earlier.

Wait, but wait, I thought about the formula, and now I'm getting the same result. So the temperature change is -7 K. So the correct option is H.

To calculate the temperature change of 1 mole of a diatomic gas, we use the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta U = q + w
\]

Here:
- \( q = 65 \, \text{J} \) (heat absorbed by the system, positive if heat is added),
- \( w = -210 \, \text{J} \) (work done by the system, negative if work is done on the system).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta U = 65 + (-210) = -145 \, \text{J}
\]

The change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) is negative, indicating that the system's internal energy decreases. For a diatomic gas, the molar heat capacity at constant volume (\( C_v \)) is \( \frac{5}{2}R \), where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \). Thus:

\[
\Delta U = n C_v \Delta T
\]

Since \( n = 1 \, \text{mol} \):

\[
\Delta T = \frac{\Delta U}{C_v} = \frac{-145}{\frac{5}{2} \cdot 8.314} = \frac{-145}{20.785} \approx -6.98 \, \text{K}
\]

The temperature change is approximately \( -7.0 \, \text{K} \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**H: -7.0 K**
