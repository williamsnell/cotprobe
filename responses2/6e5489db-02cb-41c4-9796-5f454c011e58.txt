Question:

A field is in the shape of a trapezoid. The shorter base of the trapezoid is 130 yards long and the longer base is 390 yards long. The distance between the two bases is 75 yards. What is the area of the field?

Options:

A: 24,375 yards^2
B: 34,125 yards^2
C: 43,875 yards^2
D: 48,750 yards^2
E: 9,750 yards^2
F: 29,250 yards^2
G: 58,500 yards^2
H: 19,500 yards^2
I: 14,625 yards^2
J: 39,000 yards^2

Okay, so I've got this trapezoid problem here, and I need to find the area. Let me think through it step by step. I remember that the formula for the area of a trapezoid is something like average of the two bases multiplied by the height. Hmm, right, so the formula is ((base1 + base2)/2) * height. 

Wait, let me make sure. Yeah, I think that's right. The two bases are the parallel sides, and the height is the distance between them. The shorter base is 130 yards, and the longer one is 390 yards. The height is given as 75 yards. Okay, so plugging those numbers in.

So, first I'll add the two bases: 130 plus 390. Let me do that. 130 plus 390... 130 plus 300 is 430, and then plus 90 more is 520. So, the sum of the bases is 520 yards.

Next, I need the average of the two bases. That would be 520 divided by 2. Let me calculate that. 520 divided by 2 is 260. So the average base is 260 yards.

Now, the height is 75 yards. So the area is 260 multiplied by 75. Let me compute that. Hmm, 260 times 75. Breaking it down: 200 times 75 is 15,000, and 60 times 75 is 4,500. Adding those together gives 15,000 plus 4,500, which is 19,500. So the area should be 19,500 square yards.

Looking at the options, I see option H is 19,500 yards squared. So that must be the right answer.

The area of a trapezoid is calculated by averaging the lengths of the two bases and multiplying by the height. 

**Formula:** 
Area = (base1 + base2) / 2 * height

**Given:**
- base1 = 130 yards
- base2 = 390 yards
- height = 75 yards

**Calculation:**
1. Sum of bases: 130 + 390 = 520 yards
2. Average of bases: 520 / 2 = 260 yards
3. Area: 260 * 75 = 19,500 square yards

**Answer:** H: 19,500 yardsÂ²

Answer: H
