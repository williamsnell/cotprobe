Question:

A large city was interested in annexing part of the surrounding county. In a survey conducted by the local newspaper, 58 percent of respondents said they were against the annexation. During the actual vote, not all eligible voters voted, but 56 percent of the respondents voted against the annexation. Which of the following best describes the difference in the percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the vote itself?

Options:

A: It is the difference caused by the undercoverage of certain groups in the population.
B: It is the difference between the statistic and the truth due to use of a random sample.
C: It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by a biased question.
D: It is an example of response bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to respond to a survey question in a certain way.
E: It is the difference caused by the overrepresentation of certain groups in the population.
F: It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two identical samples.
G: It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.
H: It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples.
I: It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about statistics and surveys. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a large city wanted to annex part of the surrounding county. They did a survey where 58% of respondents opposed the annexation. But during the actual vote, not all eligible voters voted, and only 56% of the respondents voted against it. They're asking what best describes the difference between the newspaper poll and the actual vote.

Hmm, so the key points are: a survey with 58% and actual vote with 56%. The actual vote didn't include everyone, so some didn't vote. But the question is about the difference between the two percentages. I think the main thing here is the difference between a sample statistic and the actual population parameter, right?

Wait, but the newspaper survey was a sample, and the actual vote is another sample, but maybe with some non-response or different selection. Or perhaps the actual vote had more people or less, but the question isn't about that.

The question is about the difference between the two percentages. So, when the newspaper did the survey, they probably had a certain sample. But when the vote happened, the actual eligible voters might have been different. So the percentages are from two different samples.

Wait, but the options are about differences between the two statistics. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: It's the difference between the statistic and the truth due to using a random sample. That makes sense because if it's a random sample, there's a chance the actual population might differ. But wait, the newspaper's sample and the actual vote's sample might have different characteristics, so the percentages could be different.

Alternatively, option E is about nonresponse bias, which is when people don't respond and their characteristics affect the results. But in this case, the difference is between a sample and the actual vote, which is a different sample. So E isn't about the difference between the two samples but about nonresponse.

Option C talks about a biased question causing a systematic difference between a statistic and parameter. But the question doesn't mention the question being biased. It's just about the difference between percentages.

Option B says it's a difference due to using a random sample. That sounds plausible because if the sample was not random, then the results might not reflect the actual population. But the newspaper's survey is a random sample, and the actual vote might not be, because it didn't include everyone. But the question is about the difference between the two percentages. So the difference is because the two samples are different in some way.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the newspaper poll (statistic) and the actual vote (another statistic). So, the difference is due to the fact that the two samples are different. So perhaps the difference is because of the samples being different.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B suggests it's due to the use of a random sample. So, if the newspaper conducted a random sample and the actual vote was a different sample (maybe non-random), then the difference is due to the random sample method. But in this case, I'm not sure if the actual vote was a different sample. Maybe the actual vote was a different sample because some eligible voters didn't vote, which could mean the sample isn't as good as the newspaper's.

Wait, another thought: The newspaper's sample is a random sample, while the actual vote is a non-random sample (because not all eligible voters voted). So the difference is between a random sample and a non-random sample, leading to a difference in percentages. But the question is about the difference between the statistic from the newspaper (random sample) and the actual vote (which is another statistic, perhaps a non-random one).

Alternatively, perhaps the actual vote is a random sample of eligible voters, but that's not stated. The question isn't clear on that. But the key is that the two samples are different. So the difference is about the fact that it's from two different samples, not necessarily a random vs. non-random.

Wait, but the question is about the difference in percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the actual vote. That is, the same variable but different samples. So, for example, the newspaper's sample may have a certain average, and the actual vote's sample has a different one. The difference is because it's from two different samples.

So the options have to do with whether it's a random sample, non-random, etc., or a difference between a statistic and a parameter.

Option B says it's the difference due to the use of a random sample. If the newspaper used a random sample, but the actual vote didn't, then the difference is because of the different sample. But if the actual vote is a different kind of sample (maybe non-random), then the difference is due to that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about the difference between the newspaper's poll and the actual vote. Both are percentages, but from different samples. So the difference isn't due to a bias in the question or the way the question was asked (if that's what E is about). It's about the different samples.

So the difference is between two different statistics, each from different samples. That's about the difference between the same statistic computed from two different samples. But in this case, the two samples are different, so it's more about the difference between two statistics from different samples.

Wait, the options are:

A: undercoverage of certain groups.

B: difference due to random sample.

C: parameter vs statistic.

D: response bias.

E: nonresponse.

F: same statistics.

G: systematic difference due to nonrandom selection.

H: difference due to nonresponse.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the two percentages, which are both statistics, each from a different sample. So the difference is because the samples are different.

So the difference is because the samples are different, which could be due to different selection methods. So option H is about nonresponse bias, which is about nonresponse. But in this case, the two samples (newspaper and actual vote) are different in how they're collected.

Wait, but the actual vote is the same as the newspaper's sample except perhaps for nonresponse. But the question is about the difference between the two samples.

Wait, the two samples are both from the same population (voters in the city), but the newspaper's survey included only a subset, and the actual vote included a different subset because not all eligible voters voted. So the two samples are different.

So the difference in percentages is due to the fact that the two samples are different. So option B says it's because of the use of a random sample. But the newspaper used a random sample, but the actual vote's sample is not random (since not all eligible voters voted). So the difference is because of different samples, not due to the sample method.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the two percentages. So the answer is about the difference between two statistics from different samples.

So which option describes that? Let's look at the options again.

Option B says it's due to the use of a random sample. Option H says it's due to nonresponse bias.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is because the actual vote is a different sample than the newspaper's, which is a random sample.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the two percentages. So it's the difference between the same statistic (percentage) computed from two different samples (newspaper and actual vote). So it's about the difference between two statistics, each from different samples.

So, the difference is due to the fact that the two samples are different, not because of the sample method. So the difference isn't because the sample was random (since the actual vote's sample is different), but because it's different samples.

Wait, but the options:

Option B says it's due to the use of a random sample. H is nonresponse bias.

So, the newspaper and the actual vote are from different samples. The difference is the same statistic computed from two different samples, so the answer is H: it's the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples. Wait, but the options are:

Looking again at the options:

A: undercoverage.

B: random sample.

C: statistic vs parameter.

D: response bias.

E: nonresponse.

F: same statistics computed from same samples.

G: nonrandom selection.

H: different samples.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the two percentages, which are from two different samples. So the answer is H: difference between same statistics computed from two different samples. Because H is talking about two different samples, not the same.

So, the newspaper and the actual vote are from different samples, so the difference is due to the fact that they're different samples. So, H is the correct option.
</think>

The question asks about the difference in percentages obtained from two different samples: a newspaper poll and an actual vote. The newspaper used a random sample, while the actual vote likely included non-random voters (those who did not vote). The difference is not due to the random sample method but rather to the fact that the two samples are different. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** suggests the difference is due to the use of a random sample. However, the actual vote's sample is not random, so this is incorrect.
- **Option H** correctly identifies the difference as arising from the fact that the two samples are different, not due to randomness or nonresponse bias.

Thus, the correct answer is about the difference between two different samples.

**Answer: H**
