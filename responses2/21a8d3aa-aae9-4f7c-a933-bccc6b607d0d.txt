Okay, so I've got this question here about capacitance needed to resonate a coil. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says: How much capacitance is required to resonate a 0.001 mH coil at 2 MHz. The options are various pF values. I remember that in electronics, resonance frequency is given by a formula involving inductance and capacitance. Oh right, the formula is something like ω = 1/√(LC), where ω is the angular frequency. And frequency f is ω/(2π), so maybe I can rearrange that.

So the formula for resonant frequency is f = (1/(2π√(LC))). I think that's right. Let me double-check. Yes, angular frequency ω is 2πf, so substituting that in, ω = 2πf, so 2πf = 1/√(LC). Squaring both sides, (2πf)^2 = 1/(LC), so LC = 1/( (2πf)^2 ). Therefore, C = 1/( L (2πf)^2 ). So I need to find the capacitance C.

Wait, the inductance L is given as 0.001 mH. Oh, mH stands for milliHenrys. 1 mH is 1e-3 H. So 0.001 mH is 1e-6 H. So L is 1e-6 H. Got that.

And the frequency f is 2 MHz, which is 2e6 Hz. So plug those into the equation.

Let me compute the denominator first. (2πf)^2. So 2 * pi * 2e6.

Calculating that: 2 * 3.1416 ≈ 6.2832. Multiply by 2e6: 6.2832 * 2e6 = 12.5664e6. Then square that? Wait, (12.5664e6)^2 = (12.5664)^2 * (1e6)^2. Let's compute that.

12.5664 squared: 12^2 is 144, 0.5664^2 is about 0.321, and cross terms. Wait, 12.5664 is roughly 4 * 3.1416, which is 4π. So (4π)^2 is 16π². π² is about 9.8696, so 16 * 9.8696 ≈ 157.9136. So 12.5664^2 is approximately 157.91, and (1e6)^2 is 1e12. So the denominator (2πf)^2 is 157.91 * 1e12 = 1.5791e14.

Wait, not quite. Let me re-calculate. (2π f )^2 = (2 * pi * f )^2 = (2 pi f )^2.

Wait, 2 pi times f is 2 * 3.1416 * 2e6 = approximately 12.5664e6. Squaring that: (12.5664e6)^2 = (1.25664e7)^2. Wait, no, 2e6 is 2,000,000. So 2 pi * 2e6 is approximately 12,566,400. So 12,566,400 squared is (1.25664e7)^2 = 1.578e14.

So the denominator is 1.578e14. Now, the numerator is 1 (divided by the denominator). So C = 1 / (1.578e14 * L )

But wait, L is 1e-6 H, right? So plugging in:

C = 1 / ( (2πf)^2 * L )

Wait, no: the formula is C = 1/( L * (2πf)^2 ). So substituting in the numbers:

C = 1/( (1e-6 H) * (1.578e14 ) )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because 1e-6 times 1.578e14 would be (1e-6)*(1.578e14) = 1.578e8. So C would be 1 / (1.578e8 ) → which is approximately 6.33e-9 F. Because 1e9 is 1 G, so 6.33e-9 is 6.33 nF.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Compute f = 2 MHz = 2e6 Hz.

Compute 2 pi f = 2 * pi * 2e6 = 4 pi e6 Hz → approximately 12.5664e6 Hz.

Square that: (12.5664e6 )^2 = (1.25664e7 )^2 → 1.25664^2 is about 1.579, so 1.579e14.

So denominator is 1.579e14 * L, where L is 1e-6 H. So denominator = 1.579e14 * 1e-6 = 1.579e8.

So 1 divided by 1.579e8 is approximately 6.33e-9 F, which is 6.33 nF.

Looking at the options, option F is 6,330 pF, which is 6.33 nF. So that's option F.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the units. Oh wait, the options are in pF. Oh no, I think I made a mistake. Oh wait, wait, wait! Because I think I confused pico and nano.

Wait, 1 pF is 1e-12 F, so 6,330 pF is 6.33e-9 F (6.33 nF). So 6,330 pF equals 6.33 nF.

So according to my calculation, the capacitance needed is 6.33e-9 F, which is 6,330 pF. That's option F. So the answer should be F.

To determine the capacitance required to resonate a 0.001 mH coil at 2 MHz, we use the resonance formula for an LC circuit:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]

Rearranging for \(C\):

\[
C = \frac{1}{(2\pi f)^2 L}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- Inductance \(L = 0.001 \, \text{mH} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H}\)
- Frequency \(f = 2 \, \text{MHz} = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\)

### Step 2: Calculate \(2\pi f\)
\[
2\pi f = 2 \times \pi \times 2 \times 10^6 = 4\pi \times 10^6 \approx 12.5664 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}
\]

### Step 3: Square \(2\pi f\)
\[
(2\pi f)^2 = (12.5664 \times 10^6)^2 = (1.25664 \times 10^7)^2 = 1.578 \times 10^{14}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the capacitance \(C\)
\[
C = \frac{1}{(2\pi f)^2 L} = \frac{1}{(1.578 \times 10^{14}) \times (1 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

\[
C = \frac{1}{1.578 \times 10^8} \approx 6.33 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{F} = 6.33 \, \text{nF} = 6,330 \, \text{pF}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The calculated capacitance \(6,330 \, \text{pF}\) corresponds to **Option F**.
