Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cell potentials. I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but let me think this through step by step.

The problem says: Calculate the voltage of the cell Fe^2+ | H^+ || H2 if the iron half-cell is at standard conditions but the H+ concentration is 0.001M. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in electrochemistry, when you have a concentration cell, the cell potential is zero. But wait, no, concentration cells have different concentrations of their ions, so the cell potential should not be zero. Oh right, but in this case, the Fe^2+ is at standard conditions, which is 1M for Fe^3+ maybe? Or wait, the way the question is phrased, it's Fe^+2? Oh, wait no, the question says Fe^+2 as the anode or cathode? Or maybe it's about Fe^2+ as the metal.

Wait, the cell notation is written as Fe^+2 | H+ || H2. So I think the Fe^2+ is the anode and H+ is the cathode? Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, no, wait, in electrochemical terms, the side with higher reduction potential will be the cathode. Let me think about standard reduction potentials.

The standard reduction potential for Fe^2+ + 2e^- → Fe(s) is about 0.44 V. For H+ + e^- → (1/2)H2(g), the standard potential is 0.00 V because it's the standard hydrogen electrode. Wait, but wait, actually, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is the reference point where the potential is 0 V. So if the H+ is in 0.001M solution, the SHE is 0 V, but the H+ concentration affects the potential.

Wait, no, the general formula for calculating E for a half-cell is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q. Or wait, the Nernst equation. For the hydrogen electrode, the equation is E = E° + (0.0592 V)/(1) * log (1/[H+]) if the reaction is H+ + e^- → ½ H2. Wait, no, wait, I think the Nernst equation for the reduction reaction is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log( [oxidized]/[reduced] ). Hmm, I think I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the standard hydrogen electrode is expressed as H+ + e^- → ½ H2(g), and its standard potential is 0 V. But when you have H+ at a different concentration, the potential changes. The actual potential E for the H+ half-cell is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log [oxidized]/[reduced]. But wait, the oxidized form is H+ here, right? So the oxidation is H+ losing an electron to become H2(g). So the reduction reaction is the reverse.

Wait, no, the Nernst equation is usually written for the reduction. So for the H+ → H2 half-cell, the equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log [H+]. Because when the reaction is written as H+ + e^- → ½ H2, the oxidation is H+ → H2 (which is the reverse of the reduction), so the Nernst equation for the reduction is E = E° + (0.0592/1) * log(1/[H+])?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard hydrogen electrode. The SHE is H+ + e^- → ½ H2(g), E° = 0 V. For any other concentration of H+, the potential changes. The actual potential E for the half-cell is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log ( [oxidized]/[reduced] ). But the oxidized form in this case is H2, and the reduced form is H2. Wait, no, wait, the oxidation is the reverse of the reduction. So for the reduction reaction, [oxidized] is H+ and [reduced] is H2? No, wait, no. The reduction is H+ + e^- → ½ H2(g). The oxidation would be H2 → 2 H+ + 2 e^-. So for the Nernst equation, when considering the reduction, the concentrations are [H+] and [H2 (g)], but since H2 is a gas, its concentration is in terms of pressure. But in the question, the half-cell is written as H2, so maybe that's considered 1 atm? Or perhaps, in the context of the problem, since it's written as H2, it's taken as 1 M? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps in this case, the Nernst equation for the H+ half-cell is E = 0 V - (0.0592/1) * log ( [H+] ), because the reaction is H+ + e^- → ½ H2, and the Nernst equation for the reduction would be E = E° - (0.0592/1) * log ( [H+] ).

Wait, no, wait, I think the formula is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log ( [oxidized] / [reduced] ), but the [oxidized] is H+ and [reduced] is H2. But since H2 is a gas, its concentration is in terms of pressure. At standard conditions, H2 is 1 atm, but in this problem the H+ is 0.001 M. So the Nernst equation would be E = E° - (0.0592) * log ( [H+] ), because [oxidized] is H+ and [reduced] is H2, which is 1 atm (so 1 in the denominator). Wait, no. Let me clarify. The general formula is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log ( [oxidized]/[reduced] ), but wait, for the reaction H+ + e^- → ½ H2, the [oxidized] is H2 (which is 1 atm) and [reduced] is H+ (0.001 M).

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me take a step back.

The Nernst equation for the hydrogen electrode (H+ → H2) is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log ( [oxidized]/[reduced] ). But what are oxidized and reduced here?

In the reaction H+ + e^- → ½ H2(g), the oxidized form is H2 (g), and the reduced form is H+ (aq). So the Nernst equation for this half-cell would be E = E° - (0.0592/1) * log ( [H+] / [H2] )

But wait, the [H2] is in terms of pressure, and if it's at standard conditions, it's 1 atm. So [H2] = 1 atm. So in the equation, it's log ( [H+] / 1 ) → log [H+].

So E = E° - (0.0592) * log [H+]

Now, the standard hydrogen electrode is E° = 0 V. So E = -0.0592 * log [H+]

But wait, in this case, [H+] is 0.001 M. So log(0.001) is log(1e-3) which is -3.

So E = -0.0592 * (-3) → 0.1776 volts.

Wait, so the E for the H+ | H2 half-cell is 0.1776 V?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The standard hydrogen electrode is E° = 0 V. When the solution is at a different concentration, the E is given by E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log [H+].

So with n=1, E = 0 - 0.0592 * log(0.001) → 0.0592 * log(1000) → since log(1e-3) is -3, so 0.0592 * (-3) → negative? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log [H+]. So substituting, E = 0 - (0.0592) * log (0.001) → log(0.001) is -3 → 0.0592 * (-3) = -0.1776 V.

Wait, but wait, that gives E = -0.1776 V. But that can't be right because the H+ is 0.001, which is more negative than standard (which is H+ at 1M). So the E would be lower (more negative) than 0 V.

Wait, so the H+ | H2 half-cell has E = 0.1776 V? Because [H+] is 0.001, which is 1e-3. So log(1e-3) is -3. So the equation is E = 0 - (0.0592) * (-3) → 0.1776 V.

Wait, but wait, the Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q, where Q is the reaction quotient. The reaction is H+ + e^- → ½ H2(g). So Q = [H2] / ( [H+] ), but [H2] is 1 atm (standard), so Q = 1 / ( [H+] ).

So E = 0 - (0.0592/1) * log (1/[H+]) → because Q is [H2]/ [H+] → 1/[H+].

So substituting [H+] = 0.001 M → 1/0.001 = 1000 → log(1000) = 3.

So E = 0 - 0.0592 * 3 → E = -0.1776 V.

Wait, that makes sense? Because H+ is higher than standard (0.001 is lower than 1, so 1M is higher). So the E of the H+ half-cell is negative, which would make sense because it's less reactive than SHE.

Wait, no, wait. The standard hydrogen electrode is at 0 V, so if the solution is more acidic (lower [H+]), the E would be negative. Because the reaction H+ + e^- → ½ H2 has a lower potential than SHE, so it's less likely to occur, which is why E is negative.

Wait, so if the E is -0.1776 V, then that's the potential of the H+ | H2 half-cell.

Now, what about the Fe^2+ | Fe^3+ half-cell? Oh wait, the question says Fe^2+ is the anode. So we need to find the standard reduction potentials for the two half-cells.

The standard reduction potential for Fe^2+ + 2e^- → Fe(s) is E° = 0.44 V.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the standard reduction potential for Fe^2+ is +0.44 V. So that's the E° for the Fe^2+ | Fe(s) half-cell.

Now, the overall cell potential is E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode.

Wait, but wait, the anode is where oxidation happens. So in the cell notation, it's Fe^2+ | H+ || H2. So the Fe^2+ is on the left, meaning it's the anode, because it's being oxidized. Wait no, wait, in cell notation, the anode is where oxidation occurs. But the Fe^2+ is written as Fe^2+ | H+ ... So I'm a bit confused about this.

Wait, okay, the cell notation is Fe^2+ | H+ || H2. So the anode is the Fe^2+ | H+ side, and the cathode is the H+ | H2 side.

Wait, wait. No, wait, actually, the notation is read from left to right. The left half-cell is Fe^2+ | H+ (the anode), and the right side is H+ | H2 (the cathode). Because in a standard notation, the anode is on the left, and the cathode is on the right.

Wait, but wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think: the cell notation is written with the anode on the left and the cathode on the right. The direction of the electrons is from left to right. So the Fe^2+ | H+ is the left (anode) and the H+ | H2 is the right (cathode).

Wait, but wait, the anode is where oxidation occurs, and the cathode is where reduction occurs. So the Fe^2+ is being oxidized, and the H+ is being reduced to H2.

So, the Fe^2+ is being oxidized: Fe^2+ → Fe^3+ + e^-. So the E for the Fe^2+ | Fe^3+ half-cell is E° = 0.44 V (since it's the reduction potential; wait, no, the Fe^2+ | Fe(s) is E° = 0.44 V for the reduction. So the oxidation would have E° = -0.44 V. Because the reverse reaction's E is negative.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The standard reduction potentials are given as the E for the reduction. So the Fe^2+ | Fe(s) has E° = 0.44 V. That means the reduction reaction is Fe^2+ + 2e^- → Fe(s), E = 0.44 V.

So, the oxidation reaction is the reverse: Fe(s) → Fe^2+ + 2e^-. The E for this oxidation is the negative of the reduction potential, so E°_oxidation = -0.44 V.

Similarly, the E° for the H+ | H2 half-cell is E° = 0.00 V (reduction), because H2 is the product. So the oxidation would have E° = -0.00 V.

So the E_cell is E_cathode - E_anode.

E_cathode is the E for the reduction of the cathode (H+ | H2) which is 0 V. E_anode is the E for the reduction of the Fe^2+ | Fe(s), which is 0.44 V. But wait, wait, no. E_anode is the E for the anode's reduction, but the E for the anode as a reduction is 0.44 V. But since the anode is undergoing oxidation (which has a lower potential than the SHE), the actual E_anode for the anode half-reaction is lower, so the anode's E is E_anode_red = 0.44 V. But the E for the anode in the E_cell formula is the E for the oxidation, which is the negative of E_red. Or wait, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the cell potential is E_cathode (reduction) minus E_anode (reduction). But the E_anode is actually the potential at which the reaction is happening as oxidation. So for the Fe^2+ | Fe(s) half-cell, which is the anode, the reaction is oxidation: Fe^2+ → Fe^3+ + e^-. So the E for this reaction (as oxidation) is -0.44 V.

So, E_cell = E_cathode (reduction) - E_anode (reduction).

But wait, the E_anode is the E for the reduction of the anode, which is 0.44 V. So,

E_cell = E_cathode (0 V) - E_anode (0.44 V) → 0 - 0.44 → -0.44 V.

Wait, that would mean the cell potential is negative. But when the cell is operating, it will cause a current to flow if E_cell is positive. But in this case, the H+ is more concentrated (0.001M) than standard (1M), which suggests that the H+ half-cell is less reactive. So the Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ half-cell has a higher E (so it's more likely to oxidize), and the H+ | H2 is less likely to occur, so the cell will have a lower E_cell. So the cell will act as a cathode and anode, but since E_cell is negative, it's not spontaneous. Wait, but the cell notation is Fe^+2 | H+ || H2, so the Fe^2+ is on the left, so is the anode.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it this way: the Fe^2+ is the anode, and the H+ is the cathode.

The Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ half-cell's E°_red is 0.44 V, so the E_anode (as anode, which is oxidation) is -0.44 V.

The H+ | H2 half-cell's E°_red is 0 V, so the E_cathode is 0 V.

So E_cell = 0 V - (-0.44 V) → 0.44 V.

Wait, but that can't be right because in reality, the cell's potential is negative? Or wait, maybe I messed up the E values.

Wait, another approach: the cell is Fe^2+ | H+ || H2. So the anode is Fe^2+ (oxidation) and the cathode is H+ (reduction).

The E for the Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ half-cell is 0.44 V (reduction), so oxidation will have E = -0.44 V.

The E for the H+ | H2 half-cell is 0 V (reduction), so oxidation is -0 V, but in reality, the reaction in the H+ half-cell is H+ + e^- → ½ H2, so the E for this half-reaction (as oxidation) is -0.00 V.

Wait, but the cell potential is calculated as E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode.

E_cathode is the E of the cathode (reduction) which is 0 V.

E_anode is the E of the anode (reduction) which is 0.44 V. But wait, the anode is undergoing oxidation, so the E for the anode's reduction is 0.44 V, but the E for the oxidation (reverse) is -0.44 V.

So, E_cell = 0 V (cathode) - 0.44 V (anode as reduction) → -0.44 V.

But wait, negative cell potential would mean the cell is non-spontaneous, but since the H+ is less concentrated than standard, the cell would have a negative E, meaning it will act as an anode if the E_cell is positive.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the cell notation again. The Fe^2+ | H+ side is the anode, and the H+ | H2 side is the cathode. So the overall cell potential is E_cathode - E_anode.

E_anode is the E of the Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ half-cell, which is 0.44 V. E_cathode is 0 V. So E_cell = 0 - 0.44 → -0.44 V.

But wait, that would imply that the Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ is the cathode and the H+ | H2 is the anode, but that can't be right because the E_anode is higher than E_cathode, so the cell would not proceed. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, the Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ is the anode, and the H+ | H2 is the cathode. Because the Fe^2+ is being oxidized (so it's the anode), and the H+ is being reduced (so it's the cathode).

So, the Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ half-cell has an E°_red of 0.44 V. So the oxidation (reverse) has E = -0.44 V.

The H+ | H2 half-cell has an E°_red of 0.00 V. So the reduction (as written) is E = 0.00 V.

So the cell potential is E_cell = E_cathode (0.00) - E_anode (-0.44) → 0.00 - (-0.44) = 0.44 V.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the Fe^2+ | Fe^2+ is the anode, so its E is -0.44, and the cathode is H+ | H2, which is 0.00. So E_cell is 0.00 - (-0.44) = 0.44 V.

So the cell potential is positive, which means the cell will function as written.

So the cell's potential is 0.44 V.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, I thought E_cell was negative, but that was incorrect. It should be 0.44 V.

So the correct answer is option B, 0.44 V.
</think>

To calculate the voltage of the cell with the notation **Fe²⁺ | H⁺ || H₂**, we analyze the two half-reactions and their standard reduction potentials.

### Step 1: Identify the half-reactions
1. **Anode (oxidation)**: The Fe²⁺ ion is oxidized to Fe³⁺:
   \[
   \text{Fe}^{2+} \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + e^-
   \]
   The standard reduction potential for Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Fe(s) is **E° = 0.44 V**. Since this is an oxidation, the E for this half-reaction is **E°_oxidation = -0.44 V**.

2. **Cathode (reduction)**: The H⁺ ion is reduced to H₂:
   \[
   \text{H}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \text{H}_2(g)
   \]
   The standard reduction potential for H⁺ | H₂ is **E° = 0.00 V**.

### Step 2: Calculate the cell potential
The cell potential is given by:
\[
E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E_{\text{cell}} = 0.00 \, \text{V} - (-0.44 \, \text{V}) = 0.44 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The cell potential is positive, indicating that the reaction proceeds spontaneously as written. The magnitude of the cell potential corresponds to the magnitude of the voltage.

### Final Answer
The voltage of the cell is **0.44 V**.
