Question:

A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. " The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?

Options:

A: The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.
B: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.
C: The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.
D: The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.
E: The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.
F: The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.
G: The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.
H: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
I: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.
J: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a lease agreement and specific performance. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the situation is about a farmer leasing a 40-acre tract to a tenant for seven years. The lease has some covenants about paying rent every month and keeping the building in good repair. But there's also a provision where the tenant can buy 10 acres for $150k at the end of the lease. Before signing, the farmer promised to survey the land. Now, during the last year of the lease, the tenant exercises this option by buying 10 acres. But when they tell the farmer, the farmer says he never had the survey done. The tenant brings suit for specific performance. The question is what the farmer's best defense would be.

Looking at the options, I need to determine which defense applies here. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: The option was unenforceable because it wasn't in the written lease. I think the lease explicitly includes this option. So, A is probably not right.

Option B: The option agreement is unenforceable under the parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule says that a prior agreement (like a promise) doesn't affect the enforceability of a contract that's written. So, since the lease is written, the parol evidence doesn't affect the tenant's ability to exercise the option. So B might not be correct.

Option C: The tenant didn't exercise the option within the term. The lease says the option ends on the termination of the lease. The lease was signed on February 15, 2007, and the tenant exercised on the same day (end of the lease). So C seems correct. Alternatively, maybe it's a question of whether the lease term counted the same day as termination. But in this case, the lease term ended on the same day as the option's expiration. So the lease term's last day is the day the option is exercisable. The tenant exercised on the same day the option was due, so the option was exercised within the term.

Wait, but the lease's term is from February 15, 2000 to February 15, 2007. The tenant exercises on February 15, 2007, which is the same day as the termination. So yes, it's within the term. So C is correct.

Option D: The tenant didn't pay the rent. The lease says there's a rent covenant, but the problem is that the tenant didn't exercise the option, so the rent hasn't been paid yet. But if the option is exercised, the lease's obligations (like the rent) are due to be performed. So if the tenant hasn't yet paid the rent, the farmer's defense that he never surveyed would prevent him from performing the lease obligations. But the question is about the specific performance, which is about fulfilling the contract. Since the tenant didn't exercise the option, the rent hasn't yet been paid. So D's about not paying the rent, which is a separate matter. The question is about the specific performance, not whether the tenant is required to pay. So D might not be the best defense here. But I'm not sure yet.

Option E: The farmer's promise to survey was an unfulfilled condition precedent. Wait, this is about a condition precedent. A condition precedent is something that must be met for a condition to be enforceable. For example, a promise to survey must be fulfilled before the tenant can exercise their option. So the farmer's promise is a condition precedent. If the tenant didn't fulfill it, the option is unenforceable. But in this case, the tenant exercised the option despite the farmer's failure to survey. So the farmer's condition precedent was unfulfilled, making the option unenforceable. But wait, the question is about the farmer's defense. If the option is unenforceable, then the tenant can't bring suit. So E is a possible correct answer.

But wait, the lease says the farmer promised to survey. So the condition precedent is that he did survey before the tenant can exercise the option. So if the farmer didn't survey, then the condition precedent was unfulfilled, making the option unenforceable. So if the farmer's condition precedent was unfulfilled, the option is unenforceable. So E would be correct.

But let me look at other options.

Option F: Farmer didn't consent to the tenant's exercise. The wording says the farmer promised to survey. So that's a condition precedent, not consent. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch was a material breach. The lease doesn't say anything about the tenant's actions, like building an irrigation ditch. The lease's covenants are about paying rent and maintaining the premises. So G is not applicable.

Option H: The description of the property was too indefinite. The property is 40 acres, which is a definite description. So H is not correct.

Option I: The farmer's failure to survey excused further obligations. If the condition precedent was unfulfilled, then the tenant can't proceed. So I's suggesting the failure to survey excused further obligations, but that's not correct. The farmer's failure to survey was a condition precedent, not an excuse for not fulfilling future obligations. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration. The lease includes a condition precedent (the survey) and a condition of performance (the rent). Separate consideration is when both parties have equal consideration. The farmer is providing a survey (condition precedent) and the tenant is paying rent (condition of performance). Since both are present, J is incorrect.

So, the question is whether the option is unenforceable. The two main points are whether the option is unenforceable because it's in the lease or because the condition precedent was unfulfilled.

In the scenario, the tenant exercised the option even though the farmer didn't survey. That means the condition precedent was unfulfilled, making the option unenforceable. So the farmer can't enforce the option, so the tenant can't sue for specific performance because the option doesn't exist. So E would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The condition precedent is that the farmer must survey before the tenant can exercise the option. So if the farmer's promise is a condition precedent, then the absence of the survey (which the farmer didn't fulfill) makes the condition precedent unenforceable. So the option is unenforceable, meaning the tenant can't sue. So E is correct.

But also, the option is unenforceable because the condition precedent was unfulfilled. So E would be the right answer.

Alternatively, the parol evidence rule (option B) says that a prior promise doesn't affect the enforceability of a contract written. But in this case, the lease is written, so the parol evidence doesn't matter. The fact that the farmer promised to survey doesn't affect the lease's enforceability.

So the farmer's best defense is that the option is unenforceable because the condition precedent was unfulfilled (E). Alternatively, if the option is unenforceable, the tenant can't sue. So E is correct.

Wait, but Option H says the property's description was too indefinite to allow remedy. But the property is 40 acres, which is definite. So H is wrong.

So the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around a lease agreement where the tenant exercised an option to purchase land, despite the farmer failing to survey the land. The key issue is whether the option is unenforceable due to the farmer's failure to fulfill a condition precedent. 

**Option A** is incorrect because the lease explicitly includes the option, so it is enforceable. **Option B** is incorrect because the parol evidence rule doesn't affect the enforceability of a written lease. **Option C** is correct because the tenant exercised the option within the term of the lease. **Option D** is incorrect because the absence of rent payment isn't a separate issue; it's a matter of fulfilling contract obligations. **Option E** is correct because the farmer's failure to fulfill the condition precedent (serving the survey) makes the option unenforceable, preventing the tenant from bringing suit. **Option F** is incorrect because the condition precedent wasn't unfulfilled. **Option G** is incorrect because the lease doesn't mention a breach of the property. **Option H** is incorrect due to the definite description of the land. **Option I** is incorrect because the failure to survey wasn't an excuse. **Option J** is incorrect as there's no separate consideration issue.

Thus, the farmer's best defense is that the option is unenforceable due to the farmer's failure to fulfill the condition precedent.
