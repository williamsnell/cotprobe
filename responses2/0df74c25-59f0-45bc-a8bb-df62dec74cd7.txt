Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to solve the equation x³ + 2x = 10 using the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm, I remember that the Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical method for finding roots of a real-valued function. So, the basic idea is to start with an initial guess and then refine that guess using the function and its derivative until it converges to the root.

Let me write down the equation again: x³ + 2x = 10. Wait, I can also write this as f(x) = x³ + 2x -10 = 0. So the function f(x) is zero when x is the root. I need to find the root of this function.

The Newton-Raphson formula is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). So first, I need to compute the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x) = 3x² + 2.

The next thing is to choose an initial guess, x₀. How should I choose it? Well, maybe I can look at the options given. Let's see the options: A is 1.4142 (sqrt(2)), B is 1.8474, C is 3.1416, D is 2.2361, E is 3.3211, F is 1.6180, G is 1.2321, H is 2.4567, I is 2.7183, J is 2.0000. Hmm, these are all numbers around 1.2 to 3.3, so maybe the root is around there.

Wait, let's think about the function f(x) = x³ + 2x -10. Let's evaluate f at several points to get an idea where the root is.

Let me compute f(1): 1 + 2 -10 = -7.

f(2): 8 +4 -10=2.

So between x=1 and x=2, the function goes from negative to positive, so there's a root between 1 and 2.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is 2.2361, which is about sqrt(5), which is about 2.236. Let me compute f(2.2361):

x³ is (2.2361)^3. Let's compute that. 2.2361 squared is about 5, because 2.2361 is sqrt(5) which is approximately 2.236. So 2.2361^2 = 5. Then 2.2361 * 5 = 11.1805. Adding 2x, which is 2 * 2.2361 = 4.4722. So total is 11.1805 +4.4722 = 15.6527. Then subtract 10, so f(x) is 5.6527. That's a positive value.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Wait, 2.2361 is about sqrt(5)=2.236. Let me compute x³: (sqrt(5))^3 =5*sqrt(5) ≈5*2.236=11.18. 2x is 2*sqrt(5)=4.472. So f(x)=11.18 +4.472 -10 = (15.652) -10 =5.652. So that's positive. So at x=2.236, f(x) is positive.

Wait, but at x=2, f(x)=2, which is positive. Wait, earlier when I thought about x=2, f(2) is 8 +4 -10=2. So f(2)=2, f(1)= -7.

Wait, so the function crosses zero between 1 and 2. Because at x=1, f is -7; at x=2, it's 2. So the root is between 1 and 2.

Wait, but the options don't have a number between 1 and 2. Let me look again. The options are A:1.4142, B:1.8474, etc. So the options are all above 1.618. Wait, but I thought the root is between 1 and 2. So perhaps the Newton-Raphson method will start with an initial guess in that range and converge.

Wait, but perhaps the options are all in the higher range. Let me reevaluate the function. Let me compute f(1.618). Wait, that's option F, which is about 1.618.

f(1.618): 1.618^3 + 2*(1.618) -10.

1.618 cubed. Let's compute:

1.618^2 is about 2.618 (since (sqrt(5)-1/2)^2 is ( (sqrt(5))^2 - 2*sqrt(5)/2 +1/4 )=5 - sqrt(5) +0.25. Wait, but sqrt(5) is about 2.236, so (sqrt(5)-1)^2= (2.236-1)^2= (1.236)^2=1.527. No, wait, perhaps I should compute 1.618^3 more accurately.

Alternatively, 1.618^3 = (1.618)^2 * 1.618. 1.618 squared is approximately 2.618. Then multiply by 1.618: 2.618 * 1.618 ≈ let's compute 2*1.618=3.236, and 0.618*1.618≈1. So total around 4.25.

Adding 2 * 1.618 = 3.236. So f(1.618) ≈4.25 +3.236 -10 =7.486 -10= -2.514. So negative.

At x=1.618, f(x) is about -2.514.

At x=1.8474 (option B), let me compute f(1.8474):

1.8474^3 + 2*(1.8474) -10.

Compute 1.8474³: Let me compute 1.8474 squared first. 1.8474 * 1.8474.

Well, 1.8474^2: let me compute 1.8^2=3.24. 0.0474^2 is negligible. 2*1.8 * 0.0474= about 2*(0.0853)=0.1706.

So approximately, 3.24 +0.1706 + (something) ? Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute 1.8474^2.

Let me compute 1.8474 * 1.8474.

1.8474 × 1.8474:

First, 1 ×1.8474 = 1.8474.

0.8 ×1.8474=1.47792.

0.04 ×1.8474=0.073896.

0.0074 ×1.8474≈0.013713.

Wait, maybe a better way is:

1.8474 × 1.8474 = (1.8 + 0.0474)^2 = 1.8^2 + 2*1.8*0.0474 + 0.0474^2.

1.8²=3.24.

2*1.8*0.0474= 3.6 *0.0474 =0.17 (approx 0.17) but exact calculation: 3.6 *0.0474=0.17 (because 0.0474*3=0.1422, 0.0474*0.6=0.02844; total 0.17064).

0.0474^2 ≈ (0.0474)^2= approx 0.002246.

Adding these: 3.24 + 0.17064 = 3.41064 + 0.002246 ≈3.412886.

So 1.8474^2 ≈3.412886.

Now, multiply this by 1.8474 to get 1.8474^3.

3.412886 * 1.8474.

Well, 3 * 1.8474 =5.5422.

0.412886 *1.8474.

0.4 *1.8474=0.73896.

0.012886 *1.8474≈0.02369.

So total 0.73896 + 0.02369 ≈0.76265.

Adding to 5.5422: 5.5422 +0.76265≈6.30485.

So approximately 6.30485.

Now, 2 *1.8474 =3.6948.

So f(1.8474)=6.30485 +3.6948 -10 =9.99965 -10= approx -0.00035. So close to zero.

Hmm, that's very close. So f(1.8474) is approximately -0.00035, which is almost zero. So the root is very close to 1.8474.

Wait, but wait. When I plug in 1.8474 into f(x), I get -0.00035, which is very near to zero. So the root is approximately 1.8474.

But wait, let me check. Because in the options, 1.8474 is option B. So that's the correct answer. But wait, the options don't list the exact value, but option B is 1.8474, which is our calculation.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the Newton-Raphson method starts with an initial guess, say x₀, and iteratively improves it. So maybe I should have chosen a better initial guess.

Wait, what's the current f(x) at x=1.618? Earlier, I found f(1.618) was about -2.514. At x=1.8474, f is about -0.00035. So Newton-Raphson might converge here if x₀ is around 1.8474.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have started with a different initial guess. Let's see, perhaps the initial guess is 1.618 (option F), but f(1.618) is -2.514, which is negative. So if I use x₀=1.8474 (B), then f(x₀)= almost zero.

Wait, but let me think about the Newton-Raphson method's requirements. It requires the function to be differentiable, which it is here. The derivative is f'(x) = 3x² + 2, which is always positive, so the function is strictly increasing. That's good because it means there's only one root.

Wait, but in any case, let's proceed with the calculations. Let's take x₀ as 1.8474. So the first iteration.

Compute f(x₀) = x₀³ + 2x₀ -10.

Wait, wait, earlier calculation said f(1.8474) is approximately -0.00035. So f(x₀) is negative.

Compute f'(x₀) =3x₀² + 2. Since x₀ is about 1.8474, x₀² is about (1.8474)^2 = around 3.4128 as before. So f'(x₀) is 3 *3.4128 +2= 10.2384 +2=12.2384.

Wait, but wait, if f(x₀) is negative and f'(x₀) is positive, then the next guess x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀).

So x₁ = 1.8474 - (-0.00035)/12.2384.

Which is 1.8474 + (0.00035)/12.2384.

0.00035 /12.2384 is about 0.0000288. So x₁ ≈1.8474 +0.0000288 ≈1.8474288.

So that's an extremely accurate approximation. So the root is approximately 1.8474, which is option B. So the answer should be B.
</think>

To solve the equation \( x^3 + 2x = 10 \) using the Newton-Raphson method, we first rewrite it as \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x - 10 = 0 \). The Newton-Raphson formula is:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\]

where \( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \). The root of \( f(x) \) is between 1 and 2 because \( f(1) = -7 \) and \( f(2) = 2 \). Evaluating \( f(x) \) at various points confirms that the root lies between 1 and 2.

Given the options, the root is expected to be around 1.8474. Using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of \( x_0 = 1.8474 \), the function value \( f(x_0) \) is approximately \(-0.00035\), which is very close to zero. The derivative \( f'(x_0) \) is positive, ensuring convergence.

Thus, the root is approximately \( 1.8474 \), matching option B.
