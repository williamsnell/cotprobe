Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking about two principal answers regarding the meaning of life. The options are labeled from A to J, each pairing two different views. I remember from my philosophy classes that there are various perspectives on this.

I think the main perspectives are existentialism and pragmatism. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me look again: the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Hmmm. Oh wait, option B says existentialist's view and nihilist's view. Option B is an option. So maybe that's it.

Wait, I should clarify. So, the two principal answers are either existentialism and pragmatism, or existentialism and nihilism? Or is it existentialism and the nihilist's view? Alternatively, perhaps the two main views are existentialism and pragmatism.

Wait another thought: I think the two main perspectives are the existentialist's view and the nihilist's view. Because one is about the meaning of life being in the end, the other is about the meaning being in the present. Let me think: existentialism, I believe, emphasizes that existence is meaningful because it's about the present and the meaning that comes from it. The nihilist, on the other hand, argues that there's no inherent meaning in lifeâ€”they don't see life as having a deeper significance beyond its existence.

So looking at the options, option B is "the existentialist's view and the nihilist's view." That sounds right. The other options don't seem to fit. Option B is the pair I'm thinking of. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is **B: the existentialist's view and the nihilist's view**. 

**Explanation:** The two principal views are existentialism, which focuses on the meaning of life being in the present, and nihilism, which argues there's no inherent meaning in life beyond its existence. These perspectives are often paired with other philosophical stances, but among the given options, B best matches the question. 

Answer: B
