Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hearsay and admissibility in a criminal trial. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a defense counsel offering testimony about a man on death row who admitted he hired another man to shoot the victim. The options are various hearsay exceptions. 

First, I need to remember what hearsay is. Hearsay is anyone's statement not specifically made by the speaker. It's generally not admissible unless it falls under specific exceptions like the admission, dying declaration, or statement made during an event.

In this case, the man on death row is trying to prove he hired another. So the statement is about the hiring, not about the facts of the event itself. It's a statement made by someone else. But wait, his statement is about another person, not the event. So it's not about the event itself, which is the murder. 

Wait, but the defense is offering it as a statement, probably to prove that someone else did it. So is it hearsay? Because hearsay can't be used as evidence unless it's within an exception. 

Let me think about exceptions. The admission exception allows a statement made by a third party (adversary) to prove the truth of the matter. So if the defense is saying that a third party (the defense man) hired another, that's something they're trying to prove. But the defense is not saying the hired person did it. Instead, they're saying the hired person is someone they hired. So the statement is about the hiring, not about the event. So I think that would make it an admission statement, but is that allowed?

Wait, the defense is presenting the statement as an admission. So if they're saying that they hired someone, that's a statement made by themselves. But in this case, the statement is not about the event of shooting the victim. It's about the hiring by someone else. So the defense could be using the statement to prove that someone else did the killing. But that doesn't make the statement hearsayâ€”it's an admission. So it's not hearsay. 

Wait, no. Because if the statement is about someone else (the defendant) hiring another, that's not hearsay because it's not making a statement about the event. It's about a third party's hiring decision. So the defense is trying to prove that the defendant hired someone else, but that's not hearsay. 

Wait, but the defense is just offering this statement as evidence. Is it hearsay? Because it's a statement about a third party. So, an admission is a statement made by someone else to prove the truth of the matter. So the statement would be hearsay unless it's an admission. 

But wait, in this case, the defendant is presenting this statement to prove that they hired someone else. So if the statement is a statement about the hiring, not about the event, then the statement is hearsay because it's making a statement not made by the defendant. But if the defense is using it as an admission, meaning they're saying they hired someone, then the statement is an admission, and thus not hearsay.

Wait, but the defense is using it to prove the defendant hired someone else. So the statement is about the defendant. So it's hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant. Unless the defense is making it to prove that they hired someone else, which would be a statement made by the defendant, thus admissible as an admission.

Wait, no. Wait, the defense is presenting the statement as a statement to prove that they hired someone else. So the statement is about the defendant, not about the event. So the defense is using the statement to prove that they hired someone else. But the statement itself is hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant. Unless it's an admission.

Wait, no. The statement is about the defendant. So the statement is hearsay because it's a personal statement not made by the defendant. Unless the defense is using it to prove the defendant's innocence, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is about the defendant, making it an admission statement, which would make it non-hearsay.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think. The defense is offering a statement made by the defendant (the man on death row) about hiring someone else. So is this a statement made by the defendant? Yes, because he's the one making the statement. So if the statement is being offered to prove that he hired someone else, then it's an admission. So the statement is hearsay unless it's an admission.

Wait, but the admission exception requires that the statement be made by a third party (adversary) to prove the truth of the matter. In this case, the defense is the adversary, so they are using the statement as an admission. So the statement is hearsay unless it's an admission. But the defense is using it to prove the defendant hired someone else, which would be a statement made by the defendant, so it's an admission and thus not hearsay.

Wait, but the question is whether the defense is making the statement as an admission. The defense is presenting it to prove that they (the defendant) hired someone else. So perhaps the statement is being used as evidence to show that they hired someone else, which would require the statement to be an admission. But if the statement is about the defendant, then it's hearsay.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Hearsay is any statement not made by the speaker. If the statement is about the defendant, then it's hearsay unless it's an admission. But if the statement is about a third party (like the defense), then perhaps it's an admission. So in this case, the defense is presenting the statement to prove that they hired someone else, but the statement itself is not about the event (the murder) but about the defendant. So it's hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant.

Unless the defense is using it as an admission, meaning they are saying the defendant hired someone else. So the statement is hearsay unless it's an admission. But if the defense is using it to prove that they hired someone else, then the statement is an admission, making it non-hearsay.

Wait, but the defense is trying to prove the defendant hired someone else. So the statement is being offered as evidence to prove that they hired someone else. So the statement is hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant. Unless the defense is using it to prove that they did hire someone else, which would require the statement to be made by the defendant, thus making it admissible as an admission.

So I think the correct answer is that it's hearsay, but admissible as an admission.

Looking back at the options, option A says "hearsay, but admissible as an admission." So that's likely the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. If the statement is about the defendant, then it's hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant. Unless the defense is using it to prove that they (the defendant) hired someone else, which would be an admission. But the defense is presenting it as evidence to prove they hired someone else, so it's an admission statement, which is non-hearsay. So the statement is hearsay unless it's an admission. But in this case, the defense is using it as an admission statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the defense is using the statement to prove that they did hire someone else, which would require the statement to be made by them. So the statement is hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant. But if it's being used to prove that they hired someone else, then the statement is an admission, making it non-hearsay.

I think in this scenario, the defense is using the statement to prove they hired someone else, which would require the statement to be made by them. So the statement is hearsay (since it's a statement not made by the defendant) unless it's an admission. But the defense is presenting it to prove the defendant hired someone else. So the defense is using it as an admission.

Wait, but the defense is the defendant. So they are using the statement to prove the defendant hired someone else. So the statement is hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant. Unless the defense is using it to prove that they (the defendant) hired someone else, which would be an admission.

So in this case, the defense is making the statement to prove that they hired someone else. So the statement is hearsay unless it's an admission. But the defense is using it to prove that they hired someone else, which would require the statement to be made by them. So the statement is hearsay, but if the defense is using it as an admission, then it's admissible as an admission.

Wait, but the defense is offering the statement to prove that they hired someone else. So if the defense is using the statement as an admission, then it's admissible. Otherwise, it's hearsay.

I'm getting tangled. Let me think about the legal principle. The defense is using the statement to prove that they hired someone else. To do that, the statement would need to be made by the defendant. So the statement is hearsay unless it's an admission.

Wait, but the defense is presenting the statement to prove that they hired someone else, so the statement is being offered as evidence of the defendant's actions. So the statement is hearsay because it's a statement not made by the defendant. Unless the defense is making the statement to prove that they did hire someone else, which would require the statement to be made by them, making it an admission.

So the answer is option A: hearsay, but admissible as an admission.
</think>

The defense is offering a statement that a man on death row admits hiring another to shoot the victim, and the question is whether this statement is hearsay and admissible. 

Hearsay is any statement not specifically made by the speaker and is generally not admissible unless it falls under recognized exceptions like the admission, dying declaration, or statement made during an event. 

In this case, the statement is about a third party (the defendant) making a statement to prove they hired someone else. To prove the defendant hired someone else, the statement would need to be made by the defendant, making it an admission statement, which falls under the exception for admitting an adversary. 

Therefore, while the statement is hearsay because it is not made by the defendant, it is admissible as an admission statement.
