Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the classification of different hydrocarbons into the methane, ethylene, or acetylene series. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to remember what each series represents. Methane is C2H4, ethylene is C2H4, and acetylene is C2H2. Wait, but wait, the actual structures are C2H4 for methane, C2H4 (ethylene) as the simplest alkene, and C2H2 as acetylene. So, each series refers to the general formula of hydrocarbons with the same number of carbon atoms (n) and a double bond (for ethylene) or triple bond (for acetylene).

The question gives four molecules: C12H26, C9H16, C7H14, and C26H54. I need to classify each into methane, ethylene, or acetylene series.

Let me go through each molecule one by one.

1. C12H26: Methane is C2H4. So, each multiple of 2 in C and 4 in H would belong to the same series. Let's see: 12C... So, 12/2=6. Methane's formula is C2H4, so each C2H4 in the series would multiply to that. So 6*2=12 C, 6*4=24 H. But the given H is 26. Oh wait, 12/2=6, so 6*(C2H4) = C12H24. But the molecule has 26 H. So, 26-24=2 H more. So, maybe it's an alkene or with another functional group? But wait, the series is based on the formula. If each term in the series has the same n and same bond order, then C12H26 would be part of the 12C series. Wait, but the question is about the four given molecules. Let me look again.

Wait, the question says each of the four is a member of one of the series: methane, ethylene, or acetylene. So, I think each molecule is in one of these three.

So, for each molecule, we can see how many times 2 is in C, and 4 or 2 in H.

Wait:

Methane: C2H4 → n=1, H=4 → ratio H/(C-2) is 2.

So, for each term in the methane series, the number of carbons is a multiple of 2, and H is 4 times the number of CH2 groups. Wait, maybe another approach: The general formula for each series is C_nH_(2n) for methane and ethylene (since they're alkanes and alkenes with double bonds), but acetylene is C2H2, which is n=1, H=2.

So, let's calculate for each molecule:

C12H26: C=12, H=26.

So, n for methane would be 12/2=6. So, 6 CH2 units. The H would be 6*(2)=12. But here H is 26, which is 6*4 + 2? Wait, 12*2 is 24. 26-24=2, so that's 2 extra hydrogens. So, perhaps it's an alkene or something else. Since the series is based on the number of H and C, perhaps this is a larger alkene. Wait, but the series is determined by the pattern of the formula. So, for the methane series, the formula is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc. So, C12H26 is 6*(2C4H8?), but 6*2=12 C, 6*4=24 H. So, 26 H is two more. So, maybe it's part of the ethylene series, but ethylene is C2H4. Wait, no—wait. The ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc. So, the formula for ethylene is C2H4, for each additional molecule, add 2C and 4H. So, C12H26 is 6*(C2H4) plus 2*(C2H2). Hmm, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps each term in the ethylene series is C2H4, which would be n=1 (since C2H4 is 1, 2C, 4H), 2 (C4H8) would be n=2, etc. So, C12H26: n=6, so it's in the 6th term of the ethylene series. Because 2*6=12 C, 4*6=24 H, but the actual H is 26, which is 2 more. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe another approach: the number of H is 2n + 2 for the ethylene series? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The general formula for the ethylene series is C2H4, which is the same as methane. The next term would be C4H8, then C6H12, etc. So, each term is an increase of 2C and 4H. So, for a molecule with C=12, H=26, the number of times it's 2C is 6 (since 12/2=6). So, the formula would be (6) * (C2H4) = C12H24. But the given is C12H26, which is two more H. So, that's not part of the ethylene series. So perhaps this is part of the acetylene series?

Wait, the acetylene series is C2H2, then C4H6, C6H8, etc. So, let's see: for C2H2, n=1 (since C=2, H=2). The next term would be C4H6 (n=2), then C6H8 (n=3), and so on. So, each term adds 2C and 4H. So, for C12H26, n=6 (since 2*6=12 C). Let's see what H would be: 2*6 + 2? Wait, no. Wait, 2n + 2? Let me see: For n=1, H=2 → 2(1) + 2=4, which is not correct. Wait, maybe for the acetylene series, the general formula is C2H2 for n=1, then for each n, it's C2n H_{2n+2}? Wait, no. Let me think: For each n, the formula is C2n H_{2n} for n=1: C2H4 (methane), n=2: C4H8 (ethylene), n=3: C6H10, n=4: C8H12, n=5: C10H14, n=6: C12H14. Wait, that's different from what the given is. Wait, the given is C12H26.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H8, etc. So, for n=1: C2H2 (H=2), n=2: C4H6 (H=6), n=3: C6H8 (H=8), n=4: C8H10, n=5: C10H12, n=6: C12H14. So, the given is C12H26. That's not any of these. So perhaps this is part of the ethylene series. But wait, ethylene's formula is C2H4. So, for n=6, ethylene would be C12H24, but the molecule is C12H26, which is two H more. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list each molecule and see which series they belong to.

1. C12H26: Let's check the possible series. Methane is C2H4. The formula would be 6*(C2H4) = C12H24. But the molecule is C12H26, which is two H more. So, maybe it's part of the acetylene series, but the formula for the acetylene series needs to be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps this is not part of any of the three series given, but the question says each is a member of one.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's compute for each:

- Methane series: n=1, H=4. Each term is 2n C and 4n H. So, for n=6: 12 C, 24 H. The given H is 26, which is 2 more. So, perhaps this is part of a larger ethylene-like structure, but not following the exact same pattern. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the ethylene series but with two more H than the formula suggests.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8, etc. So, the next term after C12H24 is C14H28, which is 6 more carbons, and 8 more H. So, 26 is not in that sequence.

So, perhaps this is not in any of the three series. But the question says it's a member of one. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let's think again. Each series has the same number of carbons and a certain type of bonding. So, for the methane series, each member has n carbons and 2n H. For ethylene, same, but 2n H (since each double bond contributes 2 H). For acetylene, each term has n=1 (C2H2), n=2 (C4H6), etc.

So, given C12H26: n=6.

In the methane series, n=6 → 12C, 24H. But given H=26 → 2 more H. So, perhaps this is part of the ethylene series but with two more H than the formula suggests. Alternatively, perhaps it's a larger molecule in the ethylene series.

Wait, but the ethylene series is defined as each term being 2n C and 4n H. So, for n=6, that's 12C and 24H. So, why is the given H 26? That's 2 more. So, perhaps this molecule is not in any of the three series, but the question states each is a member. So, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the given is not in any of the series. But the options suggest that each has a classification.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Looking at the options, E is C12H26: alkane series (which is methane), C9H16: ethylene, C7H14: acetylene, C26H54: ethylene.

Wait, wait, let me check each of the given molecules in the options to see if they fit.

Option E: The given is C12H26, which would be in the methane series (alkane), not ethylene. Because 12C would be 6*(2C) → 6*(C2H4) would be 12C and 24H. But the given H is 26. So this option is wrong because it's not in the methane series. Hmm, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, let me think about each molecule.

C12H26: 12/2=6, so 6*(C2H4) = C12H24. So, H is 24, but given is 26. So, that's two more H. So, perhaps this is part of the ethylene series. Because ethylene's first term is 2C, 4H. The next term is 4C, 8H → 2C6H8 (n=3 → 6C, 8H). So, for n=6, it's 12C and 24 H. But H is 26, so 26-24=2. So, perhaps this is an extra CH2 group or something, but that would mean it's not part of the ethylene series. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the acetylene series, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the given C12H26 is part of the ethylene series but with two more H than the formula would suggest. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps let's move to the next molecule.

C9H16: 9/2=4.5, which isn't an integer. So, it can't be in any of the three series, because each series is defined by a whole number of carbons. Wait, but the question says each is a member of one of those series. So, perhaps I've made an error in calculating the series.

Wait, another approach: Each series is based on the formula for each bond type. For example, the methane series has C2H4, C4H8, etc. The ethylene series is C2H4 (ethylene), C4H8 (ethylene), C6H10 (acetylene?), but wait, no. Wait, no, ethylene is C2H4, acetylene is C2H2, so the ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8 (ethene), C6H12 (ethylene? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The ethylene series is the same as methane but with a double bond. So, each term is an alkane with a double bond. So, the formula for each term in the ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, C8H16, etc. So, each term increases by 2C and 4H.

Similarly, acetylene (C2H2) is the first term in the acetylene series. So, the formula for each term in the acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, C8H14, etc. Each term increases by 2C and 4H.

So, looking at each molecule:

1. C12H26: 12 C → 6*(2C) → 12 C. H = 26. For the methane series, each term is 4n H. 6*4=24 → 24H, but we have 26, which is 2 more. So, that's not part of the methane series.

2. C9H16: 9/2=4.5 → not an integer. So, this molecule can't be in any of the three series because each series is based on whole numbers of C.

Wait, but the question says each is a member of one of the series. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the exact formula but the molecular formula's general structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are the correct ones, so I should look for which option correctly classifies each.

Option B: C12H26: acetylene series (which would be C2H2, C4H6, etc.), so for 6 terms, it's C12H26 (since 6*2=12, 6*2=12 → but wait, that's the same as the acetylene series. So, the formula for the 6th term is C12H26. So, this would be part of the acetylene series.

Wait, but the acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc. So, the formula for the 6th term is C12H26. So, C12H26 is part of the acetylene series. So, that's correct.

Now, moving to C9H16: 9C. Hmm, but the series are based on multiples of 2 for C. 9 isn't a multiple of 2. So, this can't be in any of the given series. But the question says each is a member of one of the series. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the formula for each series is determined by the number of H and C. So, for the methane series, the formula is C_n H_(2n). For the ethylene series, it's C_n H_(2n). Wait, no, the ethylene series is the same as methane because it's the same molecular formula but with a double bond. So, the formula is C2H4 for each term in the methane series.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here. Let me try to think of each series' formula.

The methane series: each term is (C2H4), (C4H8), (C6H12), etc. So, each term is 2n C, 4n H. So, for n=6, 12C, 24H. So, C12H24 would be the 6th term.

But the given molecule is C12H26, which is two H more. So, it's not in the methane series.

Next, the ethylene series: each term is (C2H4), (C4H8), (C6H12), (C8H16), etc. So, the formula is 2n C, 4n H. So, the given molecule is C9H16: 9C, 16H. 9/2=4.5 → not an integer. So, this can't be in any series.

Wait, but the question says each is a member of one of the three series. So, perhaps I need to consider only the possible series that fit. 

Let me reevaluate each molecule.

1. C12H26: 12C, 26H. Let's see what the possible series are.

Looking at the options:

A: C12H26 is an alkane? Let's see, the formula for the 6th term is C12H24. So, 26 H is 2 more than 24. So, perhaps it's part of the ethylene series but with two more H. But the ethylene series has a formula of 2n H. Since 26 is an even number, perhaps it's in the ethylene series. Wait, no, because the ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8, etc. So, for n=6, C12H24. So, 26 is 2 more. So, perhaps it's part of the acetylene series. But the acetylene series is C2H2, which for n=6 would be C12H14, which is less than 26. So, that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me check each option again.

Looking at option B: C12H26 is in the acetylene series, C9H16 is not in any series. But this can't be correct, because all four must be in one of the three series.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations. Let me try each molecule again.

1. C12H26: 12/2=6 → 6*(C2H4) = C12H24. So, this is 2 H more than the formula for the 6th term of the methane series. So, perhaps it's part of the ethylene series but with two more H. But the ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8, so on. So, C6H12 would be the 3rd term of the ethylene series. Wait, no, the first term is C2H4, the second term is C4H8, the third term is C6H12. So, the formula for the ethylene series is C2n H_{2n}.

Wait, so for n=6, it's C12H12. So, our molecule is C12H26. That's way more H than that. So, it's not part of the ethylene series.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I should consider the series differently.

Alternative approach: Each series has a specific formula. For example, the methane series has the formula C_n H_{2n}, where n is the number of carbons. So, for n=6, the formula is C12H24. So, the given molecule is C12H26, which is two H more. So, this is not part of the methane series.

The ethylene series has the formula C_n H_{2n} as well, but wait, that's the same as methane. So, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the ethylene series has the formula C_n H_{2n} for each term, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each series in terms of their general formula. For example, the methane series is C2H4, C4H8, etc. The ethylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc. The acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, etc. Wait, that can't be right, because that would make the ethylene series and acetylene series the same.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct series for each molecule:

1. C12H26: Let's see, 12/2=6. The 6th term of the methane series is C12H24. So, 26 is two H more. That doesn't fit any of the given series. So, perhaps this is not part of any of the three series. But the question states that each is a member of one. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the given formula is part of the acetylene series. Let me see: for n=6, the formula would be C12H14. But the molecule is C12H26. So, that's way more H. So, no.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at each option and see which one correctly classifies the four molecules.

Looking at option B: C12H26: acetylene series → correct. C9H16: not in any series. Hmm, but this would leave out the other three molecules. But the question states that each belongs to one of the three series.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the ethylene series.

The ethylene series has the formula C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, C8H14, etc. So, each term increases by 2C and 4H. So, for n=6, the formula is C12H14. So, the given molecule is C12H26, which is 12C, 26H. 26/12 is not 2. So, that's not part of the ethylene series.

Similarly, the acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc. So, the given C12H26 would be for n=6: C12H14. So, 26 is way higher than 14, so that's not part of the acetylene series.

So, this would mean that option B is wrong because it doesn't correctly classify all four molecules.

Looking at option E: C12H26: alkane series (CH4) → correct. C9H16: ethylene → correct. C7H14: acetylene → correct. C26H54: ethylene → wait, C26H54 is 26C, 54H. For the ethylene series, each term is 2n C and 4n H. So, 2n=26 → n=13, 4n=52. But the given is 54, which is 2 more. So, this molecule is not part of the ethylene series.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me recheck the ethylene series.

The ethylene series is defined as each alkane with a double bond. So, for each n, the formula is C2n H_{2n+2}?

Wait, no. Wait, when n=1, the formula is C2H4. For n=2, it's C4H8 (ethylene). For n=3, it's C6H10 (acetylene). So, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the general formula for each series.

According to my notes, the methane series is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc., where each term is 2C and 4H.

The ethylene series is C2H4 (ethene), C4H8 (ethene), C6H12 (ethene?), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, perhaps the ethylene series is the same as the methane series but with a double bond. So, for each term, it's C2H4, etc. But that can't be right because that would make the ethylene series and the methane series the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the series with the molecular formula. Let me try to look up the correct formulas.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the molecular formulas given must fit the general formulas of the series.

So, for the methane series:

Each term has formula C_n H_{2n}.

So, for n=6, formula is C12H24.

Similarly, for the ethylene series:

Each term has formula C_n H_{2n}.

Wait, but for ethylene, the double bond is C2H4. So, perhaps the ethylene series is same as methane? So, each term has formula C_n H_{2n}.

In that case, the given C9H16: n=4.5 → not integer → not part of any series.

So, but the question says that each is a member of one of the three series. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the series are based on the number of carbons and bonding. For example, the methane series is C2H4, C4H8, etc. The ethylene series is C2H2, C4H6, etc. The acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, etc. Wait, that can't be right. Because that would make the ethylene and acetylene series same.

Hmm, perhaps that's the confusion. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct classification of each formula.

So, for each formula:

1. C12H26: 12/2=6. So, 6*(C2H4) = C12H24 → H=26 → 2 more than 24. So, this is not part of the methane series. So, what series is this in? Maybe it's not part of any of the given series. But the question says each is a member of one of the three.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if any of the other molecules fit into any of the series, and see which option correctly classifies all four.

Looking at option E: C12H26: alkane series (CH4) → correct. C9H16: ethylene → correct. C7H14: acetylene → correct. C26H54: ethylene → correct?

Wait, ethylene's formula is C2H2, but the given for option E is C26H54. So, let's see if that fits into the ethylene series.

For ethylene's series, each term has formula C_n H_{2n}.

Wait, no. Wait, the ethylene series is the same as the methane series but with a double bond. So, the formula would be C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc.

Wait, no, that would mean for n=6, the formula is C12H24, which is the same as the methane series. So, perhaps the ethylene series is the same as the methane series but with a double bond. So, for each term in the ethylene series, the formula is C2n H_{2n}.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the ethylene series and methane series the same.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of each series' formula.

The methane series is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc.

The ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc. Wait, that's the same as the methane series. So, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethylene series is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc., and the acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc.

Wait, in that case, the given C12H26 is part of the methane series, C9H16 is part of the ethylene series, C7H14 is part of the ethylene series, and C26H54 is part of the ethylene series.

So, option E would correctly classify all four molecules.

Let me check each option again.

Option E: C12H26 → alkane series (CH4) → correct. C9H16 → ethylene series → correct. C7H14 → ethylene series → correct. C26H54 → ethylene series → correct.

So, option E is the correct one.

Wait, but I'm still a bit confused about the ethylene series. Let me think again. The ethylene series is the same as the methane series but with a double bond. So, the formula for each term is C2n H_{2n}.

So, for n=6, the formula is C12H24.

So, the given C26H54 would be for n=13: C26H52. But the given is H=54, which is 2 more than 52. So, that would not fit. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each series as having a specific formula. For example, the methane series is C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc.

The ethylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc.

The acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc. So, all of them are the same.

Wait, that would imply that the ethylene and acetylene series are the same. So, perhaps the correct classification is that all given molecules are in the same series.

Wait, but that can't be right because one is C12H26, which is in the methane series, and others are in ethylene and acetylene.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the ethylene series is different.

Wait, perhaps the ethylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc. And the acetylene series is C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc. So, same.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the series as follows:

Methane series: C2H4, C4H8, C6H12, etc.

Ethylene series: C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc.

Acetylene series: C2H2, C4H6, C6H10, etc.

Wait, that seems to suggest that the ethylene and acetylene series are the same. So, perhaps the classification is that all four molecules are in the same series.

So, looking back at the options, option E correctly classifies all four molecules as being in the ethylene series.

So, the correct answer is option E.

To classify each molecule into the correct series, we analyze their molecular formulas based on the series' general structure:

1. **Methane Series**: Each term has the formula **C₂H₄**, **C₄H₈**, **C₆H₁₂**, etc.
2. **Ethylene Series**: Each term has the formula **C₂H₂**, **C₄H₆**, **C₆H₁₀**, etc.
3. **Acetylene Series**: Each term has the formula **C₂H₂**, **C₄H₆**, **C₆H₁₀**, etc.

### Analysis of Each Molecule:
1. **C₁₂H₂₆**:  
   - The formula **C₁₂H₂₆** corresponds to **n=6** in the methane series.  
   - **Methane series formula for n=6**: **C₁₂H₂₄**.  
   - **Conclusion**: **C₁₂H₂₆** is **2 H more than C₁₂H₂₄**, so it is not part of the methane series.  

2. **C₉H₁₆**:  
   - The formula **C₉H₁₆** corresponds to **n=4.5**, which is not an integer.  
   - **Conclusion**: **C₉H₁₆** is not part of any series.  

3. **C₇H₁₄**:  
   - The formula **C₇H₁₄** corresponds to **n=3.5**, which is not an integer.  
   - **Conclusion**: **C₇H₁₄** is not part of any series.  

4. **C₂₆H₅₄**:  
   - The formula **C₂₆H₅₄** corresponds to **n=13** in the ethylene series.  
   - **Ethylene series formula for n=13**: **C₂₆H₅₂**.  
   - **Conclusion**: **C₂₆H₅₄** is **2 H more than C₂₆H₅₂**, so it is not part of the ethylene series.
