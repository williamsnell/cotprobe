Okay, so I have this physics question about electromagnetic induction. Hmm. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about what causes a voltage to be induced in a wire loop. So induced voltage... I remember that Faraday's Law is involved here. Faraday's Law of Induction relates the induced electromotive force (EMF) to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop.

Faraday's Law states that when the magnetic flux through a loop changes, an EMF is induced. Oh, and EMF is the induced voltage. So the magnetic field is changing, that's the key point. But wait, the question says when the magnetic field is within the loop. So if the field is changing, then yes, a voltage is induced. But what does it mean for the magnetic field to be at a certain condition?

The options are various statements about the magnetic field and induced voltage. Let me look at them.

Option A: is amplified. That doesn't sound right. Induced voltage is due to a change in magnetic flux, not necessarily an amplification.

Option B: converts to magnetic energy. No, that's more about energy conversion, not about induction.

Option C: is parallel to the electric field. Hmm. Electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular in the case of induced EMF. Because the induced electric field is related to the time rate of change of magnetic flux. So the electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. So this might be relevant.

Option D: changes. Yes, because Faraday's Law says that a change in magnetic flux induces EMF. So the magnetic field must be changing. But wait, the question is asking about what happens to the field when the voltage is induced. So if the field is changing, then option D is correct, but the question is about the field's condition when the voltage is induced.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The question is, when the magnetic field is such that the voltage is induced. So the condition is that the magnetic field is changing. So the correct answer would be when the magnetic field is changing, which is option D.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Faraday's Law says that a change in magnetic flux induces a voltage. Magnetic flux is the product of the magnetic field and the area, and it's the integral of B dot dA over the loop. So if the magnetic field is changing, then dB/dt is non-zero, leading to a change in flux, which causes EMF.

So the condition for inducing a voltage is a change in magnetic field. So the correct answer would be option D: changes.

Alternatively, what about the other options? Let's see.

Option E: is at right angles to the electric field. No, wait. The electric field (E) induced by a changing magnetic field (dB/dt) is given by E = -∂B/∂t. Oh wait, no, the correct formula is E = -dB/dt. Wait, the induced electric field is related to the magnetic field's change. So if the magnetic field is changing, the electric field is perpendicular to it. So the electric field would be perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, meaning that the electric field is at a right angle to the magnetic field. So option E says it's at right angles to the electric field, which is the opposite. So E is incorrect.

Option F: converts to electric energy. No, that's about energy conversion, not about the cause of the induced voltage.

Option G: aligns with the electric field. No, the electric field is due to the changing magnetic field.

Option H: is at a 45-degree angle... No, the angle between E and B is 90 degrees because E and B are perpendicular.

Option I: is static. No, because static fields don't change, so no induced EMF.

So the correct answer is when the magnetic field is changing, which is option D.

To determine when a voltage is induced in a wire loop, we rely on Faraday's Law of Induction, which states that a changing magnetic flux through a loop induces an electromotive force (EMF) and, consequently, a voltage. The magnetic flux is the product of the magnetic field \( B \) and the area \( A \), with the flux changing if \( B \) or \( A \) changes. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: is amplified**  
  Incorrect. Induced voltage is due to a change in magnetic flux, not amplification.

- **B: converts to magnetic energy**  
  Incorrect. This relates to energy conversion, not the cause of induced voltage.

- **C: is parallel to the electric field**  
  Incorrect. The electric field induced by a changing magnetic field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, not parallel.

- **D: changes**  
  Correct. Faraday's Law states that a change in magnetic flux induces an EMF, which is the voltage. Thus, the magnetic field must be changing.

- **E: is at right angles to the electric field**  
  Incorrect. The electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, not vice versa.

- **F: converts to electric energy**  
  Incorrect. This pertains to energy conversion, not the cause of induced voltage.

- **G: aligns with the electric field**  
  Incorrect. The electric field is due to the changing magnetic field, not aligned with it.

- **H: is at a 45-degree angle to the electric field**  
  Incorrect. The electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, not at a 45-degree angle.

- **I: is static**  
  Incorrect. A static magnetic field does not change, so no induced EMF.

- **J: is at a 45-degree angle to the electric field**  
  Incorrect. The electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field.

The correct answer is **D: changes**, as this is the condition required for induced voltage according to Faraday's Law.
