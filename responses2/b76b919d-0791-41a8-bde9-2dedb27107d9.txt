Question:

A state trooper was convicted in federal court in 2008 of taking bribes. He was sentenced to probation. He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:"Section 8. Any member of the state law enforcement staff. . . who is convicted of. . . briberyshall not be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the stateSuch conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contractSection 12. The provisions of this Act shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975. Section 14. This Act shall take effect immediately. "Following the enactment of the statute, the state trooper received a letter from the state which stated that pursuant to the statute, the state is immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to you on account of your 2008 bribery conviction. "The trooper contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. Assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. The trooper might still be able to eventually have his pension reinstated if

Options:

A: he can prove that the bribe was unrelated to his duties as a state trooper.
B: he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of thestatute.
C: he can prove that the statute is being applied selectively and discriminately.
D: he can show that the discontinuance of benefits is a form of double jeopardy.
E: he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.
F: he can demonstrate that the statute unfairly targets retired law enforcement officials.
G: he can demonstrate that his conviction was overturned on appeal.
H: he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U. S. Supreme Court.
I: he can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.

Okay, so I've got this question about a trooper who was convicted for bribery and got probation. The question is about whether he might still be able to get his pension reinstated after the new statute was passed. Let me try to break this down.

First, let me read through the facts again. The trooper was a state trooper from 1978 onward and became fully qualified in 1998. In 2006, he retired and started getting state pension checks. Then in 2009, the state signed a new statute. The statute says that anyone in the state law enforcement staff convicted of bribery isn't entitled to retirement or other benefits. It also says that this applies retroactively to 1975 and that it's effective immediately.

So, the trooper was convicted in 2008. He was initially entitled to his pension but then, after the statute was enacted, he received a letter from the state saying he's discontinuing benefits. Now he's suing, and he wants to know if he can challenge this.

The question is asking what the trooper can prove to get his pension reinstated. Let's look at the options.

Option A: He can prove the bribe was unrelated to his duties. Wait, if the bribe was related to his job, then his conviction might not hold. But the question says he was convicted of bribery. If the law is about bribing state troopers, then any form of bribery would be a direct violation. So proving it's unrelated would be a defense, but not sure if that's possible based on the facts.

Option B: Show he was convicted before the statute's effective date. The statute's effective date is December 31, 1975, because it says it takes effect immediately. So if his conviction happened in 2008, before 1975, he's not subject to it. But he was convicted in 2008, so this option doesn't apply. So he can't show that.

Option C: He can prove the statute is applied selectively and discriminately. That means the state uses this law differently for different categories. For example, if some law enforcement agencies are treated differently. But I'm not sure how that would apply here. The statute says any enforcement staff convicted of bribery can't get benefits. It doesn't specify selective application. So unless the court finds that, he can't prove it's selective. So maybe this isn't an option.

Option D: Show benefits are a form of double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is when you can't go back. But this is about being entitled to benefits and then losing them. So the court might say he's already entitled, so this doesn't help.

Option E: He gets a presidential pardon. That's a stretch. Presumably, the state would have to recognize the trooper's offense as a significant crime, which he did. Also, getting a pardon would mean he's not guilty, but the state's law is still in play. I don't think this is a viable defense.

Option F: He can show the statute unfairly targets retired law enforcement officials. But the statute applies retroactively to 1975, so it's about all law enforcement, not just retired ones. Unless there's a specific reason the state is targeting retired ones, this might not help. But the question says he's a state trooper, so maybe he's not eligible? Or maybe the statute is applied to everyone, so his case is moot because he's a trooper.

Option G: Show he can exercise constitutional right to review. The Constitution gives states the power to review criminal charges, but this is about a Supreme Court case. The question states that the state's highest court (probably the Supreme Court) is holding the statute constitutional. So the state can't just dismiss his case without the Supreme Court's permission. But the question is about whether he can still get reinstated, not about the state's ability to hold him. So this might not be the answer unless he can prove his case is constitutional.

Option H: Exercise constitutional right to review in the U.S. Supreme Court. Again, the question says the state's highest court (probably the Supreme Court) is holding it constitutional. But the state can't just revoke his benefits without the Supreme Court's permission. So unless he can show his case is constitutional, the state can't do that. But this is about the trooper's ability to get his benefits reinstated, not about the state being able to do that.

Option I: He gets a presidential pardon. As I thought earlier, this seems unlikely because the state's law is about him. Plus, getting a pardon would mean he's not guilty, but the statute still applies.

Wait, going back to option A. If the state's law is about bribing state troopers, then any form of bribery, regardless of whether it's related to his job, would be a breach. So if he's convicted of bribery, even if it's unrelated, he can't get benefits. So if he can prove the bribe was unrelated, he can argue that his conviction was based on something else, not his law enforcement duties. That would be a defense. But I'm not sure if the question is looking for that. The question is asking what he can prove to still get his pension back. So proving the bribe was unrelated would allow him to challenge the statute's application.

So among the options, option A says he can prove the bribe was unrelated. That seems possible. Because if the statute's purpose is to prevent any violation of the law enforcement employee's contract, then a bribe that's unrelated to their job wouldn't affect them. So he can argue that his conviction wasn't because of his duties, hence not a violation, so benefits should be reinstated.

Other options: Option H is about constitutional review, but the state's highest court is holding it constitutional. But that doesn't directly affect his ability to get benefits. Unless he can show his case is constitutional, but the question is about legal ability, not the state's ability to do so.

So the best option is A. He can prove the bribe was unrelated, which would mean his conviction wasn't about his job, so the statute doesn't apply. Hence, he can get his pension reinstated.

The trooper can argue that the state's law was not intended to apply to his case because the statute applies retroactively to 1975 and to all law enforcement agencies, regardless of their role. If he can prove that the bribery was unrelated to his duties as a state trooper, his conviction would not violate the statute, allowing his benefits to be reinstated.
