Question:

A listener-sponsored radio station wants to estimate the amount of money the typical supporter contributes during a fund-drive. In a sample of 30 supporters, it was discovered that 22 of them gave $60, six of them gave $1,000, and two of them gave $10,000. Based on this sample, which of the following measures of central tendency would provide the most useful information to the radio station?

Options:

A: Range
B: Variance
C: Standard Deviation
D: Median
E: Frequency Distribution
F: Histogram
G: Quartiles
H: Mode
I: ANOVA
J: Mean

Okay, so I've got this question about a radio station trying to estimate how much typical supporters contribute during a fund drive. They took a sample of 30 supporters, and in that sample, 22 gave $60, six gave $1,000, and two gave $10,000. The question is asking which measure of central tendency is best to use here to inform their estimates.

Hmm, let me think about the options. I remember that the measures of central tendency are mean, median, mode, etc. The question is, which one would give the most useful info for the radio station.

The radio station wants to know the typical contribution. So they're probably interested in knowing the average amount that a supporter spends. That makes me think of the mean, which is the average.

Wait, let's look at the options. The options are A to J. They list Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Median, Frequency Distribution, Histogram, Quartiles, Mode, ANOVA, and Mean.

I remember that the mean is the average, so (sum of all values) divided by the number of values. The median is the middle value when data is ordered. The mode is the most frequent value. Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. Variance and standard deviation measure how spread out the data is. Quartiles divide data into parts, like 25th, 50th (median), 75th. Histograms show frequency distributions.

In this case, the radio station wants to know the typical amount. So they probably need the average because that gives a central value, which is the mean. If they had a frequency distribution, they could calculate the mean from that as well, but the options don't have that. So looking at the options, E is Frequency Distribution, which isn't exactly a measure of central tendency but relates to how the data is grouped.

Wait, but the question is asking which measure of central tendency. So the options include things like mean, median, mode. So the question is, which one is the best. The mean would be the average, so that's the mean. The median is another measure of central tendency, but it's the middle value, which could be useful, but the mean would give the total average contribution.

In the sample given, the data is spread out a lot: some gave $60, some $1k, some $10k. So the mean would be (22*60 + 6*1000 + 2*10000)/30. Let's calculate that quickly: 22*60 is 1320, 6*1000 is 6000, 2*10000 is 20000. Total is 1320 + 6000 = 7320; 7320 + 20000=27320. Divide by 30: 27320/30 is about 910.67. So the mean is about $910.67.

What about the median? The median would be the middle value when all the contributions are ordered. Since there are 30 supporters, the median would be the average of the 15th and 16th values. So let's think about arranging the data in order. The first 22 are $60, then 6 are $1k, then 2 are $10k. So the 15th and 16th values would both be $60. So the median is $60. But that seems too low because most people are contributing $1k or $10k. So the median might not be as useful because it's just the middle of the lower group.

The mode is the most frequent value. In this case, $60 appears more often than the others, so mode is $60. But again, that's the lower end, so it might not represent the typical person as much as the mean does.

So, the radio station is likely interested in the average contribution because that tells them how much people typically contribute, which is what they need for their fund drive. So the best measure here is the mean. Looking back at the options, Mean is option J. So the answer should be J.

The question asks which measure of central tendency is most useful for the radio station to estimate typical contributions. The mean, calculated as the average of all contributions, provides the central value and is most relevant for estimating typical spending. 

Answer: J
