Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, we have two random variables, X₁ and X₂, which are a random sample of size n=2 from a distribution with pdf f(x) = 3x² for 0 < x < 1. We need to find the probability that the maximum of X₁ and X₂ is less than 3/4. The options are given from A to J, all fractions over 4096.

Hmm, probability that both X₁ and X₂ are less than 3/4. Since they're independent, I think the probability that both are less than 3/4 is just the square of the probability that one is less than 3/4. Wait, is that right?

Oh wait, no. Wait, for two variables, the probability that both are less than a certain value is the product if they're independent. But in this case, the two variables are from the same distribution, so they are independent. So yes, P(max(X₁, X₂) < 3/4) = P(X₁ < 3/4 and X₂ < 3/4) = [P(X < 3/4)]².

So first, I need to find the probability that a single X is less than 3/4. The pdf is f(x) = 3x². The cumulative distribution function (CDF) F(x) is the integral of f(x) from 0 to x.

Let me compute F(3/4). So,

F(3/4) = ∫₀^(3/4) 3x² dx.

The integral of x² is (x³)/3, so evaluating from 0 to 3/4:

F(3/4) = 3 * [( (3/4)^3 ) / 3 ] = (3/4)^3 = 27/64.

Wait, wait, because 3 multiplied by ( (3/4)^3 / 3 ) would cancel out the 3, so yeah, it's (3/4)^3.

So, F(3/4) is (3/4)^3 = 27/64.

Then, the probability that both X₁ and X₂ are less than 3/4 is (27/64)². Let's calculate that.

27 squared is 729, and 64 squared is 4096. So, 729/4096.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Options A is 625/4096, B:512, C:841, D:343, E:729, F:800, G:961, H:567, I:676, J:900.

So E is 729/4096. So that would be the answer. But wait, am I sure I'm calculating correctly?

Hold on, I think I made a mistake. Wait, no, because 27 squared is 729, correct. So 729 over 4096 is the probability. So option E is 729/4096.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the question says P(max < 3/4). Which is the same as P(X₁ < 3/4 and X₂ < 3/4). Which is correct as (F(3/4))².

But wait, could it be that I should have considered the maximum, but perhaps the other approach is to calculate the probability that both are less than 3/4, which is indeed (27/64)^2 = 729/4096. So that's option E.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the pdf is f(x) = 3x² for 0 < x < 1. So, the CDF F(x) is the integral from 0 to x of 3t² dt. So that's t³ evaluated from 0 to x, multiplied by 3. Wait no: ∫3t² dt from 0 to x is 3*(x³/3) - 0 = x³. So F(x) = x³.

Wait, wait, wait! Hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate the integral properly.

The pdf is f(x) = 3x² for 0 < x < 1.

Then, F(x) = ∫₀^x 3t² dt = [ t³ ]₀^x *3? Wait, no, wait, wait. The integral of 3t² is t³. So F(x) = x³. Because 3∫t² dt is 3*(x³/3) - 0 = x³.

Wait, that's a simpler way. So F(x) = x³. So F(3/4) is (3/4)^3 = 27/64. So that part was correct.

So then, the probability that both are less than 3/4 is (27/64)^2 = 729/4096. So option E. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 729/4096, correct.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the options are given in fractions with denominator 4096. So 729 is in the options, so that's correct.

Wait, but wait, am I sure that the question is asking for P(max < 3/4)? Because sometimes people get confused between maximum being less than or equal to or greater than, but in this case, it's strictly less than.

But yeah, the calculation seems correct.

To determine the probability that the maximum of two independent random variables, \(X_1\) and \(X_2\), is less than \(3/4\), we use the fact that for independent random variables, the probability that both are less than a certain value is the product of their individual probabilities. 

The given probability density function (pdf) is \(f(x) = 3x^2\) for \(0 < x < 1\). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) \(F(x)\) is the integral of the pdf from 0 to \(x\). Calculating:

\[
F(x) = \int_0^x 3t^2 \, dt = \left[ t^3 \right]_0^x = x^3
\]

Thus, \(F(3/4) = (3/4)^3 = 27/64\). The probability that both \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are less than \(3/4\) is:

\[
P(X_1 < 3/4 \text{ and } X_2 < 3/4) = F(3/4)^2 = \left(\frac{27}{64}\right)^2 = \frac{729}{4096}
\]

The correct answer is:

**E) \(\frac{729}{4096}\)**

E
