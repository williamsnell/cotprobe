Question:

A plane can travel 100 miles per hour (mph) without any wind. Its fuel supply is 3 hours. (This means that it can fly 300 miles without a wind). The pilot now proposes to fly east with a tail wind of 10 mph and to return with, of course, a head wind of 10 mph. How far out can he fly and return without running out of fuel? (The student should first reflect on whether or not the answer is the same as it is without a wind, namely, 150 miles.)

Options:

A: 125 miles
B: 140 miles
C: 145 miles
D: 150 miles
E: 148.5 miles
F: 165 miles
G: 135 miles
H: 130 miles
I: 160 miles
J: 155 miles

Okay, so I've got this plane flying problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So the plane can fly 100 mph in still air. Without any wind, it can fly 300 miles because 100mph * 3 hours = 300 miles. That makes sense. Now, the pilot wants to go east with a tail wind of 10 mph and come back with a head wind of 10 mph. The question is, how far can he fly and return without running out of fuel?

Hmm, first, I need to understand what's happening here. Let's break it down. When there's a wind, the plane's ground speed changes. So, when there's a tailwind (wind aiding the plane's direction), the plane's speed increases. Conversely, a headwind (wind against the plane's direction) would slow it down.

So, the plane's speed in still air is 100 mph. When there's a tailwind of 10 mph, its effective speed becomes 100 + 10 = 110 mph. On the return trip, it's flying against a headwind of 10 mph, so the effective speed is 100 - 10 = 90 mph.

Wait, but wait. The fuel supply is 3 hours. So the total time the plane can stay in the air is 3 hours. But the flight time isn't the same for going and coming. So, I need to calculate how much distance it can cover each way without exceeding the 3-hour fuel limit.

Let me think. Let’s denote the distance one way as 'd' miles. So the total distance for the round trip would be 2d miles. But wait, the fuel is consumed based on time, not distance. So the total time for the trip should be less than or equal to 3 hours.

But wait, the plane is going east and then coming back, so the total time is the time going plus the time coming back. So, time going = d / (100 + 10) = d / 110 hours. Time coming back = d / (100 -10) = d / 90 hours.

So total time is (d/110) + (d/90). This total time must be <= 3 hours.

So the equation is:

d/110 + d/90 <= 3

Let me solve this equation for d.

First, find a common denominator for 110 and 90. Let's see, 110 factors into 11*10, 90 is 9*10, so the LCM would be 990 (which is 9*11*10).

So, express both fractions with denominator 990.

d/110 = (9d)/990

d/90 = (11d)/990

So adding them up:

(9d +11d)/990 = 20d/990 = (20d)/990 = (2d)/99

So (2d)/99 <= 3

Multiply both sides by 99:

2d <= 297

Divide both sides by 2:

d <= 148.5 miles

Wait, so each way is 148.5 miles. So round trip is 297 miles. But I'm not sure if I did everything correctly.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the time for each leg.

Going: 148.5 miles at 110 mph. Time is 148.5 / 110. Let me compute that. 148.5 ÷ 110. 110 ×1.35 = 148.5, because 110 * 1 = 110, 110 * 0.35=38.5. 110+38.5=148.5. So 1.35 hours.

Coming back: 148.5 miles at 90 mph. 148.5 /90= 1.65 hours.

Total time: 1.35 + 1.65 = 3 hours. That's exactly the fuel limit. So the maximum one-way distance is 148.5 miles.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E:148.5 miles.

So the answer should be E.

The plane's speed with a tailwind is 110 mph, and against a headwind is 90 mph. The total time for the round trip must not exceed 3 hours. Calculating the time for each leg:

- Distance: 148.5 miles  
  - Time going: 148.5 / 110 = 1.35 hours  
  - Time returning: 148.5 / 90 = 1.65 hours  
- Total time: 1.35 + 1.65 = 3 hours  

Thus, the maximum one-way distance is 148.5 miles, making the total round trip 297 miles.

Answer: E: 148.5 miles
