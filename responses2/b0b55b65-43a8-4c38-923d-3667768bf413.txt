Okay, so I've got this question about planar graphs. Let me think through it. The question is asking for the maximum number of edges in a simple planar graph with 30 vertices. Hmm, I remember something about planar graphs and their edge limits. 

Wait, I think there's a formula related to that. Oh right, it's something like Euler's formula. Euler's formula for planar graphs is V - E + F = 2, where V is vertices, E edges, and F faces. But wait, how does that tie into edges?

I remember there's another formula for planar graphs that gives an upper limit on the number of edges. Oh yeah, it's E ≤ 3V - 6. But wait, I think that's for simple planar graphs where there are no multiple edges or loops. So for a graph with V vertices, the maximum edges would be 3V minus 6, but only if the graph is connected. Wait, or is that the case when it's a triangulation?

Yes, I think that's right. So for a simple planar graph without any multiple edges or loops, the maximum number of edges is 3V - 6. So for V=30, it should be 3*30 - 6. Let me calculate that. 3 times 30 is 90, minus 6 is 84. So that would be 84 edges. Looking at the options, option B is 84, so that's probably the answer. 

But wait, I should make sure. Another thought: a triangulation is a planar graph where every face (including the outer face) is a triangle. That would imply that each face is bounded by 3 edges, but each edge is shared by two faces. So the relation is 3F = 2E (if I count edges twice, once for each face they're part of). And from Euler's formula, F = E - V + 2. Substituting into 3F = 2E gives 3(E - V + 2) = 2E. Expanding that gives 3E - 3V + 6 = 2E. Subtracting 2E from both sides, E -3V +6=0 → E=3V-6. Yup, that's consistent. So for 30 vertices, 3*30=90, minus 6 is 84. So B is correct.

The maximum number of edges in a simple planar graph with 30 vertices is determined using the formula \( E \leq 3V - 6 \). For \( V = 30 \), this gives \( E = 3 \times 30 - 6 = 84 \). Thus, the correct answer is **B: 84**.
