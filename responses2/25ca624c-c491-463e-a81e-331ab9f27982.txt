Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a 0.1 M solution of ammonia. I remember that ammonia is a weak base, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The question gives the pKb as 1.76 × 10^-5, but wait, I think that's perhaps a typo because usually, pKb is given without the exponent. Oh wait, no, maybe that's the correct value. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should recall that the pKb is the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant, Kb. So, the formula would be pKb = -log(Kb). But wait, the problem states pKb=1.76e-5, which actually is a very small number, which makes sense for a weak base.

Since ammonia is a weak base, it will react with water as NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH-. The Kb value tells me how much it reacts. The Kb is calculated as [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3]. 

I think I should set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the concentrations at equilibrium. Let me denote the change as x. So, initial concentrations are [NH3] = 0.1 M, [NH4+]=0, [OH-]=0.

At equilibrium:
- [NH3] = 0.1 - x
- [NH4+] = x
- [OH-] = x

Wait, but because ammonia is a weak base, x might be small compared to 0.1. So I can perhaps make an approximation that 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. But I'm not sure if that's valid yet; maybe it's better to check.

So, Kb = [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3] = (x)(x)/(0.1 - x) ≈ x² / 0.1 (since x is small). So, x² = Kb * 0.1.

Wait, Kb is given as 1.76e-5. Let me plug that in.

x² = (1.76e-5) * 0.1 = 1.76e-6. So x = sqrt(1.76e-6) = approx 1.326e-3 M.

So [OH-] is approximately 1.326e-3 M. Then, pOH would be -log(1.326e-3). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1.326e-3 is 0.001326. The log of that: log(1.326) is about 0.1213, so log(1.326e-3) is 0.1213 -3 = -2.8787. So pOH is 2.8787. Wait no, wait, wait. Because the log(1.326e-3) is log(1.326) + log(1e-3) = 0.1213 -3 = -2.8787. So the pOH is the negative of that, so 2.8787.

Wait no, wait. The pOH is the negative log of [OH-], so yes, pOH = -log(1.326e-3) = 2.8787.

Then, since pH + pOH = 14 at 25°C, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 2.8787 ≈ 11.1213. Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 11.12, which is 11.12. So pH is about 11.12.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the approximation? Because ammonia is a weak base, x might not be negligible compared to 0.1. Let me check. The x I calculated was 1.326e-3, which is 0.13% of 0.1. So the approximation is valid. So the initial calculation should be correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is 11.12, which is what I got. But wait, the options include some that are 12. So let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. The pKb was given as 1.76e-5, which is 1.76 x 10^-5. So Kb is 1.76e-5. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should calculate using the exact formula without the approximation.

So, Kb = (x^2)/(0.1 - x) = 1.76e-5.

At x=0.001326, 0.1 - x = 0.098674. So x^2 is (0.001326)^2 ≈ 1.758e-6. Then, Kb is 1.758e-6 / 0.098674 ≈ 1.785e-5. Which is a bit higher than 1.76e-5, which suggests that the approximation was a bit rough. But since x is about 1.3e-3, maybe it's better to use the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual x is a bit higher, so [OH-] is a bit higher than 1.326e-3. Let me compute x exactly.

So, x² = Kb*(0.1 - x) → x² = (1.76e-5)(0.1 - x).

Let me write it as x² = 1.76e-6 - 1.76e-5 x → x² + 1.76e-5 x - 1.76e-6 = 0.

Quadratic equation: a=1, b=1.76e-5, c= -1.76e-6.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (1.76e-5)^2 -4*1*(-1.76e-6) = (3.0976e-10) + (7.04e-6) → approx 7.04e-6.

So x = (-b ± sqrt(D)) / (2a) → positive root only.

So x = [ -1.76e-5 + sqrt(7.04e-6) ] / 2.

sqrt(7.04e-6) = approximately 8.4e-3.

So x ≈ [ (-0.0000176) + 0.000084 ] / 2 = (0.0000664 ) / 2 = 0.0000332 M (that is, 3.32e-5).

Wait, wait, that's conflicting with earlier calculation. Oh, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(7.04e-6) = sqrt(7.04e-6) = sqrt(7.04)*1e-3.

sqrt(7.04) ≈ 2.653. So 2.653e-3.

So x = [ -1.76e-5 + 2.653e-3 ] / 2.

So the numerator is ( -0.0000176 + 0.002653 ) = 0.0026354.

Divide by 2: 0.0013177.

So x ≈ 1.3177e-3 M.

That's about 1.318e-3. Earlier approximation was 1.326e-3, so a slight difference but not too big.

So [OH-] is approximately 1.318e-3 M.

So pOH is -log(1.318e-3).

Let me calculate that. log(1.318) is about 0.1195.

So log(1.318e-3) = 0.1195 -3 = -2.8805.

So pOH is 2.8805. So pH = 14 - 2.8805 = 11.1195, which is approximately 11.12.

So the pH is about 11.12, which is option I.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the options, option I is 11.12. So the correct answer is I, pH=11.12.

But why is option G, 11.98 an option? Let me think. Did I make a mistake in the Kb calculation?

Wait, the pKb is provided as 1.76 ×10^-5. Oh, wait, wait a minute. Oh wait, I might have misread the pKb. The problem states pKb=1.76e-5.

Wait, wait, no, 1.76e-5 is a very small number. Oh, wait a second! I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the pKb is given as 1.76e-5, which is 0.0000176. Wait, that's 1.76 ×10^-5, which is 1.76 times 10 to the minus fifth power. But wait, 1.76e-5 is 1.76 ×10^-5, which is a very small Kb. But in reality, the Kb of ammonia is around 1.8e-5, so this is correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the calculation.

Wait, Kb = 1.76e-5.

x^2 = Kb * (0.1 - x) → x^2 ≈ (1.76e-5)(0.1) = 1.76e-6. So x ≈ sqrt(1.76e-6) = 1.326e-3.

But wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculation. Let me compute 1.76e-5 * 0.1 = 1.76e-6.

x² = 1.76e-6 → x = sqrt(1.76e-6) = sqrt(1.76)*1e-3.

sqrt(1.76) is approximately 1.3266. So x= 1.3266e-3 M.

So [OH-] = x = 1.3266e-3.

pOH = -log(1.3266e-3) = ?

Compute log(1.3266e-3):

log(1.3266) = approx since log(1.3)=0.1139, log(1.3266)= ~0.1213.

So log(1.3266e-3) = 0.1213 -3 = -2.8787.

So pOH = 2.8787 → pH =14-2.8787= 11.1213, which is approximately 11.12.

So the pH is 11.12, which is option I. So the correct answer should be I.

To determine the pH of a 0.1 M solution of ammonia (NH₃), we start by noting that NH₃ is a weak base. The base dissociation constant, \( K_b \), is given as \( 1.76 \times 10^{-5} \). The relationship between \( K_b \), the concentration of the base (\([NH_3]\)), and the concentration of hydroxide ions (\([OH^-]\)) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[NH_4^+][OH^-]}{[NH_3]}
\]

Since NH₃ is a weak base, the concentration of NH₄⁺ is approximately equal to the concentration of OH⁻, denoted as \( x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([NH_3] = 0.1 - x\),
- \([NH_4^+] = x\),
- \([OH^-] = x\).

Substituting into the \( K_b \) expression:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.1 - x}
\]

Assuming \( x \) is small compared to 0.1 (a reasonable approximation for weak bases), we approximate \( 0.1 - x \approx 0.1 \):

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.1
\]

Substituting \( K_b = 1.76 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
x^2 = (1.76 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 0.1 = 1.76 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.76 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.326 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, \([OH^-] = 1.326 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\). The pOH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([OH^-]) = -\log(1.326 \times 10^{-3})
\]

\[
\log(1.326 \times 10^{-3}) = \log(1.326) + \log(10^{-3}) \approx 0.1213 - 3 = -2.8787
\]

\[
\text{pOH} = 2.8787
\]

Using the relationship \( \text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 2.8787 \approx 11.12
\]

The pH of the solution is approximately 11.12, which corresponds to option **I**.
