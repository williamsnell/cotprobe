Okay, so I have this question about converting the van der Waals parameter 'b' from decimeters cubed per mole to cubic meters per mole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that 1 decimeter is equal to 0.1 meters. Oh wait, wait, no, wait again. Because 1 meter is 10 decimeters, so 1 decimeter is 0.1 meters. Oh wait, no, wait a minute. No, wait, wait, no, wait. Actually, 1 meter is 10 decimeters. So 1 decimeter is 0.1 meters. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1 meter is 10 decimeters. So 1 dm equals 0.1 m? Wait, no, 10 decimeters make a meter, so 1 dm is 0.1 m. Yes, that's correct. Because if 10 dm = 1 m, then 1 dm = 0.1 m.

So, the given value is b = 0.0226 dm³/mol. I need to convert dm³ to m³. Since 1 dm is 0.1 m, then 1 dm³ is (0.1 m)³, which is 0.001 m³. Because (0.1)^3 is 0.001.

So, for each dm³, that's 0.001 m³. So, the value 0.0226 dm³/mol multiplied by 0.001 m³/dm³. Let me calculate that.

0.0226 * 0.001 is 0.0000226 m³/mol. Wait, but that's 2.26e-5 m³/mol. Let me count the decimal places. 0.0226 is 2.26e-2. Multiply by 1e-3 (since 0.001 = 1e-3), so 2.26e-2 * 1e-3 = 2.26e-5. So, 2.26e-5 m³/mol, which is the same as 0.0000226 m³ per mol.

Looking at the options, option G is 2.26e-5 m³/mol. Option H is 2.26e-4, which is ten times bigger, 10 times 0.000226. Option I is 2.26e-3, which is 0.00226. That's ten times larger than our calculation. Option F is 2.26, which is way too big. Option A is 22.6e-3, which is 0.0226, which is just the original value in dm³/mol. Oh wait, no, because we're converting dm³ to m³. So, option A is 0.0226 m³/mol, which is incorrect because we have to multiply by 1e-3 each time.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

The original value is 0.0226 dm³/mol. So, converting dm³ to m³.

1 dm³ = (0.1 m)^3 = 0.001 m³. So, 1 dm³ = 1e-3 m³. So, 0.0226 dm³ * (1 m³ / 1000 dm³) = 0.0226e-3 m³/mol? Wait, no. Because 0.0226 dm³ is equal to 0.0226 * (1e-3 m³/dm³) = 0.0226e-3 m³, which is 2.26e-5 m³. So yeah, option G is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 22.6e-3 m³/mol → which is same as 0.0226 m³/mol. That's wrong, because we're converting dm³ to m³, so it should be 0.0226 * 1e-3 = 2.26e-5.

Option G is 2.26e-5. So that's correct.

To convert the van der Waals parameter \( b = 0.0226 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \) to SI base units (m³ mol⁻¹), we use the conversion factor that \( 1 \, \mathrm{dm} = 0.1 \, \mathrm{m} \). Since \( 1 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = (0.1 \, \mathrm{m})^3 = 0.001 \, \mathrm{m}^3 \), we multiply by \( 10^{-3} \) to convert from dm³ to m³.

\[
0.0226 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{dm}^{-3} = 0.0000226 \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 2.26 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}.
\]

This matches option G, which is \( 2.26 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \).
