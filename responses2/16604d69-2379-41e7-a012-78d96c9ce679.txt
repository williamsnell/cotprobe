Okay, so I've got this problem here about how to divide the net income among two partners, Bob and Susan. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, let's read the problem again carefully. Bob and Susan invested $40,000 and $50,000 respectively. Mr. Gafney is the manager and gets 4% of the net income. Each partner gets 6% interest on their investment. Any remaining income is split equally. The net income is $28,600. 

Wait, waitâ€”so the total net income is $28,600. We need to allocate this among the three partners: Gafney, and the two partners (Bob and Medina). 

Each partner gets their own interest first, right? So first, calculate each partner's 6% share based on their investment. Then, subtract that from the net income. The remainder is what's left, which is split equally between them.

So, let me calculate each partner's interest first. 

Bob's investment is $40,000. He gets 6% of that. So 6% of 40k is 0.06 * 40,000 = $2,400. 

Medina's investment is $50,000. 6% of that is 0.06 * 50,000 = $3,000. 

So together, their interests sum up to 2,400 + 3,000 = $5,400. 

That's $5,400 from the net income. The remaining net income is 28,600 minus 5,400, which is 23,200. 

Now, this 23,200 is to be split equally between the two partners. So each gets half of 23,200. 

Half of 23,200 is 11,600. 

So Bob's total income is his interest plus his share of the remainder: 2,400 + 11,600 = $14,000. 

Medina's total income is 3,000 + 11,600 = $14,600. 

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 28,600 total income. Subtract the 5,400 interest: 23,200 left. Each gets 11,600. So Bob gets 2,400 + 11,600 = 14,000. Medina gets 3,000 + 11,600 = 14,600. 

Looking at the options, option B says Mr. Gafney's income is $14,000 and Ms. Medina's is $14,600. That matches. 

Wait, but wait, the options are labeled A to J. Let me look again. 

Option B: Mr. Gafney is $14k, Medina $14,600. That's what I got. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other charges or allocations? The problem says that Mr. Gafney gets 4% of net income. But in this calculation, we already accounted for that as part of the 23,200. 

Wait no, the 4% is part of the net income distribution. So the 28,600 is split into three parts: 4% to Gafney, and the remaining 5,400 and 23,200 for the partners. Wait, no, actually, the 4% is part of the 28,600. So the total is 28,600. 

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The 4% is an additional income for Mr. Gafney, not part of the 28,600. So the 4% is his own share. The remaining net income is the 28,600 minus 4% of 28,600. 

Wait, wait! Oh no, wait another approach. Let me think again. 

The correct way is: Each partner gets their interest (6% of their investment) first. Then, the net income after subtracting the interest is split. But wait, the 4% is an additional income for Mr. Gafney, not part of the net income. So the net income for the partners is separate. 

Wait, perhaps the 4% is a bonus from the net income, so it's not part of the 28,600. The 28,600 is the total net income, which includes all three partners' shares. 

Wait, no, the 4% is a separate payment. So the 4% is not part of the 28,600. Let me clarify the problem statement.

The problem says: "Mr. Gafney gets 4% of the net income." So that 4% is part of the net income. Then, each partner gets 6% interest on their investment. Any remaining net income is divided equally. 

Wait, that may not be correct. Because the net income is split into three parts: 4% for Gafney, and then the remaining after accounting for the 6% interests is split equally. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 4% is an additional bonus, so the total net income is 28,600. Mr. Gafney's share is 4% of 28,600. The remaining is 28,600 minus 4% of 28,600, which is 28,600 * 0.96. Wait, that's not correct because the 4% is separate. 

Wait no, perhaps the 4% is part of the net income. So Mr. Gafney's share is 4% of 28,600. Let me recalculate this.

If Mr. Gafney gets 4% of the net income, and the net income is 28,600, then 4% of 28,600 is 0.04 * 28,600 = 1,144. 

So Mr. Gafney's income is 1,144. 

Then, the remaining net income to distribute is 28,600 - 1,144 = 27,456. 

Now, each partner gets 6% interest on their investment. Bob's 40k gives 2,400, and Medina's 50k gives 3,000. So 2,400 + 3,000 = 5,400. 

So the remaining is 27,456 - 5,400 = 22,056. 

This 22,056 is to be split equally between Bob and Medina. So each gets 22,056 / 2 = 11,028. 

So Bob's total is 1,144 (his share) + 2,400 (interest) = 3,544. 

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the 4% was part of the 28,600 and the 23,200 was the remainder. But now this approach gives a different result. 

Hmm, but which approach is correct? 

I think the correct approach is that the 4% is part of the net income. So the 28,600 is the total, and Mr. Gafney gets 4% of it, then the remainder is split as per the 6% interests and the remaining.

Alternatively, perhaps each partner's interest is based on their investment, but Mr. Gafney's 4% is a separate item. So the 4% is not part of the 28,600. 

Wait, perhaps the 4% is an additional bonus. So the 28,600 is the total net income, including the bonus. So Mr. Gafney gets 4% of the 28,600, and the remaining is split based on their interests. 

Wait, but that would mean the 4% is of the total net income, which includes his bonus. That doesn't make sense because the bonus is an additional amount given by Mr. Gafney, not part of the net income. 

Wait, the problem statement says: "Mr. Gafney gets 4% of the net income." So the 4% is part of the net income. So the net income is 28,600, and Mr. Gafney's share is 4% of that. 

So that would be 0.04 * 28,600 = 1,144. 

Then, the remaining net income is 28,600 - 1,144 = 27,456. 

Now, each partner gets 6% interest on their investment. 

Bob's interest: 40,000 * 0.06 = 2,400. 

Medina's interest: 50,000 * 0.06 = 3,000. 

Total interest: 5,400. 

Remaining net income after interest: 27,456 - 5,400 = 22,056. 

This is split equally between Bob and Medina: 22,056 / 2 = 11,028 each. 

So Bob's total income is 1,144 (his share) + 2,400 (interest) = 3,544. 

Medina's total income is 1,144 (his share) + 3,000 (interest) = 4,144. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option where Bob has 3,544 and Medina 4,144. Let me check the options again. 

Wait the options are A to J, each with two amounts. Let me see. 

Option B says Bob gets 14,000, Medina 14,600. So no, this seems different. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the 4% part. Let me think again. Maybe the 4% is not part of the net income. Maybe Mr. Gafney's 4% is a separate payment, but it's not included in the 28,600. 

Wait, that can't be. Because the problem says the net income is $28,600. So the 4% is part of that? Or not? 

Wait, the problem says Mr. Gafney gets 4% of the net income. So 4% of 28,600 is 1,144. So that's his share. 

So the remaining net income is 28,600 - 1,144 = 27,456. 

Now, each partner's 6% interest is calculated, and any remaining is split equally. 

So Bob's interest: 40,000 * 0.06 = 2,400. 

Medina's: 50,000 * 0.06 = 3,000. 

Total interest: 5,400. 

So the remaining 27,456 - 5,400 = 22,056. 

Divide equally: 22,056 / 2 = 11,028 each. 

So Bob's total income: 1,144 + 2,400 = 3,544. 

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again. 

Looking at the options:

Option B: Bob 14k, Medina 14.6k. 

Option A: Bob 12.6k, Medina 16k. 

Wait, none of these seem to match 3,544 and 4,144. Hmm. That suggests I'm making a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps the 4% is part of the 28,600. Let me recalculate that approach. 

If Mr. Gafney's 4% is part of the 28,600, then he gets 0.04 * 28,600 = 1,144. 

The remaining is 28,600 - 1,144 = 27,456. 

Now, each partner gets 6% interest on their investment. 

Bob's 6% is 2,400, and Medina's is 3,000. 

Total interest is 5,400. 

Remaining: 27,456 -5,400 = 22,056. 

Divided equally: 11,028 each. 

So Bob's total is 1,144 (his share) + 2,400 (interest) = 3,544. 

Medina's total is 1,144 + 3,000 = 4,144. 

Looking at the options, none of the options match. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check. 

Wait, the options are:

A: Gafney 12k, Medina 16k. 

B: Gafney 14k, Medina 14.6k. 

C: Gafney 14.572, Medina 15.028. 

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I didn't calculate the 4% correctly. Wait, 4% of 28,600 is 1,144. 

Wait, perhaps the 4% is a bonus, but not part of the net income, so 28,600 is the total after considering all three partners. 

Wait, that would mean Mr. Gafney's 4% is separate. So the net income is 28,600, but Mr. Gafney gets an additional 4% from it, but that's not part of the 28,600. That doesn't make sense because the net income is the total. 

Alternatively, perhaps Mr. Gafney's 4% is part of the net income. So in that case, the 4% is 1,144, and the remaining is 27,456. 

But I don't see any option that gives Bob 14k and Medina 14.6k. Let me think againâ€”did I miscompute the interest? 

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each step again more carefully. 

Let's recalculate the interest:

Bob: 40,000 * 0.06 = 2,400. 

Medina: 50,000 * 0.06 = 3,000. 

Total interest: 2,400 + 3,000 = 5,400. 

Net income after interest: 28,600 - 5,400 = 23,200. 

This 23,200 is split equally between the two partners: 23,200 / 2 = 11,600 each. 

So Bob's total share: 2,400 (interest) + 11,600 (remainder) = 14,000. 

Medina's: 3,000 (interest) + 11,600 = 14,600. 

So Bob gets 14,000, Medina 14,600. 

Looking at the options, that's option B. 

So the correct answer is option B. 

Wait, but earlier when I considered the 4% as part of the 28,600, I got a different result. But perhaps that's not the case. The problem states that Mr. Gafney gets 4% of the net income. So the net income is 28,600, and Mr. Gafney's share is 4% of that. So 1,144. 

Then the remaining is 27,456, which is split equally. 

So Bob gets his interest plus 11,600, which totals 14,000. 

Medina gets her interest plus 11,600, totaling 14,600. 

So option B is correct. 

Wait, but earlier I thought that the 4% was part of the 28,600, but that doesn't make sense because the 4% is part of the net income. 

So I think option B is correct. 
</think>

The correct option is B.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the 6% interest for each partner:**
   - Bob's investment: $40,000 â†’ 6% of 40,000 = $2,400.
   - Medina's investment: $50,000 â†’ 6% of 50,000 = $3,000.
   - Total interest: $2,400 + $3,000 = $5,400.

2. **Subtract the total interest from the net income:**
   - Net income: $28,600.
   - Subtract interest: $28,600 - $5,400 = $23,200.

3. **Split the remaining amount equally between Bob and Medina:**
   - $23,200 / 2 = $11,600 each.

4. **Calculate each partner's total income:**
   - Bob's total income: $2,400 (interest) + $11,600 (remainder) = $14,000.
   - Medina's total income: $3,000 (interest) + $11,600 (remainder) = $14,600.

Thus, Bob's share is $14,000 and Medina's share is $14,600, which corresponds to option B.
