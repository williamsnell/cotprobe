Okay, so I've got this question here about a utility function and a job offer. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The investor has a utility function U(x) = x^(1/4), and he's considering a new job offer. The job pays $80,000 with a bonus that can be $0 to $60,000, each with equal probability. We need to find the certainty equivalent of this offer.

Wait, what's a certainty equivalent? Oh right, it's the amount of money that would make the investor as satisfied as taking the risk in the job offer. So instead of thinking about the uncertain outcome, the investor would accept a certain amount that gives the same utility. 

The job offer's salary is $80,000 plus a bonus. So the total expected salary is the sum of each possible bonus plus $80k. But wait, the bonus itself is a random variable. Each bonus is 0,10k,20k,...,60k, each with 1/7 probability.

Wait no, wait. The bonus is given as 0,10k,20k,...,60k, each with equal probability. So the possible total salaries are 80k + 0, 80k+10k, 80k+20k, etc. So the possible outcomes are 80k, 90k, 100k, 110k, 120k, 130k, 140k. Each with 1/7 chance.

The utility function is x^(1/4). So the expected utility would be the average of the utilities of each possible outcome, right? So to find the certainty equivalent CE, we set CE^(1/4) equal to the expectation of utilities.

So let's compute E[U] = (1/7) * [ (80k)^(1/4) + (90k)^(1/4) + (100k)^(1/4) + (110k)^(1/4) + (120k)^(1/4) + (130k)^(1/4) + (140k)^(1/4) } ]

Then the CE is [E[U]]^4.

So let's compute each term.

Let me note that 80k is 80,000, so 80,000^(1/4). Let me calculate that. The fourth root of 80,000.

Wait, 16^4 is 65536, which is 16^4=65536, which is less than 80,000. 17^4 is 83521. So 80,000 is between 16^4 and 17^4. Let's find a better approximation. 16.5^4: 
16.5^2 = 272.25, then squared is 272.25^2. Let's compute that. 272 * 272 is 73984, but wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 16.5^4 = (16.5^2)^2. 16.5 squared is 272.25, so 272.25 squared. Let me calculate 272.25 * 272.25.

Let me compute 272 * 272: 272 * 272 is 73984. But wait, 272.25 is 272 + 0.25, so (272.25)^2 = (272 + 0.25)^2 = 272^2 + 2*272*(0.25) + 0.25^2.

Which is 73984 + 136 + 0.0625 = 74120.0625. So 16.5^4 is 74120.0625. But our x is 80,000. So 80,000 is higher than 74,120.06.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of x^(1/4). Let me think of each term.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term numerically.

Let me list each possible bonus and total salary, then compute their fourth roots.

Total salary x: 80k,90k,100k,110k,120k,130k,140k.

Compute x^(1/4):

80k = 80,000. Let's compute 80,000^(1/4).

Hmm, 16^4 is 65536 (16^2=256, 256^2=65536).

So 16.5^4 is about 74120.06, as calculated before.

80,000 is between 16^4 and 16.5^4. Let's compute 16.5^4=74120 as above. So 80k is 80,000, which is 5,880 higher than 74,120.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 80k^(1/4) using logarithms or another method.

Alternatively, I can approximate using natural logarithms.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the fourth roots step by step.

Let me think about each term:

Compute for x = 80k: x^(1/4) = (80,000)^(1/4)
Similarly for 90k, 100k, etc.

But perhaps it's easier to just compute each one in a calculator, but since I can't, I'll think in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to note that 80,000 is 80 * 10^3. So 80,000^(1/4) = (80)^(1/4) * (10^3)^(1/4) = (80)^(1/4) * 10^(3/4).

But 80 is 16 *5. So 16 is 2^4, so 16^(1/4) is 2. 5^(1/4) is approximately 1.495. So 80^(1/4) = 2 * 1.495 ≈ 2.99 (approx 3).

Wait, that can't be right. 80 is 16 *5, so 16^(1/4) is 2. 5^(1/4)=sqrt(sqrt(5))=sqrt(2.236)=approx 1.495. So 80^(1/4)=2 *1.495 = about 2.99, which is about 3.

So 80k^(1/4) ≈ 3 * 10^(3/4). 10^(3/4) is 10^0.75≈5.623.

Wait, 10^0.75 = e^(0.75 * ln10 ) ≈ e^(0.75 * 2.302585) ≈ e^1.726938 ≈ 5.623.

So 80k^(1/4) ≈3 *5.623≈16.869.

Wait, but that's only for x=80,000. Wait, no, that's the fourth root of 80,000. Wait, no, no—wait, 80k is 80,000. So 80k^(1/4) is 80,000^(0.25) ≈ let me compute 80,000^(1/4).

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms:

ln(80000) = ln(8 *10^4) = ln(8) + ln(10^4) = 3 ln 2 + 4 ln10 ≈ 3*(0.6931) +4*(2.302585) → 2.0793 +9.21034=11.2896.

Divide by 4: 11.2896/4=2.8224.

Then e^2.8224: e^2 is ~7.389, e^0.8224 is about 2.28 (since ln(2)=0.693, ln(2.28)=0.822). So e^2.8224 ≈7.389 * 2.28 ≈16.86. So yes, 16.86.

Similarly, 80k^(1/4)=~16.86.

Wait, but wait, if x is 80,000, then x^(1/4) is 80k^(0.25)= (8e4)^(0.25)= (8^(0.25)) * (e4)^(0.25). Which is 8^(0.25)=2, since 2^3=8, so 2^(4)=8. So 8^(0.25)=2. Similarly, e4^(0.25)= (10^4)^(0.25)=10^(1)=10. So 80k^(0.25)=2*10=20? That doesn't make sense because 2^4 is 16, 10^4 is 10,000. Wait, no. Wait, 80k is 80,000, which is 80 *1e3.

Wait, let me compute 80,000^(1/4) more accurately.

80,000 =8*10^4.

So (8*10^4)^(1/4) = (8)^(1/4) * (10^4)^(1/4) = 8^(1/4) *10.

Because (10^4)^(1/4)=10^1=10.

So 8^(1/4)=2, since 2^4=16? Wait wait, no. Wait, 2^4 is 16, but 8 is 2^3, so 8^(1/4)=2^(3/4)= about 1.6818.

So 8^(1/4)=1.6818. So 80k^(1/4)=1.6818 *10=16.818. So approx 16.818.

So 80k^(1/4)=≈16.818.

Ok, so x=80k: U(x)=16.818.

Now x=90k: 90,000 =9*1e4 =9*10^4.

So (9*10^4)^(1/4)= (9)^(1/4) *10.

Now, 9^(1/4)=sqrt(sqrt(9))=sqrt(3)=approx1.732.

So 90k^(1/4)=1.732 *10=17.32.

Next, x=100k:100,000=10^5.

So (1e5)^(1/4)= (1e5)^(0.25)= (1e5)^(1/4)= (1e5)^(1/4)= Let's compute 1e5.

1e5=10^5= (10^2.5)^2= (sqrt(10^5))=sqrt(31623)= about 177.8279.

Wait, perhaps another approach: 10^5 is 10^4 *10=10000*10.

So 10000 is 10^4. So (1e5)^(1/4)= (1e4 *10)^(1/4)= (1e4)^(1/4) * (10)^(1/4).

(1e4)^(1/4)= (10^4)^(1/4)=10^(1)=10.

(10)^(1/4)= approx 1.778.

So 100k^(1/4)=10 *1.778=17.78.

Ok, x=100k: ~17.78.

x=110k:110,000=11*1e4.

So (11*1e4)^(1/4)= (11)^(1/4) *10.

(11)^(1/4)= approximately 1.821.

Because 1.821^4= (approx 1.821^2)^2.

1.821^2≈3.316, then squared is about 10.997, which is ~11. So yes, 1.821^4≈11.

So 110k^(1/4)=1.821 *10=18.21.

x=110k: ~18.21.

x=120k:120,000=12*1e4.

(12)^(1/4)= let's see. 12^(1/2)=3.464. So 3.464^2=12, so 12^(1/4)=sqrt(3.464)= approx 1.86.

So 120k^(1/4)=1.86 *10=18.6.

x=120k: ~18.6.

x=130k:130,000=13*1e4.

(13)^(1/4)= approximately sqrt(sqrt(13)).

sqrt(13)=3.6055. sqrt(3.6055)= approx 1.898.

So 130k^(1/4)=1.898 *10=18.98.

x=130k: ~18.98.

x=140k:140,000=14*1e4.

(14)^(1/4)=sqrt(sqrt(14)).

sqrt(14)=3.7417, sqrt(3.7417)= approx 1.934.

So 140k^(1/4)=1.934 *10=19.34.

So, compiling all x:

x | x^(1/4)
80k| ~16.818
90k| ~17.32
100k| ~17.78
110k| ~18.21
120k| ~18.6
130k| ~18.98
140k| ~19.34

Now, the expectation is the average of these, since each outcome has equal weight (1/7). So we'll compute the sum of all seven terms and divide by 7.

Let's compute each term:

Add them up:

16.818 +17.32 =34.138

+17.78 → 51.918

+18.21 →69.128

+18.6 →87.728

+18.98 →106.708

+19.34 →126.048.

Total sum is 126.048.

Average is 126.048 /7= approximately 18.0068.

So E[U]=18.0068.

Now, the CE is [E(U)]^4. So compute 18.0068^4.

Hmm, let's compute step by step.

First, 18^4 is 104976. Because 18^2=324, 324^2=104976.

But 18.0068 is a bit more than 18, so the fourth power will be a little more than 104976.

Let's compute (18 + 0.0068)^4.

Using the binomial expansion:

(18)^4 = 104976.

(18 + 0.0068)^4 = 104976 + 4*(18)^3*(0.0068) + 6*(18)^2*(0.0068)^2 + ... 

But considering that 0.0068 is small, the higher terms will be negligible. So let's compute up to the third term.

Compute 4*(18)^3*(0.0068):

18^3 = 5832.

4 * 5832 =23328.

Multiply by 0.0068: 23328 *0.0068 = approx 157.  (23328 *0.006=139.968; 23328*0.0008=1866.24. So 139.968 +1866.24=2006.208. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 23328 *0.0068 is 23328 * (6.8e-3)= 23328 *6.8e-3= (23328 *6)=139968, plus 23328 *0.8=1866.24 → total 141,634.24e-3? No, wait, wait—no, wait 23328 *6.8e-3 = (23328 *6.8)/1000.

23328 *6.8: Let's compute 23328 *6 =139968, and 23328 *0.8=18662.4. So total 139968 +18662.4=158,630.4. Divide by 1000: 158.6304.

So 4*(18)^3*(0.0068)= approx 158.6304.

Now the third term in the expansion is 6*(18)^2*(0.0068)^2.

Compute 18^2=324.

(0.0068)^2=0.00004624.

Multiply:324 *0.00004624= approx 0.01499.

Multiply by 6: 0.08994.

So the overall approximation is 104976 +158.6304 +0.08994≈105134.72.

So CE is approximately 105134.72.

Wait, but let me double-check these calculations.

Wait, the first term is 104976.

The second term is 158.6304.

The third term is 0.08994.

So adding them: 104976 +158.6304=105134.6304 +0.08994=105134.7203.

So CE ≈105134.72.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you compute the expectation, you get 18.0068, and raising that to the fourth power gives 18.0068^4. Let me compute 18.0068^2:

18.0068^2 = approx 18^2 + 2*18*0.0068 + (0.0068)^2.

Which is 324 + 2.448 + 0.00004624≈326.44804624.

Then, 326.44804624^2 = ?

Wait, that's a bit time-consuming, but let me approximate.

Let me think that 326.44804624 is approximately 326.448.

So 326.448^2.

Let me compute 326 *326 = 105,  let's compute 326^2: 326 *326.

300^2=90,000; 26^2=676; 2*300*26=15,600. So 90,000 +15,600 +676=106,276.

Now, 326.448 is 326 +0.448.

So (326 +0.448)^2=326^2 + 2*326*0.448 +0.448^2.

Compute each term:

326^2=106,276.

2*326*0.448=652 *0.448. Let me compute 652 *0.4=260.8; 652 *0.048=31.296. So total 260.8+31.296=292.096.

0.448^2=0.199.

So adding all together: 106,276 +292.096=106,568.096 +0.199=106,568.295.

So 326.448^2≈106,568.3.

So CE is approximately 106,568.3.

Wait, but earlier I had CE as about 105,134.72, which is about 105,135. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps when adding up the terms.

Because when I computed the expectation E[U], I got 18.0068, which when raised to the fourth power gives CE. Let me recompute that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term's fourth power and then average.

Wait, but the way I did it before, sum all the x^(1/4) terms, multiply by 1/7, then raise that result to the fourth power.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute E[U] first accurately and then compute CE as (E[U])^4.

Wait, perhaps I should do that.

So, let me compute each E[U] term accurately:

x |x^(1/4)
80k|16.818
90k|17.32
100k|17.78
110k|18.21
120k|18.6
130k|18.98
140k|19.34

So the sum is 16.818 +17.32=34.138; plus17.78=51.918; plus18.21=70.128; plus18.6=88.728; plus18.98=107.708; plus19.34=127.048.

Sum is 127.048.

Average E[U]=127.048 /7=18.1497.

So E[U]=18.1497.

Now, CE is (18.1497)^4.

Let me compute that.

Compute 18^4 as before: 104976.

Now, 18.1497 is 18 +0.1497.

So, (18 +0.1497)^4.

Using the binomial expansion:

(18)^4 +4*(18)^3*(0.1497) +6*(18)^2*(0.1497)^2 +4*(18)*(0.1497)^3 + (0.1497)^4.

Compute each term:

1. 18^4=104976.

2. 4*(18)^3*(0.1497)=4*5832*0.1497.

5832 *4=23328.

23328 *0.1497= Let's compute 23328 *0.1=2332.8; 23328 *0.04=933.12; 23328 *0.009=210. (Wait, 23328 *0.009=210. 23328 *0.0007=16.33).

So adding up:

2332.8 +933.12=3265.92; +210=3475.92; +16.33=3492.25.

So term 2 is 3492.25.

3. 6*(18)^2*(0.1497)^2.

(18)^2=324.

(0.1497)^2=0.02241.

Multiply:324 *0.02241= 324 *0.02=6.48; 324 *0.00241=0.780. So total 6.48 +0.780=7.26.

Multiply by 6:7.26 *6=43.56.

So term3=43.56.

4. 4*(18)*(0.1497)^3.

(0.1497)^3=0.003356.

18 *0.003356=0.060408.

Multiply by4:0.060408 *4=0.241632.

So term4=0.241632.

5. (0.1497)^4= approx 0.000371.

So adding all terms:

104976 (term1)

+ 3492.25 (term2) →104976+3492.25=108,468.25.

+43.56 →108,468.25+43.56=108,511.81.

+0.241632 →108,512.051632.

+0.000371 →108,512.0519.

So CE is approximately 108,512.05.

Looking at the options:

A) 105,000 → too low.

B)106,200 → too low.

C)107,600 → too low.

D)108,610 → 108,610 is higher than 108,512, which is CE.

E)115,000 → way higher.

So the closest CE to CE≈108,512 is option D:108,610.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct method is to compute the expected utility correctly, but in the options, D is 108,610.

So I think the answer is D.
</think>

To determine the certainty equivalent (CE), we compute the expected utility (EU) and then find CE as the fourth root of EU. 

### Step 1: Compute EU
The utility function is \( U(x) = x^{1/4} \). For each possible outcome (salary), compute \( x^{1/4} \) and average them since each outcome is equally likely.

| Salary (x) | \( x^{1/4} \) |
|--------------|---------------|
| 80,000       | ~16.818       |
| 90,000       | ~17.32        |
| 100,000      | ~17.78        |
| 110,000      | ~18.21        |
| 120,000      | ~18.60        |
| 130,000      | ~18.98        |
| 140,000      | ~19.34        |

Sum of \( x^{1/4} \) values:
\[
16.818 + 17.32 + 17.78 + 18.21 + 18.60 + 18.98 + 19.34 = 127.048
\]

Average EU:
\[
\text{E[U]} = \frac{127.048}{7} \approx 18.1497
\]

### Step 2: Compute CE
CE is \( (\text{E[U]})^4 \).
\[
\text{CE} = (18.1497)^4
\]

Using binomial expansion:
\[
(18 + 0.1497)^4 = 18^4 + 4(18)^3(0.1497) + 6(18)^2(0.1497)^2 + 4(18)(0.1497)^3 + (0.1497)^4
\]

Calculations:
1. \( 18^4 = 104976 \)
2. \( 4(18)^3(0.1497) = 3492.25 \)
3. \( 6(18)^2(0.1497)^2 = 43.56 \)
4. \( 4(18)(0.1497)^3 = 0.241632 \)
5. \( (0.1497)^4 \approx 0.000371 \)

Summing all terms:
\[
104976 + 3492.25 + 43.56 + 0.241632 + 0.000371 \approx 108512.05
