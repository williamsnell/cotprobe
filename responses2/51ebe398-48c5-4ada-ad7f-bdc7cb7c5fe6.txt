Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to apply the Graeffe's root squaring method to find the roots of the equation x³ - 2x + 2 = 0, correct to two decimals. Then, I have to find the sum of these roots. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this method, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, I think Graeffe's method is used to find the roots of polynomials, especially when they have complex roots or when you need to square the roots. The idea is to eliminate the lower degree terms by a process that involves squaring the roots. So, I remember that for a cubic equation, you can use this method to find the sum of the squares of the roots, which might be helpful.

Wait, the question is asking for the sum of the roots, not their squares. Oh right, the sum of the roots of a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d =0 is -b/a. In this case, the equation is x³ - 2x + 2 =0, so a is 1, b is 0 because there's no x² term. So, the sum of the roots should be 0. But wait, that's the sum of the roots, not their squares. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says: "What's the sum of these roots?" So yes, it's the sum of the roots, not the sum of their squares or anything else. So, if it's the sum, then it's 0. But the options don't have 0 as an option. Wait, looking back, the options are A:1, B:2.5, C:3, D:-1, E:-3, F:2, G:5.5, H:0, I:-2, J:4. Oh, H is 0. So that would be the answer. But wait, wait a second. Maybe I'm making a mistake here because I thought Graeffe's method was about finding something different.

Wait another thought: what does the question really ask? It says, after applying the method, what's the sum of the roots. Since the sum is -b/a, which is 0, and 0 is an option, maybe that's the answer. But I'm a bit confused because I also remember that sometimes, when you apply Graeffe's method, you can find the squares of the roots, and perhaps the sum of the squares is related.

Let me think again. The equation is x³ - 2x + 2 =0. Let me write it as x³ + 0x² - 2x +2 =0. So, in the standard form, a=1, b=0, c=-2, d=2.

The sum of the roots is -b/a = 0. So, the sum is zero. So the answer must be H:0. But why would the question even include such a straightforward answer? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is using the Graeffe's method. So, perhaps the method is being applied to find the sum, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the sum of the squares of the roots, but the question isn't asking for that.

Wait, the question is clearly asking for the sum of the roots. So, if the equation is x³ -2x + 2=0, then the sum of the roots is 0, which is option H. But I'm a bit confused because the question also mentions applying Graeffe's method. So, perhaps the method is being used to find something else, like the sum of the squares of the roots. Let me think about that.

Graeffe's method is often used to find the sum of the squares of the roots. The way it works is by creating a new polynomial whose roots are the squares of the original roots. The coefficients of this new polynomial can be found using the original coefficients.

For the cubic equation x³ + a x² + b x + c =0, the sum of the roots is -a. The sum of the squares of the roots is (sum of roots)^2 minus 2 times the sum of the products of the roots two at a time. Using the standard formula for sum of squares: (r1 + r2 + r3)^2 = r1² + r2² + r3² + 2(r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3). So, sum of squares is (sum roots)^2 - 2(sum of products two at a time).

In our case, the equation is x³ + 0x² -2x +2=0. So sum of roots is 0. The sum of the products of roots two at a time is (r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3) = c/a = (-2)/1= -2.

So, sum of squares = (0)^2 - 2*(-2) = 0 +4=4. So, the sum of the squares of the roots is 4, which is option J:4.

But wait, the question isn't asking for that. It's asking for the sum of the roots, which is zero. So the correct answer should be option H:0.

Wait, but let's make sure. Another thought: maybe I should double-check the application of Graeffe's method. But no, the question just says to apply it to find the roots, correct to two decimals, but it's not clear whether that affects the sum. The sum is a property of the roots, not of the coefficients.

So, regardless of the method applied, the sum remains the same. So, the sum is zero, which is option H.

The question asks for the sum of the roots of the equation \( x^3 - 2x + 2 = 0 \). Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots of a cubic equation \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \) is given by \( -b/a \). For the given equation, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 0 \), so the sum of the roots is \( 0 \).

Thus, the correct answer is the option that represents 0, which is **H: 0**.

Answer: H
