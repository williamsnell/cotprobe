Okay, so I've got this problem here where a group of 9 people is split into 3 committees, each consisting of 3 people. The question is asking how many ways this can be done, and the committees are identical except for their members. The options are given from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with dividing people into groups, especially into identical groups, we have to be careful about overcounting or undercounting because the order in which we choose the groups doesn't matter. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the total number of people is 9, and we need to split them into 3 groups of 3 each. Since the committees are identical, the order in which we form the groups doesn't matter. So, if I were to imagine forming the first group, then the second, and then the third, I would be overcounting because different orders of forming the same groups would result in the same division.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the number of ways to split them into groups step by step and then adjust for overcounting.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Choose 3 people out of 9 for the first committee. The number of ways to do this is C(9,3), which is 84.
2. Then, choose 3 people out of the remaining 6 for the second committee. That's C(6,3) = 20.
3. The last 3 people automatically form the third committee, which is only 1 way.

So, multiplying these together gives 84 * 20 * 1 = 1680. But wait, this counts the number of ordered ways, right? Because the first, second, and third steps correspond to different orders of forming the same groups. Since the committees are identical, we've actually overcounted by a factor of 3! (because there are 3! ways to order the same set of three groups). So, we need to divide by 6 (since 3! = 6) to account for the identical groups.

So, 1680 divided by 6 is 280. Hmm, that gives me 280, which is one of the options (F). Alternatively, I remember another approach where you divide by the factorial of the number of groups when they're identical.

Alternatively, let me think about the formula for dividing n items into groups of size k. The formula is n! / ( (k!)^m * m! ), where m is the number of groups. Here, n is 9, k is 3, and m is 3. Plugging in, we get 9! / ( (3!^3) * 3! ) = 362880 / ( (6*6*6) * 6 ) = 362880 / ( 216 * 6 ) = 362880 / 1296. Let me compute that.

Calculating 9! = 362880. 3!^3 is 6*6*6=216. 3! is 6. So denominator is 216 *6 = 1296. So 362880 /1296. Let me compute how many times 1296 goes into 362880.

Well, 1296 * 280 is 1296 * 200 = 259200, 1296 *80= 103680. So 259200+103680=362880. So 280. So the same result as before.

So the answer should be 280, which is option F.

The correct answer is F: 280.

Answer:
F: 280
