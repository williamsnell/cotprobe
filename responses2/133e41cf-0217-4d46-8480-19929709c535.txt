Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the value of 11 # 5 using the given conditions. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the rules.

The problem says: For all real numbers r and s, define the operation # such that:
1. r # 0 = r
2. r # s = s # r (so it's commutative)
3. (r + 1) # s = (r # s) + s + 1

And I need to find 11 # 5. The options are given from A to J, with answer choices ranging from 11 to 81, and some others. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's break down what each condition tells us. The first condition is straightforward: anything # 0 is just itself. That might be useful for simplifying expressions.

The second condition says that the operation is commutative, so the order of the operands doesn't matter. That could help in simplifying calculations or expressing in terms of a single variable.

The third condition is a recursive formula. It tells us how the operation behaves when we add 1 to the first operand. So, (r+1) # s equals (r # s) plus s plus 1. That suggests that this operation has a pattern or formula that can be built up step by step.

I think I can try to find a general formula for r # s by applying the third condition multiple times. Let's see.

Let's try to compute a few small values to see the pattern.

For example, let's compute 1 # 1. Using the third condition, (0 + 1) #1 = (0 #1) +1 +1. From condition 1, 0 #1 =0, so this is 0 +1 +1 =2. So 1 #1 =2.

Similarly, let's compute 1 #2. Using condition 3, (0 +1) #2 = (0 #2) +2 +1 =0 +2 +1=3. So 1 #2=3.

Wait, but 1 #1 is 2, 1 #2 is 3. Hmm, it seems like when the first operand increases by 1, the result increases by 1. But wait, let's check 2 #1. Because the operation is commutative, 2 #1 should be the same as 1 #2, which we've found to be 3. So 2 #1=3.

What about 2 #2? Using condition 3, (1 +1) #2 = (1 #2) +2 +1. We know 1 #2=3, so 3 +2 +1=6. So 2 #2=6.

Wait, but 2 #2=6. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me compute more values.

3 #1: Using condition 3, (2 +1) #1 = (2 #1) +1 +1. 2 #1=3, so 3 +1 +1=5. So 3 #1=5.

3 #2: Since it's commutative, 3 #2=2 #3. Let's compute 2 #3. Using condition 3, (1 +1) #3 = (1 #3) +3 +1. 1 #3 would be (0 +1) #3 = (0 #3)+3 +1=0 +3 +1=4. So 1 #3=4. Then 2 #3=4 +3 +1=8. So 3 #2=8.

Hmm, let me write down these results so I can see a pattern.

Let's list the values of r # s for s from 0 to, say, 3 and r from 0 to 3.

s=0:
r #0 = r. So 0,1,2,3,... etc.

s=1:
0#1=0
1#1=2
2#1=3
3#1=5

s=2:
0#2=0
1#2=3
2#2=6
3#2=8

s=3:
0#3=0
1#3=4
2#3=8
3#3=12 (because (2+1)#3= (2#3) +3 +1=8+3+1=12)

Wait, but let me compute 3#3 step by step. From condition 3, (2+1)#3 = (2#3) +3 +1. 2#3 was found to be 8, so 8 +3 +1=12. So 3#3=12.

Looking at these results, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula. Let's see:

For each r and s, r # s seems to depend on some combination of r and s. Let's see if I can find a formula.

Looking at r # s:

For s=0, it's r.

For s=1:

r #1 = r + (r +1) ?

Wait, let's see:

r #1:
r=0: 0 #1=0 → 0
r=1:1 #1=2 → 1 +1=2
r=2:2 #1=3 → 2 +1=3
r=3:3 #1=5 → 3 +2=5
r=4:4 #1=6 →4 +2=6

Hmm, that doesn't fit a simple pattern. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me consider the third condition more carefully.

The third condition is: (r +1) # s = (r # s) + s +1.

This suggests that adding 1 to r increases the result by s +1. So, this is similar to a recursive process where each increment in r adds s+1 to the previous value.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's think of r # s as a function f(r) where f(r) = r # s.

Then, f(r +1) = f(r) + s +1.

This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(r) = f(0) + (r) * (s +1), since each step increases by a constant.

But wait, from condition 1, f(0) =0 #s=0.

So f(r) =0 + r*(s +1) )= r(s +1).

Wait, but let's test this with the values I have.

For example, s=1:
f(r) = r*(1+1)= 2r.

Wait, let's check:

r=1: 1*2=2 → correct.
r=2: 2*2=4 → but earlier, 2 #1=3. Hmm, that's a problem. So this formula doesn't hold for s=1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence.

Wait, the recurrence is f(r+1) = f(r) + s +1.

So, for s=1, f(r+1)=f(r) +2.

Let's compute f(r) for s=1:

f(0)=0
f(1)=f(0)+2=0+2=2
f(2)=f(1)+2=4
f(3)=6
f(4)=8

Wait, but earlier I thought 3 #1=5, but according to this, 3#1=6.

But when I computed earlier using the third condition, I got 3 #1=5. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the recurrence. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the third condition is (r+1) # s = (r # s) + s +1.

So, for s=1, (r+1) #1 = (r #1) + 1 +1 = (r #1) +2.

So, f(r+1) = f(r) +2.

So starting from f(0)=0:

r=0:0
r=1:0+2=2
r=2:2+2=4
r=3:4+2=6
r=4:6+2=8

But earlier, when I computed 3 #1 using the third condition, I got 3 #1=5.

Wait, so this suggests that my calculation was wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, when s=1, the third condition says:

(r+1) #1 = (r #1) +1+1 = (r #1) +2.

So for r=0, 1 #1 =0 +2=2.

r=1:2 #1 = (1 #1) +2=2 +2=4.

r=2:3 #1= (2 #1) +2=4 +2=6.

r=3:4 #1=6 +2=8.

But earlier, when I computed 3 #1 using the third condition, I thought it was 5. How did I get that? Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Let me recompute 3 #1 step by step using the third condition. So:

3 #1 = (2+1) #1 = (2 #1) +1 +1.

We need to find 2 #1. Let's compute that.

2 #1 = (1+1) #1 = (1 #1) +1 +1 =2 +1 +1=4.

So 2 #1=4.

Now, 3 #1=4 +1 +1=6.

Wait, so 3 #1=6, not 5 as I previously thought. I must have made a miscalculation earlier.

So 3 #1=6. Similarly, 4 #1= (3 #1) +2=6+2=8.

So with this, the pattern for r #1 seems to be 2r. Because:

r=0:0 → 0
r=1:2 → 2*1=2
r=2:4 →2*2=4
r=3:6 →2*3=6
r=4:8 →2*4=8

So, for s=1, r #1 = 2r.

Hmm, so for each s, perhaps the general formula is r # s = r*(s+1). Because for s=1, r*(1+1)=2r, which matches.

Let me test this with s=2.

s=2:

r #2.

Using the third condition, (r+1) #2 = (r #2) +2 +1 = (r #2) +3.

Let's compute for r=0:

0 #2=0.

r=1:1 #2 =0 #2 +3=0+3=3.

r=2:2 #2=3 +3=6.

r=3:3 #2=6 +3=9.

r=4:4 #2=9 +3=12.

So the values are 0,3,6,9,12,...

Which is 3r. So 3r is r*(2+1)=3r.

Similarly, for s=3:

r #3.

Using the third condition, (r+1) #3 = (r #3) +3 +1= (r #3)+4.

Compute step by step:

r=0:0 #3=0.

r=1:1 #3=0 +4=4.

r=2:2 #3=4 +4=8.

r=3:3 #3=8 +4=12.

r=4:12 +4=16.

So the results are 0,4,8,12,16,... which is 4r. So for s=3, r #3=4r.

Hmm, so it seems that for general s, r # s = (s+1)*r.

Wait, let's test this for s=0:

r #0 = r*(0+1) =r*1= r → which matches condition 1.

s=1: r*(1+1)=2r → matches.

s=2: r*3=3r → matches.

s=3:4r → yes.

So the formula seems to hold: r # s = (s +1) * r.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's check s=4 to see if this holds.

s=4:

r #4.

Using condition 3:

(r+1) #4 = (r #4) +4 +1 → (r #4)+5.

Compute step by step:

r=0:0 #4=0.

r=1:1 #4=0+5=5.

r=2:5+5=10.

r=3:10+5=15.

r=4:15+5=20.

So the results are 0,5,10,15,20,... which is 5r. So 5r= (4+1)*r → 5r, which holds.

So yes, the formula r #s = (s+1)*r seems to hold for all s and r.

Wait, that's a big revelation. So the operation is just multiplication of r by (s+1). So 11 #5 would be 5+1=6. So 11*6=66. Looking at the options, option I is 66.

But wait, let's make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again.

If r # s = (s+1)*r, then 11 #5 = (5+1)*11=6*11=66.

Wait, but earlier when I computed 3 #1 using the recurrence, I thought it was 6. Which matches the formula.

But let me check another case. Let's compute 2 #3. According to the formula, it's (3+1)*2=4*2=8. Earlier, I computed 2 #3=8, which matches.

Another test: 4 #2 = (2+1)*4=3*4=12. Which matches what I had earlier.

So yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, 11 #5 is 6*11=66. So the correct answer is option I, which is 66.
</think>

The operation $\#$ is defined such that $r \# s = (s + 1) \cdot r$. Applying this to $11 \# 5$, we get:

$11 \# 5 = (5 + 1) \cdot 11 = 6 \cdot 11 = 66$.

Answer: I: 66
