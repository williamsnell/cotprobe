Okay, so I have this economics question here about hiring the least-cost combination of labor and capital. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question is asking which condition must be met when a firm wants to hire the least-cost combination. I remember from my notes that this has to do with the concept of marginal products and the prices of inputs. 

Let me think. I recall that in the theory of production, when you want to minimize costs, the firm should allocate resources such that the last unit of labor is worth as much as the last unit of capital. That makes sense because each additional unit of labor should contribute the same value as each additional unit of capital to prevent the firm from getting more value for the same cost.

So, how do I translate that into a condition? Oh right, the marginal product per dollar spent should be the same for both labor and capital. Or, another way to look at it is the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the price of labor equals the ratio of the marginal product of capital to the price of capital. Because the marginal product (MP) tells you how much output one more unit of labor or capital produces. 

Wait, let me make sure. If the MP of labor divided by the price of labor equals the MP of capital divided by the price of capital, that means the last dollar spent on labor gives the same "bang for the buck" as the last dollar spent on capital. So, it's about equalizing the value of the last unit.

Looking at the options, let me see what each represents. Option C says the ratio of MP labor to price labor equals one, but that's not quite right. Because that would imply that MP_labor equals price_labor. That would only be true if the marginal product equals the price, which might not necessarily be the case. 

Option E is price of labor equals price of capital. That would mean the firm is indifferent between the two, but I think that's a different scenario. For example, if the two have different prices, the firm would not want to choose one over the other. But in the cost minimization scenario, the prices can differ.

Option I says marginal product of labor greater than MP capital, but that doesn't sound right. Because if MP_labor is higher than MP_capital, that suggests that adding an extra unit of labor would yield more output than an extra unit of capital, which isn't the case for cost minimization.

Option E seems to require the prices to be equal, which is a different question. The question isn't about equal prices; it's about the allocation where the last dollar spent on each is the same.

Looking back at the options, option F says "price of labor less than price of capital." That doesn't make sense because if labor is cheaper, the firm would want to spend more on it. But I think I'm mixing up the logic here.

Option J is about marginal products being equal. That's another condition, perhaps for perfect substitutes, but for production functions where labor and capital are used in a fixed ratio, that's the case. But for general production functions, the condition is about the ratios of MP to price.

Option G is the ratio of MP_labor to MP_capital equals one. That doesn't sound right either. It should be the ratio of MP_labor over price_labor equals the same for MP_capital over price_capital.

So the correct condition is option E doesn't seem right. Wait, no, I was wrong earlier. The correct condition is that the ratio of the marginal product of labor to price of labor equals the ratio of marginal product of capital to price of capital. Because that's the condition for cost minimization.

Wait, let me get this straight. The general rule is that for cost minimization, the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor should equal the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital. So the ratio of MP_labor to price_labor is equal to the ratio of MP_capital to price_capital.

Looking at the options, that's option G or H or another letter? Let me check. Option G says the ratio of MP labor to MP capital is equal to one. That's not correct unless MP_labor equals MP_capital, which is a different scenario.

Option H says marginal product of labor equals price of labor. That's another condition I've heard before, but that's more for the case where you have only one input. For two inputs, that's not the cost minimization condition.

So the condition I'm remembering is option E is wrong, option F is about prices, which is not the condition. So the correct answer must be option E or another. Wait, no, let me re-examine. I think I'm mixing up the options.

Wait, the question is about the condition when the firm hires the least cost. The correct condition is that the ratio of the marginal products (each divided by their respective prices) are equal. So that's option G? Or is it another letter?

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option G: ratio of MP_labor to MP_capital equals one. â†’ That would require MP_labor = MP_capital. That's for perfect substitutes, which isn't necessarily the case here.

Option H is "marginal product of labor equals price of labor." That's a different condition, possibly for when you're using one input.

The correct condition for cost minimization is that the ratio of MP_labor / price_labor equals MP_capital / price_capital. So which option is that? Looking again:

Option E is "price_labor equals price_capital." No, that doesn't apply.

Wait, the correct condition is when the two ratios are equal. So the correct condition is that MP_labor / price_labor = MP_capital / price_capital. Among the given options, that would be option E (which is price_labor equals price_capital?) No, that doesn't match. Alternatively, looking for the ratios.

Wait, let me think again. The condition is that (MP_labor / price_labor) = (MP_capital / price_capital). So which option states that?

Looking at the options:

Option C: ratio of MP_labor to price_labor equals 1. That would mean MP_labor = price_labor, which is a different condition.

Option E: price_labor equals price_capital. Not relevant here.

Option H is MP_labor equals price_labor. So that would only happen if MP_labor equals price, which doesn't align with cost minimization.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is E is not the condition. Then the correct condition is option G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Wait, let me read the options again carefully.

Wait, the question is about the combination where the ratios are equal. So the correct condition is option E doesn't fit, because it's price_labor equals price_capital, but the correct condition is that the ratios of MP to prices are equal.

Looking at the options again, none of them directly state that ratio. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the options. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: Total cost of labor equals total cost of capital. Not sure how that would apply here. If the total cost is equal, then the cost per unit would be the same. Not necessarily the condition for minimization.

Option B: Marginal product of labor equals marginal product of capital. That would mean the last unit of each input gives the same output, but that doesn't necessarily relate to cost.

Option C: MP_labor / price_labor equals 1. That would mean that MP_labor equals price_labor. So each additional unit of labor gives the same MP as its price. I'm not sure if that's the condition.

Option D: price_labor equals price_capital. That's about the prices, which I don't think is the condition for cost minimization.

Option E: price_labor equals price_capital. No, that's not right.

Option F: price_labor less than price_capital. That can't be right because the firm would prefer to buy more of the cheaper input.

Option G: MP_labor / MP_capital = 1. So MP_labor equals MP_capital. This is when the two inputs are perfect substitutes, but in reality, the condition for cost minimization is about the ratio of the MP to the price.

Option H: MP_labor = price_labor. So MP_labor equals the price of labor. That would mean that each additional unit of labor is just as valuable as labor itself, which is a different scenario.

Option I: MP_labor divided by price_labor equals MP_capital divided by price_capital. This is the correct condition. Because if MP_labor / price_labor = MP_capital / price_capital, then each unit you add of labor gives the same "bang for the buck" as each unit of capital. So the firm is indifferent between the two, and will allocate resources accordingly.

So the correct answer should be option E? No, wait. No, I think I made a mistake here. Option E is about prices, which isn't the condition for cost minimization. Option I is the right condition.

Wait, but looking back, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The correct condition for cost minimization is (MP_labor / price_labor) = (MP_capital / price_capital). So among the options, that's not directly presented.

Wait, looking again:

Option E is "price_labor equals price_capital." No, that doesn't apply.

Option G says the ratio of MP_labor to MP_capital is 1. That would require MP_labor = MP_capital, which is a different scenario. It doesn't relate to cost minimization.

Option I says that MP_labor divided by price_labor equals MP_capital divided by price_capital. That's exactly the condition I was thinking of. So option I is correct.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Is there another option that matches this?

Looking at the options:

Option E: price_labor equals price_capital â†’ No, that's about prices, not about the ratios.

Option I is exactly the condition we're looking for.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option H is MP_labor equals price_labor. So which is correct.

Hmm. Oh wait, the problem is that I'm mixing up the options. Let me re-read the options.

Option E is "price of labor equals price of capital." No, that's not the condition for cost minimization. It's about prices, not about the MP ratios.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think about the general theory.

In cost minimization, the firm will choose inputs such that the last dollar spent on labor equals the last dollar spent on capital. So, the marginal product per dollar spent for both must be equal.

Mathematically, this is (MP_labor / price_labor) = (MP_capital / price_capital).

So the condition is that the ratio of marginal product to price is equal for both inputs.

Looking at the options, that's option I. So the correct answer must be option E? No. Because option E says price_labor equals price_capital, which isn't the condition.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the correct one is option E is incorrect because it's about prices. The correct condition is that the ratios of MP to price are equal. So which option matches that?

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Wait, perhaps option E is not correct. I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula again. The condition is (MPL / w) = (MPK / r), where w is the wage rate (price of labor) and r is the rental rate (price of capital). So the ratio of marginal product of labor to its price equals that of capital to its price.

But looking at the given options, which one says that?

Let me check the options again:

Option E: price_labor equals price_capital â†’ No.

Option I: MP_labor / price_labor = MP_capital / price_capital â†’ Yes.

So the correct answer is option I. But wait, the options don't have any letter with I? Let me check.

Wait, looking at the given options, I see that option I is letter I. But the options are labeled A to J, and I is one of them.

So the correct choice is option I.

Wait, but I think I'm missing something. Oh wait, the options are presented as:

Options:

A: â€¦
B: â€¦
C: â€¦
D: â€¦
E: â€¦
F: â€¦
G: â€¦
H: â€¦
I: â€¦
J: â€¦

So option I is there.

So the correct condition is that (MP_labor / price_labor) equals (MP_capital / price_capital), which is option I. So the answer must be option I.

But wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. If I think about the condition for cost minimization, I remember the formula is (MPL / w) = (MPK / r). So the ratio of marginal product of labor to its price equals the ratio of MPK to its price.

Looking at the options again, the correct condition is option I.
</think>

To determine the correct condition for hiring the least-cost combination of labor and capital, we need to recall the theory of cost minimization. The firm minimizes its costs when the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor equals the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital. This ensures that the last unit of labor and capital provide the same "bang for the buck," preventing any unnecessary expenditure.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the total cost of labor is equal to the total cost of capital."  
  This condition ensures that the total cost of both inputs is the same, but it does not necessarily minimize the cost of production. It is a different scenario and not the condition for cost minimization.

- **Option B:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital."  
  This condition would apply if the firm were using one input, not two. In the context of two inputs, this is not the relevant condition for cost minimization.

- **Option C:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the price of labor is equal to one."  
  This would imply that the marginal product of labor equals the price of labor, which is a different scenario and not the condition for cost minimization.

- **Option D:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the price of labor is equal to the price of capital."  
  This would occur if the firm is indifferent between the two inputs, but it does not ensure cost minimization. The prices themselves should be considered in the ratio to the marginal products.

- **Option E:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the price of labor equals the price of capital."  
  This is not the condition for cost minimization. The prices must be compared to the marginal products to ensure equal "bang for the buck."

- **Option F:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of capital is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of labor."  
  This is incorrect. The correct condition involves the ratio of marginal products to prices, not the reverse.

- **Option G:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the marginal product of capital is equal to one."  
  This would imply that the marginal products are equal, which is a different scenario and not the condition for cost minimization.

- **Option H:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the price of labor is less than the price of capital."  
  This is not the condition for cost minimization. The firm will prefer to purchase more of the cheaper input to minimize costs.

- **Option I:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor is greater than the marginal product of capital."  
  This is incorrect. The correct condition involves the ratio of marginal products to prices, not their absolute values.

- **Option J:** "Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital."  
  This is the correct condition for cost minimization. It ensures that the last unit of labor and capital provide the same marginal product per dollar spent.

### Conclusion:
The correct condition for hiring the least-cost combination of labor and capital is that the ratio of the marginal product of labor to the price of labor equals the ratio of the marginal product of capital to the price of capital. This corresponds to **Option I**.
