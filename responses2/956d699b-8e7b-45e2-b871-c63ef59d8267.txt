Okay, so I've got this question about half-wave dipole antennas. Hmm, I remember that dipole antennas are used for transmitting or receiving radio waves. A half-wave dipole is designed to resonate at a specific frequency. The question says the signal is 300 MHz, and we need to find the correct length based on the velocity factor.

Wait, what's the velocity factor again? Oh right, the velocity factor is the ratio of the speed of the signal in the medium (like air or metal) to the speed of light. So, if the velocity factor is less than 1, it's because the medium is slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. Wait, no, wait. Actually, wait: the speed of light in a medium is c/(velocity factor). So if velocity factor is 0.70, the speed is c/0.70. Which is about 1.428c. But wait, that can't be right because the speed of the signal in a conductor (like metal) is higher than in air but I think it's not higher than c. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, velocity factor is the ratio of the phase velocity in the medium to the speed of light in vacuum. So, if the velocity factor is 0.7, then the phase velocity is 0.7c. But wait, the phase velocity in a medium is usually the speed of the wave in that medium, which is c/n, where n is the refractive index. So if the velocity factor is 0.7, then the medium's phase velocity is 0.7c. But wait, that would mean the phase velocity is less than the speed of light, but in reality, phase velocity in a conductor is higher than the speed of light in vacuum. Because the phase velocity in a conductor is v = f * λ, and λ is lower than the free space wavelength. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The velocity factor (also known as phase velocity factor) is defined as v_p / c, where v_p is the phase velocity in the medium. So, for a medium like a metal, the phase velocity is higher than the speed of light in a vacuum. That can't happen because the phase velocity can't exceed the speed of light. So that suggests that the velocity factor for a conductor is 1, which makes sense because in a conductor, the phase velocity is c. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a different approach. Maybe I should remember the formula for the length of the dipole.

The half-wave dipole is designed to resonate at a frequency where the physical length of the dipole is half the wavelength in the medium. So the wavelength in the medium is λ = c / f * something? Wait, the speed of the wave in the medium is v = c / f. Because f is the frequency. So the wavelength in the medium is λ = v / f = (c/(f)) / f = c/(f²) ? Wait, no. Wait, the speed in medium is v = f * λ. So λ = v/f. So for a frequency f, the wavelength in the medium is λ = v/f.

But since v = c * (velocity factor), then λ = (c * v_f) / f. Wait, wait, v_f is the phase velocity. So for a wave in a medium, the phase velocity is v_p = f λ. So the wavelength in the medium is λ = v_p / f. But v_p is c * v_f, because velocity factor is v_p/c. So λ = (c * v_f)/f. So the half-wave dipole length would be λ/2 = (c * v_f)/(2f).

Wait, that's the formula for the length of the dipole. So length L = (c * v_f)/(2f). Wait, but since f is the frequency in Hz, and c is in m/s, and v_f is dimensionless, then L would be meters.

Wait, let me calculate: c is approximately 3e8 m/s. For 300 MHz, f = 3e8 Hz is 300 million cycles per second. So 3e8 m/s divided by 3e8 s^-1 gives 1 m. So L = (3e8 * v_f) / (2 * 3e8) )= v_f / 2. So L = v_f / 2 meters?

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

f = 300 MHz = 3e8 Hz.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v_f is the velocity factor.

So the wavelength in the medium is λ = c/(f) = 3e8 / 3e8 = 1 meter. No, wait because f is in Hz, so 3e8 Hz is 300 million cycles per second. So λ = (speed) / (frequency) = 3e8 m/s / 3e8 s^-1 = 1 m.

But wait, that can't be right because 300 MHz is 3e8 Hz. Hmm, 3e8 m/s divided by 3e8 Hz gives 1 m. So yes. So the wavelength in the medium is 1 meter. So the half-wave dipole is half of that, which is 0.5 meters.

Wait, but wait. Because the velocity factor affects the wavelength. So, if the velocity factor is 1, that means it's the same as air. So for air, the speed is c, so the wavelength is about 1 meter at 300 MHz. So the half-wave dipole is 0.5 meters.

But wait, the question gives options, and one of them is 0.5 meters and 0.5 meters (option G is 0.45 and 0.65, H is 0.2 and 0.3, etc.) So option G's first element is 0.5 meters, which matches the calculation. But wait, another point: the velocity factor is 0.7 or 1.0. So the question is, when velocity factor is 0.7, the dipole length is shorter or longer? Wait, in the earlier calculation, the length is L = (c * v_f)/(2f) → 3e8 * v_f/(2 * 3e8) )= v_f/(2).

So for v_f=1, L=0.5 m. If v_f is 0.7, then L= 0.7 /2=0.35 m. So the length of the dipole is 0.35 meters.

Wait, but the question is asking for the length of the antenna to optimally radiate. So the correct length would be based on the velocity factor. So for 0.7, the length would be 0.35 meters, and for 1.0, it's 0.5 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.7 meters, 1 → No, because the calculated would be 0.35 and 0.5, which is not any of these.

Option B: 0.6 and 0.9 → Not matching.

Option C: 0.5 and 1 → Hmm, 0.5 is correct for v_f=1, but 0.5 is for v_f=2 (because L= c/(2f). Wait, wait, no, that's incorrect. Because if v_f is 0.7, then L is 0.35 m. So option C's first element is 0.5, which is correct for v_f=1, but the second element is 1, which would be correct for v_f=2. So that can't be right. Because v_f can't be 2, it's at most 1.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the formula.

The formula for the half-wave dipole is L = (λ/2), where λ is the wavelength in the medium. So λ = v_p / f, where v_p is the phase velocity. So λ = (c * v_f )/ f. Because v_p = c * v_f (since velocity factor v_f = v_p / c, so v_p = c * v_f).

So λ = (c * v_f) / f.

Thus, L = λ/2 = (c * v_f) / (2 f).

But f is in Hz, so units are correct.

So for f=3e8 Hz, c=3e8 m/s.

So L = (3e8 m/s * v_f ) / (2 * 3e8 s^-1) ) → (v_f / 2) meters.

So, for v_f=1, L=0.5 m.

For v_f=0.7, L=0.35 m.

Now, looking at the options:

Option G: 0.45 and 0.65 → No, because the correct for v_f=1 is 0.5 m, but G's first element is 0.45.

Option D: 0.55 and 0.85 → No.

Option A: 0.7 and 1 → No.

Option H: 0.2 and 0.3 → No.

Option I: 0.4 and 0.6 → Hmm, 0.45 is close to 0.4, and 0.65 is close to 0.6. But wait, the correct for v_f=0.7 is 0.35 m, and v_f=1 is 0.5 m. So 0.35 and 0.5, but in the options, the closest are 0.4 and 0.6. But none of the options have 0.35 and 0.5. Because looking at the options, option I is 0.4 and 0.6, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity factor is defined as the ratio of the wave's speed in the medium to the speed in the vacuum. So, for a conductor, the phase velocity is c, so v_f=1. But for air, v_p is lower than c. Wait, no, the phase velocity in the medium is c/n, where n is the refractive index. So for a conductor, n is low, phase velocity is higher than c in vacuum. But wait, that contradicts because phase velocity can't be higher than c. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Phase velocity = speed of the wave in the medium, which is v_p = f λ. In vacuum, the speed is c. So for a conductor, the phase velocity is higher than c. Wait, but that's impossible because the phase velocity is higher than the speed of light in vacuum. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the velocity factor is actually the ratio of the wavelength in the medium to the wavelength in vacuum.

Wait, let's think again. Another approach: the formula for the dipole length is ( λ_m / 2 ), where λ_m is the wavelength in the medium. So, λ_m = c / f, but this is only correct for non-dispersive media. Wait, no, for a medium with a refractive index n, the phase velocity v_p is c/n. So the wavelength in the medium is λ = v_p / f = (c/n) / f = (c/f) /n → which is λ = (c/f) /n → c/f is the wavelength in vacuum, so λ_m = λ_vacuum /n.

Wait, wait: λ = v_p / f. So for a medium with refractive index n, v_p = c/n. So λ_m = (c/n)/f = (c/f) * 1/n → λ_m = λ_vacuum /n. So the wavelength in the medium is λ_m = λ_vacuum / n.

So, the half-wave dipole length is λ_m /2 = (λ_vacuum )/(2n).

But the wavelength in vacuum is c/f. So L = (c/f) / (2n) = c/(2 n f) → L = c/(2 f n).

Alternatively, L = (c/(f)) )/(2n) = (λ_vacuum) / (2n).

Wait, but n is the refractive index. For example, n=1 is air, n=1.5 is glass. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact definition of velocity factor here. Perhaps the velocity factor is defined as the ratio of the phase velocity in the medium to the speed of light in vacuum. So, v_f = v_p / c.

So, v_p = v_f * c.

The wavelength in the medium is λ_m = v_p / f = (v_f c) / f.

So, the half-wave dipole length is λ_m /2 = (v_f c) / (2 f) = (v_f/(2)) * (c/f) → which is v_f/(2) times the wavelength in vacuum.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because for v_f=1, λ_m = c/(2f) which is half the wavelength in vacuum. But the half-wave dipole is half of the wavelength in medium. Wait, so for a medium with λ_m = c/(f), the half-wave dipole is λ_m /2 = c/(2f), which is half the wavelength in the medium. So for a medium with a lower refractive index, the wavelength is shorter, so the dipole length is half of that. So if v_f is the phase velocity factor, then the dipole length is (v_p/(2f)) = (c * v_f/(2f )) = c/(2f) * v_f = (c/f)/2 * v_f = (λ_vacuum) * v_f / 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

The problem states the velocity factor is either 0.70 or 1.0. So, for each case, calculate the correct length.

Case 1: v_f=1.0.

Then L = (c/(2 f)) * v_f → (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 3e8 s^-1) ) *1 = (3e8 /6e8) *1 → 0.5 m. So 0.5 meters.

Case 2: v_f=0.70.

L = (3e8 * 0.70) / (2 * 3e8) ) → (2.1e8) / 6e8 = 0.35 meters.

So the correct lengths are 0.35 and 0.5 meters, respectively.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 0.45 and 0.65 → No, as these don't match 0.35 and 0.5.

Option I: 0.4 and 0.6 → Hmm, 0.4 is close to 0.45, and 0.6 is close to 0.65. But the correct answers are 0.35 and 0.5. So perhaps the options have the closest values. But none of the options have 0.35 and 0.5. Wait, looking back at the options:

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. The options are:

Option A: 0.7,1

B: 0.6, 0.9 → No

C: 0.5, 1 → No, because 1 is not the correct for v_f=0.7.

D: 0.55, 0.85 → No

E: 0.25, 0.75 → No

F: 0.35, 0.5 → No, because the correct for v_f=0.7 is 0.35, but the options don't have this.

Wait, the correct answers would be 0.35 and 0.5. But none of the options have these. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says "the velocity factor for the antenna element is (A) 0.70 (B) 1.0".

Ah, wait a second. Maybe the velocity factor is the reciprocal. Like, for a conductor, the velocity factor is the reciprocal of the refractive index. Let me think again: what's the actual formula for the velocity factor in an antenna.

Ah, perhaps the velocity factor is the ratio of the phase velocity of the wave in the medium to the speed of light in vacuum. So v_p = c / n → v_f = v_p / c = (c/n)/c = 1/n. So the velocity factor is 1 over the refractive index. So for a conductor like a metal, n is low, so v_f is higher than 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because for a conductor, the phase velocity is higher than the speed of light in vacuum. If n is the refractive index (which is greater than 1 for most metals), then v_p = c/n. So phase velocity is lower than c, but in a conductor, it actually can be higher. Hmm, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity factor is the ratio of the frequency in the medium to the frequency in vacuum, but that doesn't make sense because the frequency in the medium is same as in vacuum (f).

Wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the speed of the wave in the medium to the speed of light in a vacuum. So, v_p = c * v_f.

So, for a conductor, v_p = c * v_f. But if v_f is greater than 1, that would make v_p >c, which isn't possible. Hence, this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct formula elsewhere. Maybe another approach is better.

The length of the half-wave dipole is given by L = (c/(2f)) * (1/v_f). Because phase velocity v_p = c / (n), where n is the refractive index. So, v_p = c/(n) → n = c / v_p.

So, the wavelength in the medium is λ = v_p / f.

The half-wave length is λ/2 = v_p/(2f).

But since v_p = c /n, λ = c/(n f).

So, half-wavelength is λ/2 = c/(2 n f).

But the velocity factor is v_p / c = 1/n. So, v_f = 1/n → n = 1/v_f.

Substituting into the half-wavelength formula:

λ_half = (c) / (2 * (1/v_f) * f) ) → c * v_f / (2 f).

So, the length is L = c v_f/(2 f).

So, for f=3e8 Hz, c=3e8 m/s.

Thus, L = (3e8 * v_f) / (2*3e8) ) → (v_f) /2 meters. So yes.

So, for v_f=1, L=0.5 m.

For v_f=0.70, L=0.35 m.

Looking at the options again, I see Option F: 0.35 and 0.5 → Wait, no, Option F is 0.35 and 0.5? Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0.7, 1 → No

B) 0.6, 0.9 → No

C) 0.5,1 → No, because 1 is for v_f=2.

D) 0.55, 0.85 → No.

E) 0.25, 0.75 → No.

F) 0.35, 0.5 → No, because the correct is 0.35 and 0.5, but in the options, F is 0.35 and 0.5? Wait, no, the options are:

A) 0.7, 1 → No

B) 0.6, 0.9 → No

C) 0.5, 1 → No

D) 0.55, 0.85 → No

C) 0.5, 1 → No

D) 0.55, 0.85 → No

E) 0.25, 0.75 → No

F) 0.35, 0.5 → Yes, because 0.35 and 0.5 are the correct lengths for v_f=0.7 and 1.

Wait, but in the question, the options are:

Ah, looking again, the question's options are:

A) 0.7, 1 → No

B) 0.6, 0.9 → No

C) 0.5, 1 → No, because v_f=1 is 0.5, v_f=0.7 is 0.35.

D) 0.55, 0.85 → No.

E) 0.25, 0.75 → No.

F) 0.35, 0.5 → Yes, because 0.35 and 0.5 are the correct for v_f=0.7 and 1.

Wait, but the question lists the options as:

The available options are:

A) 0.7,1 → No

B) 0.6, 0.9 → No

C) 0.5,1 → No

D) 0.55, 0.85 → No

E) 0.25, 0.75 → No

F) 0.35, 0.5 → Yes, because it's the correct for v_f=0.7 and 1.

Wait, but the correct answer is option F, but the question says "the velocity factor". So, for the velocity factor of 0.7, the dipole length is 0.35 m, and for 1.0, it's 0.5 m. So, the correct answer is option F: 0.35 and 0.5.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

No, the options are:

Looking again, the available options are:

A: 0.7, 1 → No

B: 0.6, 0.9 → No

C: 0.5, 1 → No

D: 0.55, 0.85 → No

E: 0.25, 0.75 → No

F: 0.35, 0.5 → Yes, because it's the correct for v_f=0.7 and 1.

Wait, but the question is asking for the half-wave dipole's length based on the velocity factor. So, if the velocity factor is 0.7, the dipole is 0.35 m; if it's 1.0, the dipole is 0.5 m. So, the correct option is F: 0.35, 0.5.

But let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are:

A) 0.7,1 → No

B) 0.6, 0.9 → No

C) 0.5, 1 → No

D) 0.55, 0.85 → No

E) 0.25, 0.75 → No

F) 0.35, 0.5 → Yes, correct.

So the answer is option F: 0.35 and 0.5.

Wait, but the question's options are A to E, and F is an option. So the answer is option F.

Wait, but the original question says the velocity factor is (A) 0.70 (B)1.0, etc. So the correct answer is F: 0.35 and 0.5.

Wait, but in the options, option F is 0.35 and 0.5 → Yes, correct.

So the correct answer is option F: 0.35 and 0.5 → Yes.

Wait, but looking back, the initial options are:

A) 0.7,1 → No

B) 0.6, 0.9 → No

C) 0.5, 1 → No

D) 0.55, 0.85 → No

E) 0.25, 0.75 → No

F) 0.35, 0.5 → Yes, correct.

So the correct option is F: 0.35 and 0.5.

Wait, but looking back, the question asks "the length of the half-wave dipole antenna to optimally radiate". So, for a velocity factor of 1, it's 0.5 m, and for 0.7, 0.35 m. So, the correct answer is the option that has 0.35 and 0.5, which is option F.

So the answer is option F.

But wait, looking back, the options are all in the same format, with F being 0.35 and 0.5.

So, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The question asks for the optimal length of a half-wave dipole antenna based on the given velocity factor. The velocity factor is defined as the ratio of the phase velocity in the medium to the speed of light in a vacuum. For a conductor, the phase velocity is higher than the speed of light in a vacuum, making the velocity factor greater than 1. The formula for the half-wave dipole length is:

\[
L = \frac{v_f}{2} \, \text{m}
\]

### Calculations:
1. **For \( v_f = 1.0 \):**
   \[
   L = \frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5 \, \text{m}
   \]

2. **For \( v_f = 0.70 \):**
   \[
   L = \frac{0.70}{2} = 0.35 \, \text{m}
   \]

### Matching with Options:

ANSWER: F
