Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I need to figure out which issue is important in the song provided. Let me read the question again. The song is "Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!" and the question is about the underlying issue. The options are political corruption, civil disobedience, rules of succession, gender inequality, social class conflicts, Diplomatic relations, environmental concerns, religious conflict, economic instability, military stalemate, or J: Military stalemate.

Wait, the options include J as military stalemate. I'm a bit fuzzy on the song, so I should think about what it's about. The song is from the 17th century, so it's likely a song from the Middle Ages. Let me recall. I think it's a patriotic song, maybe about the winter king as a symbol of old power. The lines mention the ruler snatching the crown, which is a strong symbol of power and authority. It's about retribution and showing mercy, perhaps.

So, what does this song usually address? It's often about self-punishment and revenge, which ties into political corruption because the king is shown to be greedy. He's rich and powerful, so he's doing something wrong. So political corruption is a theme. 

Looking at the options, A: Political corruption. Is that one of them? Yes. So I think the underlying issue is political corruption. 

Wait, other options: B is civil disobedience. But the song is more about revenge and self-protection, not directly about obeying laws. C is the rules of succession, but again, the song is about power, not succession. D: gender inequality. Not sure, but the song doesn't seem to mention gender. E: social class conflicts. The song is about the rich king, so perhaps he's a social class, but I'm not sure if that's the underlying issue. F: Diplomatic relations. Maybe not. G: Environmental concerns. No. H: Religious conflict. No. I: Economic instability. The song doesn't talk about economic issues. J: military stalemate. Not sure.

So, the main issue is political corruption, so the answer should be A. I think I'm confident now.
