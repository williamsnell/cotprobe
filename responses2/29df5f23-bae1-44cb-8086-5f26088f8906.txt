Okay, so I need to figure out what the correct answer is for this multiple-choice question. The question is about what color an airplane's black box is usually. The options are A to J, ranging from green to blue.

Hmm, the black box on an airplane... I'm trying to remember. I think it's called the black box, right? I believe it's part of the control panel. Let me think about what that part looks like. 

Wait, I recall that the black box is usually the part that's in the back of the plane, behind the wings. It has a lot of buttons and switches. I think the color is black, but sometimes it's blackened a bit. Oh wait, but the question is about the color, not the shade. So I guess it's black.

Looking at the options, option G is black. So I think the answer is G.

The correct answer is G: black.
