Alright, so I've got this question about property law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a resident who owns a large tract of virgin forest and conveys it to the people of the state. The conveyance is to the people "so long as" the tract remains in its natural state, with exceptions for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. So, the exception part is important. It says the right of the logging company to cut and sell the timber is an example of what.

Wait, the question is about the type of conveyance, I think. The options are various types of property rights. The key here is understanding the law regarding real property conveyances, especially conveyances to people.

In state law, when a person conveys land to the people, it's called a fee simple, which usually goes to the owner. But the problem says the right is vested in the state as a legal entity. Wait, the original conveyance was to the people, but the title goes to the state. Oh, right, because when it says "to the people of the state in fee simple", that's a bit confusing. Normally, conveyances to the people go to the owner, not the state. So maybe the state is acting as the owner here for the purposes of the fee simple.

Wait, but the question says that the right is vested in the state as a legal entity. So, the deed is being transferred to the state, which is a legal entity. So, from the perspective of the state, the land is theirs, and the rights are their. Therefore, the right to cut and sell the timber would be a fee simple in this context. But wait, I'm not sure because the option includes "Easement in gross" as an option. Let's think again.

Wait, the way the question is worded: the resident conveyed the tract to the people "in fee simple". But the title goes to the state now, because the deed is to "the people of the state as a legal entity." So, under state law, if the deed is to the people of the state, it's a fee simple in fee, but the state is acting as a legal entity here. So the state's fee simple would presumably pass to the owner of the deed, which is the state itself.

But wait, that's probably getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the conveyance is to the people, but the state is the legal owner. So the right of the logging company would be a fee simple in this state's legal ownership.

But wait, another point: the option "Easement in gross" is one of the choices. An easement in gross is a fee simple easement, meaning it's a right of way (like a road) that runs in front of land. It's a fee simple in nature.

But in this case, the logging company is cutting and selling the timber. Is that an easement appurtenant, which would be attached to the land. Or is it a public easement in gross? Let's think about the definitions.

Easement in gross (A) is a fee simple easement that runs in front of land, granting the owner the right to use the land as if it were zoned. So, if the logging company uses the land as if it's zoned, that would be an easement in gross.

Easement appurtenant (C) is similar, but it's attached to a specific piece of land. So, if the easement is on a tract, it's appurtenant. But if the easement is in front of the tract, it's in gross.

The problem states that the right "would be an example of..." So the right is a fee simple. But wait, the conveyance was to the people, but the state's fee simple would pass to the state owner. Wait, but the question is about the right of the logging company to cut and sell the timber. So, the right would be a fee simple in the state's ownership.

Wait, but in the original conveyance, the right was with the people, so the state is acting as the owner. So, the right is a fee simple in state legal ownership. So, in that case, the right would be a fee simple. But looking at the options, option B is "Fee simple." So is that the answer?

Wait, but the question is about the right that the logging company holds. So, the right is a fee simple, which would be granted on the basis that the land is in its natural state, with exceptions for recreational, etc. So, the court would decide what rights are available.

Wait, but the question is about the type of right the logging company holds. So, if it's a fee simple, the answer would be B. Alternatively, maybe it's a public easement in gross (A) because it's a right of way.

Wait, the exception is "with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes." So if the logging is for such purposes, then the right is not available. But in this case, the logging was granted, so the right is available.

But in any case, the question is about the type of right the logging company holds based on the conveyance. The conveyance was to the people, but the title now goes to the state as a legal entity. So the state's title would pass to the owner, the state owner.

Wait, but the question is about the right of the logging company. So, is this a fee simple? Or is it an easement?

Alternatively, perhaps the conveyance was to the people, and the state is the owner. So the right is a fee simple in the state's ownership. But the options don't include "state as a legal entity," so perhaps the question is about it being a fee simple in the state's title.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline:

1. The original conveyance was to the people "in fee simple so long as..." So, the right was fee simple to the people. But the state is now acting as the owner of that fee simple. So, the state has the fee simple in their ownership.

But the question is about the right the logging company has. So, what rights does the logging company have under the state's title.

Wait, if the state owns the tract, then it's a fee simple. So the right is a fee simple. So the logging company, as a party to the conveyance, would have a fee simple right, and the exception applies if it's for recreational purposes, but here it was granted, so the exception doesn't stop it.

Wait, but wait. If the land was in its natural state, the exception was for recreational purposes. So if the logging was done for recreational, it's allowed. But the question says the exception is "with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes." So, cutting and selling for any of those is allowed. So, the right is in fee simple, except for those exceptions.

But the question is about the right the logging company has. So, the right is a fee simple, but only subject to exceptions.

So, what type of right is it? If it's a public easement in gross, then it's a fee simple easement.

But wait, the conveyance was to the people, but the state owns it. So, the state's fee simple is now theirs, and the right is a fee simple easement.

Alternatively, perhaps the conveyance to the people (fee simple) goes to the state, so the state's title is fee simple. So, the right is a fee simple.

Hmm. But the options don't have "state as a legal entity" as a choice. So perhaps the question is more about whether it's an easement in gross or something else.

Wait, the problem states that the right is vested in the state as a legal entity. So, the state is the owner, and the right is a fee simple in their ownership.

Wait, but the options don't include "state as a legal entity." So the type of right is a fee simple. So option B.

But wait, another angle: the original conveyance was to the people, so the right was fee simple to the people. But the state is the owner of the fee simple now. So, the right is a fee simple in the state's title.

Alternatively, perhaps the right is a public easement in gross, which is a fee simple easement. So, it would be option A.

Wait, but in that case, the conveyance was to the people, but the state owns it. So, the state is the owner. So, the right is a fee simple easement in the state's title.

Wait, but in the options, option A is easement in gross, which would be a fee simple easement. So, the logging company's right is an easement in gross, which would be a fee simple.

Hmm. So, the right is a fee simple, which is option B. But wait, I'm getting confused between whether it's a fee simple or an easement.

Wait, in state law, if the deed is transferred to the people as fee simple, then the state is the owner of that fee simple. So, the right is a fee simple. Therefore, the right is a fee simple. So, the answer is B: Fee simple.

But wait, the options also include easements. So, perhaps the right is a public easement in gross, which is an easement in gross (A). Or perhaps it's a fee simple in gross, which is the same as easement in gross.

Wait, maybe I should think about the type of right. An easement in gross is a fee simple easement, which is a right that runs in front of land. So, the right would be an easement in gross.

Alternatively, perhaps the right is a public easement in gross, which would be the same as easement in gross.

Wait, but the problem says the right would be an example of a...

Looking again:

The exception is for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. So, the right is with the exception, which would be a public easement in gross, because it's a right that can be used without exception for those purposes.

In this case, the logging was granted, so the exception doesn't apply. But the right is a fee simple easement, so it's a public easement in gross.

So, the right is an easement in gross, which is option A.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me try to think again.

When a deed is transferred to the people, it's a fee simple to them. But in this case, the deed is to the people, but the state's title now owns the property. So, the right is a fee simple in the state's title.

But the options don't include "state as a legal entity," so perhaps the question is about the right as a fee simple, regardless of the state's ownership.

Alternatively, perhaps the right is a public easement in gross, because it's a right that can be used without exception for certain purposes.

Wait, the question says the exception is for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. So, the right is available for those, but the logging was granted, so it's not subject to exceptions. But the type of right is what's being asked.

So, if the right is a public easement in gross, it's an easement in gross (option A).

Alternatively, perhaps it's a fee simple in gross, which is option A.

Wait, but the initial conveyance was to the people, which is a fee simple to the people. But the state now owns it, so the right is a fee simple in the state's title.

But the question is about the example of the right, not the title. So, the right itself is a fee simple, which is option B.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think of it another way. The original conveyance was to the people, which is a fee simple to them. But the state owns it. So, when the state conveys it, it's a fee simple in their title. So, the right is a fee simple in the state's title, which is a public easement in gross. So, the right is an easement in gross, which is option A.

But the question is about the type of right the logging company has. So, if the right is a public easement in gross, then option A is correct. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the right is a fee simple in fee, which would be option B.

Wait, the initial conveyance was to the people as fee simple, but the state now owns it, so it's a fee simple in their title. So, the right is a fee simple, which is option B.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. I think I need to approach this differently.

In state law, when a deed is transferred to the people, it's a fee simple to them. But if the deed is transferred to a third party who is a legal owner, then it's a fee simple in that third party's title. So, in this case, the state owns the tract, so the conveyance is from the state to the logging company. But the state is acting as a legal owner, so the right is a fee simple in their title.

So, the right is a fee simple, which is option B.

Wait, but the options are:

A: easement in gross.

B: Fee simple.

So, the answer is B.

But wait, another thought: if the exception applies, but the logging was granted, the exception doesn't stop the right. But the type of right is still a fee simple, whether or not exceptions are in place.

So, the right is a fee simple, which is option B.

The question revolves around understanding the type of conveyance involving the logging company to the state, where the right to cut and sell timber is an example of a specific legal right. The key points are as follows:

1. **Initial Conveyance**: The resident conveyed the tract to the people "in fee simple so long as said tract shall remain in its natural state (with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes)." This indicates that the right to cut and sell timber was initially a fee simple to the people.

2. **State Title as Legal Entity**: The state then became the owner of the tract, acting as a legal entity. This means the state now owns the property, and the conveyance is now a fee simple in the state's title.

3. **Type of Right**: The question asks what type of right the logging company would hold. A fee simple is a type of fee simple easement, which is a right granted by a legal owner to others. Since the state is now the legal owner, the right to cut and sell timber is a fee simple in the state's title.

4. **Analysis of Options**: 
   - **A: easement in gross**: This refers to a fee simple easement, which is a right that runs in front of land. However, the right here is not an easement but a right to use the land, which is a fee simple.
   - **B: Fee simple**: This is the correct answer because the right to cut and sell timber is a fee simple in the state's title.
   - Other options (C to J) are not relevant to the type of right described.

Thus, the logging company's right to cut and sell timber is an example of a fee simple.
