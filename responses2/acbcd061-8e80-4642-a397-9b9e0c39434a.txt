Okay, so I've got this economics question here about how the equilibrium price of corn changes. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium price is where supply equals demand, right? So any change in supply or demand will shift the supply or demand curves, which can affect the equilibrium point.

The question is asking which option definitely increases the equilibrium price. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Supply increases, demand remains constant. If supply goes up, the supply curve shifts to the right. If demand is unchanged, the new equilibrium will have a higher price because the supply is now more than before. So this should increase the price. But wait, the question is about which definitely increases. I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: Supply shifts left, demand shifts right. Both happen. Let me think: supply left means lower quantity, demand right means higher quantity. If supply decreases and demand increases, the equilibrium price could go either way. Wait, no—what determines the new equilibrium? Let's see. If supply drops, the curve shifts left, so the equilibrium point is at a higher price if demand increases. But wait, if supply drops and demand increases, the equilibrium price might go up or down depending on how much each shifts. For example, if demand increases by a larger amount than supply decreases, the price would rise. But if the decrease in supply is more than the increase in demand, the price would fall. So this doesn't definitely increase the price; it depends on the magnitude of shifts. So option B doesn't definitely increase the price—so maybe it's not the correct answer.

Option C: Both supply and demand remain constant. Constant supply and demand means the curves don't shift. Equilibrium price remains the same. So this definitely doesn't increase it. So C is not the answer.

Option D: Demand shifts left, supply remains constant. If demand drops and supply stays the same, the new equilibrium price will definitely go down. So D definitely lowers price, not increase.

Option E: Supply shifts right, demand shifts left. Let's see. Suppose supply increases (right shift), demand decreases (left shift). The equilibrium quantity could increase or decrease, depending on the sizes. For example, if supply increases a lot and demand decreases a little, the new equilibrium price might be higher. But if supply increases a bit and demand decreases a lot, the price could be lower. So this doesn't definitely increase the price; it depends on the shifts. So E might not increase the price.

Option F: Both supply and demand shift right. Both increase. So supply goes up, demand up. The equilibrium quantity increases, but what about price? If supply increases more than demand, the price could go up. If demand increases more, price could go down. So we can't be sure. So F doesn't definitely increase the price.

Option G: Both supply and demand shift left. That would lower both supply and demand, so the equilibrium price definitely goes down. So G definitely lowers price, not increases.

Option H: Supply increases, demand decreases. So same as option E but in reverse. If supply increases (shift right) and demand decreases (shift left), the equilibrium quantity could go up or down. For instance, if supply increases a lot and demand decreases a little, price goes up. If supply increases a little and demand decreases a lot, price comes down. So H doesn't definitely increase the price.

Wait, but the question is which definitely increases the equilibrium price. So looking back at the options, which ones would definitely cause that?

Option A: supply increases, demand remains same. So supply shifts right, demand same. Equilibrium price would go up because quantity supplied is higher. So yes, A definitely increases price.

Wait, what about other options? Let me recheck.

Wait, option E: supply shifts right, demand shifts left. If supply shifts right and demand shifts left, it depends on which shifts are more significant.

But is there any way that this definitely increases price regardless of shifts? Or is it possible that it doesn't?

Wait, for the equilibrium price to definitely increase, the effect of the shifts on price must be positive.

Let me think about each scenario.

For option A: supply increases, demand same. So supply shifts right, demand same. The supply curve moves right, so the equilibrium point moves up. So price definitely increases.

Other options:

Option B: supply left, demand right. The net effect is ambiguous. If the supply decrease is less than the demand increase, the price goes up. If supply decrease is more, price goes down. So doesn't definitely increase.

Option E: supply right, demand left. The equilibrium quantity could go up or down. But price depends on the relative shifts. So we can't be sure the price goes up. So E doesn't definitely increase.

So the only option that definitely increases the equilibrium price is option A.

The equilibrium price of corn is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. To determine which option definitely increases the equilibrium price, we analyze each choice:

- **Option A**: If supply increases while demand remains constant, the supply curve shifts to the right. This results in a new equilibrium with a higher price. Therefore, this definitely increases the equilibrium price.

- **Option B**: If supply shifts left and demand shifts right, the equilibrium price could go either way, depending on the relative shifts. This does not definitely increase the price.

- **Option C**: If both supply and demand remain constant, the equilibrium price remains unchanged. This does not increase the price.

- **Option D**: If demand shifts left while supply remains constant, the demand curve shifts to the left, leading to a lower equilibrium price. This does not increase the price.

- **Option E**: If supply shifts right and demand shifts left, the equilibrium quantity could increase or decrease, depending on the relative shifts. The equilibrium price does not necessarily increase.

- **Option F**: If both supply and demand shift right, the equilibrium price decreases. This does not increase the price.

- **Option G**: If both supply and demand shift left, the equilibrium price decreases. This does not increase the price.

- **Option H**: If supply increases and demand decreases, the equilibrium price could increase or decrease, depending on the relative shifts. This does not necessarily increase the price.

Thus, the only option that definitely increases the equilibrium price is **Option A**.
