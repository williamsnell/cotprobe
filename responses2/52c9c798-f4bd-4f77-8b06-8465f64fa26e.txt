Question:

A father died leaving a will by which he devised a 100-acre tract to his daughter. At the time of the father's death, he believed that he owned all of the 100-acre tract. However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. As part of their agreement, the farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. After the foreclosure sale was finalized, the buyer brought suit claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract, formerly owned by the farmer. In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will

Options:

A: lose, because the buyer did not have a legal claim to the five-acre tract
B: lose, because the foreclosure proceedings were properly executed
C: win, because the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title was not legally binding
D: win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.
E: win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.
F: lose, because the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt
G: win, because the daughter purchased the tract at her own foreclosure sale
H: lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.
I: win, because the mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: A father left a will where he devised a 100-acre tract to his daughter. But he actually owned 95 acres. The other five were his own. Then, the daughter gave a warranty deed to a buyer, claiming to own all 100 acres. The buyer paid $25k down and a mortgage for $75k, which the seller had to pay. 

Now, the farmer comes in and says he's the true owner of five acres. He threatens to sue the buyer to quiet title. The daughter agrees to a deal: she pays $5k for her five acres. They get a quitclaim deed, meaning they own all her five acres. The buyer defaults on the mortgage, so the daughter buys at foreclosure. The buyer's deed says it's 100 acres, so he's suing for title in fee simple for those five acres. The question is whether the buyer can recover from the farmer.

Looking at the options, I need to determine which option is correct. Let's go through the key points.

1. The original deed was a warranty deed, so the buyer is conveying all 100 acres. But the buyer only paid $25k down, with the rest secured by a mortgage. 

2. The farmer's claim is about being the true owner of five acres. If the farmer really owned them, he should be the owner. But the deed from the daughter to the buyer was a warranty deed, which doesn't transfer ownership unless the deed is a quitclaim or similar.

3. The daughter agreed to buy the five acres with a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed (as opposed to a warranty deed) conveys ownership to the grantor, meaning the farmer now owns her five acres. So, the farmer's interest is now in the five acres.

4. The buyer, after the sale, defaulted on the mortgage. The buyer's deed describes the tract as 100 acres, so the buyer didn't have a right to the five acres. But how does the farmer's claim affect this?

5. The key issue is whether the farmer's claim to the five acres is enforceable. The buyer can sue for title, but only if the farmer has a valid claim. If the farmer is the true owner, he should have a claim. However, the original deed was a warranty deed, which doesn't transfer ownership until the buyer has paid the down payment and if they're satisfied.

Wait, the warranty deed conveys the interest to the buyer as to the full value. So, the buyer's interest covers all 100 acres. If the buyer didn't pay the full down payment, their interest is not valid. So, the buyer's interest is only valid if they paid the full $25k down (and the mortgage is secured). 

In this case, the buyer defaulted, so the buyer's interest is invalid. But the farmer later gave a quitclaim deed to the buyer for the five acres. If the buyer later gets a valid interest, then the farmer can sue. But the buyer's initial interest was invalid because they didn't pay the down payment. So, the farmer's claim doesn't stand unless he can show the buyer's initial interest was valid, which it wasn't.

But wait, the buyer didn't even acquire the five acres because they didn't pay the down. So, they don't have a right to the five acres. So, the farmer's claim to the five acres is based on a false assumption. 

Another angle: The buyer's initial deed was a warranty deed, so the buyer didn't have a valid interest until after the down payment and satisfaction of the mortgage. Since the buyer defaulted, the initial deed was invalid. So, the farmer's claim to the five acres is without a valid foundation because the buyer's interest was invalid. 

Additionally, the buyer can only recover from the grantor if the grantor has a valid claim. Here, the farmer is the grantor of the five acres. But because the buyer's initial interest was invalid, the farmer can't take title. So, the buyer can't sue the farmer for the five acres because the farmer doesn't have a legal claim. 

Alternatively, the buyer's own deed is 100 acres, which is valid, so he can sue on that. But the question is whether the farmer has a legal claim. 

Wait, the buyer's initial deed is a warranty deed, which only gives the buyer the right to the 100 acres once the buyer has paid the down and is satisfied. So, the buyer didn't pay the down, so their interest is invalid. Therefore, the farmer can't claim title on the five acres because the buyer didn't have a valid interest. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says the buyer didn't have a legal claim. That's likely correct because the original deed was invalid without the down payment.

Option B says the buyer's defaulting was proper. But the buyer's initial deed wasn't valid, so the defaulting is not proper. So, B is incorrect.

Option C says the farmer's claim was not legally binding because the mortgage covered all 100. But that's irrelevant because the initial deed was invalid. So, C is not correct.

Option D says the farmer's quitclaim deed was after the daughter's. The farmer's deed was after the initial, so that's correct but how does it affect the title? The key is the initial deed's validity. 

Option E says the quitclaim deed was after the mortgage. The quitclaim is after the buyer's interest. 

So, the correct answer is either A or E. 

Wait, the buyer's interest was invalid, so the farmer can't sue. But the question is about whether the buyer can recover from the farmer. The buyer's own deed was valid, so the buyer can sue on that. But the question is about the farmer's claim.

Wait, the buyer can't sue the farmer because the farmer's claim was based on an invalid deed, so he can't claim title for the five acres. 

Alternatively, if the buyer's own deed is valid, the buyer can sue for the five acres, but the question is not about the buyer suing the farmer, but the buyer suing the farmer. 

In that case, the buyer's initial deed was invalid, so the farmer can't claim title because the buyer didn't have a valid interest. So, the correct answer is A: the buyer lost because the buyer didn't have a legal claim to the five acres.

Wait, but what about the farmer's claim? The buyer's initial deed was invalid, so the farmer can't claim the five acres. But the buyer can sue the farmer for the five acres because the buyer's own deed was valid. But the question is about the buyer's lawsuit, not the farmer's. So, the buyer is suing the farmer, and if the farmer's claim is not valid, the buyer wins.

So, the correct answer is A.
</think>

The buyer's initial deed was a warranty deed, which only conveys the interest to the buyer as to the full value when the buyer paid the $25,000 down and satisfied the mortgage. Since the buyer defaulted on the mortgage, their initial interest was invalid. Therefore, the farmer cannot claim title for the five acres as the buyer did not have a legal claim. The buyer can recover from the farmer for the five acres because their own deed was valid, but the question focuses on the buyer's claim against the farmer. Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
