Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a particle's rest mass. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in special relativity, the total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Oh wait, but sometimes units are tricky because sometimes c is included in the momentum terms. Wait, the question gives me momentum in GeV/c units. So p is given as 4.9 GeV/c.

Wait, so the problem states that the total energy is 5.0 GeV. Oh, right. So the formula would be E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But wait, I can rearrange that to solve for mc², which is the rest energy. So mc² equals the square root of (E² - (pc)²).

Wait, but here, because the units are in GeV, and c is in units of m/s, but when you plug into the equation, the units have to work out. Since E is in GeV, which is energy, and p is GeV/c, when you multiply p by c, it becomes GeV. So when you square p*c, it's (GeV)^2, and E squared is (GeV)^2. So everything checks out. So I can proceed without worrying about the units.

So the rest mass energy (mc²) is the square root of (E^2 - (pc)^2). Let me plug in the numbers. E is 5 GeV, p is 4.9 GeV/c. So (pc) is 4.9 GeV. So (pc)^2 is 4.9^2 = 24.01 (GeV)^2. E squared is 25 GeV².

So 25 -24.01 = 0.99. The square root of 0.99 is approximately 0.994987. So mc² is around 0.995 GeV. Looking at the options, the closest is option H: 3.5 GeV/c²? Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, no, option H is 3.5 GeV/c²? No wait, wait, let me look again. Oh, the options are A to J, with varying GeV/c².

Wait, no. Let me recheck the options. Oh, wait, mc² is in GeV because E is in GeV. So mc² is the rest mass energy, which is in GeV. So the rest mass is (mc²) = approximately 0.995 GeV. So looking at the options, which are given as GeV/c²? Wait, no, the options are labeled as GeV/c²? No, no, wait the options are labeled as rest mass in GeV/c²? Wait, no, wait, the options are A to J, each is a number in GeV/c²?

Wait, the question says, "the rest mass of a particle". So the rest mass is m, in units of GeV/c². So m = E_total² - (p c)^2 all under the square root, divided by c². But since E is given in GeV, and p in GeV/c, let me make sure.

Wait, wait, perhaps I need to compute mc². Let me go back.

The formula is E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. So mc² is the rest energy. So mc² = sqrt( E² - (pc)^2 )

E is 5 GeV.

pc is 4.9 GeV.

So (pc)^2 is 24.01 (GeV)^2.

E squared is 25 (GeV)^2.

So 25 - 24.01 = 0.99.

So sqrt(0.99) is approximately 0.994987.

So mc² is about 0.995 GeV. So the rest mass is approximately 1 GeV/c², but the options are given as GeV/c². Wait, but 0.995 is approximately 1. So the closest option is option D, which is 1.0 GeV/c². Wait, but wait, looking at the options:

A: 3.0

B:4.0

C:0.5

D:1.0

E:0.1

F:2.5

G:2.0

H:3.5

I:1.5

J:0.2

So the correct value is approximately 0.995 GeV/c², which is closest to option D (1.0 GeV/c²). Because 0.995 is just under 1, and the options don't have 0.995. The other options are spaced at 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc. So 0.995 is nearer to 1.0 than to 0.5, right? Because 0.995 is 0.495 away from 1.0, while 0.5 is 0.495 away. Wait, no, wait: 1.0 minus 0.995 is 0.005. 0.5 minus 0.995 is -0.495, but distance is 0.495. So 0.995 is 0.005 above 1.0, so it's closer to 1.0 than to 0.5. So the correct answer is D:1.0 GeV/c².

To determine the rest mass of the particle, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]

Here, the total energy \( E \) is given as \( 5.0 \, \text{GeV} \), and the momentum \( p \) is \( 4.9 \, \text{GeV}/c \). Rearranging the equation to solve for \( mc^2 \), the rest energy, we have:

\[
mc^2 = \sqrt{E^2 - (pc)^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
(mc^2)^2 = (5.0)^2 - (4.9)^2 = 25.0 - 24.01 = 0.99
\]

\[
mc^2 = \sqrt{0.99} \approx 0.995 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This value is approximately \( 1.0 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), as \( 0.995 \) is very close to \( 1.0 \). Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is **D: \( 1.0 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)**.
