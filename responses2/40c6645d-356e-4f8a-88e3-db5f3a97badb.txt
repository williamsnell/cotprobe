Question:

Suppose a monopoly market has a demand function in which quantity demanded depends not only on market price (P) but also on the amount of advertising the firm does (A, measured in dollars). The specific form of this function is Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A^2). The monopolistic firm's cost function is given by C = 10Q + 15 + A. Suppose there is no advertising (A = 0). What output will the profit-maximizing firm choose?

Options:

A: 20
B: 0
C: 12
D: 5
E: 8
F: 30
G: 15
H: 10
I: 18
J: 25

Alright, so I have this economics problem here about a monopoly market. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question says that the demand function is Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A²), and the cost function is C = 10Q + 15 + A. And they're asking what output the firm will choose when there's no advertising (A=0). The options are A to J.

Hmm, first, if A is zero, then the demand function simplifies. Let me plug that in. So when A=0, the equation becomes:

Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1*0 - 0.01*(0)^2) → Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0) → Q = (20 - P)*1 → Q = 20 - P.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, because (1 + 0.1A - 0.01A²) when A=0 is 1. So yes, Q = (20-P) when A is zero. So the demand curve is a straight line with slope -1, intercepting at P=20.

But I'm trying to find the profit-maximizing output. Profit is total revenue minus total cost. So I need to find R and C as functions of Q and set marginal revenue equal to marginal cost.

Wait, another approach: since A is zero, the cost function becomes C = 10Q + 15 + 0 → C=10Q +15.

Total revenue (TR) is P * Q. From the demand function, P is (20 - Q). So TR = Q*(20 - Q) = 20Q - Q².

To find marginal revenue (MR), I take the derivative of TR with respect to Q. So dTR/dQ = 20 - 2Q.

Marginal cost (MC) is derivative of C with respect to Q. C=10Q +15 → MC=10.

Set MR=MC: 20 - 2Q = 10.

Solving for Q: 20-10=2Q → 10=2Q → Q=5.

So the profit-maximizing output is 5 units. Looking at the options, D is 5. So I think the answer is D.

To determine the profit-maximizing output when A=0, we start with the demand function:

\[ Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A^2) \]

When \( A = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[ Q = 20 - P \]

Rearranging for \( P \):

\[ P = 20 - Q \]

The total revenue (TR) is:

\[ TR = P \times Q = (20 - Q) \times Q = 20Q - Q^2 \]

The marginal revenue (MR) is the derivative of TR with respect to \( Q \):

\[ MR = \frac{dTR}{dQ} = 20 - 2Q \]

The cost function is:

\[ C = 10Q + 15 + A \]

Since \( A = 0 \), the cost function simplifies to:

\[ C = 10Q + 15 \]

The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of \( C \) with respect to \( Q \):

\[ MC = \frac{dC}{dQ} = 10 \]

To maximize profit, set \( MR = MC \):

\[ 20 - 2Q = 10 \]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[ 20 - 10 = 2Q \]
\[ Q = 5 \]

Thus, the profit-maximizing output is 5 units. The correct answer is:

**D: 5**
