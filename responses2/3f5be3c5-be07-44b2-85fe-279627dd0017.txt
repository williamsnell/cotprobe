Question:

A widow owned an apartment building. Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that

Options:

A: the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years.
B: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
C: the student had made improvements to the property, thus extending the leasehold.
D: the student had a verbal agreement with the widow to extend the lease.
E: the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.
F: the widow had accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended.
G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student.
H: the widow had not clearly communicated the end of the lease term.
I: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
J: the leasehold contract was void ab initio.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically about leases and evictions. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that a widow owns an apartment building. A student signed a three-year lease with her for $800 a month. The lease term has already expired, but the student keeps paying. The widow is considering evicting him after the three-year term ends, but she hasn't accepted the next rent check yet. The student is asking why he's staying, and the options are A to J.

I need to figure out which argument is the strongest for the widow to prevent eviction. Let's think about each option.

Option A: The student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years. Well, generally, if someone has lived there for at least a year, that's grounds for eviction, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest point here. Because the lease was three years, but the student has been there longer than that—more than three years. So that's a valid point, but I'm not sure if it's the strongest.

Option B: The widow didn't give the student a requisition to terminate the term of years. If she didn't give a proper notice, she might be evicted. So this could be a strong argument. Because if she didn't send a notice before the lease ends, maybe she can evict him. So if she didn't give the required notice before the three-year term, that could be a reason to evict.

Option C: The student made improvements to the property, thus extending the lease. Wait, but the lease was a three-year term. If the student made improvements to the building, maybe the lease is extended? But the question says the term had expired, so making improvements wouldn't extend the term. Unless the student's actions somehow made the lease contract longer. But the question says the term had long since expired. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D: The student had a verbal agreement to extend the lease. So, if there was a verbal contract, perhaps the student was agreeing to a longer lease. But the question says the lease was for a three-year term, so if the student agreed to pay more, maybe it's a longer term. But whether that's a valid argument depends on if it's a contract with a written agreement. The question doesn't specify that, so maybe D isn't applicable.

Option E: The terms were binding on both parties. If the lease was binding, then the widow's rights would be enforceable. But if she's considering eviction for violating the lease, then maybe she can claim. But this seems a bit vague and not directly addressing why the student is staying.

Option F: The widow accepted rent for the next month before the three years ended. Wait, the question says the lease had expired. So if she accepted a rent check before the term ended, maybe she's in breach. But the situation is that the term had expired, so maybe she hasn't. The question says the student kept paying and the term had expired. So the widow hasn't accepted the next rent check yet, which might be a point against eviction.

Option G: The student was protected from eviction due to being a student. I mean, being a student could be a red herring. The argument is about the student's rights, not his status as a student. So this option is probably not correct.

Option H: The lease was void. If the term was already expired, and the lease was binding, then it might be void. But if the student kept paying, that would imply he's not in breach. However, if the lease was void, then the widow couldn't evict him. But this is a bit of a stretch because the student was paying, so the lease isn't void.

Option I: The lease was void ab initio. That implies the lease was invalid from the beginning. But the question says the term had expired, so perhaps the lease was still valid. The student's payment would be under the existing terms, not void. So I think this is incorrect.

Option J: The lease was void. That's similar to H. If the term was already expired and the lease was valid, then J wouldn't be valid. But the question doesn't state that the lease was invalid; it just says the term had expired, and the student kept paying. So J is probably incorrect.

So going back, the strongest argument for the widow to prevent eviction would be that she didn't give the student a notice to terminate the lease before the term expired. In that case, she could argue that the condition was breached, so she should evict him. So option B.

Wait, but another thought: If the lease had expired, would a student not giving a notice count as a breach? Because if the lease was valid, the student's continued payments would be under the existing terms. So giving a notice to terminate the term might be grounds for eviction.

Alternatively, if the lease had expired, and the student continued paying, that's a breach. But the question says the student agreed to pay, so the lease is still valid. Unless the student's continued payments indicate that it's no longer valid. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, if the lease had already expired, the student's continued payments could be grounds for eviction. Because the tenant's continued payments would have to be under the new lease terms, which may not be valid.

Wait, but in this case, the term had expired. So if the student continued paying, that might indicate that the original lease was still in effect. However, if the lease was for three years, and the student had been there for more than three years, he might have been evicted by other means, but the question is about eviction due to the lease.

If the student is paying the rent as per the existing terms, the lease hasn't expired—so if the student continued paying, that's a breach. But the question says the term had already expired, so the student's continued payment would be against an existing lease, not a new one. So in that case, giving a notice to terminate the original lease would be grounds for eviction.

Wait, but the question says the term had expired. So if the student had been a tenant for more than three years, but the term was already over, maybe that's a case of prior eviction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. So if the student had lived there for more than three years, but the term ended, that would be prior eviction. But in this case, the student is still paying, which would be a breach of the lease. But the question says the student agreed to pay and the term had expired. So maybe the student is still under the same lease, so giving a notice would be a breach.

Alternatively, perhaps the student's continued payment indicates that the lease was no longer in effect. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says the student agreed to pay, so the lease is already in effect. So if the student continued to pay, that's a breach of the existing lease. But the lease had already expired, so maybe the student's continued payments are under the existing terms, so the lease is still valid. Therefore, giving a notice to terminate the lease before the term expired would be a breach.

Wait, but the question says the term had expired, so the student's continued payments would be under the original terms, not a new lease. So perhaps this is not a breach.

Alternatively, if the term had expired, the student's continued payments would mean that the original lease was still valid. So giving a notice to terminate the original term would be a breach.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The original lease was for three years, but the term had already expired. The student continued paying. So the lease was already up, but the student is still paying. So the lease contract is now under a new term, but the question doesn't mention any new lease. So perhaps the student's continued payments are a breach, as the original lease was already up.

Wait, no, because the student's continued payment is under the existing three-year lease. So if the lease had expired, but the student continues, that would be a breach. So giving a notice to terminate the term before the lease ended would be a breach, so the student is evicted.

Alternatively, if the student had continued paying, the term was already over, so the student might be evicted.

So if the student had a valid right to stay because he had lived there for more than three years, but the term had expired, perhaps that's a prior eviction, but the problem is about eviction due to the lease.

Alternatively, perhaps the student's continued payments are a breach of the existing lease, so giving a notice to terminate before the term expired would be a breach. So the strongest argument would be that the student had a right to stay because he had lived there for more than three years, but that's not directly the question's focus.

Wait, the question is about the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction if the widow had given a proper notice before the three-year term ended. So if the student had a valid right to stay because of the living there for more than three years, but that's his right, not an argument against eviction.

Wait, the question is about the student's strongest argument against eviction if the widow had given the student a proper notice. So the argument would be about the tenant's rights, not the landlord's.

So looking back at the options, the strongest argument for eviction would be that the student had a right to stay because he had lived there for more than three years. But that's the student's right, not the argument from the landlord. Alternatively, if the student was not properly informed about the term ending, that would be a breach.

Wait, the options are about the student's argument. So the question is, if the tenant had a valid argument that the term had expired and thus should be evicted, then what would that be.

So the question is, what's the strongest reason the student has to prevent eviction if the widow hadn't given a proper notice before the term expired.

Wait, perhaps the student's continued payment is a breach. If the student's continued payments are against the original three-year lease, which had already ended, then the student is under a new lease. Alternatively, perhaps the term had expired, so the student's continued payments are against the existing lease, making it invalid.

Wait, but the question is about the student's argument. So, if the student is evicted, it's because the tenant's continued payments are against the existing lease, which is now over. So if the student had a valid right to stay because he lived there for more than three years, that's his right, but the argument against eviction would be that the lease's term had expired and the student continued, so it's a breach.

So the strongest argument would be that the student had a right to stay because he had lived there for more than three years, but that's his right, not the argument against eviction.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is considering the scenario where the student is evicted because the term had expired. So the argument is about the student's rights. So the correct argument would be that he had a right to stay, but that's not the option. The options are about what would be the strongest argument if the notice was given before the term ended.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: the widow didn't give a notice before the term expired.

Because if the student continued paying, the widow might have a right to evict him, as it's a breach of the lease. But if the notice was given before the term ended, then the student is evicted. So the strongest argument would be that the notice wasn't given, thus the condition was breached.

Alternatively, another option could be that the student had a right to stay because he had lived there for more than three years, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B says the widow didn't give a requisitenotice before the term ended. So if the student continued paying, the widow would have grounds to evict him. So if the notice wasn't given, the student is evicted. So that's the strongest argument.

So the correct answer should be B.

The question revolves around a student who has lived in an apartment building for more than three years and continues to pay rent under a three-year lease agreement. The landlord has not yet accepted the next rent check, and the student argues that the landlord should evict him. The strongest argument for eviction would involve demonstrating a breach of the lease or failure to provide adequate notice.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: The student's right to stay is valid, but it does not address eviction directly. This is not the strongest argument for eviction.
2. **Option B**: If the landlord did not give a proper notice before the lease term expired, the student's continued payments could breach the lease, making eviction a valid argument. This is the strongest argument because a failure to provide notice is a clear breach of the lease condition.
3. **Option C**: Improving the property to extend the lease is irrelevant since the term had already expired. This option is incorrect.
4. **Option D**: The student's verbal agreement to extend the lease is speculative and not directly relevant to eviction.
5. **Option E**: The terms being binding on both parties is not a strong argument for eviction.
6. **Option F**: The widow accepting rent for the next month is irrelevant since the term had already expired.
7. **Option G**: The student's status as a student is irrelevant to eviction disputes.
8. **Option H**: The lease being void is incorrect if the term had expired and the student was paying.
9. **Option I**: The lease being void from the start is not applicable.
10. **Option J**: The lease being void is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The strongest argument is that the landlord failed to provide a proper notice before the lease expired, leading to a breach of the lease condition. This would make eviction a valid argument for the student.
