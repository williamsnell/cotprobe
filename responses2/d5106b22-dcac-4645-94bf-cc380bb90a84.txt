Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Singer's principle of equality. Let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my business and management concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the question is asking what Singer's equality requires. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Singer's work, I think, is related to equality in organizations. So, the options are about different types of considerations or treatment.

Let me recall some key points about equality principles. I remember that equality in an organization aims to give all employees the same opportunities and resources. So, for someone like Michael Porter, he discussed various equality concepts.

One of the key ideas is that equality requires equal consideration. That is, everyone should receive the same treatment. So equal treatment would mean giving each employee the same access to resources and opportunities. Wait, but that's option E: unequal treatment. Oh wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If equality requires equal treatment, then option E is unequal treatment, which would be the opposite. So maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

Singer's equality principle: equal treatment, equal consideration. So, if equality is the principle, it requires that each employee receives equal treatment. So, the treatment is equal for everyone. So looking at the options, which ones are about equality. Let's look at the options:

A: differential indifference.
B: unequal consideration.
C: identical consideration.
D: identical indifference.
E: unequal treatment.
F: equal consideration.
G: equal treatment.
H: identical treatment.
I: differential treatment.
J: differential consideration.

Wait, the options are about what the equality requires. So, the equality principle would mean that all employees are given equal consideration. So the treatment is equal. So which option says that? Let's see.

Option F is equal consideration. That's one of the options. And option G is equal treatment. Oh, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the terms can be tricky.

Wait, the "principle of equality" probably refers to the principle that everyone should be equal. So the equality requires that everyone is treated equally. So the principle would require that each person gets equal treatment. So which option is that?

Looking at the options, option G says 'equal treatment.' So does that mean that the equality principle requires each person to be treated equally, meaning equal treatment. So option G would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, I've heard that the equality principle includes that everyone should be equally treated. That is, equal treatment is required because of equality. So if the equality principle is in place, equal treatment is required. So yes, G.
</think>

The correct answer is G: equal treatment. 

**Explanation:**
According to Singer, the principle of equality requires that all employees receive equal treatment. This means that each person is given the same opportunities and resources, ensuring fairness and fairness in the organization. 

Answer: G
