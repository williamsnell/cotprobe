Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the homogeneous solution of a differential equation for a capacitor in an RLC series circuit. The capacitor is (1/2) F, R is 4Ω, L is 4H. The initial conditions are i_L(0) = 1/4 A and v_C(0) = 0. Hmm, I remember that for RLC circuits, we model the voltage across the capacitor with a second-order linear differential equation.

Wait, the homogeneous solution is the part that comes from solving the characteristic equation of the homogeneous equation. So first, I need to set up the differential equation. The general form for an RLC series circuit is:

L di/dt + R i + (1/C) v = 0

But wait, since v is the voltage across the capacitor, and i is the current through it, I think there's a relation between v and i. Oh right, because in a capacitor, v = L di/dt. So substituting that into the equation:

L di/dt + R i + (1/C) (L di/dt) = 0

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The capacitor voltage v_C equals L di/dt. So, substituting into the original equation:

L di/dt + R i + (1/C) v = 0 → L di/dt + R i + (1/C) (L di/dt) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me rephrase. The equation is L di/dt + R i + (1/C) v = 0. But since v = L di/dt, substitute that in:

L di/dt + R i + (1/C)(L di/dt) = 0.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because v is the voltage across the capacitor, so v = L di/dt. So substituting that into the equation:

L di/dt + R i + (1/C) v = 0 → L di/dt + R i + (1/C)(L di/dt) = 0.

Wait, that's not correct. Because the original equation is L di/dt + R i + (1/C) v = 0. So substituting v = L di/dt, we have:

L di/dt + R i + (1/C)(L di/dt) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because we have the same term (L di/dt) multiplied by 1/C. So combining terms:

( L + L/C ) di/dt + R i = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. The standard RLC circuit equation in terms of current is:

L d²i/dt² + R d i/dt + (1/C) i = 0.

Wait, that's right because the voltage across each element is L di/dt for the inductor, R i for the resistor, and (1/C) i for the capacitor. The sum is zero since it's a closed loop. So that's the correct form.

But wait, I also know that v_C = (1/C) ∫ i dt, which is L di/dt. So perhaps I should express the differential equation in terms of i(t).

Alternatively, since v_C is given, perhaps it's better to write the equation in terms of v_C. Let me try that.

The standard second-order equation for a series RLC circuit is:

L d²v/dt² + R dv/dt + (1/C) v = 0.

Yes, that's right. So given L=4H, R=4Ω, C=1/2 F. So substituting:

4 d²v/dt² +4 dv/dt + (1/(1/2)) v = 0 → 4 d²v/dt² +4 dv/dt + 2 v = 0.

Simplify this by dividing all terms by 2:

2 d²v/dt² + 2 dv/dt + v = 0.

So the equation is 2 v'' + 2 v' + v = 0.

The homogeneous solution will involve solving the characteristic equation. So for a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients, we have:

r² + (2/2) r + (1/2) = 0 → wait, wait, wait. Wait, the equation is 2v'' + 2v' + v = 0. Let me divide all terms by 2 to get:

v'' + v' + (1/2) v = 0.

So the characteristic equation is r² + r + (1/2) = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation, r = [-1 ± sqrt(1 - 2)] / 2.

Because the discriminant is b² -4ac = (1)^2 - 4*(1)*(1/2) = 1-2= -1.

So sqrt(-1) is i, so the roots are complex: (-1 ± i)/2.

Which can be written as:

r = -1/2 ± i (1/2).

So the homogeneous solution is of the form:

v(t) = e^(-t/2) [ C1 cos(t/2) + C2 sin(t/2) ].

Looking at the options, I see options F and H have e^(-t/2) multiplied by cos and sin terms. So perhaps the homogeneous solution is part of these options.

But wait, the question asks for the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution is the part that comes from the complex roots, so the homogeneous solution is e^(-t/2) [ cos(t/2) + sin(t/2) ] multiplied by constants. So the homogeneous solution is the sum of the two terms with constants C1 and C2.

Looking at the options:

A: e^(1/2)t cos(1/2 t ) V → exponential multiplied by cos, which doesn't match our roots (negative exponent), so probably not.

B: e^-(3/4)t sin(1/2 t ) V → exponential too fast and sine, but our roots have (-1/2) in exponent, not -3/4. So probably not.

C: e^(1/2)t sin(1/2 t ) V → same reason as A, exponential and sin, wrong.

D: e^-(1/2)t (1 + sin(1/2t)) V → e^(-t/2) multiplied by 1 + sin. This is a particular solution, not homogeneous. So probably not the homogeneous solution.

E: e^-(1/4)t cos(1/4 t ) V → exponential with small exponent, not matching -1/2.

F: e^-(1/2)t cos(1/2 t ) V → This looks like the homogeneous solution because the exponent is -t/2, and the cos term is correct.

G: e^-(1/2)t tanh (1/2) t V → hyperbolic function, not matching.

H: e^-(1/2)t sin (1/2) t V → same as F except sine.

Wait, but the homogeneous solution can be written as a combination of e^(-t/2) [ cos(t/2) + sin(t/2) ].

So in the multiple-choice options, F and H are parts of the homogeneous solution. But the question asks for the homogeneous solution, which would be the general solution, including both C1 and C2. But the options don't seem to have expressions for the general solution. All the options are particular solutions except F and H which are parts of the homogeneous solution.

Wait, the question says "the homogeneous solution to the differential equation", so the form of the homogeneous solution is either F or H. So looking at the options, F is e^(-1/2)t cos(1/2 t ), H is e^(-1/2)t sin(1/2 t ). Which one is the homogeneous solution?

Wait the homogeneous solution is the solution when we have only the terms involving e^(-t/2) multiplied by cosine and sine. So the homogeneous solution is a combination of both. But the options provided don't have a combination; each is a separate solution. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps we can think about initial conditions to find the constants. The problem gives i_L(0) = 1/4 A and v_C(0)=0 V.

But wait, the homogeneous solution is part of the general solution, which includes a particular solution as well. Thus, the homogeneous solution is the part of the general solution that satisfies the homogeneous equation, and the particular solution is the steady-state part.

But the question is only asking for the homogeneous solution. So the homogeneous solution would be e^(-t/2) [ C cos(t/2) + S sin(t/2) ].

In the options, F and H are each of these forms, but with only one of the terms. So perhaps the homogeneous solution is a combination of both, but the options provided only have individual terms. Wait, looking back: the options are F and H. So perhaps the homogeneous solution is the combination, but the options have each term as separate options.

Wait, but perhaps the question is only asking for the form of the homogeneous solution, which is e^(-t/2) multiplied by a combination of cos and sin. So in that case, the homogeneous solution is F or H. But in the options, F and H are separate. So perhaps the question is expecting only the homogeneous part, but the options don't have a combined term.

Wait, the problem says "the homogeneous solution", which is the solution to the homogeneous equation. So the homogeneous solution is the part of the general solution without the particular solution. So it's the terms without the particular solution, which would be e^(-t/2) multiplied by (C cos + S sin).

So looking at the options, F and H are the potential forms. But the options don't have any combination. So perhaps the question is only asking for the form of the homogeneous solution, and the correct form is either F or H.

Wait, but I think the answer should be F or H. But looking at the options given.

Wait, let's think again. The homogeneous solution is the solution to the homogeneous equation, which is without the particular solution. So the homogeneous solution would be the terms that involve e^(-t/2) multiplied by (cos + sin). So in the options, F and H are these terms.

But the options include only one of them as the homogeneous solution. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the characteristic equation. Let me check.

The original equation is 4v'' +4v' + 2v=0 → when I divided by 2, it becomes 2v'' +2v' +v=0, which is correct.

The characteristic equation is 2r² + 2r + 1 =0 → r = [-2 ± sqrt(4-8)]/(2*2) → (-2 ± sqrt(-4))/4 → (-2 ± 2i)/4 → (-1 ± i)/2.

So yes, r is -1/2 ± i (1/2). So the homogeneous solution is e^(-t/2) [ C cos(t/2) + D sin(t/2) ].

So the homogeneous solution has both cosine and sine terms. So the options F and H are the ones that have e^(-t/2) multiplied by either cos or sin. So perhaps the homogeneous solution is a combination of both, but the options don't have a combined term. So perhaps I need to find which of the options matches the homogeneous solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the homogeneous part, but that's not the case because the homogeneous solution includes both terms. However, the options don't have a combined option. So perhaps the only way is to look for the homogeneous solution as F or H.

Wait, but how can both be correct if the options don't have a combination? I think perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.

The question says: "Find the homogeneous solution to a differential equation for the voltagev_C(t) across a (1/2) F capacitor in a series RLC circuit where R = 4Ω, L = 4H,i_L(0) = (1/4) A, andv_C(0) = 0."

Ah, so the question is to find the homogeneous solution, which is the part of the general solution that comes from the homogeneous equation, also known as the complementary solution.

So the homogeneous solution is e^(-t/2) [ C cos(t/2) + D sin(t/2) ].

Looking at the options, options F and H have e^(-1/2 t) multiplied by cos or sin, respectively. So perhaps the homogeneous solution is either F or H. But how do I choose between them?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the initial conditions. The general solution is v(t) = e^(-t/2) [ C cos(t/2) + D sin(t/2) ].

So applying initial conditions:

At t=0, v(0) =0 → 0 = e^(0) [ C *1 + D *0 ] → C=0.

So the solution simplifies to v(t) = e^(-t/2) D sin(t/2).

So the homogeneous solution is v(t) = D e^(-t/2) sin(t/2). So that would correspond to option H.

So option H is the homogeneous solution.

To find the homogeneous solution to the given differential equation for the voltage \( v_C(t) \) across a \( \frac{1}{2} \, \text{F} \) capacitor in a series \( RLC \) circuit, we start by writing the differential equation. The equation is derived from Kirchhoff's voltage law and is given by:

\[
4 \frac{d^2v_C}{dt^2} + 4 \frac{dv_C}{dt} + 2v_C = 0.
\]

Dividing through by 2 simplifies the equation to:

\[
2 \frac{d^2v_C}{dt^2} + 2 \frac{dv_C}{dt} + v_C = 0.
\]

The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:

\[
2r^2 + 2r + 1 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots:

\[
r = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-1}}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{i}{2}.
\]

Thus, the homogeneous solution is:

\[
v_h(t) = e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \left( C_1 \cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) + C_2 \sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \right).
\]

The question asks for the homogeneous solution, which corresponds to the terms involving \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \) and \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \). Among the given options:

- **A**: \( e^{\frac{1}{2}t} \cos\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) V \) — Exponential term is incorrect (should be \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \)).
- **B**: \( e^{-\frac{3}{4}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) V \) — Exponential term is incorrect (should be \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \)).
- **C**: \( e^{\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) V \) — Exponential term is incorrect (should be \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \)).
- **D**: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \left(1 + \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right)\right) V \) — This is a particular solution, not the homogeneous solution.
- **E**: \( e^{-\frac{1}{4}t} \cos\left(\frac{1}{4}t\right) V \) — Exponential term and angular frequency are incorrect.
- **F**: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \cos\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) V \) — Matches the homogeneous solution.
- **G**: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \tanh\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) V \) — Incorrect functional form.
- **H**: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) V \) — Matches the homogeneous solution.
- **I**: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{3}{4}t\right) V \) — Incorrect angular frequency.
- **J**: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \cos\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) V \) — Matches the homogeneous solution.

The correct homogeneous solutions are **F** and **H**. However, the problem specifies a single homogeneous solution, and the most general form is given by the combination of \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \) and \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \). Since the options do not include a combined term, **F** and **H** are the closest matches. Between **F** and **H**, **F** corresponds to \( e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \), which is the homogeneous solution without the sine term.

ANSWER: F
