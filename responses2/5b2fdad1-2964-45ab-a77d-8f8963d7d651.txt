Okay, so I've got this economics question here about short-run cost curves when the price of capital increases. Hmm. I remember that cost curves are important for understanding how a firm's costs behave as output changes. Let me try to think this through.

So the question is about the short run. That means factors of production that can't be changed in the short term are labor (L) and capital (K). The firm is supposed to decide how much to produce by choosing the optimal level of labor and capital.

The question states that the annual price of capital increases. Wait, capital is a fixed cost, right? Because in the short run, capital can't be changed. So if K increases, that's a change in the price of the fixed input. But wait, in the short run, total cost is fixed cost plus variable cost. Fixed cost is TFC. Variable cost is TVC, which depends on labor.

Wait, let me think again. Capital is a fixed cost, so its price doesn't change in the short run. So if the price of capital (like the rental rate) increases, the fixed costs (TFC) will increase. But wait, how does that affect the cost curves themselves?

Wait, the cost curves are functions of output. So TFC is a fixed cost, so it doesn't change with output. Average fixed cost (AFC) is TFC divided by output. So if TFC goes up, AFC increases. That would mean AFC curve shifts upward. 

But what about the other cost curves? Like, total cost (TC) is TFC + TVC. TVC depends on labor. If the firm is choosing the optimal level of labor (the quantity of labor that minimizes cost), then increasing capital's price would affect TVC.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how the firm's decisions are made. The firm will choose the amount of labor and capital to minimize total cost. So when the price of capital increases, the firm's optimal choice might change.

Wait, but the question is about the short-run cost curves. So fixed costs are TFC, which increases, but variable costs are TVC which depends on labor. If the price of capital increases, does it affect TVC? Well, TVC is w * L, where w is the wage rate and L is the quantity of labor. If the wage rate (w) remains the same, then if the price of capital (like the rental rate) increases, the firm might choose to use more labor to compensate, because each unit of capital now costs more. Or, perhaps the firm might not change their choice of capital at all if w isn't affected. Wait, no, in the short run, the firm can't change K, so they have to decide on L.

Wait, no, the firm's choice of L is based on the ratio of marginal product of labor to the rental rate. So if the rental rate (r) increases, the firm might increase L if the MP of labor (MPL) is higher than the new rental rate, or else reduce L. But the question is whether the cost curves shift.

Wait, but in the short run, the firm's cost curves are functions of output. So if the fixed costs (TFC) go up, then AFC would shift upward, but what about ATC? ATC is AFC + AVC. If TFC increases, but the firm's optimal output might change.

Wait, but the question is about the short-run cost curves themselves, not whether the firm's choice of output has changed. So the cost curves are based on the current state of technology, input prices, etc. So if the price of capital increases, but in the short run, the firm can't change K, so the cost curves would adjust based on the new input prices.

Wait, but if the price of capital increases, it affects the firm's cost structure. Let's think about the definitions.

Marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of total cost with respect to output. Average variable cost (AVC) is TVC divided by output. Average total cost (ATC) is TVC plus TFC over output.

If the price of capital increases, then the firm's input prices have changed. So the firm would adjust the optimal ratio of L and K to minimize cost. But the question is about the cost curves themselves, not how much they change.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about how TFC and AFC change. TFC increases, so AFC increases. So AFC curve shifts upward.

What about MC and AVC? Well, MC is the derivative of TVC, which is w * L. If the wage rate w remains unchanged, then TVC is proportional to L, so MC is constant. So MC is unaffected? But that's only if w is fixed. Wait, but the question is about capital price change. Oh wait, in the short run, capital is fixed. So if the price of capital (r) increases, but the wage rate (w) isn't mentioned, perhaps it's assumed to be unchanged. So TVC = w*L, so if w is fixed, then TVC is increasing with L. So the MC curve is still w, which is constant.

But then, the firm's optimal L also depends on r. So if r increases, the firm might increase L if the MP of labor (MPL) is higher than the new rental rate, or else reduce L. But the cost curves themselves: if the firm's output changes, but the question is about the curves' shifts, not whether output changes.

Wait, but the options are about whether the curves shift upward or downward. Let's look at the options. Option A says marginal cost and average fixed cost curves shift upward. But MC is a function of variable cost, and if w is fixed, MC is flat. So if the firm chooses to increase L because r increases, but w is fixed, the MC remains the same (w), so the MC doesn't shift, just its position. But the question is about whether the curves themselves shift. So if the MC is w, which is fixed, the MC curve is the same but at a higher level. Wait, no, the MC curve is based on the variable cost. If w increases, then MC would increase, but in the question, w is probably fixed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think differently. Suppose the price of capital (r) increases. How does that affect the firm's cost curves?

In the short run, the firm's cost curves are based on their input prices. Assuming labor is variable and capital is fixed, the firm's cost curves are adjusted.

So, TFC is the cost of capital. If r increases, TFC increases. But since the firm can't change K, the TFC is part of fixed costs. So AFC (TFC / Q) would increase, so AFC curve shifts upward.

But what about MC? The firm's MC is derived from the derivative of TVC, which is w * L. If w is fixed, then MC is flat. So MC doesn't change.

AVC is (w * L)/Q. Since L is a function of Q (depends on the firm's choice), but if w is fixed, then at the optimal level of L, the MC and AVC would determine the firm's choice.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the short-run cost curves change when input prices change. For example, if capital becomes more expensive, the firm's total costs will be higher for any given level of output. So AFC and ATC would increase because TFC is higher. But since AFC is TFC/Q, and TFC increases, AFC increases. ATC is AFC + AVC. If TFC increases, but the firm's output could be higher, but the question is about the curves themselves.

Wait, let's think of the cost curves. In the short run, when the firm's capital increases (but K is fixed), the cost curves would shift. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the firm's optimal output might increase because more labor can be used to take advantage of the higher rental rate. So the firm might produce more, but the cost curves themselves (like AFC and ATC) would depend on the output.

Wait, but the question is about what happens to the cost curves, not whether output changes. So, if TFC increases, AFC shifts upward, but what about MC and AVC? Well, since w is fixed, MC curves would be the same, but at a higher level.

So in the short run, the MC curve remains the same, but since TFC has increased, the ATC curve would shift upward. Because ATC = AFC + AVC. So increasing TFC would shift ATC upward. But wait, let me think about this.

Wait, no. The MC is w, which is fixed. So the MC curve is the same, but at a higher level. So the MC curve doesn't shift, it just becomes higher.

But the question is about the shift in the curves. So, for MC: no shift, just the same curve at a higher level. So the MC doesn't shift, it's same, but the MC itself is at a higher point. But the options talk about shifting upward or downward.

Wait, the options are whether the curves shift. So if TFC increases, AFC shifts upward. So AFC curve moves up. So option A says both MC and AFC shift upward. But that can't be right because MC is fixed.

Wait, option A says MC and AFC shift upward. But MC is fixed, but the firm's output might change.

Another approach: when the price of capital increases, the firm's cost curves' behavior would change. Since capital is a fixed cost, but in the short run, the firm can't change K. So, the firm's production function is constrained by L and K. If K increases in price, what does that do to the firm's cost curves?

Alternatively, if the price of capital (r) increases, the firm's total cost depends on r. So for any given level of output, the firm would have to pay more for capital. But since r is fixed, but the firm is constrained by the input prices, perhaps the firm's optimal production changes.

Wait, but the question is about the cost curves themselves. So, for example, the average fixed cost (AFC) curve would shift upward because TFC is increasing. The average variable cost (AVC) depends on how much labor is used with the new input prices. But if the wage rate remains the same, and the rental rate increases, the firm might increase L if the MP of labor is higher than the new rental rate. So, the firm's choice of L would change. But the cost curves (ATC, MC, etc.) are functions of output, so their shapes might change.

Wait, but in the short run, the cost curves are functions of output. If the firm's cost curves are based on their input prices, then when the rental rate increases, the same level of output may require more labor, but since TFC is TFC = r*K, which is higher, and K is fixed, the TFC increases, so AFC and ATC will rise.

Wait, but the problem is that the short run cost curves are functions of output. So when the price of capital increases, the firm's cost curves (ATC, AFC, etc.) will shift because the TFC is higher, but the variable costs (TVC) are based on the same level of L.

Wait, perhaps the MC and AVC curves will shift because the marginal cost is based on the derivative of TVC. If r increases, the firm will choose more L, so the MC (which is the derivative of TVC, w*L) increases, but if w is fixed, then MC remains flat. So the MC curve doesn't shift, but the ATC curve shifts upward because AFC is increasing.

But the question is about the short-run cost curves. So, if the price of capital increases, the firm's total cost increases, thus TFC increases. So AFC increases, so AFC curve shifts upward. ATC is AFC + AVC. Since AFC goes up but AVC depends on variable costs, which could be the same or change. But since the firm is choosing more L, perhaps the optimal output increases. So ATC would rise as well.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on the short-run cost curves, not the firm's output decision. So the short-run cost curves would shift because TFC has increased. But the MC curve is the derivative of TVC, which is w*L. So if w is fixed, the MC doesn't change. It's a flat line, but at a higher level. So the MC curve doesn't shift upward or downward, it just becomes higher.

So the MC curve doesn't shift. So option A says MC and AFC shift upward. But MC isn't changing. So A is incorrect.

Option B: The average fixed cost and average total cost curve shift upward. But AFC shifts up, ATC would also shift up. So B says both AFC and ATC shift up. So this would be correct, but wait, if TFC increases, both AFC and ATC would shift upward. But why would the question's options include B? Let me look back.

Wait, the question is about whether the curves shift, not whether the firm chooses a higher output. So in the short run, the curves are functions of output. If the firm's output remains the same, but TFC increases, then curves like AFC, ATC, etc., would shift upward.

So, for example, if the price of capital increases, but the firm's output level doesn't change (it's still producing Q), then AFC would increase, because TFC is higher. So AFC curve moves upwards. ATC would also increase because AFC is increasing. So the ATC and AFC curves would both shift upward.

But wait, the question doesn't specify that the output level changes. It just asks what happens to the short-run cost curves. So the curves themselves (like AFC and ATC) would shift upward because TFC is going up.

So the correct answer would be B: the average fixed cost and average total cost curves will shift upward.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the price of capital increases, does that affect the marginal cost curve? If the rental rate increases, but the wage rate is unchanged, then the firm would choose to use more capital if the rental rate is higher than the wage rate. So, because of the higher rental rate, the firm would increase L, which would lead to higher output. But the cost curves themselves (like MC and AVC) are functions of output, not of the firm's L.

Wait, but the question is about the cost curves, which are functions of output. So, the cost curves (ATC, AFC, etc.) would be based on the current price levels. So if the price of capital increases, TFC increases, so AFC and ATC curves shift upward.

But the MC curve is the derivative of TVC. Since TVC is w*L, if w is fixed, then MC is flat and doesn't shift. So the MC curve doesn't move upward or downward. So the MC curve remains the same.

So in the short run, the cost curves include the AFC, ATC, and MC. The AFC curve shifts upward because TFC is increasing. The ATC shifts upward because AFC increases. The MC curve doesn't shift.

So the correct answer would be B: AFC and ATC shift upward.

Wait, but then why is there an option C, which says MC and AVC shift upward? No, because MC isn't shifting, only the AFC and ATC.

Looking back at the options:

A: MC and AFC shift upward. No, because MC isn't moving.

B: Average fixed and average total cost shift upward. Yes.

C: MC and AVC shift upward. No, because MC isn't shifting.

So the correct answer is B.
</think>

When the annual price of capital increases in the short run, the firm's cost curves are affected as follows:

1. **Average Fixed Cost (AFC):**  
   AFC is calculated as \( \text{AFC} = \frac{\text{TFC}}{Q} \), where TFC is total fixed cost (TFC). Since TFC increases due to the higher price of capital, AFC increases. Therefore, the AFC curve shifts upward.

2. **Average Total Cost (ATC):**  
   ATC is calculated as \( \text{ATC} = \text{AFC} + \text{AVC} \). As TFC increases, AFC increases, which in turn increases ATC. Thus, the ATC curve also shifts upward.

3. **Marginal Cost (MC):**  
   MC is the derivative of total cost (TC) with respect to output. Since the wage rate (w) is unchanged, and the marginal product of labor (MPL) depends on the production function, the firm's optimal choice of labor (L) may change. However, in the short run, the MC curve remains unchanged because it represents the cost of producing one additional unit of output based on the input prices.

4. **Average Variable Cost (AVC):**  
   AVC is calculated as \( \text{AVC} = \frac{\text{VC}}{Q} \), where VC is total variable cost. With the higher price of capital, the firm may choose to increase its output, which could lead to higher AVC. However, this is not a direct effect of the short-run cost curves themselves but rather an outcome of the firm's production decisions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A:** Incorrect. MC does not shift upward; it remains flat. AFC and ATC do shift upward because TFC increases.
- **B:** Correct. Both AFC and ATC shift upward due to the increase in TFC.
- **C:** Incorrect. MC does not shift upward; it remains unchanged.
- **D:** Incorrect. MC does not shift upward; it remains unchanged.
- **E:** Incorrect. Neither AFC nor ATC shifts upward.
- **F:** Incorrect. AFC and ATC shift upward, not downward.
- **G:** Incorrect. AVC does not shift upward; it depends on the firm's production decisions.
- **H:** Incorrect. MC does not shift upward; it remains unchanged.
- **J:** Incorrect. AFC and ATC shift upward, not downward.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, as the average fixed cost and average total cost curves shift upward due to the increase in total fixed costs (TFC).
