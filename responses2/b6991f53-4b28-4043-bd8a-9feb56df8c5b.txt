Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Singer's understanding of the principle of equality of human beings. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what Singer meant by that, but I'll try to figure it out.

First, I remember that Singer is a philosopher, maybe from analytic philosophy, I think. I think he wrote about ethics and rights. So, the question is about the equality principle in his view.

The options are A to J, each describing different principles. Let's look at each one.

Option A: A description of an alleged actual equality among humans. So, equality as it exists, not as a principle. Like, maybe the idea that all humans are equal in some way, as in they have the same rights or something.

Option B: A description of an alleged equality among all living beings. This seems similar to A but perhaps more about all living beings rather than just humans. So maybe it's a broader statement about equality across species.

Option C: A prescription for treating nonhuman animals. I don't think this is about equality. That's more about how to treat animals, not the principle of equality.

Option D: An alleged inequality among living beings. So, the opposite of B. It's saying humans are unequal, perhaps in some way.

Option E: A prescription for treating humans. Again, this is about how to treat humans, not a principle.

Option F: An actual inequality among humans. That's another way of saying inequality, but in the sense that it's a real, factual inequality.

Option G: Superiority of humans over nonhuman. Doesn't directly relate to equality.

Option H: A prescription for treating both humans and nonhuman equally. This sounds like a principle where equality is a rule, not just a description.

Option I: Treatment of nonhuman animals differently. Again, about treatment, not equality.

Option J: Treatment of the environment. Also about the environment, not equality.

So, the question is about Singer's understanding. I think Singer might have proposed something like the principle that all humans are equal, and that this should be a rule of treatment, not just a description.

Wait, Singer in his work might have written about the principle of equality, which is a principle, not a description. So, the equality would be a rule they should follow, not just a fact about existing equality.

Looking back at the options, option H says a prescription of how to treat both humans and nonhuman animals equally. That sounds like a rule, a prescription.

Option B is about equality among all living beings, which is more about the fact that equality is a principle, not a rule.

So, Singer's equality is a rule, a principle that should guide how we treat humans and nonhumans equally.

Wait, what's the difference between option H and option B?

Option B is about equality as a fact, like all living beings are equal in some way. Option H is about treating them equally as a rule.

I think Singer's equality is a principle, not a description. So, the equality is a rule, so option H is the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Singer's work, maybe The Ethics of the Rights of Man and Women, he discusses the idea that equality is a principle that should be followed. So, he's not just stating that equality exists, but that it's a rule.

So, the principle is that we should treat humans and nonhumans equally. So, the equality is a prescription (a rule), not an actual fact.

So, the correct answer would be H: a prescription of how we should treat both human and nonhuman animals equally. Because it's a rule, not a description of a fact.

Alternatively, if B were correct, it would be a description of equality, but I think H is the prescription.

So, the answer is H.
</think>

The correct answer is H: a prescription of how we should treat both human and nonhuman animals equally.

**Explanation:** Singer's principle of equality is described as a prescription, not a description of a fact. This principle holds that equality should be followed as a rule, not just a factual statement. Therefore, option H, which outlines a prescription for treating both humans and nonhumans equally, accurately reflects Singer's understanding of equality as a rule. 

Answer: H
