Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the AMT tax preference items for West. Hmm, I remember that the Adjusted Monthly Tax (AMT) system has different items that are treated as a tax preference. Let me think through the steps.

First, the question gives me some figures: long-term capital gain is $15,000, percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis is $9,000, and dividends from publicly held companies are $10,000. West is single, no dependents, so his AMT calculation should be straightforward.

Wait, what's the order of these items? I think the AMT preferences are usually ordered from highest to lowest. Let me recall the order of preferences. I remember that the order is: Dividends, then capital gains, followed by other items. So, the highest preference is Dividends first, then capital gains, then Dividends again, then maybe percentages, and so on.

So, looking at the numbers: Dividends are $10,000. Then capital gains are $15,000. Then the percentage depletion is $9,000. Oh wait, but wait, the order is Dividends first, then Capital Gains, then other items. So in the given data, the order is Dividends, Capital Gains, then the percentage depletion.

Wait, no, I think the exact order is: Dividends (first), then capital gains (second), then the percentage depletion (third?), but wait, sometimes other items like the special elections of the CFE (which is a different topic) come before the percentage depletion. But here, the question is about the AMT tax preference items, so I think the order is as per the rules, which I think is: Dividends first, then capital gains, then the percentage depletion, then possibly the special elections of the CFE, then the interest deduction, then the itemized deductions, and then the other items.

Wait, but the question doesn't mention CFE or other items, so maybe we can ignore those. So the order is:

1. Dividends: $10,000
2. Capital Gains: $15,000
3. Percentage Depletion: $9,000

So the preferences are: First, the $10,000 Dividends. Then, the $15,000 capital gains. Then, the $9,000 percentage depletion.

So the total preference items would be 10k +15k +9k? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because each item is a separate tax preference item. So each of these would be added as separate preferences. The total would be 10k +15k +9k = 34k.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The order is correct. I think the order of treatment is: Dividends, then capital gains, then other items. So in this scenario, the order is as I wrote. So, each of these is a separate item.

So the tax preference items would be:

- Dividends: $10,000
- Capital Gains: $15,000
- Percentage Depletion: $9,000

Wait, but wait, what's the correct formula to sum them up? Because each is a separate item. So adding them together would give 10k +15k +9k = 34k.

Looking at the options, option I is 34,000. So the answer should be I.

But wait, let me think again. Oh wait, the options are A to J, and I is 34,000. The other options are 15k (A), 24k (B), 20k (C), etc.

But wait, I think I'm mixing up the order. Let's double-check the priority.

In the AMT system, the order of treatment is:

1. Dividends (first)
2. Capital Gains (second)
3. The percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis (third)
4. Then, other items like the special elections of the CFE, the interest deduction, itemized deductions, etc.

But in the question, the percentage depletion is given, so that is a separate item.

So, the items are: Dividends ($10k), Capital Gains ($15k), Percentage Depletion ($9k).

Adding them together, 10 +15=25, plus 9 is 34k. So the total is $34,000, which is option I.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is 34,000. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, I might have confused the order, but I think the order is correct here. So the answer should be I.

To determine West's AMT tax preference items, we need to consider the order of treatment as per the AMT system. The items are ordered as follows:

1. **Dividends** (first): $10,000
2. **Capital Gains** (second): $15,000
3. **Percentage Depletion** (third): $9,000

Each of these items is treated as a separate tax preference. Adding them together:

- Dividends: $10,000
- Capital Gains: $15,000
- Percentage Depletion: $9,000

Total tax preference items = $10,000 + $15,000 + $9,000 = $34,000.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: $34,000**.
