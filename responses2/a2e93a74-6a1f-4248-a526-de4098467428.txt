Okay, so I've got this linear algebra problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about vector spaces of real polynomials. The vector space V consists of all real polynomials of degree at most 3. So that should be the space of polynomials of degree 3 or less. I remember that the dimension of such a space is 4 because the basis would be {1, x, x², x³}. So dim V is 4.

Now, W is a subspace of V. W consists of all polynomials p(x) in V such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. So these are polynomials that vanish at x=0, x=1, and x=-1. I need to find dim W.

I think I can model this using polynomial interpolation. Since a polynomial of degree at most 3 is determined by its coefficients, and here the polynomial must pass through three points: x=0, x=1, and x=-1.

Wait, but a degree 3 polynomial is determined by 4 coefficients, but here we have constraints at three points. So the number of constraints is three. So, does that mean the dimension of W is 3 - 3 = 0? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, another approach: any polynomial in W must satisfy p(0)=0, p(1)=0, and p(-1)=0. So let's think about what that implies. Let's write p(x) as a general polynomial: p(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Now, applying the zero conditions:

At x=0: p(0) = d = 0. So d must be zero.

At x=1: p(1) = a + b + c + d = 0. Since d=0, this simplifies to a + b + c = 0.

At x=-1: p(-1) = -a + b - c + d = 0. Again, d=0, so -a + b - c = 0.

So now, I have two equations:

1) a + b + c = 0
2) -a + b - c = 0

Let me solve these. If I add equation 1 and equation 2, I get:

( a - a ) + (b + b) + (c - c) = 0 + 0 → 0 + 2b + 0 = 0 → 2b = 0 → b=0.

Then, substituting b=0 into equation 1: a + 0 + c = 0 → a + c = 0 → c = -a.

So the polynomial p(x) can be written as ax³ + 0x² + (-a)x + 0 = a(x³ - x).

So any polynomial in W is a multiple of x³ - x. Therefore, the dimension of W is 1 because the basis is {x³ - x}.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because a general polynomial would be p(x) = a x³ + b x² + c x + d, but with the constraints d=0, a + b + c=0, and -a + b - c=0. As I did earlier, we found that b must be 0, and c must be -a. So yes, the basis is {x³ - x}, so dim W is 1.

So now, dim V is 4, dim W is 1. The question asks for dim V + dim W, which is 4 + 1 = 5.

Looking at the options, option G is 5. So the answer should be G.

To determine the dimension of \( W \), we analyze the constraints on the polynomial \( p(x) \). Since \( p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 \), we substitute these values into the general form \( p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \):

- \( p(0) = d = 0 \) implies \( d = 0 \).
- \( p(1) = a + b + c + d = a + b + c = 0 \).
- \( p(-1) = -a + b - c + d = -a + b - c = 0 \).

Solving these equations, we find \( b = 0 \) and \( c = -a \). Thus, the polynomials in \( W \) are of the form \( p(x) = a(x^3 - x) \), indicating that the dimension of \( W \) is 1.

Adding the dimensions:  
dim \( V \) + dim \( W \) = 4 + 1 = 5.
