Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about the dissociation of hydrogen gas. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that hydrogen gas will dissociate into atoms at a high enough temperature. Specifically, H₂ dissociates into 2H. So, the reaction is H₂ ↔ 2H. The question states that 33% of the hydrogen is dissociated. The temperature is 2000°C, and the pressure is 1 atm. I need to find the density of hydrogen under these conditions. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, okay. Density is mass per unit volume. So I think I need to find the molar mass and the number of moles, then relate that to the density. But wait, the gas is dissociating, so I can't just assume the total moles are the same as the initial moles. I'll have to adjust for the change in moles due to dissociation.

Wait, so when H₂ dissociates into 2H, the total moles change. Let me think about that. Let's say the initial hydrogen is pure H₂. At 33% dissociation, 33% of the H₂ converts into 2H. So, the initial moles of H₂ is, let's say, n. The dissociation would produce n*(0.33) moles of H₂ that break down and 2*(0.33)n moles of H.

Wait, no, maybe I should consider the initial moles and the moles after dissociation. Let me get this straight. Let’s assume that before dissociation, the moles of H₂ is 1 mole because it's being compared to the density. But wait, when it dissociates, H₂ becomes 2H. So, the moles of atoms would change.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the ideal gas law in terms of moles. Let me think about the total moles after dissociation.

Let’s define the initial moles of H₂ as 1 mole. After dissociation, 33% of it dissociates. So, the moles of H₂ that dissociate is 0.33 moles, and the moles of H₂ remaining is 0.67 moles. But each H₂ molecule that dissociates produces two H atoms. So, the moles of H atoms produced from dissociation would be 0.33 * 2 = 0.66 moles.

Wait, but the total moles after dissociation would be the moles of H₂ remaining plus the moles of H formed. So, 0.67 + 0.66 = 1.33 moles. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each H₂ molecule becomes two H atoms. Oh wait, no, each H₂ would give two atoms. So, the moles of atoms would be 0.67 (unreacted H₂) plus 0.66 (from dissociation), making 1.33 moles of atoms total.

Wait, but wait, the actual problem is about the density of the dissociated gas. So, perhaps I should find the number of moles of atoms, and then find the density based on that.

Wait, but the question says, what should be the density of hydrogen at 2000°C and 1 atm? So, perhaps we're considering the density of the gaseous hydrogen, which has dissociated into atoms. So, the moles are based on the atoms.

So, let's approach it as:

After dissociation, the total moles of atoms is:

Moles of H₂ that dissociate: 0.33 moles → each produces 2 H atoms → 0.66 moles.

Moles of unreacted H₂: 0.67 moles.

Total moles of atoms: 0.67 + 0.66 = 1.33 moles.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The total moles are H₂ (0.67) plus H (0.66). So 1.33 moles. But the molar mass of hydrogen is 2 g/mol. So the mass would be moles × molar mass. But wait, wait a second: each mole of H₂ dissociates into 2 moles of H. So, perhaps the mass of the system is the same because the mass of H₂ is the same as the mass of 2 moles of H.

Wait, since H₂ is made of 2 H atoms, the mass of H₂ is the same as the mass of 2 moles of H. So when H₂ dissociates into 2 H, the total mass remains the same. So, the total moles after dissociation would be the same as the initial moles of H₂, but considering the atoms.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Wait, if the hydrogen is dissociated into atoms, the number of moles increases because each molecule produces more atoms. So, the total moles after dissociation is higher.

Wait, let me think in terms of moles. The initial moles of H₂ is 1 mole. Each H₂ molecule dissociates into 2 H atoms. So, for each mole of H₂ that dissociates, the moles of atoms increase by 1 (since 1 mole of H₂ gives 2 moles of H).

So, for 0.33 moles of H₂ dissociating, we get 0.33 * 2 = 0.66 moles of H atoms. So, the total moles now are 0.67 (unreacted H₂) + 0.66 (dissociated H) = 1.33 moles.

Wait, but the total mass is what? Initially, 1 mole of H₂ is 2 g. After dissociation, 1.33 moles of atoms, each H is 1 g/mol. So, mass is 1.33 g.

Wait, so the mass is 1.33 g, and the volume is 1 mole (since we assumed initial moles were 1 mole). But wait, no. Because pressure is 1 atm, and temperature is 2000°C (which is 1973 K, I think). Wait, but for ideal gases, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But when you have a mixture of ideal gases, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures. But in this case, the system is a mixture of H₂ and the dissociated atoms. But wait, the problem says "assuming ideal gas behavior for H₂ and H", which I think refers to their individual ideal gases. So, the total pressure is just the sum of the partial pressures.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the ideal gas law for the entire system. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of moles. Let's try that.

So, initial moles of H₂: 1 mole.

After dissociation, moles of H₂: 0.67 mol.

Moles of H atoms: 0.33 * 2 = 0.66 mol.

So total moles = 0.67 + 0.66 = 1.33 mol.

But wait, the question is about the density. Density (d) is mass over volume.

But the volume is given by the ideal gas law. Since pressure is 1 atm, and temperature is 2000 K, but I need to find the volume and then the density.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to find the number of moles in terms of the total pressure and volume, then calculate the density based on the mass.

Wait, the system is in a container. The initial moles are 1, but after dissociation, the moles are 1.33. But the pressure is 1 atm, and the temperature is 2000 K.

Wait, no, because the problem says the pressure is 1 atm. Wait, but the hydrogen dissociates and adds more moles. But the pressure is still 1 atm because it's the same container. So, the total pressure is 1 atm, which is due to the ideal gases in the container.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the ideal gas law for the entire system. The total pressure is 1 atm, and temperature is 2000 K.

Wait, but I need to find the number of moles, but given that the pressure is 1 atm and volume is determined by the ideal gas law. Hmm, maybe I should compute the total moles first.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try another approach.

The problem says to find the density of the hydrogen gas. Let's think about the number of moles of atoms.

Wait, the initial moles (before dissociation) are 1 mole H₂ → 2 moles H. So, 2 moles of atoms.

After dissociation, 0.67 moles H₂ → 1.34 moles H₂ (but wait, 0.67 is 2/3 of the original moles). And 0.33 moles H₂ → 0.66 moles H atoms.

So, the total moles of atoms is 0.67 + 0.66 = 1.33 moles.

Wait, but each mole of H₂ corresponds to 2 moles of atoms. So, the total moles of atoms is 1.33, which is 0.67 * 2 + 0.66 = 1.33. So that's correct.

So, the total moles of atoms is 1.33. Therefore, the mass of the system in terms of atoms is 1.33 * 1 g/mol = 1.33 g.

Wait, but wait. The system is made up of H₂ and dissociated H atoms, but when considering ideal gases, the pressure and temperature are given, so the volume is determined by the ideal gas law.

So, the ideal gas law equation is PV = nRT. We have P = 1 atm, T = 2000 K, and V is the volume.

But wait, the problem is about the density. So, density is mass over volume. The mass is 1.33 g, but wait, that's the mass of the atoms. Or is it the mass of the H₂ and the dissociated H? No, because the mass of the system is the same: 1.33 g. Because when H₂ dissociates into H atoms, the mass remains the same. So, the mass is 1.33 g.

Wait, but then the volume is found from the ideal gas law. Let me calculate V.

So, PV = nRT → V = nRT/P.

But wait, what is R? The gas constant. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So, n is 1.33 moles.

T is 2000 K.

P is 1 atm.

V = (1.33 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * 2000 K) / (1 atm)

Let me compute that:

1.33 * 0.0821 = approx 0.108773.

Multiply by 2000: 0.108773 * 2000 = 217.546 L.

So, volume V is approximately 217.546 liters.

Now, density is mass / volume → 1.33 g / 217.546 L ≈ 0.00613 g/L.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 0.001 to 0.010 scale. Wait, 0.006 is 6e-3 g/L. But looking at the options, the options are in 1e-3 and 1e-3 scale.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume the initial moles. Because the problem says, "the density of hydrogen at 2000°C if it is 33% dissociated into atoms." So, perhaps we should consider the number of moles of atoms instead.

Wait, let me think differently. The problem says, the hydrogen is dissociated into atoms. So, the hydrogen is split into H atoms.

So, initial moles of H₂: 1 mole → 2 moles H atoms.

After dissociation, 33% of that dissociates. So, 0.33 moles H₂ → 0.66 moles H atoms.

The remaining H₂ is 0.67 moles → 0.67 * 2 = 1.34 moles H atoms.

So, total moles of H atoms: 0.66 + 1.34 = 2.00 moles.

Wait, no, wait: 0.67 moles of H₂ is 1.34 moles of H atoms (since each molecule gives 2). Plus 0.33 * 2 = 0.66 moles H. So total moles = 1.34 + 0.66 = 2.00 moles.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1 mole H₂ dissociates to 2 moles H. So, 1 mole → 2 moles. 0.33 → 0.66. So, 1.33 (unreacted H₂) × 2 = 2.66 H atoms. Plus 0.33 × 2 = 0.66. So, 2.66 + 0.66 = 3.32? That doesn't make sense. Wait, I must be getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles. Let me think of it this way: the initial moles are 1 mole of H₂. When 33% dissociates, the moles of H₂ that dissociate is 0.33 * 1 = 0.33 moles. Each of these produces 2 H atoms, so moles of H atoms from dissociation is 0.33 * 2 = 0.66.

The moles of H₂ remaining is 0.67 moles. So, total moles of atoms is 0.67 + 0.66 = 1.33 moles.

Wait, but wait—each mole of H₂ gives 2 moles of H atoms. So, the H atoms come from the dissociation of H₂. So, the total moles of atoms are 1.33.

But the problem is about the density of the hydrogen at 2000°C. So, the mass of the system is the same as the moles of H₂ and H atoms multiplied by their molar masses. Wait, but H₂ is 24 g/mol (2 H atoms). When it dissociates, the mass remains the same.

Wait, but the mass of the system is the same as the initial mass (since it's the same gas). Initial mass is 2 g per mole (H₂). After dissociation, the mass is the same, but expressed in terms of atoms: 2 moles of H is 2 g.

Wait, so the mass is 2 grams, regardless of dissociation. But wait, that would imply that the mass doesn't change, which is correct because the mass is conserved when H₂ dissociates into atoms (as the same electrons and protons remain).

So, the mass of the system is 2 grams.

Wait, but wait a second. Suppose initial moles of H₂ is n. After dissociation, n × 2 is the moles of H atoms. But the total moles (n + moles of H atoms) is n + 2n = 3n → no, that can't be right. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of moles of atoms, considering the dissociation. Because the problem says 33% dissociation, so the moles of H₂ that have dissociated is 0.33 * initial moles.

Wait, let's let the initial moles of H₂ be 1 mole. So, after dissociation, 0.33 moles of H₂ dissociate into 2 moles of H each, so 0.33 * 2 = 0.66 moles H atoms. The remaining H₂ is 0.67 moles. So, total moles of atoms is 0.67 + 0.66 = 1.33 moles.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 0.67 H₂ is 1.34 moles of H atoms (each H₂ is 2 H atoms). So 0.67 H₂ × 2 = 1.34 H atoms. Plus 0.33 H atoms from dissociation. Total H atoms: 1.34 + 0.33 = 1.67?

Wait, no, 0.33 moles of H₂ dissociate into 0.66 moles H. So, the H atoms from dissociation: 0.66. The remaining H₂ is 0.67, which is 1.34 H atoms. So, total H atoms: 1.34 + 0.66 = 2.00 moles.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the total is 2.00 moles. So, the mass of the system is 2.00 moles × 2 g/mol = 4.00 g? No, wait: H₂ is 2 g/mol. So, 1 mole H₂ is 2 g. So, when 1 mole H₂ dissociates, it makes 2 moles H, which is 2 g. So, the mass remains the same. So, mass of system is 2 grams.

Wait, but that would mean the density is 2 g / (volume in liters). So, I need to find the volume using the ideal gas law.

So, PV = nRT → V = nRT/P.

n is 2.00 moles, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T is 2000 K, P is 1 atm.

V = 2 * 0.0821 * 2000 / 1 = (2 * 0.0821) = 0.1642; 0.1642 * 2000 = 328.4 L.

So, the volume is 328.4 L.

Density = mass / volume = 2.00 g / 328.4 L ≈ 0.0061 g/L.

Wait, but the options are in the range of 0.001 to 0.010. But 0.006 is 6e-3, which is an option? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 6.07e-3 g/L

B) 6.57e-3 g/L

C) 6.97e-3 g/L

D) 7.37e-3 g/L

E) 7.77e-3 g/L.

Wait, 0.0061 is approximately 6.1e-3, which is option A: 6.07e-3. So, the answer would be A. But wait, I'm getting 6.1e-3, which is 0.0061, which is 6.1e-3, which is option A, which is 6.07e-3. So, the closest value is option A.

But wait, in my earlier approach, I assumed that the mass is 2 g, and the volume is 328.4 L, leading to density of about 0.0061 g/L. But 0.006 is 6e-3, which is 6.0e-3, which is option A.

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the volume. Let me recalculate the volume.

n = 2.00 mol

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

T = 2000 K

P = 1 atm.

V = (2.00) * (0.0821) * 2000 / (1)

Compute:

2.00 * 0.0821 = 0.1642

0.1642 * 2000 = 328.4 L.

Yes, correct.

So, density = 2.00 g / 328.4 L ≈ 0.0061 g/L.

Which is 6.1e-3 g/L, approximately 6.1e-3. The options are:

A) 6.07e-3

B) 6.57e-3

So, 6.1e-3 is closest to option A at 6.07e-3.

So, the answer should be A.

Wait, but another approach: maybe using the number of moles of atoms.

Wait, the number of moles of atoms after dissociation is 2.00 moles.

So, the mass of the system is 2.00 g.

But the volume is 328.4 L.

Density is 2.00 g / 328.4 L ≈ 0.0061 g/L.

Same result.

So, the answer is A.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Maybe I should consider the dissociation as H₂ dissociating into atoms, so the number of atoms is 2 per mole of H₂. So, the number of moles of atoms is 2 per mole of H₂. So, 2 * n_initial = 2 * 1 = 2 moles.

Wait, but earlier, I considered that after dissociation, the moles of H₂ is 0.67 and moles of H is 0.66, so the total moles is 1.33, which is 2 moles of H atoms. Wait, but that can't be right because each mole of H₂ gives 2 moles of H atoms.

So, from 1 mole H₂, 2 moles H atoms.

After dissociation, 0.67 H₂ → 1.34 H atoms.

And 0.33 H₂ dissociates → 0.66 H atoms.

So, total moles of H atoms is 1.34 + 0.66 = 2.00.

So, the mass of the system is 2.00 g.

So, the volume is (nRT)/P = (2 * 0.0821 * 2000) / 1 = (328.4) L.

Density is 2.00 g / 328.4 L = 0.0061 g/L, which is 6.1e-3 g/L.

So, the closest option is A) 6.07e-3 g/L.

Therefore, the answer is A.
</think>

To determine the density of hydrogen gas at 2000°C, 33% dissociated into atoms, and 1 atm pressure, we proceed as follows:

### Key Steps:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Assume 1 mole of H₂ dissociates into atoms.
   - After dissociation, 0.33 moles of H₂ dissociate into 0.66 moles of H atoms.
   - Remaining H₂: 1 - 0.33 = 0.67 moles, contributing 1.34 moles of H atoms.
   - Total moles of atoms: 0.66 (dissociated H) + 1.34 (unreacted H) = 2.00 moles.

2. **Mass of the System**:
   - The mass of the system is the same as the mass of H₂, which is 2.00 g.

3. **Ideal Gas Law for Volume**:
   - Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), solve for volume \( V \):
     \[
     V = \frac{nRT}{P}
     \]
     Substituting \( n = 2.00 \, \text{mol} \), \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), \( T = 2000 \, \text{K} \), and \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \):
     \[
     V = \frac{2.00 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 2000}{1} = 328.4 \, \text{L}.
     \]

4. **Density Calculation**:
   - Density \( \rho \) is mass divided by volume:
     \[
     \rho = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{2.00 \, \text{g}}{328.4 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0061 \, \text{g/L}.
     \]
   - Converting to scientific notation: \( 0.0061 = 6.1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/L} \).

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The closest option to \( 6.1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/L} \) is **A) 6.07 × 10⁻³ g/L**.
