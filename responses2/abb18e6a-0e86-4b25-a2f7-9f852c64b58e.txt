Okay, so I've got this insurance question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about calculating how much a policy would pay under different deductibles. Specifically, when an accident causes a repair bill, we need to compare two policies: one with a 100-deductible and another with a 50-deductible. 

Let's break down the problem. The first scenario is a $100 deductible. The repair bill is $89.90. The second scenario is a $50 deductible with the same $76.40 bill.

Hmm, I remember that the deductible is the amount the insurance company will pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the rest. So, if the repair bill is less than or equal to the deductible, the policyholder pays the entire amount. But if it's higher, the insurance covers the amount over the deductible, and the policyholder covers the rest.

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's the other way around. Let me think again. The deductible is the amount you pay before the insurance company starts covering. So, if the bill is under the deductible, you pay it all. If it's over, the insurance pays the difference, and you pay the rest.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. For example, if the bill is $50 and the deductible is $50, then the policyholder pays the entire $50, and the insurance doesn't cover anything because the bill is within the deductible. But if the bill is $60 and the deductible is $50, then the insurance would cover $10 (since 60 -50=10), and the policy pays 50.

Wait, no, that's not correct because in the first case, the policy would pay the $50, and the policyholder would pay $10. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me rephrase:

Under a deductible policy, the insurance company covers the first 'deductible' amount, and you pay the rest. So, if the bill is less than or equal to the deductible, the policyholder pays the entire amount. If it's above, the insurance covers up to the deductible, and the policy pays the rest (the amount above the deductible plus the part that's beyond the deductible? Wait, no, I'm getting confused here.)

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as: the policyholder pays the first part, and the insurance covers up to the deductible. Or is it that the policyholder pays the first 'deductible' amount, and the insurance covers the rest. Let me think with an example.

Suppose the bill is $100 and the deductible is $50. Then, the policyholder would pay $50, and the insurance would pay $50 (the rest). Wait, no, that can't be right because the bill is $100 so $50 is the deductible. So, the policyholder would pay $50 (the deductible), and the insurance would pay $50 (the amount over $50). So, total paid by policyholder is $50, insurance $50. 

Wait, that doesn't add up because $50 (deductible) plus $50 (covered) equals $100, which is the bill. So, the policyholder pays $50, and the insurance pays $50. That makes sense.

Wait, but that's when the bill is exactly the deductible. So, in any case, if the bill is above the deductible, the policyholder is responsible for paying the deductible, and the insurance pays the rest. Or wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me make sure.

Let me think of the formula: For a given bill amount, the amount the policy covers is the minimum between the bill and the deductible. The policyholder pays the rest. Alternatively, the policy pays the deductible if the bill is higher, but I'm getting myself confused. 

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is: the policyholder pays the first 'deductible' amount, and the insurance covers the rest up to the deductible. Wait, no, that's not right because the policyholder would pay the first part, and the insurance covers the rest.

Alternatively, perhaps the policy is structured so that the policyholder pays the deductible, and the insurance covers the rest of the bill beyond the deductible. Wait, let me think of an example: if the bill is $89.90 and the deductible is $100. Since $89.90 is less than $100, the policyholder must pay the entire $89.90, and the insurance doesn't cover anything. So, the policy pays nothing, and the policyholder pays $89.90.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in reality, the policyholder would pay the deductible if it's less than the deductible. So, if the bill is $89.90 and the deductible is $100, the policyholder would pay $89.90, and the insurance would cover the rest, which is none because the bill is under the deductible. So, the policy would not pay anything against the insurance. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: the deductible is the amount the policyholder pays before the insurance company starts covering. So, if the bill is $89.90 and the deductible is $100, the policyholder would pay $89.90 entirely, because it's less than the deductible. The insurance doesn't cover anything because they only pay when the bill exceeds the deductible.

Wait, but in that case, the policy would receive the full $89.90, and the insurance would pay nothing. So, the policy pays $0, and the policyholder pays $89.90. That would be the first scenario.

Wait, but the question says, "how much would a 100-deductible policy pay on an accident causing a repair bill of $89.90." So, I'm getting confused between the two policies.

Wait, the question is asking for the amount the policy would pay on each. So, for the first scenario, the policy is 100-deductible. The bill is $89.90. The policy would pay the minimum between the bill and the deductible. But since the bill is less than the deductible, the policy would pay $89.90, and the policyholder pays the rest.

Wait, no. Because the policy would pay the amount up to the deductible. So, if the bill is less than the deductible, the policy company covers the entire bill. So, the policy would pay nothing, and the policyholder would pay the full $89.90. So, the policy pays $0, and the policyholder pays $89.90.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "how much would a 100-deductible collision policy pay on an accident causing a repair bill of $89.90." So, the question is asking how much the policy would pay, which would be $0, because the bill is below the deductible. Wait, but wait, the question says, how much would the policy pay. That would be the amount the policy pays, which is the minimum of the bill and the deductible. So, since $89.90 is less than $100, the policy covers the bill, so the policy pays $89.90, and the policyholder pays nothing. Wait, no, because the policy is the one paying the minimum of the bill and the deductible. So, the policy would pay the bill, but only if the bill is above the deductible. Oh wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Let me think of it like this: the policy's coverage is up to the deductible. So, if the bill is $89.90 and the deductible is $100, the policy would cover the entire bill because it's below the deductible. So, the policy would pay $89.90, and the policyholder doesn't pay anything. So, the policy's payment is $89.90, and the policyholder's payment is $0.

Wait, but the question is asking how much the policy would pay. So, the policy would receive $89.90, and the policyholder would pay the rest, which is $0. So, the policy would pay $89.90, and the policyholder would pay $0.

Wait, but the question is phrased as, "how much would a 100-deductible collision policy pay on an accident...", so the amount the policy would pay is the amount the policy covers. So, if the bill is less than the deductible, the policy pays the bill, so the policy pays $89.90, and the policyholder pays $0. So, policy pays $89.90.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me think again. Let's take the first case: 100-deductible, bill $89.90. The policy would pay the full amount because the bill is below the deductible. So, the policy would pay $89.90, and the policyholder pays nothing. So, the policy's payment is $89.90, and the policyholder's is $0.

Wait, but the question is asking, "how much would the policy pay". So, the policy's payment is $89.90. So, for the first situation, the 100-deductible policy pays $89.90.

Now, the second scenario is a 50-deductible policy on a bill of $76.40. Let's apply the same logic.

Since the bill is $76.40 and the deductible is $50, the policyholder would pay the first $50, and the insurance would cover the remaining $26.40.

Wait, no, because the bill is $76.40, which is above the deductible. So, the policyholder would pay the first $50, and the insurance would pay up to $50 on top of that, so the total covered by the policy is $50, and the rest is covered by the insurance. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it backwards.

Wait, the policy pays the minimum of the bill and the deductible. So, for the second scenario, the bill is $76.40, the deductible is $50. So, the policy would pay the minimum of $50 and $76.40, which is $50. But wait, no, the policy's payment is the amount they cover. So, the policy is the one who pays up to the deductible. So, the policy would cover the first $50 of the bill, and the rest is covered by the insurance. So, the policy's payment is $50, and the insurance's payment is the rest of the bill beyond $50: $76.40 - $50 = $26.40.

So, the policy (the 50-deductible) would pay $50. The policyholder pays $76.40 - $50 = $26.40.

Wait, but the question is asking, how much would the policy pay. So, the policy would pay $50, and the policyholder would pay $26.40.

Wait, but let me think again for the second case: the bill is $76.40. The 50-deductible policy would pay up to $50. So, the policy pays $50, and the rest ($26.40) is covered by the insurance.

So, the policy would pay $50, and the policyholder would pay $26.40.

Wait, but the original question is, for the 50-deductible policy, the amount the policy pays is $50, and the policyholder pays the rest, which is $26.40. So, the policy pays $50, policyholder pays $26.40.

Wait, but wait, let me look again at the options. The options are about how much each policy would pay.

So, for the first scenario, the 100-deductible policy:

- Policy pays $89.90 (because the bill is less than the deductible)
- Policyholder pays $0

For the second scenario, the 50-deductible policy:

- Policy pays $50
- Policyholder pays $26.40

So, looking at the options:

Option A: 0 and $26.40
B: 10.10 and 0
C: 0 and 76.40
D: 89.90 and 76.40
E: 39.90 and 26.40
F: 100 and 50
G: 10.10 and 26.40
H:89.90 and 50
I:0 and50
J:89.90 and 0

Wait, in the options, the first part is what the 100-deductible policy pays, the second part is what the 50-deductible pays. So, for the first case, the 100-deductible pays $89.90, and the 50-deductible pays $50.

Looking at the options, looking for the first part being $89.90 and the second part being $50.

Looking at the options:

Option H says: 89.90 and 50. So, that's 100-deductible pays 89.90, 50-deductible pays 50. So, that would match.

But wait, let me check the options again to make sure. Let me go through the options.

Looking for:

100-deductible: $89.90 (so option H and J have 89.90 for the first part)

50-deductible: $50 (which is option H and G have 50)

So, option H: 100-deductible pays 89.90, 50-deductible pays 50.

So, the answer should be H.

Wait, but earlier, I thought for the 50-deductible, the policy (50-deductible) would pay $50. But let me think again.

Wait, when the bill is $76.40 and deductible is $50, the policy would pay $50, and the insurance would pay the remaining. So, total paid by the policy is $50, policyholder $26.40.

So, the 100-deductible's payment is 89.90 (it paid the entire bill because the deductible was higher), and the 50-deductible's payment is 50.

So, the correct option is H: 100-deductible pays 89.90, 50-deductible pays 50.

To determine how much each policy would pay under the given scenarios, we analyze the deductibles and bill amounts:

1. **100-Deductible Policy (Bill: $89.90):**
   - The policyholder pays the full amount if the bill is below the deductible. Since $89.90 < $100, the policy pays nothing.
   - **Policy payment:** $0

2. **50-Deductible Policy (Bill: $76.40):**
   - The policyholder pays the first $50 (the deductible). The remaining $26.40 is covered by the insurance.
   - **Policy payment:** $50

Thus, the 100-deductible policy pays $0, and the 50-deductible policy pays $50.

**Correct answer:** H: $0 and $50.
