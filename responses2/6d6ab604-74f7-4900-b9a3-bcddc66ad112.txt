Question:

Describe Sherman's and Key's (1932) study of the Hollow Children. What do their findings indicate about the effect of environment on intellectual development?

Options:

A: The study found no significant findings
B: Environment has no effect on intellectual development
C: The study shows that a deprived environment only affects intellectual development until a certain age
D: The study concluded that intellectual development is solely determined by genetics, not environment
E: The findings indicate that a stimulating environment has no impact on intellectual development
F: Sherman and Key's study indicates that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development
G: The research indicates that changes in the environment can reverse any prior intellectual development deficits
H: A deprived environment enhances intellectual development
I: Sherman and Key's research suggests that intellectual development is primarily influenced by peer interactions, not environment
J: Sherman and Key found that intellectual development is equally impacted by both deprived and enriched environments

Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about Sherman and Key's 1932 study on the Hollow Children. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Sherman and Key were a group of researchers involved in the development of the curriculum theory. They were working on understanding how environment affects intellectual development. The Hollow Children, I think, are a set of children from different socioeconomic backgrounds who were exposed to different environments over time. The study aimed to see how these different environments impacted the children's intellectual development.

From what I recall, the Hollow Children were divided into three groups: one from a high-income area, one from a middle-income, and one from a low-income area. The low-income group was particularly concerned about their intellectual development because they had fewer resources. 

So, their study looked at the IQ scores of these children over time. The results from their study would suggest whether the environment had an impact on intellectual development. I think that the key finding was that the children from poorer environments showed less improvement in their IQ scores compared to those from more prosperous environments. That would mean that the environment had a negative effect on intellectual development for those from low-income backgrounds.

Looking at the options, option E says that the study concluded intellectual development is solely determined by genetics, not environment. That doesn't fit because I remember the Hollow Children showing a negative impact of the environment. So this isn't E.

Option F says it indicated a deprived environment has a detrimental effect. That sounds familiar. If the low-income group's IQ didn't improve as much as others, they might have shown a negative effect. So F might be correct.

Option G says the environment enhances development. That's the opposite of what I remember, so I don't think G is right.

Option H says the environment enhances, which again contradicts my understanding, so H is probably not correct.

Option I says peer interactions are more influential. I don't think so; the Hollow Children were exposed to different environments, not just peers.

Option J says both environments have an equal impact. But I thought low-income kids had a worse effect, so J doesn't fit.

Option B says environment has no effect. That's the opposite of what the Hollow Children's study showed, so B is probably incorrect.

Option C suggests a deprived environment only affects until a certain age. I don't think that's what the study found. It's more about the overall effect and whether it's consistent across all children.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be F, which says the study found that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development.

The correct answer is F: Sherman and Key's study indicated that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development.

Answer: F
