Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the percentage of Brazil's population that identifies homosexuality as something society should accept. Hmm, I remember hearing that the majority of professionals in Brazil are hetero, but I'm not sure about the percentage of the general population. Let me think. I think Brazil has a pretty diverse population, with a mix of socioeconomic factors. Maybe about 60%? But I'm not certain. Wait, I think I've heard that a significant portion is hetero, maybe around 60-70%. Oh, but the question is about the percentage that says it should be accepted. I think it's a high percentage because they're already hetero. So the answer might be around 67%, which is option A. Or maybe it's lower because not everyone supports it. I'm a bit confused, but I'm leaning towards A.
