Okay, so I've got this question about a corporation and its income statement. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is about calculating the dividends declared in two different tax rates: 48% and 45%. The given data is a bit detailed, so I need to take it apart.

First, let's list out all the information provided:

- Sales: $3,000,000
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $1,500,000
- Administrative Expenses: $300,000
- Depreciation: $800,000
- Other Expenses: $100,000
- Retained Earnings: $100,000
- Tax rate 1: 48%
- Tax rate 2: 45%

We're supposed to find out the dividend declared in each case.

Wait, wait. Retained earnings are part of the equity. So, if the corporation has retained earnings, that means they haven't paid out dividends yet. The retained earnings would be the accumulated profit after paying dividends and taxes. Hmm, but in this case, the retained earnings are $100k, which is the amount not distributed as dividends or kept as profits.

Wait, no. Let me think. The definition of retained earnings is the portion of net income not distributed to shareholders as dividends. So, if the company's net income is higher than the retained earnings, that means they've paid out some dividends. So, perhaps the retained earnings is part of the net income calculation.

So, the steps I think are:

1. Calculate the total income before tax (EBIT) by subtracting the costs from sales. Wait, no. Let's see. The question gives the expenses, so perhaps we need to first compute the gross profit, but I don't think so. Maybe we're given all the other expenses as part of the cost of goods sold or not? Wait, the question lists COGS, administrative expenses, depreciation, other expenses, and retained earnings.

Wait, the question says: "sales in year 197X amount to $3,000,000; the cost of goods sold is $1,500,000; administrative ex-penses are $300,000; depreciation $800,000; all other ex-penses are $100,000; retained earnings are $100,000;"

Wait, so I think that the expenses are part of the operating expenses. So, the total operating expenses would be COGS + administrative + depreciation + other. Let me sum that up.

COGS = 1,500,000

Administrative: 300,000

Depreciation: 800,000

Other: 100,000

So total operating expenses are 1,500,000 + 300,000 + 800,000 + 100,000.

Let me add that up: 1.5M + 0.3M is 1.8M, plus 0.8M is 2.6M, plus 0.1M is 2.7M. So, $2,700,000 in operating expenses.

Then, the sales are $3,000,000, so operating income (EBIT) would be sales minus operating expenses.

So EBIT = 3,000,000 - 2,700,000 = 300,000.

Wait, but what about the other parts of the income statement?

Wait, the question also gives administrative expenses as $300k, depreciation as $800k, etc. Oh, wait, I think I'm mixing up things. Let me recheck:

The question says "the cost of goods sold is $1,500,000; administrative ex-penses are $300,000; depreciation $800,000; all other ex-penses are $100,000; retained earnings are $100,000."

So, the operating expenses include COGS, administrative, depreciation, and other. So, as I calculated before, 1.5M + 0.3M + 0.8M + 0.1M = 2.7M. So EBIT is 3M - 2.7M = 0.3M, or $300,000.

Then, are there other income or expenses? Let me see, the retained earnings are $100k. Retained earnings = net income - dividends paid, assuming that's the case. But wait, the company's net income would be EBIT minus other operating expenses, but wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about calculating the amount of dividend declared, given that the retained earnings are $100k. So, let me think about what the question is asking.

So, the question is, given the various expenses and the retained earnings, what was the dividend declared, and also what it would be if the tax rate dropped.

Hmm, so perhaps the total net income is calculated, then subtract retained earnings to find the dividends.

But wait, the retained earnings are the amount that wasn't distributed as dividends but was kept as net income. So, if the net income is greater than the retained earnings, the difference is the amount distributed as dividends.

Wait, so the formula would be: Dividends = Net Income - Retained Earnings.

But Net Income is calculated as (EBIT - operating expenses) multiplied by (1 - tax rate) + (tax on retained earnings). Wait, no, that might not be the case. Because in the case of dividends, the tax is on the earnings, but the retained earnings are the part that's not distributed as dividends, so perhaps the calculation is a bit more involved.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Net Income = (EBIT - operating expenses) * (1 - tax rate) + (tax on the retained earnings).

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think.

The company's net income before taxes is EBIT - OPEX. Then, taxes are calculated on that net income before taxes, and then subtracted from net income to get the net income available to shareholders, which is the retained earnings plus the dividends. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the retained earnings are part of the net income. So, the net income is equal to retained earnings plus the dividends. But that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for retained earnings is:

Retained Earnings = Net Income - Dividends Paid.

But Net Income is calculated as (EBIT - OPEX) * (1 - tax rate) + (tax on EBIT - OPEX). Wait, I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Calculate EBIT: Sales - COGS - operating expenses.

Wait, but COGS is part of the cost of goods sold, so EBIT would be:

EBIT = Sales - COGS - Administrative - Depreciation - Other.

Wait, but I think that's what I did earlier, and EBIT was $300k.

But then, the net income is EBIT minus taxes. So, Net Income = EBIT - (EBIT * tax rate). Then, retained earnings would be Net Income minus Dividends.

Wait, no. Because the tax is on the net income, but the retained earnings are the portion that's kept. So:

Retained Earnings = Net Income after taxes - Dividends.

Wait, no, because Dividends are paid out of net income. So, Net Income = Dividends + Retained Earnings. But Net Income is also equal to (EBIT - OPEX) * (1 - T) + (T * (EBIT - OPEX)) - (T * Dividends). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the net income before taxes, then adjust for taxes, then set up the equation.

So let's try this approach.

First, calculate EBIT: 3M - (1,500,000 + 300,000 + 800,000 + 100,000) = 3M - 2,700,000 = 300,000.

Wait, that's the same as before. So EBIT is $300,000.

Now, the tax rate is either 48% or 45%, so let's compute the net income before taxes first.

Tax rate 48%: 300,000 * 0.48 = 144,000.

Tax rate 45%: 300,000 * 0.45 = 135,000.

So, net income before taxes for 48% tax is 300k - 144k = 156,000.

Net income before taxes for 45% tax is 300k - 135k = 165,000.

Then, the retained earnings are the net income after taxes minus the dividends. So,

Retained Earnings = Net Income After Taxes - Dividends.

Rearranged, Dividends = Net Income After Taxes - Retained Earnings.

Wait, wait. Let me think: Net Income is (Net Income After Taxes) + Dividends.

Because Net Income is what's left after paying taxes, and the remaining part is what's distributed as dividends.

Wait, no. Wait, Net Income is what's available to both the company (through retained earnings and dividends). So, if Net Income is N, then N = Dividends + Retained Earnings.

So, for each case:

Case 1: Tax rate 48%:

Net Income After Taxes = 300k * (1 - 0.48) = 300k * 0.52 = 156,000.

So, Dividends1 = Net Income After Taxes - Retained Earnings.

Retained Earnings is 100k.

So, Dividends1 = 156,000 - 100,000 = 56,000.

Case 2: Tax rate 45%:

Net Income After Taxes = 300k * (1 - 0.45) = 300k * 0.55 = 165,000.

So, Dividends2 = 165,000 - 100,000 = 65,000.

Wait, that gives Dividends as $56,000 and $65,000 for the two tax rates.

Looking at the options, option C is $56,000 and $65,000. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

EBIT is $300k. For 48% tax:

Tax = 300k * 0.48 = 144,000.

Net Income After Taxes = 300k - 144k = 156,000.

Dividends = 156k - 100k = 56k.

For 45% tax:

Tax = 300k * 0.45 = 135,000.

Net Income After Taxes = 165k.

Dividends = 65k.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but the options are:

A: 58, 68

B:55,66

C:56,65

D:52,62

E:60,70

F:59,69

G:53,63

H:50,60

I:54,64

J:57,67

So option C is 56 and 65, which matches our calculation.

To determine the dividends declared, we first calculate the net income before taxes, then adjust for taxes, and finally use the retained earnings to find the dividends.

1. **Calculate EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes):**
   - Sales: $3,000,000  
   - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $1,500,000  
   - Administrative Expenses: $300,000  
   - Depreciation: $800,000  
   - Other Expenses: $100,000  
   - **EBIT = Sales - COGS - Administrative - Depreciation - Other**  
   - EBIT = $3,000,000 - $1,500,000 - $300,000 - $800,000 - $100,000 = **$300,000**.

2. **Calculate Net Income Before Taxes:**
   - **Tax Rate 1 (48%):**  
     - Taxes = EBIT × Tax Rate = $300,000 × 0.48 = **$144,000**.  
     - Net Income Before Taxes = EBIT - Taxes = $300,000 - $144,000 = **$156,000**.  
   - **Tax Rate 2 (45%):**  
     - Taxes = EBIT × Tax Rate = $300,000 × 0.45 = **$135,000**.  
     - Net Income Before Taxes = EBIT - Taxes = $300,000 - $135,000 = **$165,000**.

3. **Calculate Dividends Declared:**
   - **Retained Earnings = $100,000**.  
   - **Dividends = Net Income Before Taxes - Retained Earnings**  
     - For Tax Rate 1:  
       - Dividends = $156,000 - $100,000 = **$56,000**.  
     - For Tax Rate 2:  
       - Dividends = $165,000 - $100,000 = **$65,000**.

4. **Match the Results to the Options:**
   - Dividends for 48% tax: **$56,000**.  
   - Dividends for 45% tax: **$65,000**.  
   - Corresponding option: **C: $56,000 and $65,000**.

ANSWER: C
