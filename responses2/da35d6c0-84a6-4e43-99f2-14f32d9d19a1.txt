Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electric fields and charge distributions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that there's a charge distribution that's spherically symmetric but not uniform radially. The electric field E is given as K r⁴, directed radially outward. I need to find the volume charge density ρ. The options are labeled A through J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that for spherically symmetric charge distributions, Gauss's Law is really useful. Gauss's Law states that the flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by ε₀. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, where Φ is the electric flux.

In this case, since the electric field is E = K r⁴, and the distribution is spherically symmetric, the electric field should only depend on the radial distance r. That means for a Gaussian surface of radius r, the electric field is uniform across the surface, and the flux would be E * 4πr².

So applying Gauss's Law: E * 4πr² = Q_enc / ε₀.

Let me plug in the given E: (K r^4) * 4π r² = Q_enc / ε₀. Simplifying, that gives 4π K r^6 = Q_enc / ε₀. Solving for Q_enc, we get Q_enc = 4π K r^6 * ε₀.

But wait, Q_enc is the total charge inside radius r. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)π r³. So the charge density ρ would be Q_enc divided by the volume. That would be [4π K r^6 ε₀] / [(4/3)π r³ ].

Let me compute that. The 4π cancels out, so we have K r^6 ε₀ / ( (1/3) r³ ) = 3 K ε₀ r³.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the math. Q_enc is 4π K r^6 ε₀. Volume is (4/3) π r³. So ρ = (4π K r^6 ε₀) / ( (4/3) π r³ ) ) = (4π * K * r^6 * ε₀) * 3/(4π r³) ) = (3 K ε₀ r^3). Oh, wait, so that's 3 K ε₀ r³. Looking at the options, option I is 3 K ε₀ r³. So the answer should be option I.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes. Let's go through again.

E = K r^4.

Flux Φ = E * 4π r² = K r^4 *4π r² =4π K r^6.

This equals Q_enc / ε₀ → Q_enc =4π K r^6 ε₀.

Charge density ρ = Q_enc / Volume. Volume is (4/3) π r³.

So ρ = (4π K r^6 ε₀) / (4/3 π r³) ) = (4π * K r^6 ε₀) * (3/(4 π r³)) ). The π cancels, and 4 cancels with 4. So 3 K ε₀ r^6 / r³ =3 K ε₀ r^3. So yes, option I is 3K ε₀ r³. So the correct answer is option I.

To solve the problem, we use Gauss's Law, which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by ε₀. For a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is radial and depends only on the radial distance r. The given electric field is \( E = K r^4 \), and the Gaussian surface is a sphere of radius \( r \).

### Step 1: Apply Gauss's Law
The electric flux through the Gaussian surface is:
\[
\Phi = E \cdot 4\pi r^2 = K r^4 \cdot 4\pi r^2 = 4\pi K r^6.
\]
According to Gauss's Law:
\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}.
\]
Thus, the total charge enclosed within radius \( r \) is:
\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = 4\pi K r^6 \cdot \varepsilon_0.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Volume
The volume of a sphere is:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Charge Density
The volume charge density \( \rho \) is the total charge divided by the volume:
\[
\rho = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{V} = \frac{4\pi K r^6 \cdot \varepsilon_0}{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}.
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
\rho = \frac{4\pi K r^6 \cdot \varepsilon_0}{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3} = 3 K \varepsilon_0 r^3.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the Options
The calculated charge density \( \rho = 3 K \varepsilon_0 r^3 \) corresponds to **option I**.
