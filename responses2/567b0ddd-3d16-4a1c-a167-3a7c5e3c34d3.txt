Okay, so I've got this question about American football scoring, specifically about touchdowns. Hmm, I remember that touchdowns are a big part of the game. Let me think. In football, each touchdown is worth a certain number of points. I think touchdowns are worth 7 points each. But wait, I also recall something about extra points or field goals. Oh right, the extra point adds one more point, making it 8 in total. But the question is about the touchdown itself. So the main part is the touchdown itself, which is 7 points. 

Looking at the options, I see A is six, which doesn't sound right. B is ten, that's too high. C is one, too low. D is four, no. E is nine, not that. F is three. G is two. H is eight, which is the total including the extra point. I is five, not sure. J is seven. So the correct answer should be J: seven. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Sometimes in American football, touchdowns can also be worth two points if they're after a touchdown and a field goal, but that's the extra point. So the main touchdown is seven. So yeah, the answer is seven points.
