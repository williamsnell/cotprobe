Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this history question about the Shang Dynasty. Let's see. The question is asking about when the Shang Dynasty's civilization was fully developed and lasted into. The options are various centuries, from 5th to 21st. 

First, I remember that the Shang Dynasty, which is one of the earliest ancient Chinese dynasties, was established in the 16th century. The Shang is known for their technological achievements, like the青铜 age, which involved metalworking and the construction of cities. But when did their civilization really take off and spread?

I think the Shang were the first to establish a centralized government. They built cities like Shu, which were much bigger than the ones they inherited from the Shang Shui. The Shang also had a strong emphasis on agriculture, and their society was more organized and efficient than the neighboring Sushu period. 

The question mentions that the Shang completed their civilization into the 18th century. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The 18th century is a bit far back compared to the more modern ones. But historically, the Shang were the first to start a civilization and establish a government. So their civilization probably began in the 16th century and spread during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Looking at the options, option A is the 17th century, which seems right because the Shang were the first to do so. But wait, I thought the Shang didn't start spreading until the 18th century. So their civilization was completed in 18th century. But the question is asking when it lasted into. So the answer should be the 18th century. But wait, the options given don't have the 18th listed as a specific century. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:17th, B:14th, C:18th, D:21st, E:5th, F:13th, G:20th, H:8th, I:15th, J:10th.

So option C is 18th, but that's the century, not the specific year. Wait, perhaps the question is asking when their civilization was fully developed and into which century. So perhaps the Shang were the first to achieve this by the 18th century. So the answer would be that their civilization was completed into the 18th century. But looking at the options, C is 18th century. So the correct answer is C. Wait, but the options don't have the full 18th century as a choice. Wait, looking again, the options are each a single century. So the correct answer is that the Shang's civilization was completed by the 18th century, meaning it was completed in that century. But the options don't have a 18th century option as a single choice. Wait, no. Wait, the options are each a single century. So for example, option C is 18th century. So the correct answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased that the Shang's civilization was completed in the 18th century, so the answer is C.
