Question:

How are whales adapted for their life in cold waters?

Options:

A: Whales have a specialized gill system to regulate temperature.
B: Whales are cold-blooded and adjust their body temperature to the water temperature.
C: Whales have a thick fur coat to keep them warm.
D: Whales have a unique enzyme that prevents their body fluids from freezing.
E: Whales maintain a nearly constant internal body temperature and have a tremendous amount of subcutaneous fat serving an insulating function.
F: Whales possess an advanced circulatory system that directs warm blood to the skin surface.
G: Whales have expandable bladders that they fill with warm water to maintain body temperature.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer this question about whales and their adaptation to cold waters. Let's break it down.

The question asks about the adaptation whales have in cold waters. The options are A through G. I remember that whales are known for being hot-blooded, but I'm not sure how that applies here. They are cold-blooded, so option B says that. But wait, does that mean they adjust their body temp to the water temp? Or is it their circulatory system?

I think I remember something about their circulatory system. whales have a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, which is insulating. So they can regulate their body temperature by keeping it warm enough. That would be option E. Alternatively, if they don't adjust their body temp, maybe their circulatory system is more efficient. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Option C talks about a thick fur coat. I don't think whales have fur. They're mammals, but I don't recall that fur as a main adaptation. Maybe they use other methods, like regulating body temperature.

Option D says they have an enzyme to prevent fluids from freezing. Enzymes usually break down things or modify them, so I'm not sure how that would prevent fluids from freezing. Maybe if the enzymes are active, it could help in some way, but I don't think that's the main adaptation.

Option A is about gills regulating temperature. I don't recall gills being part of their body's temperature regulation. Maybe that's more for other species.

Option E says they maintain a constant internal temperature and have insulating subcutaneous fat. That sounds right because if their body is too warm, they might lose heat. Insulating means they keep the internal temp around 10-15Â°C, which is actually lower than sea temp. They do this by having a thick layer of fat, which is good for insulation.

Option F is about an advanced circulatory system directing heat to the skin. But I think the main way is the body temp regulation through their body fluids, not necessarily the circulatory system directing heat.

Option G is expandable bladders. I'm not sure about this. I think some mammals have expandable bladders, but whales might have other systems. Are they using bladders for regulating body temperature? I don't remember that.

So putting it all together, the most likely correct answer is E. whales maintain a constant internal body temperature and use subcutaneous fat for insulating.

The correct answer is E: whales maintain a nearly constant internal body temperature and have a tremendous amount of subcutaneous fat serving an insulating function.
