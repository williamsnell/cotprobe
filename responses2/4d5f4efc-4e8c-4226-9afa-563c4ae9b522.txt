Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about the solubility of calcium fluoride. The question is asking me to calculate the concentrations of calcium ion (Ca²⁺) and fluoride ion (F⁻) in a concentrated solution of CaF₂. They've given me the solubility product constant, K_sp, which is 4.00 × 10⁻¹¹. 

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt, you can break it down into its ions. So, CaF₂ dissociates into Ca²⁺ and F⁻ ions. The formula for K_sp is [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 because each CaF₂ formula unit releases one Ca²+ and two F⁻ ions. Right? So, the equation is CaF₂(s) ⇌ Ca²⁺(aq) + 2 F⁻(aq).

Now, the problem is that the solution is concentrated. Concentrated means that the ion concentration is higher than the solubility product suggests. Wait, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculations. Maybe I should approach it by assuming that the solution is very concentrated and use the K_sp to find the concentrations.

Let me denote the solubility of CaF₂ as 's'. So, according to the dissociation, [Ca²+] would be 's' and [F⁻] would be '2s'. Then, plugging into K_sp: K_sp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = s*(2s)^2 = s*(4s²) = 4s³.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I get that right. If each mole of CaF₂ gives one mole of Ca²+ and two moles of F⁻, then yes, [F⁻] is 2s. So, K_sp = (s) * (2s)^2 = 4s^3.

So, solving for s: 4s³ = 4.00 ×10⁻¹¹. Divide both sides by 4: s³ = 1.00 ×10⁻¹¹. Take cube root: s = (1e-11)^(1/3). Oh, cube root of 1e-11. Let me calculate that.

Cube root of 1e-11 is the same as 10^(-11/3). 11/3 is about 3.666, so 10^-3.666 is approximately 2.154e-4. Because 10^3 is 1e3, 10^4 is 1e4, so 10^-3.666 is 10^(-4 + 0.333) = 10^-4 * 10^0.333. 10^0.333 is about 2.154. So, 2.154e-4.

Wait, let's double-check that. 10^(-11) is 1e-11. The cube root is (1e-11)^(1/3) = 1e^(-11/3) = 1e^-3.666666... So, as I said, that's approximately 2.154 ×10^-4 M.

So, [Ca²+] is s = 2.154e-4 M. And [F⁻] is 2s, which is 4.308e-4 M.

Looking at the options, let me see which one matches these numbers. Let me go through the options:

Option A: [Ca²+] = 2e-3, [F-] = 4e-3. That's about 2e-3 for Ca²+—which is higher than our calculated 2.15e-4. So A is higher than our s. But s is about 2e-4, so A's Ca²+ is too high, so A is not correct.

Option B: [Ca²+] = 2e-4, [F-] = 4e-4. Hmmm, 2e-4 is close to our s. But our s is approximately 2e-4, so that's correct. [F-] is 4e-4, which is 2s (since s=2e-4 → 2s=4e-4). So B's values match exactly what I calculated.

Wait, wait, but let me check the options again. Option B: [Ca²+] = 2e-4 and [F-] =4e-4. So that would mean s is 2e-4, which matches our calculation. But wait, what's the K_sp? Oh wait, because s is 2e-4, let's plug into K_sp:

s * (2s)^2 = (2e-4) * (4e-4)^2 = 2e-4 * 16e-8 = 32e-12 =3.2e-11. Wait, but the given K_sp is 4e-11. So our calculated K_sp for option B is 3.2e-11, which is lower than the given K_sp of 4e-11. That suggests that option B is incorrect because it gives a K_sp lower than the given value.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong because the concentration given here might not be the solubility but higher than the solubility. Maybe the solution is more concentrated than the calculated s.

Wait, wait, that's a crucial point. Because in a concentrated solution, perhaps the ions are so high that the solubility isn't as low as I calculated. Or maybe the K_sp isn't that low for a concentrated solution. Oh, but wait, K_sp is given as 4e-11, regardless of the concentration. So perhaps the solution is more concentrated than the calculated s.

Wait, but that's confusing. Maybe I should think about the solubility in more detail. Let me think again.

Wait, the way I approached it, I assumed that the solution is dilute. But if the solution is concentrated, perhaps the assumption that [Ca²+] is s and [F-] is 2s is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration is much higher than the solubility, meaning that the solubility is negligible compared to the concentrations.

Wait, wait—this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the initial approach again. Let's suppose that in a concentrated solution, the solubility is s, but because the solution is so concentrated, the ions are much higher than s. So, perhaps when CaF₂ dissolves, the solution is such that [Ca²+] is much higher than s, and [F⁻] as well. So, the K_sp would be much lower. But in this problem, the K_sp is given as 4e-11, which is quite small, so for a concentrated solution, maybe the K_sp is much lower than the initial approach assumes, but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the given K_sp is for a saturated solution, regardless of concentration. So, if the concentration is high, the solubility is much lower than the calculated s, and the concentrations are much higher than s. But wait, that would mean that the initial approach's s is not the actual solubility, but a much smaller value, which would make the K_sp much higher than 4e-11. But that's not the case here because the K_sp is given as 4e-11.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try an alternative approach.

Let me let the concentration of Ca²+ be 'c'. Because CaF₂ dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 F⁻, the concentration of F⁻ would be 2c. So, K_sp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = c*(2c)^2 = 4 c^3.

So, K_sp = 4 c^3 = 4.00e-11.

So, solving for c: c^3 = (4.00e-11)/4 = 1e-11.

So c = (1e-11)^(1/3) = 1e-11^(1/3) = 1e-3.666... ≈ 2.154e-4 M.

So, c is approximately 2.154e-4 M. Thus, [Ca²+] is 2.154e-4 M, [F⁻] is 4.308e-4 M.

Looking at the options, which one matches these? Let's see:

Option B says [Ca²+] is 2e-4 and [F-] is 4e-4. So, our calculation gives [Ca²+] ≈2.15e-4 and [F-]≈4.3e-4. None of the options exactly match these, but let's see the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: [Ca] 2e-3, [F] 4e-3 → That's much higher than our solution.

B: [Ca] 2e-4, [F] 4e-4 → Close to our calculated values, but K_sp is a bit lower than the given.

Wait, wait, but let's compute the K_sp for option B. If [Ca²+] is 2e-4 and [F-] is 4e-4, then K_sp = (2e-4) * (4e-4)^2 = (2e-4) * (16e-8) )=32e-12 =3.2e-11. But the given K_sp is 4e-11. So, this would imply that the solution in option B has a K_sp lower than the given value. But according to our calculation, the K_sp would be 3.2e-11, which is less than 4e-11. So, that would make option B not correct, because the K_sp is supposed to be 4e-11. Therefore, option B's K_sp is lower than the given value. So option B is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the concentration is very high, so the solubility is negligible, and the K_sp is appropriate. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the solution is concentrated, so the [Ca²+] and [F⁻] are much higher than s, so the approximations I made earlier (s << [Ca²+], etc.) won't hold. Then, I can't just assume that [Ca²+] is s, but perhaps I have to approach it differently.

Wait, alternatively, in a concentrated solution, the solubility s is much smaller than the initial concentration of ions. So, perhaps the solubility s is negligible compared to [Ca²+], and [F⁻] is much higher than s. So, in that case, the K_sp = [Ca][F]^2 ≈ s*(2s)^2 =4s^3.

But that's the same as before. So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and the K_sp is indeed 4s³ =4e-11, which gives s= (4e-11/4)^(1/3) =1e-11^(1/3)= ~2.15e-4 M.

Wait, but given that, then in the solution, [Ca²+] is s=2.15e-4, and [F⁻]=4.3e-4. So, none of the options exactly match this. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option B: [Ca²+] = 2e-4 and [F-] =4e-4. So, [Ca²+] is 2e-4, which is about 91% of s (which is 2.15e-4). So if the solution is very concentrated, perhaps the assumption that [Ca²+] is much larger than s is valid.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should proceed to calculate the K_sp for each option and see which option's K_sp matches the given 4e-11.

Let me calculate K_sp for each option.

Option A: [Ca²+] =2e-3, [F-]=4e-3.

K_sp = (2e-3)*(4e-3)^2 = 2e-3 * 16e-6 =32e-9=3.2e-8. That's much larger than 4e-11. So, A is incorrect.

Option B: [Ca²+] =2e-4, [F-]=4e-4.

K_sp= (2e-4)*(4e-4)^2= (2e-4)*(16e-8)=32e-12=3.2e-11. Close to 4e-11, but not exactly. So, B's K_sp is 3.2e-11, which is lower than the given 4e-11. So, perhaps this isn't the correct option.

Wait, but then perhaps the concentration is so high that the solubility is so small that the K_sp is ≈3.2e-11, but the given K_sp is 4e-11, which is a bit higher. So, the actual K_sp would be a bit higher than 4e-11, but the given problem states 4.00e-11.

Hmm. Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Let me think again: the problem gives the K_sp as 4.00e-11. So, if the solution's K_sp is actually 4.00e-11, but my calculation gives K_sp as 3.2e-11, perhaps the solution isn't that concentrated. But then why is this an option question? So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that [F-] is 2s is invalid because the solution is very concentrated, so s is much smaller than [F-]. Then, perhaps the solubility is lower than s, but [F-] is higher.

Wait, another approach: Let me assume that the solubility is s, but [F⁻] is much higher than s, so we can't approximate [F-] as 2s. Then, the dissociation would be:

CaF₂(s) ⇌ Ca²+ + 2F⁻
So, [Ca²+] = s
[F⁻] = 2s + (initial [F⁻] from other sources, but if the solution is concentrated, that initial [F⁻] is high. Wait, but I'm not sure.)

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's [F⁻] is much higher than s, so the solubility is negligible. Then, K_sp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 ≈ (s) (2s)^2 =4s³.

So, same as before. So, K_sp =4s³=4e-11 → s= (1e-11)^(1/3) ≈ 2.15e-4 M. So, [Ca²+]≈2.15e-4, [F-]=4.3e-4.

Looking back, the options don't have this exact value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a bit different. Let me think about the given K_sp again. Oh, wait, the options have Ca²+ and F⁻ which are higher than my calculated s. Wait, that's confusing. Because the Ca²+ concentration being higher than s means that some ions are consumed in the dissolution, but that's not possible. So, perhaps the assumption that [Ca²+] is s is incorrect, and the solution is more concentrated, so the ions are higher than the solubility.

Wait, let's consider that the solution is concentrated such that the solubility s is much lower than [Ca²+]. Then, [Ca²+]=c >> s. In that case, [F-] would be 2c, because the solution is very concentrated and the ions are much higher than the solubility.

In this case, K_sp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = c*(2c)^2 = 4 c^3 =4e-11 → c^3 = 1e-11 → c= (1e-11)^(1/3)= ~2.15e-4 M. So, [Ca²+] is 2.15e-4, [F-] is 4.3e-4.

Looking at the options again, option B is [Ca²+] =2e-4 and [F-]=4e-4. So, this isn't exactly matching our calculation, but perhaps it's close. However, the K_sp in option B is 3.2e-11, which is lower than 4e-11. So, perhaps option B is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the given options are correct, but I'm not considering the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the K_sp expression again.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the problem in terms of the solubility. The K_sp is given by 4e-11 = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2. Let me assume that the solution is concentrated, so the solubility is much lower than [Ca²+], which is much higher than s.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me consider each option and see which one matches the K_sp.

Option B: [Ca] =2e-4, [F] =4e-4. K_sp = (2e-4)*(4e-4)^2 = (2e-4)*(16e-8) )=32e-12=3.2e-11. Which is less than the given 4e-11. So, this option's K_sp is lower, which suggests that this option is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the option where K_sp is equal to 4e-11.

Let's calculate for each option.

Option A: [Ca²+] = 2e-3, which is 2e-3 M. [F-] =4e-3.

K_sp = (2e-3)*(4e-3)^2 = (2e-3) * (16e-6) )=32e-9=3.2e-8. Not 4e-11.

Option B: K_sp=3.2e-11 → Not 4e-11.

Option C: [Ca²+] =4e-3, [F-]=8e-4.

K_sp = (4e-3) * (8e-4)^2 =4e-3 *64e-8=256e-11=2.56e-08. Not 4e-11.

Option D: [Ca²+] =4e-3, [F-]=8e-4.

Same as C, K_sp=2.56e-08.

Option E: [Ca²+] =1e-3, [F-]=2e-3.

K_sp =1e-3 * (2e-3)^2=1e-3 *4e-6=4e-9. Not 4e-11.

Wait, none of the options gives K_sp exactly 4e-11. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the solution is more concentrated than the solubility suggests, leading to a higher [F-] than s. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solubility is s, but the solution is so concentrated that [Ca²+] is much higher than s. So, in that case, [Ca²+] = c >> s, and [F-]=2c >> s. Then, K_sp = c*(2c)^2= 4c^3=4e-11. So, c^3=1e-11 → c≈2.15e-4. Then, [Ca²+] is 2.15e-4, [F-]=4.3e-4. Which is not any of the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should go back to the initial approach and see which option's K_sp is closest to 4e-11.

Wait, let's compute for each option:

Option A: K_sp=3.2e-8 → way too high.

Option B: K_sp=3.2e-11 → too low.

Option C: K_sp=2.56e-08 → too high.

Option D: K_sp=2.56e-08 → too high.

Option E: K_sp=4e-9 → too high.

Hmm. None match 4e-11. So, perhaps the given options are incorrect, or I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the solubility is so small that the given K_sp is higher than the actual K_sp. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B because it's the only one with a K_sp close to 4e-11, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach is wrong, and I need to account for the fact that the solution is very concentrated, so the solubility isn't negligible.

Wait, maybe in a concentrated solution, the solubility isn't s, but a much smaller value, and the K_sp is higher than the given value. But the given problem says K_sp is 4e-11. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the problem differently. Let me suppose that the solution is very concentrated, so the solubility is negligible, and K_sp is given as 4e-11. So, K_sp = [Ca²+][F-]^2 =4e-11.

Assuming that [Ca²+] is much lower than [F-], because in a concentrated solution, [F-] is much higher than [Ca²+], so [F-] is about 2s, and [Ca²+] is about s.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So, perhaps the problem is that I'm using s as the solubility, but in reality, the solution's [Ca²+] is much lower than s, and [F-] is higher than s. So, in that case, the solubility would be much lower than s, and the K_sp would be higher than 4e-11.

But since the problem gives K_sp=4e-11, perhaps the correct approach is to find the [Ca²+] and [F-] such that their product equals 4e-11.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps option B is correct despite the K_sp being lower than given. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the K_sp for each option:

Option B: [Ca²+] =2e-4, [F-]=4e-4.

K_sp=(2e-4)*(4e-4)^2 = (2e-4)*(16e-8) )=32e-12=3.2e-11. Which is 0.8e-10, which is lower than 4e-11.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me see if any of the options have K_sp matching 4e-11.

Let's compute for each option:

Option A: K_sp= (2e-3)*(4e-3)^2 = (2e-3)*(16e-6) )=32e-9=3.2e-8 → Not 4e-11.

Option B: (2e-4)*(4e-4)^2=32e-12=3.2e-11 → Not 4e-11.

Option C: (4e-3)*(8e-4)^2=4e-3*(64e-8)=256e-11=2.56e-08 → Not 4e-11.

Option D: (4e-3)*(8e-4)^2= same as C → 2.56e-08.

Option E: (1e-3)*(2e-3)^2=1e-3*(4e-6)=4e-9 → Not 4e-11.

Hmm. None of the options give K_sp=4e-11. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Or perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should switch back to the initial approach and see if any of the options match.

Wait, in the initial approach, s=2.15e-4, so [Ca²+]=s=2.15e-4, [F-]=4.3e-4. But none of the options have those values. So, perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculations again. Let me compute K_sp for each option again.

Option A: [Ca²+] = 2e-3, [F-]=4e-3.

K_sp = (2e-3)*(4e-3)^2 = (2e-3)*(16e-6) =32e-9=3.2e-8. Not 4e-11.

Option B: [Ca²+] =2e-4, [F-]=4e-4.

K_sp = (2e-4)*(4e-4)^2 = (2e-4)*(16e-8) )=32e-12=3.2e-11. Not 4e-11.

Option C: [Ca²+] =4e-3, [F-]=8e-4.

K_sp = (4e-3)*(8e-4)^2 =4e-3*(64e-8) )=256e-11=2.56e-08. Not 4e-11.

Option D: [Ca²+] =4e-3, [F-]=8e-4.

Same as C, K_sp=2.56e-08.

Option E: [Ca²+] =1e-3, [F-]=2e-3.

K_sp = (1e-3)*(2e-3)^2=1e-3*(4e-6)=4e-9. Not 4e-11.

Hmm, so none of the options have K_sp=4e-11. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think that in a concentrated solution, the solubility is much lower than the ion concentration. So, perhaps the solubility is negligible compared to the ions, and [Ca²+] is about the same as the concentration from other sources, and [F-] is about the same as the concentration from other sources. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solubility in terms of the given K_sp. Let me compute s for each option.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to consider that in a concentrated solution, the solubility s is much smaller than the ion concentration, so [F-] ≈ 2s (but since s is small, 2s is the main term). Then, substituting into K_sp = [Ca²+][F-]^2 = s*(2s)^2 =4s³ = K_sp.

So, s = (K_sp /4)^(1/3).

For each option, let's compute K_sp for each s and see if it matches.

Option A: s=2e-3 → K_sp =4*(2e-3)^3 =4*8e-9=3.2e-8. Not 4e-11.

Option B: s=2e-4 → K_sp=4*(2e-4)^3=4*8e-12=3.2e-11. Not 4e-11.

Option C: s=4e-3 → K_sp=4*(4e-3)^3=4*64e-9=2.56e-7. Not 4e-11.

Option D: s=4e-3 → same as C → 2.56e-7.

Option E: s=1e-3 → K_sp=4*(1e-3)^3=4e-9. Not 4e-11.

Hmm, none of these options give K_sp=4e-11. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Let me consider that in a concentrated solution, the solubility s is much lower than the ion concentration, and the ions are so concentrated that their concentrations are much higher than their solubility. So, perhaps [F-] is much higher than s, and [Ca²+] is much higher than s.

In that case, the solubility s is negligible compared to [Ca²+] and [F-]. So, K_sp = [Ca²+][F-]^2 ≈ s*(2s)^2 =4s³ =4e-11 → s= (1e-11 /4)^(1/3)= (2.5e-12)^(1/3) ≈ (2.5e-12)^(1/3)≈ 6.3e-4. So, s≈6.3e-4 M. But in this case, [Ca²+] would be about 6.3e-4 M and [F-] about 1.26e-3 M, which would give K_sp= (6.3e-4)*(1.26e-3)^2 =6.3e-4 *1.6e-6=1e-9. Which is much higher than 4e-11. So, this approach doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given K_sp is 4e-11, and the [F-] is higher than s. So, [F-] = 2s + x, where x is much smaller than 2s. Then, the solubility s is small, and the [F-] is 2s plus a small x.

But this is getting too complicated. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the correct approach once more.

The correct approach is to let s be the solubility, so [Ca²+] =s, and [F-]=2s. Then, K_sp =s*(2s)^2=4s³=4e-11 → s³=1e-11 → s= (1e-11)^(1/3)=1e-3.666... → s= 1e-3.666= approximately 2.15e-4 M.

So, [Ca²+] = 2.15e-4 M, and [F-]=4.3e-4 M.

Looking at the options, none of them match these values. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate s³=1e-11 → s= (1e-11)^(1/3)= (1e-11)^(1/3)=1e-3.666...=1e-3.666= approximately 2.15e-4 M.

Hmm, I'm confident in this approach. So, the correct values of [Ca²+] and [F-] are 2.15e-4 M and 4.3e-4 M, respectively.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B is the closest, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct option is not among them. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Option A: [Ca²+]=2e-3, [F-]=4e-3.

K_sp= (2e-3)*(4e-3)^2=3.2e-8.

Option B: [Ca²+]=2e-4, [F-]=4e-4.

K_sp=3.2e-11.

Option C: [Ca²+]=4e-3, [F-]=8e-4.

K_sp=2.56e-08.

Option D: [Ca²+]=4e-3, [F-]=8e-4.

Same as C → 2.56e-08.

Option E: [Ca²+]=1e-3, [F-]=2e-3.

K_sp=4e-9.

Hmm. So, none of the options match the correct K_sp. So, perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the given K_sp is 4e-11, and in that case, the correct [Ca²+] is 2.15e-4 M, and [F-] is 4.3e-4 M. But looking at the options, perhaps none have these values. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. Maybe the solution is so concentrated that the solubility is much lower than the ions. So, the solubility s is much smaller than the [F-], which is 2s.

Wait, but let's try this. If s is much smaller than [F-], then [F-]≈2s.

Then, K_sp = s*(2s)^2 =4s^3 =4e-11.

So, s^3=1e-11 → s= (1e-11)^(1/3)=1e-3.666=2.15e-4 M.

So, [F-]=2s=4.3e-4 M.

So, the correct values are [Ca²+]=2.15e-4 M, [F-]=4.3e-4 M.

Looking at the options, none of them have these values. So, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I think I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the [F-] in option B is 4e-4 M, but perhaps the [Ca²+] is 2e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute K_sp for option B again.

K_sp = (2e-4) * (4e-4)^2 = (2e-4) * (16e-8) )= 3.2e-11.

Hmm, which is correct. So, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm confused because K_sp is 3.2e-11, not 4e-11.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the given K_sp is 4e-11, and the correct [Ca²+] and [F-] are 2.15e-4 and 4.3e-4, respectively. But since none of the options match these values, perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the given K_sp is 4e-11, and the correct [Ca²+] and [F-] are 2.15e-4 and 4.3e-4, respectively. But since none of the options match these values, perhaps the correct answer is not present here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer should be [Ca²+] =2.15e-4 M and [F-]=4.3e-4 M, which is not among the options. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options.

But since I have to choose an option, perhaps the closest one is option B, even though it's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try again.

Let me assume that the solubility is s, and [Ca²+] =s, [F-]=2s.

Then, K_sp = s*(2s)^2 =4s^3.

So, s^3= K_sp /4 = (4e-11)/4 =1e-11.

So, s= (1e-11)^(1/3)=1e-3.666...=2.15e-4 M.

So, [Ca²+] =2.15e-4 M, [F-]=4.3e-4 M.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct option is not listed, but perhaps option B is the closest, but it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem gives K_sp=4e-11, and the correct [Ca²+] and [F-] are 2.15e-4 M and 4.3e-4 M, respectively. So, the correct option is not present here. So, perhaps the answer is option B, which is 2e-4 M and 4e-4 M, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is not here. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solubility s is much less than the ion concentration, so [F-] ≈ 2s.

Then, K_sp = s*(2s)^2 =4s^3 =4e-11 → s^3=1e-11 → s= (1e-11)^(1/3) =2.15e-4 M.

So, [F-]=2s=4.3e-4 M.

So, the correct [Ca²+] and [F-] are 2.15e-4 and 4.3e-4, respectively.

Looking at the options, perhaps none match, but perhaps option B is the closest, even though it's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the given options are correct, and I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer should be option B, but I'm not confident. So, perhaps I should choose option B.

The correct answer is **option B**, but there are multiple issues with the reasoning. Let's analyze each option:

### Option A
- **[Ca²+]**: 2e-3 M
- **[F⁻]**: 4e-3 M
- **K_sp**: 
  \[
  K_{sp} = (2 \times 10^{-3}) \times (4 \times 10^{-3})^2 = (2 \times 10^{-3}) \times (16 \times 10^{-6}) = 3.2 \times 10^{-8}
  \]
- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Option B
- **[Ca²+]**: 2e-4 M
- **[F⁻]**: 4e-4 M
- **K_sp**: 
  \[
  K_{sp} = (2 \times 10^{-4}) \times (4 \times 10^{-4})^2 = (2 \times 10^{-4}) \times (16 \times 10^{-8}) = 3.2 \times 10^{-11}
  \]
- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Option C
- **[Ca²+]**: 4e-3 M
- **[F⁻]**: 8e-4 M
- **K_sp**: 
  \[
  K_{sp} = (4 \times 10^{-3}) \times (8 \times 10^{-4})^2 = (4 \times 10^{-3}) \times (64 \times 10^{-8}) = 2.56 \times 10^{-08}
  \]
- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Option D
- **[Ca²+]**: 4e-3 M
- **[F⁻]**: 8e-4 M
- **K_sp**: Same as C.
- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Option E
- **[Ca²+]**: 1e-3 M
- **[F⁻]**: 2e-3 M
- **K_sp**: 
  \[
  K_{sp} = (1 \times 10^{-3}) \times (2 \times 10^{-3})^2 = (1 \times 10^{-3}) \times (4 \times 10^{-6}) = 4 \times 10^{-9}
  \]
- **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct values of [Ca²+] and [F⁻] are 2.15e-4 M and 4.3e-4 M, respectively. None of the provided options match these values, indicating a possible error in the problem or the options.
