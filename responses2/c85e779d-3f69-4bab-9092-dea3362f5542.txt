Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 6 multiplied by 24 divided by (8 minus 5). I need to figure out the correct answer from the given options. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when solving math problems, especially with multiple operations, I should follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the problem, I see there's a division inside the parentheses. So the first thing I should do is calculate what's inside the parentheses. That part is 8 minus 5. 8 minus 5 is 3. So now the problem simplifies to 6 multiplied by 24 divided by 3.

Now, the next step is to handle the multiplication and division from left to right. So I should do 6 multiplied by 24 first. 6 times 24… 6 times 20 is 120, and 6 times 4 is 24, so adding those gives 144. So now I have 144 divided by 3.

Wait, 144 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 3 goes into 14 four times (3*4=12), subtract 12 from 14, leaves 2. Bring down the 4, making 24. 3 goes into 24 eight times. So 144 divided by 3 is 48. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. 3 times 48 is 144. Yes, that's correct. So the result is 48.

Looking back at the options provided:

A: 48
B: 13
C: 36
D: -13
E: 60
F: -48
G: 18
H: 72
I: 54
J: 24

So option A is 48, which matches what I got. But hold on, did I handle the order correctly? Let me go through it again just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Parentheses first: 8-5=3. Then 6*24=144. Then 144/3=48. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be 48, which is option A.

The correct answer is A: 48.
