Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about audit procedures. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about which procedure a user auditor should include in the audit plan when the client uses a service organization for several processes. The options are A through J. I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should recall what audit procedures generally cover. From what I remember, audits usually involve several main steps. Let's think about the typical audit process.

1. **Rely on the service auditor's report without any additional review or testing.** Hmm, wait. That doesn't sound right. Because if you just rely on the auditor's report, you're not doing your own due diligence. You should review the report. So option A might be incorrect because it implies ignoring the report entirely.

2. **Review the service organization's controls and audit the client's internal controls.** That makes sense. The auditor would check if the service organization has effective controls. Then, they'd look into the client's own internal controls to see if they're functioning properly. So option B seems correct.

3. **Ignore the service organization's processes as they are not directly related to the client.** I don't think that's correct. The audit should consider all services, not just ignore them. So option C is probably not the best choice.

4. **Audit the client's internal controls without considering the service auditor's report.** This sounds similar to option B. It might not be necessary to consider the service auditor's report unless it's part of the audit process. So maybe B is better than C.

5. **Directly audit the service organization's operations without reviewing the service auditor's report.** Again, not sure. It's possible that the audit would involve checking the services, but the report is usually the source of that check. So I'm not sure if it's the right approach.

6. **Review that service auditor’s report on controls placed in operations.** This seems like it could be part of option B, but it's a separate step. Maybe it's a part of the audit process.

7. **Review the service organization's controls, without considering the service auditor's report.** Hmm, this sounds a bit like option B, but it might not be as comprehensive because it's specifically about the service organization's controls.

8. **Audit the service organization’s controls to test the work of the service auditor.** I'm not sure about this one. It seems like the audit is directly involving the service auditor, which might not be the right approach unless they're testing the auditor's work. Maybe it's not the best option.

9. **Review the service auditor’s report and outline the accounting system in a memo to the working papers.** This could be part of option B, but it's more about the report and a memo, which might be separate steps. 

10. **Audit the service organization’s controls, assess risk, and prepare the audit plan.** This sounds like a comprehensive approach. It involves looking at the services (step 2), assessing risks, and then creating the plan. So option J seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. What's the standard audit process? Usually, auditors first review the services (step 2), then the client's controls. So that would exclude option B, which says to audit the client's controls without considering the service auditor. So B would be incorrect because you should look at the client's controls.

Option J says audit the service controls, assess risk, and prepare the plan. That makes sense because the audit needs to look into the service organization's controls and then the client's, and then assess the risk and prepare the plan. 

Looking at the options, J seems the best fit because it directly addresses both the service organization's controls and the client's internal controls, along with risk assessment and planning. 

So, the correct answer should be J.
</think>

The correct answer is J. 

**Explanation:**
The audit process typically involves reviewing the service organization's controls, then the client's internal controls. This approach ensures a thorough examination of both layers. Additionally, assessing the audit risk and preparing the audit plan are crucial steps. Option J encompasses these elements comprehensively. 

**Answer:**
J
