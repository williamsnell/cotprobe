Okay, let's see, I have this math problem here. It says I need to find the least possible positive integer value of n such that the square root of (18 times n times 34) is an integer. Hmm, okay, so I need to make sure that 18n34 is a perfect square. Because the square root of a perfect square is an integer.

First, I think I should factor each of the numbers into their prime factors. That way, I can see what n needs to provide to make the whole product a perfect square.

So, let's factor 18 and 34. 

18 is 2 multiplied by 9, which is 2 times 3 squared. So, 18 = 2 × 3².

34 is 2 multiplied by 17. So, 34 = 2 × 17.

Now, the problem is 18 × n × 34. Let me rewrite that using the factors I just found.

18 × n × 34 = (2 × 3²) × n × (2 × 17) = 2² × 3² × 17 × n.

So, combining the constants, it's 2 squared times 3 squared times 17 times n. 

Now, for this product to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. Let's look at what we have so far:

- 2 squared is already even.
- 3 squared is already even.
- 17 has an exponent of 1, which is odd.
- And n contributes any other prime factors.

So, the only prime factor with an odd exponent is 17. Therefore, n must provide another 17 to make the exponent on 17 even (2). Because 17 ×17 is 17 squared.

Wait, but is that the only factor? Let me think. If n is 17, then the product becomes 2² × 3² × 17², which is (2×3×17) squared, which is 102 squared. So the square root would be 102, which is an integer.

Is there a smaller n? Let's see. The next smallest n would have to make all the exponents even. Since 17 is the only prime that's causing an odd exponent, n has to be at least 17. So, the smallest n is 17.

Looking at the options: D is 17, so that's the answer.

To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( \sqrt{18 \cdot n \cdot 34} \) is an integer, we factor each component:

- \( 18 = 2 \times 3^2 \)
- \( 34 = 2 \times 17 \)

Combining these, we have \( 18 \times 34 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 17 \). For the product to be a perfect square, all exponents must be even. The prime factor 17 has an odd exponent (1), so \( n \) must supply another 17. Thus, the smallest \( n \) is 17.
