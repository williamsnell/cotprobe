Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about variances in manufacturing. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about materials, labor, and overhead variances. The problem gives me some data about the standard and actual costs, and then asks me to compute several variances and determine their favorable or unfavorable status.

First, let's break down the given information.

For materials:
- Standard price is $2 per pound.
- Actual quantity used is 10,500 lbs at $21,525.
So, materials price variance is the actual quantity times the price difference from standard. Wait, but the actual cost is $21,525 for 10,500 lbs, so the actual price is $21,525 / 10,500 = $2.05 per lb. The standard is $2, so the variance is (Actual Price - Standard Price) * Actual Quantity. So ($2.05 - $2) * 10,500 = $0.05 * 10,500 = $525. Since it's above standard, it's unfavorable.

Then the quantity variance. The standard would have used how much? Well, the standard quantity per unit is given. Let's see the standard: 10 pounds per unit. So for 1,000 units, standard quantity is 10,000 lbs. But actual quantity used was 10,500. So the difference is 500 lbs. The price variance is already calculated as unfavorable. The quantity variance is (Actual Quantity - Standard Quantity) * Standard Price. So (10,500 - 10,000) * $2 = 500 * 2 = $1,000. Since actual is more than standard, this is unfavorable.

Next, labor. The standard rate is $3 per hour. They actually spent $15,402 for 5,100 hours. So actual rate is 15,402 / 5,100 â‰ˆ $3 per hour (exactly $3, since 5,100 * $3 is $15,300; wait, no, 5,100 * 3 is 15,300, but actual is 15,402, so that's 102 over. So actual rate is $3.02 per hour. The standard rate is $3, so the labor rate variance is (Actual Rate - Standard Rate) * Actual Hours. So ($3.02 - $3) *5,100 = $0.02*5,100 = $102, which is unfavorable because actual is higher.

For labor efficiency variance, it's (Actual Hours - Standard Hours) * Standard Rate. Standard hours are 1,000 units *5 hours = 5,000 hours. So Actual hours are 5,100, so difference is 100 hours. So 100 * $3 = $300. Unfavorable because actual hours are higher than standard.

Now overhead. The standard overhead is 5 hours per unit, 1,000 units, so standard overhead is 5,000 hours. They actually incurred 6,400 hours. The standard overhead rate is $1.20 per hour. So standard overhead is 5,000 * $1.20 = $6,000.

Actual overhead is $6,400. So the overhead variance is (Actual Overhead - Standard Overhead). So $6,400 - $6,000 = $400. Since actual is higher, it's unfavorable.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the materials, labor, and overhead variances. Let me clarify.

But wait, the question is about all three variances: materials, labor, and overhead. So the problem probably expects me to compute each of these three variances, but the options may combine multiple variances. Hmm. Wait no, the question is a bit confusing. The question says, "Find the 2 materials variances and state whether each is favorable or unfavorable." Oh wait, maybe they only have two materials and two labor, but perhaps the overhead is a single variance. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the first part of the question is: "What is a standard cost? How is it used?" So that's a separate question, but the main problem is the variances.

But the second part is the actual data, which includes all three types of costs.

So the problem is about computing four variances: materials, labor, and overhead. But the options list only two variances each, which is confusing. Wait no, let me check the actual data.

Looking back, the problem statement says:

The last month 1,000 units were manufactured, 800 sold for $53 each. Costs incurred were materials 10,500 lbs at $21,525, labor 5,100 hours at $15,402, overhead 6,400 hours at $6,400. Wait, no, the actual overhead is 6,400 hours, but the standard overhead is 5,000 hours, so standard overhead would be 5,000 * $1.20 = $6,000. Actual overhead is $6,400, so overhead variance is $400 unfavorable.

So for each of these, the variances are:

Materials:
- Price Variance: $525 (unfavorable)
- Quantity Variance: $1,000 (unfavorable)

Wait wait, no. Wait, the actual material cost is $21,525 for 10,500 lbs. The standard price is $2, so actual price per lb is $21,525 /10,500 = $2.05. So the price variance is (2.05 - 2)*10,500 = $0.05 *10,500 = $525. Unfavorable because actual is higher.

The quantity variance: standard quantity for 1,000 units is 10,000 lbs. Actual used is 10,500. So difference is 500 lbs. So variance is (10,500 -10,000) * 2 = 500 *2 = $1,000. Unfavorable because actual is higher than standard.

Labor:
- Rate Variance: actual rate is 15,402 /5,100 = $3.02 per hour. So (3.02 -3)*5,100 = $0.02*5,100 = $102. Unfavorable.
- Efficiency Variance: actual hours 5,100 - standard 5,000 = 100 hours. So 100 *3 = $300. Unfavorable.

Overhead:
- Overhead variance is (6,400 -6,000) = $400. Unfavorable.

So let's look at the options. The question is asking about materials, labor, and overhead variances.

Wait no, the question starts with "What is a standard cost? How is it used?" Then it's asking for variances, but in the problem, the data given includes all three types of costs. So perhaps I'm supposed to calculate both the materials and labor variances and the overhead variance, and then consider each option.

Wait, the options given are A to J, each with a set of variances. But looking at the options, each option seems to have two materials, two labor, and one overhead variance. But that doesn't add up, since the question says to compute three variances, but the options only list two for each.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the second part of the question is under the "Answer:" section, each option lists 2 materials, 2 labor, and 1 overhead variance. But that's impossible because the problem only mentions manufacturing (so perhaps overhead is a single variance), but the question asks for 2 materials, 2 labor, and the overhead variance. So that's three variances in total, but the options only have two each, which is confusing. Oh, perhaps I'm misreading the question.

Wait, the actual problem statement is: "The last month 1,000 units were manufactured, and 800 were sold for $53 per unit. The costs actually incurred were: ... Find the 2 materials variances and state whether each is favorable or unfavorable. ... How much is the overhead variance?"

Wait, so for the problem, I'm supposed to compute two materials variances and the overhead variance, possibly the labor variance isn't part of the question. But wait, the materials, labor, and overhead are the main variances. So perhaps the question is asking for two materials, two labor, and the overhead variance. But the options only list two variances each. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.

The problem says:

The last month 1,000 units were manufactured, and 800 were sold for $53 each. Costs actually incurred were: ...

Then the question broken down into parts:

1) What is a standard cost? How is it used?

2) Find the 2 materials variances and state whether each is favorable or unfavorable.

3) Find the 2 labor variances and state whether each is favorable or unfavorable.

4) How much is the overhead variance?

So the problem is asking for three variances: materials (two?), labor (two?), and overhead. But the options only list two options each, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me see the options again. Each option lists:

For example, option A: Materials Price $525 (unfavorable), Material Quantity $1000 (unfavorable), Labor rate $102 (unfavorable), Labor Efficiency $300 (favorable), Overhead $400 (unfavorable). But that's five variances, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only about two material variances, two labor variances, and one overhead variance. But the question says "Find the 2 materials variances and state whether each is favorable or unfavorable." So perhaps only two materials variances are to be calculated. But why would the question split into 2 materials, 2 labor, and 1 overhead? Maybe the problem is asking for three variances, but the options only list two each. That's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the materials and labor variances, and the overhead is not applicable, but that doesn't make sense because the question clearly asks for the overhead variance.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's just go through each part.

So, the first part is about what a standard cost is and how it's used.

The standard cost is the predetermined cost for each unit of output, combining standard material, labor, and overhead. It's used to set a benchmark for comparing actual costs to see if variances can be attributed to specific factors.

Then, for the variances:

For materials:

- Price Variance = (Actual Price - Standard Price) * Actual Quantity
= ($21,525 /10,500 - $2) *10,500 = ($2.05 - $2) *10,500 = $0.05 *10,500 = $525 Unfavorable.

- Quantity Variance = (Actual Quantity - Standard Quantity) * Standard Price
= (10,500 -10,000) * $2 = 500 * $2 = $1,000 Unfavorable.

For labor:

- Rate Variance = (Actual Rate - Standard Rate) * Actual Hours
= ($15,402 /5,100 - $3) *5,100
= ($3.02 - $3) *5,100 = $0.02 *5,100 = $102 Unfavorable.

- Efficiency Variance = (Actual Hours - Standard Hours) * Standard Rate
= (5,100 -5,000) *3 = 100 *3 = $300 Unfavorable.

For overhead:

- Overhead Variance = Actual Overhead - Standard Overhead
= $6,400 - (5,000 * $1.20) = $6,400 - $6,000 = $400 Unfavorable.

So the standard cost is the sum of the three standard costs: $2 + $3 + $1.20 = $6.20 per unit. It's used to compare against actual costs.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches our results.

Looking at option B:

Materials Price Variance $500 (unfavorable), Material Quantity Variance $1000 (favorable), Labor rate variance $100 (favorable), Labor Efficiency $300 (favorable), Overhead $400 (favorable)

Wait, our calculations are:

Materials Price: $525 Unfavorable.

Material quantity: $1,000 Unfavorable.

Labor rate: $102 Unfavorable.

Labor efficiency: $300 Unfavorable.

Overhead: $400 Unfavorable.

So none of the options match exactly. Let's check each option.

Option A:

Materials Price: 525 (unfavorable)

Material quantity: 1000 (unfavorable)

Labor rate: 102 (unfavorable)

 Labor efficiency: 300 (favorable)

Overhead: 400 (unfavorable)

Wait, in our case, all labor variances are unfavorable, but in option A, only the rate is unfavorable, and efficiency is favorable. That doesn't match.

Option B:

M. P. V: 500 unfavorable

M. Q. V: 1,000 favorable.

So our M. Q. is unfavorable, so B is incorrect.

Option C:

M. P. V: 525 Unfavorable.

M. Q. V: 950 Unfavorable.

So our M. Q. is 1,000 unfavorable, so C is incorrect.

Option D:

M.P. V: 600 Unfavorable.

M. Q. V: 900 Unfavorable.

M. Q. is 1000, but D's M. Q. is 900 Unfavorable. So our M. Q. is 1000 Unfavorable, so D is incorrect.

Option E:

M. P. V: 525 Unfavorable.

M. Q. V: 1000 Unfavorable.

M. Q. is 1000 Unfavorable, but in our case it's 1000 Unfavorable. So E's M. Q. is Unfavorable, which matches.

E's other variances:

Labor rate: $102 Unfavorable.

Labor efficiency: $250 Unfavorable (since actual was 5,100; standard is 5,000, so difference is 100 hours. So 100 *3 = 300. If actual is higher, efficiency is unfavorable. So in E, efficiency is unfavorable.

Overhead is $400 Unfavorable.

So Option E has:

M. P. V: 525 Un.

M. Q. V: 1000 Un.

L. R. V: 102 Un.

L. E. V: 250 Un.

Overhead: 400 Un.

So that's all three variances unfavorable.

So which option matches this? Let me check each option again.

Option E: 

M. P. V: 525 Un.

M. Q. V: 1000 Un.

L. R. V: 102 Un.

L. E. V: 250 Un.

O.V.: 400 Un.

Which matches our results.

Wait, but another option is option J.

Option J:

M. P. V: 500 Un.

M. Q. V: 950 Un.

L. R. V: 100 Un.

L. E. V: 250 Un.

O.V.: 350 Un.

So our M. Q. is 1,000 Un, but option J's M. Q. is 950 Un, which is unfavorable.

Our L. E. V is 300 Un, but in option J, it's 250 Un. So that's a mismatch.

Option I:

M. P. V: 500 Un.

M. Q. V: 1050 Un.

L. R. V: 100 Un.

L. E. V: 250 Un.

O.V.: 450 Un.

Wait, in our case, M. Q. is 1,000 Un, so I's M. Q. is 1,050 Un, which is Unfavorable but higher. So I's M. Q. is 1,050 Un, which is Unfavorable. But in our case, it's 1,000 Un. So no match.

Option F:

M. P. V: 550 Un.

M. Q. V: 1000 Un.

L. R. V: 102 Un.

L. E. V: 280 Un.

O.V.: 400 Un.

Here, M. Q. is 1,000 Un; matches. L. R. is 102 Un, matches. L. E. V is 280 Un, which is Unfavorable. Our L. E. V is 300 Un. So in F, it's 280 Un. So only 280, which is Unfavorable, but our is 300 Un. So F is incorrect.

Option A:

M. Q. is 1,000 Un.

But in our case, it's 1,000 Un, so A's M. Q. is 1,000 Un, which matches. But A's L. E. V is 300 Un, which matches our calculation. But the other variances don't match. So A's variances are:

M. P. V: 525 Un.

M. Q. V: 1,000 Un.

L. R. V: 102 Un.

L. E. V: 300 Un.

O.V.: 400 Un.

Which matches only up to M. E. V and O.V. So perhaps option A is correct in some aspects.

But wait, in our calculation, the materials quantity variance is unfavorable, labor rate is unfavorable, efficiency is unfavorable, overhead is unfavorable.

Looking at the options, option A has M. Q. as favorable, which is wrong.

Option E matches all three variances as unfavorable, which is correct.

So the correct option is E.

Wait, but the question says "How much is the overhead variance?" So the overhead variance is $400 unfavorable, which is correct in option E.

So to answer the question, which asks for the overhead variance, the correct option would have that value. So the question is, under the correct options, the answer is E.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is phrased as a set of four options, each listing two materials, two labor, and one overhead. But that doesn't make sense because each option lists several variances. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, the question is about computing the overhead variance, but the options list the overhead variance as $400, but perhaps the question also asks for other variances.

Wait, looking back, the question:

The last month 1,000 units were manufactured, 800 sold for $53 each. Costs incurred were: 10,500 lbs at $21,525, 5,100 hours at $15,402, 6,400 hours at $6,400. Find the 2 materials variances and state whether each is favorable or unfavorable. 2) Find the 2 labor variances and state whether each is favorable or unfavorable. 3) How much is the overhead variance? So, the first two questions are about the variances, and the third is about the overhead variance.

So, the correct answer would be option E, where the overhead variance is $400 unfavorable.

But let me confirm with the options:

Looking for the option that lists two materials variances (unfavorable, unfavorable), two labor variances (unfavorable, unfavorable), and one overhead variance (unfavorable). So option E matches all of these.

So the correct answer is option E.
</think>

The overhead variance is $400 unfavorable. 

The correct option is **E**.

ANSWER: E
