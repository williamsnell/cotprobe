Question:

A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. "Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. "At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute

Options:

A: constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.
B: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C: constitutional, as it falls under the state's right to regulate its own law enforcement bodies.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the resident alien's right to seek employment.
E: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: unconstitutional, because it is an unfair restriction on the resident alien's opportunity for employment.
G: constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.
H: unconstitutional, because it violates the resident alien's rights under the Fifth Amendment.
I: constitutional, because the statute does not specifically discriminate against any particular nationality or ethnicity.

Okay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. So the question is about whether a state statute that restricts a permanent resident alien's eligibility to become a member of the state police is constitutional or not.

Hmm. So first, I'll read through the facts again. The state has a statute that says no one can become a member of the state police unless they're a U.S. citizen. The resident alien is a citizen of a foreign country and isn't eligible for citizenship yet. He's been living in the U.S. for two years, but to get naturalized, he needs five years. So he's two years short. He wants to apply for a job as a state trooper, which is a police position.

Now, the state's argument is that only U.S. citizens can become police members, based on the statute. But the question is whether this is constitutional. I remember that when a state has a law that affects its citizens, it has to consider the state's interest in public safety. So the state is trying to regulate police force to protect its citizens.

I think the key point here is whether the state's concern for the safety of its citizens is outweighed by the requirement for citizens to be citizens of the U.S. Some people might argue that the state has a right to regulate its own police force, as that's its role. But others might say that the law is unconstitutional because it's imposing a significant restriction on people from other countries, even if they're eligible, based on their U.S. citizenship status.

The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause might come into play. The Supreme Court has dealt with similar issues. If the law is deemed to violate the Equal Protection clause, it could be unconstitutional. But I'm not sure if the state's regulation of police force falls under that.

Wait, the Statute of Frauds and the Equal Protection Clause. The Statute of Frauds requires citizens to be U.S. citizens before they can become state officers. So the state is ensuring that only U.S. citizens can serve. 

In terms of constitutional principles, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause is about protection against unreasonable discrimination. But this isn't about discrimination, it's about the state's right to regulate its own law enforcement bodies.

Alternatively, there's the question of whether the law is a violation of due process. The resident alien is applying for employment, so he might be seeking a favorable outcome, but the state's law could be seen as interfering with his job application. But the question is about whether the law is constitutional.

Another angle: The Five Second Rule. The state is requiring the resident alien to be a U.S. citizen to apply for the trooper job, but he's been living in the U.S. for two years. The five-year residency requirement might make him ineligible, but the primary issue is the state statute.

I remember that in some cases, the state can regulate the police force without violating the Equal Protection clause because it's a matter of state power, not a matter of race or national origin. For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 deals with this, allowing the state to regulate its police force.

So the statute doesn't discriminate against any nationality because it's about being a U.S. citizen, not about their nationality. Therefore, it's not targeting any specific group. Thus, the state has a legitimate right to regulate its police force, even across national borders.

Putting it all together, the court would likely find the statute constitutional because it's within the state's power to regulate its own law enforcement bodies, and it doesn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause. The main concern is whether the state is acting in a way that's unconstitutional, but since it's about a state's right to police, it's constitutional.

The state's statute is constitutional because it is within the state's power to regulate its own law enforcement bodies. The requirement for citizens of the U.S. to become police members is a matter of state power, not a matter of race or nationality. This approach aligns with the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause, as the state can regulate its police function without infringing on the rights of citizens from other countries. Therefore, the court would likely find the statute constitutional.
