Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about calculating the mass flow rate required to pump water through a pipe line. The given power is 3 HP, and we need to assume steady flow, isothermal, and no friction loss. The options are various mass flow rates in lbm/s. 

Hmm, I remember that power in such systems can be related to the work done, which involves mass flow, velocity, and pressure. But wait, since the flow is steady and there's no friction, maybe it's a free jet situation? Or perhaps it's about head and power. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the formula for power in terms of flow.

Power (P) is equal to the product of mass flow rate (m_dot) and the specific kinetic energy. Oh right! Specific kinetic energy is (1/2) v², where v is the velocity of the fluid. So the formula would be P = m_dot * (v²/2), but wait, that's when the fluid is moving. Since the system is pumped, maybe it's about the head and energy conversion.

Wait, another approach: The power required to pump water is equal to the product of the pressure head and the mass flow rate. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think. Oh, yes, the power (in horsepower) can be calculated using the formula P = (rho * g * h * m_dot), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, since the system is isothermal and frictionless, the power is equal to the work done per unit time. So, power P is equal to the mass flow rate multiplied by the specific kinetic energy (since the velocity is the same as the velocity head, which is related to the pressure drop).

Wait, power can be expressed as P = m_dot * (ΔP / (2 * g)), where ΔP is the pressure difference. But wait, in this case, is there a pressure loss? No, the problem states no friction loss, so maybe the pressure difference is due to the head required to pump the water. Alternatively, perhaps it's a free jet scenario where the head is related to the kinetic energy.

Wait, let's think about the units. The power given is in HP, and the answer options are in lbm/s. So I need to convert HP to watts because I know the standard unit for power is watts, and then convert to lbm/s.

First, I'll convert 3 HP to watts. I remember that 1 HP is about 745.7 watts. So 3 HP is 3 * 745.7 ≈ 2237.1 watts.

Now, the power (P) is 2237.1 watts. The formula for power in terms of mass flow rate and velocity is P = m_dot * (v² / 2). But wait, I'm not sure about this, because in this case, the flow is through a pipe, so maybe the velocity is related to the pressure difference. Alternatively, perhaps it's the head that's involved.

Wait, another formula: The power required for a pump can be written as P = (ΔP) * m_dot, where ΔP is the pressure difference in pounds per square inch (PSI) and m_dot is the mass flow rate in lbm/s. But wait, that's for when pressure is the driving force. Or perhaps it's P = (density * g * h) * m_dot, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should consider the head required to pump the water. The head (h) is the height of the water column that needs to be lifted. So head h = (P / (ρ * g)), where P is the pressure, ρ is density, and g is acceleration due to gravity.

But wait, since this is a steady flow and isothermal, perhaps it's a free jet situation. So the velocity head would equal the head required. The head required is the head of the water column that's being pumped. So, H = (P / (ρ * g))), but wait, no, maybe H is the height of the water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the head is the pressure difference over the pump's head.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the power equation. The power required to pump the water is P = m_dot * (ΔP / (2 * g)), where ΔP is the pressure difference. But wait, I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, the formula that relates power, mass flow rate, and velocity is P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2). But since there's no friction, the velocity is due to the pressure. So perhaps it's better to express the pressure head in terms of the velocity.

Wait, another approach: The power required to pump the water is given by P = m_dot * (ΔP / (2 * g)), but ΔP is the pressure difference, which would be due to the head of the water. So, Head H = (ΔP) / (ρ * g). Then, substituting into the power equation: P = m_dot * H.

So, P = m_dot * H. Then, since H is the head, and H = (ΔP) / (ρ * g), but ΔP is the pressure difference across the pipe. Wait, but wait, in a pump, the pressure is increased. But in this case, the flow is being pumped, so perhaps it's a positive displacement pump, but without friction, so perhaps the energy is purely due to the velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this as P (in watts) = m_dot (in kg/s) * (v^2 / 2). But then I need to convert mass flow rate into kg/s. But wait, the options are in lbm/s. So I need to get into the unit conversions.

Wait, let me get the units straight. Let's convert 3 HP to watts. 1 HP is 745.7 W, so 3 HP is about 2237.1 W.

Now, the mass flow rate (m_dot) is in lbm/s. I need to find m_dot.

But let's think about the equation. The power P is equal to the kinetic energy per unit time multiplied by the mass flow rate. So,

P = m_dot * (v² / 2).

But I don't know the velocity v. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should find the velocity based on the head.

Wait, the head H (in feet) is equal to the pressure head. So H = (ΔP) / (ρ * g). But again, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the head is the height of the water that needs to be pumped. So H = (ΔP) / (ρ * g) * (1 / g) ? Wait, no, head is (ΔP) / (ρ * g). Because pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI) is force per area. So, for example, 1 psi equals 1 lb per square inch. So, H (in feet) is equal to (ΔP in pounds) / (ρ * g) divided by 144 (since 1 psi = 1/144 lb per square inch). Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the specific head and the velocity. The specific head is H_s = (v²) / (2g). So, the head in feet is H = H_s * 25.4 (since 1 foot is 25.4 cm). So H (in feet) = (v²) / (2g) * 25.4.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation:

Power (W) = (m_dot) * (v^2 / 2).

But without knowing v, this might not help unless I can relate it to the head.

Wait, but if the flow is steady and isothermal with no friction, perhaps the head is related to the pressure. So the head H can be calculated by H = (ΔP) / (ρ * g).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units. Let's think in terms of SI units. Density of water is 1000 kg/m³, g is 9.81 m/s².

But wait, the given data is in British units (HP, lbm/s). So, perhaps I should convert everything to SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is expressed in terms of pounds, feet, and seconds.

Wait, another approach: The formula for power in terms of mass flow rate and velocity is P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2). But I don't have v. So maybe I need to find v in terms of the pressure difference.

But without knowing the pressure difference, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's a free jet. So, the head H is H = (v^2) / (2g). So, v = sqrt(2gH). But H is the head, which is (ΔP) / (ρ * g). So, H = (ΔP)/(ρ g). So, v = sqrt(2g * (ΔP)/(ρ g)) ) = sqrt(2ΔP/(ρ)).

But wait, let's think, in this case, the pressure difference ΔP is the pressure that the pump provides. But since the flow is steady and isothermal, and there's no friction, perhaps the pump provides the pressure needed to overcome the pressure loss? Wait, no, because there's no loss, so the pump must supply the pressure needed to pump the water up, which would be equal to the head H. So, ΔP is the pressure difference, which is equal to ρ g H (since H is pressure head). So, ΔP = ρ g H.

Wait, but in that case, the power required is P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2). And v is the velocity of the water in the pipe. But since H is the head, H = v²/(2g), so v = sqrt(2 g H).

Substituting H into the velocity equation: v = sqrt(2 g (ρ g H) / (ρ g)) ) = sqrt(2 g * (ρ g H) / (ρ g)) ) = sqrt(2 g H). Oh, wait, that simplifies to v = sqrt(2 g H). But wait, H is (ΔP)/(ρ g), so substituting back H into the equation gives v = sqrt(2 g * (ΔP)/(ρ g)) ) = sqrt(2 ΔP/(ρ)).

But I'm getting stuck in the units here. Maybe it's better to convert all the units into SI and then compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the head and the mass flow rate.

Wait, I've heard that the head required for a pump can be found using the formula H = (P)/(ρ g), where P is the pressure, ρ is density, and g is acceleration due to gravity. But since we're dealing with a pump, perhaps the pressure is the head, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The power in a pump is given by P = (m_dot) * (v^2 / 2). But without knowing v, perhaps we can find it using the head.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach: the mass flow rate can be found using the formula m_dot = (P * 25.4) / (ρ * g * H * 60) ), because of unit conversions. Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the head required, which is H = (P) / (ρ g), then the power is P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2), but v is sqrt(2 g H). So substituting, P = m_dot * (2 g H) / 2 = m_dot g H. So, P = m_dot g H.

But H is the head, which is (P)/(ρ g). So substituting H gives P = m_dot g * (P)/(ρ g) ) = m_dot P / (ρ). So, P = (m_dot P)/(rho) → m_dot = rho.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's write it again.

P = m_dot * (v^2/2). And v = sqrt(2 g H). And H = P/(rho g).

So H = P/(rho * g) → v^2/2 = (2 g H) → v^2/2 = (2 g (P/(rho g))) ) → v^2/2 = (2g * P)/(rho g) ) → v²/2 = (2 P)/(rho). So, v² = 4 P / rho.

So, substituting back into P = m_dot * (v² / 2), we get P = m_dot * ( (4 P / rho) ) / 2 ) → P = m_dot * (2 P / rho ) → So, m_dot = (P * rho ) / (2 P ) ) → m_dot = rho / 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because rho is 1000 kg/m³, so m_dot would be 500 kg/m², which is 500 kg/m² * 1e-3 m³/kg → 0.5 kg/s. That can't be right. So I think I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the relationship between power, mass flow rate, and velocity.

Wait, wait a second. The formula I'm trying to use is probably incorrect. So perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe using the formula that connects power to the mass flow rate and velocity: P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2). But without knowing v, I need another equation.

Wait, another formula relates the velocity of the liquid to the head: v = sqrt(2 g H). But H is the head, which is the pressure head. H is the pressure provided divided by the density times g. So, H = (ΔP) / (rho g). But without knowing ΔP, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the pump is providing a head equal to the pressure needed, so ΔP = m_dot * v² / (2 rho g).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the problem in terms of the units. The given data is in horsepower, and the options are in lbm/s.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, convert 3 HP to watts: 3 * 745.7 ≈ 2237.1 W.

Next, convert this power into lbm/s. To do that, I need to know how power relates to mass flow rate. So, power is energy per unit time. The energy per unit mass is the specific kinetic energy, which is (v²)/2. So, power P = m_dot * (v²/2).

But I don't know v. So perhaps I can find v in terms of the pressure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the formula that relates power to the mass flow rate and the velocity. But without knowing v, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified. Let me think about the basic equation again. Power (P) = m_dot * (v^2 / 2). But I need another equation that relates v to P and other known quantities.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire power is used to pump the water, so head is equal to the pressure drop. So, Head H = P / (rho * g). Then, the power can also be expressed as P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2) = m_dot * (2 g H).

So, substituting H = P/(rho g) into this equation:

P = m_dot * (2 g * P/(rho g)) ) → P = m_dot * (2g P)/(rho g) ) → P = m_dot * (2 P) / rho.

So, P = (m_dot * 2 P) / rho → rearranging, m_dot = rho / 2.

Wait, rho is 1000 kg/m³. So, m_dot is 500 kg/m². But that's 500 kg/m² * (1e-3 m³/kg) = 0.5 kg/s. But that doesn't match any of the options. So, I must have made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check the units.

The equation I derived is:

P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2) → in watts.

But v is in m/s. So, v² is m²/s².

So, m_dot must be in kg/s.

But H is in meters, P in Pascals (kg/(m s²)), rho is kg/m³.

Wait, let's go back to the correct formula.

The correct formula is Power (W) = mass flow rate (kg/s) * specific kinetic energy (J/kg).

Specific kinetic energy is v² / 2. So, P = m_dot * (v² / 2).

But how to express v in terms of pressure and density? The velocity can be found using v = sqrt(2 P / (rho)).

Wait, no, wait. The correct formula for velocity in a pipe is v = sqrt( (2 P ) / (rho A) ), but that's for a pipe with a certain area. Wait, but in this problem, we're not given the pipe's diameter, so perhaps it's a free jet where the velocity is determined by the pressure.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2), where v is the velocity at the exit. But in this case, the velocity would be based on the pressure.

Wait, another approach: The kinetic energy per unit mass is (v^2)/2, and the power is the product of that and the mass flow rate. So, P = m_dot * (v^2/2).

But without knowing v, let's think about the head. Head H is (P) / (rho g) → H = (P) / (rho g) meters.

Then, the power can also be expressed as P = m_dot * (2 g H). So substituting H into that equation: P = m_dot * (2 g (P / (rho g))) ) → P = m_dot * (2 g P ) / ( rho g ) → canceling g and P, m_dot = rho / 2.

Wait, rho is 1000 kg/m³ → m_dot = 1000 / 2 = 500 kg/s → 500 lbm/s. But wait, the options don't have 500 except option E.

Wait, but wait, the options include 1000 lbm/s (option C), 2000 lbm/s (option D). So, 500 isn't among them. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Ah! Wait, I think I confused the units. Let me try again with the correct unit conversions.

Power P is given in HP. Let's convert 3 HP to watts.

1 HP = 745.7 W → 3 HP = 3 * 745.7 = 2237.1 W.

Now, the formula for power in a pump is:

P = (delta_P) * (m_dot) * (g) / (2)

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is P = m_dot * (v^2 / 2).

But velocity v can be found from the pressure, assuming a certain flow condition. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P = (m_dot) * (v^2 / 2).

But without knowing v, perhaps we can find v in terms of the pressure.

Wait, another formula for the head is H = (v^2) / (2 g). So, v = sqrt(2 g H).

But H is the pressure head, which is equal to P / (rho g). So, H = P/(rho g).

So, substituting H into v: v = sqrt(2 g (P/(rho g)) ) = sqrt(2 P / rho).

So, v = sqrt( (2 * 2237.1 ) / 1000 ) → 2 * 2237.1 = 4474.2 → 4474.2 / 1000 = 4.4742 → sqrt(4.4742) ≈ 2.116 m/s.

Now, the power P is m_dot * (v^2 / 2).

So, 2237.1 = m_dot * ( (2.116)^2 ) / 2 → (2.116)^2 is about 4.477 → 4.477 / 2 → 2.2385 → So,

2237.1 = m_dot * 2.2385 → m_dot = 2237.1 / 2.2385 ≈ 999.7 kg/s → approximately 1000 lbm/s.

Wait, but 999.7 is approximately 1000, which is option C. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 1000 lbm/s.

Wait, but in my calculation, I used v = 2.116 m/s, and m_dot = 1000 kg/s. But the given options have 1000 as option C, and 2000 as option D.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, P = 3 HP = 2237.1 W.

H = P / (rho * g) → P is in watts, rho is kg/m³, g is m/s².

Wait, but wait: units of H are in meters. So, P (watts) is kg/(m s²) * m²/(kg) * m/s².

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert all units to SI.

So, P = 2237.1 W.

rho = 1000 kg/m³.

g = 9.80665 m/s².

So, H (pressure head) is P / (rho * g).

H = 2237.1 / (1000 * 9.80665) → 2237.1 / 9806.65 → approximately 0.228 meters.

Then, v = sqrt(2 g H) → v = sqrt(2 * 9.80665 * 0.228) → 2 * 9.80665 = 19.6133 → 19.6133 * 0.228 = approx 4.498 → square root is about 2.122 m/s.

Now, the mass flow rate m_dot is P / (v² / 2) → m_dot = P * 2 / v².

So, m_dot = (2237.1 * 2) / (2.122^2) → 4474.2 / (4.504) → approx 993.6 kg/s. Which is about 994 lbm/s, but that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Alternatively, maybe the formula should be P = (m_dot) * v² / 2, and v can be found using v = sqrt(2 g H). But I'm not getting the correct result. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the mass flow rate is found using the formula m_dot = (P * 2) / (v²). But without knowing v, this seems impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula m_dot = P / (v² / 2), which simplifies to 2P / v², but I don't know v.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula that relates power to mass flow rate and the square of the pressure. Or perhaps the problem is using the formula for the head and the mass flow rate. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula that combines these variables. Let me think, I've read that the power required to pump a fluid through a pipe is given by P = m_dot * (v^2)/2, and v can be found using v = sqrt(2 g H), where H is the head. H can be found as H = (P)/(rho * g).

So, substituting H into v, we get v = sqrt(2 g (P/(rho g)) ) ) = sqrt(2 P / (rho g) ).

Wait, that's the same as before. So, v = sqrt(2 P / (rho g) ).

Then, substituting v into the power equation:

P = m_dot * (v^2)/2 → P = m_dot * ( (2 P / (rho g) ) ) / 2 → P = m_dot * ( P / (rho g) )

So, m_dot = (P * rho g) / P ) → m_dot = rho g.

Wait, that can't be right. Because rho is 1000 kg/m³, g is 9.80665 m/s², so m_dot would be 1000 * 9.80665 ≈ 9807 kg/s → which is about 10000 lbm/s. But that's not an option here.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the units. Let me re-express this correctly.

Wait, P is in watts (W), which is kg m²/s³.

rho is 1000 kg/m³.

g is 9.80665 m/s².

So, m_dot = (P * rho * g) / (P) → m_dot = rho * g → 1000 * 9.80665 ≈ 9806.65 kg/s.

Convert to lbm/s: 1 kg/s = 0.001 lbm, so 9806.65 kg/s = 9806.65 * 0.001 = 9.80665 lbm/s. That's way off from any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the basic equation again.

The power required is P = m_dot * v² / 2.

But v can be determined from the pressure. Wait, perhaps the velocity is found using the equation for a free jet:

v = sqrt(2 g H), where H is the pressure head.

But H is P/(rho g), so v = sqrt( 2 g * (P/(rho g) ) ) ) = sqrt( 2 P / (rho) ) ).

So, substituting v into the power equation:

P = m_dot * ( 2 P / rho ) ) / 2 → P = m_dot * (P / rho ) → m_dot = rho.

So, m_dot = rho → 1000 kg/s → 1000 lbm/s.

Wait, but that's option C, 1000 lbm/s. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but according to my previous calculations, I was getting m_dot as approximately 993 kg/s, which would be about 1000 lbm/s. But this seems to suggest that the mass flow rate is just rho, which is 1000 kg/s. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 1000 lbm/s.

But wait, earlier I thought the answer was option E (500). But this reasoning leads me to option C (1000). Let me try to recheck.

Wait, the mass flow rate m_dot is given by m_dot = rho * g → 1000 kg/m³ * 9.80665 m/s² = 9806.65 kg/s → which is 9806.65 lbm/s. Oh, wait, that's not correct. Because 1 kg = 0.001 lbm. So, 9806.65 kg/s = 9806.65 * 0.001 = 9.80665 lbm/s. That's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me re-express the problem correctly.

Wait, rho is 1000 kg/m³. g is 9.80665 m/s². So, m_dot = rho * g → 1000 * 9.80665 = 9806.65 kg/s → 9806.65 lbm/s.

But the options don't have 9806.65. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula P = m_dot * v^2 / 2, and v is found using v = sqrt(2 g H), with H = P/(rho g).

So, substituting H into v:

v = sqrt(2 g (P/(rho g)) ) ) → sqrt(2 g * P/(rho g) ) → sqrt( 2 P / (rho) ) → v = sqrt(2 P / rho).

Then, substituting v into P = m_dot * v² / 2:

P = m_dot * (2 P / rho ) / 2 → P = m_dot * (P / rho ) → m_dot = rho → 1000 kg/s → 1000 lbm/s.

So, according to this, the mass flow rate is 1000 lbm/s, which is option C.

But earlier, I thought that the answer was 500 lbm/s. Hmm, but I must have made a mistake in the unit conversions.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C, 1000 lbm/s.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by converting the power from horsepower (HP) to watts (W). The conversion factor is:

\[
1 \, \text{HP} = 745.7 \, \text{W}
\]

Thus, for \( 3 \, \text{HP} \):

\[
3 \, \text{HP} = 3 \times 745.7 \, \text{W} = 2237.1 \, \text{W}
\]

Next, we use the formula for power in a pump:

\[
P = \dot{m} \cdot \frac{v^2}{2}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the power (2237.1 W),
- \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate (in kg/s),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the fluid (in m/s).

To find \( v \), we use the relationship between velocity and pressure head:

\[
v = \sqrt{2 g H}
\]

where:
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.80665 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)),
- \( H \) is the pressure head, which is given by:

\[
H = \frac{P}{\rho g}
\]

Here:
- \( \rho \) is the density of water (\( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)).

Substituting \( H \) into \( v \):

\[
v = \sqrt{2 g \cdot \frac{P}{\rho g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2P}{\rho}}
\]

Now, substituting \( v \) into the power equation:

\[
P = \dot{m} \cdot \frac{\left( \sqrt{\frac{2P}{\rho}} \right)^2}{2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P = \dot{m} \cdot \frac{\frac{2P}{\rho}}{2} = \dot{m} \cdot \frac{P}{\rho}
\]

Solving for \( \dot{m} \):

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{P \cdot \rho}{P} = \rho
\]

Thus:

\[
\dot{m} = 1000 \, \text{kg/s}
\]

Converting to mass flow rate in pounds per second (lbm/s):

\[
1 \, \text{kg/s} = 0.001 \, \text{lbm/s}
\]

\[
\dot{m} = 1000 \, \text{kg/s} \times 0.001 \, \text{lbm/kg} = 1000 \, \text{lbm/s}
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
