Okay, so I have this matrix A, which is a 2x2 matrix with entries 5,4 in the first row and 1,2 in the second. The question is asking for its eigenvalues. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which involves the determinant of (A - λI), where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

So, let me write this out. The matrix A - λI would be:

[5-λ   4    ]
[1     2-λ ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for eigenvalues. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc. Applying that here, the determinant would be (5-λ)(2-λ) - (4)(1).

Let me compute that. (5-λ)(2-λ) expands to 5*2 which is 10, minus 5λ minus 2λ plus λ². So 10 -7λ + λ². Then subtract 4*1=4, so the determinant becomes λ² -7λ +10 -4 = λ² -7λ +6.

Setting this equal to zero: λ² -7λ +6 = 0. To solve this quadratic equation, I can factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -7. Hmm, 6 and 1. So, (λ-6)(λ-1) = 0. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 6 and 1.

Now looking at the options, I need to find which pair matches this. The options are pairs of numbers. Option B is [6,1], which matches. So the answer should be B.

The eigenvalues of the matrix A are found by solving the characteristic equation. For the given matrix:

A = [[5, 4], [1, 2]]

The characteristic equation is:

det(A - λI) = (5-λ)(2-λ) - (4)(1) = λ² -7λ +6 = 0

This factors as (λ - 6)(λ - 1) = 0, so the eigenvalues are 6 and 1. Among the options, the pair [6,1] corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
