Answer:

Okay, I need to figure out which phrase in Singer's main argument is deliberately left vague. Let me read the premise again. The second part is: "If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so."

So the question is asking for the part that's vague. Let me break it down.

The sentence is structured as: If A, then B. So the structure is "If X, then Y." Now, looking for an adjective or word that's not clearly defined.

Looking at each option:

Option A: "it is" – that's part of the structure, not a phrase left vague.

Option B: "in your power" – this is an adjective describing "prevent." It's a key part of the premise.

Option C: "prevent" – it's a verb, and the phrase is part of the main verb. It's not vague.

Option D: "If it is" – again, part of the structure.

Option E: "it is wrong" – this seems like a statement. It's not vague in the way it's presented because it's a complete thought, but wait, is it vague? The original structure is "If X..., then Y." So the part that's not vague is "it is wrong." The second part is a complete thought, so maybe that's not the one.

Option F: "nearly as important" – this adverb is used to modify "as important," but it's a precise description. I don't think it's vague.

Option G: "from happening" – this is a phrase from the main clause, so it's part of the meaning and not vague.

Option H: "from happening" – same as above.

Option I: "something bad" – this is the object of the verb "prevent." Not vague.

Option J: "without sacrificing" – this part is "without sacrificing nearly as important," so "nearly as important" is a key phrase, making this part vague.

Wait, let me think again. The second part of the premise is "If you can prevent bad things without sacrificing nearly as important things, you should do so." So the part that's vague is "nearly as important." Because it's an approximation, so the statement is not as precise as it could be.

Alternatively, the structure is: If A, then B. So A is "in your power to prevent...", B is "without sacrificing nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so." So the part after 'it is' is "wrong not to do so." But that's a complete statement, not vague.

Wait, perhaps the part that's left vague is "nearly as important." Because it's not exactly "as important," it's an approximate. So the intended meaning is that you can't sacrifice more than as important, so it's an approximation, making the statement not as precise.

So the answer should be F: "nearly as important."

The phrase that is deliberately left vague is "nearly as important." This is because it's an approximation of the intended meaning, making the statement less precise. The other options either directly contribute to the structure or are not part of the vague element.

Answer: F
