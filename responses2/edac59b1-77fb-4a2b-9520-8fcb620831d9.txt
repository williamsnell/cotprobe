Okay, so I've got this question here about critical legal theorists and what they'd reject, right? Let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my law, but I'll try to piece this together.

First, I need to understand what critical legal theory is. From what I remember, critical legal theories focus on the social and political dimensions of law, challenging the idea that law is purely objective. They argue that law is shaped by power dynamics, cultural factors, and historical context. So, they probably reject the notion that law is stable or that it's always determinate.

Now, the question is asking which proposition would be rejected by critical legal theorists. The options are A to E.

Option A: Law is unstable. Hmm, critical theories would likely reject this. Because if law is unstable, it can't really be considered a stable system. Critical theorists emphasize that law isn't fixed but is instead a product of various social and political forces. So A might be a candidate.

Option B: Law is determinate. That sounds about right for critical theories. They argue that law isn't fixed; it's determined by power structures and other factors. So B would be rejected.

Option C: Law reflects economic power. Critical theories do accept this, I think, because they look at how different powers influence laws. So C might not be the answer.

Option D: Law is politics. Critical theories do accept this, as they see law as a social construct influenced by politics. So D is probably not the answer.

Option E: Law is a social construct. Wait, critical theories do accept that law is shaped by social factors. So E would be more in line with their view than rejecting it. Wait, but let me double-check. Critical theory might see law as a social construct, so E would be part of their framework but not a rejection.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is which proposition would be rejected. So the propositions that are part of critical theory would be accepted, and those they'd reject are the ones that are not part of their framework.

So, for example, option B (Law is determinate) is part of critical theory, so they'd accept it. Option A (Law is unstable) is also part of critical theory; they'd reject it because law isn't stable but is shaped by various factors.

Options C, D, and E are all parts of critical theory. So the only one that's not part of their framework is B. Wait, but the question is about what they'd reject. So the propositions that critical theorists would reject are those that are not part of their view.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it differently. Critical legal theory tends to reject the idea that law is a fixed, objective system. Instead, it sees law as a product of power, culture, and history. So they would reject propositions that suggest law is stable or that it's fixed.

Looking again at the options:

A: Law is unstable. This is what critical theory would reject because law isn't stable; it's a dynamic system. So A would be rejected.

B: Law is determinate. Critical theory rejects this because it's not fixed; instead, it's determined by various factors.

C: Law reflects economic power. Critical theory does accept this, as it's about how power influences law. So C is not a rejection.

D: Law is politics. Critical theory does accept this, as it's a social construct influenced by politics.

E: Law is a social construct. Critical theory would accept this as well. So E is part of their framework, not a rejection.

Thus, the propositions that critical legal theorists would reject are A and B. But wait, the question is which one would be rejected. The options are individual propositions, not pairs. So the question is asking which of the four is a proposition that's rejected.

Wait, no. Wait, the options are A to E, each being a statement. The question is, which of the following propositions would be rejected by critical legal theorists.

So, from what I've deduced, options B and A are propositions that critical theorists would reject. But looking at the options, the options are A to E, each being a single statement. So the question is which one is a proposition that's not part of their view.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. The question is, which of the propositions would be rejected by critical legal theorists. So the propositions they'd reject are those that they don't accept.

Which propositions are not part of critical theory's view? So, for example, A and B are propositions that critical theory would reject, but the answer options are individual statements. The question is asking which proposition would be rejected. So the answer is either A or B.

Wait, but the options are A through E, each a different proposition. So the question is, which of these four is rejected by critical theorists.

Wait, but the correct answer is B. Because critical theory rejects determinate law. So the answer is B.

The correct answer is **B: Law is determinate**. Critical legal theory rejects the idea that law is fixed and stable, emphasizing its instability and dependence on various social and political factors. 

Answer: B
