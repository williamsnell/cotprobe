Okay, so I've got this economics question here about equilibrium price and quantity when demand and supply both change. Let me try to figure this out. 

The question says that the demand for a product falls, and the supply increases at the same time. I need to determine how this affects the equilibrium price and quantity.

Hmm, I remember that equilibrium is where supply equals demand. So if demand decreases, that usually leads to lower prices and lower quantities, right? But wait, what happens when supply increases? I think that would cause prices to go up because more is available. But since both are happening together, I need to think about how they affect each other.

So, let's break it down. First, the demand curve shifts to the left because demand is falling. The supply curve also shifts to the right because supply is increasing. Equilibrium occurs where these two meet.

When demand decreases (left shift), the demand curve moves left. If supply increases (right shift), the supply curve moves right. So the new equilibrium will be somewhere in between. But where exactly?

I think when both happen, the quantity could either increase, decrease, or stay the same, depending on the relative shifts. Wait, but in this case, the decrease in demand is enough to lower the quantity, but the increase in supply might raise it. Or do they offset each other?

Wait, the demand is falling, so the new demand curve is to the left. The supply curve is to the right. So the new intersection point will depend on which effect is stronger. But in the question, since both are happening, I'm not sure which effect dominates.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the demand decrease leads to a lower price and lower quantity. The supply increase leads to a higher quantity and higher price. But the new equilibrium is where these two meet again.

Wait, but if demand is dropping, the equilibrium price goes down, but supply is rising, so the quantity goes up. But depending on whether the demand decrease is enough to overcome the supply increase, the equilibrium quantity might go up or down. Hmm, but since the question says both are changing, I'm not sure if the quantity remains the same or changes.

Wait, let's think of a specific example. Suppose initially, equilibrium is at P1 and Q1. Now, demand decreases to D1 and supply increases to S1. The new equilibrium is at P2 and Q2. 

If the demand decrease is stronger than the supply increase, P2 could be lower than P1, and Q2 could be lower than Q1. But if the supply increase is stronger, then P2 would be higher than P1, and Q2 higher than Q1. 

Wait, but in this question, the problem is that both are happening at the same time. So it's a simultaneous shift. So the new equilibrium's position depends on where the two shifts cross.

Alternatively, perhaps when demand decreases and supply increases, the equilibrium quantity could decrease if the decrease in demand is more significant than the increase in supply. Or the quantity could increase if the supply increase is more than the decrease in demand.

Wait, but the question is about what will happen without knowing the relative magnitudes. So the options suggest that the equilibrium quantity could stay the same, rise, fall, etc.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the demand decrease leads to a lower price and lower quantity. The supply increase leads to a higher quantity and higher price. But the new equilibrium is where these two meet again.

Wait, but if the demand decreases, the new equilibrium price is lower. If supply increases, the new equilibrium quantity is higher. So the equilibrium price would fall, and the quantity would rise. That would make option B correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because the question says that the demand decreases and supply increases at the same time. So let's imagine a scenario where demand drops, making the demand curve shift left, and supply shifts right. The point where these two meet is the new equilibrium.

So, the new price is lower than before, and the new quantity is higher than before. So, the equilibrium price falls, and the quantity rises.

Looking back at the options, option B says price falls and quantity rises. That matches what I just thought.

Wait, but is there any possibility that the equilibrium quantity remains the same? No, because both shifts are happening. If demand decreases, the quantity would tend to decrease. If supply increases, the quantity would tend to increase. So the net effect depends on which shift is stronger.

But the question doesn't give any information about the relative changes. So the correct answer must account for both possibilities. But the options don't have a scenario where both price and quantity change. So perhaps the correct answer is that the equilibrium price will fall and the quantity will rise. So option B is the correct choice.

When the demand for a product falls (shifts to the left) and the supply increases (shifts to the right) simultaneously, the equilibrium price and quantity are affected as follows:

1. **Equilibrium Price**: The decrease in demand leads to a lower equilibrium price.  
2. **Equilibrium Quantity**: The increase in supply leads to a higher equilibrium quantity.

Since the demand decrease and supply increase are simultaneous and independent, the equilibrium price falls, and the equilibrium quantity rises. This is reflected in **option B**.
