Okay, so I have this question about keyboard functions. The question is asking which of the options isn't a 'lock' function. The options are print lock, scroll lock, caps lock, and number lock. I need to figure out which one doesn't function as a lock.

Hmm, I remember that on a standard keyboard, caps lock is definitely a lock function. It's usually the top right button. When you press it, the keys below it shift. So caps lock is a lock.

Scroll lock, I think that's on the right side. It's like a circular cursor that you can move with the thumb and index finger. I've seen it on some on-screen text, so it must be a lock function too.

Number lock is on the right, near the top. When you press it, the lower half of the keyboard shifts. So number lock is another lock function.

The options are A to D. The question is which one is not a lock. So I need to find which is not a lock. Wait, all four are listed as options, but the question is which is not. The question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read it again.

"Which of these is not a 'lock' function on a standard desktop computer keyboard?" So the options are the functions themselves: print lock, scroll lock, caps lock, number lock. So the question is which one is not a lock function.

Wait, but all of those are lock functions except one. Oh, wait, maybe the question is a bit tricky. Because in reality, the number lock is a shift function, similar to caps lock. So perhaps the question is considering which isn't a lock function. So, number lock is a shift function, not a lock. Because a lock would stop shifting. So the number lock is a shift function, not a lock.

Wait, but the question says "not a lock." So the answer is D: number lock, because it's a shift function, not a lock. The other options are all locks.

So the answer is D.

The number lock is not a 'lock' function on a standard desktop keyboard, as it functions as a shift (or shift) function, not a lock.

Answer: D
