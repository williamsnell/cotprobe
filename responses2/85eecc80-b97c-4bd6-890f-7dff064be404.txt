Question:

A woman was the owner of a farm in fee simple. Thewoman left the farm in 1986 to move to the city. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. The man's nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it during his uncle's absence. When the man returned from his mother's home in 1999, he continued in possession until 2010 when the womanbrought an ejectment action. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. The court would most likely hold that

Options:

A: the woman was the rightful owner and thus entitled to possess the farm.
B: the man's nephew was entitled to possession, as he was the one who took care of the farm during the man's absence.
C: the man was entitled to possession, because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.
D: the man was not entitled to possession, as he left the property for a year.
E: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man had not paid any property taxes.
F: the man was entitled to possession, because he had lived on the farm for over 20 years.
G: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's absence for a year interrupted the continuity of his possession.
H: the man was entitled to possession, because the woman had abandoned the farm.
I: the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.
J: the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.

Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly answers this question about adverse possession. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

A woman owned a farm in fee simple. She left in 1986 to move to the city. Then a man took the land in 1987 as an adverse possessor. He stayed until 1997, then left for a year to care for his sick mother. The next year, he came back, and during that time, his nephew took over to care for him. When he came back in 1999, he continued in possession until 2010. The woman then sued him for ejectment. The state's statutory period is 20 years for adverse possession.

The question is which court conclusion is correct regarding the woman's right to possess the farm.

First, I need to understand the elements of adverse possession. Adverse possession generally requires that the possessor remains on the land for a statutory period (20 years in this case). The key here is that the man must have been on the land continuously for at least the full period. If he was on the land for less than that, he might not qualify.

Looking at the timeline:

- 1986: Woman left.
- 1987: Man takes over as adverse possessor.
- 1987-1997: Man stays.
- 1997: He leaves for a year to care for his mother.
- 1999: He returns, so he is on the land again from 1999-2010.

Wait, but during 1999-2010, the woman is still on the land. So the man's tenure is from 1987 until 1997 (9 years) and then again until 2010 (11 years). So total is 20 years? Wait that can't be. Wait, from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, and then from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. Oh wait, but 1999-2010 is 12 years, because 2010-1999=11, but he's on the land from 1999 to 2010, which is 12 years.

Wait, no, from 1999 to 2010 is 12 years. Because 2010 - 1999 = 11, but including both years, it's 12 years. So that's 10 years after 1997, meaning total of 20 years? Let me double-check the exact timeline.

Man leaves in 1997, goes to take care of his mother. Then he comes back in 1999. So from 1999 to 2010 is 12 years. So 1987-1997=10 years, 1999-2010=12 years. Wait, 1987 to 1997 is 10 years. From 1999 to 2010 is 12 years. So total is 22 years? That can't be right.

Wait, no. Because the man took over in 1987. So from 1987 until 1997 is 10 years. Then he leaves for a year (1997-1998), so that's one year. Then he comes back in 1999, so from 1999 to 2010 is 12 years. So total possession is 10 + 12 = 22 years, which is longer than 20. But the statute is 20 years. So does that make him an adverse possessor?

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's think of it as:

From 1987 to 1997: 10 years.

Then from 1999 to 2010: 12 years.

Wait, but the man was on the land during 1999-2010. So that's 12 years. Plus the prior 10 years. So total ten plus twelve is 22 years. So that would satisfy the 20-year requirement. So the man's total possession is 22 years, which is longer than 20, making him entitled.

But wait, the man left for a year in 1997, then went back in 1999. So in 1997-1998, he was not on the land. So that's one year without being present.

But for adverse possession, the man must be present on the land for at least 20 years. So let's see:

His time on the land is as follows:

1987-1997: 10 years.

1999-2010: 12 years.

Wait, that's 22 years in total. So the man's entire time on the land is 22 years. That's over 20, so he should be entitled. But wait, the problem says he left for a year (1997-1998). So he's not on the land during that year.

So the total time is 10 (1987-1997) + 12 (1999-2010) = 22 years. So that's more than 20, so the man is entitled. So the woman's case would be that he's an adverse possessor.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where the man is entitled. Let me check the options.

Options:

A: woman is rightful owner.

B: nephew is eligible.

C: privity between man and nephew.

D: man didn't pay taxes.

E: woman gets ejectment.

F: man lived over 20.

G: man's absence interrupted.

H: man's intermittent possession.

I: man's intermittent was insufficient.

J: man's possession was open, etc.

Wait, the question is about the court's holding. So the court would hold that the man was entitled to possess.

Wait, but the man left for a year (1997-1998). So perhaps the man was not on the land for 20 years. Because from 1997-1998, he was not. So the man's first continuous possession was 10 years (1987-1997). Then he stayed on the land again for 12 years (1999-2010). But the 20-year period must be continuous.

So the man's first period was 10 years, then a gap of a year, then 12 years. So during that 12 years, he was on the land, but not for the full 20. So the total for the 20-year period is 10 + 12 = 22, but the 20-year period must be a single continuous period.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire period as 10 (1987-1997) plus 12 (1999-2010) = 22, but that's not a single continuous 20-year period. So perhaps the man's continuous possession was 10 + 12 = 22, but he had a gap in between, so the 20-year period is not continuous. That would mean the man is not entitled because the required period must be continuous.

Wait, but the man's entire time is 22, but the period where he was on the land was in two separate periods. So the man did not possess the land continuously for 20 years. So he didn't meet the statutory period.

Alternatively, perhaps the man's continuous possession is only 10 years (1987-1997). Then he was on the land from 1999-2010, which is 12 years. But that's not continuous. So the man's continuous possession is 10 years, but the 20-year period requires more than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The man left for a year, so from 1997 to 1998 he wasn't present. So his continuous possession started again in 1999, but he's been there for 12 years. So the full 20 years would require him to be on the land from 1999-2018. But he was there from 1999-2010, which is only 12 years. Then, from 2010, he's gone, but the man's ownership ended when he returned in 1999. Wait, no. The man's return was in 1999, and he continued in possession until 2010. So, he was on the land from 1999-2010 (12 years). So from 1999-2010, which is 12 years, but the man left for a year in 1997 to 1998, so he was on the land from 1987-1997 (10 years) and 1999-2010 (12 years). So the total continuous possession is 10 + 12 = 22, but that can't be because that would require the man to be on the land for 22 years, which is longer than the 20-year period.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of the required period. For adverse possession, the holder must be on the land continuously for 20 years. The man was on the land from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), then again from 1999 to 2010 (12 years). But how does that fit into the 20-year period?

Wait, the man was on the land for 10 years from 1987 to 1997, then again from 1999 to 2010 (12 years). But that's two separate periods. So the man was on the land for 10 + 12 = 22 years, but that's not a single continuous 20-year period. So he didn't possess the land continuously for 20 years. Therefore, he wasn't entitled.

But wait, the problem says the man left for a year, then returned a year later. So, in 1997-1998, he wasn't there. So the 20-year period required would have to be a single continuous span. So the man's possession was 10 years (1987-1997) plus 12 years (1999-2010). But that doesn't form a single continuous period because he was not on the land in 1997-1998. So the man didn't have a continuous period of 20 years. Therefore, he wasn't entitled.

Wait, but the man was on the land in two separate periods. So the period from 1987-1997 is 10 years, then again from 1999-2010 (12 years). So, that's 22 years. But that's two separate periods, not continuous. So, the man was not on the land for a continuous 20-year span. Therefore, he wasn't entitled.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where the man is not entitled. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: woman is the rightful owner.

B: nephew is entitled.

C: man was entitled because of the privity between him and the nephew.

D: man wasn't entitled because he left for a year.

E: woman gets ejectment.

F: man was entitled because he lived over 20.

G: man's absence interrupted the period.

H: man was entitled because the woman had abandoned the farm.

I: man's intermittent was insufficient.

J: man was entitled because the possession was open, continuous, etc.

Wait, so I think the correct answer is J. Because the man's continuous possession was interrupted by a year. So the man was not on the land for a continuous 20-year period, hence not entitled.

Wait, but the man was on the land for 10 years and then again for 12. So that's 22 years. But the period has to be 20 years. So maybe the man's continuous possession is 20 years, but he didn't have it. So the man wasn't entitled.

Wait, but the man's first period was 10 years, then a gap, then 12. So when considering the 20-year period, the man's continuous possession began in 1987 and ended in 2010? No, because he was absent from 1997-1998. So he was on the land from 1987-1997 and again from 1999-2010. That's two separate periods. So the man was not on the land for a continuous 20-year period.

Wait, but the man's time on the land is 22 years, but that can't be considered for the 20-year period. So the man wasn't entitled.

But wait, let me look at the options again. The question is, "the court would most likely hold that..." So looking for which option is correct.

Option J says the man was entitled because the possession was open, continuous, and hostile as required.

But wait, the man's possession was interrupted by a year. So that's a gap. So perhaps the court would conclude that the man was not entitled because he wasn't on the land for a continuous 20-year period.

Wait, but the man was not on the land for a continuous 20-year period because he left for a year. So J says that the man's possession was open, continuous, and hostile. That suggests that the court would find that the man was entitled because the period was continuous. But in this case, it wasn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the court would hold that the man wasn't entitled because he was not on the land for a continuous 20-year period.

Wait, but the options are about the court's conclusion. So let me read the options again.

Option J: The man was entitled because the possession was open, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.

Hmm, but the man's possession was interrupted, so it's not open and continuous. So J's reasoning might not hold. So option J is probably incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the man was not entitled because he was not on the land for a continuous 20-year period. Therefore, the court would find that he wasn't entitled, but looking at the options, which one supports that.

Looking back, perhaps the correct option is D: the man was not entitled because he left for a year.

Wait, but I think the court might find that the man's possession was interrupted, so he wasn't entitled. But looking at the options, option D is about not being entitled because he left for a year. So the court would hold that he wasn't entitled.

But wait, the man had 22 years on the land, but that's not a continuous 20-year period. So perhaps the court would find that the man wasn't entitled, but the options don't have that as an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the man was entitled because he was present on the land for more than 20 years, but that's not the case. Because he was on the land for 22, but it was two separate periods. So the man's continuous period is 10 + 12 = 22 years, but that's not 20. So he wasn't entitled.

Wait, but another angle: the man was on the land for 10 years, then left for a year, then came back. So for adverse possession, the period must be continuous. So if he was on the land for 10 years, then not for a year, then for another 12, the 20-year period would have to be a continuous one. But the man's possession isn't continuous because he left for a year.

Ah, I think that's the key. So the court would find that the man was not entitled because his possession was interrupted. Therefore, the correct answer is D: the man was not entitled because he left for a year.

Wait, but let me think again. The man was on the land for 10 years, then left for a year, then again for 12. So the man's continuous period is 10 years. But the 20-year period needs to be continuous. So perhaps the court would find that the man's possession was interrupted, thus not entitled.

Looking at the options, option D says the man was not entitled because he left for a year. So that would fit.

Wait, but option H says the man was entitled because the woman had abandoned the farm. So if the woman abandoned the farm, then the man couldn't be on the land anymore. So that would make the man not entitled.

But in this case, the man was on the farm from 1987 to 1997, then again in 1999-2010. So he was on the farm for two separate periods of 10 and 12 years, but not continuous. So the man wasn't entitled.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the initial analysis again. The man was on the land for 10 years, then left for a year. So the man's first continuous possession was 10 years. But he didn't have that for 20 years. So the man wasn't entitled. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but perhaps the court would think that the man's continuous possession was 10 years, but the required period is 20. Therefore, he wasn't entitled, hence option D.

But another thought: the man was on the land for 10 years, then left for a year, so he can't have any continuous period of 20. So the court would find that the man wasn't entitled, and thus option J is incorrect.

Wait, looking at the options again. The correct reasoning is that the man's continuous possession was interrupted. So the court would hold that the man wasn't entitled because his possession was interrupted. Therefore, the correct answer is D: the man was not entitled because he left for a year.

Wait, no. The man left for a year, so he wasn't on the land for that time. So he wasn't on the land for a continuous 20-year period. Therefore, the court would say the man wasn't entitled to possess. So the correct answer is D.

But wait, another angle: the man's first continuous period was 10 years, and he was absent for a year. Then he came back again for 12 years. So the 20-year period would have to be a single continuous period. But the man's possession was interrupted, so he wasn't able to have a continuous 20-year period.

So the court would find that the man wasn't entitled, so option D is correct.
</think>

The correct answer is **D: the man was not entitled because he left for a year**.

### Analysis:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The woman was the rightful owner, not the man.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The man's nephew was not eligible due to the man's absence.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There was no legal basis for the man's intermittent possession.
- **Option D**: Correct. The man was not entitled because he left for a year, interrupting his continuous possession required for adverse possession.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The woman would not eject the man for not being an adverse possessor.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The man's absence did not meet the statutory period.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The absence did not interrupt the necessary continuous period.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The absence did not mean the woman abandoned the farm.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The man's intermittent possession was insufficient.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The man's possession was interrupted, not continuous.
- **Option K**: Incorrect. The man's possession was not continuous for the required 20 years.

The court would find that the man was not entitled to possess the land continuously for the required period of 20 years due to his absence for a year.
