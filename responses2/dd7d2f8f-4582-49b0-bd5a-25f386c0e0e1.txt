Okay, so I've got this question about a writer and their focus on how workers react to the characteristics of bureaucracies. I'm a bit rusty on my management theory, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which writer specifically looked at how workers react to things like bureaucracy, efficiency, or other key characteristics. The options are Marx, Lewin, Mayo, Maslow, Freud, Weber, Durkheim, Gouldner, Merton, and Taylor.

I remember that there's a lot of different management theories. Let me think about each one. 

Marx was more about class struggle and revolutionary theories, not so much on human behavior in institutions. So I don't think he's the right answer here.

Lewin, on the other hand, I recall studying his work in the context of management and hierarchy. He had a lot of work on how management styles affect workers. Maybe he talked about how bureaucracy might lead to inefficiency or conflict with workers.

Mayo's work was about work, but I'm not sure if he focused specifically on the human side of bureaucracy. Maybe his theories were more about the process rather than the human reaction.

Maslow's theory was about hierarchy and self-actualization, more about employee development than the reaction to bureaucracy.

Freud was more into psychology of habit and idealization, so probably not relevant here.

Weber's theories were about management and leadership, focusing on authority and control, not how workers would react to structures.

Durkheim's theories were about socialization and identity. He discussed how people conform to social norms, which might tie into the reaction to bureaucracy as a social structure.

Gouldner is more about leadership and management styles, perhaps, but I'm not sure about his focus.

Merton's theory is about the hierarchy of authority and how people take on roles based on their status. So he might discuss how people's roles and expectations relate to the bureaucracy, but I'm not certain if he specifically focused on workers' reactions.

Taylor's theories are about leadership and how leaders perceive hierarchy. I think he might have talked about how leaders assess authority and how that affects their effectiveness.

Wait, the question is about the writer concerned with the reaction of workers to key characteristics of bureaucracies. So maybe it's about how workers react in terms of their experiences in the system.

Lewin's work on leadership styles and how they affect employee behavior has implications for how workers react to structures. He might have discussed the impact of bureaucracy on productivity and maybe the negative reactions workers might have.

Durkheim's theory of identity and socialization might explain how workers interact with and react to the bureaucratic structures. He talked about how people conform to social norms, which could tie into how workers feel about the system.

Wait, but which is it? I think both Duration and Lewin are relevant, but maybe the answer is Lewin because he's known for leadership theories, but also for his work on work processes and bureaucracy.

Alternatively, Merton's theory is about the hierarchy and role structures in organizations. His work might discuss how employees perceive the bureaucratic structure and how that affects their roles.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the question again. It's about the writer who focused on how workers react to the characteristics of bureaucracies. So perhaps it's about the workers' perspective on how the bureaucracy functions.

I think Lewin's "Management and Leadership" book is a good place to look. He discussed the role of leadership styles and how they affect workers. For example, he might have talked about how certain leadership styles can lead to bureaucratic structures that are inefficient or lead to conflicts with workers.

Alternatively, Merton's "The Organization of Behavior" might have covered how people perceive and react to hierarchical structures, including bureaucracy.

Wait, I remember that Lewin's work was more about the process of management and how leadership styles can shape the work environment. So maybe he's the one who focused on the human side of how workers react to the bureaucracy.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, Durkheim's theory of socialization might be more about the societal aspect of how people form their opinions about the system.

Hmm. Another angle: which of these wrote a book that is a classic in management theory, focusing on leadership, bureaucracy, and worker reactions.

Wait, Taylor's work is about leadership and perceived hierarchy. He might discuss how the structure affects the effectiveness of leadership.

Merton's work, "The Organization of Behavior," does discuss hierarchical structures and how people assign roles based on their social status. So Merton's theory might explain how workers perceive the bureaucratic structure and how that affects their work.

Alternatively, Lewin's "The Management of Work" deals with how workers are organized and worked, including aspects of hierarchy and efficiency, which would relate to the reaction of workers to the bureaucracy.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option:

- Marx: Not relevant. His stuff is more about classes and revolution.

- Lewin: His work on management and leadership, process, and how leadership styles affect work. So he's probably the one who wrote about how workers react to the structure of bureaucracy.

- Mayo: Her work is about the process of working, more about the mechanics of work, less about the human reaction.

- Maslow: Focuses on psychological needs, not about how people react to structures.

- Webers: He's more about hierarchy and authority, not about how people react.

- Weber: Also about work and hierarchy, but again, not the focus on workers' reactions.

- Durkheim: His work is about socialization, identity, and deviance. So how people fit into society, which might tie into how they react to the bureaucratic structures.

- Gouldner: He's known for his leadership theories, perhaps about how leaders perceive structure.

- Merton: He's about hierarchy, authority, and the role of social status in organizations. So his theories might discuss how workers perceive the bureaucratic structure and how that affects their roles and, thereby, their reactions.

Taylor: He's about leadership and perceived hierarchy. So his theories would explain how the structure affects the effectiveness of leadership.

Wait, the question is about the writer whose work specifically looked at how workers react to the characteristics of bureaucracies. So perhaps it's either Lewin, Merton, or Taylor.

Alternatively, another approach: think of the theories that discuss how people react to and interact with organizations, including the bureaucratic structures.

Lewin's work: "Management and Leadership" is a classic. He discussed the role of leadership, how leaders influence the work environment, and the impact of structures on productivity. So he'd be looking at how workers react to the way the system is set up, perhaps leading to inefficiencies or conflicts.

Merton's "The Organization of Behavior" is more about the social and psychological aspects. He discussed how people perceive and assign roles based on their status, their social background, etc. So he might have analyzed how the bureaucratic system affects worker perceptions and reactions.

Taylor's "On Leadership" is about how leaders perceive and assign roles, which affects the effectiveness of their leadership. So Taylor's work is about how the structure affects the leader's perception.

So the question is asking which writer focused on the workers' reaction, not the leaders'. So it's probably between Merton and Taylor.

Merton's work on hierarchy and authority is about how people perceive and interact with the system. He might have examined how the structure of the bureaucracy affects workers' roles and their reactions to it.

Taylor's work is more about how the leaders perceive the structure, which in turn affects how the system is perceived by the workers.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember which of these is more about the human factor. Merton's work is about the social and psychological aspects, so it would definitely include how workers react. Taylor is about the leadership's perception of structure, which would affect how the workers perceive it. 

Alternatively, perhaps both Merton and Taylor are related in that they both look into how structures influence people, but the question is about the writer's focus on the workers' reaction.

Wait, the question is specifically about how workers react to the characteristics of the bureaucracy. So it's about the workers' perspective.

In that case, Merton's work on the hierarchy and role structures might address how workers perceive the system and thus their reactions.

Alternatively, Taylor's work on perceived hierarchy would also affect how workers perceive the system.

I'm not sure. Let me think of another approach. Which of these theories is more about leadership and the impact on the work environment, which would relate to how workers react to the structure.

Lewin's work is about leadership, how leaders influence the work environment, and the impact on productivity. So he might discuss how the structure (bureaucracy) leads to inefficiencies or conflicts with workers.

Merton's work is more about the organization and how people perceive and assign roles based on their status. So he might explain how the structure affects workers' perceptions and thus their behavior.

Taylor's work is about how leaders perceive the structure, which affects how the system is used by the workers.

So the question is looking for the writer who focused on how workers react to the characteristics of the bureaucracy. So probably Merton, because he addresses the role and hierarchy within organizations.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's Lewin because he's known for the management of work and how leadership styles affect the work environment, leading to the types of reactions.

Another angle: the options include both Merton and Taylor, which are both about organizations, but Merton's work is about people's roles and how they are perceived.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is either Lewin or Merton.

Wait, another thought: The question is about the writer whose work focused on the human side of how the bureaucracy affects workers. So it's more about the reaction, the workers' experience.

In that case, it's Merton who developed the Merton model, which examines how people perceive and respond to organizational structures, including hierarchies and bureaucracy.

So the correct answer would be M: Merton.

Wait, no. Wait, another approach. The options include M: Merton and H: Gouldner.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try to recall.

I think the answer is Merton because his work is about the hierarchy and how people react to it, which includes the effect of the bureaucratic structure on workers.

Alternatively, Taylor's work is about how leaders perceive the structure. So perhaps Taylor's work is more about the leader's perception, which impacts how the system is perceived by the workers.

Wait, but the question is about the writer's focus on the workers' reaction to the characteristics of the bureaucracy. So if Taylor is about the leaders' perception, that might not directly address the workers' reactions.

So perhaps Merton is the correct answer because he looked at how people perceive and react to the structure, including the impact on their roles and behavior in the system.

So the answer would be M. Merton.
</think>

The question asks which writer focused on how workers react to the characteristics of bureaucracies. After considering each option, it's clear that Merton's work is the most relevant. Merton's theory examines how people perceive and respond to organizational structures, including hierarchies and bureaucracy. His work addresses how these structures influence worker perceptions, roles, and reactions. While Lewin's work delves into leadership and productivity, Merton's perspective on the psychological and social aspects of organizational structure makes him the best fit for the question.

Answer: M
