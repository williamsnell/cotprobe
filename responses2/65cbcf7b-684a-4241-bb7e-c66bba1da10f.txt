Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the aggregate demand curve. Let me think about what aggregate demand is and how it's formed.

I remember that aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy at a given price level. It's different from individual demand because it's summed across many people. So, how do we get it? I think it's done by adding up the individual demand curves for each good.

Wait, individual demand curves are usually plotted on a graph where the price is on the y-axis and quantity on the x-axis. Each curve shows how much a single firm is willing to buy at various prices. So if you have multiple firms, each with their own demand curve, adding them together would give the total demand for all goods.

So when you add the individual demand curves, you're either horizontally or vertically adding them. But wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Each firm's demand is a separate curve. The aggregate curve is the sum of all these individual curves. So it's a vertical summation of the individual demand curves. 

Wait, but what about the shape of the aggregate curve? I think it's downward sloping because as the price decreases, more people buy more. So the aggregate demand curve is a downward-sloping curve, which is a vertical summation of all individual demand curves.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not found by adding product demand curves. No, that's the opposite. The aggregate curve is found by adding.
Option B: Vertical summation. That sounds right. It's adding each individual curve.
Option C: Adds both horizontally and vertically. That doesn't make sense; each firm's curve is a separate point.
Option D: Horizontal subtraction. No, that's not how demand works; it's additive.
Option E: Horizontal summation of market demand. Wait, no, E is about supply. Aggregate demand is about summing individual demands, not just adding supply curves.
Option F: Vertical subtraction of market demand. No, that doesn't fit. Subtraction would be something else, like in competition models for Nash equilibrium.
Option G: Sum of supply curves. No, because aggregate demand is about demand, not supply.
Option H: Horizontal summation of firm demand. No, that's not it. Each firm's demand is separate.
Option I: Horizontal summation of market demand. No, that's still about supply.
Option J: Vertical summation of firm demand. Wait, each firm's demand is a separate curve; you add them together.
Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. If each firm's demand is a curve, then to get the aggregate, you add all the individual curves together. So the aggregate demand curve is a vertical summation of all individual firms' demand curves. So that would be option B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because sometimes, when aggregate demand is plotted, it's a horizontal sum, but no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a vertical summation when the other curves are horizontal. Or perhaps I'm mixing up vertical and horizontal summation in the sense of adding or subtracting.

Wait, another way to think: when you have multiple firms, their individual demand curves are all plotted on the same graph. To find the total demand, you add up all the quantities each firm is willing to buy at each price. So for each price, you take the sum of all the individual quantities. So it's a vertical summation, because for each firm, their demand is a separate curve, but when you add them, you're summing the quantities at each price.

Wait, no. I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify: each individual demand curve is a function of price and quantity. So when you add all individual curves, you're effectively summing all the quantities at each price. For each price level, the aggregate demand is the sum of all individual quantities. So the curve is formed by adding up all the individual curves.

So in terms of the options, option B says vertical summation of market demand curves. Wait, no. The market demand is the sum. So the aggregate demand curve is a vertical summation of the individual demand curves.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another thought: horizontally adding curves would be adding their x-values, which would give a new curve, but that's not how market demand works. The correct approach is to sum their y-values (quantity) for each x (price). So the aggregate curve is a vertical summation of individual curves.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: vertical summation of market demand curves. No, because each firm's demand is a separate curve. So you sum all of them. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but another option is I: horizontal summation of market demand. No, that's not it. It's about individual curves.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me take a step back. The aggregate demand curve is formed by adding up all the individual demand curves. So for each price level, you add up the quantities each individual firm is willing to buy. So each individual firm's demand is plotted as a curve, and their quantities are summed at each price. So it's a vertical summation.

So the aggregate demand curve is a vertical summation of individual demand curves. Looking at options, option B says vertical summation of market demand curves. Because each firm's demand is a market demand curve, adding them would give the aggregate.

Wait, but another thought. Each firm's demand is a separate curve. To get the total demand, you add all the individual curves. So yes, it's a vertical summation.

So the correct answer is option B.

The aggregate demand curve is formed by adding up the individual demand curves for all goods and services in an economy at a given price level. This involves summing the quantities each firm is willing to buy at each price, resulting in a vertical summation of all individual demand curves. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The aggregate demand curve is not found by adding product demand curves; it is a summation of individual curves.
- **Option B**: Correct. The aggregate demand curve is a vertical summation of market demand curves, as each firm's demand is a separate curve that contributes to the total.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The aggregate curve is not achieved by adding both horizontal and vertical summations.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Horizontal subtraction is not relevant to demand; it applies to supply and competition.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Horizontal summation refers to adding individual supply curves, not demand.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Vertical subtraction is not applicable to demand.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The aggregate curve is not based on supply curves.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Horizontal summation refers to combining firm demand, not market demand.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Horizontal summation of market demand does not apply.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Vertical summation refers to individual demand, not market demand.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as the aggregate demand curve is a vertical summation of market demand curves.
