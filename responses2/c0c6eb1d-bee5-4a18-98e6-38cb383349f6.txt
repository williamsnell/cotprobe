Question:

A general contractor about to bid on a construction job for an office building invited a carpenter and several others to bid on the carpentry work. The carpenter agreed to bid if the general contractor would agree to give the carpenter the job provided that his bid was lowest and the general contractor was awarded the main contract. The general contractor so agreed. The carpenter, incurring time and expense in preparing his bid, submitted the lowest carpentry bid. The general contractor used the carpenter's bid in calculating its own bid, which was successful. Which of the following best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter?

Options:

A: The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.
B: The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.
C: The carpenter has the necessary skills and experience for the job, hence the general contractor should award the subcontract to him.
D: The carpenter has incurred time and expense in preparing his bid, which obligates the general contractor to award the subcontract.
E: The carpenter's bid was the lowest among all the bids, hence the general contractor is obligated to award the subcontract.
F: The general contractor and the carpenter had a verbal agreement, which obligates the general contractor to award the subcontract.
G: The general contractor's main bid was successful due to the carpenter's low bid, hence the carpenter should be awarded the subcontract.
H: The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.
I: The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.
J: The carpenter has a legal claim to the subcontract because he was invited to bid by the general contractor.

Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. So the question is about contract law, specifically dealing with subcontracts and obligations. 

Okay, the scenario is that a general contractor is about to bid on a construction job for an office building. They invited a carpenter and several others to bid. The carpenter agreed to bid under a condition where his bid would have to be the lowest, and the general contractor had to be awarded the main contract. The general contractor agreed to this and then the carpenter submitted the lowest bid. The general contractor then used that carpenter's bid to calculate its own bid, which was successful.

The question is about which option best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position the subcontract to the carpenter. So the carpenter is arguing that the general contractor has to assign the carpentry work to them because they're getting the lowest bid, which benefits the general contractor.

Hmm, I remember that in contract law, when a subcontractor is awarded a contract, the general contractor is often obligated to assign the work to them, especially if they get the lowest bid. This is often due to a duty to meet the main contract requirements. So the general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with bidders, which might also lead to assigning the work to the lowest bidder.

Looking at the options, let's consider each one. 

Option A says the general contractor is obligated because the carpenter's bid is used in calculating the general's bid, and the carpenter is a beneficiary. This sounds relevant because the carpenter's bid is essential for the general's bid. So the general might have an obligation to assign to the lowest bidder, especially if that's a condition.

Option B suggests the carpenter relied on the general's conditional promise. But the carpenter's bid was used, not relied on. So maybe B isn't the best.

Option C talks about carpenter's skills, but that's more about experience, not a contractual obligation.

Option D says the carpenter's time and expense obliges the general. Time and expense might be a factor, but the problem is more about the obligation to assign, not just the cost.

Option E says the carpenter's bid was the lowest, hence the general has to assign. This seems similar to A, but E's premise is the carpenter was the lowest. But the issue is the general's obligation to assign, not the carpenter's contribution.

Option F mentions a verbal agreement. If that's the case, maybe general has to assign, but the question's scenario doesn't mention such an agreement.

Option G's reasoning is based on the carpenter's skills, but again, the main issue is the obligation to assign, not just the skill.

Option H talks about the general's duty to deal fairly. Fair dealing is an implied duty, which could apply to assigning work. So the carpenter's bid was used, perhaps the general has to follow through on the condition.

Option J says the carpenter has a legal claim because he was invited. That's more about the carpenter's rights, not directly an obligation.

So between A and H. 

H is about the general's duty to deal fairly. If the general uses the carpenter's bid, perhaps H implies that the carpenter must follow through, either by assigning or not. Alternatively, H could be more about not being forced to follow through when the general's condition is breached.

A is about the general's obligation to assign to the carpenter because of the carpenter's benefit.

Another point: The carpenter's bid being used could be seen as part of the general's obligation to assign. So the carpenter's bid was used to calculate the general's bid, which suggests the general has to assign. 

Wait, but the general's condition is that the carpenter's bid is the lowest, and if that's the case, the general has to be awarded the main contract. So the carpenter's bid was the lowest, which triggers the general to assign. But the carpenter's bid was used by the general, so the general has an obligation to assign the work to the carpenter.

So option H is about the general's duty to deal fairly, which might include assigning when the general's condition is met. So the correct answer would be H or A.

But wait, H is about the general's duty to deal fairly and in good faith, which could include assigning the work. So when the general follows the conditional promise, the general's duty to deal fairly might require them to assign the work to the carpenter because the general's conditions are met.

Alternatively, option A is about the general's obligation to the owner to assign because the carpenter's bid is a beneficiary. The carpenter's bid being used in the general's bid suggests the general has to assign, possibly to the carpenter as he's the lowest bidder.

I think the best answer is A or H. Let me think more.

The question is about the carpenter's position. The carpenter argues that the general must assign the job to him because he's the lowest bidder, which benefits the general. The general's condition is that the carpenter's bid is lowest and the general is awarded the main contract. So the general has an obligation to assign, which is one of the options.

Option A says the general has an obligation to the owner because the carpenter's bid is used in the general's bid, and the carpenter is a beneficiary. The general's condition includes assigning to the carpenter, which is why the carpenter is getting it. So A is about the general having an obligation to the owner to assign, which is a duty that includes the carpenter's benefit.

Alternatively, H is about the general having an implied duty to deal fairly, which might require the general to assign when the general's condition is met.

I'm a bit confused between A and H. Another angle: The carpenter's bid being used in the general's bid implies that the general must follow through on the condition, thus assigning the work. So the general's obligation is to assign, which is one of the options.

Option H is about the general's duty to deal fairly. If the general deals fairly and ensures that the lowest bid goes to the carpenter, that's an obligation.

So which is the best answer? The options are A, H, and possibly others.

Looking again at the options, H says the general has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general used in calculating its main bid to the building owner. So the carpenter's bid was used; the general is required to deal fairly with the carpenter, which would require the general to assign the job to the carpenter, as the general is following through on the condition.

So the best answer would be H.
</think>

The best answer is H because it directly addresses the general contractor's obligation to deal fairly and in good faith with bidders, which includes assigning the work to the carpenter when the general's conditions are met. 

Answer: H
