Okay, so I've got this question about Young's experiment. Hmm, I remember that Young's experiment involves interference patterns from two slits. The setup is with a light source, like a sodium vapor lamp, hitting the slits which are separated by some distance. The light then projects onto a screen, creating an interference pattern.

The question says that the student is varying the separation of the slits and notices that the interference pattern disappears when the slits are too far apart. Oh right, because if the slits are too far apart, the distance between them (d) is large, so the interference pattern (which is a diffraction pattern modulated by interference) might not show up anymore. Or wait, actually, for the interference pattern to disappear, maybe it's when the angular resolution of the eye is too low for the details to be resolved. Because if the slits are too far apart, the angular size of the slits would be too small, making them hard to distinguish. So the eye's angular resolution limits how close the slits can be for the pattern to be visible.

The student's eye has an angular resolution of 1 minute of arc. Wait, a minute of arc is 1/60 of a degree. So 1 arcmin is 1/60 degree. I should convert that into radians because calculations might be easier in radians. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So 1 minute is (1/60) * (π/180) radians. Let's compute that: π/(180 *60) = π/(10800) ≈ 0.000290888 radians.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Angular resolution is the smallest angle between two distinguishable points. The formula for angular resolution (θ) based on diffraction is given by the Rayleigh criterion: θ ≈ 1.22 λ / d, where λ is the wavelength, d is the slit separation, and θ is the angle in radians. Oh right, that's the formula I remember.

So the condition when the interference fringes just disappear would be when the angular size of the slits is less than the eye's resolution. So the angular size of the slits (θ) must be equal to the eye's resolution. Because if the slits are smaller than the smallest detail the eye can resolve, the interference pattern won't be visible.

Wait, but how do I find the angular size of the slits? Well, the setup is that the slits are 1 meter away from the screen. The distance between the slits is d, and the slit separation d is what we're trying to find. The interference pattern's angular spread is given by θ = λ * (D / d), where D is the distance from the slits to the screen. Wait, no, wait: the formula for the angular separation in a double-slit experiment is θ = λ D / (d * L), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In Young's experiment, the path difference between the two slits creates the interference pattern. The angular position of the maxima is given by θ = (m λ) / (d), where m is the order. But the angular spread (the width of the central maximum) is approximately θ ≈ λ D / d, where D is the distance from the slits to the screen. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. Oh, right, the angular separation (the angle between the maxima) is approximately (λ D) / (d) when D is much larger than d. So θ ≈ (λ D) / d.

So for the interference pattern to be just visible, the angle θ must be equal to the eye's resolution angle, which is 1 arcminute. So setting θ = λ D / d.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, no. Because when the slits are too far apart, the diffraction pattern can be observed, but interference can't. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that when the slits are too far apart, the interference pattern's angular spread is less than the eye's resolution. So the slits' separation (d) must be such that the angular spread is equal to or less than the resolving power.

Wait, let's get back. The Young's experiment's interference pattern shows fringes whose angular width is about θ ≈ (λ D) / d. For the pattern to just be visible, the angular spread must be at least equal to the eye's resolution. Wait, no. The interference pattern's angular spread (the central maximum) is such that if the slits are too far apart, the central maximum might not be visible because the diffraction pattern is too small. Or perhaps the angular resolution is about how well you can distinguish two points. So the eye can resolve two points when the angular separation between them is at least the resolution angle. So if the interference pattern's angular spread is less than the resolution, you can't resolve the fringes. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the condition for the interference fringes to just disappear is when the angular size of the slits (θ) is less than the eye's resolution. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. If the slits are too far apart (large d), then d is large, so θ would be smaller. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the formula I have is θ ≈ (λ D) / d. So θ is the angular spread of the interference fringes. When θ is smaller than the resolution limit, the fringes can't be resolved. So the condition is θ <= θ_0, where θ_0 is the minimum angle the eye can resolve (the resolution angle of 1 arcminute). So if θ is equal to θ_0, then the interference fringes just disappear.

So θ = λ D / d. So solving for d: d = (λ D) / θ.

Wait, but what's θ? It's the resolution limit, 1 arcminute. Let me compute this.

But wait, wait, sometimes in these problems, the angular resolution is given by the Rayleigh limit, θ ≈ 1.22 λ / d. So perhaps the correct formula is θ = (1.22 λ) / d. So when θ equals 1 arcminute, that's the condition.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, the wavelength λ. Sodium vapor lamp... I think the wavelength is around 589 nm, which is 589e-9 meters, which is 589e-9 meters.

D is the distance from slits to screen: 1 meter.

θ is 1 arcminute, which is 1/60 degree. So converting that to radians: 1 degree is π/180 radians. So 1 arcminute is (π/180)/60 radians = π/(180 *60) = π/(10800) ≈ 0.000290888 radians.

Wait, but the Rayleigh criterion formula uses θ = (1.22 λ) / d. So theta (in radians) equals (1.22 * lambda) / d.

So solving for d: d = (1.22 * lambda) / theta.

Wait, but wait, if we're using the Rayleigh formula, then:

θ ≈ 1.22 * λ / d.

So theta is 1 arcminute, which is π/(10800) radians.

So,

d = (1.22 * lambda) / theta.

Wait, wait, no. Let me be precise. The formula is θ = (1.22 lambda) / d.

So d = (1.22 lambda) / theta.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. When theta is the angular size of the source, or when you're considering the resolution. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is θ = (lambda D)/d, but I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The condition for the first diffraction minimum (the central maximum) in the double-slit experiment is given by θ = (m + ½) (lambda D)/d, where m is the order. The first maximum occurs at m=0, which would be the central maximum.

Wait, no, the central maximum is the m=0 case. The first maxima would be at m=1 or m=-1, but the central maximum is the main peak.

Wait, perhaps the angular spread of the central maximum is approximately (lambda D) / d. So the formula is theta ≈ (lambda D)/d.

So when theta is equal to the resolving power, the interference pattern just disappears.

Wait, but the resolving power is given by theta_res = 1.22 lambda / d (the Rayleigh criterion). So when theta_res is less than or equal to theta_0 (the eye's resolution), the pattern is not resolved.

Wait, no. Let me think about it another way. The condition for the interference fringes to be just visible is that the central maximum's angular spread is equal to the resolving power. So when theta (from the formula) equals theta_res.

So, theta = (lambda D)/d = (1.22 lambda)/d.

Wait, that can't be right. That would imply that (lambda D)/d equals (1.22 lambda)/d, which implies D=1.22, which can't be. So perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is theta = (lambda D) / d. So when theta equals the resolving power, the pattern just disappears.

So, let's proceed.

Given:
lambda = 589 nm = 589e-9 m.
D = 1 m.
theta_0 = 1 arcminute = 1/60 degree.

Convert theta_0 to radians.

1 degree = pi/180 radians, so 1 arcminute is (pi/(180 *60)) = pi/(10800) ≈ 0.000290888 radians.

Wait, but if the formula is theta ≈ (lambda D) / d, then setting this equal to theta_0 gives:

d = (lambda D) / theta_0.

Wait, substituting numbers:

lambda = 589e-9 m,

D=1 m,

theta_0 = pi/(10800) rad.

So:

d = (589e-9 * 1 ) / (pi/10800) )

Which is d = (589e-9 * 10800) / pi.

Compute 589e-9 * 10800 = 589 * 10800 * 1e-9.

589 * 10800 = let's compute that.

589 * 10,000 is 5,890,000. 589 *800 is 471,200. So total is 5,890,000 +471,200 =6,361,200.

So 6,361,200 * 1e-9 =6.3612e-3 meters, since 1e-9 * 1e4 is 1e-5. Wait, no, 1e-9 times 1e4 is 1e-5? Wait, no, 1e-9 * 1e4 = 1e-5. Wait, 1e-9 * 10000 = 1e-5, yes.

Wait, but 589e-9 * 10800 = (589 * 10800) * 1e-9.

So 589 * 10800 is 6,361,200.

So 6,361,200 * 1e-9 =6.3612e-3 meters (since 6.3612e-3 m is 6.3612 millimeters.)

Wait, so d =6.3612e-3 m / (pi/10800) )

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because d = (lambda D) / theta_0.

So, using theta_0 = pi/(10800) rad,

d = (589e-9 m * 1 m) / (pi/(10800)) )

Which is same as (589e-9 * 10800) / pi.

Compute 589e-9 *10800.

589 * 10800 = 6,361,200.

Multiply by 1e-9: 6,361,200 *1e-9 =6.3612e-3 meters.

So d ≈6.3612e-3 m / (pi) ≈6.3612e-3 / 3.1416 ≈ 2.025 mm.

Wait, wait, let me compute 6.3612e-3 divided by pi.

6.3612e-3 is 0.0063612 meters.

0.0063612 / 3.1416 ≈ approximately 0.002025 meters, which is 2.025 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.025 mm.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the slit separation \(d\) when the interference fringes just disappear, we use the condition that the angular spread of the interference pattern equals the angular resolution of the eye. The angular resolution of the eye is given as 1 minute of arc, which is equivalent to:

\[
\theta_0 = 1 \, \text{arcminute} = \frac{1}{60} \, \text{degree} = \frac{\pi}{10800} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The angular spread of the interference pattern in a double-slit experiment is approximately given by:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{\lambda D}{d},
\]

where:
- \(\lambda = 589 \, \text{nm} = 589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\) (wavelength of light),
- \(D = 1 \, \text{m}\) (distance from slits to screen),
- \(d\) is the slit separation,
- \(\theta\) is the angular spread.

At the critical point where the interference fringes just disappear, the angular spread equals the eye's resolution:

\[
\theta = \theta_0.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{\lambda D}{d} = \theta_0.
\]

Rearranging for \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\lambda D}{\theta_0}.
\]

Substitute the known values:
- \(\lambda = 589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\),
- \(D = 1 \, \text{m}\),
- \(\theta_0 = \frac{\pi}{10800} \, \text{radians}\).

\[
d = \frac{(589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}) \cdot 1 \, \text{m}}{\frac{\pi}{10800}} = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9} \cdot 10800}{\pi}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
589 \times 10^{-9} \cdot 10800 = 6,361,200 \times 10^{-9} = 6.3612 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now divide by \(\pi\):

\[
d = \frac{6.3612 \times 10^{-3}}{\pi} \approx 2.025 \, \text{mm}.
\]

Thus, the slit separation \(d\) when the interference fringes just disappear is approximately \(2.025 \, \text{mm}\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 2.025 mm**
