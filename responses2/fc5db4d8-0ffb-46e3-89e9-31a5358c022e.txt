Question:

A woman was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?

Options:

A: Yes, because the damages awarded are excessive and not substantiated by concrete proof of earning capacity.
B: Yes, because the plaintiff failed to prove that she would have definitely become a successful professional ballet dancer.
C: Yes, because the defendant has the right to challenge the amount of the award given by the jury.
D: Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.
E: No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.
F: Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.
G: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.

Alright, let's tackle this legal question. So, I'm trying to figure out whether the appellate court will reverse the verdict based on the issue of the defendant's right to challenge the jury's award. Let me go through the facts step by step.

The scenario is about a woman who was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, had several operations, and couldn't return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer. Her loss of coordination and constant headaches are noted as indicators of disability. She claims she's considered totally disabled. She had been training for years and, in the trial, argued that she was a bright student and didn't necessarily become a professional ballet dancer.

The defendant's case is that she might not have been successful, and the trial court allowed evidence about her lost earning capacity. The trial awarded $3 million, and the question is whether the appellate court will reverse this verdict.

So, the key issue here is whether the trial court's disregard for her earning capacity issue caused the award to be too high or not supported by evidence. The options are about whether the award was excessive or not based on the jury's decision.

I remember that in tort law, particularly product liability, when a plaintiff has an earning capacity issue, the court typically allows evidence relating to that. The concept of " mens rea" is about whether the plaintiff was capable of performing the work they were injured in. But in this case, the issue is whether the award is excessive, not whether the plaintiff was capable.

The trial court allowed evidence about the defendant's earning capacity, which is a type of injury to the plaintiff. But the question is whether the jury gave substantial proof that she would have been a successful professional ballet dancer. If the jury didn't find that she would have been successful, perhaps the award should be reduced because the plaintiff didn't prove she would have.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the award was excessive because the jury didn't prove earning capacity. That aligns with what I just thought. The award might be too high because the plaintiff didn't prove she would have been successful.

Option B says the plaintiff didn't prove she would have become a professional dancer. But the trial court allowed the earning capacity evidence, so perhaps the jury found she would have been successful, but maybe the award was still too high.

Option C says the defendant can challenge the award. Oh, wait, I think the standard here is that the plaintiff's capacity is addressed by the jury. If the jury doesn't find her capable, the award might be reduced. So C might not apply here.

Option D says the evidence didn't guarantee success. So, maybe the award was too high because she didn't prove she would have been successful.

Option E says the award is inviolate. But I think the trial court's decision about the evidence can be challenged if it's not fair or reasonable, but it doesn't make the award inviolate. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F suggests she can only collect for prior work. I don't think that's the case here; the issue is about earning capacity, which is a different part of the tort law.

Option G says the evidence wasn't precise enough. This relates to the lack of proof about earning capacity, but I'm not sure how that connects to the jury award being excessive.

So the key here is whether the trial court allowed the earning capacity evidence which, if not supported, causes the award to be too high. The trial court allowed it, but the jury might have reduced the award because the plaintiff didn't prove she would have been successful.

Therefore, the appellate court might reverse the verdict because the award was excessive. So the correct answer is A.

The appellate court likely reverses the verdict because the trial court allowed evidence about the defendant's lost earning capacity, but the jury's award of $3 million was deemed excessive. The award was excessive because the plaintiff did not prove that she would have become a successful professional ballet dancer. This issue falls under the concept of "mens rea," which concerns the plaintiff's ability to perform the work they were injured in. The jury's decision to reduce the award reflects this, as the plaintiff's lack of evidence supporting her future success leads to a higher award.
