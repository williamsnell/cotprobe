Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about converting the time it takes for light to travel 1 cm into a unit called a jiffy. I remember that a jiffy is defined as the time it takes for light to move a certain distance, probably 1 cm in this case.

The question gives me the speed of light as 3.0 × 10^8 meters per second. Right, because that's a commonly known value. So I need to find out how long it takes light to go 1 cm, and then convert that time into seconds because the options are in seconds.

Wait, let's break it down. First, I should convert the distance from cm to meters because the speed is given in meters per second. I recall that 1 cm is 0.01 meters, which is 1 × 10^-2 meters. Got it.

So, the formula for time is distance divided by speed. Time equals distance over speed. So I can plug in the numbers here. Time (t) equals 1 cm (which is 1 × 10^-2 m) divided by the speed of light (3.0 × 10^8 m/s).

Let me calculate that. 1 × 10^-2 divided by 3.0 × 10^8. Hmm, when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So 10^-2 divided by 10^8 is 10^(-2-8) = 10^-10. And 1 divided by 3 is approximately 0.333... So the time is approximately 0.333 × 10^-10 seconds. Oh wait, wait, because I initially thought about 1/(3e8) as 3.333e-10.

Wait, let me do the math step by step. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1e-2 m. Speed is 3e8 m/s. So time is 0.01 / 3e8.

Calculating that: 0.01 divided by 3e8. Let me compute 0.01 / 3. That's about 0.003333... So 0.003333...e-8? Wait no, because 0.01 is 1e-2, so 1e-2 divided by 3e8 is (1e-2)/(3e8) = (1/3) * (1e-2 / 1e8) )= 1/3 * 1e-10.

So 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. So 0.3333e-10 seconds. Alternatively, that's 3.333e-11 seconds. Wait, wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01. So 0.01 divided by 3e8 is 0.01/(3e8) = 0.00000000003333... So that's 3.333e-10 seconds. Hmm, or wait, 3.333e-10 is the same as 3.333 × 1e-10. But looking at the options, some have 1e-10, others 1e-11.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me write it as 1 cm is 0.01 meters. So, time is 0.01 m / 3e8 m/s.

Calculating 0.01 / 3e8: 0.01 is 1e-2. 1e-2 / 3e8 = (1/3) * (1e-2 / 1e8) )= (1/3) * 1e-10.

So that's roughly 3.333e-11 seconds. Because 1/3 is approximately 0.3333, so 0.3333e-10 is 3.333e-11. Oh wait, no. Wait, 1e-10 is 0.1e-9, so 0.333e-10 is 3.33e-11. So the time is approximately 3.33e-11 seconds.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option I is 3.3e-10, option J is 3.3e-11. So which is correct?

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the exponent calculation. Let me re-calculate:

Time t = 1 cm / speed of light.

1 cm = 0.01 m = 1e-2 m.

Speed of light c = 3e8 m/s.

t = (1e-2) / (3e8) = (1 / 3) * (1e-2 / 1e8) = (1/3) * 1e-10.

1/3 is about 0.3333.

So t = 0.3333e-10 seconds, which is 3.333e-11 seconds.

So that's approximately 3.3e-11 seconds. Looking at the options: option J is 3.3e-11, which is one of the choices.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are there any other factors? Like, is the speed in m/s, so the time is in seconds. So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option J: 1 jiffy = 3.3e-11 seconds.

To determine how many seconds correspond to one jiffy, we start by noting that a jiffy is defined as the time it takes for light to travel 1 cm. The speed of light is given as \( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). 

First, convert the distance from centimeters to meters:  
\( 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{m} \).

Next, use the formula for time:  
\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{m}}{3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}
\]

Simplify the expression:  
\[
t = \frac{1}{3} \times 10^{-2 - 8} = \frac{1}{3} \times 10^{-10} \, \text{s}
\]

Calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \):  
\[
\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
\]

Thus, the time is:  
\[
t \approx 0.3333 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{s} = 3.333 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:  
\( 1 \, \text{jiffy} = 3.3 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s} \).
