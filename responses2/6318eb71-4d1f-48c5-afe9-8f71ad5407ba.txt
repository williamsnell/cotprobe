Okay, so I have this accounting question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a company exchanging land for machinery. The appraised value of the land is $50,000, and its original cost is $20,000. They exchanged this land for machinery with a fair value of $55,000. The question is asking about the gain on this exchange, and the options are given from A to J.

I remember that when recording exchanges, the treatment depends on whether it's a capital or non-capital transaction. But more importantly for this question, the key here is to look at the difference between the fair value of the asset received and the fair value of the asset given up. Because if the fair value of the new asset is higher than the fair value of the asset being replaced, there might be a gain or loss.

Wait, let me clarify. The exchange is a type of asset exchange. In accounting, the gain or loss is calculated by comparing the fair value of the asset received to the fair value of the asset given up. If the fair value of the asset received is less than the fair value of the asset given up, there's a loss. If it's more, there's a gain.

So in this case, the company is exchanging land (which is an asset) for machinery. The land's fair value is $50k, and the machinery's fair value is $55k. The difference would be 55k - 50k = $5k. But wait, I think I might have to consider the original cost as well because in some cases, you have to account for the original cost. Or is that only for capital gains?

Wait, no. When determining the gain or loss in an exchange, the treatment depends on whether the asset being exchanged is capital (like land, machinery) or not. But if the exchange is between two capital assets, the gain is considered to be the difference between the fair value of the new asset and the fair value of the old one.

But wait, another point: in some situations, the difference is computed between the fair value of the asset received and the fair value of the asset given up. So here, the machinery is worth $55k, and the land was worth $50k. So the difference is $5k. So the gain would be $5k.

Looking back at the options, option B is $5,000. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again. In accounting, when you exchange an asset for another, you calculate the gain or loss based on the difference between the fair value of the asset received and the asset given. So here, the machinery is worth $55k, and the land was worth $50k. So the gain is $5k. So the correct answer is B.

The company exchanged land with a fair value of $50,000 for machinery with a fair value of $55,000. The gain on the exchange is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the land from the fair value of the machinery: $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000. Therefore, the gain is $5,000.

Answer: B
