C: 19, 23
D: 21, 23
E: 17, 19
F: 19, 21
G: 15, 19
H: 17, 21
I: 15, 17
J: 21, 25

Okay, so Gwen wrote a number pattern: 1, 5, 9, 13. I need to find the next two terms. Hmm, let's look at the differences between the numbers. 

From 1 to 5, that's +4. Then from 5 to 9, it's another +4. Oh, so each time, the pattern increases by 4. Wait, that seems consistent so far. Let me check: 9 to 13 is +4 again. Yep, so the common difference is 4.

So the pattern is 1, 5, 9, 13, and then the next two terms would be 17 and 21. Because 13 +4 is 17, and then 17 +4 is 21. So the next two terms are 17 and 21. Looking at the options, option F is 19, 21. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount.

Wait, no. Let me list them again:

Term 1: 1  
Term 2: 5 (1+4)  
Term 3: 9 (5+4)  
Term 4: 13 (9+4)  
Term 5: 17 (13+4)  
Term 6: 21 (17+4)

So the next two terms after 13 would be 17 and 21. So the options are looking for the fifth and sixth terms. Oh wait, but the options are A to J, each giving two terms. So I need to find the next two terms after the last given number, which is 13.

So after 13 comes 17 and then 21. So the next two terms are 17 and 21. Looking at the options, option F is 19, 21. Wait, no, F is 19 and 21. That can't be right because 13 +4 is 17, not 19. So I'm probably getting confused.

Wait another moment. Let me make sure. The sequence is 1, 5, 9, 13. Each step adds 4. So 13 +4 is definitely 17, and 17 +4 is 21. So the next two terms are 17 and 21. So looking at the options, the only option with 21 is option F (19,21) and maybe another. But none of the options have 17 and 21. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe the pattern is increasing by 4 each time. So yes, 1, 5 (1+4), 9 (5+4), 13 (9+4), so the next is 17 (13+4), and then 21 (17+4). So the next two terms are 17 and 21. Looking at the options, it's not present. Wait, options are A:17,23; B:19,25; C:19,23; D:21,23; E:17,19; F:19,21; G:15,19; H:17,21; I:15,17; J:21,25.

Wait, H is 17 and 21. So that's correct. So the correct answer should be H:17,21.

The pattern increases by 4 each time. The next two terms after 13 would be 17 and 21. Option H matches these values.

Answer: H
