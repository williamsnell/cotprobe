Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about field extensions and polynomials. Let me take it step by step.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. I need to determine if each is true, false, or not applicable, then match them to the given options.

Statement 1 says, "Q is an extension field of Z_2." Wait, Q is usually denoted as the field of rational numbers, right? But I think maybe the question meant F2, which is the field with two elements, often written as Z_2. Because Z_2 is the integers modulo 2, which is the smallest finite field. So Q is the field of rational numbers, which is an infinite field. An extension field of Z_2 would be a field that contains Z_2 and is larger. But Q is not an extension of Z_2 because Z_2 is a finite field, and Q is infinite. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. An extension field E of F is a field where F is a subfield. So Z_2 is a field. So Q is a field, and Z_2 is a subfield of Q? No, because Z_2 is the integers mod 2, which are 0 and 1. Q includes all fractions, so Z_2 is not a subfield of Q. Because in Z_2, the only elements are 0 and 1, but in Q, you have all the rationals, which are not just 0 and 1. So statement 1 is false because Q isn't an extension of Z_2. Wait, but maybe I got it wrong. Maybe I'm confusing the direction. Wait, no, fields are extension fields of smaller fields when the smaller one is a subfield. So if Z_2 is a subfield of Q, then Q would be an extension of Z_2. But that's not the case, because Z_2 includes only 0 and 1, which are integers, while Q includes fractions. So Z_2 is not a subfield of Q. Therefore, statement 1 is false.

Statement 2 says, "Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field." Oh, wait, that's a theorem. In field theory, the concept of an algebraic closure comes into play. Every field has an algebraic closure, which is an algebraic extension where every non-constant polynomial has a root. But the theorem statement here is about extension fields, not necessarily algebraic closures. So if the field is perfect, like Z_2 is a perfect field, then every non-constant polynomial has a root in the field itself. But if the field is not perfect (like finite fields like Z_2), then the polynomial might not have a root in the field but might require an extension field to have it.

Wait, no, the statement says "every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field." So regardless of whether the field is perfect or not, every non-constant polynomial will have a zero in some extension field. But wait, in a perfect field, the polynomial already has a root in the field. But if it's not perfect, does it require an extension? Hmm, no, because in any case, the field might have a root, but if not, you can take an algebraic extension where it does. So statement 2 is true because regardless of the field, every non-constant polynomial has a root in some extension field. Because if the field is algebraically closed, then every non-constant polynomial splits, but for a general field, you might need to extend it.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The theorem says that every finite field has an algebraic closure, which is a finite extension. But for an infinite field like Q, every non-constant polynomial has a root in its algebraic closure, which is an extension field.

So, statement 2 is true because every non-constant polynomial over a field will have a root in some extension field, whether that's algebraic or not. So statement 2 is true.

So, statement 1 is false (Q is not an extension of Z_2), statement 2 is true.

Looking at the options:

Option D: True, False.

So answer D is the correct choice.

The analysis of the statements reveals that Statement 1 is false because Q is not an extension of Z_2, and Statement 2 is true because every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
