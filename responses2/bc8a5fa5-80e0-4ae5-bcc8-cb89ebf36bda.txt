Alright, so I've got this question about information criteria and which statements are true. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question has four statements (i) to (iv), and I need to figure out which are correct. The options are combinations of these statements, labeled from A to J. Each option (A to J) is a combination of which statements are true.

First, I remember that information criteria are used for model selection. They help in deciding between different statistical models. The main ones are Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's (also known as Bayesian) Information Criterion (BIC). 

Let me go through each option one by one.

Statement (i): Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion. Hmm, adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It's used to penalize the number of terms added to the model. But is it considered an information criterion? Wait, information criteria are criteria that balance model fit and complexity. Adjusted R-squared is more about goodness of fit but doesn’t account for model complexity in the same way. So I think statement (i) is false. Because AIC and BIC are information criteria, not adjusted R-squared.

Statement (ii): If the residual sum of squares (RSS) falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall. Wait, the information criterion depends on the model's complexity, which is related to the number of parameters. As you add more terms, the model complexity usually increases. If the RSS (which is the sum of squared residuals) decreases, that suggests a better fit. So, if you have a model that's fitting better (lower RSS) but has more parameters, the information criterion might not necessarily decrease. Wait, but how does this relate to the model complexity? Let's think about the AIC and BIC formulas.

The AIC is given by AIC = -2 ln(L) + 2k, where k is the number of parameters. The BIC is -2 ln(L) + k ln(n), where n is the sample size. If adding a term (which increases k) and the RSS (which is related to -2 ln(L)) decreases, then the first term (-2 ln(L)) might decrease, but the second term (2k for AIC or k ln(n) for BIC) would increase. So whether the information criterion (AIC or BIC) would decrease depends on which term is more dominant. For example, if you add a term and the model becomes better (lower RSS), the AIC might go up because 2k increases, but BIC might go up less because it's only k times ln(n). Alternatively, if the model becomes worse (higher RSS), but it's just a question here, the statement says that the information criterion will fall. So if adding a term leads to lower RSS, then -2 ln(L) would go down. But if k increases, the information criterion (AIC and BIC) would go up because 2k and k ln(n) increase. So if the model becomes better (lower RSS), but adding more complexity (more parameters), the information criterion would go up. So for AIC, the effect is that the first term (which is good) is added, but second term (which is bad). So overall, the information criterion may not decrease. So statement (ii) would be false because the information criterion would not necessarily fall. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The question says "the value of the information criterion will fall". Does the model's RSS falling imply that the information criterion (which includes both) will fall?

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the information criterion decreases. So if you add a term and the RSS decreases, which is better, but the number of parameters increases. So for AIC, the 2k part increases, so the AIC would go up. So the information criterion (AIC) would not fall. So statement (ii) is false.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether adding a term (thus more parameters) and a better fit would affect the information criterion. Because if the model is better (lower RSS), it's a better fit, but it's more complex. So adding a term can make the model better, but it's less efficient in terms of parsimony. So for AIC, which penalizes more (2k) vs BIC (penalizes less). So in this case, the model becomes better, but the penalty for adding more complexity would be higher for AIC. So the overall information criterion would increase.

So statement (ii) says the value will fall. But it's the opposite; the value would go up. So statement (ii) is false. 

Wait, but I might be getting this mixed up. The information criterion is used to compare models. If a model has a lower AIC or BIC, it's preferred. So if the model becomes better (lower RSS), but has more parameters, the AIC would prefer less complex models. So the AIC would not prefer a better model with more parameters. So the information criterion (AIC) would go up, not down. So statement (ii) is false because the information criterion would not fall; it would go up.

Statement (iii): Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as Schwarz's information criterion. Hmm. So Akaike and Schwarz are two different information criteria. I think Schwarz's (BIC) tends to select models that are smaller (fewer parameters) compared to AIC. Because Schwarz's penalty is smaller (log n) vs AIC's 2. So AIC tends to overfit by selecting more complex models. So for example, Akaike's prefers a model with more parameters, but Schwarz prefers a model with fewer. So Akaike's information criterion would sometimes select a model with higher order than Schwarz's. So statement (iii) says that Akaike's models are at least as large as Schwarz's. So that's not correct. Because Schwarz tends to have smaller models. So (iii) is false.

Statement (iv): Akaike's information criterion is consistent. Consistent? No, wait. Consistent estimators are those where as the sample size increases, the estimator converges in probability to the true parameter value. Information criteria like AIC and BIC are used for model selection. They are not estimators, they are criteria. But in the context of model selection, if the true model is among the candidates, then as the sample size increases, AIC and BIC will select the true model with probability approaching 1. So Akaike's information criterion is consistent in the sense that in asymptotically large samples, it will select the correct model. So statement (iv) is true.

So let's recap the statements:

(i) Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion. → False.
(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls, the information criterion falls. → False.
(iii) Akaike's leads to model orders ≥ Schwarz's. → False.
(iv) AIC is consistent. → True.

So the only true statement is (iv).

Looking at the options, the options are combinations. So which options include only (iv)?

Looking at the options:

Option B: (ii) and (iii) only → Includes false statements.

Option A: (ii) and (iv) only → Only (iv) is true.

Option E: (i) and (iii) only → Both wrong.

Option B says (ii) and (iii) only—both false. So none of the options have only (iv). Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about statement (iv). Let me think again. Consistent. So if the true model is in consideration, in the limit as sample size goes to infinity, the probability of selecting it approaches 1. So that's consistent. So (iv) is true.

Looking at the options, the options include:

A: (ii) and (iv) → Only (iv) is true.

B: (ii) and (iii) → Both false.

C: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → All are wrong except (iv).

D: (i) and (iv) → (i) is wrong, (iv) is true → so overall, only (iv) is correct.

E: (i) and (iii) → Both wrong.

F: (i), (iii), and (iv) → (i) wrong, (iii) wrong, (iv) correct. So only (iv).

G: (i) and (ii) → Both wrong.

H: (ii), (iii), (iv) → (ii) and (iii) are wrong, (iv) correct. So only (iv).

So the true statements are only (iv). So which option includes only (iv)? Looking at the options:

Option A: (ii) and (iv) → No, because (ii) is false.

Option E: (i) and (iii) → No, (iv) is correct.

Wait, but the options are:

A: (ii) and (iv) only → Only (iv) correct.

E: (i) and (iii) only → (iv) correct.

So the only correct option is one that includes only (iv). So we're looking for an option where only (iv) is true.

Looking at the options:

Which options have only (iv)?

Looking at the list:

Option E: (i) and (iii) only → No, (iv) is correct.

Wait, none of the options have only (iv). Because all the options are combinations of two or more statements.

Wait, let me recheck: the question is which are true. Only (iv) is correct.

So the correct answer would be an option that includes (iv) and no other true statements.

Looking at the options:

Looking back at the options:

Option E: (i) and (iii) only → Both wrong.

Option B: (ii) and (iii) only → Both wrong.

Option A: (ii) and (iv) → (ii) wrong, (iv) correct. So only (iv) is correct.

Option E: (i) and (iii) only → Both wrong.

Option H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) → (ii) wrong, (iii) wrong, (iv) correct. So only (iv).

So the correct answer would be an option that includes only (iv). Looking at the choices, which one has only (iv)? 

Wait, the options are:

- E: (i) and (iii) only → Both wrong.
- H: (ii), (iii), (iv) → (ii) wrong, (iii) wrong, (iv) correct.

So the only correct option is H: (ii), (iii), (iv) only. Because only (iv) is correct, and the rest are wrong. But wait, H says (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. So how true is that?

Wait, earlier I thought statement (iv) is true. Let me think again about statement (iv): is Akaike's information criterion consistent? 

Yes, because as the sample size increases, the probability that Akaike's criterion selects the true model tends to 1. So (iv) is true. So which options include (iv) and none of the others.

Looking at the options:

Option H is (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. So (iv) is true. However, (ii) is false, and (iii) is false. So H is the only option where (iv) is true and the others are false.

But wait, let me check what the correct answer is.

Wait, the question is, which statements are true. So only (iv) is true. So the correct choice is the one that includes only (iv). Looking at the options, option H includes (ii), (iii), and (iv). So (ii) and (iii) are wrong, but (iv) is correct. So the correct option is H.

But wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake with statement (iii). Statement (iii) says Akaike's leads to model orders that are ≥ Schwarz's. So Akaike's tends to select more complex models than Schwarz. So Akaike's would have higher order (more parameters). So statement (iii) says Akaike's leads to at least Schwarz's? No, because Schwarz prefers fewer parameters. So Akaike's would prefer more parameters, so statement (iii) is incorrect. So (iii) is false.

So the only true statement is (iv). So looking for an option that includes only (iv). But in the options, is there such an option?

Looking at the options, option H is (ii), (iii), (iv) only. So (iv) is correct, and (ii) and (iii) are wrong.

So the correct answer should be H. But wait, let me double-check all statements.

Wait, statement (ii): if RSS falls, does that mean info criterion falls? No, because as I discussed, AIC and BIC tend to prefer less complex models when the RSS is getting better. So when adding a term and model becomes better, the information criterion (AIC and BIC) would go up, not down. So statement (ii) is false.

So the only true statement is (iv). So which option has only (iv)?

Looking at the options:

Option E: (i) and (iii) only → Incorrect. (iv) is correct.

Option H: (ii), (iii), (iv) only → (ii) and (iii) are wrong, only (iv) is correct. So this option is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is H? No, wait: the available options are A to J, and the options are:

A: (ii) and (iv) only → (ii) wrong, (iv) correct → overall only (iv) is correct.

B: (ii) and (iii) only → both wrong.

C: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → all false except (iv).

D: (i) and (iv) only → (i) wrong, (iv) correct.

E: (i) and (iii) only → both wrong.

F: (i), (iii), and (iv) only → (i) wrong, (iii) wrong, (iv) correct.

G: (i) and (ii) only → (i) wrong, (ii) wrong.

H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only → (ii) wrong, (iii) wrong, (iv) correct.

So the correct option is H, as it's the only one that includes only (iv) as correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake with statement (ii)? I thought that if adding a term improves the model (lower RSS), then the information criterion would not necessarily fall. So (ii) is false.

Wait, another perspective: the Akaike information criterion is used to compare models. It has a formula that includes the log likelihood and the number of parameters. The log likelihood can be expressed in terms of the sum of squared residuals. So, when the sum of squared residuals (RSS) decreases, the log likelihood increases. But Akaike's information criterion includes a penalty term (2k, where k is the number of parameters). So, if adding a term improves the model (lower RSS, better fit), then the log likelihood increases. But Akaike's formula includes a negative 2 times the log likelihood, plus 2k. So if you have a better model (lower log likelihood, but that's negative, so higher when you have a better fit), the first term (-2 log L) would decrease. The second term (2k) would increase. So whether the AIC goes up or down depends on whether the increase in 2k outweighs the decrease in -2 log L.

So if the model becomes better (lower RSS), but the number of parameters increases (k increases), then the AIC would tend to prefer the model with more parameters if the increase in 2k is larger than the decrease in -2 log L. So (ii) statement is saying that if the model improves (RSS falls), the AIC would fall? No, because the AIC tends to prefer more complex models when the model is actually better. So (ii) is incorrect.

So, correct statement is only (iv) is true. So the option that includes only (iv) is H.

Looking at the options, H is option H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options are:

A: (ii) and (iv) only → includes (iv) which is correct, but (ii) is wrong.

B: (ii) and (iii) → both wrong.

C: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → all wrong except (iv).

D: (i) and (iv) → (i) wrong, (iv) correct.

E: (i) and (iii) → both wrong.

F: (i), (iii), and (iv) → (i) wrong, (iii) wrong, (iv) correct.

G: (i) and (ii) → both wrong.

H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) → (ii) wrong, (iii) wrong, (iv) correct.

So the correct option is H, because it includes (iv) as correct and the others as incorrect.

Wait, but I thought the correct answer is H. But I thought the options were given as H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. So the correct statement is only (iv) is correct. So the answer should be option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one is correct? Let me check.

The options are A to J, each a combination of statements. So the correct option is H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. Because only (iv) is correct, the others are wrong. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The correct answer is H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Statement (i):** Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion.  
   **Analysis:** Adjusted R-squared is a modified R-squared that penalizes the number of predictors. It is not an information criterion like Akaike's (AIC) or Schwarz's (BIC).  
   **Conclusion:** False.

2. **Statement (ii):** If the residual sum of squares (RSS) falls, the value of the information criterion will fall.  
   **Analysis:** Adding a term (model) can improve model fit (lower RSS), but AIC and BIC penalize more (2k for AIC, k ln(n) for BIC). Thus, the information criterion may not decrease; it might increase.  
   **Conclusion:** False.

3. **Statement (iii):** Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as Schwarz's information criterion.  
   **Analysis:** Schwarz's criterion prefers fewer parameters, while AIC prefers more. Thus, AIC tends to select more complex models.  
   **Conclusion:** False.

4. **Statement (iv):** Akaike's information criterion is consistent.  
   **Analysis:** Consistency means that as sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true parameter. AIC's penalty (2k) is larger than Schwarz's (k ln(n)), so it's more likely to select the true model as sample size increases.  
   **Conclusion:** True.

5. **Option Analysis:**  
   - **A: (ii) and (iv) only** → (ii) is false, (iv) is true. Incorrect.  
   - **B: (ii) and (iii) only** → Both are false. Incorrect.  
   - **C: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) only** → All false except (iv). Incorrect.  
   - **D: (i) and (iv) only** → (i) is false, (iv) is true. Incorrect.  
   - **E: (i) and (iii) only** → Both are false. Incorrect.  
   - **F: (i), (iii), and (iv) only** → (i) is false, (iii) is false, (iv) is true. Incorrect.  
   - **G: (i) and (ii) only** → Both are false. Incorrect.  
   - **H: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only** → (ii) and (iii) are false, (iv) is true. Correct.

Thus, the correct answer is **H**.
