Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about life insurance premiums. The question is asking about the difference in annual premiums for a $10,000 20-payment life policy bought at age 30 versus age 20. The options are A through J, with various amounts.

Hmm, I remember that life insurance premiums depend on several factors, including the age of the policyholder. Generally, the older you are, the higher your premiums might be because you're taking on more risk. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship.

Wait, another thought: The cost of insurance can vary with the age of the policyholder. As you get older, the probability of death increases, so the insurance company might charge more because they're covering more scenarios. So a higher premium makes sense for an older policyholder.

But how much higher? I think I remember something about the term structure of life insurance. The older you are, the higher the premiums. But without specific numbers, I might need to make an educated guess based on typical life insurance formulas or tables.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the present value of the future payments. Since it's a 20-year policy, the payments are spread over 20 years. The older the person, the longer the time until death (assuming they live longer), which might mean the payments are spread over a longer period, thus lower annual expenses in the beginning but higher in later years. But I'm not sure how that translates to the annual premium.

Wait, another angle: Maybe there's a table or formula that relates the premium to the age. I think the premium for a life insurance policy can be calculated using factors like the mortality table, which gives the probability of death at each age. But I don't remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, I might think about the difference in the expected value of the policy. At a younger age, the policy pays out more in the future, which might have a higher present value. So, the premium would be higher because the expected payout is higher. But wait, no, because the policy is the same $10k. Oh wait, the policy amount is the same, so the difference comes from the time value of money and the probability of death.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of discounting. The older the policyholder, the higher the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future payments. So, the higher the discount rate, the higher the present value, which means the premium would be higher because the present value is higher.

But how much higher? For example, if at 30 the discount factor is higher than at 20, then the present value of the future $10k payout would be higher, making the premium higher. So the premium at 30 would be higher than at 20.

But I'm trying to recall specific numbers. I think the difference in the annual premium for a 20-year life policy between age 30 and 20 is about $35.50. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I might have heard it's around $40 or so.

Alternatively, I remember that the annual premium for a 20-year term life insurance for a person at age x is roughly (x/100) * 3500 or something. Wait, that seems off. Let's see: If x is 30, then 30/100 = 0.3, 0.3*3500=1050. But that's way higher than the options given, which are in the hundreds of dollars but way lower.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Maybe the premium is calculated based on the mortality table and the life expectancy. For a 30-year-old, the life expectancy is higher than at 20. So the policy is more likely to pay out over a shorter period, meaning the premium might be higher.

Alternatively, I think the premium is calculated using a formula that involves the future value of the policy. Wait, perhaps the difference between the two ages affects the expected payout amount. So for a 20-year policy, someone at 30 has a higher chance of living longer, so the expected payout is higher, making the present value higher, hence higher premium.

But without the exact numbers, it's a bit tricky. I think the correct answer is C: $35.50. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, another approach: Looking at life insurance tables, the premium for a 20-year term at age 30 is higher than at age 20. So the difference might be around $40 or $35, which would correspond to option C or G.

Wait, I think the exact difference is around $35.50. So option C would be correct.

The question asks for the difference in annual premiums for a $10,000 20-year life policy purchased at 30 years of age versus 20 years of age. 

To determine this, we consider factors like the age affecting mortality and the time value of money. Typically, older policyholders face higher premiums due to increased risk and longer expected payout periods. 

After evaluating possible interpretations and recalling typical life insurance premium structures, the correct answer is that the difference is approximately $35.50. This corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
