Okay, so I've got this question about a sales commission. Let me try to figure it out. The question says the salesman gets a 1.5% commission on all sales. I need to find out how much his income would be if he sold $54,600 worth of shoes in a month.

Hmm, I remember that commission is a percentage of the total sales. So, I should calculate 1.5% of $54,600. Let me think about how to do that. 

First, I can convert 1.5% to a decimal. To do that, I divide by 100. So, 1.5 divided by 100 equals 0.015. 

Now, I need to multiply this decimal by the total sales amount. That would be 0.015 multiplied by $54,600. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, maybe I can break it down. 1% of $54,600 is 546 because 1% is 1/100. So, 1.5% would be 546 multiplied by 1.5. 

Alternatively, 0.015 times 54,600. Let me do the math step by step. 

54,600 multiplied by 0.015. 

I think I can compute 54,600 * 0.01 first, which is 546. Then, 0.005 times 54,600 is 273 because 54,600 * 0.005 is 273. 

Wait, no, 0.005 is the same as 5 thousandths. So 54,600 divided by 200 is 273. Because 54,600 divided by 200 is 273. 

So adding 546 and 273 gives 819. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check. 1.5% of 54,600.

Alternatively, I can compute 54,600 * 1.5% as (54,600 * 1.5) / 100. So, 54,600 * 1.5 is 81,900. Then, divide that by 100, which is 819. Oh, so that's 819.

Looking at the options, option I is $819. So the answer should be I.

The commission is 1.5% of $54,600. Converting 1.5% to a decimal gives 0.015. Multiplying 0.015 by 54,600 yields 819. 

Answer: I: $819
