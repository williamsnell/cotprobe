Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a legal situation involving a debtor and a creditor, including a statute of limitations issue. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario: A debtor owes a creditor $12,000 under a promissory note. The statute of limitations says the suit had to be filed by September 30 last year. So the deadline is in 2022, right? Now, on June 1 of this year, the creditor receives a letter from the debtor saying he'll pay $5,000 on July 1 to settle what he owes. But the debtor didn't pay on July 1. Then, on August 1, the creditor brings suit against the debtor, and the debtor asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. They refuse to pay anything. The question is, what does the creditor have to do?

Wait, so the key points are:
1. The statute of limitations is August 1, 2022.
2. The debtor failed to pay the $5,000 on July 1, which is before the deadline.
3. The creditor is suing on August 1, same date as the deadline.
4. The debtor is suing for the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. So, the creditor can't collect the $5,000 because they're asserting the limitation. But wait, no, because the statute of limitations is set on the debtor's side. So, the creditor is trying to collect the full amount, but the debtor's inability to pay is making them lose the right to collect any part of it.

Wait, no. Because the statute of limitations is for the debtor to collect their debt. So if the creditor sues the debtor, they're trying to force the debtor to pay. But the debtor is suing for the limitation itself. So, the creditor can't get any payment because they're suing on the debtor's behalf, asserting the limitation. So the creditor would lose the right to collect anything, including the $5,000, because they're asserting the limitation.

Wait, but the question is whether the creditor can recover anything. So, the debtor failed to pay the $5,000 on time, so the creditor can't get that. But if the statute of limitations hasn't expired, the creditor can't force the debtor to pay the full amount. So the creditor can't seek the full $12,000 because the debtor is suing for the limitation. So they can't get anything, which would make option G correct? No, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the statute of limitations is for the debtor to collect their debt. So, the creditor can't get anything on that. But the debtor is suing for the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense, meaning the creditor can't enforce the limitation. So the creditor's only options are to collect the debt, but they can't because the debtor is suing for the limitation. So, the creditor is not entitled to anything against the debtor. So that would be option G: "The creditor is not entitled to anything, due to the statute of limitations expiring."

But wait, another angle: The statute of limitations is about the debtor's ability to pay. So the creditor's lawsuit on the same date (August 1) would be a challenge to the statute of limitations. If the statute of limitations has already expired, the creditor can't enforce it. So, the statute of limitations is due to be expiring on August 1, 2022. So the creditor can't get anything because the statute of limitations has expired, and the debtor is suing for that. Therefore, the creditor cannot enforce the statute, so they cannot get the full $12,000. So the correct answer is G: "The creditor is not entitled to anything, due to the statute of limitations expiring."

Wait, but another possibility. Maybe the statute of limitations is a period for the debt to be collected. So the debtor can't claim the debt unless the statute is enforced. So the creditor can't collect anything because the statute of limitations has already run its course. So, yes, G is correct.

Looking at the options:

A: On July 1, not June 1, judgment for $12,000. No, because the statute of limitations is August 1, so July 1 is too early. The deadline is August 1. So A is incorrect.

B: On June 1, judgment for $12k. No, because the statute is August 1. So B is wrong.

C: Judgment for $5,000 regardless of date. No, because the statute of limitations is about the debt being enforced, not partial payment. So C is incorrect.

D: On August 1, $12k. No, because the statute of limitations is August 1, so the debt is due by that date, but the debtor is suing for the limitation. So the creditor can't get the full amount. So D is wrong.

E: $7k, remaining after $5k. No, because the statute of limitations doesn't affect partial payments. The debtor's failure to pay the $5k doesn't affect the fact that the statute is up. So E is incorrect.

F: On July 1, full $12k. No, the deadline is August 1, so F is incorrect.

G: Creditor not entitled to anything because statute expired. Yes, this seems correct.

H: Creditor gets $5k only on July 1. No, the statute of limitations doesn't allow for partial payments. So H is incorrect.

I: No on either dates. No, because the statute of limitations's date is August 1, so I is incorrect.

The question revolves around a debt recovery scenario involving a statute of limitations. The debtor owes the creditor $12,000 and fails to pay $5,000 on time. The creditor sues on August 1, asserting the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense, which would prevent the creditor from enforcing the limitation. The statute of limitations for the debt has already expired by August 1, 2022. Therefore, the creditor cannot enforce the debt, and the debt remains uncollectible. 

The correct answer is that the creditor is not entitled to anything due to the statute of limitations expiring.

ANSWER: G
