Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing different silver alloys. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is, how many ounces of silver alloy that's 28% silver need to be mixed with 24 ounces of another alloy that's 8% silver to get a new alloy that's 20% silver. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, let's break this down. I think this is a mixture problem where I have two solutions with different concentrations and I need to find out the ratio to mix them so the final concentration is correct. I remember these are usually solved using the concept of weighted averages or maybe setting up equations.

Let me denote the amount of the first alloy (28% silver) as x ounces. So, I'm using x ounces of a 28% alloy, and I have 24 ounces of an 8% alloy. The total amount after mixing will be x + 24 ounces, and the total silver in the mixture should be 20% of (x + 24).

The silver from the first alloy is 0.28x, and the silver from the second is 0.08 * 24. The sum of these should equal 0.20*(x + 24).

So, the equation would be:
0.28x + 0.08*24 = 0.20*(x + 24)

Let me compute 0.08*24. 0.08 *24 is 1.92. So,
0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20x + 0.20 * 24

Wait, 0.20 *24 is 4.8. So the equation is:
0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20x + 4.8

Now, let's subtract 0.20x from both sides:
0.08x + 1.92 = 4.8

Then, subtract 1.92 from both sides:
0.08x = 4.8 - 1.92 = 2.88

So, x = 2.88 / 0.08. Let me calculate that. 2.88 ÷ 0.08. Hmm, 0.08 goes into 2.88 how many times? 0.08 *30 is 2.4, so 30 times is 2.4. 0.08*36 is 2.88 (because 0.08*30=2.4, 0.08*6=0.48, 2.4+0.48=2.88). So x is 36 ounces.

Wait, so 36 ounces of the 28% alloy are needed. Let me check the options. Looking back, option F is 36 ounces. So that's the answer.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me plug x=36 back into the equation.

0.28*36 = 10.08
0.08*24 = 1.92
Total silver: 10.08 +1.92 =12.00 ounces.

Total alloy: 36 +24 =60 ounces.
20% of 60 is 12, which matches. So yes, that's correct.

The problem involves mixing two silver alloys to achieve a 20% silver concentration. Let’s denote the amount of the 28% alloy as \( x \) ounces. The total silver from this alloy is \( 0.28x \), and from the 24 ounces of 8% alloy, it's \( 0.08 \times 24 = 1.92 \) ounces. The total silver in the mixture should be \( 0.20(x + 24) \). Setting up the equation:

\[
0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20(x + 24)
\]

Solving:

\[
0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20x + 4.8
\]
\[
0.08x = 2.88
\]
\[
x = 36 \text{ ounces}
\]

This matches option F. Checking the calculation confirms the correct answer.

Answer: F
