Question:

7.3-5. In order to estimate the proportion, $p$, of a large class of college freshmen that had high school GPAs from 3.2 to 3.6 , inclusive, a sample of $n=50$ students was taken. It was found that $y=9$ students fell into this interval.
(a) Give a point estimate of $p$.


Options:

A: $0.1000$
B: $0.1600$
C: $0.1200$
D: $0.2000$
E: $0.2200$
F: $0.1400$
G: $0.3000$
H: $0.2500$
I: $0.2800$
J: $0.1800$

Okay, so I need to find the point estimate for the proportion p. The question says that a sample of 50 students was taken, and 9 of them had high school GPAs from 3.2 to 3.6. 

Point estimate usually refers to a single value estimate of a parameter. Since we're dealing with proportions, the point estimate is simply the sample proportion. The formula for that is the number of successes (y) divided by the sample size (n).

So in this case, y is 9, and n is 50. Let me calculate that. 9 divided by 50. Let me compute that.

9 รท 50 = 0.18. Hmm, wait, so 0.18 is the proportion. Now looking at the options, option J is 0.1800, so that should be the answer.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. 50 students, 9 are in the desired range, so 9/50 is 0.18. Yep, that seems right.

The point estimate for the proportion \( p \) is calculated as the sample proportion, which is the number of successes \( y \) divided by the sample size \( n \).

\[
\hat{p} = \frac{y}{n} = \frac{9}{50} = 0.18
\]

Thus, the point estimate is \( 0.1800 \), which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
