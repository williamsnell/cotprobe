Okay, so I need to figure out who founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence in 1965. Hmm, I remember that non-violence is a significant topic in activism, especially in the context of the movement for racial justice. The Institute for the Study of Non-Violence was established by a group of activists. 

Looking at the options, I think the key here is to identify the correct name and the year. I'm pretty sure it's a group including some of the main figures in that movement. Let me think. I remember that Pete Seeger was involved in the early days of the movement, but I'm not sure about the exact year. 

Wait, I think the Institute was founded by a group that included Bill Oates, but that's from the 70s. No, wait, no, Bill Oates was a bit of a left-wing figure. Alternatively, I recall that the Institute was founded by some of the key nonviolent activists of the 70s. Let's think about the options. 

Looking at the options, the correct answer is Arlo Guthrie. Oh wait, but Arlo Guthrie was a founding member of the nonviolent movement, right? So in 1965, he founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence. That makes sense because the Institute is dedicated to studying and promoting non-violence, and Arlo was a key figure in establishing it.

So the correct answer should be Arlo Guthrie. Looking back at the options, F is Arlo Guthrie. So the answer is F.

The correct answer is F: Arlo Guthrie. 

Answer:
F: Arlo Guthrie
