Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Milgram's obedience experiments. The question is asking what percentage of participants thought they delivered the maximum amount of shock possible. The options are A to J, with various percentages.

First, I remember that Milgram's experiments were about obedience and fear. He set up an experiment where participants were given a $50 bill and told they had to give it to someone who would harm them. Then, they had to give the bill to one person who wouldn't harm them. After giving the bill, the person who did harm them received the money back.

I think the key here is the shock response. Milgram found that the majority of people gave up the bill because of fear. So, what percentage of participants thought they delivered the maximum shock? I recall that in one of his experiments, 60% of the participants actually thought they delivered the maximum shock. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Let me think again.

Oh right, Milgram's famous experiment had about 60% of the participants believing they delivered the maximum shock. The rest were more cautious, showing fear or doubt. So the percentage they thought was 60%, which is option B.

Wait, sometimes I get confused between 60% and others. Let me make sure. I think the correct answer is indeed 60%. So the right choice is B.

The correct answer is B: 60.
