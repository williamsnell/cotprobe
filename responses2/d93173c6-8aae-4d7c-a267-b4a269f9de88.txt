Alright, I need to figure out which Nmap scan doesn't completely open a TCP connection. Let me start by recalling what each scan does.

Option A is TCP connect. I know that TCP connect is a TCP-based scan that captures data being transmitted. It usually looks for windows, so it should open TCP connections by capturing data.

Option B is the SCTP INIT scan. SCTP stands for Simple Network protocols Transfer. The INIT scan sends init packets, like TCP's TCP Init, which check for TCP connections. So it should open TCP connections as well.

Option C is the SYN stealth scan. This scan looks for a SYN packet, which is a data packet indicating that a connection is being established. It's designed to capture connections but doesn't necessarily open them; it just detects them. So it might not open a TCP connection.

Wait, but does the SYN stealth scan actually open a connection? I think it's more about detecting the connection rather than actively opening it. So the answer should be option C because it doesn't completely open a TCP connection.

The correct answer is **C: SYN stealth scan** because it detects TCP connections but doesn't actively open them.

Answer: C
