Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the ionization constant of NH4OH. Hmm, I've heard that ionization constants are related to how much a compound dissociates in water. But wait, NH4OH is a weak base, right? So it doesn't fully dissociate, but it does partially.

The question says the ionization constant is 1.8 × 10^-5. Wait, wait, ionization constants are usually for acids, not bases. Oh right, the formula for a weak base is Kb = [OH-][BH+][A-]/[BA], but I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, wait. Wait, NH4OH is a weak base, so its ionization would produce OH- and NH4+ ions. So the reaction might be NH4OH ↔ H2O + NH4+ + OH-? Or wait, maybe I should think of it as NH4OH dissociating into NH4+ and OH-.

Wait, no, more accurately, for a weak base, the ionization can be represented as B + H2O ↔ BH+ + OH-. So the Kb is the ionization constant, which is [BH+][OH-]/[B]. 

The problem gives Kb as 1.8e-5. The solution is 1.0 M NH4OH. Wait, but wait, no, 1.0 M NH4OH is not a solution of NH4OH. Wait, wait, the question is about the concentration of OH^- ions in a 1.0 molar solution. Hmm, wait, no, no. Wait, the question says the solution is 1.0 M NH4OH. So the concentration of NH4OH is 1.0 M. But NH4OH is a weak base, so it will partially dissociate.

So, how do I find the concentration of OH^- ions in this solution? I think I need to set up an ICE table to find the concentrations at equilibrium.

The reaction: NH4OH ↔ H2O + NH4+ + OH^-
Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. For a weak base, the hydroxide ion comes from the dissociation. So the reaction should be: NH4OH ↔ H2O + NH4+ + OH^-.

Wait, but is that correct? Or maybe it's NH4+ reacting with water. Let me get the correct reaction. Oh wait, no, the correct reaction for a weak base is:

Base (B) + H2O ↔ BH+ + OH^-

So, NH4OH is the base. So the reaction is NH4OH ↔ H2O + NH4+ + OH^-.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, actually, NH4+ is the conjugate acid of NH3, so the base is NH3. But the problem is about NH4OH, so perhaps the reaction is NH4OH ↔ H2O + NH4+ + OH^-.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as the base (NH4OH) accepting a proton. So, the reaction is NH4OH + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH^- ?

Hmm, perhaps I should get the correct formula for Kb. Oh wait, Kb is for the base, so for NH4OH, the Kb would be [NH4+][OH^-] / [NH4OH]. Or wait, maybe I got the formula upside down. Oh, wait, the Kb expression for a base is Kb = [BH+][OH^-]/[B], where B is the base.

Wait, but wait, NH4OH is a weak base, so it's a base. So, when it dissociates, it produces NH4+ and OH^-.

So, the reaction is NH4OH ↔ NH4+ + OH^-. So Kb = [NH4+][OH^-]/[NH4OH].

Wait, but wait, that's the formula. So, Kb is given as 1.8e-5.

So, in a 1.0 M solution of NH4OH, which is a weak base, so it will dissociate to some extent. Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
[NH4OH] = 1.0 M
[NH4+] = 0 (initially)
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
[NH4OH] decreases by x
[NH4+] increases by x
[OH^-] increases by x

At equilibrium:
[NH4OH] = 1.0 - x
[NH4+] = x
[OH^-] = x

Then Kb = (x)(x) / (1.0 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Wait, but since the concentration is 1.0 M and Kb is small, x will be much smaller than 1.0, so 1.0 -x ≈ 1.0. So, the equation becomes x² = 1.8e-5 * 1.0 → x = sqrt(1.8e-5) ≈ 4.24e-3.

Wait, but wait, what's the actual value? Let me calculate x. sqrt(1.8e-5) is sqrt(1.8)*1e-2.5 → Wait, 1e-5 is 1e-5, sqrt is 1e-2.5, which is 3.16e-3. So, sqrt(1.8) is about 1.34, so 1.34e-2.5 → so 1.34 * 3.16e-3 → approximately 4.24e-3.

So, [OH^-] ≈ 4.24e-3 M, which is about 4.2e-3. Looking at the options, option E is 4.2e-3. But wait, wait, the options have a letter E as 4.2 × 10^-3. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. Is the reaction correctly set up? Because for a weak base, the Kb is [BH+][OH-]/[B]. So in this case, B is NH4OH. So, the expression is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way: Kb = (x)(x) / (1.0 - x) = 1.8e-5. Assuming x is small, 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0. So x^2 = 1.8e-5 → x = sqrt(1.8e-5) ≈ 4.24e-3. So, the [OH^-] is 4.2e-3, which is option E.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The options given are:

A: 3.0e-6
B:5.4e-5
C:1.0
D:9.0e-4
E:4.2e-3
F:1.0 - [OH^-]
G:1.2e-3
H:2.5e-2
I:1.8e-5
J:6.7e-6

So, the correct answer is E:4.2e-3. So, the concentration of OH^- is option E.

To calculate the concentration of OH⁻ ions in a 1.0 molar solution of NH₄OH, we use the ionization constant (Kb) for the weak base NH₄OH, which is given as 1.8 × 10⁻⁵. The dissociation reaction is:

**NH₄OH ↔ H₂O + NH₄⁺ + OH⁻**

The equilibrium concentrations can be determined using an ICE table:

| Species        | Initial | Change | Equilibrium |
|----------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| NH₄OH          | 1.0     | -x     | 1.0 - x     |
| NH₄⁺           | 0       | +x     | x           |
| OH⁻             | 0       | +x     | x           |

The equilibrium expression for Kb is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[NH₄⁺][OH⁻]}{[NH₄OH]} = \frac{(x)(x)}{1.0 - x} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Since \( K_b \) is small and the initial concentration of NH₄OH is 1.0 M, we approximate \( 1.0 - x \approx 1.0 \). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
x^2 = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \times 1.0
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 4.24 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Thus, the concentration of OH⁻ ions is approximately \( 4.2 \times 10^{-3} \) M. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: 4.2 × 10⁻³**
