Okay, so I've got this fluid dynamics problem here, and I need to figure out the rate of flow outward through a specific cylinder. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The fluid has a density of 870 kg/m³. Its velocity is given by the vector v = z i + y² j + x² k, where x, y, z are measured in meters, and the components are in m/s. The cylinder in question is x² + y² = 4, with z ranging from 0 to 1. I need to find the rate of flow outward through this cylinder, and the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, so I think this is a problem involving fluid flow, specifically related to flux. The rate of flow outward would be the flux of the velocity field through the surface, multiplied by the density. Since flux is a measure of how much fluid is passing through a surface per unit time, and then multiplying by density gives the mass flow rate.

Wait, let me think. The flux Φ is given by the integral of the velocity vector v dot the normal vector dA over the surface. So Φ = ∫∫ v · n dA. Then the mass flow rate is Φ multiplied by the density ρ, which is 870 kg/m³. So the rate of flow outward is ρ * Φ.

Right, so the first step is to compute the flux Φ through the given cylinder, then multiply by 870.

But wait, the cylinder is x² + y² = 4, which is a circular cylinder of radius 2, extending from z=0 to z=1. So it's a vertical cylinder, right? The velocity field is v = z i + y² j + x² k. Hmm, okay.

So I need to compute the flux of v through this cylinder. To compute this flux, I can use the divergence theorem, but wait, the divergence theorem relates the flux through a closed surface to the divergence of the vector field within that volume. However, here, the cylinder is just the lateral surface, not a closed one. So I can't directly apply the divergence theorem in this case because the divergence theorem requires a closed surface.

Wait, but perhaps I can consider the cylinder as part of a larger closed surface. The cylinder is at x² + y² = 4, and z from 0 to 1. So the entire closed surface would consist of the lateral surface of the cylinder plus two disks at z=0 and z=1. But wait, the problem only asks about the flow outward through the cylinder. So maybe the flow through the lateral surface is the flux we're looking for, and the flow through the two disks would involve negative signs (since they are closed off), but perhaps I don't need to compute them because the question is only about the lateral surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the flux through the cylinder directly using a surface integral. Let's see.

The cylinder is given in cylindrical coordinates, perhaps. Let me think about parametrizing it. The cylinder x² + y² = 4 can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates as r = 2, where r is the radial coordinate. Then, in cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. So the parametrization would be:

r(θ, z) = (2 cosθ, 2 sinθ, z), where θ ranges from 0 to 2π, and z ranges from 0 to 1.

The velocity field in terms of cylindrical coordinates is v = z i + y² j + x² k. Let's express this in terms of cylindrical coordinates.

i is the unit vector in the x-direction, which is (cosθ, sinθ, 0) in cylindrical. So i = cosθ r̂ - sinθ θ̂. Similarly, j is the unit vector in the y-direction, which is (-sinθ r̂ + cosθ θ̂). But perhaps it's easier to compute the velocity components in the Cartesian basis, then convert them to cylindrical.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should directly compute the flux integral in Cartesian coordinates. Let me think about whether that's feasible.

The flux Φ is the integral over the surface S of v · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface. For the cylinder x² + y² =4, the normal vector points outward. Since the cylinder is a right circular cylinder, the normal vector at any point is in the radial direction, which in Cartesian coordinates is (x, y, 0) normalized. But wait, since x² + y² =4, the normal vector is (x, y, 0) scaled by 1/(2) because the radius is 2. Wait, no. Let me think. The cylinder x² + y² =4 can be represented as r = 2, so the normal vector is in the radial direction, which is (x, y, 0) / (2), but wait, no. Wait, r is a vector, so the unit normal vector would be (x, y, 0) divided by the magnitude of r, which is sqrt(x² + y²) = 2. So the unit normal vector n is (x, y, 0)/2.

So, n = (x/2, y/2, 0).

So, the velocity vector v is given as z i + y² j + x² k. So v = (z, y², x²).

Now, the dot product v · n is (z, y², x²) · (x/2, y/2, 0) = [z*(x/2) + y²*(y/2) + x²*0] = (zx)/2 + (y³)/2.

So, Φ = ∫∫ [ (zx)/2 + (y³)/2 ] dA.

But now, I need to compute this double integral over the surface x² + y² =4, z from 0 to 1.

Wait, but the surface is parameterized by (θ, z) where θ from 0 to 2π and z from 0 to 1. So perhaps I can express x and y in terms of θ and z.

x = 2 cosθ, y = 2 sinθ, z = z.

So substituting into the expression for (zx)/2 + (y³)/2:

zx/2 = (2 cosθ) * z / 2 = cosθ * z.

y³/2 = (2 sinθ)^3 /2 = (8 sin³θ)/2 =4 sin³θ.

So the integrand becomes (cosθ z + 4 sin³θ) dA.

But dA on the cylinder is the area element. For a cylinder, the area element is r dθ dz, where r is the radius (2 here). So dA = 2 dθ dz.

Wait, that's correct. So substituting in, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (z=0 to 1) [ cosθ z + 4 sin³θ ] * 2 dθ dz.

So, Φ = 2 ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^1 [ cosθ z + 4 sin³θ ] dθ dz.

I can split this into two integrals:

Φ = 2 [ ∫₀^{2π} cosθ dθ ∫₀^1 z dz + 4 ∫₀^{2π} sin³θ dθ ∫₀^1 dz ].

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Because the terms are multiplied. Wait, no, because in the integrand, it's [cosθ z + 4 sin³θ] multiplied by 2 dθ dz. So when I distribute the 2, it's 2 ∫ cosθ z dθ dz + 2 ∫ 4 sin³θ dθ dz.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in factoring. Let me reorganize:

Φ = ∫∫ [ (zx)/2 + (y³)/2 ] dA
= ∫∫ [ ( (2 cosθ) z ) /2 + ( (2 sinθ)^3 ) /2 ] * 2 dθ dz
= ∫∫ [ (cosθ z) + (4 sin³θ) ] * 2 dθ dz
= 2 ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^1 [ cosθ z + 4 sin³θ ] dθ dz.

So, yes, that's correct. Now, let's split into two integrals:

Φ = 2 [ ∫₀^{2π} cosθ dθ ∫₀^1 z dz + ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^1 4 sin³θ dz dθ ]

Wait, no. Let me see. The integrand is [cosθ z + 4 sin³θ], so the integrals would be:

2 ∫ ( ∫ (cosθ z +4 sin³θ) dθ dz )

Which can be written as 2 [ ∫ ( ∫ cosθ z dθ ) dz + ∫ ( ∫ 4 sin³θ dθ ) dz ) ]

But that's correct. So the expression is:

2 [ ∫ ( from 0 to 2π ∫ (from 0 to 1) cosθ z dθ dz ) + ∫ (from 0 to 2π ∫ (from 0 to 1) 4 sin³θ dz dθ ) ]

So, let's compute each part.

First part: ∫ (from 0 to 2π) ∫ (from 0 to 1) cosθ z dθ dz.

Compute the inner integral with respect to z first. The inner integral ∫ z dz from 0 to 1 is [ z²/2 ] from 0 to 1, which is 1/2.

So, the first part becomes ∫ (from 0 to 2π) cosθ * (1/2) dθ.

Which is (1/2) ∫ cosθ dθ from 0 to 2π. The integral of cosθ over 0 to 2π is zero because it's a full period. So this first term is zero.

Second part: ∫ (from 0 to 2π) ∫ (from 0 to 1) 4 sin³θ dz dθ.

The inner integral ∫ dz from 0 to 1 is 1. So this becomes ∫ (from 0 to 2π) 4 sin³θ dθ.

So, the second part is 4 ∫ sin³θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

Now, the integral of sin³θ over 0 to 2π. Hmm, sin³θ is an odd function when considering the interval from 0 to π, but wait, the integral over a full period.

Wait, the integral of sin^n θ over 0 to 2π. For n odd, the integral from 0 to 2π is zero. Because sin^n θ is symmetric and positive and negative parts cancel out.

Wait, let me confirm that. The integral of sin³θ over 0 to 2π: Let me think.

We can write sin³θ as sinθ (1 - cos²θ). So the integral becomes ∫ sinθ (1 - cos²θ) dθ from 0 to 2π.

Let me make substitution u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - u²) (-du) from u=1 (θ=0) to u=-1 (θ=π) and then from u=-1 to u=1 (θ=π to 2π). Wait, but let me compute it properly.

Wait, the integral of sin³θ from 0 to 2π is zero because the positive and negative parts cancel. So the integral of sin³θ over 0 to 2π is zero.

So the second part is 4 * 0 = 0.

So Φ = 2 [ 0 + 0 ] = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include zero. Wait, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Let me go back. Because the problem is about the rate of flow outward through the cylinder. But perhaps I'm computing the outward flux, which is correct, but perhaps the actual flow rate is the integral of v · n dA, but multiplied by the density, but wait no, the flux is Φ, and the rate is Φ multiplied by the density.

Wait, no. The flux Φ is the integral of v · n dA, which gives the outward flow per unit time. So the rate of flow is Φ multiplied by density. So if Φ is zero, then the rate is zero. But the options don't have zero, but wait, option E is zero. So is E the correct answer? But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because when I computed the flux, I found it to be zero. But that's possible. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should compute the flux using the divergence theorem, but I'm not sure because the cylinder is a closed surface. So the divergence theorem applies to closed surfaces. The cylinder in question is part of a closed surface (the lateral surface plus two disks at z=0 and z=1). So perhaps the total flux through the closed surface would be equal to the integral of the divergence of v over the volume enclosed.

Wait, but the problem is only about the flux through the cylinder (lateral surface), not the entire closed surface. So perhaps I can't use the divergence theorem directly here. But maybe I can compute the flux through the lateral surface by considering the divergence of v.

Wait, let me compute the divergence of v. The divergence of a vector field v = (v_x, v_y, v_z) is ∂v_x/∂x + ∂v_y/∂y + ∂v_z/∂z.

So v = (z, y², x²).

Compute ∂v_x/∂x = ∂z/∂x = 0.

∂v_y/∂y = ∂(y²)/∂y = 2y.

∂v_z/∂z = ∂(x²)/∂z = 0.

So divergence of v is 0 + 2y + 0 = 2y.

So, the divergence is 2y.

So, according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the entire closed surface (the lateral surface plus the two disks at z=0 and z=1) would be ∫∫∫ (2y) dV over the volume V enclosed by the cylinder.

But the problem isn't asking for that. It's only asking for the flux through the lateral surface. However, if I compute the total flux (closed surface) using the divergence theorem, then subtract the flux through the two disks, I can find the flux through the lateral surface.

Let me proceed.

So, the total flux Φ_total = ∫∫∫_V (2y) dV.

The volume V is the region inside the cylinder x² + y² ≤4 (radius 2), and between z=0 and z=1.

So, in cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z.

So, the volume element dV = r dr dθ dz.

So, the integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (z=0 to 1) ∫ (r=0 to 2) 2 (r sinθ) * r dr dz dθ.

Wait, because 2y = 2 r sinθ.

So, the integrand becomes 2 (r sinθ) * r dr dz dθ.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that.

So, 2y = 2 r sinθ.

So, the integrand is 2 r sinθ.

So, the integral becomes:

2 ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) sinθ dθ ∫ (z=0 to1) dz ∫ (r=0 to2) r^2 dr.

Because 2y is 2 r sinθ, and the Jacobian is r, so the integrand is 2 (r sinθ) * r dr dθ dz.

Wait, no, because dV is r dr dθ dz, and 2y is 2r sinθ, so the integrand is 2r sinθ * r dr dθ dz. So that's 2 r^2 sinθ dr dθ dz.

Wait, no, wait: 2y = 2 r sinθ, so the integrand is (2 r sinθ) * r dr dθ dz, because dV is r dr dθ dz.

Wait, yes. So the integral is:

2 ∫ (0 to 2π) ∫ (0 to1) ∫ (0 to 2) r^2 sinθ dr dz dθ.

So, let's compute this step by step.

First, integrate with respect to r:

∫ (r=0 to2) r^2 dr = [ (r^3)/3 ] from 0 to2 = (8/3) - 0 = 8/3.

Next, integrate over z: ∫ (z=0 to1) dz =1.

So, the integral becomes 2 * ∫ (0 to 2π) sinθ dθ * (8/3) *1.

Compute the integral of sinθ dθ from 0 to2π: The integral is -cosθ from 0 to 2π, which is (-cos2π + cos0) = (-1 +1) =0.

So the total flux Φ_total is 2 * 0 * (8/3) =0.

Wait, that's strange. So the total flux through the closed surface (lateral plus two disks) is zero. But this doesn't make sense because the vector field v has a non-zero divergence of 2y, which is non-zero for y>0. So perhaps the divergence is positive in some regions and negative in others, leading to a net flux of zero.

But wait, if the total flux through the closed surface is zero, then the flux through the lateral surface plus the two disks is zero. So the flux through the lateral surface plus the two disks is zero. But wait, the two disks are at z=0 and z=1.

So, let's compute the flux through each of these disks.

First, the disk at z=0: x² + y² ≤4, z=0.

The normal vector for this disk is pointing downward (since it's the base of the cylinder), so n = (x, y, 0) normalized. But for the flux integral, you can compute the dot product with the normal vector.

Wait, the flux through the disk at z=0 is ∫∫ (v · n) dA, where n is the unit normal vector pointing downward. So, n = (x, y, 0) / sqrt(x² + y² + 0) ), but since we're on the disk, z=0, so x² + y² =4, so sqrt(x² + y²) =2. So n = (x, y, 0)/2.

So, the velocity vector at z=0 is v = z i + y² j + x² k. But at z=0, v = 0 i + y² j + x² k.

So, v = y² j + x² k.

The normal vector is (x, y, 0)/2.

So, the dot product v · n is (y²)(x) + (x²)(y) + 0, all divided by 2.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

v = y² j + x² k.

n = (x i + y j + 0 k)/2.

So, v · n = (y²)(x/2) + (x²)(y/2) + 0.

So, v · n = (x y²)/2 + (x² y)/2.

But for the disk at z=0, the normal vector is (x, y, 0)/2. So, the dot product is (v · n) = (x y² + x² y)/2.

Wait, but let me compute the integral:

Φ_z0 = ∫∫ (v · n) dA.

Which is ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (z=0 to1) [ (z i + y² j + x² k) · (x i + y j + 0 k)/2 ] dA.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the flux through the disk at z=0 as:

The velocity at z=0 is v = y² j + x² k.

The unit normal vector is (x, y, 0)/2.

So, v · n = (y² j + x² k) · (x i + y j + 0 k)/2.

Which is (y²)(y) + (x²)(x) all divided by 2.

So, (y³ + x³)/2.

Wait, but x² + y² =4, so x³ = x * x², and similarly y³ = y * y².

But perhaps I can compute the integral of (x³ + y³)/2 over the disk x² + y² <=4.

But the integral of x³ over x² + y² <=4: Since x³ is an odd function in x, and the region of integration is symmetric about x and y axes, the integral of x³ over the entire disk is zero.

Same for y³, the integral is zero. So the integral of (x³ + y³)/2 over the disk is zero.

So, the flux through the disk at z=0 is zero.

Similarly, the disk at z=1:

At z=1, the velocity is v = 1 i + y² j + x² k.

The unit normal vector is (x, y, 0)/2.

So, the dot product is:

v · n = (1 i + y² j + x² k) · (x i + y j + 0 k)/2.

Which is (1 * x) + (y² * y) + (x² * 0) all divided by 2.

So, (x + y³)/2.

Again, integrating over the disk x² + y² <=4.

The integral of x over the disk is zero (since it's an odd function), and the integral of y³ is zero for the same reason as x³.

So, the integral of (x + y³)/2 over the disk is zero.

Thus, the flux through the two disks is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the flux through the entire closed surface is zero, so the flux through the lateral surface plus the two disks is zero. So, the flux through the lateral surface is equal to the negative of the flux through the two disks, but since the flux through the disks is zero, the flux through the lateral surface is zero. Therefore, the rate of flow is zero.

But the options don't have zero. Wait, option E is zero, which matches that. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake in the initial approach. Because when I computed the flux via the divergence theorem and got zero, but the problem is only about the lateral surface, but perhaps the actual flow rate is zero because the net flux is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the flux through the lateral surface directly without using the divergence theorem.

Wait, but when I computed the flux through the lateral surface (the cylinder) directly, I found it to be zero. So that's correct. So the rate of flow is zero.

But the options are: A) 4, B)8, C)12, D)16, E)0. So E is the correct answer.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when I computed the flux via the divergence theorem. Because the total flux through the closed surface is zero, so the flux through the lateral surface is zero. So the rate of flow outward is zero.

Thus, the answer is E)0.
</think>

The problem involves finding the rate of flow of a fluid through the lateral surface of a cylinder. The fluid is described by a velocity field **v** = (z, y², x²), and the cylinder has a radius of 2 and extends from z=0 to z=1.

### Key Steps:

1. **Compute the flux through the lateral surface directly**:
   - The lateral surface is parameterized by θ (ranging from 0 to 2π) and z (ranging from 0 to 1).
   - The velocity field is **v** = (z, y², x²), and the normal vector to the lateral surface is **n** = (x, y, 0) normalized.
   - The flux integral becomes:
     \[
     \Phi = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} \left( \frac{zx}{2} + \frac{y^3}{2} \right) d\theta dz
     \]
   - After evaluating the integrals, it is found that:
     \[
     \Phi = 0
     \]

2. **Verify using the divergence theorem**:
   - Compute the divergence of **v**:
     \[
     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial y^2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial x^2}{\partial x} = 2y
     \]
   - The total flux through the closed surface (lateral surface plus two disks) is given by:
     \[
     \Phi_{\text{total}} = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{2} 2y \, r \, dr \, dz \, d\theta
     \]
   - Evaluating this integral yields:
     \[
     \Phi_{\text{total}} = 0
     \]
   - Since the flux through the two disks is zero (as shown in the detailed calculations), the flux through the lateral surface must also be zero.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The rate of flow of the fluid outward through the lateral surface of the cylinder is zero.
