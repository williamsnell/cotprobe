Okay, so I've got this problem here about a catalytic ammonia converter. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through what I remember.

So the reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. They're converting nitrogen to ammonia. The initial amount is 1 mol of N2 reacting with 3 mol H2. The conditions are 100 atm pressure and 350°C. The equilibrium constant K is 14.4 × 10^-5 at 500°C? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, the problem says the equilibrium constant K is equal to 14.4 × 10^-5 at 500°C. Oh, but wait, the reaction is being operated at 350°C. Oh, wait, maybe I should think about the van 't Hoff equation or something for the van der Waals or something else.

Wait, no, the problem says the enthalpy of reaction ΔH° is -25,800 cal/g-mol at the desired temperatures. Oh wait, wait, the desired temperature is 350°C. Wait, but the K is given at 500°C. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says, "the enthalpy of reaction ΔH^0 is -25,800 cal/g-mol at the desired temperatures." Hmm, the desired temperature here is probably 350°C because that's where the converter is operated. So the K is given at 500°C. Hmm, but wait, the conversion can't be directly determined from K at a different temperature. Oh, right, because the reaction is exothermic, because ΔH is negative, so the K decreases with increasing temperature. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, the problem says that the K is given at 500°C. But the converter is operated at 350°C. Hmm. So perhaps the K value is for 500°C, and I need to find the conversion at 350°C?

Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium conversion of nitrogen to ammonia. So I need to find the conversion when the reaction is at 350°C. But the K given is at 500°C. So perhaps I need to use the van 't Hoff equation to find the equilibrium constant at 350°C. Because if I can find K at 350°C, then I can compute the conversion.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the problem. Let me read the question again.

The problem states: "The converter is operated at a pressure of 100atmand a temperatureof 350°C. The equilibrium constant for this reaction K is equal to 14.4 × 10^-5 at 500°C." Oh, wait no, the K is given at 500°C. Wait, but the converter is operating at 350°C. Hmmm... So maybe I need to find the equilibrium constant at 350°C, given that at 500°C it's 14.4e-5. But wait, perhaps the K given is at 350°C? No, the problem says K is equal to 14.4e-5 at 500°C. So K at 500 is 14.4e-5. But the converter is at 350. Hmm, but the question is about the conversion at 350°C. So perhaps I need to find the equilibrium constant at 350, but wait, the given K is at 500. So maybe two variables.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the K given is at 500°C, and I need to find the K at 350°C. Because the reaction's K decreases with increasing temperature when ΔH is negative (exothermic). So if K at 500 is 14.4e-5, what would K be at 350? Using the van 't Hoff equation.

The van 't Hoff equation is ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] / (1), but wait, I need to be careful about the signs. Let me think. The van 't Hoff equation is d(ln K)/d(1/T) = -ΔH°/R. So when temperature decreases, K decreases (since exothermic).

So, given that the reaction is exothermic (ΔH negative), K decreases with increasing temperature. So, at 500 vs 350, K would be smaller at lower temperature.

So, the given K is 14.4e-5 at 500°C. Let me convert that to Kelvin: 500 + 273.15 = 773.15 K.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me outline the steps I think I need to take.

First, I need to compute the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔG, which is equal to -RT ln K. So K is given at 500°C, but we're interested in 350°C.

Alternatively, using the van 't Hoff equation: ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°(in J/mol)) / R * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1) [Wait, no, the equation is ln(K2/K1) = -(ΔH°/R) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] / (1) ) ].

Wait, but let's clarify the variables:

ΔH° is the enthalpy change at the given temperature. But wait, the problem says that the ΔH° is given at the desired temperature, which is 350°C. But wait, wait, the problem says "the enthalpy of reaction ΔH^0 is -25,800 cal/g-mol at the desired temperatures." Oh, so that's at 350°C. So when we compute K at 350°C, we're using that ΔH°, but wait, K is given at 500°C. So wait, perhaps I need to compute K at 350°C, but the given K is at 500°C?

Wait, no, because the given K is at 500, but the problem is asking for K at 350. So perhaps the given K is at 500, and the reaction is exothermic, so K decreases with increasing T.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The given K is 14.4e-5 at 500°C. We need to find K at 350°C to calculate the conversion.

So, using the van 't Hoff equation. The equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, no. The van 't Hoff equation is:

d(ln K)/d(1/T) = -ΔH° / R

So, integrating, ln K2 - ln K1 = (ΔH° / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but since ΔH° is negative for exothermic reactions, the equation becomes:

ln K2/K1 = (ΔH° / R) ( (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. Let's take T1 = 500 K, T2 = 350 K. ΔH° is -25,800 cal/g-mol. Wait, but wait, cal and J. Oh, I need to convert ΔH° from cal to J. Because R is in J/(mol·K).

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So ΔH° is -25,800 cal/g-mol. Let me calculate that in J/(mol·K).

So, 25,800 cal/g-mol is 25,800 * 4.184 J/mol. Let me compute that.

25,800 * 4.184 = Let's see, 25,800 * 4 = 103,200, 25,800 * 0.184= 4,763.2. So total is 103,200 + 4,763.2 = 107,963.2 J/mol.

Wait, no, wait, wait. No, wait, 25,800 cal/g-mol is 25,800 cal per gram per mole. So per mole, it's 25,800 cal/g * 1 mol / 1 g = 25,800 cal/mol. Convert that to J: 25,800 * 4.184 J/(mol·K) = 25,800 * 4.184.

Wait, 25,800 * 4 = 103,200, 25,800 * 0.184 = let's compute 25,800 * 0.1 = 2,580; 25,800 * 0.08 = 2,064; 25,800 * 0.004=103.2. So 2,580 + 2,064 = 4,644; 4,644 + 103.2 = 4,747.2. So total is 103,200 + 4,747.2 = 107,947.2 J/mol. So ΔH° is -107,947.2 J/mol.

So, ΔH° = -107,947 J/mol.

Now, using the van 't Hoff equation:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

T1 is 500 K, T2 is 350 K.

Compute (1/500 - 1/350) = (350 - 500)/(500*350) ) = (-150)/(175,000) )= -150/(175000) = -0.000857143.

So,

ln(K2/K1) = (-107947.2 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (-0.000857143)

Wait, no, wait. The equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

So, substituting:

ΔH° is negative, and T1 - T2 is negative, so (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

ΔH° = -107,947.2 J/mol

R = 8.314 J/mol·K

(1/T1) = 1/500 ≈ 0.002

(1/T2) = 1/350 ≈ 0.00285714.

So, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = 0.002 - 0.00285714 ≈ -0.00085714.

So,

ln(K2/K1) = (-107947.2) / 8.314 * (-0.00085714).

Compute the numerator:

-107947.2 / 8.314 ≈ approximately -107947.2 / 8 ≈ -13,493.4.

Then multiply by -0.00085714.

So, (-13,493.4) * (-0.00085714) ≈ 11.64.

So, ln(K2/K1) ≈ 11.64.

So, K2 = K1 * e^11.64.

Wait, K1 is given as 14.4e-5 at 500 K.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, K1 is at 500 K, which is T1, and K2 is at T2=350 K.

So, K2 = K1 * e^(ΔH°/R * (1/T1 -1/T2)) )

Which is K1 * e^ ( (ΔH°/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier, perhaps I made a mistake in signs. Let's re-calculate:

ΔH° is -107947.2 J/mol.

R is 8.314.

(1/T1 -1/T2) is (1/500 - 1/350) = (350-500)/(500*350) )= (-150)/(175,000) = -0.000857143.

So,

(ΔH°/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (-107947.2) / 8.314 * (-0.000857143 )

Let me compute each part.

First, compute (-107947.2) / 8.314.

107947.2 / 8.314 = approximately 12937.5 (because 8.314 * 12937 ≈ 107,947.2, maybe exactly 8.314 * 12937.5 = 107,947.2 J.)

So, 12937.5.

Multiply by (-0.000857143): 12937.5 * (-0.000857143) ≈ -11.12.

So, ln(K2/K1) ≈ -11.12.

Therefore, K2 = K1 * e^(-11.12).

K1 is 14.4e-5, so K2 = 14.4e-5 * e^-11.12.

Compute e^-11.12: e^11.12 is about 60,000 (since ln(60000) ≈ 11.0). So e^-11.12 ≈ 1.65e-5.

So K2 ≈ 14.4e-5 * 1.65e-5 ≈ 23.76e-10.

Wait, wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, e^-11.12 is equal to 1/(e^11.12).

e^11 is about 59874, e^0.12 ≈ 1.1275, so e^11.12 ≈ 59874 * 1.1275 ≈ 59874 *1.1275 ≈ Let's compute 59874 * 1.1275.

Well, 59874 * 1 = 59,874.

59874 * 0.12 = 7,184.88.

59874 * 0.0075 = 449.055.

So sum is 59,874 + 7,184.88 + 449.055 ≈ 67,507.935.

So e^11.12 ≈ 67,508. So e^-11.12 ≈ 1.483e-5.

So K2 ≈ 14.4e-5 * 1.483e-5 ≈ (14.4 * 1.483) * 1e-10.

14.4 * 1.483 = Let's compute 14 *1.483= 20.762, 0.4 *1.483=0.5932. Sum is 21.355. So K2 ≈ 21.355e-10.

So K2 is about 2.1355e-9.

Wait, but wait, wait, let me think again. Because for the equation, we have:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) ( 1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, but I think I might have mixed the formula. Let me double-check the van 't Hoff equation.

The correct van 't Hoff equation is:

d(ln K)/d (1/T) ) = -ΔH°

So, integrating, ln K2 - ln K1 = -ΔH° (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, this might be where I went wrong before. Let me re-examine.

The proper van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2) - ln(K1) = (ΔH°) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / R

Wait, no, perhaps I should have a different sign.

I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Let's redo the calculation.

The correct van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * ( (1/T1 ) - (1/T2) ) / (1) )

Wait, but I think I should reverse the sign.

Alternatively, the correct formula is:

ΔG° = -RT ln K.

And ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. But perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: The van 't Hoff equation can be written as:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°) / R * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, but the equation is:

d(ln K)/d (1/T) ) = -ΔH° / R

So, when we integrate from T1 to T2, we get:

ln(K2) - ln(K1) = (-ΔH° / R) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, no, wait, let's see:

Wait, let's write:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, no, because the correct equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, that can't be right because if ΔH is negative, and T2 < T1, then (1/T1 -1/T2 ) is positive. So, ln(K2/K1) is positive, so K2 > K1. But if reaction is exothermic, K should decrease with increasing T, so K2 < K1. So, perhaps I have the sign wrong in the equation.

Wait, let me go back. The correct van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but if T2 > T1, then (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, so ln(K2/K1) negative, K2 < K1. That's correct for exothermic.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I used (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/500 -1/350) = negative.

So ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * (negative number)

But ΔH° is negative. So (negative number) multiplied by (negative number) gives positive.

So ln(K2/K1) is positive, which implies K2 > K1. But that's the opposite of what should happen for an exothermic reaction.

So, that suggests that I made a mistake in the equation. Maybe I should have used (ΔH° / R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let's try that.

So, ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Now, with ΔH° = -107,947.2 J/mol.

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/350 - 1/500) = (500 - 350)/(350*500) )= 150/(175000)= 0.00085714.

Multiply by (ΔH° / R):

(-107947.2 / 8.314) * 0.00085714.

Wait, compute the first part: -107947.2 /8.314 ≈ -12,937.5.

Then multiply by 0.00085714: -12,937.5 * 0.00085714 ≈ -11.12.

So ln(K2/K1) = -11.12.

Which implies K2/K1 = e^(-11.12) ≈ 1.65e-5.

Therefore, K2 = K1 * 1.65e-5 = 14.4e-5 * 1.65e-5 ≈ 23.76e-10.

Wait, so K2 is about 2.376e-9.

Wait, but earlier, when I did the calculation, I thought K2 was about 2.135e-9. So, both methods give similar results.

So, K is approximately 2.376e-9.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting the K2 as 2.376e-9, but initially, I thought K2 was 2.135e-9. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exponents more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use exact calculations.

Wait, maybe I should compute e^(-11.12) precisely.

Using a calculator: e^(-11.12) = 1 / e^(11.12).

Compute e^11.12:

e^10 = 22026.4658.

e^10.12 = e^(10 + 0.12) = e^10 * e^0.12.

e^0.12 ≈ 1.1274969.

So e^10.12 ≈ 22026.4658 * 1.1274969 ≈ Let's compute this.

22026 * 1.1274969.

22026 * 1 = 22026.

22026 * 0.1274969 ≈ Let's compute 22026 * 0.1 = 2202.6, 22026 * 0.0274969 ≈ 606.7 (approx).

So total ≈ 2202.6 + 606.7 = 2809.3.

So, e^10.12 ≈ 22026 + 2809.3 ≈ 24835.3.

Then e^11.12 = e^(10.12) * e^1.0 ≈ 24835.3 * 2.71828 ≈ Let's compute 24835 * 2.71828.

24835 * 2 = 49,670.

24835 * 0.71828 ≈ Let's compute 24835 * 0.7 = 17,384.5, 24835 * 0.01828 ≈ 454.2.

So, 17,384.5 + 454.2 = 17,838.7.

Total e^11.12 ≈ 49,670 + 17,838.7 = 67,508.7.

So, e^(-11.12) = 1 / 67,508.7 ≈ 1.483e-5.

So K2 = K1 * 1.483e-5 = 14.4e-5 * 1.483e-5 = ?

Compute 14.4 * 1.483 = Let's calculate.

14 * 1.483 = 20.762.

0.4 * 1.483 = 0.5932.

So total is 20.762 + 0.5932 = 21.3552.

So, K2 = 21.3552e-10 = 2.1355e-9.

So, K2 is approximately 2.1355e-9.

Wait, but earlier when I did the equation, I thought it was about 2.376e-9. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the correct K is about 2.135e-9.

Wait, but the question is about the conversion to K. So, perhaps K2 is 2.135e-9.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute K2 as K1 * e^(ΔH°/R (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the exponent correctly.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the equation earlier. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the correct equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R ) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Which, when ΔH° is negative, and (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, because T2 > T1, so (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive? Wait, no.

Wait, T2 is 350 K, T1 is 500 K.

So, 1/T1 is 0.002, 1/T2 is 0.00285714.

So, (1/T1 - 1/T2) is 0.002 - 0.00285714 = -0.00085714.

So,

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH° / R) * (-0.00085714 )

ΔH° is -107,947.2 J/mol.

So,

(ΔH° / R) = (-107947.2) / 8.314 ≈ -12937.5.

Multiply by (-0.00085714):

(-12937.5) * (-0.00085714) ≈ 11.12.

So,

ln(K2/K1) = 11.12.

Thus, K2/K1 = e^11.12 ≈67,508.7.

So, K2 = K1 * 67,508.7 =14.4e-5 * 67508.7 ≈ 14.4e-5 *6.75e4= 14.4e-5 *6.75e4=14.4 *6.75 *1e-1.

Because 1e-5 * 1e4 = 1e-1.

So,

14.4 *6.75 = let's compute.

14 *6 =84, 14 *0.75=10.5, 0.4*6=2.4, 0.4*0.75=0.3.

Wait, alternatively, 14.4 *6.75 = (14 + 0.4) * (6 + 0.75) = 14*6 +14*0.75 +0.4*6 +0.4*0.75.

14*6=84.

14*0.75=10.5.

0.4*6=2.4.

0.4*0.75=0.3.

Sum: 84 +10.5=94.5; 94.5 +2.4=96.9; 96.9 +0.3=97.2.

So, 14.4 *6.75=97.2.

So, K2 =97.2 *1e-1=9.72.

Wait, that's K2=9.72.

Wait, that's a big difference from my earlier calculation.

Wait, but that can't be right, because K2 is supposed to be lower than K1 for an exothermic reaction.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate 14.4e-5 *67508.7.

14.4e-5 is 0.000144.

Multiply by 67508.7: 0.000144 *67508.7.

Compute 0.000144 *67508.7.

0.000144 *67508.7 = 0.000144 *6.75e4 = 0.000144 *6.75 *1e4.

Compute 0.000144 *6.75 = let's compute 0.0001 *6.75 = 0.000675; 0.000044 *6.75=0.000294. So total is 0.000675 +0.000294=0.000969.

Multiply by 1e4: 0.000969 *1e4=0.969.

So, K2=0.969.

Wait, that's K2=0.969.

But that's only 0.969, which is K2=0.969, so K2/K1=0.969 /14.4e-5=0.969 /0.000144=6750.833...

Wait, that's exactly what we had before.

So, K2=0.969.

Wait, but that's only 0.969, which is a very low K. Which would correspond to a very low conversion. Hmm.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the converter is converting nitrogen to ammonia, which is the forward reaction.

Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium conversion, which is the extent of conversion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the conversion using the van't Hoff equation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value of K, then compute the conversion from K.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can compute the conversion from the van't Hoff's K.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the conversion using the formula:

ln(1 - α) = -ΔG°/(RT)

Wait, but I think that's the formula for the conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the van't Hoff equation.

Wait, let me think again.

We have K, which is the equilibrium constant, and the conversion α is given by:

ln(1 - α) = -ΔG°/(RT)

Wait, but I think that's the formula for the conversion.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the conversion as:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH°/(RT)})

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the approximation for small α.

Wait, if α is small, then ln(1-α) ≈ -α - α²/2 - ... So, for small α, ln(1-α) ≈ -α.

But I think this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the conversion using the van't Hoff equation.

Wait, another approach is to compute the conversion using the equation derived from the van't Hoff equation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the following formula:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH°/(RT)}) * (1/(Z))

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the conversion using the equation:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH/(RT)}) * (1/(K))

Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH/(RT)}) * (1/(K)) ?

Wait, perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let me think again.

The conversion is the fraction of the initial material that has been converted into the product.

The relation between the conversion (α) and the equilibrium constant (K) is given by:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH/(RT)}) * (1/(K))

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to find the correct formula.

Wait, the conversion can be found using the relation:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH/(RT)}) * (1/(K))

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔG°/(RT)}) * (1/(K))

Wait, but in this case, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy, but in our case, ΔG° is negative because it's an exothermic reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it that way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the conversion using the formula:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH/(RT)}) * (1/(K))

Wait, but I think that's incorrect, because for exothermic reactions, the conversion is higher, not lower.

Wait, no, wait. For exothermic reactions, the products are not favored, so the conversion is lower. So, the lower the conversion, the lower the K.

Wait, but wait, the conversion is not directly related to K in a linear way. So, perhaps I should compute it using the conversion equation.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the conversion using the following equation:

α = (1 - e^{-ΔH/(RT)}) * (1/(K))

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct.
