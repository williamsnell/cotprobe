Okay, so I've got this question about the effect of temperature on the length of a strip of iron. Hmm, I remember that when you heat something, it usually changes its properties, like expansion. So for metals, especially iron, which is a metal that expands a lot, heating it should cause it to expand. But wait, let me think this through.

The question asks what happens to the length of the iron strip when its temperature increases. The options are A to J. I think I should consider thermal expansion. Oh right, most materials expand when heated. So if the temperature increases, the length should increase because the atoms vibrate more, stretching the structure.

Looking at the options: A says the length increases first then decreases. That doesn't sound right. I don't think heating a metal would cause it to contract back. Expansion is the opposite of contraction. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says the length decreases as it gets longer. That doesn't make sense. Because the length should just get longer with higher temperature, not shorter.

Option C says it increases exponentially. That's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the standard behavior. I think thermal expansion is usually linear, not exponential. Unless under extreme conditions, but I don't recall that. So maybe C isn't the right answer.

Option D: remains the same. No, that's not right. Temperature change would cause expansion.

Option E: may increase and may decrease. That doesn't make sense. Heating should always cause an increase in length. No decrease here.

Option F: decreases in thickness as it gets longer. Wait, the question is about length. So F is about the thickness, not the length. So F is talking about the other dimension, so it's unrelated.

Option G: also increases. That sounds correct because as temperature increases, length increases. So G is a strong candidate.

Option H: becomes unpredictable. Probably not. It's a straightforward thermal expansion scenario.

Option I: oscillates. No, there's no indication of that. It's a steady expansion.

Option J: actually decreases. Definitely not, because heating should cause an increase.

So the correct answer should be option G: also increases. Because temperature rise leads to thermal expansion of the iron strip, making its length longer.

The correct answer is G: also increases. When the temperature of a strip of iron is increased, thermal expansion causes the length to increase. 

Answer: G
