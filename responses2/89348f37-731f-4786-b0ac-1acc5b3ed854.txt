Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about attitudes toward premarital and extramarital sex over time. Let me try to break it down.

The question says: "Over the past several decades, attitudes toward premarital sex have __________; attitudes toward extramarital sex have __________." The options are A to J, each giving different combinations of changes in attitudes.

First, I need to recall what I know about how people's attitudes have changed over time. I remember that premarital sex has been a big issue in the past, especially in many societies. I think that in the past, people were more restrictive about it, maybe even against it. So, I believe attitudes toward premarital sex were becoming more permissive in the past, which would mean more people felt it was acceptable. Wait, no, no—wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. I think that the opposite is true. In the past, maybe it's the other way around. Like, in the 1980s, I think there was a push for more consent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the attitudes became more permissive because of the increased access to information and the desire for more privacy and a positive sexual experience. So, over time, more people were open to premarital sex because the options were more favorable.

Then, for extramarital sex, I'm pretty sure it's the opposite. In the past, especially in places where there were strict religious or cultural norms, people were either more reluctant or opposed to having another sexual relationship. As societal norms changed, people became more accepting. So, the attitudes toward extramarital sex have become more permissive or have changed in some other way.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: more permissive for premarital, remained constant. That doesn't seem right because I think extramarital has changed.

Option B: remained constant for premarital, more less accepting. That feels off because I think premarital was more permissive.

Option C: remained constant for premarital, more permissive for extramarital. Hmm, that would mean extramarital is more accepting, which makes sense. But wait, premarital was more permissive, so option C says premarital stays the same—no, that's wrong.

Option D: more permissive for premarital, become less accepting. Wait, that can't be right. If it's becoming less accepting, that would mean people are less open to it, but I think the opposite happened. So maybe D is incorrect.

Option E: less permissive for premarital, more accepting for extramarital. No, that doesn't seem right because premarital should have become more permissive, not less.

Option F: remained constant for both. Not likely, as I know both have changed.

Option G: less permissive for premarital, remained constant for extramarital. No, that can't be right.

Option H: less accepting for premarital, more permissive for extramarital. Wait, no, I think premarital was more permissive, not less.

Option I: more permissive for premarital, more accepting for extramarital. That would mean both have changed in the same direction, but I thought premarital was more permissive, and extramarital became less restrictive.

Option J: less accepting for both. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think again. Let me try to recall more accurately. I think that in the past, especially in certain societies, people were more reluctant to have premarital sex because it was perceived as negative and a loss of privacy, leading to less acceptance. But as social norms changed, more people were open to it. So, attitudes toward premarital sex have become more permissive.

As for extramarital, this has been a topic of debate. In the past, some cultures have been more reluctant to have another sexual relationship, as it's seen as a lesser experience. But with more education and access to information, people are more accepting. So, the attitudes toward extramarital sex have become more permissive as well. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are about becoming more permissive or becoming less accepting. So, if both have become more permissive, that would match which option?

Looking at the options:

Option H: become less accepting; became more permissive. No, because premarital should be more permissive, not less.

Option I: more permissive for premarital, more accepting for extramarital. But I thought both are more permissive.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify: permissive refers to more accepting. So, if someone says their attitudes toward premarital sex have become more permissive, that means more people feel it's acceptable. For extramarital, if it's more permissive, then more people are open to it.

But in reality, in the past, the attitudes toward premarital were more restrictive, and with the passage of time, they became more permissive. But for extramarital, I think there was a shift as well. In some societies, it was a negative experience, but with more information and education, people are more accepting. So, perhaps both have become more permissive.

Wait, but the options don't include an option where both are more permissive. Let me look again.

Options:

A: more permissive for premarital, remained constant.

B: remained constant for premarital, more less accepting.

C: remained constant for premarital, more permissive for extramarital.

D: more permissive for premarital, become less accepting.

E: less permissive for premarital, more accepting for extramarital.

F: remained constant.

G: less permissive for premarital, remained constant for extramarital.

H: less accepting, more permissive.

I: more permissive for premarital, more accepting for extramarital.

J: less accepting for both.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought extramarital was becoming more permissive. So, if both have become more permissive, then the correct option would be something like both becoming more permissive. But looking at the options, none have both becoming more. So perhaps the options are wrong, but I have to pick the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering. Maybe in the past, premarital was less permissive, but in the present, it's more. And for extramarital, the situation is more complex. Or perhaps extramarital is becoming less permissive because of different factors.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual history. I've heard that in the 90s, the rise of the internet and the availability of more information has led people to accept more forms of sex outside of the traditional premarital context. So, for extramarital, attitudes are becoming more permissive.

As for premarital, perhaps the opposite occurred. The past may have been more restrictive, but as social norms changed, more people accepted it. So, the premarital attitudes have become more permissive.

If that's the case, then the correct option would be one where premarital is more permissive, and extramarital is more permissive as well. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option I says premarital is more permissive, and extramarital is more accepting. Wait, no, option I says "more permissive" for both. But in reality, maybe premarital is more permissive, and extramarital is more permissive as well. So, which option has that?

Wait, looking at the options, the correct one where both are becoming more permissive is none, because the options don't have both becoming more. The closest is option I, which says more permissive for both. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but I remember that in the past, the attitudes toward premarital sex were more restrictive, but with the rise of more information and access to the internet, people were more open to it. So, the correct change for premarital is becoming more permissive.

As for extramarital, perhaps it's the opposite. Maybe in the past, people were more reluctant, but now they are more open. So, both have become more permissive.

If that's the case, then the correct option would be something like premarital more permissive, extramarital more permissive. But looking at the options, that's not present.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not sure because I might be mixing up permissive and less accepting.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the terms. "Permissive" means accepting and open, while "less accepting" means closing in on it.

In the past, premarital sex was perceived as a negative experience, so people were less accepting. But with more awareness and information, it's become more permissive.

For extramarital, maybe in some cultures, it's been a negative experience, but now people are more accepting. So, perhaps extramarital has become more permissive as well.

But if that's the case, then both are more permissive. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is H: become less accepting; became more permissive. No, that's not correct because premarital should have become more permissive.

Wait, another thought: maybe the correct answer is option I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the trends, but about the current situation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options again. Let me read each option carefully.

Option I: more permissive for premarital, more accepting for extramarital.

If that's the case, then for premarital, it's more permissive (more open), and extramarital is more permissive (more open). But I'm not sure if I'm correct about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I need to think about whether both are becoming more permissive.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me try to remember from memory.

I think that in the past, premarital sex was perceived as unsafe and a loss of privacy, so people were less accepting (less permissive). But as social norms changed, more people accepted it, so it became more permissive. So, for premarital, the change was becoming more permissive.

As for extramarital, in some societies, it's been a negative experience, so people were less accepting (less permissive). But with more education and information, they've become more permissive. So, for extramarital, the change is becoming more permissive as well.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm not remembering correctly.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option H: become less accepting; became more permissive.

No, that's not matching.

Option I: more permissive for premarital, more accepting for extramarital.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. "More permissive" means more accepting. So, if both have become more accepting, that would be option I.

But I thought that for extramarital, the change was more permissive. So, perhaps option I is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as: the passage of time has led to more awareness of extramarital as a positive experience, leading to more acceptance. So, perhaps extramarital has become more permissive. Meanwhile, premarital has changed to be more permissive as well.

If that's the case, then the correct option would be one where both are more permissive. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the general trend. I think in the 90s, there was a significant shift towards more permissive attitudes towards both. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: let's look for common knowledge.

In the 1990s, the rise of internet and social media changed perceptions. People became more open about sex outside the traditional context. So, for both premarital and extramarital, the attitudes have shifted towards more permissive.

So, the correct answer would be that both have become more permissive. But looking at the options, none have both becoming more. So, perhaps the correct answer is option I, which says both are more permissive. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the current state. In recent years, I've heard that the attitudes toward premarital sex have become more permissive, but I'm not certain about extramarital.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I should try to recall which option is correct. Maybe I'm confusing myself.

Looking back, I think I remember that in the past, the attitudes toward premarital sex had been more restrictive, but with the rise of more information and the internet, it's become more permissive. So, for premarital, becoming more permissive is correct.

As for extramarital, perhaps it's the same: more permissive. So, if both are more permissive, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option I. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The options are:

A: more permissive pre, remained constant extr.

B: remained constant pre, less accept extr.

C: remained pre, more permissive extr.

D: more permissive pre, less accept extr.

E: less permissive pre, more accept extr.

F: remained pre, remained accept extr.

G: less permissive pre, remained accept extr.

H: less accept pre, more permissive extr.

I: more permissive pre, more accept extr.

J: less accept both.

If I'm correct that both have become more permissive, then the correct option is I. But I'm not certain if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps extramarital has become less permissive. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the opposite is true. Maybe in the past, premarital was more restrictive, but now it's more permissive. For extramarital, perhaps it's the other way around: more restrictive in the past, more permissive now.

In that case, the correct answer would be option H, where premarital is less accepting (so less permissive) and extramarital is more permissive.

But I'm not sure. I think I need to make a decision.

Given that I think premarital has become more permissive, and I'm not certain about extramarital, but the options don't have an option where both are more permissive, I'll have to choose the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I.

But I'm not sure. Another approach is to think about the answer being option I, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps in the past, the attitudes toward premarital were less permissive, but now they are more. And for extramarital, perhaps it's the opposite: they were more permissive in the past, and now they are more permissive as well.

In that case, the correct answer would be option I.

But I'm not certain. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Based on what I know, the correct answer is option I: more permissive for premarital, more permissive for extramarital. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct answer is option H: less accept, more permissive. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I. I think that's the only option where both are becoming more permissive, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another point: perhaps in the past, the trends were different. Maybe in the past, both had become less permissive, but now they are more permissive. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H: becoming less accepting, more permissive. I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Perhaps I should try to think of the general knowledge.

I think that in the past, the attitudes toward premarital sex were more restrictive. Now, with the internet and more awareness, people are more open. So, premarital is becoming more permissive.

As for extramarital, perhaps in some societies, it's a negative experience, so people were less accepting. But with more education and information, they're more open. So, extramarital is becoming more permissive.

If that's the case, the correct option would be one where both are more permissive. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, I'm going in circles. I think I'll have to make a decision.
</think>

The question asks about the attitudes toward premarital and extramarital sex over time. To determine the correct answer, I analyzed the trends and considered each option carefully.

1. **Premarital Sex**: Historically, attitudes toward premarital sex were more restrictive and perceived as negative. However, with the rise of more information and the internet, people became more open, leading to a shift toward openness and becoming more permissive.

2. **Extramarital Sex**: Extramarital sex has been a topic of debate in the past. In some cultures, it was perceived as a negative experience, leading to less acceptance. However, with advancements in education and access to information, people have become more accepting and open, leading to an increase in openness toward extramarital sex.

3. **Evaluation of Options**: After considering the trends, I concluded that both premarital and extramarital attitudes toward sex have shifted toward becoming more permissive. However, none of the options perfectly reflect this conclusion. Among the options provided, **Option I** states that both have become more permissive, which aligns with the analysis if that were the correct choice.
