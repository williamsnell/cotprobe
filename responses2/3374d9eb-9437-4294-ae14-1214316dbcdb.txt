Okay, so I have this problem about metallic coatings and optical density. Let me see if I can figure it out.

The question says that a metallic coating absorbs 88% of the incident light. So, that means it allows 12% to pass through, right? Because 100% minus 88% is 12%. So the transmittance of the coating itself must be 12%. Wait, but optical density—I remember that's a measure related to how much light is absorbed or transmitted. The optical density (OD) is log base 10 of the ratio of incident to transmitted light. So OD = log10(I0/I), where I0 is original intensity, I is transmitted.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the formula is OD = -log10(T), where T is the transmittance. So if a coating has T = 0.12, then OD would be log10(1/0.12) = log10(8.333), which is about 0.9208. But I'm not sure if I'm getting the exact formula right, but I think I remember that it's the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of incident to transmitted, so yes, T = 10^(-OD).

But the question is about a thin film that has one half the optical density of the coating. So if the coating's OD is some value, the film's OD is half that. Let's think: the coating's OD is OD_coating = log10(1/0.12) = log10(8.333) ≈ 0.9208.

Wait, actually, wait a second. Let me double-check: the transmittance T is 12% (0.12). So OD is -log10(T). So log10(0.12) is about -0.9208. So OD is 0.9208. So the film has one half the optical density, so its OD is 0.9208 / 2 ≈ 0.4604.

Now, the film's transmittance would be 10^(-0.4604) = let's see. 10^0.4604 is about 2.873, because 10^0.4771 is 3. So 0.4604 is a bit less. Let me calculate:

10^0.46 is approx 2.89. So 10^0.4604 is about 2.89, so 10^-0.4604 is 1/2.89 ≈ 0.346. So the film's transmittance is about 34.6%, which is option C.

Wait, but another approach: The film has OD = 0.4604. So T = 10^(-OD) = 10^(-0.4604). Let me compute that accurately.

I remember that 10^0.4604 is approximately 2.875. So 10^-0.4604 is about 1/2.875 ≈ 0.3478, which is 34.78%, so 34.6% when rounded. That's option C.

So the film's transmittance is about 34.6%, which is option C.

To determine the transmittance of the thin film, we start by analyzing the given information. The metalic coating absorbs 88% of the incident light, meaning it transmits 12% (since \(100\% - 88\% = 12\%\)). The optical density (OD) is related to transmittance \(T\) by the formula:

\[
OD = -\log_{10}(T)
\]

For the coating, the transmittance \(T = 0.12\), so:

\[
OD_{\text{coating}} = -\log_{10}(0.12) \approx 0.9208
\]

The thin film has one half the optical density of the coating, so:

\[
OD_{\text{film}} = \frac{OD_{\text{coating}}}{2} = \frac{0.9208}{2} \approx 0.4604
\]

The transmittance of the film is then:

\[
T_{\text{film}} = 10^{-OD_{\text{film}}} = 10^{-0.4604}
\]

Using approximations, \(10^{0.4604} \approx 2.875\), so:

\[
T_{\text{film}} = \frac{1}{2.875} \approx 0.3478
\]

This corresponds to approximately \(34.78\%\), which rounds to \(34.6\%\). Thus, the transmittance of the film is \(34.6\%\).
