Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with thermodynamics. But I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about calculating the heat of reaction at 298 K using the given standard heats of formation. 

The reaction is Na₂O(s) + 2 HCl(g) ⇌ 2 NaCl(s) + H₂O(g). Wait, no, the product is H₂O(l) instead. Wait, the given reaction is written as H₂O(1), which I think is H₂O(l). Oh, right! Because in the standard data, H₂O is listed under (l) for liquid. So the reaction is Na₂O(s) + 2 HCl(g) → 2 NaCl(s) + H₂O(l).

I remember that the heat of reaction can be found using Hess's Law, by calculating the standard enthalpy change using the standard heats of formation. The formula is ΔH°rxn = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants).

Let me list out the given standard heats of formation:

Na₂O(s): 100.7 kcal/mol
HCl(g): 22.0 kcal/mol
NaCl(s): 98.6 kcal/mol
H₂O(l): 68.32 kcal/mol

Wait, but wait, the reaction's products are NaCl(s) and H₂O(l), and the reactants are Na₂O(s) and HCl(g).

So products: 2 NaCl(s) and H₂O(l). So their ΔHf sums would be 2*(98.6) + 68.32.

Reactants: Na₂O(s) and 2 HCl(g). So sum is 100.7 + 2*(22.0).

Wait, let me compute each part correctly.

Products: 2 NaCl(s) → 2 * 98.6 = 197.2. H2O(l) → 68.32. So total products: 197.2 + 68.32 = 265.52 kcal.

Reactants: Na₂O(s) →100.7. 2 HCl →2*22.0=44.0. So sum is 100.7 +44=144.7.

So ΔHrxn = 265.52 - 144.7 = 120.82 kcal.

Wait, wait, but wait! The reaction as written is as written, so the computation is correct. But wait, the reaction is written as Na₂O + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2O(l). So the formula is correct as I wrote.

Wait, but the options are all about the heat of reaction, which is ΔH. So I think the calculation gives a positive 120.82, but looking at the options, option H is -120.82. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. 

Products: 2*(98.6) = 197.2. H2O(l) is 68.32. So 197.2 +68.32 = 265.52. Correct.

Reactants: 100.7 + 2*22.0 = 100.7 +44=144.7. Correct.

So 265.52 - 144.7 = 120.82. Hmm. So ΔH is positive 120.82 kcal. But looking at the options, option H is -120.82. So that suggests that the correct answer is H, which is -120.82, but wait, that doesn't match. Hmm. Wait, did I get the products and reactants reversed?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula: products minus reactants. So the calculation was correct.

Wait, but wait, the correct sign: when using ΔHf, products minus reactants. So in this case, the reaction is written as products minus reactants, so 265.52 -144.7 is positive 120.82. So the heat of reaction is +120.82, which would be +120.82 kcal.

But looking at the options, option H is -120.82. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see the options again.

Options:

A: 22.0
B: -100.7
C: -68.32
D:120.82
E: -55.1
F:-85.98
G:98.6
H:-120.82
I:-22.0
J:-98.6

Wait, I see option D is 120.82, which matches what I computed (120.82). But wait, the reaction's ΔH is positive, meaning it's an endothermic reaction. So why is option D positive and option H negative? Because option D is positive, and H is negative. So the correct answer should be D, but wait, in the options, the way the data is given, perhaps the calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe I have a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Products: 2 NaCl(s) is 2 *98.6 = 197.2. H2O(l) is 68.32. Total 265.52.

Reactants: Na₂O is 100.7. 2 HCl is 44.0. Total 144.7.

So 265.52 -144.7 =120.82. Positive. So reaction is endothermic, heat is positive.

But looking at the options, option D is 120.82. So the correct answer would be option D.

But wait, looking again at the reaction, if the products are 2 NaCl(s) and H2O(l), that's correct.

Wait, but wait, in the given data, H2O is listed under (l), which is liquid. So the reaction produces H2O(l), so that's correct.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the question is asking for the heat of reaction as written, but perhaps I have to take into account the signs correctly. Let me think again.

The formula is correct: products minus reactants. So 120.82 is the correct value.

But wait, looking at the options, option H is -120.82. That's the negative of what I have. So why is that? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the standard heat of formation of NaCl. Let me check: the standard heat of formation for NaCl(s) is given as 98.6, correct? Yes.

HCl(g) is 22.0, correct.

Na₂O is 100.7, correct.

H2O(l) is 68.32, correct.

Wait, so calculation steps are correct, leading to 120.82 kcal. But looking at the options, option D is 120.82. So the correct answer is option D.

But wait, one of the given options is E: -55.1 ±0.6 kcal. Where does that come from? Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check the alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the reaction as written. Let me re-express the reaction.

The reaction is 2 HCl(g) + Na₂O(s) → 2 NaCl(s) + H₂O(g). Wait, but the product is H₂O(l), so that would affect the calculation. Oh wait, no. Let me think: in the given reaction, the products are 2 NaCl(s) and H2O(l). So in the standard equation, it's written as such.

So, the calculation is correct. So the sum of products is 197.2 +68.32=265.52 kcal. Sum of reactants is 100.7 +44=144.7. So 265.52 -144.7=120.82.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 120.82, so that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait! I'm looking at the options again. Option H is -120.82, so that's the negative of that. So if I made a mistake in the order of products and reactants, that would invert the sign. Wait, let me think.

Hmmm, no. The formula is products minus reactants. So if the products are 265.52 and reactants 144.7, it's 120.82.

But maybe the question was about the reverse reaction? No, the question says calculate the heat of reaction, which is ΔH, which is products minus reactants. So positive, so the heat is positive 120.82. So the correct option is D.

But wait, another thought: the reaction as written is the forward reaction, so the heat of reaction is positive. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, option D is 120.82, so that's the correct answer. So the correct answer is D.

To calculate the heat of reaction (ΔH°) at 298 K using the given standard heats of formation, we apply Hess's Law: 

\[
\Delta H_{\text{rxn}} = \sum \Delta H_f^{\circ} (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta H_f^{\circ} (\text{reactants})
\]

### Given Data:
- Standard heats of formation:
  - Na₂O(s): 100.7 kcal/mol
  - HCl(g): 22.0 kcal/mol
  - NaCl(s): 98.6 kcal/mol
  - H₂O(l): 68.32 kcal/mol

### Reaction:
\[
\text{Na}_2\text{O}(s) + 2 \text{HCl}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \text{NaCl}(s) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

### Calculation:
1. **Products**:
   - 2 moles of NaCl(s): \( 2 \times 98.6 = 197.2 \, \text{kcal} \)
   - 1 mole of H₂O(l): \( 68.32 \, \text{kcal} \)
   - Total products: \( 197.2 + 68.32 = 265.52 \, \text{kcal} \)

2. **Reactants**:
   - 1 mole of Na₂O(s): \( 100.7 \, \text{kcal} \)
   - 2 moles of HCl(g): \( 2 \times 22.0 = 44.0 \, \text{kcal} \)
   - Total reactants: \( 100.7 + 44.0 = 144.7 \, \text{kcal} \)

3. **Heat of Reaction**:
   \[
   \Delta H_{\text{rxn}} = 265.52 - 144.7 = 120.82 \, \text{kcal}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option D**: \( 120.82 \pm 1.81 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value of \( 120.82 \, \text{kcal} \).
- **Option H**: \( -120.82 \pm 1.3 \, \text{kcal} \) is the negative of the calculated value and is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
