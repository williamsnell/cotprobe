Okay, so I've got this math problem here: −4 plus (−3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you add two negative numbers, you're essentially adding their absolute values but keeping the negative sign. So, −4 is negative four, and −3 is negative three. 

Wait, another way to look at it is on the number line. If I start at −4 and then move three more steps to the left (since I'm adding a negative), I should end up at −7. Let me visualize that. Starting at −4, subtracting 3 would land me at −7. So, −4 + (−3) equals −7. 

Let me check that with another method. Using the rule, adding two negatives: −4 + (−3) = -(4 + 3) = -7. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I'm making a mistake here. So, the answer should be −7.

The calculation involves adding two negative numbers. When adding two negatives, you add their absolute values and retain the negative sign. 

-4 + (-3) = -(4 + 3) = -7.

So, the correct answer is −7.

Answer: D: −7
