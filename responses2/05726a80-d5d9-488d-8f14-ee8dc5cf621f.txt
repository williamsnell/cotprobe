Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about blood types and genetics. Hmm, I think I remember a bit about this. Let me try to work through it.

The question says that a child with type A B blood inherits IA from one parent and IB from the other. Then, the child has both A and B glycoproteins on all red blood cells. I need to figure out what this pattern is called.

Wait, blood type is determined by the presence of antigens on the RBCs. Type A means the RBC has both A and B antigens, I think. Type B has B and O. So a child with AB blood type would have both A and B antigens. But wait, the question says the child has both A and B on all red blood cells. So that makes sense for AB blood type.

The question is about the expression of these antigens. The blood cells would have both A and B proteins, right? But how is that expressed? I remember that during blood formation, antigens are recognized by red blood cells, which then react with antibodies to produce the corresponding proteins. So the expression of the antigens happens, but the actual presence of the proteins is more about the presence of the antigen.

Wait, but the question is about the pattern of expression. So the child has both A and B on the RBC surface. That would mean that the antibodies (which recognize the antigens) are producing both A and B proteins. But why would the RBC have both? Oh, because the presence of one antigen can trigger the production of both proteins. Or perhaps it's a result of the two antigens being expressed together.

Wait, the question says the child carries both A and B glycoproteins. So the RBCs have both. How is that expressed? I think that the presence of both antigens triggers the expression of both proteins. So the pattern is a result of the combination of the two antigens, not a genetic recombination or anything else.

What's the terminology here? The options are about genetic terms. Let's look at the options.

Option B is genetic recombination. That's when two alleles from different parents combine to produce a new allele. But the question isn't about allele combination; it's about the expression of proteins.

Option A is recessive inheritance. That's when the same allele is passed on from both parents, leading to a recessive trait. But the question is about the expression of two different proteins, not recessive traits.

Option D, pleiotropy, is when a gene affects multiple traits. Since the child has two different proteins, this fits. But wait, what's the question again about? The pattern of expression is referred to as... So, the expression is due to each allele combining the two antigens.

Option E is codominance. That's when both alleles are expressed fully in the phenotype. So if someone has both A and B, it's codominance. But the question is about the expression on the RBC, not the presence of the alleles.

Wait, the question is about the expression of the proteins. For example, someone with blood type AB has both A and B antigens. The RBCs express both proteins. So the expression is due to the presence of both antigens.

I think the term for when two proteins are produced because two antigens are present is called codominance, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's just the combination of the two antigens leading to both proteins being present.

Wait, other options: linkage (I think refers to genes on the same chromosome), genetic drift (random changes in allele frequencies), etc.

Looking back, the question is about the expression of the glycoproteins. So the pattern is that both are expressed because the RBC has both antigens. So what is that called?

Hmm, I think the correct term is 'codominance' because both proteins are expressed together. Or wait, codominance is when two alleles produce a phenotype where both are expressed. For example, in the blood type AB, both A and B are expressed, leading to AB blood type.

So the pattern of expression is codominance. So the correct answer would be E: codominance.

Wait another thought: the question is about the expression on the RBCs. So, each allele (IA and IB) combines to produce both A and B on the RBC. So the expression is codominant because both are present.

Alternatively, is it called 'genetic recombination'? No, because that's when alleles from both parents combine. But the expression is about the presence of both antigens leading to both proteins. So the correct term is codominance.

Looking again, what are the options:

A: recessive inheritance — same allele from both parents, not about expression.

B: genetic recombination — same allele.

C: incomplete dominance — two alleles same trait, but not present here.

D: pleiotropy — affects multiple traits. So the presence of two different proteins.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the expression pattern. So the RBC has both A and B, which are the two antigens. So the pattern is codominance because both are expressed.

So the correct answer is E: codominance.

The question involves a child with type A B blood who inherits IA from one parent and IB from the other, resulting in the expression of both A and B glycoproteins on all red blood cells. The task is to identify the pattern of expression referred to by this scenario.

1. **Option A: Recessive inheritance** — This refers to a genetic phenomenon where the same allele is inherited from both parents, leading to a recessive trait. This does not apply to the expression of two distinct proteins.

2. **Option B: Genetic recombination** — This involves the combination of alleles from different parents. While this process occurs during genetic recombination, it is unrelated to the expression of two distinct proteins.

3. **Option C: Incomplete dominance** — This occurs when two alleles of the same trait produce a blending phenotype. However, this is not relevant to the expression of two different proteins.

4. **Option D: Pleiotropy** — This refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. While the presence of two antigens can influence multiple traits, the question focuses on the expression of two distinct proteins, making this option less relevant.

5. **Option E: Codominance** — This describes a situation where both alleles of a gene are expressed fully in the same phenotype. In this case, the child's blood type is AB, meaning both A and B antigens are present, leading to codominance of the glycoproteins on the RBC surface.

6. **Options F through J** — These terms (polygenic, dominant inheritance, genetic drift, epistasis, linkage) are not applicable to the scenario described.

The correct term for the pattern of expression of both A and B glycoproteins on the RBC surface is **codominance**.
