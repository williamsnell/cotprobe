Okay, so I've got this question about random walks and forecasts. Hmm, I remember from my stats class that a random walk with drift is a process where each step is determined by a random variable plus a constant drift. Let me think about this.

The question is about the optimal one-step ahead forecast of the change in y. The options are various statistical measures. Let's break it down.

A random walk with drift (RWY) model is usually written as y_t = y_{t-1} + b + ε_t, where b is the drift and ε_t is the error term. So each step is the previous value plus the drift plus some noise.

Now, a one-step ahead forecast would involve predicting y_{t+1} based on y_t. Using the RWY model, y_{t+1} = y_t + b + ε_{t+1}. So the expected value forecast would be the expected value of y_{t+1} given y_t.

Wait, but in a random walk, the expected value E[ε_t] is zero because it's a random disturbance. So the best forecast without any information about future errors would just be the current value plus the drift. That is, E[y_{t+1} | y_t] = y_t + b.

Looking at the options, option H is "The current value of y plus the drift b." So that's the forecast. But wait, is there a better way to express that? Or is this the correct approach.

Alternatively, the forecast might be based on the last observed change. Suppose the change at time t is Δy_t = y_t - y_{t-1}. Then, the RWY can be written as y_t = y_{t-1} + b + ε_t. So Δy_t = b + ε_t. So the expected change in the next step would be E[Δy_{t+1}] = b + E[ε_{t+1}] = b, since E[ε] is zero.

Wait, but that's the same as saying the drift is the expected change. So the one-step ahead forecast would be y_{t+1} = y_t + expected change, which is y_t + b. So that's consistent with option H.

Wait, another way to think about it: the optimal forecast is the conditional expectation, which is y_t plus the drift. So the optimal forecast is y_{t} + b. So option H is correct.

But let me look at the options again. Option D is y_t minus b, which would be the opposite. Option H is y_t plus b. So yes, H is correct.

Wait, but sometimes when you have a random walk without drift, the best forecast would be the current value. But here, since it's a RWY, the drift is considered, so the forecast is current plus drift.

So the correct answer should be H.

The question concerns the optimal one-step ahead forecast of the change in a variable \( y \) that follows a random walk with drift. A random walk with drift is defined by the equation \( y_t = y_{t-1} + b + \varepsilon_t \), where \( b \) is the drift and \( \varepsilon_t \) is a random disturbance with mean zero.

To forecast the change in \( y \) one step ahead, we use the expected value approach. The expected change in \( y \) is given by \( E[\Delta y_{t+1}] = b \), since the expected value of the random disturbance term \( \varepsilon_{t+1} \) is zero. Therefore, the optimal one-step ahead forecast is:

\[
\text{Forecast} = y_t + b
\]

This corresponds to option H. 

Answer: H
