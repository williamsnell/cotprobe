Okay, so I have this group theory question here. The problem says that in a group G, the equation (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 holds for all a and b in G. I need to determine which of the options A through J is necessarily true about G. The options are about whether G is abelian, has a specific order, is non-abelian, finite, cyclic, etc. Hmm, let me think.

First, let me recall what (ab)^2 means. It's equal to ab multiplied by itself, so (ab)(ab). And a^2 b^2 is a multiplied by a, then multiplied by b multiplied by b. So the equation is saying that these two expressions are equal for any a and b in G.

Let me write that out algebraically: (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2.

Expanding the left side: ab * ab = a b a b.

Right side: a^2 b^2 = a a b b.

So the equation becomes a b a b = a a b b.

I can try to manipulate this equation to see what properties G must have. Let me see, perhaps I can multiply both sides by a^{-1} and b^{-1} on the left or right to simplify. Let me try multiplying the left side by a^{-1} on the left and b^{-1} on the right. That would give:

a^{-1} (a b a b) b^{-1} = a^{-1} a a b b b^{-1}.

Simplify left side: a^{-1} a is e, and b b^{-1} is e, so left side is e * e = e.

Right side: a^{-1} a is e, and b b^{-1} is e, so right side is e * e = e.

Wait, that's just e = e, which doesn't give me new information. Maybe that approach isn't helpful. Let me try another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the equation a b a b = a a b b.

If I cancel a's and b's on both sides, but I have to make sure if a and b are invertible, which they are in a group. Let me see:

Starting from a b a b = a^2 b^2.

Let me subtract a^2 from both sides, but subtraction isn't defined in groups. Alternatively, maybe I can factor a and b in some way.

Wait, maybe I can subtract a from both sides? No, that's not subtraction in a group. Alternatively, I can factor the left side.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as (ab)(ab) = (aa)(bb). Then, if I can cancel terms, that would imply something. Or maybe I can write it as abab = aabb, then abab a^{-1} b^{-1} = aabb a^{-1} b^{-1}, which would give bab = bb. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can rearrange the equation. Let's see:

(ab)^2 = a^2 b^2.

Which is abab = aabb.

Now, perhaps I can divide both sides by a from the left and b from the right. Let me see:

Left side: abab = (ab)(ab) = a (b a) b.

Right side: aabb = a (b b) b = a b^2 b.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's try to move terms around. Let me write abab = aabb.

If I subtract a on the left and subtract b on the right (but subtraction isn't a group operation). Alternatively, perhaps I can factor a from the left and b from the right.

Wait, perhaps I can write abab = aabb as a b a b = a a b b.

Now, I can multiply both sides by a^{-1} on the left and b^{-1} on the right:

a^{-1} a b a b b^{-1} = a^{-1} a a b b b^{-1}.

Simplify left: a^{-1} a is e, and b b^{-1} is e. So left side is e * e = e.

Right side: a^{-1} a is e, and b b^{-1} is e. So right side is e * e = e. Hmm, again I get e = e, which doesn't help much.

Maybe another approach. Let me consider whether the group is abelian. If G is abelian, then ab = ba for all a, b. If that's the case, then (ab)^2 = (ba)^2 = b a b a. But the right side is a^2 b^2, which is a a b b. So for abelian, (ab)^2 would be b a b a, while a^2 b^2 is a a b b.

Wait, so in the abelian case, (ab)^2 = b a b a, but a^2 b^2 = a a b b. These are equal only if b a b a = a a b b. But in an abelian group, a and b commute, so b a = a b. Let me see:

In abelian G, b a b a = (b a) (b a) = (a b) (a b) = a^2 b^2. Wait, that's exactly what I have. So if G is abelian, then (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 holds. So that means that the condition is satisfied for abelian groups. But does the converse hold? That is, if G satisfies (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b, then G is abelian?

Wait, maybe not. Suppose G is non-abelian. Let me think of a simple non-abelian group, like S3 (the symmetric group on 3 elements). Let me pick specific elements and see if (ab)^2 equals a^2 b^2.

Take S3, let's pick two transpositions, say a = (1 2), b = (2 3). Then ab is (1 2 3), and (ab)^2 is (1 2 3)(1 2 3) = (1 3 2). On the other side, a^2 is (1 2)(1 2) = e, and b^2 is (2 3)(2 3) = e. So a^2 b^2 = e e = e. So for ab = (1 2 3), (ab)^2 = (1 3 2), which is not equal to e. So in S3, this doesn't hold. So S3 is not a group where (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b.

Wait, but let me try another non-abelian group, like the dihedral group D4. Wait, but perhaps a simpler example. Let me take a cyclic group of order 3, like Z3, but that's abelian, so that won't help. Wait, I'm trying to find a non-abelian group where (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 never hold. But I'm not sure; maybe every group where (ab)^2 =a^2 b^2 is abelian.

Wait, let's think again. Let me suppose that G is not abelian. Then, there exist a and b such that ab ≠ ba. Let me see if (ab)^2 can equal a^2 b^2.

So, (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2.

Expanding, abab = a a b b.

Let me rearrange this: abab = aa bb.

Multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}.

Left side: a^{-1} (abab) b^{-1} = (a^{-1} a) (b a b^{-1} ) (a^{-1} b^{-1} )? Wait, perhaps a better approach. Let me see:

Starting from abab = a a b b.

Let me factor a from the left: a^{-1} abab = a^{-1} a a b b.

Which is b a b = a b b.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as a^{-1}abab = a^{-1} a a b b.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of group presentations. Let me see if I can manipulate the equation.

So abab = aabb.

Let me try to factor out a from the left and b from the right.

Wait, abab = a a b b. Let me write this as (a) (b a b) = a (b b). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can divide both sides by a on the left and b on the right. So:

Left side: a^{-1} abab = b a b.

Right side: a^{-1} a a b b = b b.

So, we have b a b = b b.

Similarly, multiplying both sides on the left by b^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}, we get a b = e, where e is the identity. But that would require b = a^{-1}, which is not necessarily the case. Hmm, that might not hold in a non-abelian group.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

Start with abab = aabb.

Divide both sides by a on the left and by b on the right.

Left side: (abab) / a / b = (a b a b) / a / b = (b a b) / b = a b.

Right side: (a a b b) / a / b = (a a b b) / a / b = (a b b) / b = a.

So, a b = a. Multiply both sides on the right by b^{-1}: a b b^{-1} = a b^{-1}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If a b = a, then multiplying both sides on the right by b^{-1} gives a b b^{-1} = a b^{-1}.

But a b b^{-1} is a (b b^{-1}) = a e = a.

On the other side, a b^{-1} is... So, a = a b^{-1}.

If a ≠ e, then multiplying both sides on the right by b gives a = a b^{-1} b = a e = a, which is trivially true. But wait, this seems to suggest that a b^{-1} = e, so b^{-1} = a^{-1}, so b = a.

But that's only possible if a and b are inverses of each other. But this is for all a and b in G, so that would mean G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. So this suggests that the equation (ab)^2 =a^2 b^2 implies that for all a, b, a b = b a, hence G is abelian.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me re-examine that step. Because when I divided both sides by a on the left and by b on the right, I might have made an error.

Let me try again:

Starting from abab = a a b b.

I want to factor out a and b, but perhaps it's easier to consider the equation as (ab)^2 = (a b)^2, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps think of (ab)^2 as a^2 b^2, which can be written as a^2 b^2 = (ab)^2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps let's consider the commutator. Let's compute [a, b] = a^{-1} b^{-1} a b. If G is abelian, then [a, b] = e.

But from the equation, (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2. Let's compute this in terms of the commutator.

(ab)^2 = abab. Which can be written as a (b a b) b, but perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Let me try to compute (ab)^2 and a^2 b^2 and see when they are equal.

(ab)^2 = abab.

a^2 b^2 = aabb.

So, abab = aabb.

Let me rearrange this as abab a^{-1} b^{-1} = aabb a^{-1} b^{-1}.

Simplify both sides:

Left: a (b a b) a^{-1} b^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute this step by step. abab a^{-1} b^{-1} = a (b a b) a^{-1} b^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as a b a b a^{-1} b^{-1}.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can cancel terms. Let me write the equation as abab = aabb.

Let me multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by b^{-1}.

Left side: a^{-1} abab b^{-1} = (a^{-1} a) (b a b b^{-1}) )= e (b a e) = b a.

Right side: a^{-1} a a b b b^{-1} = (a^{-1} a a) (b (b b^{-1})) )= a (b e) = a b.

So now, we have b a = a b. So this shows that for the equation (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 to hold for all a, b in G, it must be that all elements commute, i.e., G is abelian.

Wait, that's a strong conclusion. So if (ab)^2 = a^2 b^2 for all a, b, then G is abelian.

So, looking at the options, option A is 'abelian' which would be the answer. 

Wait, the question is asking which of the options is necessarily true. So the correct answer is A: abelian.
</think>

The problem states that in a group \( G \), the equation \( (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 \) holds for all \( a, b \in G \). The goal is to determine which of the given options necessarily holds for \( G \).

First, we expand both sides of the equation:
\[
(ab)^2 = abab
\]
\[
a^2b^2 = aabb
\]
The equation becomes:
\[
abab = aabb
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
abab a^{-1} b^{-1} = aabb a^{-1} b^{-1}
\]
Simplifying both sides:
\[
b a = a b
\]
This shows that for the equation to hold for all \( a, b \in G \), \( G \) must be abelian. Therefore, the group \( G \) is necessarily abelian.

The correct answer is **A: abelian**.
