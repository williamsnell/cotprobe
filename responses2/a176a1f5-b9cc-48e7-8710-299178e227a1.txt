Okay, so I've got this question about the z-transform. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question says to find the z-transform of f[n] which is 3δ[n+2] + 4δ[n-1] + 2δ[n-3]. I remember that the z-transform of a delta function δ[n-k] is z^k, but wait, wait. No, wait, the z-transform of δ[n - k] is z^{-k}. Or is it z^{k}? I need to get this right.

Wait, the definition is F(z) = sum from n=-infty to +infty of f[n] z^{-n}. So each δ[n - a] would contribute to f[a], right? Because δ[n-a] is zero except when n=a. So for each term in f[n], f[n] = 3δ[n+2] + 4δ[n-1] + 2δ[n-3], that means f[ -2 ] is 3, f[1] is 4, and f[3] is 2. So the z-transform would be the sum of these multiplied by z^{-n}.

Wait, wait, each term in f[n] is a delta function. So each delta at a certain n contributes to the sum. So for f[n] = 3δ[n+2], when n= -2, δ evaluates to 1, so 3*1. Similarly, 4δ[n-1] is 4*1 when n=1. And 2δ[n-3] is 2*1 when n=3.

So the z-transform F(z) is sum of (3*z^{-(-2)}) + (4*z^{-1}) + (2*z^{-3}).

Wait, wait, no: z^{-n} for each term. Let's see. For 3δ[n+2], the exponent is -n, so n is -2. So z^{-(-2)}? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's take each term:

3δ[n+2] is 3δ(n - (-2)). So the term is 3*z^{n + 2} evaluated at n=-2? Wait, no, the z-transform is sum f[n] z^{-n}. So for each term, f[n] is 3 when n=-2, 4 when n=1, 2 when n=3.

So F(z) = 3 z^{-(-2)} + 4 z^{-1} + 2 z^{-3}.

Wait, z^{-n} when n is -2 is z^{2}, right? Because z^{-n} = z^{2} when n is -2. So 3*z^{2}.

Similarly, 4*z^{-1} is 4*z^{-1}, and 2*z^{-3} is 2*z^{-3}.

So putting it together, F(z) = 3z² +4z^{-1} +2z^{-3}.

Wait, let me double-check the exponents. Oh wait, no! Because for each term, you take z^-n. So for f[n] =3 δ[n+2], that's 3 δ(n = -2). So the term is 3 * z^{-n}, where n is the index for that delta function.

Wait, no, more accurately, each term is 3 δ[n+2] equals 3 δ(n= -2). So, when you compute the z-transform, each term is 3 multiplied by z^{-n}, but n is the index. So if n is -2, that term becomes 3 z^{2}. Because z^{-n} = z^{2} when n is -2.

Similarly, 4 δ[n-1] becomes 4 z^{-1} (since n is 1, so -n is -1), and 2 δ[n-3] becomes 2 z^{-3}.

So F(z) = 3z² +4z^{-1} +2z^{-3}.

Looking at the options, option B is 3z² +4z^{-1} +2z^{-3}, which matches what I have. Wait, but wait the options are labeled from A to J. Let me check the options again.

Option B says 3z² +4z^{-1} +2z^{-3}, which matches my result. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me read all options again.

Option B: 3z² +4z^{-1} +2z^{-3} → yes, that's what I got.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think, the z-transform of δ(n - k) is z^{-k} multiplied by the value of f at n=k. So f[n] is 3 at n=-2, 4 at n=1, 2 at n=3. So F(z) = 3*z^{2} (since z^{-(-2)} is z^2) +4*z^{-1} +2*z^{-3}.

Wait, that's exactly what I got. So the answer is option B.

To find the z-transform of \( f[n] = 3\delta[n+2] + 4\delta[n-1] + 2\delta[n-3] \), we use the definition of the bilateral z-transform:

\[
F(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f[n] z^{-n}.
\]

Each term in \( f[n] \) is a delta function shifted by a certain index. For \( f[n] = 3\delta[n+2] \), the value is 3 at \( n = -2 \). For \( f[n] = 4\delta[n-1] \), the value is 4 at \( n = 1 \). For \( f[n] = 2\delta[n-3] \), the value is 2 at \( n = 3 \). Substituting these values into the z-transform definition:

\[
F(z) = 3z^{-(-2)} + 4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}.
\]

Simplifying, \( z^{-(-2)} = z^2 \), so:

\[
F(z) = 3z^2 + 4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is **Option B**.
