Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me read it again. The box has 7 red balls, 5 white, and 4 black. The question is asking for the probability of drawing one red ball and then one black ball, but wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. Oh no, wait! Wait, the question says, "What is the probability of your drawing at random one red ball? One black ball?" Oh, wait, maybe it's two separate questions: what's the probability of drawing a red ball and then a black ball? Or maybe it's two questions asking for each? Let me look again.

Wait, the question is phrased as "What is the probability of your drawing at random one red ball? One black ball?" Hmm, maybe it's a single event of drawing one red and one black, but I think I should re-read it more carefully.

Wait, the initial statement says: "What is the probability of your drawing at random one red ball? One black ball?" Oh, perhaps it's two separate probabilities: the chance of drawing a red ball and the chance of drawing a black ball. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if you draw one ball, it can't be both red and black. So maybe it's asking, what's the probability of drawing a red first and then a black? Or is it two separate questions for each color? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's look at the options. The options are P(R) and P(B) for red and black. So perhaps it's asking for the individual probabilities of drawing a red versus a black ball. But wait, that doesn't make sense because each draw is without replacement. Wait, no, wait, perhaps the question is about the probability of drawing one red and one black in a single draw, but that would require two draws. Or perhaps it's the probability of drawing one red and then one black in two separate draws, but the question says "at random" once. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "What is the probability of your drawing at random one red ball? One black ball?" That phrasing is a bit ambiguous. But looking at the options, perhaps the question is asking for two separate probabilities: P(R) and P(B), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the probability of drawing a red followed by a black, but that's two events. Wait, but if you draw two balls, the probabilities would be different.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the probability of drawing one red and one black in any order, meaning either red first then black, or black first then red. But looking at the options, perhaps each option gives the probability for red and black. Let me think.

The total number of balls is 7 red +5 white +4 black = 16 balls.

So, the probability of drawing a red ball on the first try is 7/16. If that's the first question, then the second is 4/15 for the next.

Wait, but the question says "What is the probability of your drawing at random one red ball? One black ball?" Maybe it's two separate questions, each asking for the probability of one color. But that would be two probabilities, but the options list four possible answers, each giving both P(R) and P(B). So perhaps each option is a pair of P(R) and P(B).

Wait, the options are A to H, each with P(R) and P(B). So for example, option A says P(R)=2/3, P(B)=1/3. So if the question is asking for both probabilities, then each option is an option to choose.

Wait, but the question says "What is the probability of your drawing at random one red ball? One black ball?" which sounds like two separate probabilities. But wait, that doesn't make sense, because you can't draw both a red and a black ball in one draw. So perhaps the question is about the probability of drawing a red and then a black, but in sequence, meaning two draws.

Wait, but the way it's phrased, "at random one red ball? One black ball?" Maybe it's just two separate questions. So perhaps the question is asking for the probability of drawing a red ball and the probability of drawing a black ball. But that would be two separate probabilities.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a single question, so perhaps it's about the probability of drawing a red or black ball in a single draw. But that would be the sum of the probabilities, which for red and black is 7+4=11/16, but none of the options sum to 11/16.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability of drawing a red or black ball, but that's not what it says. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually two separate questions: what is the probability of drawing a red ball, and what is the probability of drawing a black ball. That makes sense. So the question is asking for P(R) and P(B) in sequence.

So the first part (P(R)) is 7/16, and the second (P(B)) is 4/15, because after drawing a red ball, there are 15 left (since one is removed), and 4 are black. So let me compute that.

Let's compute the probabilities step by step.

Total balls =16.

P(R) is 7/16.

After drawing a red, the total becomes 15, with 4 black and 6 white.

So P(B) given R is 4/15.

But the question is asking for the probabilities, so perhaps the options are giving P(R) and P(B) in each scenario.

But looking at the options, for example, option A says P(R)=2/3 and P(B)=1/3. Wait, but 2/3 is about 0.666... So that would be only possible if the probability of red is 2/3, but that's more than 7/16. Let me calculate:

7/16 is approximately 0.4375.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2/3 is about 0.666, which is higher than 7/16.

Option B: 5/14 is about 0.357.

Option C: 1/2 is 0.5.

Option D: 7/15 is approximately 0.4667.

Option E: 7/16 is 0.4375.

Option F:5/16=0.3125.

Option G:1/3≈0.333.

Option H:1/4=0.25.

Option I:7/16=0.4375.

Wait, so option I says P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=1/2. But wait, if you draw a red, there are 15 balls left, 4 black, so 4/15 for black. But option I says P(B)=1/2, which is 0.5, which is higher than 4/15 (which is 0.2667). So that's not matching.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each option:

Option A: P(R)=2/3 (≈0.6667), P(B)=1/3 (≈0.3333)

Option B:5/14≈0.357, 4/14=2/7≈0.2857.

Option C:1/2=0.5, 1/4=0.25.

Option D:7/15≈0.4667, 4/15≈0.2667.

Option E:7/16≈0.4375, 1/4=0.25.

Option F:5/16=0.3125, 1/4=0.25.

Option G:1/3≈0.3333, 1/4=0.25.

Option H:1/4=0.25, 1/5=0.2.

Option I:7/16≈0.4375, 1/2=0.5.

So, the correct probabilities for P(R) and P(B) would be 7/16 and 4/15, respectively. Let's see which option has these.

Looking at the options, option I has P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=1/2. But 1/2 is larger than 4/15, which is about 0.2667. So option I's P(B) is incorrect.

Option E has P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=1/4. Which is correct for P(B) only if you draw a black, but that's not the case if you have a red drawn first. So option E's P(B) is wrong because it's 1/4, but the correct P(B) would be 4/15 if you're drawing without replacement.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of drawing one red and one black. So if you draw two balls, the probability would be P(R)*P(B|R) + P(B)*P(R|B). But that's more complicated.

Wait, maybe the question is only asking for the individual probabilities, not considering the order. So P(R) is 7/16, and P(B) is 4/16 (since there are 4 black balls out of 16). But that's 1/4. So in that case, the probability of drawing a black ball is 1/4, but the options have that in some cases. Let's see.

Wait, but if you're drawing one red and one black, then the probability is 2 possibilities: red first then black, or black first then red.

So the correct approach is:

If you draw two balls without replacement, the probability of getting one red and one black is:

P(R then B) = (7/16) * (4/15) = (7*4)/(16*15) = 28/240 = 7/60.

P(B then R) = (4/16) * (7/15) = same as above, 7/60.

So total probability is 7/60 + 7/60 = 14/60 = 7/30 ≈ 0.2333.

But that's not directly related to the options. The options are about P(R) and P(B) for each. So perhaps the question is about the individual probabilities of each color, which is 7/16 for red, and 4/16 = 1/4 for black.

Wait, but 4/16 is 1/4, which is 0.25. But looking at the options, option E has P(B)=1/4, which is 0.25. So option E says P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=1/4, which would be correct if you're drawing a single red or a single black. But wait, the question is about drawing one red and one black. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about drawing two balls and one is red and the other is black. Then the probability of that happening in any order is 7/16 *4/15 +4/16 *7/15 = 2*(7*4)/(16*15) )= 56/(240) =7/30, which is approximately 0.2333.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is just asking for the individual probabilities, not considering the order, meaning P(R) is 7/16 and P(B) is 4/16=1/4. Looking at the options, option E has P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=1/4. So that's what I'm thinking.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says, "What is the probability of your drawing at random one red ball? One black ball?" Maybe it's a two-step question, but perhaps it's about the probability of drawing one red and one black. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for P(R) and P(B), but each as individual probabilities.

Wait, but in that case, the first part would be 7/16, and the second is 4/16=1/4. So that's option E: P(R)=7/16, P(B)=1/4.

But wait, no. Because if you're drawing one red and one black, then the two events are dependent. The P(B) would be conditional on the first draw being red. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability of drawing one red and one black in two draws without replacement. But the way it's phrased doesn't indicate that.

Wait, another approach: let's look at each option and see if any of them have P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=4/16, which is 1/4. Looking back, option E says P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=1/4. So if the question is about the individual probabilities, then E would be correct.

Alternatively, if the question is about the individual probabilities regardless of order, perhaps the answer is P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=4/16=1/4.

Wait, but according to the options, option E has P(R)=7/16, which is correct, and P(B)=1/4, which is correct for 4 black balls out of 16.

So I think the correct answer is option E.
</think>

The question asks for the probabilities of drawing a red and a black ball from a box containing 7 red, 5 white, and 4 black balls, totaling 16 balls. The options provide individual probabilities for red and black, which are:

- **Option A**: P(R) = 2/3, P(B) = 1/3
- **Option B**: P(R) = 5/14, P(B) = 4/14
- **Option C**: P(R) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/4
- **Option D**: P(R) = 7/15, P(B) = 4/15
- **Option E**: P(R) = 7/16, P(B) = 1/4
- **Option F**: P(R) = 5/16, P(B) = 1/4
- **Option G**: P(R) = 1/3, P(B) = 1/4
- **Option H**: P(R) = 1/4, P(B) = 1/5
- **Option I**: P(R) = 7/16, P(B) = 1/2

The correct probability for drawing a red ball is 7/16 (since there are 7 red balls out of 16 total). The correct probability for drawing a black ball is 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4. Among the options, **Option E** provides P(R)=7/16 and P(B)=1/4, matching the probabilities for red and black balls, respectively.
