Question:

Newton's law of cooling states that the temperature of an object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between its temperature and that of its surroundings. Suppose that the temperature of a cup of coffee obeys Newton's law of cooling. If the coffee has a temperature of $200^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ when freshly poured, and $1 \mathrm{~min}$ later has cooled to $190^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ in a room at $70^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, determine when the coffee reaches a temperature of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Options:

A: 10.2 min
B: 7.8 min
C: 12.0 min
D: 9.5 min
E: 2.8 min
F: 4.5 min
G: 5.2 min
H: 8.4 min
I: 3.3 min
J:  6.07 min

Okay, so I've got this problem about Newton's law of cooling. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember Newton's law says that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and its surroundings. So the formula is something like dT/dt = -k(T - T_s), where T is the temperature of the object at time t, T_s is the surrounding temperature, and k is a positive constant.

The problem says the coffee starts at 200°F, and after 1 minute, it's at 190°F in a room that's 70°F. I need to find when it reaches 150°F.

Wait, Newton's law equation can be integrated to find the temperature as a function of time. Let me recall the solution. The differential equation dT/dt = -k(T - T_s) can be solved using separation of variables. The solution is T(t) = T_s + (T0 - T_s) * e^(-kt), where T0 is the initial temperature.

Right, so plugging in the given values: T_s is 70°F. T0 is 200°F. After t=1 minute, T(t)=190°F.

So the equation becomes 190 = 70 + (200 -70) * e^(-k*1). Let's compute that. 200-70 is 130. So 190 =70 + 130 e^{-k}.

Subtract 70 from both sides: 120 = 130 e^{-k}. So e^{-k} = 120/130 = 12/13. Taking natural logs, -k = ln(12/13). So k = -ln(12/13) or ln(13/12).

Wait, let me compute that. Let me calculate ln(13/12) to find k. Since 13/12 is approximately 1.0833, ln(1.0833) is about 0.0801. So k is approximately 0.0801 per minute.

Now, the question is when T(t) =150°F. Using the same formula: 150 =70 + (200-70) e^{-kt}.

Wait, 200-70 is 130 again. So 150 =70 +130 e^{-kt}. Subtract 70: 80 =130 e^{-kt}. So e^{-kt} =80/130 = 8/13 ≈ 0.6154.

Taking natural log: -kt = ln(8/13) → t = - (ln(8/13))/k.

We know k is ln(13/12) ≈ 0.0801.

So t = -(ln(8/13)) / (ln(13/12)).

Compute ln(8/13): 8/13 is about 0.6154. ln(0.6154) is approximately -0.4812. So the numerator is -(-0.4812) = 0.4812.

Denominator is ln(13/12)=0.0801.

So t ≈ 0.4812 / 0.0801 ≈ 6.008 minutes. Approximately 6 minutes.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.07 min, which is about 6.07, which is very close to our calculation. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine when the coffee reaches \(150^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\), we use Newton's law of cooling. The temperature of the coffee as a function of time is given by:

\[
T(t) = T_s + (T_0 - T_s) e^{-kt}
\]

Where:
- \(T_s = 70^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\) (surrounding temperature),
- \(T_0 = 200^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\) (initial temperature),
- \(k\) is the cooling constant,
- \(t\) is time in minutes.

### Step 1: Find \(k\)
Given that after 1 minute (\(t=1\)), the temperature \(T(1) = 190^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\), plug into the equation:

\[
190 = 70 + (200 - 70) e^{-k \cdot 1}
\]

Simplify:

\[
120 = 130 e^{-k}
\]

\[
e^{-k} = \frac{120}{130} = \frac{12}{13}
\]

Take the natural logarithm:

\[
-k = \ln\left(\frac{12}{13}\right) \implies k = -\ln\left(\frac{12}{13}\right) \approx 0.0801 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Find \(t\) when \(T(t) = 150^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\)
Set \(T(t) = 150^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\):

\[
150 = 70 + 130 e^{-kt}
\]

Subtract 70:

\[
80 = 130 e^{-kt}
\]

\[
e^{-kt} = \frac{80}{130} = \frac{8}{13}
\]

Take the natural logarithm:

\[
-kt = \ln\left(\frac{8}{13}\right) \implies t = -\frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{13}\right)}{k}
\]

Substitute \(k \approx 0.0801\):

\[
t \approx -\frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{13}\right)}{0.0801} \approx \frac{0.4812}{0.0801} \approx 6.008 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
The coffee reaches \(150^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\) at approximately \(6.07 \, \text{minutes}\).
