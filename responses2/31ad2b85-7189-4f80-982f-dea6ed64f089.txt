Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about ethnic identity. Let's see, the question is asking what ethnic identity refers to. The options are A to J, each with a different definition.

First, I'll try to recall what ethnic identity means. From what I remember, ethnic identity is about how people identify with their own ethnic group and the cultural practices they have. So it's more than just being a member of a particular ethnic group; it's about the cultural aspects and traditions they're comfortable with.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a rejection of social, cultural, and institutional standards. Wait, that seems a bit off. If it's a rejection, maybe they don't fit into those groups. But ethnic identity is more about acceptance, not rejection.

Option B is about rejecting all cultural traditions. That doesn't sound right. Identity is about being accepted, not rejecting.

Option C: the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group. That makes sense. It's about being part of and practicing the traditions of a group.

Option D: cultural practices and beliefs are non-Western. No, ethnic identity isn't about being Western; it's about cultural practices, not necessarily Western.

Option E: adherence to only Western traditions. That's not correct because ethnic identity includes non-Western practices too.

Option F: rejects their ethnocultural practices. Wait, this is the opposite of what ethnic identity is. Identity isn't about rejecting; it's about being accepted.

Option G: multiple ethnic identities. That's more about the diversity of ethnic groups rather than identity itself.

Option H: practices the majority group's traditions. That's a possibility, but ethnic identity is broader than just one group.

Option I: collective practices of the dominant group. No, ethnic identity is more about personal traditions, not just the dominant group's.

Option J: practices the dominant group's traditions. Again, similar to H, which isn't the best fit.

So, the best option is C. It correctly describes the extent to which one endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a group. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C. 

**Answer:** C: the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group.
