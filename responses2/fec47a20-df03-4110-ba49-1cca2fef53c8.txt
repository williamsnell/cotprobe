Okay, so I have this law question about contracts and offers. Let's see what it's about. The question is about Calvin Poultry Co. offering to sell chicken and how Chickenshop responds. I'm a bit rusty on contract law, but I'll try to think it through.

So, Calvin offers 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound under some delivery terms. The delivery is specified, meaning those terms are clear. The chicken is accepted by Calvin as follows: "We accept your offer for 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound per city scale weight certificate." Hmm, wait, the wording here is a bit confusing. The offer was for 40 cents per pound, and the acceptance is phrased as 40 cents per pound per city scale weight certificate. 

Wait, I think I might have misunderstood the terms. Let me break it down. The original offer is for a total of 20,000 pounds at 40 cents each. The acceptance is phrased as 40 cents per pound per city scale weight certificate. So, the city scale weight certificate might be a way to specify the weight, like how much weight per certificate. But that doesn't change the terms of the contract. Because the total is 20,000 pounds at 40c each, regardless of how it's delivered.

In contract law, when one party accepts another's offer, it's considered acceptance if they are both legally binding and mutually agreed to. So, in this case, Calvin's offer was for 20k lbs at 40c each. The acceptance is that same terms. So the chicken is accepted, and the contract is formed. 

Wait, but what about the delivery terms? If the original terms were for a specified delivery (like a certain weight or quantity), then the acceptance would have to include those terms. But in the question, the acceptance is phrased as offering per city scale weight certificate. I'm not sure if that's a change in terms. Because the city scale weight certificate is just another way to specify the weight, not the price. So the price per pound remains 40c.

So, the chicken is accepted, and the contract is formed. Let me look at the options:

Option A: No contract. But I thought acceptance means a contract is formed. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Contract formed, but terms need clarification. Wait, but the offer and acceptance are the same. Unless the terms were unclear otherwise. But if the terms are the same as what's accepted, then maybe no need for clarification. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Rejection. No, because acceptance is when a buyer takes. So C is wrong.

Option D: Chickenshop's terms are subject to change. Oh, but the chicken is accepted, so the terms are clear. Unless the chicken was rejected and then accepted later. But in this case, it's accepted, so no change. D is not correct.

Option E: Conditional acceptance. Conditional means the acceptance depends on something else. But no, since the chicken is accepted, it's an acceptance, not conditional. So E is wrong.

Option F: Contract isn't legally binding. But acceptance is a key step in forming a contract. So legally binding. So F is wrong.

Option G: Contract formed on Chickenshop's terms. Yes, because the chicken was accepted, which is the main point of a contract.

Option H: Breach of contract. No, because the chicken was accepted, so there's no breach.

Option I: Terms are negotiable. Negotiable terms mean they can be changed or modified. But since the chicken was accepted as per the terms, it's not negotiable. So I is incorrect.

So the correct answer is G: a contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms.

The correct answer is G: A contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms.

**Explanation:**
When Calvin Poultry Co. offers to sell 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound, and Chickenshop accepts this offer by specifying the price per pound as 40 cents per pound per city scale weight certificate, the terms are clearly agreed upon. The acceptance constitutes the formation of a contract, and since the chicken is accepted, no breach occurs. The terms are legally binding and formed on Chickenshop's terms. 

**Answer:** G: A contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms.
