Okay, so I've got this problem about a copper sphere and a cube being heated and then cooled. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says both are heated to 1250°F. They're then exposed to air at 210°F. The surface film coefficient is given as 12 Btu/hr.ft²°F. I remember that the surface film coefficient (also called the convection coefficient) relates the heat transfer to the temperature difference between the surface and the surroundings.

The question asks for the temperatures after 10 minutes. So, I think I need to calculate the rate of cooling for each object and then see how much the temperature drops over that time period.

Wait, but wait—since they're both starting at the same temperature and being exposed to the same conditions, perhaps they will reach thermal equilibrium? But wait, I'm not sure if they can reach the same equilibrium temperature. Oh, wait, no, because the cube is a solid cube, and the sphere is a sphere. Their shapes might cause their cooling rates to be different. So they won't reach the same equilibrium.

Hmm, but the question is about the final temperatures, not the equilibrium. So I need to find each object's temperature after 10 minutes of cooling.

I think the cooling follows Newton's law of cooling, which is Q = h * A * (T_initial - T_surrounding) * t. But wait, actually, the equation is dT/dt = -h A (T - T_surrounding). Oh, right, the rate of change of temperature is proportional to the temperature difference.

But since this is a steady state after a certain time, maybe the temperature will approach the ambient temperature plus some more calculation. Wait, no, because Newton's law applies as a differential equation, but after time t, the temperature approaches ambient temperature if the initial change is small, but in this case, if the initial temperatures are much higher than surroundings, they might cool a bit.

Wait, but wait—no, because the initial temperature is much higher than the surroundings, so they will cool down, but how much?

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a cooling problem. Newton's law is dT/dt = -h A (T - T_surr). The solution to this is T(t) = T_surr + (T0 - T_surr) * e^(-ht/(m c)), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some formulas. Alternatively, the solution is T(t) = T_surr + (T0 - Tsurrounding) * e^(- (h A t)/ (ρ V c_p)) ), but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the temperature of an object cooling under convection can be modeled using the formula for steady-state heat transfer. Wait, but if the object is at a higher temperature than the surroundings, it will cool until it reaches the surroundings' temperature, assuming no other heat sources. So, the final temperature would be the ambient temperature (210°F) plus any change caused by the time. Wait, no, because the cube is solid and the sphere is a sphere. So perhaps each shape will have a different cooling rate, so their final temperatures will depend on their respective cooling capacities.

Wait, but in the question, the heating is to 1250°F and then cooling is exposed to 210°F. So the cooling occurs, and each object will lose heat. So, the problem is to find the temperature each object attains after 10 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that each object reaches thermal equilibrium with the surrounding air, but that can't be because if they are at different initial temperatures, but in this case, the problem says they are heated to 1250, then exposed to 210.

Wait, but the question is about their temperatures after 10 minutes. Hmm, but when you have a solid cube and a sphere, their cooling rates are different because of their geometric properties. So, perhaps the cube will cool faster than the sphere, so the sphere's temperature will be higher than the cube's.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The cooling rate (dT/dt) is given by h A (T - Tsurrounding). So the larger the surface area, the faster the cooling. So the cube has a surface area of 6*(2in)^2 = 24 in². The sphere has a surface area of 4πr². Radius is 1.5 inches? Wait, the radius is 1.5 inches? Wait, the problem says a 2-inch radius sphere. So surface area = 4 * pi * (1.5)^2 = 4 * pi * 2.25 = 9 pi ≈ 28.274 in².

So the cube's surface area is 24 in², sphere is ~28.274. So the sphere has a larger surface area, so it should cool faster than the cube.

So, the cube will cool more quickly, so its temperature will drop more than the sphere's.

So, the initial temperature for both is 1250°F, and after 10 minutes, each will cool to the surrounding temperature, 210°F. Wait, but that seems too quick. Wait, maybe not, because Newton's law is an approximation, but perhaps the time is sufficient for them to reach that.

Wait, but that can't be because if they're both cooled to the same ambient temp, but their cooling rates are different, their final temperatures are both 210°F. But that's not possible because the sphere has a larger surface area, so it would lose more heat. Wait, but Newton's law says that the final temperature approaches the ambient, no matter the shape. So both would reach 210°F. But the question is about the temperatures after 10 minutes.

Wait, but that's not correct because if both are exposed to the same environment, but one is a cube and the other is a sphere, their cooling rates are different. So, the one with higher surface area (the sphere) would cool faster, so after 10 minutes, its temperature would be lower than the cube's.

Wait, but the problem says after a period of 10 minutes. So maybe the temperatures are not yet at ambient temperature. So we need to calculate how much they cool after 10 minutes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the cooling is happening, and we need to calculate each object's temperature after 10 minutes, assuming no further heat transfer except via convection.

So the formula for temperature after time t is:

T(t) = Tsurr + (T_initial - Tsurr) * e^(- (h A t)/(ρ V c_p)) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the exponential cooling formula.

Wait, Newton's law is dT/dt = -h A (T - T_surr). The solution to this is T(t) = T_surr + (T_initial - Tsurr) * e^(-h A t / (ρ V c_p)) )

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is T(t) = Tsurr + (T_initial - Tsurr) e^(- (h A t)/(m c)), where m is mass and c is specific heat.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula: T(t) = Tsurr + (T_initial - Tsurr) * exp(- (h A t)/(ρ V c_p) )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the formula for the cooling time constant τ is τ = (ρ V c_p)/(h A), so the temperature at time t would be:

T(t) = Tsurr + (T_initial - Tsurr) * exp( - t / τ )

So let's compute τ for each object. If I can find τ, then I can compute T(t) for t=10 min.

But I don't have the materials data, like density, specific heat, etc. Wait, the problem says it's copper. So I can use copper's properties.

Copper has a density (ρ) of about 0.000896 g/cm³, but wait, more accurately, I think it's around 8960 kg/m³. Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me get that right. Copper's density is approximately 8960 kg/m³, which is 8.96 g/cm³. Wait, no, because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 8.96 g/cm³ is 8960 kg/m³.

Wait, correct: 8960 kg/m³.

Specific heat (c) is 385 J/kg·K. Wait, but more accurately, I think it's 385 J/kg·K.

Molar mass of copper is about 63.55 g/mol. So, molar mass in kg/mol is 0.06355 kg/mol.

Wait, let me compute the volume of the sphere and the cube to find mass.

Wait, the cube has side length 2 inches. The sphere has radius 1 inch. So, their volumes are:

Cube: (2)^3 = 8 in³.

Sphere: (4/3) π (1)^3 = (4/3) π ≈ 4.1888 in³.

But I need the density in kg/m³. Wait, wait, perhaps I should convert inches to meters. Because I'm using metric units in the formula.

Wait, the densities I should use: for copper, 8960 kg/m³.

So for the cube:

Volume = 8 in³. Now, to convert in³ to m³. 1 inch = 0.0254 meters. So,

1 in³ = (0.0254 m)^3 ≈ 1.6387 x 10^-5 m³.

So, 8 in³ = 8 * 1.6387e-5 m³ ≈ 1.31096e-4 m³.

Mass of cube: density * volume = 8960 kg/m³ * 1.31096e-4 m³ ≈ 1.177 kg.

Wait, let me compute that: 8960 * 1.31096e-4 = 8960 * 0.000131096 = Let's compute 8960 * 0.000131096.

0.000131096 is approximately 1.31096e-4. So,

8960 * 1.31096e-4 = 8960 * 1.31096 * 1e-4 ≈ 8960 * 0.000131096 = 

Let me compute 8960 * 0.000131096.

= 8960 * 0.0001 * 131.096 ≈ 0.896 * 131.096 ≈ 117.7 kg.

Wait, maybe exact calculation: 8960 * 1.31096e-4 = 8960 * 1.31096 / 10000.

Compute 8960 * 1.31096:

8960 * 1 = 8960.

8960 * 0.3 = 2688.

8960 * 0.01096 = let's compute 8960 * 0.01 = 89.6; 8960 * 0.00096= 8.5696.

So, 89.6 + 8.5696 = 98.1696.

So total 8960 + 2688 = 11648, +98.1696= 11746.1696. So 11746.1696 / 1e4 = 1.1746 kg.

So cube's mass is approx 1.175 kg.

Cube's surface area is 6*(2in)^2=24 in².

Sphere's radius is 1 inch, so surface area is 4πr² = 4 * π * (1)^2 = 4π ≈ 12.566 in².

Wait, 4 * π is approximately 12.566 in².

So, for the cube: h=12 Btu/hr.ft²°F. So h is 12 Btu/(h * ft² * °F).

Wait, but wait, the cube's surface area is in square inches, and h is given in Btu/(h.ft².°F). So I need to convert to ft².

1 foot = 12 inches. So 1 in² = (1/12 ft)^2 = 1/144 ft².

So, cube's surface area is 24 in² = 24 * (1/144) ft² = 24/144 = 1/6 ft² ≈ 0.1667 ft².

Sphere's surface area is 12.566 in² = (12.566 / 144) ft² ≈ 0.0868 ft².

Wait, but wait, the cube's surface area is 24 in². So 24 / (144) = 0.1667 ft².

So, for the cube:

t=10 minutes. So 10 *60=600 seconds.

Wait, but the formula for T(t) uses time in hours, I think. Because the units of h are in Btu/(h.ft².°F). Because the problem says the surface film coefficient is 12 Btu/hr.ft²°F. So h=12 Btu/(h.ft²°F).

Hmm, perhaps I should convert the time into hours. So 10 minutes is 10/60 = 1/6 hours.

So, for the cube:

τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A).

Wait, but I don't know the mass (rho V) or specific heat (c_p) for copper.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. Alternatively, perhaps using an approximate formula.

Wait, Newton's law for cooling: dT/dt = -h A (T - Tsurr). The solution is T(t) = Tsurr + (T_initial - Tsurr) * e^(-t/τ), where τ is the time constant, which is (ρ V c_p)/(h A).

But I don't have the values for ρ, V, c_p.

Wait, but perhaps I can use approximate values. Let me think about the standard cooling time constant for a copper sphere.

Wait, for example, I recall that for a sphere, the time constant τ is around 2 minutes for a copper sphere. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute τ using the formula.

Wait, let's compute the denominator of τ: h*A.

h is 12 Btu/(h.ft²°F). A is the surface area in ft².

Cube's A is 0.1667 ft².

So, h*A = 12 * 0.1667 ≈ 2 Btu/(h ft² F). Hmm, wait, units? Btu/(h.ft²°F) is (Btu/(h)) / (ft² F). So h*A has units of Btu/(h ft² F) * ft² = Btu/(h F). So the denominator is 2 Btu/(h F).

The numerator is (ρ V c_p). Let's find ρ (density), V (volume), c_p (specific heat).

For copper, density ρ is approximately 0.000896 g/cm³ = 8960 kg/m³.

Wait, let me express all in SI units to compute the numerator.

Volume V = 1.175 kg / 8960 kg/m³ = 1.175 / 8960 = approximately 0.000131 m³.

Specific heat c_p for copper is about 385 J/kg·K (since 1 Btu = 1055 J, and 1 K ≈ 1.8 F, but perhaps it's easier to convert units correctly).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerator (ρ V c_p) in J/(kg·K) ?

Wait, let me do that.

ρ = 8960 kg/m³.

V = 0.000131 m³.

c_p = 385 J/kg·K.

So,

ρ * V = 8960 * 0.000131 = 1.175 kg.

ρ V c_p = 1.175 kg * 385 J/kg·K = 454.375 J/K.

But the numerator of τ is (ρ V c_p) = 454.375 J/K.

The denominator is h * A (which is 2 Btu/(h F) * ft²), but wait, perhaps I should express them in compatible units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert h*A into (Btu/(h F)) * (ft²) = (Btu/(h F)) * (ft²) = (Btu/(h F)) * (1/12 ft²) ) = (Btu/(h F)) * (1/(12 ft²)) = 1/(12 h F).

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the time constant in terms of the thermal diffusivity.

Wait, thermal diffusivity α is (k)/(ρ c), where k is the thermal conductivity. But I don't have k for copper. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute α using the formula:

α = (k) / (ρ c)

But I don't have k for copper, so perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Hmm, maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the cooling time for a copper sphere.

Wait, I remember that for a sphere, the cooling time is given by τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more directly.

Wait, let's compute the numerator: (ρ V c_p) in J.

ρ = 8960 kg/m³.

V = 1.175 m³ (wait, 1.175 kg / 8960 kg/m³ = 1.175 / 8960 = 0.000131 m³).

c_p = 385 J/kg·K.

So,

ρ V c_p = 8960 * 0.000131 * 385.

Compute 8960 * 0.000131 = 1.175.

Then, 1.175 * 385 = approx 454.375 J.

So, the numerator is 454.375 J.

Denominator is h*A.

h=12 Btu/(h.ft²°F). A is in ft².

So h*A = 12 * (1/144) ft² * 0.0254 meters? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express h in W/(m²·K) and A in m².

Wait, let's convert h from Btu/(h.ft²°F) to W/(m²·K).

1 Btu = 1055.06 J.

1 foot = 0.3048 meters.

1°F = 5.5556 K.

Wait, perhaps let me compute the value.

h = 12 Btu/(h.ft²°F) = 12 * (1055.06 J) / (1 h * (0.3048 m)^2 * (5.5556 K)) )

So,

12 * 1055.06 = 12660.72 J.

Denominator: (0.3048 m)^2 * 5.5556 K = (0.092903 m²) * 5.5556 ≈ 0.516 m²·K.

So,

h = 12660.72 J / (1 h * 0.516 m²·K) ) = 12660.72 / 0.516 ≈ 24521 J/(h·m²·K).

But wait, I need to get h in units of (J/(s·m²·K)) because 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

So,

h = 24521 J/(h·m²·K) = 24521 / 3600 ≈ 6.8116 W/(m²·K).

Wait, because 1 J = 1 W·s. So, 1 W/(m²·K) corresponds to 1 J/(s·m²·K) = 1 J/(h·m²·K).

Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.

The time constant τ is (ρ V c_p)/(h A).

But ρ is kg/m³, V is m³, c_p is J/kg·K, h is W/(m²·K), A is m².

So,

τ = (kg/m³ * m³ * J/kg·K) / ( (W/(m²·K)) * m² )

Simplify numerator:

kg/m³ * m³ = kg.

kg * J/kg·K = J/K.

Denominator:

(W/(m²·K)) * m² = W/K.

So,

τ = (J/K) / (W/K) ) = J/W.

But J = W·m, so J/W = m.

So, τ has units of meters. So for copper, τ is around 1 meter.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it numerically.

Let me compute τ:

τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A).

ρ = 8960 kg/m³.

V = 1.175 m³.

c_p = 385 J/kg·K.

h = 12 Btu/(h.ft²°F) = 12 * 1055.06 / ( (0.3048)^2 * 5.5556 ) 

Wait, perhaps I should compute h in J/(m²·K).

h = 12 * 1055.06 J / ( (0.3048)^2 * 5.5556 )

Compute denominator: 0.3048^2 = 0.092903, 0.092903 *5.5556 ≈ 0.516 m²·K.

So,

h = (12 * 1055.06) / 0.516 → numerator 12 * 1055.06 ≈ 12660.72 J.

So, h ≈ 12660.72 / 0.516 ≈ 24521 J/(m²·K).

So, h ≈ 24521 J/(m²·K).

Now, compute τ:

τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A).

ρ V c_p = 8960 kg/m³ * 1.175 m³ * 385 J/kg·K.

Compute 8960 * 1.175 = 10544 kg.

10544 kg * 385 J/kg·K = 10544 * 385 J/K ≈ 4,062, 240 J/K.

Denominator: 24521 J/(m²·K) * (0.1667 m²) [since the cube's surface area is 24 in², which is 24/144 = 0.1667 m²].

So, 24521 * 0.1667 ≈ 4080 J/(m²·K).

So,

τ ≈ (4,062,240 J/K) / (4080 J/(m²·K)) ) = 4,062,240 / 4080 ≈ 996 m.

Wait, that can't be right. The time constant is about 996 meters? That doesn't make sense because the cooling time doesn't depend on the cube's size but on its geometry.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute τ again, but correctly.

Compute τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A).

Given:

ρ = 8960 kg/m³.

V = 1.175 m³.

c_p = 385 J/kg·K.

h = 24521 J/(m²·K).

A = 0.1667 m².

So,

ρ V c_p = 8960 * 1.175 * 385.

Compute 8960 * 1.175 = 10544 kg.

10544 kg * 385 J/kg·K = 10544 * 385 = let's compute 10,000 * 385 = 3.85e6, 544 * 385:

544 * 300=163,200; 544 *80=43,520; 544*5=2,720; so 163,200 +43,520=206,720 +2,720=209,440. So total 3.85e6 +209,440 = 4,059,440 J/K.

Denominator: h*A = 24521 * 0.1667 ≈ 4080 J/(m²·K).

So,

τ = 4,059,440 / 4080 ≈ 995 meters.

Hmm, that's a huge time constant. But for a copper sphere cooling, that seems a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of h.

Wait, let's re-calculate h:

h = 12 Btu/(h.ft²°F).

We need to convert this into J/(m²·K).

First, convert h from Btu/(h.ft²°F) to J/(m²·K).

1 Btu = 1055 J.

1 ft = 0.3048 m → so 1 ft² = (0.3048)^2 m² = 0.092903 m².

1°F = 5.5556 K.

So, h = 12 * (1055 J) / ( (0.3048 m)^2 * 5.5556 K ) )

Compute denominator: (0.3048)^2 = 0.092903, 0.092903 *5.5556 ≈ 0.516 m²·K.

So,

h = (12 * 1055) / 0.516 → numerator 12 *1055=12660, so 12660 / 0.516 ≈ 24521 J/(m²·K).

So, h is correct.

So, τ = 4,059,440 / 4080 ≈ 995 meters.

Wait, but 995 meters is about 3,280 feet (since 1 foot ≈ 0.3048 meters). So, the cooling time is about 3,280 feet, which is approximately 10 minutes? Wait, but 995 meters is about 3,280 feet.

Wait, 1 foot ≈ 0.3048 meters, so 1 meter ≈ 3.28 feet.

So, 995 meters ≈ 995 * 3.28 ≈ 3,280 feet.

Hmm, but 3,280 feet is about 1,049 meters. Wait, no, 3,280 feet is about 1,049 meters. Wait, no, 1 foot ≈ 0.3048 meters, so 3,280 feet ≈ 3,280 * 0.3048 ≈ 1,000 meters.

Wait, so a time constant of 995 meters would take about 10 minutes (since 995 m / (10 m/min) ) = 99.5 minutes. But in our calculation, τ was 995 meters, but we were solving for τ, which is the time constant, not the time.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The formula for T(t) is T(t) = Ts + (T0 - Ts) * e^(-t/τ).

Where τ is the time constant, given by τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A).

So, if τ is 995 meters, then the cooling time is longer than 995 meters? But wait, we have τ in terms of meters, but the temperatures are in Celsius and Fahrenheit. So, perhaps the time is in minutes, but the units are getting messed up.

Wait, perhaps the time is in minutes, but the units of τ are in meters. So, perhaps I should convert τ into minutes by dividing by the conversion factor.

Wait, 1 meter = 3.28 feet.

So, 1 meter is approximately 3.28 feet.

Wait, but 1 foot is 0.3048 meters. So, 1 meter is 1/0.3048 ≈ 3.28 feet.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute τ in terms of time, using the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute τ in seconds, then convert to minutes.

Wait, let's compute τ in seconds.

Wait, τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A).

We've computed ρ V c_p in J/K.

h in J/(m²·K).

A in m².

So,

τ = (J/K) / (J/(m²·K) ) = (J/K) * (m²·K/J) ) = m².

So, τ has units of meters squared.

Wait, but that's not consistent with the earlier calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute τ in terms of time.

Wait, perhaps I should think of τ in terms of the time it takes to cool a certain amount.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute τ in terms of the characteristic time, which is given by τ = (ρ V c_p) / (h A).

So, let me compute τ in terms of m², then convert to time.

Wait, perhaps I should compute τ in seconds.

Wait, let me compute using the values I have.

ρ = 8960 kg/m³.

V = 1.175 m³.

c_p = 385 J/kg·K.

h = 24521 J/(m²·K).

A = 0.1667 m².

So,

τ = (8960 kg/m³ * 1.175 m³ * 385 J/kg·K) / (24521 J/(m²·K) * 0.1667 m²)

Compute numerator:

8960 * 1.175 = 10544 kg.

10544 kg * 385 J/kg·K = 10544 * 385 = 4,059,440 J/K.

Denominator:

24521 J/(m²·K) * 0.1667 m² = 24521 * 0.1667 ≈ 4080 J/(m²·K * m²) ) → J/K.

So,

τ = 4,059,440 J/K / 4080 J/K = 995 m².

So, τ is 995 m².

Hmm, but what is the time constant in terms of time? Well, perhaps I should convert τ from m² to seconds.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to proceed without knowing the properties of the cube.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the time it takes to cool from 20°C to 20°C, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the cube as a whole and compute the cooling time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should instead think that the cooling time is the time it takes for the cube to cool from 20°C to 20°C, which would be zero. But that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the cube's cooling time is the time it takes to cool from 20°C to 20°C, but I'm not sure.
