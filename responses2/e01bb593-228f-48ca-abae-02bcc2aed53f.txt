D: 50%, 50%
E: 60%, 40%
F: 75%, 25%
G: 82.35%, 17.65%
H: 70%, 30%
I: 80%, 20%
J: 85%, 15%

Okay, so I've got this question about the isotopic composition of chlorine. Hmm, I remember that isotopes are variants of an element that have the same number of protons but different neutrons. Chlorine has two main isotopes: 35Cl and 37Cl. 

The question gives the average atomic mass as 35.453 amu. Wait, I think the average atomic mass is a weighted average based on the natural abundance of each isotope. So I need to calculate the percentage of each isotope in nature.

Let me recall the formula. The average atomic mass (A) is the sum of each isotope's mass multiplied by their respective fractions (abundance). So, A = (fraction of 35Cl * 35) + (fraction of 37Cl * 37). 

Let me denote the abundance of 35Cl as x (as a fraction) and 37Cl as (1 - x). So the equation becomes:

35.453 = 35x + 37(1 - x)

Expanding that: 35.453 = 35x + 37 - 37x

Combine like terms: 35.453 = 37 - 2x

Subtract 37 from both sides: 35.453 -37 = -2x → -1.547 = -2x → x = 1.547/2 → x≈0.7735 → which is 77.35%

So the abundance of 35Cl is about 77.35%, and the remaining 22.65% is 37Cl. 

Looking at the options, option C says 77.35% and 22.65%, which matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be C.

The average atomic mass of chlorine is a weighted average of its two isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl. Let the abundance of 35Cl be \( x \) and that of 37Cl be \( 1 - x \). Using the equation:

\[
35.453 = 35x + 37(1 - x)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
35.453 = 35x + 37 - 37x
\]
\[
35.453 = 37 - 2x
\]
\[
-1.547 = -2x
\]
\[
x = 0.7735 \, (\text{or } 77.35\%)
\]

Thus, the abundance of 35Cl is approximately 77.35%, and that of 37Cl is approximately 22.65%. The correct option is **C: 77.35%, 22.65%**.

Answer:
C
