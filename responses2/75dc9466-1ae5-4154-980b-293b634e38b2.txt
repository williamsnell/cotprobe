Okay, so I've got this question about Rayleigh scattering, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see.

The question is about the relationship between the wavelength of light and the amount of scattering it causes. The problem states that light with a wavelength of 635 nm causes some scattering. Then they're asking at what wavelength will the scattering be exactly 10 times as much. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that Rayleigh scattering happens when light scatters off particles that are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. And the more the light's wavelength is longer, the less it scatters. So, the scattering decreases with longer wavelengths. But wait, the question is about increasing the scattering. Or wait, the question says the amount of scattering is 10 times as much. So, if at 635 nm it's X, at some longer wavelength, it's 10X. 

Wait, but wait. Rayleigh scattering is stronger for shorter wavelengths, right? Because shorter wavelengths (like blue light) scatter more, whereas longer wavelengths (like red) scatter less. Wait, but that's when the light is in the visible spectrum. Oh right, because the sun's light and all that. So Rayleigh scattering is more prominent with shorter wavelengths.

So if a shorter wavelength like 635 nm (which is in the blue range) has some scattering, then a longer wavelength (like green or red) would have less. But the question is about a situation where the scattering is 10 times higher. That implies a different mechanism, but wait, the question is about Rayleigh scattering. So, perhaps the formula is relevant here.

Wait, I think the formula for Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. The formula is like S ~ 1/λ^4, where S is the scattering strength. So, S is proportional to 1/(wavelength^4).

So, if S_new = 10 * S_initial, and S is proportional to 1/λ^4, then:

10 = (λ_initial^4) / (λ_new^4)

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write the formula properly.

Rayleigh scattering intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4). So, if I have an initial scattering S_initial proportional to 1/(λ_initial^4), and a new scattering S_new proportional to 1/(λ_new^4). So, the ratio S_new/S_initial is (λ_initial^4)/(λ_new^4).

The question states that S_new is 10 times S_initial. So:

S_new / S_initial = 10.

So,

(λ_initial^4) / (λ_new^4) = 10.

Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:

λ_initial / λ_new = 10^(1/4).

What's 10^(1/4)? 10^0.25.

Hmm, 10^0.5 is about 3.16, so 10^0.25 is a bit less. Let me compute. Since 3^2 is 9, 3.16^2 is about 10, so 3.16 is sqrt(10). Hmm, 3.16 is approximately 10^(0.5). But 10^(0.25) is the square root of 3.16, which is about 1.778. So approximately 1.778.

So, λ_initial / λ_new ≈ 1.778.

So, λ_new ≈ λ_initial / 1.778.

λ_initial is 635 nm.

So, λ_new ≈ 635 / 1.778 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 635 by 1.778.

Hmm, 1.778 times 357 is about 630. Because 1.778 * 350 is 622.3, and 1.778 *7 is about 12.446, so 622.3 +12.446=634.746, which is close to 635. So about 357 nm.

So the new wavelength is about 357 nm. Let me check the options. Looking back, option E is 357 nm. So that's the answer.

But wait, wait. The question is about scattering being 10 times as much. So if the initial scattering is S_initial, and the new is 10*S_initial, then the ratio is 10.

Wait, so earlier I thought λ_new is about 357. But the options have an option E as 357 nm. But the initial wavelength is 635 nm, which is longer than 357. So, according to the formula, if λ decreases, scattering increases. So if 635 nm (higher) gives S_initial, then 357 nm (lower) would give S_new = 10 times more.

Wait, but according to the formula, S_new is larger when λ is smaller. So, when λ is 357 nm, which is shorter than 635 nm, the scattering is higher. So the ratio S_new / S_initial would be 10.

But wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculation. Because the formula is S ~ 1/λ^4. So the ratio is S_new/S_initial = (λ_initial^4)/(λ_new^4) = 10.

Therefore, (635^4)/(λ_new^4) = 10.

So, solving for λ_new: λ_new = 635 / (10)^(1/4) ≈ 635 / 1.778 ≈ 357 nm.

So the new wavelength is 357 nm, which is option E.

So the answer should be E.

The question involves understanding the relationship between the wavelength of light and the scattering it causes according to the Rayleigh scattering law. Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, meaning \( S \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \). The problem states that the scattering is 10 times as much at a new wavelength, requiring the calculation of this wavelength.

Using the formula:

\[
\frac{S_{\text{new}}}{S_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{initial}}^4}{\lambda_{\text{new}}^4}
\]

we set \( S_{\text{new}} = 10 \times S_{\text{initial}} \), leading to:

\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{initial}}^4}{\lambda_{\text{new}}^4} = 10
\]

Taking the fourth root of both sides:

\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{initial}}}{\lambda_{\text{new}}} = 10^{1/4}
\]

Approximating \( 10^{1/4} \) as 1.778, we solve for \( \lambda_{\text{new}} \):

\[
\lambda_{\text{new}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{initial}}}{1.778}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{initial}} = 635 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
\lambda_{\text{new}} \approx \frac{635}{1.778} \approx 357 \, \text{nm}
\]

Thus, the wavelength that results in 10 times the scattering is \( 357 \, \text{nm} \). Among the options provided, this corresponds to **option E**.
