Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the empirical formula of a compound, and I remember that the empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms in the compound.

The problem states that a compound consists only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The total mass is 29.05 grams. The mass of carbon is 18.02 grams, and hydrogen is 3.03 grams. I need to find the empirical formula from the options given.

First, I think I should find the mass of oxygen. Since the total is 29.05 and the sum of carbon and hydrogen is 18.02 + 3.03, that's 21.05 grams. Subtracting that from the total gives me the oxygen mass. So 29.05 - 21.05 equals 8.00 grams of oxygen. Wait, but wait, let me double-check that math. 18.02 + 3.03 is 21.05. 29.05 minus 21.05 is 8.00 grams. Yep.

Next, I need to convert these masses into moles because the empirical formula is based on moles. The molar masses are: carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen is 1.008, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol.

Let's compute each:

Carbon: 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol = approximately 1.5 mol. Let me calculate that more accurately. 18.02 divided by 12.01. Hmm, 12 times 1.5 is 18, so 18.02 is just a bit more than 18. So 18.02 / 12.01 ≈ 1.5 mol. Maybe a tiny bit more, maybe 1.501 or something. But perhaps I'll just take it as 1.5 mol for the sake of calculation.

Hydrogen: 3.03 g / 1.008 g/mol. Let me compute that. 3.03 / 1.008. Hmm. 1.008 times 3 is 3.024, which is close to 3.03. So 3.03 / 1.008 is approximately 3.008, but maybe a bit less. Let me do the division more precisely. 1.008 * 3 = 3.024. So 3.03 is 0.006 more than 3.024. So 0.006 / 1.008 = approximately 0.00595. So the total is about 3.00595 mol. Let me say approximately 3.006 mol.

Oxygen: 8.00 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.5 mol. That's straightforward.

So now, I have the moles of each element:

C: 1.5 mol
H: ~3.006 mol
O: 0.5 mol

I think I should divide each by the smallest number of moles to get the simplest ratio. The smallest here is 0.5 mol for oxygen.

Divide each by 0.5:

C: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3
H: 3.006 / 0.5 ≈ 6.012
O: 0.5 / 0.5 = 1

So the ratios are approximately 3 : 6.012 : 1. Wait, H is about 6.012, which is almost 6. So the ratio is 3 : 6 : 1.

So the empirical formula would be C3H6O1. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

A: C2H6O3

B: C2H4O2

C: C2H4O

D: C4H8O2

E: C2H5O

F: C3H6O

G: C3H8O2

H: C3H7O2

I: C4H6O3

J: C3H8O3

Wait, none of the options have C3H6O1. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the mass calculations. Let's double-check:

Total mass is 29.05g. Carbon is 18.02, hydrogen 3.03. So 18.02 + 3.03 = 21.05g. Oxygen is 29.05 -21.05=8.00g. Correct.

Molar masses:

Carbon: 12.01 g/mol

Hydrogen: 1.008 g/mol

Oxygen: 16.00 g/mol

Carbon's moles: 18.02 /12.01 = approximately 1.5 mol.

Hydrogen: 3.03 /1.008. Let me compute that accurately.

1.008 * 3 = 3.024. So 3.03 is 3.024 + 0.006. So 0.006 / 1.008 = 0.00595. So 3.00595 mol.

Oxygen: 8.00 /16 = 0.5 mol.

So moles are 1.5, ~3.006, 0.5.

Divide each by 0.5.

C: 1.5 /0.5 =3

H: 3.006 /0.5=6.012

O: 0.5 /0.5=1

So the ratio is 3 :6.012 :1. But the options don't have this. Wait, what if I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me think again.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should use precise division.

Let me do it step by step.

Carbon: 18.02 / 12.01.

12.01 *1.5 = 18.015. That's very close to 18.02. So 18.02 /12.01 = 1.500... almost 1.5.

Hydrogen: 3.03/1.008.

1.008 *3=3.024. 3.03-3.024=0.006.

0.006 /1.008= 0.00595238.

So 3.00595238 mol.

Oxygen: 8.00/16.00=0.5.

So moles are:

C: 1.500

H: approximately 3.006

O: 0.5

Divide each by 0.5:

C: 3

H: 6.012

O:1

Hmm, the ratio is 3 :6.012 :1.

Looking at the options, I don't see this. The closest is option F, which is C3H6O. So that would correspond to 3:6:1.

Wait, but in the options given, option F is C3H6O.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the hydrogen's moles.

Wait, let me calculate 3.03 /1.008 more accurately.

1.008 * 3 = 3.024. So 3.03 is 0.006 more than 3.024.

0.006 / 1.008 = let's calculate it.

0.006 ÷ 1.008.

1.008 = 1008/1000 = 252/250.

Wait, perhaps better to compute decimal division.

1.008 ) 0.006

Hmm, 1.008 is bigger than 0.006, so 0.006 /1.008 = 0.00595 approximately.

So 3.006 mol, which is 3 + 0.006/1.008 → wait no, I think I confused the division.

Wait, to compute 3.03 /1.008, let me think in terms of 3.03 divided by 1.008.

1.008 *3 =3.024. So 3.024 is less than 3.03 by 0.006.

So 3.03 =3.024 + 0.006 → 3.024 is (3.006 mol *1.008 g/mol) → wait, no, that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

3.03 /1.008 = ?

Let me write it as 3.03 ÷ 1.008.

I can compute this division.

Well, 1.008 * 3.006 = ?

3 *1.008 = 3.024. 0.006 *1.008= 0.006048. So 3.024 + 0.006048 = 3.030048.

Wait, that's very close to 3.03.

So 3.006 *1.008 = 3.030048.

So 3.03 /1.008 = 3.006 approximately.

So the moles of H are approximately 3.006.

So, when we divide each by 0.5 (the smallest mole value), we get:

C: 1.5 /0.5 =3

H: 3.006 /0.5 =6.012

O: 0.5 /0.5 =1

So the ratio is C : H : O = 3 :6.012 :1.

Hmm. But none of the options have this. Let me look again.

Options are:

A: C2H6O3 → C2H6O3.

B: C2H4O2.

C: C2H4O.

D: C4H8O2.

E: C2H5O.

F: C3H6O.

G: C3H8O2.

H: C3H7O2.

I: C4H6O3.

J: C3H8O3.

Wait, none of the options have a 3:6 ratio for H and O.

Wait, wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the total mass. Let me check the question again.

The question says the mass of the compound is 29.05 g. The mass of C is 18.02 g, H is 3.03 g. So O is 29.05-18.02-3.03=29.05-21.05=8.00g.

So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the moles more precisely.

Carbon: 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol.

I'll compute 18.02 divided by 12.01.

12.01 * 1.5 =18.015, which is very close to 18.02. So 18.02 is 12.01 *1.5 + (18.02-18.015) =12.01 *1.5 +0.005.

So 18.02 /12.01 =1.5 + (0.005)/(12.01) → 0.005 /12.01 is approximately 0.000416. So 1.500416 mol.

Similarly, hydrogen: 3.03 /1.008.

1.008 *3=3.024. 3.03-3.024=0.006.

So 0.006 /1.008 = 0.006 / 1.008 = 0.00595238.

So 3.00595238.

O: 8.00/16=0.5.

So moles are:

C: ~1.5004 mol

H: ~3.00595 mol

O: 0.5 mol

Divide each by 0.5 mol:

C: 1.5004 /0.5=3.0008

H: 3.00595/0.5=6.0119

O: 0.5 /0.5=1.

So the ratio is approximately 3.0008 :6.0119 :1.

Hmm. So the ratio is approximately 3 :6 :1, which is option F: C3H6O.

Wait, but option F is C3H6O, which would mean the ratio is 3:6:1.

So why isn't the correct calculation giving 3.0008, 6.0119, 1? Because the empirical formula requires the smallest whole number ratio.

Wait, but 3.0008 is about 3.001, which rounds to 3. So 3,6,1.

But wait, why is the H's ratio 6.0119?

Because the H is more than 6. So perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me double-check the moles.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the exact ratio using more precise numbers.

Let me compute each mole:

Carbon: 18.02 /12.01 = ?

12.01 * 1.5 is 18.015. 18.02-18.015 =0.005.

So 0.005 /12.01 = approximately 0.000416.

So 1.5 + 0.000416=1.500416 mol.

Hydrogen: 3.03 /1.008.

1.008 *3 =3.024.

3.03-3.024=0.006.

0.006/1.008= 0.00595238 mol.

Oxygen:8/16=0.5.

So the moles are exactly:

C: 1.500416

H:3.00595238

O:0.5

Divide each by the smallest (0.5):

C: 1.500416 / 0.5 =3.000832

H:3.00595238/0.5=6.01190476

O:1.

So the ratio is approximately 3.000832 :6.01190476 :1.

So practically, that's 3 :6 :1.

Therefore, the empirical formula is C3H6O. But wait, option F is C3H6O.

But wait, looking at the options again, option F is indeed C3H6O.

But earlier calculation suggested that the H is about 6.01, which is nearly 6. So the ratio is 3:6:1.

But wait, let me check if the H is 6.01, and the O is 1, so 3:6:1. So the formula is C3H6O, which is option F.

But wait, one of the options is C3H6O, which is option F.

Wait, but option F is C3H6O. So that would make the formula C3H6O.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio more precisely.

Let me try that.

Carbon: 18.02 g /12.01 = 1.500416 mol.

Hydrogen:3.03 /1.008 =3.00595238 mol.

Oxygen:0.5 mol.

So when we divide each by 0.5:

C: 1.500416 mol /0.5 → 3.000832 → approximately 3.

H: 3.00595238 /0.5 →6.01190476 → approximately 6.01.

O:1.

So the ratio is approximately 3 :6.01 :1.

Which would imply that the empirical formula is C3H6O.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is C3H6O, which is the same as what I have. So the correct answer should be option F.

Wait, but wait, I'm looking at the options again. Let me check each option.

Options:

A: C2H6O3 → moles C:2, H:6, O:3.

B: C2H4O2 → C2, H4, O2.

C: C2H4O → C2H4O.

D: C4H8O2 → C4, H8, O2.

E: C2H5O → C2, H5, O.

F: C3H6O → C3, H6, O.

G: C3H8O2 → C3, H8, O2.

H: C3H7O2 → C3, H7, O2.

I: C4H6O3 → C4, H6, O3.

J: C3H8O3 → C3, H8, O3.

So if our calculation gives C3H6O, which is option F, then the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the empirical formula is based on the simplest integer ratio. So perhaps the answer is F.

But wait, wait another moment. Let me think about the given options again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach: perhaps the formula is C3H6O.

But wait, let me verify: the calculated ratio is 3 :6 :1.

So the formula is C3H6O.

But looking at the options, option F is C3H6O.

So that should be the correct answer.

But earlier, I thought that the empirical formula would be C3H6O, which is option F.

Wait, but wait, the options don't include any other options that match this ratio. So the correct answer should be F.

But wait, let me see the options once again.

Wait, the options are:

A: C2H6O3

B: C2H4O2

C: C2H4O

D: C4H8O2

E: C2H5O

F: C3H6O

G: C3H8O2

H: C3H7O2

I: C4H6O3

J: C3H8O3

So yes, option F is C3H6O. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, I think I made a mistake. Because in the options, the formula C3H6O is present, but option F is exactly this. So according to the calculation, option F is correct.

Wait, but wait, I just thought of another possibility. Are the options given in a different order? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, I think the calculation is correct. So I think the correct answer is option F: C3H6O.

But wait, wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the moles using exact values.

Let me compute the moles again.

Carbon: 18.02 g /12.01 g/mol.

12.01 *1.5=18.015 → 18.02 is 18.015 +0.005.

So 0.005 /12.01 = 0.000416.

So 1.5 +0.000416=1.500416.

Hydrogen:3.03 g /1.008 g/mol.

1.008 *3=3.024 →3.03 -3.024=0.006.

0.006 /1.008=0.00595238.

Oxygen:0.5 mol.

So, moles:

C:1.500416

H:3.00595238

O:0.5

Now, the smallest is 0.5.

Divide each by 0.5:

C:3.000832

H:6.01190476

O:1.

So the ratio is 3.0008 :6.0119 :1.

Which is approximately 3:6:1.

So the empirical formula is C3H6O.

Which is option F.

So the correct answer is F.

But let me see the options again. Option F is C3H6O, which matches the calculation.

Wait, wait, but I just noticed that the formula I get is C3H6O, but the options don't have any other options that match this ratio except F, which is C3H6O.

So the correct answer is F.

But wait, wait, let me think once more.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the moles in terms of the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula of the compound.

Wait, the mass of the compound is 29.05g. The mass of C is 18.02g, H is 3.03g, O is 8.00g.

So the empirical formula is C3H6O, which is option F.

So the correct answer is F.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is C3H6O.

So the answer is F.
</think>

To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we start by calculating the moles of each element based on the given masses. The total mass of the compound is 29.05 g, with the mass of carbon (C) being 18.02 g, hydrogen (H) being 3.03 g, and oxygen (O) being 8.00 g.

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of each element
- **Carbon (C):**  
  \[
  \frac{18.02 \, \text{g}}{12.01 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1.5004 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- **Hydrogen (H):**  
  \[
  \frac{3.03 \, \text{g}}{1.008 \, \text{g/mol}} = 3.0059 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- **Oxygen (O):**  
  \[
  \frac{8.00 \, \text{g}}{16.00 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.5000 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the smallest whole number ratio
The smallest whole number ratio is found by dividing each mole value by the smallest mole value (0.5000 mol). This gives:

- **Carbon (C):**  
  \[
  \frac{1.5004 \, \text{mol}}{0.5000 \, \text{mol}} = 3.0008
  \]
- **Hydrogen (H):**  
  \[
  \frac{3.0059 \, \text{mol}}{0.5000 \, \text{mol}} = 6.0119
  \]
- **Oxygen (O):**  
  \[
  \frac{0.5000 \, \text{mol}}{0.5000 \, \text{mol}} = 1.0000
  \]

Rounding to the nearest whole numbers, the ratio is approximately **3 : 6 : 1**.

### Step 3: Identify the correct empirical formula
The empirical formula corresponds to the ratio **3 : 6 : 1**, which matches **C₃H₆O**. Among the given options, **C₃H₆O** is option **F**.

### Final Answer
The empirical formula of the compound is **C₃H₆O**, which corresponds to option **F**.

ANSWER: F
