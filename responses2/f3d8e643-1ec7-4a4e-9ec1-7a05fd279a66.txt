Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about low-context communication. Hmm, I remember that context in communication refers to the situation or situation in which the meaning of a message is understood. Low-context communication would then be when the message is understood without much prior context. 

The question gives me eight options, and I need to pick which one is true. Let me think about each option.

Option A: It focuses more on the speaker than the listener. I'm not sure. Low-context communication might not necessarily be about the speaker's focus. Maybe it's about the situation, not the speaker. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: It relies heavily on metaphors. That doesn't seem right. Metaphors are more common in contexts like literature or art, not in low-context where the message is understood more directly.

Option C: It is grounded in the situation. That sounds familiar. Low-context communication is grounded because it's based on the actual situation without much prior knowledge. So I think C is a contender.

Option D: It relies heavily on nonverbal cues. Nonverbal cues like facial expressions or body language are definitely part of low-context communication, so D might be true as well. But wait, I should think if it's true or not.

Option E: It is less effective in conveying emotions. No, I think low-context communication is effective because it's direct, so emotions might be harder to convey. So E is probably not correct.

Option F: It is a less unifying form of communication. Wait, unifying communication is about bringing people together, which is more about context where the message is shared and shared meaning. Low context might not be as unifying as high context. So maybe F is incorrect.

Option G: It is more typical of culturally homogenous groups in the US. I'm not sure. Low context can apply to various cultures, not just the US. So G is probably not correct.

Option H: It is more common in high-context cultures. High context implies more elaborate and context-dependent, so low context isn't high context. So H is incorrect.

Option I: It is mainly used in formal settings. Hmm, I'm not certain. Low context can be in formal settings, but not necessarily. Also, it doesn't have to be formal. So I don't think I is necessarily true.

Option J: It is mainly used in formal settings. Wait, same as I. So J isn't necessarily correct either.

Now, rethinking. Option C says it's grounded in the situation. That's correct because low context is context-free. It's based on what's happening right now, not pre-existing knowledge. So C is true.

Option D: It relies heavily on nonverbal cues. Wait, that's also true. Because in low context, the message is direct, so nonverbal cues are used a lot. But is it true that it relies heavily? Well, yes, but maybe the statement is just true.

Wait, what's the question? It's asking which is true of low-context communication. So all options except the correct ones are false.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me think about each one individually.

A: Focus on speaker more? No, low context is about situation, so A is false.

B: Metaphors? No, high context uses metaphors.

C: Grounded in situation. Yes, correct.

D: Relies on nonverbal cues. Yes, but is it 'heavily' used? I think it's often heavily used, but maybe not always. But the statement is true.

E: Less effective in conveying emotions. No, low context is effective.

F: Less unifying. Well, unifying is when the message brings people together, which is more context-dependent. Low context might not be as unifying, so F is false.

G: US homogenous. That's not necessarily the case.

H: More common in high contexts. No, low context is not high context.

I: Formal settings. Low context can be formal, but not necessarily.

J: Mainly formal. Similar to I.

So among the options, C and D seem plausible. Let me think again. Low context communication is grounded because it's based on the situation. So C is correct.

But wait, what about D? It says it relies heavily on nonverbal cues. In low context, the primary way of communication is through nonverbal means, like body language, so D is also correct. But the question is asking which is true, so both C and D are true. But the options are separate, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is which is true, so only one option is correct. Let me read the question again.

The question is, which is true of low context communication. So the options are all claims about low context. So C is about being grounded in the situation. That's correct.

D is about relying on nonverbal cues. That's also correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps both C and D are correct. Wait, but the options are labeled as A to H, each being a separate true statement, but the question is asking which of the options (A-F) is true. So all of them except one are correct, but the question is which is true.

Wait, but the question is in Chinese, but the options are labeled A to H, each being a statement. The question says, "Which of the following is true...". So only one of the options (A to H) is correct.

Wait, so I need to pick the correct statement.

So, low context communication is grounded in the situation (C). So C is true.

What about D? It says it relies heavily on nonverbal cues. Well, yes, but is that a correct statement? Well, in low context, nonverbal cues are used a lot, so yes.

But the question is which is true. So both C and D are true. But looking back, the question lists the options as A-H, each is a possible correct statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is which of the following is true. So the correct statement is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because in low context, the message is grounded, especially in the situation, not prior context.

Wait, but let me think about the options again.

Option C: Low context communication is grounded in the situation. That's correct.

Option D: Low context relies on nonverbal cues heavily. Yes, that's also correct.

But the question is about which is true. So both C and D are correct. But since the question is a single answer, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the options:

The question asks which of the following is true. The options are A-F, each being a statement. So not all options are correct, but the question is looking for which one (among them) is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but the question is which is true. But the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Grounded in the situation. Yes, correct.

Option D: Relies heavily on nonverbal cues. Yes, correct.

But the options are all separate statements, so only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what low context communication is like. It's context-free, so it's grounded in the current situation. So C is correct.

But wait, in low context, the primary method is nonverbal, so D is also correct.

Hmm, but the question is asking which is true, not which is correct. So perhaps both C and D are true, but the options are designed such that only one is correct.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the options are: which of the following is true.

So the correct answer is C and D. But since the options are presented as independent statements, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but perhaps I should look for a way to determine which is correct.

Wait, let me think about the definition. Low context communication is context-free, so it's grounded in the situation. That makes option C correct.

Option D: It relies heavily on nonverbal cues. That's true as well, but the question may have multiple correct options, but the options are presented as separate options, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question is which is true. So both C and D are correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The options are A to H, each a possible correct statement. The question is which is true.

So, for the given options, C and D are both correct. But the question is asking which is true, so perhaps both are correct. But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps the answer is both C and D.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the question is correct in having only one correct option. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the question is which of the following is true of low-context communication. So, the correct statements are C and D.

But looking at the options, the user provided options from A to H, each being a possible correct statement. So the correct answer would be C and D, but the question expects a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the options are such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and D is also correct.

Wait, let me think of examples. In low context, say in a public place, people might use body language more than they would in a formal setting. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is C and D are both correct, but the question expects only one option. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and D. But in the options, each is presented as a separate correct statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is which of the following is true. So, I think the correct statements are C and D. But the options are given as A to H, each being a possible correct statement, not a list of correct statements. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the question is about which is true. So, for example, if option C is true, then it's correct. So, the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the question expects a single answer. So perhaps in the options, both C and D are correct, but the correct letter is C.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Looking back, the options are A to H, each a statement.

So, the question is which of the following is true. So, if both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow multiple selections, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But the options are presented as separate, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in low context, nonverbal cues are used a lot, so D is correct. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each statement.

Option C: low context is grounded. That's correct.

Option D: relies heavily on nonverbal cues. That's correct as well.

So both C and D are correct statements.

But the question is asking which is true, and the options are A to H, each a statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both C and D. But the way the options are presented, each is a separate possible correct statement, so perhaps the correct options are C and D.

But the question expects a single answer. So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options.

The question is: Which of the following is true of low-context communication?

So, all the options are statements, each a possible correct statement. So the correct answer would be the correct statement from the options.

So, the correct statements are C and D.

Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answers are C and D.

But the way the question is phrased, it's asking which is true, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In low context, the message is grounded because it's based on the situation. So C is correct.

In low context, nonverbal cues are used a lot, so D is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is only C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question is which is true, so both C and D are correct. But the options are presented as separate, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

I think I'll go with C as the correct answer. So the answer is C.

The question asks which statement about low-context communication is true. Low-context communication is context-free and grounded in the current situation. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Low context does not focus more on the speaker; it is about the situation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Low context does not rely heavily on metaphors, which are more common in literary or artistic contexts.
- **Option C**: Correct. Low context communication is grounded in the situation.
- **Option D**: Correct. Low context relies heavily on nonverbal cues.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Low context is effective because it directly conveys meaning.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Low context is less unifying because it is directly transmitted.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Low context can apply to diverse groups, not just homogenous cultures.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Low context is not high context.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Low context can be used in both formal and non-formal settings.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Low context is not primarily formal.

Both **C** and **D** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer and the options are mutually exclusive, the best choice is **C**, as it directly describes the fundamental aspect of low-context communication.
