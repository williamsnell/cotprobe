Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shipley and Star ordering portable cassette machines from StereoElectronics. Let's see what it's about. The question has two parts: (a) and (b). I'll need to tackle each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): The invoice was dated June 10 with terms (n/30) ROG. The machines were received on July 30, and we need to find the due date for the payment.

Hmm, terms are (n/30) ROG. I remember ROG stands for Net 30 days. So that means the payment is due within 30 days from the date of the invoice, and no discount is given. So, the payment is due by July 30 + 30 days.

Wait, let me calculate that. June 10 to July 30. June has 30 days, so from June 10 to June 30 is 20 days (including the 10th?), wait no, wait. Let me count:

June 10 is the invoice date. So, June 10 is day 0. June has 30 days, so June 10 to June 30 is 21 days (including June 10). Then from July 1 to July 30 is 30 days. So total is 21 + 30 = 51 days. Wait, but (n/30) means 30 days. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. The term is Net 30, so 30 days after the invoice date. So the due date is June 10 plus 30 days. Let's count:

June 10 is day 0. Adding 30 days would take us to June 30 (since June has 30 days, so June 10 plus 20 days is June 30). Wait, no, because June 10 + 30 days: June has 30 days, so 10 + 30 = 40, but June only has 30 days. So June 10 is day 1, so day 31 would be July 1. Wait, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, June 10 plus 30 days: June 10 is day 1. Adding 30 days, the due date would be June 10 + 30 days = July 30. Wait, no. Let me think: June has 30 days. June 10 to June 30 is 21 days (including June 10, since from day 1 to day 21 is 21 days). Then from July 1 to July 30 is 30 days, adding to 21 +30 =51 days. But that can't be right because (n/30) is 30 days. So wait, the due date is June 10 +30 days = July 30. So the payment is due on July 30. But the machines were received on July 30. Wait, does that mean the payment is due on July 30? So the due date is July 30.

Wait, but the question says "on June 3, they ordered, and the invoice was due on June 10. The machines were received on July 30." So the due date is when? If the terms are net 30, they're due 30 days after June 10, which is July 30. So the payment would be due on July 30. So the answer for part (a) would be July 30. Looking at the options, option D is July 30, $967.95. But wait, let me double-check. Or is it that the machines were received on July 30, and so the payment is due on July 30? But the question says, "the payment is due if the machines were received on July 30." So that's when?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. The terms were (n/30) ROG. I think ROG stands for "net 30 days" or "net 30" meaning 30 days. So the standard is that you can pay on the 30th day. So if the invoice date was June 10, you have 30 days to pay. So July 30 is the due date.

So part (a) answer is July 30 as per option D.

Now part (b): If the terms are (2/10), (n/30), and payment is made on August 4, what amount is paid.

Wait, terms (2/10), (n/30) means that 2% discount is allowed if paid within 10 days. So if payment is made on August 4, which is within 10 days after the invoice date, then the discount applies.

The invoice date is July 30. August 4 is 14 days after July 30 (July 30 is day 0, August 4 is 14 days later). So within the 10-day window, so the discount applies.

So the amount paid is 987.70 minus 2% of that.

Let me calculate 2% of 987.70: 987.70 * 0.02 = 19.754. So subtracting that gives 987.70 - 19.754 = 967.946, which is approximately $967.95.

Looking at the options, option A is August 4, $967.95. So that's the amount paid.

Wait, option A is correct. So the correct answers are D for part (a) and A for part (b).
</think>

(a) The payment is due 30 days after June 10, which is July 30.  
(b) Since the payment is made within 10 days (August 4 is within the 10-day period), a 2% discount applies. The amount paid is $987.70 - (2% of $987.70) = $967.95.  

**Answer: D and A**
