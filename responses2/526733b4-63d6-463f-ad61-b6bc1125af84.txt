Okay, let's try to figure this out. So Coach Wu has 30 soccer balls in total. Out of these, 9 are white. That means the remaining balls are blue, pink, or green, right? The question says that there's an equal number of each of these three colors. So blue, pink, and green each have the same count. 

Hmm, so I need to find out how many green balls there are. Let's see. If there are 3 different colors and each has the same number, then the total number of non-white balls must be divisible by 3. The white ones are 9, so subtracting those from the total gives me the number of colored balls.

So 30 total minus 9 white is 21 balls that are blue, pink, or green. Now, since these three colors have equal numbers, I can divide 21 by 3 to find out how many of each color there are. 21 divided by 3 is 7. So each color—blue, pink, green—has 7 balls.

Wait, let me make sure that adds up. 9 white plus 7 blue plus 7 pink plus 7 green. That's 9 + 7 = 16, 16 +7=23, 23 +7=30. Yep, that works out. So the number of green balls is 7. Looking at the options, option I is 7, which should be the correct answer.

The total number of soccerballs is 30, with 9 being white. The remaining 21 are equally divided into blue, pink, and green balls. Dividing 21 by 3 gives 7 balls of each color. Therefore, Coach Wu has **7 green soccerballs**.

Answer: **I: 7**
