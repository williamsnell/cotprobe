The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Here is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has "the world before her." Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the "early and improvident marriage," against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. "I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day," said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.
â€”Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890

Okay, so I have this question about a passage and then a multiple-choice question. Let me try to break it down. 

The passage is about a woman in a factory who works hard and gets paid. She has three dollars a week, but her pay is split into room rent, breakfast, and lunch. She's not able to afford coffee, and she gets her meals from home. She's young and pretty, and she has something to do with the world before her. 

The question is asking, which situation in the options is most directly comparable to what this woman is going through. So, I need to link Jacob Riis' scenario to the options given.

Looking at the passage, the woman's situation is about hard work, lack of food, being poor, and living without proper meals. She's a worker who can't afford coffee, which suggests she's struggling to get enough nutrition. She's described as "early and improvident," which means she's in a condition of poverty and lack of material comfort.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Jewish immigrants in New York in the 1880s. I'm not sure. Jewish immigrants might have different backgrounds but not necessarily the same issues as the woman here.

B: Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s. They might be looking for work to improve their living conditions, but the passage doesn't describe their situation as hard or poor.

C: Populist farmers in the 1890s. Populist usually refers to anti-colonialist, so maybe they support workers' rights. Not sure if that's similar.

D: Factory workers in the Industrial Revolution. Oh, this seems very similar. The passage describes a woman working hard, struggling to get enough food, which is exactly the context of factory workers in the early industrial age. So, she's not getting enough food, which is a problem for factory workers who often have to eat off the bench.

E: British soldiers in the 1800s. They were soldiers, but the passage doesn't mention soldiers or their conditions. It's more about workers.

F: Coal miners in the 1900s. They were working on coal mines, but again, the passage doesn't relate to coal miners.

G: Civil Rights activists in the 1960s. They might have worked in factories, but the passage describes the woman's struggles as a factory worker, not as a civil rights activist.

H: Women suffragettes in the early 20th century. They were women working in factories, but the passage doesn't specifically target women suffragettes.

I: American revolutionaries in the 1770s. They were involved in colonizing, not working in factories.

J: Slaves in the antebellum South. That's a different setting, focusing on slavery issues, but the passage is about a woman's struggles in a factory.

So, the passage is about a woman who is hardworking, struggling to get food, and likely working in a factory. The closest option is D: Factory workers in the Industrial Revolution. That's about workers facing similar challenges as in the passage.

The passage describes a woman who struggles to make ends meet, likely due to hard work and lack of food, which is a common issue for factory workers in the early 20th century. This aligns most closely with the situation of factory workers in the Industrial Revolution.
