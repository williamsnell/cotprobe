Question:

A resort computes its guest fees on the basis of the duration of the visit (D) , plus the amount of time spent in the steam-massage room. Tom spends 4 days at the resort and 10 hours in the steam-massage room. In a 7 day stay, Jane spends 30 hours with masseurs. Their bills are $500. and $1,125, respectively. The cost of a visit (C) is given by the following linear equation: C =xD+yH. Find the values of the constants x and y.

Options:

A: x = $100, y = $15
B: x = $75, y = $20
C: x = $90, y = $35
D: x = $70, y = $15
E: x = $125, y = $5
F: x = $50, y = $25
G: x = $85, y = $10
H: x = $60, y = $30
I: x = $40, y = $45
J: x = $20, y = $75

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a resort and their guest fees. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, I'll read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that the resort calculates guest fees using a linear equation C = xD + yH. So, D is the duration of the visit in days, and H is the time spent in the steam-massage room in hours. Tom and Jane are two guests, and their bills are $500 and $1,125 respectively.

Tom spends 4 days and 10 hours there. Jane spends 30 hours with masseurs in a 7-day stay. Their total bills are $500 and $1,125.

Wait, so I need to find the values of x and y in the equation. The options are labeled A to J, with each option giving different values for x and y. So, I need to figure out which pair (x, y) correctly solves the system of equations based on Tom and Jane's visit details and their bills.

Let me jot down the given information.

For Tom:
- D = 4 days
- H = 10 hours
- Total cost (C) = $500

For Jane:
- Duration in a 7-day stay. Wait, does that mean her D is 7 days? Because the problem says a 7-day stay, and Jane's time in the steam room is 30 hours. So for her, D = 7, H =30. But wait, wait. Let me read again. The problem says "In a 7 day stay, Jane spends 30 hours with masseurs." Oh, so Jane's duration is 7 days, and her time is 30 hours.

So now, I can set up two equations.

Equation 1 (Tom): 500 = x*4 + y*10

Equation 2 (Jane): 1125 = x*7 + y*30

So, two equations:

1) 4x + 10y = 500
2) 7x + 30y = 1125

I need to solve this system of equations to find x and y.

Let me try to solve using substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would be easier here.

First, perhaps simplify equation 1 by dividing all terms by 2. That gives 2x + 5y = 250.

Equation 1a: 2x +5y = 250

Equation 2: 7x +30y = 1125

Now, let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate x. Multiply equation 1a by 7, and equation 2 by 2.

Equation 1a *7: 14x +35y = 1750
Equation 2 *2: 14x +60y = 2250

Now subtract equation 1a*7 from equation 2*2 to eliminate x.

(14x +60y) - (14x +35y) = 2250 -1750
14x -14x +60y -35y = 500
25y = 500

So, y =500 /25 = 20.

That gives y=20. Now plug this back into equation 1a.

2x +5*(20) =250
2x +100 =250
2x=150
x=75.

So x is $75 and y is $20. Looking at the options, that's option B: x=75, y=20. But wait! Let me double-check.

Wait, another way to check is to plug x=75 and y=20 into both equations.

For Tom's cost: 4*75 +10*20 = 300 +200=500. Correct, matches the bill.

Jane's cost:7*75 +30*20 = 525 +600=1125. Correct.

Yes, both equations are satisfied. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

The problem involves determining the constants x and y in the cost equation C = xD + yH based on the given guest fees. By setting up and solving the system of equations derived from Tom and Jane's visits, we find that x = $75 and y = $20. This matches option B.

**Answer: B**
