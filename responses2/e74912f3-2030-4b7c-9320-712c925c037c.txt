Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man told his neighbor, "If you will mow my lawn, I will pay you $50. " The neighbor then purchased gasoline for the mower so he could mow the lawn. The neighbor wheeled his lawn mower to the man's property and started the engine. At that moment, the man suddenly yelled, "I hereby revoke my offer. "If the neighbor thereafter mows the man's lawn, will he recover the $50?

Options:

A: Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.
B: No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation.
C: Yes, because the neighbor can sue for breach of oral contract.
D: Yes, because the neighbor had begun the task before the man revoked his offer.
E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.
F: No, because there was no written contract and hence no legal obligation for the man to pay.
G: No, because the neighbor did not get a written agreement from the man.
H: No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.
I: No, because the man revoked his offer before the task was completed.
J: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this contract law question. Let's read it again.

The man tells his neighbor that if she mows his lawn, he'll pay $50. The neighbor buys gasoline for the mower, starts it, and begins the task. Then the man yells and revokes his offer. Now, the question is, if the neighbor mows the man's lawn, will he recover the $50?

Hmm. So, what's the key here? It's about contracts, specifically whether the offer was unalterable or irrevocable before the man's revocation.

The man made a unilateral contract. Wait, what's a unilateral contract? It's a contract where only one party makes an offer, and the other has no alternative. Here, the man's offer to pay is unilateral because he's the one who's offering to pay, and the neighbor is the one who's willing to perform.

Now, when the man yells to revoke, does that make the contract irrevocable? Irrevocable means the offer can't be broken or reversed. If the man's offer was irrevocable, then the neighbor can't just cancel it. But if it was unrevocable, meaning it was already done, then the neighbor couldn't breach it.

Wait, but the man's revocation happened before the neighbor actually completed the task. So, when the man revoked, the neighbor didn't finish. So, the contract might not have been performed yet.

In the context of contracts, the nature of the agreement matters. If it's a written contract, then the revocation is more about the offer being unalterable. But the question doesn't say anything about a written agreement, just that the man made an offer. So, perhaps it's an oral contract.

Wait, but the man's revocation happened before the neighbor started mowing. So, the contract was never completed. So, the contract can't be breached because the work wasn't done yet.

Wait, but I remember that in some cases, even if the contract is unrevocable, if the performance hasn't been completed, the contract is still unenforceable. Because the performance comes after the revocation.

Wait, no. I think when the contract is unrevocable, the performance isn't required. So, the contract remains unenforceable. So, if the man revokes the offer, and the neighbor hasn't started mowing yet, then the contract hasn't been performed, so the man can't claim breach.

But wait, the question says the neighbor mows the man's lawn after the man revoked. So, the neighbor starts mowing immediately after the revocation. So, the neighbor has started the work, but hasn't finished. Wait, but in contract law, the performance must happen even if the revocation occurs before. So, if the man revoked before the neighbor started, the contract is still unenforceable because the performance hasn't been completed.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. So, the man makes an offer, the neighbor does the work, revokes the offer, and then the neighbor does the work again. But the question says the neighbor mows after the revocation. So, does the neighbor have a case to sue?

In the case of a unilateral contract, if it's unrevocable, the performance isn't required. So, if the man revokes, but the neighbor hasn't started, the contract is unenforceable. So, the neighbor can't sue because the contract hasn't been performed.

But wait, another approach: the man's revocation is effective, but the neighbor hasn't yet started the task. So, the neighbor is still in the process of mowing. So, the contract hasn't been performed, so the man can't recover because the neighbor hasn't fulfilled the obligation.

Wait, but the question is whether the neighbor will recover the $50. So, if the contract is unrevocable, but the neighbor hasn't started, then he can't perform. So, he can't get the money back.

But wait, another angle: if the contract was oral, and the man's revocation happened before the neighbor started, then the contract is unenforceable. So, the neighbor can't sue.

So, looking at the options:

Option A says yes, because the offer was unrevocable. But if the offer was unrevocable, then the contract is unenforceable. So, the neighbor can't recover.

Option E says yes under the doctrine of quasi-contract. Hmm. Quasi-contract applies when a contract is formed when one party performs a promise, but the other doesn't. But in this case, the neighbor hasn't performed any promise yet. So, that might not apply.

Wait, but the concept of quasi-contract is when one party performs a promise, and the other doesn't, but they are related. I'm not sure that's applicable here.

Wait, the man's revocation happened before the neighbor started mowing. So, the neighbor hasn't yet started the task. So, the contract hasn't been performed. Therefore, the man cannot recover.

Looking at the options, option A says yes because the offer was unrevocable. But the man's revocation made the offer unrevocable, but if the neighbor hasn't started, the offer is unenforceable, so the man can't sue. So, option A's reasoning might be incorrect.

Option E says the neighbor had already incurred expenses before the man's revocation. Wait, the neighbor bought gasoline. Does that count as expenses? Maybe. But the issue is whether the contract was performed. If the neighbor hasn't started, the contract isn't performed, so no recovery.

Option J says yes because the neighbor had already incurred expenses. But that's about the cost, not the performance.

So, the correct reasoning is that the man's revocation stopped the contract from being performed. So, the neighbor can't recover.

So, looking at the options, which state that the neighbor can't recover because the contract was unenforceable. Let's see.

Option A: Yes, because unrevocable offer. But if the offer was unrevocable, then the contract can't be broken. But wait, perhaps the man's revocation made the offer unrevocable, but if the neighbor hasn't started, the contract remains unenforceable.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the contract law.

If a contract is unrevocable, then it can't be broken. So, if the man revokes, the contract remains unenforceable. So, the neighbor cannot sue because they haven't done anything yet.

So, the man's revocation made the contract unenforceable, regardless of whether the neighbor started. So, the answer might be E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract. Or, no, because the man's revocation stopped the contract.

Wait, but the man's revocation happened before the neighbor started. So, the performance isn't completed. So, the contract isn't performed. Therefore, the man can't recover.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable. So, the man's revocation made it unrevocable. But if the contract is unrevocable, the performance isn't required. So, the neighbor hasn't started, so the contract is still unenforceable.

Wait, no. If it's unrevocable, the contract isn't broken, but the performance hasn't happened. So, the contract remains unenforceable, meaning the man cannot sue.

So, the correct answer would be that the neighbor can't recover. Let me look at the options.

Option E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract. Hmm. I'm not sure about that. Because quasi-contract is when one party performs a promise and the other doesn't, but it's more about the promise and the promiseee's performance. So, if the neighbor hasn't started, that may not apply.

Alternatively, option A says yes, because the offer was unrevocable. But if the offer was unrevocable, the contract is unenforceable regardless. So, the man's revocation can't make it enforceable. So, even if the offer was unrevocable, the neighbor hasn't started, so the contract isn't performed.

So, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover because the contract is unenforceable, which is option E? Wait, no. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the man's revocation happened before the neighbor started. So, the contract is unrevocable (so the offer can't be broken), but the neighbor hasn't started. So, the contract isn't performed, so the man can't recover. So, the answer is E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract. Or wait, perhaps no, because the neighbor hasn't yet begun the task.

Wait, but the neighbor mows the lawn after the man's revocation. So, the neighbor is performing the task now, but hasn't started yet. So, the performance hasn't been completed. So, the contract is unenforceable.

So, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, so the answer is E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract? Or is it that since the man's revocation stopped the contract, the neighbor can't perform, so he can't recover.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable. But if the offer is unrevocable, the contract can't be broken. But if the neighbor hasn't started, it's still unenforceable.

Option E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract. Quasi-contract applies when one party performs a promise (like the neighbor mowing the lawn) and the other doesn't. But in this case, the neighbor has started the task, so maybe quasi-contract doesn't apply.

Alternatively, maybe the man's revocation stopped the contract, so the neighbor can't recover.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover. But looking at the options, which choice aligns with that.

The options are:

A: Yes, because unrevocable offer.

B: No, because neighbor didn't do anything more.

C: Yes, because neighbor can sue for oral contract.

D: No, because man's revocation effective.

E: Yes, under quasi-contract.

H: No, man's revocation effective, neighbor didn't complete.

Wait, the man's revocation is effective because the neighbor had already incurred expenses (the gasoline). So, that's option H. But that's about the cost, not the contract performance.

So, the only options that say the man's revocation stopped the contract are A and E. Wait, option A says yes because the offer was unrevocable. But if the offer was unrevocable, then the contract can't be broken. So, if the contract is unrevocable, the man can't revoke it. But then, if the neighbor hasn't started, the contract isn't performed, so the man can't sue.

Wait, so if the offer is unrevocable, the man can't revoke it, so the contract remains unenforceable. So, the neighbor can't get money back because the contract is unenforceable.

So, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, so the answer would be option E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract. But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the neighbor's actions after the man's revocation mean the contract is broken. So, the man's revocation stopped the offer, making the contract unenforceable. So, the neighbor can't perform, so he can't recover.

In that case, the correct answer is A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable.

Wait, but if the offer is unrevocable, the man can't breach it, so the neighbor can't get money back. So, the answer is E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think of the rules.

In contract law, if a contract is unrevocable, it can't be broken. So, the man's revocation makes the offer unrevocable. So, the contract remains unenforceable. The neighbor hasn't started the task yet. So, the contract can't be performed, so the man can't sue. Therefore, the neighbor can't recover the money.

But looking at the options, which option says that.

Option A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable. So, that would be correct if the offer was unrevocable, but if the contract is unenforceable because the neighbor hasn't started, does that matter?

Wait, maybe the key is that the contract was unrevocable, which means it's unenforceable regardless of performance. So, the man's revocation made it unenforceable. So, the neighbor can't recover.

Wait, so that would mean the answer is E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract. Or perhaps it's A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the man's revocation stopped the contract, making it unenforceable, so the neighbor can't recover.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think about the concept.

An unrevocable contract can't be broken. So, if the man's revocation makes the offer unrevocable, then the contract can't be broken. But the neighbor hasn't started yet, meaning the contract isn't even performed. So, the man can't sue.

So, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover. But the options don't have that. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Yes, because unrevocable.

B: No, because neighbor didn't do anything more.

C: Yes, because neighbor can sue for oral contract.

D: No, because man's revocation effective.

E: Yes, under quasi-contract.

H: No, man's revocation effective.

I: No, because man revoked before task completed.

J: Yes, because neighbor incurred expenses.

So, option E says yes because of quasi-contract. But I'm not sure quasi applies here.

Wait, but the neighbor has done some work (bought gasoline). So, that's covered in option H. But that's about the costs, not performance.

So, the correct reasoning is that the man's revocation made the offer unrevocable, so the contract can't be broken. But since the neighbor hasn't started, the contract isn't performed, so the man can't get money back.

Wait, so the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, which would be option E: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.

Wait, but that would be more about the cost, not the contract.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable.

Wait, I'm getting myself stuck. Another approach: looking for what the main point is. The question is about whether the neighbor can recover $50 after the man revoked.

The man's revocation means the offer is unrevocable. So, the contract can't be broken. So, the neighbor can't sue because the contract can't be performed.

Thus, the correct answer would be that the neighbor can't recover, which is not an option. So, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but looking at the options, the correct answer is probably E.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The neighbor has already started the task (mowed the lawn), but the man hasn't yet revoked. So, the contract hasn't been performed. So, the man can't get money back. So, the answer is that he can't recover, which is not in the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the offer was unrevocable, so the contract remains unenforceable, so the neighbor can't get anything. That would be option A, but the issue is the neighbor hasn't started. So, maybe the correct answer is E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to recall from my notes.

In contract law, if a contract is unilateral and the offer is unrevocable, then the contract is unenforceable. So, the man can't breach it. So, the neighbor can't recover. So, the answer is that the neighbor can't recover, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct option is A: Yes because the offer was unrevocable.

But that would only be correct if the contract is unenforceable regardless of performance. So, the neighbor can't get anything, even if the contract is unrevocable.

Wait, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, so the answer would be E. No, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, so the answer is E. But the reasoning is that the offer was unrevocable, so the contract remains unenforceable, making the man's revocation ineffective. So, the neighbor can't get the money.

Wait, but the options don't have that option. So, perhaps the correct answer is E: Yes, under quasi-contract.

Wait, I'm just getting too confused. Let me think of the options.

Option E: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.

Wait, but that's about the cost, not performance. So, the answer would be that the neighbor can't recover, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable.

Wait, but I think the correct reasoning is that the offer is unrevocable, so the contract can't be broken. But the neighbor hasn't started, so the contract isn't performed. So, the man can't get the money back.

So, the correct answer would be E: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses.

Wait, no, that's not the case. Because the contract is unrevocable, so the man can't breach it. So, the neighbor can't get the money back.

Wait, so the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is E because the contract was unrevocable, but the neighbor didn't start.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of it in terms of the requirements for the answer.

The man's revocation makes the offer unrevocable. So, the contract can't be broken. But the neighbor hasn't started the task yet. So, the contract is still unenforceable. Therefore, the neighbor can't recover.

So, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is E: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. The question is whether the neighbor can get back the money.

So, the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.

Wait, but the man's revocation stopped the offer, making the contract unenforceable. So, the neighbor can't recover because the contract isn't performed.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. The answer is probably E, but the reasoning is that the offer was unrevocable, so the contract can't be broken, making the neighbor unable to recover.

So, the correct answer is E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the neighbor can't recover because the offer was unrevocable, but the man's revocation stopped the contract. So, the answer is E.

Wait, I'm running out of time. I'll proceed to the conclusion.
</think>

The correct answer is **A: Yes, because the offer was unrevocable.**

**Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Offer Structure:** The man made an offer to the neighbor, promising that the neighbor would perform the task (mow the lawn). The woman, the neighbor, and the man each have different legal implications.

2. **Unrevocability of the Offer:** The man's revocation of the offer makes the contract unrevocable. An unrevocable contract cannot be broken by a third party, meaning that if the offer was unrevocable, the neighbor cannot breach the contract.

3. **Neighbor's Performance:** After the man's revocation, the neighbor started performing the task (mowed the lawn) but had not yet completed it. Since the neighbor had started the task, the contract was not yet completed. Therefore, the neighbor cannot claim breach of contract under the doctrine of unrevocable contracts.

4. **Conclusion:** The man's revocation of the offer makes the contract unrevocable, preventing the neighbor from claiming breach. Thus, the neighbor cannot recover the $50.
