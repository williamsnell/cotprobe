Okay, I need to figure out the generators of the additive cyclic group Z. Hmm, wait, Z is the set of all integers, right? So, it's an infinite cyclic group. I remember that in a cyclic group, a generator is an element that can produce every element in the group through its multiples. But since Z is infinite, the generators are the elements that can generate all integers by adding or subtracting them.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, in additive cyclic groups, generators are elements of the form n where n is the generator. So, for example, 1 is a generator because every integer can be written as 1 multiplied by some integer. Similarly, -1 would also generate all integers because multiplying it by -1 gives all integers as well. So both [1, -1] and [ -1, 1 ] would be generators in an additive group.

But wait, the group is written as Z. So, the elements are integers, and the operation is addition. So, any element 'a' in Z is a generator if the subgroup generated by 'a' is the entire group Z. For the additive group of integers, the only such elements are 1 and -1 because any other integer would generate a finite subgroup. So the possible generators are elements like 1, -1, 2, -2, etc., but wait no— wait, 2 can't generate all integers because 2n can only be even integers. So the generators are the elements that are units in the integers, meaning their absolute value is 1. So, 1 and -1 are the only generators for Z as a cyclic group.

Wait, but wait, the options given are A through J. Let me look at the options.

Option A: [1,-1] — that's the pair (1, -1). Option B: [1,0], which is 1. Option C: [0,2], which is 2. D: [ -1,1 ]— same as A. E: [0,1] is 1. F: [2,0] is 2. G: [0, -1] is -1. H: [3,-3] is 3. I: [2,-2] is 2. J: [1,2] is 3.

So, in the context of Z, which is the additive group, the generators would be elements that can generate the entire group. So, only 1 and -1 are generators. So options B, D, G, and E are all 1 or -1. So, B is [1,0], which is 1. D is [-1,1], which is -1. Similarly, E is [0,1], which is 1, and G is [0,-1], which is -1. So, all of these would be generators.

Wait, but the question is about the additive cyclic group Z. So, the generators are 1 and -1. So the correct options are those that represent 1 or -1 as single elements, not as pairs. Looking back at the options, the options that are single elements (like B, D, E, G) are correct. So, the correct answer should be any of B, D, E, G.

But wait, the question is asking which of the options are generators. So each option is a pair. So does that mean each option represents a generator as a pair? For example, [1,0] is 1, which is a generator. So any of the options B, D, E, G would be generators. But wait, the question is a multiple-choice question with options A to J, and each is a pair. So, the correct answer would be any of B, D, E, G.

Wait, but the question is asking "generators of the additive cyclic group Z." So for the additive group Z, the finite cyclic group case would have only 1 and -1 as generators, but since Z is infinite, those are the only generators. So the correct options are those that represent 1 or -1 as single elements, but in the options, they are represented as pairs. So which of the options are single elements?

Looking at the options:

B: [1,0] — that's 1, which is a generator.

D: [-1,1] — that's -1, a generator.

E: [0,1] — that's 1, a generator.

G: [0,-1] — that's -1, a generator.

So, the correct options are B, D, E, G.

Wait, but the question asks for the generators. So, the answer is any of these. But wait, the options are single elements, so which ones are possible.

Wait, but the question is, "what are the generators of the additive cyclic group Z?" So, the group Z is infinite cyclic. Therefore, the generators are 1 and -1. So the options that are single elements 1 or -1 would be the correct ones. So options B, D, E, G are correct.

Wait, but the options are given as pairs. So the question is, for each option, is it a generator of Z? So, for example, option B is [1,0], which is 1, so yes, it's a generator. Option D is [-1,1], which is -1, also a generator. Option E is [0,1] which is 1, another generator. Option G is [0,-1], which is -1, another generator.

So, the correct answer would be any of these options. But since the options are listed with letters, perhaps the question is multiple choice and expects the correct letters, but each option is a pair. Wait, no, the options are each a pair, but in the context of the question, each option represents a generator. So, for the question, the correct options are those that are single elements (1 or -1), but all the options that are single elements are B, D, E, G. But looking at the options, perhaps the question is asking which of the listed options is a generator.

Wait, no. The question is about the additive cyclic group Z. So, the possible generators are 1 and -1. So the correct options (B, D, E, G) are the correct answer. So, the user is to choose all correct options. But in the setup, the user is to select one option. But looking at the options, any of B, D, E, G would be correct.

Wait, but wait the options are A through J, each a pair. So, the question is, which of the listed pairs is a generator. So, each of these is a single element, but each option is a pair.

Wait, but the question is about the additive cyclic group Z. So, in Z, which is infinite, the only generators are 1 and -1. So, the correct options are those that are [1,0], [-1,1], [0,1], or [0,-1]. So, looking at the options, the correct options are B, D, E, G.

But the question is, what are the generators of the additive cyclic group Z? Looking at the answer options, which ones are possible.

Wait, the options are:

A: [1, -1]

B: [1,0]

C: [0,2]

D: [-1,1]

E: [0,1]

F: [2,0]

G: [0,-1]

H: [3,-3]

I: [2,-2]

J: [1,2]

So, the possible correct options are B, D, E, G.

So, the answer would be any of these. But the way the question is phrased, perhaps the correct answer includes all of them? But since the options are given as single elements, perhaps the question is to pick all the possible answers, but the user is to select one letter.

Wait, but the question is in the format where each option is a pair. So, perhaps the question is, which of these options is a generator. So, the correct options are B, D, E, G.

But since the options are given in the format of single pairs, perhaps the question expects all of them. But in the multiple-choice options, each is a separate option. So perhaps the correct answers are B, D, E, G.

But the way the user presents the question, the options are A through J, each a pair. So, perhaps the user is to select the correct letter(s), but in the format of a single letter.

Wait, but the question says, "What are the generators...", so the correct answer is any of B, D, E, G.

But looking at the options, the user is to choose from A to J, each a pair. So, the correct answers are B, D, E, G. So, the user must choose all of them. But in the context of the question, the user is to select the correct letter(s). So the answer options are letters from A to J, each a pair. So, the correct letters are B, D, E, and G.

But in the given options, only B, D, E, G are the correct single elements that are generators. So, the user must choose those.

The additive cyclic group Z consists of all integers under addition, and its generators are 1 and -1, as they can generate every integer through their multiples. In the context of the provided options, the correct generators are those that represent 1 or -1 as single elements. 

- **B: [1, 0]** represents 1, a generator.
- **D: [-1, 1]** represents -1, another generator.
- **E: [0, 1]** represents 1, a generator.
- **G: [0, -1]** represents -1, a generator.

Thus, the correct options are B, D, E, and G.

ANSWER: B, D, E, G
