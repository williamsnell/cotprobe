Okay, so I have this question about why common stocks or bonds are considered more liquid assets than an automobile. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but let me think this through.

First, I need to understand what liquid assets are. From what I remember, liquid assets are those that can be easily converted into cash without incurring a lot of additional costs. So, if something is liquid, it means someone can buy it, sell it, and get the cash they need quickly.

The question is comparing common stocks and bonds to a car. So, why are stocks and bonds more liquid than a car?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Automobiles depreciate faster. I think that's the opposite of what we're trying to find. If cars are depreciating faster, their value goes down more, which doesn't make them more liquid. Because if you lose value quickly, you might not need to sell them to get cash.

Option B: Stocks and bonds are physically smaller. Well, I know that stocks are like shares in a company, and bonds are like debt. Each stock or bond has a certain size, but I'm not sure if being smaller makes them more liquid. Maybe smaller size doesn't directly correlate with liquidity. I'm not certain about this one, but I'm leaning towards it not being the main reason.

Option C: Automobiles are more expensive. Wait, that's the opposite of what we want. If they're more expensive, they're less liquid. For example, if a car is expensive, you might need to wait longer to sell it and get cash. So, this option is probably not the right answer.

Option D: Highly efficient and fast markets exist for stocks and bonds. Oh, this seems more likely. I remember that markets are efficient in the sense that information is quickly reflected in asset prices. So, when you buy stocks or bonds, information about their performance is known, so you can buy and sell them quickly. On the other hand, a car's value might take longer to appreciate because it's a tangible asset, not as liquid. So the efficient and fast markets make stocks and bonds more liquid.

The correct answer is **D: Highly efficient and fast markets exist for stocks and bonds**. 

- **A**: Incorrect, as depreciation of cars makes them less liquid.
- **B**: Incorrect, while smaller physical sizes don't directly correlate with liquidity.
- **C**: Incorrect, as expensive cars are less liquid.
- **D**: Correct, because efficient markets allow quick conversion to cash.

Answer: D
