Question:

A law school advertised in various law journals for a legal ethics and jurisprudence professor. Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, "Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. " The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. "When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12. The dean responded, "I'm sorry, but there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. "The applicant asserted a claim against the law school for breach of contract. The applicant offers to introduce evidence that during his telephone conversation with dean of faculty, the dean promised, if necessary, to provide him with additional sick days. The most accurate statement concerning the dean's oral promise would be that

Options:

A: parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.
B: parol evidence is admissible to prove the written contract was a mistake.
C: parol evidence is admissible to show the dean's personal guarantee of additional sick days.
D: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract was void due to lack of consideration.
E: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove any oral agreements made prior to the signing of the written contract.
F: parol evidence is admissible to show that the applicant misunderstood the terms of the contract.
G: parol evidence is admissible to prove the dean coerced the applicant into signing the contract.
H: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable, because of undue influence or fraud.
I: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding parol evidence and whether a contract can be enforced. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The scenario is about a law school hiring an ethics professor. The dean offers them a position with a specific salary and sick leave policy. The applicant, despite wanting more sick days, declines and the dean says he'll handle it if needed. Now, the applicant files a claim against the school for breach of contract.

The issue here is whether the written contract is enforceable. The question is specifically about parol evidence and whether the contract is valid. The options are about whether the written contract is enforceable, whether the contract is a mistake, personal guarantees, etc.

I remember that in contract law, the enforceability of a contract is often tied to whether it's clear and unambiguous. Parol evidence is used to show that both parties agreed to the contract only in a specific situation, but it doesn't show that the contract was made in the general sense. So, it's not admissible to prove that the parties assented to the contract as a whole, just that they did so under certain conditions.

Looking at the options:

A: Parol evidence is admissible to show that parties assented to their contract only as a partial integration. I think this is correct. Parol evidence is for showing that the parties agreed under specific circumstances, not the entire contract.

B: Parol evidence is admissible to prove the contract was a mistake. No, I don't think so. Parol evidence isn't used to prove a mistake, which would be more about the contract being invalid for something else.

C: Parol evidence to show the dean's personal guarantee. Parol evidence is about specific instances, not personal promises. So this seems incorrect.

D: Parol evidence to show the contract is void due to lack of consideration. Parol evidence isn't used to determine if consideration exists. That would be more about the issue of consideration, which is under the rule of law, not contract law.

E: Parol evidence inadmissible for showing prior oral agreements. Wait, I thought that if the parties have already made oral agreements, the parol evidence is not used. But in this case, the contract was made in writing, so the prior agreements were in writing, so maybe E is not correct. Or wait, E says it's inadmissible to show prior oral agreements that contradict the written contract. Hmm, but the key here is that the written contract was made, so prior oral agreements are not relevant to the enforceability of the contract. So E might not be correct.

F: Parol evidence to show the applicant misunderstood the contract terms. Parol evidence is about agreement under specific circumstances, not about misunderstanding. So F is incorrect.

G: Parol evidence to show the contract was coerced. Parol evidence is about agreement, not coercion. So G is incorrect.

H: Parol evidence showing the contract is enforceable due to undue influence or fraud. No, again, parol evidence is about agreement, not about influence or fraud. So H is incorrect.

So the only correct option is A. That is, parol evidence is admissible to show that parties assented to the contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.

The correct answer is A: parol evidence is admissible to show that parties assented to their contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.

Explanation:
- Parol evidence is used to show that parties agreed to the contract under specific circumstances, not the entire contract. It does not prove that the contract was made in the general sense.
- The other options are incorrect because parol evidence does not address consideration, lack of influence, coercion, or the validity of the contract.
- Therefore, the correct statement is that parol evidence is admissible to show that parties assented to their contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.
