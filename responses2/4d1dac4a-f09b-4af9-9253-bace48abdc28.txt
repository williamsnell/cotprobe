Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about a patient's defense mechanism. Let me read it again carefully.

The scenario is a 14-year-old girl who's a 14-year-old, and her mother learned she's having sexual intercourse with various partners. She doesn't use condoms or contraception, which is concerning. Her mother is worried about her behavior. The parents separated 3 months ago, and she's had some issues since then. She's been an honor student and excelled in school before the separation. Now, since separation, she's been sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She's also started smoking, doesn't follow curfew, and is truant from school.

The question is asking which defense mechanism the patient is using. The options are A to J, with each representing a different psychological defense.

I'm a bit rusty on defense mechanisms, so let me think. The main types I know are Denial, Rationalization, Projection, and others like Displacement, Displacement of Thought, Displacement of Feeling, etc. Wait, some of these might be part of a broader set.

So, the patient is being handled by her mother, who is worried about her behavior. She's starting to show signs of being rebellious and defiant. She's acting out, which I think is Denial. Denial is when someone stops trying to understand or accept the situation, perhaps choosing to act out or display behavior instead.

Another possibility is Displacement of Thought. That's when someone shifts from one thought to another, losing the original. But Denial is more about not understanding, whereas Displacement might involve changing the mental state. However, sometimes Denial can be a result of displacement if the person is not fully accepting their situation.

But the patient's immediate issue is her behavior, so Denial might be the immediate defense. She's not following curfew, smoking, being truant, which are all pretty serious behaviors. Her parents were apart, but she's been having sex since the separation. Her mother is worried about that, so she's trying to figure out how to handle her child's behavior.

She's been an honor student, which suggests she's proactive and maybe not as passive. But now she's showing rebellion. So maybe she's trying to avoid responsibility by acting out, which is Denial. Or perhaps she's trying to not have any effect on her child, but that's more about control.

Wait, Denial is when someone stops thinking about the situation and acts on it. So if the mother is worried about her child's behavior, she might act out, which is Denial. She doesn't need to be holding back; she just needs to act on her fear.

Alternatively, maybe it's Displacement of Thought because she's not accepting her situation as it is. She's acting out because she's not understanding why she's being handled this way. But Denial is more about not thinking about it.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think Denial is the more immediate response. She's not trying to control her child but to address her own behavior. So Denial would be the answer, which is option G.

Wait, let me think again. The options are G: Denial and F: Rationalization. Denial is about not understanding and acting, while Rationalization involves shifting the focus from the situation to a positive outcome.

Since the situation is about her behavior being handled, Denial makes sense. She's being held responsible for her behavior, so she acts out. She's not seeking a solution, just a response to her mother's concern. So the answer is G.
</think>

The patient's behavior can be best explained by Denial, as she acts out in response to her mother's concern about her actions. Denial involves stopping the internal focus and acting on the situation, which aligns with the patient's immediate response to her mother's worry about her child's behavior.

Answer: G
