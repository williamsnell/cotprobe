Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about the Richardson-Self debate on hate speech. I remember that there's a famous debate between these two scholars about the nature of hate speech. Let me think through this.

The question is about what Richardson-Self argue about sexist speech. The options are A through J. I'll go through each one step by step.

First, I recall that Richardson-Self's argument is that sexist speech is hate speech. They probably don't consider it hate speech, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe they do, depending on the context.

Option A says that sexist speech can never be considered hate speech regardless of context. That doesn't sound right because I think some contexts might still qualify as hate speech.

Option B claims it's never hate speech because it's free expression. Free expression is a broad term, but hate speech is a specific type of expression that conveys harmful intent. So B doesn't seem correct.

Option C: It's always hate speech because it doesn't involve violence. This contradicts what I know. I think the opposite—女性的言辞如果是针对男性，或者带有歧视意味，那么它可能不算是 hate speech.

Option D: It's not always hate speech because it doesn't involve violence. Hmm, this makes sense because if the speech doesn't involve violence, it might not be considered hate speech. But I'm not sure about the details.

Option E: It's always hate speech because it involves violence. No, that's the opposite. If it doesn't involve violence, it's not hate speech.

Option F: It's not hate speech because it's protected under freedom of speech. The freedom of speech allows for hate speech, so I think F is incorrect.

Option G: It's always hate speech because it promotes gender inequality. This seems to align with what I remember. Richardson and Self probably agree that gender inequality speech is hate speech.

Option H: It's only hate speech when it directly incites violence. That sounds like self-interested reasoning, not the main argument. Their main point is that it's hate speech regardless of intent.

Option I: Can be considered hate speech when it promotes discrimination. Yes, that's a specific case. They argue that such speech is hate speech regardless of whether it incites violence, as long as it conveys discrimination or inequality.

Option J: It's not always hate speech because it always involves violence. No, that's the opposite of what I've read. They don't think it's always hate speech.

Putting it together, the correct answer should be G and maybe I. But since the question says "which statement," and the options are singular, I think the key point is that they argue it's hate speech because it promotes gender inequality, regardless of whether it incites violence. So option G is correct. Option I is more specific about discriminative speech, but G covers both cases.

The correct answer is G: "Is always hate speech because it promotes gender inequality." This aligns with Richardson-Self's argument that gender inequality speech is hate speech, whether it incites violence or merely conveys discrimination.

Answer:
G
