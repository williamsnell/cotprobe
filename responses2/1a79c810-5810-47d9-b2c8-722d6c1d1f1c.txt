Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about which of the given entities is a state. The options are A through H, and the question is asking which one is a state. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to remember what defines a state. From what I recall, a state is a country within the United Nations. It's a country with its own government, borders, and a recognized status as a sovereign state. So, any entity listed here that's a country and has such a status would be a state.

Looking at the options:

A: American Samoa. I think that's a territory, not a state. It's a group of islands, but it's not recognized as a state.

B: Hong Kong. Wait, Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. I believe it's not a state in the traditional sense because it's part of the People's Republic of China, which is a country. But sometimes, Hong Kong is referred to as a state, but technically, it's more of a regional government area.

C: Gibraltar. I'm pretty sure Gibraltar is a province of Spain. It's not a state but a province within a country.

D: Greenland. I remember Greenland has its own government, much like China. It's a country, so it's a state.

E: Puerto Rico. This is a territory in the United States, not a state. It's a part of the U.S. and doesn't have independent sovereignty.

F: Bermuda. That's a territory in the Caribbean. It's not recognized as a state; it's just a group of islands without independent sovereignty.

G: Antarctica. That's a continent, not a country or a state. It's a large landmass, but it's not a state.

H: Egypt. Egypt is a country with its own government. I think it's recognized as a state.

So, the entities that are states are D (Greenland) and H (Egypt).
