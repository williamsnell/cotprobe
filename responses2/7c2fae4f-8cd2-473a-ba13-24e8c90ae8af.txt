Okay, so I have this question about coloring the faces of a cube with three colors, considering rotations. I remember that when counting colorings up to symmetry, Burnside's lemma is often used. Let me try to recall how that works.

Burnside's lemma says that the number of distinct colorings is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each group action. The group here is the rotation group of the cube, which has 24 elements. That's because a cube has 6 faces, and each can be on top, and then 4 rotations around that axis, so 6*4=24.

So the formula would be (1/24) multiplied by the sum of the number of colorings fixed by each of the 24 rotations.

Hmm, I think the cube's rotation group can be broken down into different types of rotations: identity, 90-degree rotations, 180-degree rotations, 120-degree rotations, etc. Each type of rotation would fix a certain number of colorings.

Let me categorize the rotations:

1. Identity rotation: This does nothing. Every coloring is fixed by it. So the number here is 3^6, since each of the 6 faces can be colored in 3 ways. 3^6 is 729.

2. 90-degree and 270-degree rotations around axes through centers of opposite faces. There are 6 such axes (since a cube has 3 pairs of opposite faces, but each axis allows two directions, 90 and 270, which are distinct). Wait no, actually, each pair of opposite faces defines an axis, and for each axis, there are two nontrivial rotations: 90° and 270°. So that's 6 axes * 2 rotations each = 12 rotations. Wait no, actually, no, the cube has 3 axes through opposite faces, each with two nontrivial rotations (90 and 270). So 3 axes * 2 rotations = 6 rotations of 90 and 270 degrees each. Each such rotation fixes no colorings because no face is fixed. Wait, no, wait: for a 90-degree rotation, the four side faces cycle. So for a coloring to be fixed, all four side faces must be the same color. But since we have only three colors, and the top and bottom are fixed, but the side faces rotate, each would have to be the same color. So the top and bottom can be any color, but the four sides must all be the same. So how many fixed colorings here?

So for each 90 or 270-degree rotation, the number of fixed colorings is 3 (for top) * 3 (for bottom) * 3 (for the four sides, which must all be the same) = 3^3 = 27. Each such rotation fixes 27 colorings.

So for the 6 rotations (3 axes, 2 rotations each), each contributes 27 fixed colorings. So 6*27 = 162.

3. 180-degree rotations around face axes: Each face axis gives a 180-degree rotation. These rotate pairs of opposite side faces. So for each such rotation, the top and bottom are fixed, but the front and back swap, left and right swap. So the front and back must be the same color, left and right must be the same, but top and bottom can be any color. So the number of fixed colorings is 3 (top) * 3 (bottom) * 3 (front=back) * 3 (left=right) = 3^4 = 81. Each of these 6 rotations (3 axes, each with one 180-degree rotation) contributes 81 fixed colorings. So 6*81=486.

4. 120-degree and 240-degree rotations around axes through opposite vertices. Each such axis allows for two nontrivial rotations: 120° and 240°. There are 4 such axes (since a cube has 4 space diagonals, each connecting two opposite vertices). Wait, wait, no: the number of axes through opposite vertices is 4, each with two rotations (120 and 240). Wait, actually, no. A cube has 4 space diagonals, so each axis is defined by two opposite vertices. So 4 axes, each with two rotations (120 and 240), so 8 rotations in total.

Wait no, wait, 4 axes (each through a pair of opposite vertices?), but I think that's correct. So 4 axes, each with two rotations, so 8 rotations.

For each such rotation, how many colorings are fixed? The rotation cycles three faces around one vertex and three faces around the opposite vertex. So for a coloring to be fixed, the three faces around the first vertex must all have the same color, and the three around the opposite vertex must have the same color. So each set must be monochromatic, but there's no restriction on the top and bottom, or the two sets. So the number is 3 (for the first set) * 3 (for the second set) * 3 (for top) *3 (for bottom) = 3^4=81. So each of these 8 rotations fixes 81 colorings. So 8*81=648.

Wait, but wait, no, the rotation is about a vertex, so maybe the cycle is different. Let me think again. Each such rotation will fix a set of three faces around each of the two opposite vertices. So for a given 120° rotation, the cube is partitioned into two cycles of three faces each. So each cycle must be the same color. So the top and bottom can be any color. Hmm, so the number is 3 (for each set of three face cycles) times 3 (top) times 3 (bottom). So 3^4=81. So 8 rotations, each contributes 81 colorings, so 8*81=648.

5. 180-degree rotations around edge axes. These axes go through the midpoints of opposite edges. Each such rotation swaps two pairs of opposite faces and also swaps the other two pairs. For example, imagine rotating 180 degrees around an axis that goes through the midpoints of the front-top and back-bottom edges. This swaps the front and back faces, and the left and right faces, while also swapping the top and bottom. Or wait, no, perhaps it's swapping front with back, left with right, top with bottom? No, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Wait, 180-degree rotation around an edge axis: perhaps it swaps front and back, and left and right, and top and bottom, but each pair is swapped. Wait, no, 180° rotation would swap front with back, left with right, top with bottom. So each of these pairs must be the same color for the coloring to be fixed. So the top, bottom, left, right, front, back all must be same color? No, wait: for the coloring to be fixed, each face must map to a face of the same color. So for front and back to be same, left and right same, top and bottom same. But each face can be any color. So the number of fixed colorings is 3^3 =3*3*3=27. Because front/back can be any color, left/right any, top/bottom any. So each 180-degree edge-axis rotation fixes 27 colorings. There are 6 such rotations (since each pair of opposite edges defines an axis, and there are 6 pairs of opposite edges in a cube). So 6 rotations *27=162.

Wait, wait, no. How many edge axes are there? I think for a cube, there are 6 axes through midpoints of opposite edges. Each axis allows for a 180-degree rotation. So 6 rotations in total.

So each contributes 27 fixed colorings. So 6*27=162.

Now, summing up all these contributions.

Identify the number of each type of rotation:

1. Identity: 1 rotation, fixes 3^6=729.

2. 90/270 face rotations: 6 rotations, each fixed 27 colorings. Total 6*27=162.

3. 180 face rotations: 3 rotations (wait, no, earlier I thought 6, but let me double-check). Wait no, wait: earlier I considered 6 face axes (each through opposite faces) with 2 rotations each (90 and 270). So 6 rotations, each fixed 27 colorings. So 6*27=162.

4. 120/240 vertex rotations: 8 rotations, each fixed 81 colorings. 8*81=648.

5. 180 edge rotations: 6 rotations, each fixed 27 colorings. 6*27=162.

Now, sum all these contributions: 729 + 162 + 162 + 648 + 162.

Let me calculate:

729 + 162 = 891.

891 + 162 = 1053.

1053 + 648 = 1701.

1701 + 162 = 1863.

Now, divide by the size of the group, which is 24.

1863 /24 = ?

Let me compute 1863 ÷ 24.

24 * 77 = 1848.

1863 - 1848 = 15.

So 15/24 = 0.625.

So 77.625, but since we're counting colorings, it must be an integer. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck each step.

Wait, the sum is 729 (identity) + 162 (90/270 face) + 162 (180 face) + 648 (120/240 vertex) + 162 (edge 180). So 729 + 162 = 891, +162 is 1053, +648 is 1701, +162 is 1863.

Now 1863 divided by 24.

Compute 24 × 77 = 1848. So 1863 -1848=15. So 77 and 15/24 = 77.625. That's not an integer. But Burnside's lemma says the number of distinct colorings is the average, which in this case must be an integer because the number of colorings is an integer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counts. Let me re-examine each category.

Wait, perhaps the counts for each type of rotation are wrong.

Let me think again. The rotation group has 24 elements. The categories I considered are:

- Identity: 1 element.

- 90 and 270 face rotations: 6 elements (3 axes, 2 rotations each).

- 180 face rotations: 3 elements (each axis has one 180 rotation).

Wait, earlier I thought 3, but perhaps 6? Or maybe 3 axes, each with two rotations (180 and 90?), no. Wait, for face rotations, we have:

- 90 and 270: 6 rotations (each of the 6 face axes contributes two nontrivial rotations).

- 180: 3 axes, each with one rotation, so 3 elements.

Wait, so the 180 face rotations are 3 elements, each contributing 81 colorings.

Then the vertex rotations:

- 120 and 240 rotations: each axis (4 axes) has two rotations, so 8 elements.

Each contributes 81 colorings.

Then the edge rotations:

- 180-degree edge rotations: 6 elements.

Each contributes 27 colorings.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the number of face rotations. Let me recheck each.

Identity: 1.

90 and 270 face rotations: 6.

180 face rotations: 3.

120 and 240 vertex rotations: 8.

180 edge rotations: 6.

So 1+6+3+8+6=24, correct.

So the contributions:

Identity: 3^6 = 729 → 729.

90/270: 6 *27=162.

180 face: 3*81=243.

120/240: 8*81=648.

180 edge: 6*27=162.

Sum:729 +162=891; 891+243=1134; 1134+648=1782; 1782+162=1944.

Wait, that's a different total: 1944. 1944 divided by 24.

1944 ÷ 24:

24 × 80 = 1920.

1944 -1920=24. So 80 +1=81. So 81.

So the total is 81.

Wait, that's a more reasonable number because the options don't have 81 as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A:81, B:45, etc. So 81 is option A.

But I thought the answer should be higher. Wait, did I make a mistake in counting the 180 face rotations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 180 face rotations. Let me think: each 180-degree rotation around a face axis. For example, if I rotate 180 degrees around the axis going through the top and bottom faces, what happens? The top and bottom are fixed. The four side faces are swapped in pairs. So front and back swap, left and right swap. So for the coloring to be fixed, front must be the same color as back, left same as right. But top and bottom can be any color. So the number is 3 (top) * 3 (bottom) *3 (front/back) *3 (left/right) = 3^4 =81. So each of the 3 face axes has 81 colorings fixed.

So 3 *81=243.

But then, in the earlier sum, 729 (identity) + 162 (90/270) + 243 (180 face) +648 (120/240) +162 (180 edge) = 729 +162=891; 891+243=1134; 1134+648=1782; 1782+162=1944. 1944/24=81.

So the answer is 81, which is option A.

But wait, I thought the answer was 30, but no, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, in the problem, the cube is colored with three colors, and considering rotations. So perhaps the number is 30? No, according to my calculation, it's 81.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the standard answer for cube colorings with 3 colors is 57 or something else. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial Burnside's calculation.

Let me recheck the calculations.

Identity: 729.

90/270 face rotations: 6 *27=162.

180 face rotations: 3 *81=243.

120/240 vertex rotations: 8 *81=648.

180 edge rotations:6 *27=162.

Sum:729 +162=891; +243=1134; +648=1782; +162=1944.

1944/24=81.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the number of 180 face rotations. Let me recount. How many axes are through opposite faces? There are 3 pairs of opposite faces: front-back, left-right, top-bottom. So 3 axes. Each contributes one 180-degree rotation. So 3 elements, each contributing 81 colorings. So 3*81=243.

So that's correct. So the sum is 1944, divided by 24, gives 81. So the answer is 81, option A.

Wait, but I remember that the correct answer for three colors on a cube is 30. Hmm, maybe I'm mistaken. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the count of 180 face rotations.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the 180-degree face rotations contribute more colorings. Let me think: Each 180-degree face rotation swaps pairs of opposite faces. For example, imagine a cube: top and bottom are swapped, front and back are swapped, left and right are swapped. So for the coloring to be fixed, the top and bottom must be the same color, front and back same, left and right same. So each pair can be any color, but the top and bottom are same, front and back same, left and right same. So the number is 3 (top) * 3 (bottom) * 3 (front) *3 (back) *3 (left) *3 (right) → Wait, no: each pair (top/bottom) must have same color. So top and bottom can be any color: 3 choices. Front and back can be any color: 3. Left and right: 3. So 3^3=27. So each 180 face rotation fixes 27 colorings, not 81. I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, that changes things. Because 180 face rotations would fix 27 each, not 81. So let me recalculate.

So 180 face rotations: 3 elements, each contributing 27.

So the sum becomes 729 (identity) +162 (90/270) +243 (180 face) +648 (120/240 vertex) +162 (180 edge) = 729 +162=891; +243=1134; +648=1782; +162=1944.

Again, 1944 /24=81.

Hmm, so that leads me back to 81.

But I thought the correct answer for three colors on a cube is 57, but perhaps I'm mixing it up with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the count of 180 face rotations. Let me think again: for each 180-degree face rotation, the top and bottom are fixed, but the four side faces are swapped in pairs. So for the coloring to be fixed, the front must equal back, left must equal right, top can be anything, bottom can be anything. So the number of colorings is 3 (top) *3 (bottom) *3 (front/back) *3 (left/right) = 3^4=81. So each 180 face rotation fixes 81, not 27.

So the sum is 729+162=891 +243=1134 +648=1782 +162=1944.

1944 /24=81. So the answer is 81.

But then, why do I think the correct answer is 57? Maybe I'm confusing it with the standard cube colorings with 2 colors, which gives 10, but with 3 colors, perhaps it's 81.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is 81, which would make option A correct.

But wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. The formula for the number of distinct colorings with n colors is (n^k + (n-1)*n^k + ... ) / |G|, but no. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the number of colorings fixed by each group element.

So according to Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct colorings is the average number of fixed colorings per group element.

In this case, the group has 24 elements, and the sum is 1944.

So 1944/24=81. So the correct answer is 81.

So the answer is option A:81.
</think>

To determine the number of distinct colorings of a cube with three colors, considering rotations, we apply Burnside's lemma. The cube's rotation group has 24 elements, categorized into types of rotations:

1. **Identity rotation (1 element):** Fixes all 3^6 = 729 colorings.

2. **90° and 270° rotations around face axes (6 elements):** Each fixes 27 colorings, contributing 6*27 = 162.

3. **180° rotations around face axes (3 elements):** Each fixes 81 colorings, contributing 3*81 = 243.

4. **120° and 240° rotations around vertex axes (8 elements):** Each fixes 81 colorings, contributing 8*81 = 648.

5. **180° rotations around edge axes (6 elements):** Each fixes 27 colorings, contributing 6*27 = 162.

Summing these contributions:

729 (identity) + 162 (90/270 face) + 243 (180 face) + 648 (120/240 vertex) + 162 (180 edge) = 1944.

Dividing by the group size (24):

1944 ÷ 24 = 81.

Thus, the number of distinct colorings is **81**, which corresponds to option **A**.

ANSWER: A
