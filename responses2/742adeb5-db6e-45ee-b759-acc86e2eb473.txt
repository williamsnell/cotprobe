Okay, so I've got this problem about a compound motor and torque variation. Hmm, I remember that compound motors have both a field current and a series armature current. Oh wait, and when the load changes, the armature current changes too, right?

The question says that the load is varying, so the armature current goes from 50 amp to 100 amp. The torque varies, and I need to find the ratio of the torques. The options are given, so I'll have to work it out.

The problem mentions that the series-field current causes the air-gap flux to change by 3 percent for each 10 amp of armature current. Wait, what's the series-field current? Oh right, the series-field current is the current supplied by the armature windings alone, opposing the field current. The field current is the current through the field poles, which creates the magnetic field.

So, when the armature current increases, the series-field current adjusts to maintain a certain flux. The flux change is 3% per 10A of armature current. So for each 10A, the flux changes by 3%.

Wait, the flux is the product of the number of poles, the area, and the magnetic flux density. The flux (φ) is proportional to I_a / I_f, where I_a is armature current and I_f is field current. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: the flux is proportional to the armature current, but also depends on the field current. Oh right, the flux is given by something like φ = K I_a, where K is a constant that depends on the pole count and the magnetic properties. But in this problem, they say that for each 10A of armature current, the flux changes by 3%. Or wait, the flux change is 3% per 10 A of armature current. Hmm, so it's a linear relation.

Wait, the flux change is 3% per 10A of armature current. So, when the armature current increases by 10A, the flux increases by 3%. Or maybe decreases? Let me make sure. The problem states it's a varying load requiring a variation in armature current. So as the armature current increases, the flux would decrease, right? Because the field current is fixed, so more armature current means less flux. But the problem says the flux changes by 3% for each 10A. So perhaps the flux is changing with armature current.

Wait, maybe another approach: The air-gap flux is changing with the armature current. So when the armature current changes, the flux in the air gap changes, which affects the torque. The torque in a compound motor is given by the product of torque constant (K_t) and the armature current (I_a). So Torque ∝ I_a. But wait, the torque equation for a compound motor is T = K_t (I_a - I_f), because the field current I_f is fixed. Wait, no. Wait, in a compound motor, the torque is proportional to the armature current. Because the torque is K_t (I_a - I_f), but I_f is fixed. So if I_f is fixed, then the torque is proportional to I_a.

So torque T is proportional to I_a. But wait, the problem is about the ratio of torques at two different currents. So the ratio would be (I_a2 - I_f) / (I_a1 - I_f) ? No, wait, no. Because I_f is fixed, so the torque ratio is I_a2 / I_a1. But wait, that's only if I_f is the same. But wait, no, because the flux is changing, so perhaps I_f is changing as well. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. It says that the load is varying, so the armature current varies. The load requires a variation in armature current, from 50 to 100. So as the armature current increases, the flux in the air gap changes. So the flux change is 3% for each 10A of armature current. So for each 10A, the flux changes by 3%.

Wait, the flux is changing, but the torque equation for a compound motor is T = K_t (I_a - I_f). But since I_f is fixed, the torque is proportional to (I_a - I_f). So the torque ratio would be (I2 - I_f) / (I1 - I_f) ) = (I2/I1) if I_f is the same.

But in this problem, the flux is changing because the armature current is changing, which in turn causes the flux to change. So when I_a increases, the flux (which is proportional to I_a) changes by a certain percentage, which affects the torque.

Alternatively, perhaps we're supposed to model the flux change in terms of the armature current. Let me consider the flux change. The problem says, "the air-gap flux changes by 3 percent for each 10 amp of armature current"—so for each 10A in I_a, the flux φ increases or decreases by 3%.

Wait, but in a compound motor, the flux is given by φ = (K) I_a. Or is it φ = K (I_a - I_f)? No, I think the flux is the same as the flux in the field, which is proportional to I_f minus I_a, but that doesn't make sense because if I_a increases, flux would decrease. Wait, perhaps I should think that the flux is given by φ = K (I_f - I_a). Because when I_a increases, φ decreases.

But the problem states that the flux changes by 3% per 10A of armature current. So for each 10A increase in I_a, the flux changes by 3%. So when I_a increases by 10, flux decreases by 3% (assuming the flux is proportional to (I_f - I_a)).

So, let me model the flux as a function of I_a. Let’s say that the flux change is 3% per 10A. So, for each 10A, flux φ changes by 3%. So if I_a increases by 10, then φ decreases by 3%, which is 0.03 * (I_a).

Wait, but the change in flux is given. So for each 10A, the flux changes by 3%. So the flux φ can be written as φ = φ0 * (1 - (I_a / I0)), where I0 is some base current and φ0 is the flux at that current. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to model the change in flux as a linear function.

Wait, perhaps a more precise approach: The flux (φ) is given by φ = K * (I_f - I_a), since I_f is the field current and I_a is the armature current. So the flux is inversely proportional to I_a. Because, as I_a increases, φ decreases.

But the problem says that for each 10A of armature current, the flux changes by 3%. So the flux change is 3% of the current flux when I_a increases by 10A. Let's formalize this.

Let’s take I_a as a variable. The flux φ is given by φ = φ0 * (I_f - I_a) / I0, where I0 is the initial current, and φ0 is the initial flux. Wait, perhaps not the best way. Alternatively, perhaps the flux is proportional to (I_f - I_a) because when I_a increases, φ decreases.

But the problem states that for each 10A of armature current, the flux changes by 3%. So let's model that. Let's say that when I_a increases by 10A, the flux changes by 3%. But the direction of change depends on whether I_a is increasing or decreasing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the flux as a function of I_a. Let's denote the flux change as delta_phi = 0.03 * phi when I_a increases by 10A.

Let me think of the flux as a function of I_a, and the change in flux when I_a increases by 10A is 3% of the flux at the initial I_a.

Wait, perhaps for simplicity, the flux change is 3% per 10A. So, for each 10A increase in I_a, the flux decreases by 3%.

So, the flux at I_a is φ = φ0 (1 - (0.03 * I_a) / 10 ) = φ0 (1 - 0.003 I_a ). Wait, because for each 10A, the flux decreases by 3%, which is a 0.3% per A. Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, 3% per 10A is 0.3% per A. So for each A, 0.003% change in flux. So when I_a increases by 10A, the flux decreases by 0.03.

So, the flux at I_a is:

φ = φ_initial - (0.03) * (I_a - I_initial) / 10 * φ_initial ?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the flux is φ_initial (1 - (0.03 * (I_a - I_initial)) / 10 ), but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe a better approach is to find the flux change in terms of I_a.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in flux is given by delta_phi = 0.03 * phi_initial when I_a increases by 10A. So for any I_a, the flux is φ = K (I_f - I_a), where K is a constant. So K = phi_initial / (I_f_initial - I_a_initial).

Wait, maybe I should instead model the flux as a linear function, considering that the flux changes 3% per 10 A of armature current. So, for every 10 A increase in I_a, the flux decreases by 3%.

So, let's model the flux change as: delta_phi = -0.03 * phi when I_a increases by 10 A.

Wait, but the initial flux at I_a is phi_initial. So, when I_a increases by 10, the flux phi becomes phi_initial - 0.03 * phi_initial = 0.97 phi_initial.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux change is proportional to the change in I_a. Let me think in terms of a linear equation for the flux.

The flux is a linear function of I_a, such that for every 10A increase, the flux decreases by 3%. So, the slope of the flux as a function of I_a would be delta_phi / delta_I_a = (-0.03 phi_initial) / 10 A.

But wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach. Let's say that the flux at armature current I_a is given by φ = φ_initial * (1 - (I_a / I_initial) * 0.03), where I_initial is the initial armature current. Because for each 10A, flux decreases by 3%. So, for I_a=I_initial, φ=φ_initial, and for I_a= I_initial +10, φ=φ_initial * (1-0.03)=0.97φ_initial.

So the flux is φ = φ_initial (1 - 0.03 (I_a - I_initial) / 10 )?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me write it as:

The flux decreases by 3% when I_a increases by 10A. So for a 10A increase, flux decreases by 3% of its initial value.

So, for any I_a, the flux can be expressed as:

phi = phi_initial * (1 - (0.03 * (I_a - I_initial)) / 10 )

Wait, but wait, when I_a increases, the flux should decrease. So:

When I_a increases by 10A, phi decreases by 3%:

delta_phi = -0.03 * phi_initial.

So, delta_phi = phi_initial (1 - (I_a + 10) / I_initial ) - phi_initial (1 - I_a / I_initial ) = phi_initial ( -10 / I_initial )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a linear function.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux can be modeled as phi = phi_initial - (3/100) * (I_a - I_initial) * phi_initial.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let's think: when I_a increases by 10, phi decreases by 3%. So for each unit increase in I_a, phi decreases by 0.3%. So for an increase of delta_A in I_a, delta_phi = -0.03 * phi_initial * (delta_A /10 ) * 100? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the flux is proportional to (I_f - I_a). So phi = K (I_f - I_a).

Then, when I_a increases by delta_A, the flux decreases by 3% for each 10 units of delta_A. So:

delta_phi = -0.03 * phi_initial * (delta_A / 10 )

So, delta_phi = -0.003 phi_initial * delta_A.

But phi_initial is K (I_f - I_a_initial ), so:

delta_phi = -0.003 * K (I_f - I_a_initial ) * delta_A.

But delta_phi is also equal to (phi_initial - phi) = K (I_f - I_a_initial ) - K (I_f - I_a_initial - delta_A ) = K (delta_A )

So setting these equal:

K (delta_A ) = -0.003 K (I_f - I_a_initial ) delta_A

Divide both sides by K delta_A (assuming K and delta_A are non-zero):

1 = -0.003 (I_f - I_a_initial )

So, 1 = -0.003 (I_f - I_a_initial )

Which implies I_f - I_a_initial = -1 / 0.003 = -333.333

Wait, that can't be right because if I_f is the field current, and I_a_initial is the initial armature current, their difference would be negative if I_f is lower than I_a_initial. Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the direction of the flux change.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is phi = K (I_f - I_a ), and when I_a increases, phi decreases. So delta_phi = -0.03 * phi_initial * (delta_A / 10 )

Wait, let's think numerically. Suppose I_a increases from I_a_initial to I_a_initial + delta_A. The flux decreases by 3% of its initial value.

So:

phi_initial (1 - 3% ) = phi_initial (1 - 0.03) = 0.97 phi_initial.

But, delta_phi = phi_initial - 0.97 phi_initial = 0.03 phi_initial.

But delta_phi = (I_a_initial + delta_A - I_a_initial ) * K, because delta_phi = (delta_A) * K.

Wait, phi_initial = K (I_f - I_a_initial ) = 0.97 phi_initial?

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let's try an alternative approach.

Let’s say that the flux in the air gap is proportional to (I_f - I_a ), so phi = k (I_f - I_a ), where k is a constant.

The problem states that when I_a increases by 10A, the flux decreases by 3%.

So, when I_a increases by 10A, phi decreases by 3% of its initial value.

So,

phi_initial = k (I_f - I_a_initial )

phi_after = phi_initial - 0.03 * phi_initial = 0.97 phi_initial.

But phi_after is also equal to k (I_f - (I_a_initial +10) ) = 0.97 k (I_f - I_a_initial )

So,

k (I_f - I_a_initial ) * 0.97 = 0.97 k (I_f - I_a_initial )

Wait, this doesn't make sense because left side would be 0.97 phi_initial, and the right side is 0.97 phi_initial, so they are equal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the flux change is a function of I_a. Let me think of it this way: the flux change is proportional to I_a, but the problem says it's 3% change per 10A.

Wait, perhaps the flux is given by phi = phi_initial * (1 - (I_a / I_initial) * 0.03 ), where I_initial is the initial armature current. So for any I_a, the flux is 0.97 times the initial flux when I_a increases by 10A.

Wait, if I_a increases by 10A, the flux is 0.97 * phi_initial.

So for armature current I, the flux is phi = phi_initial * (1 - (I - I_initial) * 0.003 )

Wait, why 0.003? Because 3% per 10A is 0.03% per A, which is 0.0003 per A, but perhaps I'm mixing up the percentages.

Wait, 3% per 10A is 0.3% per A. So, for 10A change, phi decreases by 3% of initial value.

So for any delta_A in I_a, phi decreases by 0.03 * phi_initial * (delta_A /10 )

Wait, perhaps the change in flux is delta_phi = -0.03 * phi_initial * (delta_A /10 )

So, delta_phi = -0.003 * phi_initial * delta_A.

But delta_phi = (I_a_initial + delta_A - I_a_initial ) * K = K delta_A.

So, K delta_A = -0.003 phi_initial * delta_A.

Canceling delta_A (assuming delta_A ≠ 0), we get K = -0.003 phi_initial.

Wait that can't be right because K is supposed to be a constant, and if K is negative, that would imply that the flux is negative, which doesn't make sense in this context. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Let me write again:

delta_phi = phi_initial - phi_after = phi_initial - (phi_initial * (1 - 0.03 )) = 0.03 phi_initial.

But delta_phi is also equal to (I_a_initial + delta_A - I_a_initial ) * K = delta_A * K.

So, delta_A * K = 0.03 phi_initial.

But phi_initial = K ( I_f - I_a_initial ), so:

delta_A * K = 0.03 * K ( I_f - I_a_initial )

We can cancel K (assuming K ≠ 0):

delta_A = 0.03 ( I_f - I_a_initial )

So, I_f - I_a_initial = delta_A / 0.03.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this helps me find the ratio of torques when I_a changes from 50 to 100.

Wait, let's think about the torque equation again. Torque T is given by:

T = K_t ( I_a - I_f )

But I_f is a constant, so when I_a is at two different values, the ratio of their torques is (I_a2 - I_f ) / (I_a1 - I_f ) = [ (I_a2 - I_f) / (I_a1 - I_f) ]

Wait, but in this problem, the flux is changing because I_a is changing. So perhaps I_f is changing as well, which complicates things.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's model the flux as a function of I_a, then model the torque, then find the ratio.

The flux phi is given by the formula phi = K (I_f - I_a ), where K is a constant that depends on the number of poles and the magnetic properties.

The torque T is given by T = K_t (I_a - I_f )

But K_t is a constant. So, the torque is proportional to (I_a - I_f ). So, the ratio of torques is (I2 - I_f ) / (I1 - I_f ) = (I2/I1) * (1 - I_f / I1) ) / (1 - I_f / I2 )

Wait, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the torque in terms of the flux.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the torque equation again. The torque in a compound motor is T = K_t (I_a - I_f ), where I_f is the field current. So, the torque is directly proportional to (I_a - I_f ). So, when I_a increases, the torque increases, but I_f is fixed. So, the ratio of torques at two different I_a values is (I2 - I_f ) / (I1 - I_f ) = (I2/I1) [ (1 - I_f/I2 ) / (1 - I_f/I1 ) ] )

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the ratio of (I2 - I_f) to (I1 - I_f) by considering the flux change.

Wait, given that the flux changes by 3% for each 10A increase in I_a, perhaps I can model the flux as a function of I_a. Let's say that when I_a increases by 10A, the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value.

So, for each 10A increase, the flux is multiplied by 0.97.

Wait, but this would model a multiplicative decrease, which might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the flux is a linear function of I_a, but with a certain slope.

Wait, maybe the flux is given by phi = phi_initial * (1 - 0.03 (I_a - I_initial ) / 10 ), where I_initial is the initial armature current. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is given by phi = phi_initial (1 - (I_a / I_initial) * 0.03 )

Wait, let's try that. Let's model the flux as phi = phi_initial - 0.03 phi_initial (I_a / I_initial )

Wait, that would be phi = phi_initial (1 - 0.03 ), which is 0.97 phi_initial when I_a increases by 10A. But that ignores the fact that the flux is a function of I_a, not just a linear term.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is modeled as phi = phi_initial - (0.03) (I_a - I_initial ), but that doesn't make sense either.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's model the flux as a function of I_a. So, phi = phi_initial (1 - (I_a / I_initial) * 0.03 )

Wait, but this again only accounts for the flux being a linear function, which may not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the flux change as a function of I_a. So, for each 10A increase in I_a, the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value. So, for any I_a, the flux is:

phi = phi_initial * (1 - 0.03 * (I_a - I_initial) / 10 )

But I'm not sure if this is the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the flux is given by:

phi = phi_initial * (1 - 0.03 (I_a - I_initial) / 10 )

But I'm not confident about this.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to consider that the flux is inversely proportional to the armature current. Because when I_a increases, the flux decreases. So, let me model phi as:

phi = phi_0 * (1 - a I_a )

where a is a constant.

Now, when I_a increases by 10A, the flux decreases by 3%, so:

phi_new = phi_0 (1 - a (I_a + 10) ) = phi_0 (1 - a I_a -10a ) = phi_0 (1 - a I_a ) (1 - 10a )

But according to the problem, the flux decreases by 3% when I_a increases by 10A, so:

phi_new = phi_0 (1 - 0.03 )

So,

(1 - 10a) = 0.97

So,

10a = 0.03 => a = 0.003

So, the flux equation is phi = phi_0 (1 - 0.003 I_a )

Wait, but when I_a increases by 10A, the flux decreases by 3%, which matches the problem statement. So this seems to be correct.

So, now, the flux is known as a function of I_a. So, the flux at armature current I_a is phi = phi_0 (1 - 0.003 I_a )

But what is phi_0? It's the flux at I_a = 0. So, phi_0 = phi(0) = phi_0 (1 - 0) = phi_0. So, that doesn't help, but perhaps I can express the torque in terms of phi_0.

Wait, now, the torque T is given by T = K_t ( I_a - I_f )

But I_f is the field current. So, perhaps I can find I_f in terms of phi_0 and I_a.

Wait, but the problem is that I don't know I_f. Hmm, perhaps I can model I_f as a function of I_a, considering that the flux is inversely proportional to I_a.

Wait, earlier we determined that phi = phi_0 (1 - 0.003 I_a )

So, phi = K ( I_f - I_a ) = K ( I_f - I_a )

But K is a constant, so:

K ( I_f - I_a ) = phi_0 (1 - 0.003 I_a )

So, K I_f = phi_0 (1 - 0.003 I_a ) + K I_a

Hmm, but without knowing K, I can't find I_f. Alternatively, perhaps I can express I_f in terms of K and phi_0.

But perhaps that's not the way to go. Let's think about the torque in terms of flux.

Wait, torque T = K_t ( I_a - I_f )

Let me express I_f in terms of I_a and phi_0.

From earlier, we have phi = K ( I_f - I_a )

And K = phi_0 (1 - 0.003 I_a ) / ( I_f - I_a )

Wait, but this seems circular. Alternatively, perhaps we can express I_f as:

I_f = I_a + phi / K

But without knowing K, maybe it's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can express the torque in terms of phi. Since phi = K ( I_f - I_a ), then K = phi / ( I_f - I_a )

So, T = K_t ( I_a - I_f ) = K_t * ( I_a - I_f )

But K is phi / ( I_f - I_a )

So,

T = ( K_t ( I_a - I_f ) ) = ( K_t * ( I_a - I_f ) )

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to find the ratio of torques when I_a changes from 50 to 100.

So, T1 = K_t (50 - I_f )

T2 = K_t (100 - I_f )

So, the ratio T2 / T1 = (100 - I_f ) / (50 - I_f )

But I don't know what I_f is. So, I need to find I_f in terms of K_t and K.

Wait, perhaps I can find I_f from the flux equation.

From the flux equation, phi = K ( I_f - I_a )

But, from earlier, phi = phi_initial (1 - 0.003 I_a )

So,

K ( I_f - I_a ) = phi_initial (1 - 0.003 I_a )

But, phi_initial = K ( I_f_initial - I_a_initial )

Hmm, but without knowing I_a_initial, perhaps this is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that when I_a increases, the flux decreases. So, perhaps when I_a is 50, the flux is some value, and when it's 100, it's another value.

But perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me try to think of the problem differently. Let's consider that the torque is proportional to (I_a - I_f ), which is proportional to (I_a - I_f ) = (I_a - I_f).

Wait, perhaps instead, the torque can be written as T = K_t (I_a - I_f ), and since I_f is fixed, the ratio of T at 50 and 100 is (50 - I_f)/(100 - I_f).

But I don't know I_f. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find I_f using the flux equation.

From the flux equation, phi = K ( I_f - I_a )

But we also have, from the torque equation, T = K_t (I_a - I_f )

So, let's express I_f from the flux equation:

I_f = (phi / K ) + I_a

Substitute into the torque equation:

T = K_t (I_a - (phi / K ) - I_a ) = K_t ( - phi / K )

So, T = - K_t phi / K

Hmm, but this suggests that the torque is proportional to the negative flux. But the earlier torque equation suggests that torque is proportional to (I_a - I_f ), which is (I_a - I_f ) = (I_a - I_f ), which is the same as -(I_f - I_a ). So, perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong.

Wait, but if I_f is the field current, then when I_a increases, if the field current decreases, the armature current will cause a torque. Hmm, perhaps I should think about this again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when I_a is higher, the flux is lower. So, for example, when I_a is 50 A, the flux is phi_50 = K ( I_f - 50 )

Similarly, when I_a is 100 A, the flux is phi_100 = K ( I_f - 100 )

But from the problem statement, when I_a increases by 10 A, the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value. So, let's take I_a_initial as 50 A, then I_a becomes 60 A, but wait, that's not matching the problem statement.

Wait, the problem statement says that varying the load from 50 to 100 A changes the load on the armature, and the flux changes accordingly. So, the flux is a function of I_a, and when I_a increases, the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value when I_a increases by 10A.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when I_a increases by 10A, the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value when I_a was 50A.

So, when I_a is 50A, the flux is phi_50 = K ( I_f - 50 )

When I_a is 60A, the flux is phi_60 = K ( I_f - 60 )

And according to the problem statement, when I_a increases from 50A to 60A (a change of 10A), the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value. So,

phi_60 = phi_50 (1 - 0.03 )

So,

K ( I_f - 60 ) = K ( I_f - 50 ) (1 - 0.03 )

Cancel K (assuming K ≠ 0):

I_f - 60 = (I_f - 50 ) (0.97 )

Expand:

I_f - 60 = 0.97 I_f - 48.5

Subtract 0.97 I_f from both sides:

I_f - 60 - 0.97 I_f = -48.5

Combine like terms:

0.03 I_f -60 = -48.5

Add 60 to both sides:

0.03 I_f = 11.5

So,

I_f = 11.5 / 0.03 = 383.333... A

Wait, that seems quite high. Let me check the calculations.

So, from the equation:

I_f -60 = 0.97 (I_f -50 )

So,

I_f -60 =0.97 I_f -48.5

Subtract 0.97 I_f from both sides:

I_f -60 -0.97 I_f = -48.5

Which simplifies to:

0.03 I_f -60 = -48.5

Add 60 to both sides:

0.03 I_f = 11.5

So,

I_f = 11.5 / 0.03 = 383.333 A

Hmm, that's a very high field current. Let me verify if this is correct.

So, the flux at I_a = 50 A is:

phi_50 = K ( I_f -50 ) = K (383.333 -50 ) = K (333.333 )

At I_a = 60 A, the flux is:

phi_60 = K ( I_f -60 ) = K (383.333 -60 ) = K (323.333 )

According to the problem, when I_a increases by 10A (from 50 to 60), the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value. So, the initial flux at 50 A is phi_50 = K (333.333 ), and the new flux is phi_60 = phi_50 * (1 - 0.03 ) = 333.333 K * 0.97 ≈ 323.333 K, which matches our calculation. So, this seems correct.

So, I_f = 383.333 A.

Now, back to the problem of finding the ratio of torques when I_a increases from 50A to 100A.

So, T1 = K_t (50 - I_f )

T2 = K_t (100 - I_f )

So, the ratio T2/T1 = (100 - I_f ) / (50 - I_f )

Plugging in I_f = 383.333 A,

T2/T1 = (100 - 383.333 ) / (50 - 383.333 )

= (-283.333 ) / ( -333.333 )

= 283.333 / 333.333 ≈ 0.85

But wait, that's approximately 5/6, since 283.333 is about 3/4 of 333.333.

Wait, 333.333 * (5/6 ) = 277.777, which is less than 283.333, so 283.333 / 333.333 ≈ 0.85 or 17/20.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it exactly.

So,

(100 - 383.333 ) = -283.333

(50 - 383.333 ) = -333.333

So, the ratio is (-283.333 ) / (-333.333 ) = 283.333 / 333.333 = 283.333 / 333.333.

Calculating that:

283.333 ÷ 333.333 = (283.333 × 1000 ) ÷ (333.333 × 1000 ) = 283333 ÷ 333333 ≈ 0.85.

But let me calculate it exactly.

283.333 ÷ 333.333 = 283.333 ÷ 333.333 = 0.85 exactly.

Wait, 0.85 is 17/20, which is 0.85 exactly.

So, the ratio is 17/20.

So, the torque ratio is 17:20, which is 0.85.

Wait, but when I think of the problem, perhaps I should have considered that when I_a increases, the torque increases, but perhaps in this case, it's the opposite.

Wait, no, because the torque is proportional to (I_a - I_f ). So, when I_a increases, if I_f is fixed, torque increases.

Wait, but in this problem, I_f is 383.333 A, which is higher than the initial I_a of 50 A. So, for I_a=50, torque is (50-383.333 )= -333.333, which is negative. Hmm, perhaps this indicates that when I_f is higher than I_a, the torque is negative, which might indicate that the field current is higher than the armature current, leading to a torque that opposes the armature current change.

Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

But in any case, the ratio of the torques is (100 - I_f )/(50 - I_f ) = (100 - 383.333 )/(50 - 383.333 ) = (-283.333)/(-333.333 )= 283.333/333.333= 0.85.

So, the ratio is approximately 0.85, which is 17/20.

Wait, but let's make sure that the calculation is correct.

So, I_f = 383.333 A.

So, T1 = K_t (50 - 383.333 ) = K_t (-333.333 )

T2 = K_t (100 - 383.333 ) = K_t (-283.333 )

So, T2 / T1 = (-283.333 ) / (-333.333 ) = 283.333 / 333.333 ≈ 0.85.

Alternatively, 283.333 divided by 333.333:

Let me compute it:

283.333 ÷ 333.333.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 283333 ÷ 333333.

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD (which is 333333 ÷ 333333 = 1, I think).

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as:

283333 ÷ 333333.

We can write this as (283333) / (333333) = 0.85.

Wait, because 333333 × 0.85 = 283333.05, which is approximately 283333. So, 0.85 is a close approximation.

So, the ratio is 0.85, or 17/20.

So, the ratio of torques when the load increases from 50A to 100A is 17:20.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

So, I_f = 383.333 A.

So,

T1 = K_t (50 - 383.333 ) = K_t (-333.333 )

T2 = K_t (100 - 383.333 ) = K_t (-283.333 )

So,

T2 / T1 = (-283.333 ) / (-333.333 ) = 283.333 / 333.333.

Which is approximately 0.85.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating I_f. Let me recheck that part.

Earlier, I set up the equation:

I_f -60 = 0.97 (I_f -50 )

So,

I_f -60 = 0.97 I_f - 48.5

Subtract 0.97 I_f from both sides:

I_f -60 -0.97 I_f = -48.5

Which simplifies to:

0.03 I_f -60 = -48.5

Add 60 to both sides:

0.03 I_f = 11.5

So,

I_f = 11.5 / 0.03 = 383.333 A.

Hmm, that's correct.

So, the calculations seem correct.

Thus, the ratio of the torques is approximately 0.85, or 17/20.

So, the answer is 17:20.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

So, I_f = 383.333 A.

So, T1 = K_t (50 - 383.333 ) = K_t (-333.333 )

T2 = K_t (100 - 383.333 ) = K_t (-283.333 )

So,

T2 / T1 = (-283.333 ) / (-333.333 ) = 283.333 / 333.333 ≈ 0.85.

So, the ratio is approximately 0.85, which is 17/20.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects an exact fraction. Let me compute 283.333 / 333.333 exactly.

We can compute it as 283.333 / 333.333 = (283.333 × 1000 ) / (333.333 × 1000 ) = 283333 / 333333.

Now, let's compute 283333 ÷ 333333.

We can compute the division as:

333333 × 0.85 = 333333 × 0.8 + 333333 × 0.05 = 266666.4 + 16666.65 = 283333.05.

So, 333333 × 0.85 = 283333.05, which is just a bit more than 283333.

So, 0.85 is an approximate value. But the exact value is 283333 ÷ 333333.

Let me see if it's a repeating decimal or a fraction.

Wait, 283333 ÷ 333333 is approximately 0.85, but let me check if it's a known fraction.

Wait, 283333 ÷ 333333 = 17/20? Let's check.

17 ÷ 20 = 0.85.

But 283333 is 17 × 16666.7142857 approximately, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me check 283333 ÷ 333333.

If I perform the division, 333333 into 283333:

Well, 333333 is bigger than 283333, so we put a 0., and add a decimal point.

Now, 333333 into 2833330 (add a zero) → 2833330 ÷ 333333.

Hmm, that's 8.5, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 333333 × 8 = 2666664.

333333 × 8.5 = 2666664 + (333333 × 0.5 ) = 2666664 + 166666.5 = 2833330.5.

Wait, but 2833330 is very close to 2833330.5, but we're trying to find 2833330 ÷ 333333.

Wait, this is getting too involved, perhaps it's better to accept that the ratio is approximately 0.85, which is 17/20.

So, the final answer is 17:20.
</think>

The ratio of the armature current (I_a) when the load is increased from 50 A to 100 A is calculated as follows:

1. **Determine the field current (I_f):**

   From the problem statement and the given data, when I_a increases from 50 A to 60 A, the flux decreases by 3% of its initial value. Using the relationship:

   \[
   I_f = \frac{11.5}{0.03} = 383.333 \, \text{A}
   \]

2. **Calculate the torques (T1 and T2):**

   - For I_a = 50 A:
     \[
     T_1 = K_t (50 - 383.333) = K_t (-333.333)
     \]

   - For I_a = 100 A:
     \[
     T_2 = K_t (100 - 383.333) = K_t (-283.333)
     \]

3. **Find the ratio of the torques (T2/T1):**

   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{-283.333}{-333.333} = \frac{283.333}{333.333} \approx 0.85
   \]

   This simplifies to the ratio \(17:20\).

**Answer:**

The ratio of the armature current when the load increases from 50 A to 100 A is \(\boxed{17:20}\).
