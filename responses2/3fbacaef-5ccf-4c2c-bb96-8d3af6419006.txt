Question:

A defendant was prosecuted for murder. At trial, the prosecutor called a police detective to testify. The detective, who questioned the defendant at the station house after his arrest, testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence. The detective further testified that when given the opportunity to take a lie detector test, the defendant refused. The defendant's attorney did not object to the detective's testimony. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to prison. The defendant, who is now represented by a new attorney, appeals, claiming that it was error to admit the detective's testimony. The appellate court should find

Options:

A: plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.
B: no error, because the defendant refused the lie detector test, implying guilt
C: harmless error, because the defendant's statements were admissions.
D: harmless error, because the defendant's refusal to take the lie detector test was relevant information for the jury.
E: harmless error, because the defendant was given the opportunity to defend his statements
F: harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.
G: plain error, because the detective's testimony was hearsay
H: plain error, because the defendant was not read his rights prior to the questioning
I: no error, because the detective's testimony was valid evidence
J: plain error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.

Okay, so I have this question about a plain error or hearsay issue. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The setup is a murder trial where the prosecution called a police detective to testify. The detective testified that the defendant initially declared innocence and refused a lie detector test. The defendant's attorney didn't object, and they were convicted. Now, the defendant is appealing, claiming the detective's testimony was error. They're asking what the appellate court should decide.

First, I need to understand the elements of plain error and hearsay. Hearsay is when someone else's statement is offered without permission, and it's not admissible as evidence. Plain error is when the statement is admitted without permission, but the content is true.

In this case, the defendant's attorney didn't object to the detective's testimony. The defense is saying that the detective's testimony is plain error because it's hearsay when it's offered for the first time, but the content is true.

Wait, but the defense's argument is that the defendant's refusal to take the lie detector test implies guilt, which would mean the defense's evidence was relevant. Alternatively, maybe the defense's initial declaration of innocence is hearsay because the defendant was under the impression but later lied.

So the defense says that the lie detector test was taken by the defendant, which is hearsay because it's offered without permission. However, the defense claims that the refusal to take the test implied guilt, meaning the statement was true.

But the issue is whether the defense's initial declaration of innocence is hearsay, and whether the detection test is hearsay. 

In evidence law, the initial declaration of innocence would be hearsay unless it's a declaration by the defendant that the matter is beyond belief. But wait, the defense's initial statement of innocence might not be hearsay if it's based on the defendant's lack of belief or trust in the defense. But I think that's more about whether the statement is under the defendant's own knowledge or not.

Wait, the prosecution called a police detective to testify. So the initial statement is made by the defense. The defense's attorney didn't object, so the witness could have testified. But the defense is arguing that the statement of innocence is hearsay, and the defense's refusal to take the lie detector test is hearsay. But the defense is pointing out that the lie detector test was taken, which is hearsay.

Wait, but the defense's initial declaration of innocence is not hearsay if it's based on the defendant's lack of belief. But I think the defense is using the lie detector test as evidence, and the fact that the defendant refused to take it is hearsay. But the defense's initial statement of innocence might not be hearsay if it's not the defendant's own statement. Or is it?

Wait, the defense's initial statement of innocence is not hearsay as a matter of law if it's based on the defendant's lack of belief or trust. But in this case, the defense's attorney didn't object to the statement, so the witness could have testified. But the defense is saying that the lie detector test was taken, which is hearsay, which the defense is using to claim that the initial statement was false.

Alternatively, perhaps the defense is using the lie detector test as evidence to show the defendant's guilt. Because if the defendant refused the lie detector test, that's hearsay, so the defense is claiming that the lie detector test was taken, which is hearsay because the defendant's statements were made without permission. So the defense is presenting the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay.

But does the defense have the right to present that as evidence? Because the defendant's initial declaration of innocence is hearsay, and the lie detector test is also hearsay. But since the defense is saying that the initial statement was false, does that mean they're presenting hearsay as evidence to attack the defense's initial statement?

Wait, no. The defense is using the lie detector test as evidence to show that the defendant's initial statement of innocence was false. So the defense is using the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay. But the defense's initial statement is a declaration of innocence, which they say is based on the defendant's lack of belief.

But the defense's argument is that the lie detector test was taken, which is hearsay, and since the defense is presenting that as evidence, which is hearsay, but the defense's own initial statement is also hearsay, the defense is trying to bring about a conclusion that the initial statement is false, making it a plain error.

Wait, but in the case of plain error, the issue is whether the statement is admitted without proper permission, and whether the content is true. So the defense's initial statement of innocence is hearsay. The defense's refusal to take the lie detector test is hearsay. The defense is using that as evidence to show that the initial statement was false. So the defense's statements are both hearsay, so the defense is presenting hearsay in an attempt to attack the defense's initial statement, which is also hearsay.

In this scenario, the defense's initial statement of innocence is hearsay because it's based on the defendant's lack of belief. But the defense's argument is that the lie detector test was taken, which is hearsay, so the defense is trying to prove that the initial statement was false.

But the issue is whether the defense's statements are hearsay when offered for the first time. Because the defense's statements were made without permission, the initial declaration is plain error. But if the defense is presenting the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay, then the defense's argument is that the initial statement is hearsay, and the lie detector test is hearsay, so it's not admissible.

Wait, but if the defense is arguing that the lie detector test is hearsay because it's offered without permission, then the defense's argument would be that the lie detector test is not admissible as evidence. So the defense would be presenting the lie detector test as a hearsay element, but since it's offered as evidence, which is hearsay, that would mean the defense's argument is that the lie detector test is hearsay and thus not admissible.

Alternatively, since the defense is saying that the initial statement was false, does that mean they're presenting hearsay as evidence to attack the defense's initial statement, which is also hearsay. So perhaps the defense's initial statement is hearsay because it's based on the defendant's lack of belief. But if the initial statement is hearsay, and the defense is presenting the lie detector test as evidence, which is another hearsay statement, then they're both presenting hearsay.

In this scenario, the defense is using the lie detector test as evidence to show that the initial statement of innocence was false. So the defense is presenting two hearsay statements, which might be relevant, but perhaps it's not admissible.

Wait, but the defense is trying to bring about a conclusion that the initial statement was false, making it a plain error. So the defense's argument is that the initial statement is plain error because it was offered without permission, but the content is true, so it's a plain error.

Alternatively, perhaps the defense is correct in claiming it's plain error because the initial statement was made without permission, but the content is true, so it's plain error.

So the options are:

A: plain error, because the trial court should have ordered reference to the lie detector test. But the trial court's decision was that the witness was called, and the defense is appealing, so the trial court's order to reference the lie detector test is the issue.

Wait, the trial court may have already ordered the witness to test, but in the question, the witness is the detective. So perhaps the trial court allowed the witness to testify, and the defense is now appealing.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize this.

When a witness is called for their testimony, the witness is given the opportunity to take a lie detector test. The witness is then called if they refuse to take it. If the witness refuses, the defense can object if they object to the lie detector test. But in this case, the defense didn't object. So the witness was called.

But the defense is now appealing, claiming that the witness's testimony (the lie detector test) was admitted without permission, which would be plain error. So the defense's argument is that the initial statement of innocence was plain error because it was offered without permission, but the content is true.

So the defense's initial statement is hearsay because it was offered without permission. But the defense is claiming that the lie detector test was also offered without permission. Wait, no. The defense's initial statement is the one they're challenging. The lie detector test is another statement, but perhaps the defense is using it as evidence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the rules regarding the initial statement of innocence and the lie detector test.

In the initial statement of innocence, the defendant is asserting that the matter is beyond belief. That's not hearsay because it's based on the defendant's own knowledge or the absence of belief, not hearsay.

But if the defense is using the lie detector test as evidence, that's hearsay. So the defense is presenting the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay, but the defense's initial statement is not hearsay. Therefore, the defense is presenting hearsay (the lie detector test) as evidence, which is not allowed. Thus, the defense is making a mistake by trying to present the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay.

Wait, but the defense is not presenting the lie detector test as evidence; they're using it to test the initial statement. So if the lie detector test was taken and the defense is using it to show that the initial statement was false, that would be presenting the lie detector test as evidence. So the defense is presenting the test as evidence, which is hearsay, so the defense is providing evidence that the initial statement was false, which is an error.

But the defense's initial statement is not hearsay. So the defense's argument is that they're using the lie detector test (hence, hearsay) to attack the initial statement (not hearsay). Since the lie detector test is hearsay, and the defense is using it to present evidence that the initial statement is false, the defense is in error because they're introducing hearsay as evidence.

Wait, but the initial statement is not hearsay, so the defense is trying to use the lie detector test (hence hearsay) to attack it. That's a plain error because the initial statement was made without permission, and the content is true.

So the defense is making an error by presenting the lie detector test as evidence. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the defense's testimony is plain error because it's hearsay, but the initial statement is not, so the defense is mistakefully introducing hearsay.

Wait, but the defense is presenting the lie detector test as evidence. So the lie detector test is hearsay. The defense's initial statement is not hearsay. So the defense's argument that the lie detector test was taken (hence, hearsay) is flawed because the defense is using it as evidence. Wait, but the defense is introducing the lie detector test as evidence. So it's hearsay. Therefore, the defense's argument is that they're presenting hearsay as evidence, which is not allowed.

So the defense is making a mistake by presenting the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay. Therefore, the defense is in error, and the error is plain error because the initial statement was offered without permission.

But wait, the initial statement was not hearsay, but the lie detector test is. So perhaps the defense is introducing hearsay (the lie detector test) as evidence, which is not allowed. Therefore, the defense is mistaken in their approach, leading to a plain error.

So the defense's argument is that the lie detector test was taken (hence, it's hearsay), and the defense is presenting that as evidence, which is not allowed. Therefore, the defense is in error and is mistakenly using hearsay, so the error is plain error.

Looking at the options, option A says plain error because the trial court should have ordered reference to the lie detector test. But the trial court's decision was that the witness was called, but the defense is appealing. So the trial court's decision to allow the witness to testify would have been okay, but the defense is now challenging it.

Wait, no. The trial court's decision to call the witness and let them testify was made. The defense is now appealing and bringing up the lie detector test. So the trial court should have ordered the witness to take the lie detector, but the defense's argument is that the witness was called, and the lie detector test is hearsay, so they're introducing it as evidence.

Alternatively, the defense is arguing that the initial statement is plain error because it was offered without permission, but the content is true. So the defense is introducing hearsay as evidence (the lie detector test), but the initial statement is not.

Wait, no, the defense's argument is that the lie detector test was taken (hence, it's hearsay), but they are using it as evidence. So the defense is presenting the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay. Therefore, the defense's argument is that the lie detector test is hearsay, and thus, they're introducing it as evidence, which is error.

Therefore, the error is plain error because the initial statement was offered without permission, and the content is true. So the defense's argument is incorrect because they're introducing hearsay as evidence, which is not allowed. So the error would be plain error.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial statement is not hearsay, so the defense is presenting the lie detector test (hence, hearsay) as evidence, which is an error. So the error is that the lie detector test is hearsay, but the defense is presenting it as evidence, which is not allowed.

Wait, but the initial statement is not hearsay, so the defense is presenting the lie detector test (hence, hearsay) as evidence, which is an error because the defense is introducing hearsay. So the error is that the lie detector test is hearsay, and the defense is using it as evidence, which is not allowed.

So the error is a plain error because the initial statement was offered without permission (so plain error), and the content is true. Therefore, the defense's argument is wrong and they're introducing hearsay as evidence, which is an error.

So looking at the options, option A says plain error because the trial court should have ordered reference to the lie detector. But the trial court's decision was to allow the witness to testify, and the defense is appealing. So the trial court's decision to let the witness testify was correct, but the defense is bringing up the lie detector test as evidence.

Wait, but the defense is now challenging their own testimony, not the witness's. So the trial court may not have ordered the witness to test. Alternatively, the defense is bringing up the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay, so the error is that they're introducing it as evidence.

So the error is that the lie detector test is hearsay and thus not admissible, so the defense's argument is that they're introducing it as evidence, which is an error.

In that case, the error would be a plain error because the initial statement was offered without permission (plain error), and the defense is presenting the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay, so they've made a mistake by introducing hearsay.

So the options are:

A: plain error, because the trial court should have ordered reference to the lie detector test.

But I'm not sure if the trial court should have ordered it. The question is about the defense's appeal, so perhaps it's about the witness's testimony, not the defense's.

Wait, the defense's argument is that the lie detector test was taken, which is hearsay, and the defense is presenting it as evidence. So the defense's argument is that they're using the lie detector test as evidence, which is a hearsay error.

So the error is that the lie detector test is not admissible as evidence, so the defense's testimony is error. Therefore, the error is a plain error because the initial statement was offered without permission.

So option A would be the correct answer, as the trial court may have allowed the witness to testify, but the defense is now bringing up hearsay.

Wait, perhaps the trial court allowed the witness to testify, but the defense is now bringing up the lie detector test as evidence, which is hearsay. So the defense's argument is that they're introducing hearsay, hence plain error.

Alternatively, perhaps the defense is correct in using the lie detector test as evidence, making it plain error, because the lie detector test is hearsay.

So now, looking at the options:

Option A: plain error because the trial court should have ordered the reference.

Option B: No error because the defense's refusal was to take the test, implying guilt.

Wait, no, the defense's refusal to take the lie detector test implies guilt, which suggests that the lie detector test was taken, but that's hearsay. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Hidesay, which is correct, but if the initial statement is not hearsay, then it's not a problem.

Option D: Hidesay, but the defense's initial statement is not hearsay.

Option E: Hidesay, but the defense's initial statement is not hearsay.

So, the correct answer is A: plain error because the witness was allowed to testify, and the defense's argument is that the lie detector test is hearsay and thus error.

Wait, but wait. The defense's initial statement was not hearsay, but the lie detector test is. The defense is using the lie detector test as evidence of the initial statement. So the defense is presenting the lie detector test (hence hearsay) as evidence of the initial statement (not hearsay). So the defense is introducing hearsay as evidence, which is not allowed. Therefore, the error is that the lie detector test is a hearsay, and the defense is using it as evidence, which is plain error.

So the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, if the initial statement is not hearsay, but the lie detector test is, then the defense is presenting hearsay as evidence of a non-hearsay statement. But that doesn't make sense because the initial statement is not hearsay. Therefore, the defense's argument that the lie detector test is hearsay and thus error is correct. So the error is plain error because the lie detector test is hearsay, and the defense is introducing it as evidence, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is A: plain error, because the witness was allowed to testify, and the defense's argument is that the lie detector test is hearsay and thus error.
</think>

The defense's argument is flawed because the lie detector test is hearsay, and the defense is presenting it as evidence of the initial statement of innocence. The initial statement of innocence is not hearsay because it is based on the defendant's lack of belief or trust, not hearsay evidence. Therefore, the defense is introducing hearsay as evidence, which violates the plain error doctrine. The correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
