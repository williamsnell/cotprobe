Okay, so I've got this optics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that an object is placed 20 inches from a lens, and the virtual image is formed 10 inches from the lens. I need to find the focal length and the type of lens. The options are A to J, with various focal lengths and types.

Hmm, I remember that for lenses, there are a few formulas to work with. The one that comes to mind is the lens equation, which is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.

Wait, but there's also the sign conventions. I think that depends on whether the lens is converging or diverging. For a converging lens, both object and image are on the same side (real images are formed on the opposite side if the object is real and the lens is converging). But wait, wait, no, for a converging lens, real images are formed on the opposite side of the object, so both object and image are on opposite sides. But wait, in this case, the image is virtual. Oh right, virtual images are formed on the same side as the object. So that must mean the lens is diverging. Because a converging lens can't form a virtual image; it only forms real images on the opposite side.

So the lens is definitely a diverging lens. So any options where the lens type is converging are invalid. Looking at the options, A, B, C, D, etc. Let me scan them:

A: -20in, diverging → diverging, correct.
B:5in, converging → no, diverging.
C:10in, diverging → diverging, but is the focal length positive or negative? Because for diverging, the focal length is negative, right.
D:20in, converging → no, it's diverging.
E:30in, converging → nope.
F:-15in, converging → no, converging, but focal length is negative. That's not possible because diverging lenses have negative focal length.
G:-30in, diverging → yes, that's a diverging lens.
H:-10in, diverging → same as G, diverging, but what's the focal length? It would be negative.
I:-10in, converging → no.
J:-5in, diverging → yes, diverging, but focal length is negative.

Wait, but wait. The lens equation can also be used to find the focal length. Let me plug in the values.

do is 20 inches. The image is virtual, so di is negative because virtual images are on the same side as the object. Oh wait, no. Let me think about the sign conventions. Converging lenses (which are the ones that form real images) have positive focal lengths, and diverging lenses (which form virtual images) have negative focal lengths.

Wait, the sign for the image distance di depends on whether the image is real or virtual. For real images, the di is positive (since it's on the same side as the object, which is the case for converging lenses when the object is within the focal length). But for virtual images, the di is negative because the image is on the same side as the object, but the lens is diverging.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me clarify: the sign of di depends on whether the image is real or virtual. For a real image, di is positive. For a virtual image, di is negative, but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the sign is the other way around. For a real image, di is positive, because the image is on the same side as the object, but the object is on the same side as the incoming light. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard sign conventions are: for a converging lens, if the object is placed beyond the focal length (so image is real and on the opposite side), di is positive. If the object is placed within the focal length, di would be negative, but that's for diverging lenses. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, it's the opposite. For a converging lens, if the object is within f, the image is virtual, on the same side. So di is negative. Because the image is formed on the same side as the object, but the image is virtual, so di is negative.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a quick recap. The sign conventions: 

- Object distance (do) is positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light. So for a converging lens, if the object is placed inside f, do is positive but less than f. The image is virtual, so di is negative. 

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think about the case when the object is placed beyond the focal length (f). For a converging lens, the image is real and on the opposite side of the object. So in this case, di is positive. So for a converging lens, when the object is beyond f, do is positive (because the object is on the same side as the incoming light), and di is positive (image on opposite side).

When the object is within f, the image is virtual, so di is negative. Because the image is on the same side as the object but is virtual, which is on the same side as the object but behind it. So in that case, di is negative.

So for this problem, the object is placed 20 inches from the lens, and the image is virtual, 10 inches from the lens. So for a converging lens, di is negative, but wait, in this problem, the image is virtual, so for a converging lens, the image is virtual and on the same side. So in that case, di is negative. So for converging lens, when the object is inside f, do is positive, and di is negative.

But wait, in this problem, the object is 20 inches from the lens, and the image is 10 inches. So that would imply that the image is on the same side as the object, meaning it's a virtual image. So for a converging lens, when you have a virtual image, the object must be within the focal length. Therefore, the object distance do is less than f. 

But wait, in our case, do is 20 inches. So for a converging lens, do must be less than f. So 20 < f. So f would be positive, but since it's a converging lens, f is positive. So the focal length is positive, but in this case, since the image is virtual, the object is within f. Therefore, the focal length is greater than do. So do is 20, image is virtual, so f must be positive and greater than 20.

Wait, but when do is less than f, the focal length f is positive, and the image is virtual. So looking for f > do, which would be 20. So f is greater than 20, which would make f positive, but since it's a converging lens, f is positive. So f is positive, and image is virtual.

Wait, but according to the lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

In this case, do is 20, di is negative because virtual image. So:

1/f = 1/20 + 1/(-10) → 1/f = (1/20) - (1/10) → 1/f = (1-2)/(20) → 1/f = -1/20 → f = -20.

Wait, so f comes out negative. But wait, if f is negative, that would make it a diverging lens. But earlier reasoning suggested that for a virtual image, the lens must be converging, so f should be positive.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me re-examine the sign convention for di. Because in this problem, the image is virtual, which would mean that the image is formed on the same side as the object. For a converging lens, when the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, the image distance di is negative. Because di is measured from the lens towards the object. Wait, no, I'm getting confused with the sign conventions.

Wait, the standard setup: the object is placed on the left (left side of the lens), and the image is formed on the right side (right side of the lens). For a converging lens, when the object is placed beyond f, the image is real and on the right side (same side as the object). So here, the image is virtual, so for a converging lens, the image is on the same side, thus di is negative.

Wait, but wait—no, that's incorrect. Let me clarify:

Wait, in the standard setup, the object is on the left. The image is on the right. For a converging lens, if the object is placed beyond f (real image), di is positive. If the object is placed within f (virtual image), di is negative. So in this problem, the image is virtual, so di is negative.

So back to the equation:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

In this problem: do = 20, di = -10.

So 1/f = (1/20) + (1/(-10)) → 1/f = (1/20) - (1/10) → 1/f = (1 - 2)/20 → ( -1/20 ) → f = -20.

Hmm, so f is -20 inches. But that's a negative focal length, which would imply a diverging lens. So according to the lens equation, this setup leads to a negative focal length.

But earlier, I thought that virtual images can only come from a converging lens. Because a diverging lens can only form virtual images on the opposite side.

So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign convention.

Wait a minute, perhaps I have the signs wrong. Maybe for a diverging lens, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, so di is positive. Let me see: for a diverging lens, the focal length is negative. So, the standard equation would be 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

In this case, do is 20, di is positive (since image is virtual and formed on the same side as the object). So 1/f = 1/20 + 1/10.

Calculating that: 1/f = (1 + 2)/20 → 3/20 → f = 20/3 ≈ 6.666 inches.

But that's not any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, let's see which options have f positive (converging) or negative (diverging).

Option A: -20in, diverging → f is negative. So that's a diverging lens.

Option B:5in, converging → positive f.

Option C:10in, diverging → negative.

Option D:20in, converging → positive.

Option F: -15in, converging → negative.

Option G: -30in, diverging → negative.

Option H: -10in, diverging → negative.

Option I: -10in, converging → positive, but f is negative.

Wait, no, the options have f as the first value. Let's look again.

The options:

A: -20in, diverging → f is negative, diverging.

B:5in, converging → positive f, converging.

C:10in, diverging → negative.

D:20in, converging → positive.

E:30in, converging → positive.

F: -15in, converging → negative.

G: -30in, diverging → negative.

H:15in, diverging → negative.

I: -10in, converging → positive f, converging.

J: -5in, diverging → negative.

So the correct conclusion is that, because the image is virtual, the lens must be a diverging lens. Therefore, the focal length is negative.

So f is negative. Let me see which options have negative f.

Options A, C, G, I.

Now, do we have f = -20 in. Let's compute that.

Using the lens equation, 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Do is 20, di is -10 (since image is virtual, which would be on the same side as the object, so di is negative).

So 1/f = (1/20) + (1/(-10)).

Compute denominator:

(1/20) is 0.05, 1/(-10) is -0.1.

Adding them: 0.05 - 0.1 = -0.05 → 1/f = -0.05 → f = -20.

Yes, that's correct. So f is -20 inches, which is a diverging lens.

So the answer should be option A: -20in, diverging.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the problem would imply a converging lens because the image is virtual. But the calculation shows that f is negative, thus a diverging lens.

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To determine the focal length and type of the lens, we use the lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \(d_o\) is the object distance (20 inches), \(d_i\) is the image distance (10 inches in magnitude but negative because the image is virtual), and \(f\) is the focal length.

### Step 1: Analyze the sign conventions
- For a **converging lens** (positive focal length), the image is virtual if the object is within the focal length (\(d_o < f\)).
- For a **diverging lens** (negative focal length), the image is always virtual and formed on the opposite side of the object.

In this problem, the image is virtual and 10 inches from the lens. Since the image is virtual, the lens must be a **diverging lens**. The negative sign in \(d_i\) confirms this.

### Step 2: Solve for the focal length
Using the lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{-10}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{10}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1 - 2}{20} = \frac{-1}{20}
\]

\[
f = -20 \, \text{inches}
\]

Thus, the focal length is \(-20\) inches, confirming that the lens is a **diverging lens**.

### Step 3: Match with the options
From the options provided:
- **A: -20in, diverging** — Correct.
- **B: 5in, converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is negative and the lens is diverging.
- **C: 10in, diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is not 10 inches.
- **D: 20in, converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is negative.
- **E: 30in, converging** — Incorrect.
- **F: -15in, converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is negative.
- **G: -30in, diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is \(-20\), not \(-30\).
- **H: -10in, diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is \(-20\), not \(-10\).
- **I: -10in, converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is negative.
- **J: -5in, diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is \(-20\).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **A: -20in, diverging**.
