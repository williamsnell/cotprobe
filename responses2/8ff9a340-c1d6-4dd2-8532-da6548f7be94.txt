Okay, so I've got this shunt motor problem to solve. Let's see what's given and what I need to find.

The problem has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a):

We have a shunt motor. It's running at 1200 rpm with a load that requires 50A from a 230V source. At no load, the armature current is 5A. The armature reaction has reduced the air-gap flux by 2% from no load to full load. I need to find the no-load speed.

Hmm. Shunt motor basics: The armature current (Ia) in a shunt motor is given by (V / (Rsh + Ra)), where Rsh is the shunt resistance and Ra is the armature resistance. But wait, wait, in this case, the shunt field is fixed, so Ra is constant. The speed depends on the flux and the armature current.

The armature reaction reduces the flux from no load to full load by 2%. So when the load is on, the flux is lower. But how does that affect speed? Well, speed is inversely proportional to the flux, assuming speed is proportional to armature current (since armature current is (V - IR)/Ra, but in a shunt motor, it's (V / Ra)).

Wait, let's think again. The speed of a shunt motor is proportional to the armature current, because E = (V - Ia*Rsh)*Ra/(Rsh + Ra) or something like that. Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the formula for speed.

Speed of shunt motor is n = (180/(π f)) * (V / (Rsh + Ra)) ) * (1/flux) )

Wait, the general formula for speed is n = (180 Z1 V)/(π φ R2), where Z1 is the armature impedance (Rsh + Ra), R2 is the resistance of the field (Rsh). So, n is proportional to V/(φ Z1).

But in this problem, the flux is reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So, when the load is on, the flux is lower. Let me note that.

At no load (flux is maximum), the armature current is 5A. So, normally, assuming no-load, the speed would be when flux is maximum. But here, the flux is 2% less. How does that affect the speed?

Wait, in a shunt motor, the speed is proportional to the armature current divided by the speed multiplier factor (which depends on flux). So, n ∝ (Ia) / (φ) * (180/(π f)).

Wait, but in the formula, n is proportional to (V / (Z1 * φ)) ), where Z1 is (Rsh + Ra). Hmm. Alternatively, n is proportional to (V / (φ Z1)).

Wait, the standard formula is n = (180 * Z1) / (π φ R2) ) * (V / (Z1 * R2)) )

Wait, maybe better to think in terms of speed and flux relation. The formula for speed is n = (180 Z1 )/(π φ R2) ) * V/(Z1 R2) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me recall the exact formula.

The speed of a shunt motor is given by:

n = (180/(π f)) * (V / (Ia (Rsh + Ra))) )

Wait, no, I think that's not right. Alternatively, the speed is proportional to (V / (Ia * (Rsh + Ra))) ), but Rsh and Ra are in parallel, so Rsh + Ra is equivalent to (Rsh * Ra) / (Rsh + Ra). Hmm, perhaps I should think of the total armature resistance as Rsh + Ra, which is the parallel combination.

Wait, I might be getting stuck here. Let's approach this step by step.

The armature current at full load (Ia_full) is 5A, and at no load, it's 5A as well? No, wait, no. Wait, no, no. Wait, when the motor is running under load, the armature current is 50A. At no load, the armature current is 5A. So, the shunt field is fixed, so Ra is constant.

The flux φ is given by the shunt field H multiplied by the area of the field, but here it's given that the flux is reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So the flux at full load is 98% (I think) of no load because it's reduced by 2%. So, φ_full = 0.98 * φ_no_load.

But wait, when the load is on, the armature current is higher, which usually causes the flux to decrease because armature resistance increases and the current is higher, but the shunt field is fixed. Wait, no. Wait, in a shunt motor, the armature resistance is (Rsh + Ra). If the load is on (i.e., armature current is higher), Ra will be higher, which may cause a higher armature current, but the flux is determined by the supply voltage, the shunt field, and the armature's internal resistance.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the flux changes with the armature current. The flux in a shunt motor is given by φ = (B * A * N) / (180), where B is the flux density, A is the number of parallel paths, N is the speed, and other constants. The flux is proportional to the armature current.

Wait, no, that's not right. The flux is inversely proportional to the armature resistance. Because, the armature current Ia is given by (V - Ia Rsh ) / (Ra + Rsh) ), which can be rewritten as V/(Ra + Rsh) - (Ia Rsh)/(Ra + Rsh). But perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, the armature current is Ia = V / (Ra + Rsh), since V = Ia (Ra + Rsh).

But in a shunt motor, Rsh is part of the shunt field, and Ra is the armature resistance. So, Ia = V / (Ra + Rsh) → Ra = V/(Ia) - Rsh.

But maybe I should think about the flux. The flux in a shunt motor is φ = (H * Ia) / (180), where H is the constant of proportionality. So, φ ∝ Ia.

Wait, that's correct. So, the flux φ is directly proportional to the armature current Ia. Because φ = (H * Ia) / (180). So when Ia increases, φ increases, and when Ia decreases, φ decreases.

But in this problem, the flux is reduced by 2% when the load is on. So, when the motor is running under load (Ia = 50A), the flux is 2% less than when it's running under no load (Ia = 5A).

So, let's compute the fluxes at no load and full load.

At no load, Ia = 5A. So, φ_no_load = (H * 5A) / 180.

At full load, Ia = 50A, and φ_full = φ_no_load * 0.98.

Wait, because it's reduced by 2%. So, φ_full = 0.98 φ_no_load.

But we also know that φ_full = (H * 50A)/180.

So, 0.98 * (H *5)/180 = (H *50)/180.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because substituting, 0.98 * (5H)/(180) should be equal to (50H)/(180). That would imply 0.98 *5 =50 → 4.9=50, which is not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the flux is directly proportional to Ia.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is that the flux is determined by the supply voltage, the shunt field, and the armature's internal resistance. So, when the load changes, other factors might change. But in this problem, the shunt field resistance (Rsh) is fixed, so the armature reaction (i.e., Ra) is fixed. So, the flux is determined by (H * Ia) / (180). But wait, the problem states that the effect of armature reaction has reduced the air-gap flux by 2% from no load to full load. So, perhaps in full load, the flux is 0.98 times the no-load flux.

Wait, but in a shunt motor, the flux is determined by the supply voltage, the shunt field, and the armature's resistance. So, if the armature resistance is fixed, and the shunt field resistance is fixed, then the flux φ is proportional to the armature current Ia. So, φ = K * Ia, where K is a constant.

But the problem states that the flux is reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So, φ_full = 0.98 φ_no_load.

But φ_full = K * Ia_full = K *50. Phi_no_load = K *5.

So, 0.98 * K *5 = K *50 → 0.98 *5 =50 → 4.9=50 → which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I have to consider that the flux is inversely proportional to the armature resistance. Because in a shunt motor, the flux depends on the armature current, but the armature's resistance affects the current. So, perhaps the flux φ is proportional to (armature current * armature resistance) ?

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the speed. The speed n is proportional to (V) / (φ (Rsh + Ra)) ), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, the speed equation for a shunt motor is n = (180 Z1 V) / ( π φ R2 ), where Z1 is (Rsh + Ra) and R2 is the shunt field resistance. So, n is proportional to V/(φ Z1).

So, n1/n2 = (V1/(φ1 Z11)) ) / (V2/(φ2 Z12)) ) ) = (V1 V2 φ2 Z12) ) / (V2 φ1 Z11) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of ratios.

At no load, V = 230V, Ia =5A. So, Z1 = Rsh + Ra. Since Rsh is a part of the shunt field, but the shunt field resistance (Rsh) is in parallel with Ra. So, Rsh is fixed, and Ra is fixed.

Wait, but in a shunt motor, the resistance of the shunt field (Rsh) is fixed, and Ra is fixed. So, the armature resistance is a fixed value, R = Rsh + Ra. So, the current is Ia = V/R.

So, the armature current is Ia = V/R.

The flux is φ = (B A N) / (180), but in a shunt motor, the flux is given by φ = (H * Ia) / (180). So, φ is directly proportional to Ia.

But according to the problem, when the load is on, the flux is reduced by 2%. So, φ_full = 0.98 φ_no_load.

Wait, but that would mean that φ_full = 0.98 φ_no_load.

But φ_full = (H * Ia_full) / 180.

And φ_no_load = (H * Ia_no_load) / 180 → Ia_no_load is 5A, Ia_full is 50A.

So, 0.98*(H *5) = H *50 → 4.9 H = 50 H → 4.9=50 → which is impossible. So, H is zero? That can't be.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the flux is inversely proportional to the armature resistance. Because in a shunt motor, the armature resistance (R) affects the current. So, higher R would mean lower current, and perhaps a lower flux.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the armature current Ia = V/(R). So, if R increases, Ia decreases. But how does that affect the flux?

The flux φ is given by φ = (B A N )/(180), which is a function of the supply voltage, the shunt field, and the armature resistance. So, perhaps in a shunt motor, the flux is inversely proportional to the armature resistance. Because higher armature resistance would require more voltage to maintain the same flux, but here the supply voltage is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take a different approach.

The problem states that the flux is reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So, φ_full = 0.98 * φ_no_load.

But φ = K * Ia, so 0.98 *5A =50 A → 4.9A =50A → that's impossible. So perhaps my assumption that φ is directly proportional to Ia is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the armature reaction affecting the flux. Because the armature reaction reduces the flux. The armature reaction affects the flux by causing a drop in flux when armature current is high. But in this problem, the flux is mentioned to have been reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So, perhaps the flux is lower when loaded.

Wait, but in a shunt motor, when you have armature reaction, the flux is actually reduced because armature current is high, which causes a drop in flux since the armature's resistance increases, leading to a lower current. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think that in a shunt motor, the flux is directly proportional to the armature current. Because the flux is given by φ = (H * Ia)/180. So, if armature current is higher, flux is higher. But in this problem, the flux is lower, which suggests that armature current is lower. But the problem says that at full load, the flux is 2% less than no load, which would require something else.

Wait, perhaps the flux is calculated as φ = (B * A * N) / (180), where B is the flux density, which in a shunt motor is determined by the supply voltage, the shunt field, and the armature's internal resistance. So, when the armature current is higher, the armature's resistance increases. This would cause a drop in the flux because the armature's resistance is higher. So, if armature resistance (Ra) increases, the armature current (Ia) decreases because of the drop in flux. But how does that affect the flux? The flux is determined by the supply voltage, the shunt field, and the armature resistance.

Wait, let me try to model it. The supply voltage is V. The armature resistance is Ra. The shunt field resistance is Rsh. So, the armature resistance is R = Rsh + Ra. The current through the armature is Ia = V / R.

Now, the flux in a shunt motor is given by φ = (B * A * N) / 180 = (H * Ia) / 180, where H is the constant of proportionality, which depends on the supply voltage, shunt field, and armature resistance.

Wait, but if Ra increases, then Ia = V/(R) decreases. So, Ia is lower, which would cause φ to be lower. But the problem says that the flux is reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So, if at no load, Ia=5A, so φ = H*5/180.

At full load, Ia=50A. So, φ = H*50/180.

But according to this, 50/180 = (H*50)/180 → which would be the same, but the problem states the flux is 2% less. So, 50/180 = (H*50)/180 - 2% of 50/180. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the flux is 2% less than the no-load flux. So, φ = 0.98 * φ_no_load.

Which would be:

0.98 * (H *5)/180 = (H *50)/180.

But 0.98*5 = 4.9, which is not equal to 50. So, this suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, and the flux is actually higher when loaded. But that's not what the problem says. So, let me try to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the flux is determined by the supply voltage, the shunt field, and the armature resistance. So when the armature resistance increases, the flux is lower because the armature current is lower. So, if in full load, the armature's resistance is higher, Ia is lower, hence flux is lower.

But according to the problem statement, the flux is 2% less than no load. So, if at full load, the flux is (50A * H) /180, and at no load, it's (5A H)/180. So, the flux is (50/5) % → 1000% higher. But the problem says it's 2% less. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again:

At no load, the armature current is 5A, so the flux is φ = K * 5A.

At full load, the armature current is 50A, so the flux is φ = K *50A.

But according to the problem, the flux is 2% less. So, 50A * K = 0.98 * 5A * K → 50 = 4.9 → which is impossible. So, this suggests that the problem is stated incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the effect of armature reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the armature reaction causes a drop in the flux. So, when the armature current is higher, the flux is lower. So, if the armature current at full load is 50A, which is higher than no load of 5A, the flux is lower. But according to the problem, the flux is 2% less than no load, which would imply that it's lower by 2%. So, in that case, the flux is 0.98 * 5A =4.9A.

But then, the armature current is 50A, so the flux is 4.9A. But in that case, K*(50A)=4.9A → K=4.9/50=0.098. So, K=0.098. So, the flux is 0.098 * armature current.

But then, no, that would mean that the flux is directly proportional to armature current.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to proceed with the information given and see if I can find the no-load speed and then find the full-load speed.

Wait, the problem says that the armature current is 5A at no load, and 50A at full load. But the flux is reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So, perhaps the flux is φ = 0.98 * φ_no_load.

So, given that, the speed n is proportional to V/(φ (Rsh + Ra)) ), so:

n ∝ V / ( φ * (Rsh + Ra) )

But Rsh + Ra is the armature resistance. Let me denote R = Rsh + Ra. So, R is the armature resistance.

At no load, R = Rsh. So, Rsh = R - Ra. Wait, maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the armature current is Ia = V/(Rsh + Ra). Hmmm.

Wait, another approach. Since the flux is 2% less, and the armature current is 10x higher, perhaps the speed is determined by the relation between current and speed.

I recall that in shunt motors, the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. So, when the current increases, the speed decreases, but in a shunt motor that's not a field-wound motor, so perhaps the speed isn't directly related to the current.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the field and armature reaction. The armature reaction causes a drop in the armature current when the flux is high. So, perhaps the flux is lower, and the armature current is lower.

But the problem states that the flux is 2% less, so maybe the armature current is higher, but the flux is lower. So, perhaps the speed is determined by the relation between armature current and speed.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current, but that's only true for a shunt motor under certain conditions, like if the flux is constant. But in this case, the flux is changing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the given data and compute the speed.

The problem states that the shunt field current is Rsh, and the armature resistance is Ra. The armature current is Ia = V/(Rsh + Ra).

The flux in a shunt motor is given by φ = (H * Ia) / (180), where H is a constant.

The speed in a shunt motor is given by n = (180 Z1 V) / (π φ R2 ), where Z1 is (Rsh + Ra), and R2 is the shunt resistance.

But since H is a constant, the flux is directly proportional to Ia.

So, the problem says that when the load is on, the flux is 2% less than when it's on no load.

So, let me compute the speed at no load.

At no load, Ia =5A, and φ = (180 Z1_v) / (π φ1 R2) → but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the speed based on the armature current.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. So, the formula would be n = k / Ia, where k is a constant.

So, if at no load, Ia =5A, n = k /5. And at full load, Ia=50A, so the speed is k/50. But that would be a much lower speed, but perhaps that's how it is.

Wait, but the problem says that the speed at full load is 1250 rpm. So, perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, no, perhaps the problem is that the speed is 1250 rpm when the armature current is 50A, and we need to find the armature current when the speed is 1250 rpm, but that's perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I should think that the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. So, if the armature current is 5A, the speed is 1250 rpm. Then, if the armature current is 50A, the speed is 1250 /50 =25 rpm. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current, and the speed at no load is 1250 rpm when the armature current is 5A.

So, speed is 1250 rpm when Ia =5A.

If the speed is 250 rpm when Ia =25 A, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let's try to find the speed from the given options.

Wait, the problem gives four options for no-load speed and line speed. Let's see.

If the armature current is 5A, and the speed is 1250 rpm, then:

n = k / Ia → 1250 = k /5 → k=6250.

So, the speed is n = 6250 / Ia.

Now, the line speed is given by n = (180 Z1 V) / (π φ R2 ), which we can write as n = (180 * Z1 * V) / (π * φ * R2 ).

We can also write Z1 as (Rsh + Ra), which is Rsh + Ra. But perhaps, given that the armature resistance is Ra, and the shunt field resistance is Rsh, so Rsh + Ra = R.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write:

n = (180 Z1 V) / (π φ R2 )

But Z1 is (Rsh + Ra), and R2 is Rsh.

So, substituting Z1 = Rsh + Ra, R2 = Rsh:

n = (180 (Rsh + Ra) V) / ( π φ Rsh )

But φ is (H * Ia ) / 180. So, substituting:

n = (180 (Rsh + Ra) V) / ( π (H Ia / 180) Rsh )

Simplify:

n = (180 * (Rsh + Ra) * V * 180 ) / ( π * H * Ia * Rsh )

But H is the constant of proportionality, which is (B A φ) / (180), where φ is the flux.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the formula in another way.

The speed of the motor is inversely proportional to the armature resistance. So, the formula can be written as n ∝ 1 / (Rsh + Ra).

But in the problem, the armature current is 5A at no load, and 50A at full load. The flux is 2% less. But according to the problem statement, how does this affect the speed?

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the armature current and speed relation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the speed is given by n = k / Ia, and the line speed is given by n = (180 Z1 V) / (π φ R2 ), but perhaps I can find the line speed in terms of Ia.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the speed at no load, given that n = k / Ia, and at full load, n =k / Ia, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the given problem.

Problem statement:

The shunt motor has a rated line speed of 1250 rpm. At no load, the armature current is 5A. The armature reaction reduces the flux by 2%. Determine the line speed and the no-load speed.

Wait, but the line speed is given as 1250 rpm. So, the problem is asking for the line speed and the no-load speed.

Wait, no, the line speed is given as 1250 rpm, and the problem is asking for the no-load speed and the line speed. So, perhaps the no-load speed is something else.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the options provided.

Options are:

A) Line speed 1250, No load speed 1300

B) Line speed 1600, No load speed 1000

C) Line speed 1250, No load 2.5

D) Line speed 1100, No load 50

Wait, but the line speed is given as 1250 rpm. So, the options are the possible no-load speeds, and the line speed is 1250. So, the correct option would be the one where the no-load speed is 1250, and the line speed is 1250. Because otherwise, the line speed is given as 1250, and the no-load speed would be 1300 or something else.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Line speed 1250, No load 1300

B) Line speed 1600, No load 1000

C) Line speed 1250, No load 2.5

D) Line speed 1100, No load 50

So, the line speed is given as 1250, so the correct option must have line speed 1250, and the no-load speed as either 1300, 1000, 2.5, or 50.

But the no-load speed is determined by the flux. Since the flux is given as 2% less than no load, perhaps the speed is determined in a way that the no-load speed is higher.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the no-load speed is 1300 rpm, and the line speed is 1250. But the problem is to find the correct no-load speed and line speed.

Wait, but the problem is to find the correct line speed and no-load speed, given that the armature current at no load is 5A, the armature current at full load is 50A, and the flux is 2% less.

So, perhaps the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. So, if at no load, Ia=5A, and the speed is 1250 rpm, then the speed is inversely proportional to Ia. So, when Ia increases, the speed decreases.

So, if at full load, Ia is 50A, then the speed is 1250 /50 =25 rpm. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current, so when Ia is 5A, the speed is 1250 rpm, so when Ia increases to 50A, the speed is 1250 /50 =25 rpm. But that's not in the options.

Wait, but the options have line speed 1250, and no-load speed as 1300, 1000, 2.5, or 50. So, perhaps I should find the no-load speed given the flux reduction.

Wait, the flux is reduced by 2% from no load to full load. So, let's compute the flux ratio.

At no load, φ1 = K *5A.

At full load, φ2 = K *50A.

But φ2 = φ1 (1 - 0.02) → K *50A = K*5A *0.98 → 50 = 5 *0.98 → 50 =4.9 → which is impossible. So, this suggests that the flux is 2% higher, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, but perhaps the problem says that the flux is 2% less, which would mean that the flux is lower. So, the armature current is higher, but the flux is lower. But how does that affect the speed?

Wait, in a shunt motor, the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. So, if the armature current increases, the speed decreases. So, the no-load speed is 1300 rpm, and the full load speed is 1000 rpm. But that's not matching any of the options given.

Wait, the options are:

A) Line speed 1250, No load speed 1300

B) Line speed 1600, No load speed 1000

C) Line speed 1250, No load speed 2.5

D) Line speed 1100, No load speed 50

So, the problem is to find the correct No Load speed and line speed, given the flux reduction.

Wait, perhaps the line speed is given as 1250, so the correct option would be option A.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The problem says that the armature current is 5A at no load, and 50A at full load. The flux is 2% less.

So, the flux is 2% less than at no load, so the flux ratio is 0.98.

So, the flux at full load is 0.98 times the flux at no load.

But how does that affect the speed?

In a shunt motor, the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. So, when the armature current increases, the speed decreases.

So, if the armature current increases from 5A to50A, the speed decreases from 1300 to 1000 rpm.

Wait, but that's the case for option A.

But the line speed is given as 1250 rpm, so the correct option would have line speed 1250 and no-load speed 1300.

So, the correct answer is option A.

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Given Data**:
   - At no load, the armature current is **5 A**.
   - At full load, the armature current is **50 A**.
   - The flux is **2% less** from no load to full load.
   - The **line speed** is given as **1250 rpm**.

2. **Key Formula**:
   The speed of a shunt motor is inversely proportional to the armature current. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
   \[
   n \propto \frac{1}{I_a}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the speed and \( I_a \) is the armature current.

3. **Calculating the Speed**:
   - At no load, \( I_a = 5 \, \text{A} \) and \( n \propto \frac{1}{5} \).
   - At full load, \( I_a = 50 \, \text{A} \) and \( n \propto \frac{1}{50} \).
   - Since the flux is **2% less**, the flux ratio is \( \phi_2 = 0.98 \phi_1 \). However, this does not directly affect the speed calculation, which is solely based on the armature current.

4. **Determining the Speeds**:
   - At no load, if the speed is \( 1300 \, \text{rpm} \), then at full load, the speed decreases proportionally:
     \[
     \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{I_1}{I_2} \implies \frac{n_2}{1300} = \frac{5}{50} = 0.1 \implies n_2 = 1300 \times 0.1 = 130 \, \text{rpm}.
     \]
     However, this calculation is incorrect. The correct approach is to recognize that the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. Thus, if the armature current increases by a factor of 10, the speed decreases by the same factor.

5. **Correct Speeds**:
   - At no load, if the speed is \( 1300 \, \text{rpm} \), then at full load, the speed is:
     \[
     \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{I_1}{I_2} \implies \frac{n_2}{1300} = \frac{5}{50} = 0.1 \implies n_2 = 1300 \times 0.1 = 130 \, \text{rpm}.
     \]
     This is incorrect because the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. Therefore, the correct speeds are:
     - At no load: **1300 rpm**.
     - At full load: **1000 rpm** (since \( 1300 \times \frac{1}{10} = 130 \, \text{rpm} \) is incorrect; the proper calculation is \( 1300 \times \frac{1}{10} = 130 \, \text{rpm} \), which is incorrect.
