Question:

A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a microcomputer and data acquisition. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

So, the question says we have a microcomputer that needs to digitize and process four analog inputs. And for each input, it takes 12 microseconds to digitize. But wait, it's mentioned that only one digitization happens at a time. So that's 12μs per signal, not per instruction.

Then there's the CPU instructions. The problem says five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, are executed for each signal digitized. Oh wait, each digitization process includes the trigger. So if one digitization takes 12μs, and five instructions are done for each signal, that means the processing time per signal is 12μs ×5? No, wait, no. Because each digitization is triggered by a CPU instruction, and for each signal, there are 5 instructions. So each signal's digitization takes 5×12μs? Or wait, maybe the five instructions are including the trigger. Because the trigger is part of the five instructions. So the time per signal is 12μs, but with five instructions, that's 5×12=60μs per signal? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, let me read again. It says, "only one digitization occurs at a time." So each digitization is one set of four signals. So for each four signals, one digitization. Each digitization takes 12μs. So for each four signals, five instructions are executed. So the processing time per four signals is 5×12μs =60μs? Or wait, wait, no. Because the five instructions each take a certain amount of time. Oh wait, the five instructions are for each signal. So each signal's digitization involves five instructions. So each digitization takes five instructions, each of which takes how much time? Hmm, wait, the problem doesn't specify the time per instruction beyond the trigger. Wait, the question says, "the time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12μs." So each digitization (triggered by a single instruction) takes 12μs. So each digitization is one signal: 12μs.

But for each signal, five instructions are executed. Wait, but each digitization is one signal, so each digitization (single signal) takes 12μs. So five instructions are done for each signal, but each instruction is part of the digitization process. Wait, but each digitization is a single signal, so each digitization is triggered by a single instruction. But the problem says, for each signal, five CPU instructions are executed. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to rephrase:

Each signal requires 5 CPU instructions to digitize. So for each signal, five instructions are needed. Each digitization (for one signal) takes 12μs. So each signal's digitization time is 5 × 12μs? Or wait, perhaps the five instructions are the time to do the digitization. Because the problem says, "the time for an external ADC to digitize one input is 12μs." But it's not clear if the five instructions are the same as the ADC's time. Maybe the five instructions each take a certain amount of time, or perhaps the ADC's time is 12μs per digitized input. 

Wait, the problem says, "the time for an external ADC to digitize one input is 12μs." So each digitization (single input) takes 12μs. And each digitization is triggered by a single CPU instruction. So each digitization takes 12μs. But for each signal, five instructions are executed. So five instructions, each of which takes 12μs? That can't be right because that would make each digitization take 60μs, but then you have five instructions for each signal, but each digitization is a single input. So maybe each digitization (single input) takes 12μs. So each signal's digitization time is 12μs. So five instructions are done for each signal, but each instruction is part of the digitization process, which is 12μs. Hmm, maybe that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the five instructions per signal are the time it takes to digitize each signal, but that would be 12μs per signal, but that doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps each digitization (for one signal) takes 12μs, and each digitization includes five instructions. So each digitization is the process: trigger ADC takes 12μs. But perhaps the five instructions are the overall time. No, the problem says, "the time for an external ADC to digitize one input is 12μs, and only one digitization occurs at a time." So each digitization (single input) takes 12μs.

Wait, but the problem says, "only one digitization occurs at a time." So each digitization is one signal. So each digitization is processed in 12μs. So for each signal, 12μs.

But each digitization uses five instructions. So that's 5 × 12μs? Or is each instruction taking 12μs? That's unclear. Wait, the problem states: "the time for an external ADC to digitize one input is 12μs." So each digitization (single input) takes 12μs. So each digitization is one signal, which takes 12μs. So in that case, for each signal, the digitization is done in 12μs.

But then for each signal, five instructions are executed. Hmm, perhaps each of the five instructions is part of the digitization process. So each digitization (single input) takes 5 × 12μs. That can't be, because the ADC takes only 12μs for a single digitized input. So perhaps the five instructions are for different things, but each digitization takes 12μs regardless.

Alternatively, maybe the five instructions are the time it takes to digitize the four signals. But that seems unlikely because each digitization is for one signal. So perhaps the five instructions per signal are the time it takes to trigger the ADC for each of the four signals. But that doesn't add up because each signal would take 12μs, and four would be 48μs, which isn't matching.

I think I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to outline the problem again.

- Digitization time for one input: 12μs.
- Each digitization is done for one signal at a time. So each digitization takes 12μs.
- For each signal, five instructions are executed.
- Ten instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples.
- The time to convert from digital to analog is ignored.

We need to find the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total time each step takes, and find the maximum allowed average instruction time.

Let's break it down step by step.

Each signal requires:

1. Digitization: 12μs per signal.

But for each signal, five instructions are executed. So perhaps each digitization (single input) takes 5 × (time per instruction) = 12μs. But that would mean each instruction takes 12/5 = 2.4μs. But wait, that can't be right because the ADC takes 12μs for one input. So perhaps the five instructions are the time it takes for the ADC to digitize the input. But that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the five instructions are the time it takes for the ADC to digitize the four samples. So for each signal, five instructions are done. Each instruction takes 12μs. Then, the ADC would take five ×12μs =60μs per digitization. But that would require more processing time than just 12μs. So that probably isn't the case.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.

The problem says: "the time for an external ADC to digitize one input is 12μs, and only one digitization occurs at a time." So each digitization (for a single input) takes 12μs. So that's 12μs per signal.

Each digitization is triggered by a single CPU instruction.

So for each signal, five instructions are executed. So each digitization (single input) takes five instructions, each of which is part of the digitization process. So each instruction's time is 12μs divided by the number of instructions per signal. Wait, but that would mean each instruction takes 12μs /5= 2.4μs. But that can't be right because the ADC takes 12μs for one input. So perhaps the five instructions are the time it takes for the ADC to digitize the input. But that would be 5×(ADC time) =12μs, which would make each ADC time 2.4μs, which seems low. But then, when the ADC is done, the other processing steps would take more time.

But perhaps the five instructions are the time to digitize the four samples, and each instruction takes a certain amount of time.

Alternatively, perhaps each digitization (single input) takes 12μs, regardless of the number of instructions. So each digitization is 12μs, and the five instructions are part of that process.

Wait, perhaps each digitization (one signal) takes 12μs, and that is done by five instructions. So the time per instruction is 12μs divided by 5, which is 2.4μs per instruction.

So each instruction takes 2.4μs.

But then, after each digitization, there are processing steps. The problem says that ten instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value.

So for each signal, after digitization, ten more instructions are needed for averaging.

Wait, but ten instructions? So perhaps after digitizing, the microcomputer has ten instructions to average the four samples.

Wait, but each digitization is a single signal, so perhaps the process is:

1. Digitize the signal (takes 12μs, but that's using five instructions, each taking 2.4μs)

Wait, maybe each digitization (single input) takes 12μs. So the five instructions for that digitization take a total of 12μs.

But the problem is, each digitization uses five instructions. So perhaps the time per instruction is 12μs divided by 5, which is 2.4μs per instruction. So each of the five instructions takes 2.4μs.

So the steps after digitization are:

- Ten CPU instructions to average the four samples and output the average.

So after the digitization (12μs), the next ten instructions are for averaging. So the average time would then be the sum of the digitization time and the ten instructions.

Wait, no. Because the digitization (12μs) is part of the main processing, but the average processing is another part.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a sequence of steps:

1. Digitize one signal (12μs).

2. Then, ten instructions are done to average four samples (each instruction takes 2.4μs, so 10×2.4=24μs.

So the total time for processing one signal is 12 (digitization) + 24 (averaging) = 36μs. But wait, that's the time taken for one signal.

Wait, but the problem is about the average instruction execution time. So for each signal, how much time is spent in each step.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased: each signal requires 5 instructions for digitization, which take 12μs total. So each instruction takes 12/5 = 2.4μs.

Then, the average step requires 10 instructions (10 ×2.4μs=24μs).

So the total time for processing one signal is the time for the digitization (12μs) plus the time for the average step (24μs) → 36μs.

But wait, that's for each signal. However, the problem is to find the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates.

Wait, but data rates are about how much data is being processed per time. If the data rate is high, the microcomputer must process each sample quickly. So the total time per sample (digitization plus average) is 36μs. So per sample, 36μs of processing time.

But the question is about the maximum average instruction execution time. So each average instruction takes 2.4μs (since each instruction is 2.4μs). Ten of them take 24μs. So the average instruction execution time is 2.4μs.

But wait, the options are in the thousands of microseconds. So 2.4μs is an option (option C). But that would mean that each average instruction takes 2.4μs. But I thought the digitization took 12μs, which was divided into five instructions, each 2.4μs. Then, the average step is 10 instructions, each 2.4μs, taking 24μs.

So the average instruction execution time is 2.4μs. So the answer would be C: 2.4μs.

Wait, but the question says, "the time for an external ADC to digitize one input is 12μs." So the digitization itself is 12μs. Then, the five instructions are done for each digitization. So perhaps each instruction is 12/5 = 2.4μs. Then the average step takes 10×2.4=24μs.

So the total processing time per signal is 12+24=36μs. But the question asks about the average instruction execution time. So each average instruction is 2.4μs. So the average instruction execution time is 2.4μs per instruction. Hence, the maximum allowed average instruction execution time is 2.4μs. So the answer is option C.

To determine the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, we analyze the given problem as follows:

1. **Digitization Time**: Each digitization (for a single input) takes 12 microseconds. This is driven by the ADC time, which is given as 12μs per signal.

2. **Instructions for Digitization**: For each digitization, 5 CPU instructions are executed. Since the ADC time is 12μs, each instruction takes \( \frac{12\,\mu\text{s}}{5} = 2.4\,\mu\text{s} \).

3. **Average Step Time**: After digitization, 10 CPU instructions are executed to average the four samples. Each instruction takes 2.4μs, so the total time for this step is \( 10 \times 2.4\,\mu\text{s} = 24\,\mu\text{s} \).

4. **Total Processing Time per Signal**: The total time for processing one signal is the sum of the digitization time and the average step time:
   \[
   12\,\mu\text{s} + 24\,\mu\text{s} = 36\,\mu\text{s}.
   \]

5. **Average Instruction Execution Time**: The problem asks for the maximum average instruction execution time. Since each average instruction takes 2.4μs, this is the value we are seeking.

Thus, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is **2.4 microseconds**.
