Okay, so I've got this question about finding the number of four-letter code words possible using the letters in IOWA without repeating any letters. Hmm, let me think. IOWA has four unique letters, I, O, W, and A. Right, each letter is unique so no repeats allowed.

Wait, the question is about code words, which I think means the number of possible combinations. Since we're making a four-letter code and each letter can't be used more than once, I need to calculate permutations here.

So, permutations when order matters and no repetition is allowed. The formula for permutations is nPr = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose.

In this case, n is 4 (I, O, W, A), and r is 4 because we're making a four-letter code. So plugging into the formula: 4P4 = 4! / (4-4)! = 4! / 0! = 24 / 1 = 24. So the total number of possible four-letter codes is 24.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 24. So the answer should be H. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh, wait, maybe I'm misreading the question. Is IOWA a four-letter word, but perhaps it's being used differently? Like, maybe letters can repeat? No, the question says letters may not be repeated, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps each code uses exactly four letters, but maybe I'm allowed to use each letter only once. So I'm confident the calculation is correct. So the answer is 24, which is option H.

The correct answer is 24, which corresponds to option H.
