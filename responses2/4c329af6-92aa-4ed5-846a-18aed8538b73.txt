Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when the company should recognize the rental expense for their new office. Let me break down the facts.

The company took an operating lease on January 1 for office space and eventually entered into a leasehold improvement. They started alterations on March 1 and their staff moved in on May 1. The rent begins on July 1. I need to find out when the rental expense should be recognized for the new office.

Hmm, I remember that for lessees, the expense is recognized over the period the asset is used. But there's a catch because the company has already taken an operating lease. Wait, operating leases are for the entire term of the lease, while leasehold improvements are for specific periods. Or maybe it's the other way around? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. For operating leases, the expense is expensed immediately. But when the company has a leasehold improvement, which is a type of asset, the expense is only expensed when the asset is placed into service. So in this case, the staff moved in on May 1, so the asset is in service from May 1 onwards.

So the rental payments start on July 1. But the asset was used starting May 1. So the expense can't start until May 1, but the rent begins on July 1. Wait, no—that doesn't make sense. Because the rent is for the entire term, regardless of when the asset is placed in service. So maybe the expense should start when the asset is placed into use, which is May 1, but the rent is paid later.

Wait, no. The company's rent is for the entire term of the lease. So when the asset is placed into service (May 1), the expense should be recognized then. But the rent comes in later, so the expense should be recognized up to that point. But wait, the rent payments start on July 1. So does the expense stop being recognized until the asset is fully utilized?

No, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. For operating leases, the entire term's rent is expensed immediately. But for the leasehold improvements, the expense is expensed only when the asset is placed into service, which is when the asset is started. So in this case, the asset is placed into service on May 1, so expense should start then.

But the rent begins on July 1. So the first rent payment is on July 1 when the asset is already in use. So does that mean the expense can't start until May 1, or can it start as soon as the asset is placed in service, regardless of the rent timing?

Wait, no. When an asset is placed into service, the expense is expensed immediately. So even if the rent comes in later, the expense should be recognized when the asset is in use. So the expense would start on May 1, but the rent is paid from July 1 onwards.

Wait, but the question is about when the recognition of the new office (the leasehold improvement) should begin. So the new office is an asset that's placed into service on May 1, so expense should be recognized on May 1. However, the rent is for the entire term, so when would that expense have been recognized?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me outline the scenario:

- Jan 1: Take operating lease for office space and enter into leasehold improvements.
- March 1: Alterations are started.
- May 1: Staff moves into the property.
- Rent begins on July 1.

So the asset (leasehold improvement) is placed into service on May 1. So according to the revenue recognition principle, the expense should be recognized on May 1 when the asset is put into use. 

But the rent is for the entire term. So the company will have to account for the entire rental period. So the first rent payment is July 1, but until the asset is fully used, the expense can't be recognized. So the expense should start when the asset is in use, which is May 1, and then continue until the asset is fully utilized.

So the correct answer should be May 1. But looking at the options, D is May. But wait, the question is about the start of recognition, which is May 1. But let me think again. Because the leasehold improvements are a type of asset, not a lease. So the entire term's rent is expensed. So when the asset is placed into service, the expense is recognized that month. The rent is for the entire term, so the expense is expensed on May 1, and then continues until the entire term ends.

Wait, but the company's rent is for the entire term. So the first payment is on July 1, but the expense would be expensed on May 1, and then from June onward, as the term continues. So the first recognition is May 1, but the rent is paid in July.

So the correct answer should be May, which is option D. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The recognition of rental expense for the new office should begin in May. This is because the leasehold improvement, as an asset, is placed into service on May 1. According to the revenue recognition principle, the expense should be expensed when the asset is in use, which is on May 1.
