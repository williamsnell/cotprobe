Okay, so I've got this question about labeled trees on 6 vertices. Hmm, I remember that labeled trees are trees where the vertices are distinct, right? Oh wait, the problem specifically says "labeled trees," which means each vertex is uniquely identified. I think the key here is to find the number of different trees I can make with 6 labeled vertices.

I recall something about Cayley's formula, which says that the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^(n-2). So if n is 6, that would be 6^(4). Let me calculate that. 6^4 is 6*6*6*6. Let me compute that step by step: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. So 6^4 is 1296. So the number of labeled trees on 6 vertices is 1296. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, option I is 1296. So the answer should be I. But wait, what if I'm mixing up the formula? Oh right, Cayley's formula indeed gives n^(n-2), so for n=6 that's 6^4=1296. Yeah, that makes sense. I think option I is the correct choice.

The number of labeled trees on 6 vertices is calculated using Cayley's formula, which gives \(n^{n-2}\). For \(n=6\), this is \(6^4 = 1296\). Therefore, the correct option is I: 1296.

Answer: I
