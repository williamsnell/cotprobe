Okay, so I've got this question here: "How many three-digit positive integers are there?" And then there are several options. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a three-digit number is a number that has exactly three digits. So the first digit can't be zero because then it wouldn't be a three-digit number anymore. 

Wait, right. The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. So I think to find the total number, I need to find how many numbers are between 100 and 999 inclusive. 

But wait, maybe I should calculate it using the formula for the number of terms in a sequence. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So applying that here, it would be 999 minus 100 plus 1. Let me do the math: 999 minus 100 is 899, and adding 1 gives 900. So that would be 900 three-digit numbers.

Looking at the options, option A is 900. So the answer should be A. But wait, did I consider all the possibilities? Like, maybe I should think about each digit place. The hundreds place can be 1-9, so that's 9 options. The tens place can be 0-9, which is 10 options, and the ones place also 0-9, 10 options. So multiplying them together: 9 * 10 * 10 = 900. Yep, that confirms it. So I'm confident the answer is A.

The number of three-digit integers is calculated by considering the hundreds, tens, and ones places. Each of these can be calculated as follows: hundreds place (1-9) → 9 options, tens (0-9) → 10 options, ones (0-9) → 10 options. Multiplying these gives 9 * 10 * 10 = 900. 

Answer: A: 900
