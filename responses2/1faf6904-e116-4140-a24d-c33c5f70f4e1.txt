Okay, so I've got this physics problem about plane waves and standing waves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that E is 5 volts/meter is the amplitude of an incident plane wave. It's reflected at normal incidence from a boundary, and E1 is the amplitude of the reflected wave. The problem has three parts: (a) when is there a pure standing wave, (b) the VSWR when E1 is 1/10 V/m, and (c) the E_max and E_min when E1 is 3/5 V/m.

Wait, I need to remember what each part is about. Let's think. When a wave reflects off a boundary, the incident and reflected waves can either add up constructively or destructively. A pure standing wave occurs when the reflected wave is an exact negative of the incident wave. So, that would mean the phase difference is 180 degrees, right? Because that would mean their amplitudes add up in opposite directions, leading to no net wave (except for standing).

Wait, but how does this relate to the amplitude? Oh, I think when the reflected wave is an exact phase inversion, the total wave becomes a standing wave. So, the reflected amplitude E1 should be equal in magnitude but opposite in phase to the incident. But since we're dealing with amplitudes, which are scalars, the phase inversion doesn't affect the magnitude. So, for a pure standing wave, the reflected amplitude should be equal in magnitude but opposite in phase to the incident. But wait, the incident wave's amplitude is E, right? Or is E the incident amplitude? Let me check the question again.

The incident plane wave has E = 5 V/m. So, the incident wave's amplitude is E =5 V/m. The reflected wave E1 has to be equal in magnitude but opposite in phase to the incident for a pure standing wave. So, the condition is E1 = -E, because the phase is opposite. So, the amplitude has to be the same but negative. So, if E1 is -5 V/m, that would create a pure standing wave.

Wait, but wait a second. Because sometimes the reflection coefficient determines the amplitude. Oh, right. The reflection coefficient Γ is E1/E. If E is 5 V/m, then Γ is E1/5. But if the reflected wave is exactly opposite in phase, then Γ would be -1. So, E1 would be -5 V/m. So, the condition is E1 = -5 V/m. So, the answer for part (a) would be when E1 is -5 V/m.

Now, moving on to part (b): when E1 is 1/10 V/m, find the VSWR. VSWR is the standing wave ratio, which is (E_incident + E_reflected)/(E_incident - E_reflected) or something like that. Wait, I should remember the formula. The VSWR (Voltage standing wave ratio) is given by (E_incident + E_reflected)/(E_incident - E_reflected), but wait, another formula comes to mind. Oh wait, the correct formula is VSWR = (E_max/E_min). Alternatively, another approach is that VSWR = (E0 + E1)/( |E0 - E1| ), where E0 is the incident and E1 is the reflected amplitude.

Wait, so the VSWR is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum electric field amplitudes. Let me think: when a wave reflects, the standing wave's maxima and minima depend on the phase and amplitude. So, the max E would be E_incident + E_reflected (when they are in phase), and the min E would be E_incident - E_reflected (when they are out of phase). So, E_max is E0 + E1 (both in phase), and E_min is E0 - E1 (out of phase), but wait, that's only if the phase is 180 degrees. Wait, no, because E1 is the reflected amplitude, but let me model it properly.

Wait, E0 is the incident wave. When a wave reflects, the reflected E is E1 = Γ * E0. So, if Γ is negative, E1 = -E0. So, E0 is 5 V/m, E1 is -5 V/m.

In that case, when the reflected wave is in phase with the incident, the total E would be E0 + E1 = 0. That's when the two waves interfere constructively, leading to maximum amplitude. But that's not the case when we have a standing wave. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation. The incident wave is E0 sin(kz - ωt), and the reflected wave is E1 sin(kz + ωt). Because it's normal incidence, the reflection phase shift is π (180 degrees). So, the total field is E0 sin(kz - ωt) + E1 sin(kz + ωt).

Using superposition. Let me expand that:

sin(a - b) + sin(a + b) = 2 sin a cos b. So, if I set a = kz, b = ωt, then:

E_total = E0 sin(kz - ωt) + E1 sin(kz + ωt) = 2 E0 sin(kz) cos(ωt) + E1 sin(kz) cos(ωt) = [2 E0 + E1] sin(kz) cos(ωt).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the sum of sin(a - b) and sin(a + b) is 2 sin a cos b. So, here, a is kz, and b is ωt. So:

sin(kz - ωt) + sin(kz + ωt) = 2 sin kz cos ωt.

But our E0 is the incident amplitude, so it's E0 sin(kz - ωt). The reflected E1 is E1 sin(kz + ωt), but E1 is the amplitude, so the expression is E1 sin(kz + ωt). So, total is E0 sin(kz - ωt) + E1 sin(kz + ωt). Let me expand both terms:

E0 [sin kz cos ωt - cos kz sin ωt] + E1 [sin kz cos ωt + cos kz sin ωt]

= [E0 + E1] sin kz cos ωt + [ - E0 cos kz + E1 cos kz ] sin ωt

= [E0 + E1] sin kz cos ωt + [ (E1 - E0) cos kz ] sin ωt.

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the standing wave as a sum of a sine wave and a cosine wave. But maybe that's complicating things. Let me think again about the maximum and minimum values.

The maximum occurs when the two waves are in phase, leading to constructive interference. The minimum occurs when they are out of phase. But wait, let me think about the expression E_total.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the sum of the incident and reflected waves. Let me write them as:

E_incident = E0 sin(kz - ωt), E_reflected = E1 sin(kz + ωt).

So, E_total = E0 sin(kz - ωt) + E1 sin(kz + ωt).

Let me expand this:

= E0 [sin kz cos ωt - cos kz sin ωt] + E1 [sin kz cos ωt + cos kz sin ωt]

= [E0 sin kz + E1 sin kz] cos ωt + [ - E0 cos kz + E1 cos kz ] sin ωt

= [ (E0 + E1) sin kz ] cos ωt + [ (E1 - E0) cos kz ] sin ωt.

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to represent the sum in terms of a single sine function with a phase shift. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the maximum and minimum amplitudes.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the sum will have a maximum when the two individual terms are in phase, and a minimum when they are out of phase. But perhaps I can find E_max and E_min in terms of E0 and E1.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a standing wave with an amplitude that changes with position. The maximum amplitude would be when the two waves add up constructively, so E_incident + E_reflected. But wait, that's not correct because the incident and reflected waves are in phase, but their amplitudes are E0 and E1, so their sum is E0 + E1.

Similarly, the minimum amplitude occurs when the waves destructively interfere, so E0 - E1. But wait, that's only if they are in phase in the same direction. Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. I think the maximum electric field E_max is E0 + E1, and E_min is E0 - E1, but only if E1 is in the same phase as E0. But wait, no, because E1 is the reflection, which is 180 degrees out of phase. So, when the two waves are in phase (constructive interference), their amplitudes add, and when out of phase, their amplitudes subtract. So, in that case, the maximum E is E0 + E1, and the minimum is E0 - E1.

So, for part (b), E0 is 5 V/m, E1 is 1/10 V/m. So, E_max = 5 + 0.1 =5.1 V/m. E_min =5 -0.1=4.9 V/m.

But wait, wait. The question says E_1 is the amplitude of the reflected wave. When I think of a standing wave, the maximum and minimum are determined by the superposition. Wait, but in reality, the maximum is when the two waves add constructively (in phase), and the minimum when they destructively interfere. So, the maximum E is E_incident + E_reflected, and the minimum is E_incident - E_reflected.

Wait, but that's only when the two waves are in phase. So, if E1 is the amplitude of the reflected wave, which is 1/10 V/m. So, E1 could be positive or negative, depending on the phase. But since we're looking for the general case, perhaps E_1 is given as a positive amplitude, but considering phase, the maximum and minimum can be found.

Wait, but in this problem, part (b) is when E_1 equals 1/10 V/m. So, E_1 is 0.1 V/m. So, the maximum E would be 5 + 0.1 =5.1 V/m, and the minimum E would be 5 - 0.1 =4.9 V/m.

But wait, the standing wave ratio VSWR is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum amplitudes. So, VSWR = E_max / E_min = 5.1 / 4.9 ≈ 1.04. So, approximately 1.04.

Looking at the options, option C says VSWR is 1.04, which matches. So, for (b), the VSWR is approximately 1.04.

Now, part (c): E_1 is 3/5 V/m, which is 0.6 V/m. So, E_0 is 5, E_1 is 0.6.

E_max would be E0 + E1 =5.6 V/m.

E_min is E0 - E1 =5 -0.6=4.4 V/m.

Wait, but wait a second. But wait, in reality, when you have a standing wave, the maximum and minimum are determined by the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves, considering their phase. So, if E1 is the amplitude of the reflected wave, but whether it's in phase or not depends on the reflection coefficient.

Wait, the reflection coefficient Γ is E_1 / E_0. So, Γ = E1 / E0 = (3/5)/5 = 3/(5*5) = 3/25 = 0.12. So, Γ is positive 0.12, meaning the reflected wave is in phase with the incident wave (since Γ is positive, no inversion). Thus, the two waves are in phase.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for a pure standing wave, the reflected wave is in phase with the incident. So, in that case, when E_1 equals E_0, you get a standing wave. But in this case, E_1 is 0.6, which is less than E_0, so their phases are in phase. So, the maximum E is E0 + E1 and the minimum E is E0 - E1.

So, E_max =5.6 V/m, E_min=4.4 V/m.

Wait, but the options for (c) are different. Let's check the options again.

Looking at option C: (c) E_max=5.6 V, E_min=4.4 V. That's exactly what I calculated. So, option C's (c) matches.

Another option, option B: (c) E_max=6 V, E_min=4 V. That would be if E_1 was 1 V, which is not the case here.

So, the correct answer for (c) is E_max=5.6, E_min=4.4.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's (c) is E_max=5.6 and E_min=4.4, which matches.

So, to recap:

(a) Condition for pure standing wave: E1 must be equal in magnitude to E0 but opposite in phase. So, E1 = -E0. Since E0 is 5 V/m, E1 must be -5 V/m. So, condition is E1 = -5 V/m.

Looking at the options, option C says E1 is -5 V/m, so that's correct for (a).

(b) VSWR is (E0 + E1)/(E0 - E1). Since E0=5, E1=0.1, so (5.1)/(4.9) ≈1.04.

Option C says VSWR=1.04, which matches.

(c) E_max=5.6, E_min=4.4. So, option C's (c) is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has (c) as E_max=5.6, E_min=4.4. So, that's correct.

Wait, but another possible way to calculate VSWR is (E_max/E_min) or VSWR = (E0 + E1)/( |E0 - E1| ), but in this case, since E0 and E1 are in phase, the VSWR is (5+0.1)/(5-0.1) =5.1/4.9≈1.04, which is option C's value.

So, putting it all together: the correct options are (a) E1=-5, (b) VSWR=1.04, (c) E_max=5.6, E_min=4.4.

Looking at the options, option C has (a) E1=-5, (b) VSWR=1.04, (c) E_max=5.6, E_min=4.4.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

---

### Part (a): Condition for a Pure Standing Wave
A pure standing wave occurs when the reflected wave is an exact negative of the incident wave. This means the amplitude of the reflected wave \( E_1 \) must satisfy \( E_1 = -E_0 \), where \( E_0 \) is the amplitude of the incident wave. Since \( E_0 = 5 \, \text{V/m} \), the condition is \( E_1 = -5 \, \text{V/m} \).

---

### Part (b): Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWr)
The VSWR is defined as the ratio of the maximum electric field amplitude to the minimum electric field amplitude in the standing wave. For the given values:
- \( E_0 = 5 \, \text{V/m} \)
- \( E_1 = 0.1 \, \text{V/m} \)

The maximum electric field \( E_{\text{max}} \) is \( E_0 + E_1 = 5 + 0.1 = 5.1 \, \text{V/m} \), and the minimum electric field \( E_{\text{min}} \) is \( E_0 - E_1 = 5 - 0.1 = 4.9 \, \text{V/m} \). The VSWR is then:
\[
\text{VSWr} = \frac{E_{\text{max}}}{E_{\text{min}}} = \frac{5.1}{4.9} \approx 1.04
\]

---

### Part (c): Maximum and Minimum Electric Field Amplitudes
For the given values:
- \( E_0 = 5 \, \text{V/m} \)
- \( E_1 = 0.6 \, \text{V/m} \)

The maximum electric field \( E_{\text{max}} \) is \( E_0 + E_1 = 5 + 0.6 = 5.6 \, \text{V/m} \), and the minimum electric field \( E_{\text{min}} \) is \( E_0 - E_1 = 5 - 0.6 = 4.4 \, \text{V/m} \).

---

### Analysis of Options
- **Option C**:  
  - \( E_1 = -5 \, \text{V/m} \) (correct for a pure standing wave).  
  - \( \text{VSWr} = 1.04 \) (correct for \( E_1 = 0.1 \, \text{V/m} \)).  
  - \( E_{\text{max}} = 5.6 \, \text{V/m}, E_{\text{min}} = 4.4 \, \text{V/m} \) (correct for \( E_1 = 0.6 \, \text{V/m} \)).  

This matches all the calculations and answers the question appropriately.
