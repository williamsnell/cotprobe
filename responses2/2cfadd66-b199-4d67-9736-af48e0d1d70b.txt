Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about productivity and finding the optimal population level. Let me see if I can figure this out. Hmm, I remember that marginal physical product (MPP) and average physical product (APP) are concepts from microeconomics. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas though, but I think I can work through it.

The question gives me a table with population (in thousands), total physical product (in thousands of tons), and marginal physical product. Wait, but the table columns are labeled as "Population (Thousands)", "Total Physical Product (Thousand Tons)", "Marginal Physical Product (Thousand Tons)", and "Average Physical (Tons)". Oh, I see, so for each population level, we have the total output, and the change in output when adding one more person.

So, to find marginal physical product, I guess it's the change in total physical product when adding one more person. For example, when population goes from 1 to 2, the total goes from 10 to 22. So the marginal product would be 22 -10 =12 thousand tons. Similarly, from 2 to 3: 36-22=14. From 3 to4:52-36=16, and so on.

Wait, but the table shows the marginal physical product as "-", which I think means it's zero or not provided. So I need to compute those where available.

Then, the average physical product is total output divided by population. So for each population level, it's total / population.

But the first row (1 person) is 10 total, average is 10 tons per person, but MPP would be 10 (since it's the first person), but wait, maybe the MPP is the same as the total product because with only one person, the marginal is the same as the average.

But let me structure this step by step.

Let me list out the data.

Population (Thousands) | Total Physical Product (Thousand Tons) | Marginal Physical Product (Thousand Tons) | Average Physical Product (Tons)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 10 | - | 10
2 | 22 | 12 | 11 (22/2)
Wait, no, 22/2 is 11. Wait, but the table says Marginal Physical Product is "-", so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should compute each MPP and APP from the given data. Let me start.

Population 1: TP=10, so MPP would be 10 (since it's the first unit), and APP is 10.

Population 2: TP 22. So MPP is 22-10=12. And APP is 22/2=11.

Population 3: TP 36. MPP is 36-22=14. APP is 36/3=12.

Population 4: TP52. MPP52-36=16. APP52/4=13.

Population5: TP70. MPP70-52=18. APP70/5=14.

Population6: TP90. MPP90-70=20. APP90/6=15.

Population7: TP108. MPP108-90=18. APP108/7≈15.43.

Population8: TP124. MPP124-108=16. APP124/8=15.5.

Population9: TP135. MPP135-124=11. APP135/9=15.

Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I calculate each correctly.

Population 1: MPP is 10 (since it's the first unit, so no change from before). So MPP is 10, and APP is 10.

Population 2: TP increases by 12 from 10 to 22. So MPP is 12. APP is 22/2 =11.

Population3: TP goes from 22 to36. So 36-22=14. MPP14. APP36/3=12.

Population4: 36 to52. 16. 52/4 is 13. Yes.

Population5:52 to70. 18. 70/5=14.

Population6:70 to90. 20. 90/6=15.

Population7:90 to108. 18. 108/7≈15.428.

Population8:108 to124. 16. 124/8=15.5.

Population9:124 to135. 11. 135/9=15.

Wait, so the marginal physical product (MPP) is the change in total physical product when adding one more person. So for each population level (n), MPP(n) = TP(n) - TP(n-1).

Yes.

Now, the question is about the "optimum" population, which is the one with the highest per capita income. Per capita income is probably the average physical product, because per person productivity is what matters here. So the optimum point is where the average physical product is highest.

Looking at the table: The average physical product (APP) increases up to population7, then starts to decrease, right? Let me see.

Population1:10.

2:11.

3:12.

4:13.

5:14.

6:15.

7:15.428.

8:15.5.

9:15.

Wait, so it's increasing up to population7, which is the highest of all. So the highest average physical product is at population7.

So the optimum population is 7 thousand people.

Looking back at the options, option A is 7 thousand people. So the answer should be A.

To determine the "optimum" population level, we analyze the average physical product (APP), which represents the per capita productivity. The optimum population is the one with the highest APP.

### Calculations:
1. **Population 1**:  
   - Total Physical Product (TP) = 10  
   - Average Physical Product (APP) = TP / Population = 10 / 1 = 10

2. **Population 2**:  
   - TP = 22  
   - MPP = TP - TP_prev = 22 - 10 = 12  
   - APP = TP / Population = 22 / 2 = 11

3. **Population 3**:  
   - TP = 36  
   - MPP = 36 - 22 = 14  
   - APP = 36 / 3 = 12

4. **Population 4**:  
   - TP = 52  
   - MPP = 52 - 36 = 16  
   - APP = 52 / 4 = 13

5. **Population 5**:  
   - TP = 70  
   - MPP = 70 - 52 = 18  
   - APP = 70 / 5 = 14

6. **Population 6**:  
   - TP = 90  
   - MPP = 90 - 70 = 20  
   - APP = 90 / 6 = 15

7. **Population 7**:  
   - TP = 108  
   - MPP = 108 - 90 = 18  
   - APP = 108 / 7 ≈ 15.43

8. **Population 8**:  
   - TP = 124  
   - MPP = 124 - 108 = 16  
   - APP = 124 / 8 = 15.5

9. **Population 9**:  
   - TP = 135  
   - MPP = 135 - 124 = 11  
   - APP = 135 / 9 = 15

### Results:
- APP increases up to **Population 7**, where it reaches approximately 15.43.
- After **Population 7**, APP starts to decrease.

The highest average physical product (APP) occurs at **Population 7**, making it the "optimum" population level.
