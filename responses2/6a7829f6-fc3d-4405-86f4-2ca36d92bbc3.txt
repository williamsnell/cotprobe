Okay, so I have this question about Mr. Gordon and his frontal lobe damage. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says his back of his right frontal lobe is damaged. I remember that the frontal lobe is responsible for a lot of attention, memory, and executive functions. The different lobes are more specialized, like the temporal lobe for thinking, the parietal lobe for processing numbers and space, and the occipital lobe for vision. 

So, the frontal lobe specifically is involved in processing information, making decisions, and attention. If it's damaged, he might not be able to process certain tasks. Let's look at the options:

A: Recognize faces. The frontal lobe is involved in face recognition. So if it's damaged, he might not recognize faces.

B: Move his left hand. That involves motor skills and perhaps the parietal lobe. If the frontal lobe is affected, maybe he can't control his hand. So this might not be the answer.

C: Hear sounds correctly. That's the auditory part. The parietal lobe is involved in hearing, so if the frontal lobe is damaged, he might have trouble with sounds.

D: Understand information he reads. Reading involves visual processing, which is part of the occipital lobe. If the frontal lobe is damaged, maybe he can't read well.

E: Speak intelligibly. Speech involves motor skills and the brain's ability to control muscles. The frontal lobe is important for speech, so if it's damaged, he might have trouble speaking.

F: Taste food properly. Taste processing is also part of the parietal lobe. If the frontal lobe is affected, he might not be able to taste properly.

G: Understand information he hears. Since the parietal lobe handles sounds, if the frontal lobe is damaged, he might have trouble hearing sounds.

H: See clearly. Vision is done by the occipital lobe. If the frontal lobe is damaged, maybe he can't see well.

I: Feel temperature changes. Sensory processing is part of the parietal lobe, so if frontolobe is bad, he might have trouble with temperature.

J: Smell different scents. Smell is handled by the olfactory lobe, which is separate from the frontal lobe. So maybe he can't smell things properly.

Wait, the question says his back of the frontal lobe is damaged. So does that mean the left half? Or is it a general frontal lobe damage? I'm not sure if it's specifically on the left or right. But regardless, the key is which functions are related to the frontal lobe.

Let me think again. The options are about what he can't do. If the frontal lobe is damaged, he can't process information that requires attention, decision-making, or perhaps specific functions.

Looking at the options:

A: He can't recognize faces. Because face recognition is in the frontal lobe, so if it's damaged, he can't do that.

B: He can't move his left hand. That's more related to the parietal lobe, which handles movement.

C: He can't hear sounds. Parietal lobe is involved, so if the frontal lobe is damaged, he can't hear sounds.

D: He can't understand information he reads. Visual processing is occipital, so if frontolobe is affected, he might have trouble reading.

E: He can't speak. Speech depends on motor functions and the brain's ability to control muscles, which are involved in the frontal lobe. So if he can't process information, he can't speak.

F: Tastes differently. Parietal lobe handles taste, so if it's damaged, he can't taste.

G: Can't understand sounds. Parietal lobe is involved, so if the frontolobe is damaged, he can't hear sounds.

H: Can't see clearly. Vision is occipital, so if the frontolobe is affected, he might not see well.

I: Can't feel temperatures. Parietal lobe is involved in touch and temperature processing. So if frontolobe is bad, he might not feel correctly.

J: Can't smell scents. That's the olfactory lobe, which is separate. So if the frontal lobe is damaged, he can't smell.

Now, the options are each a possible function. The question is which one is he unable to do. So which of these functions is related to the frontal lobe.

The frontal lobe is involved in:

- Decision-making (maybe)
- Organization (organizing thoughts)
- Face recognition (A)
- Language (understanding information, which includes reading D)
- Processing sounds (C)
- Processing visual information (H)
- Processing taste (F)
- Processing touch (I)
- Processing emotions (although that's more parietal)
- Processing language and understanding (D)
- Processing motion and direction (B)
- Processing spatial reasoning (B)
- Processing emotions (maybe parietal)

So from the options, A, C, F, H, I, D, B, J are all possibilities. But the question is about the effect on the back of the frontal lobe. Wait, does the direction matter? The question says the back of the frontal lobe. The left frontal lobe is more involved in processing the left side of the brain. But perhaps the question is just referring to the general effect.

Wait, the question is about the back of his right frontal lobe. So the damage is in the right, but the effect on the functions would still apply.

So the options are A to J. The question is which of these he can't do.

Looking back at the options, the question is which function is he unable to do. So the correct answer would be the one that's related to the frontal lobe.

Option A: Recognize faces. That's a function of the frontal lobe.

Option C: Hear sounds correctly. Parietal lobe.

Option F: Taste food. Parietal.

Option J: Smell different scents. Olfactory lobe.

So the options A, C, F, J are related to the parietal lobe. The frontal lobe would affect A, C, F, J.

Wait, but the question is about the back of the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is divided into left and right. The right frontal lobe is more involved in certain functions, like attention to the right side, but the question just refers to the fact that the back of the frontal lobe is damaged, not the function.

So the key is the functions that require the frontal lobe's processing.

Option A: Recognize faces. That's a function of the frontal lobe.

Option C: Hear sounds. Parietal.

Option F: Taste. Parietal.

Option J: Smell. Olfactory, not fronto-para.

So the question is, which is he unable to do.

The options given are A to J. So the correct answer would be either A, C, F, or J.

But the question is about the back of the right frontal lobe. Wait, perhaps the question is more about which function is affected. So, for example, if the left and right are separate, the right might be affected in functions like the right semicircular canal, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A, because the frontal lobe is involved in face recognition, which is a primary cognitive function.

Alternatively, the question is about the effect, so the correct answer is related to the damage affecting the frontal lobe's processing.

So among the options, the correct answer is A: Recognize faces, or maybe C: Hear sounds, F: Taste, or J: Smell.

Wait, the question says 'he is unable to recognize faces'. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but some sources say that the right frontal lobe is more involved in attention to the right, but the question is about the ability to recognize faces, which is a general cognitive function that includes face recognition.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is C: He can't hear sounds because the parietal lobe handles that. But the question is about the right frontal lobe.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about which functions are affected. So the correct answer is A, because face recognition is a function of the frontal lobe. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another approach: The question is about which function the damage affects. So the correct answer is the one that is related to the damage. The damage is in the back of the right frontal lobe, which is the left half. But the functions might still apply.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because face recognition involves the frontal lobe, so without it, he can't recognize faces.

So I think the answer is A.

The question involves Mr. Gordon's inability to recognize faces due to damage to the back of his right frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for various cognitive functions, including face recognition. Among the options provided, face recognition is a primary cognitive function that the frontal lobe processes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
