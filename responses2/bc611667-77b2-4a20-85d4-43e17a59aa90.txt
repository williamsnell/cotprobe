Question:

Find the variance of the random variable, Z = X + Y if X and Y are not independent.

Options:

A: VarZ = VarX + VarY - 2E[{X - E(X)}{Y - E(Y)}]
B: VarZ = |VarX - VarY|
C: VarZ =VarX +VarY
D: VarZ = VarX + VarY + Cov(X,Y)
E: VarZ = (VarX + VarY) / 2
F: VarZ =VarX -VarY + 2E[{X - E(X)}{Y - E(Y)}]
G: VarZ = VarX * VarY
H: VarZ =VarX +VarY + 2E[{X - E(X)}{Y - E(Y)}]
I: VarZ =VarX +VarY + 2E[{X + E(X)}{Y + E(Y)}]
J: VarZ = VarX + VarY - 2Cov(X,Y)

Okay, so I have this question about variance when two variables are dependent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but let's see. The question is asking about the variance of Z, which is equal to X plus Y. And the options are from A to J.

I remember that when two variables are independent, the variance of their sum is just the sum of their variances. Because covariance is zero in that case. Like, Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY if X and Y are independent. But wait, the question says X and Y are not independent, so we have to account for their covariance.

Oh right, the general formula for variance of the sum of two variables is Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y). Because Cov(X,Y) is the covariance between X and Y. But wait, wait. No, wait, the formula is Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY + 2 Cov(X,Y). Because when you expand (X+Y)^2, you get X² + 2XY + Y², and the variance is E[X² + Y²] - (E[X] + E[Y})². Expanding that, the cross terms would involve Cov(X,Y).

Wait, another way to think about it is Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY + 2 Cov(X,Y). So that would be option D. Let me check the options again.

Option D says VarZ = VarX + VarY + Cov(X,Y). Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, wait, the correct formula is with a plus 2 Cov(X,Y). So the correct expression would be VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y). Looking at the options, option H is VarZ = VarX + VarY + 2E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]. But wait, wait. Because Cov(X,Y) is E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y})]. So option H is VarZ = VarX + VarY + 2E[(X-E[X})(Y-E[Y})]. But according to the formula, it's VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y).

Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure. The formula is Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y). So option D is VarX + VarY + Cov(X,Y), which is just the covariance without the 2. That can't be right. So option D is incorrect.

Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The correct formula is Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY + 2 Cov(X,Y). So looking at the options, option H says VarZ = VarX + VarY + 2E[(X-E[X})(Y-E[Y})]. Since 2E[XY - XEY - E[X]Y + E[X]E[Y}] = 2Cov(X,Y) + VarX + VarY. So option H is correct.

Wait, but let me look at all the options again. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me see the options again.

Option D: VarZ = VarX + VarY + Cov(X,Y) → that's missing the 2.

Option H: VarZ = VarX + VarY + 2E[(X-E[X})(Y-E[Y})] → but since Cov(X,Y) is that expectation, so 2 Cov(X,Y). So option H is correct.

Wait, but another thought. I remember that the covariance is defined as Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y})]. So option H is correct, because it's adding twice that term.

Wait, but looking back, option D is adding Cov(X,Y) without the 2. So the correct formula is VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y), which matches option H. But wait, let me double-check another source in my mind.

Oh wait, no, wait. The formula is Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y). So option D is wrong because it's missing the 2. Option H is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says VarZ = VarX + VarY + 2E[(X-E[X})(Y-E[Y})]. But since Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-E[X})(Y-E[Y})], so 2E[... ] is 2Cov, making option H correct. So the answer would be option H.

Wait, but another option is option G which says VarZ = VarX * VarY. No, that's product of variances, which is incorrect.

Option E is (VarX + VarY)/2. No, that's average, not variance.

Option J is VarZ = VarX + VarY -2 Cov(X,Y). That would be Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY - 2Cov, which is the formula for Var(X - Y), perhaps. Because Var(X - Y) = VarX + VarY - 2Cov(X,Y). So option J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The correct formula for the variance of the sum of two dependent random variables X and Y is Var(X+Y) = VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y). Among the options provided, option H correctly represents this formula, as it includes the covariance term multiplied by 2. Other options either omit the necessary factor or represent incorrect formulas.

Answer: H
