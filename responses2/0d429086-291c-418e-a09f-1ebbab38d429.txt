Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how Cobb should report their two trust funds. Let me start by understanding what each trust fund is used for because the problem gives some details.

The problem says that trust fund A can only have earnings used, meaning their earnings can't be used for debt service. Trust fund B, on the other hand, allows both principal and interest to be used, so that's a permanent asset.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the terminology. Trust funds are usually classified as different types. I remember that permanent assets are classified under certain headings. Let me think. 

Trust funds are typically classified as Capital projects. So each trust fund would be classified under Capital projects. But wait, the question is about how to report them. The options given are A to J. 

Looking at the options, I see that Capital projects is option C. But I should check if there are any nuances here. The problem states that only trust fund A's earnings can be used for debt service, which implies that A's earnings are considered debt service. But since trust funds themselves are assets, they should be reported as Capital projects. 

Wait, but another thought: trust funds are usually classified as Capital projects, right? Because they're intended to support the city's operations. So both A and B would be Capital projects. That would make option C the answer.

But wait, let me make sure. The options are:

A: Special revenue Special
B: Permanent Capital
C: Capital projects Capital
D: Debt service Debt
E: Permanent Permanent
F: Capital projects Permanent
G: Special revenue Permanent
H: Debt service Special revenue
I: Permanent Special revenue
J: Special revenue Debt service

So if both trust funds are Capital projects, then the correct option is C. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the question says that trust fund A's earnings can't be used for debt service, but that's about the funds, not the trust funds themselves. The question is about how to report the trust funds, so the classification of each trust fund.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the trust funds are classified differently. For example, if they are considered an asset, they're Capital projects; if they're a liability, they might be something else. But in this case, trust funds are assets, so they should be Capital projects.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the terminology. Let me think about the classifications: 

- Capital projects are for assets used to support the city's operations, like roads, water, etc.
- Permanent assets are like land, buildings, etc.
- Special revenue is for government aid, like grants or permits.
- Debt service might refer to obligations that are currently being incurred, like utilities or roads that are in use but not yet paid off.

But the problem says that only trust fund A's earnings can be used for debt service. That probably means that A's funds are not a debt that needs to be paid off, but rather are income that can be used for expenses. So the trust funds themselves are assets and should be classified as Capital projects.

Wait, let me re-read the question to make sure I'm not missing anything. The question asks how to report each trust fund, and the options are combinations of their classifications. So for Trust fund A, since it's an asset, it's a Capital project. Trust fund B is also an asset, so it's a Capital project.

Looking at the options, option C says "Capital projects Capital projects." That's the combination for both A and B. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but why is my initial thought that it's Capital projects for both? Because the question gives the two options as separate, but the options themselves are combinations. So the correct option is option C: Capital projects Capital projects.

The city of Cobb should report each trust fund as a Capital project. Trust fund A's earnings can be used for debt service, but the trust funds themselves are classified as Capital projects because they support the city's operations. 

Answer: C
