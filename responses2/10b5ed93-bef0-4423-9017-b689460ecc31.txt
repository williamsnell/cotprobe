Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about calculating the average atomic mass of chromium. Hmm, I remember that average atomic mass has something to do with weighted averages based on the isotopic abundance. Let me think through this step by step.

So the problem gives me four isotopic forms of chromium. Oh right, their atomic masses and the percent occurrences are provided. I need to calculate the average. Wait, the formula for average atomic mass is the sum of (isotopic mass * percent abundance) divided by the total percent, which should be 100%, right?

Looking at the data:

The isotopes are:
- 50 amu, 4.31%
- 52 amu, 83.76%
- 53 amu, 9.55%
- 54 amu, 2.38%

Wait, but sometimes I've seen isotopic data presented as percentages without the percent sign, and sometimes as a fraction. Oh wait, the problem says 'percent occurrence', so I can take those percentages as decimals when multiplying.

So I need to multiply each isotope's mass by its abundance. Let's make a table:

Isotope | Mass (amu) | Percent | Decimal Abundance
--------|------------|-------|-------------------
50     | 50         | 4.31%  | 0.0431
52     | 52         | 83.76% | 0.8376
53     | 53         | 9.55%  | 0.0955
54     | 54         | 2.38%  | 0.0238

Now, multiply each mass by its abundance:

50 * 0.0431 = Let's compute that. 50 * 0.04 is 2, 0.0031 *50 is 0.155, so total is 2.155 amu.

52 * 0.8376. Let me compute 52 * 0.8 = 41.6, 52 *0.0376= approximately 1.9552. So 41.6 +1.9552=43.5552.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 52 * 0.8376. Let's do 50 * 0.8376 = 41.88, plus 2 *0.8376 = 1.6752. So 41.88 +1.6752=43.5552.

Next, 53 *0.0955. Let's see: 50 *0.0955 is 4.775, 3 *0.0955 is 0.2865. So 4.775 +0.2865=5.0615.

Then, 54 *0.0238. 54 *0.02=1.08, 54 *0.0038=0.2052. So 1.08 +0.2052=1.2852.

Now sum all these up. Let me add them step by step.

Start with first two: 2.155 +43.5552 =45.7102.

Add the third: 45.7102 +5.0615 =50.7717.

Add the last: 50.7717 +1.2852=52.0569.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check each multiplication to be accurate.

First, 50 * 0.0431: 50 *0.0431= 2.155 amu.

Second, 52 *0.8376: 52 *0.8=41.6, and 52 *0.0376 is 52 *0.03=1.56, 52 *0.0076=0.3952. So 1.56+0.3952=1.9552. So 41.6+1.9552=43.5552.

Third, 53 * 0.0955: 50 *0.0955=4.775, 3*0.0955=0.2865. Sum 4.775+0.2865=5.0615.

Fourth, 54 *0.0238: 50 *0.0238=1.19, 4*0.0238=0.0952. Sum 1.19+0.0952=1.2852.

Adding all up:

2.155 +43.5552 =45.7102.

45.7102 +5.0615=50.7717.

50.7717 +1.2852=52.0569.

So the average atomic mass is approximately 52.0569 amu.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option E: 52.057 amu. That's exactly what I got.

To calculate the average atomic mass of chromium, we use the formula for weighted average:  
\[
\text{Average atomic mass} = \sum (\text{isotopic mass} \times \text{percent abundance})
\]  
The isotopes and their data are:  
- 50 amu, 4.31%  
- 52 amu, 83.76%  
- 53 amu, 9.55%  
- 54 amu, 2.38%  

First, convert the percent abundances to decimals:  
- 50 amu: 0.0431  
- 52 amu: 0.8376  
- 53 amu: 0.0955  
- 54 amu: 0.0238  

Next, calculate the contribution of each isotope to the average:  
1. \( 50 \times 0.0431 = 2.155 \, \text{amu} \)  
2. \( 52 \times 0.8376 = 43.5552 \, \text{amu} \)  
3. \( 53 \times 0.0955 = 5.0615 \, \text{amu} \)  
4. \( 54 \times 0.0238 = 1.2852 \, \text{amu} \)  

Sum these contributions:  
\[
2.155 + 43.5552 + 5.0615 + 1.2852 = 52.0569 \, \text{amu}.
\]  

The closest option to this value is **52.057 amu**, which corresponds to option E.
