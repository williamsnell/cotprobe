Okay, so I have this linear algebra problem to solve. The question is asking for which 2x2 matrices A there exists a nonzero matrix M such that AM = MD, where D is the diagonal matrix [[2,0],[0,3]]. And the answer needs to be given in terms of the eigenvalues of A. The options are labeled from A to J, each being a pair of numbers.

Hmm, let me think. So, the equation is AM = MD. Let me write that down: AM = MD. I need to find the conditions on A such that this equation holds for some nonzero M.

Wait, let's rearrange this equation. If I multiply both sides on the right by M inverse, assuming M is invertible, but wait, M could be singular. Hmm, but the equation is AM = MD. Let me see, maybe I can factor this. Let's consider that (A - λI)M = λM, where λ is an eigenvalue of D? Or is that similar?

Wait, D is diagonal with entries 2 and 3. So, D is a scaling matrix. So, if I think of AM = MD, maybe M is a matrix that represents the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of D. Because D acting on a vector scales it by 2 and 3.

Wait, let's think about eigenvalues. Suppose that M is a matrix of eigenvectors of A. Then, AM would be the matrix of eigenvalues of A multiplied by M. So, AM = M (eigenvalues matrix). But in the equation, it's AM = MD. So, M (eigenvalues matrix) = M D. So, if M is invertible, then eigenvalues matrix = D. But the eigenvalues matrix of A is D, which has eigenvalues 2 and 3. So, that would mean that the eigenvalues of A are 2 and 3.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues of A would just be the diagonal entries of D because D is diagonal. So, since D is diagonal, the eigenvalues of A must be 2 and 3.

Alternatively, perhaps this is about simultaneous diagonalization. If A and D are simultaneously diagonalizable, then there exists an invertible matrix M such that both AM and MD are diagonal. But wait, in our case, AM equals MD. So, that suggests that both AM and MD are equal, which would mean that both are diagonal matrices when M is applied. So, if A and D are simultaneously diagonalizable, then M would be a matrix of eigenvectors of A, such that AM is diagonal, and M D is also diagonal, so they are equal.

Wait, but D is already diagonal. So, for this to hold, A must be diagonalizable in the same basis as D, which is the standard basis here since D is diagonal. So, A must have the same eigenvalues as D, which are 2 and 3. Because when you multiply A by M (the eigenvectors), you get the eigenvalues times M, and M D would be the eigenvalues times M as well, since D is diagonal. So, for this equality to hold, the eigenvalues of A must equal the eigenvalues of D, which are 2 and 3.

But wait, is that the only condition? Let's think again. Suppose A is diagonalizable with eigenvalues 2 and 3. Then, there exists a matrix M (of eigenvectors) such that AM = MD. So, M would be the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A corresponding to eigenvalues 2 and 3. Then, multiplying A by M would scale each column by its eigenvalue, giving a diagonal matrix. Similarly, M D would be M multiplied by D, which is scaling the eigenvectors by 2 and 3, respectively, resulting in the same diagonal matrix.

Wait, so that works. So, for any A that is diagonalizable with eigenvalues 2 and 3, there exists such an M. But wait, no, because if A has repeated eigenvalues, it might not be diagonalizable, but here since D has distinct eigenvalues (2 and 3), A must have both 2 and 3 as eigenvalues for this condition to hold.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's write the equation AM = MD. Let me rearrange it as AM - MD = 0 → A M = M D. Let's factor M out. Wait, no, that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps think of it as (A - λD) M = 0 for each eigenvalue λ of D. But since D has two distinct eigenvalues, 2 and 3, M must satisfy both (A - 2D)M = 0 and (A - 3D)M = 0.

Wait, but if M is non-zero, then the matrices (A - 2D) and (A - 3D) must have a non-trivial kernel. That is, their null spaces must contain non-zero vectors. Which would happen if A - 2D and A - 3D are singular, i.e., if their determinants are zero.

Wait, but for (A - 2D) M = 0 and (A - 3D)M = 0, M must be in the null space of both A - 2D and A - 3D. So, for both (A - 2D) and (A - 3D) to have a non-trivial null space, their determinants must be zero. But the determinant of (A - λD) would be zero if A has λ as an eigenvalue, but wait, D is diagonal with entries 2 and 3, so (A - λD) is a matrix whose eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of A minus λ. So, for (A - 2D) and (A - 3D) to be singular, their determinants must be zero. So, the eigenvalues of A must satisfy that (A - 2D) is singular and (A - 3D) is singular.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. If AM = MD, then for each eigenvector v of D with eigenvalue λ, we have Av = M D v. But D v is λ v, so A v = M λ v. So, (A - λ I) v = (M - λ I) v. Wait, that might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, if I think of M as a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, then for each eigenvalue λ of A, M v = v, where v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ, and M D would scale each eigenvector by its eigenvalue, so AM would also scale each eigenvector by λ. So, M must be such that it's a matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of A with corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: Suppose that A is diagonalizable. Then, there exists a basis where A is diagonal. Let me suppose that A is diagonal, with entries 2 and 3. Then, any matrix M would satisfy AM = MD. Because A is diagonal, AM would be M times the diagonal entries, and MD would also be M times the diagonal entries. So, for diagonal A, any M would satisfy AM = MD.

But the question is about matrices A that are not necessarily diagonal. However, for the equation AM = MD to hold, M must be such that when you multiply it by A, it's equivalent to multiplying M by D. That suggests that M is a matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of A, and when multiplied by D, which has eigenvalues on the diagonal, this equals AM.

Wait, perhaps for any A that can be simultaneously diagonalized with D, meaning that A is diagonalizable and M is the matrix of eigenvectors. But in this case, D is diagonal, so any matrix A that is diagonalizable with D as the basis would satisfy this condition.

But wait, another way: Since D is diagonal, and M is a matrix such that AM = MD, this implies that for each eigenvalue λ of A, M v = (A v) / λ, where v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ. But since D v = λ v, then perhaps M D v = M λ v. But AM v = A (M v) = A ( (A v)/λ ) = (A^2 v)/λ. But MD v = M (λ v) = λ M v. So, (A^2 v)/λ = λ M v. Hmm, not sure if that's leading anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation AM = MD can be rewritten as M (A) = M (D). So, M (A - D) = 0. But since M is non-zero, (A - D) must have a non-trivial kernel, meaning that (A - D) is singular. So, the determinant of (A - D) must be zero. But D is diagonal, so (A - D) is a matrix with entries (A_ij - D_ij). So, the determinant of this matrix must be zero.

Wait, but D has 2 and 3, so the diagonal entries are 2 and 3. So, for (A - D) to be singular, the determinant of (A - D) must be zero. But determinant of (A - D) is the product of (A_ii - 2) and (A_jj - 3) for the diagonal entries, assuming A is diagonal. But A is a general 2x2 matrix, not necessarily diagonal.

Wait, but if A is not diagonal, then (A - D) is a general matrix, and its determinant is zero. So, the determinant of (A - 2I) and (A - 3I) must satisfy that their product is zero. But that would require that either (A - 2I) is singular, or (A - 3I) is singular, or both.

Wait, but maybe that's not the right approach either. Let me think again. If AM = MD, then for each vector v in the column space of M, M (A v) = M (D v). So, M (A v - D v) = 0. Since M is non-zero, the vectors A v - D v must be in the null space of M. But M is non-zero, so for some v, A v - D v is in the null space. But that might not help directly.

Another strategy: Let me consider the block form of M. Since AM = MD, and D is diagonal, perhaps I can write M as a matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of A. Let me suppose that M has columns u and w, which are eigenvectors of A corresponding to eigenvalues λ and μ. Then, AM would be a matrix where each column is A u and A w, which are λ u and μ w. On the other hand, MD would be D times M, which is [2u, 3w]. So, for AM = MD, we have:

λ u = 2 u,
μ w = 3 w.

Wait, so that implies that λ must be 2 and μ must be 3. So, in this case, M must consist of eigenvectors of A corresponding to eigenvalues 2 and 3. But for that to be possible, A must have both 2 and 3 as eigenvalues. Because otherwise, M can't have both u and w as eigenvectors.

So, the conclusion is that A must have both 2 and 3 as eigenvalues. Because if A only had one eigenvalue, say 2, then any M would have to have u and w as eigenvectors corresponding to 2, but that's not possible unless u and w are the same vector, but then M would be rank 1, which is non-zero. Wait, but then if A has only one eigenvalue, say 2, then M would be a scalar multiple of the projection onto the eigenvector. But then, AM would be 2M, and MD would be 2M, so it's possible. So, perhaps A can have a single eigenvalue, but in that case, M would have to be a scalar multiple of the projection matrix onto the eigenvector. Hmm, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for AM = MD, the eigenvalues of A must be 2 and 3. Because if A has an eigenvalue other than 2 or 3, then when you multiply by M, you might not get the same result. Wait, let me think. Suppose A has an eigenvalue λ != 2 or 3. Then, when we have AM = MD, the eigenvalues of AM would be 2 and 3. But the eigenvalues of AM are the products of the eigenvalues of A and M. Wait, no, that's not right. Because AM is a product of A and M, which are matrices, but M is not necessarily diagonal. So, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to ensure that AM = MD is that the eigenvalues of A are exactly 2 and 3. Because then, when you multiply by M, which is the matrix of eigenvectors, you get the scaled eigenvalues. So, for any M that's a combination of eigenvectors corresponding to 2 and 3, AM will be MD.

Wait, but if A had a repeated eigenvalue, say 2, then it might not be diagonalizable, so M would have to be a projection matrix, but in that case, maybe it's still possible. But the question is about matrices A for which such an M exists. So, perhaps all matrices A for which AM = MD for some M is equivalent to A having both 2 and 3 as eigenvalues. Because if A has both 2 and 3, then there's a matrix M that is the projection matrix onto the eigenspaces, and then AM = MD, because M is the matrix of eigenvectors, and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the eigenvalues of A are 2 and 3. Because then, any matrix M can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors, and AM would scale each eigenvector by its eigenvalue, and MD would as well. So, that would satisfy AM = MD.

So, the matrices A must have both 2 and 3 as eigenvalues. Looking at the options, each option is a pair of numbers, which I assume are the eigenvalues of A. So, the answer is the set of options where both 2 and 3 are eigenvalues.

Looking at the options:

A: [1, 2] → 1 and 2. Missing 3. So, doesn't have both 2 and 3. So, A is out.

B: [3,4] → 3 and 4. Missing 2. So, doesn't have both.

C: [2,4] → 2 and 4. Missing 3. So, out.

D: [2,3] → both present. So, this is possible. So, this is a candidate.

E: [1,3] → 1 and 3. Missing 2. Out.

F: [6,7] → both present. So, this is another candidate.

G: [0,1] → both present. So, another candidate.

H: [4,5] → both present. So, candidate.

I: [5,6] → both present. So, candidate.

J: [3,5] → both present. So, candidate.

So, the options that have both 2 and 3 are C, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, but the question is to give the eigenvalues of A in terms of options, and the answer should be given in terms of the eigenvalues of A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is all options where both 2 and 3 are eigenvalues, but the question is more about the condition on A, not on the specific options. So, the options are the possible pairs of eigenvalues of A, and the correct choices are those pairs that include both 2 and 3.

So, the correct options are C, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is: "For which 2 * 2 matrices A does there exist a nonzero matrix M such that AM = MD..." So, the answer is all 2x2 matrices A whose eigenvalues include both 2 and 3. So, the correct option is any of the pairs that contain both 2 and 3. The options are A to J, so the answer could be any of C, F, G, H, I, J.

But the question is to select the correct answer from the options given. However, the options are single letters, so perhaps the intended answer is that the eigenvalues of A must be 2 and 3. So, looking at the options, the correct letters are C, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, but the options are the eigenvalues of A. So, the answer is that the eigenvalues are 2 and 3, so any of the options that include both 2 and 3 are correct.

But the question says "which 2x2 matrices A", so the correct answer is all matrices A whose eigenvalues are 2 and 3, which is any option that includes both 2 and 3.

Looking at the options:

A: [1,2] → 2 is present, but 3 is missing. So, no.

B: [3,4] → 3 is present, 2 is missing. No.

C: [2,4] → 2 and 4. 3 is missing. No.

D: [2,3] → both present. Yes.

E: [1,3] → 3 is present, 2 is missing. No.

F: [6,7] → both present. Yes.

G: [0,1] → both present. Yes.

H: [4,5] → both present. Yes.

I: [5,6] → both present. Yes.

J: [3,5] → both present. Yes.

So, the correct options are D, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "give your answer in terms of eigenvalues of A." So, the answer is that the eigenvalues of A are 2 and 3, so any option that includes both.

But the options are labeled A to J, each a pair. So, the correct answers would be D, F, G, H, I, J.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are:

A: [1,2]

B: [3,4]

C: [2,4]

D: [2,3]

E: [1,3]

F: [6,7]

G: [0,1]

H: [4,5]

I: [5,6]

J: [3,5]

So, the answer is any of the options except A, B, C, E, which don't include both 2 and 3.
</think>

The equation AM = MD requires that A have eigenvalues 2 and 3. Therefore, the correct options are those that include both 2 and 3. The correct answers are:

D: [2,3], F: [6,7], G: [0,1], H: [4,5], I: [5,6], J: [3,5].

ANSWER: D, F, G, H, I, J
