Okay, so I have this question about finding the market supply curve for a good. Hmm, I remember that supply curves are about how much a firm is willing to produce at different prices. But wait, the question is about the market supply curve, not an individual firm's supply.

Let me think. The market supply curve is the total quantity that all firms together are willing to produce at each price. So, I need to aggregate the individual firm's supply. How do you aggregate individual curves into a market one? I think it's by adding them up, so you sum up the quantities each firm is willing to supply at each price.

Looking at the options: A is vertical aggregate of firm revenues. No, revenue curves are about total revenue, not quantity. So probably not A. B is horizontal aggregate of firm supply. Wait, horizontal addition usually refers to something like adding horizontal lines, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, no. If you aggregate supply curves horizontally, that would mean adding the quantities each firm is willing to produce at each price. So each firm's supply is a curve, and to find the market supply, you add up the quantities all firms would supply at each price. So that's adding vertically, I think. No, wait, no. Let me clarify.

Each firm's supply is a curve showing quantity per price. If you aggregate all firms' supply together, you add up the quantities each firm is willing to produce at each price level. That would be adding the curves vertically, not horizontally. So for example, at a given price, each firm might supply a certain quantity. Adding all those together gives the market supply at that price.

So that would be adding the individual firm supply curves. So looking at the options, option B says aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the market supply is the sum of all individual firm supplies at each price. So if you have multiple firms, each with their own supply curve, the market supply is the sum of these curves. So it's like adding up each firm's supply at each price point. So the process is to sum the quantities each firm is willing to produce at each price.

So the correct way is to aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally. Wait, why? Because when you have multiple curves, horizontal addition implies summing the quantities at each price. So for every price, you take each firm's quantity and add them together. So the market supply curve is made by adding up all the individual firm supply curves at each price level.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally. That would mean adding the quantities, so yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but wait another thought. I remember that the market supply is the sum of all individual firm supplies. That's the same as adding the individual supply curves horizontally, because for each price, you add the quantities.

So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are:

A: vertical aggregate of firm revenues
B: horizontal aggregate of firm supply
C: vertical aggregate of firm demand
D: horizontal aggregate of marginal revenue
E: vertical aggregate of marginal cost
F: horizontal aggregate of firm revenue
G: horizontal demand
H: horizontal marginal cost
I: vertical marginal revenue
J: vertical supply

So the correct one is B, because aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally. That is, for each price, sum the quantities each firm is willing to supply. So the total quantity from all firms at that price is the market supply. So that's adding up, which is horizontal addition. So yes, B.
</think>

The correct answer is B: aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally. 

**Explanation:**
The market supply curve is derived by summing up the individual firm supply curves at each price level. This is achieved by horizontally aggregating the firm supply curves, meaning for each price, you add the quantities each firm is willing to produce. 

Answer: B
