Okay, I've got this question here about figuring out how many teams are in a tournament with 393 players, and each team has 3 players. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the question is asking for the number of teams. I remember that to find the number of teams when you know the total number of players and the number of players per team, you divide the total number of players by the number of players per team. That makes sense because each team has the same number of players, so it's just a matter of splitting the total into equal groups.

Let me write this down. The formula would be Number of Teams = Total Players / Players per Team. So, plugging in the numbers from the problem, that would be 393 divided by 3. 

Looking at the options given, I need to find which one equals 393 ÷ 3. Let me check each option:

Option A: 3 + 393. That would be 396, which is way too big because adding the number of teams and players doesn't make sense here. So, A is incorrect.

Option B: 3 × 393. That would give 1179, which is even larger. Multiplying doesn't fit here because we're looking for division to split into equal groups.

Option C: (393 - 3) × 3. That's 390 × 3 = 1170. Subtracting the team size from the total and multiplying doesn't seem right either. I don't think subtracting in this context would help.

Option D: 393 ÷ 3. Oh, that's exactly what I thought. Dividing the total number of players by the number per team gives the number of teams. So D seems correct.

Option E: (393 + 3) ÷ 3. That's 396 ÷ 3 = 132. Adding the team size to the total and then dividing by 3 doesn't make sense in this scenario. It would be like adding extra players, which isn't part of the problem.

Option F: 393 × 3. That's 1179, same as option B. Multiplying again doesn't make sense for this division problem.

Option G: 393 + 3. That's 396, same as E. Again, that's adding, not dividing.

Option H: 393 - 3. That gives 390. Subtracting the team size doesn't help in this case; it wouldn't tell me how many teams there are.

Option I: 3 - 393. That's a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context because you can't have a negative number of teams. So I can rule this out.

Option J: 3 ÷ 393. That's a very small number, like 0.0076, which is clearly not the number of teams. It would be the reciprocal of 393, but that's not relevant here.

So, going through each option, D is the only one that correctly uses division to solve the problem. Each team has 3 players, so dividing the total number of players by 3 gives the number of teams. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

The correct expression is D: 393 ÷ 3.
