Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Let's see what it's about. The question states that gold ions are colliding head-on with each other, and each gold ion has an energy of 100 GeV per nucleon. I need to find the speed of each gold ion as a fraction of the speed of light. The options are A through J, each a decimal number.

Hmm, I remember that in high-energy physics, when dealing with particles like ions colliding, you have to consider relativistic effects because their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The energy given is the energy per nucleon, which is good because it simplifies the calculation.

Wait, gold is an atomic nucleus. The atomic number of gold is 79, right? So each gold ion has 79 protons and 79 neutrons, making it an isotope with a mass number of 197 (since 79 + 118 = 197?). So the mass of a single gold ion is the mass of a proton plus a neutron. But wait, protons and neutrons are both approximately the same mass, so the mass of a gold nucleus is roughly equal to its atomic mass number. So each gold ion has a mass of about 197 atomic mass units.

Now, the energy given is 100 GeV per nucleon. So for each gold ion, the energy per nucleon is 100 GeV. Since each ion has 79 nucleons, the total energy per ion would be 100 GeV * 79 = 7900 GeV. But wait, that's the total energy, but I might need the kinetic energy instead. Because in relativistic terms, the total energy (E) of a particle is the sum of its rest energy (m c²) and its kinetic energy (K). So E = K + m c².

But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, the rest mass energy (m c²) is much smaller than the kinetic energy, so we might approximate E ≈ K. But wait, in this case, each gold ion's energy is given per nucleon. Oh, right, the problem states "energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon." So each nucleon has 100 GeV of energy. But wait, that's the total energy, I think. Because in reality, when a particle is accelerated, its total energy (including rest mass) would be higher. But perhaps in this problem, they've given the kinetic energy per nucleon.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy per nucleon is 100 GeV. So each nucleon is moving with 100 GeV of energy. But wait, the rest mass energy for a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 0.938 GeV. So each nucleon's total energy would be its rest mass plus kinetic energy. So K = E - m c². So K = 100 GeV - 0.938 GeV = 99.062 GeV. But wait, but the problem says "energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon." Oh, so maybe the total energy (K) is 100 GeV. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ion's kinetic energy as 100 GeV per nucleon, so the total kinetic energy is 100 * 79 = 7900 GeV. But then I need to find the speed of each ion.

Wait, but maybe I should model it as the kinetic energy. So the ion is moving at a speed v such that its kinetic energy is 100 GeV per nucleon, multiplied by 79.

But the kinetic energy in relativistic terms is given by K = (gamma - 1) m c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So gamma is (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

Wait, but let's think about each nucleon. The mass of a nucleon is m_n ≈ 1.674927471e-27 kg. So the rest mass energy is m_n c². For one nucleon, that's about 0.938 GeV.

The problem says each nucleon has 100 GeV. So that's the total energy. So the total energy E for each nucleon is 100 GeV. So gamma is (E / m_n c²) = 100 GeV / 0.938 GeV ≈ 106.54. Hmm, wait, no. Because gamma is (E)/(m c²). So E is given as 100 GeV, so gamma = (100 GeV) / (0.938 GeV) ≈ 106.54.

So gamma is approximately 106.54.

Now, gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v:

gamma = 106.54 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 106.54

Taking reciprocal: sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 106.54 ≈ 0.009385.

Squaring both sides: 1 - v²/c² ≈ (0.009385)^2 ≈ 0.000088.

So v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.000088 = 0.999912.

Taking square root: v/c ≈ sqrt(0.999912) ≈ approximately 0.999956.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.009385^2. 0.009385 * 0.009385.

Compute 0.009 * 0.009 = 0.000081.

0.000385 * 0.009385 = approximately 0.00000359 (since 0.000385 is approximately 3.85e-4, and 0.009385 is about 9.385e-3. Multiply them: 3.85e-4 * 9.385e-3 ≈ 3.6e-6. Wait, but wait, 0.009385 is about 9.385e-3, not 3.85e-4.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.009385^2 more accurately.

Wait, 0.009385 is 9.385e-3. So (9.385e-3)^2 = (9.385)^2 * 1e-6.

9.385 squared: 9^2=81, 0.385^2≈0.148, 2*9*0.385=6.93. So 81 + 6.93 + 0.148 ≈ 88.078. So 88.078 * 1e-6 = 0.000088078.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.000088078.

So v²/c² = 1 - 0.000088078 = 0.999911922.

Taking square root:

v/c = sqrt(0.999911922) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(0.999911922).

We can approximate this using the Taylor expansion sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x, but here x is 1 - 0.999912 = 0.000088.

Wait, better to use the binomial approximation.

Wait, let me think. Since x is small, where x = 0.000088 (about 8.8e-5), then sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - (x^2)/8 - ... but perhaps a better way is to find sqrt( a ), where a is close to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

v²/c² = 0.999911922.

Compute v/c.

We can compute this as follows. Let me compute the square root.

We can think of 0.999911922 as 1 - 0.000088078.

The square root of (1 - y) is approximately 1 - y/2 - y²/8 - y³/16, for small y.

So y = 0.000088078.

Compute y/2 = 0.000044039.

y² is (0.000088)^2 ≈ 7.74e-9. Divided by 8 is 9.675e-10.

y^3 is (0.000088)^3 ≈ about 6.81e-11. Divided by 16 is about 4.26e-12.

So up to the second order:

sqrt(1 - y) ≈ 1 - y/2 - y²/8.

So,

1 - 0.000044039 = 0.999955961.

Subtract y²/8: 0.999955961 - 9.675e-10 → approximately 0.999955961 - 0.0000000009675 = 0.999955960.

So v/c ≈ 0.99995596, approximately 0.999956.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.99996, which is about 0.99996, so that's the closest.

Wait, wait, but I should double-check. Let me compute the exact calculation without approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using more precise methods.

But perhaps I should think about whether I considered the correct approach. Because in reality, the speed of the ion is determined by the relativistic energy.

Wait, another approach: The total energy per nucleon is 100 GeV. Since each nucleon's rest mass is about 0.938 GeV (for a proton), the total energy is K + m c² = 100 GeV. So K = 99.062 GeV. So the gamma factor is (K + m c²)/(m c²) = (100 GeV)/(0.938 GeV) ≈ 106.54. So that's correct.

So gamma is 106.54. Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) = 1/106.54 ≈ 0.009385.

So 1 - v²/c² = (0.009385)^2 ≈ 0.000088078.

Then v²/c² = 1 - 0.000088078 = 0.999911922.

So v/c = sqrt(0.999911922) ≈ approximately 0.999956.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.99996. That's the closest. So the answer should be E.

To determine the speed of the gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light, we start by noting that each gold ion has a total energy of 100 GeV per nucleon. The atomic mass number of gold is 197, so each ion contains 79 nucleons (protons and neutrons). The rest mass energy of a nucleon is approximately 0.938 GeV. 

The total energy of each nucleon is given as 100 GeV, which includes both its rest energy and kinetic energy. The total energy per nucleon is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 100 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The rest mass energy of a nucleon is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 0.938 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The total energy per nucleon is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = K + E_{\text{rest}}.
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy per nucleon is:

\[
K = E_{\text{total}} - E_{\text{rest}} = 100 \, \text{GeV} - 0.938 \, \text{GeV} = 99.062 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

In relativistic terms, the total energy is related to the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{E_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{100 \, \text{GeV}}{0.938 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 106.54.
\]

The Lorentz factor is also given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Rearranging for \(v/c\), we have:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2},
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
\]

Substituting \(\gamma \approx 106.54\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{1}{(106.54)^2} \approx 0.00008808,
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.00008808 \approx 0.99991192.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v/c \approx \sqrt{0.99991192} \approx 0.999956.
\]

This value corresponds to approximately \(v/c = 0.99996\). Comparing this to the options provided, the closest match is:

**E: 0.99996**
