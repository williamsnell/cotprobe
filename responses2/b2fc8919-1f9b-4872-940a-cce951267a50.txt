Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this accounting question. Let me read it again.

The question is about Arno Co., which didn't record a credit purchase of merchandise before the year-end. But when they did do the physical inventory, they included all that merchandise. The question is, what effect did the omission have on the balance sheet at year-end?

Hmm, so in accounting, when a company doesn't record an expense or a liability, it can affect the financial statements. Let's think about the accounting cycle.

When a company makes a credit purchase, that's an account for accounts receivable or maybe something else? Wait, no, the purchase would be recorded when it's received payment. Oh wait, no, purchases are actually when they pay for something on credit. So the initial recording is when the company makes the purchase. But wait, no, the initial recording is when they receive payment, right? Or is it when they make the sale?

Wait, no, purchases are recorded when they pay for the goods. Or is it when they receive payment? Hmm. Let me get this straight. When a company buys inventory on credit, it's a liability because it's expecting to receive payment later. So the initial recording would be when the company records the purchase as an account receivable or something else. Wait, no, no, when you make a credit purchase, you debit an account and credit another. So the initial recording is when the payment is made, right? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. When a company purchases goods on credit, that's an account that's recorded as a liability, like accounts receivable. So the initial step is to record the purchase as a liability. So if Arno Co. didn't record this at all, that would mean they didn't recognize the liability. 

Then, when they did do the physical inventory, they included all the goods. But wait, if they didn't record the purchase, that means their accounts are understated. Because if a purchase isn't recorded, the liability (like accounts receivable) isn't recorded. So if they forgot to record it, their assets would be understated because the liability is not recorded. 

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say they have a purchase of $1,000 on credit. They are supposed to record this as an account (maybe accounts receivable) and expense it. But if they didn't record this, the accounts would be incorrect. Then, when they do the physical inventory, they include all the goods. But since the purchase wasn't recorded, their inventory is overstated? Or understated?

Wait, no, the physical count is correct. So if the purchase wasn't recorded, the accounts would have an understated balance because the liability (accounts receivable) isn't recorded. Let's see:

- The purchase is a credit, so the company's liability increases. If they didn't record it, their liability is understated. So assets would be understated because they have incorrect accounts.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a company records a credit purchase, it's an asset (or liability) and expense. For example, when you buy something on credit, you debit accounts receivable and credit cash. So the initial recording is correct with an increase in accounts receivable and expense.

But if Arno Co. didn't record this, their accounts would be wrong. Suppose they made a purchase of $10,000 on credit. Then, if they don't record it, their accounts receivable is understated by $10,000. Because the liability is not recorded.

Then, when they do the physical inventory, they include all the purchased goods, including the ones that weren't recorded. Wait, no, because they actually didn't record the purchase at all. So the recorded accounts are wrong.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the merchandise was correctly included in the inventory. But Arno didn't record the purchase. So the physical inventory is correct, but the books are not. So the books are understated because the purchase was not recorded.

So, the assets in the books reflect that. Because the purchase was not recorded, the company's assets (like cash or accounts receivable) are understated. Wait, no. Let me think in terms of double-entry accounting.

When the purchase is recorded (if done), the company records an increase in accounts receivable (if it's on credit) or an increase in inventory, depending on when payment is made. Since the purchase is not recorded, the accounts are incorrect. 

So, for example, if Arno Co. records a purchase on credit of $10,000, they would debit accounts receivable and credit cash. But if they don't, then accounts receivable is understated by $10,000.

Then, when the physical inventory is done, they include all the goods, which would include the ones that were supposed to be there. But because the purchase wasn't recorded, the physical count would be higher than it should be. But wait, no, the count is correct. The question says that the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. So the physical count is accurate, but the books show the purchase as not recorded.

So, the books (balance sheet) are understated because the purchase was not recorded. But the physical inventory is correct. So, the assets under the books are understated, but the actual inventory is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on the balance sheet. So, if the purchase wasn't recorded, the accounts are wrong. So, the balance sheet reflects that. 

Let me approach this step by step.

1. The company made a credit purchase but didn't record it.

2. The accounts are not recorded, so the liability (e.g., accounts receivable) is understated.

3. At year-end, when they do the physical inventory, they correctly include all the goods. But since the purchase wasn't recorded, the actual inventory is correct, but the accounts are understated.

Which means that the balance sheet shows assets as understated because the accounts are understated.

Wait, no. The accounts are understated because they didn't record the purchase. So, the total assets are understated because the liability isn't recorded. Because when you make an incorrect entry, the assets are understated.

Wait, but let me think of it as an example. Suppose the company buys $10,000 worth of inventory on credit. They should record it as an increase in accounts receivable (if paid later) or inventory (if paid now). 

But if they don't, their accounts will be wrong. So, if they didn't record it, their accounts are understated.

So, their assets would be understated because they have incorrect amounts in accounts like accounts receivable or inventory.

Wait, no. Wait, when they record a credit purchase, they increase accounts receivable and expense. If they don't, then accounts receivable is understated by the amount of the purchase, and expense is understated by that amount.

Wait, that can't be right because expense can't be understated. Oh, no, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me think again.

When a company records a credit purchase, it's like a liability. So the initial recording would be that the company's accounts are understatedâ€”because the liability is not recorded.

Wait, no. Let me think of this as an example: suppose the company makes a purchase of $10,000 on credit. They should record it as an increase in accounts receivable and expense. But if they don't, then the accounts are incorrect. So, their accounts would have $10,000 less in accounts receivable and expense. 

Wait, no, because when they don't record it, their accounts are not in sync. So, their accounts would be under recorded.

Wait, no. Let's take a simple example. If you make a purchase of $1,000 on credit, the correct journal entry would be:

Debit accounts receivable (or inventory) $1,000

Credit cash $1,000

If Arno Co. doesn't record this, the accounts would have $1,000 less in accounts receivable and cash, but no credit. So, the accounts are incorrect.

Now, when they do the physical inventory, they include all the goods that were purchased. But since the purchase wasn't recorded, the actual inventory is correct, but the books (balance sheet) show that the accounts are understated.

So, the balance sheet will show that the accounts (like accounts receivable) are understated because they haven't been recorded. So, the assets are understated, and the other accounts (like expenses) are understated as well.

Wait, but in the question, the options are about the effect on the balance sheet, specifically on assets, liabilities, and equity.

Wait, the question is about the effect on the balance sheet. So, the question is, when a credit purchase is not recorded, but the inventory is correctly recorded, what's the impact.

So, in the books, the accounts for the purchase (liabilities) are understated. So, assets are understated because they don't include the correct amount in accounts like accounts receivable. Because the purchase wasn't recorded, the accounts are not accurate.

So, the balance sheet will show that the assets are understated because the accounts are understated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is that the accounts are understated, which affects the balance sheet. So, the assets are understated because the accounts are understated.

Wait, but the question gives options about assets and liabilities. Let's see the options again.

Options:

A: No effect Overstated

B: Understated Understated

C: No effect Understated

D: Understated No effect

E: Overstated No effect

F: Understated Overstated

G: No effect No effect

H: Overstated Overstated

I: Overstated Understated

J: etc.

Wait, the options given in the question are only up to F, but the user provided a list that goes up to J, but the options in the problem are A to H, perhaps.

Wait, no, the user might have an error in the options.

Wait, the question's options are:

A: No effect Overstated

B: Understated Understated

C: No effect Understated

D: Understated No effect

E: Overstated No effect

F: Understated Overstated

G: No effect No effect

H: Overstated Overstated

I: Overstated Understated

J: No effect Overstated

Wait, but the user might have a typo, but for the sake of this, I'll proceed.

So, the point is that the balance sheet's assets are understated because the accounts for the purchase were not recorded. So, the accounts for the purchase are understated, but since the inventory is correct, the physical count is accurate.

So, the effect on the balance sheet would be that the accounts (liabilities) are understated, which makes the assets (if they are understated) appear lower.

Wait, but let me think about the journal entries. So, when a company makes a credit purchase, it's a liability. So, the initial journal entry is:

Debit account (say, accounts receivable) $10,000

Debit expense $10,000

Debit cash (if paid now) $10,000

Wait, actually, no. If it's on credit, the correct entry is:

Debit accounts receivable $10,000

Credit cash $10,000

Because the company is expecting to receive payment later.

But if the company doesn't record this, then the accounts are incorrect. So, the accounts would have a $10,000 difference. For example, the accounts receivable would be understated by $10,000, and the cash would be understated as well (because they are not received). But the expense would be understated by $10,000 as well.

Wait, no, because expense is an income statement account. If you don't record it, the expense is understated by the amount of the purchase. So, the expense is understated, which would lead to overstated net income. But the question is about the balance sheet.

So, the balance sheet's assets would be understated because the accounts are understated. Because the accounts are not recorded, the company doesn't have the correct amount in accounts like accounts receivable or inventory. 

So, when the physical inventory is done, the count is correct, but the accounts are incorrect. So, the balance sheet shows an understated liability because the purchase wasn't recorded. 

Wait, but the question is about the effect on the balance sheet, not the accounts. Let me think about the balance sheet's assets.

The company didn't record the purchase, so their accounts (like accounts receivable or inventory) are understated. Since the inventory is correctly recorded, their physical count is accurate. So, the assets in the books are understated because the accounts are understated.

So, the balance sheet shows that the assets are understated because the accounts are understated. So, the effect is that the assets are understated. So, the answer would be B: Understated Understated. But wait, option B says "Understated Understated", which refers to assets and liabilities.

Wait, no, the options are A to H, and the options are about the effect on the balance sheet, but the options are:

Looking back, the options are:

A: No effect Overstated

B: Understated Understated

C: No effect Understated

D: Understated No effect

E: Overstated No effect

F: Understated Overstated

G: No effect No effect

H: Overstated Overstated

I: Overstated Understated

So, the question is about the balance sheet's effect. So, the correct option would be B, which says "Understated Understated". But wait, no, because the balance sheet's assets are understated because the accounts are understated. The question is about the effect on the balance sheet, so the effect on assets is understated, and on the balance sheet, the effect is that the assets are understated.

Wait, but looking at the options, the effect on the balance sheet would be that the assets are understated. So, the effect is that the assets are understated. So, looking at the options, option B says "Understated Understated", which refers to assets and liabilities. Wait, but the balance sheet would have assets understated, and other accounts (like liabilities) would also be understated.

Wait, no, the question is only asking about the effect on the balance sheet, which includes assets, liabilities, and equity.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The problem is: Arno Co. didn't record a credit purchase, but the inventory was correct. So, the physical count is correct. But the books show an understated liability (accounts) because the purchase wasn't recorded.

So, on the balance sheet, the assets would be understated because when you record the purchase, you increase an asset (which was presumably an expense before), but actually, the purchase wasn't recorded, so the asset (if it's an asset) is understated.

Wait, no, the purchase was a credit, so perhaps it's a liability. So, the purchase wasn't recorded, so the liability is understated. So, the assets are understated because the accounts are understated. So, the effect is that the assets are understated. So, looking at the options, the correct answer would be option B: Understated Understated. Wait, but the options are about the effect on the balance sheet.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B: Understated Understated. But wait, the balance sheet's assets would be understated, and what about the other accounts?

Wait, the problem says the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. So, the physical count is correct. So, the company's inventory is correct. So, the entry for the purchase is not recorded, but the inventory is correctly recorded. 

Therefore, the accounts related to the inventory (like accounts receivable or inventory) are understated because the purchase wasn't recorded. So, the balance sheet's assets would be understated. 

But the question is about the effect on the balance sheet. So, the effect is that the assets are understated, and the other accounts (like liabilities) are also understated. But looking at the options, option B says "Understated Understated", which is about assets and liabilities. So, perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of it in terms of trial balances.

Suppose the books record a purchase, but it's not done. Then, the trial balance would show that the accounts (liabilities) are understated. So, assets would be normal, but the balance sheet would show assets understated because the accounts are understated.

So, when the physical inventory is done correctly, the physical count is correct. So, the balance sheet's assets are understated because the accounts (liabilities) are understated.

Wait, but the options don't seem to have an option where assets are understated and no effect on other accounts. Hmm.

Wait, the options are:

A: No effect Overstated

B: Understated Understated

C: No effect Understated

D: Understated No effect

E: Overstated No effect

F: Understated Overstated

G: No effect No effect

H: Overstated Overstated

I: Overstated Understated

So, option B is "Understated Understated", which refers to two different accounts, perhaps assets and liabilities. But the question is about the balance sheet, which includes assets, liabilities, and equity.

So, the effect is that the balance sheet's assets are understated because the accounts (liabilities) are understated. So, the correct answer would be that the assets are understated. But looking at the options, which ones refer to this.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B says "Understated Understated". But that would be about two separate accounts. So, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the effect is that the balance sheet's assets are understated, and the other accounts (liabilities) are also understated.

Wait, let me think about the impact on the balance sheet. The balance sheet's assets are understated because the accounts (liabilities) are understated. So, the effect is that the assets are understated.

But the options don't have an option that says "Understated" for the balance sheet. Looking back, the user's options list up to option I. Wait, the user provided a list up to option I, but the actual question is about the balance sheet, so perhaps the correct option is B: Understated Understated. Because the effects on assets and liabilities are both understated.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is that the balance sheet's assets are understated, but no effect on other accounts. Hmm, but the question is about the effect on the balance sheet, which includes assets, liabilities, and equity.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it from the standpoint of the double-entry system.

When a credit purchase is recorded, it's an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in expense. But if it's not recorded, those accounts are not increased.

So, the accounts are understated, which affects the balance sheet.

The effect on the balance sheet would be that the assets are understated because the accounts are understated. So, the correct option would be B: Understated Understated.

Wait, no, because when the accounts are understated, the assets are understated. So, the effect is that the balance sheet's assets are understated. So, the effect is that the assets are understated, and the other accounts (liabilities and equity) are also understated.

But the options given in the problem for the answer don't directly address that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the assets are understated, and the other accounts are also understated. But in the options provided, the only option that mentions both assets and liabilities being understated is option B: Understated Understated.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of it this way: If a credit purchase is not recorded, the accounts (liabilities) are understated. So, the balance sheet's assets are understated.

Therefore, the answer is B: Understated Understated.

Wait, but I'm not sure because the options seem to describe different aspects. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the balance sheet's assets are understated. So, the effect is that the assets are understated, but not sure about the other options.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the standard treatment of this scenario.

In accounting, if a transaction is not recorded, the accounts are understated. So, when a company records a credit purchase, it increases the accounts receivable and expense. If it doesn't record it, the accounts are incorrect.

So, the effect on the balance sheet is that the assets are understated because the accounts are understated.

So, the correct option would be B: Understated Understated.

But wait, the options don't have an option that says "Understated Understated" for the balance sheet. Let me check the user's options again.

Wait, the user provided the options up to option I, but the options in the problem are only from A to H. So, I think the correct answer is B: Understated Understated.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: Understated Understated**. 

When a credit purchase is not recorded, the corresponding accounts (like accounts receivable or inventory) are understated. This affects the balance sheet, as the assets are understated. The effect is that the balance sheet's assets are understated. 

ANSWER: B
