Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about calculating K_p for a reaction. The reaction given is S(s) + 2CO(g) → SO₂(g) + 2C(s). The setup is that at a certain temperature, two atmospheres of CO are introduced into a vessel that contains excess solid sulfur. The final equilibrium pressure is 1.03 atm. The options are all different values, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that K_p is the equilibrium constant for the reaction in terms of partial pressures. But wait, the reaction here has solids involved. Oh right! For reactions with solids or pure liquids, their activities are considered constant and don't appear in the equilibrium expression. So that simplifies things a bit because their partial pressures don't affect K_p.

Let me write down the reaction and the expression for K_p. The reaction is S(s) + 2CO(g) → SO₂(g) + 2C(s). Since S and C are solids, their partial pressures are irrelevant. So the K_p would only depend on the partial pressure of CO and SO₂.

Wait, but in this reaction, what's the change in the number of moles of gas? Let me count. On the reactant side, we have 2 moles of CO. On the product side, we have 1 mole of SO₂. So the net change is a decrease of 1 mole per 2 moles of CO. So the reaction is a net change where 2 moles of CO are consumed to produce 1 mole of SO₂. 

But wait, in the problem, the initial pressure of CO is 2 atm. Since the vessel is initially filled with CO and excess solid, the system will shift to reach equilibrium. But because the K_p doesn't involve the solids, the presence of excess solid doesn't affect the calculation. So I can ignore solids.

Wait, but wait. The reaction only involves solid and gas moles, right? So K_p will only depend on the partial pressure of CO and SO₂. But since the only gas involved is CO, and the reaction produces SO₂, perhaps the moles of CO and SO₂ change, which affects the pressure.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the partial pressures.

Initial state:
- CO: 2 atm (since initially, it's introduced)
- SO₂: 0 atm (since nothing is said about it)
- S and C are solid, so their partial pressures don't change.

Change:
- Let’s let x be the change in pressure of CO. Since the reaction consumes 2 moles of CO for every 1 mole of SO₂ produced, the change would be: CO decreases by 2x, and SO₂ increases by x.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The reaction is 1 mole of CO → 1 mole of SO₂. So for every mole of CO that reacts, one mole of SO₂ is produced. So the stoichiometric change is for 2 moles of CO being consumed (since 2 moles are present initially), and 1 mole of SO₂ is produced.

Alternatively, considering the reaction as written, let's let 'y' be the change in pressure. So:

- CO: initial pressure is 2 atm; change is -2y (since 2 moles are consumed)
- SO₂: change is +y (since 1 mole is produced)

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the initial and final states.

At start:
- CO: 2 atm
- SO₂: 0 atm

At equilibrium:
- CO: 2 - 2y (since 2 moles are consumed per mole of reaction)
- SO₂: 0 + y

But wait, that can't be right. Because the reaction is 1 CO → 1 SO₂. Wait, actually, the stoichiometry is 2 CO → 1 SO₂. So for each 2 moles that react, 1 mole is produced. So the moles of CO decrease by 2y and SO₂ increases by y.

So:

At equilibrium, CO pressure is (2 - 2y) atm, and SO₂ is y atm.

But wait, the total pressure in the system is 1.03 atm. So the sum of the partial pressures of all species is 1.03 atm. But wait, the reaction only involves CO and SO₂, and the others are solids. So, the total pressure would be the sum of the partial pressures of CO and SO₂.

So:

Total pressure = (2 - 2y) + y = 1.03 atm.

Simplify that equation: 2 -2y + y =1.03 => 2 - y =1.03 → y = 2 -1.03 = 0.97 atm.

So, the change in pressure y is 0.97 atm.

Thus, the equilibrium pressures are:

CO: 2 - 2y = 2 - 2*0.97 = 2 -1.94 = 0.06 atm.

SO₂: y = 0.97 atm.

Wait, but wait! That can't be right because the initial pressure of CO is 2 atm. So in the equilibrium, CO is 0.06 atm, which is lower than initial, which makes sense because the reaction is spontaneous in the reverse direction. Because, when you have more of a substance, the reaction tends to produce more of the other substance.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations.

Equation: 2 - 2y + y = 1.03.

So 2 - y =1.03 → y = 0.97.

So,

CO at equilibrium: 2 - 2*(0.97) = 2 -1.94 = 0.06 atm.

SO₂: 0.97 atm. 

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because initially, we started with 2 atm CO and 0 of SO₂. If y is 0.97, then SO₂ is 0.97 atm, and CO is 0.06 atm. So the reaction is going backward, producing more SO₂ and more CO, meaning the reaction is moving in the reverse direction.

But wait, let me see: the reaction is S(s) + 2CO(g) → SO₂(g) + 2C(s).

So, if y is positive, that would mean that 2y moles of CO are reacting, and y moles of SO₂ are produced. 

So, yes, the change makes sense.

So, K_p = (P_SO₂) / (P_CO)^2.

Because in the expression, K_p = [SO₂] / [CO]^2.

Since the solids don't contribute, their partial pressures are 1 atm each (as they are in the standard state). So, the calculation is:

K_p = (0.97 atm) / (0.06 atm)^2.

Wait, let me compute that. 0.97 divided by (0.06)^2.

0.06 squared is 0.0036.

So 0.97 / 0.0036 = approximately 269.444...

Looking at the options, option J is 269.44 atm^-1. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So:

y is 0.97 atm.

CO pressure = 2 - 2*0.97 = 2 -1.94 = 0.06 atm.

SO₂ pressure = 0.97.

So K_p = (0.97) / (0.06)^2 = 0.97 / 0.0036.

Let me compute that.

0.97 / 0.0036. Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 970 / 3.6.

3.6 * 269 = let's see: 3 *269 = 807, 0.6 *269=161.4 → 807 +161.4=968.4. So 3.6 *269.444 ≈ 968.4. So 970 is about 269.444 *3.6.

So 970 /3.6 = 269.444... So 0.97 /0.0036 = 269.444...

So K_p equals approximately 269.44 atm^-1.

Looking at the options, option J is 269.44 atm^-1. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate \( K_p \) for the reaction \( \text{S(s)} + 2\text{CO(g)} \leftrightarrow \text{SO}_2\text{(g)} + 2\text{C(s)} \), we note that the solids (S and C) do not appear in the equilibrium expression. The equilibrium constant depends only on the partial pressures of the gases involved.

### Step 1: Set up the initial and equilibrium conditions
- Initial pressure of CO: \( 2 \, \text{atm} \).
- Initial pressure of SO₂: \( 0 \, \text{atm} \).
- Let \( y \) represent the change in pressure of CO and SO₂.

At equilibrium:
- CO: \( 2 - 2y \, \text{atm} \).
- SO₂: \( y \, \text{atm} \).

### Step 2: Total pressure equation
The total pressure at equilibrium is the sum of the partial pressures of CO and SO₂:
\[
2 - 2y + y = 1.03 \, \text{atm}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
2 - y = 1.03 \implies y = 0.97 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 3: Equilibrium pressures
- CO: \( 2 - 2(0.97) = 0.06 \, \text{atm} \).
- SO₂: \( 0.97 \, \text{atm} \).

### Step 4: Calculate \( K_p \)
The equilibrium expression for \( K_p \) is:
\[
K_p = \frac{P_{\text{SO}_2}}{(P_{\text{CO}})^2}.
\]
Substitute the equilibrium pressures:
\[
K_p = \frac{0.97}{(0.06)^2} = \frac{0.97}{0.0036} \approx 269.44 \, \text{atm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated value of \( K_p \) corresponds to option J.
