Okay, so I've got this question here asking for the smallest positive integer n such that 1/n is a terminating decimal and n contains the digit 9. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for a fraction 1/n to be a terminating decimal, the denominator n must be of the form 2^a * 5^b, where a and b are non-negative integers. This means that when you factor n into primes, you can only have 2s and 5s. So n cannot have any other prime factors like 3, 7, 11, etc.

Now, the second condition is that n must contain the digit 9. So I need to find the smallest n in the form 2^a *5^b that has at least one 9 in its digits.

Looking at the options provided: A is 512, which is 2^9, but 512 doesn't have a 9. B is 1024, which is 2^10. Same issue. C is 128, which is 2^7. Still no 9. D is 72, that's 2^3 * 3^2. Oh wait, 3 is a problem because the denominator has to be only 2s and 5s for it to terminate. So 72 isn't a valid n because it has a 3. So D is out.

E is 32, which is 2^5. No 9. F is 256, which is 2^8. Still no 9. G is 2048, which is 2^11. Also no 9. H is 64, which is 2^6. No 9. I is 8192, which is 2^13. No 9 either. J is 4096, which is 2^12. Still no 9.

Wait a second, maybe I'm missing something. Looking again at the options: all the given numbers are powers of 2, starting from 128 up to 4096. None of them have a 9 in their digits. So does that mean none of these options satisfy the condition? But the question is asking for the smallest n, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider numbers that are products of 2s and 5s, not necessarily just powers of 2. Like 10 (2*5), 20 (2^2*5), 25 (5^2), etc. But the options here are all powers of 2. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me list the numbers in the options and see if any of them have a 9.

Looking at the options again:

A:512 → 5,1,2 → no 9
B:1024 → 1,0,2,4 → no 9
C:128 → 1,2,8 → no 9
D:72 → 7,2 → no 9
E:32 → 3,2 → no 9
F:256 → 2,5,6 → no 9
G:2048 → 2,0,4,8 → no 9
H:64 → 6,4 → no 9
I:8192 → 8,1,9,2 → Oh, wait! 8192 has a 9. So that's a candidate. But wait, is 8192 a valid denominator? Let's check.

Wait, 8192 is 2^13. So it's a product of only 2s. So 1/8192 is a terminating decimal. And yes, it contains a 9 in the last digit. So that would be the smallest option with a 9.

But wait, the options provided are all powers of 2. So I thought the options are limited to those, but I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says, "the smallest positive integer n..." but the options are all powers of 2. So, wait, the next one is I:8192, which is 2^13, and it's in the options. So if I choose I, which is 8192, that's the smallest n in the options where n is a power of 2, contains a 9, and 1/n is a terminating decimal.

But wait, option G is 2048, which is 2^11. No 9. So the first option in the list that has a 9 is I:8192. So the answer should be I.
</think>

The smallest positive integer n from the options that meets both conditions is 8192, as it's a power of 2 and contains a 9.
