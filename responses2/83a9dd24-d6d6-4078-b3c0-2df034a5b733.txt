Okay, so I've got this integral to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because vector calculus can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The integral given is the surface integral of the curl of vector A dotted with the differential area element dA. The formula is ∫∫_S (∇×A) · dA. I remember from the divergence theorem that this can sometimes be converted into a volume integral.

Wait, but the divergence theorem relates a surface integral to a volume integral of the divergence. So, the theorem says that the surface integral of the curl of A is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of A. Oh right, because the curl's divergence is zero. So, ∫∫_S (∇×A) · dA = ∫∫∫_V (∇·∇A) dV. Wait, no, the divergence theorem states that ∫∫_S F · dA = ∫∫∫_V ∇·F dV. So here F is ∇×A, so the divergence of F would be ∇·(∇×A). But wait, the divergence of a curl is always zero. So, ∇·(∇×A) = 0. That means the surface integral is zero. So the value of the integral should be zero. Looking at the options, option H is 0. But wait, I should make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: the vector A is given as A = y i + z j + x k. So, let's compute the curl of A. The curl is the determinant of the matrix with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the partial derivatives in the second, and A in the third.

Calculating the curl: 

∇×A = ( ∂A_z/∂y - ∂A_y/∂z ) i + ( ∂A_x/∂z - ∂A_z/∂x ) j + ( ∂A_y/∂x - ∂A_x/∂y ) k.

Plugging in A's components:

A_x = y, A_y = z, A_z = x.

So,

∂A_z/∂y = ∂x/∂y = 0

∂A_y/∂z = ∂z/∂z = 1

So the i component: 0 - 1 = -1.

Next, ∂A_x/∂z = ∂y/∂z =0

∂A_z/∂x = ∂x/∂x =1

So the j component: 0 - 1 = -1.

Next, ∂A_y/∂x = ∂z/∂x = 0

∂A_x/∂y = ∂y/∂y =1

So the k component: 0 - 1 = -1.

Wait, wait, no! Wait, I think I got that wrong. Let's recalculate.

Wait, the curl formula is:

∇×A = ( ∂A_z/∂y - ∂A_y/∂z ) i + ( ∂A_x/∂z - ∂A_z/∂x ) j + ( ∂A_y/∂x - ∂A_x/∂y ) k.

So substituting:

i component: ∂x/∂y (which is 0) minus ∂z/∂z (which is 1) → 0 -1 = -1.

j component: ∂y/∂z (0) minus ∂x/∂x (1) → 0 -1 = -1.

k component: ∂z/∂x (0) minus ∂y/∂y (1) → 0 -1 = -1.

Wait, that can't be right, because that would make the curl as (-1, -1, -1). Wait, but wait, maybe I did the signs wrong.

Wait, another approach: the curl of A where A = (y, z, x) is:

∇×A = ( ∂A_z/∂y - ∂A_y/∂z, ∂A_x/∂z - ∂A_z/∂x, ∂A_y/∂x - ∂A_x/∂y )

So each component:

i: 0 (from ∂x/∂y =0) minus 1 (from ∂z/∂z=1) → -1.

j: 0 (from ∂y/∂z) minus 1 (from ∂x/∂x=1) → -1.

k: 0 (from ∂z/∂x) minus 0 (from ∂y/∂y) → 0 -1 = -1.

Wait, that would mean the curl is (-1, -1, -1). Hmm. But that's strange because I thought the curl of (y, z, x) would be something else. Let me check with another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the curl is (0,0,0) if A is linear. Wait, no, A is y i + z j + x k. Let me write A as (y, z, x) = (A1, A2, A3). Then,

∇×A = ( ∂A3/∂y - ∂A2/∂z, ∂A1/∂z - ∂A3/∂x, ∂A2/∂x - ∂A1/∂y )

So,

i component: ∂x/∂y (0) - ∂z/∂z (1) → 0 -1 = -1.

j component: ∂y/∂z (0) - ∂x/∂x (1) → 0 -1 = -1.

k component: ∂z/∂x (0) - ∂y/∂y (1) → 0 -1 = -1.

So yes, the curl is (-1, -1, -1). Wait, but wait a second, if all components are -1, then the vector field is uniform (-1, -1, -1). That's a constant vector field, so the divergence would be zero. Because ∇·(C) where C is a constant vector is zero, since the divergence of a constant vector field is zero (each component's derivative is zero). So, the divergence of the curl is zero, which aligns with the earlier conclusion that ∇·(∇×A)=0.

So, according to the divergence theorem, the integral of (∇×A) · dA over the surface S is equal to the integral of the divergence of (∇×A) over the volume inside S, which is zero because the divergence is zero. So the surface integral is zero.

Therefore, the value of the integral is zero, which is option H.

The integral in question is the surface integral of the curl of vector **A** dotted with the differential area element dA over a surface **S**. The integral can be evaluated using the divergence theorem, which states:

\[
\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_V \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) \, dV
\]

Here, **A** is given as **A = y** i + **z** j + **x** k. The divergence of the curl of any vector field is always zero:

\[
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = 0
\]

Thus, the volume integral on the right-hand side of the divergence theorem is zero, implying that the surface integral is also zero. The corresponding value of the integral is:

**H: 0**
