Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an object falling under gravity. Hmm, let me think. The question says an object is released from rest and falls a distance h during the first second. Then it asks how far it will fall during the next second. The options are from A to J, with various multiples of h. 

Wait, I remember that in free fall, the distance fallen is related to the square of the time. Oh right, the formula for distance fallen under constant acceleration (assuming air resistance isn't a factor here) is d = (1/2) g t², where g is acceleration due to gravity. So, for the first second, the distance h would be (1/2) g (1)^2 = 0.5 g. 

Now, how far does it fall in the next second? That would be from t=1 to t=2. So I'll calculate d(2) - d(1). Let's compute that. 

d(2) = 0.5 g (2)^2 = 0.5 g *4 = 2g. 
d(1) was h, which is 0.5g. 
So subtracting, 2g - 0.5g = 1.5g. 

Wait, but in terms of h, since h is 0.5g, solving for g gives g = 2h. So 1.5g would be 1.5 * 2h = 3h. 

Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the next second covers 3h, but I thought the distance increases by more each second. Wait wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, no, in free fall, the distance increases by more each second because the acceleration is constant. Wait, let me think again.

Wait another approach. The distance fallen in the first second is h. The velocity after the first second is v = g * t. At t=1, velocity is g. So in the next second (from t=1 to t=2), the average velocity is (v1 + v2)/2, so (g + 2g)/2 = 1.5g. So the distance is average velocity multiplied by time (1 second), so 1.5g *1 = 1.5g. But since h is 0.5g, then 1.5g is 3h. So the next second, it falls 3h. 

Wait, but wait another second. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 3h. But when I think about the standard formula, the distance fallen in the first second is h, the second second is 3h. Let me calculate it another way.

The formula for distance fallen in any time interval t is d = (1/2) g (t)^2. So for each second after that, the distance from t=1 to t=2 is d(2) - d(1) = (0.5g(4) ) - (0.5g(1)) ) = 2g - 0.5g = 1.5g. 

Since h = 0.5g, then 1.5g = 3h. So the answer is 3h, which is option I. 

Wait, but wait another point—this applies only when the object is in free fall under constant acceleration. Oh, right, because if it's dropped from rest, the initial velocity is zero. So the calculations hold. So the next second, the object falls 3h meters, so the answer is I.

The distance fallen during the first second is h, which is given by the formula \( d = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \). For the first second (\( t = 1 \)), \( h = \frac{1}{2} g (1)^2 = \frac{1}{2} g \). 

To find the distance fallen during the next second (from \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 2 \)), calculate the total distance fallen by \( t = 2 \) and subtract the distance fallen by \( t = 1 \):

\[
d(2) = \frac{1}{2} g (2)^2 = 2g
\]
\[
d(1) = h = \frac{1}{2} g
\]
\[
\text{Distance during the second second} = d(2) - d(1) = 2g - \frac{1}{2} g = \frac{3}{2} g
\]

Since \( h = \frac{1}{2} g \), solving for \( g \) gives \( g = 2h \). Substituting this into the expression for the distance during the second second:

\[
\frac{3}{2} g = \frac{3}{2} (2h) = 3h
\]

Thus, the object falls \( 3h \) during the next second.
