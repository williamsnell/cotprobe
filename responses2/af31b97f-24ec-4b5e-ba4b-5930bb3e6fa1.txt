Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about estimating the radius of the nucleus of mercury. Hmm, I remember that the radius varies with atomic weight A following the formula R =1.2 ×10^-13 A^(1/3) cm. Oh wait, right, the formula is R = 1.2 ×10^-13 multiplied by the cube root of the atomic weight A.

Mercury's atomic weight is around 197.5, I think. Let me double-check. Yeah, Mercury's atomic number is 80, but wait, atomic weight is usually the average, so Mercury's average atomic weight is about 195.98, which I'll approximate as 196 for simplicity.

So, the formula R =1.2e-13 * (A)^(1/3). Plugging in A=196. Let me calculate the cube root of 196. Wait, what's the cube of 5? 125, 6 is 216. Oh, so 196 is between 5^3 and 6^3. Let me calculate 5.8 cubed: 5.8^3. 5^3 is 125. 0.8^3 is 0.512. But actually, more accurately, 5.8 *5.8 is 33.64. Multiply by 5.8 again: 33.64 *5.8. Let me compute 33 *5.8 is 191.4, and 0.64 *5.8 is about 3.712. So total is 195.112. Oh, wait, but 5.8^3 is 195.112, which is close to 196. So the cube root is approximately 5.8.

So R would be 1.2e-13 multiplied by 5.8. Let's compute that: 1.2 *5.8 is 6.96. So R is about 6.96e-13 cm. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is option D:6 ×10^-13 cm. But wait, let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, is Mercury's atomic weight actually 195.98? Yes, that's correct. So the cube root of 195.98 is the same as cube root of 196, which is approximately 5.8. So 1.2e-13 *5.8 =6.96e-13 cm. So that rounds to about 7e-13 cm. Let me see the options:

Option D is 6e-13, E is 9e-13. So 6.96e-13 is closer to 7e-13, which is not available. Wait, no, looking back, the options are:

Options:

A: 10e-13

B:12e-13

C:5e-13

D:6e-13

E:9e-13

F:8e-13

G:4e-13

H:3e-13

I:11e-13

J:7e-13

Hmm, so J is 7e-13. So the correct answer is J:7 ×10^-13 cm.

To estimate the radius of the nucleus of mercury, we use the formula:

\[
R = 1.2 \times 10^{-13} \, A^{1/3} \, \text{cm}
\]

where \( A \) is the atomic weight of mercury. The atomic weight of mercury is approximately 196. The cube root of 196 is approximately 5.8. Substituting this into the formula:

\[
R = 1.2 \times 10^{-13} \times 5.8 = 6.96 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}
\]

This value is closest to \( 7 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to option J. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: J**
