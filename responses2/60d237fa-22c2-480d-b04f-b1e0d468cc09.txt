Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about interpolating polynomials. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the maximum possible degree of p(x), which is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for a real-valued function f(x) at n+1 distinct points x0 to xn.

Wait, I remember something about interpolation and polynomial degree. Oh right, the Lagrange interpolation formula. If you have n+1 points, then the unique interpolating polynomial p(x) will have degree at most n. Because the Lagrange polynomial is constructed such that it passes through all these points, and it's a sum of basis polynomials each of degree n-1. Adding them all up, the highest degree term would be n. So, the minimal-degree polynomial would have degree at most n, but it could be lower depending on the function.

So the question is asking for the maximum possible degree of p(x). That is, what's the highest degree p(x) can have. Since it's the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial, the maximum degree it could reach is n because it can't be higher than n, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the minimal-degree polynomial is the one with the smallest degree that passes through all the points. So the minimal-degree polynomial could be of degree less than n. But the question is about the maximum possible degree of p(x), which is the minimal one. Oh wait, no, the question says p is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial. So the minimal degree is the smallest possible. But the options are about the degree of p(x), which is the minimal-degree. Wait, no, the question says "the maximum possible degree of p(x)", but p(x) is the minimal-degree polynomial. So p(x) can't have a higher degree than n, but the maximum possible degree it can have is n. Because the minimal degree is the smallest, but the maximum possible degree is when you're choosing the minimal p(x) with as high a degree as possible. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I might be getting confused.

Wait, no, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial is the one with the smallest degree that goes through all the points. So for example, if all the points lie on a straight line, then the minimal-degree polynomial is linear (degree 1). But if the points don't lie on a straight line, then the minimal-degree polynomial is quadratic, degree 2. So the minimal degree depends on the function f(x) and the points. But the question is about the maximum possible degree of p(x), which is the minimal-degree polynomial. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the question is: "the maximum possible degree of p(x)", which is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial. So p(x) is the minimal-degree polynomial that interpolates f at n+1 points. So the maximum possible degree of p(x) would be when n is as big as possible? Wait, no, the maximum possible degree is when n is large, but for each n, the minimal-degree is at most n. So the maximum possible degree that p(x) could have is n, because it's the minimal degree, but wait, that's the minimal degree. Oh, no, wait again.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The minimal-degree interpolating polynomial is the one with the smallest possible degree. So if the points lie on a line, the minimal degree is 1. If they lie on a curve that's not a line, it's 2, etc. So the minimal-degree is the smallest possible, but the question is about the maximum possible degree. Wait, that doesn't fit because the minimal-degree can't be higher than n. Wait, no, the minimal-degree is the smallest possible, so p(x) can't have a higher degree than n. So the maximum possible degree is n, since it's the maximum the minimal-degree polynomial can have. So the answer is B: n + 1? Wait no, n is the number of points minus one. Wait, wait, the question says n+1 distinct points. So, the minimal-degree polynomial is of degree at most n. So the maximum possible degree is n, so the answer is B: n + 1? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, no, wait, no, wait again. Wait, the minimal-degree polynomial is the one with the smallest possible degree that interpolates all the points. So if the function f(x) is of degree n, then the minimal-degree polynomial might be degree n. But if the function is of a lower degree, the minimal-degree is lower. So the maximum possible degree of p(x) is when f(x) is of degree n, and the minimal-degree is n. So p(x) can have degree up to n. So the maximum possible degree is n, so the answer would be B: n+1? Wait, no, wait, the options for B is n+1. Wait, no, wait, the options are:

A: 2n

B: n+1

C: 2n+1

D: n³

E: n²+1

F: n/2

G: n

H: n-1

I: n²

J: n+2

So the maximum possible degree of p(x) is n. So the correct option is B, which is n+1? Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. So p(x) is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial. The minimal-degree would be the smallest degree that can interpolate the points, and the maximum possible degree is when the minimal-degree polynomial is as high as possible. So if the minimal-degree is n, then the maximum possible degree is n, because p(x) can't have a higher degree than the minimal required. So the correct answer is n, so option G.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh wait, no! Wait, no, when you have n+1 points, the minimal-degree polynomial can have degree at most n, but the maximum possible degree would be n, because the minimal degree is the smallest possible, but the maximum is when the minimal-degree is as high as possible. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Wait, the minimal-degree is the smallest, but the maximum possible degree is when the minimal-degree is as high as possible. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The minimal-degree is the smallest possible, so the maximum possible is when the minimal-degree is as high as possible, but that's not possible because the minimal-degree can't be higher than n. So the maximum possible degree of p(x) is n. So the answer is G: n.

Wait, wait, but let me think of an example. Suppose n=1, so two points. Then the minimal-degree polynomial is linear (degree 1). So the maximum possible degree of the minimal-degree is 1, which is n. So the answer is G.

Another example, n=2, three points. The minimal-degree polynomial is quadratic (degree 2). So the maximum possible degree is 2, which is n. So again, the answer is G.

Wait, but when n is 0, then there's one point, so the minimal-degree is 0, which is a constant. So the maximum possible degree is 0, which is n=0, so G.

So in all cases, the maximum possible degree is n. So the answer should be G: n.

The minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for n+1 distinct points has a degree at most n. Therefore, the maximum possible degree of p(x) is n.
