Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Z-transform, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: Find the z-transform of the step-sequence f[n] = u[n], using the definition of the unilateral Z-transform. The options are from A to J. 

Hmm, I remember that the Z-transform is a way to convert a discrete-time signal into a complex frequency domain representation. The definition given here is F(z) = sum from n=0 to infinity of f[n] z^-n. So, for this problem, f[n] is the unit step function, u[n].

Wait, what does the unit step function look like? Oh right, u[n] is 1 for n >= 0 and 0 otherwise. So f[n] is 1 when n is zero or positive, and zero otherwise.

So putting that into the Z-transform formula, F(z) = sum_{n=0 to ∞} u[n] z^{-n}. Since u[n] is 1 for all n>=0, this simplifies to sum_{n=0}^∞ z^{-n}.

I think that's a geometric series. The sum of z^{-n} from n=0 to infinity. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is 1/(1 - r), provided that |r| < 1. So here, r is z^{-1}, which is 1/z. So the sum would be 1/(1 - 1/z) = z/(z - 1). Wait, that seems right.

Let me double-check that. So, F(z) = 1/(1 - (1/z)) = z/(z - 1). So that's the expression.

Looking at the options: Option H is z/(1 - z), and Option I is z/(z - 1). Oh wait, no, H is z/(1 - z) which is the same as -z/(z - 1). Whereas I is z/(z - 1), which matches our result.

So the correct answer should be option I: z/(z - 1).

Wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me think again. The Z-transform of the unit step is indeed z/(z-1). So option I is correct.
</think>

The Z-transform of the unit step function \( f[n] = u[n] \) is calculated using the definition:

\[
F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} u[n] z^{-n}.
\]

Since \( u[n] = 1 \) for \( n \geq 0 \), the expression simplifies to:

\[
F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^{-n}.
\]

This is a geometric series with ratio \( r = z^{-1} \). The sum of the geometric series is:

\[
F(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}} = \frac{z}{z - 1}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: \( \frac{z}{1 - z} \)** — No, this is incorrect because it is equivalent to \( -\frac{z}{z - 1} \).

**I: \( \frac{z}{z - 1} \)** — This matches the derived expression.

Thus, the correct answer is:
