Question:

Hybrids between some related species of plants are sterile because the parent plants had different chromosome numbers. Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?

Options:

A: The descendants would have a reduced lifespan due to the increased chromosome number.
B: The descendants would have a higher rate of mutation due to the increased chromosome number.
C: The descendants would have a decreased ability to reproduce due to chromosomal abnormalities.
D: The descendants would be genetically identical to the parent plant.
E: The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.
F: The plant with the double chromosome number would be more susceptible to disease, impacting the survival of its descendants.
G: The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.
H: The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.
I: The descendants would be reproductively isolated because of the increased chromosome number.
J: The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about hybrid plants and chromosome numbers. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that hybrid plants between species with different chromosome numbers are sterile. That makes sense because usually, when two species interbreed, their offspring can't reproduce because their chromosomes don't pair properly. But here, the problem states that sometimes the chromosome number of the hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. 

The question is asking what the descendants of such plants would be like. The options are A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's break down the scenario. If a hybrid has two different chromosome sets, its overall chromosome number is the sum of the two parents. For example, if one parent has 2n chromosomes and the other has 3n, their hybrid would have 5n. Now, the question says that sometimes, this hybrid's chromosome number doubles. So, maybe in some cases, 5n becomes 10n? Wait, but 5n doubled is 10n, right? So that's a significant increase.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The descendants would have a reduced lifespan due to the increased chromosome number. I'm not sure. More chromosomes might make it harder for the plant to reproduce, but the lifespan could be longer. Or maybe not. I'm not certain about this.

Option B: Higher mutation rate because of more chromosomes. I remember that mutations are usually a factor in reproduction. More chromosomes might mean more genes, but mutations are random and not necessarily linked to the number. Or wait, if the chromosome numbers are higher, maybe there are more potential points for mutations, but I'm not certain. Maybe this isn't the right reason.

Option C: Decreased ability to reproduce. Wait, the parent hybrid was sterile because the parent's chromosomes couldn't pair. But if the chromosome number doubles, maybe they can pair better. Oh, but the question says the original hybrid could double. So perhaps the hybrid could now pair better, leading to increased reproductive success. So the descendants would be able to reproduce more. So option C says they can't reproduce, which would be incorrect.

Option D: Genetically identical to the parent. No, because the chromosome number is different, so their DNA would be different. So descendants would be genetically different from the parents, so D is wrong.

Option E: More susceptible to disease. If the hybrid has double chromosomes, maybe they're more likely to be diseased. Like, if they have a higher chance of being diploid (like 2n instead of 4n), they might be more prone to some diseases. But I'm not sure if that's the case or if it's the opposite. Alternatively, if they can't pair, they might not survive as long. So maybe E is correct, but I'm not certain.

Option F: More susceptible to disease. Well, if the hybrid has double chromosomes, maybe they are more susceptible. For example, some plants have issues with diploids, like having issues in certain tissues. Or maybe because they have more genes, they might be more prone to some diseases. So F could be correct.

Option G: The plant would be genetically defective. No, because they have different chromosome numbers. So G is wrong.

Option H: Reproductive success. If the chromosome number is higher, maybe the hybrid can pair better, so they can reproduce more. So H is correct.

Option I: Reproductive isolation. Wait, the question is about the descendants. If the hybrid has high chromosome numbers, maybe it can pair better, so they're more likely to reproduce. Reproductive isolation would mean they can't pair, which isn't the case here. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Regain ability to reproduce. If the hybrid's chromosomes can pair better, then J is correct. But the question says the hybrid has a spontaneous doubling. So, wait, the question says that sometimes the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. So if it's a spontaneous event, then perhaps it can pair normally, and thus J is correct.

Wait, let me re-evaluate.

The problem says the parent plants have different chromosome numbers. So, say one has 100 chromosomes (so 50 pairs), and the other has 150 (75 pairs). Their hybrid would have 250. Now, sometimes, this hybrid has its chromosome number double, so 500. If the hybrid can pair, then it can reproduce. So, the descendants would be able to reproduce, so J is correct.

But the question is about the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number. Wait, the question states that "the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number." Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "The descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?" So the "those plants" are the ones that already have a double chromosome number. So their descendants are the ones that come from their cross.

Wait, no: the question says the hybrid plants (parent) have different chromosome numbers, and sometimes their hybrid has double. Then, the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase: the question is about the descendants of the hybrid plants that have a double chromosome number. Because the question says "the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number."

Wait, maybe I should think of it as considering the plant that already has a double chromosome number. So, for instance, if a plant A has 100 chromosomes (50 pairs) and plant B has 150 (75 pairs), their hybrid has 250 (125 pairs). Now, sometimes this hybrid's chromosome number doubles, becoming 500 (250 pairs). So the descendants of that hybrid would be the ones that come from this 500-pair plant.

Wait, but the question is about the descendants of the plants that have the double chromosome number. So, the descendants of the double-chromosome plant. So, the double-chromosome plant itself is a hybrid with 250. Its descendants would include the original hybrid and any other plants that come from it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the descendants of the ones that have already achieved the double. So, for example, if a plant has 250 chromosomes, its descendants would be the ones that come from it. But that depends on what the question is asking.

Wait, the question is about the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number. So, that is, the descendants of the double-chromosome plants. So the double-chromosome parent is a hybrid, and the descendants of that parent would be the plants affected by that hybrid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The question is, the parent plants have different chromosome numbers. So, say Parent1 has n chromosomes (n pairs), Parent2 has m (m pairs). So the hybrid has n + m chromosomes. Now, sometimes, this hybrid's chromosome number doubles, becoming 2*(n + m) = 2n + 2m. So, that's when a hybrid may have a diploid (2n) or tetraploid (2m) or whatever the case. Wait, wait, the problem says that the chromosome number "spontaneously" doubles. So, the hybrid's chromosome number is 2*(n + m) in some cases. So, after this, the descendants would be the ones from this hybrid.

If the hybrid has 2*(n + m) chromosomes, which is 2n + 2m, that's a higher number. So, the descendants of this hybrid would have this higher number.

So, looking at the options, which one describes the descendants.

Option E: Susceptible to disease because of high chromosome number. So, if the plant has more chromosomes, maybe the disease is more likely to occur.

Option H: Reproductive success because they can pair normally. So, if the hybrid can pair, they can reproduce, making H correct.

Option J: Reproduce sexually because chromosomes can pair normally. So, if the hybrid can pair, then J is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the descendants of the double-chromosome plants. So, the double-chromosome plant itself is a hybrid with 2*(n + m) chromosomes. So, the descendants would be the ones that come from this hybrid, which is the same as the descendants of the double-chromosome plant.

Now, the descendants of this hybrid would have that chromosome count. So, if the original hybrid has, say, 500 chromosomes (250 pairs), then their descendants would have 500, 1000, etc. So, regarding their ability to pair.

Option H says they are reproductively successful because they can pair normally. If the hybrid can pair, then H is correct. So, let's think: the initial hybrid has n + m chromosomes. If it doubles, it's 2(n + m). So, 2(n + m) is an even number. So, it's a diploid (if n + m is even, then 2*(n + m) is even). So, that would mean that the hybrid can pair, so they can form gametes.

So, the descendants (from this hybrid) would be able to pair, so H is correct.

Option E: Susceptible to disease because the chromosome number is high. So, if the hybrid has more chromosomes, perhaps it's more prone to diseases. For example, plants that are diploid might be more vulnerable. Or, perhaps the opposite. Some plants can't survive in high-ploid states. Alternatively, maybe the presence of more chromosomes makes them more susceptible, but I'm not sure. It depends on the specific plants.

Now, looking at the options, which one is correct.

The question's options are about what the descendants would be.

Looking at option E: more susceptible to disease. So if the hybrid has more chromosomes, perhaps that's more likely to be diseased. I'm not sure, but I think that having more chromosomes would make a plant more prone to genetic disorders because they have more genes. So, E could be correct.

Option H says they are reproductively successful because they can pair. So, if the hybrid can pair, which it can (since it's diploid), then their offspring can pair, right? So H is correct.

Wait, but the options are a list of possible outcomes. So, which of the options is correct.

Looking again, the question is about the descendants of "those plants with the double chromosome number." So, the descendants would be the ones that come from the double-chromosome plant. So, the double-chromosome plant is a hybrid with 2*(n + m) chromosomes. The descendants would be the ones that could form gametes from this hybrid.

So, for the descendants to be able to reproduce, the hybrid must be able to pair. If the hybrid can pair, then H is correct. So, option H is correct.

Wait, but the options are in a multiple-choice format, so the correct answer depends on which is the best fit.

Alternatively, another angle: the question says "spontaneously" the chromosome number doubles. So, this is a genetic event that happens, and the descendants of the double-chromosome plant would be able to pair normally, so they would be H correct.

But what about option F: more susceptible to disease. If the double chromosome number makes the plant more prone to disease, then F would be correct as well.

So, how do I decide between E and H?

Wait, let's think about the question again. The question is about the descendants of the plants with the double chromosome number. So, the plants in question already have a double chromosome number. So, their descendants would be the ones that result from their cross.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to clarify:

- Parent plants have different chromosome numbers, say n and m.

- Their hybrid has n + m.

- Sometimes, this hybrid's chromosome number doubles, becoming 2*(n + m). So, that's a higher number.

- The descendants of this hybrid would be the ones that come from it.

So, the descendants are the ones that are the offspring of this hybrid.

Now, what's the state of these descendants? They would have 2*(n + m) chromosomes.

So, for these, can they pair? Well, if 2*(n + m) is even, then they can pair. So, they can produce gametes. So, their ability to reproduce is normal.

So, descendants would be able to reproduce, making option H correct.

Alternatively, if the hybrid had 2*(n + m) as an odd number, they couldn't pair, but the question states that the chromosome number "spontaneously" doubles. I'm not sure about that part. So, perhaps the hybrid can pair, so H is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the descendants of the double-chromosome plants. So, the double-chromosome plants are the ones that already have the hybrid. So, the descendants of that would be their offspring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options.

Option E: More susceptible to disease because of more chromosomes. So, for instance, if the plant has a higher chance of being diploid, maybe it's more likely to be diseased. Or, perhaps the presence of more genes increases the risk.

Option H: Reproductive success because can pair. So, if the hybrid can pair, their offspring can reproduce, so H is correct.

I think the answer is more about the ability to pair, so H is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number. So, the double-chromosome plants are the ones that already have a double. So, their descendants would be the ones from that, which is the hybrid. So, their ability to pair determines whether they can reproduce.

So, if the hybrid can pair, H is correct. If not, then it's not.

Wait, but the initial question says the hybrid already has a double chromosome number, so it's 2*(n + m). So, that's an even number. So, they can pair. Therefore, the descendants would be able to reproduce, so H is correct.

So the answer would be option H.
</think>

The question involves hybrid plants with different chromosome numbers, which are sterile because their chromosomes cannot pair properly. However, sometimes the chromosome number of such hybrids doubles spontaneously. The question asks about the descendants of these double-chromosome plants.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The doubled chromosome number does not necessarily improve lifespan or reduce lifespan. Chromosome number changes do not directly affect lifespan.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While mutations are random, the increased chromosome number does not directly explain reduced mutation rates.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The hybrid cannot normally pair chromosomes, so it cannot reproduce, making this option wrong.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The descendants would not be genetically identical because the chromosome number has changed.
- **Option E**: Correct. If the double-chromosome plants are diploid, they are more susceptible to disease due to increased genetic variability.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While the increased chromosome number might make the plant more prone to disease, this is not necessarily the case.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The plant would not be genetically defective if the chromosome number has doubled.
- **Option H**: Correct. The descendants of the double-chromosome plants would be able to pair chromosomes normally, leading to successful reproduction.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The descendants would not be reproductively isolated because they can pair chromosomes.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The descendants would not regain the ability to reproduce sexually unless they can pair chromosomes.

### Conclusion:
The descendants of the double-chromosome plants would be able to pair chromosomes normally, making **Option H** the best description of their reproductive success.
