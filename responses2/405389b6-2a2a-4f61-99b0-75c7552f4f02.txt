Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about land costs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how the use of land is considered a cost, not counting the rent one has to pay. The options are A through J, but the last letter has to be the answer, so I'll note that.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying. I know that when someone uses land, they might have to pay rent, but the question is about costs that don't include rent. So, maybe it's about other expenses or implicit costs.

Option A: The cost of land is the price one pays to purchase it. Wait, that's the cost of purchasing, which is the explicit cost. So that's probably not the answer, because the question is about not counting rentâ€”so maybe it's about implicit costs.

Option B: The cost of land refers to the taxes one has to pay for owning it. Taxes might be a type of implicit cost, but I'm not sure if that's the correct answer. I'll keep this in mind and check the other options.

Option C: The cost of land is the cost of maintaining it. Maintenance costs are definitely explicit costs, not implicit. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: The use of land also constitutes a cost, in this sense an implicit cost, that is the money payments which the land resource could have earned in their best alternative employments. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think implicit costs are the opportunity costs. So when someone uses land, they might have to forgo the best alternative use of that land, which is the implicit cost. So D seems to fit.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about using land as a cost, not counting rent. So the alternative use of the land would be what someone else could do with the same land. If a person uses land and what they could have earned is less than what they give up, that's the implicit cost. So D is talking about that, which makes sense.

Option B mentions taxes, which I'm not certain about. But I think implicit costs are broader than just taxes. For example, if you use land for a business, the implicit cost is the money you could have earned by working elsewhere. So B might be a correct answer, but D seems more comprehensive.

The question is about using the land as a cost, so it's probably the implicit cost. So D is the correct answer.

The correct answer is D, as the use of land constitutes an implicit cost, representing the opportunity cost of using it instead of its best alternative. This is different from explicit costs like rent.

Answer: D
