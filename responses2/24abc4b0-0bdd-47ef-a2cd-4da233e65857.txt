Okay, so I have this question about where the TV show "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" is set. Hmm, I've seen the show before, but I'm not exactly sure about the location. Let me think about it.

I remember Mary Tyler Moore is an American singer and actress, but I don't think that's related to the show. Oh wait, right, Mary is the main actress in the show, not the singer. So the show is about Mary and her character, who's a former professional baseball player. 

Now, the show's location. I'm trying to recall if it's set in a city known for baseball. I think it's somewhere in California because Mary was born in Los Angeles. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that TV shows often set their locations in cities where they're based. Mary's home is in Los Angeles, so maybe the show is in that area.

Looking at the options, E is Los Angeles, F is Boston, D is San Francisco, etc. I think the show is set in Los Angeles. I'm pretty confident now because Mary's home is there, and the show is named after her, so it makes sense the location is in a place she's based in.
