Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about foods and whether they contain free sugars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given foods do NOT contain free sugars. Free sugars, or glucose, are a type of sugar that's naturally present in foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains. So, if a food has free sugars, it's probably labeled as something like "natural" or "unsweetened," which I think is common in the options.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: White bread. I know white bread is a commonly used substitute for whole grains. I think it's sweetened, so it probably contains free sugars. So A is out.

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If it's a canned fruit, like apple juice, then it's being made into syrup. I'm not sure if that affects the sugar content. Maybe it's just a concentrate. But if it's unsweetened, it might not have free sugars. Or wait, if it's labeled as unsweetened, the sugar is artificial, not free. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Canned fruit in syrup usually contains artificial sugar, right? So maybe it's sweetened, meaning it has some free sugars. Or maybe it's unsweetened but still has free. I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I'll come back to this.

Option C: Maple syrup. Maple syrup is made from maple trees. I think maple syrup is naturally sweetened with sugar, so it's probably high in free sugars. So C is out.

Option D: Honey. I remember honey is known for being high in natural sugars, which are free sugars. So D is out.

Option E: Natural unsweetened orange juice. Natural juice is typically sweetened with sugar, so unless it's unsweetened, it would have free sugars. But the option says "natural unsweetened," which implies no free sugars. So E might be the correct answer.

Option F: Cows' milk. Cows' milk is a whole milk product, which is sweetened. I think cows' milk is typically unsweetened, but wait, no, cows' milk is usually sweetened. Oh wait, is it? Wait, no, cows' milk is usually sweetened, but I'm not sure about being natural or unsweetened. Or maybe cows' milk can be unsweetened? I might be getting this mixed up. Wait, I think regular milk is sweetened, so cows' milk is likely sweetened. So F is out.

Option G: Agave nectar. Agave is a plant that produces agave nectar, which is known for its high sugar content. It's sweetened, so it definitely has free sugars. So G is out.

Option H: Fruit flavored yogurt. Yggdrasil is a type of yogurt that's often flavored with fruits and is unsweetened. So it has no free sugars. So H is a candidate.

Option I: Unsweetened iced tea. Iced tea is sweetened, so even if it's unsweetened, it must have free sugars. So I is out.

Now, the options that don't have free sugars would be those that are naturally sweet or have artificial sugars. So checking again.

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. If it's unsweetened, maybe it's just the concentrate, but the syrup is sweetened. But if it's labeled as unsweetened, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, if it's natural, it might not have free sugars. Wait, but I'm not sure about this one. I've heard that canned fruit in syrup can sometimes be unsweetened, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, another approach: which of the options are known to have free sugars?

Looking back: natural unsweetened orange juice (E) has no free sugars. Free sugars are typically present in things like apples, bananas, carrots, dates, etc. So, if something is naturally sweetened, it has free sugars.

So, for the question, which don't have free sugars, we're looking for foods that are naturally sweet, or perhaps unsweetened but not naturally sweet.

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. If it's unsweetened, perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, if it's just a concentrate, maybe it's unsweetened, but perhaps that's not the case. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of other options. Option H, fruit flavored yogurt, is unsweetened and has no free sugars. Option E, natural unsweetened orange juice, same as H. Option G, agave nectar, is sweetened, so out.

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. If it's unsweetened, then it's correct, but if it's just a concentrate, maybe it's sweetened? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects that canned fruit in syrup has free sugars because it's made from natural fruits, but maybe they're unsweetened, so that would be correct.

Wait, let me think again. Canned fruit in syrup is typically sweetened with sugar, so it would have free sugars. Unless it's unsweetened, but the option says "natural unsweetened," which implies no free sugars. So if B is natural and unsweetened, then it has no free sugars, making B a correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps B is unsweetened, so it doesn't have free sugars. So the correct answer would be B and H.

Wait, no, the options are A to I. Let me check each again.

Looking back:

A: White bread – has free sugars.
B: Canned fruit in syrup – possibly no free sugars, but if it's unsweetened, then it's correct.
C: Maple syrup – has free sugars.
D: Honey – has free sugars.
E: Natural unsweetened orange juice – no free sugars.
F: Cows' milk – is it sweetened? I'm not sure. If it's unsweetened, then no free sugars. But cows' milk is usually sweetened, so maybe F is out.
G: Agave nectar – has free sugars.
H: Fruit flavored yogurt – no free sugars.
I: Unsweetened iced tea – has free sugars.

So possible answers are B, E, H, and F? Wait, no, F is cows' milk, which is probably sweetened. So E is correct, H is correct.

Wait, the question is which do not contain free sugars. So the correct foods are those that have no free sugars.

So possible correct options are E and H.

Wait, but the options are one letter each, and the question is which do NOT. So I need to pick the correct one.

Looking back, the options are:

Looking at the options, E is natural unsweetened orange juice, which is likely unsweetened but has free sugars? Or is it unsweetened and free? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B and H. But according to the options, each is a separate choice, so I need to pick one.

Wait, but let me think about each option again.

Option E: Natural unsweetened orange juice. If it's unsweetened, then it's free of free sugars. So E would have no free sugars. But I thought that natural juice is usually sweetened. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, if it's unsweetened, then yes, it's correct.

Option H: Fruit flavored yogurt is unsweetened and has no free sugars. So H is correct.

So which of the options don't have free sugars? So B, E, H.

Wait, but the question asks which do not contain free sugars. So the correct answer would be the options that are natural and sweet, or unsweetened and free.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer choices are B, E, H.

Wait, but the options are only one letter. So the possible correct choices are E and H.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check each option.

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. If it's unsweetened, then it's correct. But perhaps the actual answer is E and H.

Wait, but the options are single letters. So the correct answer must be one of them. Let me think about each:

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. If it's unsweetened, then it's correct. So that's E, but wait, E is natural unsweetened orange juice, which is sweetened, so E would have free sugars.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. For example, natural unsweetened orange juice is probably sweetened, so it has free sugars. Therefore, E would have free sugars, so it's not correct.

Wait, but the option says "natural unsweetened orange juice." So if it's unsweetened, it must have no free sugars. So E is correct.

Similarly, H is fruit flavored yogurt, which is unsweetened, so it has no free sugars.

So the options that do not contain free sugars are E and H.

Wait, but the question is which of the following foods do NOT contain free sugars. So the correct options are E and H.

But the answer choices are single letters, so perhaps the correct answers are E and H, but I need to see which one is in the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

E: Natural unsweetened orange juice – correct.

H: Fruit flavored yogurt – correct.

So the options are E and H, but perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating B.

Wait, another approach: the question is about foods that do NOT contain free sugars. So the options that have natural sugars or artificial sugars.

Looking at the list, the options that are naturally sweet are A, C, F, G, I.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is E and H, but perhaps the question is only expecting one option. Let me think.

Wait, the question says, "Which of the following foods do not contain free sugars." So the correct options are those that have no free sugars, i.e., natural sugars.

So the correct options would be E (natural, unsweetened, no free) and H (unsweetened, no free sugars).

But in the given options, each is a separate choice. So the possible correct options are E and H.

Wait, but the original question expects one answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating B.

Wait, perhaps option B is correct. Wait, if it's unsweetened, then it has no free sugars. So B is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option again:

A: White bread – has free sugars. So no.

B: Canned fruit in syrup – if unsweetened, no free sugars. So yes, correct.

C: Maple syrup – has free sugars. No.

D: Honey – has free sugars. No.

E: Natural unsweetened orange juice – no free sugars. Yes.

F: Cows' milk – is it sweetened? I think yes, so it has free sugars. No.

G: Agave nectar – has free sugars. No.

H: Fruit flavored yogurt – no free sugars. Yes.

I: Unsweetened iced tea – has free sugars. No.

So the correct options are B, E, H.

But the question is asking which of the following foods do not contain free sugars, so the correct options are B, E, and H.

Wait, but the answer options are single letters. So perhaps the question expects me to pick all that apply, but I think the question is in one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answers are E and H.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which of the following foods do not contain free sugars." So the correct foods are those that do not have free sugars, which would be E and H.

But perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me verify each:

Option E: Natural unsweetened orange juice. It's unsweetened, so it's free of free sugars. So correct.

Option H: Fruit flavored yogurt. Unsweetened, so no free sugars. Correct.

So the correct options are E and H. But the question expects a single letter, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question is looking for all correct options, but the way it's phrased is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option again:

Which foods have free sugars? All except the correct ones.

So the correct options are those without free sugars. So E and H.

Wait, but the question is presented as a multiple-choice with four options (A to I) and the user is to pick one letter. Wait, no, the question lists all the options as options A to I, each a separate choice, and the user needs to select the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for which of the given foods do not have free sugars, and the options are letters A to I. So for each option, I need to pick which ones are correct.

But I think the correct answer is E and H, but the options are single letters, so perhaps the question expects only one correct option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating H.

Wait, but the user provided that the options are A to I, each is a possible correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate each option.

Option B: Canned fruit in syrup. If it's unsweetened, then it's correct. But wait, if it's unsweetened, the sugar is artificial, not free. So perhaps it's not free, but the option is labeled as unsweetened, which implies no free sugars. So B is correct.

Option E: Natural unsweetened orange juice – correct, no free sugars.

Option H: Fruit flavored yogurt – correct, no free sugars.

So the correct answers are B, E, H.

But the question lists all the options as possible answers with single letters, so perhaps the correct letter is E and H, but I can only choose one. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E and H, but in the given options, perhaps E is the main one.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, maybe I should look for the most likely intended answer.

In the options, B is about natural unsweetened fruit in syrup, which would have free sugars because it's unsweetened. So if it's unsweetened, it's correct.

So the correct answers are E, H, and B.

But the options are letters A to I, each a single choice. So perhaps the correct choices are E and H.

Wait, but the user's question seems to be asking which of the following foods do not contain free sugars, and the options are A to I, each a separate choice. So the correct options are E and H.

But since the question is asking which of the following foods do not contain free sugars, the correct answer would be E and H. But the user expects a single letter. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E and H, but the options are single letters, so the correct answer is E and H, but perhaps the user is only expecting one option, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is E and H, but in the options, the user is to choose one letter, so perhaps the correct answer is E and H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and H. But in the given options, the user might have only one correct answer, perhaps E.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the answer.

The possible correct options are E and H.

But the user is to pick one, perhaps E is the correct answer.

The question asks which foods do not contain free sugars. Free sugars are naturally occurring sugars, such as those found in fruits, vegetables, and grains. The analysis of each option is as follows:

- **A: White bread** – Contains free sugars from carbohydrates.  
- **B: Canned fruit in syrup** – If unsweetened, it contains artificial free sugars. However, if it's naturally sweetened, it would have free sugars.  
- **C: Maple syrup** – Contains free sugars from natural sugar production.  
- **D: Honey** – Contains free sugars, typically natural sugars.  
- **E: Natural unsweetened orange juice** – Typically sweetened, so it may contain free sugars. However, if unsweetened, it would have no free sugars.  
- **F: Cows' milk** – Often sweetened, so it likely contains free sugars.  
- **G: Agave nectar** – Contains natural sugars, making it unsweetened.  
- **H: Fruit flavored yogurt** – Unsweetened, so it has no free sugars.  
- **I: Unsweetened iced tea** – Contains free sugars.  

The correct answers are **E (natural unsweetened orange juice)** and **H (fruit flavored yogurt)**, as they do not contain free sugars. However, since the user expects a single letter, **E** is the most likely intended correct answer, as it is a common example of a naturally sweetened product with free sugars.

ANSWER: E
