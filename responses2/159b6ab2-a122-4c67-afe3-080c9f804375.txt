Okay, so I have this problem here about a stock that was sold at a 13.5% gain. I need to find out what percent the selling price is of the original cost. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, let's break it down. If the stock was sold at a 13.5% gain, that means the selling price is higher than the original cost. The gain percentage is calculated based on the original cost, right? So, a 13.5% gain would mean the selling price is 100% plus 13.5%, which is 113.5% of the original cost. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Yes, because if the original cost is 100 units, a 13.5% gain would add 13.5 units, making the selling price 113.5. So, as a percentage of the original cost, it's 113.5%. Looking at the options, option C is 108.5%, which doesn't match. Oh wait, did I mix something up?

Wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Let me make sure. The selling price is the original cost plus 13.5% of it. So, formula-wise, selling price = cost * (1 + gain%). So, that's cost * 1.135. So, the selling price is 113.5% of the original cost. So, the correct answer should be 113.5%, which is option C. But wait, option C is 108.5%, which isn't matching. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. The question says the stock was sold at a gain of 13.5 percent on its original cost. So, yes, the selling price is 113.5% of the original cost. So, the correct answer should be C. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, the options are:

A: 110%
B: 103.5%
C: 108.5%
D: 123.5%
E: 130.5%
F: 100%
G: 113.5%
H: 90.5%
I: 126.5%
J: 115%

So, option C is 108.5%, which is different from what I calculated. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Wait, perhaps I got the gain reversed. Let me think: a 13.5% gain implies that the selling price is 100% + 13.5% = 113.5% of the original. So, the selling price is 113.5%, which is option C. So why is option C not matching? Wait, no, I just checked the options again. Oh, right, option C is 108.5%, which is 100 + 8.5, but that doesn't match. So, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the cost and selling price differently. Let's define the original cost as C. The gain is 13.5%, so the selling price (SP) is C plus 13.5% of C. So, SP = C * (1 + 0.135) = 1.135C. So, SP is 113.5% of C, which is option C. So the correct answer should be C, but I see that option C is 108.5%, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing gain as a percentage of the selling price instead of the original cost. No, the question says the gain is 13.5% on the original cost. So, the selling price is 113.5% of the original. So the correct answer should be 113.5%, which is option C. So why isn't that the case? Because looking at the options, option C is 108.5%. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The question says the gain is 13.5% on the original cost. So, the selling price is (100% + 13.5%) = 113.5% of the original. So, the correct answer should be 113.5%, which is option C. But in the options, option C is 108.5%. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I misread the options.

Wait, let's look again. The options are:

A: 110%
B: 103.5%
C: 108.5%
D: 123.5%
E: 130.5%
F: 100%
G: 113.5%
H: 90.5%
I: 126.5%
J: 115%

Oh, I see! Option G is 113.5%, which matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option G. But earlier, I thought option C was correct. Hmm, I must have confused myself. So the correct answer is G, 113.5%.

The selling price is 113.5% of the original cost, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
