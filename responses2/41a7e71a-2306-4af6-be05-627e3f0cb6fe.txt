Okay, so I've got this question about the moons of Mars. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about planetary systems. Let me think. The question is asking which pair of names are the two moons of Mars. The options are A through J, each with different combinations.

Wait, I think the two moons of Mars are Deimos and Phobos. Right, Deimos is a moon that's farther out, and Phobos is closer. I've heard that they're often paired with other moons, like Deimos has two satellites, Phobos and another one called "Deimos 2." And Phobos has another satellite named "Demi."

Looking at the options, option G is Phobos and Tritos. Wait, no, that's probably not right. Option B is Phobos and Demos. Demos doesn't sound right. Option H is Phobos and Triton. I don't think that's correct either. Option E is Tritos and Desmos. Desmos isn't a known planet, I think. Option J is Deimos and Mars I. Mars I isn't a moon, that's a rock.

Wait, the options are likely made up, but I should remember the correct ones. So, the correct pair is Deimos and Phobos. Now looking at the options again, what's the right combination. Option G says Phobos and Tritos. No, that's not right. Option H is Phobos and Triton. Wait, I thought the two main ones are Phobos and Deimos. So the correct pair should be Phobos and Deimos.

Looking at the options, option D is Phobos and Deimos. So that's the correct one. The other options either mix up the names or use incorrect or non-existent names. So the answer should be option D.
