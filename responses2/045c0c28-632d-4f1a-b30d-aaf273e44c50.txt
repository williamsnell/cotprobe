Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending zinc supplements for certain groups. Hmm, I remember that zinc is an important mineral, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact recommendations. Let me think this through.

The options are A through J. The question is asking which group the WHO recommends zinc supplements for. I'm trying to recall the symptoms associated with zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency can cause issues like malnutrition, stunting, and diarrhea. So the WHO probably recommends zinc supplements to help those affected.

Looking at the options:

A: Men with high physical activity. I don't think so. Men might get more nutrients through food, but zinc isn't the main focus here.

B: All women over 50. I don't recall zinc being recommended for older women. That might be for something else, like vitamin D, but zinc is more about overall health.

C: All children in high income areas with low stunting. That sounds plausible. Zinc helps with growth, so children with stunting might benefit.

D: Elderly people with low incomes. Again, I don't think that's the focus. The WHO probably targets younger demographics, especially children, for zinc supplements.

E: Adolescents in high-stress environments. Stress can affect growth, so maybe they need more zinc. But is this the main group?

F: Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhea. That's a clear indication. Zinc helps with those symptoms.

G: All children in low income areas with high prevalence of stunting. Wait, if the income level is low, would that mean more stunting? I'm not sure. Maybe the WHO is suggesting that children in low income areas, especially those with stunting, need zinc.

Wait, I think the WHO recommends giving zinc supplements to all children in low-income areas with high prevalence of stunting. So option G says "low income areas with high prevalence of stunting." That sounds right.

Option H: Patients recovering from surgery. That's more for surgical patients, not about general health.

Option I: Pregnant and lactating women. They might take zinc supplements, but the question is about groups, and the WHO is targeting the general population, not just specific groups.

Option J: All adults in areas with high prevalence of zinc deficiency. That's the opposite of what they're trying to do. They don't want to recommend supplements where they're already deficient; that would help with the deficiency.

So putting it together, the best answer is G. Because G is about children in low-income areas with a high prevalence of stunting, which is a common issue that zinc helps with.

The World Health Organization recommends zinc supplements for children in low-income areas with a high prevalence of stunting. 

Answer: G
