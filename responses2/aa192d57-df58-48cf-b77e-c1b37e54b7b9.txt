Okay, so I have this economics question here about fiscal policy and how it affects the economy. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll think it out.

The question is asking: "There is relatively more crowding out as the result of expansionary fiscal policy when..." and then it gives several options, from A to J. Crowding out refers to the situation where expansionary measures cause reduced private sector investments or consumption. So, when the government increases spending or cuts taxes, it can affect the economy in different ways.

I remember that expansionary fiscal policy (like increasing government spending or cutting taxes) can lead to crowding out. The question is asking under what condition this happens more, so I need to think about the factors that make expansionary fiscal policy more likely to crowd out private investment or spending.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Central bank pursues a contractionary policy. Wait, that's opposite. If the central bank is contractionary, it would reduce the money supply, which might not directly tie into fiscal policy. Expansionary fiscal policy usually leads to crowding out because it increases government borrowing. So A isn't the right answer because it's the opposite of what the question is asking.

Option B: Expansionary monetary policy with fiscal. Hmm, this seems like it's happening at the same time. Expansionary monetary policy (like increasing the money supply) would typically cause lower interest rates, which would encourage more borrowing and investment. But if the fiscal policy is expansionary, the effect could be that private investment is crowded out. But I'm not sure if this is the condition for more crowding out.

Option C: Government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending. Wait, cutting taxes increases government spending because it's like a tax cut, which is a spending increase. So if the government is increasing its spending, that could cause crowding out. Alternatively, if the government is cutting taxes, it's a spending cut, which would stimulate the economy. So in this case, the government is cutting taxes, which leads to increased spending. So if the fiscal policy is expansionary (more spending), then this would be when the crowding out is more likely. So option C is when the government is cutting taxes, which would lead to more crowding out.

Option D: Investment demand curve is perfectly inelastic. That doesn't make sense. Perfectly inelastic demand means quantity doesn't respond much to price changes. That would imply that people don't care about price changes, which isn't related to fiscal policy. So D is probably not the answer.

Option E: Government spending improves profit expectations. If the government expects better profit from increased spending, that could lead to more private investment. Because higher expected returns might push people to invest more, not less. So when the government expects better profits, it might crowd out private spending. So this is a possibility. But does that make the crowding out larger or smaller? If expectations improve, people might invest more, so the effect could be a stronger crowding out. Or maybe the opposite.

Option F: Investment demand curve is inelastic. If the curve is inelastic, then changes in price don't affect investment much. But that's about the responsiveness of investment to price changes, not directly about how fiscal policy affects it. So this seems unrelated to the crowding out effect.

Option G: Investment demand curve is elastic. An elastic curve means that investment is very responsive to price changes. So if the curve is elastic, then a decrease in interest rates (due to expansionary policy) would lead to a big increase in investment. But I'm not sure how this ties into whether the fiscal policy is causing crowding out or not.

Option H: The economy is in a boom period. If the economy is booms, people are more willing to spend and save, so expansionary policies might not crowd out as much because there's more demand. So in this case, expansionary fiscal policy might not crowd out as much, so H isn't the answer where crowding out is higher.

Option I: Economy is in a recession. That's when private investment is high. If the economy is in a recession, expansionary fiscal policies (which increase government spending) would have a bigger impact because people are already spending a lot. So in a recession, expansionary fiscal policy would crowd out less. So I is the opposite scenario.

Option J: Government spending focused on infrastructure. I'm not sure about the relation here. If the government is spending on infrastructure, that's a big investment, and perhaps reduces other spending. But I'm not sure how that directly causes crowding out.

The question is about when expansionary fiscal policy causes more crowding out. So I need to find when the expansionary policy leads to more private investment being reduced.

Option C says the government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending. So if the government is cutting taxes, that's a spending increase. So this would be an expansionary fiscal policy. So when the government is cutting taxes, which is expansionary, it would cause more crowding out because the tax cut increases government spending, which can lead to higher interest rates, making private investment less attractive. So this situation would mean that expansionary fiscal policy (cutting taxes) causes more crowding out.

Alternatively, option C is when the government is cutting taxes, which is expansionary. So that's when the expansionary policy leads to more crowding out.

Wait, let me think again. If the government cuts taxes, it's increasing government spending. This would increase the demand for public goods and services, which can lead to higher interest rates. High interest rates make borrowing cheaper, so private investments (like in new housing, equipment) might be less attractive. So yes, this would cause crowding out.

So option C says the government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending. Wait, no. If the government is cutting taxes, that's a spending increase. So if the government is cutting taxes, it's expanding its spending, which is an expansionary policy. So when the government is cutting taxes (expansionary), it would cause more crowding out.

So the question is asking when expansionary fiscal policy causes more crowding out. So when is that the case? When the government is expanding, i.e., increasing spending, or cutting taxes, which is also expansionary.

Wait, so in the options, C says "the government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending." Wait, if it's cutting taxes, that's increasing spending, which is expansionary. So C is when the government is cutting taxes, which is expansionary. So in that scenario, the expansionary fiscal policy (cuts taxes) causes more crowding out.

So the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, looking at option I: economy in a recession. When the economy is in a recession, expansionary fiscal policy would have less effect, so less crowding out. But the question is when it causes more. So when the economy is in a boom, expansionary policies would crowd out less. So option H says the economy is in a boom period, which is when crowding out is less, so the opposite.

Wait, so the scenario when expansionary fiscal policy causes more crowding out is when the government is increasing spending. Because if they cut taxes, that's expansionary, leading to higher spending, higher interest rates, less private investment.

So looking back at the options, C is the correct answer because when the government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending (which is expansionary), it's leading to more crowding out.

The question asks under what condition expansionary fiscal policy leads to more crowding out. Crowding out occurs when expansionary measures reduce private sector investments or spending. Expansionary fiscal policy typically involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes, which can lead to higher interest rates and reduced private investment.

**Option A** is incorrect because it describes a contractionary policy, which opposes expansionary fiscal policy.

**Option B** is not directly relevant because it refers to expansionary monetary policy, which is unrelated to fiscal policy's impact on crowding out.

**Option C** correctly identifies that when the government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending (which is expansionary), it leads to more crowding out. Cutting taxes increases government spending, raising interest rates and reducing private investment.

**Option D** and **Option E** are unrelated to the question, as they describe the behavior of the investment demand curve and profit expectations, neither of which directly affects crowding out.

**Option F** and **Option G** are about the elasticity of the investment demand curve and are unrelated to the question.

**Option H** is incorrect because a boom period reduces the impact of expansionary fiscal policy on private investment.

**Option I** is incorrect because a recession reduces the impact of expansionary fiscal policy.

**Option J** is irrelevant to the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the scenario where expansionary fiscal policy (cutting taxes) leads to more crowding out.

**ANSWER: C**
