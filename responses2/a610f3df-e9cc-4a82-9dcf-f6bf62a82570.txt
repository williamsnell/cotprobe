Question:

The midterm scores for a statistics course were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. The final exam scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. One student had a score of 58 points on the midterm. If she had the same standardized score (z-score) on the final exam, what must her score have been?

Options:

A: 127 points
B: 58 points
C: 132 points
D: 102 points
E: 92 points
F: 122 points
G: 15 points
H: 118 points
I: 112 points
J: 142 points

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let me read it again and try to break it down. 

The question says that the midterm scores are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. The final exam is also normally distributed, but with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. 

A student scored 58 points on the midterm. Now, if this same z-score (standardized score) applies to the final exam, what would her final exam score be? The options are given from A to J, and I need to find out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. So, z-scores are a way to compare where a particular value stands relative to the mean. The formula for the z-score is z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

First, let's calculate the z-score for the student's midterm score. She scored 58, the mean is 52, and the standard deviation is 4.

So, z = (58 - 52) / 4. Let me compute that. 58 minus 52 is 6, divided by 4 is 1.5. So the z-score is 1.5.

Now, this same z-score applies to the final exam. So, we need to find the corresponding X value (the final exam score) given that same z-score. 

The formula rearranged to solve for X is: X = μ + (z * σ). 

The final exam has a mean of 112 and a standard deviation of 10. We already found z is 1.5. So plugging in the numbers: X = 112 + (1.5 * 10).

Calculating that: 1.5 times 10 is 15. Adding that to 112 gives 127. Wait, no, because 112 +15 is 127? Wait, wait, no, 112 + 15 is 127, yes. So that's 127.

Looking at the options, option A is 127 points. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the z-score correctly? Midterm: 58, mean 52, std 4. 58-52=6, 6/4 is 1.5. Correct. Final exam: X=112 + (1.5 *10)= 112+15=127. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the right answer is A, 127 points.

The student's z-score on the midterm is calculated as (58 - 52)/4 = 1.5. Using the same z-score for the final exam, the final score is 112 + (1.5 * 10) = 127. 

Answer: A
