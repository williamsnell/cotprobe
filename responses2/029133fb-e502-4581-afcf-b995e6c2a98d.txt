Okay, so I've got this question here about converting a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Let's see, the temperature is given as -10°C. Hmm, I remember that converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit has a specific formula. Oh right, the formula is F = (C × 9/5) + 32. And for Kelvin, I think the formula is K = C + 273. 

Let me plug in the numbers. For Fahrenheit, it's (-10°C multiplied by 9/5) plus 32. Wait, calculating that: 9/5 of -10 is... let's see, 10 divided by 5 is 2, so 9 times 2 is 18, but since it's negative, it's -18. Then add 32, so -18 +32 is 14. So Fahrenheit is 14°F. That seems right. 

What about Kelvin? It's just adding 273 to the Celsius temperature. So -10 +273 is 263 K. So the absolute Kelvin is 263 K. 

Now looking at the options, I need to find the pair that matches 14°F and 263K. Let's go through them. 

Option A: -10°F and 263K. Wait, no, the Fahrenheit part is -10, which we calculated as 14. So A is wrong. 

Option B: 14°F and 263K. Yeah, that matches. 

Wait, what about the others? Let me check. I think option B is the correct one. So the answer should be B.

To convert -10°C to Fahrenheit and Kelvin:

1. **Fahrenheit Calculation**: 
   - Use the formula \( F = (C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32 \).
   - \( F = (-10 \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32 = (-18) + 32 = 14°F \).

2. **Kelvin Calculation**: 
   - Use the formula \( K = C + 273 \).
   - \( K = -10 + 273 = 263 K \).

The correct option matches \( 14°F \) and \( 263K \), which is **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
