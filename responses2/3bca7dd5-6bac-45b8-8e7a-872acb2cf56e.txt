Question:

Of the several ways in which the supersonic transport (SST) acts as a pollutant, one is by the elimination of carbon dioxide (CO_2). During normal flight, CO_2 is released at a temperature of about 627°C and at a press-ure of 0.41 atm at an estimated rate of 6.6 × 10^4 kg per hour. To what volume does this amount of gas correspond?

Okay, so I have this question about the supersonic transport and calculating the volume of CO₂ it emits. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the question gives me some data: the CO₂ is released at 627°C and 0.41 atm, and it happens at a rate of 6.6e4 kg per hour. I need to find out what volume this corresponds to.

Wait, I think I need to use the ideal gas law for this. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But I'm not given pressure, volume, or temperature in the question. Oh wait, wait, the temperature is given in Celsius, right? So I should convert that to Kelvin. 627°C is 627 + 273 = 900 K. Okay, that's the temperature.

The pressure is 0.41 atm. I'll keep that as is for now. The number of moles, n, I'm not given. But wait, I do have the mass. The mass is 6.6e4 kg per hour. Oh, right, I should convert that into moles because the ideal gas law uses moles.

Wait, moles can be found using molar mass. CO₂'s molar mass is 44 g/mol, since C is 12, O is 16 each. So 12 + 32 = 44 g/mol. Oh wait, wait! I need to convert kg to grams. 6.6e4 kg is 6.6e7 grams. So moles = grams / molar mass. 6.6e7 g / 44 g/mol = let's calculate that. 6.6e7 /44 is 1.5e6 mol. Wait, wait, 44 * 1.5e6 is 6.6e7? Let me check: 44 * 1.5e6 = (44 * 1.5) * 1e6 = 66 * 1e6 = 6.6e7. Yes, correct.

So moles, n = 1.5e6 mol.

Now, the ideal gas law: V = nRT / P.

But wait, what's the pressure in terms of standard units? Because R is in L·atm/(mol·K) if pressure is in atm. Alternatively, if pressure is in Pa, R would be different. But here, I think the pressure is given in atm, so using R in L·atm/(mol·K) is appropriate.

What's the value of R? I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Yeah, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

V = (1.5e6 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 900 K) / 0.41 atm.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply the terms in the numerator: 1.5e6 * 0.0821 * 900.

1.5e6 * 0.0821 = let's compute that. 1.5e6 is 1,500,000. 1,500,000 * 0.0821 = 123150.0 (Wait, 0.08 * 1.5e6 is 120,000, 0.0021*1.5e6=3150. So 123150 exactly.)

Then multiply by 900: 123150 * 900. Wait, 123150 * 900 = 123150 * 9 * 100. 123150 *9 is 1,108,350. Multiply by 100 is 110,835,000. So numerator is 110,835,000 L·atm.

Wait, no, wait: because n is 1.5e6, R is 0.0821, T is 900. So 1.5e6 * 0.0821 = 1,23150? Wait, 1.5e6 is 1,500,000. 1,500,000 * 0.0821 = 123150. Then 123150 *900 = 110,835,000. So yeah.

Divide by pressure, which is 0.41 atm.

So V = 110,835,000 / 0.41 ≈ let me compute that.

110,835,000 ÷ 0.41.

Hmm, 0.41 is approximately 0.4, which is 1/2.44. So 110,835,000 * 2.44 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 110,835,000 / 0.41.

Well, 0.41 * 270,000,000 is 0.41 * 270e6 = let's compute 270e6 * 0.41.

270e6 * 0.41 = 110.7e6 = 110,700,000. Wait, but 110,700,000 is 0.41 * 270e6.

Wait, but our numerator is 110,835,000. So 110,835,000 is 110.835e6.

So 110.835e6 = (110.7e6) + 0.135e6.

Wait, 0.41 * 270,000,000 is 110,700,000. So 110,835,000 minus 110,700,000 is 135,000.

So 135,000 / 0.41 = approx 329,756. So V is approximately 270,000,000 + 329,756 = 270,329,756 liters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 110,835,000 / 0.41 = ?

Let me compute 110,835,000 ÷ 0.41.

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.41: let's see.

But perhaps it's easier to compute as:

Divide 110,835,000 by 0.41.

Compute 0.41 * 270,000,000 = 0.41 * 2.7e8 = let's compute 0.4 * 2.7e8 = 1.08e8, and 0.01 * 2.7e8 = 2.7e6. So 1.08e8 + 2.7e6 = 1.0827e8 = 108,270,000.

Wait, wait, wait. No, 0.41 * 2.7e8 is ... 2.7e8 * 0.4 is 1.08e8, 2.7e8 * 0.01 is 2.7e6. So total is 1.08e8 + 2.7e6 = 108,270,000.

But our calculation is 110,835,000. So 110,835,000 is 108,270,000 + 2,565,000.

So 110,835,000 = 2.7e8 * 0.41 + 2.565e6. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, let me compute 110,835,000 ÷ 0.41.

Let me do this division step by step.

0.41 goes into 110,835,000 how many times?

Well, 0.41 * 270,000,000 = 110,700,000.

So 110,835,000 is 110,700,000 + 135,000.

So 0.41 * 270,000,000 = 110,700,000.

The remaining is 135,000.

0.41 * x = 135,000 → x = 135,000 / 0.41 ≈ 329,756. So total V is 270,000,000 + 329,756 ≈ 270,329,756 liters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest options are option B: 2.7e9 liters, and option E: 2.7e5, but wait.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 2.7 × 10^7 → 27 million liters.

B: 2.7e9 → 2.7 billion liters.

C: 1.5e8 → 150 million.

D: 1.2e7 → 12 million.

E: 2.7e5 → 270,000.

F: 5.5e8 → 550 million.

G: 2.7e8 → 270 million.

H: 2.7e6 → 2.7 million.

I: 3.2e9 → 3.2 billion.

J: 8e6 → 8 million.

So our calculation was approximately 270 million, which is 2.7e8 liters. Looking at the options, option G is 2.7e8. But wait, wait—did I compute correctly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, another approach: using the ideal gas law, maybe I should compute using R = 8.314 J/mol·K, but that would require pressure in Pascals.

Wait, because R in L·atm/(mol·K) is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). But if I use R = 8.314 J/(mol·K), then I need to convert pressure from atm to Pascals.

Wait, yeah, perhaps I missed that.

Wait, maybe I should try using R in different units.

Another way: let me compute using SI units. Let's see.

So, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Pressure in Pascals, volume in m^3, moles as before.

But let's see:

1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So, the pressure is 0.41 atm → 0.41 * 101325 Pa = 41,546.25 Pa.

Wait, 0.41 * 101325 = 41,546.25 Pa.

Wait, moles n = 1.5e6 mol.

Temperature T = 900 K.

So, V = nRT/P = (1.5e6 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (900 K) / (41546.25 Pa).

Compute numerator: 1.5e6 * 8.314 * 900.

1.5e6 * 8.314 = 12,471,000.

Multiply by 900: 12,471,000 * 900 = 11,223,900,000.

Denominator: 41,546.25.

So V = 11,223,900,000 / 41,546.25 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that.

Well, 41,546.25 is approximately 4.1546e4.

11,223,900,000 ÷ 4.1546e4 = ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e4: numerator is 112.239e6, denominator 4.1546.

So 112.239e6 /4.1546 ≈ approx 270,000,000 liters.

Wait, that's 2.7e8 liters. Which is option G.

But wait, earlier when I used R in L·atm, I got around 270 million liters. So that's about 2.7e8 liters, which is option G.

Wait, but why did I get 270 million when I did the first calculation? Because when I used R as 0.0821, 110,835,000 / 0.41 ≈ 270,000,000 liters (2.7e8).

Ah, so both methods give the same result. So the correct answer is option G: 2.7 × 10^8 liters.

To determine the volume of CO₂ emitted by the supersonic transport (SST) during a 1-hour flight, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

### Step 1: Convert given values to appropriate units
- **Temperature (T):** The temperature is given as \( 627^\circ \text{C} \). Converting to Kelvin:
  \[
  T = 627 + 273 = 900 \, \text{K}
  \]
- **Pressure (P):** The pressure is \( 0.41 \, \text{atm} \).
- **Molar mass of CO₂:** \( 44 \, \text{g/mol} \).
- **Rate of CO₂ emission:** \( 6.6 \times 10^4 \, \text{kg/h} \).

First, convert the rate to moles per hour:
\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{6.6 \times 10^4 \, \text{kg/h}}{0.44 \, \text{kg/mol}} = 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol/h}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the ideal gas law
Using the ideal gas law:
\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]
- **Gas constant (R):** \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \).
- **Pressure (P):** \( 0.41 \, \text{atm} \).

Substitute the values:
\[
V = \frac{(1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol})(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(900 \, \text{K})}{0.41 \, \text{atm}}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculations
1. Calculate the numerator:
   \[
   (1.5 \times 10^6)(0.0821)(900) = 110,835,000 \, \text{L·atm}
   \]
2. Divide by the pressure:
   \[
   V = \frac{110,835,000}{0.41} \approx 270,000,000 \, \text{L}
   \]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated volume is approximately \( 2.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{L} \), which corresponds to **option G**.
