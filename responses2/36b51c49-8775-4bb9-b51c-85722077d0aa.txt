Okay, so I have this problem here where 10 people are split into three committees of 3, 4, and 3 people respectively. I need to figure out how many ways this can be done. Hmm, let's break it down. 

First, I remember that when dividing people into groups, we have to consider whether the groups are distinguishable or not. In this case, the committees are different, so the order of the committees matters. That means the committees are distinct, right? So the order in which we select the people for each committee matters. 

I think the formula for dividing n people into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km is n! divided by the product of (k1! * k2! * ... * km!). But wait, I need to make sure I'm applying this correctly. 

So in this problem, the total number of people is 10. The committees are of sizes 3,4,3. So the formula would be 10! divided by (3! *4! *3!). But wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no, because when the groups are of different sizes, each division is unique. So the formula is correct.

Let me compute that. 10 factorial is 10×9×8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1. But wait, perhaps I can compute step by step, but maybe I can calculate it without computing the entire factorial because that's a big number.

Alternatively, I can compute 10! / (3! *4! *3!) and see if that gives one of the options.

So let's compute the denominator first. 3! is 6, 4! is 24, and another 3! is 6. So the denominator is 6 *24 *6. Let me compute that. 6*24 is 144, and 144*6 is 864. So denominator is 864.

Now the numerator is 10! which is 3628800. So 3628800 divided by 864 is what? Let's compute that.

3628800 ÷ 864. Let's see, 3628800 ÷ 864. Let me break this down:

864 * 4200 = 3628800 because 864 * 4000 = 3,456,000 and 864 * 200 = 172,800. Adding them gives 3,456,000 + 172,800 = 3,628,800. Which matches the numerator. So 3,628,800 ÷ 864 = 4200. 

Wait, but wait, that's the result of the division. So 10! / (3!4!3!)= 4200. But wait, looking at the options, I see option D is 1200, option H is 4200. Wait, but wait, the committees are 3,4,3. So the formula gives 4200. But the options have D as 1200. Did I miss something?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because when you have groups of the same size, you have to divide by the factorial of the number of groups to account for the indistinctness of the groups. But in this case, the groups are of different sizes (3,4,3). So all groups are distinct in size, so their order matters. Therefore, the formula holds.

Wait, but wait, another thought: when the problem says split into 3 different committees, are the committees considered ordered? Like, does committee A being 3 and committee B being 4 and committee C being 3 count as different from any other arrangement? Or is the ordering of the committees irrelevant? Hmm, I think the key is whether the order of the committees matters. 

In this problem, the committees are different, so the order in which we assign people to them matters. So the formula I used is correct. So the total number of ways is 4200. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 1200, and H is 4200. So the formula gives 4200, which is option H. But wait, the choices are A to J, with H being 4200. So why am I confused?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me think again. Let's re-derive the formula.

The formula for dividing n distinct objects into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km is (n!)/(k1!k2!...km! ). But in this case, the groups are of different sizes (3,4,3), so all groups are distinct, so the formula applies directly. So 10!/(3!4!3!)= 4200, which is option H.

But wait, wait, let me double-check. Let me compute 10 choose 3, then 7 choose 4, then 3 choose 3. Because another approach is to sequentially choose the people for each committee.

So for the first committee of 3, the number of ways is C(10,3) = 120. Then for the second committee of 4, it's C(7,4) = 35. Then the last 3 go to the last committee, which is C(3,3)=1. So the total ways would be 120 *35 *1=4200. Which matches our previous result. So that's 4200, option H.

Wait but the options don't have 4200 as option H. Let me check the options again. Hmm, the options are:

A:12600

B:5000

C:2500

D:1200

E:2100

F:3500

G:5600

H:4200

I:4500

J:3000

So option H is 4200. So the correct answer should be H:4200.

Wait, but the question is about 3 different committees. So why do I have to think that? Hmm, perhaps I was overcomplicating. The two methods both give 4200, so that's the answer. So among the options, H is 4200.
</think>

The problem involves dividing 10 people into three committees of sizes 3, 4, and 3. The correct approach is to use the formula for dividing n distinct objects into groups of specified sizes, which is n! divided by the product of the factorials of the group sizes. Applying this:

10! / (3! * 4! * 3!) = 3628800 / (6 * 24 * 6) = 3628800 / 864 = 4200.

This matches the sequential method of choosing groups step by step, resulting in 4200.
