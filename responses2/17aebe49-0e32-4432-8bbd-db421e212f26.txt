Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to stoichiometry. Let me try to figure this out. The question is about finding out how many grams of NH3 are needed to react with 80 grams of O2. The balanced equation is given: 4NH3 + 5O2 → 4NO + 6H2O.

Hmm, I remember that stoichiometry involves using mole ratios from the balanced equation. So first, I need to find out how many moles of O2 are in 80 grams, and then use the mole ratio to find the required moles of NH3, and finally convert that to grams.

Wait, let me break it down step by step. 

First, find moles of O2. The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol because each O atom is 16 g/mol. So 80g divided by 32g/mol is 2.5 moles of O2. That makes sense.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, the mole ratio between O2 and NH3 is 5 mol O2 to 4 mol NH3. So for every 5 moles of O2, 4 moles of NH3 are needed.

Wait, so if I have 2.5 moles of O2, how many moles of NH3 would that require? Let's set up a ratio. 5 mol O2 : 4 mol NH3. So 5 parts O2 to 4 parts NH3. So for 2.5 moles O2, it's (4/5) times that.

Wait, 2.5 * (4/5) is equal to 2. So that would mean 2 moles of NH3? Let me check: 5 O2 →4 NH3 → (5/4) in NH3 per O2. So 2.5 O2 × (4/5) = 2 NH3. Yes, that makes sense.

Now, I need to convert moles of NH3 to grams. The molar mass of NH3 is 14 (N) + 3×1 (H) = 17 g/mol. So 2 moles ×17 g/mol =34 grams of NH3.

Looking at the options, option G is 34g. So the answer should be G.

To determine how many grams of NH3 are required to react with 80 g of O2, we use the balanced chemical equation and molar masses.

1. **Calculate moles of O2**:  
   The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol.  
   Moles of O2 = 80 g / 32 g/mol = 2.5 mol.

2. **Use the mole ratio from the balanced equation**:  
   The balanced equation is 4NH3 + 5O2 → 4NO + 6H2O.  
   The mole ratio of NH3 to O2 is 4:5.  
   Moles of NH3 = (4/5) × 2.5 mol = 2 mol.

3. **Convert moles of NH3 to grams**:  
   The molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol.  
   Mass of NH3 = 2 mol × 17 g/mol = 34 g.

The correct answer is **34 g**, which corresponds to option **G**.
