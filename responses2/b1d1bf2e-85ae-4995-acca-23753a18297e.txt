Okay, so I have this question about ring homomorphisms and ideals. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

Statement 1 says, "A ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel is {0}." Hmm. I remember that in ring theory, there's a fundamental theorem related to ring homomorphisms. The kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal, right? And for the homomorphism to be injective (which is one-to-one), the kernel must be the zero ideal. Because if the kernel isn't just zero, say it's some other ideal, then the homomorphism isn't injective since different elements would map to the same element. So Statement 1 seems correct. 

Statement 2 says, "Q is an ideal in R." Wait, but the question is about whether Q is an ideal in R, but I don't have the context of what Q and R are. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. If Q is a subset of R, then for Q to be an ideal, it needs to satisfy two conditions: it must be a subgroup under addition, and for every element r in R and q in Q, both rq and qr must be in Q. But without knowing what Q and R are, I can't say for sure. Hmm, but in the question context, Statement 2 is probably about a general statement. Wait, no, maybe I read the question wrong. No, the question is about Statement 1 and whether Statement 2 is true or not. 

Wait, the question is asking about the truth of two statements, and then the options are combinations of their truth values. Oh, right, the options are about whether each statement is True or False, and the correct pair is to choose from A to G, which are combinations of True and False for the two statements.

So Statement 1 is True. I can't think of a ring homomorphism that's one-to-one without the kernel being zero. Because if two elements map to the same element, their difference would be zero, so the kernel would have that element. So Statement 1 is True.

Now Statement 2: "Q is an ideal in R." Wait, but without knowing what Q and R are, I can't say for sure. If I'm assuming that Q is a subset of R, then the statement is about whether Q is an ideal in R. But in general, if you're just given Q and R, you can't assume anything. So maybe Statement 2 is false because there's no information about Q and R. But perhaps in the context of the question, Statement 2 is a general statement that's being evaluated. Or perhaps it's a question about whether the statement is true. 

Wait a second, the question is asking about the truth of two statements, and the options are based on whether each is true or not. So Statement 2 is a statement about whether Q is an ideal in R. But without knowing the specific definitions or the context of Q and R, I can't evaluate whether this statement is true. So perhaps Statement 2 is considered False because it's making a general claim without specific information. 

Alternatively, maybe Statement 2 is being evaluated as a general question. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Since the question is part of a multiple-choice question where each option is a pair of truth values for two statements, I need to evaluate each statement.

Statement 1: True. Because a ring homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is the zero ideal.

Statement 2: The statement is about Q being an ideal in R. So without knowing what Q and R are, I can't say if this is true or not. So Statement 2 is False? Or perhaps it's given as a fact. Wait, maybe the question is using a standard definition. Or perhaps the question is to consider whether the statement is true. Wait, but the question is about whether the statement is true or false. So if the statement is a general fact, like "every ideal in R is...", but the question says "Q is an ideal in R", which is a specific statement. Without knowing what Q is, I can't evaluate this. So perhaps Statement 2 is False because it's making a general claim without sufficient information.

Wait, but in the context of the question, perhaps the second statement is a fact. Maybe the question is a standard one. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: Statement 2 is asserting that Q is an ideal in R. But without knowing what Q is, this is a false statement because Q is not defined. So the statement is false. Wait, but if the statement is "Q is an ideal in R", and Q is not defined, then the statement is false because it's making a claim that can't be verified. So perhaps Statement 2 is False.

But wait, the options are given as pairs. Let me go back to the possible options. The options are about the truth values of Statement 1 and Statement 2 being evaluated as True or False. So Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False because it's making a general claim without specific information.

Wait, but that can't be because the options given are pairs. Let me reevaluate. 

If Statement 2 is making a general claim, then without knowing Q and R, we can't say it's true. But if the statement is "Q is an ideal in R" without any qualifiers, then it's a general statement that is false because ideals are specific structures, and without defining Q, we can't confirm it.

Alternatively, if the statement was "Every ideal in R is...", but no, the statement is just "Q is an ideal in R". So I think Statement 2 is False because it's making a general claim without specific definitions.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Statement 1 is definitely true. Statement 2, the question is about whether the statement is true or false. So if the statement is a general fact, like "every ideal in R is...", but the question says "Q is an ideal in R", which is a specific case. Without knowing what Q is, we can't evaluate this statement's truth.

But I think that the question is about the general statement. So, perhaps Statement 2 is False because it's making a general claim without specific info. But if the question is evaluating the truth of a general statement, then Statement 2 is False.

But wait, in some contexts, if the statement is just Q being an ideal in R, and the question is whether that's true, then the statement is true only if Q is indeed an ideal in R. But since the question didn't provide information about Q and R, we can't evaluate Statement 2's truth. It's a general statement, so it's False, or True? Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The options for the answer are pairs of (True, False), etc. So the correct answer is a pair of two statements' truth values, and I have to pick the correct pair.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So the pair is (True, False). Looking at the options, option F is "Not Given, False", but wait, I thought Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A: True, False

B: Not Given, Not Given

C: False, False

D: Not Given, True

E: True, Not Given

F: Not Given, False

G: True, True

H: False, True

I: False, Not Given

J: Not Given, Not Given

Wait, so if Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False, then the correct pair is option F: "Not Given, False" No, wait, no! Wait, the options are pairs like A (True, False), etc. So the correct answer is F: "False, False"? No, no. Wait, looking at the options:

A: True, False

B: Not Given, Not Given

C: False, False

D: Not Given, True

E: True, Not Given

F: Not Given, False

G: True, True

H: False, True

I: False, Not Given

J: Not Given, Not Given.

Wait, I thought that Statement 2 is False. So the correct pair is (True, False), which is option A. Because option A is True for Statement 1, False for Statement 2.

Wait no! Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the question is about the two statements: 1 and 2. So the correct answer should be a pair. So if Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False, the correct answer is option A: True, False.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Because Statement 2's truth depends on Q and R. If Q is not given, or if the statement is making a general claim, then Statement 2 isn't a fact, so it's False. So (True, False) is option A. But I'm a bit confused because I thought Statement 2's truth is uncertain. Wait, but the question is about whether the statements are True or False. So Statement 2 is a general statement, so it's False. So the correct answer is option A: True, False.

But wait, the options are about the two statements. So each option is a pair of their truth values. So for the first statement, A says it's True, and the second is False. So the correct answer would be option A.
</think>

The correct evaluation is that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the pair is (True, False), which corresponds to option A.
