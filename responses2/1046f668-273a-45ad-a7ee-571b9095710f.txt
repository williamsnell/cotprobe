Question:

A medical research team tests for tumor reduction in a sample of patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug. Which of the following is true?

Options:

A: There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.
B: There are three explanatory variables and one response variable.
C: There is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.
D: There is one explanatory variable and three corresponding response variables.
E: There are three separate explanatory variables, each with a single level of response.
F: There are three response variables and one explanatory variable.
G: Tumor reduction is the only response variable, but there are three explanatory variables corresponding to the different dosages.
H: Tumor reduction is the only explanatory variable, but there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages.
I: There are three response variables, each corresponding to a different level of a single explanatory variable.
J: There is one response variable with three levels of explanation.

Okay, so I have this question about a medical research study where they're testing three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug to see if it reduces tumors. I need to figure out which statement about the variables is correct from the given options. Let me think through this step by step.

Hmm, the question is about the types of variables involved in the study. So, what's the setup here? They're testing three dosages, so that's probably three different levels of a single explanatory variable. Each dosage would be a separate level of that variable. So, in this case, the explanatory variable is the dosage, and it has three levels (the three dosages).

The main thing in experiments is usually one explanatory variable and one response variable. Because in many cases, you have one factor you're changing (the explanatory) and then you measure the effect on another variable (the response). So, if they're testing each dosage (the three levels of the same variable) on tumor reduction, that would be a single explanatory variable with three levels.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Three levels of a single explanatory variable. That sounds right because each dosage is a level, and there are three of them. So A seems correct.

Option B: Three explanatory variables and one response. No, because the question says they're testing three dosages, which would be one variable, not three. So B is incorrect.

Option C: One explanatory, three response. No, because response variables are the outcomes (tumor reduction), not the dosages.

Option D: One explanatory, three response variables. Again, same as C, no.

Option E: Three separate explanatory variables, each with one level. No, because the dosages are the main variable they're changing, not separate variables.

Option F: Three response variables, one explanatory. No, that's the opposite. The dosages are the main variable.

Option G: Tumor reduction is the only response, but three explanatory variables. No, because only one variable is being tested (the dosage). So here, it's the response (tumor reduction) that's the only thing measured.

Option H: Response is only explanatory, which is the opposite. So H is wrong.

Option I: Three response variables, each for a single explanatory variable. That's not correct because it's only one explanatory variable here. So I can rule that out.

Option J: One response, three explanations. No, since the response is the tumor reduction, and it's measured for each dosage.

So the correct answer must be A: There are three levels of a single explanatory variable. Because the dosages are the three levels, and the drug is the explanatory variable.

The correct answer is A: There are three levels of a single explanatory variable. This is because the dosages represent three distinct levels of the explanatory variable (the drug), while tumor reduction is the response variable measured for each dosage. 

Answer: A
