Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen lines from a quasar being redshifted. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the wavelengths are three times as long as they were in hydrogen atoms at rest on Earth. Oh wait, wavelength being longer would mean they're redshifted. Right, because redshift makes light appear longer in wavelength.

I remember that the Doppler effect affects the wavelength of light. The formula for redshift z is z = Δλ/λ₀, where Δλ is the change in wavelength and λ₀ is the rest wavelength. So if the wavelength triples, then Δλ is 2λ₀ (because λ = 3λ₀, so λ - λ₀ = 2λ₀). So z would be 2λ₀ / λ₀ = 2. So z is 2.

Now, the Doppler shift formula relates the redshift to the relative velocity. The formula I remember is z ≈ v/c for small speeds, but wait, that's an approximation. Oh right, when v is a significant fraction of c, the exact formula is z = v / (c (1 + v/c)). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The exact formula for redshift when the source is moving away (recession) is z = (v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ v/c for small v. But when v is a significant fraction of c, the approximation isn't exact.

Wait, another approach: if the object is moving away from us with velocity v, then the observed wavelength is λ = λ₀ (1 + z). So z is the ratio of the observed wavelength to the rest wavelength minus one. So if the wavelength is three times longer, z is 2. So λ = 3λ₀, so z = 2.

So z = 2 = v/(c (1 + v/c)) )? Or wait, I think the correct formula is z = v/c * (1/(1 + v/c)). So let me think again. The exact formula is z = v/(c) * (1/(1 + v/c )) ) ? Or another way, z = (v/c) / (1 + v/c ). Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the general Doppler shift formula for recession is z = v/c for non-relativistic velocities (v << c), and for relativistic, it's z = (v/c) / (1 + v/c), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, the exact formula is z = ( λ_observed - λ_rest ) / λ_rest = v / (c(1 + v/c)) ), but I might be getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, another way to write the Doppler shift is that for small velocities, z ≈ v/c. But when v is a significant fraction of c, we need the exact formula. Oh wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the approximation that for high z, v is a significant fraction of c.

Wait, the question says the shift is entirely due to relative motion. So we can use the relativistic Doppler formula. So the formula is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

where β is v/c. Wait, no, wait. The formula depends on the direction of motion. Since the quasar is moving away, the formula for wavelength observed is longer when the source is moving away. So for a recession velocity v, the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * ( (1 + β) / sqrt(1 - β²) ) ). Hmm, maybe I should write it again.

Wait, another version is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The redshift formula I learned is z = (λ_obs - λ_emit) / λ_emit. So for a source moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so z is positive.

The exact Doppler shift formula for recession (β = v/c) is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = (1 + β) / sqrt(1 - β²)

Alternatively, another way to write this is:

z = [ (λ_obs - λ_emit) ] / λ_emit = [ ( (1 + β) λ_emit ) / sqrt(1 - β²) ) ] / λ_emit 

Wait, that would be (1 + β)/sqrt(1 - β²) - 1.

Wait, let's compute that.

Wait, sqrt(1 - β²) is the denominator because 1-β² is (1 - β)(1 + β), so sqrt(1 - β²) is sqrt( (1-β)(1+β) ), which is equal to sqrt(1-β) * sqrt(1+β).

So, (1 + β)/sqrt(1 - β²) = (1+β) / [ sqrt(1 - β) * sqrt(1 + β) ) ] = sqrt( (1 + β) ) / sqrt(1 - β) ) = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that's a different expression. So we can write it as sqrt( (1+β)/(1-beta) ) = (1+β)/sqrt(1 - beta²).

Alternatively, I think the standard formula for redshift is given by the equation:

1 + z = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So let's plug in z=2, so 1+z =3.

So 3 = sqrt( (1+β)/(1-β) )

Square both sides: 9 = (1 + β)/(1 - beta)

Multiply both sides by (1 - beta): 9(1 - beta) = 1 + beta

Expand: 9 - 9 beta = 1 + beta

Bring all terms to one side: 9 -1 = 9 beta + beta → 8 = 10 beta → beta = 8/10 = 0.8.

So beta is 0.8, so v = 0.8 c.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.8c, so the answer should be C.

The question involves determining the relative speed of a quasar (3C9) based on the observed redshift of its hydrogen lines. The observed wavelengths are three times as long as the rest wavelengths, indicating a redshift \( z = 2 \). The relativistic Doppler shift formula for redshift is used to relate the observed wavelength to the source's recession velocity \( v \) and the speed of light \( c \).

The formula for redshift is:

\[
1 + z = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

where \( \beta = v/c \). Substituting \( z = 2 \), we have:

\[
1 + 2 = 3 = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
9 = \frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
9(1 - \beta) = 1 + \beta
\]

Expanding and rearranging terms:

\[
9 - 9\beta = 1 + \beta \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 = 10\beta \quad \Rightarrow \quad \beta = 0.8
\]

Thus, the relative speed of the quasar is \( v = 0.8c \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C: 0.8c**
