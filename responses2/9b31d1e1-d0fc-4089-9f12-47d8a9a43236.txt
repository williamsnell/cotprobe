Question:

The earthworm has a central nerve cord running along the entire length of the body. When an earthworm is cut into several parts, severing its nerve cord in the process, each part will go on crawling around for some time. How can each fragment carry out crawling movement even after the nerve cord is severed?

Options:

A: The earthworm can regenerate its nerve cord quickly.
B: The earthworm has a backup nerve cord that takes over when the main one is severed.
C: The earthworm uses chemical signals to communicate and coordinate movement between segments.
D: The earthworm's body movements are controlled by a fluid-filled hydraulic system independent of the nerve cord.
E: The earthworm has a centralized brain controlling all movements.
F: The earthworm's movements are not controlled by its nervous system.
G: The earthworm has more than one neural center controlling and coordinating its activities.
H: The earthwormâ€™s skin is sensitive to touch, allowing for movement without a nerve cord.

Okay, so I have this question about earthworms and their nervous system. Let's try to break it down.

The question is, when an earthworm is cut into parts, its nerve cord is severed, and each part is supposed to crawl around for some time. How does each fragment carry out crawling movement after the nerve cord is severed?

The options are A to H. I need to figure out the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that earthworms have a central nervous system (CNS), which includes the central nerve cord (CNC) and other nerves. Their CNS is highly organized and efficient. But when the CNC is severed, what happens?

Wait, so the main nerve cord is along the body. But each part (fragment) must have its own way to carry out movement. So how are they moving after the main nerve cord is gone?

Option A says the earthworm can regenerate its nerve cord quickly. If it can regenerate, then each fragment might still have a new CNC. But I think Earthworms aren't very regenerative. I don't remember them surviving when their main nerve is gone. Maybe they can regrow some parts but not the entire CNC? So this might not be the right answer.

Option B: They have a backup nerve cord that takes over. I'm not sure. I thought the main CNC is the most crucial. If it's severed, maybe each fragment can't rely on it, so they might need another way. But is there a backup? Not sure. But I'm not certain about this one either.

Option C: Uses chemical signals to coordinate. So maybe the fragments can communicate via chemicals. I know that many animals communicate through chemicals. But does each part need to have a separate nervous system for that? Or do they rely on the same system but some parts of the system function independently? I'm not too sure about this. I think the CNS is organized, so perhaps each part can utilize any available signals, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Body movements controlled by a fluid-filled hydraulic system. That sounds technical. I don't recall Earthworms having such a system. They don't use fluids in the same way as other animals. So probably not D.

Option E: A centralized brain controlling all movements. The CNS is the brain, but if the main nerve is severed, the brain might not control the remaining parts as effectively. Unless each part has its own brain, but I don't think so. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Movements aren't controlled by nervous system. Earthworms use nervous systems for movement. So F is wrong.

Option G: More than one neural center controlling. Yes, the CNS is complex. So other neural centers exist, which allows for coordination. So each part can use these centers to move. That makes sense.

Option H: Skin is sensitive. I don't think so. Earthworms have a skin, but it's not for touch. They have a body nervous system for movement. So H is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be G. Because the earthworm's nervous system has multiple centers that allow coordination. When the main nerve is severed, each segment can still use the other neural centers to move.

The correct answer is **G: The earthworm has more than one neural center controlling and coordinating its activities.**

Earthworms have a complex nervous system (CNS) with multiple neural centers. When the central nerve cord is severed, each fragment of the worm can still use the remaining neural centers to control and coordinate movement. This allows the fragments to continue crawling independently, relying on the overall system's organization and function.
