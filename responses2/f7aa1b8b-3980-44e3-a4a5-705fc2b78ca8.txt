Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the functions of money. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that money is a fundamental concept in economics, but I need to make sure I get the functions right.

The question is asking for the functions of money. The options are A through J, each listing different functions. I think I should go through each function one by one and see which options match.

First, what do I know about money? Money serves several roles. I believe it acts as a medium of exchange. That means people use money to buy and sell goods and services. Like, you give money to buy a shirt, and receive it when you sell it. So that's one function.

Then, money is used for bartering. Barter is a system where you exchange goods without using money. So having money as a tool that facilitates bartering makes sense. So option B mentions "Medium of exchange, tool for bartering." That seems correct.

Another function I recall is standard of living. Money helps people to pay for things, which in turn increases their purchasing power. So money is a means of production and a unit of account. Wait, option A says "Means of production, unit of account, standard of living." I think that's correct because money can be used to produce goods (means of production) and can measure value (unit of account), and also it contributes to the standard of living.

Wait, but let me think about the other options. Option C talks about store of wealth, standard of living, and medium of bartering. Hmm, money isn't a store of wealth, right? Money holds value over time, like a bank holds a certain amount of cash. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D says "Measure of value, unit of exchange, tool for savings." I'm not sure about "unit of exchange." Is it money or something else? Also, savings as a function might not be the primary one. I think the primary functions are exchange, bartering, and standard of living, while unit of account is about value measurement.

Option E is "Commodity, measure of wealth, medium of trade." No, money isn't a commodity. It's used to exchange other things.

Option F says "Tool for bartering, standard of living, store of wealth." Wait, I thought store of wealth was a different function. So F might have a mistake there.

Option G mentions "Unit of account, store of wealth, standard of deferred payment." Again, store of wealth isn't correct. And standard of deferred payment is a bit unclear; maybe it's "standard of exchange" or something else.

Option H: "Medium of exchange, measure of value, store of value." "Store of value" doesn't sound right. Money holds value, not itself as a store. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: "Standard of deferred payment, measure of wealth, medium of trade." Hmm, standard of deferred payment isn't a standard function. Maybe it's "standard of exchange"? Not sure, but this doesn't seem right.

Option J: "Commodity, standard of deferred payment, medium of trade." Again, money isn't a commodity. So J is wrong.

So, looking back, the correct functions I identified are:

- Medium of exchange
- Tool for bartering
- Standard of living

That corresponds to option A. Let me cross-verify. The other options don't fit as well. For instance, option B includes "medium of exchange" and "measure of value," which I think is also correct but maybe not both. Option A lists three functions, which are the main ones.

Wait, another thought: the standard of living is a result of having money, right? So that's a function. Also, money allows you to buy more goods and services, so that's the means of production. So yes, A seems correct.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is A.

The correct functions of money are:

- **Medium of exchange**: Used to facilitate barter and trade.
- **Tool for bartering**: Facilitates exchange and transactions.
- **Standard of living**: Enhances purchasing power by providing means of production and facilitating transactions.

Thus, the correct option is **A: Means of production, unit of account, standard of living**.

Answer: A
