Okay, so I have this question about deficiency of vitamin A in children. Hmm, I remember that vitamins are essential for various bodily functions. Let me think. Vitamin A is important, right? It's called retinol, and I think it's involved in vision. But wait, does it cause any specific health issues in children?

I recall that deficiency of vitamin A can affect the eyes. If the eyes aren't developing properly, it might lead to problems like eye strain or other vision issues. But how does that tie into the options given?

Looking at the options, option A is poor muscle development. Wait, isn't vitamin A also related to muscle function? I'm not sure. Or is it more about vision? I think I've read that vitamin A deficiency can affect the eyes, but muscle development might be secondary, not directly caused by it.

Option B is increased risk of mortality. That sounds more serious. I know that some vitamins are linked to diseases, but I'm not certain about vitamin A. Maybe it's less direct.

Option C is goitre, which is a condition of high testosterone. Oh right, vitamin A deficiency doesn't cause goitre. That sounds like a possible distractor.

Option D is increased risk of obesity. Wait, I remember that both vitamin A and iron are important for metabolism. Maybe vitamin A deficiency doesn't directly cause obesity. It could be a secondary effect, but the question is about the deficiency itself.

Option E is increased risk of heart disease. I think vitamin A is part of the energy requirements for the body. If someone can't absorb enough A, they might have less energy, which could contribute to heart issues. That makes sense, so E might be a correct option.

Option F is poor cognitive development. I'm not sure about that. I know vitamin A does affect vision, but cognitive development is more about brain function, which might not be directly linked to vitamin A deficiency. Unless it's a secondary effect, but I don't think that's the primary issue.

Putting it together, the deficiency of vitamin A probably affects eye health, which could lead to issues that indirectly affect other areas. But the direct effect is on the eyes, and the question is about deficiency, not the consequence. So looking back, the options given, the correct answer should be about eye issues, but none of the options directly state that except maybe F, which is poor cognitive development, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up. Let me think again. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to vision problems like hyperopia (nearsightedness) and myopia (farsightedness). It also affects the eyes' ability to see clearly, which might not directly cause poor cognitive development but could lead to other issues that do. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to something else.

Another angle: the question asks about the deficiency itself. So is it about the deficiency's effect? For example, if someone can't absorb enough vitamin A, they might have less vision, which could affect other areas like the brain. But the direct consequence is vision, not cognitive development as in F.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall: deficiency of vitamin A can lead to vision issues, but the options given don't include that directly. The options are about the consequences. So the effect on the eyes (like eye strain) might not be one of the options. The options for consequences are A, B, D, E, F.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think of each option again.

A: Poor muscle development—maybe not directly linked to vitamin A.

B: Increased mortality—could be due to other factors.

C: Goitre—deficiency doesn't cause that.

D: Increased obesity—probably not the primary effect.

E: Increased heart disease risk—this sounds plausible because vitamin A is important for energy and metabolism.

F: Poor cognitive—maybe yes, but I'm not certain. I think it's more of a secondary effect.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Another thought: I think the deficiency of vitamin A is associated with other health issues, including vision problems, but the options don't mention that. So maybe the question is about the primary consequence. So if someone has deficiency, they might have poor vision, but that's not listed in the options.

Wait, the question is about the deficiency itself. So the correct answer should be about what happens when you can't absorb enough vitamin A. I think the options don't include that, so I might be missing something. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: increased risk of obesity. Because vitamin A is part of the nutrient requirements for the body. Without enough, energy levels drop, leading to weight gain. That makes sense.

Alternatively, F: poor cognitive development. Wait, isn't cognitive development more related to brain health, which might not directly depend on vitamin A? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another angle: I remember reading that deficiency of Vitamin A can cause vision issues like glare or darkness in the eyes. It can also affect the eyes' ability to see properly, which might lead to other health issues, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the primary consequence is poor eyesight, which isn't an option. The options are about health outcomes. So perhaps the best fit is that the deficiency causes poor vision, but the options don't have that. So maybe the question is referring to the effect on the brain or muscle.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the effects of deficiency. The deficiency leads to vision issues, which affects the eyes but not directly the brain or muscle. So perhaps the correct answer is F: poor cognitive development. Or maybe not. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another thought: I think there's a link between vitamin A deficiency and heart disease. Because high vitamin A levels can affect the body's metabolism. So E: increased risk of heart disease. That sounds plausible.

Another way: I think that deficiency of vitamin A is a known risk factor for certain diseases, including heart disease. So E would be a correct answer.

I'm between E and F. I think the primary consequence is vision, but the options don't include that. So between the options given, increased risk of heart disease (E) seems correct.

The question asks about the deficiency of vitamin A in children. Vitamin A (retinol) is essential for vision and has known effects on the eyes. However, the question focuses on the deficiency itself and its direct impact. 

Option E, increased risk of heart disease, is a plausible consequence because vitamin A is part of the body's energy requirements, and deficiency can lead to energy deficits, which might contribute to heart issues. This makes E a strong candidate for the correct answer. 

Option F, poor cognitive development, is less directly related to vitamin A deficiency. While there may be secondary effects, the question is about the deficiency itself. 

Thus, the best answer is E: Increased risk of heart disease.

Answer: E
