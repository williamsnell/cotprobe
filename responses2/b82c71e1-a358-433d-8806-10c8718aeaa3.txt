Okay, so I've got this freezing point depression problem here. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says: A solution made up of 150 grams of benzene and 25.1 grams of a solute has a freezing point of -1.92°C. The freezing point of pure benzene is 5.50°C and the molal freezing point constant is 5.10. We need to find the molar mass of the solute. The options are A to J, with various values.

Alright, I remember that the formula for freezing point depression is ΔT = Kf * m, where m is the molality of the solute. Oh wait, Kf is the molal freezing point constant, right? And I think ΔT is the freezing point depression, which is the difference between the pure solvent's freezing point and the solution's.

So let's outline the steps. First, I need to calculate the freezing point depression. That would be the solvent's freezing point minus the solution's. So 5.50 minus (-1.92) equals 7.42°C. Wait, no, wait. The formula says ΔT is the freezing point of the solvent minus the freezing point of the solution. So 5.50 minus (-1.92) is 7.42. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait, the formula is ΔT = T_solvent - T_solvent_solution. So if the solution is more dilute, its freezing point is lower, so T_solvent_solution is lower than T_solvent. So 5.50 - (solution's T) = ΔT. The solution's T is -1.92, so 5.50 - (-1.92) is 5.50 + 1.92 = 7.42°C. Correct.

So ΔT is 7.42°C. The molal freezing point constant (Kf) is given as 5.10. So using ΔT = Kf * m, we can solve for m. So m = ΔT / Kf. Plugging in, m = 7.42 / 5.10. Let me calculate that. 7.42 divided by 5.10. Hmm, 5.10 times 1.45 is 7.445, which is a bit higher. So maybe 1.45 gives 7.455, which is close to 7.42. Or maybe 1.4485. Let me do the division: 7.42 / 5.10. Let's see, 5.10 * 1.45 is 7.445. So 7.42 is about 0.025 less than 7.445. So 1.45 - (0.025/5.10) = 1.45 - 0.005 ≈ 1.445. So m ≈ 1.444 mol/kg. Wait, but molality is moles per kilogram of solvent. Let's see, solvent is benzene. So 150 grams is 0.15 kg.

Wait, right, because 150 grams is 0.15 kg. So m = 1.444 mol/kg = (moles of solute) / (0.15 kg). So moles = m * 0.15 kg. So moles = 1.444 * 0.15 = 0.2166 moles. So approximately 0.217 moles.

Now, the solute's molar mass can be found by mass divided by moles. The mass of the solute is 25.1 grams. So molar mass = mass / moles = 25.1 g / 0.217 mol. Let's compute that. 25.1 / 0.217. Hmm, 0.217 times 100 is 21.7. 25.1 is 21.7 + 3.4. So 100 + (3.4 / 0.217) ≈ 100 + 15.65 ≈ 115.65 g/mol.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 25.1 divided by 0.217. Let me do it step by step. 0.217 x 100 = 21.7. 25.1 minus 21.7 is 3.4. So 3.4 / 0.217 ≈ 15.65. So 100 +15.65= 115.65. Rounded to three significant figures, that's about 115.7 g/mol. Looking at the options, option I is 115 g/mol. So that's our answer.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check all the calculations to be sure.

Starting again: ΔT is 7.42. Kf is 5.10. m = 7.42 /5.10 = approx 1.4548 mol/kg. Benzene is 150g=0.15kg. Moles= 1.4548 * 0.15 = 0.2182 mol. Solute mass is 25.1g. Molar mass= 25.1 / 0.2182 ≈ 115.8 g/mol.

So the molar mass is approximately 116 g/mol. The closest option is I: 115 g/mol. So the answer should be I.

To determine the molar mass of the solute, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T = K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \( \Delta T \) is the freezing point depression,
- \( K_f \) is the molal freezing point constant,
- \( m \) is the molality of the solute.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta T \)
The freezing point of pure benzene is \( 5.50^\circ \text{C} \), and the freezing point of the solution is \( -1.92^\circ \text{C} \). Thus:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{pure solvent}} - T_{\text{solution}} = 5.50 - (-1.92) = 7.42^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate molality (\( m \))
The molal freezing point constant (\( K_f \)) is \( 5.10 \, \text{K·kg/mol} \). Using \( \Delta T = K_f \cdot m \):

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T}{K_f} = \frac{7.42}{5.10} \approx 1.4548 \, \text{mol/kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate moles of solute
Benzene has a mass of \( 150 \, \text{g} \), which is \( 0.15 \, \text{kg} \). Using the molality formula \( m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}} \):

\[
\text{moles of solute} = m \cdot \text{kg of solvent} = 1.4548 \cdot 0.15 \approx 0.2182 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate molar mass of the solute
The mass of the solute is \( 25.1 \, \text{g} \). Using \( \text{molar mass} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{moles}} \):

\[
\text{molar mass} = \frac{25.1}{0.2182} \approx 115.8 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated molar mass is approximately \( 115.8 \, \text{g/mol} \), which corresponds to option **I: 115 g/mol solute/mole solute**.
