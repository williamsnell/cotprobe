Okay, so I have this problem here about Lucy making gift baskets. She puts 3 apples in each basket, and I need to find out how to calculate the total number of baskets, which is 'b'. The question is asking which number sentence correctly shows how to find 'b' when she has 24 apples. The options are A to J, each with different equations.

Let me think through this step by step. So, Lucy is using 3 apples per basket. That means for each basket, she uses 3 apples. If she makes 'b' baskets, then the total number of apples she uses would be 3 multiplied by 'b', right? Because 3 apples times the number of baskets gives the total.

So the total apples used is 3 multiplied by b. But she has 24 apples. So the total apples used (which is 3b) should be equal to 24. So the equation would be 3 × b = 24. Let me check the options.

Looking at the choices:
A: 3 + b = 24 → That would be if she adds the number of baskets to 3, which doesn't make sense because you can't have more apples than you have. So A is probably not right.
B: b × 3 = 24 → Yes, that's exactly what I thought. Multiplying the number of baskets by 3 gives the total apples, which equals 24. So B looks correct.
C: 24 - 3 = b → That would be if she had some apples left after making the baskets. But the problem says she is making the baskets with all her apples, so this doesn't fit. So C is incorrect.
D: b ÷ 3 = 24 → That would mean the number of baskets divided by 3 equals 24. That would imply she has 24 baskets, which isn't the case here. So D is wrong.
E: 24 ÷ b = 3 → That would mean 24 apples divided by the number of baskets equals 3. Wait, if 24 divided by b is 3, then solving for b would give b=8. But that would mean each basket has 3 apples, which is correct, but the equation here is 24 divided by b equals 3. So the equation would be correct, but the way it's written might not match. Let me think again. The number of baskets would be 8, but I'm not sure if that's the way the equation is presented. Alternatively, some might set up the equation as 24 divided by 3 equals b, which is option G. So E is another possible option, but let's see the other options.
F: 24 + 3 = b → That would mean she has 27 apples, which isn't the case. The total she has is 24, so F can't be right.
G: 3 × 24 = b → That would mean b is 72, which is way more than 24. That doesn't fit.
H: b ÷ 24 = 3 → So if you divide the number of baskets by 24, you get 3. That would mean b=72, same as G. So H is also incorrect.
I: 3 - b = 24 → This would imply 3 minus the number of baskets is 24, which would mean b is negative, which doesn't make sense. So I's wrong.
J: 24 × 3 = b → That would mean b is 72, which is way more than 24. But if you have 24 apples, you can make 8 baskets, each with 3 apples (24/3=8). So J is incorrect.

Wait, wait. So earlier I thought B was correct. But looking back, what's the correct equation? The total apples (24) equals the number of baskets multiplied by apples per basket (3). So 3b =24, which is B. But option G is 3×24 =b, which is 72. That's not correct because that would mean 72 baskets, each with 3 apples, which is way more than she has. So the correct equation is B.

Alternatively, looking at option E: 24 ÷ b =3 → solving for b gives b=8. But that's the number of baskets she can make with 24 apples if each basket has 3. So the equation would be 3b=24, which is B. So E is another way to represent the same equation, but written differently. So both B and E are correct, but looking at the options, the question is which number sentence shows how to find 'b', so both B and E could be correct. Wait, but in the options, each is a separate choice, so which one is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is asking for the correct equation. So B is correct because it's 3 multiplied by b equals 24. E is 24 divided by b equals 3, which also gives b=8, but it's another way to write the equation. So both B and E are possible. But looking back, the options are presented as separate choices. So which one is the answer.

Wait, the question is asking which equation shows how to find 'b' given 24 apples. So B and E are both equations that result in b. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: b × 3 = 24 → correct.

Option E: 24 ÷ b =3 → also correct because 24 divided by 8 is 3, so b=8.

So both B and E are correct equations. But the question is asking which number sentence shows how to find 'b'. Both are correct, but the question is presented as a single correct answer. Oh wait, no, in the options, each is a separate choice, and the correct answer is which one is correct. So I need to choose the correct equation.

Wait, but looking at the original question, the options are labeled A to J. So perhaps I should check if any of the options are equivalent or if I made a mistake.

Wait, but the question is about the number sentence. Let's think about the possible equations.

Another approach: I'll think about what each equation represents.

A: 3 + b =24 → b=21. But that doesn't make sense because apples per basket is 3, so adding b to 3 is the total. So this would mean the total apples are 3 plus b, which is incorrect.

B: b ×3 =24 → correct.

C: 24-3 =b → 21=b. Again, incorrect.

D: b ÷3 =24 → b=72, which is too high.

E: 24 ÷ b=3 → b=8, which is correct, but how? Because 24 ÷8=3.

F: 24 +3= b →27, no.

G: 3 ×24 =b →72, no.

H: b ÷24=3 →b=72, same as G.

I: 3 -b=24 →b=-21, impossible.

J:24 ×3 =b →72, no.

So, looking at the options, B and E are correct. But wait, the problem is a multiple-choice question, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me recheck.

Wait, no. Both B and E are correct because they result in the correct value of b. But the question is asking for the 'number sentence' that shows how to find 'b'. So if both B and E are correct, but the options don't offer that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the options are separate. Let me read the options again.

Option E is 24 ÷ b =3. So that implies b=8, which is correct. So both B and E are correct. But the question is asking which one is the correct number sentence. So perhaps the intended answer is B, but E is also correct. But looking back at the question, the options are A through J, each separate. So the problem is which one of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option correctly models the situation. So, the equation should represent that the total apples are equal to the number of baskets multiplied by 3. So 3b=24, which is option B.

Wait, but option E is 24 ÷b=3. If I rearrange that, it's 24=3b, which is same as 3b=24, so it's the same equation. So both B and E are correct. But in the options, each is a separate choice, and the question is which number sentence shows the way to find 'b'. So both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.

Suppose the total apples are 24. Each basket has 3 apples. So the number of baskets is 24 divided by 3. So b=24/3=8. So the equation is 3b=24 (B) or 24/3= b (E). So both are correct. But in the options, both are present. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let's look at the options again. Are B and E both correct? Let me see:

Option B: b ×3=24 → correct.
Option E: 24 ÷b=3 → correct because 24 ÷8=3. So both equations are correct. But the question is which one is the correct number sentence. So perhaps both are correct, but the answer options might have more than one correct? But the way the question is phrased, each option is a separate choice, and we have to choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question is presented as a multiple-choice where each option represents a different equation. So, the correct equations are B and E. But the options are presented as separate, so which one is correct.

Wait, but in the initial problem, the options are:

A: 3 + b =24 → wrong
B: b ×3=24 → correct
C: 24-3=b → wrong
D: b ÷3=24 → b=72 → wrong
E:24 ÷b=3 → correct
F:24+3= b→ wrong
G:3×24= b→ wrong
H: b ÷24=3 →b=72 → wrong
I:3 -b=24 →b=-21 → wrong
J:24×3= b →b=72 → wrong.

So both B and E are correct. But the question is asking for which equation shows how to find 'b', so both B and E are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm a bit confused because both options B and E are correct. However, the way the question is phrased, it's a single correct answer. I'll have to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the equation that is presented is the one that represents the problem. So, for example, the problem is 24 apples, each basket has 3 apples. How many baskets can you make? So the equation is 3b=24, which is B. So that's the correct approach.

But I'm a bit stuck because both B and E might be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "the number sentence shows how to find the total number of gift baskets, b, Lucy can make with 24 apples." So the way to find 'b' is to divide the total apples by the number per basket. So 24 apples divided by 3 apples per basket equals the number of baskets. So 24 ÷3 = b → which would be 8 baskets. So the equation is 24 ÷b =3 → which implies that 24 divided by the number of baskets is 3. So solving for b, we get b=8.

Wait, but the problem is, if I rearrange 24 ÷b =3, I can get b=8. Alternatively, 3b=24 is also correct. So the equation 24 ÷b=3 is another way to write 3b=24. So both equations are correct, but the options are separate. So in the problem, both B and E are correct. But looking back, the options are presented as separate, so perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps in the options, both B and E are correct, but the intended answer is B because it's the direct multiplication.

But wait, the problem is about finding 'b', the number of baskets. So the equation should express that when you multiply the number of baskets by the apples per basket (3), you get the total apples (24). So 3b=24 is correct. Hence, option B is correct.

But wait, let me think about what each option represents differently. For example, if someone says "the total apples are 24, and each basket has 3 apples, then the number of baskets is 24 divided by 3," which would be 8. So, the equation would be 24 ÷b=3 → b=8.

Wait, but the problem is, if I have 24 apples, and I divide them into baskets of 3, the number of baskets is b. So 3b=24. So that's option B.

So I think the correct answer is option B: b ×3=24.

The correct equation is 3 multiplied by the number of baskets (b) equals the total apples (24). 

Answer: B: b × 3 = 24
