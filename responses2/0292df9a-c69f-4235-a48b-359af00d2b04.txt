Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answers to these two statements and then match them to the given options. Let's start with Statement 1.

Statement 1 says that if a function f has a local maximum on the interval [a, b], then its derivative f'(x) must exist and equal zero at that point. Hmm, I remember that derivatives at a local maximum are zero, but I think that's not entirely accurate. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because, for example, think about a function like f(x) = |x|, which has a minimum at x=0. But if the function has a local maximum, does the derivative have to be zero? Wait, the function might not be differentiable there. Like, for f(x) = -x^2, which has a local maximum at x=0, the derivative is zero there because f'(x) = -2x, which is zero at x=0. But what if the function has a sharp point or a cusp? For instance, consider f(x) = |x|, which has a local minimum. No, that's a minimum. Wait, another example: f(x) = |x - 1|, which has a minimum at x=1. Hmm, perhaps I should think of a function that doesn't have a derivative at the maximum. 

Wait, another example: the function f(x) = -|x|, which has a local maximum at x=0. The derivative of f(x) is -1 for x < 0 and 1 for x > 0, but at x=0, the derivative doesn't exist because the left and right derivatives are -1 and 1, respectively. So, in this case, the function has a local maximum, but the derivative at that point doesn't exist. So Statement 1 claims that the derivative must exist and equal zero, which isn't true. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2: There exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q. Wait, can a continuous function from the real numbers to the rationals be non-constant? Well, the rationals are a countable set, and between any two rationals, there are irrationals. But for a function to be continuous and map all real numbers to rationals, it would have to be constant because otherwise, the function would have to skip over some irrational numbers. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, for example, the function could be constant. But can there be a non-constant continuous function from R to Q? I think not. Because if a function is continuous and non-constant, it's either strictly increasing or decreasing, but that would mean it's not constant. But wait, can a continuous function from R to Q be non-constant? Let me think again. Suppose f: R → Q is continuous and non-constant. Then, for any two points a < b in R, since f is continuous, f(a) ≠ f(b). But wait, the rationals are dense. So, for example, between any two real numbers, there are rationals. So if f is continuous and maps to Q, then the image would have to be an interval in Q, but since Q is totally disconnected, the image would have to be a single point. Therefore, the only continuous functions from R to Q would be constant functions. So Statement 2 is false because there don't exist non-constant continuous functions from R to Q.

Wait, but wait, Q is dense in R, but the function can't map R into Q non-constantly because any continuous image of R under a non-constant function would be an interval (by the Intermediate Value Theorem), but intervals in Q are not connected. So yes, the only continuous functions from R to Q are constant functions. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I might be missing something. Let me think. If f is a continuous function from R to Q, then f must be constant. Because if f is not constant, then it's either increasing or decreasing, but then it would have to skip over some rationals, which isn't possible because between any two points in R, the function's image has to cover all intermediate rationals. So yes, the function must be constant. So Statement 2 is false.

So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false. Now, looking at the options, each option is a pair of True/False for the two statements. The options are A: Both False, B: Both True, etc.

Wait, the question is to select the correct option. So the answers to the two statements are both False. So looking at the options: option F is False, False. Option A is neither True nor False, but wait, no. The options are given as pairs where each option's first element is True or False for Statement 1, and the second for Statement 2. So the correct option should have both statements as False.

Looking at the options:

A: Neither True nor False, False → So Statement 1 is neither, which can't be right because it's a definite False. So no.

B: Neither True nor False, True → Both are false? No, because Statement 2 is false.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false. So the correct option is F: False, False.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is: False, False. So that's the correct pair.

The correct answer is F: False, False.
