Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the percentage difference between e^x and 1+x when x is 0.0050. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I remember that e^x can be expanded as a Taylor series around x=0. The expansion is 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ... So, e^x is approximately 1 + x plus some higher-order terms. Since x is 0.005, which is small, maybe I can approximate e^x by using the first two terms: 1 + x.

Wait, but the question asks for the percentage difference, not the approximation. So I need to find the actual difference between e^x and 1+x, divide by 1+x, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Oh wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The percentage difference between two numbers a and b is usually |(a - b)/b| * 100%. So in this case, a is e^x and b is 1+x. So the percentage difference would be |(e^x - (1+x))/(1+x)| * 100%.

Oh, but wait, maybe it's |(e^x - (1+x))/(e^x)| * 100%? No, I think the first formula is correct because 1+x is the value we're comparing e^x to. So, the percentage difference is the absolute difference between e^x and 1+x, divided by 1+x, multiplied by 100.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is relative error. So, let me compute e^x first.

Wait, x is 0.005. Let me compute e^0.005. Since it's small, I can use the series expansion: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6. Let's plug in x=0.005.

x = 0.005
x squared is 0.005^2 = 0.000025
x cubed is 0.005^3 = 0.000000125.

So, e^x ≈ 1 + 0.005 + (0.000025)/2 + (0.000000125)/6.

Calculating each term:

1 = 1
0.005 = 0.005
(0.000025)/2 = 0.0000125
(0.000000125)/6 ≈ 0.0000000208333.

Adding them together: 1 + 0.005 = 1.005. Then add 0.0000125 gives 1.0050125. Then add 0.0000000208333 which is about 1.0050125208333.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Alternatively, since the series is 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 +x^4/24 + ... So perhaps I should calculate up to x^4 to get a better approximation.

Wait, but maybe it's better to just compute e^x directly. Alternatively, I can compute it using a calculator. Let me think, e^0.005 is approximately 1.005012500925 (I remember this value from some tables, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I can use a calculator function. I'm assuming I can use a calculator for this.)

Wait, but perhaps I should compute e^x using a calculator. Let me think, e^0.005 is approximately 1.0050125.

So, e^x ≈ 1.0050125.

Now, 1 + x = 1 + 0.005 = 1.005.

So, the difference is e^x - (1+x) = 1.0050125 - 1.005 = 0.0000125.

Now, the percentage difference is (difference) / (1+x) * 100%. So, (0.0000125) / (1.005) * 100.

Wait, wait. Wait, the formula is |(e^x - (1+x))/(1+x)| * 100%. So the numerator is 0.0000125, denominator is 1.005.

So, 0.0000125 / 1.005 is approximately 0.00001242304.

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.001242304%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is D: 2.00e-3 %, which is 0.2%. But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me think again: e^x is 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x^4/4! + ... So for x=0.005, up to x^3, it's 1.0050125.

But wait, let me compute more accurately. Let me calculate e^0.005 using the formula:

e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x^4/4! + ...

x = 0.005

x² = 0.000025
x³ = 0.000000125
x^4= 6.25e-8
x^5= 3.125e-10

So:

1 = 1
+ x = 0.005 → 1.005
+ x²/2 = 0.000025/2 = 0.0000125 → total 1.0050125
+ x³/6 = 0.000000125 /6 ≈ 2.08333e-7 → total 1.0050125208333
+ x^4/24 = 6.25e-8 /24 ≈ 2.604e-9 → 1.0050125225...

So e^x is approximately 1.0050125225.

So, 1+x is 1.005.

The difference is 1.0050125225 - 1.005 = 0.0000125225.

So, 0.0000125225 / 1.005 → let me compute that.

Divide both by 1.005:

0.0000125225 / 1.005 = 0.0000124545.

Multiply by 100% gives 0.00124545% ≈ 0.00125%.

Looking at the options, the closest is D: 2.00e-3% which is 0.2%. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the percentage difference between two numbers a and b is |a - b| / (b) * 100%. So, a is e^x, b is (1+x). So, the difference is e^x - (1+x) = (approx) 0.0000125225, and divided by (1+x)=1.005, that's 0.0000125225 / 1.005 = approx 0.00001245.

Multiply by 100 gives 0.001245%, which is about 0.00125% or 1.25e-3%.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.25e-3%, which is 0.125%? Wait, 1.25e-3 is 0.00125. So this matches what I have.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about this again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the difference is taken. Let me calculate the actual difference: e^x is 1.0050125225, and 1+x is 1.005. The difference is 1.0050125225 - 1.005 = 0.0000125225.

So, then (difference)/(1+x) * 100% is (0.0000125225 /1.005) *100. Let me compute this precisely.

0.0000125225 /1.005 is equal to approximately 0.0000124545 (since 1.005 * 0.00001245 = 0.0000125225)

Multiply by 100: 0.00124545%, which is approximately 0.00125%.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: 1.25e-3% (which is 0.00125%). So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but wait, none of the options except E is 1.25e-3%. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because other approaches might have different results. Let me think if I got the formula right. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage difference between e^x and 1+x compared to something else. Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage difference between e^x and 1+x relative to e^x itself. That would be ( (e^x - (1+x)) / e^x ) *100%.

In that case, let me calculate that. For x=0.005, e^x is 1.0050125225. So, the difference is 0.0000125225.

Divided by e^x (1.0050125225) gives: 0.0000125225 / 1.0050125225 ≈ 0.0000124545.

Multiply by 100% gives 0.00124545%, which is approximately 0.00125%.

So again, this leads to option E.

Wait, but wait another point. Let me think about the general formula for percentage difference. Another way to think about it is, perhaps, the percentage difference is ( |e^x - (1+x)| ) / ( (1+x) ) *100%.

Which is exactly what I did. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is comparing e^x to (1+x), so the percentage difference is (e^x - (1+x)) / (1+x) *100% which is what I calculated.

So, the correct answer is E: 1.25e-3 %.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1.25e-3, which is 0.00125%. So that's correct.

Wait, but just to make sure I'm not making a calculation error. Let me recompute e^x for x=0.005.

Another approach is to compute e^x using the Taylor series up to x^4.

x=0.005.

e^x = sum_{k=0}^∞ x^k /k! 

So,

k=0: 1/0! =1 → sum=1
k=1: 0.005/1! =0.005 → sum=1.005
k=2: 0.005^2 /2! =0.000025 /2 =0.0000125 → sum=1.0050125
k=3: 0.005^3 /3! =0.000000125 /6 ≈ 2.08333e-7 → sum≈1.00501252083
k=4: 0.005^4 /4! = 0.000000000625 /24 ≈ 2.6041666667e-9 → sum≈1.0050125225e0.

So e^x is approximately 1.0050125225.

So, 1+x=1.005. The difference is 1.0050125225 -1.005=0.0000125225.

Divide by 1.005: 0.0000125225 /1.005 → 0.0000124545.

Multiply by 100% → 0.00124545% → approximately 0.00125% → E.

So the correct answer is E: 1.25e-3%.

To calculate the percentage difference between \( e^x \) and \( 1 + x \) for \( x = 0.0050 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Approximate \( e^x \):**  
   Using the Taylor series expansion around \( x = 0 \),  
   \[
   e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \dots
   \]  
   For \( x = 0.0050 \):  
   - \( x = 0.0050 \)  
   - \( x^2 = 0.000025 \)  
   - \( x^3 = 0.000000125 \)  
   - \( x^4 = 0.000000000625 \)  

   Substituting these into the series:  
   \[
   e^x \approx 1 + 0.0050 + \frac{0.000025}{2} + \frac{0.000000125}{6} + \frac{0.000000000625}{24} \approx 1.0050125225
   \]

2. **Calculate the difference:**  
   \[
   e^x - (1 + x) = 1.0050125225 - 1.005 = 0.0000125225
   \]

3. **Compute the percentage difference:**  
   The percentage difference is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{e^x - (1 + x)}{1 + x} \right) \times 100\%
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{0.0000125225}{1.005} \right) \times 100\% \approx 0.00124545\% \approx 1.25 \times 10^{-3}\%
   \]

4. **Match with the options:**  
   The closest option is **E: \( 1.25 \times 10^{-3}\% \)**.
