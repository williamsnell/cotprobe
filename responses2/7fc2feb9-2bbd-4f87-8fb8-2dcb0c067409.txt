Question:

Recent communication with the inhabitants of Neptune has revealed that they have a Celsius-type temperature scale, but based on the melting point $(0^{\circ} \mathrm{N})$ and boiling point $(100^{\circ} \mathrm{N})$ of their most common substance, hydrogen. Further communications have revealed that the Neptunians know about perfect gas behaviour and they find that, in the limit of zero pressure, the value of $p V$ is $28 \mathrm{dm}^3$ atm at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$ and $40 \mathrm{dm}^3$ atm at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$. What is the value of the absolute zero of temperature on their temperature scale?

Options:

A: -273$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
B: -150$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
C: -170$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
D: -250$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
E: -210$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
F: -220$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
G: -180$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
H: -200$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
I: -300$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
J:  -233$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the absolute zero temperature for the Neptunians on their Celsius-type scale. Hmm, let me think. I remember that absolute zero is the point where all thermal motion stops, and it's the lowest possible temperature. On the Celsius scale, it's 0°C, but here it's based on hydrogen's melting and boiling points. 

The problem says that at 0°N (melting point), the pressure-volume product is 28 dm³·atm. And at 100°N (boiling point), it's 40 dm³·atm. Oh wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait, so pV is 28 at 0°N and 40 at 100°N? I'm a bit confused. Because in the ideal gas law, pV = nRT, but this is for a perfect gas, and it's at zero pressure. So maybe they've observed a linear relationship between pV and temperature?

Wait, that's right. Because for an ideal gas at constant pressure and number of moles, pV is proportional to temperature. So if pV increases with temperature, that suggests that their scale is Celsius-type, just with different zero points. 

So, let's model this: Let's say the pV is proportional to temperature in their scale, T_N. So pV = k * T_N, where k is a constant. 

At 0°N, pV is 28. So 28 = k * T_0, where T_0 is 0°N. And at 100°N, pV is 40. So 40 = k * 100. 

Wait, that can't be right, because if 28 = k * 0, then k would have to be undefined. Oh wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Because in the first case, T_0 is 0°N, which would make k be 28/(0°N) — which is problematic. That suggests I might have to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the pV is proportional to (T_N - T_ref), where T_ref is a reference temperature. Let's think about this. Suppose absolute zero is at T_ref, and when T_N is T_ref, pV is zero. So the relation would be pV = (some constant) * (T_N - T_ref). 

So, at 0°N: pV = 28 = (k) * (0 - T_ref)
At 100°N: pV =40 = (k) * (100 - T_ref)

So now, we have two equations:
28 = k (-T_ref)
40 = k (100 - T_ref)

We can solve for k and T_ref.

From the first equation: k = -28 / T_ref.

Substitute into the second equation:

40 = (-28/T_ref) * (100 - T_ref)

Multiply both sides by T_ref:

40 T_ref = -28 (100 - T_ref)

Expanding the right side:

40 T_ref = -2800 +28 T_ref

Bring all terms to left side:

40 T_ref -28 T_ref +2800=0 → 12 T_ref +2800=0 → 12 T_ref = -2800 → T_ref = -2800/12 → 

Let me compute that: 2800 ÷ 12 is approximately 233.333. So T_ref is -233.333 ... So that's, like, -233.33 degrees Neptunian Celsius, which is absolute zero.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

So, equation 1: 28 = k (-T_ref)
Equation 2:40 = k (100 - T_ref)

From equation 1, k = -28 / T_ref.

Substitute into equation 2: 40 = (-28 / T_ref) * (100 - T_ref)
Multiply both sides by T_ref: 40 T_ref = -28 (100 - T_ref)
40 T_ref = -2800 +28 T_ref
Bring terms to left: 40 T_ref -28 T_ref +2800 =0 → 12 T_ref +2800=0 → T_ref = -2800 / 12 → -233.333... which is -233.333... So that's about -233.333°N.

Wait, but looking at the options provided, option J is -233 N. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes in the setup. Another approach: The change in T_N is 100°N, and the corresponding change in pV is 40 -28 =12 dm³ atm. 

In the absolute scale, a change from 0 to 100 would correspond to a change from 0 K to 273.15 K (if it's a Celsius-type scale). But Neptunians don't have Kelvin, they have their own scale.

Wait, let me think in terms of linear scaling. If the pV increases by 12 when T increases by 100°N, then the slope (ΔpV/ΔT_N) would be 12/100 = 0.12 dm³ atm per degree N.

In the real absolute scale, the slope would be 1 (since ΔpV (理想情况下) would be R, but wait, in this problem, the pV is proportional to T_N, so the slope is R/Celsius part. But wait, in the problem, the slope is 0.12.

So, the absolute zero is when pV=0. So, when pV=0, T_N = (0 - 28) / 0.12. Wait, because from equation 1: 28 =k*(-T_ref) → k = -28 / T_ref.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's model it as T_N = T_ref + (ΔpV / R) * something. No, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

The pV for Neptunians is proportional to their temperature, which is a linear relation. So, the pV is given by pV = a * T_N + b. At 0°N, pV is 28: so 28 = a*0 + b → b =28. So pV = a T_N +28.

At 100°N, pV=40: 40 =a * 100 +28 → a= (40-28)/100 = 12/100=0.12. So pV=0.12 T_N +28.

At absolute zero, pV=0 → 0=0.12 T_N +28 → T_N = -28 /0.12 → T_N= -233.333... which is -233.333 °N. So this matches the earlier result. 

So the absolute zero is at -233.333°N, which is option J.

Wait, but the options are in whole numbers. So perhaps the calculation was supposed to round to the nearest whole number. So -233.333 is approximately -233. So option J is correct.

To determine the absolute zero temperature on the Neptunian Celsius-type scale, we analyze the relationship between pressure-volume product ($pV$) and temperature. The problem provides data points: at $0^\circ \mathrm{N}$, $pV = 28 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm}$, and at $100^\circ \mathrm{N}$, $pV = 40 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm}$. This suggests a linear relationship between $pV$ and temperature, as expected for a perfect gas at zero pressure.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Modeling the Relationship**:  
   Assume $pV$ is proportional to the Neptunian temperature scale, $T_N$. Thus, $pV = k \cdot T_N + b$, where $k$ is a constant and $b$ is the intercept.  
   - At $0^\circ \mathrm{N}$, $pV = 28$:  
     $28 = k \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 28$.  
     So, $pV = k \cdot T_N + 28$.  
   - At $100^\circ \mathrm{N}$, $pV = 40$:  
     $40 = k \cdot 100 + 28 \implies k = \frac{40 - 28}{100} = 0.12 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm} \, ^\circ \mathrm{N}^{-1}$.  

   Thus, the relationship becomes:  
   $$ pV = 0.12 \cdot T_N + 28. $$  

2. **Finding Absolute Zero**:  
   At absolute zero, $pV = 0$. Set $pV = 0$ in the equation:  
   $$ 0 = 0.12 \cdot T_N + 28 \implies T_N = -\frac{28}{0.12} \approx -233.33 \, ^\circ \mathrm{N}. $$  

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated absolute zero temperature is approximately $-233.33 \, ^\circ \mathrm{N}$. Among the provided options, the closest match is **-233 $^\circ \mathrm{N}$**.  

### Conclusion:
The absolute zero temperature on the Neptunian Celsius-type scale is **-233 $^\circ \mathrm{N}$**, which corresponds to option **J**.
