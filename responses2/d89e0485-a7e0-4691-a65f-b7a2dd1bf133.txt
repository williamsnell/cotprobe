Okay, so I have to figure out which option correctly represents the path of an impulse over a reflex arc. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a reflex arc involves a series of events when a stimulus triggers a response. The impulse, which is the electrical signal, starts at the sensory pathway. So, the first thing the impulse goes through is the sensory neurons. These are the neurons that detect the stimulus. For example, if someone touches a hot pan, the sensory neurons in the skin detect the heat and send an impulse to the brain.

Next, the impulse moves along the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system has two types: the sympathetic and parasympathetic. The sympathetic is the "fight or win" system and the parasympathetic is the "rest and digest" system. The autonomic nerve fibers are branchings that connect to the autonomic ganglia. These ganglia send signals to the central nervous system. I think the afferent neurons send signals to the central nervous system via the autonomic ganglia. For example, the sympathetic nervous system uses afferent neurons to send signals to the brain. 

Then there's the interneuron. Interneurons are those that are not traditional neurons but are part of the autonomic nervous system. They allow for a more efficient communication between the autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system. So the impulse moves from the afferent neuron to the interneuron.

The interneuron then sends the signal to the efferent neurons, which are the neurons that send signals to the effector. The effector is what the nervous system responds to, like a muscle contraction or a movement. 

Finally, the efferent neurons reach the receptors, which are the points of the body that receive the signal, like muscles or glands. The receptors then transmit the signal to the effector. 

So putting it all together: the impulse starts at the sensory neuron, goes to the autonomic afferent (which might be another type or the same as the initial signal?), then the afferent signals to the interneuron, which sends the signal to the efferent neurons, which then reach the receptors, and finally trigger the effector.

Wait, wait—no. Let me clarify. The initial impulse is from the sensory neurons. The afferent neurons (like afferent neurons) send the signal to the autonomic ganglia, which then connects to interneurons. So perhaps the order is: sensory neuron → afferent (or autonomic) → interneuron → efferent → receptor → effector.

Wait, another thought: the autonomic system's afferent (e.g., sympathetic or parasympathetic) sends the signal to the autonomic ganglia, which then connects to interneurons. So the order should be sensory → autonomic afferent → interneuron → efferent → receptor → effector.

Looking at the options, let's check.

Option D: sensory, afferent, interneuron, efferent, receptor, effector. Wait, but the options are a bit different in structure.

Wait the options are each a sequence. Let me see:

Option D: "sensory neuron, afferent, interneuron, efferent, receptor, effector." That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me think again about the order. How does the impulse flow:

1. Sensory neuron (sensory pathway) → afferent (autonomic) → arrives at autonomic ganglia (via afferent neurons), which then connects to interneurons. These interneurons then send signals to efferent neurons. Efferent neurons go to receptors, which send signals to the effector.

So the complete path is:

sensory → afferent → interneuron → efferent → receptor → effector.

But wait, the afferent might be the same as the autonomic afferent? Or is it a separate afferent? Also, the efferent comes after the interneuron.

So looking at the options, which one has this order.

Option D: "sensory, afferent, interneuron, efferent, receptor, effector."

Wait, but another option: I think sometimes the afferent is considered part of the autonomic pathway, so perhaps the afferent is in the first step.

Wait, the options:

Option D: the sequence is: sensory, afferent, interneuron, efferent, receptor, effector.

Option G: receptor, afferent, efferent, interneuron, effector.

Wait, no, that doesn't fit because the initial point is sensory, not receptor.

So, the correct order is:

- SENSORY → Afferent → Interneuron → Efferent → Receptor → Effector.

Looking at the options:

Option D: D: sensory, afferent, interneuron, efferent, receptor, effector. That seems to fit.

Alternatively, another option: Option E: efferent, interneuron, afferent, receptor, effector. No, that's the reverse. So the correct order must start at the sensory.

Wait, another option: Let me imagine each option.

Option A: interneuron, afferent, efferent, receptor, effector. No, starts with interneuron, which is incorrect.

Option B: effector, ... No, the impulse starts at the sensory.

Option C: sensory, interneuron, afferent, efferent, receptor. No, because after sensory comes interneuron, then afferent.

Option D: as above, seems correct.

Option G: starts with receptor, which can't be right.

Option H: starts with receptor, no.

So the correct answer must be D. Wait, but wait another thought: the initial point is the sensory. So which option matches that.

Looking again, the options are:

Option D: sensory, afferent, interneuron, efferent, receptor, effector.

Yes, that's the order.

Wait, but another angle. The afferent is the first part. So the correct answer is D.

The impulse over a reflex arc begins at the sensory neuron, which detects the stimulus and sends an electrical signal to the autonomic nervous system. This signal is transmitted along the autonomic afferent neurons, which connect to the autonomic ganglia. The autonomic ganglia then send the signal to the interneurons, which serve as intermediate neurons in the autonomic nervous system. These interneurons transmit the signal to the efferent neurons, which send the final signal to the effector (e.g., muscles or glands). Finally, the efferent neurons reach the receptors, which transmit the signal to the effector.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it starts with an interneuron, which is not the initial point of the impulse.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it starts with the effector, which is the response, not the initial stimulus.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it starts with an interneuron and an afferent neuron, which is not the correct sequence.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it follows the proper sequence: sensory neuron, afferent neuron, interneuron, efferent neuron, receptor, effector.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as it starts with the efferent neuron, which is the opposite of the initial point.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it starts with the effector.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it starts with the receptor.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as it starts with the receptor.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it starts with the afferent neuron, which is not the initial point.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as it starts with the efferent neuron, which is the opposite of the initial point.

The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately represents the path of an impulse over a reflex arc.
