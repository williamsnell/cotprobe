Okay, so I've got this problem here where a voltage of 25∠45° V is applied to an impedance of 4 - j2 Ω. I need to find the current and choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I think I should start by recalling how to calculate current when voltage and impedance are given.

Oh right, the formula is I = V / Z, where V is the voltage and Z is the impedance. Since both are complex numbers, I'll have to perform complex division. Let me write down the given values. The voltage is 25∠45°, which in rectangular form is 25*cos(45°) + j25*sin(45°). Cos and sin of 45° are both √2/2, so that makes the real part 25*(√2/2) = (25√2)/2 ≈ 17.678, and the imaginary part is the same, so about 17.678 j. Wait, but I should keep it in exact terms for now. So V is (25√2)/2 + j(25√2)/2.

The impedance Z is 4 - j2 Ω. So in rectangular form, that's 4 - j2. To divide these, I'll have to multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of Z to rationalize it.

The complex conjugate of Z is 4 + j2. So I'll multiply both numerator and denominator by that.

Let me compute the denominator first: Z * Z_conjugate = (4 - j2)(4 + j2) = 16 + j8 - j8 - (j^2)(2)(2) → 16 + (j8 - j8) + 4 → 20, because j8 -j8 is zero, so 16 +4=20. So the denominator becomes 20.

The numerator is V * Z_conjugate. Let me expand that.

V is (25√2/2) + j(25√2/2), so multiplying by (4 + j2):

= (25√2/2)*4 + (25√2/2)*j2 + j(25√2/2)*4 + j(25√2/2)*j2.

Let's compute each term step by step.

First term: (25√2/2)*4 = (25√2 *4)/2 = (100√2)/2 = 50√2.

Second term: (25√2/2)*j2 = (25√2 * j * 2)/2 = (50√2 j)/2 = 25√2 j.

Third term: j(25√2/2)*4 = j(25√2 *4)/2 = j(100√2)/2 = j50√2.

Fourth term: j(25√2/2)*j2 = j^2 (25√2 * 2)/2 = (-1)(50√2)/2 → (-50√2)/2 → -25√2.

Wait, because j^2 is -1. So putting it all together:

50√2 + 25√2 j + j50√2 -25√2.

Combine the real parts: 50√2 -25√2 = 25√2.

Combine the imaginary parts: 25√2 j +50√2 j = 75√2 j.

So the numerator after multiplication is 25√2 + j75√2.

Now, the current I is (25√2 + j75√2) divided by 20.

So I = (25√2/20) + j(75√2/20).

Simplify each term: 25/20 = 5/4; so 5√2/4 + j (75√2/20) → 75/20 simplifies to 15/4.

So I = (5√2/4) + j (15√2/4) → factoring out √2/4: (5 + j15)*√2/4.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations. Let me compute each part again.

Wait, the numerator after multiplying by conjugate is:

(25√2/2)*4 = 50√2 (correct)

+ (25√2/2)*j2 = 25√2 j (correct)

+ j(25√2/2)*4 = j50√2 (correct)

+ j(25√2/2)*j2 = j^2 (25√2 *1) → -25√2 (correct)

So real parts sum: 50√2 -25√2 =25√2.

Imaginary parts: 25√2 j + j50√2 = (25√2 +50√2) j =75√2 j.

So numerator is 25√2 + j75√2.

Denominator is 20.

So I = (25√2 + j75√2)/20.

Divide each term:

25√2 /20 = (5√2)/4 ≈ 5*1.4142/4 ≈ 7.071/4≈1.7678 A.

75√2 /20 = (15√2)/4 ≈ (15*1.4142)/4 ≈ 21.213/4≈5.3033 A.

So current in rectangular form is (5√2/4) + j(15√2/4) A. Which can be written as (5√2/4)(1 + j3) A.

Wait, 5√2/4 times (1 + j3) would give (5√2/4) + j(15√2/4), which matches.

Alternatively, I can factor √2/4: √2/4*(5 + j15) → √2/4*(5 +15j)= √2/4 *5 (1 +3j)= (5√2/4)(1 +3j). So in polar form, the magnitude is 5√2/4 times sqrt(1^2 +3^2) = sqrt(10). So the magnitude would be (5√2/4)*√10.

Wait, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623. 5√2 is about 7.071, divided by 4 is about 1.7678. Then 1.7678 *3.1623≈5.583. But wait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude and angle.

Wait, the current in rectangular form is (5√2/4) + j(15√2/4). Let me factor out √2/4: √2/4*(5 + 15j). So the real part is (5 +15j)*(√2/4).

The magnitude is |√2/4| * sqrt(5^2 +15^2) → sqrt(25 +225)=sqrt(250)=5*sqrt(10). So magnitude is (√2/4)*5*sqrt(10) → (5 sqrt(20) )/4. Wait, sqrt(20)=2 sqrt(5), so 5*2 sqrt(5)/4= (10 sqrt(5))/4= (5 sqrt(5))/2.

Wait, wait, let's compute the magnitude: |I|= sqrt( (5√2/4)^2 + (15√2/4)^2 )

= sqrt( (25 * 2 )/(16) + (225 * 2)/(16) )

= sqrt( (50 + 450) /16 )

= sqrt(500/16) → sqrt(31.25)=5.59017 A.

But wait, alternatively, I could have calculated the magnitude as |V| / |Z|.

Wait, V is 25∠45°, so |V|=25. Z is 4-j2. The magnitude of Z is sqrt(4^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(16 +4)=sqrt(20)= 2 sqrt(5)≈4.4721.

So current magnitude is 25 / (2 sqrt(5)) = (25)/(2√5). Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √5 → 25√5/(2*5)=5√5/2≈5.59017 A. Which matches the earlier calculation. So the magnitude is 5√5/2.

Now, the angle is determined by the phase difference. Since the current is V/Z, the angle is 45° - angle of Z. The impedance Z is 4-j2, so its angle is arctan(-2/4)= arctan(-0.5)= -26.565°. So the angle of current is 45° - (-26.565°)=45+26.565=71.565°, approximately 71.6°.

So current in polar form is (5√5/2)∠71.6° A. Let me compute 5√5/2: √5 is about 2.236, so 5*2.236=11.18/2=5.59 A.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B) 2.5√5∠71.6° → 2.5 *2.236≈5.59, so that matches the magnitude.

And the rectangular form part: 2.5√5 is about 5.59, but let's see the options. Option B says rectangular form 1.25√2 + 3.75√2 j. Wait, 1.25√2 is about 1.767, and 3.75√2 is about 5.303. So the rectangular form would be approximately 1.767 +5.303j, which doesn't match our current's 1.7678 +5.3033j. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, because the current's rectangular form is 5√2/4 + j15√2/4. Let's compute 5√2/4 ≈ (5 *1.414)/4 ≈7.07/4≈1.7675. 15√2/4≈ (15 *1.414)/4≈21.21/4≈5.3025. So the rectangular form is approximately 1.7675 +5.3025j. Looking at option B: 1.25√2 ≈1.767, and 3.75√2≈5.303. So 1.767 +5.303j. So that's very close. So current is 1.25√2 +3.75√2 j, which matches option B's rectangular part.

Wait, but wait, my calculation showed the current is (5√2/4) + j(15√2/4) → which is approximately 1.7675 +5.303j. Option B's rectangular form is 1.25√2 +3.75√2 j ≈1.767 +5.303j. So that looks correct. So the current in polar form is 5√5/2 A at 71.6°, which is option B.

But let me double-check all calculations.

Alternative approach: Use complex division formula.

I = V/Z.

V is 25∠45° → Real part:25 cos45=25*(√2/2)= 25√2/2.

Imaginary part:25 sin45=25√2/2.

Z is 4-j2 →4 + j(-2).

I = (25√2/2 + j25√2/2) / (4 - j2).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 +j2):

Numerator becomes (25√2/2 *4) + (25√2/2 *j2) + (j25√2/2 *4) + (j25√2/2 *j2).

Let's compute each term.

Term 1: 25√2/2 *4 = (25*4√2)/2 =50√2.

Term 2:25√2/2 *j2 = j25√2.

Term3: j25√2/2 *4= j50√2.

Term4: j25√2/2 *j2= j^2 (25√2 * 2)/2 → j^2 (50√2)/2 → (-50√2)/2 → -25√2.

Sum all terms:

50√2 -25√2 =25√2.

Imaginary terms: j25√2 +j50√2 →75√2 j.

So numerator is 25√2 + j75√2.

Denominator: (4)^2 + (2)^2 →16+4=20.

So I= (25√2 +j75√2)/20.

Break into real and imaginary parts:

Real: 25√2 /20 = (5√2)/4.

Imaginary: 75√2/20 = (15√2)/4.

So current is (5√2/4) + j(15√2/4) A.

Expressed in polar form, the magnitude is sqrt( (5√2/4)^2 + (15√2/4)^2 )

= sqrt( (25*2)/16 + (225*2)/16 )

= sqrt(50/16 + 450/16 )

= sqrt(500/16 )= sqrt(31.25) =5.59017 A.

Angle is arctan( (15√2/4) / (5√2/4) )= arctan(15/5)= arctan(3)=71.565°, which is about 71.6°.

So current is 5.59017 A at 71.6°, which is 5√5/2 A at 71.6°. Let me compute 5√5/2: √5≈2.236, so 5*2.236=11.18, divided by 2 is 5.59. So correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: rectangular form is 1.25√2 + j3.75√2 → which is approximately 1.767 +5.303j. But from our calculation, it's 1.767 j5.303. So 1.25√2 is about 1.767, and 3.75√2 is about 5.303. So that seems correct.

Polar form is 5√5/2 at 71.6°, which is option B's polar part.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the current in an AC circuit using the formula:

\[
I = \frac{V}{Z}
\]

where \( V = 25\angle45^\circ \, \text{V} \) and \( Z = 4 - j2 \, \Omega \). The steps are as follows:

1. **Convert Voltage to Rectangular Form**:  
   The voltage in rectangular form is:  
   \[
   V = 25\cos(45^\circ) + j25\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{25\sqrt{2}}{2} + j\frac{25\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

2. **Multiply by the Complex Conjugate of \( Z \)**:  
   The complex conjugate of \( Z = 4 - j2 \) is \( 4 + j2 \). Multiplying \( V \) by \( 4 + j2 \):  
   \[
   V \cdot (4 + j2) = \left( \frac{25\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot 4 \right) + \left( \frac{25\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot j2 \right) + \left( j\frac{25\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot 4 \right) + \left( j\frac{25\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot j2 \right)
   \]  
   Simplifying each term:  
   \[
   = 50\sqrt{2} + j25\sqrt{2} + j50\sqrt{2} - 25\sqrt{2}
   \]  
   Combining like terms:  
   \[
   = (50\sqrt{2} - 25\sqrt{2}) + j(25\sqrt{2} + 50\sqrt{2}) = 25\sqrt{2} + j75\sqrt{2}
   \]

3. **Divide by the Impedance \( Z \)**:  
   The denominator \( Z \cdot Z^* \) is:  
   \[
   (4 - j2)(4 + j2) = 16 + 4 = 20
   \]  
   Thus, the current \( I \) is:  
   \[
   I = \frac{25\sqrt{2} + j75\sqrt{2}}{20} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4} + j\frac{15\sqrt{2}}{4}
   \]

4. **Express in Polar Form**:  
   The magnitude of \( I \) is:  
   \[
   |I| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{15\sqrt{2}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{50}{16} + \frac{450}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{500}{16}} = \frac{5\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 5.59 \, \text{A}
   \]  
   The angle of \( I \) is:  
   \[
   \angle I = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\frac{15\sqrt{2}}{4}}{\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}}\right) = \tan^{-1}(3) \approx 71.6^\circ
   \]  
   Thus, the current in polar form is:  
   \[
   I = \frac{5\sqrt{5}}{2} \angle 71.6^\circ \, \text{A}
   \]

5. **Compare with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect, as the magnitude and rectangular form do not match.  
   - **Option B**: Correct, as the magnitude is \( 5\sqrt{5}/2 \approx 5.59 \, \text{A} \), and the rectangular form is \( 1.25\sqrt{2} + j3.75\sqrt{2} \approx 1.767 + j5.303 \, \text{A} \).  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect, as the magnitude and rectangular form do not match.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as the magnitude and rectangular form do not match.
