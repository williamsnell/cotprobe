Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Space Shuttle orbiting Earth. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the acceleration due to Earth's gravity experienced by the Space Shuttle. I remember that acceleration due to gravity isn't constant; it changes with altitude. Oh right, because as you go higher, the gravitational force decreases.

Wait, the Earth's radius is given as 6400 km. And the Space Shuttle is orbiting at 300 km above the surface. So the effective radius for the shuttle's orbit is Earth's radius plus 300 km. Let me calculate that. 6400 km + 0.3 km = 6430 km. Oh wait wait, no, because 300 km is 3e2 meters, right? Wait no, wait the units. The problem says Earth's radius is 6400 km. So the shuttle is 300 km above, which is 3e5 meters. Wait, no, wait 300 km is 3e5 meters? No, wait 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 300 km is 3e5 meters. So the shuttle's orbital radius is 6400 km + 300 km = 6700 km. Wait, no, wait 6400 km is 6.4e6 meters, plus 3e5 meters is 6.7e6 meters? Let me compute that properly. 6400 km is 6,400,000 meters. 300 km is 300,000 meters. Sum is 6,700,000 meters, which is 6.7e6 meters. So R is 6.7e6 meters.

Wait, but wait, when calculating acceleration due to gravity, I remember the formula g = GM/R². But wait, the question is about the acceleration at that height, which is less than the surface value. Alternatively, I can use the fact that at the surface, acceleration is g = 9.8 m/s². But wait, another approach: since the shuttle is in orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal acceleration. So the gravitational acceleration at that altitude is g' = GM/(R + h)^2.

But I can also relate this to the surface gravity. I think the formula for the orbital velocity is v = sqrt( G M / R ), but maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, using g' = g * (R/(R + h))². Oh wait, that's correct because when you're higher, the gravity decreases by the square of the ratio of radii. So if h is much smaller than R, you can approximate it, but here h is 300 km compared to R=6400 km, which is about 5% increase. So the denominator is (6400 +300)^2 = (6700)^2. Let's compute the ratio.

Wait, so g' is g times (R/(R+h)) squared. So (6400/6700)^2. Let me compute that. 6400 / 6700 is approximately 0.9552. Squared, that's about 0.9125. So g' = 9.8 * 0.9125 ≈ 9.8 * 0.9125. Let me calculate that. 9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82, 0.0125 * 9.8=0.1225. So total is about 8.9425 m/s². Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 8.9 m/s². So that might be the answer.

Wait, but wait another approach: I know that the acceleration due to gravity at a height h above Earth is g' = g * (R/(R+h))². So plugging the numbers, R is 6400 km, h is 300 km. So R/(R+h) = 6400 / 6700 = 0.9552. Square that, 0.9125. Multiply by 9.8: 9.8 *0.9125= approx 8.94 m/s². So the closest option is B:8.9 m/s².

Wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations. Let me compute 6400/6700 exactly. 6400 divided by 6700. Let's do this division: 6400 ÷ 6700. Well, 6700 is 67 times 100, 6400 is 64 times 100. So 64/67. Let me compute that. 64 ÷ 67. 67 goes into 64 zero times. 67 goes into 640 9 times (9*67=603). 640-603=37. Bring down 0: 370. 67*5=335, so 5. 370-335=35. Bring down zero: 350. 67*5=335, so 5. 350-335=15. Bring down zero: 150. 67*2=134, so 2. 150-134=16. Bring down zero: 160. 67*2=134, 2. Remainder 26. So 64/67 is approximately 0.98507 (Wait, wait, no, 64 ÷ 67 is 0.98507? Wait wait, let's think again. Wait, 64 ÷ 67 is less than 1. Wait, wait, this is 6400/(6400+300)=6400/6700=64/67≈0.9552. So yes, approximately 0.9552. So square is (0.9552)^2. Let me compute this: 0.9552 * 0.9552. 

Hmm, 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025. 0.95 * 0.0052 → not sure, perhaps better to compute it accurately. Let me compute (0.9552)^2:

= (0.95 + 0.0052)^2 = 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.0052 + (0.0052)^2.

0.95²=0.9025.

2 * 0.95 *0.0052= 2 * 0.95 * 0.0052 → 1.9 * 0.0052 = 0.00988.

(0.0052)^2= approx 0.00002704.

Adding them all: 0.9025 + 0.00988=0.91238 + 0.00002704≈0.912407. So about 0.9124. Multiply by 9.8: 9.8 * 0.9124.

Let me compute 9 * 0.9124 is 8.2116. 0.8 * 0.9124 is 0.73, so 8.2116+0.73=8.9416. So about 8.94 m/s². So the closest option is B, 8.9 m/s².

Wait, wait, but another thought: the shuttle's orbital period is known, but maybe I don't need that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the formula g' = GM/(R + h)^2, but another approach is to use the formula for gravitational acceleration at a height h: g' = g * (R/(R+h))^2.

Yes, that's correct. So using g=9.8, R=6400, h=300.

So the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 8.94, which is 8.9 m/s². So the answer is B.

To determine the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity experienced by the Space Shuttle, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration at a height \( h \) above Earth's surface:

\[
g' = g \cdot \left(\frac{R}{R + h}\right)^2
\]

Here:
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration at Earth's surface),
- \( R = 6400 \, \text{km} = 6,400,000 \, \text{m} \) (Earth's radius),
- \( h = 300 \, \text{km} = 300,000 \, \text{m} \) (altitude of the Space Shuttle).

The effective radius of the shuttle's orbit is:

\[
R + h = 6,400,000 \, \text{m} + 300,000 \, \text{m} = 6,700,000 \, \text{m}.
\]

The ratio of Earth's radius to the orbital radius is:

\[
\frac{R}{R + h} = \frac{6,400,000}{6,700,000} = \frac{6400}{6700} \approx 0.9552.
\]

Squaring this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{R}{R + h}\right)^2 = (0.9552)^2 \approx 0.9124.
\]

Now, calculate the gravitational acceleration at the shuttle's altitude:

\[
g' = 9.8 \cdot 0.9124 \approx 8.94 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

The closest option to this value is **8.9 m/s²**. Therefore, the correct answer is:
