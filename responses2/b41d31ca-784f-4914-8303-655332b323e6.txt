Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A state built a casino and issued bonds to finance its construction. On five occasions, there were episodes of violence in various casinos in the state. The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?

Options:

A: Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.
B: No, because the state does not have the authority to regulate commerce.
C: No, because this would infringe on the rights of out-of-state business owners.
D: Yes, but only if the casinos were given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the law was passed.
E: Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.
F: No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.
G: Yes, but only if the state can prove that the violence was directly caused by the casinos.
H: No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.
I: No, because the state cannot interfere with private businesses.
J: Yes, because the state has the power to regulate businesses within its borders.

Okay, so I have this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with state laws and their powers. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The question is about a state that built a casino and issued bonds to finance it. Then, in various places, there were episodes of violence in these casinos. The state police attribute the violence to greed and fear. Now, the state passes a statute prohibiting gambling at privately owned casinos. The question is whether this law is likely to be held constitutional, given that most casinos are owned by out-of-state businesses.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that states have different power regarding their ability to regulate businesses. I think this relates to the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, but maybe that's more about interstate commerce. Wait, but wait, the question is about state power over private businesses within its borders.

I remember something about the Due Process Clause, which deals with the right of a state to maintain its citizens' property in a safe environment. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here. Or perhaps it's about the commerce clause? Oh wait, the commerce clause allows states to regulate commerce within their own jurisdiction. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says most casinos are owned by out-of-state businesses. So the state has a problem because its own casinos are targeted by violence. The law is passed to prevent this. But is that a problem for the state's power?

Let me think about state vs. federal powers. The state has the power to regulate commerce within its own borders, including the establishment of laws that restrict gambling. But in this case, the problem isn't that the state is regulating interstate commerce, but that it's taking action to prevent private businesses from operating within its state. 

I think the key here is whether the state's actions are within its power to regulate its own businesses. The state has authority to regulate its own private enterprises within its borders, so the statute should be constitutional. But wait, maybe there's a nuance here.

Wait, the state built its own casino and issued bonds. So perhaps the issue is whether the state is imposing restrictions on private gambling in its own area, which is a valid exercise of power. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, option J says yes, because the state has the power to regulate businesses within its borders. That sounds correct because states can regulate their own private enterprises. So the law would likely be held unconstitutional? Or is it constitutional?

Wait, alternative approach: The question is about whether the law is likely to be held unconstitutional. So let's consider whether state power over its own private businesses is limited.

I think the state does have the power to regulate within its borders, including regulating gambling. So the statute should be constitutional. But wait, the issue is whether the state's actions are justified. If the state isn't given notice or an opportunity to respond, maybe it's unconstitutional because they can't effectively regulate. But the question says most are owned by out-of-state, so maybe the state has the authority because it's within its jurisdiction to regulate its own businesses.

Wait, but wait. The possibility comes in whether the state's actions infringe on the rights of out-of-state business owners. If the law targets out-of-state businesses, that's a problem for the state. The state's own businesses are being restricted, but the issue is whether it's unconstitutional because it's interfering with out-of-state businesses.

So, the state's law is targeting private businesses, which are in the state's own area. So the state's power to regulate is about its own private enterprises, so the law should be constitutional. So why is option H an issue? Option H says no because out-of-state businesses are part of interstate commerce. But the state can regulate its own businesses, so this is irrelevant.

Wait, another thought: The law is preventing private businesses from operating in the state, including out-of-state. So if the state can't regulate out-of-state businesses, then it's unconstitutional. But in this case, the state is trying to regulate its own private businesses. So the statute is about restricting the operation of its own casinos, which are private businesses owned by in-state businesses. 

Ah, but the law in question is about preventing the violation of safety and order in private gambling establishments. So the question is whether the state can regulate its own private businesses, which it's doing. 

Wait, but the question is about the law being held constitutional. So if the state can regulate its own private enterprises, then the law should be constitutional. So which option is that? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature. But that's about the law's authorization, not its constitutional validity. So that doesn't directly answer the constitutional issue.

Option J: Yes, because state has power to regulate businesses within its borders. This seems correct.

Option E: Yes, if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce. Hmm, not sure about this.

Wait, another angle: The commerce clause allows states to regulate commerce within their own jurisdiction, including the establishment of laws that restrict the establishment or operation of private businesses. So the state's regulation of its own private enterprises is within the scope of its power. Therefore, the law should be constitutional.

So the likely correct answer is J. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option J says "Yes, because the state has the power to regulate businesses within its borders." Yes, that's correct because states have the power to regulate their own businesses. So the law is likely to be held constitutional if the state can prove that the violence was directly caused by the casinos. But wait, no, the wording of the question is about whether the law is likely to be held unconstitutional. So the law's constitutionality depends on whether the state can regulate its own private businesses.

Wait, but the state's own private businesses are in its jurisdiction. So the law is a regulation within the state's power. So the law should be constitutional. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait another point: The law is targeting private businesses, which are owned by out-of-state. So if the state can't regulate out-of-state businesses, but can regulate its own, then the law is not necessarily unconstitutional because it's not targeting out-of-state. So the state's power is only over its own private businesses. Therefore, the law is likely to be upheld because the state has the power to regulate its own private enterprises. So the answer is J.
</think>

The question revolves around whether a state statute restricting gambling at privately owned casinos, targeting out-of-state businesses, is constitutional. The state has the power to regulate its own private enterprises within its jurisdiction, as per constitutional law. This power is confined to its borders, making the statute's constitutionality likely. The law does not target out-of-state businesses, as the state can regulate its own. Therefore, the statute is constitutional, and the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
