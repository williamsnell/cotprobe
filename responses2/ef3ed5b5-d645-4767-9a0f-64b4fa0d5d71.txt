Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about crisis intervention services and ethical considerations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A mother's 14-year-old daughter witnessed an assault three days ago. The daughter is distraught because she can't sleep, doesn't eat, and keeps crying. There's no one else in the community to help her, and I'm an ethical psychologist with limited experience.

The question is about what I should do as an ethical psychologist. The options are A through H. I need to choose the correct one.

I think about what ethical psychology entails. It's about making decisions that are right, even when there's uncertainty. So, if I can't provide the specific intervention because I don't have the experience, I might have to take a safer route.

Option A says to see her daughter in therapy until the crisis ends or find alternative services. That makes sense because I don't have the experience, so I can't offer real-time crisis intervention. Maybe I can help guide her towards therapy, but I can't do it for her right now.

Option B suggests training her. But I don't have the experience, so I can't train her. Also, training might not be appropriate without my involvement.

Option C suggests waiting for her to feel better. While waiting is a possibility, it's risky. If she's still distraught, I might not know when she's ready, and offering therapy might not be the best approach.

Option D says to see her without informing me. That's risky because I can't be there, and I might not know she's in distress. It could lead to an unnecessary intervention.

Option E suggests informing her. But that's even more risky because I can't be there, and she's in distress. It might not be helpful or safe.

Option F suggests she forgets the incident. That's a coping mechanism, but it's not a safe intervention. It's more of a temporary solution and doesn't address the underlying trauma.

Option G recommends group therapy. Group therapy can be helpful but again, I can't provide it. Plus, group therapy might not be the right approach without my experience.

Option H says to see her because I've had experience. But I have limited experience, so offering real-time intervention isn't feasible. Maybe I can provide guidance, but not actual intervention.

So, thinking about ethical implications, I should avoid providing any real-time crisis intervention because I lack the experience. The best course of action is to offer her a chance to seek help without being there. That's what option A does—providing her with the chance to go through therapy. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.

The correct answer is A, as it adheres to ethical guidelines by offering the daughter a chance to seek therapy without providing real-time crisis intervention, which I am not experienced to do.

Answer: A
