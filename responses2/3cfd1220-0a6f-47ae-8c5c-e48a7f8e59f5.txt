Okay, so I have this problem here about prime factorization, and I need to find the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of x^11. The given x is 107 multiplied by 109 to the fifth power. Both 107 and 109 are primes, which is good because that means the prime factorization is straightforward.

Let me think. If x is 107 * 109^5, then when I raise x to the 11th power, I have to apply the exponent 11 to each factor in the product. So, that would be (107^1) raised to the 11th power times (109^5)^11. 

Wait, right, because when you raise a product to a power, each factor is raised to that power. So, (a*b)^n = a^n * b^n. Yeah, that makes sense. So, x^11 would be 107^11 * 109^(5*11).

Let me compute the exponent for 109. 5 multiplied by 11 is... 5*10 is 50, plus 5 is 55. So, 109's exponent is 55. 

Looking at the options, option A is 55. So that should be the answer. Let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. 

The problem is about exponents in prime factors after raising x to a power. The original x has 107 to the first and 109 to the fifth. Raising to the 11th power multiplies each exponent by 11. So, 5*11 is 55 for 109. Yep, that looks right.

The exponent of 109 in x^11 is calculated by multiplying the exponent of 109 in x by 11. Since x = 107 × 109^5, the exponent of 109 in x^11 is 5 × 11 = 55. 

Answer:  
A: 55
