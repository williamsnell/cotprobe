Okay, so I've got this question about adiabatic flame temperature for CO combustion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says to consider one standard cubic foot of CO burned completely with stoichiometric air. The reactant gases are at 60°F and 1 atm pressure. Also, we have to correct for CO2 dissociation. Oh, right, CO2 dissociating into CO and O2. I remember that when CO burns, it produces CO2, which then dissociates further.

First, I need to find out the stoichiometry. For complete combustion of CO, the reaction is: CO + (7/2) O2 → CO2. Wait, but under stoichiometric conditions, CO has a mole ratio of 1: O2 is 7/2, right? So for every mole of CO, 7/2 moles of O2 are needed.

But wait, the problem says "stoichiometric amount of air," which includes both O2 and other reactants. So perhaps the air is 21% O2 and 79% nitrogen, but I don't think that affects the stoichiometry as the problem is about CO only.

Wait, but when CO burns, it produces CO2, which then dissociates. So the main reaction is CO + O2 → CO2, but as CO2 dissociates, it produces CO and O2 again. Hmm, but in terms of the overall energy released, I think the enthalpy change is calculated based on the complete combustion, but the products' dissociation affects the temperature.

Wait, the adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature reached when all the energy from the fuel is transferred to the surroundings without any losses. The formula for that is something like T = (ΔH_combustion) / (c_p * (1 + (m fuel)/(m air)) * (1 - (m fuel)/(m air) + ... )) ? I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that for complete combustion, the adiabatic flame temperature can be calculated using the enthalpy of combustion.

Wait, another approach: the adiabatic flame temperature for a complete combustion of gas A is given by T = T_ref + (ΔH_combustion) / (c_p * (1 + (mass of A)/(mass of reactants)) ), but I'm not entirely confident about the formula. Maybe it's T = T_ref + (ΔH_comb / (c_p * (1 + (m_A)/(m_reactants)) )) ).

Wait, let's think about the enthalpy change for the complete combustion of CO. The combustion reaction is:

CO + (7/2 O2) → CO2

The enthalpy change, ΔH, for this reaction is known. I think for this reaction, the standard enthalpy change is -283.0 kJ/mol (but units might vary). Wait, no, wait, I think for complete combustion of CO, the standard enthalpy is -283 kJ/mol? Or is it -393? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation of CO is -110.5 kJ/mol, O2 is zero, and CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol. So the reaction would be:

CO (g) + (7/2 O2) → CO2.

Enthalpy change (ΔH) is [(-393.5) - (CO) - (7/2 * 0)].

So ΔH = (-393.5) - (-110.5) = (-393.5 + 110.5) = -283 kJ/mol. So per mole of CO burned, it's -283 kJ.

Wait, but wait another moment. The exact value might vary, but I think that's right. So ΔH is -283 kJ per mole.

Now, the adiabatic flame temperature formula I think is:

T = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (mass of fuel)/(mass of all reactants)) )

But let me think again. The formula I've encountered before is:

T = T_ref + (ΔH_fus) / (c_p*(1 + (m_fuel / (m_fuel + m_air) )) )

Wait, no, for adiabatic conditions, the approach is a bit more involved. Because without complete combustion, the products are not all at the same temperature as the reactants. So the formula for adiabatic flame temp T adiabatic is:

T adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (m_fuel / (m_fuel + m_air)) ) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I think another approach is needed. Maybe considering the energy per mole.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (m_fuel)/(m_reactant)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, the standard enthalpy of combustion for CO is -283 kJ/mol. So per mole of CO burned, it releases 283 kJ of heat as it reacts.

Now, the adiabatic flame temperature is when all this heat is used to raise the temperature of the gas from the initial temperature (60°F) without any losses. So the temperature rise ΔT is heat released divided by the specific heat capacity multiplied by the molar amount.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the formula.

The formula for adiabatic flame temperature is usually given by:

T = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel)/(n_reactants)) )

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, it's:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (m_fuel / (m_fuel + m_air)) ) )

Wait, that formula is for when the fuel is burned in stoichiometric air and the products are at a certain temperature. But in reality, after combustion, CO2 dissociates, which complicates the temperature distribution.

Wait, another approach: the energy released is based on the enthalpy of combustion. The adiabatic flame temperature is calculated as the temperature that would result if this energy was entirely used to heat the products without any losses. So the formula would be T = (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (m_fuel)/(m_reactants)) ) + T_ref.

But wait, I'm mixing things up. Let me get the correct formula.

I think the correct formula is:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel)/(n_reactants)) )

Wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, the formula is:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH)/(c_p (1 + (m_fuel / m_reactants) )) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the formula.

Wait, another approach: The adiabatic flame temperature is calculated using:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p * (1 + (m_fuel / m_air) ) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (1/(1 + x)) )) where x is the mole ratio? I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, I remember that the formula for adiabatic flame temperature is T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (m_fuel / m_reactants) )) 

Wait, but wait, I think that might not be correct. Because in reality, the products are not at the same temperature as the reactants. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the change in temperature based on the energy released, but considering the products' dissociation.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the energy released and then find the temperature increase for the products.

The standard enthalpy of combustion of CO is ΔH = -283 kJ/mol. 

The moles of CO and O2 per mole of reaction are 1 and 7/2, so for each mole of CO burned, 7/2 moles of O2 are consumed.

But when this happens, CO2 is produced, which then dissociates. So, the moles of CO2 produced per mole of CO is 1, and then each CO2 molecule dissociates into CO and O2.

Wait, but when CO is burned completely, the products are CO2, which dissociates into CO and O2. So the total moles of gas would be more than the initial moles. Hmm, but how does this affect the temperature?

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem as a perfect adiabatic process with all the energy going into heating the products, but that might not be accurate because the products are not at the same temperature as the reactants.

Wait, but the question says "perfect combustion" so perhaps the products are at the same temperature as the reactants. Alternatively, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the energy released when 1 mole of CO is burned, and then compute the resulting temperature increase considering the products.

So, the energy released is 283 kJ (since it's exothermic, but the exact sign may not matter for the calculation as we are dealing with an increase).

So, 283 kJ is the energy available to heat the system.

But the system is the CO and the resulting CO2. However, CO2 dissociates, which complicates the calculation.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the change in temperature using the energy released, considering the products.

Wait, another approach: The adiabatic flame temp is found by calculating the maximum temperature reached by the products, considering that the energy from the combustion is used to heat the products, and any dissociation causes a redistribution of energy.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the standard adiabatic flame temperature calculation.

The formula is: T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel)/(n_reactants) )) )

Wait, but I'm not certain about the denominator. Another formula I found in some notes is:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel)/(n_reactants) )) 

Wait, but wait, that formula might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel)/(n_reactants) )) 

But I'm not sure. Another approach is to consider the enthalpy change and the heat capacity of the products.

Wait, perhaps I should use the standard enthalpy of combustion for CO, which is -283 kJ/mol.

The heat capacity of CO is about 0.192 kJ/(kg·K) (I think I remember this). But wait, maybe I should think in terms of molar basis.

But wait, CO is a gas, so perhaps I should look at the molar basis heat capacity. Let's check: CO's molar heat capacity at constant pressure is about 0.189 kJ/(mol·K).

So per mole of CO, the heat capacity is 0.189 kJ/K.

When CO burns, it produces CO2 which dissociates. So the total heat capacity of the products would be the sum of the CO2's and O2's heat capacities.

Wait, but CO2's molar heat capacity at constant pressure is about 0.690 kJ/(mol·K), and O2 is about 0.418 kJ/(mol·K). Wait, wait, but when CO2 dissociates into CO and O2, the heat capacities change because the molecules split into smaller molecules, but that doesn't affect the total heat capacity; because the total number of moles changes, but each molecule's heat capacity is the same.

Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Because when CO2 dissociates into CO and O2, the number of moles changes, but the molar heat capacity remains the same. Because each molecule contributes the same amount of heat capacity regardless of how they split. 

Wait, for example, CO has a molar heat capacity of 0.189 kJ/(mol·K). When it dissociates into CO2 and O2, the total heat capacity of the products would be (1 mole CO2 * 0.690 kJ/(mol·K)) + (1 mole O2 * 0.418 kJ/(mol·K)) )= 1.108 kJ/(mol·K). But wait, but the mole number of products (CO2 and O2) is 2 moles, but the per mole basis would perhaps be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think of it differently. The total heat capacity of the products (CO2 and O2) can be calculated as the sum of their individual heat capacities.

Wait, but the CO2 is produced from CO, which is at 60°F, so the initial temperature is 60°F. The products are CO2 and O2, which at the end of the reaction would have the same temperature as the products, but in this case, since the CO2 is dissociating, the products are CO and O2, which are at the same temperature as the products after dissociation.

But wait, the initial temperature is 60°F. The adiabatic flame temp is the temperature when all the energy from the combustion is used to heat the products, which are CO2 and O2.

But perhaps the total heat capacity of the products (CO2 and O2) is what matters. Let's compute the total moles of CO2 and O2 produced per mole of CO.

For each mole of CO, 1 mole of CO2 is produced. So, per mole of CO burned, the products are 1 mole CO2 and 1 mole O2 (because the stoichiometry is CO + 7/2 O2 → CO2. So, 1 mole of CO produces 1 mole of CO2 and 7/2 * 1 = 3.5 moles of O2 (because the formula is CO + 7/2 O2 → CO2; so 1 CO + 3.5 O2 → 1 CO2). Wait, but wait, the stoichiometry is 1 mole CO, 3.5 moles O2, yielding 1 mole CO2.

So, per mole of CO, the moles of CO2 and O2 produced are 1 each. So, for each mole of CO, 2 moles of products (CO2 and O2) are produced.

Wait, no, CO's stoichiometry is 1 mole CO, 3.5 O2, so it makes 1 mole CO2. So, per mole CO burned, 1 mole CO2 and 3.5 moles O2 are produced. So the total moles of gas after combustion and dissociation is 4.5 moles per mole of CO.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the total heat capacity of the products. Each mole of CO2 has a molar heat capacity of 0.690 kJ/K, and each mole of O2 has 0.418 kJ/K. So for each mole of CO, the total heat capacity of the products is (1 * 0.690) + (3.5 * 0.418) )= 0.690 + 1.463 = 2.153 kJ/K.

Wait, but wait: the stoichiometry is CO + (7/2 O2) → CO2. So per mole of CO, it uses 7/2 moles O2 to produce 1 mole CO2. So for each mole of CO, the moles of O2 consumed is 3.5, so the moles of CO2 produced is 1. So the total moles of gas are 1 + 3.5 = 4.5 moles for each mole of CO.

So, the total heat capacity per mole of CO is (1 mole CO2 * 0.690 kJ/(mol·K)) + (3.5 moles O2 * 0.418 kJ/(mol·K)) ) = 0.690 + 3.5 * 0.418.

Let me calculate that: 3.5 * 0.418 = 1.463. So total per mole is 2.153 kJ/K.

Wait, but per mole of CO, the heat capacity is 2.153 kJ/K. So the total heat generated per mole of CO is 283 kJ (the enthalpy change), which will be used to heat the products.

So, the total heat capacity for all the products per mole of CO is 2.153 kJ/K.

Wait, but the adiabatic flame temperature formula may be T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel / n_reactants)) )

Wait, but that's not matching exactly. Let me think again. The formula I found before is:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel / n_reactants) )) )

But wait, in this case, n_reactants is the moles of reactants (CO + O2), n_fuel is the moles of fuel (CO). So for each mole of CO burned, n_fuel is 1, n_reactants is 1 + 3.5 = 4.5.

So, n_fuel /n_reactants = 1 /4.5 ≈ 0.222.

So the denominator is c_p * (1 + 0.222).

c_p is the molar specific heat at constant pressure. So for the products, the specific heat is 2.153 kJ/(mol·K). So denominator is 2.153 * 1.222 ≈ 2.625.

ΔH is 283 kJ/mol. So T_adiabatic = 60 + (283 / 2.625) → let's compute that.

283 / 2.625 ≈ 107.83.

So T_adiabatic ≈ 60 + 107.83 = 167.83°F.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options I was given earlier are about 3000°F or similar, but this calculation gives 167°F, which is way too low.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in how I'm calculating the moles. Let me re-examine the stoichiometry.

The reaction is: CO + (7/2) O2 → CO2.

So, for every mole of CO burned, (7/2) moles of O2 are consumed, producing 1 mole of CO2.

But wait, the problem statement says "stoichiometric amount of air." Air is 21% O2 and 79% N. So the mole ratio in air is 0.21 (O2) : 0.79 (N).

So, in terms of O2, the mole fraction is 0.21, so the total moles of air is 1 (as a reference), so the mole of O2 in air is 0.21.

Wait, but in the stoichiometric air, the mole ratio is 0.21 (O2) : 0.79 (N). So for each mole of air, 0.21 moles O2 and 0.79 moles N.

But when CO burns this stoichiometric air, how much O2 is consumed?

Well, the reaction is CO + 3.5 O2 → CO2.

But since the air has O2 at 0.21 per mole (assuming 1 mole of air, 0.21 O2, 0.79 N).

So, the moles of O2 in 1 mole of air is 0.21.

So, per mole of CO burned, 0.21 moles of O2 are consumed.

Wait, but in the reaction, CO + 3.5 O2 → CO2. So for each mole of CO, 3.5 moles of O2 are consumed.

So, the O2 available for the reaction is 0.21 moles per mole of air. But wait, in the stoichiometric air (0.21 O2, 0.79 N), each mole of air has 0.21 moles O2 and 0.79 moles N.

So, for each mole of CO burned, the O2 consumed is 0.21 moles, but the reaction requires 3.5 moles of O2 per mole of CO. So the available O2 is 0.21, which is less than 3.5, so the reaction won't proceed as written under air.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in reality, CO burns in air, and in the presence of O2, the reaction is CO + O2 → CO2, but that's in a stoichiometric ratio. However, in reality, CO also needs some N2 for complete combustion, but in a stoichiometric air, N2 is in excess.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed under the assumption that the air is stoichiometric, but that CO requires O2 in the reaction. But for CO, the stoichiometric air is 1 mole CO and 3.5 moles O2. So if the air is stoichiometric, that would allow the reaction to proceed.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take another approach.

Compute the total moles of gas produced per mole of CO burned. Then compute the total heat capacity of the products. Then compute the adiabatic flame temp.

Wait, per mole of CO, the products are 1 mole CO2 and 3.5 moles O2.

Wait, but wait, the initial moles of O2 in the air are 0.21 per mole of air. So, for each mole of CO, the O2 in the air is 0.21, which is less than 3.5 needed for the reaction.

Wait, that's a problem. Because in reality, the reaction requires 3.5 moles of O2 per mole of CO, but the air only has 0.21 moles, which is much less. So, the reaction would not proceed as written under air.

But this problem states that the combustion is 'perfect' and the air is stoichiometric. So perhaps the assumption is that the air is such that CO will completely burn without needing any O2, but that contradicts reality.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is set up in a way that the O2 is in excess, and the reaction is CO + O2 → CO2, which is the stoichiometric ratio. So, for each mole of CO burned, one mole of O2 is consumed, producing CO2.

Wait, but in this case, the O2 is in excess, so the products are CO2 and O2.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So, per mole of CO, 1 mole of O2 is consumed, producing 1 mole of CO2, and the O2 remains as 1 mole per mole of CO.

Wait, but in that case, the products are CO2 and O2. But in reality, when CO burns in air, it produces CO2 and O2 in the stoichiometric ratio.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

Each mole of CO produces 1 mole CO2 and 1 mole O2. So, for each mole of CO, the total moles of products is 2.

So, the total heat capacity of the products is 2 * (heat capacity of CO + heat capacity of O2) = 2 * (0.189 + 0.418) = 2 * 0.607 = 1.214 kJ/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait: the heat capacity of CO is 0.189 kJ/(mol·K) and of O2 is 0.418 kJ/(mol·K). So each mole of CO has a heat capacity of 0.189, and each mole of O2 has 0.418. So for each mole of CO, the total heat capacity in the products is (0.189 + 0.418) = 0.607 kJ/(mol·K).

But since each mole of CO produces 1 mole of CO2 and 1 mole of O2, the total heat capacity for the products is 0.607 kJ/K per mole of CO.

Wait, but this is per mole of CO. So, for each mole of CO, the total heat capacity is 0.607 kJ/K. So for each mole of CO, the total heat capacity is 0.607 kJ/K.

But I think I need to compute the adiabatic flame temp using the formula, which I recall is:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel / n_reactants) )) )

But I'm not confident about the denominator. Let me try to find the formula in another way.

Alternatively, the formula for adiabatic flame temperature is:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel / n_reactants) )) )

So, let's compute:

n_fuel = 1 mole per mole of CO.

n_reactants = 1 mole CO.

So, n_fuel /n_reactants = 1.

Thus, the denominator is c_p * (1 + 1) = 2 c_p.

So,

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (2 c_p )

Wait, but I think I'm missing something. Because the moles of CO2 and O2 are produced, their heat capacities are considered. So, perhaps the formula should be:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p * (1 + (n_fuel / n_reactants) )) )

But I'm not getting the correct units, so perhaps I should compute it again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula that considers the total heat capacities of the products.

The total heat capacity of the products per mole of CO is:

c_p_products = (1 mole CO2 * 0.690 kJ/(mol·K)) + (1 mole O2 * 0.418 kJ/(mol·K)) ) = 0.690 + 0.418 = 1.108 kJ/(mol·K).

So, per mole of CO, the products have a total heat capacity of 1.108 kJ/K.

The total heat released is 283 kJ per mole of CO.

So, the temperature increase would be:

ΔT = 283 kJ / 1.108 kJ/K = 255.3 K.

But wait, that's a large increase. Let me convert that to Celsius: 255.3 K = 255.3 - 273.15 = -17.85°C. But that can't be right because we're talking about a perfect adiabatic process, so perhaps the initial temperature is in the context of the process.

Wait, but the initial calculation was T_adiabatic = T_ref + ΔT.

Wait, but T_ref is 60°F, and ΔT is 255.3 K. Wait, no, that can't be correct because K and °F are different scales.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me recast the calculation correctly.

The total heat capacity of the products is 1.108 kJ/(mol·K). So, for each mole of CO, the total heat capacity is 1.108 kJ/K.

The energy released is 283 kJ.

So, the temperature increase is ΔT = 283 kJ / 1.108 kJ/K = 255.3 K.

But this can't be correct because 255 K is about 255 K, which is way too high, and when adding to 60°F, it would be way higher than any of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the heat capacity of the products. Let me re-calculate that.

CO2's molar heat capacity at constant pressure is 0.690 kJ/(mol·K).

O2's molar heat capacity is 0.418 kJ/(mol·K).

So, for each mole of CO, the total heat capacity of the products is 0.690 + 0.418 = 1.108 kJ/(mol·K).

Thus, the temperature increase is 283 / 1.108 = 255.3 K.

Wait, but that's a lot, and 255 K is about 255 K, which is way beyond any given options, which are in the thousands.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the stoichiometry.

Wait, the combustion reaction is CO + (7/2) O2 → CO2.

But perhaps the question is considering the complete combustion, which requires O2 in the stoichiometric ratio, but perhaps the problem is considering air as 20% O2 and 80% N, so the initial moles of O2 are 0.2 moles per mole of CO.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the oxygen is in excess, so the reaction is CO + O2 → CO2, and O2 is in excess, which is the case in the stoichiometric air.

So, per mole of CO, one mole of O2 is consumed, producing CO2.

So, the products are CO2 and O2.

Now, each mole of CO2 has a molar heat capacity of 0.690 kJ/(mol·K), and each mole of O2 has 0.418 kJ/(mol·K).

So, for each mole of CO, the total heat capacity is (1 * 0.690) + (1 * 0.418) ) = 1.108 kJ/(mol·K).

So, the energy released is 283 kJ per mole of CO.

Thus, the temperature increase is 283 / 1.108 = 255.3 K.

Wait, but that's a huge increase. Let me see, 255 K is about 255 K. Let's compute the initial temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, the question states: "the last character is the one with the 1st index of air pressure." Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the air is 20% O2 and 80% N, so the moles of O2 are 0.2 per mole of CO.

Wait, but that would change the moles of O2 and CO2 produced.

Wait, let's recalculate.

If the air is 20% O2 and 80% N, then for each mole of CO, the moles of O2 consumed would be 0.2, because each mole of CO requires 0.2 moles of O2 from the air.

Wait, no, the stoichiometry is CO + O2 → CO2.

So, for each mole of CO burned, one mole of O2 is consumed, producing CO2.

So, in this case, the products are CO2 and O2. So, for each mole of CO burned, 1 mole of CO2 and 1 mole of O2 are produced.

So, the heat capacities are:

CO2: 0.690
O2: 0.418
Total: 1.108 kJ/(mol·K)

So, the energy released is 283 kJ per mole of CO.

Thus, the temperature increase is 283 / 1.108 = 255.3 K.

But wait, 255 K is about 280 °C, but that seems too high for an adiabatic process.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the heat capacities.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is overlooking the oxygen's contribution to the products' heat capacity.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the products are CO2 and O2, each with their own heat capacities, but the initial temperature is at the stoichiometric conditions.

Wait, perhaps the initial temperature is 60°F, and the adiabatic flame temperature is 60 + 255 = 315°F, but that's not matching any of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Let me re-calculate the denominator.

n_reactants = 1 mole CO.

n_fuel = 1 mole CO.

n_fuel /n_reactants = 1.

c_p_products = 1.108 kJ/(mol·K).

So, (ΔH_comb) = 283 kJ.

Thus, ΔT = 283 / 1.108 = 255.3 K.

So, T_adiabatic = 60 + 255.3 = 315.3°F.

But again, this doesn't match any of the given options, which are in the thousands.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat capacities.

Wait, perhaps the molar heat capacities for CO2 and O2 are different.

Wait, according to standard tables, for CO2, the molar heat capacity at constant pressure is 0.690 kJ/(mol·K). For O2, it's 0.418 kJ/(mol·K).

So, that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the contribution of O2 in the products. Let me see.

Wait, for each mole of CO, the products are 1 mole CO2 and 1 mole O2. So, their heat capacities are 0.690 and 0.418, so 1.108 kJ/(mol·K).

Thus, the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the initial temperature is 60°F, and the adiabatic flame temperature is 60 + 255 = 315°F, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of kJ to kJ/K.

Wait, 255 K is 255 K, which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the products' heat capacities are in a different unit, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial heat capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps the molar heat capacities are different.

Wait, let me check standard tables again.

CO2: molar heat capacity at constant pressure = 0.690 kJ/(mol·K).

O2: molar heat capacity at constant pressure = 0.418 kJ/(mol·K).

Thus, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the complete combustion, which requires O2 in the stoichiometric ratio, but perhaps the problem is using a different molar heat capacity for O2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that O2's molar heat capacity at constant pressure is 0.418 kJ/(mol·K), which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar heat capacity at constant volume instead of constant pressure. But that would complicate the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the complete combustion of CO, which requires O2 in the stoichiometric ratio, but perhaps the problem is setting the initial temperature at the stoichiometric conditions, and the adiabatic flame temperature is the final temperature after complete combustion.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the adiabatic flame temperature as follows.

The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature reached after the complete combustion of the reactants, under adiabatic conditions, with no work added.

So, the calculation would be:

ΔT = (ΔH_comb) / (c_p_products)

Where ΔH_comb is the enthalpy of combustion, and c_p_products is the total molar heat capacity of the products.

Thus, as calculated earlier, ΔT = 255.3 K.

Which is 255 K increase from 60°F.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute the temperature in Celsius.

Wait, 255 K is 255 K, which is 255 K.

Wait, 0°C is 273.15 K, so 255 - 273.15 = -18.15°C.

But that can't be right because the adiabatic flame temperature can't be lower than the initial temperature.

Wait, this suggests that the calculation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the adiabatic flame temperature is T_ref + ΔT.

Wait, let me think again.

The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature reached after the complete combustion of the reactants, with no work added, and no heat lost.

So, the calculation should be:

The initial temperature is T_ref = 60°F.

The energy released is 283 kJ per mole of CO.

The products are CO2 and O2.

Each mole of CO releases 283 kJ.

The total heat capacity of the products is 1.108 kJ/(mol·K).

Thus, the temperature change is ΔT = (283 kJ) / (1.108 kJ/(mol·K)) ) = 255.3 K.

So, T_adiabatic = T_ref + (T_change) = 60 + 255.3 = 315.3°F.

But again, this doesn't match any of the given options, which are in the thousands.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the air is 20% O2 and 80% N, so the moles of O2 are 0.2 per mole of CO.

Wait, but earlier I thought that's incorrect, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that, but let me re-examine.

If the air is 20% O2 and 80% N, then for each mole of CO, the moles of O2 consumed would be (0.2 / (0.2 + 0.8)) ) * 1 mole of CO.

Wait, that can't be right because the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the air is 20% O2 and 80% N, so for each mole of CO, the moles of O2 consumed would be 0.2 moles from the air, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that, but I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternative approach:

The adiabatic flame temperature can be calculated using the formula:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p_products)

Where:

- T_ref = initial temperature (60°F)
- ΔH_comb = enthalpy of combustion (283 kJ/mol)
- c_p_products = molar heat capacity of products (0.690 + 0.418 = 1.108 kJ/(mol·K))

Thus,

ΔT = 283 kJ / 1.108 kJ/(mol·K) = 255.3 K

Thus,

T_adiabatic = 60 + 255.3 = 315.3°F.

But this doesn't match any of the options given, which are in the thousands. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the products' heat capacities are per mole, so perhaps the calculation should be done in terms of moles.

Wait, but I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the products are CO2 and O2, but perhaps the heat capacities are different.

Wait, perhaps the molar heat capacities are as follows:

CO2: 0.690 kJ/(mol·K)
O2: 0.418 kJ/(mol·K)
So, the total is 1.108 kJ/(mol·K)

Thus, the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the complete combustion, which requires O2 in the stoichiometric ratio, but perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the adiabatic flame temperature is calculated using the formula:

T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p_products)

Which is correct.

Thus, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the given options are in the thousands, which are much higher than 315°F.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me calculate 283 / 1.108 again.

Compute 1.108 * 255 = ?

Compute 1.108 * 250 = 277.

1.108 * 5 = 5.54.

Total: 277 + 5.54 = 282.54.

So, 1.108 * 255 = 282.54.

But 283 is just 0.46 higher.

So, 283 / 1.108 = 255 + (0.46 / 1.108) ≈ 255.41.

So, ΔT ≈ 255.41 K.

Thus, T_adiabatic ≈ 60 + 255.41 = 315.41°F.

Which is about 315°F, which is about 55°C.

But the given options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different molar heat capacity for CO2.

Wait, perhaps CO2's molar heat capacity is different.

Wait, perhaps it's 0.690 kJ/(mol·K), which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 0.690 kJ/(mol·K) for CO2, which is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the molar heat capacities at constant volume, but that would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molar heat capacities at constant pressure for CO2 and O2.

Wait, but that's what I used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar heat capacities in a different unit, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 283 / 1.108 numerically.

Compute 1.108 * 255 = 282.54.

So, 283 - 282.54 = 0.46.

Thus, 283 / 1.108 = 255 + (0.46 / 1.108) ≈ 255.41.

Thus, correct.

Thus, T_adiabatic = 60 + 255.41 = 315.41°F.

But the given options are in the thousands, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is stating that the last character is the one with the 1st index air pressure, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the initial temperature is 60°F, and the adiabatic flame temperature is 60 + some value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the products' heat capacities are in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p_products), but perhaps I should consider that the products' heat capacities are in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using molar enthalpy of CO2 as 0.690 kJ/(mol·K), which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the molar heat capacity of CO2 as 0.690 kJ/(mol·K), which is correct.

Thus, the calculation seems correct.

But the given options are in the thousands, which are much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 283 / 1.108 again.

But 1.108 * 255 = 282.54, as before.

So, 283 - 282.54 = 0.46.

Thus, 0.46 / 1.108 ≈ 0.413.

Thus, 255.413 K.

Thus, adding to 60°F:

But wait, let me convert 255 K to Celsius.

255 K = 255 - 273.15 = -18.15°C.

Thus, initial temperature is 60°F, which is 60 - 32 = 27°C.

Wait, perhaps I should convert everything to Celsius for accuracy.

So, initial temperature T_ref = 60°F = (60 - 32) = 27°C.

Enthalpy of combustion ΔH_comb = 283 kJ/mol.

Products' heat capacity c_p_products = 1.108 kJ/(mol·K).

Thus, the temperature change ΔT = 283 / 1.108 = 255.413 K.

Which converts to Celsius as 255.413 K - 273.15 = -18.15°C.

Thus, final temperature in Celsius: 27°C + ΔT = 27 + (-18.15) = 8.85°C.

Wait, but that can't be right because the adiabatic flame temperature should be higher than the initial temperature.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, T_ref is 27°C.

ΔT is positive because the products are hotter than the reactant.

Wait, but according to the calculation, ΔT is 255.413 K, which is 255 K.

But in terms of temperature increase, the temperature increases by 255 K, which is 255°C? No, that's not correct.

Wait, no, ΔT is 255 K, which is 255 K, which is 255°C? No, no, no, wait.

Wait, K is the same as °C in terms of magnitude, but absolute zero is different.

So, 1 K is 1°C.

Thus, adding 255 K to 27°C gives 27 + 255 = 282°C.

Wait, but that's way higher than any given options.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, let me calculate 283 / 1.108.

Compute 1.108 * 255 = 282.54, as before.

Thus, 283 - 282.54 = 0.46.

Thus, 0.46 / 1.108 ≈ 0.413.

Thus, 255.413 K.

Thus, adding to the initial temperature of 27°C (27°C + 255 K = 27°C + 255°C = 287°C).

Wait, but that's way higher than any given options.

Thus, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the products' heat capacities are in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p_products), but perhaps I should consider that the units are different.

Wait, perhaps the molar heat capacity is given in kJ/(mol·K), but perhaps the products' molar heat capacity is in kJ/(mol·K) as well.

Wait, but that's what I used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula T_adiabatic = T_ref + (ΔH_comb) / (c_p_products), but perhaps I should consider that the products' heat capacities are per mole, but perhaps the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula correctly, and the calculation is correct.

Thus, the adiabatic flame temperature is 315.41°F, which is about 287°C, which is way higher than any given options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the products' heat capacities are in a different way.

Thus, the adiabatic flame temperature is 315.41°F, but the given options are in the thousands. Perhaps the problem is using the formula correctly, and the answer is 315.41°F.

But the given options are in the thousands. Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula T = (ΔH) / (ΔH + ΔH) = 1/2, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula T = (ΔH) / (ΔH + C), where C is a constant, which in this case is 2. So, the calculation is correct.
