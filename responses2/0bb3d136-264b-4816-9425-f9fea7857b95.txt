Alright, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 100°C. I need to calculate the change in entropy. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Okay, first, I remember that entropy change for a reversible heat transfer is given by the formula ΔS = Q_rev / T. But wait, I should make sure the units are correct. The question gives me Q in kJ and asks for entropy change in J K⁻¹. So I'll need to convert 25 kJ to J. Oh right, 1 kJ is 1000 J, so 25 kJ is 25,000 J.

Next, the temperature. The problem says the temperature is 100°C. Oh wait, but entropy formulas usually use Kelvin, not Celsius. So I have to convert 100°C to Kelvin. I recall that Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So 100 + 273.15 equals 373.15 K. Let me double-check that math: 100 + 273 is 373, plus 0.15 is 373.15. Yep.

Now, putting it all together. The entropy change ΔS would be Q_rev divided by T. So that's 25,000 J divided by 373.15 K. Let me compute that. Hmm, 25,000 divided by 373.15. Let me see, 373 times 69 is about 25,677, which is a little over 25,000. So maybe 67 or 68. Let me calculate it more accurately. 

Wait, maybe I should do a quick division. 373.15 * 67 = ?

373 * 67: Let's compute that.

373 * 60 = 22,380,

373 *7 = 2,611.

Adding them: 22,380 + 2,611 = 24,991. That's close to 25,000. The difference is 25,000 - 24,991 = 9 J. So 67 would give 24,991 J, so 9 J more needed. So 67 + (9/373.15) ≈ 67.024. Because 9 / 373 is approximately 0.024. So the entropy change is approximately 67.024 J K⁻¹. 

Looking at the options, option H is 67 J K⁻¹. So the answer must be H. 

Wait, but wait a second. The block of iron is large. Oh, right, when dealing with a large block of material, it's treated as a constant temperature object. So the heat transferred Q is the heat required to raise the temperature of the iron block. But wait, in this case, the problem says 25 kJ is transferred, so I don't need to worry about the specific heat capacity or anything. Because for a large block, all the heat goes into changing the temperature, and the entropy change is just Q_rev over T. So I don't need to calculate any other factors like mass or specific heat.

So yeah, the correct answer is H.

To calculate the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 100°C, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the temperature to Kelvin
The temperature is given as \( 100^\circ \text{C} \). To convert this to Kelvin:
\[
T = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the heat energy to joules
The heat energy is given as 25 kJ. Converting to joules:
\[
Q = 25 \, \text{kJ} = 25,000 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy change
Using the formula:
\[
\Delta S = \frac{25,000 \, \text{J}}{373.15 \, \text{K}}
\]

Performing the division:
\[
\Delta S \approx 67.024 \, \text{J K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated entropy change is approximately \( 67 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \), which corresponds to option H.
