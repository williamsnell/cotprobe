Okay, so I've got this question here about Mr. Donald's stock investment and calculating his rate of return. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question says that last year, Mr. Donald received dividends from his stocks totaling $48, $64, $82.50, and $90. His total investment was $12,450. They want the rate of return to the nearest 1/10 percent. The options are A through J, with various percentages. 

Wait, the question is about the rate of return. So I think that's the dividend yield, right? Because the return on investment would typically be the dividend per share divided by the cost per share. Oh wait, but wait, wait. Wait a second, the question says 'rate of return on his investment for the year.' So maybe it's the total dividends divided by total investment, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Wait, but I think in stock terminology, rate of return can sometimes refer to the dividend yield. But sometimes, it's the total return, which includes both the dividends and the capital gains. But wait, in this case, all the stocks were bought presumably, but it's not specified whether the investment was held for the year. Oh, but the question says 'last year's' return. So maybe it's just the dividend received, over the total investment.

Wait, let me think again. Dividend yield is the annual dividend per share divided by the stock price. But in this question, we're given the actual dividends received, which are four amounts. So perhaps the total dividends received during the year are the sum of those four. Let me add them up.

So, $48 + $64 is $112. Then plus $82.50 gives $194.50, plus $90 makes $284.50 total dividend received. So the total dividends are $284.50.

The total investment was $12,450. So the rate of return is (Dividends / Investment) * 100. So that's (284.50 / 12450) * 100.

Let me calculate that. So 284.50 divided by 12450. Let's do that division. Hmm, 12450 goes into 284.50 how many times? Well, 284.50 / 12450 = ? Let me think, 12450 times 0.025 is 311.25. Wait, 12450 * 0.025 = 311.25. But wait, 284.50 is less than that. So 284.50 / 12450 is approximately 0.023. Wait, because 12450 * 0.023 is 286.35, which is a bit higher than 284.50. So 284.50 is approximately 0.023 times 12450.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me calculate it precisely. 12450 * x =284.50. So x = 284.50 / 12450. Let me compute that. 

Let me calculate it step by step. 284.50 divided by 12,450. Let's see, 12,450 goes into 284.50 how many times? Well, 12,450 is 12.45 thousand, and 284.50 is about 0.23 of that. So 0.023 approximately. But let me do the exact division.

Compute 284.50 ÷ 12450.

We can write this as 28450 ÷ 1245000 (because moving the decimal two places to make the denominator 12,450 * 100=1,245,000). So 28450 ÷ 1,245,000.

Wait, 28450 ÷ 1245000.

Let me compute that. Let me do this division step by step. 28450 ÷ 1245000.

Well, perhaps it's easier to convert this into a decimal by dividing numerator and denominator by 50. 28450 ÷50 is 569, and 1,245,000 ÷50 is 24,900. So 569 ÷24900.

Hmm, 24900 goes into 569 how many times? Zero times. So 0.023... Let's see, 24900 * 0.023 = 572.7. Which is a bit higher than 569. So 0.023 is a bit high.

So 24900 * x = 569.

x = 569 /24900 ≈ 0.02303.

So approximately 0.02303, which is about 2.303%.

So the rate of return is approximately 2.303%. The question says to round to the nearest 1/10 percent, which is 0.1 percent increments.

So 0.02303 is about 2.303%. Rounding to the nearest 0.1% would be 2.3% (since 0.023 is closer to 0.02 than 0.03? Wait, wait no, 0.023 is 2.303%, which is 2.3% when rounded to 1/10 percent.

Wait, because 0.023 is 2.3%, but wait, wait, the options are in 0.1 percent increments. So 2.303% would be 2.3% when rounded to the nearest 0.1%? Or is it 2.3% or 2.3%? Wait, 2.303% is 2.3% when rounding to the nearest 0.1% because the third decimal is 0, so it's 2.3%. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again: 2.303 is 2.30 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, 2.303 is 2.30 when rounded to two decimal places, but the question says to the nearest 1/10 percent. So 0.1 percent is 0.1, 0.2, etc. So 2.303% is 2.3% when rounded to the nearest 0.1% because the third decimal is 0, so it's 2.30, which is 2.3%. Wait, but wait, 2.303 is actually 2.30 when rounded to two decimal places, but when to the nearest 0.1% (which is one decimal place), it's 2.3% because the next digit is 0, so it rounds down.

Wait, but wait, 2.303% is 2.30 when rounded to two decimal places, but for 1/10 percent, which is 0.1, 2.303 is 2.30 when rounded to the first decimal place. Because the second decimal is 0, so it doesn't round up. So 2.303 becomes 2.3% (since 0.3 is the first decimal place). Alternatively, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: when rounding to the nearest 0.1%, which is one decimal place, 2.303% is 2.3% because the next digit is 0, so we don't round up.

Wait, but let me think about this. 2.303 is 2.30 when rounded to two decimal places. But when rounding to one decimal place, 0.303 is 0.3. So the answer is 2.3%.

So looking at the options, option C is 3.0%, option D is 2.0%, option F is 1.5%, etc. Wait, none of the options are 2.3%. Hmm, wait, looking at the options:

Options:

A: 2.8% 

B: 2.6% 

C: 3.0% 

D: 2.0% 

E: 3.2% 

F: 1.5% 

G: 2.3% 

H: 1.8% 

I: 3.7% 

J: 4.5%

Wait, I thought the rate was approximately 2.3%, which is option G. But wait, did I do the calculation correctly?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Dividends: 48 +64= 112; 82.50 +90= 172.50; 112+172.50= 284.50. Total investment is 12450. So 284.50 /12450 = ?

Another way: 284.50 ÷ 12450 = ?

Let me compute 284.50 divided by 12450.

Let me compute 284.5 ÷ 12450.

We can write this as 284.5 ÷ 12450 = ?

Let me compute 284.5 ÷ 12450 numerically.

Let me do this as:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 284.5 ÷5=56.9; 12450 ÷5=2490. So 56.9 ÷2490.

Which is the same as 56.9 /2490.

Hmm, 2490 * 0.023 is 57.27, which is a little more than 56.9. So 0.023 is 0.023 *2490=57.27.

We have 56.9, which is 57.27-0.37=56.9. So 0.023 *2490=57.27

So 56.9 is 57.27 -0.37 → which is 2490 * (0.023 - x) =56.9, where x is the small delta.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 56.9 ÷2490.

Compute 56.9 ÷2490.

Let me compute 56.9 ÷2490.

Well, 2490 ÷56.9 is approximately 44.38, but I'm getting the reciprocal.

Alternatively, let's compute 56.9 ÷2490 = (56.9 / 2490) = 0.02292 approximately.

Because 2490 *0.02292 = 2490 *0.02=49.8; 2490 *0.00292= approximately 2490 * 0.003 is 7.47, but 0.00292 is 0.003 minus 0.00008. So 7.47 - (2490 *0.00008)=7.47 - 0.1992=7.2708.

So 49.8 +7.2708=57.0708, which is very close to 56.9. So 0.02292 is a bit higher than needed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 56.9 /2490.

Let me compute 2490 into 56.9.

2490 is 2490.0, and 56.9 is 56.90.

So 2490 goes into 56.90 how many times? 0.02292 times, as I calculated earlier.

So approximately 0.02292, which is 2.292%.

Wait, but wait, that's 2.292%, which is approximately 2.3% when rounded to the nearest 0.1%.

So the rate of return is approximately 2.3%, but looking at the options, option G is 2.3%, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, let me check if I added the dividends correctly.

Wait, 48 + 64=112. 82.50 +90=172.50. 112+172.50=284.50. Yes, that's correct.

Then 284.50 / 12450= approximately 0.02292, which is 2.292%, so about 2.3%.

So the correct option is G: 2.3%.

To determine the rate of return on Mr. Donald's investment, we calculate the total dividends received divided by the total investment, then convert to a percentage.

1. **Total Dividends**:  
   The dividends received are $48, $64, $82.50, and $90.  
   Adding them up:  
   \[
   48 + 64 = 112 \\
   82.50 + 90 = 172.50 \\
   112 + 172.50 = 284.50
   \]

2. **Total Investment**:  
   The total investment is $12,450.

3. **Rate of Return**:  
   The rate of return is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Rate of Return} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Dividends}}{\text{Total Investment}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Rate of Return} = \left( \frac{284.50}{12450} \right) \times 100 \approx 2.292\%
   \]

4. **Rounding**:  
   The rate of return is approximately 2.292%, which rounds to 2.3% when rounded to the nearest 1/10%.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: 2.3%**.
