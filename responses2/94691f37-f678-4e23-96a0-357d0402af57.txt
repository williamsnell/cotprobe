Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of people in Ethiopia who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that the options are A to J, with various percentages. I need to remember what the actual figure was for 2013. I'm not exactly sure, but I think there's a general trend where a significant portion of the population might believe that certain political parties are corrupt. 

Wait, I remember reading somewhere that around 80% of the population in Ethiopia believed that corruption was a real issue. So if 84% was an option, that might be close. Let me check the options again. Option F is 84%, and option G is 64%. Hmm, which one is correct?

Another approach: I think the percentage could be around 80-85%, but let me think about the 2013 data. I recall that in 2013, there was a significant push towards anti-corruption movements, especially in government positions. So the majority of the population might have been in favor of anti-corruption policies.

Looking at the options, 84% is an option, but 74% is also there. Wait, I'm trying to remember the exact figure. If I'm not sure, maybe I should think of the options again. Let me list them out:

A:44
B:34
C:74
D:4
E:54
F:84
G:64
H:24
I:94
J:14

So, the options for percentage would be 44,74,4,54,84,64,24,94,14. The question is which one is correct for 2013.

I think the actual figure was around 84%, so option F. Alternatively, some sources might have different numbers, but I'm pretty confident that 84% was the answer. So the correct answer should be F: 84%.

The correct answer is F: 84%.

Answer:
F: 84%
