Okay, so I've got this problem here about Spark Co. and their business. Let me see if I can figure this out. Alright, let's read the question again.

So, Spark buys cordless phones for $125 each and sells them for $200 each. They pay a sales commission of $25 per phone sold, and their monthly fixed costs are $3000. They want a profit of 10% of sales. The question is, how many units must they sell?

The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct number. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to calculate the contribution margin per unit, which is the selling price minus the variable costs. Variable costs here include the purchase price and the commission. So, the variable cost per unit would be $125 (purchase) + $25 (commission) = $150 per unit.

The selling price is $200, so the contribution margin per unit is $200 - $150 = $50. That makes sense; each unit contributes $50 towards covering fixed costs and generating profit.

Next, I remember that the formula to find the number of units needed to achieve a certain profit is (Fixed Costs + Desired Profit) divided by the contribution margin per unit. But wait, in this case, the desired profit isn't given as a dollar amount but as a percentage of sales. So that's a bit different.

They want a profit of 10% of sales. Hmm. So, profit is 10% of total revenue. Let's denote the number of units sold as 'x'. Then, total revenue is 200x, and desired profit is 0.10 * 200x = 20x dollars.

Alternatively, profit can be calculated as (Selling price - Variable costs - Fixed costs) * x = Profit. But in this case, profit is also 10% of sales, which is 20x. So, setting up the equation:

Profit = (Selling Price - Variable Costs) * x - Fixed Costs = Desired Profit

Wait, no. Let me think again. Profit is also total revenue minus total costs. So, Profit = (200x) - (150x + 3000) = 50x - 3000. And this profit is equal to 10% of sales, which is 0.1*200x = 20x.

So, setting up the equation: 50x - 3000 = 20x.

Let me solve this equation. Subtract 20x from both sides: 30x - 3000 = 0. Then, 30x = 3000. Dividing both sides by 30 gives x = 100.

Wait, so that would mean 100 units. Looking at the options, E is 100. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Another approach: Desired profit is 10% of sales. So, Profit = 0.1*(Selling Price * x) = 0.1*(200x) = 20x.

Profit is also equal to (Selling Price - Variable Cost) * x - Fixed Costs. So, Profit = (200 - 150)x - 3000 = 50x - 3000.

Setting them equal: 50x - 3000 = 20x. So 30x = 3000 → x=100.

That brings me back to 100 units. So the correct answer would be E, 100. Let me see if that makes sense. If they sell 100 units, their total revenue is $20,000. Variable costs are 150*100 = $15,000. Fixed costs are $3,000. So total costs are 15k +3k=18k. Profit is 20k-18k=2k. 10% of sales is 2k, which matches. So yes, 100 units is correct.

To determine how many units Spark Co. must sell to achieve a 10% profit of sales, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate Variable Costs per Unit**: Purchase price ($125) + commission ($25) = $150.
2. **Contribution Margin per Unit**: Selling price ($200) - variable costs ($150) = $50.
3. **Set Up Profit Formula**: Desired profit is 10% of sales, which is 0.1*(200x) = 20x. Profit is also calculated as (200x - 150x - 3000) = 50x - 3000.
4. **Equation**: 50x - 3000 = 20x → 30x = 3000 → x = 100.

Thus, Spark Co. must sell **100 units** to meet the desired profit. The correct answer is **E: 100**.
