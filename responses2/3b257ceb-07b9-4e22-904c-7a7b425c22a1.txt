Okay, so I've got this question here about Morgan and her social networking friends. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that Morgan has 60 female friends and 50 male friends. She's part of 5 social groups, but I don't think that number is relevant for this problem. The key info here is about how many of her friends live in town.

It says 30% of her female friends live in town and 40% of her male friends live there. I need to find out how many out-of-town friends she has in total.

So, let's start with the female friends. She has 60 female friends, and 30% live in town. To find out how many live in town, I'll calculate 30% of 60. Hmm, 30% is the same as 0.3. So, 0.3 multiplied by 60. Let me do that math: 0.3 * 60 equals 18. So, 18 female friends live in town. That means the out-of-town female friends would be the total minus the ones in town. So 60 minus 18 is 42. Got that down for females.

Next, the male friends. She has 50 male friends, and 40% live in town. So, I need to find 40% of 50. 40% is 0.4, so 0.4 * 50 equals 20. So, 20 male friends live in town. That leaves 50 minus 20, which is 30 male friends who are out of town. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait a second. Wait, 40% of 50 is 20, so 50 minus 20 is 30. So, 30 male friends are out of town.

Now, to get the total number of out-of-town friends, I need to add the out-of-town female friends and the out-of-town male friends. So that's 42 plus 30. Let me add those: 42 + 30 equals 72. Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, 30% of 60 is indeed 18, so 60-18=42. 40% of 50 is 20, so 50-20=30. Adding 42 and 30 gives 72. So the total out-of-town friends are 72.

Looking at the options, option B is 72. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: 72.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Female Friends in Town:**
   - 30% of 60 female friends live in town.
   - 0.3 × 60 = 18.
   - Female friends out of town: 60 - 18 = 42.

2. **Male Friends in Town:**
   - 40% of 50 male friends live in town.
   - 0.4 × 50 = 20.
   - Male friends out of town: 50 - 20 = 30.

3. **Total Out-of-Town Friends:**
   - 42 (female) + 30 (male) = 72.

Answer: B: 72.
