Okay, so I've got this question about the concept of prima facie duties, which I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I'll try to think it through. The question asks which option correctly describes how we learn about our prima facie duties.

First, I need to remember what prima facie means. I think it stands for "prima facie," which is Latin for "primary fact" or "primary matter." So, prima facie duties are the duties we should act towards based on the facts at our disposal, without considering other possible facts that could override them.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Learning through the consequences of actions. Hmm. I'm not sure. I thought the prima facie is about what should be done based on what's given, not about the actual outcomes.

B: Apprehending general principles and inferring the rightness of particular acts. Oh, this makes sense. If we know what's right in general, we can apply it to specific situations. That would be the basis for prima facie duties.

C: Intuitively understanding moral obligations. That seems too vague. Intuition is subjective and not a structured method. Plus, without knowing the principles beforehand, this might not be how it's learned.

D: Legal regulations and laws. Well, laws are created by governments and regulate behavior. But laws don't directly teach us the duties; they are the outcomes.

E: Seeing the rightness of acts and then inferring general principles. Wait, that's a bit circular. It sounds like you first know the specific acts, then generalize, but I'm not sure if that's how it's learned. I thought it's the other way around.

F: Societal norms and cultural values. These are societal constructs, but are they learned through observation? I think norms are often learned through social interactions, but I'm not sure if that's the primary method.

G: Making moral judgments in various situations. That sounds a bit like experience. We might learn by applying our own observations and reasoning in different scenarios.

H: Moral instruction as children. This is a strong option. The way we're taught in school, movies, etc., often includes moral principles. So, maybe children are taught these through explicit instruction.

I: Proving philosophically. That's more about debate and logic rather than learning the duties themselves.

J: Religious teachings or scriptures. While religious teachings can influence moral principles, they are often interpreted by individuals, not the primary source of duties.

Putting it all together, the correct answer is likely option B. Because prima facie is about inferring the rightness of an action based on general principles. So, we first have a general principle, then apply it to a specific situation to determine if the act is prima facie right.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: by apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts.**

**Explanation:**
Prairie facie duties are learned by grasping general moral principles and then applying them to specific acts. This aligns with option B, which describes the process of using general principles to determine the rightness of individual actions. This approach reflects how individuals learn moral duties through understanding and applying general principles in various situations.
