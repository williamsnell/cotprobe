Question:

5.5-7. Suppose that the distribution of the weight of a prepackaged "1-pound bag" of carrots is $N\left(1.18,0.07^2\right)$ and the distribution of the weight of a prepackaged "3-pound bag" of carrots is $N\left(3.22,0.09^2\right)$. Selecting bags at random, find the probability that the sum of three 1-pound bags exceeds the weight of one 3-pound bag. HInT: First determine the distribution of $Y$, the sum of the three, and then compute $P(Y>W)$, where $W$ is the weight of the 3-pound bag.

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to find the probability that the sum of three 1-pound bags of carrots exceeds the weight of one 3-pound bag. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the weight of a prepackaged "1-pound bag" is normally distributed with a mean of 1.18 and a standard deviation of 0.07. So, each 1-pound bag's weight, let's call it X, follows a normal distribution N(1.18, 0.07²). Since it's a single measurement, each bag is independent, right?

Now, they’re asking about three of these 1-pound bags. So, the sum Y of three such bags would be the total weight. Since each X is normally distributed, the sum of normal variables is also normal. The mean of Y should be three times the mean of X. Let me calculate that: 3 * 1.18 = 3.54. And the variance would be three times the variance of X, so 3*(0.07²) = 3*0.0049 = 0.0147. Therefore, the standard deviation of Y is sqrt(0.0147), which is approximately 0.1212. So Y is normally distributed as N(3.54, 0.1212²).

Next, the 3-pound bag's weight, let's call it W, is also normally distributed. The mean is 3.22 and the standard deviation is 0.09, so W ~ N(3.22, 0.09²).

We need to find P(Y > W). That is, the probability that the sum of three 1-pound bags is heavier than a single 3-pound bag. 

Since both Y and W are normal, their difference (Y - W) would also be normal. The mean of Y - W is the mean of Y minus the mean of W, and the variance is the sum of the variances since they're independent. Let's compute that.

Mean of Y - W is 3.54 - 3.22 = 0.32. 
Variance is 0.0147 + 0.0081 (since 0.09² is 0.0081) so total variance is 0.0228. Thus, the standard deviation of Y - W is sqrt(0.0228) ≈ 0.1510.

So Y - W follows a normal distribution with mean 0.32 and standard deviation ~0.1510. We need to find P(Y - W > 0), which is P(Z > (0 - 0.32)/0.1510), where Z is the standard normal variable.

Calculating the Z-score: (0 - 0.32)/0.1510 ≈ -2.117. So we need the probability that Z is greater than -2.117.

Looking up the standard normal table, the area to the left of Z = -2.12 is approximately 0.0170. Hence, the area to the right (which is what we want) is 1 - 0.0170 = 0.9830.

So the probability that three 1-pound bags exceed one 3-pound bag is approximately 0.9830, which is option G.

To find the probability that three 1-pound bags exceed a 3-pound bag, we model the sum of the three 1-pound bags, Y, and the single 3-pound bag, W, as normal distributions. Y is N(3.54, 0.0147) and W is N(3.22, 0.0081). The difference Y - W is N(0.32, 0.0228). The Z-score for Y - W > 0 is approximately -2.117, yielding a probability of 0.9830.

Answer: G
