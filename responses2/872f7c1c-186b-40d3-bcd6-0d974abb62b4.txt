Question:

A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for evaluation of recurrent injuries. Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Skeletal survey
B: Echocardiography
C: Bone scan
D: MRI of the shoulder

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the best next step is for this 5-year-old girl's evaluation. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, the patient is a 5-year-old girl. Her parents are concerned because she's had recurrent injuries and has been walking with a limp. She started walking at 14 months and since then, she's had more injuries. She's had chest pain with exertion since joining a soccer program three months ago.

She usually has pain or swelling in her knees or ankles after practice. She wears glasses for two years. Her brother had two operations for a rotator cuff injury sustained while showering, and her maternal cousin died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at 26, so she's probably in good condition.

The physical exam findings: midsystolic click at the apex, swollen left ankle, tender joints, and limited range of motion by 25 degrees of genu recurvatum. The upper extremities are hypermobile, and the lower extremities have extended thumbs and flexibility at the waist. The palms can touch the floor with straight knees.

Looking at the options:

A. skeletal survey: That would check for any structural issues, like fractures or disc herniation. But the findings don't point to that. She's young, 5, so bones are probably fine. So maybe not A.

B. Echocardiography: The patient has a history of a rotator cuff injury, but that's from a brother. She's a child, so her heart is probably in good shape. Echocardiogram might not show any issues here. So maybe B isn't the next step.

C. Bone scan: This would check for any joint issues, like tendinitis, tenderness, or disc problems. The midsystolic click suggests possible injury, but the 25 degrees of recurvatum is within normal, so that's not a problem. The swollen ankle and pain suggest possible injury, but it's also possible it's just a reaction. So bone scan could help rule out a mild injury that's not severe enough to warrant a more serious assessment.

D. MRI of the shoulder: The patient has had a soccer program, which could be related to her injuries. The limits of motion and tenderness could point to a shoulder issue. Perhaps a shoulder injury like a rotator cuff tear or a shoulder strain. MRI would help see if there's a tear or if there's tenderness. If that's the case, MRI would be the next step.

So the options C and D are possibilities. The patient's brother had a rotator cuff injury, but that's an adult injury. The patient is a 5-year-old, so maybe the injury is more of a developmental one, like a sprain or a mild issue. But the exam shows midsystolic click, which is a type of tendinitis, not a tear. So maybe the next step is to look for tenderness or to rule out any other issues.

Echocardiogram (B) doesn't seem relevant here. The bone scan (C) would check for tenderness, which is present. So the best next step would be a bone scan to assess tenderness and any possible tendonic issues. So the answer is C. Or maybe D if it's something more serious like a shoulder injury.

Wait, the midsystolic click suggests a possible injury. If she has a shoulder injury, the MRI would be the next step. But if it's a minor issue, like a sprain or a mild tenderness, the bone scan would be better.

Looking at the options, either C or D could be correct. But the question is about the next step. The options are about what to do next. The exam findings point to possible shoulder instability or a mild tenderness.

If the patient has a shoulder injury, MRI would be indicated. But if it's just a mild tenderness, a bone scan would be better. The question doesn't specify if it's a more severe injury, but given the information, the bone scan could rule out a more serious issue.

Alternatively, the patient may have a rotator cuff tear, but that would be more severe and the exam might have shown disc herniation. Since it's a midsystolic click, perhaps it's a tenderness issue. So the bone scan (C) would be the next step to check for tenderness and disc issues.

Wait, the question is about the next step in diagnosis. The options are about what to do next. The options are:

A: skeletal survey (evaluate bones)
B: Echocardiogram (check heart, which is not indicated here)
C: Bone scan (check tenderness)
D: MRI of the shoulder (check for injury, maybe a tear)

The initial findings don't point to a heart issue, so B is out. It's a physical exam, so A is not the next step either. The patient is young, so A's not likely. So C and D are options. If the patient has a shoulder injury, D would be the next step. If it's a mild tenderness, C would be better.

The question says she has had a soccer program, which is a physical activity, but that's probably more about the shoulder, as soccer injuries often involve the shoulder. So, perhaps the next step is to get an MRI of the shoulder.

So, the correct next step is D: MRI of the shoulder.

The patient's physical exam findings indicate signs of a potential injury, including tenderness at the midsystole and limited range of motion. The options for the next step are:

- **A: skeletal survey**: This would evaluate bones but does not address the physical injury findings. Unlikely.
- **B: Echocardiography**: Not applicable, as the patient's condition is developmental, and the heart is likely in good condition.
- **C: Bone scan**: This would assess tenderness and disc issues, which are relevant given the findings. Useful for identifying a mild injury.
- **D: MRI of the shoulder**: This would evaluate for a shoulder injury, such as a tear, which is supported by the patient's history of a soccer program and the findings.

Given the evidence, the most appropriate next step is to perform an MRI of the shoulder to rule out a shoulder injury or tenderness.

**Answer: D**
