Alright, so I've got this question here about colors and energy per photon. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned in chemistry about this. Let me think. I know that different colors are made up of different wavelengths of light. I think energy per photon depends on the wavelength, right?

Wait, energy of a photon is calculated using the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So shorter wavelengths mean higher energy per photon because λ is in the denominator. 

So, the colors listed are violet, turquoise, green, blue, red, pink, yellow-green, white, orange, and indigo. I need to figure out which has the shortest wavelength, because that color would have the most energy per photon.

I remember that the visible spectrum is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So the shorter wavelengths are in violet (like violet is around 400 nm or so), and the longer wavelengths are in red, which includes orange, red, etc.

Looking at the options, violet is a primary color and has a shorter wavelength than many others. Turquoise might be on the edge, maybe around 475-495 nm, but still, violet is the shortest. Green is 500-570 nm, which is longer than violet. Blue is around 450-495, same as green. Turquoise is similar to green but perhaps a bit longer. Red is 620-750, so longer than violet.

White is a mixture of all colors, so that's longer than violet. Orange is about 610-700, but still longer than violet. Indigo is in the blue-green range, around 470-510 nm, so longer than violet but shorter than some colors like blue or green.

Wait, what's the order from shortest to longest? Let's list the colors and their approximate wavelengths:

- Indigo: about 470 nm (blue-green)
- Violet: 400-450 nm (violet)
- Turquoise: 475-495 nm (so longer than indigo)
- Green: 495-500 nm (so longer than violet, but shorter than blue, red, etc.)
- Blue: 450-500 nm (so longer than violet, but shorter than green, which is longer than blue?)
Wait, no, no. Wait, blue's upper limit is 500, green starts at 495. So violet (400-450) is shorter than blue (450-500), which is shorter than green (500-570), etc.
Red starts at 620. So the order from shortest to longest is violet (400-450), indigo (470), blue (450-500), green (500-570), violet is shorter than blue, but blue starts at 450. Wait, no, violet is shorter than blue. Because blue starts at 450, which is longer than violet's 400-450. So violet is shorter than blue.

Wait, so putting them in order from shortest to longest: violet (400-450), indigo (470 nm), blue (450-500), green (500-570), red (620-700), etc.

So the color with the shortest wavelength is violet (A). That would mean violet has the most energy per photon. So the answer should be A.

To determine which color has the most energy per photon, we consider the relationship between wavelength and energy of a photon, given by the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energy per photon. Among the listed colors:

- **Violet** has a wavelength of approximately 400–450 nm, making it the shortest among the options.
- **Indigo** is slightly longer, at 470–510 nm.
- **Blue** starts at 450–500 nm, which is longer than violet but shorter than green, red, or others.
- **Green** starts at 495–500 nm.
- **Violet** is the shortest, followed by indigo, blue, green, red, etc.

Since violet has the shortest wavelength, it has the most energy per photon.

Answer: A
