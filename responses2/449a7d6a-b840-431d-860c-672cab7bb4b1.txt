Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the momentum uncertainty of an electron in the smallest diameter of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula involves the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum. The formula is Δp * Δx ≥ ħ/2, right? Or was it ħ (h-bar) divided by 2? Wait, no, I think it's ħ multiplied by something else. Oh wait, no, the exact formula is Δp * Δx ≥ ħ/2. But for this problem, I think they're using the approximation where Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Or maybe ħ itself is set as the uncertainty. I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The question is about the smallest diameter of a hydrogen atom. The diameter is about the Bohr radius, I think. Oh, right, the Bohr radius is the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom. I remember the Bohr radius a₀ is approximately 0.529 angstroms, which is 5.29e-11 meters. So the diameter would be twice that, around 1.058e-10 meters, but wait, sometimes I've heard the Bohr radius as the radius, not the diameter. Or is it?

Wait, wait. The Bohr radius is the radius of the orbit, so the diameter would be twice that. So a₀ is about 5.29e-11 meters, so diameter is 1.058e-10 meters. So Δx would be the uncertainty in position, which I think is taken as the Bohr radius, right? Because the electron is most likely within that radius, so the uncertainty in position is about the Bohr radius.

So I'll take Δx as the Bohr radius, 5.29e-11 m.

The Planck constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. And ħ is h/(2π), so approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Alternatively, sometimes ħ is taken as ħ≈1.055e-34, but exact value might not matter here, just need to use it correctly.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is Δp * Δx ≥ ħ/2. So to find Δp, we can rearrange: Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, but sometimes it's written as Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've seen it written as Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), but I think better to be precise.

So, let's compute Δp as ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, what's the value of ħ? It's h/(2π), so approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

So:

Δp = ħ/(2Δx)
= (1.055e-34 J·s) / (2 * 5.29e-11 m)
Wait, let me calculate that.

Denominator: 2 * 5.29e-11 = 1.058e-10 m.

So, (1.055e-34) / (1.058e-10) = ?

Let me compute 1e-34 / 1e-10 = 1e-24. But more precisely, 1.055e-34 / 1.058e-10 = (1.055/1.058) * 1e-24.

1.055/1.058 is approximately 0.997, which is about 1. So Δp ≈ 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me be more precise.

1.055 ÷ 1.058 = ?

1.058 is about 1.058, and 1.055 is a bit less. So 1.055 / 1.058 ≈ 0.997, so 0.997e-24 is about 1e-24. So Δp ≈ 1e-24 kg·m/s.

But wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle being ħ/(2Δx), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as Δp ≈ (h)/(4πΔx), but I think that's the same as ħ/(2Δx), because h = 2πħ. So h/(4π) = ħ/(2). So yes, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

So the calculation would lead to about 1e-24 kg m/s. Looking at the options, option A is 1e-24.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the numbers. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute denominator: 2 *5.29e-11 =1.058e-10.

Numerator: 1.055e-34.

So, 1.055e-34 / 1.058e-10 = (1.055 /1.058 ) * 1e-24.

1.055 / 1.058 = (1055)/(1058) = approximately 0.99719.

So 0.99719 * 1e-24 = approximately 1.0e-24, but a little less than 1e-24, maybe 9.97e-25, which is about 1e-24. So the momentum uncertainty would be about 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1e-24. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. I remember that the uncertainty calculation can sometimes be slightly different because of the choice of units. Let me think: ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So using that.

Wait, but wait: the position uncertainty is the Bohr radius, which is about 5.29e-11 m. So 1e-10 m is 10 times that. So earlier calculation holds.

Alternatively, what if I used the radius of the orbit as the uncertainty in position? Then 5.29e-11 m.

Wait, but wait another thing: sometimes the Heisenberg uncertainty is written as Δp Δx ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty occurs when Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

So that's exactly what I used. So the calculation holds.

So the momentum uncertainty is approximately ħ/(2Δx) = 1.055e-34 / (2 *5.29e-11) ≈ 1e-24.

So the correct answer would be option A: 1e-24.

To calculate the momentum uncertainty of an electron within the smallest diameter of a hydrogen atom, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta p \cdot \Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \(\Delta x\) is the uncertainty in position, and \(\Delta p\) is the uncertainty in momentum. The smallest diameter of a hydrogen atom corresponds to the Bohr radius (\(a_0\)), which is approximately \(5.29 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}\). The uncertainty in position is therefore:

\[
\Delta x = a_0 = 5.29 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \(\hbar\) is approximately \(1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the uncertainty in momentum is:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \cdot 5.29 \times 10^{-11}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \cdot 5.29 \times 10^{-11} = 1.058 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Now divide:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{1.058 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.0 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Thus, the momentum uncertainty is approximately \(1 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}\). Among the given options, the closest match is \(1 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}\), which corresponds to option A.
