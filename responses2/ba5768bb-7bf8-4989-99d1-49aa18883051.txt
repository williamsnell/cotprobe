Okay, so I have this question about a patient presenting with mood changes, and I need to figure out their diagnosis. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The patient is a 30-year-old nulliparous (so she hasn't given birth yet) female. She's anxious, hyperactive, and can't sleep for the past several months before menses began. Then on the day of menses, she's depressed, anorectic, irritable, and lethargic. No psychiatric history, so I can rule that out. Physical exam shows normal findings, so likely not something else.

She's trying to conceive, and the medical team has corrected a closed fallopian tube with a tubectomy a year ago. The options are various mood disorders and some psychological conditions. 

So the key points are the initial mood changes before menses, and then the acute mood changes on the day of menses. These are typical of various postpartum or uterine-related conditions.

Option C is Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. That's when the woman experiences mood swings during pregnancy. The symptoms often include irritability, mood swings, anorexia nervosa, etc., and can lead to anaphylaxis or other menses. So the initial anxiety and hyperactivity might fit here. But the acute mood on the day of menses with depression and anorectomy suggests a deeper issue, maybe related to the onset of menses.

Option F is seasonal affective disorder, which affects mood based on time of year. But this patient's symptoms started months before menses began. So maybe not.

Option J is major depressive disorder. But the initial mild mood changes and acute mood changes on menses could be more of a mood swing, not necessarily a depressive episode.

Option B is bipolar disorder, but the patient has an acute episode without a history of a history of mood disorders or systematic mood changes, so probably not.

Option A is generalized anxiety disorder, but this is more about physical and occupational concerns, not necessarily related to menses.

Option D is cyclothymic personality, which is a personality disorder triggered by mood swings. Unrelated.

Option E is persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), which is a long-term mood disorder with recurrent episodes. The patient's initial mood changes and the acute episode might fit, but I'm not sure if the context fits more with something else.

Option G is seasonal affective disorder, but that's about mood based on time of day, which doesn't fit the initial presentation.

Option H is Bipolar II disorder. Bipolar conditions can cause mood swings and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the patient's initial mood swings are more about an upset stomach or other physical symptoms, not necessarily a mood disorder itself.

Option I is adjustment disorder, which is about coping styles, but the patient's mood changes might not align with that.

Option J is Major depressive disorder. Let me think. The patient has nulliparous, so she hasn't given birth yet. The uterine-related issues with the fallopian tube correction. The initial mood changes could indicate a postpartum episode, but the acute mood on menses is more of an acute situation. So maybe it's a manifestation of a more severe condition.

Wait, the initial presentation is about anxiety and menses before the onset of menses. So she's experiencing these issues before they become permanent. That's typical of a condition like anorectomy or initial menses. But the acute mood change upon menses is more of a developmental phase, possibly related to a more severe condition.

So the most likely diagnosis is C: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Because that's when the woman experiences mood swings during pregnancy, leading to anaphylaxis, anorectomy, etc. The physical exam is normal, but mood changes before menses and during menses are more consistent with that.

The patient presents with an acute mood change on menses and a history of anorectomy due to a closed fallopian tube. The initial mood swings before menses suggest a condition related to uterine or postpartum episodes. Among the options, Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (Option C) best fits the scenario. This disorder involves mood swings during pregnancy, leading to anorectomy and anorectomy-induced anoxia syndrome. The acute mood change upon menses aligns with the manifestation of this disorder, making it the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
