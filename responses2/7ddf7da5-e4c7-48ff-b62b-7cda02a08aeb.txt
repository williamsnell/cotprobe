Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Express 0.1 with a bar over the 7, which is 0.17777..., as a common fraction. Hmm, I remember that repeating decimals can be converted into fractions by using some algebra. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me write the number down. So, it's 0.17777..., where the 7 repeats infinitely. I need to find a fraction that equals this decimal. I think the method involves setting the decimal equal to a variable and then manipulating it to solve for that variable.

Let me denote x as the repeating decimal. So, x = 0.17777...

Now, to get rid of the repeating part, I should multiply x by a power of 10 that moves the decimal point to the right past the non-repeating part. In this case, the non-repeating part is just the 1 after the decimal, so I'll multiply by 10 to shift it one place. That gives me 10x = 1.7777...

Wait, but the 7 is still repeating. Hmm, maybe I need to multiply again. If I take the original x (which is 0.17777...) and multiply by 10, I get 10x = 1.7777... Now, if I multiply that by 10 again, I get 100x = 17.7777... That way, the repeating parts will align.

So, now I have two equations:

1) 10x = 1.7777...
2) 100x = 17.7777...

If I subtract the first equation from the second, the repeating decimals should cancel out. Let's do that:

100x - 10x = 17.7777... - 1.7777...
That simplifies to 90x = 16.

Wait, 17.7777... minus 1.7777... is 16 because 17 minus 1 is 16, and the decimals subtract to zero. So, 90x = 16.

Now, solving for x gives x = 16/90. But this can be simplified. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2, so dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 8/45.

Wait, let me double-check that. 8 divided by 45 is 0.1777..., which matches the original decimal. So yes, that makes sense.

Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to approach this is to consider the decimal as 0.1 + 0.07777... because 0.17777... is 0.1 plus 0.07777...

I know that 0.07777... is a repeating decimal. Let me convert that into a fraction. Let me call it y = 0.07777...

Then, 10y = 0.7777..., which is 7/9. So, y = 7/90. Therefore, the original number is 0.1 + 7/90.

Converting 0.1 to a fraction is 1/10. So, 1/10 + 7/90. To add these, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 10 and 90 is 90. So, 1/10 is 9/90. Adding 9/90 +7/90 gives 16/90, which simplifies to 8/45. Yep, same result.

So, the correct answer should be 8/45, which is option A.

To express \(0.1\overline{7}\) as a common fraction, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let \(x = 0.1\overline{7}\), which is \(0.17777...\).

Multiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal past the non-repeating part:
- \(10x = 1.7777...\)

Multiply by 10 again to align the repeating parts:
- \(100x = 17.7777...\)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
- \(90x = 16\)

Solve for \(x\):
- \(x = \frac{16}{90}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{8}{45}\).

**Answer: A: \(\frac{8}{45}\)**
