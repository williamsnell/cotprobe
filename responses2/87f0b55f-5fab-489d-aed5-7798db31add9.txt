Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about binary component systems. Hmm, binary systems usually involve two components, right? So in this case, we've got component A and component B. 

The question says there's initially 3g of A and 7g of B. But wait, that's the initial amounts, but the problem isn't about the initial state. It's about when the system is brought to a temperature where two phases are present. So I guess I need to figure out the masses of each phase at that point.

The two phase are present, one with wt% A = 5% and the other with wt% A =50%. Wait, wt% means weight percent, so for component A. So phase 1 has 5% A, which means 95% B. Phase 2 has 50% A and 50% B.

I think this is a problem involving the phase rule. The phase rule is F = C - P + 2, where F is degrees of freedom, C is components (which is 2 for a binary system), P is phases (2 here), so F would be 2 - 2 + 2 = 2. But in this problem, they're probably not asking about the number of phases or temperature/pressure, but rather the masses of each phase once the mixture is at equilibrium.

Wait, maybe I need to use Raoult's Law or some phase equilibrium conditions. But another approach is using the lever rule or mass balance.

Let me think. So the initial system has 3g A and 7g B. So the total mass is 10g. Now, when we reach a point where two phases are present, each phase must have some of A and B.

Wait, but each phase is a mixture. So the total mass of each phase would be parts of the original mixture. Then, the mass of each phase can be found using the mole fractions and the mass of each component.

Wait, but the problem gives the mole fractions as mass percentages. Oh wait, no: the problem says the wt% of component A is 5% and 50%. So the mole fractions are different, because mole fractions depend on the molar masses. Oh wait, are the components A and B assumed to be ideal? I think the question is assuming ideal behavior, so we can proceed.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The problem states that the two phases have wt% A as 5% and 50%. So each phase is a solution of A and B. So for phase 1 (5% A), it's 5% A and 95% B. For phase 2 (50% A), it's 50% A and 50% B.

Now, each phase has a certain mass. Let me denote the mass of phase 1 as m_alpha and phase 2 as m_beta. But wait, another possibility is that the total mass of the system is 10g (3+7), and the sum of m_alpha and m_beta must equal 10g. So m_alpha + m_beta = 10g.

But wait, no. Because in the initial system, the total mass is 10g. But when we separate into two phases, each phase's mass would be part of the initial 10g. So yes, m_alpha + m_beta =10g.

But wait, perhaps not exactly, because if you have the initial system as a single phase, and you're separating into two phases, each phase's mass would be part of the original mixture.

So I think I can model this as a mass balance problem. Let me think in terms of the mole fractions.

Wait, but mole fractions can be tricky because it depends on the molar masses. So perhaps it's easier to use mass fractions since the question gives wt% values.

Let me think: So phase 1 has 5% A and 95% B. Let’s say the mass of phase 1 is m_alpha. So the mass fraction of A in phase 1 would be 0.05. Similarly, phase 2 has 0.5 A and 0.5 B.

The total mass of phase 1 (m_alpha) contributes 0.05*m_alpha to the mass of A in the system. Similarly, phase 2 contributes 0.5*m_beta to the mass of A. The sum of these should be equal to the initial mass of A, which is 3g.

So equation 1: 0.05 m_alpha + 0.5 m_beta = 3g.

And equation 2: m_alpha + m_beta = 10g.

So now I have two equations:

0.05 m_alpha + 0.5 m_beta = 3,

m_alpha + m_beta = 10.

Let me solve these two equations. Let me express m_beta from the second equation: m_beta = 10 - m_alpha.

Substitute into first equation:

0.05 m_alpha + 0.5 (10 - m_alpha) = 3

Compute:

0.05 m_alpha + 5 - 0.5 m_alpha = 3

Combine like terms:

(0.05 - 0.5) m_alpha +5 =3

-0.45 m_alpha = 3 -5 = -2

So m_alpha = (-2)/(-0.45) = 2 / 0.45 → Let me compute that.

2 divided by 0.45 is the same as 200/45 → which simplifies to 40/9 → which is approximately 4.444 g.

So m_alpha is approximately 4.444g.

Then m_beta = 10 - 4.444 = 5.556g.

Wait, let me check the math:

0.05 * (4.444) = 0.2222g,

0.5 *5.556 = 2.778g,

Sum is 0.2222 + 2.778 =3g. Correct.

So the masses are m_alpha =4.444g and m_beta=5.556g.

Now, looking at the options, option H says m_alpha =4.444g and m_beta=5.556g. So that's option H.

To solve the problem, we analyze the binary component system where two phases are present at equilibrium. The system consists of 3g of component A and 7g of component B (total mass = 10g). The two phases have wt% of component A as 5% and 50%, corresponding to phase α (5% A, 95% B) and phase β (50% A, 50% B, respectively). The goal is to determine the masses of these two phases.

### Step 1: Mass Balance Equation
The total mass of the system is conserved, so the sum of the masses of the two phases must equal the initial mass:
\[
m_\alpha + m_\beta = 10 \, \text{g}.
\]

The total mass of component A in the system is also conserved. The mass of A in phase α is \(0.05 m_\alpha\), and the mass of A in phase β is \(0.5 m_\beta\). Therefore:
\[
0.05 m_\alpha + 0.5 m_\beta = 3 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations
From the total mass equation:
\[
m_\beta = 10 - m_\alpha.
\]

Substitute \(m_\beta\) into the first equation:
\[
0.05 m_\alpha + 0.5 (10 - m_\alpha) = 3.
\]

Simplify:
\[
0.05 m_\alpha + 5 - 0.5 m_\alpha = 3,
\]
\[
-0.45 m_\alpha + 5 = 3,
\]
\[
-0.45 m_\alpha = -2,
\]
\[
m_\alpha = \frac{2}{0.45} = \frac{40}{9} \approx 4.444 \, \text{g}.
\]

Now, calculate \(m_\beta\):
\[
m_\beta = 10 - 4.444 = 5.556 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
Substitute \(m_\alpha = 4.444 \, \text{g}\) and \(m_\beta = 5.556 \, \text{g}\) back into the equations to confirm:
- Total mass: \(4.444 + 5.556 = 10 \, \text{g}\).
- Total mass of A: \(0.05 \times 4.444 + 0.5 \times 5.556 = 0.2222 + 2.778 = 3 \, \text{g}\).

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The masses of the two phases are:
\[
m_\alpha = 4.444 \, \text{g}, \quad m_\beta = 5.556 \, \text{g}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option H**.
