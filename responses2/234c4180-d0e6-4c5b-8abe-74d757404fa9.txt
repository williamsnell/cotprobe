Question:

A buyer signed a contract to purchase a tract of land from a seller. The contract was signed on May 1, 2006, and the closing is set for June 15, 2006. The land was located in a jurisdiction that has in force the following statute:Statute of Limitations "an action to recover the possession of land shall be brought within twenty- one (21) years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person who is entitled to bring such action at the time the cause accrued is within the age of minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, such action may be brought within ten (10) years after such disability is removed. "This statute was enacted in the jurisdiction in 1930. The land in question had been owned by a rancher in 1960. On September 1, 1960, the rancher died intestate, leaving his nephew as his only heir. The nephew had been born on October 1, 1954. In addition, there is a deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller dated November 1, 1960, which the latter recorded on the same date. During his title search, the buyer learned that the administrator had never obtained any license to sell the land in question; and also he (the administrator) never formally received the approval of any court with respect to the administration of the rancher's estate. Moreover, the buyer ascertained that the seller entered into possession of the land in question on November 1, 1960. On the assumption that there are no additional facts, the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question

Options:

A: on June 15, 2006.
B: when the nephew reached the age of 21.
C: when the administrator received court approval for the sale.
D: on May 1, 2006.
E: on September 1, 1960.
F: on October 1, 1985.
G: when the statute of limitations expired.
H: on November 12, 1981.
I: when the nephew dies.
J: on November 1, 1960.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about property contracts, statute of limitations, and a买者的 interest. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says a buyer signed a contract on May 1, 2006. The closing is June 15, 2006. The land was in a jurisdiction with a statute of limitations. The statute says that an action to recover possession can be brought within twenty-one years after it began (limitation period). But if the cause was brought by someone in minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, the period is reduced to ten years after the person is released from that condition.

This statute was enacted in 1930, but the facts here are way before that. The land was owned by a rancher in 1960. The rancher died intestate, so his heirs are the nephew, born on October 1, 1954. The buyer learned that the rancher's administrator had never obtained a license to sell the land, and he never formally received approval from any court regarding the rancher's estate. Also, the seller entered into possession on November 1, 1960.

The buyer is trying to figure out if the seller became the owner. So, the question is, when does the buyer have to decide that the seller is the owner? The options are several dates, including the statute of limitations dates and the events of interest.

Wait, the statute of limitations is about how long you can file a lawsuit for possession. So, the statute says 21 years from the cause. But if the cause was by someone under 21 or in bad mind, it's ten years after they're released.

In this scenario, the buyer is suing. The statute was 1930, but that's a lot before the facts start. The rancher died in 1960, so the statute of limitations period would end in 21 years after the cause began. Wait, but the statute of limitations applies to how long a person can act against the seller. So, the statute of limitations period starts when the buyer made the contract, which was on May 1, 2006. So, the statute of limitations would end 21 years later, at May 1, 2027.

But wait, the statute of limitations for the buyer in this case would be 21 years from the cause. Or wait, no—statute of limitations for a contract is 21 years from the time the contract was made. So, any lawsuit for possession must be filed within 21 years of the contract being signed. So, the buyer could file their suit by June 15, 2027. But maybe the statute of limitations is for the seller, or is it for the buyer? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the statute of limitations refers to the buyer's rights. Because the seller is the owner, the buyer can sue the seller for possession. So, the statute of limitations for the buyer would apply.

So, the statute of limitations for the buyer is 21 years from the contract, so May 1, 2006 plus 21 years is May 1, 2027. So, any lawsuit (like the buyer suing the seller) must be filed by that date.

But wait, the statute of limitations for the seller? No, the statute is for the buyer. So, the buyer can't file a lawsuit after May 1, 2027. But the question is, when does the buyer become the owner. Wait, no, the buyer is suing the seller, not the other way around. So, if the buyer can't file a lawsuit after May 1, 2027, then the seller could have taken over the land before that. But the question is about the statute of limitations.

Wait, the statute of limitations is a period within which you can't bring an action. So, the statute was in effect, but the statute was in 1930, but the facts here are in 1960. So, the statute of limitations for the buyer doesn't matter because the contract was in 2006, but the statute of limitations period hasn't expired yet. Wait, no, the statute of limitations is a period after the cause. So, the cause was the contract being signed in 2006. So, the statute of limitation period would be 21 years after that, which is 2027.

Wait, but that's too far in the future. Maybe I'm mixing up the purposes. Let me think again. The statute of limitations here is for the buyer to sue for possession. So, the buyer can't bring a lawsuit after May 1, 2027. If the contract was in 2006, then the statute of limitations period is 21 years, so any action (like suing) must be filed by that time.

But wait, the question is about the seller becoming or will become the owner. The statute of limitations is about the buyer's rights, not the seller's. So, the seller could have already taken over the land, but the buyer is suing to prevent that. 

The question says that the land was owned by the rancher in 1960. The rancher died intestate, so the nephew is the only heir. The administrator never sold the land, and the seller entered in 1960. So, the rancher's estate may not have approved any sale. The facts say that the seller got the land in 1960, so perhaps the rancher's estate didn't grant permission. 

Wait, the statute says that an action to recover possession must be brought within 21 years after the cause began. The cause was the contract being made on May 1, 2006. So, 21 years later would be May 1, 2027. But the statute of limitations here is about the buyer's rights. So, the buyer can't sue after May 1, 2027.

Wait, but the question is not about whether the buyer can file a lawsuit, but about whether the seller became the owner. So maybe the statute of limitations refers to some other period. Alternatively, perhaps the statute is about the court's ability to impose possession, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the statute of limitations here is about the buyer's rights. So, the buyer can't bring a lawsuit after 21 years from the contract. So, the statute of limitations can't be triggered. 

So, the buyer is suing the seller, and the statute of limitations is 21 years from the contract. If the contract was made in 2006, then the statute ends in 2027. So the buyer can't bring the suit after 2027. But the question is about whether the seller has taken over. So, the statute of limitations doesn't prevent the seller from taking over, because the statute of limitations is about the buyer's rights. Once the contract is done, the seller could have already taken the land.

Wait, but the court of the jurisdiction would have to decide whether the seller is the owner. But the statute of limitations is a period for the buyer to recover possession, not for the seller. So, the statute of limitations doesn't affect the seller's ownership. 

Alternatively, maybe the statute of limitations is about the seller's ability to enforce the contract. But no, the statute is about the buyer's rights.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me think. The statute of limitations for the buyer is how long they have to act against the seller. So, the statute of limitation period starts when the buyer made the contract, May 1, 2006. The contract was for possession, and the statute says the action must be in 21 years after the cause began. So, any action (like the buyer suing the seller for possession) must be filed by May 1, 2027.

But the question is, when does the seller become or will become the owner. The statute of limitations is about the buyer's rights, not the seller's. So, even if the seller took over, the seller could have had rights that the buyer didn't have. 

Wait, but the statute of limitation is about the buyer. So the buyer can't bring a lawsuit after May 1, 2027. So if the contract is over, the seller could have already taken the land, but the statute doesn't prevent that. So, the statute of limitation doesn't affect the seller's ownership.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing the statute of limitations for the contract's seller and the buyer. No, the statute of limitation in this context is about the buyer's right to seek possession, which is 21 years after the contract was signed. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027.

But in this scenario, the buyer is suing the seller now. The statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights. So, even though the contract was in 2006, the statute doesn't affect the seller's ability to take over.

Wait, but the question is about when the seller becomes the owner. So, the statute of limitation is about the buyer. So the buyer can't bring a lawsuit after May 1, 2027. Once the contract is completed, the seller could have already taken over. So, the statute of limitation doesn't change the fact that the seller is the owner. Unless the statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights, which they still have.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question." So, the buyer is suing the seller, and the statute of limitation is 21 years. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. But the facts don't mention any legal action by the seller; the facts are that he entered in 1960, and the land was sold in 1960. So, why is the statute of limitation affecting this?

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. The statute of limitation refers to the buyer's right to recover possession. Therefore, the statute of limitation is 21 years from the contract. So, the buyer can't file a lawsuit after May 1, 2027. 

But if the contract was signed in 2006 and the statute of limitation is 21 years, then the buyer can't act until May 1, 2027. So, by that time, the seller could have taken the land. So, the statute of limitation doesn't prevent the seller from taking over—only the buyer's rights.

Wait, but the question is about the statute of limitation. So, perhaps the statute of limitation is for the seller's rights, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The statute of limitation here is about the buyer's rights. It says that any action (like suing for possession) must be filed within 21 years after the contract was signed. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. So, the buyer can't bring a lawsuit against the seller after that date. 

But the facts say that the seller entered into possession in 1960. So, the seller has already taken the land, so the buyer can't sue against him after May 1, 2027. But the question is about when the owner becomes. So, it's when the contract was signed. But the buyer is suing the seller, so perhaps the statute of limitation is irrelevant because the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027, but the facts say the seller already took the land.

Wait, perhaps the statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights. The answer is that the buyer becomes the owner when the contract was signed, which is May 1, 2006. But that's not an option. Wait the options are for when the statute of limitation ended.

Wait, the options are:

A: June 15, 2006
B: when the nephew reached 21, which is 1954 +21=1975
C: when the administrator received court approval (so the seller could legally sell)
D: May 1, 2006 (when the contract was signed)
E: Sept 1960 (sale date by rancher)
F: Oct 1985 (statute of limitation period)
G: when statute of limitation expired (1930)
H: when the nephew dies in 1981
I: when the seller entered
J: Sept 1960 (sale date)

Wait, the options don't have May 1, 2006 as an option (option D). Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D is May 1, 2006. But the statute of limitation was 1930. So, the statute of limitation is a period in the future. So, perhaps the statute of limitation is irrelevant to the current facts.

Wait, but if the buyer is suing the seller, and the statute of limitation is 21 years, then the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. So, the seller could have already taken the land, but the statute doesn't prevent that.

But the question is, when will the seller become or will become the owner. The facts don't indicate any legal action by the seller, so the seller is the owner. The statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights, not the seller's. So, the answer is that the seller is the owner, and the statute of limitation doesn't prevent that.

Wait, but the options don't include May 1, 2006 as the correct answer. Let me look again at the options.

Looking at the options:

A: June 15, 2006: the closing date.
B: when the nephew reached age 21: 1975.
C: when the administrator got court approval: 1985.
D: May 1, 2006: contract date.
E: Sept 1960: when the rancher died.
F: Oct 1985: same as C.
G: when statute of limitation expired (1930).
H: when the nephew dies in 1981.
I: when the seller entered.
J: Sept 1960.

Wait, the options don't include May 1, 2006 as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but that's the date the contract was signed. Alternatively, perhaps the statute of limitation is about the seller's rights, so the answer is that the seller is the owner, which would be when the contract was signed, but that's not an option. Or perhaps the statute is irrelevant, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the statute of limitations again: it says an action can be brought within twenty-one years after the cause of the action was brought. So, the cause is the contract being made in 2006. So, 21 years later is May 1, 2027. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after that date. But the facts say the seller entered into possession in 1960. So, the seller is the owner, but the statute doesn't prevent that.

Wait, but the question is, when does the seller become or will become the owner. If the contract was signed in 2006, the seller owns it then. So the correct answer is May 1, 2006, which is option D. But wait, that's the date the contract was signed. The options don't have that as a correct answer because the options are for when the statute of limitation ends, not when the contract is signed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: the statute of limitation applies to the buyer. So the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. So, once the contract is signed, the seller is the owner. The statute of limitation doesn't change that. So, the answer would be that the seller is the owner, but the options don't include a date when the seller is the owner. The options are about when the statute of limitation ends, which is 1930.

Wait, no. The statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights. So, the answer would be that the seller is the owner, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is when the statute of limitation ended (1930), but that's not relevant to the facts.

Alternatively, perhaps the statute of limitation is about the seller's rights. But no, the statute of limitation in this case is about the buyer's rights. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. Once the contract is signed, the seller is the owner, so the buyer can't sue the seller after that.

But the question is about the seller becoming owner. So, the sale happened in 1960, so the seller is the owner. So the answer would be May 1, 2006. But that's not an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options don't have May 1, 2006 as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is that the seller became the owner when the contract was signed (May 1, 2006), but that's not an option. The options are about the statute of limitation's end date, which is 1930.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the statute of limitation and the statute of impossibility. Wait, no—statute of limitation is about how long you can act against someone else. The statute of impossibility is about how long someone can't act against themselves.

So, in this case, the statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights—21 years after the contract was signed. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. But the facts don't involve any legal action by the seller. So, the seller is the owner when the contract was signed, but the statute doesn't make the seller liable. So, why is the question here?

Wait, the question is phrased as: "the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question." So, the statute of limitation is 21 years from the contract date. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. Once the contract was signed in 2006, the seller is the owner. So, the answer is May 1, 2006, but that's not an option in the choices. Wait, the options are:

A: June 15, 2006
B: when the nephew reached 21 (1975)
C: when the administrator got court approval (1985)
D: May 1, 2006
E: Sept 1960
F: Oct 1985
G: when statute of limitation expired (1930)
H: when the nephew dies in 1981
I: when the seller entered (1960)
J: Sept 1960

Wait, D is May 1, 2006, which is when the contract was signed. So, perhaps the answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the statute of limitation is about the seller's rights, but in this case, the facts don't indicate any legal action by the seller. So, the seller is the owner, and the statute of limitation doesn't prevent that.

But the options don't include May 1, 2006 as an option. Wait, the options are labeled from A to J. Looking at the options, the correct answer is D, but the options don't have that. Wait, no, the options are:

A: June 15, 2006
B: when the nephew reached 21 (1975)
C: when the administrator got court approval (1985)
D: May 1, 2006
E: Sept 1960
F: Oct 1985
G: when statute of limitation expired (1930)
H: when the nephew dies in 1981
I: when the seller entered (1960)
J: Sept 1960

Wait, so the correct answer is D: May 1, 2006. So, the buyer should be advised that the owner is the contract signee, which is option D.

But wait, the facts say the rancher died in 1960, and the seller entered in 1960. So, the seller is the owner. So the correct answer is D. But the options don't have D as an option. Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: June 15, 2006

B: when the nephew reached age 21 (1975)

C: when the administrator received a court approval (1985)

D: May 1, 2006

E: Sept 1960

F: Oct 1985

G: when statute of limitation expired (1930)

H: when the nephew dies in 1981

I: when the seller entered (1960)

J: Sept 1960

So, D is May 1, 2006, which is when the contract was signed. So, the correct answer is D.

But wait, the statute of limitation in this case is about the buyer's rights. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. Once the contract was signed, the seller is the owner. So, the answer is that the owner is the contract signee, which is option D.

But wait, the question is about the statute of limitation. So, the statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. So, the seller could have already taken the land, but the statute of limitation doesn't prevent that. So, the answer is that the owner is the contract signee, D.

But the options don't have May 1, 2006. Wait, no, they do. Option D is May 1, 2006. So, the answer is D.

Wait, but the statute of limitation is about the buyer's rights, not the seller's. So, the buyer can't act against the seller after May 1, 2027. Once the contract was signed, the seller is the owner. So, the answer is that the owner is the contract signee, which is option D.

So, the correct answer is D: May 1, 2006.
</think>

The statute of limitation in this context refers to the buyer's rights to recover possession of the land within 21 years of the contract being signed (May 1, 2006). This means the buyer cannot act against the seller after May 1, 2027. However, once the contract was signed, the seller becomes the owner of the land. Therefore, the correct answer is D: May 1, 2006.
