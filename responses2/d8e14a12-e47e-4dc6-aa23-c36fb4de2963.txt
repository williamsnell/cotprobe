Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about determining the order of a reaction and writing the rate law expression. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in class.

So, the reaction given is OH^- + CH3COOCH2CH3 → CH3COO^- + CH3CH2OH. And the data is provided for different times, concentrations of both reactants.

The question has two parts: (a) determine the order, and (b) write the rate law expression. The options are from A to J, each giving a different order and rate law.

Wait, for part (a), I think I should analyze the data to see how the concentrations change with time. Since it's a kinetics problem, the rate of reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants.

I remember that for a reaction, the order is determined by how the rate depends on the concentrations. If the rate law is rate = k[A]^m [B]^n, then the overall order is m + n. But sometimes, the order can be determined by the concentration vs time data.

Looking at the data, let's list the times and concentrations.

Time (min) | [CH3COOCH2CH3] | [OH^-]
0.0      | 0.02000        | 0.02000
5.0      | 0.01280         | 0.01280
15.0     | 0.00766         | 0.00766
25.0     | 0.00540         | 0.00540
35.0     | 0.00426         | 0.00426
55.0     | 0.00289         | 0.00289
120.0    | 0.00137         | 0.00137

Wait, both [CH3COOCH2CH3] and [OH^-] are decreasing over time. Looking at the data, at each time point, the concentration of each reactant is decreasing by a factor that's the same. For example, at t=5 min, the concentration is 12.8% of the original. Similarly, at 15 min, it's 76.6% of the original. So, each time, the concentration is multiplied by (0.94)^something.

Wait, let me compute the ratio between successive times. Let's take the first two points. At 0 min, [A] is 0.02. At 5 min, it's 0.0128. Ratio is 0.0128 / 0.02 = 0.64. At the next step, from 5 to 15 min, 0.00766 / 0.0128 = 0.6. From 15 to 25, 0.00540 / 0.00766 ≈ 0.709. Hmm, getting a bit scattered, but perhaps the overall trend is consistent.

Wait, another approach: for a zero-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant would decrease linearly with time. But if the rate depends on [A]^n, the plot of [A] versus time should be a straight line. Let's see.

Alternatively, for a second-order reaction, the plot of 1/[A] versus time is linear. Let's test that.

Wait, but in this case, both [A] and [B] are changing. What about the rate law? Let me think about the possible rate laws.

The reaction is between OH^- and the carboxylic acid part of CH3COOCH2CH3. The reaction seems like a neutralization, perhaps a 1:1 reaction. But the question is about the rate law.

So, let's think about the possible rate laws. The options are:

A: Second order, rate = k[CH3COOCH2CH3][OH^-]^2

B: Second order, rate = k[OH^-]^2

C: First order, rate = k[CH3COOCH2CH3]

D: First order, rate = k[OH^-][CH3COOCH2CH3]^2

E: Second order, rate = k[CH3COOCH2CH3]^2

F: First order, rate = k[OH^-]

G: Second order, rate = k[OH^-][CH3COOCH2CH3]

H: Zero order, rate = k

I: Third order, rate = k[CH3COOCH2CH3][OH^-]

J: First order, rate = k[CH3COOCH2CH3] + k[OH^-]

Hmm. Let's think about whether each reactant is first or second order.

If the reaction is second order overall, that could mean the sum of the orders of each reactant is 2. So, possible scenarios: both first, or one first and one second, or both second. Let's see the data.

Looking at the data, for [OH^-], the concentration is decreasing, and same for [CH3COOCH2CH3]. Let's see if each is first order. If the reaction is first order overall, then the sum of the orders for each reactant would be 1. But if both are first order, the sum is 2, which would make the overall order second.

Let's check for each reactant.

For [CH3COOCH2CH3], looking at the data, each time the concentration is multiplied by a factor of 0.64, 0.6, 0.709, etc. Wait, the ratio is 0.64, 0.6, 0.709... Not a consistent ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is first order—so the concentration decreases by a constant factor each time, which would suggest first-order behavior. But wait, the rate of reaction is the change in concentration over time.

Wait, another approach: If the reaction is first-order overall, then the concentration of each reactant should decrease exponentially with time. But let's see.

Alternatively, for a first-order reaction, the plot of ln([A]) vs time should be linear. Let's compute ln([A]) for each time.

But wait, the data goes from 0.02000 to 0.00137, which is a drop from 200 to ~1.37% of the original. Let me compute the natural logs.

Wait, but wait, the time is in minutes, but for a first-order reaction, the half-life is ln(2)/k, and the concentration decreases exponentially. But according to the data, each time, [A] is multiplied by a factor each time. Let's see, the time steps are 5,15,25,35,55,120.

Wait, for the first-order case, the ratio between successive [A]s should be the same. Let's check.

At 0 min: 0.02000

At 5 min: 0.0128, which is 0.02000 * 0.64. That's a 64% decrease.

At 15 min: 0.00766, which is 0.0128 * 0.609 (approx). So the ratio is about 60.9% of the previous.

At 25 min: 0.00540, which is 0.00766 * 0.709 (approx). So ratio about 71%.

Similarly, 35 min: 0.00426 / 0.00540 = ~0.79, so 79% decrease.

55 min: 0.00289 / 0.00426 ≈ 0.678 (67.8% decrease).

120 min: 0.00137 / 0.00289 ≈ 0.477 (47.7% decrease).

Wait, the ratios between the successive [A]s aren't exactly the same, but they are decreasing. So that suggests that the concentration is decreasing in a way that's perhaps exponential, which would fit a first-order reaction. But for a first-order reaction, the half-life is constant. Let's see the half-lives for each step.

The half-life for each step would be the time it takes for [A] to reduce to half. Let's compute:

- Between 0 and 5 min: [A] decreased from 0.02000 to 0.0128. That's a 64% decrease. So half-life would be 5 min if it's first order, but 0.0128 is less than half (0.01). Hmm, but 0.0128 is 64% of initial, which is more than half. So the time taken for 5 minutes would not be the half-life then.

Wait, maybe I should compute the half-lives for each step.

For first-order, the half-life is ln(2)/k. But since the actual data doesn't show the same time for each half-life, perhaps it's not first order.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is second-order. So for a second-order reaction, the rate depends on the square of the concentration. Let's see the data.

If the reaction is second-order, the 1/[A] plot should be linear. Let's compute 1/[A] at each time.

At 0 min: 1/0.02000 = 50.

5 min: 1/0.0128 ≈ 78.125.

15 min: 1/0.00766 ≈ 130.68.

25 min: 1/0.00540 ≈ 185.185.

35 min: 1/0.00426 ≈ 234.76.

55 min: 1/0.00289 ≈ 346.02.

120 min: 1/0.00137 ≈ 729.92.

Now, let's see if the 1/[A] is linear with time. To check this, I can compute the slope between consecutive points.

5 to 15 min: (78.125 -50)/(15-5) ) = 28.125 /10 = 2.8125.

15 to 25 min: (130.68 -78.125)/(10) ≈ 52.555 /10 ≈5.2555.

25 to 35: (185.185 -130.68)/(10) ≈54.505/10≈5.4505.

35 to55: (346.02 -234.76)/(20) ≈111.26/20=5.563.

55 to120: (729.92 -346.02)/65 ≈383.9/65 ≈5.922. Hmm, not a consistent slope. The slopes are increasing, which suggests that 1/[A] is not linear with time. So the reaction isn't second-order in this case, because that would require a linear plot.

Hmm, maybe it's not a second-order reaction in [A]. Let's think about the rate law.

Another approach is to think about the data and see what the rate could be. The rate of the reaction is the change in concentration of either reactant per time. Let me look at the data.

At each time, the [OH^-] is decreasing. Let me compute the rate for each time interval. Since the reaction is between OH^- and the carboxylic acid, the rate would be determined by the disappearance of either reactant.

Assuming the rate is first-order in both reactants, the rate would be k[CH3COOCH2CH3][OH^-]. Let's see whether the rate is proportional to the product.

At each time step, the ratio of the change in [CH3COOCH2CH3] to [OH^-] would be the same if the reaction is first-order in each.

Let's compute the rate for each time interval as (change in concentration) = -d[CH3COOCH2CH3]/dt = +d[OH^-]/dt.

Wait, but if the reaction is first order in each, then the rates should be equal. Let me compute the changes in the concentrations.

Time 0 to5 min:

[CH3COOCH2CH3] changes from 0.02000 to 0.0128 → delta = -0.007200. So the rate would be -0.007200 /5 = -0.00144 M/min.

[OH^-] changes from 0.02000 to 0.0128 → delta = -0.007200. So rate is -0.007200/5= -0.00144 M/min.

Same rate value.

Next time step (5-15 min):

[CH3COOCH2CH3] goes from 0.0128 to 0.00766 → delta = -0.00514. Rate = -0.00514/10 = -0.000514 M/min.

[OH^-] goes from 0.0128 to 0.00766 → delta = -0.00514. Rate = -0.00514/10= -0.000514 M/min.

Same rate again.

Next step (15-25 min):

[CH3COOCH2CH3] goes from 0.00766 to 0.00540 → delta = -0.00226. Rate = -0.00226/10= -0.000226 M/min.

[OH^-] goes from 0.00766 to 0.00540 → delta = -0.00226. Rate = -0.00226/10= -0.000226 M/min.

Same again.

Next step (25-35 min):

[CH3COOCH2CH3] goes from 0.00540 to 0.00426 → delta = -0.00114. Rate = -0.00114/10= -0.000114 M/min.

[OH^-] from 0.00540 to 0.00426 → delta same. Rate same.

Same.

Next step (35-55 min):

[CH3COOCH2CH3] goes from 0.00426 to 0.00289 → delta = -0.00137. Rate = -0.00137/20= -0.0000685 M/min.

[OH^-] from 0.00426 to 0.00289 → delta same. Rate same.

Same.

Last step (55-120 min):

[CH3COOCH2CH3] from 0.00289 → 0.00137 → delta = -0.00152. Rate = -0.00152 /65 ≈ -0.0000234 M/min.

[OH^-] from 0.00289 → 0.00137 → delta same. Rate same.

So, each time step, the change in [CH3COOCH2CH3] and [OH^-] is the same. Thus, the rate of disappearance of each is the same. So the rate is proportional to [CH3COOCH2CH3][OH^-].

So the rate law would be rate = k [CH3COOCH2CH3][OH^-].

Looking at the options, option B is rate = k[OH^-]^2. Option A is second order, and the rate law is option B.

Wait, but wait, when the reaction is first order in each, then the rate is k[CH3COOCH2CH3][OH^-], which matches option B.

So, the rate law is B: second order, rate = k[OH^-]^2.

Wait, wait, no. Because in our data, the rate is same for each time step and is proportional to the product of [CH3COOCH2CH3] and [OH^-]. So the rate is first order in each, so it's second order overall.

So, the rate law is rate = k [CH3COOCH2CH3][OH^-].

Looking at the options, option B says that.

So the answer is option B.
</think>

To determine the order of the reaction and write the rate law expression, we analyze the data provided for the reaction:

**Reaction:** OH⁻ + CH₃COOCH₂CH₃ → CH₃COO⁻ + CH₃CH₂OH  
**Data:**  
Time (min) | [CH₃COOCH₂CH₃] | [OH⁻]  
0.0     | 0.02000        | 0.02000  
5.0     | 0.01280         | 0.01280  
15.0     | 0.00766         | 0.00766  
25.0     | 0.00540         | 0.00540  
35.0     | 0.00426         | 0.00426  
55.0     | 0.00289         | 0.00289  
120.0    | 0.00137         | 0.00137  

---

### **Step 1: Determine the order of the reaction**
To determine the order of the reaction, we analyze the data for the disappearance of the reactants. The rate of the reaction is given by:

\[
\text{Rate} = -\frac{\Delta[\text{Reactant}]}{\Delta t}
\]

We calculate the change in concentration of [CH₃COOCH₂CH₃] and [OH⁻] for each time interval and observe that the rate of disappearance of both reactants is the same at each time step. This indicates that the reaction is first-order in both reactants.

---

### **Step 2: Write the rate law expression**
Since the reaction is first-order in both [CH₃COOCH₂CH₃] and [OH⁻], the rate law expression is:

\[
\text{Rate} = k [\text{CH₃COOCH₂CH₃}][\text{OH⁻}]
\]

---

### **Step 3: Match the rate law with the options**
The rate law derived above matches **Option B**, which states:

**Option B:** Second-order, rate = \( k[\text{OH⁻}]^2 \)

---

### **Conclusion**
The reaction is first-order in both reactants, and the rate law expression is:

\[
\text{Rate} = k [\text{CH₃COOCH₂CH₃}][\text{OH⁻}]
\]

This matches **Option B**.
