Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the principles dealing with values. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which two principles address value questions, and the options are various combinations of fields.

First, I remember from school that values are important in many areas, like ethics and religion. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact combination. Let me think about each option.

Option A: faith and science. I'm not sure how these two relate. Science deals with objective truths, while faith is subjective. Do they address values? Maybe not directly.

Option B: faith and legal. Legal is about rules and laws, which might relate to values indirectly, like moral codes. But faith is still more about personal beliefs, not sure how it's connected to legal principles.

Option C: religion and science. Both are about understanding the world, but the question is about values. I know religion and ethics are connected because they deal with moral values, but does science tie in? Or is it that both are about values, but perhaps not the same ones.

Option D: religion and ethics. That sounds like a good pair. Religion provides moral frameworks (values), and ethics is the study of those values. I think this combination is pretty well-known.

Option E: legal and ethics. Legal is about rules, but ethics deals with the behavior that should be expected. They might both relate to values, but I'm not certain if they're separate.

Option F: science and legal. These are both about knowledge and rules, but the question is about values, not necessarily about how they're applied.

Option G: faith and religion. These are both about belief systems, not necessarily about values. Not sure how they'd address value questions.

Option H: legal and religion. Legal deals with rules, religion with moral principles. They might relate but not directly address the same value issues.

Option I: ethics and science. Both are about understanding behavior and nature. But I think ethics is more about the right and wrong, while science is about knowledge. So they might not directly address value questions.

Option J: Not listed here. Wait, the options go up to I, so J isn't an option.

So, the question asks which two principles deal with questions of values. I think the correct answer is D: religion and ethics. Because religion provides the moral framework, and ethics is the study of those values. Alternatively, I remember that in other contexts, science and ethics are related, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, another thought: science deals with facts and the natural world, but ethics is about the values derived from those facts. So, if someone is concerned with value, science might not directly address it, but ethics would. So, does that mean science and ethics are related but not the same as religion and ethics?

Alternatively, my initial thought was that D is correct because religion provides the moral basis, and ethics is the study of that. So, the two principles are religion and ethics.

But I'm a bit confused because I think science and ethics are both important, but the question is about which two principles. Another angle: perhaps science and legal are both about rules. For example, legal systems impose rules, and science also enforces certain rules through experiments. However, the question is about values, not about the enforcement of rules.

Wait, the question is about principles that deal with questions of values. So, principles that define or guide values. That would include things like religion, which provides moral guidelines, and ethics, which is the study of such principles. So, the two principles would be religion and ethics.

Alternatively, I've heard that science and ethics are both important, but I'm not sure if that's one of the answer options.

Looking back at the options, H is legal and religion, which I don't think is correct. D is more accurate because it's specifically about the moral frameworks provided by religion and the study of those principles.

So, the answer should be D: religion and ethics.

The correct answer is D: religion and ethics. 

**Explanation:** Religions provide moral frameworks (values) and ethics is the study of these principles. This combination addresses value questions effectively. Other options either relate to different fields like science and legal, which are more about knowledge and rule enforcement rather than the study of values.
