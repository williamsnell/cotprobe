The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?

Options:

A: Topical antibiotic ointment
B: Radiation therapy
C: Antifungal treatment
D: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
E: Corticosteroid cream application
F: Use of wet to dry dressings
G: Surgical debridement
H: Frequent turning
I: Cryotherapy
J: Whirlpool therapy

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this multiple-choice question about a patient's skin lesion. Let's see, the patient is 65 years old with multiple sclerosis, so he's quite old and might have some systemic issues. He's hospitalized because of left lower lobe pneumonia. His vitals are a bit concerning too—temperature is 38.1°C (which is pretty high, but maybe normal in this context), pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 12/min. Blood pressure is 120/80, which I think is within the normal range, but I'm not sure.

He's malnourished, which probably means he's not getting enough nutrients, maybe from a lack of nutrition or deficiencies. The exam shows rhonchi at the left lower lobe on the lungs, so that's a lung lesion. But let's focus on the skin part. The heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities are normal, so no heart issues, no tumors, nothing obvious in the lymph system. The neurologic exam shows quadriparesis, which is a lot of weakness, like four limbs. That's concerning because quadriparesis can be due to a variety of causes, including infections or muscle atrophy.

The stool test for occult blood is negative, so no gastrointestinal bleeding. The area being erythema is a 1 cm area over the sacrum with skin and no induration. S typically refers to sacral abscess, like a sacral abscess. Sacral abscesses are a common cause of low-grade meningitis or abscesses from infections, such as larynx, or maybe a different underlying disease.

Now, the question is about the most effective intervention. Let's look at the options:

A: Topical antibiotic ointment — That's used for infections, but the patient has a sacral abscess. I think ointments can help, but maybe not the primary treatment for abscesses.

B: Radiation therapy — Not for abscesses. Radiation is for tumors.

C: Antifungal treatment — Maybe, but antibiotics are more commonly used for abscesses.

D: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy — Broad-spectrum means it targets multiple bacterial and fungal pathogens. Broad-spectrum is good because it can treat a wide range of infections, including abscesses. But I'm not sure if it's the most direct approach.

E: Corticosteroid cream — That's for inflammation, like in a fungal infection or maybe a wound healing. Not directly for abscesses.

F: Use of wet to dry dressings — That's for abscess management, using something that helps absorb the fluid, but not the actual treatment.

G: Surgical debridement — That would remove the entire abscess, which seems like the most effective for a serious abscess like a sacral abscess caused by an infection. It would prevent the infection from spreading.

H: Frequent turning — Turning is a method to remove abscesses, but it's not a treatment. It's more of a management step.

I: Cryotherapy — That's used for certain infections, like in infections of the lungs, but again, not for abscesses.

J: Whirlpool therapy — Not a common term in the context of skin lesions; it's more about treating certain skin conditions, but I'm not sure of its application here.

So, considering all, the most effective intervention would be surgical removal of the sacral abscess. That would be option G.

The most effective intervention for the patient's sacral abscess is surgical debridement. This is the most direct and appropriate treatment for a serious abscess caused by an infection, given the patient's condition and the urgency of the situation.

**Answer: G: Surgical debridement**
