Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Williams's property tax. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Let's see.

The problem says Mr. Williams owns a property assessed at $7,800. The city has a tax rate of $2.80 per $100. I need to find out how much property taxes he pays.

Hmm, I remember that tax rates are usually based on the assessed value, which is the value of the property. So the idea is to calculate how much tax is based on that amount.

Wait, the tax rate is $2.80 per $100. So for every $100 of the property's value, the tax is $2.80. So I need to find out how many $100 units are in $7,800, and then multiply each by $2.80.

Let me break it down. First, how many hundreds are in $7,800? Well, 7,800 divided by 100 is 78. So there are 78 units of $100.

Each of these units is taxed at $2.80. So 78 multiplied by 2.80 should give the total tax.

Let me do the multiplication. 78 * 2.80. Hmm, calculating that: 70*2.80 is 196, and 8*2.80 is 22.40. Adding those together gives 196 + 22.40 = 218.40.

So the total property tax would be $218.40. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option A is $218.40, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake in the math. Alternatively, I can compute 7800 / 100 = 78, then 78 * 2.80.

Another way: 2.80 * 78. Let's see, 2*78 is 156, 0.80*78 is 62.4. Adding 156 and 62.4 gives 218.4. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be option A, $218.40.

The correct answer is A.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Tax Rate:** The tax rate is $2.80 per $100 of assessed property value.

2. **Calculate Number of $100 Units:** 
   - The assessed value is $7,800.
   - Number of $100 units = $7,800 / $100 = 78.

3. **Compute Total Property Tax:**
   - Total tax = 78 units * $2.80/unit = $218.40.

4. **Match with Options:** The calculated $218.40 corresponds to option A.

Answer: A: $218.40
