Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about the particle's kinetic energy and the force acting on it. 

Wait, I remember that kinetic energy is related to the velocity and mass of an object. Oh right, the formula for kinetic energy is KE = ½ mv². But wait, the question is about the rate at which the kinetic energy is changing. Oh, right! The rate of change of kinetic energy with respect to time is the power. And power is given by the dot product of force and velocity vectors. So Power P = F · v.

But wait, the problem states that the kinetic energy is changing at a rate of –6.0 J/s. So that means the power is negative. Wait, power can be positive or negative depending on the direction of the force relative to the velocity. But wait, the question is about the magnitude of the force. So maybe I don't need to worry about the sign here, just the magnitude.

Wait, let me think about units. The kinetic energy's rate is in J/s, which is the same as watts (W) because 1 W = 1 J/s. So the power is -6 W. But for the magnitude, maybe I can ignore the sign. Or perhaps the negative sign indicates the direction of the force relative to the velocity.

Wait, but the question is asking for the magnitude of the force. So the negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude is just the number. But wait, in the equation, the power is F dot v. So, F × v × cos(theta), where theta is the angle between force and velocity vectors.

Wait, but when the kinetic energy is decreasing (negative power), that might mean that the force is opposite to the velocity. Because if the force and velocity are in opposite directions, the work done (which is power) is negative. So, F and v are opposite, so cos(theta) is -1. So the power is F * v * (-1).

But wait, let me make it clear. The rate of change of kinetic energy (dKE/dt) is equal to the power, which is F · v. So dKE/dt = F · v.

So, F · v = dKE/dt.

Given dKE/dt is -6 J/s. So F · v = -6.

But to find F, I need to know the value of velocity, which is given as 3.0 m/s.

Wait, but I don't know the mass of the particle. Hmm, the problem doesn't give the mass. Oh wait, maybe I can find the mass from the given kinetic energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy is given as changing at a rate of -6.0 J/s, but without knowing the mass, I can't directly calculate F. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives only the rate of change of kinetic energy, and the speed. Without mass, how can I find F? Oh wait, perhaps the mass isn't needed because the kinetic energy is a function of velocity only, and no information about mass is given. But that would seem odd. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating. Let's think about the equation again. The power is F multiplied by velocity. So, F = Power / v.

Wait, but wait, no. Because F · v is Power. So F times v times cos(theta) equals Power. But if I don't know theta, that's an issue. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity is in the direction of the force. Let's assume for now that the force is acting in the same direction as velocity. Then cos(theta) is 1. So F = Power / v.

Wait, but if that's the case, then F would be (-6 J/s) / (3 m/s) )= -2 N. But the problem asks for the magnitude, so 2 N. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, that's if the force is in the same direction as the velocity. But what if the force is in the opposite direction? Then cos(theta) would be -1, so F would be (-6)/(3 * (-1))= 2 N. Either way, the magnitude is 2 N. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought the power was F v cos(theta). So let's be precise.

The given data: dKE/dt = -6 J/s (so power is -6 W). The velocity is 3 m/s. We don't know the mass, but perhaps the mass is not needed because the problem gives the rate of change of KE and velocity, and asks for the magnitude of the force. So perhaps we can find the force from the relation dKE/dt = F v.

Wait, but wait, no, the correct equation is dKE/dt = F · v. So F · v = -6.

But without knowing the angle between F and v, I can't find F. So perhaps the problem assumes that F is in the same direction as v. But that's a big assumption, and it's not stated. Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the force is in the opposite direction, leading to a different calculation.

Wait, wait, another approach: Let's compute the kinetic energy first. KE = ½ m v². But without knowing m, how can we proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the magnitude. Let me re-examine the question. No, the question gives the rate of change of KE and velocity, which is 3 m/s. But without m, I can't calculate F. Unless the mass is not needed because we can express F in terms of the given variables.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct. The problem gives dKE/dt = -6 W, and velocity v =3 m/s. We can calculate F as F = |dKE/dt| / v, but that's only if the force and velocity are in the same direction. Because if they are in opposite directions, then F would be negative.

But wait no, the given dKE/dt is negative, which indicates that the power is negative, so the force and velocity are in opposite directions. So F is negative, but magnitude is |dKE/dt|/v. So | -6 | /3 = 2 N.

So the magnitude would be 2 N, which is option C.

So the answer should be option C, 2.0 N.

To determine the magnitude of the force on the particle, we start by noting that the rate of change of kinetic energy with respect to time is given as **-6.0 J/s**, which corresponds to the power \( P = -6.0 \, \text{W} \). The power is also expressed as \( P = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} \), where \( \mathbf{F} \) is the force and \( \mathbf{v} \) is the velocity. The dot product \( \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} \) equals \( F v \cos \theta \), where \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and velocity vectors.

The problem provides the velocity \( v = 3.0 \, \text{m/s} \), but it does not explicitly state the direction of the force relative to the velocity. However, the negative sign in the power indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction to the velocity (\( \cos \theta = -1 \)). The magnitude of the force can be approximated by the formula:

\[
F = \frac{|P|}{v}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
F = \frac{|-6.0|}{3.0} = \frac{6.0}{3.0} = 2.0 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the force is \( 2.0 \, \text{N} \), corresponding to option C.
