Okay, so I've got this photography question about camera objectives and f-number. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says the camera has a 50 mm focal length, and the aperture stop is f/4. Then, the camera is focused on an object that's 20 cm away. I need to find the effective f-number. Hmm, I remember that the f-number is related to the aperture and the focal length.

Wait, the formula for f-number is f/(aperture stop size). So if I know the f-number, I can find the aperture. But here, the question is about the f-number of the camera, which is the f-number of the lens, not the aperture. Oh right, because the aperture stop is just a part of the lens.

So, the effective f-number in photography is calculated as f/(f-number). Wait, no, wait. The f-number is f/(aperture), so the effective f-number is the same as the f-number of the lens. Wait, no, wait again. The f-number is f divided by the aperture size. So effective f-number is f/(aperture). But the question is asking for the f-number of the lens, which is f divided by the aperture diameter.

Wait, okay, the given is the f-number of the aperture stop, which is 4. The focal length is 50 mm. So the f-number is 50/4 = 12.5 mm. But wait, the question is about the effective f-number of the camera. So, the formula for the effective f-number is the same as the lens's f-number, right? Because the lens has a certain f-number, and that's what's used for focusing.

Wait, no, the effective f-number is the same as the f-number of the lens. Because the f-number is f-number = f / aperture. So if the aperture is 4 mm (since f/4), then the f-number is 50mm /4mm = 12.5. But wait, the question is asking for the effective f-number, which is the same as the lens's f-number. So why are the options numbers like 5.0, 3.8, etc.?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think again. The effective aperture is the diffraction-limited aperture, which is given by the formula A = λ * sqrt(2) / (π * f) * (1/stop), but wait, I think I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, the effective aperture (effective f-number) is the same as the lens's f-number. So if the lens has a 4 mm aperture, the effective f-number is 50mm /4mm = 12.5.

Wait, but the options don't have 12.5. So I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the question. Oh, wait, the question is about the effective f-number of the camera, which would be the lens's f-number. So if the f/4 is the aperture, then the effective f-number is 12.5. But the options are way lower than that. I'm confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Wait, another approach: effective f-number is the same as the f-number of the lens. So the lens's f-number is f divided by the aperture diameter. So the given is the aperture stop's f/4, which is 4 mm. So f_number = 50mm / 4mm = 12.5. But that's not any of the options. So I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, the question says the camera is set to f/4. So the aperture diameter is 50mm * (1/4) = 12.5 mm. Then, the object is at 20 cm, which is 200 mm. So the question is about the effective f-number, which is the same as the lens's f-number. So f_number = 50mm / 12.5mm = 4. So the effective f-number is 4.0. That's one of the options, option C.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the effective f-number is calculated from the lens's f-number, which is based on the aperture. The object distance is 20 cm, which is 200 mm, but that doesn't affect the f-number directly in this context. The f-number is determined by the lens's aperture and focal length.

So the f-number is 50 mm / 12.5 mm = 4.0. So the answer is C, 4.0.
</think>

To determine the effective f-number of the camera, we start by noting that the f-number (f/stop) is calculated as the focal length divided by the aperture diameter. The given focal length is 50 mm, and the aperture stop is f/4, meaning the aperture diameter is 50 mm / 4 = 12.5 mm. 

The effective f-number of the lens is then calculated as:

\[
\text{Effective f-number} = \frac{\text{Focal length}}{\text{Aperture diameter}} = \frac{50 \, \text{mm}}{12.5 \, \text{mm}} = 4.0
\]

The object distance (20 cm or 200 mm) does not directly affect the calculation of the f-number in this context. Therefore, the effective f-number of the camera is 4.0.
