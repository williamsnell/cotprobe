Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the net dipole moment in Debye units for two different scenarios. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question has two parts, (a) and (b). Both involve two ions with opposite charges separated by a certain distance. The given values are in esu units and cm. I remember that dipole moment is calculated using the formula μ = q * d, where q is the charge and d is the distance between them.

Wait, but the distance given is in centimeters. Oh right, because the formula uses the distance in centimeters. Also, the charges are given in esu units. I think 1 Debye is equal to 1e-18 esu-cm. So I'll need to convert the dipole moment from esu-cm to Debye by dividing by 1e-18. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for dipole moment μ is in esu-cm, and 1 Debye is 1e-18 esu cm. So, the dipole moment in Debye would be μ (esu cm) divided by 1e-18 to get Debye.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. Oh, right, because 1 Debye is 1e-18 esu cm. So when you calculate μ in esu cm, you divide by 1e-18 to get Debye. So for each part, I'll calculate the dipole moment in esu cm, then convert to Debye by dividing by 1e-18.

Let's look at part (a): one +1 and one -1 ion, separated by 2e-8 cm.

So q is 1 e.su for each ion? Wait, but wait. The charges are +1 and -1. So each ion has a charge of +1 e.su and -1 e.su. So the dipole moment μ is q * d. The charges are 1 and 1e-10 esu each? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the given is one charge as 4.80e-10 esu? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question states "One charge = 4.80 × 10^-10 esu and 1 Debye = 1 × 10^-18 esu-cm."

Wait, so the first situation is when the charges are 4.80e-10 esu each. Because in the first part (a), the charges are +1 and -1, but wait, maybe the charges are given as 4.80e-10 esu each? Or perhaps the charges are 4.80e-10 and -4.80e-10? Because the problem says "one +1 and one -1 ion." Wait, but the units for charge are given in esu. So wait, if the first situation has charges of +1 and -1, that's 1 and 1. But the problem says "One charge = 4.80 ×10^-10 esu." Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I read the problem wrong.

Wait, let me re-read the question. Oh, wait, the question says: "One charge = 4.80 × 10^-10 esu and 1 Debye = 1 × 10^-18 esu-cm." Oh, so the charge given is 4.80e-10 esu. So each ion has a charge of 4.80e-10 esu? So that means for part (a), the charges are +4.8e-10 esu and -4.8e-10 esu. Wait, because the problem in (a) says one +1 and one -1 ion? Or is the given charge 4.8e-10 esu? Wait, the first part says: One charge = 4.80 ×10^-10 esu and 1 Debye = 1 ×10^-18 esu cm. So the charges are 4.8e-10 and -4.8e-10? Or is the charge given as 1 and -1?

Wait, I'm getting confused now. Let me look again.

The question says: "One charge = 4.80 × 10^-10 esu and 1 Debye = 1 × 10^-18 esu-cm." So perhaps each ion has a charge of ±4.80e-10 esu. So for part (a), the charges are +4.8e-10 and -4.8e-10. The separation is 2e-8 cm.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in part (a), the question says the first situation is "One +1 and one -1 ion separated by 2e-8 cm." But the charges are given in esu. Oh wait, no, wait, the question's actual first part (a) says: "One charge = 4.80 × 10^-10 esu and 1 Debye...". So each ion's charge is 4.8e-10 esu. So for part (a), the charge is +4.8e-10 and -4.8e-10. So the dipole moment μ is q * d, where q is 4.8e-10 * 2e-8 cm.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, maybe I should think of the charges as 1 and -1, but that contradicts the given charge. Or wait, perhaps the charges are given as ±4.8e-10 esu. Because the first situation says one charge is 4.80e-10 esu, and the other is -4.80e-10. So when you calculate the dipole moment, it's μ = q * d, but q is the magnitude of each charge, so 4.8e-10 esu for each ion.

Wait, but the question says in part (a) that the charges are +1 and -1, but the charge given is 4.8e-10. So I think the problem is that the given charge is 4.8e-10 esu, so each ion has a charge of 4.8e-10 esu and the other is -4.8e-10? Because the first part says "One charge = 4.80 ×10^-10 esu." So that seems to be the charge of each.

So for part (a), the charge is ±4.8e-10 esu, and the separation is 2e-8 cm. So dipole moment μ = (4.8e-10) esu * 2e-8 cm = 9.6e-18 esu cm.

Wait, but since 1 Debye is 1e-18 esu cm, so 9.6e-18 esu cm is 9.6 Debye.

Wait, but wait, no! Because dipole moment is μ = q * d. So q is 4.8e-10 esu, d is 2e-8 cm. So μ is (4.8e-10) * (2e-8) = 9.6e-18 esu cm. To convert to Debye, we divide by 1e-18, so 9.6 Debye. So part (a) is 9.6 Debye.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 9.6 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 10.8, 21.6

B:10.2,20.4

C:8.6,17.2

D:8.0,16.0

E:7.2,14.4

F:9.1,18.2

G:11.0,22.0

H:9.6,19.2

I:12.4,24.8

J:7.8,15.6

Wait, option H says 9.6 Debye and 19.2. So for part (a), the dipole moment is 9.6 Debye, which would match option H.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because dipole moment is q*d. But wait, does the formula use the distance between the charges, which is the distance, or is there a factor I'm missing?

Wait, another thought: Oh wait, the formula for dipole moment is μ = q * d, where d is the distance between the two charges. So yes, that's correct.

So for part (a), 4.8e-10 * 2e-8 = 9.6e-18 esu cm. Divided by 1e-18 gives 9.6 Debye.

So part (a) is 9.6 Debye.

Now part (b): one +2 and one -2 ion, separated by 2e-8 cm.

So here, each ion has a charge of +2 and -2, so q is 2e-8 esu each? Wait no, wait, the charge is 2e-8 esu each? Or is it 2e-8 in esu? Wait, 4.8e-10 is 4.8e-10 esu, so 2 would be 2e-8 esu. So each ion has a charge of 2e-8 esu.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first part says the charges are 4.8e-10, and the second part says 2. So in part (b), the charges are +2 and -2, so q is 2e-8 esu each.

Wait, no, wait. Because the charge is 4.8e-10 in the first part, so in the second part, the charge is the same, but multiplied by 2. So each ion has a charge of 2e-8 esu. Because 2 times 4.8e-10 is 9.6e-10, but wait, no that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the charge is given as 4.8e-10 esu, so for part (b), the charges are 2 times that, which is 9.6e-10 esu each. So the dipole moment would be μ = q * d = (9.6e-10) esu * 2e-8 cm.

Wait, wait, no, wait: the charge of each ion is 2 * (4.8e-10 esu) = 9.6e-10 esu each. So μ = 9.6e-10 * 2e-8 = 1.92e-17 esu cm.

Wait, 1.92e-17 is 0.192e-16? Wait, no, 1.92e-17 is 0.192e-16? No, 1e-17 is 0.1e-16, so 1.92e-17 is 0.192e-16? Hmm, maybe better to write it as 1.92e-17.

But wait, 1 Debye is 1e-18, so 1.92e-17 esu cm is 19.2e-18 esu cm, which is 19.2 Debye. Because 1.92e-17 esu cm = 19.2e-18 (since 1e-18 is 1e-18, so 1e-17 is 10e-18), so 1.92e-17 = 19.2e-18, which is 19.2 Debye.

Wait, but wait, let me compute:

μ = q * d = (4.8e-10 * 2) esu * (2e-8 cm) = 9.6e-10 * 2e-8 = 19.2e-18 esu cm.

19.2e-18 is 19.2 Debye. So part (b) is 19.2 Debye.

Wait, but hold on. Let me re-examine the first part.

In part (a), the charge is 4.8e-10 esu each, and the separation is 2e-8 cm. So μ = 4.8e-10 * 2e-8 = 9.6e-18 esu cm, which is 9.6 Debye. So that's part (a).

In part (b), the charge is 2 * 4.8e-10 = 9.6e-10 esu each. So μ = 9.6e-10 * 2e-8 = 19.2e-18 esu cm, which is 19.2 Debye.

Looking at the options, option H is (9.6, 19.2). So the correct answer would be option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is (9.6, 19.2), which matches our calculations.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes, the formula is μ = q * d, but sometimes I've seen it as μ = (q1 + q2) * d. But here, since the charges are opposite, it's a dipole, so the formula is correct as μ = q * d, where q is the charge of one ion and d is the distance between them.

So for part (a), 4.8e-10 * 2e-8 = 9.6e-18 esu cm → 9.6 Debye. For part (b), 9.6e-10 * 2e-8 = 1.92e-17 → 19.2 Debye.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So the correct answer is option H.

To calculate the net dipole moment in Debye units for the given situations, we use the formula:

\[
\mu = q \cdot d
\]

where \( q \) is the charge in esu and \( d \) is the distance between the charges in cm. The dipole moment is then converted to Debye units by dividing by \( 10^{-18} \, \text{esu-cm} \, / \text{Debye} \).

### Part (a): One \( +1 \) and one \( -1 \) ion separated by \( 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \)
- The charges are \( \pm 4.80 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{esu} \), as given.
- The distance between the ions is \( d = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \).
- The dipole moment is:

\[
\mu = q \cdot d = (4.80 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8}) = 9.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{esu-cm}.
\]

- Converting to Debye units:

\[
\mu = \frac{9.6 \times 10^{-18}}{10^{-18}} = 9.6 \, \text{Debye}.
\]

### Part (b): One \( +2 \) and one \( -2 \) ion separated by \( 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \)
- The charges are \( \pm 9.60 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{esu} \), as they are twice the given charge.
- The distance between the ions is \( d = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \).
- The dipole moment is:

\[
\mu = q \cdot d = (9.60 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8}) = 1.92 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{esu-cm}.
\]

- Converting to Debye units:

\[
\mu = \frac{1.92 \times 10^{-17}}{10^{-18}} = 19.2 \, \text{Debye}.
\]

### Final Answer
The net dipole moments are \( 9.6 \, \text{Debye} \) for part (a) and \( 19.2 \, \text{Debye} \) for part (b). This corresponds to **option H**.
