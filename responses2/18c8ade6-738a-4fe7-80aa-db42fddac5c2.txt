Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about consequentialist calculations and their flaws. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking what one flaw Hourdequin argues in his consequentialist calculation is. The options are A to J. I remember that consequentialism is a moral theory where actions are evaluated based on their outcomes, not the people themselves. So the idea is that the best action is one that leads to the most good for the greatest number.

Looking at the options:

A: It negates the notion that individuals are inherently self-interested. Wait, if consequentialism focuses on outcomes, why would it say individuals aren't self-interested? Because their self-interested nature is what makes them capable of acting in ways that lead to good outcomes. So A might be a flaw because it's saying individuals aren't self-interested, which doesn't make sense since their self-interested behavior is the basis of the calculation.

B: It can run counter to the idea that persons are atomistic and individually rational actors. Hmm. I'm not as familiar with this. Atomistic might mean treating each person separately, but individual rationality is about being good at their own decisions. Consequentialism seems to focus on collective outcomes, so maybe this is about how it fails to capture individual rationality. Or maybe it's not about atomistic but about not considering the collective aspects.

C: It overlooks the potential conflict between individual and collective interests. Yes, this rings a bell. Consequentialism says that an action's value is determined by its outcome, so if one person's gain affects the outcome negatively, that action is bad regardless of individual rationality. So this flaw is that it doesn't consider the conflict between individual and collective interests. So C seems like a correct point.

D: It can run counter to a person's being able to integrate her commitments at various levels. Hmm, not sure. I'm not as clear on this one.

E: It fails to reconcile prima facie duties. Wait, prima facie duties are about what's most urgent, but I'm not sure how that relates directly to the flaws in consequentialism. Or maybe this is about not considering the moral duties beyond outcomes, which is a different issue.

F: It doesn't consider the potential of individuals to act against their own self-interest. Oh, that seems like a direct flaw. If an action leads to personal harm even if it's the best outcome for the group, then the outcome is compromised. So F is another possible flaw.

Wait, the question is about one flaw, but there are multiple possible points. So I need to pick the best answer.

The question lists which is the flaw of the consequentialist calculation. I think that the most critical flaw is that it doesn't account for individual rationalityâ€”because individuals make decisions based on their own self-interest, and if their actions are part of a larger outcome where their own interests conflict, it can lead to bad outcomes. But I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Alternatively, the conflict between individual and collective interests is a clear flaw because consequences are based solely on the outcome, not on whether that outcome is in the collective best interest. So option C seems to be a correct flaw.

Another point is option F, which says it doesn't consider individuals acting against their own self-interest. So this is another strong point. However, the options don't have that as a choice. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

F: It doesn't consider the potential of individuals to act against their own self-interest.

So the question is about one flaw, so perhaps F is a correct answer. But wait, I thought that's part of the issue about the consistency of the calculation.

Wait, the question is about one flaw. So if I remember correctly, one of the main flaws is that consequentialism doesn't take into account the moral weight of individual interests or how their self-interest can affect collective outcomes. So option C: it overlooks the potential conflict between individual and collective interests.

Alternatively, option F is about individuals not integrating their commitments at various levels, but I'm not as sure about that.

Wait, the options:

A: individuals are inherently self-interested (incorrect, since self-interested is the basis)

B: atomistic and individually rational actors

C: conflict between individual and collective interests

D: integrates commitments at various levels

E: doesn't reconcile prima facie duties

F: doesn't consider acting against self-interest

G: importance of values

H: ignores social norms

I: best understood in relation to others

J: discredits moral autonomy

So the question is which is a flaw in the consequentialist calculation.

I think that the key flaw is that consequentialism focuses only on the outcome, not on whether that outcome is in the collective best interest or whether individuals are acting in self-interest. So if an outcome is good for the group but bad for an individual, the calculation doesn't consider that. So C is a flaw.

Alternatively, the other option is F, which refers to the potential for individuals to act against their own self-interest. That's a critical flaw because if an action leads to personal harm even if it's good for the group, the outcome is compromised. So the calculation would choose a worse outcome because the person's personal interest is not considered.

Wait, but which option is the most correct? The question is which one Hourdequin argues as a flaw.

I think that the most significant flaw is that it fails to account for the conflict between individual and collective interests. So Option C would be correct.

Wait, but another point is that the calculation doesn't consider the moral weight of individual actions. For example, if an individual's self-interest is more important than the collective outcome, their choice might not align with the group's best interest. So the calculation is flawed because it doesn't consider the moral weight of individual interests.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct because it's a flaw in the approach.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about one flaw.

The problem is that the consequences are based solely on the outcome, not on how that outcome affects individuals. So for example, if choosing option C, the calculation ignores whether the collective outcome is in the best interest of the group. If an action leads to a negative outcome for an individual but a positive for the group, the consequences are based only on the positive group outcome, ignoring the individual's self-interest. So that's a flaw.

Alternatively, F is about the potential for individuals to act against their own self-interest. For example, an individual might make a decision that leads to their own harm even if it's good for the group. The calculation would choose the outcome that's best for the group, but the individual might have a self-interested interest that's not considered.

So which is the correct answer?

The options:

C: it overlooks the potential conflict between individual and collective interests.

F: it doesn't consider the potential of individuals to act against their own self-interest.

Both could be correct, but the question is which is a flaw in the consequentialist calculation.

I think that the flaw is that the consequences are based on the outcome, not the individual's self-interest. So the calculation may choose an outcome that's good for the group but bad for an individual. So C is a problem because it ignores the possibility that the group's best outcome is not aligned with individual interests.

Alternatively, the problem is about the individual's potential to harm themselves despite the group's best interest. So F is another flaw.

Wait, I've heard that one of the main criticisms of consequentialism is the focus on individual outcomes and not on the collective. So option C would be correct.

Alternatively, another thought: Quine and other critics argue that consequences are based on individual actions, not collective, so they don't account for whether the outcome is good for all. So the outcome is based on the group's best interest, but that's not considered in the calculation.

Wait, the question is about one flaw. So which one is the correct answer?

I think the correct answer is F, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the correct answer is C.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall what I learned. I remember that one of the main flaws in consequentialism is that it doesn't take into account the moral weight of individual actions or how they contribute to the group's outcomes. That might be point C.

Alternatively, the issue is that consequences are based on the individual's self-interest, not the collective. So if an outcome is good for the group but bad for an individual, the consequences are wrong because it's not in the individual's best interest.

Wait, but that's more about individual self-interest than collective interests. So perhaps C is correct.

Wait, another angle: The question is about one flaw. Let's think of the options:

A: Incorrect, because individuals are inherently self-interested.

B: It's about atomistic actors and individual rationality. Not sure if this is a flaw.

C: Conflicts between individuals and collective interests. True.

D: I don't see a direct connection.

F: Individuals acting against their self-interest. True.

So I'm trying to remember. I think one of the main issues is that the calculation doesn't consider the possibility that an outcome might be good for the group but bad for an individual. So the calculation would choose an outcome that's good for the group, but that outcome might not be good for any individual. So the flaw is overlooked conflict between individual and collective interests.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question asks for the flaw in the consequentialist calculation, which focuses on outcomes rather than individual or collective interests. The analysis of the options reveals:

- **A**: Incorrect, as individuals are not inherently self-interested; their self-interest is the basis of the calculation.
- **B**: Not directly identified as a flaw.
- **C**: Correct, as it highlights the potential conflict between individual and collective interests, a critical flaw in consequentialism.
- **D**: Not directly relevant.
- **E**: Not directly connected.
- **F**: Correct as it identifies an issue with individuals acting against their self-interest, affecting collective outcomes.
- **G**: Not relevant.
- **H**: Not directly connected.
- **I**: Not directly relevant.
- **J**: Not directly connected.

Both **C** and **F** are valid flaws, but the question asks for one flaw. The primary issue of overlooked conflicts between individual and collective interests is a well-known flaw in consequentialism.
