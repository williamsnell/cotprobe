Okay, so I need to figure out which animal on Earth is the loudest. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the animals, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I know that loudness is measured in decibels, so the higher the decibel level, the louder it is. I've heard about some big animals that are known for their loud sounds. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Humpback whale. I think humpback whales are known for their song, which can be quite loud. I remember hearing that their songs can reach around 110 decibels, but I'm not sure if that's the highest.

Option B: African elephant. Elephants are big, but I'm not sure about their loudness. I think elephants can be pretty loud when they're active, but maybe not as loud as some other animals.

Option C: Peacock. Wait, peacocks are peacocks, so I'm not sure. Maybe they're not the loudest. Peacocks are like peacocks, but I don't think they're known for loud sounds. Maybe they're more about dancing.

Option D: Lion. Lions are big, but I don't think they're that loud. I've heard that their roar can be quite loud, maybe around 140-160 decibels, but that might be higher than what I'm thinking.

Option E: Blue whale. Blue whales are massive, but I'm not certain about their loudness. I think their songs can be really loud, but I'm not sure if it's the highest.

Option F: Sperm whale. Sperm whales are similar to blue whales, right? They are big and have big teeth, so their sounds would probably be even louder than blue whales.

Option G: Howler monkey. Howler monkeys are big, but I don't think they're that loud compared to other animals I know. They can sound loud, but maybe not as much as other mammals.

Option H: Tasmanian devil. I'm not aware of any loud sounds from Tasmanian devils. They're usually calm and don't make big noises.

Option I: bulldog bat. I'm not sure what a bulldog bat is. Maybe it's a typo for something else. If I'm wrong, I should consider this option as unlikely. But I think it's not a real animal, so probably not the answer.

Option J: Indian elephant. Indian elephants are quite big and known for their loudness. I think their song can reach up to 100 decibels, but I'm not sure if that's the highest.

Wait, I think I might have got it wrong. I've heard that the blue whale can actually be louder than some other big marine animals. But wait, the blue whale is larger and has bigger teeth, so their roar would be more powerful. Oh, but wait, the options don't include any other blue whale. The closest is the blue whale. But then again, maybe the howler monkey isn't loud.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Humpback whales have song that can go up to 110 dB, while blue whales can reach higher, maybe up to 140 dB. But I'm not sure if the blue whale is an option. Oh wait, the options don't have blue whale as an option here. The closest is option E (Blue whale) and option H (Tasmanian devil), which isn't loud.

Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me try to recall. The loudest animal on Earth is the blue whale, but the options don't have that. The next would be the howler monkey or perhaps the African elephant.

Wait, no, I think I'm wrong. Another thought: the blue whale has a song that can be up to 160 dB. But looking back at the options, the closest is E (Blue whale) and J (Indian elephant), which I think can reach up to 100 dB. So maybe the blue whale is the loudest, but since it's not an option, perhaps the next is the Indian elephant? But I think that's not as loud as the blue whale.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. I think the highest loudness is the blue whale, but since it's not an option, the next is the howler monkey, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the African elephant or the blue whale.

Wait, another approach: the options include several big mammals. The correct answer is probably the blue whale, but since the option is E, which is blue whale, but wait, the initial question's options don't include the blue whale. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Humpback whale

B: African elephant

C: peacock

D: lion

E: Blue whale

F: sperm whale

G: Howler monkey

H: Tasmanian devil

I: bulldog bat

J: Indian elephant

So, if the options include the blue whale (E), then the loudest would be E. But if not, then perhaps the next is the Indian elephant? Because I thought the Indian elephant is the largest, but I'm not sure about its loudness.

Wait, another thought. Oh, I think I remember that the blue whale is the loudest animal on Earth. So if the options include the blue whale as E, then that's the answer. But in the options given, E is blue whale, so the answer should be E. But wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the Indian elephant. Because I think the Indian elephant is the largest and can be quite loud, but the blue whale is bigger and might be even louder.

Wait, let me think again. The blue whale is larger and can produce sounds up to 160 dB, which is higher than any other mammal I know. So if the options include the blue whale, that's the answer. But if the options don't include it, then perhaps the next is the Indian elephant.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. I think the blue whale is the loudest. So if E is an option, then E is the answer. But looking back at the options, E is blue whale. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but another thought: the correct answer is the Indian elephant. Because I think the Indian elephant can be much louder than the blue whale? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The blue whale is the biggest. So, for example, the blue whale's song is about 160 dB, which is higher than any other mammal I can think of. So if E is the option, then E is the answer.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Let me think again. I'm a bit confused because I think the blue whale is the largest and the highest, so it should be the answer. So, if the options include E, then E is correct. Otherwise, perhaps the Indian elephant.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the facts. Let me check online in my mind. Oh wait, I don't have access to the internet. I'll have to rely on what I remember.

I think the blue whale is the largest and the highest, so if E is an option, then E is the answer. But perhaps the actual correct answer is the Indian elephant. I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the "last character of your response must be the letter you've chosen." So the answer is either E or another option. But wait, no, the options are A to J, and the answer is one of them.

Wait, if I'm correct that the blue whale is the highest, then E is the answer. So I'll go with E.

The correct answer is E: Blue whale, as it is known for producing one of the highest loud sounds on Earth, reaching up to 160 decibels. 

Answer: E
