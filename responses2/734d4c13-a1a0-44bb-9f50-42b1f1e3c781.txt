Okay, so I've got this question about electromagnetic waves and I need to figure out which option doesn't belong. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question lists options A through I, each representing a different type of electromagnetic wave. The options are: Sound, Ultraviolet waves, Infrared waves, Microwaves, X-rays, Gamma rays, Light, Heat waves, Radio waves. I need to find which one doesn't fit into the category of electromagnetic waves.

First, I remember that electromagnetic waves are a broad category that includes all types of waves that can cause electric and magnetic fields to propagate. They include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These are all part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A is Sound. Wait, sound is a type of mechanical wave, right? It travels through a medium, like air or water, and it's produced by vibrations. But electromagnetic waves are supposed to be purely electromagnetic without a medium. So sound is different from electromagnetic waves. Does that mean Sound doesn't belong? But wait, sometimes I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Are sound waves considered electromagnetic waves? I think they're not. Because sound is a wave that relies on a medium for propagation. So Sound would be outside the electromagnetic wave family.

Option B is Ultraviolet waves. I know that's part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It's higher energy than visible light, so yes, it's an electromagnetic wave.

Option C is Infrared waves. Definitely part of the EM spectrum. It's in the infrared range, so it's an EM wave.

Option D is Microwaves. Yes, microwaves are a type of EM wave. They're used in things like ovens and communication.

Option E is X-rays. X-rays are definitely part of the EM spectrum. They have higher energy than gamma rays and lower than visible light.

Option F is Gamma rays. Yes, gamma rays are in the EM spectrum. They're the highest energy type beyond X-rays.

Option G is Light. Light is the most common type of EM wave and definitely part of the category.

Option H is Heat waves. Wait, heat waves are related to thermal radiation, right? They involve the emission of electromagnetic waves, but are they considered as part of the EM family? Hmm. Heat radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, so in a way, heat waves are part of EM waves. But wait, in everyday terms, heat can be a phenomenon that's different. But in the context of electromagnetic waves, it's part of the EM category. So maybe this is a trick option.

Wait, but the question is about which does NOT belong. If I'm considering that heat is a form of electromagnetic radiation, then it's part of the family. So H might not be the answer.

Option I is Radio waves. Yep, radio waves are part of the EM spectrum as well. They're used for communication, etc.

Wait, but going back to option H, I think I'm mixing things up. In some contexts, heat can refer to the radiation emitted by an object, which is electromagnetic. So in that sense, heat waves would be part of EM waves. So would option H belong? Or is it a trick?

Wait, but the question is which does NOT belong. So if all the other options are in EM waves, except one, then that would be the answer.

Wait, so let me recheck. The options are A to I. The correct answer is one of them.

Let me think about each again:

A: Sound → No, because it's mechanical, not electromagnetic.
B: UV → Yes, EM.
C: Infrared → Yes.
D: Microwaves → Yes.
E: X-rays → Yes.
F: Gamma → Yes.
G: Light → Yes.
H: Heat → Hmm. Could be a trick. But in terms of the EM family, heat is part of EM because it's electromagnetic radiation. So H would belong.
I: Radio → Yes.

So all except A (Sound) belong to EM waves. Wait, no. Because the question says which does NOT belong. So the correct answer is A: Sound, because it's not an electromagnetic wave.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because I remember that sometimes people might not consider sound as electromagnetic. But according to the standard electromagnetic spectrum, sound isn't. So in this context, Sound is the odd one out.

Alternatively, for some reason, maybe the answer is not A but H. Let me think about the other options. 

Option H: Heat waves. Heat waves are related to thermal radiation, which is part of EM. So H would be in EM. So H doesn't fit.

Wait, but the question is which does NOT belong. So the one that's not part of EM. The options are:

Sound is the only non-EM.

So the answer should be A: Sound.

The question asks which of the given options does NOT belong in the family of electromagnetic waves. To determine the correct answer, it's important to evaluate each option based on whether it is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

- **A: Sound**  
  Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium for propagation and is not part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  
- **B: Ultraviolet waves**  
  Ultraviolet is a type of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than visible light and is part of the spectrum.  
- **C: Infrared waves**  
  Infrared falls in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum and is part of it.  
- **D: Microwaves**  
  Microwaves are electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the microwave range and are part of the spectrum.  
- **E: X-rays**  
  X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than gamma rays and are part of the spectrum.  
- **F: Gamma rays**  
  Gamma rays are the highest-energy form of electromagnetic radiation and are part of the spectrum.  
- **G: Light**  
  Light is the most common form of electromagnetic radiation and is part of the spectrum.  
- **H: Heat waves**  
  Heat waves refer to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  
- **I: Radio waves**  
  Radio waves are electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the radio range and are part of the spectrum.

After evaluating all options, **A: Sound** is the only option that does not belong to the family of electromagnetic waves. Sound is a mechanical wave, not electromagnetic, and is not part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
