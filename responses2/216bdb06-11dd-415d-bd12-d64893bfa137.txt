Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the highest power of 3 that divides this big number N. N is formed by writing all the two-digit integers from 19 to 92 one after another. So N starts with 19, then 20, 21, all the way up to 92. That's a pretty long number, but I don't need to write it all out. Instead, I can think about the properties of numbers and divisibility rules for 3.

I remember that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. And for higher powers like 9, the sum of the digits has to be divisible by 9. So maybe I can find the sum of all the digits of N and then see how many times 3 divides that sum.

But wait, how do I calculate the sum of all the digits without having to actually write out each number? Hmm, perhaps I can break it down by considering each two-digit number and how their digits contribute to the total sum.

Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. So for each number from 19 to 92, I can think of it as 10a + b, where a is the tens digit and b is the units digit. The sum of the digits for each number is a + b. So the total sum S of all digits in N is the sum of (a + b) for each number from 19 to 92.

Alternatively, I can separate the sum into the sum of the tens digits and the sum of the units digits. So S = (sum of a's) + (sum of b's).

First, let me find how many numbers there are. Starting from 19 to 92, inclusive. So that's (92 - 19) + 1 = 74 numbers. Each number is two digits, so each contributes two digits, but when they're concatenated, each a is a digit and each b is a digit. So the total number of digits in N is 74 * 2 = 148 digits.

Wait, actually, when you write them consecutively, each two-digit number adds two digits, so yes, 74 numbers contribute 148 digits. So the total number of digits is 148.

But to find the sum of all digits, I need to compute the sum of the tens digits and the sum of the units digits separately.

So first, let's find the sum of the tens digits. The tens digit in each number ranges from 1 (for 19) to 9 (for 92). Let's figure out how many times each tens digit appears.

Looking at the numbers from 19 to 92:

- Numbers with tens digit 1: 19 to 19. So only 19. That's 1 number.
- Tens digit 2: 20 to 29. That's 10 numbers.
- Tens digit 3: 30 to 39. 10 numbers.
- Similarly, up to tens digit 9: 90 to 92. That's 3 numbers (90,91,92).

Wait, let me check that count:

19 is just 19, so tens digit 1. Then from 20 to 29, that's 10 numbers (20-29 inclusive). Then 30-39 is 10, 40-49 10, 50-59 10, 60-69 10, 70-79 10, 80-89 10, and 90-92 is 3.

So counts for each tens digit:

1: 1
2:10
3:10
4:10
5:10
6:10
7:10
8:10
9:3

So the sum of the tens digits is:

Sum_a = (1 * 1) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 10) + (4 *10) + (5*10) + (6*10) + (7*10) + (8*10) + (9*3)

Let me compute that step by step:

1*1 = 1

2*10=20

3*10=30

4*10=40

5*10=50

6*10=60

7*10=70

8*10=80

9*3=27

Now add them all together:

1 + 20 = 21

21 +30=51

51+40=91

91+50=141

141+60=201

201+70=271

271+80=351

351+27=378

So Sum_a = 378.

Now for the sum of the units digits.

The units digits cycle from 0-9, but each ten's group has a different units digit. Wait, except for the first group (19), which is 9, and the last group (90-92), which is 0,1,2.

Wait no, actually, each group from 20-29 has units digits 0-9, same as 30-39, etc. The first group is 19, units digit 9. The last group is 90-92: units digits 0,1,2.

Wait, let me think again. The numbers from 19 to 92 are grouped as:

- 19: units digit 9
- 20-29: units digits 0-9
- 30-39: 0-9
- 40-49:0-9
- 50-59:0-9
- 60-69:0-9
- 70-79:0-9
- 80-89:0-9
- 90-92: 0,1,2

So the units digits for each group:

Group 1: 19 → 9
Groups 2-8: each has units digits 0-9: 10 numbers each, so 10 digits each. So each contributes sum 0+1+2+...+9=45. There are 7 such groups (2-9).

Group 9: 90,91,92 → units digits 0,1,2. Sum is 0+1+2=3.

So Sum_b is:

Sum_b = 9 (from group 1) + 7 * 45 (from groups 2-8) + 3 (from group 9).

Compute that:

7 *45 = 315

So 9 + 315 = 324

324 +3 = 327

So Sum_b = 327.

Therefore, total sum S of digits is Sum_a + Sum_b = 378 + 327 = 705.

Wait, that's 378 + 327. Let me compute that: 378 + 327 = 705.

Now, since N is divisible by 3^k, the maximum k is the highest power where 3^k divides S.

But wait, isn't that only for the entire number? Wait no, that's not correct. Because the divisibility of N by 3^k depends on the sum of its digits. Because N is congruent to its digit sum modulo 3. So if the digit sum is divisible by 3^k, then N is as well.

Wait, but actually, the exact rule is: a number is divisible by 3^k if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3^k. So the highest power of 3 that divides N is the highest power of 3 that divides the sum of its digits.

So we need to find the highest k where 3^k divides 705.

So let's factorize 705.

Divide 705 by 3: 705 ÷3= 235.

235 ÷3 is about 78.333, not an integer.

So 705 = 3 × 235.

Now, check if 235 is divisible by 3: 2+3+5=10. Not divisible by 3. So 235 is not divisible by 3.

So the highest power is 3^1. So k=1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the sum. Did I compute the digit sums correctly?

Sum of tens digits: 1 (from 19) + 2*10 (from 20-29) + 3*10 (30-39) + ... +9*3 (90-92). Wait, some confusion here. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens digits sum.

Wait, the first group is 19, which is 1 as tens digit. Then 20-29: tens digit 2, appearing 10 times. Then 30-39: 3, 10 times. Similarly up to 90-92: 9, 3 times.

So Sum_a is 1*1 + 2*10 + 3*10 + 4*10 +5*10 +6*10 +7*10 +8*10 +9*3.

Compute that again:

1*1=1

2*10=20

3*10=30

4*10=40

5*10=50

6*10=60

7*10=70

8*10=80

9*3=27

Add them all: 1 +20=21; 21+30=51; 51+40=91; 91+50=141; 141+60=201; 201+70=271; 271+80=351; 351+27=378. So Sum_a=378.

Sum_b: from 19 (units digit 9), then 20-29: 0-9 (sum 45), 30-39 (45), 40-49 (45), 50-59 (45), 60-69 (45), 70-79 (45), 80-89 (45), 90-92 (sum 0+1+2=3). So Sum_b=9 + 7*45 +3 = 9 + 315 +3=327.

So total S=378+327=705. Yes, that's correct.

Now, 705 is divisible by 3 once, since 705/3=235. 235 is not divisible by 3, since 2+3+5=10, which isn't a multiple of 3. So the highest power is 3^1, meaning k=1. So the answer should be option B:1.

The problem asks for the highest power of 3 that divides the large integer N formed by concatenating two-digit numbers from 19 to 92. 

To determine this, we calculate the sum of all digits in N. Each two-digit number contributes two digits, so there are 148 digits in total. The sum of the tens digits (Sum_a) is 378, and the sum of the units digits (Sum_b) is 327. The total sum S = 705. 

Since 705 is divisible by 3 once but not by higher powers of 3, the highest power is 3^1. Thus, k=1.

**Answer: B (1)**
