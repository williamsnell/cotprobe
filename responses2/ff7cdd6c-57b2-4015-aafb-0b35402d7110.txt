Okay, so I've got this question about the total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen. Hmm, nitrogen has an atomic number of 7, which means it has 7 protons and 7 electrons. Right, because neutral atoms have equal electrons and protons.

Now, the ground state means the electrons are in the lowest energy levels possible. So I need to figure out how the electrons are arranged in the orbitals. Nitrogen has an atomic number of 7, so the electron configuration starts with the first shell filled, then the second shell.

Wait, the order for filling electrons is by the Aufbau principle. So the order for nitrogen is 1s² 2s² 2p³. Wait, no. Let me think. The order is 1s, 2s, 2p, then 3s, etc. So for nitrogen, the filling is 1s² 2s² 2p³. Oh wait, but wait, wait. Nitrogen has atomic number 7. So the first shell is 1s² (2 electrons), the second shell starts with 2s², but then 2p can hold up to 6 electrons. Wait, no, 2p has 3 orbitals, each can hold 2 electrons. So 2p can hold 6. So for nitrogen, after 1s² (2), then 2s² (another 2), that's 4; then the 2p has 3 electrons (since 7-4=3). Wait, but 2p can hold 6, so 3 is fine.

Wait, but wait, let me get the electron configuration right. Nitrogen has Z=7, so the ground state is [He] 2s² 2p³? Or is it [He] 2s² 2p^5? Wait no, wait. Because for the third period, 2p can hold up to 6 electrons. So for nitrogen, the configuration is [He] 2s² 2p³. So the electrons are in the 2p orbital.

Wait, but wait, nitrogen's electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p³, right? So the 2p has 3 electrons. So each electron has a spin, and the total spin is the sum of each electron's spin.

Each electron in the same orbital has opposite spins. So for each p-orbital, if there are two electrons, their spins are opposite. For each p orbital with three electrons, there are three orbitals, but wait, wait, in the p subshell, each orbital can hold two electrons. So when you have three electrons in a p orbital, that's each in separate orbitals, so their spins are all opposite.

Wait, but wait: for a p orbital (which has 3 orbitals), if there are three electrons, each in a separate orbital, so each has spin up, down, up. Or wait, no, each electron in a p orbital has a spin, but in the same p orbital, spins are opposite. So for three electrons in p, two have spin up (if possible), but wait, no, each p orbital can have maximum two electrons. So for 2p³, each of the three electrons is in different p orbitals. So each has a different spin. So the spins would be up, down, up. Or maybe the first two have opposite spins. Wait, no, the spins are opposite for electrons in the same orbital. So each of the three electrons must have a unique spin direction.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. For a p orbital, each orbital can hold two electrons with opposite spins. So if you have three electrons in a p orbital, that means each of the three orbitals (there are three in the p subshell) has one electron each. So each has a spin of either +1/2 or -1/2. So the total spin would be the sum of each electron's spin.

Wait, but wait, the spin quantum number for each is either +1/2 or -1/2. So for three electrons, each in a separate p orbital, the sum would be (1/2) + (-1/2) + (1/2) = 1/2. Because two electrons have opposite spins, so their sum is zero, and the third contributes 1/2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. Each of the three electrons in the 2p orbital has a unique spin. So the three electrons have spin quantum numbers of +1/2, -1/2, and +1/2. So adding them: 1/2 -1/2 +1/2 = (0) + 1/2 = 1/2. So the total spin quantum number is 1/2.

But wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Each electron in the same orbital has spin up and down. So if you have two electrons in a p orbital, their spins are opposite. So their total spin would be zero. But if there are three electrons, each in separate p orbitals, so each has spin up. Wait, no. Because each p orbital can hold two electrons, so the third electron must be in a different orbital. So for three electrons, each in separate p orbitals, you have two with spin up and one down, or vice versa. But wait, no, each orbital can have only two electrons. So each of the three orbitals can hold up to two, but with opposite spins. So for three electrons, each in a different orbital, each has a unique spin. So, for example, one in +1/2, one in -1/2, and one in +1/2.

Wait, but wait, how many electrons are there in the 2p orbital for nitrogen? Nitrogen's ground state has 3 electrons in 2p. So each is in a different orbital, so each has a unique spin. So their spins are +1/2, -1/2, and +1/2. The sum is then 1/2 -1/2 +1/2 = 1/2.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the total spin is the sum of the individual spin quantum numbers. Each electron has a spin quantum number of either +1/2 or -1/2.

So for the three electrons, each has a spin of +1/2 except one which has -1/2. So sum: (1/2) + (1/2) + (-1/2) = (1) + (-1/2) = 1/2.

So total spin is 1/2. So the total spin quantum number is 1/2. Looking at the options, option F is 1/2. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another way to think about it: the total spin for a set of electrons is (number of unpaired electrons) × (1/2). But wait, unpaired electrons per electron. But that doesn't directly apply here. Alternatively, the spin multiplicity is 2S +1, where S is the total spin. But wait, that's not the total spin, but the number of possible total spin states.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this with something else. Let me think again. For a system of identical particles, the spin state is a symmetric or antisymmetric function. But for electrons, which are fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But that's about the spatial part multiplied by the spin part. So for the spatial part, the electrons are in the 2s and 2p orbitals.

Wait, but the question is about the total spin of the electrons in the ground state. So regardless of the spatial arrangement, each electron's spin contributes to the total spin. So each of the three electrons in the 2p orbital has a spin of either +1/2 or -1/2, but not all the same.

So the three electrons' spins are: one up (+1/2), one down (-1/2), and one up (+1/2). So when adding them, the sum is (1/2) + (-1/2) + (1/2) = 1/2. So the total spin is 1/2.

So the correct answer is option F, which is 1/2.

To determine the total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen (Z = 7), we start by analyzing the electron configuration of nitrogen. Neutral nitrogen has an atomic number of 7, meaning it has 7 electrons. The electron configuration for nitrogen in its ground state is [He] 2s² 2p³, where the first two electrons fill the 1s orbital, the next two fill the 2s orbital, and the remaining three electrons occupy the 2p orbital.

Each electron in the 2p orbital has a spin quantum number of either +1/2 or -1/2. Since there are three electrons in the 2p orbital, each in a separate orbital, their spins are unique. For example, the first two electrons could have spins of +1/2 and -1/2, and the third electron has a spin of +1/2. Summing these spins: 

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of nitrogen is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
