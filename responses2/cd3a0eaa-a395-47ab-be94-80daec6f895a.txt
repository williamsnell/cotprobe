Question:

A husband and his passenger were killed in an auto collision involving a defendant. The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she "was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is

Options:

A: objectionable, because it is irrelevant to the case at hand.
B: objectionable, because it could be seen as an attempt to tarnish the reputation of the deceased.
C: objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.
D: unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.
E: objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.
F: objectionable, because it infringes on the privacy of the deceased.
G: unobjectionable, because it provides a potential motive for the accident.

Alright, so I've got this question about a case involving a husband and wife being killed in an auto collision, and the wife is suing for damages. She's testifying that she and her husband were close friends for over 15 years. Then, the defendant's counsel asks her if she was aware of an affair the husband was having with his passenger. Her attorney objects, and the judge needs to decide whether this question is relevant.

Hmm, okay, so I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about whether the defendant's attorney is objecting because it's irrelevant. The options are A to G, with various reasons being considered.

So, the scenario is a family dispute leading to an auto crash. The husband and wife were already married for over 15 years, so they're close. The question is whether the wife's attorney thinks the defendant's question is irrelevant.

I remember that in some cases, cross-examination is used to gather evidence that can help the party being asked to deny evidence. But if the question is not relevant, then the witness can't answer, and the defense might have a problem.

Wait, but in this case, the witness's knowledge of the wife's husband's affair would be relevant because it might affect the value of the loss. Because if the husband was with his passenger (maybe a passenger is someone else, like another driver), and he was involved in an accident, that could be a factor in the damages. So the wife's knowledge of that might be seen as a factor in the loss.

But is that enough to make the question irrelevant? I think the question is about whether the witness's knowledge is relevant. If the knowledge is relevant, then the witness can answer, which the defense wants to prevent.

Alternatively, the defense might be objecting because it's an attempt to tarnish the reputation or to show that the husband was involved in something that caused the accident, which could be a defense.

Wait, but the issue is whether the question is relevant. The fact that the wife knew about the other husband's affair could be seen as an opportunity to bring up the fact that he was involved, which might be relevant. But wait, the question is about whether the question is relevant, not whether the witness can answer.

If the cross-examination is about whether she was aware, then the question is whether that knowledge is relevant. So, the defense might argue that the fact that she knew about the other's affair is evidence that the husband was involved, which could be a defense.

But the question is about the relevance of the cross-examination question. So, if the question is about whether she knew, and the issue is whether the question is relevant, then the defense might argue that she doesn't know, so the question is irrelevant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the scenario, the husband and wife were married for 15 years. The issue is whether the cross-examination question is relevant. The cross-examination is about whether she knew about a relationship the husband was having with someone else, perhaps a passenger. 

If she knew, then that would be relevant evidence. But if she doesn't know, maybe she's trying to say that the husband was involved in an accident because of his affair, which could be a defense.

So, the question is if the cross-examination is relevant. Since the wife says she didn't know, the issue is whether that knowledge is relevant.

Wait, another angle: if the question is asked and the witness's answer is irrelevant, then the defense might have a problem. But the question is if the question is relevant, not if the answer is irrelevant.

Wait, no, the question is whether the question is relevant, not whether the answer is. So the judge would decide if the fact that the wife didn't know (and the question is whether she knew) is relevant to the case.

In this case, the fact that the husband was involved in an accident because of his wife's affair could be a factor in damages. So, if the cross-examination focused on whether she knew, then the fact that she knew could be relevant. But if she doesn't know, is the fact that she might not be able to answer, thereby making the question irrelevant?

Alternatively, if the question is about whether she knew, and the fact that she didn't is relevant, then the question is relevant. But if she didn't know, maybe she's trying to say that she didn't know, which could be a defense.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the cross-examination question is relevant. If the fact that she didn't know is relevant because it could be used to show that the husband was involved in the accident (which is a factor in the loss), then the defense might argue that the question is relevant.

Wait, but the options are A to G. Let's look at them:

Option A: Objectionable because it's irrelevant to the case.

If she didn't know, then perhaps that knowledge is relevant. But if the question is about whether she knew, then that's the fact, and perhaps it's not relevant. Wait, noâ€”because the cross-examination is about whether she knew, so the question is about the relevance of that fact. So, the question is: is the fact that she didn't know (and the fact that the husband was with his passenger) relevant?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

Option B is about it being seen as an attempt to tarnish the reputation. That's about the purpose of the question, not just relevance. It's a defense, but not necessarily about relevance.

Option C says it's highly prejudicial. That's a strong reason to object, like it could change the outcome.

Option D says it's unobjectionable because the plaintiff's knowledge is probative. So, if she knew, that could be evidence of loss. But that's about the witness's knowledge, not the question's relevance.

Option E: Because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination. Wait, cross-examination can sometimes go beyond direct, but that's not the issue here. The question is whether the question is relevant, not whether the witness can answer it.

Option F: Objection because it infringes on the privacy of the deceased. That's about the right to privacy, but not directly about relevance.

Option G: Unobjectionable because it provides a potential motive. So, the question could be motivated by the idea that the husband was involved, which is a defense.

So, the question is about whether the cross-examination question is relevant. The fact that the wife testifies that she and her husband were close for 15 years, and the question is whether she was aware of the other's affair.

If she knew, then that would be relevant evidence. If she didn't know, that could be a defense. But the question is about the relevance of the fact that she didn't know.

Wait, no. The question is whether the fact that she knew is relevant. If she knew, it's relevant; if she didn't, it's about whether that fact could be used to show something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that she didn't know is irrelevant because it's not a fact that can be proven, but rather a statement that someone else made. So, if she didn't know, that doesn't directly relate to the case. The cross-examination is about whether she knew, so the question is about the relevance of that fact.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it as an exam question.

In the scenario, the cross-examination is about whether the husband was with his passenger. The wife testifies that she and her husband had a close relationship. The question is whether she was aware of the other's affair.

If she didn't know, that's a fact. But the question is whether that knowledge is relevant. If the fact that she didn't know is relevant, then the cross-examination question is relevant. Otherwise, it's not.

Wait, but the wife's attorney is objecting. The reason being that it's irrelevant. So, perhaps the question is irrelevant because it's not a fact that can be proven, but a statement of someone else's fact. So, it's a question of whether she was aware, but that's not a question that can be answered because she might not know. But that's about whether she can answer, not whether the question is relevant.

Wait, but the question is for cross-examination. So, the question is "Was she aware of the affair?" So, if she didn't know, the question is about the relevance of that fact.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the legal standards. If the question is about whether she knew, and that's relevant, then the cross-examination is relevant. So, the question is relevant because it's a fact that can be proven or disproven.

So, if the wife didn't know, that fact is relevant. So, the question is relevant because it's a fact that can be proven, but it was answered by the witness. The judge would need to decide whether the question is admissible.

Wait, but the judge's question is whether the question is relevant. So, the question's relevance is about whether it's a fact that can be determined by cross-examination or a matter that is not a fact and thus irrelevant.

Wait, but the question is whether she knew, so it's a fact that can be determined. So, the fact is a fact, so the question is relevant. So, the question is relevant, but the witness is objecting because she said she didn't know.

But option A says it's irrelevant because it's not relevant. So, if the fact is relevant, then the question is relevant. Therefore, the question is not irrelevant.

Wait, but the options are about whether the question is relevant. So, the options are:

A: Objectionable because it's irrelevant.

B: Objectionable because it's about reputation.

C: Objectionable because it's prejudicial.

D: Unobjectionable because the plaintiff's knowledge is probative.

E: Objectionable because it's beyond direct.

F: Objectionable because it infringes on privacy.

G: Unobjectionable because it's a potential motive.

So, the question is whether it's relevant. If the question is about whether she knew, and she didn't, then the fact is relevant. So, the question is relevant.

But the options say whether the question is objectionable. So, if the question is about whether she knew, which is a fact, then the question is relevant because it's a fact that can be determined. So, the question is not irrelevant and thus not an obstruction.

Wait, but what's the reason behind the objection? The defense's reason is that it's irrelevant, but the actual fact is relevant.

So, perhaps the judge should rule the question is not relevant, allowing the witness to answer.

Wait, but the question is about whether she knew, so the cross-examination is about that. If the question is about her knowledge, that's relevant because she might answer. But the fact that she didn't know might be an issue, but the question itself is about whether she knew, which is a factual question.

I think the correct answer is A, because if the question is about whether she knew, which is a factual question, then it's not irrelevant. So, the question is not relevant, and thus the witness can answer, so the question is not objectionable.

Wait, but another angle: the fact that she didn't know could be seen as a defense. So, perhaps the question is not relevant because it's about whether she knew, which is a matter of fact, but the fact that she didn't know is not considered a question for cross-examination. Or, perhaps the question is being asked to determine whether she knew, but that's a matter of fact, so it's relevant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. The question is about whether she was aware of the affair. The fact that she didn't know is relevant because it's a fact that can be determined, and thus the question is relevant.

So, the question is not irrelevant. Therefore, the option that says it's not relevant is A. So, the judge should not rule it out.

Wait, but option A says it's unobjectionable because it's irrelevant. But if it's relevant, then A is incorrect.

But perhaps I'm mixing up the reasoning. If the cross-examination is about whether she knew, and she didn't, then the question is about a fact. So, the fact is a matter of fact, so it's relevant.

So, the question is not irrelevant, so the judge should not object. So, the correct ruling would be that the question is not relevant, so it's not an obstruction.

Looking at the options:

A: Unobjectionable because irrelevant. So, if it's irrelevant, the question is unobjectionable. But if it's relevant, it's not.

Wait, the options say the question is for cross-examination. So, if the question is about whether she knew, which is a fact, then the fact is relevant. So, the question is relevant.

So, the judge should not object. So, the correct ruling would be that the question is not relevant, so it's unobjectionable. So, which option says that? Looking, option D says it's unobjectionable because the plaintiff's knowledge is probative.

Wait, but D is about the knowledge of the plaintiff, not the cross-examination question.

Wait, no. The cross-examination is about whether she knew, not the knowledge of the plaintiff. So, the knowledge of the plaintiff is a separate thing. The question is about whether the witness knew, which is a fact.

So, the question is about whether she knew, which is a fact. So, it's relevant.

So, the question is not irrelevant, so the answer shouldn't be option A. Instead, the question is relevant, so the judge should allow the witness to answer, meaning the question isn't objectionable.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Objectionable, because irrelevant.

B: Objectionable, because it's about reputation.

C: Objectionable, because it's prejudicial.

D: Unobjectionable, because the plaintiff's knowledge is probative.

E: Objectionable, because beyond direct.

F: Objectionable, because privacy.

G: Unobjectionable, because it's a motive.

So, the correct ruling would be that the question is not irrelevant, thus it's not an obstruction. So, the correct answer would be D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is whether she was aware of the matter. If the question is about whether she knew, then the fact is relevant, so the question is relevant. Therefore, it's not an obstruction. So, the judge should not rule it out. So, the correct option is A: unobjectionable because irrelevant.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether she knew, and that's a fact that could be used, so it's relevant. So, the question is relevant, and the judge should see it as admissible. Thus, the answer would be option A, but wait, option A says it's unobjectionable because it's irrelevant. So, if it's irrelevant, then the question is not an obstruction. But if it's relevant, then the answer would be that it's not an obstruction.

I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. The key point is that the cross-examination is about whether she knew. If she didn't know, that's a matter of fact, so the question is relevant. Therefore, it's not an obstruction. So, the correct answer is that the question is not relevant, so the judge should not object. Thus, the answer is A.

Wait, no. Option A says it's unobjectionable because it's irrelevant. So, if the question is irrelevant, the witness can answer, so it's not an obstruction. So, the correct ruling is not to object because the question is not irrelevant.

So, the correct option is A: unobjectionable, because it's irrelevant.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is whether she knew, which is a fact. So, the question is relevant. So, the judge should not object. But the options don't have an option for that.

Wait, another approach: the wife's attorney is objecting on the grounds that the question is about whether she knew, which is a matter of fact. But perhaps she doesn't know, so she can't answer, but that's not an obstruction because the question is about a fact that can be determined.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe the answer is option A, because the question is about whether she knew, which is a fact. If it's a fact, it's not irrelevant.
</think>

The question about whether the husband's wife knew of the affair the husband was having with his passenger is a matter of fact. The cross-examination is about this fact, and if the wife did not know, that fact is relevant to the case. The cross-examination can determine if the wife knew, so the question is not irrelevant. Therefore, the question is not an obstruction, and the judge should not rule it out. The correct answer is that the question is not relevant, so it is unobjectionable.
