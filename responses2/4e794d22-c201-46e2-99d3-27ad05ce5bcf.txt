Okay, so I have this statistics problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the sample size needed for a confidence interval with a certain margin of error. Hmm, I remember that for confidence intervals involving the mean, the formula uses the z-score and the standard error. 

The problem states that the tarsus length X for a male grackle is normally distributed with a mean μ and variance 4.84. So the standard deviation σ is the square root of 4.84, which is 2.2. Because variance is σ², so σ = √4.84 = 2.2.

We need to find the sample size n such that we're 95% confident that the maximum error (which is called the margin of error) is 0.4. So, I think the formula for the margin of error E in a confidence interval for the mean is E = z*(σ/√n), where z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.

Wait, for a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is 1.96, right? Because the critical value z* for 95% confidence is 1.96. So that's our z.

Given E = 0.4, σ = 2.2, and z = 1.96, we can plug these into the equation and solve for n.

So the formula is E = z*(σ/√n). Let's rearrange this to solve for n. 

E = z*σ / √n  
Multiply both sides by √n:  
E*√n = z*σ  
Then, divide both sides by E:  
√n = (z*σ) / E  
Square both sides to solve for n:  
n = (z*σ / E)²

Let me plug in the numbers. 

z = 1.96, σ = 2.2, E = 0.4.

So, z*σ = 1.96 * 2.2. Let me calculate that. 1.96 times 2 is 3.92, and 1.96 times 0.2 is 0.392, so adding those gives 3.92 + 0.392 = 4.312.

Then, z*σ / E = 4.312 / 0.4. Let's compute that. 4.312 divided by 0.4. Well, 0.4 goes into 4.312 how many times? 0.4 * 10 is 4, so 4.312 - 4 is 0.312. 0.4 goes into 0.312 0.78 times (since 0.4*0.78=0.312). So total is 10.78.

So √n = 10.78. So n is (10.78)². Let me calculate that. 10 squared is 100, 0.78 squared is about 0.6084. Then, 10.78 squared is (10 + 0.78)^2 = 10² + 2*10*0.78 + 0.78² = 100 + 15.6 + 0.6084 = 116.2084. So n is approximately 116.2084.

But sample size has to be an integer, and since we want to be confident that the maximum error is at most 0.4, we need to round up to the next whole number. So 116.21 rounds up to 117. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, another way: 10.78 squared is (10 + 0.78)^2 = 10² + 2*10*0.78 + 0.78² = 100 + 15.6 + 0.6084 = 116.2084. So yes, 116.21. So n must be 117.

Looking back at the options:

A:102

B:155

C:86

D:108

E:75

F:117

G:125

H:140

I:130

J:94

So the correct answer is F:117.

To determine the sample size \( n \) needed for a 95% confidence interval with a maximum error (margin of error) of 0.4, we use the formula for the margin of error in a confidence interval for the mean:

\[
E = z \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Where:
- \( E = 0.4 \) (maximum error),
- \( z = 1.96 \) (z-score for 95% confidence),
- \( \sigma = 2.2 \) (standard deviation),
- \( n \) is the sample size to be found.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( n \):

\[
n = \left( \frac{z \cdot \sigma}{E} \right)^2
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
n = \left( \frac{1.96 \cdot 2.2}{0.4} \right)^2
\]

First, calculate \( 1.96 \cdot 2.2 \):
\[
1.96 \cdot 2.2 = 4.312
\]

Then, divide by \( E = 0.4 \):
\[
\frac{4.312}{0.4} = 10.78
\]

Next, square the result to find \( n \):
\[
n = (10.78)^2 = 116.2084
\]

Since the sample size must be an integer, round up to the next whole number:
\[
n = 117
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: F: 117**
