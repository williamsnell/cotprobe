Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking for the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons, and a yield of 6%. Hmm. I remember that bond prices are calculated based on the present value of their future cash flows. So, the bond pays a coupon each year, and then at the end of the term, it also pays the face value.

First, let's break down the details. The bond has a face value of $100, which means when it matures, it's worth $100. The coupon rate is 5%, so each year it pays 5% of $100, which is $5. The bond is for three years, so there are three coupon payments and then the face value at the end.

The yield to maturity (YTM) given is 6%. YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until it matures. So, it's the discount rate that equates the bond's price to the present value of its cash flows.

I think the formula for the bond price is the sum of the present value of each coupon and the present value of the face value. The formula would look like this:

Bond Price = (C / (1 + r)^1) + (C / (1 + r)^2) + (C + FV) / (1 + r)^3

Where:
- C is the annual coupon payment.
- r is the yield to maturity (YTM) per period.
- FV is the face value at maturity.

Plugging the numbers in, let's see:

C = $5 per year.
r = 6% or 0.06.
FV = $100.

So, each coupon is $5, and the three payments of $5 each occur at the end of each year. The third payment includes the last coupon and the face value.

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate the present value of the first coupon: $5 / (1.06)^1 = 5 / 1.06 ≈ $4.7169.

Second, the second coupon: $5 / (1.06)^2. Let's compute (1.06)^2. 1.06 *1.06 = 1.1236. So, 5 / 1.1236 ≈ $4.4559.

Third, the third payment: $5 (coupon) + $100 (face value) = $105. Its present value is 105 / (1.06)^3.

Compute (1.06)^3: 1.06 *1.06=1.1236; 1.1236 *1.06 ≈1.191016. So, 105 / 1.191016 ≈$88.18.

Now add all these present values together:

$4.7169 + $4.4559 + $88.18 ≈ let's compute:

4.7169 +4.4559 = 9.1728. Then, 9.1728 +88.18 = 97.3528. So, approximately $97.35.

Looking at the options, D is $97.33. That's very close to what I calculated. Hmm, maybe I should double-check my math because sometimes rounding errors can happen.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term more precisely.

Let me compute each component accurately.

First term: 5 / 1.06 = 5 / 1.06 ≈ 4.716949.

Second term: 5 / (1.06)^2 = 5 / 1.1236 ≈4.455848.

Third term: (5 +100) =105. 105 / (1.06)^3. Let's compute 1.06^3 accurately.

1.06^1 =1.06
1.06^2=1.1236
1.06^3=1.1236 *1.06 = 1.191016.

So, 105 /1.191016. Let me compute that. 105 ÷ 1.191016.

Let me do the division: 105 ÷ 1.191016.

1.191016 goes into 105 how many times?

Well, 1.191016 *90 = 107.19144 (since 1.191016 *90= 1.191016*9*10= 10.719144 *10=107.19144). So, 1.191016 *90 is 107.19144, which is more than 105, so 90- something.

Alternatively, perhaps 1.191016 *90 =107.19144, which is 2.19144 more than 105. So, let me do 1.191016 *90 =107.19144. 107.19144 -105 =2.19144.

So, 2.19144 /1.191016 ≈1.846.

So, 90 - 1.846 ≈88.154.

So the third term is approximately $88.15.

Adding all three present values:

First term: ~4.7169
Second: ~4.4558
Third: ~88.154 → total ≈4.7169 +4.4558 =9.1727 +88.154=97.3267. So approximately $97.33.

Looking at the options, D is $97.33. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons, and a yield of 6%, we calculate the present value of the bond's cash flows. The bond makes annual coupon payments of $5 (5% of $100) and pays the face value ($100) at the end of the third year. Using the present value formula:

\[
\text{Bond Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{3} \frac{\text{Coupon Payment}}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1 + r)^3}
\]

Where:
- Coupon Payment = $5,
- Yield (r) = 6% = 0.06,
- Face Value = $100.

Calculations:
1. **First Coupon Payment**:
   \[
   \frac{5}{(1.06)^1} = \frac{5}{1.06} \approx 4.7169
   \]

2. **Second Coupon Payment**:
   \[
   \frac{5}{(1.06)^2} = \frac{5}{1.1236} \approx 4.4558
   \]

3. **Third Payment (Coupon + Face Value)**:
   \[
   \frac{5 + 100}{(1.06)^3} = \frac{105}{1.191016} \approx 88.154
   \]

Summing these present values:
\[
4.7169 + 4.4558 + 88.154 \approx 97.3267
\]

Thus, the bond price is approximately $97.33. Among the options, D corresponds to this value.
