Okay, so I've got this problem about folding a piece of paper. Let me try to visualize it.

The paper is 8.5 by 11 inches. So, it's a standard sheet of paper. Now, the process is: fold it in half repeatedly, each time shortening the longer side. I need to find the length of the longest side after the second fold, expressed as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Wait, let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial dimensions are 8.5 inches by 11 inches. The longer side is 11 inches because 11 is bigger than 8.5. So, the first fold will be along the longer side. But wait, when you fold a paper in half, you choose to fold it along the longer side. So, if you have the longer side as 11, then after folding it in half, the new longer side will be half of 11, which is 5.5 inches. The shorter side becomes 8.5 inches, but wait, actually, let me think again.

Wait, when you fold the paper in half, you're halving the longer side. So, the initial longer side is 11, so after the first fold, it becomes 11 / 2 = 5.5 inches. What about the shorter side? It was 8.5 inches, but since the fold is along the longer side, the shorter side remains the same? Or does it get halved as well?

Wait, that might be where I'm getting confused. Let me think. If I have a rectangle and I fold it along the longer side, I'm effectively halving the longer side, and halving the shorter side as well. Because when you fold a paper in half, both dimensions get halved. So, for example, a paper that's 8.5 x 11 inches: when folded along the longer side (11 inches), the folded paper would be 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches. Because 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, and 8.5 remains, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if you fold the paper along the longer side, the two shorter sides would become adjacent, so the new dimensions would be 5.5 inches and 8.5 inches? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the paper as a rectangle with length L and width W, where L > W. Each fold is done along the longer side, so each time, the longer side is halved, and the shorter side becomes the new longer side after the fold.

So, initial dimensions: L = 11 inches, W = 8.5 inches.

After first fold: the longer side is now 11 / 2 = 5.5 inches, and the shorter side becomes 8.5 inches. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you fold along the longer side, the two shorter sides (each of 8.5 inches) become adjacent, so the new longer side would be 5.5 inches, and the new shorter side would be 8.5 inches? That can't be, because 5.5 is shorter than 8.5, so 8.5 would be the new longer side.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think: when you fold a paper along its length, the two shorter sides come together. So, for a rectangle of 8.5 x 11 inches, if you fold it along the longer side (11 inches), the resulting shape would be 8.5 inches by (11 / 2) = 5.5 inches. Wait, but 5.5 is shorter than 8.5, so 8.5 inches is the longer side. So, after the first fold, the dimensions would be 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches. So, the longer side after first fold is 8.5 inches, and the shorter side is 5.5 inches.

Wait, but the question says each time the longer side is shortened. So, after the first fold, the longer side is 8.5 inches. Then, in the second fold, we'll fold the longer side again, which is 8.5 inches. So, the second fold will halve 8.5 inches, making it 8.5 / 2 = 4.25 inches. The shorter side was 5.5 inches, so after the second fold, the new dimensions would be 4.25 inches and 5.5 inches. So, which is longer? 5.5 inches is longer than 4.25 inches, so the longest side is 5.5 inches.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, another approach: each fold reduces the longer side by half. So, starting with 11 and 8.5. First fold: longer side is 11, fold it to 5.5. Then, the next longer side is 8.5 inches. So, fold 8.5 to 4.25. So, after two folds, the dimensions are 4.25 inches and 5.5 inches, so the longer side is 5.5 inches.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether each fold affects both dimensions. Let me think of it as a rectangle that's being folded each time. Each time you fold along the longer side, the longer side is halved, and the shorter side becomes the new longer side for the next fold.

So, initial: 11 x 8.5. First fold: fold along the longer side (11), so new dimensions are 5.5 x 8.5. Now, the longer side is 8.5. Second fold: fold along the longer side (8.5), so new dimensions are 4.25 x 8.5. So, the longer side is now 8.5 inches. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, that's different. So, after two folds, the longer side is 8.5 inches.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier analysis. So, I must have made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, let me clarify: when you fold a paper, you're folding along one of its longer sides, which causes the paper to become half as long in that direction. So, if the paper is 8.5 x 11, the longer side is 11. Folding along that side would make the new dimensions 8.5 x 5.5. So, after first fold, the longer side is 8.5 inches. Then, the next fold is along the longer side, which is 8.5, so the next fold will make it 4.25 inches. So, the new dimensions are 4.25 x 8.5 inches. So, the longer side is 8.5 inches.

Wait, that makes sense now. So, after two folds, the longer side is 8.5 inches. So, the answer would be 8.5 inches. Looking at the options, 8.5 is option B.

Wait, but wait another moment. Wait, no, because in the second fold, the longer side is 8.5 inches, so when folded, it becomes 4.25 inches, and the other side was 5.5 inches. So, after the second fold, the longer side is 5.5 inches because 8.5 is longer than 5.5, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, no, the longer side after the second fold is 8.5 inches because after the first fold, the longer side is 8.5, then in the second fold, 8.5 becomes 4.25, but the other side is 5.5. So, 5.5 is shorter than 4.25? No, 5.5 is longer than 4.25. Wait, no, 5.5 is longer than 4.25. So, the longer side is 5.5 inches after the second fold.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try again.

First fold:

Original paper: 8.5 x 11.

Fold along the longer side (11 inches), so the new dimensions are 8.5 x (11 / 2) = 8.5 x 5.5. So, the longer side is now 8.5 inches.

Second fold:

Now, the longer side is 8.5 inches. So, we fold along this, making the new dimensions 8.5 / 2 = 4.25 inches and 5.5 inches. So, which is longer? 8.5 inches becomes 4.25, and 5.5 inches is longer than 4.25, so the longer side is 5.5 inches.

So, after two folds, the longer side is 5.5 inches, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that after two folds, it's 8.5 inches. That was wrong. So, the correct answer should be 5.5 inches.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me approach it mathematically.

Each fold halves the longer side. So, initial longer side:11.

After first fold: 11 / 2 = 5.5.

After second fold: 5.5 / 2 = 2.75 inches. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, in the second fold, the longer side is 8.5, not 5.5.

Wait, no, that's my mistake. Because after the first fold, the longer side is 8.5 inches. So, the second fold is along 8.5 inches.

So, folding 8.5 inches: 8.5 / 2 = 4.25 inches. So, the new dimensions are 4.25 inches and 5.5 inches. So, the longer side is 5.5 inches.

Therefore, the longer side after two folds is 5.5 inches, which is option B.
</think>

The initial paper is 8.5 x 11 inches. After the first fold along the longer side (11 inches), the dimensions become 8.5 x 5.5 inches, with 8.5 being the longer side. The second fold is along this 8.5-inch side, resulting in 4.25 x 5.5 inches. Since 5.5 is longer than 4.25, the longest side after two folds is 5.5 inches.

Answer: B
