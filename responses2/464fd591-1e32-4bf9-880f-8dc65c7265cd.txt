Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about effusion rates. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question says that two gases, HBr (molecular weight 81) and CH4 (molecular weight 16), have molecular weights 81 and 16, respectively. HBr is said to effuse through a certain opening at 4 ml per second. The question is asking at what rate CH4 will effuse through the same opening.

Wait, I remember something called Graham's law of effusion. Oh right! Graham's law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight. So the formula goes like this: effusion rate ∝ 1/√(M), where M is the molecular weight.

So the rate of effusion (let's call it r) is proportional to 1 divided by the square root of M. That means if gas A effuses at a rate r, and gas B has molecular weight M_B, then r_A / r_B = sqrt(M_B / M_A).

Wait, let me get that right. So r is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So r ∝ 1/√M. Therefore, the ratio of their rates would be (1/√M1) / (1/√M2) )= √(M2/M1).

So for HBr and CH4, their rates should be in the ratio of √(16/81). Because M1 is 81 (HBr) and M2 is 16 (CH4).

Let me compute that. 16 divided by 81 is (4²)/(9²) )= (4/9)². So the square root of that is 4/9.

So the rate of HBr (which is 4 ml/sec) compared to CH4 should be 4 : (CH4 rate) = 4/9. Wait no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is r1/r2 = √(M2/M1). Or is it based on the other way?

Wait, let's clarify. Let me think of it as r1 is the rate of HBr, and r2 is the rate of CH4. According to Graham's law, r1/r2 = √(M2/M1) because the smaller the molecular weight, the higher the effusion rate.

So, r1 is 4 ml/sec. We need to find r2.

r1 / r2 = sqrt(M2/M1) => r2 = r1 * sqrt(M1/M2).

So M1 is 81, M2 is 16.

So M1/M2 = 81/16. The square root of that is sqrt(81/16) = 9/4.

So r2 = 4 * (9/4) = 9 ml/sec.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes I get confused with the order. Let me think again.

Graham's law says that the rate of effusion is proportional to 1 over square root of the molecular weight. So r = k / sqrt(M).

So for HBr, r1 = k / sqrt(81) = k / 9.

CH4's rate r2 = k / sqrt(16) = k/4.

So the ratio r1/r2 = (k/9) / (k/4) )= (1/9)/(1/4) )= 4/9.

So r1/r2 = 4/9 → r2 = r1 * (9/4) → 4 * 9/4 = 9.

So CH4 effuses at 9 ml/sec. Looking at the options, option J is 9 ml/sec. So the correct answer should be J.

Using Graham's law of effusion, the effusion rate of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight. The formula can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}
\]

Here, \( r_1 \) is the effusion rate of HBr (4 ml/sec), and \( M_1 = 81 \) (molecular weight of HBr). \( r_2 \) is the effusion rate of CH4 (\( M_2 = 16 \)). Rearranging the formula to solve for \( r_2 \):

\[
r_2 = r_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{M_1}{M_2}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
r_2 = 4 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{81}{16}} = 4 \cdot \frac{9}{4} = 9 \, \text{ml/sec}
\]

Thus, the effusion rate of CH4 is 9 ml/sec. From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 9 ml/sec**
