Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 13 over 4 equals x over 7. Hmm, I think I remember that when you have a proportion like that, you can solve for the unknown by cross-multiplying. Let me try to remember how that works.

So, the equation is 13/4 = x/7. To solve for x, I should cross-multiply. That means I multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other. So, 13 times 7 would be 91, and 4 times x would be 4x. So, the equation becomes 13*7 = 4x, or 91 = 4x.

Now, I need to solve for x. Since 4 is multiplied by x, I should divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get x by itself. So, x = 91 divided by 4. Let's do that division. 91 divided by 4 is... well, 4 times 22 is 88, and there's 3 left over. So, that's 22 and 3/4, which is 22.75. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 22.75 as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A: 22.25, B:23.25, C:25.25, D:23.75, E:21.75, F:24.75, G:20.50, H: none of these, I:24.25, J:22.75.

Oh, option J is 22.75. So that's the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let me verify. 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, and x divided by 7 should equal 3.25. So, x is 3.25 times 7. Let's calculate that. 3 times 7 is 21, and 0.25 times 7 is 1.75. So 21 + 1.75 is 22.75. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier. So the correct answer is J:22.75.

The solution involves cross-multiplying to find x:

13/4 = x/7  
13 Ã— 7 = 4x  
91 = 4x  
x = 91 / 4  
x = 22.75  

The correct answer is J:22.75.
