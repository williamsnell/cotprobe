Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"After all the slaves had been brought together and severally marked with the letter G, the emperor's fifths and then Cortés' were deducted before we were aware of it; and, besides this, on the night preceding, the finest of the Indian females had been secretly set apart, so that when it came to a division among us soldiers, we found none left but old and ugly women&….Another soldier asked Cortés if the division he had made of the gold in Mexico was not a sufficient imposition, for, at first, he had merely spoken of 300,000 pesos, but when we were obliged to retreat from the city, it was estimated at 700,000 pesos. And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&…
[Later], when Cortés learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cortés managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&…"

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568. The question is about the consequences of certain actions described in the memoir upon the return of Cortés's expedition.

First, let me read through the given information carefully. The text describes a conflict between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese, specifically over gold. Cortés, the Conquistador, made some demands after the Spanish had claimed a large amount of gold. He demanded more gold, and the Portuguese refused. The story goes on about this exchange and the consequences.

The question is asking which consequence occurred after the return of Cortés's expedition. The options are A through J, each representing a different economic or political change.

The options are:

A: Decrease in the value of gold
B: Enhanced diplomatic relations
C: Less tolerance for Jews and Muslims
D: Rise in cultural and racial tensions
E: Decrease in population
F: Increased inflation
G: Decrease in population (but this seems similar to E, maybe not the intended answer)
H: Boost in military power and influence
I: Increase in trade and commerce
J: Increase in agricultural sector

Now, thinking about the economic actions described. When Cortés demanded more gold, the price went up. The Portuguese refused, so the Spanish had to pay. But what's the immediate effect? It's more about the exchange of gold rather than the value of gold itself. So the value of gold might not have decreased; instead, the amount being demanded increased. So option A is probably not correct.

Option B talks about diplomatic relations. I don't recall that being a direct result of the gold exchange. The story is more about the military and economic conflict, not diplomatic changes. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C is about tolerance for Jews and Muslims. This doesn't seem directly related to the gold conflict. The story doesn't mention any new policies or changes in religious tolerance. So probably not C.

Option D: Racial tensions. The text doesn't say anything about people feeling less tolerant. It's more about military conflict and gold exchange. So D is likely not correct.

Option E: Decrease in population. The text doesn't provide any information about population numbers, so this seems unrelated.

Option F: Increased inflation. The question doesn't mention any economic indicators like price increases. The text describes the exchange of gold and the financial demands, but doesn't mention inflation directly. So I don't think F is the correct answer.

Option G: Decrease in population. Similar to E; the text doesn't provide any data on population, so not relevant.

Option H: Boost in military power and influence. Cortés's actions led to his military expansion, which would make him more powerful and influential. So H seems plausible.

Option I: Increase in trade and commerce. Yes, because when the Spanish wanted more gold, they had to pay more, leading to increased trade. So I is also a possibility.

Option J: Increase in agricultural sector. The text doesn't mention anything about farming or land use, so I don't think J is correct.

So between H and I, which is the better answer.

The question is about consequences of the actions, which were primarily about gold and military demands. While Cortés's actions led to military expansion, the immediate effect is more on economic demands (like the amount being demanded) and military power. However, the question is about consequences, which could include broader impacts.

The Memoirs of the Conquistador del Castillo is a historical text. From what I remember, when Cortés returned, his actions led to a lot of tension, including the exchange of gold. This exchange led to a lot of military expansion and increased trade. So the increase in trade and commerce (option I) is a direct result of the economic demand from the Spanish Empire.

But another point is that the gold exchange caused a lot of conflict between the two sides. This conflict could have led to more competition in the market, which would increase trade. Also, when the Spanish wanted more gold, they had to pay more, which could have increased the demand for other goods, leading to increased trade.

On the other hand, the military expansion led to a boost in military power and influence (option H), but that's not as directly tied to the immediate economic exchange.

Wait, the text says that Cortés made demands on the night of their retreat. The next day, the Spanish had to retreat, and he demanded more gold. The Portuguese refused, and the Spanish had to pay. So the gold was increased, but the immediate effect on the economy was the increased demand, which would lead to increased trade. So yes, the increase in trade and commerce (I) is a consequence.

However, another point is that the gold exchange could have led to more competition among the colonies, leading to increased trade. So both I and H are possible, but the question is which is a consequence of the actions described.

Looking back at the options, I and H are both possible. But the question is a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of the text, the key points are the exchange of gold and the military expansion. The exchange of gold increased the amount the Spanish wanted, which probably did lead to increased trade.

So, looking at the options, I is an increase in trade and commerce. That's a direct result of the gold exchange and the financial demands. So I is the correct answer.

The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568, describes a series of conflicts between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese, primarily over gold. Upon the return of Cortés's expedition, the key actions involved the demand for more gold by the Spanish, leading to a financial and military confrontation. The immediate consequences of these actions were the increased demand for gold, which in turn led to an increase in trade. This is because the Spanish had to pay more for the gold they sought, and the increased financial demands directly caused an expansion of trade.

Analyzing the options:

- **H (Boost in military power and influence):** While military expansion occurred, the immediate consequence was more directly tied to the economic exchange, which increased trade.
- **I (Increase in trade and commerce):** This is a direct result of the Spanish' increased demand for gold, leading to higher prices and increased trade.

Thus, the most accurate consequence of the actions described is an increase in trade and commerce.

**Answer: H**
