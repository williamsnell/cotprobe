Question:

Which of the following statements best describes what a Barr body is and its significance?

Options:

A: It is an activated X chromosome and results in females who are sterile.
B: It is an inactivated Y chromosome and results in a man appearing female.
C: It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in males with half their cells having one X inactivated and the other half of their cells having the other X inactivated.
D: It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in females with half their cells having one X inactivated and the other half of their cells having the other X inactivated.
E: It is an activated X chromosome and results in females with all their cells having one X activated.
F: It is an inactivated Y chromosome and results in a man being sterile.
G: It is an inactivated Y chromosome, and the person who has it appears female.
H: It is an activated Y chromosome and results in males with half their cells having one Y activated.
I: It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in males being sterile.
J: It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in females who are sterile.

Okay, so I have this question about Barr bodies and their significance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think through it.

I remember that in genetics, especially concerning X and Y chromosomes, there's something called Barr body. I think it's related to females with an inactivated X chromosome, but wait, how does that work?

Wait, normal X and Y chromosomes are used for males and females. Normally, females have two X chromosomes, one active and one inactive. But when there's an inactivation, like the Barr body, it means both X chromosomes are inactivated. Oh right, that's when a female has both Xs turned off, which then causes certain issues.

So the question is about which statement best describes this. Let's look at the options.

Option A: It's an activated X chromosome in females, resulting in sterility. No, because if it's activated, it's the opposite of Barr body. And typically, females with both Xs inactive (inactivate) are sterile. So A is wrong.

Option B: Inactivated Y chromosome, appears female. No, because Y is only present in males, right? So B is incorrect.

Option C: Inactivated X, male with half of cells have one X and the other half the other. Wait, but I thought in males, both Xs are active. So if it's inactivated, both are off? Or in males, the Xs are both active. So C says half have one and half the other, which doesn't sound right. Because in males, both cells have both Xs. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Inactivated X, resulting in half cells have one X and half the other. Wait, no, that's not right. In males, both Xs are active. So I think D is incorrect because it's not about half and half; it's both active.

Option E: Activated X in females, producing sterility. No, because Barr body is inactivated, not activated. So E is wrong.

Option F: Inactivated Y, results in sterility. Wait, I thought in Y, if it's inactivated, the Y would be inactive, but males can't have Ys. So F is about a man, which wouldn't happen because Y isn't inactivated in males. So F is wrong.

Option G: Inactivated Y chromosome, appears female. No, Y is always male. So G is wrong.

Option H: Activated Y chromosome, male with half cells have one Y and the other half the other. Wait, no, since Y is only present in males, activating it wouldn't fit. Because activating Y isn't a thing in humans. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Inactivated X, males sterile. Hmm, wait. In males, both X's are active, so if both are active, wouldn't they be fertile? Oh wait, no, wait. When both Xs are active, that means both cells can produce gametes. So if in a male, both Xs are active, wouldn't he be fertile? So how can an inactivated X lead to sterility?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The Barr body is when both X chromosomes are inactivated in females. So females with Barr bodies (inactivated Xs) can't reproduce, hence sterile. But for males, if both Xs are active, they can produce gametes, so they are not sterile. So I think that option I is incorrect because it says males are sterile, but in reality, they aren't. So I's wrong.

Option J: Inactivated X, resulting in female being sterile. That makes sense. Because if both Xs are inactive, the female can't produce viable gametes. So J is correct.

So reviewing the options, J is the correct one.

The Barr body refers to the inactivation of both X chromosomes in females, leading to sterility. This is because, in normal cases, one X is active and the other is inactive. When both are inactive, females cannot produce viable gametes and are therefore sterile. 

Option J correctly describes this process: "It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in females with half their cells having one X inactivated and the other half of their cells having the other X inactivated." This accurately reflects the biological consequence of inactivation.

ANSWER: J
