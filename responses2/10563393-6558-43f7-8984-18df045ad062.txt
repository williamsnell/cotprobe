Okay, so I've got this question about matrices and their traces. Let me try to think through each part step by step. The question is about three statements (I, II, III) and whether they're true or not. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick which combination is correct.

First, let me recall what the trace of a matrix is. The trace, Tr(A), is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix. It's a scalar value, and some properties involve how the trace behaves when matrices are multiplied or added.

Statement I: The trace of A squared is nonnegative. Hmm. So I need to determine if Tr(A²) is always ≥ 0. Let's think about some examples. 

Take a simple 1x1 matrix: A = [a]. Then A² is [a²], so Tr(A²) is a², which is always nonnegative. That's true for a single element matrix.

But what about larger matrices? Let's take a 2x2 matrix. Suppose A has eigenvalues 2 and -1. Then A² would have eigenvalues 4 and 1, so Tr(A²) = 5, which is positive. But wait, what if A is not diagonal? Let's take a real 2x2 matrix where A² has a negative trace. Wait, no—if A is a real matrix, then its eigenvalues are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. So A²'s eigenvalues would be squares of the eigenvalues of A. If A has eigenvalues with negative squares, that can't happen because squares are nonnegative. Wait, no. For example, if A has eigenvalues 3 and -4, then A² has eigenvalues 9 and 16, so Tr(A²) is 25, which is positive. So maybe for any real matrix, Tr(A²) is nonnegative. 

Wait, what about a real matrix with eigenvalues 1 and -1. Then A² would have 1 and 1, so Tr(A²) is 2, which is positive. So perhaps statement I is always true. I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Another approach: The trace of a square is the sum of eigenvalues squared. Since squares are nonnegative, the trace of A squared is the sum of nonnegative numbers, so it's nonnegative. So statement I is true. Okay, so I is true.

Statement II: If A squared equals A, then the trace of A is nonnegative. So A² = A. What does that imply about A? Well, that equation means A is idempotent. Idempotent matrices have eigenvalues 0 and 1 only. Because when you multiply A by itself, you get A again. So the eigenvalues λ must satisfy λ² = λ. So λ is either 0 or 1. Therefore, the trace of A would be the sum of its eigenvalues. Since each eigenvalue is 0 or 1, the trace is the count of eigenvalues equal to 1. So the trace is nonnegative because it's a sum of non-negative numbers (0 or 1). So statement II is also true. So II is correct.

Statement III: The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B. Hmm, is that true? Let's test it with some matrices. Let's take A as [[1,0],[0,2]] and B as [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then AB is [[1,0],[0,2]], so Tr(AB) is 3. On the other hand, Tr A is 3, Tr B is 2. The product is 6, which is not equal to 3. So statement III is false.

Wait, but maybe I should check another example. Let's try A as the identity matrix. Then Tr A is n (where n is the size, say 2). B can be any matrix such that AB = BA. Wait, but maybe let's pick a different A and B. Let's say A is [[1,0],[0,0]] and B is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Then AB is [[1,0],[0,0]], so Tr AB is 1. Tr A is 1, Tr B is 0. The product is 0, which is not equal to 1. So statement III is false in this case, so it's not always true.

So from the statements:

I is true.

II is true.

III is false.

So looking at the options, which one says I and II are true? Option F is "III only"—no, that's III. Option II is F? Wait, no, options are given as F: III only. Oh wait, no, looking again:

The options are:

A: All of them.

B: I, II and III.

C: I only.

D: I and III only.

E: II, III and I.

F: III only.

G: II only.

H: I and II only.

J: None of them.

Wait, no, in the options, the labels are A to J as given. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: All of them.

B: I, II and III.

C: I only.

D: I and III only.

E: II, III and I.

F: III only.

G: II only.

H: I and II only.

I: II and III only.

J: None of them.

Wait, the statements are I, II, III. So the correct statements are I and II, so option H says I and II only. Therefore, the correct answer is H: I and II only.
</think>

The correct answer is **H: I and II only**.

**Explanation:**
- **Statement I** is true because the trace of a square of a real matrix is the sum of the squares of its eigenvalues, which is nonnegative.
- **Statement II** is true because if \( A^2 = A \), then \( A \) is idempotent, with eigenvalues 0 or 1, making the trace nonnegative.
- **Statement III** is false because trace is not multiplicative; for example, \( \text{Tr}(AB) \neq \text{Tr}(A)\text{Tr}(B) \) in general.

Thus, only statements I and II are true, corresponding to option **H**.
