Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group homomorphisms. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about two statements regarding homomorphisms between groups and whether they're necessarily one-to-one.

Statement 1 says, "For any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism of G into G'." Hmm, I remember that homomorphisms are functions that preserve the group operation. But does this always hold? I think it's not necessarily true. For example, if G is the integers (Z) and G' is the integers modulo 2 (Z2), can there be a homomorphism from Z to Z2? Well, yes, because the image of Z under the natural projection (like mod 2) is a homomorphism. But wait, what if G is something like Z4 and G' is something else? Like, maybe G' is a cyclic group of order 2. Can I map Z4 into Z2? Yes, because the image would be a subgroup of Z2 of order 4, but Z2 only has elements of order 2. So the image would have to be trivial, but that's not a surjective homomorphism. Wait, no, if I'm mapping Z4 into Z2, a homomorphism, I can define f(n) = n mod 2. Then f is a group homomorphism because (a + b) mod 2 = (a mod 2) + (b mod 2). So in this case, such a homomorphism exists. But wait, what about if G is a non-trivial group and G' is trivial? Like, if G is any nontrivial group and G' is the trivial group {e}, can there be a homomorphism from G to G'? Well, the only homomorphism would be the trivial map sending every element of G to e. But is that considered a homomorphism? Yes, because the image is a subgroup of G', which is trivial. So in that case, a homomorphism exists. So Statement 1 seems to be asserting that for any G and G', such a homomorphism exists. But wait, is that always the case? For example, what if G is the trivial group and G' is any group? Then the only homomorphism is from the trivial group to G', which is trivial. So it's possible. Hmm, but wait, what if G is the empty group? No, I think the empty group isn't considered here, or maybe it's trivial. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about whether Statement 1 is true or not.

Wait, Statement 1 is saying that for any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism from G to G'. So for any G and G', regardless of their structure, there's a homomorphism. But is that always possible? Let's think of an example where such a homomorphism doesn't exist. Well, consider G as the cyclic group of order 4, Z4, and G' as the cyclic group of order 2, Z2. As I thought before, I can map each element of Z4 to its equivalence mod 2 in Z2, which gives a homomorphism. So that's fine. Another example: suppose G is Z and G' is Z2. Then a homomorphism exists. But what if G is Z and G' is Z3? Then the homomorphism would have to be a group homomorphism from Z to Z3. That's possible, like f(n) = n mod 3. So yes, exists. Wait a second, but what about if G is a non-trivial group and G' is trivial? Like, G is Z4, G' is {e}. Then the only homomorphism is trivial: f(n) = e for all n in Z4. So that's a homomorphism. So in that case, it exists. So perhaps Statement 1 is always true? Or is there a case where it's not possible?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think: For any two groups G and G', is there always a homomorphism from G to G'? I think the answer is yes. Because, for example, the trivial homomorphism exists in all cases. The trivial homomorphism maps every element to the identity element of G'. So regardless of the structure of G and G', you can define a trivial homomorphism. So Statement 1 is true. Because it's always possible to have a trivial homomorphism. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: "Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map." Wait, that doesn't sound right. A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map, but it doesn't necessarily have to be injective. For example, consider the zero homomorphism from any group G to G'. The zero map would send every element of G to the identity element of G'. It's a homomorphism because f(g1 * g2) = e = e * e = f(g1) * f(g2). But it's not injective unless G is the trivial group. So, every homomorphism isn't necessarily one-to-one. So Statement 2 is claiming that, which is False. Because not every homomorphism is injective.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The statement says "every homomorphism is a one-to-one map." So, for a homomorphism f: G â†’ G', if it's a homomorphism, does that mean it must be injective? No, because the kernel could be non-trivial. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity. So, the kernel is a normal subgroup of G. So, f is injective if and only if the kernel is trivial. So, if the kernel is non-trivial, then f is not injective. So, not every homomorphism is injective. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Looking back at the options, I need to find which option has True and False. Let's look at the options:

A: False, False
B: Not enough, False
C: True, True
D: True, False
E: Not enough, True
F: False, True
G: True, Not given
H: Not enough, Not given
I: False, Not given
J: True, Not enough.

So, option D says True, False. So, our conclusion is Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So the correct answer is D.

The analysis is as follows:

- **Statement 1**: A trivial homomorphism exists between any two groups, making it always possible. Hence, it is **True**.
- **Statement 2**: Not every homomorphism is injective (non-trivial kernel). Hence, it is **False**.

The correct option is **D: True, False**.

Answer: D
