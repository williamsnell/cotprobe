Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic waves and time calculation. Hmm, let's see. The question says an electromagnetic wave is radiated at 40 kHz, and it's 60 km away. I need to find the time it takes to reach that point. The options are all in milliseconds, so I have to make sure I get the units right.

Wait, electromagnetic waves are electromagnetic radiation, right? And they move at the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So I can use that. So I need distance divided by speed to get time.

The distance is 60 km, which I should convert into meters. 60 km is 60,000 meters. So time = distance / speed. Let me plug in the numbers: 60,000 meters divided by 3e8 meters per second.

Calculating that: 60000 / 300,000,000. Let's see, 60,000 divided by 300 million. That's 6e4 / 3e8. Simplify, which is (6/3) * (1e4 / 1e8) = 2 * 1e-4, so 0.0002 seconds. Wait, 0.0002 seconds is 0.2 milliseconds because 1 millisecond is 0.001 seconds. So 0.0002 seconds is 0.2 milliseconds.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.2 milliseconds. So the answer should be F.

To determine the time taken by an electromagnetic wave to travel 60 km at 40 kHz, we use the formula:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}
\]

The distance is 60 km, which converts to 60,000 meters. The speed of light is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Plugging in the values:

\[
t = \frac{60,000}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.0002 \, \text{seconds} = 0.2 \, \text{milliseconds}.
\]

The correct answer is **F: 0.2 msec**.

Answer: F
