Question:

A man died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter "to share and share alike as tenants in common. "At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The son, because he has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses since 1985.
B: The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.
C: The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.
D: The daughter, because the brother did not take any legal action to claim the property until 2010.
E: Both, because they were given the estate "to share and share alike as tenants in common."
F: The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.
G: The daughter, because the brother did not request any rent or other compensation for the past 25 years.
H: The son, because the daughter has not shown any interest in the property.
I: The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.
J: The son, because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

So, a man died in 1985, and his will says to "share and share alike as tenants in common." The estate is in a Midwestern state, and the daughter lived in a different part ( midterm) while the son resided in the southwest. After the funeral, the daughter came back but the son took the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and paid taxes and maintenance. The daughter is generally aware but hasn't pressed the brother for the property. Since 1985, they've been dealing with disputes. The state has a 20-year adverse possession statute. The son wants to claim fee simple absolute title. 

I need to determine who wins if the son sues the daughter for the property. The options are A to J.

First, I'll break down what each part of the question means.

The will says to "share and share alike as tenants in common." That sounds like a tenancy in common, which is a common law concept. In tenancy in common law, tenants are responsible for paying their own share of property taxes and other expenses. They can't claim the entire title unless they've made the necessary arrangements.

In this case, the son and daughter are tenants in common. The state has an adverse possession statute. Adverse possession is when another person takes ownership of a property without the consent of the current owner and that takes more than a reasonable amount of time (usually 20 years). 

So, when the son took the property, he didn't take any rent or compensation. He just paid taxes and maintenance. But the daughter hasn't pressed him about it, and the son is now suing her for the first time.

The question is whether the son's actions constitute sufficient performance to satisfy the adverse possession statute. The options talk about reasons why the son wins.

Looking at the options:

A: Son because he paid since 1985. But the statute requires more than 20 years of occupancy without rent or compensation. The son only lived in the property for maybe a few years, unless the son has been living there for over 20 years. But the question says he paid since 1985, but the timeline isn't given. So this might not be the reason.

B: Son because the parties' actions indicate intent. This seems a bit vague. How does that indicate intent? Maybe if they intended to leave, but I'm not sure.

C: Daughter because brother didn't take action. But the statute is about the brother's actions, not the daughter's. The daughter's actions don't matter for the statute.

D: Daughter because brother didn't take rent. But the statute is about the brother's actions, not about the daughter's. The daughter's actions don't impact the statute.

E: Son because over 20 years. If the son has lived in the estate for more than 20 years, and no rent, then he's in adverse possession. But the question says he paid since 1985, but the time period is not specified. Unless it's more than 20 years since 1985, which would be 1985 plus 20 years is 2005. So if the son moved in after 2005, then yes. But if he moved in before, then no.

F: Son because past 25 years. The statute is 20 years. So 25 years would satisfy it. So the son has lived for more than 25 years, so that's likely.

G: Daughter because brother didn't request rent for past 25 years. But the statute is about the brother's actions, not the daughter's. The daughter's actions don't affect the statute.

H: Son because daughter didn't show interest. But in a tenancy in common, the tenant doesn't have to show interest unless the other tenant has certain actions. But this option doesn't seem to address the statute.

I: Daughter because one can't acquire by adverse possession against another. But the statute is about the brother's actions against the daughter's. So the daughter can't acquire by the statute, but the statute doesn't affect the son. Unless the son's actions are enough, but this isn't the case.

J: Son because he lived more than 20 years. So if he's lived in the estate for more than 20 years, that fulfills the requirement for an adverse possession.

So, the options are about why the son wins. The son's actions might be sufficient if he has lived in the property for more than 20 years and paid no rent. 

Looking at the options, E says "son because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years." But the son hasn't specified the exact time. However, the question states that the son "put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses." But the time period isn't given, so perhaps the issue is the 20-year requirement, which is option F.

Wait, the question says the son claims fee simple absolute title. The statute is about when the son can claim. The statute requires more than 20 years of occupancy without rent. So, if the son has lived in the estate for over 20 years, that would satisfy the statute. 

But the options don't directly state "son because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years." Let me check the options.

Looking:

E: "The son, because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years." 

But wait, no, the exact wording is: "because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years." But the question is, based on the information given, is the son's action sufficient?

The estate is in a Midwestern state. The son has claimed the property and has paid taxes and maintenance. The daughter is generally aware but hasn't pressed the brother.

The statute is an adverse possession statute, which requires more than 20 years without rent. The son's actions (no rent, paid taxes) but unless he has lived for more than 20 years, the statute doesn't apply. So the question is whether the son has lived for more than 20 years.

But the question says, "the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself." The son is suing because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years.

Alternatively, if the son has lived in the property for more than 20 years, that's enough. So in the options, E is talking about living for more than 20 years. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I don't see an option that says that. Wait, let me recheck:

Options:

A: 1985 plus 20 is 2005.

B: The acts indicate intent.

C: Daughter didn't take action.

D: Daughter didn't take rent.

E: Son because more than 20 years.

F: More than 25 years.

So the question is, does the son's presence for more than 20 years satisfy the statute?

So, the correct answer would be E, but wait, in the options, option E says he has lived in the property for more than 20 years, which is the basis for the statute.

So the son's action is based on living in for more than 20 years. So if the son has, then E is correct.

But wait, in the options, option E is phrased as "he has lived in the property for more than 20 years" to claim the fee simple absolute. So that's the correct reasoning.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The son claims fee simple absolute title to the estate because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years, which satisfies the adverse possession statute. The son's actions, while he paid taxes and maintenance, are sufficient to meet the statute's requirement of more than 20 years of occupancy without rent or compensation. 

Answer: E
