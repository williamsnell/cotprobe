Okay, so I have this question about polyomaviruses and how they're detailed. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that polyomaviruses are a group of viruses that infect various organisms, including plants and animals. They're called polyomaviruses because their capsid structures are made up of multiple monomeric units. Each unit is a 20- or 22- residue protein, which is why they're called polyomaviruses.

Now, the question is asking about how they're detailed. The options are A to D. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Shot gun sequencing. I think shot gun sequencing is a method used in genomics to sequence a large number of DNA or RNA molecules quickly by breaking them into small fragments. It's pretty efficient but isn't as precise as other methods. I'm not sure if it's used for polyomaviruses though. They are more about protein capsids, maybe using techniques like mass spectrometry or X-ray crystallography.

Option B: Cultivation in human neural cells. Wait, human neural cells are usually used in virology for things like antiviral studies. I'm not sure if they're used to detail polyomaviruses. They might be used for cell lysis or to detect viral proteins, but not for detailed sequencing of the virus.

Option C: Deep pyro sequencing (NGS). Deep pyro sequencing refers to using pyrolysis and sequencing techniques, especially with X-ray crystallography. This is a precise method for determining the structure of viral capsids. So, I think deep pyro sequencing is a way to detail the structure of polyomaviruses.

Option D: Monoclonal antibody techniques. These are used to identify specific viral proteins. Like how antibodies can detect specific epitopes. But how does that detail the virus as a whole? It probably doesn't provide a complete picture. It's more about recognizing specific parts, not the whole structure.

So, putting it together. The question is about how new polyomaviruses are detailed. Deep pyro sequencing is a method that looks at the structure of the viral capsid. So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is C: Deep pyro sequencing (NGS). This method is used to detail the structure of viral capsids, such as those of polyomaviruses, by analyzing their protein components. 

Answer: C
