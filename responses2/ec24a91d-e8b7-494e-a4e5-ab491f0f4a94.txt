Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: A sample of 4.50 g of methane occupies 12.7 dm³ at 310 K. Calculate the work done when the gas expands isothermally against a constant external pressure of 200 Torr until its volume has increased by 3.3 dm³. Then I have to choose the correct answer from options A to J.

So, the given values are:
- Mass of methane (CH4) = 4.50 g
- Initial volume (V1) = 12.7 dm³
- Temperature (T) = 310 K
- External pressure (P_ext) = 200 Torr
- Change in volume (ΔV) = +3.3 dm³ (since it's expanding, so work done by the gas would be positive, but I think the question is about the work done on the system, which would be negative.)

Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says "work done when the gas expands..." So, work done by the system is positive. But the question is asking for the work done, which I think is the work done by the gas. Or perhaps it's the work done on the gas (like in expansion against the external pressure).

Wait, I need to remember the sign conventions in thermodynamics. The work done by the system (expansion) is positive when work is done on the surroundings, so the system loses energy. But sometimes, in equations, the work done by the system is considered negative. Hmm, this can get confusing. Let me think.

The first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So, when the system does work on the surroundings (expansion), w is negative. Because the system is losing energy.

Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as w = -P_ext * ΔV when the process is against constant external pressure. Oh wait, that's when the pressure is constant, and the volume changes. So if the gas expands at constant pressure, the work is P_ext * (V_final - V_initial) but the sign depends on whether it's expansion or compression.

Wait, but in this problem, it's an isothermal expansion against a constant external pressure until the volume increases by 3.3 dm³. So the process is isothermal, meaning T is constant. The gas is allowed to expand until its volume increases by 3.3 dm³. So the final volume V2 is V1 + 3.3. V1 is 12.7, so V2 is 16 dm³.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "until its volume has increased by 3.3 dm³." So no, wait: the initial volume is 12.7, so the final would be 12.7 +3.3 = 16 dm³. So the system expands from 12.7 to 16 dm³. But wait, the problem says it "expands isothermally against a constant external pressure until its volume has increased by 3.3 dm³." So that's correct. So the process is from V1 to V2 = V1 +3.3.

Now, the external pressure is given as 200 Torr. I think I need to convert that into Pascals or Pounds per square inch (psi), since the standard unit for work in these problems is usually in joules, which come from SI units.

Wait, the formula for work when the pressure is constant is w = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, wait. It depends on whether the expansion is against a constant external pressure. Oh, right, because when a gas expands against a constant external pressure, the work done is P_ext * (V_final - V_initial), but with a negative sign because it's done by the gas, and the system loses energy.

Wait, but the sign conventions can be tricky. Let me clarify. The work done by the gas during expansion is positive, so the work done (w) is negative in the equation ΔU = q + w. Because the system loses energy.

So the work done by the gas (w) is P_ext * (V_final - V_initial), but since the system is expanding, the work is positive for the surroundings (from the system's perspective, it's negative). So the work done is negative in the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for work: w = -P_ext * (V2 - V1). Since the system is expanding, V2 > V1, so (V2 - V1) is positive. But the work done by the system is positive, so the work done on the system would be negative. So the work done by the system is P_ext * (V2 - V1). So in the first law, that would be positive, so q would be negative if the internal energy change is zero (which it isn't), but in this problem, the internal energy change isn't given. So the main point is to calculate the work done by the system, which would be positive.

Wait, but the question is about work done when the gas expands. So the work done by the gas is positive. But the problem says, "calculate the work done when the gas expands..." which I think refers to the work done by the system (expansion work). So the work done by the system is positive, and the work done on the system is negative.

So, to find the work done by the system, the formula is w = -P_ext * (V2 - V1). But wait, no, another way to think: in expansion, the system is doing work on the surroundings. So the system loses energy; hence, q is negative. But since the problem doesn't give any specific q, perhaps we can calculate w.

Wait, but no, the problem is asking for the work done when the gas expands. So the work is the work done by the gas, which is positive since it's expanding. So the equation would be w = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial), but wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. No, wait. Let me think about the formula again. If the system expands against an external pressure, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. But wait, no, that's not correct because it's done under expansion, so the work is actually P_ext multiplied by the change in volume, but the sign depends on whether the system is expanding or not.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think: for expansion at constant external pressure, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. But wait, the formula is w = -P_ext (V2 - V1) because the work is done by the system. So the work is positive when the system expands (V2 > V1) and P_ext is positive.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's think about the formula for work when the pressure is constant. The correct formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Because when the system expands (ΔV positive), the work done by the system is positive, but in the equation, it's subtracted. So when ΔV is positive, work done by the system is positive, so the system's internal energy decreases. So in the formula, w is negative, since it's work done on the system.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled here. Let's take it step by step. The work done by the system is the energy that leaves the system. So when the system expands, it does work on the surroundings. So the system loses energy, so the system's internal energy decreases. So the work done by the system is positive, so in the first law, it's q (heat) plus w (work done by system, positive) equals ΔU.

Alternatively, the first law is written as ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So if the system expands, work is done by the system, so w (work on system) is negative. So in that case, the work done on the system is negative, and the work done by the system is positive.

But in this problem, perhaps the question is about the work done by the system, which would be the work done against the external pressure. So the formula is w = -P_ext (V2 - V1) when pressure is constant. Wait, let me get that right.

Wait, no. The correct formula for work when the external pressure is constant is w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). Because when the system expands (V_final > V_initial), the work done by the system is positive, so the work done on the system is negative. So the work done by the system is positive, and in the formula, it's subtracted.

Wait no, perhaps the correct formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV, where ΔV is V_final - V_initial. So when V_final > V_initial (expansion), ΔV is positive, so the work done by the system is positive. So the work done on the system is negative.

But the problem is asking for the work done when the gas expands. So it's the work done by the system.

So, let's compute ΔV first. The initial volume is 12.7 dm³, final is 12.7 +3.3 = 16 dm³. So ΔV = 16 -12.7 = 3.3 dm³.

Wait, but the units need to be in the same units as the pressure. The pressure is given in Torr, and 1 atm is about 760 Torr. So let's convert 200 Torr to Pascals or to atmospheres.

But since the formula for work uses pressure in Pascals (since 1 J = 1 Pa·m³), maybe I should convert Torr to Pascals.

Wait, 1 Torr is equal to 1/760 atm. So 200 Torr is (200/760) atm.

But perhaps it's easier to convert Torr directly to Pascals. Let me recall the conversion: 1 Torr is 133.322 Pa. So 200 Torr = 200 * 133.322 ≈ 26,664.4 Pa.

Wait, that's a lot. Let me confirm: 1 Torr is approximately 133.322 Pa. So 200 Torr = 200 * 133.322 ≈ 26,664.4 Pa.

Hmm, but wait, I think the correct conversion is 1 Torr is 133.322 Pa. So 200 Torr = 200 * 133.322 ≈ 26,664.4 Pa. So that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes they use 1 atm = 760 Torr, and 1 atm = 101325 Pa. So 1 Torr = 101325 / 760 ≈ 133.322 Pa. So yeah, correct.

So now, the pressure is 26,664.4 Pa.

The volume change is 3.3 dm³. But 1 dm³ is 1 liter, which is 0.001 m³. So 3.3 dm³ = 0.0033 m³.

Now, the formula for work done when pressure is constant is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). So substituting, since V_final is 16 dm³ and V_initial is 12.7 dm³, ΔV = 3.3 dm³.

So w = - P_ext * ΔV.

So w = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³). Wait no, units. The pressure is in Torr, but we need to convert it to Pascals or to something compatible with m³.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert Torr to Pascals and then to J.

Wait, 1 Pa = 1 N/m². So perhaps, to find the work in joules, I can calculate the pressure in Pascals, multiply by the volume change in m³, and multiply by negative one.

Wait, no, the formula is w = -P (in Pa) * ΔV (in m³).

So let's compute that.

First, convert 200 Torr to Pa:

200 Torr * (1 Pa / 133.322 Torr) ≈ 200 / 133.322 = approximately 1.5007 Pa.

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 1 Torr is about 133.322 Pa. So 200 Torr is 200 * 133.322 = 26,664.4 Pa. So that's correct.

So, the pressure in Pascals is 26,664.4 Pa.

Now, ΔV is 3.3 dm³ = 0.0033 m³.

So the work is:

w = - P * ΔV = - (26,664.4 Pa) * (0.0033 m³) = - (26,664.4 * 0.0033) J.

Let me compute 26,664.4 * 0.0033:

26,664.4 * 0.0033 ≈ 87.866 J (because 26,664 * 0.0033 is about 87.866).

So w ≈ -87.866 J. But the options are in whole numbers. Hmm, but wait, the answer options are in 10s of J. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is w = P_ext (V_final - V_initial) but with a negative sign since it's work done by the system.

Wait, that's the same as before. So perhaps I shouldn't have converted the Torr to Pascals. Maybe the formula can be done using Torr and dm³?

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the work using the formula w = -P_ext (V2 - V1) * something, but let's see.

Wait, another way: work done against a constant external pressure is w = -P_ext * ΔV, where ΔV is in the same units as P_ext. So if P_ext is in Pascals (Pa) and ΔV is in m³, then work is in Joules.

So, the calculation would be correct as before.

But wait, let me check the conversion again. 200 Torr is correct as 200 * 133.322 = 26,664.4 Pa.

So, 26,664.4 * 0.0033 = let's compute that.

26,664 * 0.0033:

26,664 * 0.003 = 79.992

26,664 * 0.0003 = 7.9992

Adding together: 87.9912 J.

So w ≈ -87.99 J. That's approximately -88 J.

Looking at the options, option A is -88 J.

But wait, the question is about the work done when the gas expands. So is this work positive or negative?

Wait, in the context of the system, when the gas expands, it's pushing against the external pressure, so the system does work on the surroundings, which means the work done by the system is positive. So the work done on the system is negative, but the work done by the system is positive.

But in the equation, w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if the system is expanding, ΔV is positive, so w is negative, meaning work is done on the system. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should think again.

Wait, the formula is w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). So, for expansion, ΔV = V_final - V_initial = +3.3 dm³. So w = -(P_ext) * (3.3) = - (200 Torr) * 3.3 dm³.

Wait, but using units: the pressure is in Torr, but when converted to Pascals, that's correct. So the calculation is as before.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the sign. No, the formula is correct. So the work done by the system is negative, meaning it's work done on the system. But the question is about the work done by the system, which is positive in magnitude.

So, in the problem, the work done when the gas expands is the external work done on the system, which is positive, but the work done by the system is negative. So the work done (by the system) is -88 J.

But looking at the options, option A is -88 J.

But wait, the options list some possibilities. The calculation gives -88 J, which is option A. But wait, the question is about the work done when the gas expands. So perhaps the formula should be w = P_ext * ΔV, but with a negative sign.

Wait, no, the formula is w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial).

So in this case, V_final is 16 dm³, V_initial is 12.7, so ΔV is +3.3.

So w = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³).

But wait, again, the units are in Torr. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the work in terms of Torr and dm³.

Wait, another approach: work done against a constant external pressure is w = P_ext (V_final - V_initial) [but it's negative, since the system does work].

Wait, no. Wait, the first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is work done on the system. So, in this case, the system is doing work, so w is negative. So, w = - P_ext * (V_final - V_initial).

So, in this case, V_final - V_initial is +3.3, so w = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³).

But this gives w = - (200 *3.3) Torr*dm³. But Torr*dm³ is not a standard unit for work.

Wait, I think this approach is not correct. The correct unit approach would be to use Pascals and convert dm³ to m³.

So, let's proceed with that.

So, the work done by the system is w = - P (Pa) * ΔV (m³). So, P is 26,664.4 Pa, ΔV is 0.0033 m³. So, 26,664.4 * 0.0033 = 87.866 J. So w = -87.866 J. Rounded to -88 J.

So that's option A.

But wait, another approach: the work can be calculated using the formula for work done when pressure is constant. The formula is w = -P_ext (V2 - V1), but wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula differently. The work done by the system is w = P_ext * (V_initial - V_final) if the process is expansion, but I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is w = (P_ext) * (V_final - V_initial), but with a negative sign because it's work done by the system.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

So, in this problem, the work done by the system is w = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³). So, converting that to J.

But wait, let's calculate:

200 Torr = 200 * 133.322 Pa ≈ 26,664.4 Pa.

ΔV = 3.3 dm³ = 0.0033 m³.

So, w = - (26,664.4 Pa) * (0.0033 m³) = -87.866 J.

So, the work done by the system is approximately -88 J. But the question is asking for the work done when the gas expands. So the work done by the gas is positive 88 J, but the work done on the gas is negative 88 J.

Wait, but the options are in terms of work done by the system. So the correct answer is -88 J.

Looking back, the options are:

A) -88 J

B) -103 J

C) -114 J

D) -123 J

So, the correct answer is A) -88 J.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because when the system expands, the work done by the system is positive, but in terms of the first law, the work is part of the internal energy change.

So, if the system is expanding, the internal energy decreases, so the work done by the system is positive (so the system loses energy), which would be why the first law equation would have a negative w.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the system's perspective. When the system expands, it does work on the surroundings. So the system's internal energy decreases, so the work done by the system is positive (from the system's perspective), but from the surroundings' perspective, it's a negative work.

So, in the equation, it would be written as:

ΔU = q + w,

where w is the work done on the system. So, if the system expands, w is negative.

But the question is about the work done when the gas expands. So it's the work done by the system, which is positive.

So, in that case, w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial) = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³) ≈ -88 J.

So the work done by the system is positive 88 J, but the work done on the system is negative 88 J.

But the question is about the work done, so in the equation, it's w, which is the work done on the system. Wait, no. The work done by the system is the work done on the surroundings. So in the equation, the work done on the system is -w, where w is the work done by the system.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it from the basic principles.

The first law is ΔU = q + w,

where w is work done on the system.

If the system does work on the surroundings, then w is negative.

So, the work done by the system is positive, and w is negative.

In the problem, the question is about the work done when the gas expands. So, the work done by the system is positive, and the work done on the system is negative.

So, if I calculate the work done by the system, it's positive, and it's equal to the negative of what I calculate using the formula.

So, let's calculate the work done by the system: w = - P_ext (V_final - V_initial) = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³).

So, that's - (200 * 133.322) * 3.3 / 1000 J.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute it in terms of Torr and dm³.

Wait, another approach: Work done = P (atm) * (V_final - V_initial) * 101.325 J/(L·atm).

Wait, but let's think about it.

1 atm = 101.325 kJ, and 1 L = 0.001 m³.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the work using the formula in terms of Torr and dm³.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to compute the work in Torr·dm³ and then convert to J.

Wait, 1 L is 1 dm³, and 1 atm = 101.325 kJ.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for work done against a constant pressure is w (in J) = (P (atm) * V (dm³)) * 101.325 J/(L·atm).

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

w = P (atm) * V (dm³) * (101.325 J/(L·atm)).

But wait, 1 L = 0.001 m³, so converting L to m³.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is w = P (atm) * V (dm³) * (101.325 J/(L·atm)) * (1 m³ / 1000 dm³).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

w = P (atm) * V (dm³) * (101.325 J/(L·atm)) * (1 dm³ / 1000 cm³) * (1 cm³ / 1 mL) * (1 mL / 0.001 L).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me approach it step by step.

First, we can compute the work done in terms of Torr and dm³, then convert to J.

The formula for work done against a constant pressure is:

w = P (atm) * V (L) * 101.325 J/(L·atm).

But wait, if the pressure is given in Torr, then we can convert that to atm first.

So, 200 Torr = 200 / 760 atm ≈ 0.263158 atm.

Wait, no: 1 Torr = 1/760 atm, so 200 Torr = (200/760) atm = 200/760 = (200 ÷ 760) = 0.2631578947 atm.

So, 0.2631578947 atm.

Then, V is in dm³. Convert V to liters: 1 dm³ = 1 liter, so V = 3.3 L.

So, w = P (atm) * V (L) * 101.325 J/(L·atm).

So, w = 0.2631578947 atm * 3.3 L * 101.325 J/(L·atm).

Compute this:

First, multiply 0.2631578947 by 3.3.

0.2631578947 * 3.3 ≈ 0.868326.

Then, multiply by 101.325.

0.868326 * 101.325 ≈ 87.93 J.

So, approximately 87.93 J.

But wait, the work done by the system is positive in this formula. So, the work done by the system is +87.93 J.

But according to the first law, ΔU = q + w.

Here, w is the work done on the system. So, if the system does work on the surroundings, w is negative.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, the first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system.

So, if the system does work on the surroundings, then w is negative.

So, in this problem, the system is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings. So w is negative.

So, the work done by the system is positive 87.93 J, but the work done on the system is negative 87.93 J.

But the question is about the work done when the gas expands. So, the work done by the system is positive, which is 87.93 J, which is approximately 88 J.

Looking at the options, option A is -88 J.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is about the work done by the system, which is positive 88 J, but the question may have a sign convention that I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps the work done by the system is w, and the work done on the system is -w.

So, if the system does work on the surroundings, the work done on the system is negative.

So, if the system is expanding, the work done on the system is negative.

So, in that case, the work done by the system is positive 88 J, which would be option A.

But the question is about the work done when the gas expands. So, the work done by the system is positive 88 J, which is option A.

But wait, the options don't have 88 J. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are:

A) -88 J

B) -103 J

C) -114 J

D) -123 J

So, the correct answer is A) -88 J.

Wait, but in this case, the work done by the system is positive 88 J, but the problem is asking about the work done, which is positive. So, why is the answer negative?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The formula is w = -P_ext (V_final - V_initial).

So, in this problem, V_final is 16 dm³, V_initial is 12.7 dm³, so ΔV = +3.3 dm³.

So, w = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³).

So, w = - (200 * 3.3) Torr·dm³.

But we need to convert Torr·dm³ to J.

Wait, 1 Torr·dm³ is equal to approximately 11.62 J.

Wait, let me calculate 200 Torr·dm³:

200 * 11.62 = 2324 J.

Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me find the correct conversion.

Wait, 1 Torr·dm³ = 133.322 Pa * 1 m³ = 133.322 J.

Wait, no, 1 Pa·m³ is 1 J.

So, 1 Torr·dm³ = 133.322 J.

So, 200 Torr·dm³ = 200 * 133.322 J = 26,664.4 J.

So, w = -26,664.4 J.

So, the work done by the system is -26,664.4 J, which is approximately -26,664 J.

But this is way higher than any of the options, which are in the low hundreds of J.

Wait, so this suggests that I'm making a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong. Maybe the formula is w = P_ext (V_initial - V_final) (with a negative sign).

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is w = P_ext (V_initial - V_final).

Wait, let me think again. Let's consider the first law.

ΔU = q + w,

where w is the work done on the system.

If the system does work on the surroundings, w is negative.

So, in this problem, the system is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings, so w is negative.

So, if I can calculate w, the work done on the system, then the work done by the system is -w.

So, the work done by the system is w_system = -w.

So, how do I calculate w?

The formula for work done against a constant external pressure is w = -P_ext (V_final - V_initial).

So, let's compute that.

w = - (200 Torr) * (16 dm³ - 12.7 dm³) = - (200 Torr) * (3.3 dm³) = -660 Torr·dm³.

Now, I need to convert Torr·dm³ to joules.

We know that 1 Torr·dm³ = 133.322 J.

So, 660 Torr·dm³ = 660 * 133.322 J = 87,991 J.

So, w = -87,991 J, which is approximately -88,000 J.

But none of the options are that low. The options are all in the low hundreds of J.

Hmm, that suggests that I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is given in atm, not Torr.

Wait, let me re-calculate the pressure in atm.

200 Torr = 200 / 760 atm ≈ 0.2631578947 atm.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but if the formula uses pressure in atm, then:

w = - (P (atm)) * (V_final - V_initial) * (101.325 J/(L·atm)).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the formula is w = P (atm) * (V_final - V_initial) * 101.325 J/(L·atm).

Wait, let me double-check this.

In the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

1 atm = 101.325 kJ.

And 1 L = 0.001 m³.

Wait, so, 1 L·atm = 0.001 m³·1 atm = 101.325 kJ * 0.001 m³ = 101.325 J.

So, 1 L·atm = 101.325 J.

So, 1 atm = 101.325 kJ.

So, 1 atm = 101,325 J.

So, 1 atm = 101,325 J.

So, 1 L·atm = 101.325 J.

So, to convert Torr·dm³ to J, we can use the following approach.

1 Torr = 133.322 Pa.

1 Pa = 1 Pa.

1 dm³ = 0.001 m³.

So, 1 Torr·dm³ = 133.322 Pa * 0.001 m³ = 0.133322 J.

So, 1 Torr·dm³ = 0.133322 J.

So, 200 Torr·dm³ = 200 * 0.133322 J ≈ 26.6644 J.

So, 200 Torr·dm³ = 26.6644 J.

So, w = -26.6644 J.

So, the work done by the system is -26.6644 J.

Wait, but this is way lower than any of the options given. The options are in the hundreds of J.

Wait, so perhaps the formula is incorrect. Maybe I should think about the formula as w = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial), without the negative sign.

So, in that case, w = 200 Torr * 3.3 dm³.

But units are not compatible. Torr is a unit of pressure, and dm³ is a unit of volume.

So, 1 Torr = 133.322 Pa, 1 Pa = 1 N/m², 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 dm³ = 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm = 1000 cm³ = 10 L.

Wait, let me compute the conversion.

1 Torr = 133.322 Pa.

1 Pa = 1 N/m².

1 m³ = 1000 L.

So, 1 Torr·m³ = 133.322 N/m² * 1 m³ = 133.322 N·m = 133.322 J.

So, 1 Torr·m³ = 133.322 J.

So, 1 Torr·dm³ = 133.322 J / 10 = 13.3322 J.

So, 200 Torr·dm³ = 200 * 13.3322 J = 2666.44 J.

So, w = -2666.44 J.

So, the work done by the system is -2666.44 J, which is approximately -2666 J.

Again, this is not in line with the options given, which are in the hundreds of J.

So, perhaps the problem is in the setup. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states: "A sample of 4.50 g of methane gas is contained in a rigid, 298.15 L container. Is there any change in the volume when the gas expands?"

Wait, perhaps the question is about the work done when the gas expands, not the work done by the system.

But the question is: "Calculate the work done by the gas when the gas expands." So, that's the work done by the system, which is the work done on the surroundings.

But according to the formula, that work done is negative.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the work done by the gas as positive, so the answer would be positive, but according to the options, it's a negative number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the work done in the opposite direction, so the negative result is correct.

So, in the problem, the work done by the gas is negative, which would be option A: -88 J.

Wait, but that's not matching our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again. So, according to the formula, the work done by the system is negative.

But the problem is asking for the work done by the gas when it expands. So, the gas does work on the surroundings, so the work done by the gas is positive.

But according to the formula, the work done by the system is negative.

So, this suggests that the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is w = P_ext (V_initial - V_final).

In that case, w = 200 Torr * (12.7 - 16) dm³ = 200 Torr * (-3.3) dm³ = -660 Torr·dm³.

Convert that to J:

-660 Torr·dm³ * (133.322 J / 1 Torr·dm³) ) = -660 * 133.322 J = -88,000 J.

Which is the same as our earlier calculation.

So, the work done by the gas is -88,000 J, which is option A.

But since the options don't have that number, perhaps the problem is in the units.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the pressure to be in atm instead of Torr.

If that's the case, how would that work?

So, if the pressure is 1 atm, and the volume change is 3.3 dm³, then:

w = - (1 atm) * (3.3 dm³) * (101.325 J / (L·atm)).

Wait, but how to convert dm³ to L? They are the same.

So, 3.3 dm³ = 3.3 L.

So, w = - (1 atm) * (3.3 L) * (101.325 J / L·atm) ) = -3.3 * 101.325 J = -334.3725 J.

Which is approximately -334 J.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is 1 atm, and the volume change is 3.3 m³.

Wait, but the problem states 3.3 dm³.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is considering the work done as positive, so the answer is positive 88 J, which would be option A.

But that's not the case because the work done by the system is negative.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of pressure in atm and volume in liters.

So, 200 Torr = 200 / 760 atm = 0.2631578947 atm.

Volume change is 3.3 dm³ = 3.3 L.

So, work done by the system is w = - P * ΔV.

So, w = - (0.2631578947 atm) * (3.3 L) = -0.86835 atm·L.

Convert atm·L to J:

1 atm·L = 101.325 J.

So, 0.86835 atm·L = 0.86835 * 101.325 J = 87.89 J.

So, w = -87.89 J.

So, the work done by the gas is approximately -88 J, which is option A.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer is A) -88 J.

But this seems a bit counterintuitive because if the system is expanding, it's doing work on the surroundings, so the work done by the gas should be positive.

Wait, but the formula w = P_ext (V_final - V_initial) gives negative work if the system is expanding.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula w = P_ext (V_initial - V_final), which would give positive work for expansion.

Wait, let's try that.

So, w = P_ext (V_initial - V_final) = 200 Torr * (12.7 - 16) dm³ = 200 Torr * (-3.3) dm³ = -660 Torr·dm³.

Convert to J:

-660 Torr·dm³ * (133.322 J / 1 Torr·dm³) ) = -660 * 133.322 J = -88,000 J.

So, w = -88,000 J.

Which is approximately -88,000 J.

So, the work done by the gas is approximately -88,000 J, which is option A.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula w = P_ext (V_initial - V_final), which gives positive work for expansion, but the options are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula w = P_ext (V_final - V_initial), which gives negative work.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "Calculate the work done by the gas when the gas expands." So, the work done by the gas is positive when the gas expands, and negative when it contracts.

But according to the formula, when the system expands, the work done by the system is negative.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A) -88 J, as per the calculation.

But again, this doesn't align with my earlier calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, let me recalculate the pressure in terms of 1 atm.

200 Torr = (200 / 760) atm = (200 ÷ 760) = 0.2631578947 atm.

So, that's correct.

So, P = 0.2631578947 atm.

Volume change is 3.3 dm³, which is 3.3 L.

So, work done by the system is w = - P ΔV = - (0.2631578947 atm) * (3.3 L) = -0.86835 atm·L.

Convert atm·L to joules:

1 atm·L = 101.325 J.

So, 0.86835 atm·L = 0.86835 * 101.325 J ≈ 87.89 J.

So, w = -87.89 J.

So, approximately -88 J.

So, the correct answer is A) -88 J.
</think>

To determine the work done by the gas when it expands, we use the formula for work done on a system: 

\[
w = - P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{ext}} \) is the external pressure.
- \( \Delta V \) is the change in volume.

### Step 1: Convert Pressure to atm
The given pressure is 200 Torr. To convert to atmospheres:
\[
200 \, \text{Torr} = \frac{200}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 0.2631578947 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 2: Convert Volume to dm³
The change in volume is 3.3 dm³. Since 1 dm³ = 1 L, this doesn't change the value.

### Step 3: Calculate Work Done
Now, plug the values into the work equation:
\[
w = -(0.2631578947 \, \text{atm}) \times (3.3 \, \text{dm}^3)
\]
\[
w = -0.86835 \, \text{atm} \cdot \text{dm}^3
\]

### Step 4: Convert atm·dm³ to Joules
\[
1 \, \text{atm} \cdot \text{dm}^3 = 101.325 \, \text{J}
\]
\[
w = -0.86835 \times 101.325 \, \text{J} \approx -87.89 \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer
The work done by the gas when it expands is approximately **-88 J**.
