Question:

In a frictionless world economy, resources would be perfectly mobile. As it is now, immigration, emigration and capital outflow restrictions severely limit resource mobility. How do the changes in supply and demand, and the consequent price changes, brought about by application of comparative advantage, tend to compensate for the immobility of re- sources .

Options:

A: Trade causes the price of resources to skyrocket
B: Trade causes the price of resources to become more volatile
C: Trade roughly matches up the worldwide demand for resources, with the world-wide supply.
D: Trade leads to a scarcity of resources in regions with comparative disadvantage
E: Trade results in an equal distribution of resources across all countries regardless of supply and demand
F: Trade perpetuates the immobility of resources by creating dependency on imports
G: Trade eliminates the need for resource mobility
H: Trade leads to a surplus of resources
I: Trade consistently reduces the worldwide demand for resources
J: Trade ensures that resources are only allocated to the most developed economies

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about how trade and comparative advantage help compensate for resource immobility in an economy. Let me try to break it down.

First, the scenario is a frictionless world economy, meaning resources can move freely. But now, in reality, there are restrictions like immigration, emigration, and capital outflows. So, the question is about how trade, using comparative advantage, offsets these restrictions.

I remember that comparative advantage is when a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another. So, if one country can produce a good more cheaply, it will specialize in that good. This leads to a trade imbalance where the more resource-rich country exports the good it's better at, and the other imports it.

Wait, the options are about price changes. So, if countries specialize, they can produce more of their good, which should lead to an increase in supply. But when they produce more, and perhaps the demand for that resource increases, what happens to the price?

Let me think. If a country produces more of a good, that might increase demand. But if the world supply increases, and demand increases, the price might go up. However, if the country can get more from the world market, perhaps they can sell their produce at a higher price. But wait, this is a world economy scenario. So, perhaps the supply from the rest of the world increases the supply, leading to a higher price.

Alternatively, if a country specializes in a good, it can trade for it. So, the price of the resource should adjust to reflect the opportunity cost. For example, if one country can produce more of good A, then the price of good A in terms of what else it could produce would be lower than if it didn't specialize. But I'm a bit hazy on this point.

Wait, the question is about compensation for resource immobility. So, without trade, resources would be stuck in their home countries and couldn't move to other places. But trade allows countries to use resources more efficiently. How does that help?

I think that when countries specialize, they can produce more of their goods because they can get resources from other countries. So, the supply of resources increases, but the demand could also increase. So, the price might go up because the supply increases. But wait, if a country is more resource-rich, they might have more resources, so their supply would increase, which would lead to higher prices.

Wait, but the options don't directly talk about prices. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: Trade causes the price of resources to become more volatile. Volatility in price could mean it goes up and down more. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Maybe it's more about the relationship between supply and demand.

Another angle: without trade, resources are fixed in their countries, so when you trade, you can get more of a good by trading it. So, the price of resources should adjust to the opportunity cost. For example, suppose Country A produces more of good X. Because it can't produce good Y as much, the price of X increases relative to Y. But I'm not exactly sure how that plays into the price of resources.

Wait, the options are about the price changes due to trade. Let me think about the impact on resource prices. If a country is more resource-rich, it can produce more resources. So, the world supply increases, which would affect the price. But the question is about how trade helps, not about the direct effect of increased supply.

Alternatively, trade might cause the price of resources to stabilize because countries specialize. But I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is about how trade leads to a shift in resource allocation, which in turn adjusts prices. For example, if a country specializes in a good, the price of that good would decrease because it's more efficient. But then, other countries might import the resources, so the global supply could increase.

Wait, but the options are about how prices are affected. Let's think about what happens when a country uses resources it can get from other countries. So, for example, if country A can import more resources than it can produce, that would increase the global supply of resources. The price of resources would depend on both the supply and demand.

Wait, but the question is about the price changes brought by trade and comparative advantage. So, if a country specializes in a good, it can produce more of it, which can be traded for other goods. If the demand for that good increases, the price goes up. But at the same time, the global supply could increase if other countries import more.

Wait, but that's getting a bit tangled. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose Country X can produce 100 units of good A or 200 units of good B. Country Y can produce 150 units of good A or 300 units of good B. Without trade, each country has to produce both goods. But with trade, they specialize.

Suppose the world demand is 250 units of A and 350 units of B. Country X can produce 100 A and 200 B. Country Y can produce 150 A and 300 B. The total supply would be 250 A and 500 B. But the demand is only 250 A and 350 B, so there would be excess supply of 150 B.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the key point is that with trade, the world supply of a good increases, which would lead to a change in price depending on global demand. However, the question is about compensation for resource immobility.

Wait, the question says that without trade, resources are immobile, so they can't move. Trade allows countries to get resources, so their production increases. So, the price of resources would adjust. For example, if a country specializes in producing a good, the price of that good decreases because it's more efficient. But then, other countries import more, leading to higher supply. So, the price of resources could stabilize.

Wait, but the options don't directly address this. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: Trade causes the price of resources to become more volatile. Volatility might imply that prices fluctuate a lot, but that's probably not the case. The price should adjust based on supply and demand.

Option D: Trade leads to a scarcity of resources in regions with comparative disadvantage. That's not right. Comparative advantage is about who can produce more efficiently, so D is incorrect.

Option F: Trade perpetuates the immobility of resources by creating dependency on imports. Wait, that's opposite. If resources are more mobile, they get used elsewhere. So, this option suggests that trade makes it harder for resources to move, which isn't correct.

Option G: Trade eliminates the need for resource mobility. That's not true because the premise is that resources are mobile in a frictionless world. So, G is incorrect.

Option A: Trade causes the price of resources to skyrocket. No, that's not right. skyrocketing might not be the case.

Option C: Trade roughly matches the worldwide demand. I'm not sure about this. If the world supply increases, and demand increases, the price might rise, but not necessarily match it perfectly. So, this option might not be correct.

Option E: Trade results in an equal distribution across regions. No, that's not the case. If one country is more resource-rich, it would export and import accordingly.

Option I: Trade consistently reduces the worldwide demand. No, because demand would increase as a result of increased production and imports.

Option J: Trade ensures resources are only allocated to top economies. Again, trade allows countries to import resources from others, so this is incorrect.

Option H: Trade leads to a surplus. Surplus of resources would mean more are produced than demanded. But again, without trade, resources are immobile, so trade would cause the surplus.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is about how trade leads to a situation where the world supply and demand balance, meaning the price would adjust to match, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about comparative advantage, each country will specialize in what it's good at. For example, a country where good X is more efficient can trade for good Y at a lower price. But the price of the resources might not change because the resource is transferred. Wait, but the question is about the price of the resource itself, not the transfer.

Wait, perhaps the key is that without trade, resources can't move. But with trade, they can. So, the price of resources would be based on their production. For example, if a country is more resource-rich, its resource prices might be lower relative to others, but this depends on the overall market.

Alternatively, think of it this way: without trade, each country's resources are stuck in their own country. With trade, they can get resources from other countries, so their own prices wouldn't change much. But that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is about the price becoming more volatile. Let's say without trade, prices are fixed. With trade, prices would fluctuate based on demand and supply. For example, a country might produce more resources, which can be sold at a higher price. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option again.

Option B: Trade causes prices to become more volatile. If, for example, a country's production increases, and the demand increases, the price might rise. If the country's own demand increases, its price might rise. But other countries import from it, so the global supply could increase. So, the supply is increasing, which would cause the price to go up. But if the demand is also increasing, perhaps the price doesn't change much.

Alternatively, maybe the price of the resource itself doesn't change because it's traded. But then, why is the trade occurring in the first place? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, another angle: when countries specialize, they produce more of their comparative advantage good. So, the supply of that good increases. However, if the demand for that good also increases, the price will rise. But the question is about the price changes due to trade and comparative advantage helping compensate for resource immobility.

Wait, but if resources can move, their prices should adjust based on production and demand. So, the price of resources should increase because the supply is rising (if demand remains the same). But in the scenario, the world's supply increases because of other countries importing. So, perhaps the supply is increasing, so the price would reflect that.

But the options don't directly discuss this. Let me think of the options again.

Option G: Trade eliminates the need for resource mobility. No, that's the opposite. Trade allows it, so G is incorrect.

Option B: Price becomes more volatile. Volatility could mean it goes up and down a lot. But in reality, prices might stabilize once supply and demand balance.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the price of resources changes because of the trade, and in the process, they can compensate for the immobility. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: If a country specializes, its resources become more abundant. So, for a good that's in higher demand, the price would go up because the supply increases. But that's a positive effect.

Wait, but the question is about compensation. Without trade, countries can't get resources. Trade makes them get them, so why would prices change? Maybe because trade leads to a more efficient allocation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is about the price becoming more volatile because without trade, the prices can't adjust. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the answer is about the price stabilizing because of the increased production and demand.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is about the price matching supply and demand. But I'm not certain.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer must be about how trade allows the supply to increase, leading to price adjustments. So, if trade leads to a situation where supply meets demand (world-wide), that would be option C. But option C says 'roughly matches the worldwide demand for resources, with the world-wide supply.' So, if the world-wide supply equals the demand, that would be a perfect match.

But the question is about how trade brings about compensation. So, perhaps the correct answer is about a situation where the supply and demand are balanced, leading to prices that don't vary much. Or maybe the price adjusts based on the increased production.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to see what each option suggests.

If the answer is B, then trade causes prices to become more volatile. That might not be right because prices would adjust based on production and demand. Alternatively, maybe the prices of resources themselves don't change because they're traded, but the supply increases, leading to a situation where the price reflects the new supply.

Wait, but the options are about the price changes brought by trade and comparative advantage. So, the answer should involve how trade leads to a situation where the world supply and demand balance, leading to a price that doesn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because trade leads to a situation where prices become more volatile due to increased production and demand.

Wait, another approach: without trade, resources are stuck in their home countries. Trade allows countries to export resources and import them, effectively making the world's supply flexible. So, the prices of resources would adjust to match the trade flows.

But I'm not certain. I think I'm going in circles here. Let me consider which answer makes the most sense.

The question says that without the immobility, trade brings about changes in price due to comparative advantage. So, perhaps when a country specializes, it can get more resources from others, which might lead to a situation where the global supply and demand are balanced, leading to prices that don't vary much. Or maybe the prices become more volatile because the supply increases and demand also increases.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: Trade causes the price of resources to become more volatile. Because without trade, prices would be fixed, but with trade, prices adjust based on both production and demand, leading to more volatile prices.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is about the supply and demand balance, leading to a more stable price. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the options, the correct answer is probably B: Trade causes the price of resources to become more volatile. Because without trade, prices are fixed. With trade, they increase due to more production and demand, but maybe it's not the volatility but the equilibrium.

The question examines how trade, leveraging comparative advantage, compensates for the immobility of resources in a frictionless world economy. Without trade, resources would be stuck in their home countries, limiting their mobility. Trade allows countries to specialize in goods where they have a comparative advantage, leading to increased production and trade. This results in a broader supply of resources across the globe. 

The options provided explore various impacts of trade. Option B suggests that trade causes prices to become more volatile, which might imply fluctuations due to increased production and demand. However, the key point is that trade allows for a more balanced supply and demand, leading to a situation where the global supply meets demand, reducing price volatility. 

Option C states that trade roughly matches the worldwide demand for resources with the world-wide supply, implying a balance where supply equals demand. This aligns with the idea that trade facilitates an equilibrium in resource markets, leading to stable prices. 

Thus, the most accurate answer is that trade leads to a situation where the world-wide supply and demand for resources are balanced, resulting in prices that do not vary much. This compensation compensates for the immobility of resources by facilitating trade and market adjustments.
