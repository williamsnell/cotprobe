Okay, so I need to figure out which leader is known for spreading the dharma of non-violence. Hmm, non-violence is a term I remember from a social studies class recently. It's about principles of peace and justice. I think it's also called "the law of non-violence," but I'm not entirely sure. 

Looking at the options, I see options like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, etc. Wait, I think Nelson Mandela is one of the key figures here. He was the president of South Africa and a huge advocate for civil rights. I remember that he's often quoted as saying that the end of war is when non-violence is achieved. That sounds right.

What about Martin Luther King Jr.? He was a civil rights leader too, but I think he's more known for his role in the civil rights movement in the US. Although he was a strong proponent of non-violence, he's not as widely recognized as Mandela for spreading the principles of non-violence globally.

Mother Teresa is another option. She was a Teresa of Le√≥n, known for her work in distributing food, especially to the poor. Her work might have touched on community and social justice, but I'm not sure if she's directly known for non-violence. I think she's more focused on compassion and community, not as much on the principles of non-violence.

Ngo Dinh Diem is a leader of the U.S. military, known as a "Taiwan queen." He's involved in various conflicts, but I don't think he's associated with non-violence. He's more about military expansion and maintaining power.

Adolf Hitler is the one who created the Nazis. He's definitely against non-violence, but he's not the one who spreads it. He's more of a villain in the conflict with the Nazis, but he's not the one who advocates for non-violence.

Vladimir Putin is the current leader of Russia. He's more focused on stability and control, not on non-violence. So probably not that.

Mother Teresa, Siddhartha, or the others are also names I've heard in different contexts. But the question is specifically about non-violence, which I think is best attributed to Mandela.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think again. The question is about the dharma of non-violence. Which is a concept I remember as being central to non-violence. The term might be similar to the concept of the "dharma" in Buddhism, but non-violence is a different approach. Wait, maybe the term dharma refers to the ethical principles in the context of non-violence. So, the leader who promoted these ethical principles would be the correct answer.

So, putting it all together: Nelson Mandela is known for spreading non-violence. He's the one who popularized this concept in South Africa.

The correct answer is Nelson Mandela. He is known for spreading the principles of non-violence, which are central to his approach to peace and justice.
