Question:

A tenant lived in a small apartment building that was owned by a landlord. In July, the landlord was killed in an accident. In August, the tenant brought an action against the administrator of the landlord's state. The tenant alleged that he and the landlord had a contract under the terms of which the landlord was supposed to pay him $50 a week to mow the lawn and perform small maintenance repairs for the other tenants. He claimed that the landlord had not paid him for the past six months. He testified that there was a written contract and that the landlord kept the only copy of it in his home. At trial, he called the landlord's accountant to testify about the contract. The accountant testified that she had seen the contract. She further testified about the terms of the contract, consistent with the tenant's testimony. She testified that the contract, along with many other documents pertaining to the landlord's business, had most likely been destroyed when the landlord's business office was robbed a few months earlier. The trial judge should rule that the accountant's. testimony is

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this evidence law question. Let me read through it again carefully.

So the scenario is: A landlord was killed in an accident in July. Then the tenant, who lived in the apartment, sued the landlord's administrator. The tenant claims that the landlord had a contract where he was supposed to pay $50 a week for mowing the lawn and doing small repairs for other tenants. Specifically, the tenant says he didn't receive payment for the past six months, and he's arguing that the landlord didn't pay. His attorney called the landlord's accountant, who testified that she saw the contract and that it was there, but also that she saw the documents were destroyed when the landlord's business was robbed a few months earlier.

The question is about whether the accountant's testimony is admissible.

Hmm. I remember that evidence admissibility depends on several factors. First, what type of evidence it is. This is a written contract, so that's evidence. Then, is it being used as original evidence? The tenant is suing the landlord's adminstrator. The tenant is using the accountant's testimony as a counterclaim or as a witness in evidence. Wait, sometimes when witnesses testify, they can use their testimony as evidence, but that's more about the witness's credibility, not admissibility. So the question is about the admissibility of the testimony itself.

Wait, the tenant is using the accountant's testimony as a defense. So the question is about whether that testimony is admissible.

Wait, the tenant has already brought a case, so this is a secondary or counterclaim. The question is whether the accountant's testimony is admissible evidence. So, I think the key here is whether the testimony is admissible as evidence of the contract.

Wait, but the tenant is using the accountant's testimony as a defense. So the question is whether the accountant's testimony is admissible as evidence. Alternatively, the question is whether the testimony is admissible as part of the evidence against the landlord.

But wait, the question is phrased as: The tenant's assertion is that the landlord didn't pay for six months. The tenant is using the accountant's testimony as evidence. So the question is whether the accountant's testimony is admissible as evidence.

Wait, but if the tenant's claim is based on the assumption that the contract didn't exist, the tenant is using the accountant's testimony as evidence that the contract didn't exist. So the question is whether that testimony is admissible.

So the possible issues are whether the testimony is hearsay, original, and whether it's admissible in this situation.

So, first, whether it's hearsay. The fact that the landlord's business was robbed a few months earlier is a criminal act. But the testimony is about the contract, which is a written document. So the fact that the business was robbed is a material fact in the circumstances, but is it hearsay? Because the contract was signed by the landlord, which is the party opposing the claim.

Wait, wait. The auditor's rule applies when a party is opposing evidence. The auditor's rule says that evidence that relies on a fact that is material to the outcome of the case is not hearsay. So if the tenant is using the contract as evidence of the absence of payment, then the proof of the contract is hearsay because it's about a fact that is material to the claim.

Wait, but the business being robbed is a prior matter, so is that hearsay?

Wait, the landlord's business being robbed is a matter that occurred before the tenant's claim. So the fact is material to the tenant's case. But the issue is whether the testimony is hearsay.

Alternatively, the business being robbed is a separate matter. So the auditor's rule says that the fact is not hearsay because it's not a material matter in the case. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Hearsay is when evidence is introduced that has an objective basis other than its stated purpose and is not directly opposed to the content of the declarant's statement. The rule is that you can't prove a fact that's hearsay if it's the same as a hearsay fact.

So the business being robbed is a fact that the landlord's business was in a bad shape when he started the business. The rent is based on the assumption that the business is operational. So the business's state of being robbed is a separate matter. But whether that's hearsay.

Wait, the business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim, so it's not directly related to the case. Therefore, the fact that the business was robbed is not hearsay. So the testimony about the contract and the business's condition is not hearsay because the facts are not material to the issue.

Wait, but the business being robbed is a fact that happened before the tenant's claim, so the fact is not material to the issue. Therefore, the business being robbed is not a hearsay fact. So the testimony about the contract and the business's condition is not hearsay.

But wait, the business being robbed is a separate issue. So the fact that the business was robbed is not a material fact in the tenant's case because the tenant is using the contract to prove that the landlord never paid. So the business's condition is not material to the tenant's claim.

So the key here is whether the contract is hearsay. Because the contract is presented as evidence, and the business being robbed is not hearsay, so the contract might not be considered hearsay.

Wait, but the business being robbed is a separate issue. So the fact that the business was robbed is not hearsay because it's not material. Therefore, the testimony that the contract exists is not hearsay.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to rephrase. The business being robbed is a fact that happened a few months prior. It's not material to the tenant's claim because the claim is about the landlord paying $50 a week for six months. So the business's condition is not material to the claim.

But the issue is whether the contract is hearsay. The contract is a written document, made by the landlord. The tenant is relying on the contract to prove the absence of payments. If the business being robbed is a fact that's not relevant to the claim, then it's not hearsay.

But wait, the business being robbed may have some connection. For example, if the business was in a bad state when the landlord started it, maybe the tenant's reliance on the contract is based on the assumption that the business would be operational. So the business being robbed may be a fact that could affect the reliance on the contract. 

Wait, that's a key point. If the business being robbed was in a bad state, then the assumption that the business would be operational is incorrect. But the tenant is using the contract to prove that he didn't receive payments. If the business was in a bad state, perhaps the tenant is relying on the contract for the assumption that it would continue. So the business being robbed could be a fact that affects the reliance on the contract.

But for hearsay, the issue is whether the fact is material and hearsay. So even if the business being robbed was bad, the fact that it was robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim, and is not directly relevant to the claim.

Wait, but the business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim, so it's not material. Because the tenant is using the contract to prove that he didn't receive payments. So the business's condition is not material to the claim.

Wait, but the business being robbed may have occurred before the tenant's claim. The tenant is suing the landlord for not paying, based on the assumption that the contract would have been honored. But if the landlord's business was in bad shape, then the assumption that it would continue is incorrect. So the business being robbed is a fact that could affect the tenant's reliance on the contract.

But wait, the business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim. If the tenant relied on the contract for the assumption that the business would continue, then if the business was in bad condition, the reliance is invalid. But since the business being robbed is a fact that happened before the claim, the fact is not material.

So, the business being robbed is not a material fact, so it's not hearsay. Therefore, the contract is not hearsay because the business being robbed is not a material fact. Therefore, the testimony is not hearsay.

Wait, but wait. The business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim, so it's not directly related to the claim. Therefore, the fact is not material to the claim, so the testimony is not hearsay.

So, the accountant's testimony is not hearsay. Therefore, it should be admissible.

Wait, but the options include whether it's admissible. The options are:

A: admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.

B: admissible, because it corroborates the tenant's claims.

C: inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.

D: inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.

E: inadmissible as secondary evidence.

F: inadmissible, because the accountant is an interested party.

G: admissible, because it falls under the business record exception.

H: inadmissible, because it constitutes hearsay.

I: inadmissible, due to the lack of physical contract as evidence.

J: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

So the question is whether the testimony is admissible.

Wait, another angle: the business being robbed is a separate matter, and the fact is material to the tenant's claim. But the business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the claim, so it's not material. So the fact is not hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible.

But wait, the business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim, so the business's condition is not material to the claim. Therefore, it's not hearsay. So the testimony is not hearsay.

So the correct answer would be G: admissible, because it falls under the business record exception.

Wait, but wait. The business being robbed is a separate matter, but the fact is not material to the claim, so it's not hearsay.

Alternatively, the business being robbed is a fact that's not directly relevant—so the testimony is not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim, so the business's condition is not material to the claim. Thus, the business being robbed is not a hearsay fact.

Wait, but the business being robbed could have some impact on the assumption that the contract would continue. So the fact that the business was robbed may affect the tenant's reliance on the contract. But in terms of hearsay, the business being robbed is not material to the claim, so it's not hearsay.

So in that case, the testimony is not hearsay, so it's admissible. So the correct option would be J: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Hearsay requires the fact to be material to the outcome. The business being robbed is not material because it happened before the claim. So it's not a hearsay fact. So the testimony is not hearsay.

But wait, the business being robbed is a separate issue. So the fact is not material. Therefore, the testimony is not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible.

But another angle: The business being robbed is a matter that occurred before the tenant's claim. So the fact is not material to the claim, so it's not hearsay.

In that case, the testimony is admissible, so the answer would be G or J.

Wait, another thought: When a party is opposing evidence, the auditor's rule comes into play. Here, the tenant is opposing evidence (the accountant's testimony). The business being robbed is a prior matter, so it's not material. Therefore, the fact is not hearsay, and the testimony is not hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

So, the correct option would be J: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the business being robbed.

Wait, the business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim. So the fact is material to the tenant's claim? Or not?

The tenant's claim is about the assumption that the landlord would continue the business, based on the contract. So if the business was in bad shape, the tenant's reliance on the contract is invalid. But the fact of the business being robbed was before the claim. So the business being robbed is not a material fact for the claim, because it occurred before.

So the business being robbed is not a hearsay fact, so the testimony is not hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

So the correct answer is J: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Wait, but wait. The landlord's business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the claim. So the tenant is using the contract to prove that the contract would have been honored, assuming that the business would continue. But the business being robbed could have caused the tenant to abandon the contract. However, the business being robbed is not material to the claim, so the fact is not hearsay.

Therefore, the testimony is admissible, and the correct answer is J.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the accountant's testimony regarding the landlord's contract. The key issues are whether the testimony is hearsay and whether it falls under the business record exception.

1. **Hearsay Analysis**: The business being robbed is a fact that occurred before the tenant's claim. It is not material to the tenant's case because the claim is about the assumption of continued business, which was likely based on the business's condition at the time. Thus, the business being robbed is not a hearsay fact.

2. **Business Record Exception**: The business being robbed is a prior matter, and the fact is not material to the claim. This makes the testimony admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

3. **Option Analysis**: Among the options, J ("admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule") is the most appropriate because the testimony does not violate the hearsay rule and is not material to the claim.
