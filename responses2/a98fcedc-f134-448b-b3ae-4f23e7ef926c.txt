Okay, so I have this question here: "What is three fifth of 100?" And I need to select the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that "of" in math usually means multiplication. So, when they say "three fifth of 100," it's like 3/5 multiplied by 100. I think I should calculate that.

Wait, 3/5 is the same as 0.6, right? So if I multiply 0.6 by 100, that should give me the answer. Let me do the math: 0.6 * 100 equals 60. So the result is 60.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which letter corresponds to 60. Let me check each option:

A: 50 — that's 1/2 of 100, so that's not right.
B: 20 — that's 1/5 of 100. No.
C: 3 — that's way too small.
D: 90 — that's more than 100, so no.
E: 80 — that's 4/5 of 100. Hmm, wait, why am I thinking that? So, 4/5 is 0.8, 0.8 * 100 is 80. Oh, so that's actually 4/5, not 3/5.
F: 60 — yes, that's what I got.
G: 100 — that's the whole number, not a fraction.
H: 30 — that's 3/10 of 100, but we have 3/5.
I: 70 — that's 7/10, also not correct.
J: 5 — that's way too small.

So the correct option is F: 60.

The calculation of three-fifths of 100 is 60, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
