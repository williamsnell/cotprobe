Question:

A survey shows that a mayoral candidate is gaining votes at a rate of 2000t + 1000 votes per day, where t is the number of days since she announced her candidacy. How many supporters will the candidate have after 60 days, assuming that she had no supporters at t = 0?

Options:

A: 6000000
B: 3000000
C: 120000
D: 4200000
E: 2400000
F: 3200000
G: 1800000
H: 4000000
I: 3660000
J: 6600000

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a mayoral candidate gaining votes. Hmm, let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says the rate at which the candidate gains votes is 2000t + 1000 votes per day. Oh wait, t is the number of days since she announced her candidacy. So, the rate depends on t. That means the number of votes is changing over time in a linear fashion, but not just a constant rate.

I remember that to find the total number of votes after a certain period, I need to integrate the rate with respect to time. Because integration gives the total change over the interval. So, the initial rate is 1000 votes per day, and then it increases by 2000 votes per day each day. So, the rate starts low and increases over time.

Wait, the rate is a function of t, so I should integrate (2000t + 1000) dt from t=0 to t=60 days. Oh right, because t is the variable here. So, integrating that function will give me the total votes accumulated over 60 days.

Let me do the integration. The integral of 2000t is (2000/2) t², which is 1000 t². The integral of 1000 is 1000t. So, putting it together, the total votes V(t) is 1000t² + 1000t + C, where C is the constant of integration. But wait, at t=0, the number of supporters is zero. So, plugging t=0 into V(t) gives 0 + 0 + C = 0. So, C is zero. That simplifies things.

So, V(t) = 1000 t² + 1000 t. Now I need to find the number of supporters after 60 days. So, plug t=60 into the equation.

Calculating V(60): 1000*(60)^2 + 1000*(60). Let's compute each term. 60 squared is 3600. Multiply that by 1000: 3,600,000. Then, 1000*60 is 60,000. So, adding those together: 3,600,000 + 60,000 = 3,660,000.

Wait, but let me double-check if I did the integration correctly. The rate is 2000t + 1000 per day, so integrating with respect to t from 0 to 60. The integral of 2000t is indeed 1000 t², and the integral of 1000 is 1000t. So that's correct.

So, after 60 days, the total votes are 3,660,000. Looking at the options, option I is 3,660,000, so that should be the right answer. Let me make sure I didn't miss any terms. Oh yeah, in the integration, we started with 1000t² and 1000t, which are the correct terms. And no other terms were involved because the rate is a linear function of t. So, I think I'm confident that option I is correct.

To determine the total number of supporters after 60 days, we integrate the rate of votes gained per day, which is given as \(2000t + 1000\), with respect to time. The integral from 0 to 60 days is:

\[
V = \int_{0}^{60} (2000t + 1000) \, dt = \left[1000t^2 + 1000t\right]_{0}^{60}
\]

Evaluating at \(t = 60\):

\[
1000(60)^2 + 1000(60) = 1000 \times 3600 + 60,000 = 3,600,000 + 60,000 = 3,660,000
\]

The candidate has 3,660,000 supporters after 60 days.

Answer: I: 3,660,000
