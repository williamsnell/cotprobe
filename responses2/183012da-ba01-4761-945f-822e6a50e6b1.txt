Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It involves using an indirect truth table to determine whether an argument is valid. The argument is given as:

1. P ⊃ (Q ∨ R)
2. (Q · S) ⊃ ~P
3. ~ (~Q ∨ R) / ~P

And I need to check if this argument is valid. If it's invalid, I have to find a counterexample from the given options. The options are A to H, each suggesting specific truth values for P, Q, R, S that would make the conclusion false.

First, I need to understand what "indirect truth tables" mean. From what I remember, an indirect truth table is a method used to test the validity of a logical argument by assuming the premises are true and then seeing if the conclusion necessarily follows. If under that assumption, the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

The argument has three premises and a conclusion. Let's break down the premises and the conclusion.

Premise 1: P implies (Q or R). So, if P is true, then at least one of Q or R must be true. Symbolically, P ⊃ (Q ∨ R).

Premise 2: If (Q and S) then not P. So, if both Q and S are true, then P must be false. Symbolically, (Q · S) ⊃ ~P.

Premise 3: The conclusion is ~P. So, the argument is claiming that if all three premises are true, then P is false.

Wait, actually, the conclusion is written as / ~P, meaning the antecedent (the part above the slash) is the premises, and the conclusion is the part below. So the argument is: (P ⊃ (Q∨R)) ∧ ((Q·S) ⊃ ~P) ∧ (~ (~Q∨R)) → ~P. So, it's an implication. The argument is saying that if the premises are true, then the conclusion (~P) must be true. So, the argument is a conditional statement: premises imply ~P.

So, to determine validity, I need to see if in every possible truth assignment, whenever all premises are true, the conclusion (~P) is also true. If there's even one assignment where premises are true and conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

Alternatively, using the indirect method, I can assume that all premises are true, and see if the conclusion must be true. If I can find a scenario where premises are true and conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

So, the plan is to create a truth table for all variables (P, Q, R, S) and evaluate each premise and the conclusion in each row. If there's a row where all premises are true and conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.

Now, looking at the options, each option gives specific truth values for P, Q, R, S. I need to check each option to see if it's a counterexample. A counterexample is a specific assignment where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Wait, no. Wait a minute. Actually, the counterexample would be a scenario where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Because if such a scenario exists, then the argument is invalid. So, in the options, if any option is a scenario where premises are true, and conclusion is false, that would be a counterexample.

Wait, no, wait again. Because the conclusion is ~P. So, in a scenario where ~P is false, meaning P is true, and the premises are true. So, the conclusion is ~P, which is false. So for an invalid argument, we need a scenario where premises are true and conclusion is false. So, in that case, the conclusion is false in a scenario where premises are true.

So, the options are combinations of truth values for P, Q, R, S. For each option, I'll need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion, and see if any option satisfies premises being true and conclusion being false.

Let me look at the options:

A: P, Q, R, S are all true.

So, P=T, Q=T, R=T, S=T.

Let's evaluate the premises.

Premise 1: P ⊃ (Q∨R). Since P is true, then Q∨R must be true. Q and R are both true, so yes, premise 1 is true.

Premise 2: (Q·S) ⊃ ~P. Q and S are both true, so Q·S is true. ~P is false (since P is true). So, premise 2 is (T) ⊃ (F), which is false. So premise 2 is false. So, in this row, premises 1 and 2 are true, premise 3 is ~P which is F. So, in this row, the premises are not all true. So, this option is not a counterexample.

Wait, wait. Wait, premise 2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P. So, when Q and S are both T, then (Q ∧ S) is T, so ~P must be T for the implication to be true. But P is T, so ~P is F. So premise 2 is T → F, which is F. So, in this case, premise 2 is false. So, in this row, premises 1 is T, premise 2 is F, premise 3 is F. So, the premises aren't all true. Therefore, this option isn't a counterexample.

So, the conclusion in this case would be ~P, which is F. But since premises aren't all true, this isn't a counterexample. So, option A isn't a counterexample.

Moving on to option B: Valid. So, perhaps B is a valid argument. Let's see, but I think the other options are more likely counterexamples. Let's continue.

Option C: Valid. No counterexamples. So, if all options are valid, that's possible, but I don't think so. I expect one of them to be a counterexample.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when P and R are true and Q and S are false.

So, P=T, R=T, Q=F, S=F.

Let's evaluate each premise.

Premise 1: P ⊃ (Q∨R). P is T. Q∨R is F or R is T? Q is F, R is T, so Q∨R is T. So premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P. Q is F, S is F. So Q ∧ S is F. So, the premise is F → ~P. Since F implies anything is T. So, premise 2 is T.

Premise 3: ~P. P is T, so ~P is F. So, in this row, premises 1 and 2 are T, premise 3 is F.

So, the conclusion would be ~P, which is F. Since all premises are not all T (premise 3 is F), this isn't a counterexample. So option D isn't a counterexample.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true, Q, R, and S are false.

So, P=T, Q=F, R=F, S=F.

Check premises.

Premise 1: P ⊃ (Q∨R). P is T, Q and R are F, so Q∨R is F. So, premise 1 is F.

So, even if the premises are partially true, the argument's premise 1 is F, so the entire premise set would be F, meaning the implication (premises → conclusion) is T. So, in this row, the premises are not all T. So, this isn't a counterexample.

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false.

So, P=T, Q=T, R=F, S=F.

Evaluating premises.

Premise 1: P ⊃ (Q∨R). Q is T, R is F → Q∨R is T. So premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: (Q·S) → ~P. Q is T, S is F → Q·S is F. So, premise 2 is F → ~P. Since ~P is F, the premise is F → F, which is T. So premise 2 is T.

Premise 3: ~P. P is T, so premise 3 is F.

So, in this row, premises 1 and 2 are T, premise 3 is F. So, the conclusion is ~P, which is F. So, the conclusion is F, but the premises are not all T (since premise 3 is F). So, this isn't a counterexample.

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, Q, R, and S are true.

So, P=F, Q=T, R=T, S=T.

Evaluating premises.

Premise 1: P ⊃ (Q∨R). P is F. So, in logic, an implication with a false antecedent is always true. So, premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: (Q·S) → ~P. Q·S is T·T=F. So, (Q·S) is F. So, the premise is F → ~P. ~P is T (since P=F). So, the premise is F→T, which is T. So, premise 2 is T.

So, in this row, premises 1 and 2 are T, but premise 3 is ~P, which is T (since P=F). So, the conclusion is T, and the premises are also T. So, the argument's premise set is all T, and conclusion is T. So, this isn't a counterexample. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, the argument is (premises) → conclusion. So, if all premises are T and conclusion is T, the implication is T. So, this isn't a counterexample.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the other options.

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and S are true and Q is false.

So, P=T, Q=F, R=T, S=T.

Evaluating premises.

Premise 1: P ⊃ (Q∨R). Q is F, so Q∨R is R being T, so Q∨R is T. So premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: (Q·S) → ~P. Q is F, S is T → Q·S is F. So, premise 2 is F → ~P. ~P is F (since P=T). So, premise 2 is F → F → T. So, premise 2 is T.

So, premise 2 is T.

Premise 3: ~P. P is T → ~P is F.

So, in this row, premises 1 and 2 are T, premise 3 is F. So, the conclusion is ~P, which is F. So, the premises are not all T. So, this isn't a counterexample.

Option I: Invalid. Counterexample when P and S are true and Q and R are false.

So, P=T, S=T, Q=F, R=F.

Premise 1: P ⊃ (Q∨R) → Q∨R is F, so premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: (Q·S) → ~P. Q is F, S is T → Q·S is F. So, premise 2 is F → ~P. P is T, so ~P is F. So, F → F is T. So, premise 2 is T.

So, premise 1 and 2 are T. Premise 3 is ~P → F. So, conclusion is F. So, premises are all T, the conclusion is F. So, this is a counterexample.

Wait, that's option I. So, in this case, premises are all T, conclusion is F. So, the argument is invalid. So, option I is a counterexample.

Wait, but let me check again. Because the conclusion is ~P. So, in this case, P is T, so ~P is F. So, the conclusion is F.

So, in this scenario, all premises are true, and the conclusion is false. So, the argument is invalid, and option I is a counterexample.

But wait, let me double-check the premises.

Premise 2: (Q·S) → ~P. Q is F, S is T → Q·S is F. So, premise 2 is F → ~P. ~P is F (since P is T). So, F→F is T. So, premise 2 is T.

So, yes, all premises are T, conclusion is F. So, this is a valid counterexample.

So, the argument is invalid. So, the correct answer is option I: Invalid. Counterexample when P and S are true and Q and R are false.

Wait, but wait, option I is when P and S are true, and Q and R are false. So, that's P=T, Q=F, R=F, S=T.

So, that's exactly what I considered for option I.

So, the correct counterexample is option I.
</think>

The argument is invalid because there exists a scenario where all premises are true, but the conclusion (~P) is false. Specifically, when P and S are true, and Q and R are false, the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This is the counterexample for option I.
