Okay, so I've got this question about searching for an integer in a sorted list, and I need to figure out the maximum number of elements I might have to check if I use the most efficient method. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says there's a sorted list of 120 integers, and we're looking to see if 100 is in there. The options are a bunch of numbers, and I have to pick the right one which is the maximum number of elements we'd need to examine in the best-case scenario.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the most efficient algorithm for searching in a sorted list is binary search, right? Because binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is super efficient. So, I need to calculate how many steps binary search would take to find an element, and what's the worst-case scenario.

So, the list has 120 elements. Let's see. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. So each step eliminates half of the remaining elements. The worst case is when the element is the last one we check, or somewhere that requires as many steps as possible.

So, the maximum number of steps would be when the element is the last one, so we have to check all the elements until we find it. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, in a binary search, each step reduces the possible range by half, so the number of steps needed to find the element would be the ceiling of log base 2 of the number of elements.

So for 120 elements, log2(120) is approximately 6.9, which rounds up to 7. So the maximum number of elements we'd need to examine is 7. Because in the worst case, we have to check the 7th element to find the target.

Wait, wait. Let me confirm. Let's think about a smaller example. Like a list of 4 elements. The worst case would be when the element is the last one, which is the 4th. But wait, using binary search, how many steps would that take? Let's see: 4 elements, log2(4)=2. So the steps would be 2. But in reality, it would take 2 steps. Hmm, so maybe when the number is a power of two, the log is exact, but for others, it's the next integer.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum number of elements examined. So, for 120, the maximum number would be the log2(120) rounded up. Let me calculate that. Log base 2 of 120 is about 6.9, so 7. So the maximum number of elements examined is 7. So the correct answer should be option F:7.

Wait, but looking back at the options: the choices are A:100, B:30, C:120, D:10, E:8, F:7, G:15, H:12, I:20, J:60. So F is 7.

Wait, but that makes sense because in a binary search, each step eliminates half the remaining elements. So for 120 elements, the binary search would take up to 7 steps, meaning the 7th step would find the element. So the maximum number of elements examined is 7.

The correct answer is F: 7.

**Explanation:**
- The most efficient search algorithm for a sorted list is binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n).
- For a list of 120 integers, the maximum number of elements that must be examined in the worst case is determined by calculating the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of 120.
- log2(120) is approximately 6.9, so the ceiling is 7. This means the maximum number of elements to examine is 7.

Answer: F
