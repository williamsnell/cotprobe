Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is about people more likely to experience depression after a loss. Let me break it down.

The question asks, "Those more likely to experience depression after a loss are those who..." and then there are six options labeled A to F, plus an E which is "Are young survivors" and F is "Are in good health." Wait, no, looking again, the options are A through G. The options are:

A: Strong social support network
B: No previous mental health issues
C: Have not previously experienced depression
D: High income
E: Have been married less than a year
F: Are young survivors
G: Are in good health

Wait, I think I might have misread that earlier. So, the options are A to G, each is a different statement.

The question is about the last part of the sentence: "Those more likely to experience depression after a loss are those who...". So, the correct answer is the option that describes a group that is more prone to depression following a loss.

I remember that in psychology, when people face a loss, they might be more likely to experience depression because they're in a sense "broken" or "unhappy." So, having someone who was around them might contribute to this. That suggests that having a strong social support network (Option A) is the right answer because it implies that the person has someone who can be a source of comfort and support, making them more vulnerable to feeling down.

Let me think about other options. Option B says no previous mental health issues, but that's not necessarily the case. People can experience depression after a loss because it's a natural reaction. Option C is about not having a history, but that doesn't directly address the impact of a loss. Option D is income, which isn't directly related. Option E is about being married less than a yearâ€”maybe that affects mental health, but I'm not sure. Option F is about being a young survivor, but that seems unrelated. Option G is good health, which is the opposite of what the question is about.

So, the key here is that social support is the main factor. Without someone around them, the person might not feel safe, leading to depression. So the correct answer should be A: Have a strong social support network.

The correct answer is A: Have a strong social support network. This option highlights the importance of having someone around you who can provide comfort and emotional support, which is a key factor in experiencing depression after a loss.
