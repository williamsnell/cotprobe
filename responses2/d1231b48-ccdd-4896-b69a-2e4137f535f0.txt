Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: The virus uses a different enzyme to replicate its genetic material
B: The virus has a unique replication cycle that does not involve nucleic acids
C: The virus is immune to DNAase
D: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase
E: DNAase selectively only attacks bacterial DNA
F: The virus's genetic material is composed of proteins, not nucleic acids
G: The virus rapidly mutates to resist the effects of DNAase
H: The RNA in the virus is transformed into DNA
I: The virus has a protective shell against DNAase
J: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor proteins

Okay, so I need to figure out the right answer to this question about DNAase and how it affects different viruses. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that if DNAase is added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed and the cell can't make any more proteins, so it dies. But if DNAase is added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. The question is asking why that happens.

Hmm, I need to think about what DNAase does. DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So in bacteria, DNA is the DNA of the cell. If you add DNAase to bacteria, they can't make more proteins because there's no DNA left to process. So the cell dies.

Now, RNA viruses. RNA viruses have their own DNA, which is RNA. Wait, no, the RNA is actually the genetic material of the virus. Oh wait, no, some RNA viruses have their genetic material as DNA, like in RNA-SOX1 or something. So when DNAase is added to them, they can still make proteins because their genetic material is RNA. Because DNAase can't break RNA into proteins. So the RNA stays intact, and the virus can replicate, making new proteins.

Looking at the options:

Option D: The virus has RNA, so it's not affected by DNAase. That makes sense.

Wait, other options. Let's think about the others.

Option E: DNAase only attacks bacterial DNA. That's correct, but the question is about why adding DNAase doesn't affect RNA viruses. So E is correct but not the main answer.

Option G: The virus's genetic material is proteins? No, RNA viruses have RNA, so G is incorrect.

Option C: The virus is immune to DNAase. No, because if DNAase is added, they can't replicate, leading to death.

Option F: The virus's genetic material is proteins. No, because if they were DNA, then DNAase wouldn't affect them.

Option D says the virus has RNA, not DNA, so it's not affected. That's correct.

So the answer must be D.

The correct explanation is that RNA viruses have their genetic material as RNA, not DNA, so DNAase cannot degrade their DNA and allows them to replicate and produce new proteins. 

**Answer: D**
