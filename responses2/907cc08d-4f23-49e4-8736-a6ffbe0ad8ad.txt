"Those whose condition is such that their function is the use of their bodies and nothing better can be expected of them, those, I say, are slaves of nature. It is better for them to be ruled thus."
Juan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522
"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolomé de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'"

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Native American agriculture and natural rights. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question asks which of the options is analogous to maize cultivation among the Native Americans of Mexico. The options are all different types of farming: buffalo hunting, whaling, seal hunting, salmon fishing, etc. Wait, I'm a bit rusty, so I need to think carefully.

I remember that maize is a type of crop, like corn, but in the context of Native American agriculture, it's more about the practices they engage in. Native Americans, especially the Iroquois, are known for their hunting and herding animals. They hunt a variety of animals, but I think the main ones are deer and maybe others.

Wait, the options are about their farming practices. So, the question is comparing maize cultivation to one of these farming methods. Maize is a type of grass, so if the question is about their farming, the options are about what they do with animals.

Wait, the options are types of hunting. Let me think. The question is about maize cultivation, which is a type of farming, but the options are about their methods of herding or hunting.

Wait, the question is phrased as "maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?" So, the options are all about what they do, not the farming method. Maize is a crop, but the options are about their methods, like hunting.

So, looking at the options again:

A: Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux
B: Whaling by the Makah
C: Seal hunting among the Inuit
D: Salmon fishing among the Chinook
E: Cattle herding by the Apache
F: Wolf domestication by the Algonquians
G: Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois
H: Deer hunting by the Seminole

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about maize cultivation, which is a type of farming. The options are about their methods of herding or hunting. So perhaps the question is a bit confusing. Or maybe the options are about their methods, but the question is about their farming.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. Oh, wait, the first part says "maize cultivation among the Native Americans of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?" So, the options are methods of herding or hunting. Maize is a crop, so maybe the question is about their farming methods.

Wait, but if the question is about maize cultivation, which is a farming practice, then the options are about their methods of herding or hunting. So maybe the options are all their methods, so the correct answer would be one of these.

Wait, the options are all types of herding or hunting, so perhaps it's about their methods of herding, not their farming. So the question is which of these is analogous to maize cultivation. So, maize is a crop, but their farming methods would be hunting and herding animals.

Wait, but the options are methods of hunting or herding. So, if maize is a crop, then perhaps the question is about their farming methods. So, the question is about the analogy between maize (a crop) and their farming practices.

Wait, perhaps the user is mixing up the question. Let me read the question again: "maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?" So, if the options are their methods of herding, then that's about their farming.

Wait, but maybe the question is about the analogy between maize, which is a farming practice, and the other options, which are about their methods. So, the correct answer is one of the options which is a method of herding or hunting.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options:

A is buffalo hunting. Buffo is a type of animal, so that's a hunting method.

B is whaling, which is whaling, which is a type of fishing.

C is seal hunting.

D is salmon fishing.

E is cattle herding (like in the Animas tribe).

F is wolf domestication.

G is mixed agriculture among Iroquois. Mixed, so they grow crops and have livestock.

H is deer hunting by the Seminole.

Wait, but the question is about maize cultivation. Maize is a crop, but the options are about their methods of herding or hunting. So, perhaps it's about their methods, not their farming.

Wait, but the question is about maize cultivation, which is a farming practice. So, the options are all methods of herding or hunting, not farming.

Wait, maybe the options are about the methods of herding or hunting, and the question is about their analogy to maize (which is a type of farming). So, perhaps the question is about their methods of herding.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the original context. The given text talks about Spanish philosophers and natural rights. So maybe the question is about historical Native American practices.

Wait, the text says that in the 16th century, Spanish bishops like Bartolome de Las Casas applied and extended Thomasian moral philosophy to the context of Spanish conquests in the Americas. They wrote about the natural rights of all peoples, based on their membership in a common humanity. So, the key figure was a bishop who promoted the idea of natural rights and natural law, drawing from Aristotelian philosophy and empirical evidence.

So, the key figure is a bishop practicing Thomasianism. They applied the idea that all humans are created equal, with a right to liberty based on membership in a shared humanity. That's the foundation of natural rights.

Now, the question is about maize, which is a crop, but the options are about their methods of herding or hunting. So, perhaps the question is about their methods of herding animals, like in one of the options.

Wait, but the options are methods of herding. So, perhaps the correct answer is one of the options that represents a hunting method.

Wait, but the options are all about their methods, not their farming. So, perhaps the question is about their methods of herding animals. So, the correct analogy would be a hunting method.

Wait, but the options are about their methods of herding. So, the correct answer would be one of the options provided.

Wait, the options are all methods of herding: A is buffalo hunting, B is whaling, C is seal hunting, D is salmon fishing, E is cattle herding, F is wolf domestication, G is mixed agriculture, H is deer hunting.

Wait, the question is about maize cultivation among the Native Americans, which is the same as their methods of herding. So, the correct analogy would be their way of herding animals, which is like a hunting method.

So, looking at the options, which ones are hunting methods? Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

Wait, but the options are all about their methods, so the correct answer is the option that represents a hunting method.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?" So, the correct answer would be the option that represents a hunting method, perhaps one of the options.

Wait, but the options include methods, not the same as maize. So, perhaps the question is confusing, but given the options, the correct answer is one of the methods, like B (whaling) or D ( salmon fishing) or E (cattle herding).

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, which is cattle herding. Or maybe D, which is salmon fishing.

Wait, but the natural rights movement was centered around herding animals, so perhaps option E, which is cattle herding, is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The text talks about the key figure who applied the Thomasian idea to the context of Spanish conquests, leading to natural rights. That would involve herding animals, which is a hunting method.

So, the correct analogy would be a hunting method. The options are all methods of herding. So, the question is which one is analogous to maize cultivation.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option E, cattle herding, because it's a hunting method.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B, whaling. Wait, but whaling is a fishing method, while herding is hunting.

Hmm, but the text says that the key figure was Bartolome de Las Casas, who wrote about the natural rights of all peoples, based on their membership in a common humanity. So, the underlying idea is about herding, which is a hunting method.

So, the correct analogy would be a hunting method, like whaling, which is a fishing method, but the option is about their methods of herding, which is hunting.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the methods of herding, so which option represents a hunting method. The options are A to H. So, the correct answer would be one of these.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recall the historical context. The text mentions that the key figure (Bartolome de Las Casas) focused on the natural rights of all people, based on their membership in a common humanity. This led to the extension of Thomasian moral philosophy, which emphasized that all humans are equal, with a right to liberty.

So, this idea was about herding animals because they were members of a common humanity. So, the method was herding.

So, the methods of herding would be options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

Wait, the question is about maize cultivation among the native peoples, which is a farming practice, but the options are about methods of herding. So, perhaps the correct answer is a method of herding, but the question is about maize.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the methods of herding, and the correct one is the example of using a hunting method.

Wait, the text says that "maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?" So, the options are all methods of herding. So, perhaps the correct answer is the method of herding that's used in maize, but wait, that doesn't make sense because maize is a crop, not a herding method.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the methods of farming, and the correct answer is one of the options that represents that.

Wait, but the options are methods of herding, so perhaps the correct answer is the method that's most analogous, which is the hunting methods.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the methods of herding, and the correct answer is B (whaling) or D ( salmon fishing), but perhaps the correct answer is E (cattle herding) since that's a common method among the Iroquois.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of which methods were used in the 16th century. For example, the Iroquois did herding with animals like the deer, the wolf, and the cow. So, perhaps the correct answer is H, which is deer hunting.

Wait, but the text says that Bartolome de Las Casas, a Spanish bishop, worked on the idea that all people have a common humanity, which led to natural rights. So, the key idea was about herding animals because they belong to a common humanity. So, the analogy would be a herding method.

So, the question is asking which of the following is analogous to maize cultivation, which is a farming practice. But the options are about their methods of herding.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because the Iroquois did herding with cattle, and that's one of the methods. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B (whaling), but whaling is a fishing method, so that might not fit.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but I think the correct answer is E, cattle herding, as it's a method of herding, which was used by the Iroquois, and the key figure was Bartolome de Las Casas, who focused on herding animals for natural rights.

The question asks which of the provided methods of herding is most analogous to maize cultivation among the Native Americans of Mexico. maize cultivation refers to farming practices, but the options describe methods of herding. Bartolome de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop, focused on herding animals to extend natural rights, emphasizing the common humanity of all humans. This led to the development of methods like buffalo hunting, seal hunting, and cattle herding, which were herding practices. Among the options, cattle herding (Option E) aligns with the idea of herding animals as a method of natural rights, making it the most analogous.

Answer: E
