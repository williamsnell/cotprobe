Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about football players and their weights. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Alright, the problem says that players in the NFL weigh, on average, 248 pounds with a standard deviation of about 47 pounds. Then, four players are selected at random, and we're looking at the total combined weight of these four players, which is called W. The expected value of W is given as 992 pounds. The question is about the standard deviation of W, and we have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with the sum of random variables, especially when they're independent, the variance and standard deviation of the sum is the sum of their individual variances and standard deviations. So, if each player's weight is a random variable, then the total weight would be the sum of these four variables.

The expected value part might be a red herring because expectation is linear, but the question is about the standard deviation, which is about variance. So I think the key here is to find the variance of each player's weight and then multiply it by four, because we're adding four independent variables.

Wait, but wait. Each player's weight has a mean of 248 and a standard deviation of 47. So for each player, the variance would be (47)^2. Let me calculate that. 47 squared is 2209. Since each player's weight contributes this variance, and we have four players, the total variance would be 4 * 2209. Let me compute that: 4 times 2209 is 8836. So the variance of W is 8836.

But standard deviation is the square root of variance. So sqrt(8836) would give us the standard deviation of W. Let me think about the square root of 8836. I know that 94 squared is 8836 because 90 squared is 8100 and 4 squared is 16, and 2*90*4 is 720. 8100 + 720 +16= 8836. So sqrt(8836) is 94. So the standard deviation is 94 pounds. Looking at the options, option A is 94 pounds. So the answer should be A.

The total combined weight W of four players is the sum of four independent random variables, each with a mean of 248 pounds and a standard deviation of 47 pounds. The variance of each player's weight is \(47^2 = 2209\). For four players, the total variance is \(4 \times 2209 = 8836\). The standard deviation is the square root of this variance, which is \(\sqrt{8836} = 94\) pounds.

**Answer: A: 94 pounds**
