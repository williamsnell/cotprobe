Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the coefficient of starting friction. Hmm. Alright, the mass is 50 kilograms, and the force required to start moving it is 343 Newtons. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms, but I think I remember that the force needed to overcome friction is related to the normal force and the coefficient of friction.

Wait, right. The formula for friction is F = μ*N, where F is the frictional force, μ is the coefficient of friction, and N is the normal force. But wait, when you start moving an object, that's the static friction, right? So the force needed is the maximum static friction, which is given by F = μs * N. But wait, N is the normal force. For a horizontal surface, the normal force is equal to the weight of the object. So N = m * g, where m is mass and g is about 9.8 m/s².

So in this problem, the force required to start moving is 343 Nt. Wait, is that Newton tons? Oh, that's probably a typo. Because 1 Newton is a unit of force, not "Nt". So I think it's meant to be Newtons, 343 N. Okay.

So the force is 343 N. So F = μs * m * g.

Wait, let me write that down. F = μs * m * g. So I can rearrange this to solve for μs: μs = F / (m*g).

Plugging in the numbers. F is 343 N, m is 50 kg, g is 9.8 m/s².

Let me calculate that. So 343 divided by (50 * 9.8). Let me compute 50 * 9.8 first. 50 * 10 is 500, so 50*9.8 is 490. So 343 divided by 490.

Hmm, 343 ÷ 490. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 49? Wait, 49*7 is 343, and 49*10 is 490. So 343 ÷ 490 is 0.7. Oh, wait, that can't be right. Because 0.7 is option A. But wait, another thought: Wait, 343 divided by 50 is 6.86, but I'm dividing by 490, which is 50*9.8.

Wait, 343 / 490 is the same as (343 ÷ 49) / (490 ÷49) = 7 / 10 = 0.7. So yeah, μs is 0.7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.75, H is 0.70. So option H is 0.7, which matches. So the answer should be option H.

To determine the coefficient of starting friction, we use the formula for static friction:

\[
F = \mu_s \cdot m \cdot g
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(\mu_s\):

\[
\mu_s = \frac{F}{m \cdot g}
\]

Given:
- \(F = 343 \, \text{N}\),
- \(m = 50 \, \text{kg}\),
- \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\),

we calculate:

\[
\mu_s = \frac{343}{50 \cdot 9.8} = \frac{343}{490} = 0.7
\]

Thus, the coefficient of starting friction is \(0.70\), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
