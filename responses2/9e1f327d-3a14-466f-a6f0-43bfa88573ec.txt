Okay, so I've got this question here, and I'm supposed to figure out the answer. Let me read it again. The question says, when n equals 11, what is the value of 10 minus (n plus 6)? The options are A through J, each with different numbers.

Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, substitute n with 11 in the equation. So that part is straightforward. So n is 11, so n plus 6 would be 11 plus 6. Let me calculate that: 11 plus 6 is 17. So the equation becomes 10 minus 17.

Wait, 10 minus 17. That's like 10 minus 15 which is 5, plus another 2, so that's 17. So 10 minus 17 is -7. So the result should be -7.

Now, looking at the options. Let me go through them again. The options are: A: 3, B:0, C:5, D:-7, E:-5, F:1, G:27, H:7, I:-3, J:15.

So D is -7, which matches what I got. So the correct answer should be D.

But wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check. n is 11. So n +6 is 17. 10 minus 17 is definitely -7. Yep, that's correct. So D is the right choice.

The correct answer is D: -7.

D: –7
