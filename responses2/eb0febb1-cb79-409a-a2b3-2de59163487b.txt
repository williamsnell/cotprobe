Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about Chesa making soup for a school party. Last year, she made 32 one-cup servings. This year, she's making twice as much as last year. I need to find out how many gallons she'll make this year.

Hmm, first, let's break it down. Last year, she made 32 one-cup servings. Each serving is one cup. So, in total, she made 32 cups last year. But the question is about gallons, not cups. I remember that 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 1 gallon is 16 cups. So, if she used to make 32 cups, that would be 32 divided by 16, which is 2 gallons. Wait, no. Wait, 32 cups divided by 16 cups per gallon. So 32 /16 is 2 gallons. So last year, she made 2 gallons of soup.

This year, she's making twice as much. So, 2 gallons times 2 is 4 gallons. So, the answer should be 4 gallons, which is option D.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Last year's servings: 32 one-cup. Each serving is 1 cup. So total cups last year: 32 cups. To convert to gallons: 32 cups รท 16 cups/gallon = 2 gallons. This year, twice as much: 2 * 2 = 4 gallons. Yep, that's correct.

The correct answer is 4 gallons, which is option D.
