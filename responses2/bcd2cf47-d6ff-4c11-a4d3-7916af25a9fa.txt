Okay, so I need to figure out the influence of genetics on longevity. Hmm, I remember from biology that genes play a significant role in determining how long organisms live. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage or how it stacks up compared to other factors.

Wait, the question is about the influence of genetics on longevity. I think it's a measure of how much of the variation in life expectancy is due to genetic factors. I've heard that genetics contributes a lot, but not all of it. Maybe around 30% or so? I'm not certain, though. I should check what the commonly accepted percentage is.

Oh right, there's a study called the genetics of longevity, which I think shows that around 30% of the variation in life expectancy is due to genetic factors. But wait, I remember reading somewhere that the proportion might be higher. Maybe around 35% or 40%? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the options given are A to J. Let me look at them again: A is 33%, B is 40%, etc. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. I think the majority of the variation is due to genetics, but not all. The exact percentage isn't 100%, so maybe around 30-40%. So looking at the options, 33% is option A and 40% is option B. 

But wait, I've heard that genetics accounts for a significant chunk. I think the influence is about 30-40%, but the question is giving these percentages. So if the question is asking for the estimated influence, it might be around 30-40% of the variation. So 33% is about 33%, which is option A, and 40% is option B. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: I think the genetic component is about 30-40%, but I've also heard that other factors like environment and lifestyle are big. So if the question is about the influence as a percentage of the variation, maybe 33% is the closest. Or 40% is also a possibility. 

But the options don't include 35%, so the choices are 33, 40, etc. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the answer might be around 33%. So option A: 33%.

The influence of genetics on longevity is estimated to be approximately 33% of the variation in life expectancy.
