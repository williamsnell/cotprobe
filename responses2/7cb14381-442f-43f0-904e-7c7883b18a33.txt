Okay, so I have this logic question about conditional syllogisms. Let me try to figure it out. I remember that a syllogism has a minor premise and a major premise. But wait, since the question is about the minor premise denying the antecedent, I need to recall how that affects the conclusion.

The question is about when the minor premise denies the antecedent. Hmm. So, in a conditional syllogism, the structure is something like:

1. If P, then Q.
2. If not P, then R.
3. So, conclusion? The conclusion would be something like If not P, then R.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Actually, the syllogism is made up of two premises and a conclusion. The minor premise is the one that contains the minor term. So, if the major premise is "All P are Q," the minor premise might be "All S are P." Then the conclusion would be "All S are Q." But that's the standard form.

Wait, no. Maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again. The question is about denying the antecedent. So, let's construct a syllogism where the minor premise denies the antecedent. 

Let's say the major premise is "If P, then Q." The minor premise could be "Not P." But wait, syllogisms usually require two premises. Oh, wait, in a conditional syllogism, the structure is often something like:

Premise 1: If P, then Q.
Premise 2: P.
Conclusion: Therefore, Q.

But if the minor premise doesn't have P, then what? Maybe the minor premise is "Not P," making it a premise that denies P.

Wait, let's take an example. Let me think of an example where the minor premise denies the antecedent. Suppose:

Premise 1: If it rains, the ground gets wet.
Premise 2: It does not rain.
Conclusion: Therefore, the ground does not get wet.

Wait, that's straightforward. But let me think about whether this is a valid syllogism. According to syllogistic logic, if the major premise is "All P are Q" and the minor premise is "No P are not Q." Wait, that's the converse.

But in this case, Premise 2 is denying P. So, Premise 2 is "Not P." So, if the major premise is "If P, then Q," and the minor premise is "Not P," then the conclusion would be "Therefore, not Q." But wait, is that a valid conclusion? That would be the fallacy of denying the antecedent.

Wait, but in this case, the syllogism would have the major premise as "If P, then Q," minor premise as "Not P," and conclusion would be "Not Q." So, that's a direct conclusion. So, that's a valid syllogism, but in this case, the conclusion is the opposite of the major premise.

Wait, but the question is about whether a conclusion can be drawn when the minor premise denies the antecedent. So, in this case, the conclusion is that the consequent does not hold. So, the conclusion is "Not Q."

Alternatively, in the example I thought of, when the antecedent is denied, the conclusion would be that the consequent does not follow. So, if the minor premise denies the antecedent, the conclusion is the negation of the consequent.

Now, looking at the options, let's see what each option refers to.

Option A: no valid conclusion can be drawn.

Wait, but in the example I considered, the conclusion was valid. So, A is incorrect because a valid conclusion can be drawn when the minor premise denies the antecedent.

Option B: the conclusion must affirm the antecedent.

In the example, the conclusion was "Not Q," which is the negation of Q. So, it's denying the consequent, not affirming the antecedent. So, B is incorrect.

Option C: the conclusion must be a tautology.

A tautology is a statement that is always true. But in this case, the conclusion is a conditional statement, not necessarily a tautology. So, C is incorrect.

Option D: the conclusion must affirm the consequent.

In the example, the conclusion was "Not Q", which is the negation, so it's denying the consequent. So, D is incorrect.

Option E: the conclusion must be an inverse statement.

An inverse statement would be swapping the antecedent and consequent with negation. For example, the inverse of "If P, then Q" is "If not P, then not Q." But in our example, the conclusion was "Not Q" (affirming the consequent). So, E is incorrect.

Option F: the conclusion must be a conditional statement.

Yes, in our example, the conclusion was "Not Q," which is a conditional statement. So, F is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again. The options were:

A: no valid conclusion can be drawn → incorrect, because a valid conclusion can exist.

B: conclusion must affirm antecedent → no, in this case, conclusion was denying.

C: conclusion must be tautology → no.

D: conclusion must affirm consequent → no.

E: must be inverse → no.

F: must be conditional statement → yes, because the conclusion is a conditional statement.

So, the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: in the example I considered, the minor premise denies P, so the conclusion is not Q. So, the conclusion is a conditional statement (i.e., "if not P, then not Q"), which is a conditional statement. So, F is correct.

Is there any scenario where denying the antecedent leads to a conclusion that doesn't follow? No, because in the form of modus tollens, the conclusion is valid. So, in that case, the conclusion must be a conditional statement.

Wait, but in modus tollens, the conclusion is "if not P then not Q." Which is a conditional statement, so F would be correct.

So, the correct answer would be F: the conclusion must be a conditional statement.

In a conditional syllogism, when the minor premise denies the antecedent, the conclusion must be a conditional statement. This is because the structure of the syllogism leads to a conditional conclusion, which is always a valid form of reasoning. 

Answer: F
