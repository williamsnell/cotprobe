Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the amount invested based on the dividend return and the annual return percentage. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the dividend return per annum was $900, and the annual return was 6 percent. I need to find out how much was invested. Hmm, I think I remember that the formula for dividend return is something like dividend per share divided by the price per share. Wait, wait, but in this case, it's about the total investment, not per share. Oh right, the formula for total return would be (dividend received) divided by (total investment), and then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The dividend return is the total amount of dividends received divided by the total investment. So, in this scenario, the dividend return per annum is $900. The annual return rate is 6%. So, the formula should be: Dividend Return = (Dividends Received / Investment) * 100.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up the terms here. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that if the investment gives a 6% return, and that return equals $900, then $900 is 6% of the investment. So, the investment is then $900 divided by 6%, right?

Let me write this down. Let's denote the investment as 'I'. The return is 6% of I, and that's $900. So:

6% of I = $900
Which is 0.06 * I = 900

To find I, I can rearrange the equation:
I = 900 / 0.06

Calculating that: 900 divided by 0.06. Well, 900 divided by 0.06 is the same as 900 multiplied by (1/0.06). 1 divided by 0.06 is approximately 16.6667. So, 900 * 16.6667 equals 15,000. So, the investment was $15,000.

Looking at the options, option I is $15,000.00. So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

The correct answer is calculated by dividing the dividend return by the annual return percentage. 

**Calculation:**
Investment = Dividend Return / Return Percentage = 900 / 0.06 = 15,000.

**Answer:**
I: $15,000.00

Answer: I
