Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the elements identified by Leopold Pospisil. The question states that he identified four elements manifested by law: authority, universality, 'obligatio,' and then asks what the fourth is. The options are A to J, each with different legal terms.

First, I remember that Pospisil was a French lawyer known for his work in legal theory. He identified several fundamental aspects of law, so I think the question is about those. The elements mentioned are authority, universality, and obligatio. The fourth one isn't listed yet.

I think the four elements are related to the principles that govern the functioning of law. From what I recall, the four are:

1. **Authority**: This refers to the power and right to make legal decisions, like the right to action and the right to be heard. It's about the authority given by the law.

2. **Universality**: This is about the law being the same everywhere. It's the principle that laws apply uniformly across all legal systems.

3. **Obligatio**: This translates to obligation, so it's the obligation that must be fulfilled by the parties to a legal action. It's a commitment to action based on the law.

4. **Fourth element**: Since the first three are authority, universality, and obligatio, the fourth must be the remaining legal principle. I believe this is **justice**. Justice is the principle that ensures fairness and that the actions taken are based on the law, not the will of the parties.

Let me double-check. The four elements identified by Pospisil are:

1. Authority
2. Universality
3. Obligatio
4. Justice

Yes, that makes sense. The fourth is justice. So looking at the options, the answer should be D: Justice.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Could it be something else? I don't think so. The other options like hierarchy, dispute, etc., are more about the structure or processes, not the foundational principles. So I'm confident the answer is D.

The correct answer is D: Justice. This is the fourth element identified by Leopold Pospisil in his analysis of law's foundational principles.

Answer: D
