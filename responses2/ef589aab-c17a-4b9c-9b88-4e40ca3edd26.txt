Okay, so I've got this question about monopolies and their revenue curves. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that a monopoly has a straight, downward-sloping demand curve. I remember that for monopolies, the marginal revenue (MR) curve isn't the same as the demand curve. Wait, actually, the MR curve is derived from the demand curve. Since the demand is downward sloping, the MR should be the same as the demand curve but with twice the slope. Oh wait, no, because for a straight line demand, the MR curve is also straight, but it's above the demand curve for the same range, I think.

Wait, no, wait. Monopolies have MR less than the demand. Because the MR is the slope of the total revenue curve, which is a curve that starts with a steeper slope than the demand. So if the demand is linear, the MR curve will be a downward-sloping straight line that starts above the demand curve, but since at the same quantity, the MR is lower than the demand. Or wait, maybe it's that the MR is the same as the demand but shifted. Let me think: for a linear demand curve like P = a - bQ, the total revenue TR is price times quantity, so TR = P*Q = (a - bQ)*Q = aQ - bQ². Taking the derivative of TR with respect to Q gives MR as a - 2bQ. Comparing that to the demand curve, which is P = a - bQ, we can see that MR is a bit different. So when Q is zero, MR is a, same as demand. But as Q increases, the slope of MR becomes negative, so MR is lower than the demand curve at each quantity.

Wait, but when you plot MR and demand, the demand is downward sloping, and the MR starts at the same point as the demand but for the same quantity, but then becomes less steep. So the MR curve is also downward sloping, but it's actually the same slope as the demand but with a different intercept. Or wait, maybe it's the same slope but shifted. Like, for each quantity, the MR is the same as the demand, but because MR is the derivative of TR, which is P*Q, the demand is a -bQ, TR is aQ - bQ². So MR is a -2bQ, which is indeed less steep than the demand.

So the MR curve is a straight line with the same slope as the demand curve but lower in value. So for the same quantity, MR is lower than the demand curve. But wait, since the demand is downward sloping, MR is also downward sloping, but with a different intercept. So the MR curve is also straight and downward sloping.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says initially upward sloping and then downward. I don't think so. Monopolies have MR that's downward sloping throughout, unless perhaps in the case of two-part pricing or something else, but in standard monopoly scenarios, it's just a straight line.

Option B: same as the demand. No, because MR is below the demand curve at every point.

Option C: in the shape of a U. I don't think so. The MR is a straight line, not a curve. So it can't form a U shape. So Option C is wrong.

Option D: inverse of the demand. The inverse demand is just the same as the demand function, so that's not the case either. Because MR is not the same as the inverse demand because it's a different function.

Option E: parallel to the demand. No, because their slopes are the same except for the intercept. So they're not parallel; they have the same slope but different positions.

Option F: upward sloping. No, because MR is downward sloping for a monopoly with a linear demand curve.

Option G: halfway between the demand and the vertical axis. Hmm, not sure. Doesn't seem like that's the case.

Option H: initially downward and then upward. That would be the case if demand was linear and the revenue was a maximum somewhere, but in this case, it's a straight line, so the MR is always downward sloping without any change in slope. So H is incorrect.

Option I: horizontal. No, because horizontal would mean MR is constant, which isn't the case. It's always downward sloping.

Option J: perpendicular. That's a 90-degree angle, which would mean one is horizontal and the other vertical. But that's not the case. So J is incorrect.

So going back, the correct answer should be that the MR is straight and downward sloping, same as the demand, but lower at each quantity. Thus, the MR curve is also a straight line, but its slope is the same as demand, and it's downward. So looking at the options, the closest is option E: parallel to the demand curve. Wait, no, because their slopes are the same but different intercepts. So the MR curve is a straight line with the same slope as the demand, but it's shifted. So if the demand is downward sloping, the MR is also downward sloping, same slope, but different intercept. So is their slope the same, so the curves are parallel? Wait, not exactly. Parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. So if the demand is P = a - bQ, then the MR is P = (a - 2bQ). So the slope is -b, same as demand, but the intercept is a, different from the demand's intercept 'a' in the same way. So the two lines are parallel. So both the demand and MR are downward sloping, same slope, so they are parallel.

Wait, but the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So if the correct option is E, which says parallel, then the last letter is E. So the answer is E.

For a monopoly with a straight, downward-sloping demand curve, the marginal revenue (MR) curve is derived as follows: the demand curve is linear, say \( P = a - bq \), and the total revenue (TR) is \( TR = P \times Q = (a - bq)q = aq - bq^2 \). Taking the derivative of TR with respect to \( Q \) gives the MR curve: \( MR = a - 2bq \). This shows that MR is also downward sloping but has a different intercept than the demand curve. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The MR curve is not initially upward sloping.
- **B**: Incorrect. The MR curve is not the same as the demand curve; it is below it.
- **C**: Incorrect. The MR curve is straight, not curved.
- **D**: Incorrect. The MR curve is not the inverse of the demand curve.
- **E**: Correct. The MR curve is parallel to the demand curve because they both have the same slope \( -b \), but different intercepts.
- **F**: Incorrect. The MR curve is downward sloping, not upward.
- **G**: Incorrect. The MR curve is not halfway between the demand curve and the vertical axis.
- **H**: Incorrect. The MR curve is not initially downward sloping and then upward sloping.
- **I**: Incorrect. The MR curve is not horizontal.
- **J**: Incorrect. The MR curve is not perpendicular to the demand curve.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: parallel to the demand curve**.
