Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about the preparation of hydrogen chloride gas by heating sodium chloride with sulfuric acid. I remember that when NaCl reacts with H2SO4, it produces Na2SO4 and HCl gas. So the balanced equation is 2NaCl + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2HCl. 

The problem gives me the mass of NaCl as 234 grams, and asks for the mass of HCl produced. The molecular weights are NaCl = 58.5 g/mol and HCl = 36.5 g/mol. I think I need to use stoichiometry here. 

First, I should write down the balanced equation again to make sure I have all the moles right. The balanced equation is 2 moles of NaCl reacting to produce 2 moles of HCl. Wait, no, looking again, the reaction produces 2 moles of HCl from 2 moles of NaCl, right? Because the balanced equation is 2 NaCl + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 HCl. So for every 2 moles of NaCl, you get 2 moles of HCl. So the mole ratio between NaCl and HCl is 1:1. 

So the first step is to find out how many moles of NaCl are present in 234 grams. The molecular weight of NaCl is 58.5 g/mol. So moles = mass / molecular weight. So 234 g divided by 58.5 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 

234 ÷ 58.5. Hmm, 58.5 times 4 is 234. So that's 4 moles of NaCl. Oh, because 58.5 *4 = 234. So 4 moles of NaCl. 

Since the mole ratio between NaCl and HCl is 1:1, that means 4 moles of NaCl will produce 4 moles of HCl. 

Now, each mole of HCl has a molecular weight of 36.5 g/mol. So the mass of HCl produced would be moles * molar mass. So 4 moles * 36.5 g/mol. Let's compute that. 

4 * 36.5 = 146 grams. 

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Oh, wait, sometimes in stoichiometry there are other steps like limiting reagents, but in this case, the problem states that H2SO4 is in excess, so there’s no limiting reagent here. So all the NaCl will react, and the HCl produced is 4 moles. 

So the mass of HCl is 4 * 36.5 = 146 grams. Looking back at the options, option D is 146 g HCl. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the mass of HCl produced when 234 g of NaCl is heated with excess H₂SO₄, we use the balanced chemical equation: 

**2NaCl + H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄ + 2HCl**

### Step 1: Calculate moles of NaCl
The molecular weight of NaCl is 58.5 g/mol. Using the formula:

\[
\text{moles of NaCl} = \frac{\text{mass of NaCl}}{\text{molecular weight of NaCl}} = \frac{234}{58.5} = 4 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 2: Determine moles of HCl
From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaCl produce 2 moles of HCl. Thus, the mole ratio of NaCl to HCl is 1:1. Since 4 moles of NaCl are present, 4 moles of HCl are produced.

\[
\text{moles of HCl} = 4 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate mass of HCl
The molecular weight of HCl is 36.5 g/mol. Using the formula:

\[
\text{mass of HCl} = \text{moles of HCl} \times \text{molecular weight of HCl} = 4 \times 36.5 = 146 \, \text{g}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mass of HCl produced is **146 g**.
