Question:

The parathyroid glands in man are small, pealike organs. They are ususally four in number and are located on the surface of the thyroid. What is the function of these glands?

Options:

A: The parathyroid glands produce insulin to regulate blood sugar levels
B: The parathyroid glands regulate blood pressure
C: The parathyroid glands control breathing rate
D: The parathyroid glands secrete enzymes that break down proteins
E: The parathyroid glands control the balance of electrolytes in the body
F: The parathyroid glands secrete hormones that stimulate red blood cell production
G: The parathyroid glands are responsible for filtering waste from the blood
H: The parathyroid glands regulate the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues
I: The parathyroid glands regulate body temperature
J: The parathyroid glands aid in digestion

Okay, so I have this question about parathyroid glands. Hmm, I remember that the parathyroid glands are involved with calcium production. Let me think. The parathyroid glands are part of the thyroid, right? And they have two main functions. Oh wait, I think one of them is related to regulating calcium levels. 

Wait, the parathyroid glands are called "parathyroid" because of the "sar" in "sarcomere." Sarcomeres are the units of muscle tissue, so parathyroid would mean similar to the parathyroid hormones, which regulate calcium. 

The question is asking what the parathyroid glands do. So the options are various functions. Let me read the options again. 

Option H says they regulate the calcium-phosphate balance. Oh yeah, that's right. I remember that the parathyroid glands secrete hormones called parathyroid hormone (PTH) which helps maintain calcium balance. If too little calcium is in the body, PTH helps increase it. If there's too much, it can help decrease it. So they're involved in regulating that balance.

Other options: Option A says they produce insulin. No, insulin is made by the pancreas, specifically the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Parathyroid glands don't make insulin. Option B talks about blood pressure, which is something else, maybe the heart or diaphragm? I don't think parathyroid hormones affect blood pressure. Option C about breathingâ€”no, that's unrelated. Option D is enzymes breaking down proteins, again unrelated. Option E is about electrolytes. Wait, parathyroid hormones affect electrolytes too, like calcium and phosphate. But the main function is calcium. Option F is about red blood cells, which is about erythropoiesis, not parathyroids. Option G is about waste filtering, which is another system. Option J is about digestion, which is unrelated. 

So, the correct answer must be H. They regulate the calcium-phosphate balance. I think I remember this correctly. So H is the right answer.

The parathyroid glands in man are responsible for regulating the calcium-phosphate balance in the body. They do this by secreting hormones, specifically parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps maintain an optimal calcium level. 

Answer: H
