Okay, so I have this question about logic gates and which sets are universal. Hmm, I remember that a universal gate is one that can be used to create any other type of gate through combinations. Let me think about each option.

I remember that NAND and NOR are universal gates. Because you can build any other gates using them. So, let's look at the options.

Option A: XOR, XNOR, NOR. Wait, XOR isn't universal. XNOR is the same as NOT XOR, so I don't think you can make all gates from just XOR and XNOR. Also, the presence of NOR might help, but maybe not on its own. So probably not A.

Option B: OR, NOT, AND. Wait, OR and AND are part of the universal set, but without NOT. Wait, no, because NOT is a universal gate by itself. Oh, no, wait. If you have OR, AND, and NOT, then you can make all. But in this set, do we have NOT? No. So without NOT, this set is not universal. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: NOR, NAND, XNOR. Hmm, all three of these are combinations of NAND and NOR. Since NAND and NOR are universal, any combination of them can make everything. So C is a set of universal gates.

Option D: AND, OR. These two alone aren't enough. You need NOT to make NOT. So unless you have AND, OR, and NOT, which is a universal set. But D doesn't include NOT. So D isn't universal.

Option E: OR, XOR, NOT. Wait, XOR is a combination of OR and NOT. But without NOT, you can't make NOT. So E doesn't have NOT, so it's not universal.

Option F: XOR, XNOR. XNOR is same as NOT XOR. But without NOT, you can't create the NOT gate. So F isn't universal on its own.

Option G: AND, OR, NOT. Ah, this is a universal set. Because with AND, OR, and NOT, you can create any gate. So G is universal.

Option H: NOT, AND, NAND. Wait, NAND can be made from NOT and AND. But if you have NOT, AND, and NAND, can you make OR? Because NAND is the same as NOT (A AND B)'. So OR could be made by NAND applied to the same variables. But wait, NAND alone isn't universal, but with NOT, AND, and NAND, you can make OR. So G and H are both sets of universal gates.

Wait, looking back. Let me clarify. The question is, which sets are universal.

Option G: AND, OR, NOT. Yes, that's universal.

Option H: NOT, AND, NAND. Let me think. If you have NOT, AND, and NAND, can you get OR?

NAND is equivalent to NOT(AND(A,B)). So, NAND(A,B) = NOT(AB). 

If you have NOT, AND, and NAND, then you can make OR. How? Because OR(A,B) is NOT( (NOT A) AND (NOT B) ). Wait, but I have NOT, so maybe:

OR(A,B) = (A NAND (NOT A)) AND (B NAND (NOT B)) )? No, that's not right. Alternatively, OR can be written as (A + B), but how to get that from the available gates.

Wait, let's think: since NAND gives NOT(A AND B), which is equivalent to (NOT A) NAND (NOT B). So, if I have NOT, AND, and NAND, can I build OR?

Another approach: since NAND is universal by itself. Wait, no. Because without a NOT gate, NAND alone can't make NOT. But in this set, you have NOT, AND, and NAND. So, for example, if you have a NAND gate, and you apply NOT to it, you can get OR. Let me see:

Suppose I have a NAND gate, which is NOT(A AND B). So, for OR(A,B), I need to get A OR B.

Wait, another way: the standard formula for OR is (A + B). But in terms of NAND, OR is equal to (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B), because (A NAND A) is NOT A, similarly for B. So:

(A NAND A) is NOT A, same for B. Then, (NOT A) NAND (NOT B) is NOT( (NOT A) AND (NOT B) ), which is A OR B. So yes, you can make OR using NOT, AND, and NAND. So G and H both have universal sets.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

The question says which sets are universal. So the options are A to J. Each option is a set. So, the correct options are the ones that are universal.

Wait, the question is asking which sets are universal, so I should pick all that apply. But let me recheck each option.

Wait, option G: AND, OR, NOT. Yes, that's universal.

Option H: NOT, AND, NAND. Wait, NAND is equivalent to NOT(A AND B), which is (NOT A) NAND (NOT B). So, in this set, you can create NOT and NAND. But wait, if you have NOT, AND, and NAND, can you make OR?

Wait, I think if you have NAND, then NOT(A) can be made by just applying NOT once. The question is, can you make OR from these gates.

Wait, I thought earlier that OR can be constructed via NANDs. Let me think again. NAND(A,B) is NOT(A AND B). So, if I have NAND, I can make A OR B by combining some of them.

Alternatively, since NAND is universal, but in this set, you have NOT, AND, and NAND. So, perhaps you can make OR using NAND and NOT.

Wait, another approach:

To create OR, you can do (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B). Because (A NAND A) is NOT A, and (B NAND B) is NOT B. So, (NOT A) NAND (NOT B) is equivalent to (A AND B)' (which is OR). So, Yes, OR can be made.

So, the set H is a universal set.

So then, options G and H.

Wait, but looking again, the options given were:

A: XOR,XNOR,NOR.

B: OR,NOT,AND.

C: NOR, NAND, XNOR.

D: AND, OR.

E: OR, XOR, NOT.

F: XOR, XNOR.

G: AND, OR, NOT.

H: NOT, AND, NAND.

I: XOR, NOR, NAND.

J: NOR, NAND.

Wait, the options for the question are A to J as the options. The question asks which sets are universal.

So the correct sets are G and H.

But looking back, the initial question lists each option as a possible set, and the options A to J are each a set. So the question is, which of these are universal.

So in the options, G and H are universal sets.

Wait, but wait, in the initial problem statement, the options are A to J, each being a possible set.

So the correct sets are G and H.

Wait, but looking back, the options given were:

Looking back, the question is, which sets are universal.

So, the correct options are G and H.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for each option (A to J), the question is, which of these sets are universal.

Wait, no, the question says, "Which of these sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates?"

And then the options are A to J, each being a possible set.

So, the question is, for each set (A to J), which are universal.

So in the options, the correct answers are G and H.

Wait, but looking at the options, I have to pick from A to J, which of the following groups are universal.

So, the correct sets are G and H.

But wait, looking back, in the options, let me check which of the options are universal.

Option G: AND, OR, NOT. So that's definitely a universal set.

Option H: NOT, AND, NAND. Also yes.

So the answer is options G and H.

Wait, but the problem is asking which sets are universal, so possible options are G and H.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each of which is a possible set. So for the question, which of the following options (A to J) are universal.

So the correct answer is options G and H.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the initial question says: Which of these sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates?

The options are A to J, each a set.

So, the correct answer is the sets that are universal.

So, the options G and H are universal.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible choices are G and H.

Wait, but the question is to select the answer, which is one of the options A to J. So perhaps the correct answer is G and H.

But wait, the options are letters, each being a possible set. So the correct answer includes both G and H.

But in the options, the question gives each option as a set. So the correct answer is which of the options (A to J) is the correct universal set.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

A: XOR, XNOR, NOR.

B: OR, NOT, AND.

C: NOR, NAND, XNOR.

D: AND, OR.

E: OR, XOR, NOT.

F: XOR, XNOR.

G: AND, OR, NOT.

H: NOT, AND, NAND.

I: XOR, NOR, NAND.

J: NOR, NAND.

So, the correct sets are G and H.

Wait, but the question is, which of these sets are universal. So options G and H are correct.

But wait, the options are provided as A to J, each being a set, and the question is which set is universal. So the answer options are the letters that correspond to the correct sets.

Thus, the correct answer is options G and H.

But wait, looking at the multiple-choice options, the answer is to choose which of the options A to J are correct. So in the problem, the question says:

Which of these sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates?

Options are A to J.

Each of A to J is a possible set.

Thus, the correct answers would be the sets G and H.

But looking back, in the problem, the options are:

A: XOR, XNOR, NOR.

B: OR, NOT, AND.

C: NOR, NAND, XNOR.

D: AND, OR.

E: OR, XOR, NOT.

F: XOR, XNOR.

G: AND, OR, NOT.

H: NOT, AND, NAND.

I: XOR, NOR, NAND.

J: NOR, NAND.

So, the correct answer is options G and H are universal.

Wait, but I think in the problem statement, the intended answer is to pick one of the options, not multiple. Wait, perhaps the question is more about which of the given options (A-J) is a correct set.

Wait, the question is, "Which of these sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates?"

So, the correct answer options are those that are universal sets. So, among the options A to J, which are the correct universal sets.

Thus, the correct options are G and H.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each as a possible set. So, each letter is a possible set, and the question is which are the correct ones.

Wait, the question is asking which of these sets are universal. So the correct answer would be the letters G and H.

But looking at the list, the options are letters, and each letter represents a possible set. So the correct answer is the letters G and H.

To determine which sets of logic gates are universal, we need to recall that a universal set of gates is one that can be used to create any other type of gate through combinations. The key universal gates are NAND and NOR, as they can be combined to create any other logic gate.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A: XOR, XNOR, NOR**  
  XOR and XNOR are not universal. Without NOT, you cannot create the NOT gate, which is essential for a universal set. Additionally, while NOT can be derived from XOR, the presence of XOR in this set makes it non-universal.  
  **Not Universal.**

- **B: OR, NOT, AND**  
  This set includes NOT, which is a universal gate. However, it does not include NAND or NOR, so it cannot be used to create a universal set by itself.  
  **Not Universal.**

- **C: NOR, NAND, XNOR**  
  All three gates are combinations of NAND and NOR, which are universal. Therefore, this set can create any other gate.  
  **Universal.**

- **D: AND, OR**  
  Without NOT, this set cannot generate the NOT gate, which is essential for universality.  
  **Not Universal.**

- **E: OR, XOR, NOT**  
  XOR is a combination of NOT and AND. However, without NOT, you cannot create the NOT gate, making this set non-universal.  
  **Not Universal.**

- **F: XOR, XNOR**  
  Similar to option E, these gates rely on NOT to function, so they cannot be used to create a universal set.  
  **Not Universal.**

- **G: AND, OR, NOT**  
  This set includes NOT, which is universal. Together with AND and OR, any gate can be constructed.  
  **Universal.**

- **H: NOT, AND, NAND**  
  NAND is equivalent to NOT(AND(A, B)). With NOT and AND, NAND can be used to create OR via De Morgan's Law. Therefore, this set is universal.  
  **Universal.**

- **I: XOR, NOR, NAND**  
  XOR is a combination of NOT and AND. Without NOT, this set cannot function as a universal set.  
  **Not Universal.**

- **J: NOR, NAND**  
  NAND is the universal gate, and NOR can be derived from NAND (NOR = NOT(NAND(A, B))). Thus, this set is universal.  
  **Universal.**

### Conclusion:
The sets that are designated as universal gates are **G**, **H**, and **J**.

ANSWER: G, H, J
