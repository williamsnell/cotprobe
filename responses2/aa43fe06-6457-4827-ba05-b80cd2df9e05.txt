Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. The question says a car covers 30 miles in half an hour. I need to find its speed in miles per hour and in feet per second. The options are A to J, each with different speed values. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, speed is calculated as distance divided by time. So the car goes 30 miles in 0.5 hours. So, in miles per hour, that's 30 divided by 0.5, which is 60 mph. Wait, that makes sense because 0.5 hours is half an hour, so doubling the distance (30 miles) gives 60 mph. So the first part seems straightforward.

Now for the feet per second part. Oh wait, I need to convert miles to feet and hours to seconds. Let me remember the conversion factors. I know that 1 mile is 5280 feet. And 1 hour is 3600 seconds because 60 minutes times 60 seconds is 3600. So, 30 miles is 30 * 5280 feet. Let me calculate that: 30 * 5280. 30 times 5000 is 150,000, and 30 times 280 is 8,400. So 150,000 + 8,400 = 158,400 feet.

The time is 0.5 hours, which is 1800 seconds. So the speed in feet per second is 158,400 feet divided by 1800 seconds. Let's compute that: 158400 / 1800. Let me see, 158400 divided by 1800. Well, 1800 times 88 is 158,400 because 1800 * 80 is 144000, and 1800 *8 is 14400, so 144000 +14400 =158400. So that's 88 ft/s. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. So 30 miles is 30 * 5280 =158400 ft. 0.5 hours is 0.5 *3600 = 1800 sec. So 158400 / 1800. Let me simplify this division. Both numbers are divisible by 100. So 158400 / 1800 = 1584 / 18. Let me divide 1584 by 18: 18*88 is 1584, so yes, 88. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, the speed in mph is 60, and in ft/s it's 88. Let's check the options. Option E says 60 mi/hr and 88 ft/s. Option I says 60 mi/hr and 88 ft/s. Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option E: 60 mi/hr, 88 ft/s. Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be E. But wait, let me check other options just to be sure. Option I is the same as E, so no, I can't choose that again. So E is the answer.

The car's speed is calculated by dividing the distance by time. The car covers 30 miles in 0.5 hours, so its speed is 60 miles per hour. To convert this to feet per second, we multiply by the conversion factor of 5280 feet per mile and divide by 3600 seconds per hour. This gives 88 feet per second. Among the options, only E (60 mi/hr, 88 ft/s) correctly matches these calculations.

Answer: E
