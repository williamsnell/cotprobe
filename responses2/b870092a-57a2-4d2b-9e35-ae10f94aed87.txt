Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state)."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an election from the 19th century, specifically the election of 1864 at the Emancipation Proclamation. I remember this was a significant event because it was the start of the Civil War. The question gives me a passage and asks which conclusion best supports the excerpt.

Let me read through the passage again to make sure I understand it. The passage mentions that Lincoln was reelected because he won 78% of the Union voters, which was a landslide against McClellan. It says that McClellan won New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Also, it talks about the political parties' support: Republicans drew support from various groups like Native Americans, skilled workers, New Englanders, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in cities and Irish- and German-Americans.

The passage also notes that Republicans took back several state legislatures and lost the governorship of New Jersey, which was McClellan's home state. It mentions that Lincoln received 78% of the Union soldiers and sailors' votes, which wasn't crucial for his election but was symbolic.

Now, the question gives several options, and I need to pick the best conclusion based on the passage. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf. Hmm, the passage doesn't directly state that Lincoln's campaign helped Republicans. It says Republicans took back several state legislatures, but it doesn't say he was responsible for that. So maybe A is not supported.

Option B: Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War. Wait, the passage says Lincoln was reelected because he won 78% of the Union voters, which were the voters who supported the Union in the Civil War. So yes, his election was because of the Civil War successes. So B seems correct.

Option C: McClellan's home state, New Jersey, was the only state where he had significant support. The passage says McClellan won New Jersey (and others), but it doesn't specify that he was the only state. So C isn't necessarily supported.

Option D: The number of votes cast in 1864 was one of the lowest in the nineteenth century. The passage says Lincoln won 78% of the Union voters, which was a re-election. But the passage doesn't give the exact percentage and doesn't compare it to historical averages. It's possible that it was lower than other years, but it's not explicitly stated. So I'm not sure about D; maybe it's not supported.

Option E: The majority of Lincoln's votes came from military personnel. The passage mentions that the Democrats were strongest in cities and among Irish- and German-Americans, implying the Democratic base was in cities and rural areas. But it doesn't mention military personnel. So E might not be supported.

Option F: The majority of Lincoln's votes came from military personnel. I don't see F mentioned in the passage. The passage talks about Democrats gaining seats and support from certain groups, but not necessarily military support. So F is likely not correct.

Option G: The Democrats' stronghold was in the rural areas and among farmers. The passage says Democrats were strongest in cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (which are more populous) but it doesn't say anything about rural areas or farmers. So G isn't supported.

Option H: Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states. The passage states that Lincoln was re-elected because he won 78% of the Union voters, which were the voters who supported the Union. So if Union voters are the ones Lincoln won, it's the majority of the Union voters, which would be in the heavily populated states. But the passage doesn't specify that Lincoln's votes came from the heavily populated; it just says he got 78% of the Union voters. So H might not be supported.

Option I: The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in 1864. The passage doesn't mention anything about the Emancipation Proclamation or the black vote in this context. It talks about the Civil War, but not about the Emancipation Proclamation. So I's not supported.

Option J: Lincoln's victory was primarily due to the support of the immigrant population. The passage states that immigrants (like Native Americans, skilled workers, etc.) supported Lincoln. But the idea is that immigrants were the main driver, not the majority. The passage says immigrants were a strong support group, but it doesn't say immigrants were the majority. So J might not be the best conclusion.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B says "due to Union successes during the Civil War." The passage says Lincoln was reelected because he won 78% of the Union voters, which were the ones who supported the Union. Since the Civil War was the conflict in the North, the majority of Lincoln's votes would be Union voters, who were the ones supporting the Union. So yes, B seems correct.

Other options: Let's see. Option D says the votes were one of the lowest in the 19th century. The passage doesn't provide that information, so D isn't supported. Similarly, E talks about military support, which isn't mentioned. So the best answer is B.
</think>

The correct answer is:

**B: Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.**

The passage explicitly states that Lincoln was reelected because he won 78% of the Union voters, which were the voters who supported the Union during the Civil War. This directly supports the conclusion that Lincoln's victory was due to the Civil War's successes in the North.
