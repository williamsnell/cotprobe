Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question about property taxes and gains. Let me read it again.

Decker sold his principal residence for $500,000 after all selling expenses. He bought it 15 years ago for $200,000. Then, six months later, he bought a new house for $60,000. The question is about how much gain he should recognize from the sale of the principal residence.

Hmm. I remember that for property taxes, especially with principal residence, you can only claim the taxes paid on the sale of the principal property. So, the gains from other properties are not deductible against the sale.

Wait, but wait. The problem says he sold his principal residence. So, his basis is $200,000, but he bought a new house afterward. I think the new house doesn't affect the sale's basis because he's still on the original principal residence.

Right, so the sale is from the original house. The sale price is $500k. So, the gain would be sale price minus basis, which is $500k - $200k = $300k. But wait, is there any tax deduction here?

Wait, another thing: are the taxes on the sale of principal property subject to property taxes? Because if so, he could have some deductions. But wait, the sale is considered a sale of principal property, so the taxes are considered a sale of principal property, which is a sale of personal property subject to property taxes. So, the taxes would be taxed as a sale of principal property, but in terms of gains, do property taxes count as a gain?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because in some tax codes, the sale of principal property is treated as a sale, so the taxes are considered part of the sale, but the gain is still subtracted. Wait, but in the case where you have a sale of principal property, the basis is increased because you can deduct property taxes on the sale. Or is that not the case?

Wait, the basis increases by the amount of taxes paid on the sale. But wait, the problem doesn't give us the tax rates. Oh, wait, the question is about the amount of gain recognized, not the tax amount. So perhaps I don't need to think about the tax, but just the accounting treatment.

So, for property taxes, if the sale is considered a sale of principal property, the property taxes are treated as part of the sale. But for tax purposes, that means the tax is considered a part of the sale, so the gain is calculated as the sale price minus the adjusted basis. But the adjusted basis here is the original basis plus any gains from other properties.

Wait, but in this case, he's sold the principal residence, so his basis is 200k. Then, he bought a new house for 60k, but that doesn't affect the sale of the principal residence. So the basis remains at 200k. So the gain is 500k - 200k = 300k. But wait, did he have any deductions for property taxes? Because the sale is considered a principal residence sale, so the taxes are treated as part of the sale, meaning property taxes are not a deduction against the sale.

Wait, no. Wait, the tax treatment: if the sale is of principal property, the tax is considered a sale of principal property. So, the property taxes are part of the sale. But that doesn't affect the basis. So the gain is the sale price minus the basis, which is 300k.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when you sell a principal residence, you can deduct property taxes on the sale, which is a deduction. So in that case, the gain would be less because the tax is a deduction, not a gain. But the question is about the amount of gain recognized, not the total deductions.

Wait, the question is about the gain from the sale of the principal residence. So, regardless of the taxes, the basis is 200k. So the sale price is 500k, so 300k gain. So the correct answer should be 300k. But wait, looking at the options, option C is $300,000. But I'm not sure if there's any other factor here.

Wait, another thing: When you sell a principal property, you can't deduct the sale price minus the adjusted basis as a gain. But in this case, the question is about the amount of gain recognized, not the tax. So the tax aspect doesn't affect the basis. So the basis is still 200k, so gain is 300k. So the answer should be C.

But I'm getting a bit confused because I've heard sometimes that if you're still on the principal residence, you can't deduct the taxes because it's a sale of a principal property. Wait, no, the tax on the sale is still considered a part of the sale. So the tax is not a deduction, but it's part of the sale's accounting. So the basis remains 200k.

Wait, so gain is 300k. So the correct answer would be C, $300,000.

Decker sold his principal residence for $500,000, with a basis of $200,000 at the time of sale. The sale of principal property does not allow the sale price minus basis to be treated as a gain; instead, the gain is calculated as the sale price minus the adjusted basis. Since the sale of the principal residence is treated as a sale of principal property, the gain is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000. 

The tax implications of the sale, such as property taxes, are considered part of the sale and do not affect the basis or the gain. Therefore, the amount of gain recognized from the sale of the principal residence is $300,000.
