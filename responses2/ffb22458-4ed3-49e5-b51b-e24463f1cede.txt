Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this biology question about why animal cells are relatively small. The question is asking why they are smaller than larger cells. Let me think through this step by step.

I remember that when cells grow, their size can affect their function. Smaller cells might have a harder time maintaining their shape, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, the question is about relative size compared to larger cells. So, why are animal cells small?

I think about the surface area to volume ratio. Surface area is the surface that gets exposed, and volume is the space inside. The surface area to volume ratio is important because it affects how efficiently cells can get nutrients into their cells and how they can exchange materials with their environment.

If a cell is too big, its volume increases a lot faster than its surface area. Imagine a cube. If it doubles in size, its volume increases by a factor of 8, but the surface area only increases by 4. So, the surface area to volume ratio goes down. That ratio is crucial because it determines how well a cell can exchange materials. If a cell has a low surface area to volume ratio, it can't get as much of the inside materials (like oxygen, nutrients) before the space inside the cell becomes too small and the cell can't function properly.

So, for a cell to function efficiently, it needs a high surface area to volume ratio. A smaller cell has a higher ratio because its volume isn't as big, so the surface area relative to the volume is larger. That allows the cell to exchange materials more effectively. 

Looking at the options, option F says "Smaller cells have a larger surface-to-volume ratio." That sounds right. Let me see if any other option makes sense. Option E talks about multiplying faster. While smaller cells can divide more rapidly, the question is about their size relative to larger ones, not their ability to grow. So, why are they small compared to others? It's about their function, not their growth rate.

Option G says "Smaller cells are easier to regenerate." That's more about regrowth rather than their size in comparison to larger cells. So, not the right answer.

Option E is about multiplication, which I think is more about growth rather than size. So, F seems to be the correct answer.

The answer is F: Smaller cells have a larger surface-to-volume ratio. This is because a smaller cell has a higher surface area relative to its volume, allowing for efficient material exchange. This is crucial for maintaining function and survival.

Answer: F
