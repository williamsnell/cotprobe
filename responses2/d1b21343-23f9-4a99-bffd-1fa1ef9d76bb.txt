Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether the government plays a major role in an economy under a pure capitalist system. Let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that a pure capitalist system is one where the government doesn't have much control over the economy. Instead, the private sector drives everything. But wait, that's not entirely right. I think some key players might still have some influence, but not as much as in other systems.

The question is asking whether the government has a major role. The options are A to J, each describing different scenarios.

Option A says the government intervenes only during crises to stabilize the market. I'm not sure about this. I think in capitalism, private enterprises are encouraged to run their own businesses, so the government's role might be limited. Intervening during crises seems more like a socialist approach, maybe? Like in the UK's case, where the government can act during economic downturns.

Option B: Government minor role, enforcing contracts and property rights. That aligns with the idea that the government isn't in charge, but doesn't control everything. Private property rights and contracts are probably enforced, but the government doesn't actually hold the power.

Option C: No government intervention. That sounds more like socialism. In capitalism, the government isn't the sole authority. Private enterprises are the main drivers. So this doesn't fit a pure capitalist system.

Option D: Government provides public goods but doesn't control private enterprise. This seems correct. In capitalist systems, the government does provide things like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. It doesn't control where businesses and what they do. Private enterprises run the factories and services.

Option E: Limited government intervention in defense and public safety. That could be part of a socialist approach, as governments are more involved in defense. So this doesn't fit a pure capitalist model.

Option F: Government sets minimum wage and workplace safety standards but isn't involved. While setting these is a government action, it's not the primary role of the government. More about regulation than control.

Option G: Government controls all aspects. That's how socialism works. The government has total control, so this isn't a capitalist system.

Option H: Regulate certain industries but not the economy. Again, this sounds more like socialism, where specific sectors have government oversight but the economy is mostly private.

Option I: Set prices for all goods. No, that's more like a command economy. The government sets prices, so not a pure capitalist system.

Option J: Government owns all businesses and properties. That's the socialist idea, where the government owns everything. So this isn't a capitalist system.

Putting it together, the correct answer should be D. The government doesn't control private enterprise; instead, it provides public goods and acts as a regulator, allowing private enterprises to drive the economy.

The correct answer is:

**D: Government provides public goods and services but does not control private enterprise**

This aligns with the characteristics of a pure capitalist system, where the government does not directly control private enterprises but provides public services and regulates certain industries, allowing private businesses to drive economic development.
