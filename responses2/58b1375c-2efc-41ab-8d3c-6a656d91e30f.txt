Question:

A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?

Options:

A: Fibroma
B: Mucinous cystadenoma
C: Clear cell carcinoma
D: Teratoma
E: Brenner tumor
F: Serous cystadenoma
G: Endometrioid tumor
H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor
I: Ovarian carcinoid
J: Granulosa tumor

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's see... So the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a 6-month history of increased facial hair. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago, so that's not too recent. She's 165 cm tall and 5 ft 5 inches, which is a bit over 5 feet. Weight is 70 kg, which is about 154 pounds. Her BMI is 26 kg/mÂ², which seems a bit high, but not super concerning unless it's unstable. Her pulse is 80 per minute, which is a bit high, maybe indicative of something like high-frequency heartbeat. Blood pressure is 130/82, which is a normal range, so that's not unusual.

Looking at the physical exam, she has temporal (lower) balding hair and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. That's a classic sign of endometriosis, a condition where endocrine cells from the ovary migrate to the lower genital area. So that's one sign pointing towards that.

Her serum testosterone is increased. Testosterone levels are high in women with endometriosis, so that makes sense. The other serum levels are normal: androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. I remember that elevated testosterone and the absence of these and other steroids are key in ruling out androgens. Also, the presence of a ovarian mass is noted.

The ultrasonography shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. So putting it all together: increased testosterone (androgen levels), endometriosis causing the mass, and the physical signs of hair loss. 

Now, what types of masses are associated with endometriosis? I think there are a few possibilities. The most common is the endometrium itself, which is a fibroid or fibroma. But in some cases, especially with other factors like increased testosterone and endometriosis, it could be a more advanced condition.

Looking at the options:

A: Fibroma - A fibromas is a type of fibroid, which is a benign mass. But if it's high with other factors, maybe it's more advanced.

B: Mucinous cystadenoma - I don't think that's a typical term. Cystadenoma is more of a benign pituitary mass, and mucinous sounds like it might be something else.

C: Clear cell carcinoma - That's a benign tumor, but given the other factors, I think it's more likely benign.

D: Teratoma - That's a type of benign tumor, but again, given the hormonal and physical signs, I think it's less likely.

E: Brenner tumor - These are more common in certain ethnic groups and I don't think this patient's profile fits that.

F: Serous cystadenoma - Cystadenoma is a pituitary mass, not ovarian. Serous sounds like a different mass.

G: Endometrioid tumor - That is a benign tumor that develops from endometriosis. So that's a possible option.

H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor - Those are related to the ovarian development, maybe in certain cancers like endometriosis.

I: Ovarian carcinoid - Carcinoids are benign tumors that resemble tumors. But the patient has a mass of 12 cm, which could be a benign or malignant tumor.

J: Granulosa tumor - These are found in certain skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis. Not matching here.

So the most likely is either G (endometrioid tumor) or I (ovarian carcinoid). But wait, the patient has a 12-cm mass. That's a significant size. Endometrioids are usually benign and can be small, but in some cases, especially if there's high testosterone and other signs, they might become malignant. But I'm not sure if a 12 cm mass is typical for a cancer. Also, endometrioid tumors are usually benign, so perhaps option G is the right choice.

Wait, but the mass is on the ovarian side. So if it's an endometrioid tumor, it's localized to the ovary. Alternatively, some endometriosis can become a cancer. So let me think, the patient's last menstrual period is 4 months ago, so she's 40, and her last period is in the last 4 months. So her endometriosis might be more advanced, leading to a cancer.

But another thought: the presence of a mass in the ovarian area with high testosterone and endometriosis could indicate a more advanced condition. So perhaps it's a serous cystadenoma, which is endometrioid and cystic. Wait, but cystadenomas are typically less common than endometrioids. Or maybe it's a serous cystadenoma, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I'm a bit mixed up. Cystadenomas are usually in the pituitary gland. The term "mucinous cystadenoma" might be a typo or misnomer. The options have "serous cystadenoma," which I think refers to endometrioid cysts, which are part of the endometrium. So maybe that's option F. Or perhaps not.

Wait, another angle: the patient's last menstrual period was 4 months ago, so her endometriosis might be more advanced. The 12 cm mass sounds significant. I think endometrioid tumors can grow into ovarian cancer, especially if there's a lot of endogenous testosterone. So perhaps the correct answer is G: endometrioid tumor.

But wait, the patient's serum concentrations of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone are within the reference ranges. And a normal urinary 17-ketosteroid suggests it's not a metabolite of endogenous hormones, so it's not related to that.

So, given all this, the best fit is a fibromas (fibroma) or an endometrioid tumor (G). But wait, the presence of high testosterone and endometriosis often leads to endometriosis. If the test is 12 cm, maybe it's a cancer.

Alternatively, the term "serous cystadenoma" refers to the endometrium. So maybe that's option F. Oh, but that's more about the endometrium itself, not a separate mass.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Fibroma

B: Mucinous cystadenoma

C: Clear cell carcinoma

D: Teratoma

E: Brenner tumor

F: Serous cystadenoma

G: Endometrioid tumor

H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor

I: Ovarian carcinoid

J: Granulosa tumor

The patient's exam shows a 12 cm ovarian mass. So, 12 cm is quite large. Endometrioid tumors can be benign and have varying sizes. In some cases, especially with endometriosis, they may become cancerous. So perhaps the correct answer is G: Endometrioid tumor.

But wait, another point: the question says the last menstrual period was 4 months ago, so the woman is 40. That doesn't necessarily mean her endometriosis is advanced. It could be more advanced but not cancer. But the fact that her serum levels of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone are normal and the mass is 12 cm suggests it's a more advanced condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is a serous cystadenoma, which is the endometrium. But in this case, the mass is on the ovary, so it's an endometrioid tumor. Oh, but the options don't have "endometrioid tumor" as an option except G and J? Wait no, the options list G as "Endometrioid tumor" and J as "Granulosa tumor." So there's a difference between the endometrioid and the cyst.

Serous cystadenomas are usually in the pituitary. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the patient's mass is part of the endometrium, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Endometriosis is the movement of endocrine cells from the ovary to the lower genital area. This can lead to a mass in the ovary. If the mass is 12 cm, which is quite significant, and the presence of high testosterone, that might be indicative of a more advanced condition, perhaps a serous cystadenoma, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: in endometriosis, the mass is typically localized to the ovary, with some cystic (serous) components. If the mass is 12 cm, perhaps it's a serous cystadenoma, which is an endometrioid. But I think the term "serous cyst" refers to the cystic part of the endometrium. Alternatively, "endometrioid cyst" is a different term.

Wait, the options don't have "endometrioid cyst." So the options are F: Serous cystadenoma. I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, the correct term is "endometrioid tumor," which is G. 

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is a serous cyst, which is a cyst (like a cystic tumor) of the endometrium. So that's F.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about what's more common. Endometrioid tumors are typically localized to the ovary, with some cystic (serous) components. If the mass is 12 cm, perhaps it's a solid mass, which could be a fibroma or the endometrioid itself.

Wait, but the patient's last menstrual period was 4 months ago, so she's in her mid-30s. Her endometriosis could be more advanced but not necessarily cancer. But the fact that the serum levels are high and the last menstrual period is 4 months suggests she's in a more advanced stage. 

But what's the best answer here? Let's review the options again.

The options are:

A: Fibroma

B: Mucinous cystadenoma

C: Clear cell carcinoma

D: Teratoma

E: Brenner tumor

F: Serous cystadenoma

G: Endometrioid tumor

H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor

I: Ovarian carcinoid

J: Granulosa tumor

So, the options have F as "serous cystadenoma." Wait, but "serous cyst" is part of the endometrium, so the mass would be part of the endometrioid. So is F the correct term for the endometrioid itself? Or is the mass a separate cystadenoma?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible answers. Since the patient has a 12 cm mass, and the other signs point towards an endometriosis, the most probable answer is G: Endometrioid tumor.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I remember that endometrioid tumors are benign and not usually considered cancer, but in some cases, especially with high levels of endogenous hormones (like in endometriosis), they can become cancer. So a 12 cm mass with high testosterone might be an advanced form of the endometrioid.

Alternatively, the mass could be a serous cyst, but I think F is the term for the endometrioid itself. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is either F or G. I'm a bit torn, but I think the correct term is G: Endometrioid tumor.

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with 6 months of increased facial hair growth, a last menstrual period 4 months ago, and a 12-cm ovarian mass. Her physical examination reveals temporal and upper lip/b chin hair, which suggests endometriosis.serous cystadenomas are more commonly associated with the pituitary gland, not the ovary. The serum levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are normal, indicating endogenous endometriosis. The presence of a 12-cm mass is significant, and the high testosterone levels suggest potential for endometrioid tumor progression, though not cancer. Endometrioid tumors are benign and can be small, but in some cases, they may become malignant. Given the options, the best description of the mass is an endometrioid tumor.
