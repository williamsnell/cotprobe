Question:

A housing corporation owned a tract of land. The housing corporation prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the tract. The Declaration of Covenants created the homeowners' association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:"There shall never at any time be erected, permitted, or maintained upon any part of the property any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors. "The Declaration of Covenants was duly recorded and was included in the deed taken by a teacher when he purchased lot 62 in the development. The teacher immediately recorded his deed. The teacher leased his home to a librarian for a term of one year. The lease included the same restrictions as those in the Declaration of Covenants and in the teacher's deed. The librarian immediately began to sell liquor on the premises during weekly "after hours" parties. The homeowners' association sues the librarian in an action for damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the librarian?

Options:

A: The homeowners' association has no authority over the librarian.
B: The librarian is not in privity of contract with the homeowners' association.
C: The homeowners' association failed to notify the librarian of the restriction.
D: The librarian has the right to use the property as they see fit during the lease term.
E: The restriction is considered void due to the other commercial activities in the vicinity.
F: The Declaration of Covenants restriction is not legally binding.
G: Other lots in the immediate vicinity are used for commercial purposes.
H: The librarian was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants when signing the lease.
I: The rule in Spencer's Case prevents the librarian from being liable.
J: The librarian is not in privity of estate with the teacher.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about the homeowners' association and the librarian. Let me read through it again.

So, the scenario is that a housing corporation had a tract of land and divided it into 100 lots. They created an association to manage the covenants. One of the covenants prohibits the use of the property for saloon, malt, or spirituous liquor sales or manufacture. The teacher bought lot 62 and recorded his deed, which included this covenant. Later, he leased the house to a librarian for a year. The lease included the same restrictions. The librarian started selling liquor during parties, which the association is suing for damages.

The question is which argument the librarian can make to the homeowners' association. The options are A to H, with option E and J being about the validity of the covenant. 

I remember that covenants are generally considered to be enforceable only by the owner or their agent, not by others. So the homeowners' association, as an agent, can't enforce the covenant. So the homeowner's association might argue that they can't sue the librarian because they're not directly responsible for it.

But wait, the covenant was created by the homeowners' association in the Declaration of Covenants. Now the teacher recorded his deed, which included the covenant. Then the teacher leased the house (and the covenant) to the librarian. The librarian then used it for selling drinks. So the question is whether the covenant applies to the librarian's use.

In this case, the covenant was a restriction on the use of the property. The key here is whether the covenant is enforceable against anyone else. The covenants created by an association are usually not binding against others. The association's agent can enforce their covenants, but not others. So if the covenant is created by the association, the librarian, who's not the association's agent, can't enforce it.

So the argument would be that the homeowners' association can't enforce the covenant against the librarian because it's not their agent. So option A: "The homeowners' association has no authority over the librarian." That makes sense because the covenant was created by the association, not by the owner. Therefore, the association can't enforce it against others.

Alternatively, some might argue that the teacher's deed recorded the covenant but didn't enforce it. But the teacher's deed includes the covenant, which the teacher signed. The teacher then leased it to the librarian. Since the covenant was created by the association, and the teacher didn't act as agent, the association can't enforce it.

Another thought: the covenant was written in the deed. The teacher's deed included it, but the teacher didn't intend to act as agent. So the association's agent can enforce, but not others. So the librarian, who's not the agent, can't enforce it.

So the correct answer is A: The homeowners' association has no authority over the librarian.

The correct argument is that the homeowners' association (the agent) cannot enforce the covenant against the librarian because the covenant was created by the association, not by its agent. Therefore, the answer is:

A: The homeowners' association has no authority over the librarian.

Answer:
A
