Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that the position of an object is given by the equation x = 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25. I need to find the acceleration at t = 1.50 seconds. The options are A to J, with various numbers, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that acceleration is related to velocity, which is the first derivative of position, and velocity is the first derivative of position. So to find acceleration, I need to take the second derivative of the position function.

Wait, let's think about the process. Position x is given by a function of time t. So first, I need to find the velocity, which is dx/dt. Then, find the acceleration, which is dv/dt, or d²x/dt².

So the position equation is x(t) = 2.0t³ + 4.0t + 6.25. Let me find the velocity first. The derivative of x with respect to t is dx/dt. 

The derivative of 2.0t³ is 6t² because the power rule says 3*(2.0) t^(3-1) = 6t². Then, the derivative of 4.0t is 4.0, because the derivative of t is 1. The derivative of a constant, like 6.25, is zero. So putting that together, velocity v(t) should be 6t² + 4.

Now, to get acceleration, I need the derivative of velocity. So dv/dt is a. The derivative of 6t² is 12t (because 2*6t^(2-1) =12t). The derivative of 4 is zero. So acceleration a(t) is 12t.

Wait, that makes sense. So a(t) = 12t. Now I need to plug in t = 1.50 seconds to find the acceleration at that moment.

So let's calculate 12 multiplied by 1.50. 12 * 1.5 is 18. So a = 18 m/s².

Looking at the options, option E is 18 m/s². So the answer should be E.

To determine the acceleration of the object at \( t = 1.50 \, \text{s} \), we start with the position function \( x(t) = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25 \). 

1. **Find the velocity function**:  
   The first derivative of the position function with respect to time gives velocity:  
   \[
   v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 6t^2 + 4
   \]

2. **Find the acceleration function**:  
   The second derivative of the position function gives acceleration:  
   \[
   a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = 12t
   \]

3. **Calculate acceleration at \( t = 1.50 \, \text{s} \)**:  
   Substitute \( t = 1.50 \, \text{s} \) into the acceleration function:  
   \[
   a(1.50) = 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

The correct answer is **E: 18 m/s²**.
