Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about using Chebyshev's inequality to find a lower bound for the probability that X is between 23 and 43. The random variable X has a mean of 33 and a variance of 16. 

Wait, let me think about what Chebyshev's inequality says. I remember it's about how much probability a random variable can deviate from its mean. The formula is something like P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k², where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation. Oh right, σ squared is the variance, so that's how I get the standard deviation from variance.

So, in this problem, the mean μ is 33. The variance is 16, so the standard deviation σ is the square root of 16, which is 4. Got it.

The question asks for P(23 < X < 43). Hmm, that's the probability that X is between 23 and 43. Let me see. X is less than 43 and greater than 23. So, what's the range of X around the mean? The mean is 33. So, 33 minus 10 is 23, and 33 plus 10 is 43. Oh wait, so the interval is 23 to 43, which is symmetric around the mean. So, that's a range of 10 units on either side of the mean.

But Chebyshev's inequality is about the probability outside the mean plus or minus k standard deviations. So, in this case, since the range is 10, each side is 5 units. So, 5 is the distance from the mean to either end of the interval. So, 5 is the number we should relate to the standard deviation.

Wait, because σ is 4. So, 5 is 5/4 = 1.25 times the standard deviation. So, k is 1.25. Because 5 = k * σ, so k = 5/4 = 1.25.

So, according to Chebyshev's inequality, P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². So, substituting, that's 1/(1.25)². Let me compute that. 1.25 squared is (5/4)^2 which is 25/16. So, 1 divided by (25/16) is 16/25, which is 0.64. So, P(|X - μ| ≥ 1.25σ) ≤ 0.64.

Wait, but we're interested in P(23 < X < 43), which is the complement of the probability that X is outside that interval. So, P(23 < X < 43) = 1 - P(|X - μ| ≥ 5). Wait, wait a second, because X is 5 standard deviations away from the mean in either direction. So, wait, 5 is 5 units from 33. Since σ is 4, 5 is 1.25σ. So, P(|X - μ| ≥ 1.25σ) is 0.64 as we calculated. Therefore, P(23 < X < 43) = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36. Wait, that can't be right, because 0.36 isn't in any of the options. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The question says P(23 < X <43) is the same as X being within 10 units of the mean, right? Because X <43 is 33 +10, and X>23 is 33-10. So, that's a total range of 10 on either side. But in Chebyshev's inequality, the standard deviation is 4, so 5 is 1.25σ. So, the probability of being outside the range is 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, which aligns with what I did earlier.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 0.36. So, I must have made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh, wait, maybe the problem is that I misapplied Chebyshev's inequality. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong thing. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, the problem asks for P(23 < X <43). That's the probability that X is within 10 units of the mean. Each side is 5 units from the mean. Since the standard deviation is 4, 5 is 1.25σ. So, using Chebyshev's inequality, the probability that X is outside this range is 1 - P(23 < X <43). So, according to Chebyshev's, P(|X - μ| ≥ 1.25σ) ≤ 1/(1.25)^2 = 0.64. So, that implies that P(23 < X <43) ≥ 1 - 0.64 = 0.36. But 0.36 isn't an option. Wait, but the options are all much higher.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find a lower bound using Chebyshev's inequality, which can provide a minimum probability. So, using Chebyshev's, the maximum probability outside the interval is 1/k², so the minimum probability inside is 1 - 1/k². 

Wait, but in this case, with k=1.25, 1/k² is 0.64, so the minimum probability inside is 1 - 0.64 = 0.36. But the options don't have 0.36. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a different approach. Like, using Chebyshev's to find the probability within kσ of the mean. Wait, but in this case, the range is 10, which is 2.5σ (since σ is 4, 4*2.5=10). So, maybe that's a way to approach it. 

Wait, let me think. So, 10 units is 2.5 times the standard deviation. So, k would be 2.5. Then, according to Chebyshev's, the probability outside the range is ≤ 1/(2.5)^2 = 0.16. Therefore, the probability inside is ≥ 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. Oh! That's one of the options, option I is 0.84. So, the lower bound for P(23 <X <43) is 0.84.

Wait, but this is a higher lower bound than before. So why is this the case? Because when the interval is wider (more than 1σ), the lower bound is higher. Because the range is larger, so the probability of being inside is higher.

So, in this case, by taking the wider range (10 units, which is 2.5σ), Chebyshev's inequality gives a lower bound of 0.84 for P(23 < X <43).

So, the correct answer is option I: 0.84.

To solve the problem using Chebyshev's inequality, we start by noting that the mean μ is 33 and the variance is 16, so the standard deviation σ is 4. The interval 23–43 corresponds to 10 units below and above the mean, which is 2.5σ (since σ=4, 10=2.5×4). 

Chebyshev's inequality states that the probability of X being more than kσ away from the mean is ≤ 1/k². Here, k=2.5, so 1/k² = 0.16. This means the probability that X is outside the interval 23–43 is ≤ 0.16. Therefore, the probability inside the interval is ≥ 1 - 0.16 = 0.84.

The correct answer is **I: 0.84**.
