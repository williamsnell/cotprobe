Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car engine. Hmm. Let me read it again. The engine is working at 33 horsepower and moving the car at 45 miles per hour. I need to find the force the engine is exerting. The options are A through J, and each is a different weight in pounds. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, but I remember that power is related to force and velocity. Oh right, power (P) equals force (F) multiplied by velocity (v), or P = F * v. But wait, the units matter here. The power is given in horsepower, and the velocity in miles per hour. Oh right, I need to convert these to consistent units so I can calculate force.

I think horsepower can be converted to watts, and miles per hour to meters per second. Or maybe there's a direct way to convert horsepower and speed into force. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula P = (F in pounds) * (v in feet per second) / 32. But wait, I'm mixing units. Let me think more clearly.

First, let's get the units right. Horsepower is a unit of power, which is energy per time. One horsepower is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. So 33 horsepower would be 33 * 550 ft-lbs/s.

The velocity is 45 miles per hour. I need to convert that to feet per second. So, 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 45 mph is 45 * 5280 ft / 3600 s. Let's calculate that: 45 * 5280 = 237600, divided by 3600 is 66 ft/s. So velocity is 66 ft/s.

Now, power P is force F times velocity v. So 33 * 550 = P (in ft-lbs/s), which is equal to F * v (in lbm * ft/s). Wait, but wait. Wait, the units: power in ft-lbs per second is force in pounds times velocity in feet per second. But F is in pounds, which is a force unit. So 33 HP is 33 * 550 = 18150 ft-lbs/s.

So, 18150 = F * 66. Solving for F: F = 18150 / 66. Let me compute that. 66 * 275 is 18150 because 66 * 200 is 13200, 66*75=4950, 13200+4950=18150. So F is 275 lb. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 275. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:500, B:300, C:250, D:320, E:150, F:180, G:215, H:400, I:350, J:275. Oh, option J is 275. So according to this, the answer should be J:275 lbs.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the unit conversion? Let me double-check. 

Horsepower to watts: 1 HP = 745.7 W. So 33 HP is 33 * 745.7 ≈ 24578.1 W. But I'm not sure if I need to go that route. Alternatively, maybe I can use the same power formula but convert the units properly.

Alternatively, another approach: 1 horsepower is 550 ft-lb per second. So 33 hp is 33 * 550 = 18150 ft-lb/s. The velocity is 45 mph. Let me convert that to ft/s. 45 * 5280 / 3600 = 45 * (5280/3600) = 45 * 1.4667 ≈ 66 ft/s. So 66 ft/s.

Power is F * v, so F = P / v = 18150 / 66. Let me compute that again. 66 × 275 = 18150. So F is 275 pounds. So option J is 275, which matches. So the answer should be J.

To determine the force exerted by the engine, we use the relationship between power, force, and velocity, given by the formula:

\[
P = F \cdot v
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the power in foot-pounds per second (ft-lbs/s),
- \( F \) is the force in pounds,
- \( v \) is the velocity in feet per second (ft/s).

### Step 1: Convert horsepower to foot-pounds per second
1 horsepower (hp) is equivalent to 550 foot-pounds per second (ft-lbs/s). Therefore, 33 horsepower is:

\[
33 \, \text{hp} \times 550 \, \text{ft-lb/s per hp} = 18150 \, \text{ft-lb/s}
\]

### Step 2: Convert velocity from miles per hour to feet per second
The car's velocity is 45 miles per hour (mph). To convert this to feet per second (ft/s):

\[
45 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{1 \, \text{mile}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{hour}}{3600 \, \text{seconds}} = 45 \times \frac{5280}{3600} = 66 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for force using the power formula
Rearranging the power formula to solve for force:

\[
F = \frac{P}{v} = \frac{18150 \, \text{ft-lb/s}}{66 \, \text{ft/s}} = 275 \, \text{lb}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated force is 275 pounds, which corresponds to option J.
