Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability question. Let me read it again. The problem says that P(A ∪ B) is 0.76 and P(A ∪ B') is 0.87. I need to find P(A). Hmm, I remember some probability formulas, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think.

Wait, I think there's a formula that relates the probabilities of unions and intersections. Oh right! The inclusion-exclusion principle. For two events, A and B, the probability of their union is P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). But here, we have P(A ∪ B) and P(A ∪ B'), so maybe I can set up some equations.

Let me denote P(A) as x and P(B) as y. Also, since B' is the complement of B, P(B') = 1 - y.

From the first given, P(A ∪ B) = 0.76. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, that's x + y - P(A ∩ B) = 0.76.

Now the second given is P(A ∪ B') = 0.87. Applying the same principle here: since B' is the complement, the union is A ∪ (everything except B). So that's P(A) + P(B') - P(A ∩ B'). So x + (1 - y) - P(A ∩ B') = 0.87.

Wait, but I don't know P(A ∩ B) or P(A ∩ B'). Maybe I can find a relationship between them.

Wait, another approach: since B and B' are complements, their probabilities add up to 1. Also, A ∪ B is all the cases except when neither A nor B happens. Similarly, A ∪ B' includes all cases except when B doesn't happen but A does. Hmm, maybe I can subtract these probabilities to find something.

Wait, let's consider the events A ∪ B and A ∪ B'. The difference between these two unions is the event B ∩ B', which is impossible, so their probabilities should add up to 1. Wait, is that right? Because A ∪ B is the entire probability space minus A ∩ B', and A ∪ B' is the entire space minus B ∩ A'. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that P(A ∪ B) + P(A ∪ B') = 1. Because together, these two unions cover all possibilities except maybe the intersection. Wait, no, not exactly. Wait, A ∪ B is everything except A' ∩ B', and A ∪ B' is everything except B ∩ A'. But wait, that's not correct because A ∪ B is the entire space minus (A' ∩ B'), and A ∪ B' is the entire space minus (B ∩ A'). So adding these two would give 1 minus [ (A' ∩ B') + (B ∩ A') ].

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express the given probabilities in terms of x and y and then solve.

So, from the first equation: x + y - P(A ∩ B) = 0.76.

From the second equation: x + (1 - y) - P(A ∩ B') = 0.87.

Wait, but I'm not sure about P(A ∩ B') yet. Maybe I can find another equation that relates these.

Wait, perhaps I should eliminate the intersection terms. Let me write both equations again.

Equation 1: x + y - P(A ∩ B) = 0.76.

Equation 2: x + (1 - y) - P(A ∩ B') = 0.87.

I need to find expressions for P(A ∩ B) and P(A ∩ B'). Hmm, but without knowing either, maybe I can find another relation.

Wait, I remember that P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B') = P(A). Because the intersection with B and the intersection with B' are mutually exclusive and their union is A. So that's a key point! So P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B').

So let's let P(A ∩ B) = a and P(A ∩ B') = b. Then, x = a + b.

From equation 1: a + y = 0.76 + P(A ∩ B) = 0.76 + a. Wait, that doesn't help. Wait, equation 1 is x + y - a = 0.76. But x is a + b, so substituting: (a + b) + y - a = 0.76.

The a's cancel: b + y = 0.76. So equation 1 becomes y + b = 0.76.

Equation 2: x + (1 - y) - b = 0.87. Substituting x = a + b, but since a = x - b, maybe it's better to substitute x = a + b. Wait, equation 2 is (a + b) + (1 - y) - b = 0.87.

Simplify: a + b + 1 - y - b = 0.87. The b's cancel: a + 1 - y = 0.87.

So equation 2 becomes a - y = -0.13. So a = y - 0.13.

Wait, we have from equation 1 that y + b = 0.76, so b = 0.76 - y.

But from equation 2, a = y - 0.13.

Now, since a + b = x, let's substitute a and b:

(y - 0.13) + (0.76 - y) = x.

Simplify: y - 0.13 + 0.76 - y = x.

The y's cancel: (0.76 - 0.13) = x. So x = 0.63.

Wait, so P(A) is 0.63. Let me check the options. Option H is 0.63. So that should be the answer.

To find \( P(A) \), we use the given probabilities and properties of probability:

1. Let \( P(A) = x \), \( P(B) = y \), and \( P(A \cap B) = a \), \( P(A \cap B') = b \). We know:
   - \( x = a + b \) (since \( A \) can occur with \( B \) or without \( B \)).
   - \( P(A \cup B) = x + y - a = 0.76 \).
   - \( P(A \cup B') = x + (1 - y) - b = 0.87 \).

2. From the first equation:
   - \( x + y - a = 0.76 \).
   - Substituting \( x = a + b \): \( (a + b) + y - a = 0.76 \) ⇒ \( b + y = 0.76 \).

3. From the second equation:
   - \( x + (1 - y) - b = 0.87 \).
   - Substituting \( x = a + b \): \( (a + b) + (1 - y) - b = 0.87 \) ⇒ \( a + 1 - y = 0.87 \) ⇒ \( a = y - 0.13 \).

4. Substitute \( a = y - 0.13 \) into \( b + y = 0.76 \):
   - \( b = 0.76 - y \).

5. Since \( x = a + b = (y - 0.13) + (0.76 - y) = 0.63 \), we find \( P(A) = 0.63 \).

Answer: H: 0.63
