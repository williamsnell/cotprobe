Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about a string under tension and how its frequency changes when the tension is altered. 

The problem says that a string has a tension of 256 Newtons and a frequency of 100 vibrations per second. Now, they want to know what its frequency will be when the tension is changed to 144 Newtons. The options are A through J, but I'll figure that out as I go.

I remember that the frequency of a string depends on its tension, length, mass, and linear density. The formula, if I recall correctly, is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where f is frequency, T is tension, μ is linear density (mass per unit length), and L is the length of the string. But wait, since the problem doesn't give me L or μ, maybe there's a way to relate the two situations without those variables.

Alternatively, I think there's a direct proportionality between the square root of the tension and the frequency, assuming the length and mass per unit length are constant. Because if all else is the same, then f is proportional to sqrt(T).

So, if I take the square of the original frequency and compare it to the new frequency squared, maybe that's the way to go. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the original frequency as f1 and the new as f2. The original tension is T1 =256 N, and the new tension is T2 =144 N.

So, f1 = 100 vibrations per second. We're looking for f2 when T is 144.

Since f is proportional to sqrt(T), the ratio of f2 to f1 should be the square root of (T2 / T1).

So,

f2 = f1 * sqrt(T2 / T1)

Plugging in the values:

f2 = 100 * sqrt(144 / 256)

Let me compute that. 144 divided by 256. Hmm, let's see, 144 is 12 squared, 256 is 16 squared. So sqrt(144/256) is sqrt( (12/16)^2 ) which is 12/16, which simplifies to 3/4. So sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(0.75). Wait, alternatively, 144/256 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 16: 144 ÷16=9, 256 ÷16=16. So 9/16. The square root of 9/16 is 3/4, which is 0.75.

So, f2 = 100 * 0.75 = 75 Hz. Wait, but let me double-check that because I'm a bit shaky on the exact calculation.

Wait, another approach: 256 is 2^8 (since 2^8=256). 144 is 12^2 or (3*4)^2 = 3^2 *4^2 = 9 * 16. So, 144 is 9*16, 256 is 16*16. So sqrt(144/256) = sqrt( (9*16)/(16*16) ) = sqrt(9/16) = 3/4, which is 0.75, same as before. So 100 * 0.75 = 75 Hz. 

Looking at the options, option I is 75 vps. So the answer should be I.

To determine the new frequency of the string when the tension is changed from 256 N to 144 N, we use the relationship between frequency, tension, and the properties of the string. The frequency \( f \) of a string is proportional to the square root of the tension \( T \), assuming the length and mass per unit length (\( \mu \)) remain constant. The formula is:

\[
f \propto \sqrt{T}
\]

Since the problem does not provide the length or mass per unit length, we use the proportionality:

\[
\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( f_1 = 100 \, \text{vps} \)
- \( T_1 = 256 \, \text{N} \)
- \( T_2 = 144 \, \text{N} \)

\[
\frac{f_2}{100} = \sqrt{\frac{144}{256}}
\]

Simplify the fraction inside the square root:
\[
\frac{144}{256} = \frac{9}{16}
\]

\[
\sqrt{\frac{9}{16}} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
\]

Thus:

\[
f_2 = 100 \times 0.75 = 75 \, \text{vps}
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **75 vibrations per second**, which corresponds to option **I**.
