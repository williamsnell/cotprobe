Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the ones digit of the product of numbers from 1 to 9. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the product is 1 multiplied by 2, then by 3, all the way up to 9. So it's 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9. Hmm, calculating the entire product might be tedious, but maybe I don't need to compute it all. Because the question is only about the ones digit, I can probably find a pattern or a shortcut.

I remember that when you multiply numbers, the ones digit of the product depends only on the ones digits of the numbers being multiplied. So, for example, if I have 12 * 13, the ones digit is 2*3=6, so the ones digit of the product is 6. So maybe I can just track the ones digit as I multiply each number step by step.

Let me start with 1. The ones digit is 1. Then multiply by 2: 1*2=2. So the ones digit is 2.

Next, multiply by 3: 2*3=6. Ones digit is 6.

Multiply by 4: 6*4=24. Ones digit is 4.

Multiply by 5: 4*5=20. Ones digit is 0.

Wait, now it's zero. Once there's a zero in the ones digit, multiplying by any number will keep the ones digit as zero. Because 0 times anything is 0. So if at any point the product has a 0 in the ones place, the whole product will end with a 0.

So, let me check where the zero comes in. The product so far is 1*2*3*4*5=120. So after multiplying by 5, the ones digit is 0. Then, multiplying by 6, 7, 8, 9 won't change the fact that the ones digit is 0. So, once it hits 0, it stays 0.

So, according to this, the ones digit of the entire product is 0. So looking at the options, that would be option C: 0.

Wait, wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again.

1. Start with 1: ones digit is 1.
2. Multiply by 2: 1*2=2 → ones digit 2.
3. Multiply by 3: 2*3=6 → ones digit 6.
4. Multiply by 4: 6*4=24 → ones digit 4.
5. Multiply by 5: 4*5=20 → ones digit 0.
6. Multiply by 6: 0*6=0 → ones digit 0.
7. Multiply by 7: 0*7=0 → ones digit 0.
8. Multiply by 8: 0*8=0 → ones digit 0.
9. Multiply by 9: 0*9=0 → ones digit 0.

Yep, that's right. So after multiplying by 5, the ones digit becomes zero, and it stays zero for the rest. So the final ones digit is 0. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

The product of numbers from 1 to 9 is 1×2×3×4×5×6×7×8×9. The ones digit of this product is 0 because once a zero is introduced (at the 5th multiplication), all subsequent multiplications will not change the fact that the ones digit remains 0.

Answer: C
