Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether a man can be convicted of robbery based on certain circumstances. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is a man at a party who finds a female guest who passed out and is unconscious in a bedroom. He locks the door, takes her purse, empties the money into his pockets, and removes her jewelry. He's then apprehended and charged with robbery. The question is whether he can be convicted.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that robbery involves taking someone's property with the intent to deprive them of their life. There are different types of robbery, like robbery by force, where the person takes the property with force, or just taking it without the intent to hurt.

Wait, the key here is whether the man took the property with the intent to deprive the person of life. He took her money and jewelry, which is against the law. But wait, he didn't do it with force. He just took the money and jewelry without any intent to harm. But is that enough?

I think the main issue is whether the person was in a position to be taken with the intent. In this case, the man was at a party, which is a social place, but he's taking property from a female who's unconscious. The question is whether the law requires the victim to be in a position of trust or face fear.

The law generally requires that the person being taken is in a position of trust or under the fear of being hurt, especially if they're in a vulnerable state like unconsciousness. So, even if he's just taking the money and jewelry without the intent to hurt, the victim can't be hurt without going into a position of fear or trust.

Looking at the options:

Option B says robbery doesn't require the victim to be in a position of fear or force. That makes sense because the law typically requires the victim to be in a position of trust or fear of imminent harm.

Option A says it's considered robbery because the victim was unconscious. But the issue is the position of the victim. If the victim is in a position where they can't be held responsible, even if they're unconscious, it's not a crime.

Option C says the victim wasn't aware. But again, the awareness is part of the positionâ€”so if the victim wasn't aware, they might not be in a position to resist.

Option D says it's a matter of intimidation or force. Wait, the law specifically requires the victim's position, not just that they were targeted by force. So D might not be correct.

Option E says it wasn't because there was no force. But the position is the issue, not the method.

Option F says it wasn't because he was a guest. But he was at a party, which is a social place, but the position of the victim is more important than the setting.

Option G says it can occur in a private home. But the position of the victim still matters. If the person is in a position of trust, even if it's a private home, it's still a crime.

Option H says the place wasn't business or street. But the same applies to the position of the victim.

Option I says he didn't use a weapon. But the weapon issue is irrelevant here. The key is the intent and the victim's position.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be B, because robbery doesn't require the person to be in a position of fear or under the influence of fear. The man took the money without intent to harm, but the victim's position is crucial, so he's not guilty.

The correct answer is B. robbery does not require the victim to be in a position of fear or under the influence of fear. The man took property without intent to deprive the woman of life, but the woman was in a position of trust or fear of being hurt, which is a requirement for robbery. 

Answer: B
