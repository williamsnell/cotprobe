Okay, so I've got this probability problem about Poisson processes. Hmm, Poisson processes are those where events happen at a constant average rate and independently of the time since the last event. The problem is about two independent Poisson processes, N1(t) and N2(t), with rates λ1=1 and λ2=2 respectively. Then there's a merged process N(t) = N1(t) + N2(t), and we're given that N(1) =2. We need to find the probability that N1(1) =1.

Wait, let me think. So N(t) is the sum of two independent Poisson processes. Since N1 and N2 are independent, their combined process N(t) should also be a Poisson process with rate λ = λ1 + λ2 = 3.

But wait, no, because N(t) is the sum of two Poisson processes, so N(t) is a Poisson process with rate λ = λ1 + λ2. So N(t) has rate 3, and N(1) is the number of events in time 1. So N(1) is Poisson distributed with λ=3.

But now, given that N(1)=2, we need to find the probability that N1(1)=1. So this seems like a conditional probability problem.

I remember that in Poisson processes, the number of events in disjoint intervals are independent. So N1 and N2 are independent processes.

So given that N(1)=2, which is the sum of N1(1) and N2(1). So N1(1) and N2(1) are independent Poisson variables with parameters 1 and 2 respectively.

Wait, no. Because N1 and N2 are independent Poisson processes, then the counts N1(1) and N2(1) are independent Poisson variables with parameters λ1*t and λ2*t, so N1(1) ~ Poisson(1) and N2(1) ~ Poisson(2). But their sum is N(1)=N1(1)+N2(1)~Poisson(3), so 3.

So given that N(1)=2, the joint distribution of N1(1) and N2(1) is multinomial, or more precisely, the joint probability can be expressed as the product of the individual probabilities since they're independent.

So the conditional probability P(N1(1)=1 | N(1)=2) is equal to P(N1=1, N2=1) divided by P(N=2).

Wait, no, since N1 and N2 are independent, the joint probability is the product of P(N1=1) and P(N2=1). And P(N=2) is the probability that N1 + N2 =2.

So let me compute this.

First, P(N1=1) is e^{-1} * (1^1)/1! = e^{-1}.

P(N2=1) is e^{-2} * (2^1)/1! = 2 e^{-2}.

So the joint probability P(N1=1, N2=1) is e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} = 2 e^{-3}.

Now, P(N=2) is the probability that the sum is 2, which is the sum over all k where N1=0 and N2=2, plus N1=1 and N2=1, plus N1=2 and N2=0.

So P(N=2) = P(N1=0)P(N2=2) + P(N1=1)P(N2=1) + P(N1=2)P(N2=0).

Calculating each term:

P(N1=0) = e^{-1}
P(N2=2) = (2^2 e^{-2}) / 2! ) = (4 e^{-2})/2 = 2 e^{-2}

So term1 = e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} = 2 e^{-3}

Term2 is P(N1=1) * P(N2=1) = e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} = 2 e^{-3}

Term3: P(N1=2)= e^{-1} (2^2/2!)= e^{-1} * 4/2= 2 e^{-1}

P(N2=0)= e^{-2} * 1.

So term3= 2 e^{-1} * e^{-2} = 2 e^{-3}

So adding up all terms: 2 e^{-3} + 2 e^{-3} + 2 e^{-3} = 6 e^{-3}

So P(N=2) =6 e^{-3}.

So the conditional probability is (2 e^{-3}) / (6 e^{-3}) )= 2/6= 1/3 ≈0.3333.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the sum is e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} + e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} + e^{-1} * e^{-2}?

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, term2 was P(N1=1) * P(N2=1) = e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} =2 e^{-3}

Term3: P(N1=2) = e^{-1} (2^2 / 2! )= e^{-1} * (4/2)= 2 e^{-1}

P(N2=0)= e^{-2}

So term3= 2 e^{-1} * e^{-2}=2 e^{-3}.

Term1: P(N1=0)=e^{-1}, P(N2=2)= (2^2 e^{-2})/2! = (4 e^{-2})/2= 2 e^{-2}.

So term1= e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2}= 2 e^{-3}

So all three terms sum to 6 e^{-3}.

Then, the numerator is term2=2 e^{-3}, and denominator is 6 e^{-3}. So 2/6=1/3≈0.3333.

So the probability is 1/3, which is approximately 0.3333.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.3333. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves two independent Poisson processes, N₁(t) and N₂(t), with rates λ₁=1 and λ₂=2, respectively. The merged process N(t) = N₁(t) + N₂(t) is also a Poisson process with rate λ=3. Given that N(1)=2, we need to find the probability that N₁(1)=1.

Since N₁ and N₂ are independent, their counts are independent Poisson variables: N₁(1) ~ Poisson(1) and N₂(1) ~ Poisson(2). The joint probability P(N₁=1, N₂=1) is the product of the individual probabilities. The conditional probability is then calculated as:

P(N₁=1 | N=2) = P(N₁=1, N₂=1) / P(N=2).

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(N₁=1) = e^{-1}
- P(N₂=1) = 2 e^{-2}
- P(N₁=1, N₂=1) = e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} = 2 e^{-3}

P(N=2) is the sum of P(N₁=k, N₂=2−k) for k=0,1,2:
- P(N₁=0, N₂=2) = e^{-1} * 2 e^{-2} = 2 e^{-3}
- P(N₁=1, N₂=1) = 2 e^{-3}
- P(N₁=2, N₂=0) = 2 e^{-1} * e^{-2} = 2 e^{-3}

Summing these: P(N=2) = 6 e^{-3}.

Thus, the conditional probability is (2 e^{-3}) / (6 e^{-3}) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.
