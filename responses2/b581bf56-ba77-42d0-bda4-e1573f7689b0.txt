Okay, so I have this biology question here about alleles and masks. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the terminology, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see.

The question is asking what an allele that is masked is referred to as. The options are A to J, each with different terms. I remember that in genetics, alleles are versions of genes, and when they're masked, it means they don't show their effect on the trait.

Wait, what's a masked allele exactly? Oh right, masking refers to when one allele doesn't show its effect because it's masked by another. Like, if you have a trait that's expressed by one allele, but another allele that's recessive masks it. For example, in some cases, the dominant allele is needed for the trait to manifest, but if the recessive is present, the dominant doesn't show. So the dominant allele is masking the effect of the recessive.

So, the term for an allele that's masked would be recessive. Or wait, noâ€”wait, recessive is when the allele doesn't show its effect because it's masked by another. So if an allele is recessive, it's masked by a dominant allele. But in the question, the allele that's masked is the one that's masking the effect, meaning it's the recessive one. So the term is recessive.

Wait, let me think again. For example, the Bb genotype has a dominant allele (B) and a recessive (b). The dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive because the dominant allele is present, so the trait is expressed. So in this case, the recessive allele is masked. So the term for the masking is the recessive allele.

Looking at the options, option H is recessive. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but another perspective: sometimes "recessive" refers to the genotype showing a recessive trait. But in this context, the question is about the allele being masked, not the phenotype. So the allele is the recessive one, which is masking.

I don't think any of the other options make sense. For example, reductive (D) is about the reduction in the number of chromosomes, which is a different concept. Resistant (C) is when an organism is resistant to something, but that's about invasiveness, not masking. Reflective (F) is about mirrors, probably not related. Redundant (G) is when there's an extra copy that's not harmful. Repressive is about keeping something in check, which might relate to epigenetics, but I don't think that's the term used here. Reflective isn't a term I know for alleles.

So the correct term is recessive, option H.

The allele that is masked is referred to as recessive. This term describes an allele that is not expressed because it is inactivated or masked by the presence of another allele. For example, in a genotype like Bb, the recessive allele (b) is masked by the dominant allele (B), resulting in the expression of the dominant trait. 

**Answer:** H: recessive.
