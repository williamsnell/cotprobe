Question:

Bowl $B_1$ contains two white chips, bowl $B_2$ contains two red chips, bowl $B_3$ contains two white and two red chips, and bowl $B_4$ contains three white chips and one red chip. The probabilities of selecting bowl $B_1, B_2, B_3$, or $B_4$ are $1 / 2,1 / 4,1 / 8$, and $1 / 8$, respectively. A bowl is selected using these probabilities and a chip is then drawn at random. Find $P(W)$, the probability of drawing a white chip.

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Alright, there are four bowls: B1, B2, B3, and B4. Each bowl has different compositions of white and red chips. The probabilities of selecting each bowl are given as 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/8 respectively. Then, a bowl is selected, a chip is drawn, and we need to find the probability that the chip is white, P(W). The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, so I need to calculate the total probability of drawing a white chip, considering each bowl has its own probability of contributing to that outcome.

Let me jot down the details:

B1 has two white chips. So, probability of taking B1 is 1/2. Since both are white, the chance of white from B1 is 2/2 = 1. So, the probability of white when selecting B1 is (1/2)*1 = 1/2.

B2 has two red chips. So, the chance of drawing a white chip from B2 is 0. So, the contribution from B2 is (1/4)*0 = 0.

B3 has two white and two red chips. So, the probability of white is 2/4 = 1/2. The chance of selecting B3 is 1/8. So, contribution is (1/8)*(1/2) = 1/16.

B4 has three white and one red chip. So, the probability of white is 3/4. The chance of selecting B4 is 1/8. So, contribution is (1/8)*(3/4) = 3/32.

Now, I need to sum all these contributions to get P(W).

Let me add them up:

From B1: 1/2

From B2: 0

From B3: 1/16

From B4: 3/32

So, 1/2 + 0 + 1/16 + 3/32.

Let me convert all to 32 denominators for easier addition.

1/2 is 16/32.

1/16 is 2/32.

3/32 is 3/32.

Adding them: 16/32 + 0 + 2/32 + 3/32 = (16 + 2 + 3)/32 = 21/32.

Wait, 16+2 is 18, plus 3 is 21. So 21/32.

Looking at the options, option D is 15/32, and option E is 27/32, option B is 13/32, etc. Wait, none of them is 21/32. Hmm, did I do that right?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding. Let me check again.

Wait, from B1: 1/2 is 16/32, correct.

B3 is 1/16, which is 2/32. So 16 + 2 is 18.

B4 is 3/32.

18 +3=21. So 21/32. So, the correct answer should be 21/32, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options again: A:19/32, B:13/32, C:29/32, D:15/32, E:27/32, F:25/32, G:23/32, H:17/32, I:31/32, J:21/32.

Oh, so D is 15/32. Wait, but according to my calculation, it's 21/32. Did I miscalculate somewhere?

Wait, let me re-examine each bowl's contribution.

B1: 2 white, so 2/2 = 1. So, (1/2)*1 = 1/2.

B2: 0, so 0.

B3: 2 white out of 4, so 1/2. Multiply by 1/8: (1/8)*(1/2) = 1/16.

B4: 3 white out of 4, so 3/4. Multiply by 1/8: (1/8)*(3/4) = 3/32.

So, adding 1/2, 0, 1/16, 3/32.

Let me convert all to 32 denominator:

1/2 = 16/32.

1/16 = 2/32.

3/32 = 3/32.

Sum: 16 + 0 + 2 +3 =21. So 21/32. So yes, D is 15/32, E is 27/32. Wait, no, 21/32 isn't an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in B3. Let me double-check B3.

B3 has two white and two red, so 2/4=1/2. So, 1/2 chance of white. Multiply by 1/8: (1/8)(1/2)=1/16.

B4: 3/4. Multiply by 1/8: (3/4)(1/8)=3/32.

So, yes, adding 16/32 (from B1) + 2/32 (B3) + 3/32 (B4) = 21/32.

Looking back at the options, D is 15/32, E is 27/32. So, none is 21/32. Did I add correctly?

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check each bowl again.

Wait, bowl B1: two white, so 2/2=1. So, (1/2)*1=1/2.

B2: two red. So, no white, so 0.

B3: two white and two red, so 2/4=1/2. (1/8)(1/2)=1/16.

B4: three white and one red. So, 3/4. (1/8)(3/4)=3/32.

Yes, that's correct. So 1/2 is 16/32, plus 1/16 is 2/32, which is 2/32, plus 3/32. So 16+2+3=21, so 21/32. So the correct answer should be 21/32. But looking at the options, that's option D. However, option D says 15/32. Did I make a mistake? Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bowl B4's calculation. Let me double-check.

B4 has three white and one red, so 3 out of 4 chips are white. So, 3/4 chance of white. Multiply by 1/8: (1/8)(3/4)=3/32. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the fractions. Let me calculate each term as fractions:

1/2 is 16/32.

1/16 is 2/32.

3/32 is 3/32.

Adding 16+2+3=21. So 21/32.

So the correct answer is 21/32, which is option D.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A:19/32

B:13/32

C:29/32

D:15/32

E:27/32

F:25/32

G:23/32

H:17/32

I:31/32

J:21/32.

So, yes, option J is 21/32. But the problem says the last character of your response must be the letter you've chosen. So, in the problem statement, the options are given as A to J, each with their own fractions, and you choose the correct one, which would be J.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the addition again.

1/2 is 16/32.

1/16 is 2/32.

3/32 is 3/32.

Adding: 16 +2 +3 = 21. So 21/32. So that's D, no. Wait, no, option D says 15/32. So perhaps I made a mistake in the bowl B3 calculation.

Wait, B3 has two white and two red, so 2/4=1/2. So 1/2 chance of white, multiply by 1/8: 1/16.

Wait, 1/8 * 1/2 is 1/16, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused B4's probability. Let me recheck.

B4: three white and one red, so 3/4 chance. Multiply by 1/8 (since the probability of selecting B4 is 1/8): 3/4 *1/8 = 3/(4*8) =3/32. Correct.

Hmm, none of the options is 21/32. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, I think I may have misread the problem. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says that the probabilities of selecting each bowl are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/8 respectively. So, the selection is B1:1/2, B2:1/4, B3:1/8, B4:1/8. So, when I calculate the contributions:

B1: 1/2 *1=1/2

B2:1/4 *0=0

B3:1/8*(2/4)=1/8*1/2=1/16

B4:1/8*(3/4)=3/32

So, adding them: 1/2 is 16/32, 1/16 is 2/32, 3/32 is 3/32. So 16+2+3=21, so 21/32. So the correct answer is 21/32, which is option D. But wait, the options given in the problem don't have that. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the options are:

A:19/32

B:13/32

C:29/32

D:15/32

E:27/32

F:25/32

G:23/32

H:17/32

I:31/32

J:21/32

So, yes, option J is 21/32. So that must be the correct answer. So the correct answer is option J.

The probability of drawing a white chip, P(W), is calculated by summing the contributions from each bowl:

- B1 (1/2): 1/2
- B2 (1/4): 0
- B3 (1/8): (1/8) * (1/2) = 1/16
- B4 (1/8): (1/8) * (3/4) = 3/32

Converting to a common denominator (32):

- 1/2 = 16/32
- 1/16 = 2/32
- 3/32 = 3/32

Adding: 16 + 2 + 3 = 21 â‡’ 21/32.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 21/32**.
