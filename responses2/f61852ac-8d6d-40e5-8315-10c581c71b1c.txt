C: Equilibrium price is 10 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 70 per day
D: Equilibrium price is 8 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 64 per day
E: Equilibrium price is 25 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 50 per day
F: Equilibrium price is 40 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 10 per day
G: Equilibrium price is 30 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 50 per day
H: Equilibrium price is 15 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 45 per day
I: Equilibrium price is 5 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 30 per day
J: Equilibrium price is 20 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 40 per day

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about finding the equilibrium price and quantity in the oil market between the MoloRepublic and their distributors. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that the distributors are willing to buy 60 barrels per day when p is the price in dollars per barrel. Wait, wait, no, the question says "The distributors... are willing to buy 60-p barrels per day." Hmmm, that doesn't sound right. Because if p is the price, then 60-p would decrease as p increases. But wait, usually, quantity demanded decreases as price increases. But here, the quantity is 60 minus p. So if p is 0, they buy 60 barrels, but as p increases, they buy less. So the demand function is Qd = 60 - p. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check the problem statement.

Wait, the question says: "The distributors of oil from the MoloRepublic are willing to buy 60-p barrels per day, when p = dollars per barrel." So that's Qd = 60 - p. But wait, that would imply that at p=0, Qd is 60, and at p=60, Qd would be zero. That makes sense for demand.

On the other hand, the Republic's officials are willing to supply (p² / 10) barrels per day. So the supply function is Qs = (p²)/10. So when p is zero, supply is zero, and it increases quadratically with p.

Equilibrium occurs where Qd equals Qs. So set 60 - p equal to p²/10.

So I need to solve 60 - p = (p²)/10.

Let me rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the denominator: 10*(60 - p) = p².

So that's 600 -10p = p².

Bring all terms to one side: p² +10p -600 =0.

Now this is a quadratic equation: p² +10p -600 =0.

We can solve this using the quadratic formula. For an equation ax² +bx +c=0, the solutions are x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=10, c=-600.

Discriminant D = 10² -4*1*(-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500.

sqrt(2500)=50.

So p = [-10 ±50]/2.

We can ignore the negative solution because price can't be negative. So:

p = (-10 +50)/2 =40/2=20.

So the equilibrium price is 20 dollars.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. So 60 - p = (p²)/10.

At p=20, Qd =60-20=40. Qs= (20)^2/10=400/10=40. So that matches. So yes, equilibrium price is 20 dollars.

Now, question i) asks for the equilibrium price, which is 20 dollars.

Question ii) asks for the number of barrels sold at equilibrium. Since they are equal at equilibrium, Qd=Qs=40.

But looking at the options:

Option J says 20 dollars, and 40 barrels. Wait, wait, the question says "Number of barrels sold at the equilibrium price." Wait, but wait—wait, I just thought Qd=40 and Qs=40, so total barrels sold is 40 per day.

But looking at the options:

Option J says price 20, barrels 40 per day.

Option H is price 15, 45.

Option F: 40 price, 10 barrels.

Wait, none of the options directly say 40 barrels when the price is 20. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Wait, the options are:

Option J: 20 dollars, 40 barrels.

So the answer would be option J. Because at equilibrium, the price is 20, and the quantity is 40. So the number of barrels sold is 40.

But wait, the options don't have a 40 barrels at 20; they have option J as 20 and 40.

Wait, but wait, the given options are:

Options:

A: 18,54

B:12,72

C:10,70

D:8,64

E:25,50

F:40,10

G:30,50

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the options. Let me check the user's message again.

The options are:

A: Equilibrium price 18, barrels 54

B: 12,72

C:10,70

D:8,64

E:25,50

F:40,10

G:30,50

H:15,45

I:5,30

J:20,40

So option J is 20 dollars and 40 barrels.

Ah, yes. So the answer is option J.

The equilibrium price is found by setting demand equal to supply. The demand function is Qd = 60 - p, and the supply function is Qs = p² / 10. Setting them equal:

60 - p = p² / 10.

Multiplying through by 10 gives:

600 - 10p = p².

Rearranging:

p² + 10p - 600 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, p = [-10 ± sqrt(100 + 2400)] / 2 = [-10 ± 50] / 2. The positive solution is p = 20 dollars.

At equilibrium, Qd = 60 - 20 = 40 barrels. Among the options, this corresponds to option J: equilibrium price is 20 dollars, barrels sold is 40 per day.
