Okay, so I've got this problem here about a furniture manufacturer trying to find out how many end tables they produced in a week. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that the manufacturer knows different numbers of employees and the number of end tables each group produced. Specifically, there are four groups: 8 employees each made 16 end tables, 21 made 23 each, 7 made 27 each, and 4 made 29 each. I need to find the total number of end tables produced during the week.

Wait, so each group has a certain number of employees and each employee made a certain number of end tables. So I think I need to calculate the total per group and then add them all together. Oh right, that makes sense because each employee contributes to the total.

Let me break it down step by step. 

First group: 8 employees each made 16 end tables. So I multiply 8 by 16 to get the total for this group. Let me do that math: 8 * 16. Hmm, 8*10 is 80, and 8*6 is 48, so 80 +48 is 128. So the first group produced 128 end tables.

Second group: 21 employees each made 23 end tables. So 21 * 23. I'm a bit unsure about this one. Let me think. 20*23 is 460, and adding 1*23 is 23, so 460 +23 is 483. So the second group made 483 end tables.

Third group: 7 employees each made 27 end tables. So 7 *27. 7*20 is 140, and 7*7 is 49. Adding them together, 140 +49 is 189. So this group produced 189 end tables.

Fourth group: 4 employees each made 29 end tables. So 4*29. Let me calculate that. 4*20 is 80, and 4*9 is 36. Adding those, 80 +36 is 116. So this group made 116 end tables.

Now I have the totals for each group: 128, 483, 189, and 116. I need to add all these together to get the overall total.

Let me add them in order. Maybe start with 128 + 483. Let's see, 128 + 400 is 528, plus 83 is 611. So 128 +483 = 611.

Next, 611 + 189. Hmm, 611 + 100 is 711, plus 80 is 791, plus 9 is 800. So 611 +189 = 800.

Then, 800 + 116. Let's add 800 + 100 to get 900, plus 16 is 916. So total is 916 end tables.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options, and option A is 916, which matches what I got. Let me just double-check the calculations in case I made a mistake somewhere.

Double-checking each group:

8*16 = 128 ✅

21*23: 21*20=420, 21*3=63, so 420+63=483 ✅

7*27: 7*20=140, 7*7=49, total 189 ✅

4*29: 4*20=80, 4*9=36, 80+36=116 ✅

Adding them: 128 +483 = 611, then 611+189. Let me do this again: 611+100=711, 711+80=791, 791+9=800. Then 800+116=916. Yep, that's correct. So the total is 916 end tables.

Looking back at the options, option A is 916. So the correct answer should be A.

The total number of end tables produced during the week is calculated by adding the products of employees and end tables each group produced. This results in 916 end tables.

Answer:
A: 916 end tables
