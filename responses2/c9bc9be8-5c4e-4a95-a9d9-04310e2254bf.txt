Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. I need to find the mean, median, and mode of a given set of data. The numbers are 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100. Let's see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that the mean is the average. To calculate that, I need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Let's count the numbers: 500, 600, two 800s, four 900s, 1000, 1100. Wait, that's 11 numbers in total. So I'll sum them up:

500 + 600 = 1100
1100 + 800 = 1900
1900 + 800 = 2700
2700 + 900 = 3600
3600 + 900 = 4500
4500 + 900 = 5400
5400 + 900 = 6300
6300 + 1000 = 7300
7300 + 1100 = 8400

Wait, that adds up to 8400. Then, the mean is 8400 divided by 11. Let me compute that. 8400 ÷ 11 is approximately 763.64, but wait, that doesn't seem right because the options have higher numbers. Oh wait, did I add correctly? Let me check again more carefully.

Wait no—that can't be right because the options have higher means. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in adding. Let me add them again step by step:

500 + 600 = 1100
1100 + 800 = 1900
1900 + 800 = 2700
2700 + 900 = 3600
3600 + 900 = 4500
4500 + 900 = 5400
5400 + 900 = 6300
6300 + 1000 = 7300
7300 + 1100 = 8400

Wait, that's still 8400. But the options suggest the mean is around 845, which is close. Wait, maybe I did something wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should recount the numbers. Let me count again:

Numbers are 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100. That's 11 numbers. So adding them again:

500 + 600 = 1100
+800 → 1900
+800 → 2700
+900 → 3600
+900 → 4500
+900 → 5400
+900 → 6300
+1000 → 7300
+1100 → 8400.

Hmm, so the mean is 8400/11. Let me calculate that exactly: 8400 ÷ 11. 11 × 763 is 8393, which leaves a remainder of 7. So 763 and 7/11, which is approximately 763.64. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking at the options provided, the mean in option B is about 845.45. Did I add something wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum. Let me try adding them again. Let me list all the numbers:

500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100.

Let me add them two at a time:

500 + 600 = 1100
800 + 800 = 1600
900 + 900 = 1800
900 + 900 = 1800
900 + 1000 = 1900
1100 is alone.

Wait, that's 5 pairs (10 numbers) and the rest two (500,600,800,800 and 900,900,900,900,900,1000,1100). Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me sum each group:

500 + 600 + 800 +800 +900*4 +1000 +1100.

Wait, 900 occurs four times, right?

So 500 + 600 = 1100
+800 +800 = 1600 → total 1100 +1600 = 2700
+900*4 = 3600 → total 2700 + 3600 = 6300
+1000 = 7300
+1100 = 8400.

Wait, so mean is 8400 /11 ≈ 763.64. But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B says mean is 845.45, which is close but higher. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me recalculate the sum correctly. Let me calculate:

500 + 600 = 1100

1100 + 800 = 1900

1900 + 800 = 2700

2700 +900 = 3600

3600 +900 =4500

4500 +900 =5400

5400 +900=6300

6300 +1000=7300

7300 +1100=8400.

Same result. So the mean is 8400 /11 ≈ 763.64. But the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the sum.

Wait, perhaps I added wrong. Let me add the numbers one by one:

500,

500 +600 =1100,

1100 +800=1900,

1900+800=2700,

2700+900=3600,

3600+900=4500,

4500+900=5400,

5400+900=6300,

6300+1000=7300,

7300+1100=8400.

Yep, that's still 8400. So the mean is 8400 /11 ≈763.64. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the count of the numbers.

Wait, the list is 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100. That's 11 numbers. So 8400 /11 ≈763.64, which is about 763.64. But looking at the options, none have a mean in this range except option B: about 845.45.

So perhaps I'm wrong in the way I added. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should add the numbers in a different order.

Let me group the same numbers:

500,

600,

800*2,

900*4,

1000,

1100.

So sum is 500 +600 + (800*2) + (900*4) +1000 +1100.

Calculating each:

500 +600 =1100

800*2 =1600

900*4=3600

Adding together: 1100 +1600=2700; 2700 +3600=6300; 6300 +1000=7300; 7300 +1100=8400. Same result.

So the mean is 8400/11 ≈763.64. But the options don't have this. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I need to think that the sum is correct, but the options have a mean that's rounded to two decimal places. Let me compute 8400/11 exactly. 11 × 763 = 8393; 8400 -8393=7. So 763 and 7/11. 7/11 is approximately 0.6364, so the mean is approximately 763.64. But in the options, the mean for option B is 845.45, which is way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reading of the problem. Let me check the numbers again.

Looking back at the problem, the numbers are: 500,600,800,800,900,900,900,900,900,1000,1100. Yes, that's 11 numbers. So the sum is 8400, so mean is 763.64. But none of the options have this. So which option is correct? Maybe I made a mistake somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mode. Let me find the mode. The mode is the most frequent number. Looking at the data, 800 occurs twice, 900 occurs four times, which is more than any other number. So the mode is 900. So in the options, all the ones that have mode 900 are options B, C, H, J.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: Mode 1000

B: Mode 900

C: Mode 1000

D: Mode 800

E: Mode 800

F: Mode 1000

G: Mode 900

H: Mode 900

I: Mode 845.45

J: Mode 800

So options B, C, H, and J have mode 900. So the mean and median must be among those. Now, looking at the options:

Option B: Mean 845.45, median 900, mode 900.

Option C: Mean 845.45, median 900, mode 1000. So mode would be 1000, which is not the case.

Option H: Mean 900, median 845.45, mode 900.

Option J: Mean 850, mode 800.

So the only option where mode is 900 is B and H. But the mean is 845.45, which is about 845.45, higher than 763.64.

Let me see what's the mean for option B. It says mean is 845.45. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, wait. Let me reevaluate the sum. Maybe I added wrong. Let me recount each number.

Wait, 500 + 600 is 1100.

Then +800 → 1900.

+800 → 2700.

+900 → 3600.

+900 →4500.

+900 →5400.

+900 →6300.

+1000 →7300.

+1100 → 8400. So yes, sum is 8400.

Mean is 8400 /11 = 763.636... which is 763.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

But option B says mean is 845.45, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum. Let me add the numbers again, perhaps group them differently.

Alternative approach: 500 +600 =1100.

800 +800 =1600.

900*4=3600.

1000+1100=2100.

So sum is 1100 +1600=2700; 2700 +3600=6300; 6300 +2100=8400. Same result.

So mean is 8400/11=763.64. So none of the options have this. But all options have some mean, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm counting the numbers. Let me count once again.

Numbers: 500,600,800,800,900,900,900,900,900,1000,1100.

That's 11 numbers.

So, adding:

500+600 = 1100.

+800 =1900.

+800=2700.

+900=3600.

+900=4500.

+900=5400.

+900=6300.

+1000=7300.

+1100=8400.

Yes, 8400. So mean is 8400/11=763.64.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B's mean is 845.45.

Option C's mean is 845.45.

Option H's mean is 900.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me see: 500+600 is 1100. Then 800+800 is 1600, add to 1100+1600=2700. Then 900 +900 is 1800, add to 2700→4500. Then add 900 →5400, then 1000→6400, and 1100→7500. Wait, that's 7500. But that can't be right because I have 11 numbers.

Hmm, perhaps I'm adding wrong. Let me count the sum again step by step:

500 + 600 =1100.

Add 800 → 1900.

Add 800 → 2700.

Add 900 → 3600.

Add 900 →4500.

Add 900 →5400.

Add 900 →6300.

Add 1000 →7300.

Add 1100 →8400.

Same result. So I'm confident the sum is 8400. So mean is 8400/11=763.64.

Now, looking at the options, the only one where the mean is about 763.64 is none. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem reading. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says:

The series is 500,600,800,800,900,900,900,900,900,1000,1100. So 11 numbers.

Sum is 500+600=1100, plus 800 twice is 1600, added to 1100 makes 2700. Plus 900 four times is 3600. Plus 1000 is 4600, plus 1100 is 5700? No, that's wrong because 1100 is added after 4600?

Wait, no. Let me add all numbers sequentially:

500 →500

+600 →1100

+800 →1900

+800 →2700

+900 →3600

+900 →4500

+900 →5400

+900 →6300

+1000 →7300

+1100 →8400.

Wait, that's 8400. So I'm confident the sum is 8400, so mean is 8400/11≈763.64.

But none of the options have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me add the numbers again using a different approach. Let me group them as pairs:

500 + 600 = 1100 → correct.

800 + 800 = 1600 → correct.

900 + 900 = 1800 → correct.

900 + 900 = 1800 → correct.

900 + 1000 = 1900 → correct.

1100 → correct.

Wait, so the sum is 1100 +1600+1800+1800+1900+1100.

Let me add 1100 +1600 =2700.

+1800 →4500.

+1800 →6300.

+1900 →8200.

+1100 →9300.

Wait, this can't be right because earlier method gave 8400. So which is correct?

This is a problem. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the numbers. Let me recount using another method. Let me write down all the numbers and their sum step by step:

Number list: 500,600,800,800,900,900,900,900,900,1000,1100.

Let me add them in a different order:

Start with 500.

Add 600: 1100.

Add 800: 1900.

Add 800: 2700.

Add 900:3600.

Add 900:4500.

Add 900:5400.

Add 900:6300.

Add 900:7200.

Add 1000:8200.

Add 1100:9300.

Wait, so this gives a sum of 9300. But earlier, I thought the sum is 8400. Hmm, which is correct?

Wait, this is a big discrepancy. Let me count the sum again.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the numbers between 900 and 1000. Let me recount:

The list is 500,600,800,800,900,900,900,900,900,1000,1100.

Wait, that's 11 numbers. So 500 is the first, then 600 is second, 800 third, 800 fourth, 900 fifth, 900 sixth, seventh is 900, eight is 900, ninth is 900, tenth is 1000, eleventh is 1100.

Wait, perhaps I was missing a number. Let me recount the numbers:

1. 500

2.600

3.800

4.800

5.900

6.900

7.900

8.900

9.900

10.1000

11.1100

Wait, that's 11 numbers. So the sum would be:

500 +600 =1100.

+800 =1900.

+800=2700.

+900=3600.

+900=4500.

+900=5400.

+900=6300.

+900=7200.

+1000=8200.

+1100=9300.

So the sum is 9300. So mean is 9300/11=845.45. Oh, wait! I went wrong in the earlier addition. Because when I added 500+600+800+800+900+900+900+900+900+1000+1100, I mistakenly thought the sum was 8400. But actually, it's 9300.

Wait, so the correct sum is 9300. So mean is 9300/11=845.45.

Ah! So that explains why option B says mean is 845.45. Because the sum is 9300, so 9300/11=845.45.

So that corrects the earlier mistake. So the mean is 845.45, which is option B.

Now, the median. The median is the middle number when the data is ordered. Since there are 11 numbers, the median will be the 6th number.

Let me list the numbers in order:

500,600,800,800,900,900,900,900,900,1000,1100.

So the 6th number is 900. So the median is 900.

So the data is:

Mean: 845.45

Median:900

Mode: 900.

Looking at the options:

Option B: mean 845.45, median 900, mode 900.

So that matches.

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The correct option is B. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers is 9300 (correcting the earlier mistake).
2. **Mean**: 9300 divided by 11 equals 845.45.
3. **Median**: The middle number in the ordered list is the 6th number, which is 900.
4. **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently is 900.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

ANSWER: B
