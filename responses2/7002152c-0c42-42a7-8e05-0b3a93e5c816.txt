Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron. Hmm, I remember that de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle, right? Oh wait, the formula. Let me think. Oh yeah, the de Broglie equation is lambda equals h over mv, where h is Planck's constant, m is mass, and v is velocity. But wait, how do I get velocity here because I only know the kinetic energy. 

Oh right, kinetic energy is given. The problem states the kinetic energy is 100 eV. So I need to convert that into energy in joules because Planck's constant is in joule-seconds or something like that. Also, I think the mass of the electron is known. Let me jot down the values I remember.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The electron mass m is about 9.11 x 10^-31 kg. Oh, and the conversion from eV to joules. I think 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So for 100 eV, that would be 100 * 1.602e-19 J, which is 1.602e-17 J.

Wait, but I have to find the velocity from the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². So I can rearrange that to find v. Let's do that. 

K = (1/2)mv² => v = sqrt(2K/m)

Plugging in the numbers. K is 1eV converted to J, which is 1.602e-17 J. m is 9.11e-31 kg.

So v = sqrt( (2 * 1.602e-17) / 9.11e-31 )

Let me compute the numerator first: 2 * 1.602e-17 is 3.204e-17. Divide by 9.11e-31: 3.204e-17 / 9.11e-31.

Let me compute that division. 3.204e-17 divided by 9.11e-31. So 3.204/9.11 is approximately 0.351, and the exponents: 1e-17 / 1e-31 is 1e14. So 0.351e14 = 3.51e13.

So v squared is about 3.51e13. Taking the square root of that, v is sqrt(3.51e13). Let's compute that. The square root of 3.51 is about 1.87, and sqrt(1e13) is 1e6.5, which is 3.16e6, wait no. Wait, sqrt(1e13) is 1e6.5, which is 1e6 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16e6 m/s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's see, 3.51e13 is 3.51 * 1e13. The square root of 3.51 is about 1.873, and sqrt(1e13) is 1e6.5, which is 3.162e6, since sqrt(1e12) is 1e6. So 1.873 * 3.162e6 is approximately 5.96e6 m/s.

Wait, let me do that multiplication: 1.873 * 3.162 is about 1.873 * 3 =5.619, and 1.873 * 0.162≈ 0.302, so total around 5.921e6 m/s. So v ≈ 5.92e6 m/s.

Now, using de Broglie equation: lambda = h / (m * v). So plugging in the numbers.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

m is 9.11e-31 kg.

v is 5.92e6 m/s.

So m*v is 9.11e-31 * 5.92e6 = let's calculate that.

9.11e-31 * 5.92e6 = (9.11 * 5.92) * 1e-25.

9.11 *5.92 is approximately 53.88. So 53.88e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, 53.88e-25 is 5.388e-24 kg·m/s.

Then h/(m*v) is 6.626e-34 / 5.388e-24.

Compute that: 6.626 /5.388 is approximately 1.227, and the exponents: 1e-34 / 1e-24 =1e-10.

So 1.227e-10 meters. Wait, that's 1.227e-10 m. Wait, 1e-10 meters is 1e-10 m. Wait, 1e-10 m is 0.1 nanometers. Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So 0.1e-9 is 1e-10. So lambda is about 1.23e-10 meters, which is 0.123 nm. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 0.123 nm.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. Oh, wait, maybe I should re-calculate v.

Let me recalculate the velocity step. K = 100 eV = 100 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-17 J.

m = 9.109e-31 kg.

So v = sqrt(2K/m) = sqrt( (2 * 1.602e-17) / 9.109e-31 )

Compute numerator: 2 * 1.602e-17 = 3.204e-17.

Denominator: 9.109e-31.

So 3.204e-17 / 9.109e-31 = (3.204 /9.109) * 1e14.

3.204 /9.109 is approximately 0.351 (since 9.109 * 0.35 is about 3.188, which is close to 3.204).

So 0.351 * 1e14 =3.51e13. So v = sqrt(3.51e13) = sqrt(3.51) * 1e6.5.

Wait, 1e13 is (1e6.5)^2. So sqrt(3.51e13) = sqrt(3.51) * 1e6.5. sqrt(3.51) is about 1.873. 1e6.5 is 3.162e6. So 1.873 * 3.162e6 = approx 5.96e6 m/s.

So that's correct. Then m*v is 9.109e-31 * 5.96e6 = let's compute 9.109 *5.96 approximately.

9 *5.96=53.64; 0.109*5.96≈0.65; so total ≈54.29. So 54.29e-25 kg·m/s.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h/(m*v)=6.626e-34 /54.29e-25.

Compute 6.626e-34 /54.29e-25 = (6.626/54.29) * 1e-9.

6.626 /54.29 is approximately 0.122. So 0.122e-9 m, which is 1.22e-10 m. Converting to nm, since 1e-9 is a nm, 1.22e-10 is 0.122 nm. So the de Broglie wavelength is approximately 0.122 nm, which matches option D: 0.123 nm.

But wait, let me make sure about the exact calculation. Let me compute more precisely.

Let me compute 2K/m again.

K=100 eV = 100 * 1.602176634e-19 J = 1.602176634e-17 J.

m=9.1093837015e-31 kg.

v^2= (2K)/m = 2 *1.602176634e-17 /9.1093837015e-31.

So 2 *1.602176634e-17 =3.204353268e-17.

Divide by 9.1093837015e-31:

So 3.204353268e-17 / 9.1093837015e-31= (3.204353268 /9.1093837015 ) * 1e14.

3.204353268 /9.1093837015 ≈ 0.35095.

So 0.35095 *1e14=3.5095e13.

So v = sqrt(3.5095e13) = sqrt(3.5095)*1e6.5.

What's sqrt(3.5095)? It's about 1.873 because 1.873^2 is about 3.509. Let me compute 1.873^2: 1.873 *1.873.

1.8 *1.8 =3.24.

1.8 *0.073=0.1314, 0.073 *1.8=0.1314, 0.073^2=0.005329. So 1.873^2= (1.8 +0.073)^2 = 1.8² +2*(1.8)(0.073) +0.073² =3.24 + 0.2628 +0.005329≈3.5081. So yes, sqrt(3.5095) ≈1.873.

So v≈1.873e6.5 m/s. Wait, 1e6.5 is 3.162e6. So 1.873 *3.162e6 =approx 5.928e6 m/s.

So m*v=9.109e-31 kg *5.928e6 m/s = (9.109 *5.928) *1e(-31+6) = (53.89) *1e-25 = 5.389e-24 kg m/s.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So lambda = h/(m*v) = (6.626e-34)/(5.389e-24) = (6.626/5.389) *1e-10.

6.626 divided by 5.389 is approximately 1.228. So 1.228e-10 m.

Which is 0.1228e-9 m, so 0.1228 nm. Looking at the options, the closest is D: 0.123 nm. So the correct answer should be D.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 100 eV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mK}}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( K = 100 \, \text{eV} = 100 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} = 1.602 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J} \) (kinetic energy).

First, calculate the velocity \( v \) using the kinetic energy formula:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{m}}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-17}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}}
\]

The numerator is \( 2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-17} = 3.204 \times 10^{-17} \), and the denominator is \( 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \). Dividing these gives:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{3.204 \times 10^{-17}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{3.509 \times 10^{13}}
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
v \approx 1.873 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, calculate the momentum \( p = mv \):
\[
p = m \cdot v = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.873 \times 10^6 = 1.71 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Finally, use the de Broglie formula:
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.71 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 3.88 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert to nanometers (\( 1 \, \text{nm} = 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)):
\[
\lambda \approx 0.388 \, \text{nm}
\]

However, this result does not match the expected answer. Upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was a miscalculation in the velocity or momentum step. Correcting the velocity calculation:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-17}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{3.509 \times 10^{13}} \approx 5.92 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Then:
\[
p = m \cdot v = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 5.92 \times 10^6 = 5.38 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Finally:
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{5.38 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 1.23 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 0.123 \, \text{nm}
\]

Thus, the de Broglie wavelength is approximately **0.123 nm**, which corresponds to option **D**.
