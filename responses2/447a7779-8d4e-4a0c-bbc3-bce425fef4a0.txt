Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about schools of law and their views on custom becoming a law. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking which school supports the view that a custom becomes a law when it receives judicial recognition by courts. The options are A to J, each with a different school name.

First, I need to remember what each of these schools believe about the relationship between custom and law. I'm a bit fuzzy on some of them, but I'll try to recall.

Option A: Critical Legal Studies School. I think Critical Legal Studies is known for challenging traditional legal theories and examining the boundaries between law and morality. They might argue that certain customs can't be reduced to legal principles because they're based on moral values or have historical precedents that go beyond the law.

Option B: Legal Realism School. This school, I believe, focuses on the idea that law is a product of human society and culture, and that it's not necessarily arbitrary. They might argue that laws are established for the sake of order and efficiency, not because they are created by some arbitrary custom.

Option C: Historical School. This one probably looks at law through the lens of its historical development. They might consider how legal traditions have evolved over time and how certain customs have become laws based on their historical necessity or recognition.

Option D: Natural Law School. This school tends to view law as a natural consequence of human nature and society. They might believe that laws are not arbitrary but are instead the result of the inherent rules of society. So a custom that's recognized by courts might become law if it fits into the societal norms.

Wait, the question says the custom receives judicial recognition. So the court says it's a law. So we're looking for a school that supports the view that the custom is law once recognized.

Option E: Analytical School. I think the Analytical School, like the Critical Legal Studies, takes a more critical approach, examining how law and morality intersect. They might argue that certain customs can't be reduced to law because they exist in a world that's governed by both law and morality.

Option F: Law and Economics School. I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe this school combines legal studies with economics, looking at the economic aspects of law. They might argue that certain laws are justified based on economic principles, so a custom that's recognized by courts might not be arbitrary but is justified by its economic impact.

Option G: Sociological School. This school probably looks at how society structures law. They might argue that certain customs are dictated by societal norms and that a custom recognized by courts is a reflection of societal values.

Option H: Normative School. This school is about the rules of law as they should be, not just what is customary. They might believe that a custom must be law if it's in the best interest of society, based on moral or ethical standards.

Option I: Feminist Jurisprudence School. I'm not familiar with this one. It might focus on how gender and other factors influence legal systems. They might argue that certain legal norms are based on gendered values and that a custom recognized by courts might not be arbitrary.

Option J: Positivist School. Positivism is all about evidence and observation, believing that laws are based on observable and measurable facts. This school might argue that a custom must be law because it's observable and has practical consequences.

So the question is about which school supports the view that a custom becomes law upon judicial recognition. Let me think about each option.

If the school says that a custom becomes law when recognized, that sounds like they believe the custom is arbitrary and needs judicial recognition to become law. So they probably agree that the custom is not law without courts recognizing it.

Looking at the options:

A and H both are related to law and morality. A is more about critical theories, while H is about normative rules. So they might agree that certain customs can't be law on their own and only become law when recognized.

C, the Historical School, might argue that a custom becomes law based on historical necessity. So courts recognize it as a law because it's necessary for the society.

D, Natural Law School, might say that a custom that fits societal norms becomes law, not because it's arbitrary, but as a natural outcome of human nature.

Wait, the question is about a school that supports the view that the custom is law upon judicial recognition. So the school would argue that the recognition makes it law.

So which of these schools would support that?

Option C: The Historical School might say that a custom becomes law when it's recognized because it's necessary for the society's functioning.

Option D: Natural Law School would support that the custom is law because it's natural.

H: The Normative School would think that law should be as per moral or ethical standards, so a custom recognized by courts must be law.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about support for the view that the custom becomes law upon judicial recognition. So the school should agree that the custom, when recognized by courts, becomes law.

So, which school would say that?

Option C: The Historical School. They might argue that a custom comes into being when recognized by courts because it's necessary for the society's order.

Option D: Natural Law School might say that the custom is law as it's natural, without needing courts to recognize it.

Option H: The Normative School would think that law is a product of moral judgment, so a custom recognized as law must be law.

Wait, the question is asking which school supports the view that the custom becomes law upon judicial recognition. So the school would agree that once courts recognize it, it becomes law.

So the school's belief is that the custom is not law on its own but becomes law when courts recognize it.

Which of these supports that?

Option C: The Historical School might support that, because they look at historical necessity. Option D: Natural Law School might think the custom is law without courts. Option H: The Normative School would think law is a moral standard.

So the answer is likely either C or D.

Wait, but the question is about which school supports the view that the custom becomes law upon judicial recognition. So the school believes that the recognition makes it law.

So, for example, the Natural Law School might say that the custom is law because it's natural.

The Historical School would say the custom becomes law because it's necessary for the society.

The Analytical School, like option E, might argue that a custom is law based on its necessity, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about each:

- A: Critical Legal Studies. They might argue that custom is not law because it's arbitrary.

- B: Legal Realism. They might say law is arbitrary but serves purposes.

- C: Historical School. They believe a custom must be law to maintain society's order.

- D: Natural Law School. They believe the custom is inherently law and doesn't need courts' recognition.

- E: Analytical School. They might see a custom as law based on necessity.

- F: Law and Economics. They might think the custom is justified by its economic impact.

- G: Sociological School. They might argue the custom is a reflection of societal norms, so recognition makes it law.

- H: Normative School. They think law is a product of moral judgment, so a custom recognized becomes law.

- I: Feminist Jurisprudence School. They might consider gender in law, but I'm not sure.

- J: Positivists think laws are based on observable facts.

So the question is about which school supports the view that a custom becomes law upon judicial recognition.

Looking at the options, the answer is likely option C or D.

Wait, the question states "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer must be one letter (A-J), and the reasoning must end with that letter.

If the answer is option C, then the letter is C, which is 'C'. If the answer is D, then 'D' is the letter.

Which school supports the view that upon recognition, a custom becomes law.

Option C: The Historical School. They believe that a custom comes into being as a law because it's necessary for the society.

Option D: Natural Law School. They believe the custom is inherently law and doesn't need courts to recognize it.

So, the view in the question is that a custom becomes law upon recognition. So this would imply that the school believes the recognition makes it law, which is the historical perspective.

So the answer is option C, which is 'C'.

The question asks which school supports the view that a custom becomes law when it receives judicial recognition by courts. To determine the correct answer, we analyze each school's perspective:

- **Option A (Critical Legal Studies School)**: Argues that certain customs cannot be reduced to legal principles because they are based on moral values or historical precedents.

- **Option B (Legal Realism School)**: Focuses on law as a product of human society and culture, not necessarily arbitrary.

- **Option C (Historical School)**: Argues that a custom becomes law based on historical necessity and necessity for society's order.

- **Option D (Natural Law School)**: Believes a custom is inherently law and doesn't require judicial recognition.

- **Option E (Analytical School)**: Examines law through evidence and observation, suggesting a custom must be law based on its observable benefits.

- **Option F (Law and Economics School)**: Combines legal studies with economics, considering legal norms based on economic principles.

- **Option G (Sociological School)**: Argues that a custom reflects societal norms, so recognition makes it law.

- **Option H (Normative School)**: Believes law is a product of moral judgment, so a custom recognized becomes law.

- **Option I (Feminist Jurisprudence School)**: Focuses on gender in law, which may not be relevant here.

- **Option J (Positivist School)**: Argues laws are based on observable facts, not moral judgment.

The question emphasizes that the custom becomes law upon recognition, which aligns with the **Historical School** (Option C), as they believe the necessity of a custom for society's order makes it law when recognized. 

ANSWER: C
