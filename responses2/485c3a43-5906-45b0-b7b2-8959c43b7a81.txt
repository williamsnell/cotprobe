Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.

As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times."
Thomas Jefferson, 1816

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about amendments to the Constitution, and I need to figure out which one aligns with the sentiments expressed in a particular passage about Thomas Jefferson. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me a passage that goes into the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson. He talks about how men look at constitutions as sacred, like an ark of the covenant. He mentions that these institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of human mind, so as the mind becomes more developed, institutions must also change. He also refers to how laws and institutions are built on the progress of human thought, and that as their times change, so do institutions.

Looking at the options provided, I need to find which amendment corresponds to these sentiments. Let me go through each option and see which one fits.

Option A: The Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol. This was a result of the seven-year的规定 on alcohol, not an amendment. It's more of a passage law, not an amendment, so probably not the right choice.

Option B: The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to all born or naturalized in the U.S. This was about equal rights and ended slavery, but I don't recall specific sentiments about the covenant or the idea that laws should be sacred. So maybe not the one.

Option C: The Nineteenth Amendment guaranteed all women the right to vote. The passage mentions that as institutions must go with human mind, perhaps when women's rights were considered, they might have been something Jefferson was thinking about. But I'm not sure if the passage directly mentions this. It's possible, but I'm not certain.

Option D: The Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination. That's related to the rule of law and self-citizenship, which doesn't seem to align with the sentiments about sacred laws. So probably not.

Option E: The Second Amendment gave the right to bear arms. That's about freedoms and rights, but again, I'm not sure if it directly relates to the sentiment in the passage. The passage was about laws being sacred and needing to be part of the progress of mind.

Option F: The Twenty-sixth Amendment lowered voting age to 18. Again, this is a specific change, not an amendment, but more about implementation than philosophy. So probably not the answer.

Option G: The First Amendment gave a right to free speech. This seems related to the idea of sacred laws, as the passage talks about looking at constitutions with reverence. The First Amendment does support free speech, which could be seen as a form of sacred right. This might align with the sentiment.

Option H: The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery. That's about the end of slavery, which was a significant event but not directly about the sentiment of sacred laws. So probably not the answer.

Option I: The Seventeenth Amendment established direct election of senators. This is a specific event, but again, not an amendment. It's more about the process.

Option J: The Tenth Amendment allows federal government powers to be given to states. That's about states' rights and separation of powers, which doesn't seem to fit the sentiments in the passage.

Wait, so let's think again. The passage is about how laws and institutions must go with the mind's development. So perhaps the sentiments are about how laws are sacred and should be part of the fabric of the mind. The First Amendment does support free speech, which as a right is also seen as sacred. So the First Amendment would fit.

Wait, but the passage says that Jefferson was thinking about laws as sacred, and institutions which must go with mind. So perhaps the right answer is the First Amendment, which supports free speech, hence a form of sacred right.

Alternatively, another thought: the passage mentions that men ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human. So perhaps this is about the progressive wisdom, which relates to the development of the mind. So an amendment that reflects this progress might be the Thirteenth Amendment? Or the First Amendment?

Wait, perhaps I should think about each amendment and their content. The First Amendment is about free speech, which as a fundamental right is often seen as a form of sacred right. The passage mentions that men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, which is akin to looking at the First Amendment.

On the other hand, the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery, which is a different matter. The passage is about the state of mind and how institutions should change.

So, putting it together, the answer should be G: The First Amendment, which prohibits the right to bear arms. But wait, the passage talks about laws and institutions going with the mind's development. So perhaps the question is pointing towards something about the state of mind and the necessity of sacred laws, which the First Amendment does support.

Alternatively, maybe the passage is more about the idea that laws should be part of the mind's development, making the First Amendment's sacred right a good fit. So the correct answer is G: The First Amendment.

The correct answer is G: The First Amendment, which guarantees the right to free speech. This aligns with the sentiments expressed in the passage, as Jefferson's ideas about sacred laws and the necessity of institutions to progress with the mind suggest that free speech should be a form of sacred right. The First Amendment supports this by emphasizing the right to bear arms, thus fitting the sentiments.

Answer: G
