Okay, so I have this question about bioluminescent worms and how to prove they're the original species. Hmm, let's think. Bioluminescent means they emit light, right? And the question is about determining if a new species is the worm itself or some other bacteria producing that light.

Wait, so the options are A to E. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Feed the worm with special food. That sounds like they'd want to add something to test it, but I'm not sure how that would help prove it's the original. Maybe if the food is toxic to bacteria, but that's not directly helping the worm's own characteristics.

Option B: Place the light-producing substance in growth media. Oh, wait, if the bacteria is producing light, then the worm, which is bioluminescent, would also produce light. So if you put them both in the same growth media and see if they glow, that might show they're the same. But wait, the question is about the original being the worm, not the bacteria. So maybe the bacteria isn't the right approach here. Unless the bacteria is somehow harmful, but I don't think that's the way to go.

Option C: Observe the worm in a dark environment. Light usually travels differently in dark environments. Bioluminescent organisms emit light, and in dark spots, they might use other methods to detect or produce light. If the worm is in a dark environment, perhaps it can't produce light on its own, making it stand out. But I'm not sure how this directly shows it's the worm.

Option D: Expose the worm to sunlight. That's a straightforward test. If the worm is the original, it should emit light when exposed to sunlight. If another species is the same, they might not. So this seems like a direct method. But I'm not sure if exposing to sunlight is the best method, or if some organisms can't respond.

Option E: Treat with antibiotics. This is to eliminate potential bacteria. But if the worm is already bioluminescent, adding antibiotics wouldn't change that. Plus, this might not help prove it's the original, more like testing for another species.

Wait, the question is to prove it's the worm. So if the worm is bioluminescent, any test that shows it emits light would support it being the original. So looking for a method that confirms the worm's own light production.

Option B says placing the substance in growth media. Well, if the bacteria is producing the light, then the worm would too. Wait, but the question is about determining if the worm is the original species. Maybe the bacteria is a contaminant, so the worm's own characteristics (like light emission) would be present. But I'm not sure if that's a direct method.

Alternatively, option C: observing in a dark environment. Maybe the worm can't produce light in a dark environment, while the bacteria might. So if the worm is in a dark spot, it can't emit light, making it stand out.

Wait, but how does that help prove it's the worm? If another species is the same, they can't produce light in a dark environment. So if the worm is the original, it would glow in the dark, while others would not. So option C would show that the worm is the only one that glows in the dark. That makes sense.

Alternatively, option D: exposing to sunlight. If the worm is the original, it should glow, but perhaps others don't. So exposing it to light would show it's the only one. But again, it's a direct method.

Wait, but the options are about the method to prove it's the original. So perhaps the correct approach is to see if the worm can produce light under certain conditions. If it's the original, then it can. If others are present, they might not.

So options B and C are about placement and observation.

Option B: placing the substance in media where it can be detected. Maybe the bacteria's substance is toxic, so the media would not support growth. If the worm is in a controlled environment where it can produce light, it would glow, while the bacteria can't. That would indicate the worm is the original.

Option C: observing in dark environment. If the worm is in a dark spot, it can't produce light, so it won't emit. If it's in a light spot, it can. So in a dark environment, the worm would glow, showing it's the original.

Hmm, but both options B and C could be methods to prove it's the original. The question is about the last character being the letter chosen.

Looking back at the options, the question asks which method would prove the worm is the original. So in a controlled environment, the presence of light would show it's the original. So either B or C.

Wait, but option B is placing the substance in growth media. If the bacteria is producing the substance, then in growth media, the bacteria would produce it. The worm would also produce it. So if they're placed in the same media, the bacteria and the worm would glow together. But this doesn't help prove the worm is the original. It would just show that both species can produce the substance.

Wait, but the idea is to identify the original species. So for example, if the worm is in a medium where it emits light, and the bacteria isn't, but the bacteria is in the same medium, that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the bacteria is toxic to other species, but that's not directly about the original.

Alternatively, if you give the bacteria some antibiotic, and the bacteria dies, but that doesn't prove the worm is the original.

Wait, I think I need to think about the purpose of each option.

The question is to prove the worm is the original. So the best method would be to find a characteristic that only the original species possesses.

Option C: Observe in a dark environment. If the worm is in a dark environment, it can't produce light. If the bacteria is in a dark environment with the same substance, they would both glow. So this would show that the worm is the only one glowing, supporting it as the original.

Alternatively, if the worm is in a light spot, the bacteria can't, so only the worm would glow.

So both C and B could be methods. But the question is about the method to prove it's the original.

Wait, maybe option C is a better approach because it's a specific condition to test. For example, if the worm is in a dark environment and the bacteria is in the same spot, the bacteria might not be able to produce light. Thus, the worm would glow, proving it's the original.

Alternatively, option B is about placing the substance in growth media. The bacteria would produce it, and so would the worm. So if the worm is in a medium where it can produce light, but the bacteria can't, that wouldn't help. It would show that the bacteria is the one that's producing the light, but not the worm.

Wait, but the question is about determining whether the worm is the original species. So maybe the correct method is to test if the worm can emit light in a controlled environment, while others can't.

So option C would show that the worm can emit light, while others can't. So the correct answer would be C.

To determine whether the new species of bioluminescent worm is the original species and not a contaminating bacteria, the best approach is to identify a characteristic that only the original species possesses. 

**Option A** suggests feeding the worm with special food, but this does not directly prove the worm is the original species. It could be a toxic substance affecting the worm's bioluminescence.

**Option B** proposes placing the bioluminescent substance in growth media or examining it under a microscope. While this could reveal the presence of the bioluminescent substance, it does not distinguish between the original worm and a contaminating bacteria.

**Option C** involves observing the worm in a dark environment. Bioluminescent organisms typically emit light, and in a dark environment, they may not be detected. This observation would show that the original worm can emit light in a dark spot, while the bacteria, which produces the light, cannot. This method directly identifies the original species by demonstrating the absence of light emission in a dark environment.

**Option D** involves exposing the worm to sunlight. While this could show the original worm emitting light, it does not provide specific evidence of the worm being the original species. Many organisms can emit light even in sunlight.

**Option E** suggests treating the worm with antibiotics to eliminate potential bacteria. This approach is not relevant to proving the worm is the original species, as it does not address the bioluminescent characteristic of the worm.

The most effective method to prove the worm is the original species is **Option C**, as it directly demonstrates the absence of light emission in a dark environment, characteristic of the original species while potentially indicating the presence of a contaminating bacteria.

**Answer: C**
