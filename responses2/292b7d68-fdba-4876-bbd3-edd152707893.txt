Question:

According to the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, when interpreting and reporting test results, one should

Options:

A: exclude the potential effects of situational and demographic variables from consideration
B: Avoid discussing the test results with the tester to prevent performance anxiety
C: Give more weight to the lowest score as it indicates areas for improvement
D: Always associate test results with the tester's demographic information for context
E: use descriptive labels, because such labels readily communicate specific meanings to most people
F: Neglect the confidence interval, since the obtained score represents the true score
G: focus attention on the confidence interval of a score rather than on the obtained score itself
H: stress the obtained score, since it is the best estimate of the true score
I: Only interpret the scores in comparison to the average result of the group
J: Consider only the highest obtained score as it demonstrates the tester's potential

Okay, I have to figure out the right answer to this multiple-choice question about interpreting test results based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. Let me go through each option step by step.

The question is asking what one should do when interpreting and reporting test results. Let me recall the relevant sections from the standards.

Option A says to exclude the effects of situational and demographic variables. I remember that in testing, factors like the test-taker's background, environment, and other external variables can influence results. So, excluding them might not be the best approach. Maybe it's better to adjust for those variables rather than entirely excluding them.

Option B: Avoid discussing with the tester to prevent performance anxiety. I'm not too sure about this. Discussing might make the test-taker anxious, which could affect performance. Alternatively, perhaps it's about ensuring the tester doesn't know the results in a way that affects performance. But I'm not certain if avoiding discussion is a standard practice or just a precaution.

Option C: Give more weight to the lowest score. That seems counterintuitive. Lower scores often indicate areas for improvement, so giving them more weight might not be advisable. Maybe it's the opposite; perhaps higher scores should carry more weight. So I'm leaning against this option.

Option D: Always associate with the tester's demographic info. Demographics can affect performance, so using them as context could help. But does the test require this? I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to not always do it or to use it as context when appropriate.

Option E: Use descriptive labels because they communicate meanings well. Descriptive labels are more common and accessible, so this seems correct. They help in conveying specific meanings, making the results more understandable.

Option F: Neglect confidence intervals. The test results are estimates, and confidence intervals provide a range around the score, indicating uncertainty. Without them, people might not know how reliable the score is. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Focus on confidence interval, not the obtained score. The obtained score is the best estimate, but the CI gives more information. So G is trying to avoid that, which is wrong.

Option H: Stress the obtained score since it's the best estimate. This makes sense because the score is the best guess, but the CI is more informative. So H is correct.

Option I: Only compare to group average. This doesn't capture individual differences or context. It might not be the best approach.

Option J: Consider only highest score. This ignores the possibility of lower scores being just as important. Maybe it's not the only factor.

Now, looking at the options:

From what I recall, the correct approach is to use descriptive labels because they are easily understood. But wait, option E says "use descriptive labels, because such labels readily communicate specific meanings to most people." That sounds correct.

Alternatively, option H says: "Focus attention on the confidence interval of a score rather than on the obtained score itself." Wait, that might not be correct either. The confidence interval is more about uncertainty and reliability, so I think the correct approach is to present the obtained score and its confidence interval.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. According to the standards, what do they recommend? The standards might say to present the score along with its variability, like the confidence interval. So option H is about focusing on the CI rather than the score itself. So H could be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option E is correct, as using descriptive labels is standard.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about what one should do when interpreting and reporting test results. The correct approach is to present the obtained score and the confidence interval, but each option seems to present a different point.

Looking at the options again:

H states: "Focus attention on the confidence interval of a score rather than on the obtained score itself." This seems to be about not just presenting the score but also its variability.

Wait, but option E is about using descriptive labels because they are easily understood, which is important for communication.

I think the correct answer is H. Because the standard requires that you present both the score and the confidence interval for better understanding. So the correct option would be H.

The correct answer is **H: focus attention on the confidence interval of a score rather than on the obtained score itself**. This aligns with the standards' emphasis on presenting both the score and its variability, offering a more comprehensive understanding.

Answer: H
