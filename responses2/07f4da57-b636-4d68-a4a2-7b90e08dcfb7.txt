Question:

Black-headed gulls remove broken eggshells from their nests immediately after the young have hatched. Explain the biological significance of this behavior.

Options:

A: Gulls remove eggshells as a part of their feeding habit
B: Gulls use the removed eggshells as a source of calcium for the young birds
C: Eggshell-removing behavior is significant in that it reduces the chances of a nest being robbed, thus enhancing the survival of offspring.
D: The removal of eggshells is a ritualistic behavior with no direct biological significance
E: Gulls remove eggshells to reuse them for building nests
F: Gulls remove eggshells to prevent injury to the young birds in the nest
G: The removal of eggshells is a territorial display to deter rival gulls from the area
H: Eggshells are removed to make space for more eggs to be laid in the same season
I: Removing eggshells helps regulate the temperature within the nest for the young birds
J: The gulls remove the eggshells to keep their nests clean

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about black-headed gulls. The question is about their behavior of removing eggshells from nests after their young hatched. I remember that black-headed gulls are known for this behavior, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me think about what I know. Black-headed gulls are part of the species Myo glossinotids, right? They're similar to the common hawks but have some differences. One of their behaviors is to remove broken eggshells. I think this helps with the young birds' health. If the eggs are broken, especially if the shell is cracked, that could be a problem because the young birds might not be able to develop properly.

Wait, what's the significance of this? If the eggs are broken, especially if they're cracked, it might indicate that the parents are not well-nourished. So, the young birds might not survive as long because they can't process the eggs properly. Therefore, removing the eggshells helps the parents maintain their health, which in turn benefits the offspring. That makes me think option B is correct.

Option A says they're part of their feeding habit. But that's more of a general behavior, not specific to removing eggshells. So A probably isn't the best fit.

Option C talks about reducing the chances of robbery. That's more of a social survival strategy, but I don't think that's the primary reason. The main issue is the health of the eggshells, especially if they're cracked, so the egg can't be processed properly.

Option D says it's ritualistic with no biological significance. No, I don't think that's the case. The removal is definitely important for the birds' development.

Option E is about reusing eggs for nests. But I don't recall this as a primary reason. The main reason is the health and functionality of the eggs.

Option F: preventing injury. Well, if the eggshells are broken, that could cause injury, but the primary reason is health, not just safety.

Option G is territorial display. I don't think so. It's more about health than competition.

Option H: making space for more eggs. That doesn't seem right. More eggs usually require more space, so removing the existing ones might not make sense.

Option I: regulating temperature. Not sure about this. I don't think eggshells removal directly relates to temperature regulation.

Option J: keeping nests clean. That's a good point. If the eggs are broken, the area might become cluttered. So removing them helps keep the nests tidy, which is a good habit.

So putting it all together, the primary reason is preventing the eggs from being broken, which in turn helps the young birds develop properly. That would make J the correct answer.

The correct answer is **J: The gulls remove the eggshells to keep their nests clean.** 

This behavior is crucial because it prevents the nests from becoming cluttered and ensures that the eggs can be processed properly, which is vital for the health and development of the young birds. It serves as a protective and efficient way to maintain nest functionality.

Answer: J
