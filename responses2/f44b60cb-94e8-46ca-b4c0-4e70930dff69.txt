Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about entropy and gases. Hmm, I remember that entropy has to do with disorder, right? Or maybe it's about the number of possible arrangements the particles can have. Let me think.

The question says: there's a 2.0 L flask with 0.40 g of helium gas. Then, the helium is evacuated into a larger container, and the temperature is held constant. What happens to the entropy of the helium? The options are A to J.

Wait, entropy is a measure of disorder, so when you have more disorder, the entropy increases. But wait, also, some factors affect entropy. Oh right, for ideal gases, entropy depends on temperature, volume, and the number of particles. Oh, right, the formula for entropy change in an ideal gas is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + ... wait, but for ideal gases, when you expand the volume, the entropy increases because the molecules can move around more.

But wait, in this problem, the temperature is held constant. Oh, so the process is isothermal. So for an ideal gas at constant temperature, the entropy change depends on the volume change. So when you take the gas from a small volume to a larger volume, the entropy increases because the molecules have more space to move around. So the process would increase the entropy of the gas.

Let me think about the options. Option A says the entropy increases because the gas is more dispersed. That sounds right. Option H says entropy decreases because the molecules collide more often. Wait, collision frequency relates to temperature? No, wait, higher volume would mean less frequent collisions, because each molecule has less space, so moving around less. So at higher volume, the number of collisions per molecule decreases. So if the initial state is in 2.0 L and the new state is larger, the number of collisions would be lower, which would mean lower entropy. But wait, no, that's for the gas's collision frequency.

Wait, but wait, entropy is about the number of possible microstates. For an ideal gas, if you expand it, the volume increases, so the number of microstates increases because the particles can be in more states. So the entropy increases.

But in this problem, the gas is being made larger. So the volume goes from 2.0 L to, say, 4.0 L. So the volume increases, the entropy would increase.

Wait, but what if the number of moles changes? No, the helium was 0.40 g, and it's being emptied into a larger container. So the number of moles doesn't change. So the number of molecules is same. So the only change is the volume and temperature (but temperature is held constant). So for the same number of moles, when you expand the volume, the entropy increases because more microstates are available.

Wait, but wait, the formula for entropy change for an ideal gas at constant temperature is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1). So if V increases, ln(V2/V1) is positive, so ΔS is positive. So entropy increases. So the correct answer would be option A: It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.

Wait, but wait another thought: when you move the gas into a larger container, are you doing work on it? Because if you're expanding the volume, you're doing work against the external pressure, which would release energy. But the question says the temperature is held constant, implying that the process is isothermal. So maybe the work done is considered in the entropy change, but I think for an ideal gas, entropy change is calculated using the formula I mentioned.

Wait, but the problem is about the entropy of the helium gas. So the process is moving the gas into a larger container, but the temperature remains same. So the helium is still at the same temperature as before. So when you expand the volume, for an ideal gas, the entropy increases because the number of possible microstates increases. So the correct effect on entropy is an increase.

Looking at the options, option A says it will increase because the gas molecules are more dispersed. That makes sense. Option H says it will decrease because they collide less often. Oh wait, collision frequency is related to volume. Oh wait, the frequency of collisions is roughly proportional to 1/(volume) times some other factors. So if the volume increases, the number of collisions per molecule decreases. So from the perspective of the gas's kinetic energy and movement, the collisions are less frequent, which would mean the entropy (which depends on how the molecules are distributed) is lower?

Wait, no, wait. Because entropy is about the number of possible microstates. If the volume increases, the number of microstates increases because the gas can be in more places. So the entropy should be higher. So maybe the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another angle: the problem says the number of helium molecules doesn't change. So when you move them into a larger container at the same temperature, the pressure would decrease. But in the larger container, the molecules are more spaced out. So the number of collisions per molecule would decrease. But entropy is about the number of ways the molecules can move. So more possible microstates mean higher entropy. So the correct answer would be A.

Alternative reasoning: the formula for entropy change is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) for an ideal gas at constant T. So since V2 is larger than V1, ln is positive, so ΔS is positive. So the entropy increases.

So the correct answer is option A.

The question involves analyzing the effect of moving helium gas from a smaller flask to a larger one while maintaining constant temperature. The key factors to consider are the entropy change and the behavior of ideal gases.

For an ideal gas at constant temperature, the entropy change is given by:

\[
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

Here, \(n\) is the number of moles of gas, \(R\) is the gas constant, \(V_1\) is the initial volume, and \(V_2\) is the final volume. Since the temperature is constant, the entropy change depends only on the volumes. If \(V_2 > V_1\), the entropy change \(\Delta S\) is positive, indicating an increase in entropy. This is because the gas molecules have more microstates to occupy, leading to greater disorder.

In this scenario, the helium gas is vacated from a 2.0 L flask and moved to a larger container. The number of helium molecules remains the same, but the volume increases. The entropy of the gas increases because the gas molecules can occupy more space, resulting in more possible microstates. This also aligns with the intuition that the gas is more "dispersed" in the larger container.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: "It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask." This is correct because the larger volume allows for more microstates and greater dispersion.
- **B**: "It will remain constant as the helium is simply transferred to a larger container." Incorrect, as entropy changes with volume for an ideal gas at constant temperature.
- **C**: "It will remain constant because the volume of the flask does not affect entropy." Incorrect, as entropy depends on both temperature and volume for ideal gases.
- **D**: "It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change." Incorrect, as the number of molecules remains the same but the volume change affects entropy.
- **E**: "It will increase as the temperature is held constant." While the temperature is constant, the entropy change depends on the volume change, not the temperature directly.
- **F**: "It will decrease as the pressure of the gas will decrease in the larger flask." Incorrect, as the pressure decreases, but entropy increases due to increased microstates.
- **G**: "It will decrease as the number of collisions between the helium molecules in the larger flask will decrease." Incorrect, as the number of collisions decreases, but entropy increases due to more microstates.
- **H**: "It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask." Incorrect, as the gas becomes more disordered in the larger container, leading to a higher entropy.
- **I**: "It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask." Incorrect, as the larger volume reduces the frequency of collisions.
- **J**: "It will increase because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask more often than they did in the smaller flask." Incorrect, as the larger volume reduces the frequency of collisions.

The correct answer is **A**, as the entropy increases due to the gas molecules being more dispersed in the larger flask.
