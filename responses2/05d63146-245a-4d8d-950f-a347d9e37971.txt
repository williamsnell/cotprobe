Okay, so I have this problem here where an ant is crawling from the point (-4,6) to the origin, and then it continues on to (4,3). I need to figure out how far the ant travels in total. The question gives me options from A to J, and I have to pick the correct answer.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this. The ant starts at (-4,6), which is in the second quadrant. It goes straight to the origin (0,0) and then to (4,3) in the first quadrant. So the path is two straight line segments connected at the origin.

I remember that to find the distance between two points, I can use the distance formula. The formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So I'll apply this formula twice—once for each segment of the ant's path.

First, let me calculate the distance from (-4,6) to (0,0). Plugging into the formula: sqrt[(0 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 6)^2]. Simplify inside the square roots: (0 +4)^2 is 16, and (0-6)^2 is 36. Adding those gives 16 + 36 = 52. So the distance is sqrt(52). Wait, can I simplify that? Yeah, sqrt(52) is sqrt(4*13) which is 2*sqrt(13). So the first segment is 2√13 units long.

Next, the ant goes from the origin (0,0) to (4,3). Using the distance formula again: sqrt[(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2]. That's sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5. So the second segment is 5 units long.

Now, to find the total distance, I add the two segments together: 2√13 + 5. Looking at the options, option D is 5 + 2√13, which matches my calculation. So I think D is the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I apply the formula correctly each time? For the first part, (-4,6) to (0,0): x goes from -4 to 0, so difference is 4. y goes from 6 to 0, difference is 6. Squared, they are 16 and 36. Sum is 52, square root is 2√13. Correct.

Second part, (0,0) to (4,3): x is 4, y is 3. Squared, 16 and 9. Sum is 25, sqrt is 5. So yes, total distance is 5 + 2√13, which is option D. That's one of the choices, so I'm confident.

The total distance the ant travels is calculated by adding the distances of the two segments. The first segment from (-4,6) to (0,0) has a distance of \(2\sqrt{13}\), and the second segment from (0,0) to (4,3) has a distance of 5. Thus, the total distance is \(5 + 2\sqrt{13}\), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
