Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Rawls' ethics and the Possible Worlds model, specifically regarding what the POP (Plurality ofPOVs) would choose regarding 'social primary goods'. Hmm, I remember that Rawls talked a lot about these primary goods being things like education, healthcare, and property rights. 

The question asks which proposition is most consistent with Rawls' claims about the POP's choices. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says the POP will choose wealth over a compassionate society. Wait, what's the Rawlsian stance here? I think Rawls talked about the concept of justice as fairness and equality. He emphasized that social goods should be distributed according to the greatest happiness principle. So, he probably wouldn't favor a society that's compassionate over wealth, especially in a world like ours. Because in our world, wealth is a significant factor, and compassion is a societal construct. So A might not align with Rawls.

Option B: The POP will choose equality over power. Let me think. Rawls talked about the importance of equality in society. He mentions that equality is a necessary condition for justice and that it should be the basis for all social goods. So the POP would probably support equality over power. That sounds like it's consistent with Rawls. 

Option C: The POP will be unselfish. Wait, unselfish is about being generous with one's resources, which is a bit different. Rawls talked about justice in society, not personal self-interest. He might argue that fairness is a better outcome for the community. So C might not align with Rawls' views, especially if he's talking about the POP's choices regarding primary goods.

Option D: The POP will choose to protect the disabled. I'm not sure about this. The POP includes different voices, so they might prioritize the protection of those with disabilities. But does that align with Rawls' main ideas? I think Rawls focused on a more systemic approach, like the distribution of goods, rather than individual protection. So D might not be consistent with his view.

So putting it together: options B and others. Option B seems to fit because Rawls supports equality as the basis for social primary goods. I'm pretty confident that's correct.

The correct answer is:

**B: The POP will choose equality over power.**

**Explanation:**
Rawls argued that equality is a fundamental aspect of justice and should be the basis for social primary goods. The POP would align with this by prioritizing equality over power, as this aligns with Rawls' emphasis on fairness and equity in a just society.
