Question:

Walking down a street late at night, an adult male pedestrian notices a young female on the ground, not moving. The female is on the opposite side of the street. Crossing the street, the pedestrian notices that the young woman appears both much wealthier than he is and is of a different ethnicity. Seeing no one else present, the pedestrian renders aid. According to the bystander effect, which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts?

Options:

A: The presence of a security camera on the street
B: The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl
C: The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one
D: The presence of a large, intimidating dog near the girl
E: The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one
F: The person requiring aid appearing to be less wealthy than initially thought
G: The person requiring aid appearing to be older rather than younger
H: The person requiring aid appearing to be of the same gender rather than a different one

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this bystander effect question. Let me start by understanding what the question is about. 

The scenario is an adult male pedestrian noticing a young woman on the opposite side of the street. She's wealthier and of a different ethnicity. He doesn't see anyone else present, so he renders help. Now, the question is about the bystander effect and which option would change his reaction.

Bystander effect, right. I remember that the bystander effect is a psychological phenomenon where people are less likely to help someone in need if they observe another person nearby helping. So, the key here is how the bystander's presence affects the reaction.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one would influence the pedestrian to react differently. Let's break down each option.

Option A: Security camera on the street. I don't think cameras influence people's behavior unless it somehow increases the perceived threat. But since the pedestrian is trying to help, maybe the camera doesn't help much. Probably not the answer.

Option B: One other person approaching. If another person is nearby, maybe he thinks the stranger is a threat. But the pedestrian is a bystander and is already helping. The presence of someone else might make him more cautious, but does it change his reaction? Or perhaps it makes him more inclined to help. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: The stranger appears poorer. If the stranger is of a lower socioeconomic class, he might be less likely to act as a bystander. Instead, he might help, or the pedestrian might see him as a threat. Wait, but the scenario says the pedestrian is rendering aid because he didn't see anyone else. So if the stranger is actually poorer, he would be more likely to act as a bystander. But in this question, the pedestrian has already rendered aid. So this might change his reaction by making him think he's in danger, hence more likely to help. But how does this affect his initial reaction? Or does this change his reaction in some way.

Option D: Large, intimidating dog. A dog can be a strong indicator of danger. If the dog is intimidating, maybe the pedestrian thinks it's a threat and would help more. But if the pedestrian is already attempting to help, maybe he's more cautious. Not sure, but this might influence his reaction.

Option E: The stranger is same ethnicity. Same ethnicity might make him more likely to act as a bystander. But in the scenario, the stranger is different, so maybe he would be more cautious. But the pedestrian is rendering help anyway, so perhaps this doesn't change his reaction much.

Option F: Stranger appears less wealthy. If he thinks he's much wealthier than he is, maybe he would help. So this would make him react more cautiously, but since he's rendering help, perhaps he's more likely to be cautious. But I'm not sure how this affects his reaction compared to when he was helping.

Option G: Stranger appears same gender. If he thinks he's not different, maybe he's more likely to act as a bystander. But in this case, he is helping, so perhaps this doesn't change his reaction.

Option H: Stranger appears same gender. Wait, same gender might confuse him. But the pedestrian is a male, and if the stranger appears same gender, maybe he perceives him as a threat. So this might make him more cautious.

Wait, but the question is which option would change his reaction. So the bystander effect is typically about people not seeing others nearby, so the pedestrian has to act without knowing.

Looking at each option, the bystander effect is about the perceived threat. The bystander effect is that when a bystander (like a person not seeing someone) finds out that someone else is in danger, they are more likely to help rather than run away.

So the bystander effect would lead the pedestrian to help more than usual. But the options are about what would change his reaction. So the question is, which option makes him react differently, i.e., more or less cautiously.

The question is phrased: "According to the bystander effect, which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts?" So the options are possible scenarios that might trigger the bystander effect.

Wait, actually, maybe the question is about whether the pedestrian would take more action. So the bystander effect isn't about the pedestrian's reaction to the stranger, but about the pedestrian's reaction to seeing a stranger in danger (even if he didn't see others).

Wait, but the question is about "which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts." So the options are scenarios that would influence the pedestrian's reaction.

Looking again, the options are about the stranger's appearance. Let me think.

The bystander effect is that if a person (the bystander) sees another person in danger (not seen by them), they are more likely to help.

In the original scenario, the pedestrian doesn't see others but renders aid. So the bystander effect is triggered when a nearby individual is in danger (from an unknown source).

So, the options are scenarios that would make the pedestrian more or less cautious.

Which option would make the pedestrian more likely to act as a bystander?

If the stranger is actually poorer (option C), then the pedestrian, seeing a stranger of lower socioeconomic class, might think he's in danger. Because a lower class person is more likely to be a threat.

But in the scenario, the pedestrian is already helping. So, if he's already making the decision to help, perhaps he's more cautious.

But the question is about which option would make him react differently, i.e., more or less cautiously.

Which option would make him more cautious? For example, if the stranger appears poorer (C), he might think he's in danger and help more. But in the question, the pedestrian is rendering aid, so perhaps he's already acting cautiously.

Wait, no. The bystander effect is when the bystander (the pedestrian) sees others nearby but hasn't seen the individual in need. So the bystander effect is when the bystander is aware that the person is in danger but hasn't seen them.

In this case, the pedestrian is the bystander. If the stranger is poorer, he might think he's in danger, so he would help more than usual.

But the question is, according to the bystander effect, which option would change how the pedestrian reacts. So the bystander effect is about the pedestrian's reaction to seeing another person in danger, not seeing the individual.

Wait, the bystander effect is about the individual seeing another person in danger. So, for example, if a person A is in danger and person B notices, he's more likely to act as a bystander.

In this problem, the pedestrian is the bystander. He notices a stranger in danger (he's rendering aid). The stranger is actually poorer.

So, what would change his reaction. If the stranger appears poorer (C), he might think he's in danger and help more. But in the scenario, he's rendering aid. So perhaps this makes him more cautious.

Wait, but the question is about the bystander effect. So the bystander effect is when the bystander is aware of others nearby but hasn't seen the individual in need.

In this case, the bystander is the pedestrian. So he notices the stranger in danger but hasn't seen them.

If the stranger appears poorer, he might think he's in danger and help more. But in the scenario, he's already helping. So maybe the bystander effect isn't triggered in the same way.

Wait, no. The bystander effect is triggered when the bystander sees the individual in danger. So if the pedestrian is seeing the stranger in danger, but the stranger is poorer, he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously. But in the scenario, he is already acting as a bystander.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The bystander effect is the psychological phenomenon that causes people to act more cautiously when they see others nearby, in danger, without themselves being present. The effect is strongest when there's an unknown threat nearby.

In this question, the pedestrian is making a decision to help because he's in the dark (no one else present), so he's acting as a bystander. But the bystander effect is about the pedestrian's reaction to seeing another person in danger.

The question is, which option would change his reaction. So, the pedestrian is making a decision because he's seeing someone in danger, but he's not seeing anyone else. So, the bystander effect would cause him to act more cautiously if he sees others nearby in danger.

But the options are about what the stranger would look like. So which scenario would make him more cautious.

Option C: Stranger appears poorer. So if he thinks he's in danger, he might help more, but in this scenario he's already rendering aid. So perhaps that doesn't change his reaction.

Alternatively, if the stranger is poorer (C), he might think he's in danger and help more, but he's already doing so, so perhaps he's more cautious.

Alternatively, if the stranger is more wealthy (A), he might think he's not in danger and not help, but he's already helping.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The bystander effect is when the bystander (the person) sees others nearby in danger and acts as a bystander. The effect is more pronounced if the bystander is aware of another person's danger.

In this scenario, the pedestrian is the bystander. He notices the stranger in danger (even though he's not seeing them) and decides to help. So, the bystander effect is in play.

The question is, which option would change his reaction? So which of the options would make the pedestrian more likely to act as a bystander.

Looking at the options:

C: Stranger appears poorer. If he thinks he's in danger, he would help more. But in the scenario, he's helping, so maybe he's already cautious.

Wait, but the question is about what would change his reaction. So the bystander effect is when he sees others nearby in danger. So the bystander effect is triggered when he sees others in danger.

In the scenario, he's not seeing others, but he's seeing someone in danger. So the bystander effect is in place, but the effect is about his reaction to seeing someone else in danger.

The options don't include whether he's seeing someone else, but in this case, the pedestrian is the bystander. So, which option would influence his reaction.

If the stranger is poorer (C), he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously. Wait, but in the scenario, he's rendering aid. So perhaps he's already cautious, and seeing someone poorer doesn't change that.

Wait, but if the stranger is poorer, he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously. So he would help more than usual, but in the scenario, he's doing so. So this might not change his reaction.

Alternatively, if the stranger is the same ethnicity (G), he might act as a bystander. But in the scenario, the stranger is different, so maybe he's more cautious.

I'm getting stuck. Let's think about each option.

The bystander effect's strength is when the bystander is aware of someone else in danger. The effect is strongest when the bystander can see the other person in danger.

In this scenario, the pedestrian is the bystander. He's seeing someone in danger (different ethnicity), so the bystander effect is in effect.

Now, the options are about the stranger's appearance.

Option C: The stranger appears poorer. If he's poorer, he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously. But in the scenario, the pedestrian is rendering aid, so he's already acting as a bystander.

Wait, perhaps the bystander effect is about the pedestrian's reaction. If the pedestrian sees someone poorer in danger, he might think he's in danger and help more. But in this case, he isn't. So this doesn't change his reaction.

Option D: Large, intimidating dog. If the dog is intimidating, he might make the pedestrian think he's a threat, thus helping more. So this would make the pedestrian act more cautiously because he thinks the dog is a threat. But in the scenario, the pedestrian is already helping. So this might make him more cautious.

Wait, but the question is about what would change his reaction. So if the dog is intimidating, the pedestrian would think he's in danger and help more. But in this case, he's already helping, so perhaps his reaction is already more cautious.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the bystander effect being a real phenomenon. So, the bystander effect would lead him to act more cautiously, regardless of the scenario.

So the bystander effect is the effect that would cause him to act more cautiously, regardless of the scenario. But the options are about the stranger's appearance.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as, which of the following would change his reaction, meaning that the change occurs because the stranger's appearance is different.

The bystander effect is when the bystander (the pedestrian) is aware of another person in danger and acts as a bystander. So if the stranger is poorer (C), he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously, which would change his reaction.

In the scenario, the pedestrian is already acting as a bystander, so this change might make him act even more cautiously.

But the options are about what would make him react differently, not whether he would. So, if the stranger is poorer, he might think he's in danger and help more, but in the scenario, he's rendering aid. So perhaps this doesn't affect his reaction as much.

Alternatively, maybe the bystander effect is about the pedestrian seeing someone in danger, and the stranger's appearance affects his reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because if the stranger is poorer, he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously, which would change his reaction.

But in the scenario, he's already helping, so maybe his reaction is already more cautious.

Alternatively, the bystander effect is about the pedestrian seeing another person in danger. So, if the stranger is poorer (C), he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously, which would make him react differently.

So, the bystander effect is when the pedestrian sees someone in danger. So, if the stranger is poorer (C), he might think he's in danger and act more cautiously, which would change his reaction.

So the correct answer would be option C.

The bystander effect occurs when a person (the bystander) acts as a non-adverse agent in the face of an unknown threat, even if they are not in the immediate danger themselves. In this scenario, the pedestrian, seeing a stranger in danger (different ethnicity) and no one else present, renders aid, which aligns with the bystander effect. The question asks which option would change the pedestrian's reaction according to the bystander effect.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Security camera on the street**  
  A security camera does not influence the pedestrian's reaction to a stranger in danger. It does not trigger the bystander effect. This option does not change the pedestrian's reaction.

- **B: Another person approaching the girl**  
  While approaching individuals nearby could influence the pedestrian's reaction, the question specifies that the pedestrian is rendering aid because he is seeing someone else present (no one else present). This option does not directly impact the bystander effect in this context.

- **C: The stranger appearing poorer**  
  If the stranger is perceived as poorer, the pedestrian might act more cautiously, thinking they are in danger. This would change the pedestrian's reaction, as they would act as a bystander more frequently. This option aligns with the bystander effect, where the pedestrian's awareness of someone in danger increases their reaction to help.

- **D: A large, intimidating dog**  
  A dog could make the pedestrian more cautious, thinking they are a threat. However, in the scenario, the pedestrian is rendering aid, so this does not directly change the reaction in the described manner.

- **E: Same ethnicity**  
  Same ethnicity might make the pedestrian more cautious, but the stranger is different, so this does not apply.

- **F: Stranger appearing less wealthy**  
  Similar to option C, if the stranger appears less wealthy, the pedestrian might act more cautiously, changing their reaction. This option is relevant to the bystander effect.

- **G: Stranger appearing same gender**  
  Same gender might make the pedestrian more cautious, but the stranger is different, so this does not apply.

- **H: Stranger appearing older**  
  Age might influence perception, but the question does not mention age as a factor, so this option is irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
Option **C** (the stranger appearing poorer) directly affects the bystander effect by making the pedestrian more cautious, thus changing their reaction. Similarly, option **F** (stranger appearing less wealthy) also aligns with the bystander effect. However, the correct answer is **C**, as it directly illustrates the impact of perceived wealth on the pedestrian's reaction to the stranger.
