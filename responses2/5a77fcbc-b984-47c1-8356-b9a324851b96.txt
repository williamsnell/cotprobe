Question:

Jimmy and Kima are going on a trip. They will drive for three days. The first day they will drive 182 miles. The second day they will drive 439 miles. The third day they will drive 217 miles. Which expression is the closest estimate of how many miles Jimmy and Kima will drive on their trip?

Options:

A: 180 + 440 + 220
B: 200 + 450 + 250
C: 150 + 450 + 250
D: 200 + 500 + 200
E: 150 + 400 + 250
F: 190 + 430 + 210
G: 200 + 400 + 200
H: 150 + 400 + 200
I: 200 + 400 + 250
J: 200 + 450 + 200

Okay, so I have this problem where Jimmy and Kima are going on a three-day trip. Each day they drive a certain number of miles, and I need to find the closest estimate of the total miles they'll drive. There are several options given, all of which are different ways of adding up the miles for each day. 

First, let me look at the actual numbers. On day one, they drive 182 miles. Day two is 439, and day three is 217. So the exact total would be 182 plus 439 plus 217. Let me calculate that real quick. 182 plus 439 is 621, and 621 plus 217 is 838 miles total.

Now, the question is about estimating the sum, and we need to pick the option that's the closest to 838. The options provided are A through J, each combining three numbers, probably rounded. So I need to analyze each option and see how close their sum is to 838.

Let me list the options again:

A: 180 + 440 + 220
B: 200 + 450 + 250
C: 150 + 450 + 250
D: 200 + 500 + 200
E: 150 + 400 + 250
F: 190 + 430 + 210
G: 200 + 400 + 200
H: 150 + 400 + 200
I: 200 + 400 + 250
J: 200 + 450 + 200

I think the best approach is to calculate each option's sum and see which one is closest to 838. But maybe I can also quickly estimate each to see which is closest.

Let me start with option A. 180 + 440 = 620, plus 220 is 840. Hmm, that's 840. Our exact total is 838, so A is 2 more. That's pretty close.

Option B: 200 + 450 is 650, plus 250 is 900. That's way higher than 838, so B is too big.

Option C: 150 + 450 is 600, plus 250 is 850. That's 12 more than 838. So C is off by 12.

Option D: 200 + 500 is 700, plus 200 is 900. Again, higher than 838.

Option E: 150 + 400 is 550, plus 250 is 800. That's 38 less than 838.

Option F: 190 + 430 is 620, plus 210 is 830. Oh wait, 830 is pretty close to 838. That's only 8 miles off.

Wait, let me double-check that. 190 +430=620, plus 210: 620+210=830. Yes, that's correct.

Option G: 200 +400 is 600, plus 200 is 800. That's 38 less than 838.

Option H: 150 +400=550, plus200=750. 750 is 88 less than 838.

Option I: 200 +400=600, plus250=850. That's 12 more than 838.

Option J: 200 +450=650, plus200=850. Also 12 more.

So, the options' sums are:

A: 840
B:900
C:850
D:900
E:800
F:830
G:800
H:750
I:850
J:850

The exact sum is 838. So which of these is closest?

Looking at each:

A: 840 is 2 away.

F:830 is 8 away.

Others are further away.

So the closest is option F, which totals 830. The difference is 838 -830=8.

Wait, but another option could be F:830. So which option is correct? Because option F is 190 +430 +210=830.

So the closest is F.

But wait, looking at the options again, the question says "closest estimate of how many miles...". So 830 is very close to 838, only 8 miles difference. That's the closest.

So the correct option is F: 190 +430 +210.

Alternatively, looking at other options, option F is the closest to the exact sum.

So the answer should be option F.

The correct answer is F: 190 + 430 + 210, as it totals 830, which is the closest to the actual sum of 838 miles.

Answer: F
