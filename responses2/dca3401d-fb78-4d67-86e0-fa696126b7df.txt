Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the uncertainty in the z-component of the angular momentum for a 2p_z hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, there's the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which relates the uncertainties in different observables. Oh wait, right, the principle says that the product of the uncertainty in an observable and the uncertainty in another complementary observable can't be less than a certain value, usually h-bar over 2.

But wait, what observables are we talking about here? The problem is about ΔL_z, which is the uncertainty in the z-component of angular momentum. Oh right, in the hydrogen atom, the angular momentum operators are L_x, L_y, and L_z. And the uncertainty is for L_z specifically. So I think the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for angular momentum would involve L_x and L_z, or something like that.

I remember that the angular momentum operators satisfy [L_i, L_j] = iħ ε_ijk L_k, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. But how does that tie into uncertainty? Oh wait, the uncertainty principle for angular momentum is given by ΔL_i ΔL_j ≥ (ħ/2) |ε_ij k| ), but I'm not sure if I'm getting that right. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to the Heisenberg uncertainty for position and momentum, which is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2.

Wait, for the z-component, perhaps the uncertainty in L_z is related to the uncertainty in the angular momentum in the other directions. Let me think. For the hydrogen atom, the state in question is 2p_z, which means it's in the p orbital along the z-axis. The angular momentum quantum number is l=1 because p is l=1. 

The possible values of m_l (the magnetic quantum number) are -1, 0, +1. For a 2p_z state, m_l is 0. So the state is spherically symmetric in the azimuthal angles, but has a definite m_l of 0.

But wait, the uncertainty principle for angular momentum comes into play when you have an eigenstate. Because for an eigenstate of L_z, the uncertainty in L_z should be zero. Because L_z would be exactly known. Wait, no, because if the state is an eigenstate of L_z, then the uncertainty in L_z is zero. Because the state is perfectly defined in the z-direction.

Wait, but another perspective: if the state is an eigenstate of L_z, then the uncertainty in L_z is zero, right? Because ΔL_z = 0. Wait, that makes sense because L_z has a definite value. Because the state is |l, m_l> = |1,0>, which is an eigenstate of L_z. So the uncertainty in L_z would be zero, meaning ΔL_z = 0. 

So looking at the options, the correct answer must be G: 0.

But wait, wait! Are there any other factors here? Because the state is a hydrogen atom's state, but is it just an eigenstate of L_z? Or does the presence of other quantum numbers affect this? Oh wait, no. The 2p_z state is a specific state with definite l and m_l. So in that state, the uncertainty in L_z is zero because the operator L_z has a definite value. So the uncertainty is zero. 

So the correct answer is G: 0.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta L_z$ for the hydrogen-atom stationary state $2p_z$, we start by recalling the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties of two complementary observables cannot be less than $\hbar/2$. However, for the $2p_z$ state, the angular momentum quantum number $l = 1$, and the magnetic quantum number $m_l = 0$. 

The $2p_z$ state is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator, meaning that the angular momentum in the $z$-direction is perfectly known. For eigenstates of an operator, the uncertainty in that operator is zero. Therefore, $\Delta L_z = 0$ for the $2p_z$ state.

Among the given options, the correct answer is:
