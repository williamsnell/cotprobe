Okay, so I've got this question about when early email was developed. The options are from the 1900s to the 2000s, each in their respective decades. I need to figure out which decade was the earliest one where email was first created.

Hmm, I remember that the concept of email as we know it today didn't exist until the 1960s. But wait, when exactly? Let me think. I think it was in the 1970s, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh, right! The first major email systems started to take shape in the 1960s. I remember something about the development of the Word Processing System around that time. Maybe around 1969? That would be the 1960s. So the first email probably happened in the 1960s.

Looking at the options, option E is 1960s, which includes 1960, 1961, up to 1969. The other options are earlier decades, like 1900s, 1920s, etc. But the earliest email was in the 1960s. So the answer should be E.
