Okay, so I've got this question about Ace Co. issuing shares, and I need to figure out how to report it in their statement of cash flows. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says Ace Co. issued 1000 shares with a $10 par value and sold them for $15 each. So, the cash received is 1000 times $15, which is $15,000. Right, that's straightforward.

Now, I remember that the statement of cash flows has three main sections: operating, investing, and financing activities. Each section shows how cash flows from those activities affect the company's cash position.

The key here is whether the transaction is a financing activity, investing, or operating. Since Ace received cash from selling shares, that's a source of cash, which affects financing activities. I think financing activities involve transactions that change the size and composition of shareholders' equity or cash reserves.

Looking at the options, option C says $15,000 cash inflow from financing activities. That sounds right because the sale is a financing activityâ€”issuing shares is part of financing.

Option B says it's from financing and investing. No, because it's not an investment. Investing usually refers to buying or selling assets like equipment or property, so selling shares doesn't fit here.

Option A is about operating activities. No, because it's a cash inflow from financing.

Option D says no impact because it's non-cash. No, non-cash transactions like issuing shares do affect cash, so D is incorrect.

Option E is about investing, which it's not. So E is wrong.

Option F says $10,000 for financing and $5,000 for operating, which doesn't make sense. The cash flow is only $15k, all from financing.

Option G talks about investing and adjusting operating. Again, not relevant here.

Option H is about financing and adjusting operating. No, same reason as F.

Option I is about investing and adjusting financing. Also incorrect.

Option J is financing and adjusting operating. No, same issue.

So the correct answer is C. Option C states that the $15,000 is from financing activities. So Ace's statement of cash flows will show an inflow of $15,000 under financing activities, with no impact on operating or investing activities.

The correct answer is **C: $15,000 cash inflow from financing activities.**

Ace Co. received $15,000 in cash from issuing shares, which is a financing activity. This transaction is reported as an inflow in the financing activities section.
