Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic waves and melting ice. Hmm, I remember something about the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the energy radiated by a body to its temperature. Let me think.

The question says that the energy from electromagnetic waves in a cavity is used to melt ice. And then, when the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the mass of ice melted increases by a certain factor. We need to find that factor.

Wait, the problem states when it's increased by a factor of two. So the Kelvin temp goes from T to 2T. And the mass of ice melted increases by a factor. So the initial situation is heating some ice, and the new situation is heating more ice because the energy is more.

So the energy depends on the Stefan-Boltzmann law: the power radiated is proportional to T^4. Right, the formula is P = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

If the temperature doubles, T becomes 2T. So the power would be (2T)^4 = 16 T^4. So the power increases by a factor of 16.

Now, the energy per unit time is the power. The energy used to melt ice would be the latent heat times the mass. So the energy E = mL, where m is mass, L is latent heat.

Wait, but both the energy and the power change. Let's think: when the temperature increases, the power increases, so more energy is available to melt the ice. But the amount of ice melted depends on how much energy you have. But the question says the mass increases by a certain factor.

Wait, maybe I should model it. Let's assume that the initial situation has a temperature T, so power P1 = σ T^4. The energy per unit time is P1 = σ T^4. 

Now, the rate of energy transfer is P = dE/dt = σ T^4.

The energy required to melt m kg of ice is E = mL, where L is the latent heat of fusion for water. So:

σ T^4 = (L) * (dmelt/dt) * t

Wait, no, because we're heating a fixed amount of ice. Wait, but the time here is a fixed amount, so the power times time gives the energy. Since the time is fixed, the energy is proportional to P and inversely proportional to the latent heat.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy per unit mass. Let me think: the energy used to melt a mass m is E = mL. The power is P = σ T^4. So the time t to melt m kg is t = E/P = (mL)/(σ T^4). 

But if the temperature increases by factor 2, the new temp is 2T, so the new power is P2 = σ (2T)^4 = 16 σ T^4. 

The energy to melt the new mass m' is E' = m' L. The time to melt it is t = E'/P2 = (m' L)/(16 σ T^4).

But I'm not sure if the time is the same. Wait, the problem says the time is a fixed amount. So in the initial case, the energy used is E1 = m1 L = σ T^4 * t. In the new case, the energy is E2 = m2 L = 16 σ T^4 * t. Wait, no—because if the time t is fixed, then E is P*t, and P is 16 when T is doubled. So E2 = 16 E1. But E2 is m2 L. So m2 = (E2 / L) = 16 E1 / L = 16 m1.

Wait that would imply that the mass increases by 16, but that's not one of the options, wait. The options are A to J, and I'm looking for which option the mass increases by.

Wait, the options include 16 as option I. But wait, let me check again. Oh wait, wait. Suppose you're increasing the temperature. So the power (energy per unit time) increases by 16 times. But the heating is done over a fixed time t. So the total energy becomes 16 times the original. Since the latent heat is the same (assuming same amount of ice melted), the mass should increase by 16 times. So the new mass is 16 times the original. So the factor is 16, so the answer would be I, which is option I:64? No, wait, no. The original is m, new is 16 m. So the factor is 16. Looking for the option where the factor is 16. Let me check the options:

A:3, B:4, C:1, D:32, E:8, F:0.5, G:1.5, H:2, I:64, J:16.

Wait, the options are A through J. So I is 64, J is16. So if the mass increases by 16, the factor is 16, which is option J. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting the factors wrong. Let's think again. The initial power is P = σ T^4. When T doubles, P becomes 16 P. So if the same time is used, you get 16 P * t = 16 P_initial * t. So the energy used is 16 times the original energy. Since the energy to melt m is m L, the new mass m' would be (16 P_initial * t ) / L = 16 (P_initial t / L ) = 16 m_initial. So the mass increases by a factor of 16. So the factor is 16, which is option J:16.

But wait, wait a second. Did the question say the time is fixed? So in the original situation, for a given time t, the energy is E = σ T^4 t. In the new situation, E' = σ (2T)^4 t = 16 σ T^4 t = 16 E. The latent heat is the same, so m' = E' / L = 16 E / L =16 m. So the factor is 16. So the correct option is J.

The problem involves understanding how the energy radiated by electromagnetic waves in a cavity relates to the melting of ice. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the power radiated by a body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature: \( P = \sigma T^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. When the temperature \( T \) is doubled, the power becomes \( P' = \sigma (2T)^4 = 16 \sigma T^4 \), an increase of a factor of 16.

The energy required to melt a mass \( m \) of ice is \( E = mL \), where \( L \) is the latent heat of fusion for water. If the temperature increases, the power increases, allowing more energy to be used to melt ice. Assuming the time \( t \) is fixed, the energy available to melt ice increases by a factor of 16. Since the latent heat \( L \) is constant, the mass of ice melted also increases by a factor of 16.

Among the options provided, the factor corresponding to an increase of 16 is option J. Therefore, the correct answer is:
