Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about genetic variation and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that genetic variation refers to differences in genes within a population. This can be due to various factors like mutation, genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow. The question asks which of the statements (A to J) is true.

Looking at the options:

A: It is created by the direct action of natural selection.
Hmm, natural selection is about survival and reproduction, so it's not about creating variation. I'd think A is false.

B: It tends to be reduced by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes.
Wait, diploid organisms produce gametes, but that doesn't necessarily reduce variation. In fact, I remember that when organisms reproduce, they can pass on multiple copies of a gene. For example, a diploid organism has two copies, so when it reproduces, each gamete can inherit both copies. So gamete formation itself doesn't reduce genetic variation. So B might be incorrect.

C: It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.
Wait, natural selection acts on existing variation. So before selection, variation exists. So C is probably wrong because it's saying it must be present before, which it isn't. Like, variation is already present before selection.

D: It is always increased by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes.
No, I think when diploid organisms produce gametes, it's about the number of copies. For example, a diploid organism (say, humans) produces gametes with a single copy (sperm) or one (egg). This can lead to variation in the gametes (like different allele combinations). But does this always increase the variation? I'm not sure. Maybe diploids produce gametes that can lead to more variation because each gamete has one allele, so when they mate, the offspring get one allele each. So gamete production can lead to variation, but does it always increase it? I'm not certain. Maybe D is not right.

E: It is not affected by the environmental changes.
No, environmental factors do affect genetic variation. Like, natural selection can act on variation influenced by environment, so environmental changes do affect variation.

F: It can only be created by artificial selection.
No, natural selection is a natural process, not artificial. So F is incorrect.

G: It is only present in a population after natural selection has acted upon the population.
Wait, natural selection affects variation by increasing the chances of certain alleles passing on. But variation can exist before selection (like in a population) and then selection acts on it. So G says it's only present after selection, which might not be true. For example, mutation can cause new variation, which can then be selected for. So G is probably wrong.

H: It arises independently of changes in the environment.
Wait, natural selection is a process that is influenced by environmental factors. So if a population has variation, selection can act on it, but the variation itself (the allele differences) can be influenced by the environment. So H is saying variation arises without environment, which is incorrect.

I: It is always reduced by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes.
Wait, if diploids produce gametes with one allele each, then when they mate, the offspring can have a mix of alleles. This process (meiosis) can lead to variation. So producing gametes doesn't reduce variation; it actually allows variation to persist (like in diploid organisms, each gamete is a different variant, which can lead to more diversity when the gametes combine).

J: It arises in response to changes in the environment.
Yes, that sounds right. Genetic variation can be influenced by environmental factors. For example, certain traits may be selected for or against based on environmental conditions. So J is a true statement.

Wait, but let me go back through the options. The correct answer options are A to J, and the question is which is the true statement.

So let's go through each option again more carefully.

Looking for which statement is true.

Option E: It is not affected by the environmental changes. No, environmental changes do affect variation, so E is false.

Option J: It arises in response to changes in the environment. That sounds correct. Because variation is often a result of environmental pressures. Like, certain traits may be favored, leading to variation that adapts to the environment.

So J is a true statement.

Let me check other options for any that could be true.

Option B: It tends to be reduced by the processes when diploid produces gametes. That doesn't make sense because when diploid organisms produce gametes, it's the gametes that may carry different alleles, but the variation (like allele differences) can be maintained. So B is wrong.

Option F: It can only be created by artificial selection. No, natural selection can create variation, so F is wrong.

Option G: It's only present after selection. No, variation can exist before selection, like through mutations. So G is false.

Option A: Natural selection is about survival and reproduction, not about creating variation. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Before natural selection, variation exists. So C is incorrect because it suggests it must be present before, which isn't the case.

So the only correct statement is J.

To determine which statement is true concerning genetic variation, let's analyze each option:

- **A**: Incorrect. Natural selection does not directly create genetic variation; it influences survival and reproduction based on existing variation.
- **B**: Incorrect. While diploid organisms produce gametes, this process does not reduce genetic variation; it allows for the inheritance of varying alleles, maintaining variation in a population.
- **C**: Incorrect. Natural selection acts on existing genetic variation, not requiring it to be present beforehand.
- **D**: Incorrect. While diploid organisms produce gametes, this process can lead to variation in offspring, but it does not always increase genetic variation.
- **E**: Incorrect. Environmental changes do affect genetic variation, as selection can act on traits influenced by the environment.
- **F**: Incorrect. Genetic variation can arise independently of environmental changes, as natural selection often acts on environmental influences.
- **G**: Incorrect. Genetic variation can exist and persist before natural selection acts upon it, especially through mutation.
- **H**: Incorrect. Natural selection is influenced by environmental factors, so variation does not arise independently of environment.
- **J**: Correct. Genetic variation is often a response to environmental changes, as environmental factors can favor or select certain traits.
- **I**: Incorrect. While natural selection can influence variation, the process of gamete production does not reduce variation; it allows for the maintenance of variation by producing gametes with different allele combinations.

The only true statement is **J**: "It arises in response to changes in the environment."

**ANSWER: J**
