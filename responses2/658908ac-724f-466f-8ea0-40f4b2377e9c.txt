Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about DNA, mRNA, tRNA, and codons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the DNA sequence is 5′-C-A-T-3′. Wait, DNA is double-stranded, right? So the complementary strand would be 3′-T-G-C-5′, because in DNA, the base pairing is C with G, A with T, and T with A. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, in DNA, the pairing is C-T and A-A, etc. So the DNA is 5' C A T 3', so the complementary strand would run 3' T G C 5'. Because DNA is read 5' to 3', and the mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand.

Wait, wait—mRNA is synthesized from the DNA's template strand. So the DNA sequence is 5' C A T 3', which would have a complementary mRNA strand of 3' T A G 5'. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. DNA is double-stranded. The DNA is 5' [complement strand] 3'. But mRNA is synthesized from the complementary strand's 5' to 3' direction. So, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand. So for the given DNA 5' C A T 3', the complementary mRNA would be 5' T A G 3', because mRNA is transcribed from the DNA's template strand, which for DNA is the same as the mRNA's 5' to 3' direction. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the mRNA is made from the DNA's template strand, so the mRNA is the same as the DNA's non-template strand, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, the DNA is 5' C A T 3'. The complementary (non-template) strand would be 3' T G C 5'. So the mRNA is made by reading this non-template strand in 5' to 3' direction, right? So the mRNA would be 5' T A G 3'? Wait, no, wait. Wait, DNA is double-stranded. The two strands are antiparallel. So the given DNA is 5' C A T 3' (top strand), so the bottom strand (complementary) would be 3' T G C 5'. Then, the mRNA is made from the top strand, because mRNA is synthesized from the template (which is the DNA's non-template strand). So the mRNA is 5' T A G 3'. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I might be getting this confused. Let's think again: the DNA is double-stranded, with two strands antiparallel. In the given DNA, the 5' is C A T and the 3' is the complementary. The mRNA is made from the template strand, so the mRNA is complementary to the DNA's 3' end. Because the template strand is the 3' end of the DNA, and the mRNA is built from the DNA's template strand (which is the same as the mRNA's 5' to 3' direction).

So the DNA's 5' end is C A T 3', so the template strand is the same as the top strand, which is 5' C A T 3'. Wait, no, the DNA is double-stranded, so the DNA's 5' is C A T 3', which would have the complementary strand as 3' T G C 5' (because C pairs with T, A pairs with G, T pairs with A). So the mRNA is made from the template (the DNA's 5' end) which is 5' C A T 3'. So the mRNA would be 5' T A G 3'? Because mRNA is written in the 5' to 3' direction, so the mRNA sequence is T A G.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the mRNA is synthesized complementary to the DNA's template strand. So the mRNA would be the same as the DNA's non-template strand, but in reverse. So the DNA's non-template is 3' T G C 5'. So the mRNA, which reads this in 5' to 3' would be 5' T A G 3'.

Wait, now the question says "mRNA with a complementary codon is transcribed from the DNA in the process of protein synthesis." Oh wait, I think I might have gotten this part wrong. Because the mRNA is already the complementary to the template strand, so the codon is the same as the DNA's codon but with T replaced by U. Because DNA uses T, mRNA uses U.

Wait, but the question is about the tRNA pairing with mRNA. So the tRNA has an anticodon that pairs with the mRNA codon. So the mRNA's codon is U A G? Wait, no. Wait, the mRNA would be T A G, correct? Because the DNA's template is C A T (5' end), so the mRNA is complementary, so T A G (5' to 3').

So the mRNA's codon is T A G. Then, the tRNA would pair with this codon. So the tRNA's anticodon is the complementary of the mRNA codon, but read in the same direction as the mRNA.

Wait, the mRNA codon is 5' T A G 3'. The tRNA anticodon is the same as the mRNA codon, but with T replaced by U. So the anticodon would be 5' U A G 3'.

Wait, but wait. The tRNA is part of the ribosome, and the anticodon is the sequence on the tRNA that pairs with the amino acid in the mRNA. Oh I think I'm mixing up things. The mRNA codon is 5' T A G 3', so the anticodon would be 3' U A G 5', because the tRNA's anticodon pairs with the mRNA's codon in the same reading frame, but in reverse. Wait, no. The tRNA's anticodon is complementary to the mRNA's codon.

Wait, the mRNA's codon is 5' T A G 3'. The tRNA's anticodon would therefore be 3' U A G 5', because the tRNA's anticodon is the complement of the mRNA codon but in reverse complement. Wait, perhaps I should think about the pairing.

Wait, when the tRNA is reading the mRNA, the anticodon is the sequence that the tRNA has on its anticodon that pairs with the mRNA's codon. The tRNA's anticodon pairs with the mRNA's codon in the same reading frame.

So the mRNA codon is 5' T A G 3'. The tRNA's anticodon would be complementary to this, but in the same reading frame, but in the opposite direction, because the tRNA's anticodon is the "sequence" that pairs with the mRNA.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the tRNA's anticodon structure. The tRNA has a 5' to 3' sequence. The mRNA is also read 5' to 3', but the tRNA's anticodon is the sequence that pairs with the mRNA's codon. So for the mRNA codon U A G (if the mRNA is T A G), the tRNA's anticodon would be 5' U A G 3' — but wait, because the tRNA has an anticodon that is the complement of the mRNA's codon. Or is it the reverse?

Wait, for each amino acid, the codon is the sequence on the mRNA, and the tRNA's anticodon is the reverse complement of that codon. Because the tRNA is reading the mRNA in the same order as the codon. So if the mRNA codon is T A G, the tRNA's anticodon would be 3' U A G 5'. Because the tRNA's anticodon is the same as the mRNA codon but in reverse order, and the T is replaced by U.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it as the tRNA's anticodon is the reverse complement of the mRNA codon.

So for mRNA codon 5' T A G 3', the tRNA anticodon would be 5' U A G 3' — no, wait, because the tRNA's anticodon is complementary. So wait, wait: The tRNA's anticodon is the same as the mRNA's codon, but with T replaced by U. Then, the tRNA's anticodon would be the reverse complement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon as being reverse complements.

The mRNA codon is 5' T A G 3'. The reverse would be 3' G A T 5', and the complement would be 5' C G U 3'. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, but the options given—let me look at the options. The options are all in 5' to 3' form.

Looking at option B: 5' U G C 3'.

Option F: 5' C A U 3'.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the mRNA codon is. The DNA is 5' C A T 3', so the complementary DNA strand (non-template) is 3' T G C 5'. So the mRNA is synthesized from this, so the mRNA is 5' T A G 3'. So the mRNA codon is T A G.

The tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon. So the anticodon is complementary to the codon. The mRNA codon is T A G.

The complementary sequence would be U G C. But the tRNA anticodon is read in the same reading frame, but in reverse direction as the mRNA's codon.

Wait, no, tRNA anticodon is the sequence that pairs with the mRNA codon in the same reading frame. So, the mRNA codon is T A G. The tRNA anticodon is the reverse complement of this. So the reverse of T A G is G A T, and the complement of that is C G U. But looking at the options, none of them have C G U as an option.

Wait, but let me think again. The mRNA codon is T A G, which is 5' T A G 3'. The tRNA anticodon is complementary to this codon, but in the same reading frame but in reverse.

Wait, the tRNA's anticodon is the reverse complement. So for mRNA codon 5' T A G 3', the anticodon is 3' G C U 5', which in 5' form is 5' U G C 3'.

Wait, but that would be option B: 5' U G C 3'.

Wait, because the mRNA's codon is T A G, so the anticodon (on the tRNA) is U G C. But wait, the tRNA is made from the mRNA's coding sequence.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it another way. The mRNA codon is T A G. The tRNA anticodon is complementary to this, so it's U G C. But the tRNA's anticodon is in the opposite reading frame, so it's 5' U G C 3'?

Wait, because tRNA anticodon is complementary to the mRNA, which is 5' T A G 3', so the tRNA's anticodon is 5' U G C 3'. Which is option B.

Wait, but another thought—amino acids are read in the same reading frame as the mRNA. So the mRNA's codon is T A G, which is methionine. The tRNA must have an anticodon that pairs with this.

So the tRNA's anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon, in the same reading frame. So mRNA T A G → anticodon would be U G C. But the anticodon is 5' → so 5' U G C 3'—which is option B.

But wait, the question says the mRNA is transcribed from the DNA. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the DNA's complementary strand with the mRNA. Because the DNA's complementary strand is 3' T G C 5', so the mRNA is the same as this, 5' T A G 3'.

So the mRNA codon is T A G. The tRNA anticodon would pair with this—so the anticodon is 5' U G C 3' — option B.

Wait, but the options include option B: 5' U G C 3'.

But wait, the question says a tRNA pairs with the mRNA codon. So the question is, in the process of protein synthesis, the mRNA is made, and the tRNA carries the amino acid.

So if the mRNA codon is T A G, the tRNA's anticodon is U G C, but wait, but the tRNA's anticodon is 5' U G C 3' as in option B.

But wait, the options list option B as 5' U G C 3'. So that would be correct.

Wait, but wait a minute—wait, no. Because DNA's template strand is 3' T G C 5', so the mRNA is 5' T A G 3'. The mRNA codon is T A G. So the tRNA's anticodon is the reverse complement of the codon. Because the tRNA is reading the mRNA in the same order. So the codon is 5' T A G 3', the anticodon is 3' U G C 5' → but written as 5' U G C 3'.

So the correct anticodon is 5' U G C 3' → which is option B.

Wait, but let's see the options. Option B is 5' U G C 3'. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the options also have other possibilities. For example, option F is 5' C A U 3', which would correspond to the mRNA codon U G C. No, that's not the case.

Wait, no. The mRNA codon is T A G, so the tRNA anticodon is U G C. So option B is correct.

The question involves determining the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon that pairs with the mRNA codon during protein synthesis. The DNA sequence provided is 5′-C-A-T-3′, which is the non-template (top) strand of the DNA double helix. The complementary DNA strand (3′-T-G-C-5′) is the template strand. mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, so the mRNA codon is complementary to the template strand, resulting in the sequence 5′-T-A-G-3′.

To find the tRNA anticodon, it must pair with the mRNA codon. The tRNA anticodon is the reverse complement of the mRNA codon. For the mRNA codon T-A-G (5′-T-A-G-3′), the reverse complement is 5′-U-G-C-3′. This is because the tRNA anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon and is read in the same reading frame as the mRNA.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (5′-U-A-C-3′):** Incorrect, as it does not match the reverse complement of the mRNA codon.
- **Option B (5′-U-G-C-3′):** Correct, as it matches the reverse complement of the mRNA codon T-A-G.
- **Option C (5′-U-C-G-3′):** Incorrect, as it does not match the reverse complement.
- **Option D (5′-G-T-A-3′):** Incorrect, as it does not match the reverse complement.
- **Option E (5′-G-U-A-3′):** Incorrect, as it does not match the reverse complement.
- **Option F (5′-C-A-U-3′):** Incorrect, as it does not match the reverse complement.
- **Option G (5′-T-A-G-3′):** Incorrect, as it corresponds to the mRNA codon, not the anticodon.
- **Options H, I, J:** Incorrect, as they do not match the reverse complement of the mRNA codon.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B (5′-U-G-C-3′)**, as it is the reverse complement of the mRNA codon T-A-G.
