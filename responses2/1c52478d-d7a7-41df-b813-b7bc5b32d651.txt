Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly describes accruals and deferrals in accounting. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I remember that accrual accounting is about recognizing revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred, not when they are paid or received. So that would relate to when cash is received or paid. On the other hand, deferrals are about when the obligation is for payment, even if cash isn't received yet. So deferrals are about anticipating future cash flows.

Looking at the options, let's break them down.

Option A says accruals are current cash receipts and deferrals expected future. Hmm, that doesn't sound right because I think accruals are about when they're earned, not when they're received. Wait, actually, I might have that mixed up. Let me think again. When you accrue something, you record it when it's earned, not when it's paid. So accruals would relate to future cash receipts. Deferrals are about when you have to pay, even if you haven't received cash yet. So option B says accruals are expected future cash receipts, which makes sense because they happen when the event is recorded. Deferrals are current cash receipts, which doesn't make sense because deferrals are about future obligations.

Option B: Accruals are expected future cash receipts (so when they are earned), deferrals are current (when they are paid). That seems correct.

Option E says both are concerned with past and future receipts. No, because deferrals are about future payments, not past.

Option H says accruals are expected future receipts, deferrals are past. Wait, no, deferrals are about future. So H is wrong.

Option G says accruals are past and deferrals are future. No, because deferrals are about future obligations, not past.

Option B seems correct. Let me double-check. 

Wait, another way: Accruals are about when the transaction is earned, so future cash receipts. Deferrals are about when the obligation is created, so future cash payments. So B is correct.

The correct answer is **B**. Accruals are concerned with expected future cash receipts, while deferrals are concerned with current cash receipts. This aligns with the principles of accrual accounting where revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, not when cash is received or paid.

**Answer: B**
