Alright, so I've got this question about why air feels cold when it's let out of an automobile tire. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, let's start by considering what happens when you take a breath out of a tire. The tire has a certain volume and pressure, right? When you let it out, the air expands into the surrounding atmosphere. Oh wait, but what happens to the temperature as a result? Well, I remember from school that when you pump air into a tire, the air heats up because it's doing work against the tire's pressure. But when you let it out, the air cools down. So that's the basic idea.

So the temperature of the air decreases as it exits the tire. Now, why does a person feel a cold sensation when they touch it? Well, I think it's because the air molecules are moving slower than they were inside the tire. When you blow out the air, the pressure is released, and the temperature drops. The molecules are moving more slowly, so they have less kinetic energy. At the same time, the mass of the air that's released is less than what was there before. Wait, but that might not be the main point.

Wait, maybe the main factor is that the air is expanding and cooling. So when you let the air out, it's expanding into the surrounding air. The surrounding air is at a higher temperature than the tire because it's at atmospheric pressure. Wait, no, the tire is under lower pressure when the car is moving because of the hills or something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: when you let the air out, the tire's internal pressure is slightly lower than the surrounding atmosphere. So the air inside is at a lower pressure than the outside. But when you let it expand, the air doesn't have to push against the outside pressure as effectively, so maybe the temperature drops. But does that mean the air feels cold because it's cooling down?

Oh wait, another angle: the temperature of the air in the tire is higher than the temperature outside. So when you let it out, the air cools down as it expands. But why does the person feel it cold?

Wait, maybe it's because the air is expanding and losing kinetic energy. The molecules are moving slower, so their kinetic energy is lower. But when you touch cold air, you feel its temperature. So if the air is at a lower temperature, then it's colder. So the decrease in temperature as it exits the tire is what makes it feel colder to the touch.

Wait, but then why is there a cooling sensation? Because the air is now at a lower temperature? Or maybe the pressure? No, pressure is separate. Or maybe because the tire is releasing its internal energy into the surroundings, so the temperature drops.

Wait, but the tire itself is at a certain temperature, and when you let air out, the air inside cools. So the air you're holding is at a lower temperature than it was in the tire. So when you touch it, it feels cold because it's at a lower temperature.

Wait, but the problem is that the tire is let out, so the air is expanding and cooling. So when you let it out, the temperature of the remaining air inside the tire is lower than before. So the person feels the air is colder.

Alternatively, another thought: when air is let out, the tire's internal pressure is released, so the air might expand and cool. So the person feels the air is cold because it's at a lower temperature than before.

Wait, but why would the air feel cold? Because it's the same as when you take a breath. Your body is at a higher temperature than the air, so when the air cools, it feels cold. So the temperature difference causes the sensation.

Alternatively, thinking about the kinetic theory: when the air molecules in the tire are moving faster, they have higher kinetic energy. When the tire is let out, the air's speed decreases, and the kinetic energy decreases. So the air would feel colder because it's moving slower than it was before.

Wait, but the tire's expansion causes the air to cool, not necessarily just the speed. So maybe the temperature is lower because of the expansion, and that's why it feels cold.

Looking at the options:

Option G is about decreased velocity, which makes sense because when the air expands, it cools. Since velocity is related to kinetic energy, cooling would mean lower kinetic energy, so lower velocity.

Option A says it mixes with colder air. That doesn't make sense. When you let out the air, it's the same as the tire. Wait, the tire's air is at lower pressure than atmospheric. Let me think: when you pump in air, the tire's pressure goes up, and the temperature goes up. When you let it out, the pressure goes down, and the temperature goes down. So the air you're holding is at a lower temperature than the tire's air. So the tire's air is at higher temperature than the air you're holding. So when you hold the air you're still at the same temperature as the tire's air.

Wait, no. When you let the air out, the air inside the tire is at a lower temperature than the surrounding atmosphere. So when you hold the air, the temperature is lower. So the person feels it's cold because it's at a lower temperature.

Wait, but then why is the tire's temperature lower than the surrounding air? Because you've pumped out air. So the air is at the tire's current temperature, which is lower than the surrounding air, so when you hold it, your skin feels it's colder.

So the correct reason is that the air is at a lower temperature than it was before, and when you hold it, it feels colder. So the cooling sensation is because the air is at a lower temperature, so the person feels it's cold.

Looking at the options, which one explains this? Option G says the air's velocity is decreased, which is a result of the air cooling. So that's correct.

Another option is E, which is about humidity. But humidity affects how much water vapor is present, but the question is about temperature, not humidity.

Option F is about evaporation, but that's about moisture loss. The question is about the air's temperature.

Option J is about heat absorption. The tire is probably losing heat, so it's getting warmer, but no, when you let it out, the air cools, so the tire may lose heat, but that's a passive process. The action here is the tire's air cooling.

Option G is about decreased velocity upon exiting. When air expands, the velocity decreases, and the kinetic energy (and thus temperature) decreases. So the cooling is due to the air's velocity, so G is correct.

Option H is about temperature due to insulation. Insulation would cause the air to stay warm if the insulating material is present, but when you let the air out, the insulating properties would affect the temperature. Hmm, but the tire's insulation would affect how quickly heat is lost, but the main point is the cooling of the air.

So the main reason is the air is cooling as it's let out, which causes the person to feel it cold. So the correct answer is G, decreased velocity upon exiting the tire.

When air is let out of an automobile tire, the air feels cold to the touch due to a combination of factors. The primary reason is that the air inside the tire cools as it exits. When air expands into the surrounding atmosphere, it does so at a rate that reduces both the temperature and the kinetic energy of the air molecules. This cooling occurs because the air molecules lose energy as they expand and lose kinetic energy, resulting in a lower temperature. The person feels the air cold because their body retains slightly more heat, causing the air to appear colder. This cooling is also related to the decreased velocity of the air molecules upon exiting the tire, as they slow down and lose kinetic energy during expansion.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The tire's air does not mix with colder atmospheric air; the temperature difference remains.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The chemical reaction within the tire is not relevant here; it is the temperature change that causes the sensation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The temperature does not fall due to work and energy; it falls due to cooling.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The decrease in air density upon expansion does not directly cause the temperature to fall.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Humidity affects moisture loss but does not explain the temperature cooling.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Evaporation of water is unrelated to the temperature change.
- **Option G**: Correct. The decreased velocity of the air molecules is a result of the air cooling as it exits the tire.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Insulation affects heat loss but does not explain the temperature change.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The tire's insulation properties do not cause the air to feel colder.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Heat absorption is passive and not the cause of the cooling sensation.

The correct explanation is that the air's velocity decreases upon exiting the tire, leading to a cooling sensation.
