Okay, so I've got this problem about capacitors in series and energy stored. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. Alright, the question says a 3-microfarad capacitor is connected in series with a 6-microfarad capacitor. Then a 300-volt potential difference is applied. We need to find the total energy stored in the two capacitors. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, capacitors in series. Right, when capacitors are connected in series, the same charge builds up on each capacitor. But the voltage adds up because each has a different capacitance. Oh, wait, no, the total voltage across the combination is the sum of the voltages across each. Because for series, the current is the same, but voltage adds. So first, I think I need to find the equivalent capacitance of the two in series.

The formula for two capacitors in series is 1/C_eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2. So C1 is 3 μF and C2 is 6 μF. Let me plug in the values. So 1/C_eq = 1/3 + 1/6. Let's calculate that. 1/3 is 0.333..., and 1/6 is 0.166..., so adding them gives 0.5. Therefore, C_eq is 2 μF. Because 1/C_eq is 0.5, so C_eq is 2 μF.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh right, because 1/(1/3 + 1/6) = 1/( (2 + 1)/6 ) )= 6/(3) = 2 μF. Yup, that's correct.

Now, when the total voltage is 300 V, how much charge is stored? Because for capacitors in series, the charge is the same on each. The formula is Q = C_eq * V. So Q = 2 μF * 300 V. Wait, 2e-6 F * 300 V. Let's compute that: 2e-6 * 300 = 0.0006 coulombs. Oh wait, 2e-6 times 300 is 6e-4 coulombs. Because 300 is 3e2, so 2e-6 * 3e2 = (2*3) * 1e-4 = 6e-4 C.

So the charge is 6e-4 C. Now, the energy stored in a capacitor is 0.5 * C * V^2. Or alternatively, since Q is known, energy is 0.5 * Q^2 / C. Let me think which is easier here. Both should give the same result.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is the sum of the energies stored in each capacitor. Because in series, each has a different voltage but same charge. So Energy_total = 0.5 * C1 * V1^2 + 0.5 * C2 * V2^2.

But I can also find V1 and V2. Since the total voltage V is V1 + V2, and from the charge Q = C1 V1 = C2 V2. So V1 = Q/C1, V2 = Q/C2.

Let me calculate V1 and V2.

Q is 6e-4 C.

V1 = (6e-4 C) / (3e-6 F) = (6e-4)/(3e-6) = (6/3) * (1e-4 / 1e-6) )= 2 * 1e2 = 200 V.

Similarly, V2 = Q/C2 = (6e-4) / (6e-6) = (6e-4)/(6e-6) = (6/6) * (1e-4 / 1e-6) )= 1 * 1e2 = 100 V.

Wait, wait no, wait. Because in series, the reciprocals add. But let's think again. So, since Q is 6e-4 C, V1 is Q/(3e-6) = 6e-4 / 3e-6 = (6/3) * (1e-4)/(1e-6) ) → 2 * 100 = 200 V. Similarly, V2 is 6e-4 / 6e-6 = 100 V. So total voltage is 200+100=300 V, which matches. That's correct.

Now, energy stored in each.

First capacitor: 0.5 * 3e-6 F * (200 V)^2. Let's compute that.

(200)^2 = 40000.

So 0.5 * 3e-6 * 4e4 = 0.5 * 3e-6 * 4e4.

Wait, 3e-6 *4e4 = (3*4) * (1e-6 * 1e4) )=12 * 1e-2 = 0.12.

Multiply by 0.5 gives 0.06 J.

Second capacitor: 0.5 *6e-6 F*(100 V)^2.

(100)^2=1e4.

0.5 *6e-6 *1e4 = 0.5 *6e-6 *1e4.

6e-6 *1e4 =6e-2 =0.06.

Multiply by 0.5 → 0.03 J.

So total energy is 0.06 +0.03 =0.09 J. Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 0.09 J, but wait, let me check again. Oh wait, I might have made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate. Because 3e-6 F is 3 microfarad, 6e-6 is 6.

So first capacitor: 0.5 * 3e-6 * (200)^2.

Compute (200)^2: 40000.

So 0.5 *3e-6 *4e4 = 0.5 *3e-6 *4e4.

3e-6 *4e4 = 3e-2 (since 3*4=12, exponents 10^-6 *10^4=10^-2 → 0.012. Wait, wait no: 3e-6 is 0.000003. 4e4 is 40000.

So 0.000003 *40000 = 1.2 (since 40,000 * 3e-6 = (4e4) * (3e-6) = (4*3) * 1e(4-6) ) → 12 *1e-2 → 0.12.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.06 J.

Second capacitor: 0.5 *6e-6 *100^2.

100^2=1e4.

0.5 *6e-6 *1e4 = 0.5 *6e-6 *1e4 → same as 6e-6 * 5e3.

6e-6 *5e3 = 3e-2 → 0.03 J.

0.06 +0.03 is 0.09 J. So the total is 0.09 J. Looking at the options, that's option H.

Wait, but looking back, let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with H being 0.09 J. So that should be the answer.

Alternatively, another approach: the total energy can also be calculated using the equivalent capacitance. Since the voltage is 300 V, the energy is 0.5 * C_eq * V^2.

C_eq is 2e-6 F.

So 0.5 * 2e-6 * (300)^2.

300 squared is 9e4.

So 0.5 * 2e-6 * 9e4 = (0.5 * 2) * e-6 *9e4 = (1) * (9e4 *1e-6) → 9e-2 = 0.09 J. Same answer. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is option H, 0.09 J.

To solve the problem, we analyze the two capacitors connected in series. The formula for the equivalent capacitance of capacitors in series is:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
\]

Here, \(C_1 = 3 \, \mu\text{F}\) and \(C_2 = 6 \, \mu\text{F}\). Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, \(C_{\text{eq}} = 2 \, \mu\text{F}\).

Next, the total voltage across the combination is given as \(V = 300 \, \text{V}\). The charge \(Q\) stored on the capacitors is the same across both capacitors and is calculated using:

\[
Q = C_{\text{eq}} \cdot V = 2 \, \mu\text{F} \cdot 300 \, \text{V} = 600 \, \text{pC} = 6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{C}
\]

The energy stored in a capacitor is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]

For the entire system, the voltage across each capacitor can be found using the charge \(Q\). The voltage across the first capacitor (\(V_1\)) is:

\[
V_1 = \frac{Q}{C_1} = \frac{6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{C}}{3 \, \mu\text{F}} = 200 \, \text{V}
\]

The voltage across the second capacitor (\(V_2\)) is:

\[
V_2 = \frac{Q}{C_2} = \frac{6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{C}}{6 \, \mu\text{F}} = 100 \, \text{V}
\]

The total energy stored is the sum of the energies stored in each capacitor:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_1 + U_2
\]

Where:

\[
U_1 = \frac{1}{2} C_1 V_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} (3 \, \mu\text{F}) (200 \, \text{V})^2 = 0.06 \, \text{J}
\]

\[
U_2 = \frac{1}{2} C_2 V_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} (6 \, \mu\text{F}) (100 \, \text{V})^2 = 0.03 \, \text{J}
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = 0.06 \, \text{J} + 0.03 \, \text{J} = 0.09 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the total energy stored in the two capacitors is \(0.09 \, \text{J}\), which corresponds to option **H**.
