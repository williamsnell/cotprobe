Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric flux and charge enclosed. Hmm, I remember from my notes that Gauss's Law relates electric flux to the enclosed charge. Let me think. Oh right, Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed multiplied by some constant. Wait, what's the exact formula again?

Oh yeah, the flux Φ is equal to Q_enc / ε₀. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think it's Φ = Q_enc / ε₀? Or is it Φ = Q_enc * ε₀? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. Gauss's Law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀. So, Φ equals Q divided by the vacuum permittivity.

Wait, no. I think it's Φ equals Q_enc multiplied by ε₀. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting mixed up. Let me get this right. The correct formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀. So, flux is Q divided by epsilon naught.

Wait, wait, let's double-check. I think it's Φ = Q / ε₀. So, if I have Φ, I can solve for Q by rearranging: Q = Φ * ε₀.

Ah, right! So the problem states the electric flux is 4.0e4 N·m²/C. I need to find Q.

Wait, but what's the value of ε₀? Oh, I remember. ε₀ is approximately 8.854 × 10^-12 C²/(N·m²). So, plugging in the numbers.

Given Φ = 4.0e4 N·m²/C. Let me compute Q = Φ * ε₀.

Calculating that: 4.0e4 * 8.854e-12.

Wait, let me compute that. 4e4 is 40,000. 40,000 times 8.854e-12 equals?

Let me compute it step by step. 40,000 is 4e4. So, 4e4 * 8.854e-12 = (4 * 8.854) * 1e4 *1e-12.

4 * 8.854 is 35.416. 1e4 *1e-12 is 1e-8. So 35.416e-8 is 3.5416e-7.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it exactly: 4e4 = 40000.

40000 * 8.854e-12 = 40000 * 0.000000000008854.

Let me compute this:

40000 = 4e4.

So 4e4 * 8.854e-12 = (4 * 8.854) * 1e4 * 1e-12 = 35.416 * 1e-8 = 3.5416e-7 C.

So Q is approximately 3.54e-7 C.

Looking at the options:

Option I is 3.54e-07. So the answer should be I.

To determine the net charge enclosed by the spherical surface, we use Gauss's Law, which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity of free space, ε₀. The formula is:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

Rearranging for \( Q_{\text{enc}} \), we get:

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \Phi \cdot \varepsilon_0
\]

Here, the given electric flux is \( \Phi = 4.0 \times 10^4 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C} \), and the permittivity of free space is \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/(\text{N·m}^2) \). Substituting these values:

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = (4.0 \times 10^4) \cdot (8.854 \times 10^{-12})
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
4.0 \cdot 8.854 = 35.416
\]

Next, handle the powers of 10:

\[
10^4 \cdot 10^{-12} = 10^{-8}
\]

Combining these results:

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = 35.416 \cdot 10^{-8} = 3.5416 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C}
\]

Rounding to three significant figures, \( Q_{\text{enc}} \approx 3.54 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C} \).

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: 3.54e-07**
