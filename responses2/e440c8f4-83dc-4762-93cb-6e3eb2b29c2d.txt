Okay, so I have this question about ileostomy openings. I'm a bit rusty on my digestive system knowledge, but let me think through this. 

First, I remember that ileostomy is the part where the stomach meets the small intestine. There are different types, like flat, deep, and wide. The opening is important because it determines the ease of passing stool and how the body processes food. 

The question is asking about the last character of the answer. The options are A to G, and the correct answer has to be one of these, with the last letter matching the answer choice.

Option A says the opening should be less than 1cm. Wait, I think the ileostomy opening is usually around 3-5cm. That's because a narrower opening makes it easier for the small intestine to access the stomach contents. If it's too narrow, especially less than 1cm, it might cause issues like indigestion or constipation because the stool might get stuck.

Option B: invisible to the naked eye. I'm not sure about this. I think the opening is visible when you look at the digestive system, especially with tools. It's more about accessibility than visibility. So probably not B.

Option C: 3-5cm in length. That sounds right because I've heard that the standard opening is about 3-5cm. It's a balance between accessibility and the ability to pass stool properly.

Option D: below skin level. No, that doesn't make sense. The opening is above the skin, so D is incorrect.

Option E: protruding 10cm from the skin. No, that's even further than I thought. 10cm sounds too much. I think the standard is 3-5cm.

Option F: over 10cm in length. That's even more incorrect. I don't think it's that long.

Option G: over 5cm in length. Hmm, that's a possibility. Some sources say that under 3cm is too narrow, but maybe 3-5cm is acceptable for most people. But I'm not certain if it's over 5 or under 3. 

Wait, another thought: I remember learning that the standard opening is about 3-5cm. So option C is correct. But why is option G not correct? Maybe because 3-5 isn't over 5. So G would be incorrect. Oh wait, I think I might have gotten that reversed. Let me think again.

If the opening is less than 3cm, it's too narrow. So 3-5 might be the correct range. So option C is correct. Then why is option G (over 5cm) incorrect? Because 5cm is still within the acceptable range. So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: 3-5cm in length.

Answer: C
