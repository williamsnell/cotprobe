Okay, so I have this question about Gauthier's philosophy. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question asks what practical rationality is based on. The options are A to J. I remember that Gauthier is an existentialist, so his views might relate to his broader philosophical stance. Existentialists often focus on the individual's existence and the meaning of existence.

The options are about different types of justification. Let's break them down.

Option A is logical justification. That's about deriving conclusions from premises logically. But I think in practical rationality, it's more about taking actions based on what makes sense, not necessarily logically justifying it.

Option B is epistemic justification. That's about knowledge. Like, how we acquire knowledge. But the question is about practical rationality, so maybe not.

Option C is existential justification. That sounds about right. existentialism is about the individual's existence and the meaning of existence. Practical rationality in existentialism might involve affirming the best interests of the individual because that's their existence.

Option D is theoretical justification. That's about justifying theories or ideas through theory, like in mathematics or science. But I don't think that's what Gauthier would say about practical actions.

Option E is moral justification. That's about duties or rights. Again, not directly about the existence of the individual.

Option F is emotional justification. That's about the impact of one's emotions. Not really about practical actions, more about motivations.

Option G is deliberative justification. That's about considering the best options through deliberation. I'm not sure if Gauthier would focus on that.

Option H is an illusion. That's a bit abstract; I don't think it's a type of justification.

Option I is spiritual justification. That's about beliefs in the divine. Not directly related to practical actions.

Option J is aesthetic justification. That's about beauty or moral appeal. Doesn't fit.

So, the key here is that Gauthier is an existentialist, and his view on existentialism includes that his actions and choices are justified by the best interests he affirms. So the correct answer should be C: existential justification.

The correct answer is C: existential justification.
