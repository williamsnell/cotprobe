Okay, so I've got this problem about a shirt's markdowns. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the shirt was originally $6.75. During the sale, it went down to $4.50. Then, the price was changed to $5.50. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because $4.50 is lower than $5.50, but maybe that's part of the process. Hmm, I think the question is about the markdowns—both gross and net—so I need to calculate both.

So, gross markdown is the total amount you can't sell the item for, right? That's the difference between the original price and the price after the sale. So, original was $6.75, sale is $4.50. So gross markdown would be 6.75 - 4.50. Let me calculate that: 6.75 minus 4.50 is 2.25 dollars. So gross markdown is $2.25. That's the first part.

Now, net markdown after the price change. Wait, the sale price is $4.50, but then it's changed to $5.50. Hmm, so the net markdown might be the difference between the sale price and the new price. But wait, no. Because the sale was to $4.50, which is lower than $5.50. So, if they then change it to $5.50, that would mean they're increasing the price, not decreasing. So perhaps the net markdown is the difference between the original and the final price after the change.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The initial markdown was from $6.75 to $4.50, which is a markdown of $2.25. Then, the price was changed to $5.50, which is a new price. So, the net markdown is the difference between the final price and the initial price. Wait, no, because the net markdown is the amount that's not sold anymore. So, if the price was reduced to $4.50, and then increased to $5.50, the net markdown would be the amount you could have sold it for, which is the final price minus the original. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the final price is higher than the sale price. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait no, perhaps the net markdown is the difference between the sale price and the new price, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the net markdown is the amount you couldn't sell it for after the final change.

Wait, perhaps the markdowns are two separate events: the first markdown from original to sale price, and then another markdown from sale price to the new price.

Let me re-read the question. It says, the shirt was originally $6.75. During a sale, it was reduced to $4.50. Then the price was changed to $5.50. So, the first markdown is $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25. The second markdown is from $4.50 to $5.50, which is an increase, so no markdown in that sense. But wait, perhaps the net markdown is the total markdown after the two changes.

Wait, no. The net markdown would be the total amount you can't sell it for after both the sale and the final price change. So, originally, you could sell it for $6.75. Then, after the sale, you can't sell it for $4.50. Then they change the price to $5.50, which is a new price, so you can't sell it for $5.50. So, the net markdown is the difference between the original and the final price. Original was $6.75, final is $5.50. So, net markdown is 6.75 - 5.50 = 1.25 dollars. So, that's $1.25 in net markdown.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the net markdown is the difference between the final price and the original price. Because the net markdown is the amount you can't sell it for after all changes. So if you go from $6.75 to $4.50, that's a markdown of 2.25. Then, they change it to $5.50, which is a markup. So, the net markdown would be the difference between the original and the final price because that's what you're not selling it for. So, 6.75 - 5.50 = 1.25. So, net markdown is $1.25.

So, the gross markdown is $2.25, net markdown is $1.25.

Now, the question also asks for the net markdown percentage of the current price. So, the current price is $5.50. The net markdown is $1.25. So, percentage would be (1.25 / 5.50) * 100.

Let me calculate that: 1.25 divided by 5.50.

1.25 ÷ 5.5 = ?

Well, 5.5 goes into 1.25. Let's see, 5.5 * 0.227 is about 1.2485, which is approximately 0.227. So, 22.7%.

Looking at the options, option B says net markdown percentage is 22.7%, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. 5.50 multiplied by 22.7% is:

5.50 * 0.227 = 1.2485, which is about $1.25. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options:

A: 18.2%
B: 22.7%
C: 27.2%
D: 22.7%
E: 13.6%
F: 22.7%
G: 31.8%
H: 18.2%
I: 22.7%
J: 27.3%

So, the net markdown percentage is 22.7%, which is in options B, D, F, I, and H. So, the correct option must have both net markdown $1.25 and the percentage 22.7%.

Looking back, option B says net markdown is $1.00, which is different. Option D says net markdown is $1.25, which matches. So, option D is (Gross:2.25, Net:1.25, Net%:22.7%). So, the correct answer should be option D.
</think>

The correct answer is option D, which states:

- Gross Markdown: $2.25
- Net Markdown: $1.25
- Net Markdown Percentage: 22.7%

**Answer: D**
