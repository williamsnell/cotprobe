Okay, so I’ve got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gas collected by displacement of water. They give me the total pressure as 700 torr, the temperature is 30°C, and the vapor pressure of water at 30°C is 32 torr. The partial pressure of nitrogen is 550 torr, and I need to find the partial pressure of oxygen.

Hmm, I remember that when gases are collected over water, the total pressure is the sum of the gas pressure and the vapor pressure of the water. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the total pressure is equal to the partial pressure of the gas plus the vapor pressure of the water. Because the water vapor and the gas are in equilibrium when the gas is collected. So the total pressure (P_total) is the sum of the partial pressure of the gas (P_gas) plus the vapor pressure of water (P_water).

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think. Oh, no, wait. The gas is in equilibrium with the water vapor, so the total pressure should be the sum of the partial pressure of the gas and the vapor pressure of water. Because the vapor pressure of water is part of the water vapor in the air, and the gas's partial pressure is what's measured.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressure of the gas and the vapor pressure of water. So, if the total pressure is Pt, then Pt = P_gas + P_water. So here, Pt is 700 torr. The partial pressure of nitrogen is 550 torr. So to find the partial pressure of oxygen, I can rearrange the formula.

Right, so P_O2 = Pt - P_N2. So substituting the numbers, that's 700 - 550. Let me calculate that. 700 minus 550 is 150. Wait, wait, but wait. Oh wait, but wait another thing. Could I have mixed up the partial pressures? Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases in the container should equal the total pressure. But in this case, the gases collected are nitrogen and oxygen. So Pt = P_N2 + P_O2 + P_water. Wait, because the total pressure includes the vapor of water, which is separate from the collected gas. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when you collect the gas over water, the water vapor is part of the gas mixture. So the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the collected gas and the vapor pressure of water.

Wait, actually, no. The total pressure in the container (before collection) is the sum of the partial pressures of all gases, including the water vapor. But when you collect the gas, it's the pressure of the gas alone plus the vapor. So, the total pressure when collected is the same as the total pressure before collection. So the equation is Pt (total) = P_N2 + P_O2 + P_water. Wait, no, wait. No, the water vapor is part of the collected gas. So when you collect the gas, the total pressure is the sum of the gas's partial pressure and the water's vapor pressure. So Pt = P_gas + P_water. Because the gas's partial pressure (which is what's collected) plus the water's vapor pressure equals the total pressure.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me clarify. The container (the tube) has the gas and the water vapor. When you collect the gas, the water vapor is separate from the gas. So the total pressure is indeed the sum of the gas's partial pressure and the water's vapor pressure. So Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the water vapor is part of the collected gas. So the collected gas's pressure would be PN2. But the total pressure is the sum of PN2 and P_water. Because the container's pressure is the sum of the collected gas (PN2) and the water vapor (P_water). So Pt = PN2 + P_water.

Wait, but that would mean that Pt is the sum of the collected gas's partial pressure and the vapor pressure of water. So in this problem, Pt is 700 torr, which equals PN2 + P_water.

Wait, wait. So if I have Pt = 700 torr, and P_N2 is 550 torr, then P_water would be Pt - P_N2 = 700 - 550 = 150 torr. But wait, the vapor pressure of water at 30°C is given as 32 torr. So that's a conflict. Because according to the calculation, P_water is 150 torr, but the problem states it's 32 torr. That can't be right.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again. Maybe I confused the partial pressures. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "the partial pressure of nitrogen is 550 torr." So that would be PN2 = 550 torr. The vapor pressure of water is 32 torr. So Pt is 700 torr. So the sum is Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water. Because the collected gas's pressure is PN2, and the water's vapor is P_water. So Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the container's total pressure before collection is the sum of PN2 (the gas) and P_water (the vapor). When you collect the gas, the vapor is removed, so the pressure you measure is PN2. But the total pressure in the container (before collection) is Pt = PN2 + P_water.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the collected gas and the container's pressure. Let me think of it this way: when you collect the gas over water, the pressure you measure is the partial pressure of the gas (since the water vapor is removed). But the container's total pressure (before collection) is equal to the sum of the partial pressure of the gas plus the vapor pressure of water. So the initial Pt (before collection) is PN2 + P_water.

Wait, but then when you collect the gas, the pressure you measure is PN2. But the container's total pressure (before collection) is PN2 + P_water. So the total pressure in the container is 700 torr, so 700 = PN2 + 32. That would imply PN2 = 668 torr. But the question says PN2 is 550 torr. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the situation. Let me think again. The mixture is collected by displacement of water. So the total pressure in the container (before collection) is the sum of the gas's partial pressure and the water vapor. So Pt = PN2 + P_water.

Given that Pt is 700 torr, and P_water is 32 torr, then PN2 would be 700-32=668 torr. But the question says that PN2 is 550, which doesn't match. Hmm, which suggests I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Could the actual equation be Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water. Because when you collect the gas, the container is at Pt, which equals PN2 (the collected gas's pressure) plus P_water (the vapor pressure). So Pt = PN2 + P_water. So Pt = PN2 + 32.

But the question states that PN2 is 550 torr. So 700 = 550 + 32 = 582? No, that's not possible. So perhaps the setup is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Maybe the vapor pressure of the collected gas is 32 torr, but the problem says the vapor pressure of water at 30°C is 32. So the water vapor is 32 torr.

So Pt = PN2 + P_water → 700 = PN2 + 32 → PN2 = 668 torr. But the question states that PN2 is 550. Hmm, so this implies that the problem's given data is conflicting.

Wait, that can't be. I must have made a mistake. Let me read the problem again to see if I misread any part.

The question says, "the mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gas is collected by displacement of water at 30°C and 700 torr Hg press. if the partial pressure of nitrogen is 550 torr, what is the partial pressure of oxygen?"

Wait, perhaps I forgot that when you collect the gas over water, the total pressure is the sum of the gas's partial pressure and the vapor pressure of the water. So Pt = PN2 + P_water. So Pt is the sum of PN2 and P_water.

Ah, but if that's the case, then if Pt is 700 torr, and P_water is 32 torr, then PN2 would be 668 torr. But the problem says PN2 is 550 torr. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the question is giving the vapor pressure of water as 32 torr, which is correct, but perhaps the calculated partial pressure is 550, so the oxygen would be 700 -550 -32= 118 torr? Wait, let me compute.

Wait, if Pt is 700 = PN2 + PO2 + P_water → 700 = 550 + PO2 +32 → 700 - 550 -32 = PO2 → 700-582=118. So PO2 would be 118 torr. That's option B. But wait, this approach would require that the initial equation is Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water. But that can't be correct, because when you collect the gas, the container's pressure (Pt) is equal to the sum of PN2 and P_water. So Pt = PN2 + P_water. So PO2 would be zero? That can't be right, because we're supposed to find PO2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about which pressures are being considered. Let me think again.

When you collect the gas over water, the pressure measured is the partial pressure of the gas (PN2). The total pressure in the container (before collection) is the sum of PN2 and P_water (32 torr). So Pt = PN2 + P_water.

But wait, Pt is the total pressure of the gas in the container (before collection), which includes the water vapor. So when you collect the gas, the pressure you measure is PN2, but the container's pressure is Pt = PN2 + P_water.

So from the problem, Pt is 700 torr, and PN2 is 550. So 700 = 550 + 32 → 582. But 700 is not 582. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using Dalton's Law, which states that the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of all components.

But in this case, the container's pressure (Pt) is equal to PN2 + PO2 + P_water.

Wait, but that would mean Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water → 700 = 550 + PO2 +32 → 700 -550 -32 = PO2 → 700-582=118. So PO2=118 torr. But that's option B.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for PO2, and if the sum is 700, then if PN2 is 550 and P_water is 32, then PO2 would be 700-550-32=118. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because when you collect the gas over water, the pressure you measure is PN2. The container's total pressure is PN2 + P_water (32). Therefore, Pt = PN2 + P_water. So Pt = 700 = 550 +32. That can't be, because 550+32=582, which is less than 700. So that's a contradiction.

Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the question is considering the vapor pressure of the collected gas as 32 torr. But that's not what the problem says. The problem states that the vapor pressure of water is 32 torr. So the water vapor is 32 torr.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is using a different definition. Maybe the vapor pressure is 32 torr, but that's the vapor pressure of the collected gas, not the water. No, the problem says, "the vapor pressure of Hg press (water) at 30°C is 32 torr." So the water vapor is 32 torr.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total pressure is the sum of the gas's partial pressure and the water vapor, so Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water. But that can't be correct because the gas and water vapor are both gases in the container.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me structure this.

The system is a container with gas (nitrogen and oxygen) and water. The setup is displacement, so the water is pushed out, and the gas is collected. The pressure of this collected gas is what's measured. But the container's total initial pressure is the sum of the collected gas's partial pressure (PN2) and the water vapor (P_water).

So Pt = PN2 + P_water.

So we have Pt=700, PN2=550, so P_water=700 -550=150 torr.

But the problem states that P_water is 32 torr, so this is a contradiction. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the vapor pressure of the collected gas and just consider the gas and the water vapor. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the vapor pressure of the water is 32 torr, but that's the vapor pressure of the collected gas. Which would make the total pressure in the container 700 torr = PN2 + 32 → PN2=668. But the problem states PN2 is 550. So this again doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I've got it wrong, and the vapor pressure is not part of the collected gas's pressure. Let me think: when you collect the gas, it's the pressure inside the container that's measured. So the container's pressure is Pt=700 torr, which is equal to PN2 + P_water. So Pt=700 = PN2 + 32 → PN2=668 torr. But the problem states PN2 is 550. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the vapor pressure of water is perhaps the same as the vapor pressure of the collected gas. No, that's not correct because the vapor pressure is the pressure the water would exert if it were a gas at the same temperature. So the collected gas's vapor pressure is separate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the collected gas is not including the water vapor. No, that can't be right because the water would condense, and the pressure would include both.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the vapor pressure of the collected gas is 32 torr, but the question says the vapor pressure of water is 32 torr. So perhaps the water vapor is 32 torr, and the gas's partial pressure is 550 torr. Then the collected gas's pressure would be 550, but the container's total pressure would be 550 + 32 = 582 torr, but the problem says the total pressure is 700. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting myself stuck. Let me try to approach this in a different way. Let's use the equation Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water.

We know:

Pt = 700
PN2 = 550
P_water = 32

So, 700 = 550 + PO2 +32 → 700 -550 -32 = PO2 → 700-582=118.

So PO2 = 118 torr.

That's option B.

But wait, earlier I thought that Pt would be equal to PN2 + P_water, but that's not correct. Because when you collect the gas, the container's total pressure (before collection) is the sum of the collected gas's pressure and the water vapor.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

Pt = PN2 + PO2 + P_water.

Thus, PO2 comes out to be 118 torr, which is option B.

Therefore, the answer should be option B, 118 torr.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using the principles of gas behavior and Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. The mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gas is collected over water, and the total pressure is given as 700 torr. The vapor pressure of water at 30°C is 32 torr, and the partial pressure of nitrogen is 550 torr. The goal is to determine the partial pressure of oxygen.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Dalton's Law**: The total pressure in the container is the sum of the partial pressures of all components, including the water vapor. Thus, the total pressure is given by:
   \[
   P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{N}_2} + P_{\text{O}_2} + P_{\text{water}}
   \]

2. **Given Data**:
   - \( P_{\text{total}} = 700 \, \text{torr} \)
   - \( P_{\text{N}_2} = 550 \, \text{torr} \)
   - \( P_{\text{water}} = 32 \, \text{torr} \)

3. **Rearranging the Equation**:
   Substituting the known values into the total pressure equation:
   \[
   700 = 550 + P_{\text{O}_2} + 32
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   700 = 582 + P_{\text{O}_2}
   \]
   Solve for \( P_{\text{O}_2} \):
   \[
   P_{\text{O}_2} = 700 - 582 = 118 \, \text{torr}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The partial pressure of oxygen is 118 torr. This corresponds to option **B**.
