Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the 'living instrument principle' and which case illustrates it. The options are A to D, each with a different case. I'm a bit rusty on my Human Rights Law, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the 'living instrument principle' was established by the European Court of Human Rights. It's about when a human rights organization can act without a court order, allowing them to collect and use private citizens' information as part of their work. The basic idea is that as long as the organization is acting in accordance with the principle, it's allowed to collect and use private data without a court's permission.

Looking at the options, each case involves a human rights organization. I need to figure out which case is the best example of this principle in action.

Option A: Golder v UK (1978). I think Golder was a case where the Human Rights Department of the UK used information from a human rights organization, like the Golder Foundation, to fund their work. But I'm not sure if it directly falls under the living instrument principle. It might be more about the use of information for public interest rather than acting as a living instrument.

Option B: A v UK (2009). I'm not familiar with this one, but I know that the A v UK case involved the UK's agencies against a human rights organization. The case was about the UK's use of the organization's information for its own political gains, which might have been a different issue.

Option C: Goodwin v UK (2002). I'm pretty sure this case was about the UK's use of information from a human rights organization for its own political purposes. Like A v UK, this might have been a case where the organization's information was used for the UK's own business, which is a possible example of the living instrument principle.

Option D: Osman v UK (1998). I'm not certain about this one, but I think it might have been about the protection of personal information or another aspect of human rights.

Wait, I think the living instrument principle was about the organization being allowed to act in accordance with the principle, not using the information for their own gain. So which case directly shows that the organization's use of private data meets the principle.

Wait, another thought: I recall that A v UK was about the UK's use of a human rights organization's information for political gain. So if the organization's info was used for the UK's interests, that might not be the living instrument case. The living instrument case would be when the organization is acting in good faith and using the info for their work, not for personal gain.

So then, which option fits this? Let me think. Golder v UK (1978) is about the use of information for the organization's own work, not for the public good. Goodwin v UK (2002) is about the UK's business interests, not about the organization using their info for their own work.

A v UK (2009) involves the UK's use of the organization's info for political purposes. So that's more about the organization's use for the UK's interests, perhaps. But in the context of the living instrument, it's when the organization is acting without court permission, using the info for their own work.

Wait, I think the living instrument case was when the organization's use of the information was for their own work, not for the public's interest. So maybe the correct example is Goodwin v UK (2002), but why?

Wait another angle: the 'living instrument' principle is applied when the organization is acting in accordance with it. So if the organization is acting on their own behalf, without court permission, then it's the living instrument. So for instance, Goodwin v UK might involve the UK using information for their own business, but the organization's use of it for their own work is the living instrument.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up cases. Let me think about the key features. The living instrument principle requires that the organization be acting in accordance with the principle, not for personal gain. So the case must involve the organization using their info for their own work, not for the public's.

Looking again, A v UK is about the UK using the organization's info for its own political use. So the organization's info is being used for the protection of the UK's interests, perhaps. That's more about the organization's use for the public good, but I'm not sure if that's the living instrument case.

Perhaps the correct answer is C: Goodwin v UK (2002). Because that's the case where the UK used information from a human rights organization for its business, but the organization's use of that info was for their own work, not for the public's. So that would fit the living instrument principle.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the living instrument was about the organization not using the info for personal gain. So when someone uses the info for their own work, that's the living instrument. The case where they used it for the public's interest (like A v UK) might be more of a case of free speech, not the living instrument.

Alternatively, maybe the living instrument case is when the organization is acting on their own actions, not for another's. So for example, if the organization is acting in a way that's in accordance with their own policies, using the info as part of their work, that's the living instrument.

So looking again at options:

A: Golder v UK (1978) – the UK used the foundation's info to fund their work, but was this because the foundation is acting in accordance with the living instrument? Or was it because it's against the public interest? I think Golder was about the foundation's info being used for their own political gain.

B: A v UK (2009) – the UK used the foundation's info for its own business, not for the public's interest. So this might not fit the living instrument.

C: Goodwin v UK (2002) – the UK used the foundation's info for their business, but the foundation used it for their own work, which is the living instrument case.

D: Osman v UK (1998) – not sure about this.

Wait, I think the case that best illustrates the living instrument is C: Goodwin v UK (2002) because that's when the UK used the foundation's information for their own business, but the foundation was acting in accordance with the living instrument, not for the public good. So the foundation is acting in accordance with the principle, which is the living instrument.

Alternatively, another approach: the living instrument principle is about the organization being allowed to act in good faith and without court permission, using the information for their own work, not for the public good.

So among the options, the only one where the human rights organization is acting in good faith is C: Goodwin v UK (2002), because the UK used their information for business, and the foundation used it for their own work. So this would fit the living instrument.

Another thought: the case that most clearly shows the living instrument is Golder v UK (1978). Because in that case, the UK used the foundation's information to fund their work for public interest. But that might not be the living instrument because the foundation was acting in a way that's not necessarily in accordance with the principle.

Wait, the living instrument case is about the organization using the info for their own work. So perhaps the correct answer is C: Goodwin v UK (2002), because that's when the UK used the foundation's info for their business, and the foundation was acting in accordance with the living instrument principle.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should think of the key aspects of each case.

Golder v UK: The UK used the foundation's information for its own political purpose (funding its work). So that's about the public interest, not the living instrument.

A v UK: The UK used the foundation's info for its business. So the foundation was acting for their own business, not as a living instrument.

Goodwin v UK: The UK used the foundation's info for business, but the foundation used it for their work, which is the living instrument.

Osman v UK: I'm not sure about this, but perhaps it's about the foundation's use of info for the public's interest.

So the correct answer seems to be C: Goodwin v UK (2002), because it's where the UK used the foundation's info for business, and the foundation was acting in accordance with the living instrument principle.

The 'living instrument principle' is about an organization acting in good faith and using its information for the organization's own work, not for personal gain. The case that best illustrates this principle is **C: Goodwin v UK (2002)**. In this case, the UK used the foundation's information for business, but the foundation was acting in accordance with the living instrument principle, using the information to support its work. This aligns with the principle that the organization is permitted to collect and use private citizens' information as part of its work, not for the public's interest.
