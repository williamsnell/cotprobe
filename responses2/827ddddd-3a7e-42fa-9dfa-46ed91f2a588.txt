Okay, so I need to figure out how many straws Conor used in total. Let me read the question again. 

Conor made 9 shapes with straws, and each shape had 5 straws. Then he used 15 more straws to make more shapes. I need to find the total number of straws he used for all the shapes.

Wait, wait. Let me break this down. First, he made 9 shapes. Each shape has 5 straws. So the initial number of straws used would be 9 shapes multiplied by 5 straws each. That's 9 * 5 = 45 straws. 

Then, he used 15 more straws for more shapes. Oh, but the question is about the total number of straws he used, not how many he made. So does that 15 straws add to the total, or are they separate? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read.

"Conor made 9 shapes with straws. Each shape had 5 straws. Conor used 15 more straws to make more shapes. What is the total number of straws Conor used to make all the shapes?"

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. So he made 9 shapes, each with 5 straws. So that's 9 *5 =45. Then he made more shapes using 15 extra straws. Wait, but the question is about how many straws he used in total, not how many more shapes. So maybe the 15 straws are additional to the initial 45. So the total would be 45 +15 =60? That would make sense because the question says he used 15 more straws to make more shapes. So the total straws he used are the initial 45 plus the additional 15. So 45 +15 is 60. 

Wait, but let me make sure. If he made 9 shapes, each with 5, that's 45. Then he made more shapes with 15 more straws. So the total straws used are 45 (from the first 9 shapes) plus 15 (from the additional shapes), making it 60 in total. So the answer should be 60, which is option A.

The total number of straws Conor used is calculated by adding the initial 9 shapes (each with 5 straws) to the additional 15 straws. 9Ã—5=45, plus 15 equals 60.

Answer: A: 60
