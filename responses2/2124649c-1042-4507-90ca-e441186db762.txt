Okay, so I've got this question about ratios and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. The question is: Which ratios are equal to 4 : 32? And the options are A, B, C, D, each with different pairs of numbers.

Hmm, I remember that ratios can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor. Let's start by simplifying 4:32. The numbers are 4 and 32. What's the greatest common divisor of 4 and 32? Well, 4 divides into 32 exactly 8 times, so the GCD is 4.

So, dividing both terms by 4: 4 ÷ 4 is 1, and 32 ÷4 is 8. So 4:32 simplifies to 1:8. That's the simplest form.

Now I need to check each option to see which pairs simplify to 1:8.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 2 : 96; 2 :16. Let's simplify each ratio.
- 2:96. What's the GCD? 2 and 96. 2 divides into 96 48 times. So dividing both by 2 gives 1:48.
- 2:16. GCD is 2. Divide both by 2: 1:8.
So one ratio is 1:48 and the other is 1:8. These aren't both equal to 1:8. So A is out.

Option B: 12 :96; 12 :16.
Simplify each:
- 12:96. GCD is 12. 12 ÷12 = 1, 96 ÷12=8. So 1:8.
- 12:16. GCD is 4. 12 ÷4=3, 16 ÷4=4. So 3:4.
So one is 1:8 and the other is 3:4. Only one matches, so B isn't correct.

Option C: 2 :96; 12 :16.
We've already simplified these earlier. 2:96 is 1:48, 12:16 is 3:4. Neither is 1:8. So C is not the right answer.

Option D:12 :96; 2 :16.
Simplify each:
- 12:96. As before, GCD is 12. 12/12=1, 96/12=8 → 1:8.
- 2:16. GCD is 2. 2/2=1, 16/2=8 → 1:8.
So both ratios simplify to 1:8, which matches the original ratio of 4:32. So D is the correct answer.

The simplified form of 4:32 is 1:8. Checking each option, only option D's ratios simplify to 1:8.

Answer: D
