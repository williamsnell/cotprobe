Okay, so I have this problem about group theory. The question is about determining the identity element of a group defined by the set of integers Z with a binary operation *. The operation is defined as a * b = a + b + 1 for any a, b in Z. The options are various integers, and I need to find which one is the identity element.

Hmm, I remember that in a group, the identity element e is such that for any element a in the group, a * e = e * a = a. So I need to find an e in Z where applying the * operation with any a leaves a unchanged.

Let me write down the definition: a * e = a + e + 1. And for this to equal a (since e is the identity), the equation would be a + e + 1 = a. Let's simplify that.

Subtract a from both sides: e + 1 = 0. So e = -1. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if this works for all elements a. If a * e = a, then a + (-1) + 1 = a, which simplifies to a + 0 = a, which is correct. Also, e * a would be (-1) + a + 1 = a, which is the same as a * e. So yes, e must be -1.

Looking at the options, option A is -1. So the answer should be A.

The identity element e must satisfy a * e = a for all a in Z. Using the operation definition:

a * e = a + e + 1 = a  
Solving for e:  
e + 1 = 0 â†’ e = -1  

Thus, the identity element is -1, which is option A.
