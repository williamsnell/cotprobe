Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the real exchange rate. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on exchange rates and inflation, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the Indonesian exchange rate changed from 15,000 IDR/USD in 2010 to 14,000 in 2019. So that's a decrease, right? But the question isn't just about the nominal exchange rate; it's about the real exchange rate, which takes inflation into account.

Wait, what's the real exchange rate again? Oh right, it's not just the nominal exchange rate but adjusted for the differences in inflation rates between the two countries. The formula for real exchange rate is usually real exchange rate = nominal exchange rate * (1 + inflation in country B / 1 + inflation in country A). Or is it the other way around? Oh, sometimes it's the other way around. Let me think. If the base period is A, then the formula would adjust based on inflation in the target country compared to the base.

Wait, another way to remember: the real exchange rate accounts for purchasing power differences. So if a country has higher inflation, a unit of their currency buys less. So the formula is real = nominal * (1 + domestic inflation) / (1 + foreign inflation), or something like that.

Wait, I think the correct formula is: Real exchange rate = (Nominal exchange rate) * (1 + domestic inflation rate) / (1 + foreign inflation rate). So when the domestic inflation is higher than foreign, the real exchange rate would increase, meaning that the foreign currency is stronger relative to the domestic. Or wait, maybe not. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's get this straight. The formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate * (1 + Domestic Inflation) / (1 + Foreign Inflation)

Wait, no, I think that's not right. Another approach: If a country has higher inflation, the same basket will cost more, so the real exchange rate would decrease because the purchasing power of the domestic currency is lower. Wait, no, perhaps the other way around. Let me think of an example. Suppose the nominal exchange rate is 1.00 (1 Indonesian Rupiah = 1 USD). If Indonesia has 5% inflation and the US has 10% inflation, what's the real exchange rate?

In this case, the real exchange rate would be 1.00 * (1 + 5%) / (1 + 10%) = 1.00 * 1.05 / 1.10 = 0.9545. So the real exchange rate is 0.9545, meaning that the Indonesian Rupiah is weaker compared to the US dollar because the real exchange rate is lower than 1. So, the real exchange rate is 0.9545. So lower than 1 means domestic currency is weaker.

Wait, but wait, I thought when the US has higher inflation, the real exchange rate would be lower. Let's think about the terms. If the real exchange rate is lower (like 0.9545), that means that the Indonesian Rupiah is more valuable than the US dollar. So the domestic currency is stronger. Because the real exchange rate is the nominal rate adjusted for inflation. So the formula is real exchange rate = (nominal rate) * (domestic inflation / foreign inflation). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate * (1 + Domestic Inflation) / (1 + Foreign Inflation)

Wait no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) / (Inflation in Foreign + 1) * (Inflation in Domestic + 1)

Wait, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe I should think of it as:

In 2010, the exchange rate was 15,000 IDR/USD.

In 2019, it's 14,000. The exchange rate decreased by 1000 (from 15k to 14k). But let's think about inflation.

Indonesia's inflation rose by 5% (to 105), while the US's inflation rose by 10% (to 110). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, wait. The real exchange rate is calculated as:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Domestic Inflation) / (1 + Foreign Inflation)

Wait, but in this case, the base period is 2010: Indonesia's inflation is 5%, and the US's inflation is 10%. So the formula would be:

Real Exchange Rate in 2019 = (2010 Exchange Rate) * (1 + 5%) / (1 + 10%)

Wait, but wait, which country's inflation is the denominator and numerator? Let's think: the real exchange rate is the same as the price levels in the two countries. So, in 2019, the real exchange rate is adjusted for the inflation from 2010 to 2019.

So, the formula is: Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate in 2019) * (Inflation in Indonesia in 2010) / (Inflation in the US in 2010)

Wait, no, that's getting me confused. Let's use the formula from the definition.

The formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Domestic Inflation) / (1 + Foreign Inflation)

Wait, no, the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Domestic Inflation) / (1 + Foreign Inflation).

Wait, but in this setup, perhaps the base period is the US, so we're comparing Indonesia's inflation to the US's. Hmm.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the real exchange rate in 2019 compared to 2010. So 2010 is the base year.

So, the formula would be:

Real Exchange Rate = (2019 Nominal Exchange Rate / 2010 Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + 2010 Inflation) / (1 + 2019 Inflation)

Wait, but 2019's inflation is higher, which would affect the real exchange rate.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the real exchange rate can be thought of as:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation in the country whose currency is being measured) / (1 + Inflation in the base country).

Wait, in this case, the base country is Indonesia, as we're comparing 2019's real exchange rate against 2010.

In 2010, Indonesia's inflation is 5% (so 1.05), and the US's inflation is 10% (1.10).

So the formula would be:

Real Exchange Rate = (2019 Nominal Exchange Rate) * (Indonesia's Inflation) / (US's Inflation)

So,

Real Exchange Rate = 14,000 / (1.10) / 1.05 ?

Wait, no. Wait, no, the formula is: Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate in 2019) * (Indonesia's Inflation) / (US's Inflation) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as:

Real Exchange Rate = (N1) * (1 + i1) / (1 + i2)

But in terms of exchange rate. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = (N1 / N2) * (1 + i1) / (1 + i2)

Where N1 is the nominal exchange rate in year 1, and N2 in year 2, and i1 and i2 are the inflation rates for those years.

So, in our case:

N1 (2010) = 15,000 IDR/USD

N2 (2019) =14,000 IDR/USD

i1 (Indonesia's inflation, 5% or 0.05) and i2 (US's inflation, 10% or 0.10)

So,

Real Exchange Rate = (14,000 / 15,000) * (1 + 0.05) / (1 + 0.10)

Hmm, let's compute that.

First, 14,000 /15,000 = 0.933333...

Then, (1+0.05)=1.05 and (1+0.10)=1.10.

So, 0.933333 * 1.05 = 0.933333 * 1.05 ≈ 0.983333.

Then, divide by 1.10: 0.983333 / 1.10 ≈ 0.893939.

So the real exchange rate is approximately 0.893939.

But wait, the real exchange rate is the ratio of the foreign currency to the domestic currency. So, in 2019, the real exchange rate is about 0.89. That means that the foreign currency (US) has a stronger purchasing power compared to the domestic currency (Indonesia). So, 1 USD buys more IDR than in 2010.

Wait, but the real exchange rate is 0.8939, which is less than 1, meaning that the foreign currency (US) has a stronger currency. So, in terms of the Rupiah, the US dollar can buy more Rupiah, so the Rupiah is weaker.

Wait, but I'm getting a real exchange rate of approximately 0.894. So, the real exchange rate is 0.894. Since 1 USD = 0.894 Rupiah.

Wait, but the question is asking for the real exchange rate. So the answer is approximately 0.894. So which of the options is closest to this?

Looking at the options:

A:14000.00 → That's the nominal rate. Not real.

B:15500 → That's 15,500.00—higher than 14,000. Maybe.

C:15000.00 → Again, the same as N1, not real.

D:16000.00 → Higher.

E:13333.33 → 13,333.33, which is approximately 14,000 * (1 - 5%) / (1 + 10%)? Wait, maybe.

Wait, option E is 13,333.33, which is approximately 14,000 * (0.95/1.10) ≈14,000 * 0.8636 ≈12,090. So that doesn't match.

Option F:14666.67 → That's 14,000 * 1.0476 (approx) → 14,000 * (1.05/1.1) =14,000 * 0.9545 ≈13,363. But wait, that's not 14,000.

Option G:13888.89 → That's approximately 14,000 * (1.05/1.10) =14,000 * 0.9545 → 13,363. So no, not close to 14,000.

Wait, but I'm getting a real exchange rate of approximately 0.894. So the real exchange rate is 0.894, which is 0.894. So the real exchange rate is 1.894 (since 1 / 0.894 ≈1.118) — no, wait, wait. No, the real exchange rate is 0.894, meaning 1 USD buys 0.894 Rupiah, which is weaker in Rupiah.

Wait, the options don't have 0.894. The options are all thousands. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation in Foreign Country) / (1 + Inflation in Domestic Country)

Wait, that might be another way to think about it. Let's try that.

In 2010, Indonesia's inflation is 5% (so 1.05), and the US's inflation is 10% (1.10).

So, Real Exchange Rate = (14,000 /15,000) * (1.10) / (1.05) → 0.933333 * 1.10 = 1.026666. Then divide by 1.05: 1.026666 / 1.05 ≈ 0.977.

Wait, that gives a real exchange rate of approximately 0.977, which is lower. Hmm, but that's still not matching the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps another mistake. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is Real = (N1 / N2) * (1 + i1) / (1 + i2). So,

Real = (14000/15000) * (1.05)/(1.10) → 0.93333 * (0.9545) ≈ 0.8889.

Wait, same as before. So the real exchange rate is approximately 0.8889, which is about 0.89. But none of the options have 0.89.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Options are all thousands, so maybe the real exchange rate is expressed in terms of the Rupiah per USD or something. Wait, but the question is about the real exchange rate, which is a ratio. So the options are all in the same scale as the exchange rates. So in the options, the real exchange rate is a value like 13,333.33 (option E) or 14,666.67 (option F). Which one is closer to our calculation.

Wait, our calculation is approximately 0.8889. But looking at the options, I don't see 0.8889. So perhaps we need to take the inverse.

Wait, but the real exchange rate could also be expressed in terms of the foreign currency per domestic unit. So in this case, 1 USD buys 0.894 Rupiah, which is equivalent to 1/0.894 ≈1.118 Rupiah per USD. So the real exchange rate is 1.118, which is higher than 1. But none of the options match that.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Domestic) / (1 + Inflation Foreign)

Wait, that would be:

14,000 * (1 + 5%) / (1 +10%) → 14,000 * 1.05 / 1.10 → 14,000 * 0.9545 ≈13,363. So option G is 13888.89. That's not exactly 13,363, but closer than the other options.

Wait, but none of the options match exactly. Let me think again. Maybe I should look up the formula.

Wait, alternatively, I've seen the formula expressed as:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Domestic) / (1 + Inflation Foreign)

So in 2019, Indonesia's inflation is 5% (domestic), US's is 10% (foreign). So,

Real Exchange Rate = 14,000 * (1.05) / (1.10) = 14,000 * 0.9545 ≈13,363. So 13,363 is approximately 13,333.33, which is option G.

Wait, but wait, our calculation with the formula gives approximately 13,363, which is option G (13,888.89) is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is the other way around: Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Foreign) / (1 + Inflation Domestic).

Wait, that would be 14,000 * 1.10 / 1.05 → 14,000 * (22/21) → 14,000 * 1.047619 → approximately 14,666.67.

Ah! So that gives 14,666.67, which is option F.

So, if the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (N1) * (1 + i2) / (1 + i1) → where N1 is the base year's nominal rate, and i1 and i2 are the inflation rates of the two countries in their respective years.

So, in our case, N1 is 14,000 (2019), i1 is 5% (Indonesia's inflation rate, which is the same as the base period since we're using 2010 as the base for calculation. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the base period is 2010. So, N1 is 15,000 (2010), and the base year's inflation is 0. So the formula becomes:

Real Exchange Rate = (N1) * (1 + i1) / (1 + i2) → because the base year's inflation is 0.

Wait, let me try this:

In 2010, the real exchange rate is 15,000 / (1 + 0) = 15,000.

In 2019, using the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = 14,000 * (1 + 0.05) / (1 + 0.10) → 14,000 * 1.05 / 1.10 → 14,000 * 0.9545 → ~13,363.

But this is the same as option G (13,888.89) is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (N1) * (1 + i2) / (1 + i1) → which is 14,000 * (1.10)/1.05 → 14,000 * (22/21) ≈14,666.67, which is option F.

Wait, in that case, the formula would be:

Real Exchange Rate = (N1) * (1 + i2) / (1 + i1)

Because we're using 2010 as the base year, so i1 is 0, but in the formula, it's the inflation rate in 2010.

Hmm, perhaps I should refer to the formula as:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Domestic) / (1 + Inflation Foreign)

Wait, no, that can't be because then the real rate would increase if the US has higher inflation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Foreign) / (1 + Inflation Domestic)

That would mean that if the foreign inflation is higher, the real exchange rate would be higher, which makes sense because the domestic currency is stronger.

Wait, let's try that formula.

In 2019, Indonesia's inflation is 5%, US's is 10%.

Real Exchange Rate = (14,000) * (1 + 10%) / (1 + 5%) → 14,000 * 1.10 / 1.05 → 14,000 * 1.047619 → approximately 14,666.67.

Which matches option F.

So, the correct formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Foreign) / (1 + Inflation Domestic)

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic) * (Nominal Exchange Rate)

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic)

But since the exchange rate is given as the ratio (Rupiah/USD), perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Rupiah/USD) * (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic)

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for a more reliable way.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula's denominator and numerator. Let me try to get it right.

The correct formula for the real exchange rate is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Domestic) / (1 + Inflation Foreign)

Wait, no, that would give a higher real exchange rate in the case of higher inflation. Let me test it.

In 2010, Indonesia's inflation is 5%, and the US's is 10%. So, if we use the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = (15,000) * (1 + 5%) / (1 + 10%) → 15,000 * 1.05 / 1.10 → 15,000 * 0.9545 → approximately 14,318.

But that's higher than the previous calculation, which was lower. Hmm, but this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the options given. The options are all in thousands, so 14,000 is option A. 15,000 is option B, etc.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Domestic) / (1 + Inflation Foreign)

So,

Real Exchange Rate =14,000 * (1 +5%)/(1+10%) →14,000 * 1.05/1.10 →14,000 *0.9545 →≈13,363, which is option G (13,888.89) is a bit higher, but perhaps that's the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where the real exchange rate is expressed as:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Foreign) / (1 + Inflation Domestic) → which would be 14,000 * 1.10 /1.05 →14,000 * 1.0476 → ≈14,666.67, which is option F.

But why would that formula be correct? I'm not sure, but perhaps I should follow this because it gives one of the options.

So, using the formula where Real Exchange Rate is given by:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Foreign) / (1 + Inflation Domestic)

So, the real exchange rate is 14,000 * (1 +10%)/(1 +5%) →14,000 * 1.10 /1.05 →14,000 * 1.047619 →≈14,666.67, which is option F.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Domestic) / (1 + Inflation Foreign)

Wait, that can't be right because using 5% in the denominator when the other inflation is 10% would give a higher value. I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with the calculation that gives one of the options.

If I use the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Domestic) / (1 + Inflation Foreign)

So, 14,000 * (1.05)/(1.10) →14,000 * 0.9545 →13,363.33, which is option G (13,888.89) is a bit higher, but close.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate) * (1 + Inflation Foreign) / (1 + Inflation Domestic)

So, 14,000 *1.10 /1.05 →14,000 * 1.0476 →≈14,666.67, which is option F.

But why would the formula be structured that way? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic) * (Nominal Exchange Rate)

But when the Nominal Exchange Rate is the Rupiah per USD, then the formula would be:

Real Exchange Rate = (1/Rupiah per USD) / (1/Rupiah per USD) * (Rupiah/USD) = 1 * (Rupiah/USD). Which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic) * (Nominal Exchange Rate)

But the Price Levels are in the same currency. So, if the Price Levels are in Rupiah, then the formula would be:

Real Exchange Rate = (Rupiah / USD) / (Rupiah / USD) * (Rupiah/USD) →1 * (Rupiah/USD) = Rupiah/USD.

Which is not useful. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the real exchange rate as being the ratio of the foreign currency to the domestic currency, adjusted for inflation.

So, in 2010, the nominal exchange rate is 15,000 Rupiah/USD.

In 2010, the inflation rate is 5% for Indonesia and 10% for the US.

So, the real exchange rate in 2010 is 15,000 / (1 + 0.05) =15,000 /1.05 =14,285.71 Rupiah/USD.

Wait, but that's the real exchange rate in 2010. So, the real exchange rate in 2010 is 14,285.71.

In 2019, the nominal exchange rate is 14,000 Rupiah/USD.

In 2019, the inflation rates are 5% for Indonesia and 10% for the US.

So, the real exchange rate in 2019 would be 14,000 / (1 + 0.10) =14,000 /1.10 =12,727.27 Rupiah/USD.

Wait, so the real exchange rate decreased from 14,285.71 in 2010 to 12,727.27 in 2019, which is a decrease of 1,558.44.

But wait, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the real exchange rate is expressed as:

Real Exchange Rate = (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic) * (Nominal Exchange Rate)

Which would be:

Real Exchange Rate = (1/Rupiah in 2019) / (1/Rupiah in 2010) * (Rupiah/USD in 2010)

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just accept that in 2019, the real exchange rate is approximately 13,363, which is option G. Alternatively, the real exchange rate is approximately 14,666, which is option F.

Wait, but earlier calculations using the formula (14,000 *1.10)/1.05=14,666, which is option F. So perhaps the correct answer is option F.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure which formula is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the real exchange rate is calculated using the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic) * (Nominal Exchange Rate)

But the Price Levels are adjusted for inflation. So,

Price Levels:

Rupiah in 2010: 15,000

Rupiah in 2019: 15,000 / (1 +5%) =15,000 /1.05 =14,285.71

Andus Dollar in 2010:15,000

Andus Dollar in 2019:15,000 / (1 +10%)=15,000 /1.10=13,636.36

So, real exchange rate in 2019 is:

(14,285.71 /13,636.36) *14,000 → roughly 1.046 *14,000=14,666.66.

Which is option F.

So, this approach gives option F, which is 14,666.67.

So, the correct answer is option F.
</think>

To calculate the real exchange rate, we use the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = (Price Level in Foreign) / (Price Level in Domestic) * (Nominal Exchange Rate)

1. **Price Levels**:
   - Rupiah in 2010: 15,000 (nominal exchange rate)
   - Rupiah in 2019: 15,000 / (1 + 5%) = 15,000 / 1.05 ≈ 14,285.71
   - USD in 2010: 15,000 (nominal exchange rate)
   - USD in 2019: 15,000 / (1 + 10%) = 15,000 / 1.10 ≈ 13,636.36

2. **Real Exchange Rate Calculation**:
   - Real Exchange Rate = (14,285.71 / 13,636.36) * 14,000 ≈ (1.046) * 14,000 ≈ 14,666.67

Thus, the real exchange rate is approximately **14,666.67**, which corresponds to option F.

ANSWER: F
