Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, so the problem is about calculating the term of a discounted note. Let me read it again.

The customer paid $500 note on April 25, and the note was dated March 1. It must be paid within 3 months. Wait, but it's asking about the term of discount. So I think the term refers to the time allowed for payment, which is 3 months. But wait, the options given are all days, which suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the question. The note was on March 1, and James Parcer discounted it on April 25. The note is to be paid within 3 months of the day it was issued. Oh, wait, maybe the term of discount is the period within which the customer has to settle, and that's 3 months. But 3 months in days is 90 days. But none of the options is 90. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the term of discount is the time between the discounting date and the original due date. Because the note was to be paid within 3 months, but the discounting was on April 25. So the term of discount would be the time from April 25 to the due date, which is March 1 plus 3 months. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The note was issued on March 1. It's due within 3 months, so March 1 + 3 months is June 1? Or wait, 3 months from March 1 is June 1. So the due date is June 1.

But James Parcer discounted the note on April 25. So the discount period is from April 25 to June 1. How many days is that?

Let me calculate the days from April 25 to June 1.

April has 30 days. So from April 25 to April 30 is 5 days (25,26,27,28,29,30). Then May has 31 days. June 1 is the first day. So total days: 5 + 31 +1 (since June 1 is included) = 37 days? Wait, wait, no. Wait, from April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (since 25 is the starting day, that's 0, then 25,26,27,28,29,30: 6 days). Then May has 31 days. June 1 is the next day. So total is 6 +31 +1 = 38 days. But looking at the options, B is 37 days, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me list the days:

April 25: day 0.

Then April 26: 1.

April 27: 2.

April 28: 3.

April 29:4.

April 30:5.

May 1:6.

May 2:7.

...

May 31: 36 (since 5 +31=36).

June 1:37 days.

So the term of discount is 37 days, which is option B.

Wait, but the note was due in 3 months (June 1), and the discount was taken on April 25. So the discount period is 37 days. So the term of discount is 37 days, which is option B.

The term of discount is the period during which the note can be paid before its due date. The note was discounted on April 25 and must be paid within 3 months, which ends on June 1. To calculate the exact term, count the days from April 25 to June 1:

- April 25 to April 30: 6 days (including April 25)
- May: 31 days
- June 1: 1 day

Total: 6 + 31 + 1 = 38 days. However, the closest option provided is 37 days (option B), which aligns with this count.

Answer: B
