Question:

What is the CPI ? How is it different from the MMPI ?

Options:

A: CPI stands for Clinical Psychopathy Index, a variant of the MMPI
B: CPI is a clinical tool for diagnosing mental illnesses

D: The CPI is a projective test that measures subconscious traits, while the MMPI is an objective test
E: CPI is primarily used for educational testing, whereas MMPI is used in clinical psychology

G: The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) is an objective personality inventory developed for use with less clinical less deviant groups of subjects than the MMPI.
H: CPI is used to measure gross psychopathy
I: CPI and MMPI are the same
J: CPI is a newer version of the MMPI with updated scales and norms

Okay, so I need to figure out what the CPI is and how it's different from the MMPI. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two psychological assessments. 

The MMPI stands for California Mental Examination for Specific Interventions, right? It's a personality inventory, so it measures things like openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. I remember it's often used in clinical settings because it's scored objectively, which means it can give consistent results across different people. It's also designed for subjects who might be diagnosed with specific mental health issues, like those with borderline personality traits or severe depression. So, it's particularly suited for cases where the individual needs a tailored approach.

Now, the CPI, which stands for Clinical Psychopathy Index, I'm not as familiar with. I think it's another inventory, but I believe it's more for diagnosing mental illnesses rather than measuring personality traits. Wait, what's the difference between these two? The key word here is "Clinical" vs. "Personality." The MMPI is about personality, so it's used for assessing someone's general mental health, not specific symptoms. 

Looking at the options, option G says that the CPI is an objective personality inventory, but that doesn't sound right because I think the CPI is more for clinical purposes. The California Psychological Inventory is similar to the MMPI but is designed for borderline cases, whereas the CPI is more for diagnosing specific disorders. So option G might be incorrect because it's describing the wrong inventory.

Option B says CPI is a clinical tool for diagnosing mental illnesses. That makes sense because I remember reading that the CPI is used in clinical settings to identify individuals with specific mental health issues, especially borderline cases. It's more about diagnosing rather than measuring personality traits.

Option C claims that CPI is a cognitive test and unlike MMPI which assesses personality. Hmm, if the MMPI is more about personality, while the CPI is about diagnosing something specific, that seems correct. But looking back, I think the CPI is more about assessing mental disorders, so maybe C is correct, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Option D says CPI is a projective test measuring subconscious traits, while MMPI is an objective test. Projective tests assess unconscious thoughts and feelings, which the CPI does, but MMPI is more about personality, which is an objective measure. So that seems correct. But I'm not sure if both are projective, though.

Option E suggests CPI is for education and MMPI for clinical psychology. That doesn't seem right. Both are used in clinical settings, so E is likely incorrect.

Option F talks about inflation measurement, which is unrelated. The CPI is a statistic used to measure price changes, not a test. So F is incorrect.

Option J says CPI is a newer version of MMPI. I don't think so. The CPI is a different assessment, so J is probably wrong.

Option I says they're the same. No, they're different. One is for personality, the other for clinical diagnosis.

Option D says CPI is a projective test for subconscious traits, while MMPI is objective. So that's a correct statement. But wait, the question is about how they are different. So the primary difference isn't about being projective vs. objective, but about their purposes. The question is about their difference. So the main point is that one is for clinical diagnosis and the other measures personality.

Wait, what's the main difference? Maybe the primary difference is what they assess: personality vs. clinical diagnosis. Let me think about the options. Option D seems to capture that: the CPI is a projective test, assessing subconscious traits, whereas MMPI is an objective test measuring personality.

Option C says CPI is a cognitive test unlike MMPI which assesses personality. But I think the MMPI assesses personality objectively, while the CPI is for clinical purposes. So C could be correct, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, another angle. The MMPI is a battery of tests used to assess personality traits, while the CPI is used for specific mental illnesses. So the main difference is their purpose. So the correct answer would be D, which states that the CPI is a projective test (for assessing subconscious traits) while the MMPI is an objective test (measuring personality).

Wait, but looking back, the options. The question is about how they are different. The options are:

D: CPI is a projective test, MMPI is an objective test.

Yes, that seems to directly address the main difference in their purposes.

So the correct answer should be D. Because one is for psychological disorders, the other for personality.
</think>

The correct answer is D: The CPI is a projective test that measures subconscious traits, while the MMPI is an objective test. 

**Explanation:**
The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) is a tool designed for diagnosing mental illnesses, particularly borderline cases, and focuses on assessing subconscious traits. In contrast, the MMPI is an objective personality inventory used to measure general mental health traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. The key difference lies in their purposes: one is for clinical diagnosis, and the other is for assessing personality. 

**Answer:** D
