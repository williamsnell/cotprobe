Okay, so I've got this gas volume problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about finding the volume that a 0.17 grams sample of H2S gas will occupy at 27°C and 380 torr. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when calculating the volume of a gas, the ideal gas law is super important. The formula is PV = nRT. Right, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, wait, but I also remember that sometimes the gas constant R is expressed in different units. Oh right, sometimes people use 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when pressure is in atm. Or perhaps another value. Let me think, the units for pressure here are given in torr, so I should probably convert that to atm because the R I'm using is in atm.

Oh right, 1 atm is 760 torr, so 380 torr divided by 760 would give me the pressure in atm. Let me calculate that: 380 / 760 = 0.5 atm. Okay, so P is 0.5 atm.

The temperature is 27°C. Oh wait, when using the gas law, I need temperature in Kelvin, so I add 273.15. So 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K. I can approximate that as 300 K for simplicity unless more precision is needed.

Now, I need to find the number of moles, n. The mass given is 0.17 grams. H2S has a molar mass I should find. Hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol, and sulfur is about 32.07 g/mol. So H2S would be 2*(1.008) + 32.07 = 2.016 +32.07=34.086 g/mol. So n = mass / molar mass = 0.17 g / 34.086 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.17 divided by 34.086. Hmm, 34.086 is roughly 34. So 0.17 /34 is 0.005, but I'll get the exact calculation.

Wait, 0.17 / 34.086 equals approximately 0.004989 mol. Let me do it more accurately. 34.086 is about 34.086. 0.17 divided by 34.086. Let's compute it: 0.17 ÷ 34.086 ≈ 0.004989 mol. So n ≈ 0.004989 mol.

Now, putting it all into the ideal gas law. V = nRT / P.

So V = (0.004989 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * (300 K) / 0.5 atm.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, n * R = 0.004989 * 0.0821. Let me calculate that.

0.004989 * 0.0821 ≈ let's compute:

0.004989 * 0.08 = 0.00039912
0.004989 * 0.0021 = approx 0.0000104769
Adding them: 0.00039912 + 0.0000104769 ≈ 0.0004095969 ≈ 0.0004096.

Then multiply by T (300 K): 0.0004096 * 300 = 0.12288 liters.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think I messed up the order. The formula is V = (nRT)/P. So nRT is (0.004989) * (0.0821) * (300). Let me recompute.

Wait, let me compute nRT:

n = 0.004989
R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T=300 K.

nRT = 0.004989 * 0.0821 * 300.

Compute 0.004989 * 300 = 1.4967.

Then multiply by 0.0821: 1.4967 * 0.0821.

Let me compute 1 * 0.0821 is 0.0821, 0.4967 * 0.0821.

Wait, 1.4967 is approximately 1.5. So 1.5 * 0.0821 is 0.12315. But more accurately, 1.4967 * 0.0821.

Let's compute:

1.4967 * 0.08 = 0.119736
1.4967 * 0.0021 = 0.00314277
Adding together: 0.119736 + 0.00314277 = 0.12287877. So approximately 0.122879 L·atm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should not approximate yet. Let me compute more accurately.

nRT = (0.004989 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * (300 K)

Multiply 0.004989 * 0.0821 first. Let's compute 0.004989 * 0.0821:

0.004989 * 0.08 = 0.00039912
0.004989 * 0.0021 = 0.0000104769
Adding them: 0.00039912 + 0.0000104769 = 0.0004095969.

So 0.0004095969 mol·L·atm/(mol·K) * K = 0.0004095969 L·atm.

Then multiply by T=300 K: 0.0004095969 * 300 = 0.122879 L·atm.

Now divide by P which is 0.5 atm: V = (0.122879 L·atm) / 0.5 atm = 0.245758 liters.

Hmm, about 0.24576 liters. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A: 2.50 liters
B:34.06
C:0.005
D:0.100
E:0.500
F:1.00
G:0.246 (close)
H:5
I:0.030
J:0.750

Wait, option G is 0.246. So our calculation is approximately 0.2458, which would round to 0.246 liters. So option G is 0.246 liters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the R constant as 0.0821, but wait, did I make a mistake in the units? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should think about using R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). That's correct. So the calculation steps seem right. So the volume is approximately 0.246 liters, which is option G.

To determine the volume of a 0.17 g sample of H₂S gas at 27°C and 380 torr, the ideal gas law is applied: 

**PV = nRT**, where:
- \( P = 380 \, \text{torr} = \frac{380}{760} \, \text{atm} = 0.5 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( T = 27^\circ \text{C} = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \approx 300 \, \text{K} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \),
- \( n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{0.17}{34.086} \approx 0.004989 \, \text{mol} \).

Substituting into the formula:
\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(0.004989)(0.0821)(300)}{0.5} = \frac{0.122879}{0.5} = 0.24576 \, \text{L}.
\]

The closest option to this value is **0.246 liters**, which corresponds to option **G**.
