Okay, so I have this question about functions between two finite sets. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is: Given two finite sets A and B with m and n elements respectively, how many distinct functions map A into B?

Wait, what's a function from A to B? Oh right, a function assigns each element of A to exactly one element of B. So for each element in A, there's a choice in B. Since A has m elements, each one can independently choose any element from B.

So for the first element in A, I can map it to any of the n elements in B. Then the second element also has n choices, and this continues for all m elements. So the total number of functions should be the product of n choices m times. That would be n multiplied by itself m times, which is n^m.

Looking at the options, option I is n^m, which matches my reasoning. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A is m^n. Hmm, wait, that's not right. Because m is the size of set A and n is the size of B. If it's m^n, that would mean each of the n elements in B can map back to m elements in A, but that's not what a function from A to B does. Functions go from A to B, so the exponent should be m, the size of A.

Option B is n! / m!. That seems like a combination, but that's not about functions. It's about permutations if m is less than n, but functions are more straightforward.

Option C is (n + m)!. That's the factorial of the sum, which doesn't make sense here. You can't add the sizes of the sets and take the factorial for functions.

Option D is m! / (m -n)!. That looks like a permutation if m >n, but again, that's about arrangements, not functions.

Option E is n! / (n - m)!. That's the permutation formula for selecting m elements from n. But functions involve assigning each of the m elements, not combinations.

Option F has m! / (n! (m -n)! ). That looks more like the binomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to choose m elements from n, but again, not functions.

Option G is n!. That's the number of permutations of B's elements, but functions are from A to B, not permutations of B.

Option H is m! / n!. Hmm, that's the same as option F but with m and n swapped. Doesn't fit.

Option I is n^m. Yes, that's exactly what I thought. Each of the m elements in A has n choices in B.

Option J is n! / [n - m)! ]. Wait, that's the permutation formula for selecting n -m elements from n, but that doesn't make sense here.

So the correct answer is option I: n^m.

The number of distinct functions from set A to set B, where A has m elements and B has n elements, is n^m. This is because each of the m elements in A can be mapped to any of the n elements in B independently.

Answer: I: n^m
