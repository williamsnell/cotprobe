Okay, so I have this question about convex sets and their enlargements. Let me try to break it down. The question is whether S_a is convex when S is convex. 

First, I remember that a convex set is one where, for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely within the set. So S is convex.

Now, S_a is defined as all points x where the distance from x to S is less than or equal to a. The distance here is the infimum of the distances from x to any point in S. So, S_a is like all points within a distance a from S. 

I think S_a is called the epsilon-neighborhood or Minkowski sum of S with a ball of radius a. But wait, Minkowski sum is S + B(a), where B(a) is a ball of radius a. So, S is convex, and B(a) is also convex because it's a ball. The sum of two convex sets is convex, right? So S + B(a) should be convex.

Wait, but the distance function defines a specific kind of neighborhood. For each point in S, you have a ball around it, and S_a is the union of all those balls. So, if I take any two points in S_a, say x and y, their midpoint is also in S_a because the midpoint is within a of both x and y, which are a distance a from S. So, the midpoint would be within a + a = 2a? Wait, no. Wait, no, the distance from the midpoint to S would be at most half the distance from x to y. Since x and y are each within a of S, the distance between them is at most 2a. So their midpoint is at most a distance of (2a)/2 = a from S. So the midpoint is in S_a.

Wait, but is that always true? Let me think. If S is convex, then for any two points x and y in S, the line segment xy is in S. But S_a includes all points within a of S. So for S_a, the distance from any point in S_a to S is at most a. 

Let me consider two points u and v in S_a. Then their distance to S is ≤ a each. Since S is convex, the point (u + v)/2 is in S_a because the distance to S is at most (distance u to S + distance v to S)/2, which is ≤ a. So yes, the midpoint is in S_a.

So S_a is convex. Therefore, the answer should be 1.0, which is option D.
</think>

The set \( S_a \) is the set of all points within a distance \( a \) from \( S \), defined as \( S_a = \{ x \mid \text{dist}(x, S) \leq a \} \). Since \( S \) is convex and the distance function preserves convexity, \( S_a \) must also be convex. 

Answer: D.0.0 (No, it's 1.0, so the correct option is D.)

Answer: D.0.0

Wait, no. The options are A: Undefined, B: 0.0, C: None of the above, D: 1.0. I concluded it's D, which is 1.0.
