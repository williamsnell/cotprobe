Okay, so I need to find out what percentage of the global population was literate in 1950. The options given are A to J, with various percentages. I remember that the global literacy rate has changed over time, so I should look for the specific data from 1950.

I think literacy rates in the 60s and 70s were still high, but maybe not as high as the 80s. I recall that in the 1950s, many countries had decent education systems, but there were still some people without access to education, especially in poorer areas. 

Wait, I'm trying to remember if I've heard that in 1950, the literacy rate was around 80% or something like that. But I'm not sure. Another angle is that in some parts of the world, like the Far East, literacy rates were higher. Oh, but the question is about the global rate, so I need to think globally.

I think the 1950s had some issues with literacy. Maybe the literacy rate was around 70-80%? Let me think about specific countries. For example, in the United States, literacy rates were improving, but many still didn't have access to formal education. In some developing countries, the literacy rates were higher, but not as high as 90%.

Looking at the options, option E is 86%, which seems high but possible. Option J is 106%, which is impossible because a percentage can't exceed 100. Option A is 66%, which is lower than I thought. Option B is 96%, that seems too high. Option C is 56%, lower than B. Option D is 16%, which is way too low. Option F is 26%, still low. Option G is 76%, which is close to what I was thinking. Option H is 46%, lower. Option I is 106%, invalid. Option J is 36%, which is lower.

Wait, I'm a bit torn. I thought the global literacy rate in 1950 was around 80%, so 86% might make sense. But I'm not entirely certain. I think I've heard that in some countries, like China, the literacy rates were high, but overall, the global average was lower. Or maybe it's more about the average, not the per-country rates.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, 86%, because it's a commonly cited figure for literacy rates around that time. I'm not 100% sure, but I think 86% is the most plausible among the options given.
