Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an automobile accelerating, and I need to figure out how far it travels during the acceleration. Let's see... I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the car is going 30 miles per hour and then accelerates to 60 miles per hour in 10 seconds. The question is, how far does it go during that time. The options are given, but I'm just going to think through it.

First, I should probably convert the speeds from miles per hour to something more manageable, maybe feet per second, since the answer options include feet. Wait, but I don't know if that's necessary yet. Alternatively, maybe I can work with the same units throughout. Hmm, but let's see.

Wait, but let's consider what formula I need here. Since it's uniform acceleration, I think the equation for distance under constant acceleration is s = ut + (1/2) a t². Where u is the initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Or wait, sometimes the equation is s = v_avg * t, where v_avg is the average velocity. Oh right, since acceleration is uniform, the average velocity is the average of the initial and final velocities.

So initial velocity u = 30 mi/hr. Final velocity v = 60 mi/hr. Time t = 10 sec. Wait, but the units are in miles per hour. I need to convert these to feet per second or meters per second, but maybe I can do it in the same units. Hmm, wait, maybe I should first convert the speeds to ft/s.

Wait, 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 30 mi/hr is 30 * 5280 ft / 3600 sec. Let me calculate that.

30 * 5280 = 158400 ft. Divided by 3600 seconds: 158400 / 3600 = 44 ft/s. So 30 mi/hr is 44 ft/s.

Similarly, 60 mi/hr is 60 * 5280 = 316800 ft. Divided by 3600: 316800 / 3600 = 88 ft/s. So the final velocity is 88 ft/s.

So initial velocity u =44 ft/s, final v=88 ft/s, time t=10 sec.

Now, I can find the average velocity. For uniform acceleration, the average velocity is (u + v)/2. So that's (44 + 88)/2 = 132/2 = 66 ft/s.

Then, distance is average velocity multiplied by time: 66 ft/s * 10 s = 660 ft. So looking at the options, E is 660 ft.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should use the equation s = ut + 0.5 a t².

I can find the acceleration a. Since a = (v - u)/t = (88 - 44)/10 = 44/10 =4.4 ft/s². Then, plug into the equation.

s = (44)(10) + 0.5 * 4.4 * (10)^2.

Calculating each term: 44 *10 =440. 0.5 *4.4=2.2. 2.2 * 100 (10 squared) =220.

Adding 440 +220 = 660. Same result. So the distance is 660 ft, which is option E.

To determine how far the automobile travels during its acceleration, we use the formula for distance under uniform acceleration: 

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

First, convert the initial and final velocities from miles per hour (mi/hr) to feet per second (ft/s):

- Initial velocity, \( u = 30 \, \text{mi/hr} = 44 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Final velocity, \( v = 60 \, \text{mi/hr} = 88 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Time, \( t = 10 \, \text{sec} \)

Next, calculate the acceleration \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{v - u}{t} = \frac{88 - 44}{10} = 4.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

Now, substitute \( u \), \( a \), and \( t \) into the distance formula:

\[
s = (44)(10) + \frac{1}{2} (4.4)(10)^2
\]
\[
s = 440 + \frac{1}{2} (4.4)(100)
\]
\[
s = 440 + 220 = 660 \, \text{ft}
\]

Thus, the automobile travels **660 feet** during the time of acceleration. The correct answer is **E: 660 ft**.
