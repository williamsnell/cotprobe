Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about Mr. James and his investment choices. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

Mr. James is in the 50% income tax bracket. He has two options: buy corporate bonds that yield 8% interest or municipal bonds that yield 4.5%. The question is asking which investment is wiser. The options are A to J, each with different possibilities.

Alright, I need to figure out which investment is better for him. Let's break this down. 

First, corporate bonds. They're generally considered to be riskier because their interest payments are taxable. So, Mr. James would have to pay income tax on that 8% yield. That means his after-tax return would be lower. Let's do a quick calculation. If he holds the bond until it matures, his taxable interest income would be 8%. Since he's in a 50% tax bracket, he'd pay 4% tax. So his after-tax return would be 8% minus 4%, which is 4%. But wait, if he holds it until the end, the yield would be 4%. But if he holds it for a while, maybe he can reinvest in other taxable income or get a capital gain, which might give him more gains. But I think the corporate bonds' yield is already after tax, so maybe not. So, after tax, corporate bonds would give him 4% (since 8% * 50% tax rate is 4% tax, leaving him 4% interest). 

Municipal bonds, on the other hand, are different. If the municipality is tax-exempt, then the interest from the bond isn't subject to income tax. So, Mr. James would get full 4.5% interest each year without paying any taxes on that income. Plus, if the municipality is tax-exempt, they might also pay state taxes, depending on where they're located. But the question mentions that the municipal bonds yield 4.5%, and it doesn't specify any additional tax benefits beyond what's already provided. So, perhaps the 4.5% is the only yield, and no state taxes are added. So, his after-tax return would still be 4.5% because the interest is tax-free.

Wait, but does the municipal bonds offer any other benefits beyond just the interest and state taxes? Because the question says he can choose between two options, but it's possible that some municipal bonds might have other features, like being exempt from certain states' taxes. But the question doesn't mention that. So, in that case, the 4.5% is the only after-tax return.

Now comparing the two. Corporate bonds after taxes give him 4%, while municipal bonds give him 4.5%. He's in a 50% tax bracket, so 4.5% is higher than 4%. So, if he wants the highest after-tax return, he should choose the municipal bonds. But wait, what if he's considering holding them for a longer period? If the interest is taxable, then the yield would be taxed. But if the interest is tax-free, then it's better. So, if he's a municipal investor, he might prefer the 4.5% yield without tax, unless he can reinvest in other taxable income, which would complicate things.

Wait, but the question says he can either buy corporate bonds which yield 8% or municipal bonds which yield 4.5%. So, the corporate option is subject to income tax, while the municipal is tax-exempt. So, the corporate bonds would be after-tax to 4% (since 8% * 50% = 4%).

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-clarify. Corporate bonds typically have a higher risk, so their interest is taxable. So, if you invest in corporate bonds, the after-tax interest would be 8% * (1 - 50%) = 4%. If you invest in municipal bonds, since they're tax-exempt, the after-tax interest is 4.5%, as there's no tax on that.

So, in terms of after-tax yield, the municipal bonds give a higher return. Therefore, for Mr. James, the better investment is the municipal bonds.

Looking at the options, option D says "municipal bonds." So, that's probably the right choice.

Wait, but another point: are there any other factors? For example, does the municipal bonds offer any state or local taxes beyond what's already tax-exempt? But the question doesn't mention that, so the 4.5% is the only yield. So, the 4.5% is better than 4% from corporate bonds.

So, D is the correct answer.

Mr. James is considering between two investment options: corporate bonds yielding 8% or municipal bonds yielding 4.5%. Corporate bonds are taxable, so his after-tax return would be 4%, while municipal bonds are tax-exempt, giving him 4.5%. Since he is in a 50% income tax bracket, the municipal bonds offer a higher return. Therefore, the wiser investment is the municipal bonds.

Answer: D
