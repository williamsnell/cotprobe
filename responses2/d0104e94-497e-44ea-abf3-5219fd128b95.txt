Okay, so I need to figure out which character from The Friends show is a chef. Let me start by recalling the show's main characters and their roles.

The show has a team of friends, each with a distinct personality. Joey, Rachel, Richard, Janice, Phoebe, Monica, Chandler, Ross, and Emily are the main characters. I remember that each has their own job and some interesting quirks.

From what I remember, Joey is the house captain, responsible for the show's logistics and interactions. Rachel is the hostess, handling the show's appearance and catering. Richard is the sous chef, which would mean he's involved in cooking. Monika, I think, was the sous chef, but wait, the options don't include Monica as the hostess. Let me check again.

Wait, no, the options given are Joey, Rachel, Richard, Janice, Phoebe, Monica, Chandler, Gunther, Ross, and Emily. So we're looking for someone who is definitely a chef.

Joey is the captain but not the chef. Rachel is the hostess, so she's not a chef. Richard is a chef, right? Because he's part of the team and works in the kitchen. Monica was also a chef, but she's not one of the main characters listed here. Chandler is the cook, so he's definitely a chef.

Wait, let me make sure. The show's characters include Monica as the hostess, but she's not part of the main cast. Chandler is the cook, yes, so he's a chef. So among the options given, Chandler is the one who is a chef.

The correct answer is Chandler, as he is the cook and thus a chef. 

Answer: G: Chandler
