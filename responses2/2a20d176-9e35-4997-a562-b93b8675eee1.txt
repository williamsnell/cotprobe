Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the diamond structure of elemental carbon. Hmm, I remember that the diamond structure is a type of crystal structure. Let me think about what I learned in chemistry class.

Wait, in the diamond structure, each carbon atom has four nearest neighbors. But how are they arranged? I think each carbon is surrounded by four others. So I need to figure out what shape those four atoms form when they're near a central carbon.

Option D is pentagon, but wait, a pentagon would have five points, which doesn't make sense because a carbon can't have five neighbors. So maybe that's not it.

Option E is hexagon. A hexagon has six sides. That doesn't sound right either. I'm not sure about that.

Looking at the options, the question is about the nearest neighbors being at the corners of which shape. So each carbon is connected to four other carbons. I remember something about tetrahedral geometry. Oh right, in diamond structure, the arrangement is tetrahedral. Each carbon is connected to four others, forming a tetrahedron around it.

Wait, but the question is about the nearest neighbors lying at the corners of which shape. So each atom has four others, so the corners of a tetrahedron. So the shape is a tetrahedron, which is one of the options.

Looking at the options again: option I is tetrahedron. So the correct answer should be I, tetrahedron.

The diamond structure of elemental carbon has each carbon atom with four nearest neighbors arranged in a tetrahedral geometry. These neighbors are located at the corners of a tetrahedron.

Answer: I: tetrahedron
