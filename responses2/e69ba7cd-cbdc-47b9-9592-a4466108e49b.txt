Question:

A cylinder with a movable piston contains a gas at pressure P = 1 × 10^5 Pa, volume V = 20 cm^3, and temperature T = 273 K. The piston is moved downward in a slow steady fashion allowing heat to escape the gas and the temperature to remain constant. If the final volume of the gas is 5 cm^3, what will be the resulting pressure?

Options:

A: 6 × 10^5 Pa
B: 9 × 10^5 Pa
C: 3 × 10^5 Pa
D: 5 × 10^5 Pa
E: 0.25 × 10^5 Pa
F: 1 × 10^5 Pa
G: 8 × 10^5 Pa
H: 4 × 10^5 Pa
I: 7 × 10^5 Pa
J: 2 × 10^5 Pa

Okay, so I've got this problem about a gas in a cylinder. Let me try to figure it out. The problem says that the gas is at a certain pressure, volume, and temperature. The piston is moved slowly, allowing heat to escape and the temperature to stay constant. The final volume is smaller, and I need to find the resulting pressure.

Hmm, wait. Oh right, the temperature is constant. Oh, that's important. So this is probably an isothermal process. But wait, the process isn't reversible, right? Because the piston is moving slowly and steadily, and heat is escaping. Wait, but the temperature remains constant. So the process is isothermal.

In an isothermal process, the pressure and volume are related by the equation PV = nRT. Since the temperature is constant, the product PV remains the same. 

Let me think about the initial and final states. Initial state: P1 = 1e5 Pa, V1 = 20 cm³. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the volume is 20 cm³. Oh, but the pressure is given as 1e5 Pa. Oh, and the temperature is 273 K.

The final volume is 5 cm³, and we're to find the final pressure P2. Since the process is isothermal, P1 V1 = P2 V2.

Wait, let me write that down: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So solving for P2: P2 = (P1 V1) / V2.

Plugging in the numbers: P1 is 1e5 Pa, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 5 cm³.

So P2 = (1e5 * 20) / 5 = (2e6) / 5 = 4e5 Pa.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1e5 is 100,000. 100,000 * 20 = 2,000,000. Divide by 5 gives 400,000 Pa, which is 4e5 Pa. So that's 4 × 10^5 Pa. Looking at the options, option H is 4 × 10^5 Pa. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. The process is a slow, steady movement, allowing heat to escape. Oh, but in an isothermal process, the temperature doesn't change, which matches here. So I think this is correct. Oh, but wait, wait, the piston is moving and the volume is decreasing. So the system is doing work on the surroundings, and heat is escaping, which would cause the pressure to increase, right? Because the gas is expanding into vacuum, but in this case, the volume is decreasing.

Wait, but in an isothermal expansion, the pressure would decrease. Oh wait, wait a minute! Wait, no, wait. Wait, when the piston moves down, the volume decreases, so the system is doing work on the surroundings. For an ideal gas in an isothermal expansion, the pressure decreases. But in this problem, the volume is decreasing, but the temperature is constant. Wait, I thought it's isothermal, so that's correct.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me think about the formula again. Oh, no, because PV = constant. So if volume decreases, pressure increases. So if the volume is halved (from 20 to 5), the pressure would double. Because 20 * 1e5 = P2 *5. So 20e5 = 5 P2 → P2 = 4e5. So yes, according to that, the pressure would be 4e5 Pa. So option H.

But wait, the question says the process is slow and steady, allowing heat to escape. That's a bit confusing. Because in a slow process, the system doesn't do much work, so maybe the system's internal energy doesn't change much, but since temperature is constant, it's isothermal. Wait, but the process is isothermal regardless, because temp is constant. So the pressure would adjust to keep temp the same as the process continues.

Wait, but in this case, the volume is decreasing, so the pressure would increase, since P = nRT/V. As V decreases, if T is constant, P would increase. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but another thought: what if instead, the process was isothermal but the pressure was changing due to the movement of the piston, but the process is slow so the surroundings can't do much work. Hmm, I think the initial approach using PV=constant is still valid because the process is isothermal, regardless of the mechanism of heating or cooling.

So the correct answer is H: 4 × 10^5 Pa.

To solve the problem, we recognize that the process is isothermal since the temperature remains constant at 273 K. For an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, the relationship between pressure and volume is given by:

\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
\]

Here, the initial pressure is \( P_1 = 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), the initial volume is \( V_1 = 20 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and the final volume is \( V_2 = 5 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2} = \frac{(1 \times 10^5) \times 20}{5} = \frac{2 \times 10^6}{5} = 4 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Thus, the resulting pressure is \( 4 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: \( 4 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \)**.
