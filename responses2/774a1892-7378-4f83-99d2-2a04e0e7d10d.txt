Alright, so I'm looking at this question about aesthetics and trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is: "Aesthetics deals with objects that are_____." The options are A through J, each with different descriptions. I need to pick the one that's correct.

First, what do I remember about aesthetics? Aesthetics is the study of what looks good, right? It's about the visual quality and appeal of objects. So it's more about the subjective experience of beauty than the material properties.

Looking at the options:

A: Not essential to existence. Hmm, aesthetics is about beauty, which is human-made. So I don't think it's essential for survival or existence. Probably not A.

B: Frequently used in daily life. Wait, isn't aesthetics more about what we find visually appealing? Like, people use things in their daily lives because they're part of their aesthetic sense. So B might be a candidate. But I'm not sure.

C: Not visible to the human eye. No, that's not about aesthetics. aesthetics is more about what we see. So C is probably wrong.

D: Only appreciated by experts. I don't think so. People use things in their daily lives because they appreciate them, but experts might find certain things more beautiful. So D doesn't seem right.

E: Universally liked. That's a bit broad. While some objects are universally liked, aesthetics is about what we like, so it's subjective. So E might not be the best answer.

F: Unimportant to most people. No, I don't think aesthetics is something people rarely care about. It's a part of our daily experiences.

G: Essential for survival. Wait, survival is a basic need, but aesthetics isn't directly linked to survival. It's more about beauty and pleasure. So G might not be the right choice.

H: Essential to our existence. Yes, because aesthetics is a part of what we perceive as our existence. So this seems correct.

I: Rarely viewed. No, because we use things all the time based on our aesthetic preferences.

J: Universally disliked. No, that's the opposite of what aesthetics is about. It's not about being disliked; it's about what we like.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: essential to our existence. Aesthetics deals with objects that are essential to our existence because it's the way we perceive beauty and pleasure, which are part of our daily experiences and existence.
