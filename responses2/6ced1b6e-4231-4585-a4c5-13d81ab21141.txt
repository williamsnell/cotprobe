Question:

A previously healthy 40-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of constant substernal chest pain for 12 hours that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?

Options:

A: Pulmonary alveoli
B: Aortic intima
C: Myocardium
D: Cardiac valves
E: Vascular endothelium
F: Esophageal sphincter
G: Pleural membrane
H: Tracheal tissue
I: Bronchial epithelium
J: Pericardium

Okay, so I've got this medical question here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a 40-year-old man who's had chest pain for 12 hours. He's got a temperature of 38°C, which is quite high, and his blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation, which usually points to bundle branch blocks, but I'm not entirely sure. His lungs are clear, and the x-ray is normal. The problem is with the last character of my answer, so I have to focus on that.

The question is asking which tissue is likely injured. The options are from A to J, each a different tissue. So, let's break down the information.

First, the patient has chest pain for 12 hours, which is a lot. The pain is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. When he sits up and leans forward, the pain goes away. His temperature is 38°C, which is a bit high but not necessarily a fever. His pulse is 120/min, which is a normal adult rate. Blood pressure is 110/60, which is within normal range.

The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in all leads. ST-segment elevation is a sign of bundle branch blocks. So, that suggests something related to the heart, maybe a conduction block in the aorta or a branch artery.

Looking at the possible options:

A: Pulmonary alveoli — These are small air sacs in the lungs. If he had any, it would show up in the lungs, but the question mentions clear lungs, so probably not the alveoli.

B: Aortic intima — The aorta is the major artery. If there was a conduction blockage in the aorta, the ST-segment would be seen on the A lead. But the patient's ECG shows ST-segment elevation in all leads, which points to the heart, not the aorta. Unless it's a bundle branch, but the aortic branch is the aorta, which I don't think causes ST-segment elevation.

C: Myocardium — Myocardial ST-segment elevation is seen in cases of bundle branch blocks. So, if the aorta has a blockage, this is a possibility.

D: Cardiac valves — These cause ST-segment elevation, but the patient's ST-segment is elevated in all leads, which is more indicative of a bundle branch block in the aorta or another heart-related cause. But wait, the x-ray is normal. So, if he had a valve issue, the x-ray might show something else, like a stenosis. But the question says the x-ray is normal, so maybe the main issue is a bundle branch block, which is an aortic or pulmonary issue.

E: Vascular endodermal (esophageal sphincter) — That's the esophagus's sphincter. No indication of that in the question.

F: Pleural membrane — If he had a pleural effusion, the chest would show signs, but the ECG and x-ray are normal. So probably not.

G: Tracheal tissue — If the trachea was injured, the chest would show a Thrombophrenic sign. But the chest pain is described, so maybe not a Thrombophrenic? Or perhaps the injury is in the neck, like a muscle strain or nerve damage. But the options given don't include that.

H: Bronchial epithelium — If the Bronchial epithelium had a blockage, that could cause chest pain. But the presence of ST-segment elevation suggests something in the heart, not the lungs or the airways.

I: Bronchial epithelium (wait, same as H? No, probably typo, but let me see. If he had a blockage, it would affect the airways, not the air inside. The patient's chest pain is due to airway obstruction. So, maybe the expanation is H, but the question is about the tissue. So, the expanation is the airways, but the question asks about the tissue, which would be the Bronchial epithelial tissue, not the airways themselves.

J: Pericardium — The pericardium is the area around the heart. If the heart has a blockage, the pericardium would show up as ST-segment elevation. But the patient has a lot of ST-segment elevation in all leads, which is more consistent with a bundle branch block, which is in the heart, not the pericardium.

Wait, but the patient's symptoms are chest pain and respiratory issues. If the aorta had a blockage, that could cause chest pain, but the ECG shows ST-segment elevation, which is more for a bundle branch or a block in the aorta. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the patient's ECG shows ST-segment elevation in all leads. That suggests that there's a bundle branch block in the aorta. Because the aorta is the major artery. Or maybe another branch, but the aortas are the major. So, the most likely cause is a conduction block in the aorta, which would be a bundle branch block.

But the patient has chest pain. If the aorta was blocked, that would cause chest pain. But why the ST-segment elevation? Oh, right, because a bundle branch block in the aorta causes ST-segment elevation. So the answer would be the aorta, which is the aortic artery.

Wait, but the answer options include A (pulmonary alveoli) and C (myocardium). So, the patient's ECG points to the aorta. So, the most likely tissue is the aortic artery, which is the heart muscle. But the options are about the tissues, not the heart muscle. Oh wait, the options are tissues, not the heart. So, the aortic intima is a part of the aorta. So, if the aorta is the heart muscle, the aortic intima is part of it.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Myocardium. Because if the aorta's bundle branch is blocked, the ST-segment would show in the leads. Also, the patient's chest pain is related to the aorta, which is part of the heart muscle (myocardium).

Alternatively, could it be the aortic intima? The aortic intima is the inner lining of the aorta. If that's blocked, it could cause similar symptoms. But the ST-segment elevation is in the aorta, so the heart's aorta (heart muscle) is the source.

So the answer is C. Myocardium is the heart muscle, so when the aorta (heart muscle) is blocked, the ST-segment would be seen in all leads, not just the A lead. So the likely tissue is the aortic artery, which is part of the myocardium.

The patient is a 40-year-old man with chest pain for 12 hours, exacerbated by coughing and inspiration, and no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38°C, blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, the ECG shows ST-segment elevation in all leads, and the x-ray is normal. These findings point to a conduction blockage in the heart, specifically in the aorta, which is part of the myocardium.

The aorta is the major artery, and a bundle branch block in the aorta can cause chest pain. The ST-segment elevation in all leads is consistent with a conduction block in the aorta, which affects the heart's electrical conduction system. While the aortic intima (the inner lining of the aorta) could theoretically cause similar symptoms, the ST-segment elevation is more specific to the aorta, indicating a defect in the heart muscle itself.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Pulmonary alveoli** — Clear lungs suggest no airway obstruction.
- **B: Aortic intima** — Could cause chest pain, but the ST-segment elevation is more indicative of a heart block.
- **C: Myocardium** — The heart muscle is at fault, as the ST-segment elevation reflects a conduction block in the aorta, which is part of the myocardium.
- **D: Cardiac valves** — ST-segment elevation is more associated with heart issues, not valves.
- **E: Vascular endodermal (esophageal sphincter)** — No mention of esophagitis in the question.
- **F: Pleural membrane** — No evidence of pleural effusion.
- **G: Tracheal tissue** — No mention of tracheal injury.
- **H: Bronchial epithelium** — Does not explain chest pain or ST-segment elevation.
- **I: Bronchial epithelium** — Same as H, not relevant here.
- **J: Pericardium** — The pericardium is unrelated to the observed symptoms or ST-segment elevation.

The most likely cause is a conduction block in the aorta, which is part of the heart muscle (myocardium). Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Myocardium**.

Answer: C
