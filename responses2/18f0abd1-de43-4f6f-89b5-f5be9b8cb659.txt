Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I have two questions here, both asking about converting liters to gallons and quarts to liters. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct answer for each part, then select the corresponding letter from A to J.

First, let's look at question (A): How many gallons are there in 12 liters? The options are A to J, but each option has both (A) and (B) parts. So, for each question (A) and (B), I'll need to calculate the correct value and then match it to the options.

Starting with question (A): 12 liters to gallons.

I remember that 1 liter is approximately 0.264 gallons. So, to find out how many gallons are in 12 liters, I multiply 12 by 0.264.

Let me calculate that:

12 * 0.264 = ?

Hmm, 10 * 0.264 = 2.64, and 2 * 0.264 = 0.528. Adding those together: 2.64 + 0.528 = 3.168 gallons. So, that's 3.168 gallons. Looking at the options, let's see which one has (A) as 3.168 gallons.

Looking at the options provided:

A: (A) 3.168 gallons (B) 9.46 liters
B: (A) 3.18 gallons (B) 9.6 liters
C: (A) 2.64 gallons (B) 9.46 liters
D: (A) 2.5 gallons (B) 9 liters
E: (A) 2.64 gallons (B) 10.5 liters
F: (A) 3.5 gallons (B) 9.46 liters
G: (A) 3 gallons (B) 9.5 liters
H: (A) 3.168 gallons (B) 10.46 liters
I: (A) 3.168 gallons (B) 11 liters
J: (A) 3.2 gallons (B) 10 liters

So, (A) is 3.168 gallons in option A and option H. Now, what about (B) for question (A): How many liters are there in 10 quarts? The options are the same.

I know that 1 quart is approximately 0.946 liters. So, 10 quarts would be 10 * 0.946 liters.

Calculating that: 10 * 0.946 = 9.46 liters. So, (B) is 9.46 liters. Looking at the options, option A has (B) 9.46 liters.

Wait, but let me check if I'm getting the units right. Oh wait, the question says (A) is how many gallons, and (B) is how many liters. So, for (A), 12 liters is 3.168 gallons, and for (B), 10 quarts is 9.46 liters. 

Looking at the options, each option has both (A) and (B) parts. Now, let's check which option has (A) as 3.168 and (B) as 9.46.

Looking at each option:

Option A: (A) 3.168, (B) 9.46 → So, this is a possible candidate.

Option H: (A) 3.168, (B) 10.46. But 10.46 liters doesn't match 9.46. So, H is incorrect for (B).

Option A seems correct. So, the answer is option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me cross-verify. Because, in the options, option A says (A) 3.168, (B) 9.46. So both (A) and (B) match the calculations.

So, (A) is 3.168 gallons, (B) is 9.46 liters. So, that's option A.

But wait, I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any other options that might fit? Let me check:

Option E: (A) 2.64, (B) 10.5 → No, (A) is wrong.

Option G: (A) 3, (B) 9.5 → No, (A) is wrong.

Option H: (A) 3.168, (B) 10.46 → (B) is wrong.

Option F: (A) 3.5, (B) 9.46 → (A) wrong.

Option D: (A) 2.5, (B) 9 → (A) wrong.

Option I: (A) 3.168, (B) 11 → (B) wrong.

Option J: (A) 3.2, (B) 10 → (A) wrong.

So, only option A has both (A) and (B) correct.

But wait, the options list each option as a pair, so each option is a combination of (A) and (B), and only option A's (A) and (B) are correct.

So, the answer is A.
