Okay, so I've got this question here about substituting pairs (a, b) into the number 30a0b03 so that the resulting integer is divisible by 13. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out how many such pairs exist. 

First, I'll try to understand the structure of the number. It's 30a0b03. Let me break it down. The number is 3 followed by 0, then a, then 0, then b, then 0, and ending with 3. So in terms of place value, each digit has a certain weight based on its position. 

Let me write the number as 3*10^7 + 0*10^6 + a*10^5 + 0*10^4 + b*10^3 + 0*10^2 + 3*10^0. That simplifies to 30000000 + a*100000 + b*1000 + 3. 

Wait, but the question is about substituting a and b. So I'm looking for all possible pairs (a, b) where a and b are digits (0-9) such that the entire number is divisible by 13. 

I remember that for divisibility by 13, there isn't a straightforward rule like for 3 or 9, but perhaps I can compute the number modulo 13 and see when it equals zero. 

Let me represent the number as N = 30a0b03, which is 30000000 + a*100000 + b*1000 + 3. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute N mod 13. Since 10^k mod 13 cycles in a pattern, perhaps I can find a way to represent N mod 13 in terms of a and b.

Alternatively, I can compute N as a number, then find N mod 13. Let me see. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute 30a0b03 as a number. Let me think about how that can be broken down. The number is 30 a 0 b 0 3. So:

- Position 1 (from the right, starting at 0): 3 (hundreds place)
- Position 2: 0
- Position 3: b (thousands place)
- Position 4: 0
- Position 5: a (ten thousands place)
- Position 6: 0 (hundred thousands place)
- Position 7: 3 (millions place)
- Position 8: 0 (ten millions place)
- Position 9: 0 (hundred millions place)

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write it as 3*10^8 + 0*10^7 + a*10^6 + 0*10^5 + b*10^4 + 0*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 0*10^1 + 0*10^0.

Wait, that would be 3*10^8 + a*10^6 + b*10^4 + 3*10^2. Let me compute each term mod 13.

But perhaps another approach is to realize that 10 ≡ 10 mod 13, 10^2 ≡ 100 mod 13. Let me compute 10^k mod 13 for various k.

10^0 mod13 = 1
10^1 mod13 = 10
10^2 mod13 = (10*10) mod13 = 100 mod13. 13*7=91, 100-91=9 → 9
10^3 mod13= (10^2 *10) mod13=9*10=90 mod13. 13*6=78, 90-78=12 →12
10^4 mod13= (10^3 *10) mod13=12*10=120 mod13. 13*9=117, 120-117=3 →3
10^5 mod13= (10^4 *10) mod13=3*10=30 mod13. 13*2=26, 30-26=4 →4
10^6 mod13= (10^5 *10) mod13=4*10=40 mod13. 13*3=39, 40-39=1 →1
10^7 mod13= (10^6 *10) mod13=1*10=10 →10
10^8 mod13= (10^7 *10) mod13=10*10=100 mod13=9 as before.

So, for each term in the number:

30a0b03 is 3*10^8 + 0*10^7 + a*10^6 + 0*10^5 + b*10^4 + 0*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 0*10^1 + 0*10^0.

So mod13, each term is:

3*10^8 mod13 =3*9=27 mod13. 13*2=26, 27-26=1 →1
0*10^7=0
a*10^6 mod13 =a*1
0*10^5=0
b*10^4 mod13 =b*3
0*10^3=0
3*10^2 mod13=3*9=27 mod13=1
0*10^1=0
0*10^0=0.

So adding all the mod13 terms:

1 (from 3*10^8) +0 +a +0 +3b +0 +1 +0 +0 = 2 + a + 3b.

So the entire number is congruent to 2 + a + 3b modulo13. We need this to be 0 mod13.

So 2 + a + 3b ≡ 0 mod13 → a + 3b ≡ -2 mod13 → which is the same as a +3b ≡ 11 mod13.

So the equation we have is a + 3b ≡ 11 mod13.

Now, a and b are digits from 0 to 9. So we need to find all pairs (a,b) where a and b are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, such that a +3b ≡11 mod13.

Wait, but 11 mod13 is 11, so the equation is a +3b =11 +13k, where k is some integer. But since a and b are between 0 and9, the maximum a +3b can be is 9 +3*9=9+27=36. The minimum is 0+0=0. So 11 +13k must be between 0 and36.

Let's find the possible k values.

11 +13k ≥0 →k ≥0 (since k is integer)
11 +13k ≤36 →13k ≤25 →k ≤1 (because 13*2=26>25). So possible k=0 and k=1.

So 11 +13*0 =11, and 11+13*1=24.

So a +3b can be either 11 or 24.

So we have two cases:

1) a +3b =11
2) a +3b=24.

We can now find all (a, b) pairs that satisfy these equations.

First case: a +3b =11.

We need to find a and b between 0 and9.

Let me think about possible values of b:

b can be 0 to 3 because 3b ≤11 →b ≤3.666..., so b=0,1,2,3.

For each b, compute a=11-3b and see if a is between 0 and9.

b=0: a=11-0=11 →a=11 is invalid (since a must be ≤9)
b=1: a=11-3=8 →a=8 (valid)
b=2: a=11-6=5 →a=5 (valid)
b=3: a=11-9=2 →a=2 (valid)
b=4: 3*4=12 →11-12=-1 →a=-1 invalid.

So for case 1, the valid (a,b) pairs are:

(8,1), (5,2), (2,3).

That's 3 pairs.

Case 2: a +3b=24.

Again, a and b must be between 0 and9.

Find possible b values:

3b ≤24 →b ≤8 (since 3*8=24). But since b ≤9, but 3b=24 →b=8.

Wait, wait:

Wait, a +3b=24. a can't be more than 9, so 3b can be up to 24 -0=24. So b can be up to 8 (since 3*8=24). But b=8:

a=24 -3*8=24-24=0 →a=0.

Check if a is within 0-9: yes.

Now, let's check other b values:

b=7: 3*7=21 →a=24-21=3 →a=3 (valid)
b=8: a=0 (valid)
b=9: 3*9=27>24 →a=24-27=-3 invalid.

So for case 2, the valid (a,b) pairs are:

(0,8), (3,7), (24-21=3, 7). Wait, wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, when b=7: a=24-3*7=24-21=3 →(3,7) →valid.
b=8: a=0 →(0,8) →valid.
b=9: a=24-27=-3 invalid.

So case 2 gives us two pairs: (3,7) and (0,8).

Wait, wait, no: a has to be 0 for b=8 because 3*8=24, so a=0. So that's one. And for b=7, a=3, which is another. Are there more?

Wait, no, because for b=9, a is negative, so invalid. So case 2 gives two pairs: (0,8) and (3,7).

Wait, but wait, a=0 when b=8. So those are two valid pairs.

Wait, but earlier I thought for case 1, there were 3 pairs. So case 1 gives 3, case 2 gives 2. So total 5 pairs.

Wait, but let me recount case 1:

Case 1: a +3b=11.

We had b=0 →a=11 invalid; b=1→a=8; b=2→a=5; b=3→a=2. So 3 pairs.

Case2: a +3b=24.

We have b=7 →a=3; b=8→a=0. So 2 pairs.

Wait, but wait, wait. I think I may have made a mistake. Because in case 2, a=24-3b. Let me list all possible b values.

b can be from 0 to 8 (since 3*9=27>24). So let's see:

b=0 →a=24 →a=24>9 →invalid
b=1 →a=21 →invalid
b=2 →a=18 →invalid
b=3 →a=15 →invalid
b=4 →a=12 →invalid
b=5 →a=9 →valid (a=9, b=5)
b=6 →a=6 →valid (a=6, b=6)
b=7 →a=3 →valid (a=3, b=7)
b=8 →a=0 →valid (a=0, b=8)
b=9 →a=-3 →invalid

So in case 2, the valid b are 5,6,7,8, which gives a=9,6,3,0 respectively. So that's 4 pairs.

Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because earlier I thought it was 2, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute:

Case 2: a +3b=24.

b can be 5,6,7,8:

For b=5: a=24-15=9 →valid.
b=6: a=24-18=6 →valid.
b=7: a=24-21=3 →valid.
b=8: a=24-24=0 →valid.
b=9: a=24-27=-3 invalid.

So that's 4 pairs for case 2.

So case 1: 3 pairs.

Case 2: 4 pairs.

Total: 3 +4 =7 pairs.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because earlier I thought case 2 had two pairs, but now it's four.

Wait, so case 2 has 4 pairs. So 3+4=7 total pairs.

But wait, the options don't have 7 as an option. Wait, the options are:

A:2, B:8, C:4, D:9, E:0, F:5, G:3, H:7, I:6, J:1.

So H is 7. So the answer would be H:7.

Wait, but earlier in case 2, I thought only 2 pairs, but now I'm getting 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in case 2.

Let me recount for case 2 again.

a +3b=24.

a must be 0-9, b 0-9.

So let's list each possible b and a:

b=0: a=24 →invalid.
b=1: a=24-3=21 →invalid.
b=2: 24-6=18 →invalid.
b=3: 24-9=15 →invalid.
b=4: 24-12=12 →invalid.
b=5:24-15=9 →valid.
b=6:24-18=6 →valid.
b=7:24-21=3 →valid.
b=8:24-24=0 →valid.
b=9:24-27=-3→invalid.

So for case 2, valid b's are 5,6,7,8 → a=9,6,3,0. So four valid pairs.

So case 2 has 4 pairs.

Case 1: 3 pairs.

Total 7 pairs.

Wait, but the question is, how many pairs (a,b) can we substitute. So 7 pairs in total.

Looking at the options, H is 7. So the answer should be H:7.

Wait, but the options don't include E:0, F:5, etc. So I think the correct answer is 7, which is option H.
</think>

The number to consider is 30a0b03, which must be divisible by 13. Expressing this as 3*10^8 + a*10^6 + b*10^4 + 3, we compute modulo 13. Using 10^k mod13 for k=0 to 8, we find the equation a + 3b ≡ 11 mod13. This gives two cases: a +3b=11 and a +3b=24. Solving for valid (a,b) pairs within 0-9, we find 3 pairs for case 1 and 4 pairs for case 2, totaling 7.
