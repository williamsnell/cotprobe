Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating an employee's total earnings based on their work hours. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the employee's pay structure is $2.40 per hour with time and a half for any hours worked beyond 8 hours. So, for each day they work up to 8 hours, they get $2.40 per hour. But for any hours over 8, that's 1.5 times the regular rate, which would be $2.40 * 1.5. Let me calculate that.

1.5 times 2.40 is 3.60. So, time and a half is $3.60 per hour for overtime.

Now, let's look at each day they worked:

Monday: 8 hours. So, regular pay for Monday. That's 8 * $2.40. Let me compute that: 8 * 2 is 16, and 8 * 0.40 is 3.20, so 16 + 3.20 = $19.20.

Tuesday: 7 hours. Both regular hours. 7 * $2.40. 7*2 is 14, 7*0.40 is 2.80, total $16.80.

Wednesday: 9 hours. So, first 8 are regular, then 1 hour overtime. Regular pay is 8 * $2.40 = $19.20, overtime is 1 * $3.60 = $3.60. Total for Wednesday: $19.20 + $3.60 = $22.80.

Thursday: 9 hours. Same structure as Wednesday. 8 hours at $2.40, 1 hour at $3.60. So again, $19.20 + $3.60 = $22.80.

Friday: 10 hours. So, 8 regular, 2 overtime. Regular: $19.20, overtime: 2 * $3.60. Let's see, 2 * 3 is 6, 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, so $6 + $1.20 = $7.20. So total for Friday: $19.20 + $7.20 = $26.40.

Now, let's add up all the earnings from each day.

Monday: $19.20
Tuesday: $16.80
Wednesday: $22.80
Thursday: $22.80
Friday: $26.40

Adding them up: 

19.20 + 16.80 = 36.00

36.00 + 22.80 = 58.80

58.80 + 22.80 = 81.60

81.60 + 26.40 = 108.00

Wait, that adds up to $108.00. Let me check the options again. The options are A to J, and the choices are:

A: $99.60
B: $115.20
C: $93.60
D: $102.40
E: $111.60
F: $14.40
G: $120.00
H: $123.60
I: $108.00
J: $96.00

So, option I is $108.00, which matches the total I calculated. Wait, but let me double-check my math because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Monday: 8 * 2.40 is indeed 19.20.

Tuesday: 7 * 2.40 is 16.80.

Wednesday: 8*2.40=19.20 +1*3.60=3.60 → 22.80.

Thursday: same as Wednesday → 22.80.

Friday: 8*2.40=19.20 +2*3.60=7.20 → 26.40.

Adding them up: 19.20 +16.80=36.00; 36 +22.80=58.80; 58.80 +22.80=81.60; 81.60+26.40=108.00.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be option I: $108.00.

The total earnings are calculated by summing each day's pay. Each day's earnings are determined by regular hours and overtime hours, where overtime is 1.5 times the regular rate. The totals add up to $108.00.

Answer: I: $108.00
