Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. There are 2,817 homes in West Valley, and each uses an average of 380 gallons of water each day. I need to find the total number of gallons used each day by all the homes. The question gives me an expression: 2,817 multiplied by 380. They're asking me to calculate this and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Multiplication. I remember that multiplying large numbers can sometimes be tricky, but maybe breaking it down will help. Alternatively, I could use the standard multiplication method step by step. Let me try that.

First, I'll write down the numbers:

2,817
×   380
________

I know that multiplying by 380 is the same as multiplying by 300 plus 80. So maybe breaking it into two parts will make it easier. Let me compute each part separately.

First, 2,817 × 300. Well, 300 is 3 times 100, so I can think of it as 2,817 × 3 × 100. Let me calculate 2,817 × 3 first.

2,817 × 3: Let's do this step by step. 3 × 7 is 21, carry over 2. 3 × 1 is 3 plus 2 is 5. 3 × 8 is 24, carry over 2. 3 × 2 is 6 plus 2 is 8. So that's 8,451. Then I multiply by 100, which appends two zeros. So 845,100.

Next, 2,817 × 80. 80 is 8 × 10. So 2,817 × 8 × 10.

Let's compute 2,817 × 8. Breaking it down: 2,000 × 8 = 16,000. 800 ×8=6,400. 17×8=136. Adding those together: 16,000 +6,400 is 22,400. 22,400 +136 is 22,536. Then multiply by 10, which is adding a zero: 225,360.

Now, add the two results together: 845,100 + 225,360.

Adding 845,100 +200,000 is 1,045,100. Then add 25,360. So 1,045,100 +25,360 = 1,070,460.

Wait, let me check that addition again. 845,100 +225,360. Let's add the thousands. 800k +200k is 1,000k. Then 45k +25k is 70k. Then 100 +360 is 460. So yes, that adds up to 1,070,460.

Looking at the options, option D is 1,070,460 gallons. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: 1,070,460 gallons.

To calculate the total water used by all homes:
2,817 homes × 380 gallons/day = 1,070,460 gallons/day.

Answer: D
