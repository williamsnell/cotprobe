Okay, so I've got this problem here about a radio price increase. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The original price was $2.25, and now it's sold for $2.50. I need to find the percentage markup. 

First, I remember that markup is the amount added to the original price to get the new price. But wait, the question is asking for the percent markup, so I think I need to calculate the percentage increase from the original price to the new price. 

So, the formula for percentage markup is usually (Markup Amount / Original Price) * 100%. But in this case, I don't know the Markup Amount. The markup amount is the difference between the new price and the original price. So, let's calculate that difference first.

New Price - Original Price = $2.50 - $2.25 = $0.25. So the markup amount is $0.25.

Now, I need to find what percentage $0.25 is of the original price, which was $2.25. Plugging into the formula: ($0.25 / $2.25) * 100%.

Let me compute that. 0.25 divided by 2.25. Hmm, 0.25 ÷ 2.25 equals approximately 0.1111. Multiplying by 100% gives me about 11.11%.

Looking at the options provided: A is 20%, B is 12%, C is 8%, D is 11%, E is 10%, F is 15%, G is 30%, H is 25%, I is 5%, J is 18%. So the closest option is D, which is 11%.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between markup and margin. Let me double-check. Markup is the amount added, whereas margin is the percentage of the selling price that's profit. Oh right, so in this case, the question specifically asks for the markup percentage, not the margin. So I'm correct in using the markup formula.

Another way to think about it: the markup is $0.25 on a $2.25 radio. So how much is that in percentage terms. 0.25/2.25 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111, so 11.11%, which is approximately 11%. So option D is correct.

The markup percentage is calculated as the markup amount divided by the original price multiplied by 100%. The markup amount is $0.25, and the original price is $2.25. Thus, (0.25 / 2.25) * 100% ≈ 11.11%. The closest option is D: 11%.

Answer: D
