Okay, so I've got this ideal gas problem here. Hmm, let's see. I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, in this problem, we have two different states of the gas. One is the initial state, and the other is the final state. So I think I should use the combined gas law here because it relates the initial and final states without involving moles.

Alright, let me write down what I know. The initial state is P1 = 137 atm, V1 = 2 ft³, T1 = 27°C. The final state is P2 = 1 atm (atmospheric pressure), V2 = ? (what we're solving for), T2 = 50°C.

Wait, but I should convert the temperatures to Kelvin because the ideal gas law uses absolute temperatures. So, T1 is 27 + 273 = 300 K. T2 is 50 + 273 = 323 K.

So the formula I need is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. Because if everything else is constant (ideal gas), then PV/T is the same. So rearranging for V2, it'll be V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1).

Plugging in the numbers:

V2 = (137 atm * 2 ft³ * 323 K) / (1 atm * 300 K)

Let me compute that step by step. First, compute the numerator: 137 * 2 = 274. 274 * 323. Hmm, I need to calculate that. Let me think.

Wait, 323 is 300 + 23. So 274*300 = 82200, and 274 * 23. Let's compute that: 274 * 20 is 5480, 274 *3 is 822, so 5480+822=6302. So total numerator is 82200 + 6302 = 88502.

Denominator: 1 * 300 = 300.

So V2 = 88502 / 300. Let me compute that division. 300 goes into 88502 how many times?

300 * 295 = 88500. Oh wait, because 300*295 = 88500. So 88502 is 88500 +2, so 295 + (2/300) = approximately 295.07.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option C is 295 ft³. But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I'm making multiplication errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation when multiplying. Let me recheck: 137 * 2 is 274. Then 274 * 323.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 274 * 323 as (270 +4) * (300 +23). Using the distributive property: 270*300=81000, 270*23=6210, 4*300=1200, 4*23=92. So adding them all: 81000 +6210=87210; 1200 +92=1292. Total is 87210 +1292=88502. So that's correct.

Divide by 300: 88502 /300 = let's compute. 300 * 295 = 88500, so 88502 is 88500 +2, so 295 + 2/300 = 295.0666... So approximately 295.07 ft³.

Wait, but the options include 295, which is option C, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be higher. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, the initial temperature is 27 C, which is 300 K. Final is 50 C, which is 323 K. So the temperature increases by about 23 K, which makes sense.

Wait, perhaps I should check my units again. The volume is in cubic feet, which is appropriate for the SI unit? Well, in this case, the units are consistent because all the quantities are in pressure (atm), volume (ft³), and temperature (K). So the units are okay.

But wait, wait, the answer options don't include a value around 295. Let me look again: option C is 295 ft³, which is the calculation I did. So that's the answer.

But the options are A to J. Let me check the initial problem again. Oh, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature conversion. Wait, 27°C is 300 K, and 50°C is 323 K. That's correct.

So if the calculation is correct, the answer should be option C, 295.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law, which relates the initial and final states of an ideal gas:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Given Data:
- Initial pressure: \( P_1 = 137 \, \text{atm} \)
- Initial volume: \( V_1 = 2 \, \text{ft}^3 \)
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- Final pressure: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = 50^\circ \text{C} = 323 \, \text{K} \)

### Rearranging for \( V_2 \):
\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
V_2 = \frac{137 \cdot 2 \cdot 323}{1 \cdot 300}
\]

### Calculations:
1. Compute the numerator:
   - \( 137 \cdot 2 = 274 \)
   - \( 274 \cdot 323 = 88,502 \)

2. Compute the denominator:
   - \( 1 \cdot 300 = 300 \)

3. Divide:
   - \( V_2 = \frac{88,502}{300} \approx 295.07 \, \text{ft}^3 \)

### Final Answer:
The final volume is approximately \( 295 \, \text{ft}^3 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
