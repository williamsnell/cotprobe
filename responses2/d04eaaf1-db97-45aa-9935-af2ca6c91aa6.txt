Okay, so I have this physics question here about measuring the charge on an oil drop. Hmm, oil drops in electric fields... Right, I remember something about this being related to J.J. Thomson's experiment. Let me think about what that involves.

So, in Thomson's experiment, he used a charged oil drop to determine the charge. The idea is that the oil drop, when placed in an electric field, experiences a force due to the field which may balance the gravitational force. The charge on the drop should be a multiple of the elementary charge, right? The elementary charge is about 1.6 × 10^-19 coulombs.

Wait, but sometimes other factors come into play, like the mass of the drop and the electric field strength. The equation I remember is something like q = (mg)/(eE), where m is the mass, g is gravity, e is the elementary charge, and E is the electric field strength. Oh, wait, no—that's not right. Wait, the electric force must balance the weight. So, qE = mg. So, q = mg/(E). But wait, that's if the drop is moving at a constant velocity when it's in the electric field. So the charge is related to the mass and the electric field.

But wait, the charge on the oil drop is typically an integer multiple of the elementary charge, like q = n e, where n is the number of elementary charges. So, each drop would have a charge that is a multiple of e.

So, looking at the options, the possible charges are multiples of 1.6e-19. Let's see:

Option A: 2.4e-19 C. 2.4 / 1.6 is 1.5. Hmm, that's 3/2 of e. But wait, can the charge be a fraction of e? Because if the drop is moving at a different velocity, maybe. Or perhaps the experiment is considering the mass and other factors.

Wait, but in the experiment, why do we get a multiple of e? Because when the oil drop is moving with terminal velocity, the electric force equals the gravitational force. So, the charge would be q = (mg)/(E). So, if the mass of the drop is m, and the electric field strength is E, the charge would be a multiple of e.

But let's think about the actual charge found in the experiments. The charge is often a multiple of the elementary charge. So 1e-19 is e, 2e-19 would be 2e, 3e, etc. So, looking at the options:

Option A: 2.4e-19. Let me divide 2.4 by 1.6, which is 1.5. That's 3/2 e, but that's not an integer. So, could that be a possible case? Or does the charge have to be an integer multiple?

Wait, but why would a charge be a fraction of e? Because maybe the oil drop's mass is such that m/(e) isn't an integer, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps some other factors are at play. Alternatively, perhaps the charge is a multiple of e multiplied by some integer, but that integer could be a fraction. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. In the experiment, the charge is known to be a multiple of e. So, any charge expected would be a multiple like 1e-19, 2e-19, etc. So Option A gives 2.4e-19. 2.4 is 1.5e-19 C, which is 3/2 e. So that's a possible value for n being 1.5? But that's not an integer. So, can a charge be 1.5 e? Or is it required to be an integer?

Wait, I think in the experiment, the charge is measured as 1e-19, 2e-19, etc. But maybe in this problem, some of the options are not multiples of e. So, perhaps option A is 2.4e-19, which is 1.5 e, which is 3/2 e. If that's the case, could it be a possible measurement?

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it says "which of the following measurements should be rejected as highly unlikely to be correct." So, if a charge is a non-integer multiple of e, like 1.5e-19, that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps that's a math error. Or maybe the problem is considering that the charges are multiples of e, but some values don't fit, so they're unlikely.

Wait, another angle: the possible charges must be multiples of e because the oil drop's charge is determined by the electric field and the mass, leading to an integer multiple. So, for example, if the charge is 2.4e-19, that's 1.5e-19, which is 3/2 e. So it's not an integer. But that can't be right because the charge is known to be an integer multiple. So that would mean that option A is an unlikely charge because it's not an integer multiple of e.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the possible charges.

Electron charge: e ≈ 1.602e-19 C.

Option A: 2.4e-19 → 2.4 / 1.602 ≈ 1.5, so 1.5 e. That's 3/2 e.

Option B: 6.4e-19 → 6.4 / 1.602 ≈ 4.0, which is about 4e-19, so 4 e.

Option C: 8.0e-19 → 8 / 1.602 ≈ 5, so 5e-19.

Option D: 4.8e-19 → 4.8 /1.602≈ 3, so 3e-19.

So, all except option A are integer multiples of e. Option A is 3/2 e. So, if the charge is supposed to be an integer multiple, option A is a possible value?

Wait, but wait, another point: the oil drop's charge is a multiple of e. So the possible charges are e, 2e, 3e, etc. But how did that happen? Because when the oil drop moves at terminal velocity, the electric force equals the gravitational force. So, Newton's law: qE = mg.

So, q = (mg)/(E). If the mass m is such that (mg)/(E) is an integer multiple of e, then yes. But if the mass is, say, 3e-19 kg, that would give q=3e-19 C. But if the mass is such that (mg)/(E) is, say, 1.5e-19 C, that would imply that the charge is 1.5e-19 C. But that's 3/2 e, which isn't an integer. So in that case, that measurement wouldn't fit, because the charge should be an integer multiple of e. Hence, option A is 1.5e-19, which is 3/2 e. So, it's not a possible charge.

Thus, option A is an unlikely measurement because it's a non-integer multiple of the electron charge. So, it should be rejected.

To determine which charge measurement is highly unlikely, we analyze the possible charges of the oil drop, which should be an integer multiple of the elementary charge \( e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The given options are:

- **Option A:** \( 2.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- **Option B:** \( 6.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- **Option C:** \( 8.0 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- **Option D:** \( 4.8 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)

### Analysis:
1. **Option A (\( 2.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)):**  
   Dividing \( 2.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) gives \( 1.5 \), which is \( \frac{3}{2} \). This implies a charge of \( 1.5e \), which is a non-integer multiple of the elementary charge. Since the charge on an oil drop in such experiments is typically an integer multiple of \( e \), this measurement is unlikely.

2. **Option B (\( 6.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)):**  
   Dividing \( 6.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) gives \( 4 \), which is an integer. This is a valid charge.

3. **Option C (\( 8.0 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)):**  
   Dividing \( 8.0 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) gives \( 5 \), which is an integer. This is a valid charge.

4. **Option D (\( 4.8 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)):**  
   Dividing \( 4.8 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) by \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) gives \( 3 \), which is an integer. This is a valid charge.

### Conclusion:
Option A (\( 2.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)) is the only charge that is not an integer multiple of the elementary charge (\( e \)), making it highly unlikely to be correct. The other options correspond to valid integer multiples of \( e \).
