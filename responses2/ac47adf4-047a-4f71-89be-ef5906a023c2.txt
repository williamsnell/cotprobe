Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether an increase in national income always leads to an increase in employment. The question is a multiple-choice one, and I have to choose the correct answer from options A to J.

First, I need to understand the concepts involved. National income refers to the total income a country generates within a specific time period. It includes various sectors like manufacturing, services, agriculture, etc. Employment refers to the number of people who are working and actively seeking a job.

I remember that during economic growth, the total national income tends to increase, but not all jobs go to the same level. For example, the workforce might expand, but not all positions are filled. So, national income growth can sometimes be accompanied by a rise in employment, but it's not guaranteed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: No effect. That's probably incorrect because national income increases often lead to more job creation.

Option B: Driven by technology advancements. I think technology can lead to more efficient production, which can create more jobs. For example, automation might change several jobs into fewer roles. But does it always result in more employment? It depends on the sector. Some industries might not increase employment but might create more jobs due to technological change.

Option C: Always increase in employment. That doesn't make sense. More national income can come from increased production but doesn't necessarily mean more people are employed. It depends on how the workforce expands.

Option D: Only in manufacturing. That's probably not right. Employment could vary across different sectors. Services might see more growth because they're more labor-intensive.

Option E: Not necessarily. As I thought earlier, national income growth doesn't always directly cause employment growth. It can be influenced by various factors like demographics, business expansion, etc.

Option F: Decrease in employment. That's the opposite of what's happening. More income should mean more people can work, not fewer.

Option G: Only service sector. Not correct. Employment can vary widely across all sectors. For example, manufacturing might not see increases in employment if people move elsewhere.

Option H: Increased employment if productivity is equivalent. Hmm. So, if the economy's productivity stays the same, maybe more people can be employed. But if productivity grows, more jobs can be created. I'm not sure if this is a general rule. Maybe it's more about the balance between income and productivity.

Option J: Only when it exceeds inflation. Not directly related. Inflation affects purchasing power, not job creation.

So, the correct answer is likely E because national income growth doesn't always lead to employment growth. It's possible, but not guaranteed, depending on factors like labor force expansion and structural changes.

The correct answer is E: No, every increase in national income does not necessarily result in an increase of employment.
