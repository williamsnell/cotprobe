Okay, so I've got this question about the Mother Goose nursery rhyme and which child is full of woe. Hmm, I remember that the rhyme goes something like "I see a cow in the field, and she's so sick, she's a cow, I'm so sorry, I see her, I give her a little wash, and she's so so so sick, she's a cow, I'm so sorry, I give her a little wash, and she's so so so sick." Oh wait, but that's just the first verse. The second verse says, "I see a cow in the field, and she's so sick, she's a cow, I'm so sorry, I see her, I give her a little wash, and she's so so so sick, she's a cow, I'm so sorry, I give her a little wash, and she's so so so sick." Or is that the first line? Maybe I got that wrong. 

I think the second verse has a child who's sick and goes to the washroom. So the child is the seventh one, because the first verse is about the first child. The second verse is about the seventh child. So the rhyme goes: "I see a cow in the field, and she's so sick, she's a cow, I'm so sorry, I see her, I give her a little wash, and she's so so so sick, she's a cow, I'm so sorry, I give her a little wash, and she's so so so sick." The seventh child is the one who's sick, so the answer should be C: The seventh child. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the seventh child is the one who goes to the washroom, which is described in the second verse. So yes, the seventh child is the one who's full of woe. So the correct answer should be C.
