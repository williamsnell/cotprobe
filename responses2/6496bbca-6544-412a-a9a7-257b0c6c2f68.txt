Question:

A student pushes a puck across a table, moving it from position x = 0 to position x = 0.2 m. After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck?

Options:

A: The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.
B: The net force is in the negative direction, because the student’s push caused the puck to slow down in the positive direction.
C: The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.
D: The net force is in the positive direction, because the force of friction is in the negative direction.
E: The net force is up, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 upward.
F: The net force is in the positive direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction.
G: The net force is zero, because the student’s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.
H: The net force is zero, because the puck is in motion and not accelerating.
I: The net force is in the positive direction, because the student’s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.
J: The net force is zero, because the puck is at rest at position x = 1.0 m.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a puck being pushed across a table. Hmm, let's see. The puck starts at x=0 and moves to x=0.2 m. Then when the student lets go, it continues to move and stops at x=1.2 m. The question is about the net force on the puck when it's at x=1.0 m, specifically whether the net force is positive, negative, or zero.

Let me think. So the puck is moving from 0 to 0.2 m, then continues to move a little further but comes to rest at 1.2 m. So initially, when it's in 0 to 0.2 m, I guess it's under the student's push. The student stops pushing, so the only forces acting on it would be friction. But wait, when the student stops pushing, the puck slows down and stops. So friction is opposing the motion.

Wait, when the puck is moving from 0 to 0.2 m, the student is pushing it. So the net force is in the positive direction (since it's moving in the positive direction). Once the student lets go, friction acts opposite to the motion. So the net force would be negative (since friction is acting in the negative direction). So at x=1.0 m, which is between 0.2 and 1.2 m, the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down. Wait, but that's when the student is still pushing. After the student lets go, the puck is moving in the positive direction, but friction is in the negative direction, so the net force is negative.

Wait, but the question is about the net force when the puck is at x=1.0 m. So that's after the student has let go. So the forces are: the student's push (if any) and friction.

Wait, but the student's push is only during the first part. Once the student lets go, the only force is friction. So at x=1.0 m, the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down. So the net force is in the negative direction.

Wait, but the student's push is still there when the puck is moving from 0.2 m to 1.2 m? Or is the push only for the first part? Oh, I think the student is pushing until the puck is no longer moving. Wait, no, the problem says the puck moves to 0.2 m, then when the student lets go, it continues to move. So the push is applied, but once the student lets go, friction is the only force.

Wait, but when the puck is moving after the student stops pushing, it's moving in the positive direction, but friction is acting opposite to that, so the net force is in the negative direction.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Net force negative, because moving positive but slowing. That makes sense because friction is opposing the motion.

Option B: Net force negative because student's push caused it to slow. But once the student stops pushing, the only force is friction, which is negative.

Option C: Net force down because near Earth. No, because the puck is moving forward (positive direction), so the gravitational force is up, but the net force would be the sum of all forces. The student's push and friction. Wait, but if the student stops pushing, then the only force is friction. So when the puck is moving, it's experiencing a force opposing its movement.

Wait, but the question is about the net force when the puck is at x=1.0 m. So in that moment, the only force is friction. Which is in the negative direction.

So looking at the options:

Option A says the net force is in negative, because moving positive but slowing. Yes, that's correct.

Option B says the net force is negative because the student's push caused it to slow. But when the student stops pushing, the only forces are friction. So B is incorrect because the net force isn't due to the student's push anymore.

Option C is about gravitational acceleration, but the net force is due to friction, not gravity. So C is wrong.

Option D: Net force positive because friction is negative. No, friction is negative, so net force is negative. So D is wrong.

Option E: Net force up because gravity. No, gravity is acting opposite to the net force. If net force is up, that would mean gravity is down. So E is wrong.

Option F: Net force positive because moving positive. No, because when the puck is moving, net force is in the opposite direction of motion. So F is wrong.

Option G: Net force zero because student's push equals friction. No, because when the student stops pushing, the puck is still moving (because it's moving beyond x=0.2 m). So the net force is not zero; it's negative.

Option H: Net force zero because puck is at rest. No, it's moving, so net force is not zero.

Option I: Net force positive because student's push caused it to speed up. No, because after the student stops pushing, the puck slows down, meaning the net force is opposite to the motion. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Net force zero because puck is rest. No, it's moving, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine the correct assertion about the net force on the puck at position \( x = 1.0 \, \text{m} \), we analyze the forces acting on it. The puck is moving in the positive direction (\( +x \)) while slowing down due to friction. Once the student lets go of the puck, the only force acting on it is friction, which is in the negative direction (\( -x \)). This means the net force on the puck is in the negative direction.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The net force is in the negative direction because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The net force is not due to the student's push alone; friction is the only force after the push ceases.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The net force is not due to gravity; it is caused by friction.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The net force is negative, not positive, because friction opposes the motion.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The net force is not upward; gravity acts downward, opposing the motion.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The net force is positive, not negative, because the puck is moving in the positive direction.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The net force is not zero because the puck is still moving (\( +x \)) and has a net negative force.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The puck is not at rest at \( x = 1.0 \, \text{m} \).
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The puck is moving in the positive direction, so it is not speeding up.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The puck is not at rest at \( x = 1.0 \, \text{m} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
