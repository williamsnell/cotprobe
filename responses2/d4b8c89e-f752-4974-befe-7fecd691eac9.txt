Okay, so I've got this question about the velocity of money. Hmm, I remember that the velocity of money is a concept in economics. Let me think about what I learned before.

Wait, the formula is something like MV = PY, right? Where M is the money supply, V is velocity, P is price level, and Y is real GDP. Oh wait, no, I think the formula is V equals (PY) divided by M. Or maybe it's V = PY/M. Yeah, that's right. So velocity is the number of times money is used to transact goods and services in a given period.

The question gives GNP as $600 billion, but wait, wait. Wait, in the formula, PV is usually PY, so I should make sure I'm using the correct terms. Let me write down what I have: M is the money supply, which is $200 billion. GNP is $600 billion. Oh wait, GNP is the gross national product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year. But in the formula, is GNP necessary? Or is it just real GDP?

Wait, the formula for velocity is V = PY/M. So M is money supply. Y is real GDP, not nominal. Or maybe GNP is net domestic product, which is nominal. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no, in the formula, real GDP is Y. So real GDP can be calculated as nominal GDP divided by price level. But in the formula, PY is the nominal GDP. Wait, noâ€”wait, perhaps in the formula PV = PY, but I think PV is the price level times velocity. Let me get this straight.

Another approach: the formula is V = (Total Nominal GDP) / (Money Supply). So V = PY / M. Wait, but Y is real GDP, which is nominal GDP divided by the price level. So maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is V = PY / M, where PY is the nominal GDP. But wait, I'm getting myself tied up.

Wait, let me think again. The question gives GNP as $600 billion. GNP is the same as nominal GDP, I think. So PY is the same as nominal GDP, which is $600 billion. M is the money supply of $200 billion. So plugging into V = PY / M, that would be 600 / 200 = 3. So velocity would be 3 times per year.

Wait, but let me make sure. So V = PY / M. So PY is $600, M is $200, so 600 / 200 is 3, so V is 3. So the answer should be A: 3 times per year.

Wait, another thought. Could the question be using real GDP instead of nominal GDP? But the question says GNP, which is usually the same as nominal GDP. Unless the question is using real GDP, but I don't think so. Because real GDP is nominal divided by price level.

So if GNP is $600 billion, that's nominal, so PY would be $600. M is $200. So yeah, 600/200 is 3. So velocity is 3 times per year. So option A.
</think>

The velocity of money (V) is calculated using the formula \( V = \frac{PY}{M} \), where \( PY \) is the nominal GDP and \( M \) is the money supply. In this case, GNP (nominal GDP) is $600 billion, and the money supply \( M \) is $200 billion. Plugging in the values:

\[
V = \frac{600}{200} = 3
\]

Thus, the velocity of money is 3 times per year. The correct answer is **A: 3 times per year**.
