Okay, so I'm trying to solve this property law question here. Let me read through it again and see if I can figure it out. 

The question involves a deed executed by a woman in 2001. She conveyed a tract of land for a consideration of one dollar. The important part is what happens when the land is used for liquor—because if someone sells the land for liquor, the interest goes to her cousin and his heirs. But if for any reason the interest goes to her cousin and isn't valid, she can re-enter and take back her property. 

In 2004, her friend died intestate before he could harvest the wheat. So, the question is about the proceeds from the crop. The options are about who would get the money.

Hmm. Let's break this down. The deed is between the woman and her friend. The land is used for liquor, which gives the cousin and their heirs priority. If the cousin's interest isn't valid, she can re-enter and take back her property. So the cousin has a legal interest in the land.

But the friend died, so the estate of the friend is up for grabs. When a person dies, their estate's property goes to their heirs according to the law. But in this case, the friend didn't own the land—she was the owner, and the friend was the grantor, transferring the land to her. Wait, no, wait, the friend is the grantor here. Wait, the grantor is the woman, who conveyed the land to her friend. Wait, no, wait—no, the woman is the one who conveyed the land to her friend, so the friend is the grantor, and the woman is the grantee? Or is the woman the one who received the land? Wait, the question says the woman conveyed the land to the friend. So the friend is the grantor, the woman is the grantee? Or vice versa?

Wait, no, no. A deed is between a grantor and grantee. In this case, the woman is the grantee and the friend is the grantor. So the land is with the woman. But the land's use for liquor gives the cousin and their heirs the right to the property. 

But when the friend dies, what happens? So in 2004, the friend died, and the land was used for the crop. Let's think about the ownership. The land is in the woman's name. But then, the land's use for liquor grants the cousin and their heirs the right to the property. So, the cousin has a tenancy in interest, but the land is also in the woman's name. So the land's use for liquor is a separate interest.

Wait, no, when you transfer a property, the grantor's estate generally takes the property, but some interests are held in the grantor's name. So when the friend died, her estate would take over the land. But the land's use for liquor is a separate interest, so the cousin gets those.

So when the friend dies, the land is with the woman. But the land is subject to the use for liquor, which affects the property.

Wait, another way: the friend is the grantor, and the woman is the grantee. So the land is given to the woman. But the land is used for the crop—wait, no, in the description, the land is used for liquor, which gives the cousin and their heirs the right. So the land's use for liquor is a tenancy in interest. So perhaps the woman owns the land, but the land's use for liquor gives her cousin a tenancy in interest in the land.

Wait, but when the friend died, the land goes to the woman's estate. But the land's use for liquor is a separate interest. So the cousin is entitled to a tenancy in interest in the land, which is in the woman's name.

So when the friend dies, the land is still in the woman's name, but the cousin's interest is in the land. So the cousin would have a claim according to the land's use for liquor.

But wait, the question says the land is for consideration of one dollar, receipt acknowledged, and then the land is used for the crop. So the land's use for liquor is a transfer of property. So the land is given to the woman, and then, in 2004, she uses it for the crop, which triggers the tenancy in interest to go to the cousin and his heirs.

But wait, the option is about the proceeds from the crop. So when the land is used for the crop, the right to the land is transferred to the cousin. So the cousin gets the land, and she can take the proceeds.

But the woman's estate may have the land, but the cousin has a tenancy in interest. So the cousin gets the land. The proceeds from the crop would be hers, since that's what she gets in the land. But wait, the land is in the woman's name, and the cousin's interest is in the land. So the woman could have the land, but the cousin's interest is separate. 

Wait, but the land is in the woman's name, so the cousin's tenancy in interest is in the land. So when she uses it for the crop, the cousin gets the land, which she can then use for the crop. So the proceeds would be hers. However, if the cousin's interest is not valid, she can re-enter and take back her property, but that's about her rights now, not about the proceeds from the crop.

So the proceeds from the crop are hers because she's the one who owns the land, and she's entitled to the land, which she can use for the crop.

But wait, the answer options involve the cousin and the woman. Let's look at the options.

Option D: The cousin. So the cousin is entitled to the land, so she can take the proceeds. Option D.

Alternatively, the land's use for the crop would transfer the interest to the cousin, so that's the way it's set up. But the woman's estate would take the land. But when the friend died, the woman's estate would take the land. But the cousin has a tenancy in interest, so she can take the land, and thus the proceeds.

Wait, another thought: the land is given to the woman in 2001. Then the friend (who is the grantor) dies in 2004. So the woman's estate would take the land. But the land's use for the crop triggers the cousin's tenancy in interest. So the cousin gets the land, and when the land is used, the cousin gets the crop. So the cousin would get the proceeds.

Wait, but the option says the woman's heirs. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The land is in the woman's name, but the cousin's interest is a tenancy in interest. So the woman can't have the land unless she has a tenancy in interest. But she's the grantee, so she doesn't have a tenancy in interest. So the cousin's interest is in the land, which is in the woman's name.

So when the friend died, the woman's estate should take the land, but the land's use for the crop would transfer the interest to the cousin. So the cousin gets the land, and when the land is used, the cousin gets the crop. So the cousin would get the proceeds.

Wait, but the option B says the cousin and the woman equally. That doesn't seem right, because the cousin has a tenancy in interest, and the woman doesn't. So she can’t own the land.

Alternatively, the woman's estate would take the land, but the cousin's interest is in the land. So the cousin can take the land, and thus the proceeds. So the answer would be D: The cousin.
</think>

The deed transfers a tract of land to the woman in 2001, conveying it for consideration of one dollar. The use of the land for the crop triggers a tenancy in interest to the cousin and his heirs. However, the woman is the grantee and does not have a tenancy in interest. The woman's estate, which takes over the land upon the friend's death, inherits the property. The cousin has a tenancy in interest in the land, which is in the woman's name. Therefore, the cousin is entitled to the land and can take the proceeds from the crop. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: The woman.** Incorrect. The woman does not have a tenancy in interest in the land.
- **B: The cousin and the woman equally.** Incorrect. The woman does not have a tenancy in interest, so she cannot own the land.
- **C: The cousin's heirs.** Incorrect. The cousin does not have heirs; the heirs of the cousin would take the land.
- **D: The cousin.** Correct. The cousin's tenancy in interest in the land grants him the right to take the proceeds.
- **E: The state.** Incorrect. No state action is relevant here.
- **F: The woman's heirs.** Incorrect. The woman does not have heirs.
- **G: Divided equally between the friend's heirs and the woman.** Incorrect. The woman is not entitled to the land.
- **H: The friend's next of kin.** Incorrect. The friend dies intestate, and the woman's estate takes over the land.
- **I: The friend's heirs.** Incorrect. The friend's heirs are not relevant here because the estate of the friend takes over the land.
- **J: None of the above.** Incorrect. Option D is correct.

The correct answer is **D: The cousin.**

ANSWER: D
