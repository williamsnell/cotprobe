Okay, so I have this differential equation problem here, and I need to find the value of the Wronskian at a point given some information. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The equation given is t y'' + 2 y' + t e^t y = 0. I know that y1 and y2 are fundamental solutions, which means they form a fundamental set, so their Wronskian is non-zero. The Wronskian W(y1, y2) is defined as the determinant of a matrix with y1, y2 and their derivatives. The problem says that W(y1, y2)(1) = 2, and we need to find W(y1, y2)(5).

Hmm, I remember that the Wronskian of solutions to a linear differential equation can be used to find properties like whether solutions are linearly independent. Also, there's something about the Wronskian changing with respect to the independent variable. Oh right, there's Abel's theorem which relates the Wronskian to the coefficients of the differential equation.

Abel's theorem states that if you have a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation like t y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0, then the Wronskian W(y1, y2) satisfies the equation W' = - (p(t)/t) W(t), provided t is not zero, because the leading coefficient is t. Wait, let me make sure I get the correct expression.

Wait, the standard form for Abel's theorem is y'' + P(t) y' + Q(t) y = 0. So in our case, dividing the given equation by t:

y'' + (2/t) y' + e^t y = 0.

So P(t) is 2/t, and Q(t) is e^t.

Abel's theorem says that W' = - [P(t)] * W(t). So here, P(t) is 2/t, so W' = - (2/t) W(t).

So the differential equation for the Wronskian is W' = -2 W / t.

This is a first-order linear ODE for W(t). The integrating factor method can be used here. Let me think. The standard form for integrating factors is W' + (2/t) W = 0. Wait, no, Abel's theorem gives W' = -2W/t, so that can be rewritten as W' + (2/t) W = 0.

Wait, no: Let me re-express W' = -2 W / t. So it's W' + (2/t) W = 0. That simplifies to W' + (2/t) W = 0. This is a linear ODE, and we can solve it.

The integrating factor is e^{∫ (2/t) dt} = e^{2 ln t} = t^2.

Multiplying both sides by t^2: t^2 W' + 2 t W = 0. Which is the derivative of (t^2 W) with respect to t. So d/dt (t^2 W) = 0. Thus, t^2 W = C, where C is a constant.

Therefore, W(t) = C / t^2.

Wait, so W(t) = C / t².

We are given that at t = 1, W(1) = 2. So substituting t=1, W(1) = C / (1)^2 = C. So C = 2.

Therefore, W(t) = 2 / t².

Now, the question is asking for W(5). So plug in t=5: W(5) = 2 / (5)^2 = 2/25.

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option I is 2/25. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The differential equation is t y'' + 2 y' + t e^t y = 0. Divided by t: y'' + (2/t) y' + e^t y = 0. So it's in standard form where P(t) is 2/t. So the Wronskian W satisfies W' = -P(t) W = - (2/t) W. So integrating factor is t², leading to W(t) = C / t². Given W(1)=2, so C=2. So at t=5, it's 2/(5)^2 = 2/25. So the correct answer is option I, which is 2/25.

The differential equation is \( t y'' + 2 y' + t e^t y = 0 \). Dividing through by \( t \) gives \( y'' + \frac{2}{t} y' + e^t y = 0 \), which is in the standard form \( y'' + P(t) y' + Q(t) y = 0 \) with \( P(t) = \frac{2}{t} \) and \( Q(t) = e^t \). Using Abel's theorem, the Wronskian \( W(y_1, y_2) \) satisfies:

\[
W' = -\frac{P(t)}{1} W = -\frac{2}{t} W
\]

This is a first-order linear ODE, which can be solved using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is:

\[
\mu(t) = e^{\int \frac{2}{t} dt} = t^2
\]

Multiplying through by \( t^2 \) gives:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} (t^2 W) = 0
\]

Thus, \( t^2 W = C \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( W(t) = \frac{C}{t^2} \).

Given \( W(1) = 2 \), we find \( C = 2 \). Hence, \( W(t) = \frac{2}{t^2} \). Evaluating at \( t = 5 \):

\[
W(5) = \frac{2}{5^2} = \frac{2}{25}
\]

The correct answer is **I: 2/25**.

\[
\boxed{I}
