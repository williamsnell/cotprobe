Question:

Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team. She appears emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea?

Options:

A: Polycystic ovarian syndrome
B: Prolactinoma
C: Cushing's syndrome
D: Premature ovarian failure

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer for this medical question. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 17-year-old girl with a history of not having a menstrual period for 6 months. She's unconcerned about it, which might mean she's aware but not sure why. Her mother brings her in, so her symptoms are likely due to something she's experiencing.

Her father's name isn't given, but some medical conditions might be more common in girls. Let's look at the clues. First, her last menstrual period was irregular one year ago. She had menses at regular 28-day intervals before that, which suggests a possible pattern change. Her last menstrual period was 6 months ago, so maybe she's experiencing irregular cycles again.

She's a member of her high school gymnastics team, which might not directly affect the medical condition, but it's a background factor.

Looking at her symptoms: she's emaciated, which is low in body mass, making her appear weak. Her height is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in), weight 40 kg (88 lbs), BMI 15 kg/m². BMI 15 is considered underweight, which is unusual because many conditions have a BMI threshold. So maybe she's in a condition that affects her weight.

Her pulse is 54 beats per minute (which is a bit fast) and blood pressure 80/50 mmHg. High BP, which often points towards hypertension, but she's not having regular menstrual periods. So hypertension may not be the primary issue here.

Looking at the options:

A: Polycystic ovarian syndrome. This causes irregular periods, irregular menses, and higher-than-normal egg production. It's a common cause for irregular cycles.

B: Prolactinoma. This is a condition that causes irregular menses, often with high blood pressure and blood sugar problems. But I'm not sure if it's a common cause of irregular menstrual periods.

C: Cushing's syndrome. This leads to irregular menstrual periods and weight gain. Cushing's is a condition where a hormone (estrogen) is too high, causing irregular cycles and increased body weight. She has irregular periods, which fits, but her weight is 40 kg, which is a bit high. Wait, Cushing's can cause irregular periods, but for someone already on menopause, does she have Cushing's? Or maybe her symptoms point to another condition.

D: Premature ovarian failure. This is when the ovaries stop producing eggs before ovulation, causing irregular menses. It can cause irregular cycles and weight gain, but I'm not sure about blood pressure. She has high BP (80/50), which is high, so maybe not.

E: Hyperthyroidism. High thyroid function can cause irregular menses and weight gain, but it's usually associated with higher body fat, especially with hypothyroidism. But her blood pressure is high, which would indicate a condition that affects both high blood pressure and weight.

F: Pregnancy. But she's 16 years old; she hasn't had a menstrual period for 6 months, so she's not in a pregnancy. So F is probably not the answer.

G: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This is a condition where the hormones that usually regulate the menstrual cycle (like estrogen) are low. This can cause irregular cycles, weight gain, and high blood pressure. It's a possibility. But I'm not sure if it's more common in this setting.

H: Hypothyroidism. This causes weight gain and irregular menstrual cycles. Her weight is high, but her blood pressure is high, which can happen in both conditions.

I: Turner syndrome. This affects the ovaries and can cause irregular cycles, weight gain, and high blood pressure. But her height and weight suggest it's more of a hormonal condition.

So, looking at the symptoms:

- Irregular menses: The most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome (A) because it's a known disorder that causes irregular cycles, high egg production, and higher body weight.

- Blood pressure high: Cushing's and polycystic ovary both can cause high blood pressure.

- Weight: She's 40 kg, which is higher than average for a 16-year-old (average is around 28 kg). So a high weight could point to either Cushing's (which can cause higher weight) or polycystic (which can cause higher weight too). But Cushing's is typically a more common cause of irregular periods and weight.

- Other factors: She's 17, hasn't had regular periods for 6 months. But since her doctor brought her, it's possible she's in a condition that causes irregular cycles.

Other options like Cushing's: If she's on Cushing's, she would have irregular periods, high weight, high blood pressure, and maybe other symptoms. But she wasn't told about her weight here.

Wait, but according to the options, the correct answer is A: Polycystic ovarian syndrome because it's a common cause of irregular cycles, high weight, and irregular menses. It's a well-known condition, so the most likely answer is A. The other options (like Cushing's) aren't necessarily the first choice given the symptoms.

The patient is a 17-year-old girl experiencing irregular menstrual periods for 6 months, with no concerning symptoms. She appears emaciated, tall, and has a BMI of 15 kg/m², high blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg, and a pulse rate of 54 beats per minute. Her height and weight suggest she is in a condition that affects body fat and irregularity, but her symptoms point more directly to an underlying hormonal cause.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **A: Polycystic ovarian syndrome**  
  This condition causes irregular menstrual periods, high egg production, and higher-than-normal body weight. It fits the irregularity and weight increase.

- **B: Prolactinoma**  
  Often associated with high blood pressure and irregular menses, but there's no indication of hypoglycemia or high blood sugar.

- **C: Cushing's syndrome**  
  Causes irregular periods and weight gain, but Cushing's typically leads to higher body weight.

- **D: Premature ovarian failure**  
  Results in irregular menses and weight gain, but high blood pressure is a hallmark of this condition.

- **E: Hyperthyroidism**  
  Can cause irregular periods and high blood pressure, but it's less common in this setting.

- **F: Pregnancy**  
  Unlikely, as she hasn't had 6 months of no menstrual periods.

- **G: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**  
  Low hormones leading to irregularity and high blood pressure, but not the most common cause here.

- **H: Hypothyroidism**  
  Causes weight gain and irregularity, but the high blood pressure is a key indicator.

- **I: Turner syndrome**  
  Affects the ovaries, causing irregularity, weight gain, and high blood pressure, but not the primary cause of the symptoms.

**Conclusion:**  
The most likely cause of the irregular menstrual periods, along with irregularity and high weight, is **polycystic ovarian syndrome (A)**.

**ANSWER: A**
