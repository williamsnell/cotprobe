Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Century Shoe Company buying a machine and depreciating it. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm. The machine was bought for $1200, and depreciation is being done at 20% of the declining balance. I need to find the book value at the end of 3 years. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what "declining balance" means. Oh right, it's a method of accelerated depreciation where the depreciation rate is applied to an asset's book value each year, not the original cost. So it's like, each year the book value decreases, and the depreciation is higher in the earlier years.

The rate is 20% each year. But wait, wait. Oh no, wait. 20% is the rate, but is it applied as a percentage of the original cost or the current book value each year? Oh, right, it's the declining balance rate, so it's applied to the current book value. So each year, the depreciation is 20% of the current book value, and the book value decreases by that amount each year.

So, let me outline the steps. The initial cost is $1200. Each year, the book value is multiplied by (1 - rate), which is 80%, since 20% is taken as depreciation.

Wait, no. Wait, the rate is 20% of the declining balance. So each year, the depreciation is 20% of the current book value. So that would be 0.20 times current book value. So the book value after each year is current book value minus (0.20 * current book value), which is same as multiplying by 0.80 each year.

So for each year, the book value is multiplied by 0.80.

So for year 1: 1200 * 0.8 = 960.

Year 2: 960 * 0.8 = 768.

Year 3: 768 * 0.8 = 614.40.

Wait, that would be the book value at the end of 3 years. Let me check the options. Option I is $614.40. Oh, so that's the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake? Because in some cases, the depreciation is calculated as a straight line. But the question specifies declining balance, so I shouldn't assume that. The problem says it's the declining balance rate of 20%, so I think I did the right approach.

So the calculation for each year:

Year 1: 1200 * 0.8 = 960.

Year 2: 960 * 0.8 = 768.

Year 3: 768 * 0.8 = 614.40.

So the book value at the end of 3 years is $614.40, which is option I.

The book value at the end of 3 years is calculated using the declining balance method, where each year's depreciation is 20% of the current book value. 

- After Year 1: $1200 * 0.8 = $960.
- After Year 2: $960 * 0.8 = $768.
- After Year 3: $768 * 0.8 = $614.40.

The book value at the end of 3 years is $614.40, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
