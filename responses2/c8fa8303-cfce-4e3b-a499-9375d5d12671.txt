Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Brittany's behavior. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that Brittany used address stickers sent by a charity in the mail. Then, she felt obligated to mail a donation to the organization that sent the stickers. The options are various biases and theories, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with how people assess the responsibility they feel towards someone. When someone gives something to a charity, they might feel a duty to act similarly. But I'm not exactly sure which concept this refers to.

Let me think about the options. Option A is stereotyping, which is when someone generalizes a stereotype about a group. That doesn't seem to fit because Brittany is acting on personal feelings, not a generalization.

Option B is the reciprocity norm. I think reciprocity norm is about people acting on the principle that what they receive in exchange should be reciprocated. So if a person gives something to a charity, they might feel a moral obligation to do the same. That sounds like what Brittany is doing.

Option C is the halo effect. That's when people believe a person is deficient because they are so similar to someone else. Like, if you're the same as a famous person, you'd think they're bad. But here, Brittany is being obligated to act, not being similar to someone else. So probably not C.

Option D is the bystander effect. That's when you feel an obligation to help because others are helping. But Brittany is acting on her own, not because others are helping. So D is probably not it.

Option E is door-in-the-face technique. That's when someone gives a gift because they feel forced to do so, not because they think it's necessary. But here, she felt obligated, which implies she felt it was a duty, not forced. So E is more about necessity than obligation.

Option F is cognitive dissonance theory. That deals with why people change their behavior to avoid discomfort. But this is about moral obligation, not just changing behavior to avoid discomfort.

Option G is the just-world phenomenon. This is about the idea that certain actions are more likely if they align with a just world. It's more about ethics and moral reasoning, not about the obligation to act in a certain way.

Option H is the self-serving bias. That's when people make decisions in a way that benefits them, thinking it's right. But Brittany is feeling a duty, not making a decision to act. So H might be about someone being self-serving, but not the act itself.

Option I is the fundamental attribution error. That's when people attribute someone's behavior to their own characteristics rather than the group dynamic. For example, blaming a crime on being lazy instead of someone else's actions. But this is a personal feeling, not a judgment about group behavior.

Option J is the mere exposure effect. That's when someone learns something after being exposed to it. But here, it's about feeling a duty, not learning.

Wait, maybe I should think again about the halo effect. If someone is similar to a famous person, they might think they're bad, but in this case, she's feeling a duty to act, not because others are bad. So the halo effect doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, the reciprocity norm makes sense because she's feeling a moral obligation to act in the same way. If a charity sends something, she feels she should do the same.

The correct answer is B: the reciprocity norm. Brittany felt a moral obligation to act because she used address stickers from a charity, mirroring the principle of reciprocity. This principle suggests that what one receives in exchange should be reciprocated, indicating a personal obligation. 

Answer: B
