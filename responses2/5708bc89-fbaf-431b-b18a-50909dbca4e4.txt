Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which sampling method an auditor would use to estimate a numerical measurement like the dollar value of inventory. Hmm, let's think about what each sampling method does.

First, I remember that numerical estimates involve determining something like totals or averages based on sample data. So the auditor is probably looking to estimate a specific amount, maybe the total value of inventory.

Looking at the options:

A: Variable sampling. I think variable sampling is when the sample size is determined based on the expected variability of the population. It's often used for estimating numerical values where the variability is high. So maybe this is about estimating totals or averages.

B: Discovery sampling. That sounds more like a method where the auditor identifies the items that might be over or under the estimate. It's often used in auditing to find material misstatements, but I'm not sure if it's for numerical estimates.

C: Snowball sampling. That's where you start with a small group and then ask them to refer others. I don't think that's used for numerical estimates; it's more of a network sampling method.

D: Stratified sampling. This involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) and sampling each. It's useful for reducing variability, but if the strata are homogeneous, maybe this isn't the best method for estimating a numerical value. Or maybe it's used when the strata have different characteristics.

E: Systematic sampling. This is where you select every nth individual from a list. It's often used when there's a known pattern in the population. I'm not sure if systematic sampling is the primary method for estimating numerical values in inventory. It might be used more for audits where the population is ordered in some way.

F: Attribute sampling. This is about estimating proportions, like the percentage of defective items. It's more about yes/no answers or categories, not numerical totals.

G: Random-number sampling. This is straightforward; every item has an equal chance of being selected. It's a common method for various purposes, including sampling for numerical estimates. So this could be a candidate.

H: Quota sampling. Similar to stratified, it's about dividing based on certain criteria and then sampling from each. It's typically used for non-proportional representation, but not sure if it's best for exact numerical estimates.

I: Cluster sampling. This involves selecting clusters (like schools or hospitals) randomly and then sampling within them. It's efficient when clusters are homogeneous, but for inventory, where individual items might have more variability, cluster might not be the best.

J: Convenience sampling. This is the opposite; it's based on availability and ease of access. It's not systematic or random, so probably not the best method for precise numerical estimates.

Back to the question: The auditor is estimating a numerical value, like dollar value. So the method should allow for precise estimation. Variable sampling and stratified could be options, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, systematic and random-number might be better.

Wait, I think variable sampling is often used for estimating totals or averages. For example, estimating the total dollar value of inventory by sampling items, calculating the average value, and then multiplying. So variable sampling could be used.

Alternatively, systematic and random-number might be used for other purposes, like attribute sampling where they might use random numbers to select items, but for numerical estimates, variable sampling seems more relevant.

So among the options, A (variable sampling) and G (random-number) are possibilities. But I'm not sure if variable sampling is more specific for numerical measurements.

Wait, another thought: stratified sampling might be used when the population has subgroups that vary a lot. But if the auditor wants to estimate a numerical value that's uniform across the population, maybe variable sampling is better.

Wait, but another point: attribute sampling is for proportions (like defective items), variable sampling for numerical estimates. So maybe the correct answer is A: variable sampling.

Alternatively, maybe the most common method for estimating numerical values is variable sampling.

Wait, I think that variable sampling is used for estimating numerical values where the items vary a lot. So the correct answer would be A: Variable sampling.

The correct answer is A: Variable sampling. Variable sampling is used to estimate numerical values by determining the sample size based on the expected variability, making it suitable for estimating the dollar value of inventory.
