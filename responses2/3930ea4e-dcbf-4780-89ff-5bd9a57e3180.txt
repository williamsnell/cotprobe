Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about figuring out how long it'll take a machine to fill 500 bottles if it can fill 200 in 12 minutes. Hmm, I think I need to find the rate at which the machine works and then apply that rate to 500 bottles.

First, let's find the time it takes to fill one bottle. If 200 bottles take 12 minutes, then one bottle would take 12 minutes divided by 200. Let me calculate that: 12 / 200 equals 0.06 minutes per bottle. That's pretty fast, but maybe the machine is very efficient.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Since the machine fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes, I can find out how many sets of 200 are in 500 and then multiply by the time taken per set. So, 500 divided by 200 is 2.5. That means it's 2.5 times the amount of bottles.

So, if 200 bottles take 12 minutes, then 2.5 times that would be 12 * 2.5. Let me compute that: 12 * 2 is 24, and 12 * 0.5 is 6, so 24 + 6 equals 30 minutes. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here because 200 to 400 is 2. So 200 bottles take 12 min, 400 would be 24 min, 600 would be 36 min, 800 would be 48 min, 1000 would be 60 min, and 1200 would be 72 min. Wait, but I only need 500. So 500 is halfway between 400 and 600, which are 24 and 36. So halfway is 30. That's consistent with my initial calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up a proportion. The rate is bottles per minute. So, 200 bottles in 12 minutes is the rate. So, for 500 bottles, the time t is (500 / 200) * 12 minutes. Let me compute that: 500/200 is 2.5, so 2.5 *12 =30. So yes, 30 minutes.

Wait, but looking at the options, 30 is option E. So the answer should be E:30 minutes. But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it's 30, but let me think again.

Wait, another approach: 200 bottles take 12 minutes, so per bottle is 12/200 = 0.06 minutes. So 500 bottles would take 500 * 0.06 = 30 minutes. Yep, same result. So I think the correct answer is E, 30 minutes.

The machine fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes. To find the time for 500 bottles, we calculate the rate per bottle as 12/200 = 0.06 minutes per bottle. For 500 bottles, multiply 500 * 0.06 = 30 minutes.

Answer: E) 30 minutes
