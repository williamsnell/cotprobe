Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about determining the molar mass of tobacco seed globulin based on its crystal properties. Hmm, I remember that the molar mass can be found using the density of the crystal, the unit cell dimensions, and Avogadro's number. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall the formula that relates density, molar mass, and the geometry of the crystal. Oh right, there's something called the formula involving the unit cell volume, the number of atoms per unit cell, and Avogadro's number. The formula is density (d) equals (Z * M) divided by (a^3 * N_A), where Z is the number of formula units per unit cell, M is molar mass, a is the edge length of the unit cell, and N_A is Avogadro's number.

Wait, the unit cell is a cubic one, so the volume is a cubed. And the problem says that the unit cell dimension is 12.3 nm. Oh wait, nm is nanometers, which is 1e-9 meters. But since the calculations will involve units, I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Unit cell edge (a) = 12.3 nm. To convert to cm, since density is given in g/cm³, I should convert a to centimeters. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, and 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1 nm is 1e-7 cm. So 12.3 nm is 12.3e-7 cm. That's 1.23e-6 cm.

Wait wait, 12.3 nm = 12.3 x 10^-9 m. To convert to cm, multiply by (100 cm / 1 m) → 12.3e-9 m * 100 cm/m = 12.3e-7 cm. So 1.23e-6 cm. Okay, that's 1.23e-6 cm.

The density (d) is 1.287 g/cm³.

Now, I need to find Z, the number of formula units per unit cell. I think for face-centered cubic (FCC) structures, Z is 4. Wait, yes, because in an FCC structure, each corner contributes 1/8th of an atom, and the face centers contribute 1/2 each. So corners: 8 atoms * 1/8 = 1 atom. Each face has 6 faces, but wait, each face contributes 1/2 of an atom, so 6*(1/2) = 3. So total atoms per unit cell is 4. So Z=4.

Now, the formula: d = (Z * M) / (a³ * N_A)

Rearranging for M: M = (d * a³ * N_A) / Z

Let me plug in the values.

d = 1.287 g/cm³
a = 1.23e-6 cm
Z =4
N_A = 6.022e23 mol⁻¹

So let's compute each part step by step.

Compute a³: a is (1.23e-6 cm), so a³ = (1.23)^3 * (1e-6)^3 cm³.

1.23 cubed is approximately (1.23)*(1.23)=1.5129, then *1.23 ≈ 1.8608. So a³ ≈ 1.8608e-18 cm³.

Wait, wait, (1.23e-6)^3 = (1.23)^3 * (1e-6)^3 = 1.8608e-18 cm³.

N_A is 6.022e23 per mol.

So a³ * N_A = 1.8608e-18 *6.022e23 = ?

Let me compute that. 1.8608e-18 *6.022e23 = (1.8608 *6.022) * 1e5.

1.8608 *6.022: Let me approximate.

1.86 *6 is 11.16, but more accurately:

6 *1.8608=11.1648, 0.022 *1.8608≈0.04094. So total ≈11.2057. So 11.2057e5 cm³·mol⁻¹.

Wait, wait, no: 1e-18 *1e23 =1e5, so yes, 1.8608e-18 *6.022e23 = (1.8608 *6.022) *1e5. Let me compute 1.8608 *6.022:

1.8608 *6=11.1648
1.8608 *0.022=0.0409376
Total: 11.1648 + 0.0409376=11.2057376 → 11.2057 ≈11.2057.

So a³ N_A = 11.2057e5 cm³·mol⁻¹.

Now, d *a³ N_A = 1.287 g/cm³ * 11.2057e5 cm³·mol⁻¹.

Multiply 1.287 *11.2057e5.

1.287 *11.2057 = let me calculate:

Approximate 1.287 * 11 =14.157, 1.287 * 0.2057≈0.265.

So total ≈14.157 +0.265≈14.422.

So 14.422e5 g/mol.

Then M = (d*a³ N_A)/Z → (14.422e5) g/mol /4.

14.422e5 /4 = 3.6055e5 g/mol.

Wait, 14.422e5 is 1.4422e6, divided by 4 is 3.6055e5, which is 3.6055e5 g/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 3.61e5. So that's option H.

Wait, but wait. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up exponents.

Wait, a is 12.3 nm. 12.3e-9 meters → 12.3e-7 cm. So a is 1.23e-6 cm. So a³ is (1.23e-6)^3 =1.8608e-18 cm³.

N_A is 6.022e23 per mol.

So a³ * N_A is 1.8608e-18 *6.022e23 = 1.8608 *6.022 * 1e5 → (11.2057) *1e5 → 1.12057e6 cm³·mol⁻¹.

Wait, wait, no. 1.8608e-18 *6.022e23 → 1.8608 *6.022 = approx 11.2057, and the exponents: 1e-18 *1e23 = 1e5. So 1.8608e-18 *6.022e23 = 11.2057e5 cm³·mol⁻¹.

Then d is 1.287 g/cm³.

So d *a³ N_A is 1.287 * 11.2057e5 → 1.287 *11.2057 is approx 14.422→ 14.422e5 g/mol.

Divide by Z=4: 14.422e5 /4 =3.6055e5 g/mol.

So 3.6055e5 is approximately 3.61e5. Looking at the options, option H is 3.61e5 g/mol.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine the molar mass of tobacco seed globulin, we use the relationship between density, molar mass, and the geometry of the crystal. The formula is:

\[
d = \frac{Z \cdot M}{a^3 \cdot N_A}
\]

Rearranging for molar mass \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{d \cdot a^3 \cdot N_A}{Z}
\]

### Given Data:
- Unit cell edge (\( a \)) = 12.3 nm = \( 1.23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{cm} \)
- Density (\( d \)) = \( 1.287 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \)
- Avogadro's number (\( N_A \)) = \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)
- Number of formula units per unit cell (\( Z \)) = 4 (for an FCC structure)

### Step 1: Calculate \( a^3 \)
\[
a^3 = (1.23 \times 10^{-6})^3 = 1.8608 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( a^3 \cdot N_A \)
\[
a^3 \cdot N_A = (1.8608 \times 10^{-18}) \cdot (6.022 \times 10^{23}) = 1.12057 \times 10^6 \, \text{cm}^3 \cdot \text{mol}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Multiply by density (\( d \))
\[
d \cdot (a^3 \cdot N_A) = 1.287 \cdot (1.12057 \times 10^6) = 1.4422 \times 10^6 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Divide by \( Z \) to get \( M \)
\[
M = \frac{1.4422 \times 10^6}{4} = 3.6055 \times 10^5 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The molar mass of tobacco seed globulin is approximately \( 3.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{g/mol} \), which corresponds to **option H**.
