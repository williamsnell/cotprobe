Okay, so I have this question about rounding numbers to the nearest 10. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that a coach rounded the number of runners to the nearest 10, and the rounded number is 400. I need to find which actual number could be the real count from the options given.

First, I should remember how rounding works. When you round to the nearest 10, you look at the units digit. If it's 5 or higher, you round up; if it's below 5, you round down. So for example, 411 would round to 410 because the units digit is 1, which is less than 5. But 420 would also round to 420 because the units digit is 0.

Looking at the options:

A: 411 → Rounding here would give 410, so the rounded number is 410, not 400.
B: 382 → The units digit is 2, so it rounds down to 380.
C: 420 → The units digit is 0, so it rounds to 420.
D: 447 → The units digit is 7, so it rounds up to 450.
E: 375 → The units digit is 5, so it would round up to 380, but wait, no. Wait, 375 is 375. The units digit is 5, so when rounding to the nearest 10, you round up. So it would be 380.
F: 397 → The units digit is 7, so it rounds up to 400.
G: 406 → The units digit is 6, so it rounds up to 410.
H: 435 → The units digit is 5, so it rounds up to 440.

Wait, the question says the rounded number is 400. So which options round to 400 when rounded to the nearest 10?

Looking again:

E: 375 → Rounds to 380
F: 397 → Rounds to 400
G: 406 → Rounds to 410
H: 435 → Rounds to 440
C: 420 → Rounds to 420
B: 382 → Rounds to 380
A: 411 → Rounds to 410

Wait a minute, wait. Let me check each option's units digit again:

Option F: 397 → The units digit is 7, so it rounds up to 400. So 397 rounds to 400, but wait, is that correct? Oh wait, no. Wait, 397 is 397. When rounding to the nearest 10, the units digit is 7, which is more than 5, so you round up the tens place. 397 becomes 400. So F is 397, which rounds to 400. But wait, the problem says the rounded number is 400. So F is a possible option.

Wait, but earlier I thought option F rounds to 400. Let me double-check the other options.

Option E: 375 → 375. The units digit is 5. So, when you round to the nearest 10, it's rounded up. So 375 becomes 380. So E rounds to 380, not 400.

So which options round to 400? F:397, and any others?

Wait, let's think again. The actual number is some number that when rounded to the nearest 10 is 400. So the actual number could be anywhere from 395 to 404 inclusive. Because anything below 395 would round down to 390, and anything above 405 would round to 410.

Wait, no. Wait, the standard rule is:

If the units digit is 5 or more, you round up. So for example, 395 would round to 400 because 5 is the units digit. Similarly, 396 would round to 400, 397 to 400, 398 to 400, and 399 to 400.

Then, 400 would round to 400 as well, but it's the same as the rounded number. So any number from 395 to 404 would round to 400.

Looking at the options, which are in that range?

Looking back:

F:397 → 397 is within 395-404. So F is 397, which rounds to 400.

Other options:

E:375 → 375 is below 395, so rounds to 380.

G:406 → 406 is above 405, so it rounds to 410.

H:435 → 435 is above 405, so rounds to 440.

A:411 → 411 is above 405, so rounds to 410.

B:382 → below 395, rounds to 380.

C:420 → rounds to 420.

D:447 → rounds to 450.

So the only option that rounds to 400 is F:397.

The correct answer is F: 397, which rounds to 400 when rounded to the nearest 10.

Answer: F
