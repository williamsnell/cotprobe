Okay, so I need to figure out what PEST stands for. Hmm, I remember seeing it somewhere in my studies. Let me think. I think it's related to project management or something like that. Oh right, PEST is an acronym for Political, Economic, Social, and Technological factors. Wait, but sometimes it's the other way around. Oh, no, I think it's the combination of the four factors that are important in planning projects. So it's a method to assess the impact of various factors on a project. I should look it up, but since I'm just trying to remember, I'll go with what I recall. The options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Let me check each option. Option A says Political, environmental, strategic, social. That doesn't fit because PEST doesn't include environmental factors. Option B is Political, economic, strategic, testing. Testing seems a bit off because PEST is more about impact rather than testing. Option C is Political, economic, social, testing. Again, testing doesn't seem right. Option D is Political, environmental, social, testing. Environmental isn't part of PEST, so that's out. Option E is Political, environmental, strategic, testing. No, testing isn't included. Option F is Political, economic, strategic, technological. That's close, but I think PEST is about social and economic, not technological. Option G is Political, economic, social, strategic. That matches because PEST includes all four factors. Option H: Political, environmental, social, technological. Environmental is a factor, so that's incorrect. Option I: Political, economic, social, technological. That's also incorrect because PEST doesn't include 'economic' in that context. Option J: Political, environmental, strategic, technological. Environmental again, so no. So the correct answer should be G, which lists the four factors without environmental. I think I'm confident now.
