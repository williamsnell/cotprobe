Okay, so I've got this interest question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again: James took a loan of $240 for 30 days at 6% interest. How much interest did he have to pay? The options are A to J, with various amounts.

Hmm, so I remember that interest can be calculated in a few different ways. I think the basic formula is simple interest, which is Principal multiplied by Rate multiplied by Time. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if there's more to it here. Oh right, sometimes when dealing with loans, you might have to consider compounding, but I don't think that's needed here. It's a short-term loan, maybe 30 days, so compounding isn't really an issue.

So the principal here is $240. The rate is 6%, which I need to convert into a decimal. So 6% is 0.06. The time is 30 days. Now, I'm a bit confused about the time unit. The rate is usually per year, so I need to adjust the time. There are 365 days in a year, so I can calculate the time as 30/365. Alternatively, sometimes people use a 30/360 day count, which is common in banking. Wait, I think the question probably expects the simple interest calculation without considering the exact day count, so probably 30/365.

So the formula is I = P * R * T. Plugging in the numbers: I = 240 * 0.06 * (30/365).

Let me compute that step by step. First, 0.06 times 240. 0.06 * 240 is 14.4. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. 240 * 0.06 is 14.4. Oh, wait no, that's not correct. Wait, 240 * 0.06 is 14.4? Let me calculate: 240 * 0.06 = 14.4. Yes, that's right. So I = 14.4 * (30/365).

Now, 30 divided by 365 is approximately 0.08219178. So multiplying 14.4 by 0.08219178. Let me compute that. 14.4 * 0.08 is 1.152. Then 14.4 * 0.00219178 is about 0.03155. Adding them together, 1.152 + 0.03155 is approximately 1.18355.

Wait, that's about $1.18. But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are 0.36, 14.40, etc. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should be using a different day count method. Like, sometimes people use 30 days in a month for interest calculations, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the question uses a different formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to approach it is to calculate the daily interest and then multiply by the number of days. The daily rate would be 6% divided by 365, which is approximately 0.016438%. Then, the total interest is 240 * (0.06 / 365) * 30.

Let me compute that. 0.06 / 365 equals approximately 0.00016438. Multiply that by 30 gives 0.0049314. Multiply by 240: 240 * 0.0049314 is approximately 1.18355, which is about $1.18. Still not matching any of the options given.

Wait, maybe the interest is simple, but let me check if perhaps the question is using 30 days per month. Oh wait, that's not correct. Or perhaps the question is about simple interest, but using a 30-day month. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the time should be 30/365, but perhaps I should compute it differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different time period. Wait, but 30 days is exactly 1/12 of a year. So 6% per annum times 1/12 would be 0.5% per month. But that seems a bit low. Let me see: 0.06 * (30/365) = 0.06 * 0.08219178 ≈ 0.0049315. So 240 * 0.0049315 is 1.18355, which is $1.18. So that's roughly $1.18. But none of the options match that.

Looking at the options again: option F is $12.00, which is much higher, so that's probably not the case. Option D is $2.40, which is double what I got. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate. 6% of 240 is 14.4, but that's the annual interest. For 30 days, we take 30/365 of the annual interest. So 14.4 * (30/365) = 14.4 * (30/365).

Calculating 30/365: 30 divided by 365 equals 0.08219178.

So 14.4 * 0.08219178 = let's compute that exactly. 14.4 * 0.08 is 1.152, and 14.4 * 0.00219178 is approximately 0.03155. So 1.152 + 0.03155 = 1.18355, which is about $1.18. Hmm, but that's not an option. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the interest is compounded, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the rate is applied as simple interest but with a different time period. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the time is calculated as 30/360 days, which is a common method in some financial calculations. So 30 divided by 360 is 0.083333. So 6% times 0.083333 is 0.5%. So 240 * 0.5% is 240 * 0.005 = 1.20. Oh, that's $1.20, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm not sure why I thought of 360 days. Because sometimes banks use 360 days for interest calculations, especially for loans. So if the time is 30/360, then the interest is 240 * 0.06 * (30/360).

Let me compute that: 30/360 is 1/12. So 0.06 * (1/12) = 0.005. So 240 * 0.005 is 1.20. So that's $1.20, which is option J.

But wait, in that case, the interest is 1.20, but earlier I calculated 1.18 when using 365 days. So which one is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to use the 360-day method, which is more common in banking. So the interest would be $1.20, which is option J.

But earlier, when I computed using 365 days, I got approximately $1.18, which is close to $1.20 but not exactly. However, none of the options match exactly. So looking at the options, option D is $2.40, which is double what I calculated. Maybe I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, let me redo the 365-day calculation more precisely. 30/365 is approximately 0.08219178. 0.06 * 240 is 14.4. 14.4 * 0.08219178 = let's compute that precisely.

0.08219178 * 14.4. Let's multiply 14.4 by 0.08219178.

14.4 * 0.08 = 1.152

14.4 * 0.00219178 = 14.4 * 0.002 = 0.0288, plus 14.4 * 0.00019178 is approximately 0.002766. So total is 0.0288 + 0.002766 = 0.031566.

Adding those gives 1.152 + 0.031566 = 1.183566, which is approximately $1.18. So that's about $1.18, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct approach is to use 360 days.

So under 360 days, the interest is 240 * (0.06 * (30/360)).

0.06 * (30/360) = 0.06 * (1/12) = 0.005. So 240 * 0.005 = $1.20. So that's option J.

Wait, but I remember that in some cases, simple interest is calculated as (Principal × Rate × Time) where Time is in years. So if the time is 30 days, that's 30/365 years. So that's approximately 0.08219178 years. 240 × 0.06 × 0.08219178 = 240 × 0.0049315 ≈ 1.18356, which is about $1.18. So why is there no option for that? So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is using a different method, like simple interest but with a different time factor. Or perhaps it's a bank loan and uses a different method, but I'm not sure.

Looking back at the options, option D is $2.40, which is double of my 1.18. Hmm. But why would that be the case? Unless the question is using 6% per annum and 30 days, but perhaps the time is calculated as 30/365 and the principal is $240, but perhaps the calculation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about simple interest but with a different formula, like I = P * R * T, but with T being in days and then divided by 365. Let me try that.

Wait, another way to think about it: Sometimes, simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * (T/360). So using 360 days, which is a common convention in some countries. So T is 30 days, so 30/360 is 1/12. So 240 * 0.06 * (30/360) = 240 * 0.06 * 0.0833333 = 240 * 0.005 = 1.20, which is option J.

But then again, why would the correct answer be $1.20? Because in that case, option J is the answer. But wait, earlier, when I used 365 days, I got approximately $1.18, which is closer to $1.20 but not exact. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the interest is $1.20, which is option J. But I'm not sure why my first method gave a slightly different number.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a 30/360 day count, which is common in some systems. So 30/360 is 1/12. So the interest is 240 * (0.06) * (1/12) = 240 * 0.005 = $1.20. So that's option J.

So the correct answer would be J, $1.20.
</think>

The correct answer is J: $1.20.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the formula for simple interest:**  
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:  
   \[ I = P \times R \times T \]  
   where:  
   - \( P = \$240 \) (principal amount)  
   - \( R = 6\% \) per annum (rate)  
   - \( T = 30 \) days  

2. **Convert the time period to a fraction of a year:**  
   Since the question doesn't specify a compounding method, we'll assume simple interest with \( T \) as a fraction of a year.  
   \[ T = \frac{30}{360} = \frac{1}{12} \approx 0.083333 \]  

3. **Calculate the interest using the 360-day convention:**  
   Using the 360-day method (common in some financial calculations):  
   \[ I = 240 \times 0.06 \times \frac{30}{360} \]  
   \[ I = 240 \times 0.06 \times 0.083333 \]  
   \[ I = 240 \times 0.005 = \$1.20 \]  

4. **Verify the calculation:**  
   - 0.06 (6%) of 240 is 14.4.  
   - 30 days is a fraction of a year: \( 30/360 = 1/12 \approx 0.083333 \).  
   - Multiplying 14.4 by 0.083333 gives approximately 1.20.  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The correct interest paid is \$1.20, which corresponds to option J.
