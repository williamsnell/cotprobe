Okay, so I have this economics question about labor and marginal revenue product (MRPL). Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says a firm hires labor for $15 each and sells products for $3. The MP of the 3rd worker is 10. The options are about whether the firm should hire more or less labor, or change the price.

Hmm, I remember that MRPL is calculated as the marginal product (MP) multiplied by the price (P) of the product. So MRPL = MP * P. So here, the MP is 10, and P is 3. So MRPL for the third worker is 10 * 3 = $30.

But what's happening with the firm in the short run? Well, the firm has a fixed cost of labor because they pay $15 per worker. So if they hire more workers, their total cost increases. But the question is about the MRPL. Wait, MRPL is the additional revenue from hiring another worker. So each time you hire a worker, the MRPL is the extra revenue generated by that worker. 

So if the firm is considering hiring another worker, the marginal revenue product would determine whether it's profitable. If MRPL is positive, and if the price is greater than the wage rate, the firm would want to hire more. But wait, the wage rate is the cost of labor, which is $15 per worker. So the wage rate is the minimum price the firm needs to get that worker. 

In this case, the price is $3, which is much lower than the wage rate. So each additional worker brings in more revenue than the cost of labor. Because if you have 10 workers, each brings in $30 (since 10 * 3 = 30), but you have to pay $15 per worker. So the profit per worker would be 30 - 15 = $15. So each worker adds $15 to profit.

But wait, the question is about whether the firm should hire more. The marginal revenue product is 30, which is greater than the wage rate of 15. So if the firm is hiring, say, more workers, each additional worker's MRPL should be compared to the wage rate. If MRPL is higher than the wage rate, it's profitable to hire them. 

In this case, the MRPL is already at 30, which is more than the wage rate. So each additional worker increases MRPL? Wait, not exactly. Let me think again. The MRPL is calculated as MP * P. So if you have more workers, each one's MRPL could be higher than the wage rate. But in this case, the current MP is 10, so the current MRPL is 30, which is higher than the wage rate of 15.

Wait, so the current MRPL is 30, which is higher than $15. So the marginal revenue product of the next worker would also be 10 * 3 = 30. So if the firm hires another worker, their MRPL remains the same. Then why would they hire more? Because each additional worker brings in the same MRPL as before.

Wait, but wait. If the firm is already at the optimal point where the marginal revenue product equals the wage rate, they would not hire more. But in this case, the MRPL for the 3rd worker is 30, same as any additional worker. So the 4th worker would also add 30. But since the wage is 15, which is less than 30, the firm is making a profit each time they hire another worker.

Wait, but the question is about the firm's decision to hire more or less. So if the MRPL of the next worker is equal to the wage rate, it's the point where the firm is indifferent between hiring another worker or not. But in this case, the MRPL is higher than the wage rate. So if the firm is already considering hiring another worker, each additional worker adds 30 to MRPL. Wait, but the wage is 15. So the firm's profit from hiring each worker is 30 - 15 = 15 per worker, which is positive. So the firm should hire more workers because each added worker increases profit by 15. 

Wait, no. The MRPL is the additional revenue generated by the worker. So if the MRPL is higher than the wage rate, the firm's decision is to hire more. Because each additional worker brings in more revenue than their cost. So if the MP is 10, and P is 3, the MRPL is 30. The wage is 15. So each added worker contributes 30, which is more than the cost. So the firm should hire more workers, increasing MRPL.

Wait, but the options. Let's look at the options. 

Option H says: "The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase." That would be correct because each new worker brings in 30, which is higher than the wage rate of 15. So the MRPL is increasing as more workers are hired.

Alternatively, if the price were higher, more workers would be hired. But in this case, the price is lower than the wage rate. Wait, in this case, the price is $3, and the wage is $15. So each worker brings in 30, which is more than $15. So the MRPL is higher than the wage. So the firm should hire more workers.

Wait, but the question is whether the MRPL should increase. So if the firm is already at the point where each additional worker brings in 30, which is higher than 15, they should hire more. So the MRPL would increase as they hire more.

So looking at the options, option H says "the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase." That seems correct.

Wait, but wait another point. The question is about what's the 'most true'. Let me think again. The question is, which statement would be most true.

The options are about the direction of hiring (more or less) and the effect on MRPL. So when the firm hires more workers, the MRPL increases because each additional worker brings in more than the wage. So the MRPL increases as the firm hires more workers. 

So the correct statement would be that the firm should hire more labor so that MRPL increases. So option H says that. 

Alternatively, looking at option B: "The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease." That's the opposite. But that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck. When the firm hires more workers, each subsequent worker's MRPL is the same as the first. So the MRPL doesn't change as you hire more, but the value of the profit (MRPL - wage) does increase. So each new worker adds 30 to MRPL. But the profit per worker is 15 (30-15). So as you hire more, the marginal profit increases because each worker's MRPL is higher than the wage. 

So the MRPL increases as more workers are hired. Thus, the correct decision is to hire more, and the MRPL increases. 

Looking at the options, option H says the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase. So that's correct.

The question involves a firm that hires labor for $15 each and sells its products for $3 each. The marginal product (MP) of the 3rd worker is 10. To determine whether the firm should hire more or less labor and how MRPL (marginal revenue product) changes, we calculate MRPL as MP multiplied by the price per unit (P). Here, MRPL = 10 * 3 = $30. Since the wage rate is $15, which is less than the MRPL of $30, the marginal revenue product of each additional worker is higher than the wage rate. This means that hiring more labor increases MRPL while also increasing the firm's profit per additional worker. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The firm should not maintain the current level of labor because each additional worker increases MRPL.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Hiring more labor increases MRPL, not decreases it.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Hiring less labor would decrease MRPL, but it's not optimal in this case.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Increasing the price of the product would not necessarily increase MRPL; it depends on how price affects MRPL.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Increasing the price would increase MRPL, but it's not relevant here since the price is fixed at $3.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Hiring less labor would decrease MRPL, which contradicts the fact that MRPL is higher than the wage.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Changing the price would affect MRPL, but the price is fixed at $3.
- **Option H**: Correct. The firm should hire more labor so that MRPL increases, as each additional worker adds $30 to MRPL while the wage rate remains at $15.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Maintaining the current level of labor would not increase MRPL.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Maintaining the current level of labor would decrease MRPL.

The correct answer is **H**: The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase.
