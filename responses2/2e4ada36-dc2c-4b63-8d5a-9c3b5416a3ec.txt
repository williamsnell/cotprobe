Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of days required for $1,640 to produce $6.56 in interest at a 4% rate. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that interest is usually calculated using simple interest, right? The formula is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is the time in years. Wait, but the question asks for days, not years. Oh, right, because interest is typically calculated on a daily basis unless specified otherwise.

So, the problem gives me I = $6.56, P = $1,640, and R is 4% per annum. I need to find T in days. Since the rate is annual, I should convert the time from days to a fraction of a year.

Let me jot down the values:
I = $6.56
P = $1,640
R = 4% per annum, which is 0.04 as a decimal.

The formula I = P * R * T needs to be rearranged to solve for T. So, T = I / (P * R).

Plugging in the numbers:
T = 6.56 / (1640 * 0.04)

Wait, let me calculate the denominator first. 1640 multiplied by 0.04. Let's see, 1640 * 0.04 is the same as 1640 * 4/100, which simplifies to (1640 * 4)/100. 1640 *4 is 6560, so 6560/100 is 65.6.

So T = 6.56 / 65.6.

Hmm, let me compute that. 6.56 divided by 65.6. Let me see: 65.6 goes into 6.56 how many times? Since 6.56 is less than 65.6, it's 1/10th or 0.1. Wait, no, 65.6 * 0.1 is 6.56. Exactly. So T is 0.1 years.

But wait, that's a year. I need the number of days. One year is 365 days. So 0.1 years is 36.5 days.

Wait, but the options are whole numbers. Let me check the options again. The options are 40, 36, 50, 25, 32, 28, 55, 30, 60, 45.

Hmm, 36.5 is close to 36 or 37 days. Looking at the options, B is 36 days and E is 32. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should consider if the interest is calculated differently, like compounding. But the question doesn't mention compounding, so I think it's simple interest.

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator. 1640 * 0.04. Let's compute 1640 * 0.04: 1640 * 4 = 6560, divided by 100 is 65.6. So that part is correct.

I = 6.56. So 6.56 divided by 65.6. Let's compute that. 6.56 / 65.6 = 0.1.

So T is 0.1 years. So 0.1 * 365 days is 36.5 days. So approximately 36.5 days. But the options don't have 36.5, so the nearest is 36 or 30 or 32. Option B is 36, but maybe I should check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, another possibility is that the question uses simple interest, but perhaps the rate is annual but the time is in days, so maybe it's better to compute using the exact number of days.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula or a different method. Let me think, maybe it's simple interest and the time is in days, so perhaps using 365 days in a year.

Wait, another approach: the number of days is (T in years) multiplied by 365. So if T is 0.1 years, then 0.1 * 365 = 36.5 days. So 36.5 is approximately 36 or 37 days. But the options don't have 36.5. So perhaps 36 days is the closest option.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me check: 1640 * 0.04. 1600 *0.04=64, and 40 *0.04=1.6, so total 65.6. Correct.

So T = 6.56 /65.6 = 0.1 years. 365 days *0.1 =36.5 days. So about 36.5 days.

Looking at the options, B is 36 days. So the answer would be B.

The number of days required for $1,640 to produce $6.56 in interest at 4% is approximately 36.5 days. Since the closest option is 36 days, the answer is B.
