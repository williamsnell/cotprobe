Okay, so I have this problem here where a programmer earns $6.50 an hour and his take-home pay is 81% of his gross pay. I need to find out how many hours he must work to take home $200. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that take-home pay is a percentage of his gross pay. So, if his gross pay is $6.50 per hour, then his take-home is 81% of that. Let me write that down.

Take-home pay = 81% of gross pay
Which means Take-home = 0.81 * Gross pay.

So, Gross pay is his hourly rate, which is $6.50. So, Take-home = 0.81 * 6.50. Let me calculate that.

Wait, actually, I don't think I need to compute the exact take-home amount for each hour, but rather find the number of hours needed to reach a total of $200. Hmm.

So, if he works H hours, his take-home is 0.81 * 6.50 * H. And I need this to be equal to $200.

So, equation: 0.81 * 6.50 * H = 200

I can rearrange this to solve for H. Let me compute 0.81 *6.50 first.

Calculating 0.81 *6.5. Hmm, 6 * 0.81 is 4.86, and 0.5 * 0.81 is 0.405. Adding those together gives 4.86 + 0.405 = 5.265. So, 5.265 per hour.

So, 5.265 * H = 200. To find H, I divide both sides by 5.265.

H = 200 / 5.265

Let me compute that. 200 divided by 5.265. Let me see, 5.265 times 37 is about 5.265 *30=157.95, 5.265*7=36.855. Adding them gives 194.805. That's less than 200. Let me try 38 hours.

5.265 *38. 5.265*30 is 157.95, 5.265*8 is 42.12. Total is 157.95+42.12=200.07. Oh, that's just over.

So, 38 hours gives approximately $200.07, which is more than $200, but since we're dealing with hours, maybe exactly 38.007 hours? But you can't work a fraction of an hour in pay structures, so perhaps 38 hours is the answer.

Looking at the options provided:

A: 40
B:36
C:34
D:38
E:30
F:45
G:32
H:48
I:42
J:50

So, D is 38. That would be the correct answer. So, the function is H = 200 / (0.81*6.50), which simplifies to H = 200 /5.265, and H is approximately 38.007, so 38 hours is needed.
</think>

The function to find hours needed is \( H = \frac{200}{0.81 \times 6.50} \). Calculating this gives approximately 38 hours.

Answer: D) 38 hours
