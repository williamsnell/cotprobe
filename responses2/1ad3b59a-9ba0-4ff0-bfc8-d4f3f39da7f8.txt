Okay, so I've got this problem about designing a bar to resist pure tension. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my materials, but I'll think through it.

The question says we need a bar to resist 4000 lb of pure tension. The factor of safety is 2.5, and the tensile strength is 175 psi. Wait, I remember that factor of safety relates to the allowable stress, which is the tensile strength divided by the factor of safety. Oh right, so first I need to find the allowable stress.

So, Allowable stress σ_allow = Tensile strength / Factor of safety. Let's plug in the numbers: 175 psi / 2.5. Hmm, 175 divided by 2.5. Let me calculate that. 2.5 times 70 is 175, so σ_allow is 70 psi. Got it.

Next, I remember that for a bar under tension, the stress is force divided by area. So σ = F/A. We can rearrange that to find the area: A = F / σ. F is 4000 lb, σ is 70 psi. So A = 4000 / 70. Let me compute that. 70 goes into 4000 how many times? 70 times 57 is 3990, so 57.14 approximately. So the area needs to be at least 57.14 square inches.

Wait, but the options are given as dimensions, so I need to find which option gives an area of about 57.14 square inches. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 14 in. × 3 in. Area is 42 in². Hmm, that's less than 57. Not enough.

Option B: 16 ×4 is 64. That's more than 57. But wait, maybe it's possible to choose a larger bar than needed, but the question is about the bar's minimum dimensions that can carry the load. So maybe B is a possible candidate.

Option C: 18 ×6 is 108. Definitely larger than needed. So C could be a possible choice, but perhaps a smaller area is better? Or maybe the factor of safety is determined by the maximum area.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thing to consider is the factor of safety in terms of the shape. Maybe the cross-sectional area isn't the only consideration. But I think for pure tension, the critical factor is indeed the factor of safety relating to the allowable stress.

Wait, but another formula I remember is the minimum cross-sectional area A = (F) / (S.F. * σ_y). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The allowable stress is σ_allow = σ_y / S.F. So yes, that's correct. So the area is F / σ_allow.

So back to the calculation: A = 4000 / 70 = 57.14 in². So we need a bar with an area of at least 57.14. Let's check the options.

Option B: 16 x4 =64, which is larger than 57.14. So it's sufficient. But what about the other options?

Option D is 15x5=75, which is also good but larger. Option C is 18x6=108, which is even better. So in terms of required area, B is sufficient, but maybe the question is about the minimum dimensions. Alternatively, perhaps the bar's diameter is important, but the question is about cross-section, not diameter. So if the bar is circular, we have to compute the required diameter. Hmm, but the options are given as rectangles, so maybe the area is the primary consideration.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the bar's dimensions are more critical in terms of being able to handle the stress without being too thick. Like, sometimes a larger area might be more practical. Alternatively, perhaps the bar's minimum size is determined by the required cross-sectional area.

Looking again, option B is 16x4 in, which is 64 in². Which is over 57, so it's acceptable. Option D is 15x5=75, which is also good. Option C is 18x6=108, which is way more, but perhaps the problem is to choose the smallest possible dimension, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the bar's minimum dimensions are the smallest possible to meet the required area, but that's not clear.

Wait, but the question is to "design a bar to resist pure tension of 4000 lb. based on a factor of safety of 2.5." So the bar's cross-sectional area needs to be sufficient to handle the tension. So the area must be at least 57.14 in².

Looking at the options, B gives 64 in², which is sufficient. D gives 75, which is also sufficient. C gives 108, which is even better. So which one is the correct answer? Because all of B, D, and C meet the area requirement.

But wait, perhaps I should think about whether these dimensions can be achieved. Like, are the options presented in terms of cross-sectional area, or dimensions of the bar? Because the options are given as dimensions, not area.

So, for a rectangular bar, the area is length times width. So for option B: 16 inches by 4 inches, the area is 64. So the bar would have to be 16 inches long and 4 inches wide? Or wait, sometimes the dimensions refer to the cross-section, not the length. So for a bar, if the bar is 16 inches in one dimension and 4 in the other, that's the cross-section. So the cross-section is 16x4 in.

Wait, but when I'm thinking about the bar's length, I think the bar's length isn't given, but the cross-sectional area is, so the dimensions are sufficient. So for example, if the bar is 16 inches by 4 inches, then the cross-section is 16x4, and the length can be anything. So that's acceptable.

So, of the options, B gives 64 in², which is above the required 57.14. So in that case, B is a possible answer. But wait, the question is about the bar's minimum dimensions. Oh, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-sectional area is 57.14. So any option with area >= 57.14. So B is 64, which is sufficient. D gives 75, which is also sufficient, and C gives 108. So all of these are sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The stress calculation: 4000 lb is the force. So Area = F / σ_allow. σ_allow is 70 psi. So 4000 /70 = 57.14 in². So the cross-section must be at least 57.14.

So the options are:

A: 14x3=42 <57.14 → No.

B:16x4=64 → Yes.

C:18x6=108 → Yes.

D:15x5=75 → Yes.

So all of B, C, D are possible.

Wait, but the factor of safety is 2.5. So if the bar's area is lower, would that affect the factor of safety? Or is the factor of safety determined solely by the allowable stress, regardless of the cross-sectional area? Because if I take a smaller cross-section, the stress would be higher, but the allowable stress is fixed as 70 psi. So in that case, if the bar has a smaller cross-section, the stress would be higher than allowable. Wait, but that would not be allowed because the bar would not be safe under the given load.

Wait, so perhaps I have to make sure that the cross-sectional area is at least 57.14 in², regardless of the factor of safety. Because the factor of safety is based on allowable stress, which is fixed. So if the cross-section is too small, the stress would be too high, and the bar would not be safe.

So all options B, C, D are acceptable in terms of area. But among these, perhaps the question expects the minimum required cross-sectional area, meaning the smallest possible area that meets the requirement. So in that case, the minimum required area is 57.14, so the smallest area is B:64 in². But wait, that's not correct because option B is 64, but option D is 75, which is larger. So the minimum area is 57.14, which is less than B's 64. So perhaps the question expects the bar to have the smallest possible area that can handle the load, which would be just over 57.14. So between the options, which one is the smallest area that is >=57.14.

Looking at the options:

A:42

B:64

C:108

D:75

So the smallest area satisfying the requirement is B:64 in². So option B would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the bar's length is considered as well. Oh, but the problem states the bar is designed for pure tension, and the factor of safety is based on the allowable stress. So the cross-sectional area is the main factor here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering a bar that is long enough to handle the load, but the cross-sectional area is the key. So to ensure that the bar can handle 4000 lb under tension, the cross-section must be adequate. The length isn't given, but perhaps the bar doesn't need to be longer than a certain length, but that's not specified. So the cross-sectional area is the main concern.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 16x4 inches. Because that cross-sectional area is the smallest option that's above 57.14.
</think>

To design a bar to resist pure tension of 4000 lb with a factor of safety of 2.5 and a tensile strength of 175 psi, the allowable stress is calculated as:

\[
\sigma_{\text{allow}} = \frac{\text{Tensile strength}}{\text{Factor of safety}} = \frac{175 \, \text{psi}}{2.5} = 70 \, \text{psi}.
\]

The required cross-sectional area is then:

\[
A = \frac{\text{Force}}{\sigma_{\text{allow}}} = \frac{4000 \, \text{lb}}{70 \, \text{psi}} \approx 57.14 \, \text{in}^2.
\]

The cross-sectional area of each option is calculated as follows:

- **Option A (14 in. × 3 in.):** \(14 \times 3 = 42 \, \text{in}^2\). This is less than 57.14, so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (16 in. × 4 in.):** \(16 \times 4 = 64 \, \text{in}^2\). This is greater than 57.14, so it is sufficient.
- **Option C (18 in. × 6 in.):** \(18 \times 6 = 108 \, \text{in}^2\). This is also sufficient but larger than necessary.
- **Option D (15 in. × 5 in.):** \(15 \times 5 = 75 \, \text{in}^2\). This is sufficient but larger than necessary.

Since the question asks for the bar to resist pure tension, the cross-sectional area must be at least 57.14 in². Among the options, **Option B (16 in. × 4 in.)** is the smallest area that meets the requirement. While Option D is also sufficient, Option B is the most practical choice as it uses the smallest dimensions.
