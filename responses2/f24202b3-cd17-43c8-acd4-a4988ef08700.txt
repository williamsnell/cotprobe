Okay, so I have this question about atomic weight, but wait, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Atomic weight usually refers to the mass of a single atom, right? But the question says "the atomic weight of electrons." That doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo or a trick question. Let me think.

Oh wait, perhaps the question is actually about finding the number of moles of electrons per gram or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's a play on words, like atomic weight of electrons being the same as the mass of the electron, but in grams per mole. But that doesn't make sense because an electron's mass is really tiny.

Wait, the given data is the mass of an electron: 9.109 ×10^-28 grams. Let me look at the options. Oh, option A is 1.67e-24 g/mole. That's like the mass of a proton, right? Because a proton mass is about 1.67e-24 g/mole. But wait, electrons are lighter than protons. Electrons have a mass of about 9e-28 g each. So how would that translate into options?

Wait, the question is about the atomic weight of electrons. Wait, atomic weight is the mass of an atom, so for an electron, it would be the mass of one electron. But the options don't have anything matching that—option A is way bigger than that. Unless the question is asking for the number of moles of electrons in a gram, which would be the reciprocal of the mass per mole.

Wait, wait, maybe the question is about finding the molar mass of electrons. Because molar mass is grams per mole. So if each electron has a mass of 9.109e-28 grams, then how many moles would that be per gram? That would be 1 gram divided by 9.109e-28 grams per mole. Let me compute that.

So 1 / (9.109e-28) equals approximately 1.097e+27 moles per gram. But looking at the options, option G is 1.81e-25, which is way smaller. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the mass of the atom, not the electron. Because if the question was about the atomic weight, it would probably ask for the mass of a single atom. But the options don't present that.

Wait, another possibility: The question might be phrased as the atomic weight of electrons, but that's an odd term. Maybe it's a translation error or a typo. Another possibility is that the question is actually about finding the number of moles of electrons in 1 gram. Because electrons are light, so that would be a large number.

Wait, let me recalculate. If the mass of one electron is 9.109e-28 grams, then the number of moles in 1 gram would be 1 / (9.109e-28) = approx 1.097e+27 moles per gram. But looking at the options, option G is 1.81e-25, which is 1e-10 times smaller. So that doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute 1/(9.109e-28). 9.109e-28 is 9.109 multiplied by 10^-28. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.097e27, which is 1.097 x 10^27 moles per gram. But none of the options match that.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E:6.02e23, which is about Avogadro's number. That's the number of particles in a mole. Oh wait, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, the options include something around 1e-24. Option A is 1.67e-24, which is the mass of a proton. So why would that be the atomic weight of electrons?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of electrons per gram. Wait, that doesn't make much sense either. Because electrons are so light that a gram would have a lot of them.

Wait, perhaps the question is reversed. What's the atomic weight of electrons? That doesn't make sense. So maybe the question is actually about the molar mass of an electron, which is its mass. But the options provided don't include that.

Wait, the mass of an electron is 9.109e-28 grams. So if the question is about the molar mass (g per mole), then the molar mass would be the same as the mass of the electron, because one mole is Avogadro's number of electrons. But Avogadro's number is about 6e23, so 9.109e-28 g * 6e23 is about 5.46e-4 grams per mole. That's option C.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the molar mass is the mass of one mole of electrons. So if each electron is 9.109e-28 grams, then a mole (6e23 electrons) would weigh about 5.46e-4 grams. So option C is 5.48e-4, which is close.

So the correct answer would be C.

The question asks for the atomic weight of electrons, which is a non-sensical term because electrons are light particles, not whole atoms. However, the question likely intends to ask for the molar mass of electrons, which is the mass of one mole of electrons. 

The mass of a single electron is given as \(9.109 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{g}\). To find the molar mass, we multiply this mass by Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}\)):

\[
\text{Molar mass of electrons} = (9.109 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{g}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}) \approx 5.48 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **Option C: \(5.48 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/mol}\)**.
