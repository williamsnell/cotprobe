Okay, so I have this question about a meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues from 1999. The question is about what benefits a company gets from implementing flexitime. Flextime, I think, refers to the ability to work longer hours without pay, so employees can work more hours and perhaps take days off. 

I remember that a meta-analysis is a statistical analysis of a large number of studies. So they probably looked at multiple studies to find a consistent effect. The options are various organizational outcomes, like job stress, communication, productivity, and so on.

I think the key here is to remember what flextime does. Flextime allows employees to choose when they work, which can reduce stress because there's no pressure to work consistently. It might also make communication easier since employees can connect with each other more flexibly. Additionally, taking off days can improve productivity because people are more available and can focus on their tasks.

Wait, but what about job satisfaction? Flextime might not directly improve job satisfaction, but it could make employees feel more free to take on more responsibilities, which might contribute to higher satisfaction. Or maybe it's the other way around, where high job satisfaction leads to more flexible work arrangements.

Looking at the options, the best fit would be productivity. Because employees can work longer hours, they can produce more goods or services, leading to higher output. That makes sense.

Other options like job stress (A) could be a result, but is the study specifically about stress or other outcomes? I think the study focused on productivity because they probably found that more flexible hours increased output.

Options like self-rated performance (E) and absenteeism (F) might be related, but the main point of the study was about productivity. So I'm leaning towards C, productivity.

The correct answer is **C: productivity**. A meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues in 1999 found that implementing flextime increases productivity by allowing more hours of work without pay, leading to higher output and better performance.
