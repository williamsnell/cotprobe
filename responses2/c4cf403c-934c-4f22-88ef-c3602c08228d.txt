Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. It says, "Identify the algebraic expression that matches the word phrase: 4 times as many cans as Tom collected." Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, let me understand the components. The phrase is talking about cans, and it's comparing the number of cans someone has to the number Tom collected. The phrase uses "times as many as Tom collected," which I think means Tom's collection multiplied by 4. 

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. "4 times as many as Tom collected" could also be interpreted as Tom's collection multiplied by 4, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. 

If Tom collected, say, 5 cans, then 4 times as many as Tom would be 20 cans. So that's 4 * 5 = 20. So the expression would be 4 times Tom's cans. If Tom's cans are represented by a variable, let's say t, then Tom collected t cans. So 4 times that would be 4t. 

Looking at the options, option A is 4t, which seems correct. Let me double-check the other options to make sure none of them could be right. 

Option B is 4 - t. That would be subtracting Tom's cans from 4, which doesn't fit the phrasing. Option C is 4/t, which would imply division, but the problem says 4 times as many, not a division. Option D is t - 4t, which simplifies to -3t, which doesn't make sense in this context. Option E is 4 + t, which is addition, but the phrase is about multiplication, not addition. 

Option F is t + 4, which is also addition. Option G and H are t over 4, which again is division, not multiplication. Option I is t - 4, another subtraction. 

So the only option that correctly represents 4 times Tom's collection is option A: 4t. Therefore, I think the answer is A.

The correct algebraic expression is option A: 4t.
