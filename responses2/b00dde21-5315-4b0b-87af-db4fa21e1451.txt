Question:

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?

Options:

A: Nitroprusside
B: Verapamil
C: Alteplase
D: Furosemide
E: Phentolamine
F: Atorvastatin
G: Carvedilol
H: Metoprolol
I: Lisinopril
J: Warfarin

Okay, I'm trying to figure out what the best next step is for this patient. Let's see, the patient is a 25-year-old man who developed chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time. He's been there for an hour. His vital signs are pretty normal: 37.5°C, 110 bpm, 16 min respiration, 200/100 mmHg BP. His oxygen saturation is 95%, and his pupils are normal—equal, round, reactive to light. Lungs are clear, so no infection or infection-related obstruction.

He's diaphoretic, which means he can feel the breath coming in and out. His blood pressure is a bit elevated, but not too bad. No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. He's oriented, so no panic or confusion. He's getting oxygen and IVs, but he's still having chest pain and shortness of breath.

Looking at the ECG, it shows sinus tachycardia—so the heart is racing faster than usual. No ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, which suggests no significant electrolyte imbalances. His chest pain is radiating down his arm, which could be related to his snoring. He's been snoring for a while, given he's taken cocaine for the first time.

The patient's condition is likely to be an acute secondaryomyopathy (ASM), which is often caused by snoring, especially when someone with a history of snoring or a history of a heart condition is present. However, this patient doesn't have a history of a heart condition, but his chest pain and BP might indicate something else. But since they're both elevated, it's likely a muscle or nerve issue.

Now, the question is about the next pharmacotherapy. Looking at the options, I need to find a treatment that's appropriate for his condition.

Nitroprusside is a muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory. It's often used in cases of muscle pain or issues like diaphoretism. Verapamil is an antihypertensive, which might be a consideration if the BP is high. Alteplase is a muscle relaxant. Furosemide is an antiplatelet. Atorvastatin is a statin, which is usually for heart attack prevention, but sometimes for other conditions. Carvedilol is a statin, but I'm not sure. Metoprolol is an antihistamine and blood thinner, used in certain conditions. Lisinopril is an antihistamine. Warfarin is a blood thinner, which is less likely needed if blood clots are normal.

Looking at the patient's case, he's on a high dose of an antiplatelet (325 mg aspirin) and IVs, so maybe he's at risk for clots. If he has chest pain and diaphoretism, other options would be helpful. Alteplase is a muscle relaxant, which could help with muscle spasms. Nitroprusside is another option for muscle relaxation. Verapamil might help with hypertension if present.

Wait, but the patient's BP is elevated but not high enough to be a problem. Maybe he's on a statin, but that's usually a low dose, not high. Also, since he's on aspirin, maybe he needs to take that for another condition.

Wait, the patient's BP is 200/100. That's a bit high but not life-threatening. So perhaps he doesn't need a statin. Alteplase would be an option, but I'm not sure if it's the first choice.

Another option is atorvastatin, which is a statin and used for heart attacks and high blood pressure. But if he's on aspirin and taking statins, maybe both are needed or one replaces the other.

Wait, the options are additional to what he's already taking—supplement oxygen, aspirin, IVs. So the question is, which of these is the best to start next.

Alteplase is a muscle relaxant, which can help with muscle spasms. Nitroprusside is another option. Verapamil is for hypertension. Furosemide is for blood clots. The other options are less likely.

Wait, the patient's chest pain is due to snoring, which is a muscle condition. Alteplase is often used to help reduce muscle tension. Nitroprusside can help with muscle spasms. However, since he's already on an antiplatelet, maybe another option is better.

Wait, but if he's on aspirin, perhaps he needs to take it for another reason. But if he's on an antiplatelet, maybe he's at risk for clots. Alteplase could help with that, but I think the next step would be to consider another option.

The next step is to consider options that are not already being given. Since he's on aspirin, maybe he's on high doses and needs to take another statin. But the options don't include a higher dose. Alternatively, maybe he's on a low dose and needs to consider another.

Wait, let me think again. The patient's chest pain is a muscle issue, and he's on aspirin and IVs. Alteplase is a muscle relaxant, which could help with muscle spasms. Nitroprusside is another option for muscle relax. So both could be options.

Alternatively, perhaps he's on a statin but needs to consider another. Furosemide is an antiplatelet, but if he's already on aspirin, maybe that's a different issue. Or he's on another condition.

Looking at the options, Alteplase is an option (C), and Nitroprusside is another option (A). Verapamil (B) is an option. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the patient's chest pain is from snoring, which is a muscle condition. Alteplase might help by reducing muscle tension. Nitroprusside is also used for muscle relaxation. Both could be options. But which is more appropriate given the other options?

Alternatively, Furosemide is an antiplatelet, but if he's on aspirin, maybe he's not at risk for clots, so Furosemide might not be necessary. Alteplase is an option, but I'm not sure if it's the first line of treatment for muscle pain or diaphoretism.

Wait, the patient is on an antiplatelet (aspirin) and if his blood pressure is high, perhaps he needs another statin. But the question is about the next pharmacotherapy, so perhaps the next step is to consider another muscle relaxant.

Alternatively, maybe the next step is to consider a muscle relaxant, like Alteplase. Alternatively, if he has a high BP, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options include Alteplase (C) and Nitroprusside (A). The question is, which is more appropriate.

Another point: The patient's blood pressure is 200/100. That's a bit high but not life-threatening. He's on an antiplatelet, so maybe he's at high risk for clots. Alteplase can help with that. Alternatively, if he's on high doses, maybe he's already at a high risk.

Wait, but he's on 325 mg of aspirin. Maybe he needs to consider adding another antiplatelet. But the options don't have a higher dose. So perhaps the next step is to take Alteplase.

Alternatively, perhaps he should consider another option.

Wait, another option is atorvastatin (G), but I'm not sure if that's appropriate here.

Wait, the patient is on a high dose of aspirin, so perhaps he's on a higher dose than usual. That might indicate a heart condition. If so, he would need a statin. But the options don't have a higher dose. So perhaps he's on a low dose, and the next step is to consider another.

Wait, let me think about the other options. Verapamil is an antiplatelet, but if he's on aspirin, maybe he's already on a high dose. So perhaps he's not at risk for clots.

Alternatively, if he's on both, maybe he needs a statin. But the options don't have a high dose.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the correct answer is among them.

I think Alteplase is a muscle relaxant, which could help with muscle spasms. Nitroprusside is another option. Both could be possible.

But I'm trying to recall what the primary treatment for diaphoretic chest pain with muscle tension is. Alteplase is often used for that. Nitroprusside is for muscle relax.

Alternatively, perhaps the next step is to consider other options.

Wait, wait, the patient's diaphoretic chest pain—diaphoretic is related to diastatic muscle tension. Alteplase is a muscle relaxation drug. So maybe Alteplase is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is Alteplase (C), but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another approach: The patient's chest pain radiates down his arm, which is a muscle issue. Alteplase is used to reduce muscle tension, which could alleviate the pain.

So probably, the next step would be to consider Alteplase as the next pharmacotherapy. So option C.
</think>

The patient is a 25-year-old man with chest pain and shortness of breath due to snoring after taking cocaine for the first time. He is on an antiplatelet (aspirin), IVs, and supplemental oxygen, with normal vital signs, clear lungs, and no edema. The most appropriate next pharmacotherapy should address the muscle-related chest pain (diaphoretism) and prevent complications like clots.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **Alteplase (C):** A muscle relaxant that can help reduce muscle tension, alleviating the pain and improving breathing.
- **Nitroprusside (A):** Another muscle relaxant that might be used for similar purposes.
- **Furosemide (F):** An antiplatelet typically used for heart conditions, but the patient's BP is elevated but not life-threatening.
- **Atorvastatin (G):** A statin used for heart attack prevention, but the patient is on aspirin, suggesting possible heart condition.
- **Warfarin (H):** A blood thinner, unlikely needed if blood clots are normal.
- **Lipatase (I):** Not listed, so irrelevant.
- **Lorazepam (J):** Not listed, so irrelevant.
- **Altravecilline (A):** Not listed, so irrelevant.
- **Verapamil (B):** An antiplatelet, but the patient is on aspirin, indicating possible heart condition.
- **Carveolol (D):** Not listed, so irrelevant.

Considering the patient's condition, Alteplase (C) is the most appropriate next step as it directly addresses muscle tension caused by diaphoretism. It is a safe and effective treatment for this scenario.

**Answer:** C
