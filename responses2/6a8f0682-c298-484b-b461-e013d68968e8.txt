Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a resistor and energy dissipation. Hmm, let me think. The question says there's a linear time-invariant resistor of 4 ohms, and the current through it is given by i(t) = sin(π t). The initial condition is E(0) = 0. I need to find the energy dissipated at t=1,2,3,4,5,6 seconds. The options are A to J, each giving different energy values at those times.

Wait, right. Ohm's law says V = i * R. So the voltage across the resistor is the current times resistance. Since the resistor is 4 ohms, V(t) = 4i(t) = 4 sin(π t).

Energy dissipated in a resistor over time is the integral of power over time. Power P is V^2 / R, right? So P(t) = (4 sin π t)^2 / 4 = (16 sin² π t) /4 = 4 sin² π t. Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, V = i * R, so V = 4 sin π t. So power P = V^2 / R = (4 sin π t)^2 /4 = (16 sin² π t) /4 = 4 sin² π t. So yes, P(t) = 4 sin²(π t).

But wait, wait. Another thought: since the current is given, maybe it's easier to find the energy using the formula E = integral from 0 to t of P dt. Or perhaps there's a simpler way. Oh, wait! Because the current is given, and the resistor is linear and time-invariant, maybe the energy can be found using the formula E(t) = (1/2) * R * integral of i(t)^2 dt from 0 to t.

Wait, that's a useful formula. Because for a resistor, the energy is (1/2) R ∫ i² dt from 0 to t. So that might be easier.

So E(t) = (1/2)*R * ∫₀^t [i(t)]² dt.

Given i(t) = sin(π t). So i² is sin²(π t).

So, the problem becomes calculating the integral of sin²(π t) over time, then multiplying by (1/2)*R.

Since R is 4 ohms, E(t) = (1/2)*4 * ∫₀^t sin²(π t) dt = 2 ∫₀^t sin²(π t) dt.

Now, I need to compute this integral. The integral of sin²(a t) dt is a standard integral. The formula is ∫ sin²(a t) dt = (t/2) - (1/(4a)) sin(2 a t) + C.

So in this case, a is π, so the integral becomes (t/2) - (1/(4π)) sin(2 π t) + C.

So substituting back into E(t), we get E(t) = 2 [ (t/2) - (1/(4π)) sin(2π t) ] evaluated from 0 to t.

Let me compute that:

E(t) = 2 [ (t/2) - (1/(4π)) sin(2π t) ) - (0 - 0) ) ] = 2*(t/2) - 2*(1/(4π)) sin(2π t) = t - (1/2π) sin(2π t) .

So, E(t) = t - (1/(2π)) sin(2π t).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Let me compute the integral again. So, the integral of sin²(π t) dt from 0 to T is [t/2 - (1/(4π)) sin(2π t)] evaluated from 0 to T.

So, E(T) = 2 * ( [ T/2 - (1/(4π)) sin(2π T) ] - [ 0 - 0 ] ) = 2*(T/2 - (1/(4π)) sin(2π T)) ) = T - (1/π) sin(2π T).

Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because when I multiplied by 2, it's 2 * [ T/2 ... ] which is T. And 2 * [ - (1/(4π)) sin(...) ] is - (1/(2π)) sin(...). Hmm, so E(t) is t - (1/(2π)) sin(2π t).

Wait no, wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 2 * [ (t/2) - (1/(4π)) sin(2π t) ] equals t - (1/(2π)) sin(2π t). So yes, E(t) is t - (1/(2π)) sin(2π t).

But wait, this can't be right because when I plug t=0, E(0) should be 0. Let's check E(0):

E(0) = 0 - (1/(2π)) sin(0) → 0 - 0 = 0, which matches the initial condition. Good.

Now, let's compute E(t) for each t from 1 to 6.

Let me compute each E(t):

E(t) = t - (1/(2π)) sin(2π t).

Wait, for t=1:

E(1) = 1 - (1/(2π)) sin(2π * 1) = 1 - (1/(2π)) * sin(2π) → sin(2π) is 0, so E(1) = 1 - 0 = 1 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F gives E(1)=5 J, option C E(1)=1 J, which matches.

Wait the options provided in the question are options A to J, each with different values. For t=1, according to my calculation, E(1) should be 1 J. Let me check the options:

Option C: E(1)=1 J.

Option B: E(1)=1.5J.

Option F: E(1)=5J.

So according to my calculation, option C is correct for t=1.

Let me calculate for t=2.

E(2) = 2 - (1/(2π)) sin(4π) → sin(4π) is 0, so E(2)=2 J.

Looking at the options, option C says E(2)=1 J (no, wait, option C says 1 J for t=1, E(2)=2 J. Let me check the options again.

Wait, for option C, the E values are 1,2,3,4,5,6 J for t=1-6.

So E(2) would be 2 J, which matches option C.

Similarly, t=3:

E(3) =3 - (1/(2π)) sin(6π) → 0. So E(3)=3 J.

In option C, E(3)=3 J, which is correct.

Wait, but what about t=4:

E(4)=4 - (1/(2π)) sin(8π) =4 → E(4)=4 J.

Which matches option C's E(4)=4 J.

t=5: 5 - (1/(2π)) sin(10π) → 5 J.

t=6:6.

So according to this calculation, the correct answer is option C.

But wait, wait a minute. I'm a bit confused because the initial formula I used is E(t) = 2 ∫₀^t sin²(π t) dt.

Wait, let me re-calculate the integral. Maybe I made a mistake in the integral.

The integral of sin²(a x) dx is (x/2) - (1/(4a)) sin(2 a x) + C.

So in our case, a is π, and the variable is t.

So the integral from 0 to T is [ T/2 - (1/(4π)) sin(2π T) ].

So E(t) = 2 * [ (T/2) - (1/(4π)) sin(2π T) ].

Which simplifies to T - (1/(2π)) sin(2π T).

Wait, yes. So that's correct.

So for any integer T, sin(2π T) is zero, so E(T) = T.

So for t=1 → E(1)=1 J.

t=2 → 2 J.

t=3 →3 J.

t=4 →4 J.

t=5 →5 J.

t=6 →6 J.

So the energy at each t is simply t.

So the options that match are option C, which gives E(t)=t for t=1,2,3,4,5,6.

Looking back at the options, option C says:

E(1)=1, E(2)=2, E(3)=3, E(4)=4, E(5)=5, E(6)=6.

So that's correct.

But wait, the options also have option F, which is E(1)=5, E(2)=10, etc. No, that doesn't fit because according to our calculation, E(t)=t.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Looking back at the provided options, option C is E(t)=1,2,3,4,5,6 J.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of energy dissipation in a resistor, where the energy \( E(t) \) dissipated over time is given by:

\[
E(t) = \int_0^t P(t') \, dt'
\]

For a resistor, the power \( P(t) \) is related to the current \( i(t) \) by \( P(t) = \frac{V(t)^2}{R} \), where \( V(t) = R \cdot i(t) \). Here, \( i(t) = \sin(\pi t) \) and \( R = 4 \, \Omega \), so:

\[
P(t) = \frac{(4 \sin(\pi t))^2}{4} = 4 \sin^2(\pi t).
\]

The energy dissipated over time is:

\[
E(t) = \int_0^t 4 \sin^2(\pi t') \, dt'.
\]

Using the identity \( \sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2} \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int \sin^2(\pi t') \, dt' = \frac{t}{2} - \frac{1}{4\pi} \sin(2\pi t').
\]

Thus:

\[
E(t) = 4 \left[ \frac{t}{2} - \frac{1}{4\pi} \sin(2\pi t') \right]_0^t = 2t - \frac{1}{\pi} \sin(2\pi t).
\]

At \( t = 0 \), \( E(0) = 0 \), which matches the initial condition. For integer values of \( t \), \( \sin(2\pi t) = 0 \), so:

\[
E(t) = t.
\]

Now, evaluate \( E(t) \) for \( t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \):

- \( E(1) = 1 \, \text{J} \),
- \( E(2) = 2 \, \text{J} \),
- \( E(3) = 3 \, \text{J} \),
- \( E(4) = 4 \, \text{J} \),
- \( E(5) = 5 \, \text{J} \),
- \( E(6) = 6 \, \text{J} \).

This matches option **C**, where \( E(1) = 1 \, \text{J}, E(2) = 2 \, \text{J}, \dots, E(6) = 6 \, \text{J} \).
