Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: -6x equals -36. Hmm, let me think. I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it. So I should get rid of the -6 that's multiplied by x. 

Wait, how do I do that? Oh right, I can divide both sides of the equation by -6. That should cancel out the -6 on the left side. Let me write that down. 

So, if I divide both sides by -6, I get x equals (-36) divided by (-6). Oh, wait, dividing a negative by a negative gives a positive. So, 36 divided by 6 is 6. But wait, both are negative, so the negatives cancel, giving me a positive 6. 

Wait, let me make sure. Let's plug it back into the original equation to check. If x is 6, then -6 times 6 is -36, which matches the right side. Yep, that's correct. 

So the answer is 6. Looking at the options, that's option J. I think that's right.

The solution to the equation is x = 6, which corresponds to option J.

Answer:
J: 6
