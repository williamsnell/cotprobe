Okay, so I have this question about how to handle acquisition costs for a company. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slowly.

The question says: Bale Co. incurred $100,000 of acquisition costs related to the purchase of the net assets of Dixon Co. I need to determine how this $100,000 should be treated. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that when a company buys another company's net assets, there's typically a specific accounting treatment. I think it's about whether the asset is considered an intangible asset or something else.

I recall that if you buy another company's net assets, like a business or another company's entire assets, it's usually capitalized as an intangible asset. Wait, but sometimes if you buy a physical asset, it's a tangible one. Hmm, but net assets would include intangible like goodwill, or non-physical tangible assets.

Wait, the question doesn't specify whether the purchase was for tangible or intangible assets. But in most cases, when you buy another company's net assets, you capitalize the entire purchase price. So, the $100,000 would be treated as part of the cost of investment or cost of acquiring. Option C says "Capitalized as part of the cost of investment and tested annually for impairment." That sounds right.

But wait, another angle: if the purchase was for tangible assets, like land or buildings, then the entire cost is depreciated. But if it's for intangible assets, it's capitalized and amortized. So the question is about how the $100,000 is treated.

Wait, the question doesn't state whether the net assets were intangible or tangible. But in the context of the purchase, if the net assets include intangible assets like goodwill, then it's capitalized. Alternatively, if they are tangible, it would be amortized.

But the options don't give details on that. The question is asking which of the options is correct. So, the options don't specify whether it's intangible or tangible. So the correct treatment is to capitalize it as part of the cost of investment. Because typically, when you acquire net assets, you capitalize the entire amount unless there's a specific reason not to.

Looking at the options:

A: Treated as separate asset, depreciate. That's for intangible or separate tangible assets, not for purchasing entire net assets.

B: Capitalize as part of goodwill and test for impairment. Hmm. If the purchase is for goodwill, then it's capitalized as goodwill and tested for impairment. But the question doesn't specify that, so maybe not.

C: Capitalize as cost of investment and test for impairment. That sounds right because purchasing net assets usually involves capitalizing the entire amount.

D: Expensed as incurred. That's if it's a common stock or similar, but not for net assets.

E: Allocated pro rata. But if the purchase is for all of Dixon's assets, you can't just allocate them. Unless it's for a specific portion, but I don't think so.

F: Capitalized as inventory. That's for goods, not for assets.

G: Capitalized as other asset and amortized. That's for intangibles, but the purchase of net assets might include intangibles like goodwill.

H: Expensed over five years. That's if it's an asset to be amortized, but if it's a purchase of net assets, it should be capitalized unless there's a reason not to.

I: Expensed current period. That's for expensed items like services or salaries paid in the current period, but not for assets.

J: Allocated to non-monetary assets. That's for intangible assets, but if the assets are non-monetary, like a building, but the question is about net assets.

So, the correct answer is C: Capitalized as part of the cost of investment and tested for impairment.

The correct answer is C: Capitalized as part of the cost of investment and tested annually for impairment.
