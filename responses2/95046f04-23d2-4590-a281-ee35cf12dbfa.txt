Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the first names of early American explorers Lewis and Clark. Hmm, I remember that Lewis and Clark are famous explorers, but I'm a bit fuzzy on their exact first names. Let me think. I think they were from Kentucky, right? So they were probably from there. 

Wait, what's the origin of Lewis and Clark's first names? I recall that Lewis was the older one. Was it a Latin name or something else? Oh wait, Lewis is a name I've heard before, maybe from the Lewis and Clark series. Now, for the other name, Clark. Clark could be a term from the same series or maybe another name. 

I think the options are the ones listed. Looking at the options: A is Martin and Walter. Martin sounds familiar, but I'm not sure if that's right. B is Matthew and Charles. Matthew is another name I've heard, but I think Clark was Charles. C is Mitchell and Warren. That doesn't ring a bell. D is Michael and Christopher. Michael comes to mind, but I'm not sure about that. E is Meredith and George. George is a name I've heard as part of explorers, but I'm not certain. F is Marcus and Wilson. Marcus and Wilson don't seem right. G is Cabot and Joseph. Cabot? I think that might be correct because I remember Cabot as one of the explorers. Joseph? That's a name I've heard, but I'm not sure if it was Clark's. 

Wait, another approach: I think Lewis and Clark were two of the most famous explorers, and their first names are Martin and Charles, or maybe Matthew and Charles. I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing up other explorers like Thomas Jefferson, who was the father. So maybe their first names are Martin and Charles. Looking at the options, B is Matthew and Charles, which would be incorrect. A is Martin and Walter, which doesn't seem right. D is Michael and Christopher. I'm not sure about Michael. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe Lewis and Clark's full names were Lewis and Clark? Like, Lewis Clark? That doesn't help. Alternatively, I might be confusing the names. Let me think again. I think the correct first names are Martin and Charles. But wait, looking at the options, option B is Matthew and Charles, which I don't think is correct. I think it's either option D: Michael and Christopher or H: Meriwether and William. 

Wait, another angle: I remember Lewis and Clark's parents were Cabot and Joseph. Wait, but the question is about the first names. So, if their parents were Cabot and Joseph, then the children's first names wouldn't be Cabot or Joseph. So that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to their parents' names, but that doesn't seem right. 

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the explorers. Let me think: Lewis and Clark, the two explorers. Their first names are Martin and Charles. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again. 

Looking at the options, option B is Matthew and Charles. Maybe that's a mix-up. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: Michael and Christopher. Because I've heard that Lewis and Clark were characterized by their bravery, and their first names are often attributed to those traits. Alternatively, I might be wrong. 

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. I think the correct answer is B: Matthew and Charles because I've heard those names before in the context of Lewis and Clark. Or another thought: I'm pretty sure the first names were Martin and Clark. Wait, no, that doesn't match the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about other explorers. For example, Thomas Jefferson was the father, but that's not relevant here. Lewis and Clark were the sons. Maybe their first names were Martin and Clark. But Martin and Clark isn't one of the options. 

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is Matthew and Charles. I'm not sure if that's the right pair. Alternatively, could the answer be D: Michael and Christopher? Because another source I remember says that Lewis and Clark were known for their bravery, and their first names were Martin and Clark, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Mitchell and Warren, but I don't recall that. Alternatively, maybe H: Meriwether and William. I'm not sure about their names. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: Matthew and Charles. I'm not certain, but I think that's a possibility. Alternatively, another approach: I think Lewis and Clark were known for their emperors, so maybe their first names are Martin and Clark. But that's not an option. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: Michael and Christopher. Because I've heard that Lewis and Clark were first-class military leaders. So their first names being those makes sense. So perhaps D is the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the answer could be B: Matthew and Charles, but I'm not certain. 

I'm a bit stuck. Let's look for another approach. The options given are A: Martin and Walter, B: Matthew and Charles, C: Mitchell and Warren, D: Michael and Christopher, E: Meredith and George, F: Marcus and Wilson, G: Cabot and Joseph, H: Meriwether and William, I: Morgan and Mason, J: Miles and Wesley.

I think the most accurate answer is B: Matthew and Charles. Because I remember that Lewis and Clark were known for their bravery and their first names were Matthew and Charles. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, looking up (but I can't actually do that), I think the correct answer is B. But I'm not 100% confident. Another thought: I'm pretty sure the correct answer is B: Matthew and Charles. So I'll go with that.
