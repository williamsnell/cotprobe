Alright, so I've got this problem here about direct proportionality. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that x and y are directly proportional, and when x is 3, y is 8. I need to find x when y is 13.

Hmm, okay. Direct proportionality means that as one variable increases, the other increases in a constant ratio. So the formula for that should be x = k * y, where k is the constant of proportionality. Wait, or is it y = k * x? No, wait. Oh right, the general formula is y = kx, because y is directly proportional to x. So that means y increases as x increases, and the ratio y/x remains constant.

So when x is 3, y is 8. Let me find the constant k. If y = k * x, then 8 = k * 3. So k would be 8/3. That makes sense because 8 divided by 3 is approximately 2.6667.

Now, the question asks for x when y is 13. So using the same formula, y = k * x, plug in y = 13: 13 = (8/3)*x. To solve for x, I can multiply both sides by 3/8. That gives x = (13 * 3)/8. Let's calculate that: 13 multiplied by 3 is 39, divided by 8. So 39 divided by 8 is 4.875. Wait, let me confirm that division: 8 goes into 39 four times (4*8=32), with a remainder of 7, then 70 divided by 8 is 8.75, wait no, wait, 39 divided by 8 is 4.875 because 4*8=32, 39-32=7, so 7/8 is 0.875. So yes, 4.875.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.875. So the answer should be G.

The relationship between x and y is directly proportional, meaning y = kx. Given x = 3 and y = 8, we find k = 8/3. When y = 13, x = (13 * 3)/8 = 4.875. The correct option is G.

Answer: G: 4.875
