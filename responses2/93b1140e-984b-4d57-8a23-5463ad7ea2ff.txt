Okay, so I've got this group theory question here. The question is asking about the order of the group S_3 multiplied by Z_2. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that S_n represents the symmetric group on n elements. So S_3 is the group of all permutations of three elements. The order of a group is the number of its elements. I think S_3 has 3! = 6 elements. Yeah, because there are 3! ways to arrange three things.

Next, Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2. That's the integers modulo 2 under addition, so it has elements {0, 1}.

Now, when we take the direct product of two groups, S_3 and Z_2, I believe the order of the resulting group is the product of their individual orders. So the order of S_3 is 6, and the order of Z_2 is 2. Multiplying them together, 6*2=12. So the order of S_3 * Z_2 should be 12.

Wait, but sometimes when you take a direct product, the order can be tricky. Like, if the two groups have overlapping elements, maybe some elements would be duplicates? No, wait, the direct product combines the elements. Each element of S_3 is combined with each element of Z_2. So it's just the product of the sizes, right? So 6 * 2 is definitely 12.

Looking at the options, option H is 12. So the answer should be H.

The order of S_3 is 6 and the order of Z_2 is 2. The order of their direct product is the product of these, so 6 * 2 = 12. 

Answer: H
