Okay, so I've got this question here about Elkind's (1967) work on beliefs and personal fables. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says: Alice, age 14, is certain that everyone is looking at her because she has a large blemish in the middle of her forehead. According to Elkind, her belief is a manifestation of what?

The options are A to J, each a different concept. I need to figure out which one Elkind's theory suggests.

First, I remember that Elkind's theory, which is a work on social and emotional beliefs, probably relates to how people form their personal fables. Personal fables are stories or beliefs that are shared and recognized by others, often used to understand one's own beliefs.

Elkind's theory, I think, is about the "Personal Fable" concept, which is about how we perceive others' beliefs based on our own experiences. So her belief that everyone is looking at her is probably a manifestation of this personal fable.

Looking at the options again: Option A is the "personal fable." That seems to fit. The other options: theory of mind is about having beliefs about others, but that's more about internal beliefs. The "egocentrism" is about putting oneself in others' shoes, which seems more negative. Self-concept is about how people see themselves, but it's more about self-perception rather than external beliefs. Social referencing is about using one's own experiences to understand others. The "imaginary audience" and "moral development" don't seem right because the question is about her belief, not her development. Social comparison is when she compares herself to others, but the question says she's certain everyone is looking at her, which is about external observation, not self comparison.

So the answer should be A: the "personal fable."

The correct answer is A: the "personal fable." Alice's belief that everyone is looking at her is a manifestation of her personal fable, as described by Elkind.

Answer: A
