Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gravitational fields on Mars. Hmm, I remember that the gravitational field strength is related to the mass and the radius of a planet. Oh right, the formula for gravitational acceleration on the surface of a planet is g = G*M/(R²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, and R is the radius.

The question says Mars has a radius about half that of Earth. So if Earth's radius is R, Mars is R/2. And the mass of Mars is about one-tenth that of Earth. Earth's mass is M, so Mars's mass is M/10.

I think I need to plug these into the formula. Let me compute the gravitational field for Mars compared to Earth. So g_mars = (G*(M/10)) / ( (R/2)² ). Let's simplify that.

The denominator (R/2) squared is R²/4. So the equation becomes (G*M/10) divided by (R²/4). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so this becomes (G*M/10) * (4/R²) = (4/10) * (G*M/R²) = (2/5) g_earth.

Wait, because Earth's g is 9.8 m/s². So Mars's g would be (2/5)*9.8. Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. 0.4 times 9.8 is... 3.92. So approximately 4 N/kg, but wait, that can't be right because Earth's g is about 10, so Mars is less. Wait, wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, 10 divided by 2.5 (since 5/2 is 2.5) would be 4? Oh, that makes sense. Wait, but I thought Earth's g is about 10, so Mars's would be about 3.9, which is approximately 4 N/kg.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is 1 N/kg, option E is 12, option J is 0.2, option A is 0.5. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check. Let me compute 4/10 *9.8. 4/10 is 0.4, 0.4*9.8 is 3.92, which is about 4 N/kg. But wait, the options given don't have 4. The options are A: 0.5, B:1, C:2, D:4, E:12, etc.

Wait, no, D is 4 N/kg. So that would be the closest. But I thought earlier that the radius is half and mass is one-tenth. So radius is half, so  (R/2)^2 is R²/4. So the denominator is R²/4, so when we compute M/(R²/4) = 4 M/(R²). So the overall factor is (M/10) *4/(R²) = 4 M/(10 R²) = (4/10) * (M/R²) → (2/5)*g_earth.

So 2/5 of Earth's g. Earth is about 10 N/kg, so 2/5 is 4 N/kg. So the answer should be D:4 N/kg. But looking at the options, option D is 4. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me think about the exact numbers again. Because sometimes I get confused with the factors. Let me try another approach. Earth's g is 9.8 m/s². Mars's g is (g_earth) * (M_mars/M_earth) * (R_earth/R_mars)^2.

Wait, because g = G M/(R²), so the ratio is (M/M_earth) * (R_earth/R_mars)^2. Oh, that's important. Because R_mars is half R_earth, so R_earth/R_mars is 2. So the ratio becomes (1/10) * (2)^2. Because M_mars is (1/10) M_earth. So (1/10) *4 → 4/10 = 0.4. So 0.4 times 9.8 is 3.92, which is approximately 4. So again, 4 N/kg. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the gravitational field at the surface of Mars, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration:

\[
g = \frac{G M}{R^2}
\]

where \( M \) is the mass and \( R \) is the radius. For Mars, the mass is about \( \frac{1}{10} \) of Earth's mass (\( M_{\text{Mars}} = \frac{1}{10} M_{\text{Earth}} \)) and the radius is about half that of Earth's (\( R_{\text{Mars}} = \frac{1}{2} R_{\text{Earth}} \)).

The gravitational field on Mars compared to Earth is given by:

\[
g_{\text{Mars}} = g_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \frac{M_{\text{Mars}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} \cdot \left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Mars}}}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
g_{\text{Mars}} = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot \left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{\frac{1}{2} R_{\text{Earth}}}\right)^2 = 9.8 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 4 = 3.92 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

This is approximately \( 4 \, \text{N/kg} \), as \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 1 \, \text{N/kg} \).

From the options provided, the closest value is:

**D: 4 N/kg**
