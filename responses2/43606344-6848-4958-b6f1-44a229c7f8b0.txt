Okay, so I have this problem to compute the binomial coefficient C(85,82). Hmm, I remember that binomial coefficients are calculated using the formula C(n,k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!), right? But wait, calculating factorials for such large numbers seems really complicated. I mean, 85 factorial is a massive number, and dividing by 82 factorial... that would be even worse. 

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way to simplify this. Oh right! I remember that C(n, k) is equal to C(n, n - k) because choosing k elements from n is the same as choosing the remaining n - k elements. So in this case, 82 is way bigger than 85? Wait no, 82 is less than 85, so n - k would be 85 -82 =3. So C(85,82) is the same as C(85,3). That's much easier to compute.

Okay, so now I need to compute C(85,3) because that's simpler. Let's see, the formula for C(n,3) is n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6. So plugging in 85:

85 * 84 * 83 / 6. 

Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 85 by 84. 85 * 84 is... let's see, 80*84 is 6720, 5*84 is 420, so total is 6720 + 420 = 7140. Then multiply that by 83. Hmm, 7140 * 80 is 571,200 and 7140 *3 is 21,420. So total is 571,200 +21,420 = 592,620. 

Now divide that by 6. 592,620 / 6. Let's see, 600,000 divided by 6 is 100,000. So 592,620 is 592,620 - 73,800 = 518,820, but wait that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, 592,620 divided by 6: 6 goes into 59 nine times (54), remainder 5. 6 into 52 is 8, remainder 4. 6 into 46 is 7, remainder 4. 6 into 42 is 7, and 6 into 0 is 0. So 98,770? Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, 6 * 98,770 = 592,620. Because 6*90,000=540,000. 6*8,000=48,000. 6*770=4620. Adding them: 540,000+48,000=588,000 +4620=592,620. Yes, that's correct. So 592,620 divided by 6 is 98,770. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option G is 98,770. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might make a calculation error. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake in the multiplication step earlier. Let's go back.

Wait, 85 * 84 is 7140. Then 7140 * 83.

Hmm, maybe another approach: 7140 * 80 = 571,200, and 7140 *3 =21,420. Adding together, 571,200 +21,420 = 592,620. That's correct. Then 592,620 divided by 6 is 98,770. So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be G, 98,770.

The binomial coefficient C(85,82) can be simplified using the property C(n,k) = C(n, n - k). Thus, C(85,82) = C(85,3). The formula for C(n,3) is n(n-1)(n-2)/6. Plugging in n = 85:

85 * 84 * 83 / 6 = (592,620) / 6 = 98,770.

The correct answer is G: 98,770.
