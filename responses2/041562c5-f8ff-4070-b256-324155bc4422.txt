The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order

Options:

A: valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.
B: valid, because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergency relief efforts.
C: invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.
D: invalid, because the executive order did not specify the scope of the relief operations.
E: invalid, because the executive order infringes upon the rights of federal employees.
F: invalid, because the INS does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries.
G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.
H: valid, because the president's executive power extends to directing federal agencies in times of crisis.
I: valid, because the President has the power to issue executive orders in times of emergency.
J: invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the validity of an executive order from the President directed by the President, and whether the federal agency member's decision to refuse compliance stands up. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A foreign earthquake hit a country, leading to destruction and injury. The President wanted to send troops but was stopped because they were on training. So the President gave an executive order to a federal agency under the Ins to assist in relief. The agency's main job is to patrol borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the US.

A member of this agency refused the order and participated anyway. They sued the President's order, which the court is supposed to decide.

The question is whether the executive order is valid, given that the employee refused compliance.

Now, the options are A to J, each making a different argument. I need to evaluate each option to see which one is the strongest.

Option A: "valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort." Hmm. I remember that in the U.S., federal employees have a certain authority, but I think that when the President is acting under executive order, especially when it's for an emergency, he can possibly overstep. But I'm not sure about that. Also, does the President have the authority to require federal employees to assist in an emergency? I think the President has authority, but perhaps this is overruled by the Ins's role.

Option B: "valid, because the President can repuse federal agencies for emergency relief." This seems a bit vague. I don't recall the Constitution explicitly allowing the President to repurpose federal agencies for such purposes. The primary role of the federal government is to protect the people, not to repurpose agencies for emergencies. So this might be incorrect.

Option C: "invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization." Oh, this sounds familiar. The Constitution gives Congress the power to make laws, and the executive branch's authority is limited to the President and the President's actions. So if the President is giving an executive order, the federal agencies are supposed to follow that. But wait, the Ins is the federal agency, so if the President orders them to go to the foreign country, perhaps the Ins has the authority to enforce that.

Actually, the Ins is part of the federal system, so they can issue directives. But the key point is whether the President's order is within the President's authority. I think the INS does not have the executive power, so the President's order is an executive order and the Ins's role is to supervise. But in this case, the member of the agency refused, but the Ins's power to issue a directive would mean they can require the employee to comply.

Wait, but the question is about whether the executive order is valid. So the member's refusal would be a question of standing. But the options are about the validity of the executive order, not whether the member is justified in refusing.

Wait, but the question states that the member has adequate standing, so the order is valid if the executive order is constitutional. So perhaps the Ins's role is to issue directives, so the order is valid because the President's order can be directed to the Ins for compliance.

Wait, but maybe the INS has jurisdiction over the foreign country. So if the member's refusal is about foreign country laws, but the order is to assist in relief, which is a domestic matter. So perhaps the INS's authority isn't relevant here. Hmm, or perhaps the INS is the entity that handles border control and can enforce the law in the foreign country. So when the President directs federal agencies to assist in relief, the Ins has the authority to enforce that.

Wait, but the question is about the validity of the executive order itself. So the executive order is directed by the President to "expand" federal agencies' functions to assist in relief. The INS is part of the federal system, so their authority is in the federal system.

So, the president's directive is an executive order, and the INS is part of the executive branch. So when the individual member of the agency refuses, as long as the INS can issue a directive to the employee, the order is valid.

Option C says the order is invalid because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power without congressional authorization. But the INS is part of the federal system, so they can issue directives. So option C is incorrect.

Option E: "invalid, because the executive order infringes upon the rights of federal employees." That's another way of saying the order is invalid. But I'm not sure if that's the best argument. The main issue is whether the executive order is within the President's authority. The INS's role is to enforce the law, so the order is valid because the INS can issue directives.

Wait, but the question is about the order's validity. So the key issue is whether the President's order is within his power. The INS is part of the federal government, so their role is to handle such matters. So as long as the INS can issue a directive to the employee, the order is valid.

Option G: "valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions." So this is about standing. If the employee's refusal is a due process right, then he has standing. However, the question says the member has adequate standing, so the court should rule the order valid. But does the order's validity depend on the employee's standing? Or is the order's validity determined by whether it's within the President's authority?

Wait, the options are about whether the order is valid, not about the employee's jurisdiction. So the options are about the validity of the order itself, not about whether the employee was justified in refusing.

So if the order is within the President's authority, then the order is valid. So the INS is part of the federal system, so their role is to issue directives. Therefore, the order is valid because the INS can issue the directive, so option G is about standing, which is given.

Wait, but the President's order is directed to the federal agency. The INS is the federal agency, so their authority is within the President's. So the order is valid because the INS can issue directives.

So looking back at the options, the correct one would be the one that states the order is valid because the executive agency (the federal agency) can be directed by the President to assist in relief.

Wait, but the options don't directly state that. Option G says the executive agency's employees can be required to perform such functions. That could be a reason if the order is within the President's authority.

Wait, but the Ins's role is more about enforcing the law, not about directly fulfilling requests. So the order's validity as a directive is determined by the INS's authority, which is part of federal power.

Alternatively, the order is within the President's scope because the federal agency is a federal employee under the President's supervision. So the president can direct them to assist in relief.

So the reason the order is valid is that the federal agency can be directed by the President. So the correct answer would be option G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is whether the executive order is valid. The options are about the validity of the order, not about the employee's standing.

So the main issue here is whether the President's order is within his authority. The INS is part of the federal system, so their authority is within the President's. So if the INS can issue a directive, the order is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is either G or E. The key is whether the order is within the President's authority. Since the federal agency is part of the executive branch, the order is valid because the INS can issue directives.

So the correct answer is G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the INS is part of the federal government, so they can issue directives. Therefore, the President's order is valid because the federal agency, which includes the INS, can issue directives. So the order is valid because the INS is part of the federal system and can issue directives.

Alternatively, option E: invalid because the order infringes on the rights of federal employees. But I think the issue is about whether the order is within the President's authority, not about the employees' rights.

Option G seems to state that the order is valid because the Executive agency's employees can be required to perform such functions. That would be correct if the order is within the President's power. So the correct answer should be G.

So the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around the validity of an executive order issued by the President directed to a federal agency, which is part of the United States' federal system. The agency's main function is to patrol borders, but the President has instructed them to assist in relief efforts in a foreign country. The key issue is whether this executive order is valid and, if so, why.

**Option A** suggests the President's authority extends to requiring federal employees to assist in international relief. While the President has authority, this option does not address the role of the federal agency's INS, which is the primary authority for issuing directives.

**Option B** claims the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergencies. This is incorrect because the President's authority is limited to specific uses as directed by him, and federal agencies have their own roles beyond that.

**Option C** argues the order is invalid because it's beyond the President's authority without congressional consent. However, the INS is part of the federal system, so it has the authority to issue directives, making this option incorrect.

**Option D** states the order is invalid because it doesn't specify the scope. However, the question focuses on the validity of the order itself, not its scope, so this option is irrelevant.

**Option E** claims the order infringes on federal employees' rights. While the order's validity is determined by its legality, this option conflates the issue of rights with the issue of legality.

**Option F** mentions the INS not having jurisdiction in foreign countries, which is incorrect since the INS is part of the federal system and has the authority to handle such matters.

**Option G** asserts the order is valid because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such functions. This is correct because the federal agency, including the INS, has the authority to issue directives. The President's order is within his scope of authority as directed by him.

**Option H** and **I** suggest the President has the power to issue orders in emergencies, which is true but not directly relevant to the validity of the order itself.

**Option J** claims the director of the INS has the power, which is incorrect since the INS is part of the federal system.

The correct answer is **G**, as it accurately reflects the federal agency's role in issuing directives as part of the President's authority.

**ANSWER: G**
