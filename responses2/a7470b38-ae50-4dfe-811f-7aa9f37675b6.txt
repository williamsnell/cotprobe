Okay, so I've got this problem here about estimating the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly. The question is asking how many students should be sampled to get a 90% confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when calculating sample sizes for proportions, there's a formula involved. Oh right, it's something like n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2. But wait, I think p is the estimated proportion of success, but in this case, since we don't have an estimate for p, we might have to use the most conservative estimate, which is p = 0.5. Because that maximizes the variance, so the sample size would be the largest possible, ensuring it works for any p.

So, let me jot down the variables. The confidence level is 90%, which means alpha is 0.10. For a two-tailed test, alpha over two is 0.05. The Z-score for 0.05 in the tails is approximately 1.645. Right, because Z 0.05 is about 1.645.

The margin of error (E) is given as 0.08. Wait, the width is 0.08, so the margin of error is half of that, which is 0.04. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the width is the total range, so the margin of error is half of that, so 0.08/2 = 0.04. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the width of the confidence interval is 0.08, so the margin of error is half of that, which would be 0.04. Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. No, the confidence interval is a range around the estimate. The width is the maximum range, which is twice the margin of error. So if the width is 0.08, then the margin of error is E = 0.04. Because 0.08 = 2*E, so E = 0.04.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The confidence interval width is the upper bound minus the lower bound. So if the interval is from p - E to p + E, then the total width is 2E. So for a width of 0.08, 2E = 0.08, so E is 0.04. So that's correct.

So plugging into the formula: n = (Z^2 * p*(1-p)) / E^2.

Since p is unknown, we set p = 0.5 to maximize the variance. So p*(1-p) is 0.25.

Z is 1.645, E is 0.04.

So n = (1.645)^2 * 0.25 / (0.04)^2.

Calculating numerator: 1.645 squared is about 2.706. Multiply by 0.25 gives 0.6765.

Denominator: 0.04 squared is 0.0016.

So n = 0.6765 / 0.0016 â‰ˆ 422.8125.

So since you can't sample a fraction of a person, you round up to 423. Wait, but wait the options include 423 as option C. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.645 squared is 2.706 approximately. Yes. So 2.706 * 0.25 is 0.6765.

Denominator is 0.04 squared, which is 0.0016.

Dividing 0.6765 by 0.0016: Let's compute that. 0.6765 / 0.0016. Let's see, 0.0016 goes into 0.6765 how many times? 0.0016 * 400 = 0.64, which leaves 0.0365. 0.0016 *22.8125 is about 0.0365, so 400 +22.8125 = 422.8125. So yes, 422.8125, which is about 423.

So the required sample size is 423. Looking at the options, that's option C. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the required sample size, we use the formula for a confidence interval for a proportion:

\[
n = \frac{Z^2 \cdot p(1-p)}{E^2}
\]

Where:
- \( Z = 1.645 \) (Z-score for 90% confidence),
- \( p = 0.5 \) (to maximize variance),
- \( E = 0.04 \) (half the width of the confidence interval).

Plugging in the values:

\[
n = \frac{(1.645)^2 \cdot 0.25}{(0.04)^2} = \frac{2.706 \cdot 0.25}{0.0016} = \frac{0.6765}{0.0016} \approx 422.81
\]

Rounding up, we get **423**. Thus, the correct answer is **C: 423**.

C
