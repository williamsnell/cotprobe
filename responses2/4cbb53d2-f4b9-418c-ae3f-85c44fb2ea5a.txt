Okay, so I have this logic problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these truth tables.

The question is about constructing a truth table for the argument: (O ≡ P) ∨ P and P ∨ ~O. Then, based on that, determine if the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the right counterexample from the options given.

First, let's understand what these statements mean. The first statement is (O ≡ P) ∨ P. The ≡ symbol represents equivalence, meaning O and P are both true or both false. So, (O ≡ P) is true only when O and P have the same truth value. Then, we're OR-ing that with P. So, the entire first statement is: (O ≡ P) OR P.

The second statement is P OR ~O. So, this is just the classic OR; either P is true, or O is false, or both.

Now, to construct a truth table, I need to list all possible truth values for O and P. Since there are two variables, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations. Let me list them:

1. O=T, P=T
2. O=T, P=F
3. O=F, P=T
4. O=F, P=F

Now, I'll evaluate each statement for each combination.

Let's start with the first statement: (O ≡ P) ∨ P.

For each row:

1. O=T, P=T: O≡P is T. So, T∨T is T.
2. O=T, P=F: O≡P is F. So, F∨F is F.
Wait, wait, no. Wait, O=T, P=F. O≡P would be F because T and F are not equivalent. So, (F) ∨ P (which is F) is F.
Wait, no, wait. (O ≡ P) is F, so F ∨ F is F.

Wait, no, actually, that's correct. So the first statement is F in this case.

3. O=F, P=T: O≡P is F. So, F∨T is T.
4. O=F, P=F: O≡P is T. So, T∨F is T.

So the first statement's truth values are: T, F, T, T.

Now the second statement: P ∨ ~O.

Let me compute that for each row.

1. O=T, P=T: P is T, ~O is F. So T∨F is T.
2. O=T, P=F: P is F, ~O is F. So F∨F is F.
3. O=F, P=T: P is T, ~O is T. So T∨T is T.
4. O=F, P=F: P is F, ~O is T. So F∨T is T.

So the second statement's truth values are: T, F, T, T.

Now, the entire argument is the conjunction of these two statements. So the argument claims that both of these are true.

So for the entire argument to be true, both (O ≡ P)∨P and P∨~O must be true.

Let's see when that happens:

Looking at each row:

1. O=T, P=T: Both are true → argument is true.
2. O=T, P=F: First statement is F, so argument is F.
3. O=F, P=T: First statement is T, second is T → argument is T.
4. O=F, P=F: Both are T → argument is T.

Wait, that's all four rows. So the only time the argument is false is when O=T and P=F. Because in that case, the first statement is F, and the second is F (since O=T, so ~O=F, so P∨~O is F∨F=F). So the entire argument is (T) ∧ (F) → F.

So the argument is invalid because there's at least one case where it's false. That would be when O is T and P is F.

Now, the options are looking at counterexamples. The invalidity of the argument would be shown by a row where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Wait, no, actually, for an argument to be invalid, there must be a scenario where all the premises are true, but the conclusion (which is the conjunction of the premises) is false. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The argument is: (O ≡ P) ∨ P and P ∨ ~O. So the conclusion is the conjunction of these two statements. So the argument is ( (O ≡ P)∨P ) ∧ ( P ∨ ~O ). So, the argument is invalid if there's a row where both ( (O ≡ P)∨P ) and ( P ∨ ~O ) are true, but the conclusion is false. Wait, but the conclusion is the conjunction, so if the premises are both true, then the conclusion is true. So the argument is valid only if there are no such rows where both premises are true. If there's at least one row where both premises are true, then the argument is invalid.

Wait, so for the argument to be invalid, the premises (both statements) must be true at the same time, but the conclusion (which is both statements) is true in all cases? No, I'm getting tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to think is for the argument to be invalid, the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Wait, no, because the conclusion is the conjunction of the premises. So if both premises are true, then the conclusion is true. Therefore, the argument is valid only when there's no row where both premises are true. If such a row exists, the argument is invalid.

So, in our case, the only row where both premises are true is row 1: O=T, P=T. Because in that case, both statements evaluate to T. So the argument is invalid because in that row, the premises are both true (so the argument's premises are both true, but the conclusion is also true. Wait, but that would mean the argument is valid because whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is true. But wait, I thought earlier that in row 2 (O=T, P=F), both premises are false, but in row 3 and 4, both premises are true.

Wait, no, let me double-check:

In row 1: O=T, P=T.

First statement: (O≡P)∨P = T∨T = T.

Second statement: P∨~O = T∨F = T.

So both premises are true. So the argument is valid in that case because the premises are true, so the conclusion is also true.

Row 2: O=T, P=F.

First statement: (O≡P)∨P = F∨F = F.

Second statement: F∨F = F.

So both premises are false. So the conjunction is F, making the argument F.

Row3: O=F, P=T.

First statement: T∨T = T.

Second statement: T∨T = T.

So both premises are true. Argument is true.

Row4: O=F, P=F.

First statement: T∨F = T.

Second statement: F∨T = T.

Both premises are true. So argument is true.

Wait, so in row 1,3,4, the premises are true. So the argument is valid in those cases. The only case where the premises are both true is row1? No, wait, in row3 and 4, the premises are both true.

Wait, row3 is O=F, P=T.

So, in row3: both premises are T. So the argument is T.

Row4: O=F, P=F.

Both premises are T, so argument is T.

So in all rows where premises are true, the argument is T. So the argument is valid because whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the conclusion is the conjunction of both premises. So in any case where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true, making the argument valid.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was a row where both premises are true. So that would mean the argument is valid, because in all cases, if the premises are true, the conclusion is true.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the argument is invalid when O=T and P=F. But that's when both premises are false. So the argument is only invalid in that case.

So the argument is valid because there's no row where the premises are both true and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is valid. So the answer would be option I: Valid.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the argument is invalid. Let me make sure.

Wait, the argument is: ( (O≡P)∨P ) ∧ ( P ∨ ~O ). So the conclusion is the conjunction of the two statements.

The argument is valid if in every row where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. Which in this case, for all rows where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

So, looking back:

Row1: both premises true → conclusion T.

Row3: both premises true → conclusion T.

Row4: both premises true → conclusion T.

Row2: both premises false → conclusion F.

So, the only case where the premises are true is rows 1,3,4. In all those cases, the conclusion is true. So the argument is valid.

So the answer is I: Valid.

The argument is valid because in all rows where both premises are true, the conclusion (the conjunction of the premises) is also true.

**Answer: I: Valid**
