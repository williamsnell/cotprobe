Okay, so I have this problem here where a certain number, when divided by 4, gives a quotient of 160 and a remainder of 2. I need to find out what the number is by looking at the options provided. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when you divide a number by another, you get a quotient and a remainder. The formula for that is: Dividend = Divisor × Quotient + Remainder. So in this case, the Divisor is 4, the Quotient is 160, and the Remainder is 2. 

So plugging those numbers into the formula: Dividend = 4 × 160 + 2. Let me calculate that. 4 times 160 is... 4*100 is 400, and 4*60 is 240, so 400+240=640. Then add the remainder 2, so 640 + 2 = 642. So the dividend, which is the number we're looking for, should be 642.

Now I check the options. Looking at the choices, option G is 642. So that must be the correct answer.

The problem involves using the division formula: Dividend = Divisor × Quotient + Remainder. Plugging in the values, we get 4 × 160 + 2 = 642. Among the options, G is 642, which matches our calculation.

Answer: G
