Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about freezing points and molality. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the colligative properties of solutions. The question is about calculating the molecular weight of sulfur based on the freezing point depression. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the first thing I recall is that the freezing point depression is given by the formula ΔT = Kf * m, where Kf is the freezing point depression constant for the solvent, and m is the molality of the solute. Wait, wait, no, actually, the formula is ΔT = Kf * m, but I think more accurately, the formula is ΔT = i*Kf*m, where i is the van't Hoff factor. Oh wait, but for non-electrolytes, i is 1, so it's just Kf * m.

But wait, in this problem, they're dealing with two different solutes. Oh wait, no, wait. The problem gives two different solutes, but I'm supposed to find the molecular weight of sulfur. Wait, but wait. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: liquid naphthalene normally freezes at 80.2°C. When 1 mole of solute is dissolved in 1000 g of naphthalene, the freezing point is 73.2°C. So that means the solution's freezing point is lower, so it's more concentrated than the pure solvent. So the solute lowers the freezing point.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Naphthalene normally freezes at 80.2. When you add a solute, say, maybe a solute that lowers the freezing point. So in the first case, 1 mole of solute is added to 1000 g naphthalene. The freezing point goes down to 73.2°C, so ΔT is 80.2 - 73.2 = 7°C. So the freezing point is lowered by 7°C.

In the second case, 6.0 g of sulfur is added to 250 g naphthalene. The freezing point is 79.5°C. So the original freezing point is 80.2, so ΔT is 80.2 - 79.5 = 0.7°C.

Wait, that's a small ΔT. So the solute is either a weak electrolyte or not. But sulfur is a non-metal, so it's probably a non-electrolyte, so i=1.

So for both cases, the formula is ΔT = Kf * m, where m is the molality of the solute.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the first scenario. 1 mole of solute in 1000 g (which is 1 kg, since 1000g is 1 kg) of naphthalene. So molality m is moles of solute per kg of solvent. Since it's 1 mole, m = 1 / 1000 = 0.001 mol/kg.

Wait, but wait, the freezing point goes down by 7°C. So ΔT = 7 = Kf * m. So Kf = 7 / 0.001 = 7000 °C/molal.

Wait, but wait, the second case: 6.0 g sulfur in 250 g naphthalene. So 250 g is 0.25 kg. Moles of sulfur would be 6.0 g / M, where M is the molecular weight we're trying to find.

So m = (6.0 / M) / 0.25 = (6.0) / (M * 0.25) = 24 / M mol/kg.

Because for a 6.0g sample, the moles are 6.0/M, and divided by 0.25 kg gives 24/M mol/kg.

So now, the ΔT here is 0.7°C (since freezing point goes up, but wait no: the solution's freezing point is 79.5, which is higher than pure naphthalene's 80.2. So wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Naphthalene's freezing point is 80.2. When you add a solute, the freezing point goes down. But in the second case, the freezing point is 79.5, which is lower than 80.2. So the solution is more concentrated, so the freezing point is lower. So the ΔT is 80.2 - 79.5 = 0.7°C.

Wait, but that's a small ΔT. So the second case has a smaller ΔT than the first. So the molality of the second solution must be smaller than the first. Because ΔT is proportional to m (since Kf is same in both cases? Wait, wait, but Kf is a constant for a particular solvent. So for same solvent, Kf is same. Oh, but wait, in the problem, the solvent is naphthalene, and Kf is a constant for naphthalene. So yes, Kf is same in both cases.

So, in the first case, ΔT = 7 = Kf * m1.

In the second case, ΔT = 0.7 = Kf * m2.

Since Kf is same in both, m1 =7/Kf, m2=0.7/Kf.

So m1 =7/(Kf), m2=0.7/(Kf).

But wait, in the first case, m1 is 1 mole / 1 kg = 1 mol/kg. Because 1 mole in 1000g.

So m1=1 mol/kg.

So 1 =7/(Kf) → Kf =7/1 → Kf=7.

Wait, but wait, in the second case, m2 is (6.0 g S) / (M g/mol) / 0.25 kg → 6/(M *0.25) =24/M.

So m2=24/M.

But from the second case, ΔT=0.7=Kf * m2 → 0.7 =7 * (24/M).

Wait, because Kf is 7.

So 0.7 =7 * (24 / M).

Let me compute that.

24 *7 = 168.

So 0.7 = 168/(M).

So M = 168 /0.7 → 168 / 0.7 = 240.

So M is 240 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is 240 g/mol.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check because I might have messed up the ΔT.

Wait, the first case: solution's freezing point is 73.2, which is 80.2-73.2=7°C. So ΔT=7. So Kf =7 / m1.

m1 is (1 mole)/(1 kg) =1. So Kf=7.

Second case: ΔT=80.2−79.5=0.7°C. So Kf = 0.7/m2.

m2 is (6.0 g S)/(M g/mol) / 0.25 kg → (6/M)/(0.25) =24/M mol/kg.

So 0.7 =7*(24/M).

Which gives M=24*7/0.7= 168/0.7=240.

So the molecular weight is 240 g/mol. Looking at the options, that's option B.

The problem involves calculating the molecular weight of sulfur based on the freezing point depression of solutions. The freezing point depression formula is:

\[
\Delta T = K_f \cdot m
\]

where \( \Delta T \) is the freezing point depression, \( K_f \) is the freezing point depression constant for the solvent, and \( m \) is the molality of the solute.

### First Scenario:
- **Freezing point of pure naphthalene**: \( 80.2^\circ \text{C} \)
- **Freezing point of solution**: \( 73.2^\circ \text{C} \)
- **Freezing point depression**: \( \Delta T = 80.2 - 73.2 = 7.0^\circ \text{C} \)
- **Moles of solute (solute)**: 1 mole
- **Mass of solvent (naphthalene)**: 1000 g (1 kg)
- **Molality (\( m_1 \))**: 
  \[
  m_1 = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{mass of solvent in kg}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \, \text{mol/kg}
  \]
- Using \( \Delta T = K_f \cdot m \), 
  \[
  7.0 = K_f \cdot 1 \implies K_f = 7.0 \, \text{°C·kg/mol}
  \]

### Second Scenario:
- **Mass of sulfur**: 6.0 g
- **Mass of naphthalene**: 250 g (0.25 kg)
- **Moles of sulfur**: \( \frac{6.0}{M} \) (where \( M \) is the molecular weight of sulfur)
- **Molality (\( m_2 \))**:
  \[
  m_2 = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{mass of solvent in kg}} = \frac{\frac{6.0}{M}}{0.25} = \frac{24}{M} \, \text{mol/kg}
  \]
- **Freezing point depression**: \( \Delta T = 80.2 - 79.5 = 0.7 \, \text{°C} \)
- Using \( \Delta T = K_f \cdot m \), 
  \[
  0.7 = 7.0 \cdot \frac{24}{M} \implies M = \frac{24 \cdot 7.0}{0.7} = 240 \, \text{g/mol}
  \]

Thus, the molecular weight of sulfur is **240 g/mol**, which corresponds to option **B**.
