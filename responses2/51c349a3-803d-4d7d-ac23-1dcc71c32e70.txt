Okay, so I have this question about Addisons Disease, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Addisons Disease is a condition related to the adrenal glands. I think it's named after J.B. Addisons, who described it. The adrenal glands are located above the kidneys, and they produce a hormone called prolactin, which is responsible for producing milk. If the production of prolactin is impaired, the kidneys can't produce enough milk, leading to issues like frequent urination and thirst. That makes sense because when the body can't make milk, it can't satisfy its own needs, so it goes to the kidneys.

Looking at the options:

A: Frequent urination and thirst. That's directly related to the kidneys not getting enough milk, so this sounds correct.

B: Overactive thyroid. I don't recall Addisons Disease being linked to the thyroid. I think it's more about the adrenal glands.

C: High cholesterol levels. That's a common symptom, but Addisons isn't primarily associated with cholesterol; it's more about the adrenal glands.

D: Hypertension. Hypertension is high blood pressure, and Addisons is about milk production, which doesn't directly cause high blood pressure. So D isn't right.

E: Excessive insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells use glucose, not directly related to kidney issues. So E is incorrect.

F: Effect of pituitary gland. No, Addisons is about the adrenal glands. The pituitary is responsible for producing hormones like growth hormone, but not prolactin.

G: Cancer affecting adrenal glands. Addisons is a type of cancer, but I'm not sure if it's specifically affecting the adrenal glands. It can be a rare form of cancer, but it's not the main diagnosis of Addisons.

H: Diabetes as a complication. I don't think Addisons itself causes diabetes. It's more about kidney issues.

I: Leads to pigment changes. I'm not sure about this one. I know that some conditions like addisons disease can cause changes in pigmentation, but I'm not entirely certain if it's a known cause. I think it's less common and more of a symptom rather than a cause.

J: Deficiency of prolactin. No, that's the opposite. Addisons is about the production of prolactin being impaired, meaning the deficiency is reversed, not present.

So the options A and J are incorrect. Let me think again. The question asks which is true. So, A is correct because it's about frequent urination and thirst due to impaired production of prolactin. J is incorrect because Addisons is a deficiency of prolactin, not a deficiency causing it.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Could I have mixed up Addisons with another condition? Oh right, Addisons is a type of addression disease. It's a rare form of cancer. I think it's a condition where the adrenal glands are affected, but the primary cause is the deficiency of prolactin. So the correct answer should be A and J. But the question only allows one correct option. Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, and only one is correct.

Wait, I'm looking back. The options are A to J, each a statement. So the correct answer is A, because it's a known symptom. J is incorrect because it's the deficiency of prolactin, not the cause. So the correct statement is A.

Wait, but I'm also considering whether Addisons is a rare form or not. I think it's actually a form of addression, not cancer, but the cause is indeed the deficiency of prolactin. So the correct option is A.

Addisons Disease is associated with impaired production of prolactin, which is responsible for producing milk. When the kidneys cannot cope with insufficient milk intake, they turn to the adrenal glands for protein, leading to frequent urination and thirst. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. Frequent urination and thirst are symptoms of Addisons Disease.
- **B**: Incorrect. Addisons Disease is not linked to the overactive thyroid gland.
- **C**: Incorrect. High cholesterol levels are a common symptom but not the primary cause.
- **D**: Incorrect. It does not cause hypertension.
- **E**: Incorrect. Excessive insulin is unrelated to the condition.
- **F**: Incorrect. The pituitary gland is not involved.
- **G**: Incorrect. While Addisons is cancer, it's not associated specifically with the adrenal glands.
- **H**: Incorrect. It is not a complication of diabetes.
- **I**: Incorrect. It does not lead to pigment changes.
- **J**: Incorrect. Addisons Disease is due to a deficiency of prolactin, not a deficiency of it.

The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately describes a known symptom of Addisons Disease. 

Answer: A
