Okay, so I have this question about Pluto and its satellites. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking what the current best observations show about Pluto. The options are from A to J. I remember that Pluto is a dwarf planet, but it's been a bit of a puzzle because most space agencies thought it was a planet, but recent observations suggested it's not. 

I think the initial idea was that Pluto had several satellites. I recall that the original idea was that there were four satellites. But over time, that was changed. The current consensus is that Pluto doesn't have any satellites. So, looking at the options, that would point me to option D, which says "no satellites."

Let me go through the options again quickly. Option A is two large and one small. That doesn't seem right. B is one medium and two small. Hmm, I don't think that's accurate either. C says one large and one small. That would be two satellites, which might be too much if I remember correctly. E is one large and two small. That adds up to three, which I don't think is the current understanding. F is four small satellites, which I don't think was the case. G, three medium-sized. Again, not sure about that. H and I are about two medium-sized. Wait, I think I remember that there were two large satellites and two small ones before, but now it's been ruled out. J is one large and three small. Wait, no, that would be more than three. I'm a bit confused now. 

Wait, no, the current situation is that Pluto has no satellites. None of the options except D are suggesting that. So the correct answer should be D.
