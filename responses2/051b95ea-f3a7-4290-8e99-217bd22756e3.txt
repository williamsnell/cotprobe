Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Huizinga's support for Erasmus' belief in the "book of antiquity" being open to all. I'm trying to figure this out step by step. Let's break it down.

First, the question is about the relationship between Huizinga and Erasmus. I remember that Huizinga was a 19th-century Dutch philosopher involved in the Reformation. The text in question is about Erasmus' work and his influence on the Reformation.

The passage says that until then, humanists had monopolized classic culture to impress their multitude. Humanists were known for their mastery of ancient texts to showcase their knowledge to a crowd that was otherwise deficient. So, humanists were creating a special status among educated people, but perhaps they were using their mastery to control their audience.

Then, the passage mentions that Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, which spread it further, not just among the educated but also to the people in general. But he wanted to make it accessible to all. However, humanists were already limiting their influence to educated classes because Latin was for the educated. So, if someone wrote in Latin, they were in the educated class.

Now, the question is why Huizinga supports Erasmus' belief that the book of antiquity is open to everyone. The options are all different possibilities.

Looking at the options:

A: typical unflinching support of one for another. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

B: the author's life in the 20th century. Huizinga was in the 19th century, so unless the 20th century brings other factors, this might not be it.

C: personal admiration. That's possible, but I think the more likely reason is something else.

D: promote the spread of humanism. That makes sense because Huizinga was a Reformation advocate, and Erasmus was a key figure in that movement. So, if Huizinga supports Erasmus' belief, it's likely that he's promoting humanism, which would include expanding the reach beyond just educated people.

E: longevity of Erasmus' works. Not directly related to supporting Erasmus' belief.

F: influence of Erasmus on Huizinga's own philosophy. Possible, but I'm not sure.

G: Dutch reverence for Erasmus. That's possible, but I think it's more about their relation.

H: critique of exclusivity of classical education. Hmm. I'm not sure. The question is about the Reformation, so maybe the critique is about the church's exclusivity, but perhaps Huizinga's support is more about humanism's influence.

I: belief in relevance of antiquity to modern society. That's a bit of a stretch.

J: perspective on education. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

So, the main point here is that Huizinga supports Erasmus' belief that the book of antiquity is open to everyone. This is likely because Huizinga was a Reformation advocate, and he's known for promoting humanism. Erasmus worked towards spreading humanism, so Huizinga's support would be part of his broader Reformation efforts.

Looking back, the correct option is D: Huizinga's desire to promote the spread of humanism. This fits because Huizinga was a proponent of humanism, and believing that Erasmus' teachings were meant to be accessible to all would be part of his strategy.

The correct answer is D: Huizinga's desire to promote the spread of humanism. This is because Huizinga, a Reformation advocate, was deeply involved in spreading humanist ideas, and his support for Erasmus' belief in the universal accessibility of antiquity's teachings aligns with his broader Reformation goals, which included humanism.

Answer: D
