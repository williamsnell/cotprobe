Okay, so I've got this question here about converting ounces to grams, kilograms, and milligrams. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but I'll try my best.

The question says that a silver dollar weighs about 0.943 ounces. I need to express this in grams, kilograms, and milligrams. The options are given from A to J, and each option lists three values. I'll have to make sure I calculate each correctly and match the right numbers.

First, I remember that 1 ounce is equal to approximately 28.3495 grams. Wait, but sometimes I've seen it rounded to 28.35 grams. So for this problem, using 28.35 as the conversion factor makes sense. Alternatively, maybe the exact conversion is 28.3495 grams per ounce.

So, starting with 0.943 ounces. Let me convert that to grams first. 

So, grams = ounces × conversion factor. 

So, 0.943 oz × 28.3495 g/oz. Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.943 times 28.3495. Let me break it down.

Wait, maybe it's easier to do this step by step. 0.9 times 28.3495 is 25.51455. Then 0.04 times 28.3495 is about 1.13398. Then 0.003 times 28.3495 is approximately 0.0850485. Adding these together: 25.51455 + 1.13398 = 26.64853, plus 0.0850485 gives about 26.73358 grams. So approximately 26.73 grams. Looking at the options, option C says 26.73 g, which seems to match. But wait, let me check.

Wait, let me do the math more accurately. 0.943 multiplied by 28.3495.

Let me calculate 0.943 * 28.3495.

I can write this as (0.9 + 0.04 + 0.003) * 28.3495.

0.9 * 28.3495 = 25.51455
0.04 * 28.3495 = 1.13398
0.003 * 28.3495 = 0.0850485

Adding them all together: 25.51455 + 1.13398 = 26.64853, plus 0.0850485 is 26.7335785 grams. So approximately 26.7336 grams. So the closest option is option C which is 26.73 g.

Now that I've found the grams, I need to convert that to kilograms. I know that 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, so I'll divide by 1000.

So 26.7336 grams ÷ 1000 = 0.0267336 kg. Looking at the options, option C says 0.02673 kg, which is exactly what I got. So that's correct for kilograms.

Then, converting to milligrams. Since 1 kilogram is 1,000,000 milligrams, and I have 0.0267336 kg, I multiply by 1000000 mg/kg.

0.0267336 kg × 1,000,000 mg/kg = 26,733.6 mg. So approximately 26,734 mg. Looking at the options, option C says 26,730 mg. Hmm, that's close but not exact. Let me check if I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the initial grams. Maybe I should use the exact conversion factor for ounces to grams.

Wait, I think the precise conversion is 1 ounce = 28.3495231 grams. So 0.943 oz * 28.3495231 g/oz = ?

Let me compute 0.943 * 28.3495231.

Let me compute 0.9 * 28.3495231 = 25.51457081 grams.

0.04 * 28.3495231 = 1.133980924 grams.

0.003 * 28.3495231 = 0.0850485693 grams.

Adding them: 25.51457081 + 1.133980924 = 26.648551734 + 0.0850485693 = 26.733600303 grams.

So that's approximately 26.7336 grams. So 0.0267336 kg, and 26,733.6 mg.

Looking back at the options, option C says 26,730 mg. But my calculation says 26,733.6. Hmm, that's about 3.6 mg off. So maybe option C is close but not exact. Let me check if I made a mistake in the options.

Looking at the options, let's see each one:

Option C: 26.73 grams, 0.02673 kg, 26,730 mg.

Wait, 26,730 mg is 26.73 grams. Oh wait, that can't be right because 26,730 mg is 26.73 grams, which matches the grams I calculated. But why the discrepancy in the milligrams? Because 0.943 oz is 26.7336 grams, which is 26.7336 * 1000 = 26,733.6 mg. So the 0.02673 kg is 26,733.6 mg. So the mg should be about 26,734 mg. But option C says 26,730 mg, which is 0.02673 kg, but that's 26,730 mg. So there's a 3.6 mg difference.

Wait, but perhaps I'm not supposed to go that far? Let me check if perhaps the initial conversion factor was used as 28.3495 grams, not 28.3495231. Let me recalculate with 28.3495.

So 0.943 * 28.3495 = let's compute that.

0.9 * 28.3495 = 25.51455

0.04 * 28.3495 = 1.13398

0.003 * 28.3495 = 0.0850485

Adding up: 25.51455 + 1.13398 = 26.64853, plus 0.0850485 is 26.7335785 grams. So approximately 26.7336 grams.

So 26.7336 grams is 0.0267336 kg and 26,733.6 mg. So the correct milligrams would be approximately 26,734 mg. So option C gives 26,730 mg, which is off by 4 mg. That's a small error, but perhaps the options are rounded, and option C is the closest. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: 26.73 g, .02673 kg, 26,730 mg.

Wait, 26,730 mg is 26.73 grams. Hmm, that's the same as the grams value. So perhaps that's a typo, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the options have some rounding.

Wait, let me calculate the exact value again. Maybe I should use the exact conversion factor.

Ounces to grams: 1 ounce = 28.3495231 grams.

So 0.943 oz * 28.3495231 = ?

Let me multiply 0.943 by 28.3495231 accurately.

Break it down:

0.9 * 28.3495231 = 25.51457081

0.04 * 28.3495231 = 1.133980924

0.003 * 28.3495231 = 0.0850485693

Adding them: 25.51457081 + 1.133980924 = 26.648551734 + 0.0850485693 = 26.733600303 grams.

So 26.7336 grams. So 0.0267336 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 grams), and 26,733.6 mg.

So looking at the options, option C is 26.73 g, .02673 kg, 26,730 mg. Wait, 26,730 is 26.73 grams, which is the same as the grams value. But wait, 26,730 mg is 26.73 grams, so that's correct as the grams. But the milligrams should be 26,733.6, so this is a 3.6 mg difference. So perhaps the options are rounded, and option C is the correct one.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's milligrams are 26,730 mg, which is 26.73 grams. So that's matching the grams, but the milligrams are wrong. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck the initial conversion factor.

Wait, no, the conversion factor is correct. So perhaps the options are rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate each part.

First, grams = 0.943 oz * 28.3495231 g/oz.

Compute 0.943 * 28.3495231.

Let me compute it step by step.

0.9 * 28.3495231 = 25.51457081

0.04 * 28.3495231 = 1.133980924

0.003 * 28.3495231 = 0.0850485693

So adding all together: 25.51457081 + 1.133980924 = 26.648551734 + 0.0850485693 = 26.7336003 grams.

So grams = 26.7336 grams. So 26.73 grams, option C.

Kilograms: 26.7336 / 1000 = 0.0267336 kg. So option C's 0.02673 kg is correct.

Milligrams: 26.7336 grams * 1000 mg/gram = 26,733.6 mg. So option C says 26,730 mg. Hmm, that's 3.6 mg off. But perhaps the options are approximate, and the correct one is option C. Because 26,733.6 is closer to 26,730 than to 26,735.

Wait, but 26,733.6 is approximately 26,730, but the exact value is 26,733.6. So perhaps in the options, option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C's milligrams are 26,730 mg, which doesn't make sense because 26,733.6 is not 26,730. So perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, let me do 0.943 * 28.3495231 again.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would help, but I don't have one. Alternatively, perhaps a mistake in the initial numbers.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 0.943 * 28.3495231.

I can write this as 1 * 28.3495231 = 28.3495231

Minus (1 - 0.943) * 28.3495231.

Wait, 1 - 0.943 = 0.057.

0.057 * 28.3495231 = ?

0.05 * 28.3495231 = 1.4174761555

0.007 * 28.3495231 = 0.1984466617

Adding together: 1.4174761555 + 0.1984466617 = 1.6159228172.

So 28.3495231 - 1.6159228172 = 26.7336002828 grams.

So that's 26.7336002828 grams, which is 26.7336 grams. So that's correct.

So the milligrams are 26,733.6 mg. So option C is 26,730 mg, which is approximately 26,733.6, but not exact. But perhaps the options are rounded to the nearest 10 mg or something. Alternatively, perhaps D: 24.73 grams, .02473 kg, 24,730 mg.

Wait, but 0.943 oz is about 26.73 grams, not 24.73. So option D is incorrect.

Looking at option C, the milligrams are 26,730, which is 3.6 mg less than the correct value. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option that correctly converts grams to kilograms and milligrams.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the kilogram conversion. 0.943 grams is 0.000943 kg? No, wait, 1 kilogram is 1000 grams. So 0.943 grams is 0.000943 kg. But none of the options have that. So the correct kilogram value is 0.02673 kg, which is option C.

So the only options with 0.02673 kg are options C and perhaps D. But D's grams are 24.73, which is way too low. So the correct answer is option C.

To convert 0.943 ounces (oz) to grams (g), kilograms (kg), and milligrams (mg), we use the following steps:

1. **Convert ounces to grams:**
   - The conversion factor is \( 1 \, \text{oz} = 28.3495231 \, \text{g} \).
   - Calculation: \( 0.943 \, \text{oz} \times 28.3495231 \, \text{g/oz} = 26.7336 \, \text{g} \).
   - Rounded to three significant figures: \( 26.73 \, \text{g} \).

2. **Convert grams to kilograms:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kg} = 1000 \, \text{g} \).
   - Calculation: \( 26.73 \, \text{g} \div 1000 = 0.02673 \, \text{kg} \).
   - Rounded to four significant figures: \( 0.02673 \, \text{kg} \).

3. **Convert grams to milligrams:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{g} = 1000 \, \text{mg} \).
   - Calculation: \( 26.73 \, \text{g} \times 1000 = 26,730 \, \text{mg} \).
   - Rounded to three significant figures: \( 26,730 \, \text{mg} \).

Now, compare the results with the options:

- **Option C:** \( 26.73 \, \text{g}, \, 0.02673 \, \text{kg}, \, 26,730 \, \text{mg} \).  
  - Grams match exactly.  
  - Kilograms match exactly.  
  - Milligrams match exactly.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
