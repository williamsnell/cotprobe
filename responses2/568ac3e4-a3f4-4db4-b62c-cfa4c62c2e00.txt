Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the length of a curve given by parametric equations. The equations are x equals cos t and y equals sin t, with t ranging from 0 to pi. Hmm, I remember that the length of a parametric curve can be found using an integral. Let me try to recall the formula.

Oh right, the formula for the length of a parametric curve from t = a to t = b is the integral from a to b of the square root of (dx/dt)^2 plus (dy/dt)^2 dt. So first, I need to find the derivatives of x and y with respect to t.

Given x = cos t, so dx/dt is -sin t. And y = sin t, so dy/dt is cos t. Now I square both derivatives: (-sin t)^2 is sin²t, and (cos t)^2 is cos²t. Adding them together gives sin²t + cos²t, which is 1, because that's one of the Pythagorean identities.

So the integrand becomes sqrt(1) which is 1. That simplifies things a lot. So the integral from 0 to pi of 1 dt is just the integral of 1 with respect to t over that interval. That integral equals t evaluated from 0 to pi, so pi minus 0 is pi.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The parametric equations are x = cos t and y = sin t. So as t goes from 0 to pi, x starts at cos 0 = 1, goes to cos(pi) = -1, and y starts at sin 0 = 0, goes to sin(pi) = 0. So it's tracing the upper half of the unit circle from (1,0) to (-1,0), passing through (0,1). So the curve is a semicircle, but wait, no, because for t from 0 to pi, the curve is half of the unit circle, but only the top half? Or does it include the bottom? Let me think. When t goes from 0 to pi, cos t goes from 1 to -1 while sin t goes from 0 to 0, but actually, when t=pi/2, sin t is 1, so that's the top. So the curve is the upper semicircle from (1,0) to (-1,0). But wait, isn't that actually a semicircle with radius 1, so the length should be pi as I thought.

Wait, but let's double-check the integral. The integrand is sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 ) = sqrt( sin²t + cos²t ) = sqrt(1) =1. So integrating 1 from t=0 to pi is indeed pi. So the length is pi.

Looking at the options: A is 2, B is 3pi, C is 4, D is 3/2, E is 3, F is pi/3, G is 4pi, H is 2pi, I is pi/2, J is pi.

So the correct answer should be J: pi.

The length of the curve defined by the parametric equations \( x = \cos t \) and \( y = \sin t \) from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = \pi \) is calculated using the formula for the length of a parametric curve:

\[
\text{Length} = \int_{0}^{\pi} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

First, compute the derivatives:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = \cos t
\]

Square them and add:
\[
\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 = \sin^2 t + \cos^2 t = 1
\]

Thus, the integrand simplifies to 1, and the integral becomes:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} 1 \, dt = \pi
\]

Therefore, the length of the curve is \( \pi \), which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
