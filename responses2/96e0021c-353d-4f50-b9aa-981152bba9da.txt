Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time, and I need to choose the correct formula from the options given. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The problem states that the daily cost of producing n Gaped Ghouls is given by the function C(n) = 0.2n² + n + 900 dollars. So, that's straightforward; it's a quadratic function in terms of n.

Then, it says that t² + 100t Caped Ghouls can be produced in t hours. Wait, I need to figure out what this means. I think this is telling me that the number of Caped Ghouls produced is a function of time, right? Because it's dependent on t hours. So, the number of Caped Ghouls produced, let's call it n(t), would be n(t) = t² + 100t. Because for each hour t, you can produce t² + 100t Caped Ghouls.

But wait, I should be careful. The problem says "t² + 100t Caped Ghouls can be produced in t hours." So, within t hours, the factory produces t² + 100tCaped Ghouls. So, n(t) = t² + 100t. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time. So, that's basically the derivative of C with respect to t. But C is a function of n, and n is a function of t. So, I'll need to use the chain rule here. The chain rule says that dC/dt = dC/dn * dn/dt.

So, first, let's find dC/dn. Given that C(n) = 0.2n² + n + 900, the derivative of this with respect to n is straightforward. The derivative of 0.2n² is 0.4n, the derivative of n is 1, and the derivative of a constant 900 is 0. So, dC/dn = 0.4n + 1.

Next, we need to find dn/dt. Since n(t) = t² + 100t, the derivative of that with respect to t is 2t + 100. So, dn/dt = 2t + 100.

Now, multiply dC/dn by dn/dt to get dC/dt. Let's compute that:

dC/dt = (0.4n + 1) * (2t + 100).

But wait, we need to express this entirely in terms of t, not n. Because n is a function of t, so we can substitute n with t² + 100t.

So, substituting n = t² + 100t into the equation, we get:

dC/dt = (0.4*(t² + 100t) + 1) * (2t + 100).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 0.4*(t² + 100t) = 0.4t² + 40t.

Then add 1: 0.4t² + 40t + 1.

Now, multiply this by (2t + 100):

(0.4t² + 40t + 1) * (2t + 100).

Alright, let's expand this product term by term.

First, multiply 0.4t² by each term in the second bracket:

0.4t² * 2t = 0.8t³.
0.4t² * 100 = 40t².

Next, multiply 40t by each term in the second bracket:

40t * 2t = 80t².
40t * 100 = 4000t.

Then, multiply 1 by each term in the second bracket:

1 * 2t = 2t.
1 * 100 = 100.

Now, let's add all these up:

0.8t³ + 40t² + 80t² + 4000t + 2t + 100.

Combine like terms:

t³: 0.8t³.

t²: 40t² + 80t² = 120t².

t terms: 4000t + 2t = 4002t.

Constant: 100.

So, putting it all together, dC/dt is 0.8t³ + 120t² + 4002t + 100.

Wait, let me check the options. Let's see:

Option J is 0.8t³ + 120t² + 4002t + 100. So, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be J.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

0.4t² + 40t + 1 multiplied by 2t + 100.

0.4t² * 2t = 0.8t³.

0.4t² * 100 = 40t².

40t * 2t = 80t².

40t * 100 = 4000t.

1 * 2t = 2t.

1 * 100 = 100.

Adding all terms:

0.8t³ + (40t² +80t²) = 120t².

(4000t +2t) = 4002t.

100.

Yes, that's correct. So the derivative dC/dt is 0.8t³ + 120t² + 4002t + 100. So the correct option is J.

To determine the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time, we start with the given cost function \( C(n) = 0.2n^2 + n + 900 \) and the relationship \( n(t) = t^2 + 100t \). The rate of change of cost with respect to time is found using the chain rule:

1. **Derivative of \( C(n) \) with respect to \( n \):**
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dn} = 0.4n + 1
   \]

2. **Derivative of \( n(t) \) with respect to \( t \):**
   \[
   \frac{dn}{dt} = 2t + 100
   \]

3. **Apply the chain rule:**
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{dC}{dn} \cdot \frac{dn}{dt} = (0.4n + 1)(2t + 100)
   \]

4. **Substitute \( n(t) = t^2 + 100t \):**
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dt} = (0.4(t^2 + 100t) + 1)(2t + 100)
   \]

5. **Expand and simplify:**
   \[
   (0.4t^2 + 40t + 1)(2t + 100) = 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100
   \]

Thus, the formula for the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time matches **Option J**, which is \( 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100 \).

**ANSWER: J**
