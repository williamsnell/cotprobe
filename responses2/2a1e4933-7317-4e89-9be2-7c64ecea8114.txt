Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about mergesort and the data structures it uses. Let me think through it step by step.

Mergsort works by splitting a list into halves, sorting each half, and then merging them. The key here is the time complexity, which is O(n log n). I remember that this relies on efficient merging. 

So the question is asking which data structures allow mergesort to work in that time. The options are I. a singly linked list, II. a doubly linked list, and III. an array.

First, I should understand what each data structure requires for merging.

In mergesort, during the merge step, the two sorted lists are merged into one. The way this is done depends on the data structure used for the list.

1. **Singly Linked List (Option I)**: A singly linked list has a previous and next pointer for each node. When merging, you can easily find the next and previous nodes, but during the merge, you need to compare elements. However, the merge process in a linked list is similar to an array's merge, but it's done iteratively. Wait, noâ€”merging two linked lists typically involves traversing each list, comparing elements, and linking them. So the time for merging is O(n), same as an array. Oh, but wait, in a linked list, each node is accessed sequentially, so the number of comparisons is still logarithmic with the size, but the time complexity remains O(n log n) for the overall process because each merge step is O(n) for each list. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the overall time complexity of mergesort is O(n log n), which is achieved because each recursive step splits the list into two halves. So the key is the merge step, which is O(n) time. So for the merge step, whether it's a linked list or an array, the merge time is O(n), same as the array case. So why would the linked list matter? Oh, wait, no. The issue is whether the merge can be done in O(n) time.

In a linked list, the merge process would require traversing both lists and comparing each element, which is O(n) time. So it's O(n) for the merge. But wait, for the overall complexity, the number of levels is log n, and each level's merge is O(n), leading to O(n log n) in total.

So for the linked list, the merge is O(n), same as array. So why is the linked list considered here?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in a linked list, merging is more efficient in certain ways, but the time complexity is the same as an array. So whether it's a linked list or array, the overall time is O(n log n).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

In the case of a linked list, each merge step is O(n) because you have to traverse both lists to compare elements, but the overall algorithm is O(n log n) because the number of merge steps is O(n log n). Wait, no, that's not right. Because each merge step in the linked list is O(n), but the number of levels in the recursion is log n. So the total time is O(n log n) because each level's merge is O(n), and there are log n levels. But for the linked list, the merge step is done in O(n) time because it's just a linear traversal. So for the linked list, the merge step is O(n), which is part of the O(n log n) time.

Wait, no, the total time for mergesort is based on the number of comparisons and the way the merge is done. For a linked list, merging two sorted lists would require O(n) time because you have to compare each element. So the overall time for the merge step is O(n), but the number of such steps is O(log n), so the total time is O(n log n), same as the array case.

So in that sense, whether it's a linked list or array, the mergesort's time is O(n log n). So why would the linked list be a consideration here?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in a linked list, the actual data is stored in a way that requires certain access patterns for the merge to be efficient. For example, when merging two sorted lists, you have to access each node in order. With a linked list, you can just follow the pointers, which is O(1) per operation, right? So the time for the merge is O(n) for each merge step, but the way you traverse is O(n), same as arrays.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is not with the time complexity but with the data structure's ability to handle the merging process. Wait, no. The question is about which data structures allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time. Both a linked list and an array can do that. Oh, but wait, the third option is an array. So why is the question including option I and II?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the data structures confused. Let me think again about the mergesort process.

In mergesort, the process is:

- Split into halves: O(1) for splitting, but for a linked list, each split is O(n) time? Or is split O(1) regardless of the structure? Because the way it's split depends on the structure. For an array, splitting is O(n) time because you have to shift elements. But for a linked list, splitting is O(1) time because you can split the list in half by changing pointers.

Wait, wait, no. Because each node in a linked list is a separate entity, you can't just split the list into two without changing the pointers. So for a linked list, splitting into two halves is O(n) time because you have to traverse all nodes to split them. For example, in a linked list, you have to find the middle node to split. That's O(n) time.

But in an array, you can split in O(1) time by just dividing the array into two parts.

So if the split is O(n), then the time for the recursive calls is O(n) for the array but O(n) for the linked list? Or wait, no: the split is O(n) in the linked list because you have to find the middle node. So for the array, it's O(1) to split. So in the case of the linked list, the split takes O(n) time, but for the array, it's O(1).

But the overall time for mergesort is O(n log n), regardless of whether the split is O(n) or O(1) time. Because the number of recursive calls is O(n log n), but each split takes O(n) time for the array, but O(n) for the linked list. Wait, no, the time for the split is part of the overall O(n log n) time. So for the array, the split is O(n), but the merging is O(n), so each merge is O(n), but the number of levels is O(log n). Thus, the total time is O(n log n).

Wait, but for the array, the split is O(n), which is part of the O(n log n) time. So the overall time for the array is O(n log n), same as the linked list. So the data structure's type doesn't affect the time complexity? Because the split and merge steps are both O(n log n), but for the linked list, the per-merge cost is O(n).

Wait, no, the split is O(n) for both structures, and the merge is O(n) for both. So the overall time is O(n log n) for both. So the data structure doesn't affect the time complexity? That can't be right. Because in practice, for a linked list, the split is O(n), and the merge is O(n), but if I have a linked list that's split into two, I have to create a new list by merging, which can be done in O(n) time. So the time for each recursive step is O(n), but the number of steps is O(log n). So the total time is O(n log n).

Wait, but for an array, each split is O(1), but the merge is O(n), so the number of splits is O(n log n), each taking O(n) time. So the total time would be O(n^2 log n), which is worse. So that's why arrays are preferred for mergesort because the split is O(1), so the total time is O(n log n).

So back to the question. The question says which data structures allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time. The options are I, II, and III.

Wait, the third option is an array. So for an array, the split is O(1), and the merge is O(n) per level, leading to O(n log n) time. So for an array, it's O(n log n). For a linked list, the split is O(n), but the merge is O(n), and the number of levels is O(log n), leading to O(n log n) total time.

So both I and II allow O(n log n) time. Wait, the question is asking which data structures will allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time. So option III (array) and option I (linked list) both allow it, and option II (linked list) also allows it.

Wait, but wait, the third option is an array.

So in the question, the options are I. a singly linked list, II. a doubly linked list, III. an array.

So the answer would include I, II, and III.

Wait, but wait, in the linked list case, the split is O(n), but the merge is O(n). So each level's merge is O(n), and the number of levels is O(log n), so O(n log n) in total. So yes, linked list and array both allow O(n log n).

Wait, but then why is the question asking about the data structures? Because in practice, the array is better because of the split. But the question is about which data structures allow it in O(n log n) time, regardless of practicality. So both I and II are acceptable, and III is also acceptable.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which data structures allow. So I think all three (I, II, III) would allow it. So the options are:

I. Yes.

II. Yes.

III. Yes.

So the answer would be D: I, II, and III.

Wait, but let me think again. For the linked list, the split is O(n) time. Let's say for n=8. Splitting into two 4-lists takes 4 steps (each node is checked, perhaps), so O(n) time.

Then, each merge is O(n) time because you have to traverse both lists to merge. So each merge is O(n). Then, for log n levels, the total time would be O(n log n), same as for the array.

So yes, the linked list and array both allow O(n log n) time. So the correct answer is D: I, II, III. So the answer would be D.
</think>

Mergesort's time complexity of O(n log n) depends on the data structure used for the list. In the case of a linked list, the split operation is O(n), and the merge operation is O(n), leading to an overall time complexity of O(n log n). Similarly, for an array, the split operation is O(1), and the merge operation is O(n), also resulting in O(n log n) time. However, for a doubly linked list, the same reasoning applies. Therefore, all three data structures (I, II, III) allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time.
