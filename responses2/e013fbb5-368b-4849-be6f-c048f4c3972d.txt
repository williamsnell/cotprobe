Question:

While on vacation, two friends went scuba diving in the ocean. Each of them was equipped with a spear gun, which they planned to use to kill tuna. As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule

Options:

A: against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.
B: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.
C: in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.
D: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.
E: in favor of the victim, as both defendants acted recklessly in a situation that required caution.
F: against the defendant who cannot prove he did not shoot the spear, while the other defendant is exempt from damages.
G: against each defendant for one-third of the amount of damages, with the remaining one-third to be determined by the jury.
H: in favor of both defendants if the victim cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt who shot the spear that injured him.
I: against both defendants for the full amount of damages, as they were both responsible for the situation.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, two friends went scuba diving and saw a fin entangled in coral. They both shot their spear guns at a projecting figure, which turned out to be another diver. The victim was hit by one spear and is suing for damages. The question is about what the judge should instruct the jury to do.

Hmm, so I remember that in criminal law, when someone is shot by two people, each's liability depends on whether they individually caused the injury. But wait, in this case, both shot at the same time. So, the key is whether each defendant's actions were causally related to the injury.

Wait, when both actions are simultaneous, the standard is that each must be individually proven to have caused the injury. Because in criminal liability, the standard of proof is usually "negligence" or "innocent until proven guilty." So each defendant (the two friends) must prove that their actions led to the injury.

Wait, but the question says the two friends shot the same object. So, if one shot it, the other didn't. But the problem is that in this scenario, both shot it. So, in this case, each defendant's action could have been either responsible for the injury, but the question is, can both be proven responsible?

Wait, no, because if the same object was involved, the two shooting at it would be a joint action. The law would require that each defendant prove that their own shooting was responsible for the injury. So each must prove that one of their own actions (either their own spear gun) caused the injury.

Wait, but in this case, each shot the same object. So, each of their own actions (shooting their own gun) may be responsible.

Wait, but the problem is that the two friends didn't cause the injuryâ€”they're the ones who shot at the object. So, each defendant (friend) must prove that their own actions led to the injury.

Wait, but if the two were shooting at the same object, then each could be responsible if each shot the object. So, each defendant's action (shooting their own spear gun) would need to be proven responsible.

But wait, the problem is that the object was projecting, and each shot at it. So, if one of them shot at the object, maybe they could be held responsible. But in this case, both shot at the same object. So, the question is, did each of them contribute in their own way to the injury.

Wait, no, because both shot at the same object. So, if both shot, then it's ambiguous whether each is responsible. But in criminal law, the rule is that each defendant must prove that their own actions caused the injury. So, each must show that their shooting was directly responsible.

Wait, but in this case, both of their actions were at the same target. So, each defendant's action (shooting their own spear) could be responsible if each shot the object. So, each defendant must prove that their own action caused the injury.

Wait, but that's not possible because the object was projecting, and both shot at it. Wait, perhaps each of their own actions (shooting their own gun) caused the injury. So, each defendant (the two friends) must prove that their own actions (the spear guns) were responsible for the injury.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The object was projecting, and the two friends shot at it. So, each of their actions (shooting their own gun) could be considered. If each of them shot the object, then each's action (shooting the object) could be a cause of the injury.

Wait, but the reasoning is that each defendant must prove that their own actions (the spear guns) caused the injury. So, each must show that their own actions were responsible.

Wait, but in this case, each shot the object. So, if each shot the object, then each's action (shooting) could be considered as contributing to the injury.

Wait, but it's possible that one of them didn't cause the injury, but the other did. So, each must prove that their own action was responsible.

So, if the two defendants each individually prove that their own actions were responsible for the injury, they are each liable. So, each defendant must be found responsible.

But wait, how? Because both of them shot the same object, so each could have individually caused the injury. So, each needs to prove that their action was the one that caused the injury.

So, in this case, the defense is that each defendant individually caused the injury. So, each must be found responsible. So, the correct answer would be that the jury should be instructed to find each defendant liable for the damages.

Looking at the options, option A says "against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Or is it that each must individually prove their own action was responsible.

Wait, no, the reason is that if one of them didn't shoot the spear that injured, you can't just joint liability. Each must prove their own individual responsibility.

So, if the defendant is able to prove that he didn't shoot the spear that caused the injury, then the other defendant's liability is split. Because the injury could have been caused by the other's action.

So, the correct instruction is that the jury should instruct each defendant to prove individually whether they shot the spear that injured the victim. If a defendant can prove that they didn't shoot the spear, then the other gets half of the damages. If neither can prove, then the other is liable for all the damages.

Wait, so the correct option is A: against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that injured the victim.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-read option A. It says, "against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim."

Hmm, that sounds like the option is suggesting that each defendant must individually prove that they didn't shoot the spear that caused the injury. If one can't, then the other is liable for all.

But I thought that each defendant only needs to prove that their own action was responsible. So, if one can't prove their own action was responsible, then the other is responsible for the entire damages.

So, in that case, the correct instruction would be that each defendant must prove that they shot the spear that injured the victim. If one cannot, the other is fully responsible.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim." Wait, is this making it so that if one can't prove their action was responsible, then the other is liable for all?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because in criminal law, each defendant must prove that their own actions were responsible for the injury. So, each must prove that they shot the object, or that the object's presence caused their own actions to be responsible.

Wait, but perhaps the rule is that each defendant's actions must be individually proven to have contributed to the injury. So, each must prove that their own spear gun was responsible.

So, if each defendant (friend) must prove that their own action (shooting their own gun) caused the injury, then each must be individually tried.

So, the correct instruction is option A: each defendant must prove that they shot the spear that caused the injury. If one can't, the other is liable for all.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Another approach: in a simultaneous joint action, each defendant must prove that their own actions were responsible. So, each must prove that their own shooting was the cause.

Thus, the correct instruction is that each must be found responsible. So, the correct answer would be that the jury should instruct each defendant to prove that they shot the spear that caused the injury.

Looking at the options, option A says "against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear." So, if one can't prove, the other is fully liable. But that doesn't fit the standard. Because each should individually prove their own responsibility.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but another way to look at it: if both shot at the same object, then perhaps if one of them didn't shoot the object, the other is liable for the entire damage. Because the object was there, so the damage could be caused by the other's actions. So, if one couldn't prove, the other is entirely responsible.

But in this case, both shot the object, so each could be responsible.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The question is: which instruction is correct for this scenario?

When both parties act simultaneously at the same location, each must prove that their own actions contributed to the injury. So, each must prove that their actions (shooting their own gun) were responsible. Therefore, each defendant must be individually found responsible.

So, if a defendant cannot prove that they shot the object that injured, then the other defendant is fully liable.

So, the correct instruction is that the jury should instruct each defendant to prove that they shot the object that caused the injury. If one cannot, then the other is fully liable.

Looking at the options, option A says that. So, the correct answer would be A.

The question involves two scuba divers who simultaneously shot a projecting object that injured one of them. The correct approach to determining liability in this scenario requires that each defendant must prove that their actions were responsible for the injury. Since both shot at the same object, each must individually demonstrate that their own actions contributed to the injury. If one defendant fails to prove their own responsibility, the other is liable for the entire damages.

**Option A** accurately reflects this requirement. It instructs the jury to find each defendant individually responsible for the injury, with the provision that if one fails to prove their own actions caused the injury, the other is fully liable.
