Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about regression. Let me think through each option to figure out which one is false. The question is asking which sentence is false regarding regression.

First, I remember that regression analysis is a statistical technique used to examine the relationship between variables. It's commonly used to understand how the typical value of a dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held constant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It may be used for interpretation. Hmm, I think regression is often used to understand relationships and effects. So this seems true. For example, you might use it to see if an increase in study time leads to higher grades.

Option B: It is used for prediction. Oh right, regression can predict values. Like, if you have data on house sizes and prices, you can predict the price of a new house based on its size. So this is definitely true.

Option C: It relates inputs to outputs. That makes sense. In regression, the inputs are the independent variables (like predictors) and the output is the dependent variable. So yes, this is a fundamental concept.

Option D: It discovers causal relationships. Wait, that's tricky. I think regression doesn't automatically show causation. It shows association, meaning two variables are related, but not necessarily that one causes the other. For example, ice cream sales and hot days might be correlated, but that doesn't mean ice cream sales cause hot days. So this statement is false.

So the false statement is D.

The false statement is D: It discovers causal relationships, as regression analysis typically identifies associations rather than causation.

Answer: D
