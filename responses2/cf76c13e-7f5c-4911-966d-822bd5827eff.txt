Question:

A silicious rock contains the mineral ZnS. To analyze for Zn, a sample of the rock is pulverized and treated with HCl to dissolve the ZnS (silicious matter is insoluable). Zinc is precipitated from solution by the addition of potassium ferrocyanide K_4 Fe (CN)_6. After filtering, the precipitate is dried and weighed. The reactions which occur are ZnS + 2HCl \rightarrow ZnCl_2 + H_2 S 2ZnCl_2 + K_4 Fe (CN)_6 \rightarrow Zn_2 Fe (CN)_6 + 4 KCl If a 2 gram sample of rock yields 0.969 gram of Zn_2Fe(CN)_6, what is the percentage of Zn in the sample? Atomic weight Zn = 65.4, molecular weight Zn_2 Fe (CN)_6 = 342.6.

Options:

A: 10 % Zn
B: 22 % Zn
C: 20 % Zn
D: 19 % Zn
E: 15 % Zn
F: 18 % Zn
G: 16 % Zn
H: 14 % Zn

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about determining the percentage of zinc in a rock sample based on the amount of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ precipitate formed. Alright, I need to think through the steps to find the correct answer.

So the setup: the rock is a silicious rock, which means it contains ZnS. They treated the sample with HCl to dissolve ZnS, making it insoluble. Then they added potassium ferrocyanide, K₄Fe(CN)6, which is a strong oxidizing agent. When they add the ferrocyanide, the Zn²+ from the ZnS gets oxidized, and the ferrocyanide itself gets reduced.

The reactions given are:
1. ZnS + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂S
2. 2ZnCl₂ + K₄Fe(CN)6 → Zn₂Fe(CN)6 + 4KCl

From the second reaction, we can see that two moles of ZnCl₂ react with one mole of K₄Fe(CN)6 to form one mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6 and four moles of KCl.

The given sample is 2 grams of rock, which gives 0.969 grams of Zn₂Fe(CN)6. We need to find the percentage of Zn in the rock.

First, I think I should find out how much Zn₂Fe(CN)6 is present in the sample, then find the moles of Zn in that, and then work out the percentage in the original 2 grams.

Wait, but wait. The sample is 2 grams, which is the total mass of the rock. The Zn₂Fe(CN)6 precipitate is a product, but I'm not sure if all the Zn in the rock is in this compound. Alternatively, maybe all the Zn in the rock contributes to this. I think so because the other reactions produce ZnCl₂, which is soluble, so the precipitate is the Zn₂Fe(CN)6.

So the 0.969 grams of Zn₂Fe(CN)6 must contain all the zinc from the rock. Because the first reaction produces ZnCl₂, which is soluble, so the only product is the precipitate.

So, I can calculate moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)6. Then, find the moles of Zn in that, then find the mass of Zn, then find the percentage from the 2 grams.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ from the mass given.
2. From the stoichiometry, find moles of Zn.
3. Calculate the mass of Zn from moles.
4. Divide by the total mass of the sample (2g) to get the percentage.

First, let's find the moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆. The molecular weight is given as 342.6 g/mol.

Molar mass: 342.6 g/mol.

Mass of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ = 0.969 grams.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.969 g / 342.6 g/mol.

Let me compute that.

0.969 / 342.6 ≈ 0.002826 mol.

So approximately 0.002826 moles.

Now, from the reaction, 2 ZnCl₂ reacts with 1 Zn₂Fe(CN)₆. So the mole ratio is 2 moles ZnCl₂ : 1 mole Zn₂Fe(CN)₆.

So for each mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆, 2 moles of Zn are released.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The reaction is 2 ZnCl₂ + K₄Fe(CN)6 → Zn₂Fe(CN)6 + 4 KCl.

So for 1 mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6, 2 moles of ZnCl₂ are consumed, which means 2 moles of Zn (since ZnCl₂ dissociates into Zn²+ and Cl⁻).

Wait, no. Wait, each ZnCl₂ is a source of one Zn²+ ion. So for each 2 ZnCl₂, you get 2 Zn²+.

Wait, no, each mole of ZnCl₂ gives one mole of Zn²+.

So 2 moles of ZnCl₂ would give 2 moles of Zn²+.

So in the reaction, 1 mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6 corresponds to 2 moles of Zn²+.

Therefore, moles of Zn = 2 × moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)6.

So moles of Zn = 2 × 0.002826 ≈ 0.005652 moles.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check: the reaction is 2 ZnCl₂ + K₄Fe(CN)6 → Zn₂Fe(CN)6 + 4 KCl.

So for each mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6 made, 2 moles of ZnCl₂ are consumed. Each ZnCl₂ gives one Zn²+. So 2 moles of ZnCl₂ → 2 moles of Zn²+ → 2 moles of Zn.

So yes, for each mole of precipitate, 2 moles of Zn are present.

So yeah, moles of Zn is 2 × moles of precipitate.

So, moles of Zn = 2 * 0.002826 ≈ 0.005652 mol.

Now, the molar mass of Zn is 65.4 g/mol.

Mass of Zn = moles × molar mass = 0.005652 mol × 65.4 g/mol.

Let me compute that.

0.005652 * 65.4. Let me compute it step by step.

65.4 * 0.005652:

First, 65 * 0.005652 is approximately:

0.005652 * 65 = let me see: 65 * 0.005 is 0.325, 65 * 0.000652 is approximately 0.04243. So total is 0.325 + 0.04243 = 0.36743.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 65 * 0.005652 = (65 * 5.652e-3) → 65 * 5.652 is 367.86, then e-3 → 0.36786 grams.

But wait, let's do it more accurately.

0.005652 * 65.4.

Compute 65.4 * 5.652e-3.

Compute 65.4 * 5.652 = ?

Let me compute 65.4 × 5 = 327.

65.4 × 0.652.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 65.4 × 5.652.

Hmm, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.005652 * 65.4.

Let me compute 0.005652 * 65.4:

65.4 * 0.005652

= (60 * 0.005652) + (5.4 * 0.005652)

60 * 0.005652 = 0.33912

5.4 * 0.005652 = 0.0305208

Adding them: 0.33912 + 0.0305208 = 0.3696408 grams.

So approximately 0.3696 grams of Zn.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The molar mass of Zn is 65.4, so 0.005652 moles × 65.4 g/mol = 0.005652 × 65.4.

Wait, 0.005652 × 65.4: Let me compute it as (5.652e-3) × 65.4.

5.652e-3 × 65.4.

5.652 * 65.4 = Let's compute that.

5 * 65.4 = 327.

0.6 * 65.4 = 39.24.

0.05 * 65.4 = 3.27.

0.002 *65.4=0.1308.

So sum: 327 +39.24=366.24; +3.27=369.51; +0.1308=369.6408.

So 5.652 * 65.4 = 369.6408.

Multiply by 1e-3: 0.3696408 grams.

So mass of Zn is approximately 0.3696 grams.

Wait, but wait. The sample is 2 grams of rock, so the percent is (0.3696 / 2.000) *100.

0.3696 /2 = 0.1848 → 18.48%.

So approximately 18.5% Zn.

Looking at the options, option F is 18 % Zn. So I'd select F.

Wait, but let me double-check the stoichiometry, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the reaction, 2 ZnCl₂ + K₄Fe(CN)6 → Zn₂Fe(CN)6 + 4 KCl.

So 2 moles ZnCl₂ → 1 mole Zn₂Fe(CN)6. So for each mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6, 2 moles of Zn are present.

So the moles of Zn is 2 × moles of precipitate.

Molar mass of Zn is 65.4 g/mol.

So moles of Zn: 2 × (0.969g / 342.6 g/mol) → 2 × 0.002826 → 0.005652 mol.

Mass of Zn: 0.005652 ×65.4 = 0.3696 grams.

So 0.3696 g Zn in 2.000 g sample.

Percentage: (0.3696 / 2.000) ×100 = 18.48% → approximately 18.5%.

So the closest option is F: 18% Zn.

To determine the percentage of zinc (Zn) in the rock sample, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆**:  
   The mass of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ is given as 0.969 g, and its molar mass is 342.6 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆} = \frac{0.969}{342.6} \approx 0.002826 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Determine moles of Zn**:  
   From the reaction \( 2 \, \text{ZnCl}_2 + \text{K}_4\text{Fe(CN)}_6 \rightarrow \text{Zn}_2\text{Fe(CN)}_6 + 4 \, \text{KCl} \), 2 moles of ZnCl₂ produce 1 mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆, meaning 2 moles of Zn are released.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Zn} = 2 \times \text{Moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆} = 2 \times 0.002826 \approx 0.005652 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Calculate mass of Zn**:  
   The molar mass of Zn is 65.4 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Zn} = \text{Moles of Zn} \times \text{Molar mass of Zn} = 0.005652 \times 65.4 \approx 0.3696 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Determine percentage of Zn in the sample**:  
   The total mass of the sample is 2.000 g.  
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Zn} = \left( \frac{0.3696}{2.000} \right) \times 100 \approx 18.48\%.
   \]

5. **Select the closest option**:  
   The calculated percentage of Zn is approximately 18.5%, which matches option **F: 18 % Zn**.
