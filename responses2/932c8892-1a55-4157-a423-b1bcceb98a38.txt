Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that a machine costs $1,000,000 and lasts for 10 years. At the end, it has a scrap value of $100,000. They're asking how much depreciation should be taken each year and how it's shown in the capital account.

Hmm. I remember there are a few methods of depreciation. Let's think about the straight-line method because that's the one where you spread the cost evenly over the useful life. So the formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Scrap Value) / Useful Life.

Wait, the cost is $1M, scrap is $100k. So $1,000,000 minus $100,000 is $900,000. Then divide by 10 years. So $90,000 per year. Oh, that's option H.

But wait, sometimes you might use accelerated depreciation methods like straight-line but with higher rates in the early years. But the question doesn't specify. It just says "how much," so I think straight-line is the most straightforward answer here. So H is the answer.

As for the capital account, that's where the depreciation is recorded. So each year, the machine's book value goes down by $90k. So the capital account would have a debit for $90k each year, and a credit for the same amount. So it's like reducing the asset's value each year, which affects the capital account (the balance sheet) by lowering the asset's value.

Wait, but the options don't have H as the correct amount. Let me double-check. The machine's cost is $1M, scrap is $100k, life 10 years. So $900k depreciable. Divided by 10 gives $90k per year. So yes, H is correct.
</think>

The correct depreciation amount per year using the straight-line method is calculated as:

\[
\text{Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Scrap Value}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{1,000,000 - 100,000}{10} = 90,000 \text{ dollars per year}.
\]

**Answer: H**
