Okay, I've got this question about estimating the total rainfall for three months. Let me see. The rainfall for the last three months are 8.1, 4.2, and 0.33 inches. I need to add them up and round to the nearest whole number. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, I'll add the three numbers step by step. Starting with 8.1 and 4.2. Adding those together: 8.1 + 4.2 equals 12.3 inches. Then I add the third month, which is 0.33 inches. So 12.3 plus 0.33 is ... let's see, 12.3 + 0.3 is 12.6, and then +0.03 makes 12.63 inches. So the total rainfall is 12.63 inches.

Now, I have to round this to the nearest whole number. The rule is that if the decimal part is 0.5 or higher, you round up. Here, 0.63 is more than 0.5, so I round up. That makes it 13 inches. Looking at the options, option A is 13 in. So the correct answer should be A.

To estimate the total rainfall by rounding to the nearest whole number:

1. **Add the rainfall amounts:** 8.1 + 4.2 + 0.33 = **12.63 inches**.
2. **Round to the nearest whole number:** 12.63 rounds up to **13 inches**.
3. **Select the option:** **A: 13 in.**
