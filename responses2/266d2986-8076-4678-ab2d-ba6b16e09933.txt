Question:

Match Co. manufactures a product with the following costs per unit based on a maximum plant capacity of 400000 units per year: Direct materials $ 60 Direct labor 10 Variable overhead 40 Fixed overhead 30 Total $140 Match has a ready market for all 400000 units at a selling price of $200 each. Selling costs in this market consist of $10 per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50000 per year. Reno Co. wishes to buy 5000 of these units on a special order. There would be no shipping costs on this special order. What is the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno?

Options:

A: $160
B: $110
C: $190
D: $180
E: $230
F: 200
G: $240
H: $220
I: $210
J: $140

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Match Co. and a special order from Reno Co. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, Match Co. produces a product with a unit cost. Let me jot that down. Direct materials are $60, direct labor is $10, variable overhead is $40, and fixed overhead is $30. Adding those up, that makes $140 per unit. The maximum capacity is 400,000 units per year.

The question says that all 400,000 units have a market price of $200 each, but they're not in a "ready market" — actually, it says they have a ready market, but wait, maybe I misread. Oh no, it says the selling price is $200 each, and the "ready market" — wait, perhaps "ready market" refers to if the unit is sold in the normal market, but the company is considering a special order. Hmm, maybe I should look again.

Wait, the problem states: "Selling costs in this market consist of $10 per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year." So for the regular selling, they have to pay $10 shipping each unit and a fixed fee. So the total selling cost is $10 per unit plus $50k annually.

But the question is about a special order from Reno Co. For this order, there are no shipping costs. So if they take the order, they don't have to pay $10 per unit anymore. So the variable costs for the special order would only include the fixed overhead, I suppose.

Wait, no. No, the fixed overhead is for the entire production run, not per unit. So for the special order, the variable costs would be for the 5000 units. Let's think about the costs involved.

We need to decide the lowest price the company is willing to sell to Reno. That would be the minimum price where the company breaks even on the special order.

So, for the special order, the company is selling 5000 units. The cost structure for each of these units is:

- Direct materials: $60
- Direct labor: $10
- Variable overhead: $40
- Fixed overhead: Hmm, but for fixed overhead, let's see. The company's fixed overhead is $30 per unit. But for the special order, they won't produce as much as the maximum capacity. Wait, no—wait, no, the capacity is 400,000 units, but the special order is 5000 units, which is way less than capacity. So the fixed overhead per unit in this case would be zero because they aren't producing all the units. So the fixed overhead for the special order is zero.

Wait, but actually, fixed overhead is a total fixed cost. So whether they make more or less, their fixed overhead is the same. So for the special order, the fixed overhead isn't affected. So the cost per unit for the special order would be the sum of the variable costs.

Wait, no, the variable overhead is $40 per unit, which is variable, so that's separate from fixed overhead. So for each unit in the special order, variable costs are $60 + $10 + $40 = $110. And there are no shipping costs, so that's zero.

So the total variable cost per unit is $110. But wait, the question is about the price per unit the company should be willing to sell. That's the break-even point. So the company's variable cost per unit is $110. So they should at least sell at that price to break even on the special order. If they can sell below that, they can make a loss, but since the question is about the lowest price they should be willing to sell to make no profit, it's the variable cost.

Wait, but wait, the company's fixed overhead is $30 per unit. Oh no, no, wait. Let me clarify. Fixed overhead is a total cost. So the fixed cost per unit depends on how many units are produced. If they make 5000 units, the fixed overhead is 5000 units * $30. But the company's fixed overhead is $30 per unit. So if the company is making 5000 units for the special order, their fixed overhead is already $30 per unit, but that's a total of 5000*30 = $150,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The company's fixed overhead is $30 per unit, but that's a per-unit cost. So for any level of production, fixed costs are $30 per unit times the number of units. So for 5000 units, it's 5000 * 30 = $150,000 in fixed overhead.

Wait, but the question is about the special order. So when they take the special order, they're producing 5000 units, so their fixed overhead is $30 per unit * 5000 = $150,000. But that's already a cost that the company must cover for the special order. So the total cost for the special order would be variable costs (5000 * $110) plus fixed costs ($150,000).

Wait, but the variable cost is per unit, so 5000 * ($60 + $10 + $40) = 5000 * $110 = $550,000. Plus fixed overhead of 5000 * $30 = $150,000. So total cost is $700,000.

But the company is selling 5000 units. The revenue from the special order is 5000 * P, where P is the price per unit.

To break even, revenue should equal total costs.

So 5000 * P = $700,000.

So P = $700,000 / 5000 = $140 per unit.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option J is $140.

But wait, what about the fixed cost? If the company is already producing 5000 units, which may be part of their normal production, then the fixed overhead is already covered. So when they take the special order, they don't need to cover those fixed overhead. So their total cost is variable only.

So yes, the total cost is $550,000 + $150,000 = $700,000. So price per unit is 700k / 5k = $140.

So the lowest price they are willing to sell at is $140. So the correct answer would be option J.
</think>

To determine the lowest price per unit at which Match Co. should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno Co., we need to calculate the break-even price for the special order. 

### Key Information:
- **Direct materials:** $60
- **Direct labor:** $10
- **Variable overhead:** $40
- **Fixed overhead per unit:** $30
- **Special order units:** 5000
- **Shipping costs:** $10 per unit (no longer applicable for the special order)
- **Fixed overhead for the special order:** 5000 units × $30 = $150,000
- **Variable cost per unit for the special order:** $60 + $10 + $40 = $110
- **Total variable cost for 5000 units:** 5000 × $110 = $550,000
- **Total cost for the special order:** $550,000 (variable) + $150,000 (fixed) = $700,000

### Break-Even Price Calculation:
To break even, the total revenue from the special order must equal the total cost. Let \( P \) be the price per unit.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 5000 \times P
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$700,000
\]
\[
5000P = 700,000
\]
\[
P = \frac{700,000}{5000} = \$140
\]

Thus, the lowest price per unit at which Match Co. should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno Co. is **\$140**.
