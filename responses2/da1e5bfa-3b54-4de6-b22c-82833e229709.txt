Answer:

Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to estimate the sum of 711 and 497, and figure out which range it falls into. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that estimation usually involves rounding numbers to make the addition simpler. So, let's look at each number individually. 

Starting with 711. If I round this to the nearest hundred, that would be 700 because the tens and units place are 11, which is less than 50. So 711 is approximately 700.

Next, 497. Again, rounding to the nearest hundred. The tens place is 9, and the units are 7, which makes it more than 50, so I round up. That would make 497 approximately 500.

Now, adding these rounded numbers together: 700 plus 500 equals 1,200. So the estimated sum is around 1,200.

But wait, the question is about which range the sum is between. So I need to look at the options provided. Let me list them out:

A: 2,000 and 2,200 → That's way too high because 700 + 500 is 1,200.
B: 50 and 400 → Nope, way too low.
C: 750 and 1,000 → Hmm, 1,200 is between 750 and 1,000, so this seems possible.
D: 1,500 and 1,700 → No, 1,200 is lower than 1,500.
E: 450 and 700 → Too low.
F: 400 and 650 → No.
G: 1,300 and 1,500 → 1,200 is within this range.
H: 500 and 750 → No.
I: 1,700 and 1,900 → No.
J: 1,050 and 1,300 → No.

Wait, so both C and G are within the estimated 1,200 range. Let me check the options again. Oh, the options are separate ranges. So the sum is between 750 and 1,000 (C) or 1,300 and 1,500 (G). Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact sum first and see. Let me compute 711 + 497.

Adding 711 and 497: 700 + 400 is 1100, 11 + 97 is 108. So 1100 + 108 = 1208. So the exact sum is 1,208.

Now, looking back at the options, the ranges are:

A: 2,000–2,200 → No.
B: 50–400 → No.
C: 750–1,000 → 1,208 is within 750 to 1,000.
D: 1,500–1,700 → No.
E: 450–700 → No.
F: 400–650 → No.
G: 1,300–1,500 → 1,208 is in this range as well.
H: 500–750 → No.
I: 1,700–1,900 → No.
J: 1,050–1,300 → No.

So both C and G have 1,208 in their ranges. But looking at the options, each option is a separate choice. So the question says "the sum is between which numbers?" and the options are A to J, each specifying a range. So the correct answer would be the range that includes 1,208.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 750–1,000. Option G is 1,300–1,500. Both contain 1,208. So which one is the correct choice?

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial rounding. Maybe the options are set such that only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct range is the one that includes the exact sum of 1,208. So which ranges include 1,208?

Looking at the options:

Option C: 750–1000 → yes.
Option G: 1300–1500 → yes.

Wait, but the exact sum is 1,208. So both C and G are correct? But that can't be. The options are mutually exclusive, as each option is a single range. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating.

Wait, perhaps I should check my exact sum again. 711 + 497.

Let me add them digit by digit:

711
+497
= 1,208. Yes, that's correct.

So 1,208 is between 1,200 and 1,300. So looking at the options, the options that include 1,208 are C (750-1000) and G (1,300-1500). But wait, which one is correct?

Wait, but the options are structured as "The sum is between which numbers?" and each option is a single range. So perhaps I should check each option's lower and upper bounds.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check each option:

Option C: 750 <= sum <=1,000. Our sum is 1,208, which is within 750–1,000.

Option G: 1,300 <= sum <=1,500 → 1,208 is within 1,300–1,500.

So both options C and G are correct in terms of the sum being in their ranges.

Wait, but that can't be because the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the exact sum. 711 plus 497. Let me add them:

700 + 400 = 1,100.

11 + 97 = 108.

So 1,100 + 108 = 1,208.

Yes, that's correct. So 1,208 is within both C and G. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct range is the one that is the closest to the actual sum.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the initial estimation method. Because sometimes, when estimating, people might round each number to the nearest hundred, but perhaps in this case, they round each to the nearest hundred, which gives 700 and 500, adding to 1,200, which is within both C and G.

Wait, but the options are a list of ranges. So if the sum is exactly 1,208, which is between 1,200 and 1,300. So which options include 1,208?

Looking back, the options are:

A: 2,000–2,200 → No.

B: 50–400 → No.

C: 750–1,000 → Yes.

D: 1,500–1,700 → No.

E: 450–700 → No.

F: 400–650 → No.

G:1,300–1,500 → Yes.

H:500–750 → No.

I:1,700–1,900 → No.

J:1,050–1,300 → No.

So both C and G are correct, but that can't be because the options are exclusive. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, G, but I think in the options, only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: 750–1,000, but wait, 1,208 is higher than 1,000. So no, that's not correct.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the problem statement. The question says, "The sum is between which numbers?" So it's looking for the range that includes the actual sum. From our calculation, the sum is 1,208. Now, which option includes 1,208.

Looking at the options:

C: 750 to 1,000 → 1,208 is higher than 1,000, so no.

G: 1,300 to 1,500 → 1,208 is within that range.

Wait, but in that case, both C and G are correct? But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is C or G. Hmm, but the options don't have a choice that includes 1,208 in two ranges. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate 711 + 497.

711 + 497:

Adding 700 and 500 gives 1,200.

11 + 97 is 108.

So 1,200 + 108 = 1,308? Wait no, 700 + 500 is 1,200, 11 + 97 is 108, so 1,200 + 108 = 1,308? Wait that can't be right because 700 + 500 is 1,200, but 700 + 400 is 1,100, plus 97 would be 1,200 + 97=1,297? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me compute 711 + 497 again.

Wait, 711 + 497:

Let me add 711 + 497:

711 + 497 = 1,208.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as 700 + 400 = 1,100, 11 + 97 = 108, so 1,100 + 108 = 1,208. Yes, that's correct.

So 1,208 is the exact sum. Now, looking at the options:

Which option has 1,208 within its range.

Looking at the options:

C: 750–1,000 → 1,208 is above 1,000, so no.

G: 1,300–1,500 → 1,208 is within 1,300–1,500.

So the correct answer is either C or G. But since the options are exclusive, perhaps the correct choice is G.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 711 + 497.

711 + 497:

700 + 400 = 1,100.

11 + 97 = 108.

1,100 + 108 = 1,208. Yes.

So, 1,208 is between 1,200 and 1,300.

Looking at the options, the only options that include 1,208 are C and G. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is C: 750–1,000, but that's incorrect because 1,208 is above 1,000.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial estimation, perhaps. Let me try rounding each number to the nearest hundred.

711 is closer to 700 than 800, because 11 is less than 50.

497 is closer to 500, because 97 is more than 50.

So 700 + 500 = 1,200.

Our exact sum is 1,208, so it's about 8 more than 1,200. So 1,200 is in both C and G (since 1,200 is within G's lower bound of 1,300? No, wait 1,200 is less than 1,300. So 1,200 is between 1,200 and 1,300, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the options are not including the exact sum, so the closest option is C: 750–1,000, but that's incorrect, as the sum is 1,208.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct range is 1,300–1,500.

So, the correct answer would be option G: 1,300 and 1,500.

Wait, but then again, the sum is 1,208, which is within 1,300–1,500. So option G includes 1,208.

But why is option C also correct? That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the exact sum again.

Wait, 711 + 497 = ?

Let me compute 711 + 497:

711 + 400 = 1,111.

11 + 97 = 108.

1,111 + 108 = 1,219. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 711 + 497.

Adding 711 and 497.

711 + 400 is 1,111.

Then, add 97: 1,111 + 97 = 1,208.

Ah, that's correct. So the exact sum is 1,208.

So the sum is 1,208. Now, looking at the options again:

C: 750–1,000 → 1,208 is higher than 1,000 → no.

G:1,300–1,500 → 1,208 is within.

So the correct option is G:1,300–1,500.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C was correct, but now I'm getting option G as correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact sum calculation. Let me compute it again:

711 + 497.

Adding 711 and 497.

Let me add 711 + 497:

711 + 400 = 1,111.

1,111 + 97 = 1,208.

Yes, correct.

So the sum is 1,208.

Now, looking again at the options:

C: 750–1,000 → 1,208 is not in this range.

G:1,300–1,500 → 1,208 is within this.

So the correct answer should be option G.

But wait, perhaps I should look back at the options again. Let me list them again:

A: 2,000–2,200 → No.

B:50–400 → No.

C:750–1,000 → No.

D:1,500–1,700 → No.

E:450–700 → No.

F:400–650 → No.

G:1,300–1,500 → Yes.

H:500–750 → No.

I:1,700–1,900 → No.

J:1,050–1,300 → No.

So the only option that includes 1,208 is G:1,300–1,500.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C was correct, but that's wrong because 1,208 is higher than 1,000.

So the correct answer is G:1,300–1,500.

Wait, but why did I think option C was correct earlier? Because I thought the sum is 1,208, which is within 750–1,000. But that can't be right because 1,208 is higher than 1,000.

So the correct answer must be option G:1,300–1,500.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought option C was correct, but that's incorrect. So the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the options are presented as 'between which numbers', so if the sum is 1,208, then the correct option is the one that includes this value.

So let's see:

C: 750–1,000 → 1,208 is not included.

G:1,300–1,500 → 1,208 is included.

H:500–750 → No.

So the correct answer is G:1,300–1,500.
</think>

The correct answer is G: 1,300 and 1,500. 

Step-by-step explanation:

To estimate the sum of 711 and 497:

1. **Rounding each number to the nearest hundred:**
   - 711 is closer to 700 (since 11 < 50).
   - 497 is closer to 500 (since 97 ≥ 50).

2. **Adding the rounded numbers:**
   - 700 + 500 = 1,200.

3. **Confirming the exact sum:**
   - 711 + 497 = 1,208.

4. **Evaluating the options:**
   - Option G: 1,300–1,500 includes 1,208.

Thus, the correct answer is G.
