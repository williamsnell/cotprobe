Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is not a type of chili pepper. The options are A through J, each with a different name. Let me start by recalling what I know about chili peppers.

I remember that chili peppers come in various varieties. The most common ones are habanero, jalapeno, and serrano. There's also the pimiento peppers, which are the ones used in many dishes like salsa. Poinsettia is a type of azalea, not a chili pepper, I think. Then there's ghost pepper, which is another name for jalapeno. 

Wait, let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Cheyenne. I think Cheyenne is a specific type of chili pepper, maybe from the U.S. or another region. It's a type of habanero, so it's a chili pepper.

Option B: Habanero. Definitely a chili pepper, the most well-known.

Option C: Guajillo. Oh right, guajillo is a type of chili pepper, often used in dishes like guacamole. So that's a chili.

Option D: Ghost pepper. I'm pretty sure that's another name for jalapeno. So D is a type.

Option E: Serrano. That's a common variety, like piperon and piperon varieties.

Option F: Pimiento. Yes, pimiento peppers are the ones used in p Italian cuisine, like pimiento hot dogs.

Option G: Poinsettia. Wait, poinsettia is a Christmas flower, a type of azalea. It's not a chili pepper. So G is the one that's not a type of chili pepper.

Option H: Apache. Apache is another name for jalapeno, so H is a type.

Option I: Poblano. I recall that pabllo, or poblano, is a type of chili pepper, often used in Latin American cuisine.

Option J: Jalapero. Yes, Jalapero is the same as jalapeno, so J is a type.

So the options are A to J, and the ones that are types are A (Cheyenne), B (Habanero), C (Guajillo), D (Ghost Pepper), E (Serrano), F (Pimiento), I (Poblano), and J (Jalapero). The only one not listed as a type is G: Poinsettia. Therefore, the answer is G.
