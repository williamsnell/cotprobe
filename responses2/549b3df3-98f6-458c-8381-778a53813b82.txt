Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about fast-twitch fibres. Hmm, I remember that fast-twitch muscles are involved in rapid twitch movements, like in sprinting. Let me think about what I know about these fibres.

Fast-twitch fibres are found in fast-twitch muscles, which are also called "high-speed twitch muscles." I recall that these muscles are associated with high ATPase activity. Wait, ATPase activity is the enzyme activity that converts ATP into ADP, right? So high ATPase activity would mean the fibres are active in converting ATP into energy.

Now, mitochondria are the cellular organelles where most ATP production happens in animals. So if the fibres have a lot of mitochondria, that suggests they're using a lot of ATP. But wait, some fibres might have a high ATPase activity without necessarily having a lot of mitochondria, or vice versa.

I think fast-twitch muscles are known for their high ATPase activity. So if the question is about the characteristics of the fibres, I should look for a statement that says high ATPase activity. Let me look at the options.

Option A: large mitochondria and high ATPase. That seems plausible.

Option B: no mitochondria and high ATPase. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If ATPase is high, then mitochondria should be involved because ATP production is in mitochondria. So this might be wrong.

Option C: large mitochondria and low ATPase. The question says fast-twitch have high ATPase, so C is incorrect.

Option D: small mitochondria and high ATPase. Hmm, maybe. But I thought fast-twitch have a lot of mitochondria.

Wait, another angle. I remember that in fast-twitch muscles, the energy demand is high because of rapid movement. So the fibres have high ATPase activity because they're producing a lot of ATP quickly. But does this mean they have a lot of mitochondria?

Wait, no. High ATPase activity doesn't necessarily require a lot of mitochondria. Alternatively, if a muscle has high ATPase, it might have a lot of mitochondria since ATP production is high. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought. I think that in fast-twitch muscles, the ATP is being used for high energy demands, so the mitochondria are abundant. So the fibres have a lot of mitochondria, but do they have high ATPase activity? Yes, because that's why they're efficient in using ATP. So option A says "relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity." That sounds correct.

Let me check the other options. Option B is saying they have no mitochondria, which doesn't make sense. Option C is high ATPase but large mitochondria, which I don't think is correct. Option D says small mitochondria and high ATPase, so if they have a lot of ATP, that suggests they must have a lot of mitochondria.

Wait, another angle. I've heard that fast-twitch muscles have high ATPase activity because they're under constant high-energy demand. So they can't have a lot of ATP because they're using it all the time. So perhaps they have a high ATPase but not a lot of mitochondria? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Because high ATPase activity would mean they're producing a lot of ATP, but the question is about the characteristics of the fibres themselves, not the rate of ATP production. So if the fibres are high in ATPase activity, they must be producing a lot of ATP, which suggests they have a lot of mitochondria because that's where ATP is made.

So looking again at the options.

Option A: large mitochondria and high ATPase. That makes sense.

Option F: moderate number of mitochondria and low ATPase. No, because the question says high ATPase. So F can't be right.

Option G: large number and no ATPase. No, because the fibres do have high ATPase activity.

Option I: small number and high ATPase. That's the opposite of what I thought. So I don't think I would choose I.

Option J: small and moderate. No, because high ATPase.

So the correct answer should be A. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought. I remember that in fast-twitch muscles, the ATPase activity leads to high production of ATP, which is needed for the high energy demands. So they have a lot of mitochondria, and the ATP is generated efficiently. So if the question is about the characteristics of the fibres (their ATPase activity and mitochondria), the correct statement is that they have a relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity. So option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I've heard that some fast-twitch muscles are larger than others. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up with another muscle type.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option B. No, because high ATPase activity doesn't imply no mitochondria. Wait, another point: I think that fast-twitch muscles have high ATPase activity, and they also have a lot of mitochondria. So option A is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Fast-twitch fibres are associated with high ATPase activity, which indicates a significant production of ATP. ATP production occurs in mitochondria, so these fibres likely have a large number of mitochondria. High ATPase activity is associated with rapid energy demands, such as those found in fast-twitch muscles. Therefore, the correct description of fast-twitch fibres is that they contain a relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.

Option A correctly states this. Other options are incorrect because they either suggest no mitochondria (B, F, G) or low ATPase activity (C, I, J), which contradicts the known characteristics of fast-twitch fibres. Option D suggests a small number of mitochondria, which is inconsistent with their high energy demands. Similarly, other options either describe ATPase activity incorrectly or do not align with the characteristics of fast-twitch muscles.

Answer: A
