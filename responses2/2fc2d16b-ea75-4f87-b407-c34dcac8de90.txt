Okay, so I have to figure out the answer to this question about what percentage of India's GDP agriculture contributed in 2015. Let's see, I remember that India has a diverse economy with agriculture being a big part. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage. Let me think.

I know that the GDP of India is quite large, around Rs 37,000 crore as of 2020, but I'm not certain about the exact figures for 2015. The question gives me options ranging from 64% down to 16%. I need to recall what I learned in school or maybe some reports about India's economy.

Wait, I think agriculture was significant, but not the largest part. Maybe around 40%? Or perhaps 50%? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to remember some key points. I remember that the main agricultural sectors in India are wheat, cashew, and jowar. These are the major crops and industrial crops. Maybe their combined output contributed a large portion.

I think in 2015, the agriculture sector was about 40% of the GDP. That would point to option C. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the agricultural sector was around 50% in some years, but I'm not certain if that's accurate for 2015 specifically.

Another angle: I remember that the country's economy was growing rapidly, and agriculture was a key driver. So maybe the percentage was higher than 30% but not as high as 60%. Looking at the options, 40% (C) and 50% (F) are both high. 

Wait, I think in 2015, the agricultural sector's GDP was about 40%. Let me think about other data points. I know that the total GDP was around 37,000 crores in 2020, but maybe that's just the current estimate. For 2015, the actual numbers might have been slightly different.

I also recall that the agriculture sector was contributing to a significant portion, and if I think about the growth in agriculture from 2015 to now, it might have been a major part. So, perhaps 40% was correct. Alternatively, if I'm mixing up with other sectors, like the manufacturing sector or services, I might be wrong.

Alternatively, I think I've heard that in 2015, the agriculture sector was about 50% of GDP. But I'm not sure. Let me try to look at some other sources or remember if any specific percentages are commonly cited. I think in 2015, the agriculture component of GDP was approximately 40%. So option C would be correct.
