Okay, so I've got this question here about bond valuation. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned in finance. The question is about a security with a maturity value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and it's due next year. The yield is 9%, and I need to find out what I should be willing to pay for it.

Wait, so the security is due next year, so it's a zero-coupon bond, right? Because it's maturing in one year. Unlike a typical bond that pays interest periodically, this one is just a single payment at maturity. So the price calculation for a zero-coupon bond is straightforward. I think the formula for the price (P) is the present value of the face value (FV) at the given yield rate.

The formula is P = FV / (1 + r), where r is the yield. Oh wait, but wait! Since it's due next year, the yield is for one year. So the time period is one year, so the denominator is 1 + 0.09, which is 1.09.

So plugging in the numbers, FV is $100,000. So P = 100,000 / 1.09. Let me calculate that. 100,000 divided by 1.09. Hmm, what's 100,000 divided by roughly 1.1? Oh, 100,000 /1.1 is about 90,909. But 1.09 is a bit less than 1.1, so the result should be a bit higher than 91,000. Let me calculate it exactly.

Wait, 1.09 times 91,743 is about 100,000. Let me do the division properly. 100,000 ÷ 1.09. Let me compute that. 1.09 * 91,743.12 is approximately 100,000. So the exact value is approximately $91,743.12. Wait, but I don't see this option exactly. Let's look back at the options.

Options: A is 97,250; B is 96,330.28; C is 105,000; D is 101,000; E is 100,000; F is 94,175.23; G is 99,000; H is 98,000; I is 103,500; J is 92,500.

Wait, none of these options are around $91,743. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. Oh wait, perhaps I misread the question. Oh, wait, the coupon rate is 5%, but that's the annual rate. But the question is about the price when it's due next year. So the coupon is paid at the end of the year, and the yield is for the same period.

Wait, but wait the formula for a zero-coupon bond is the present value of the face value, which is FV/(1 + r). So 100,000/(1.09) is about 91,743, but the options don't have that. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Another possibility: does the question consider the coupon as part of the price? No, because it's a zero-coupon bond. The coupon is just a payment at the end of the year.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the coupon is 5% of the face value, which is $5,000. But that's paid at the end of the year. But the question is about the price, which is just the present value of the $100,000. So the coupon doesn't add to the price, it's just a payment. So the only thing to discount is the $100,000.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when bonds have coupons and are not zero-coupon, the price is more complicated, but in this case, it's not. So my initial calculation seems correct. So the price is 100,000 / 1.09 ≈ 91,743.12. But none of the options match this. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option F is 94,175.23, which is higher than what I calculated. Option G is 99,000. H is 98,000. Option D is 101,000, which is higher than our calculation. Option B is 96,330.28, which is also higher than my calculation.

Wait, did I misinterpret the yield? Oh wait, the yield is 9%, but the bond is due next year. So the time to maturity is one year. So the discount factor is 1/(1 + 0.09) = 0.9174. So 100,000 * 0.9174 = 91,740.

Wait, but I don't see this exact number in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the coupon rate, but since it's a zero-coupon, the coupon is zero. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the yield is not 9% but the effective rate. Oh wait, no, the yield is given as 9% for the security. So I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the division. Let me compute 100,000 ÷ 1.09 using a calculator. 1.09 times 91,743.12 is 100,000. So the exact value is approximately $91,743.12. But the options don't have this. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait another thought: maybe the question is asking for the total of the coupon plus the present value of the face value. But wait, no, because the coupon is paid at the end of year one. So the total cash flow is 5,000 + 100,000. But that's for a bond with a coupon. Wait, no, the question is about the price, which is the present value of the cash flows. So the present value is just the face value divided by (1 + r), as I thought earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The question says the security is due next year, so it's a one-year maturity. The yield is 9%, so the present value is 100,000 / 1.09, which is about 91,743. But looking at the options, none of them match. So perhaps I'm wrong about the calculation.

Wait, is the yield an annual yield, or is it a yield to maturity? No, because the bond is only maturing in one year. So the present value is just 100,000/(1+0.09) = 91,743.12, but that's not an option. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the coupon rate is 5%, but it's a coupon bond paying interest, but since it's not a coupon paying bond but a zero-coupon, maybe the price is just the face value minus the coupon payment plus the present value. But in this case, the coupon is 5,000, which is received at the end of the year, so the present value is 5,000/(1.09) plus 100,000/(1.09). So the total price would be 5,000/1.09 + 100,000/1.09 = (105,000)/1.09 ≈ 96,330.28. Wait, that's option B.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the coupon is paid, then the price is the present value of the coupon plus the present value of the face value. So the total price would be the current value of the coupon plus the current value of the face value.

So the present value of the coupon: 5,000 / 1.09 ≈ 4,587.16.

The present value of the face value: 100,000 / 1.09 ≈ 91,743.12.

Adding those gives 4,587.16 + 91,743.12 = 96,330.28, which is option B.

Wait, but the question states that the security is due next year. So the coupon is paid at the end of the year, and the yield is 9% for one year. So the correct approach is to calculate the present value of the coupon plus the present value of the face value.

But wait, that's incorrect because the coupon is already part of the bond's cash flows. So for a zero-coupon bond, the price is simply the present value of the face value. The coupon is just a payment that you receive at the end of the year, so it's part of the cash flow, but the price is the present value of all cash flows.

Wait, no, the price is the present value of all the cash flows. So for a zero-coupon bond, the price is the present value of the face value. But if the bond is also paying a coupon, then the price would be the present value of the coupon plus the present value of the face value. But in this question, the bond is due next year and has a coupon rate of 5%—does that mean it's a coupon bond paying 5% annually, or is it a zero-coupon bond?

Wait, the question says it's a security with a maturity value of $100,000 and a coupon rate of 5%. But the security is due next year, so it's a zero-coupon bond. Therefore, it's only paying the face value at maturity. So the price is the present value of $100,000 at 9% per annum for one year. But then why are the options not matching that?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's read the question again. The security is due next year. So it's a zero-coupon bond. So the cash flows are a single payment of $100,000 at time t=1. The yield is 9%. So the price is 100,000 / (1 + 0.09) = 91,743.12. But in the options, that's not present. So perhaps the question is considering the coupon as part of the cash flow, which would make the price higher.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the question is considering that the coupon is paid at the end of the year, so the price is the present value of the coupon plus the present value of the face value. So that would be 5,000 / 1.09 + 100,000 / 1.09 = 105,000 / 1.09 ≈ 96,330.28. Which is option B.

Oh, I see. So the confusion arises because the question is a bit ambiguous. But the way it's phrased, "it is due next year," suggests it's a zero-coupon bond. But if the question is considering that the bond is a coupon bond (with a 5% coupon), then the price would be the present value of the coupon plus the present value of the face value. So the total price would be the sum of the two present values.

So let me clarify: in a coupon bond, the price is calculated as the present value of all future coupon payments plus the present value of the face value. But in this case, if the bond is due next year and it's a zero-coupon, then the price is simply the present value of the face value, not including the coupon.

But the question says the coupon rate is 5%, which implies that the bond is a coupon bond. So the price would include the coupon. So the price would be the present value of the coupon (5,000 / 1.09) plus the present value of the face value (100,000 / 1.09).

Wait, wait. So the correct calculation is:

Price = (5,000 / 1.09) + (100,000 / 1.09) = (105,000) / 1.09 ≈ 96,330.28, which is option B.

But the question says the security is due next year and the yield is 9%. So the yield is on the security, and the cash flows are the coupon (if it's a coupon bond) or the face value (if it's a zero-coupon). So if it's a coupon bond, the price should include both the coupon and the face value's present value. So the correct price would be 96,330.28, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's a zero-coupon, but perhaps the question is implying that it's a coupon bond. So, the answer would be option B.

Wait, but the security's yield is 9%, which is the same as the coupon rate? Or is it the yield to maturity? Wait, the yield is 9%, which is for the entire maturity period. So for a coupon bond, the yield to maturity is the rate that equates the present value of the cash flows to the price.

In this case, since the security is a coupon bond paying 5% annually, the yield to maturity is 9%. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 5% is less than 9%. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the yield to maturity is the total return expected over the life of the bond. So if the bond is paying 5% annually, but the yield is 9% for one year, that would mean the present value of the coupon payment is 5,000 / 1.09 = approx 4,586. So the total present value of the bond is 4,586 + 100,000 /1.09 = 4,586 + 91,743 = 96,329, which is approximately 96,330.28, which is option B.

So the correct answer would be option B.
</think>

To determine the price of the security, we analyze the question and the options provided. The security has a maturity value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a yield of 9%, with the security maturing next year. This suggests that the security is a zero-coupon bond, meaning it pays only the face value at maturity and does not include any coupon payments. However, the question also mentions a coupon rate of 5%, which implies that the bond might be a coupon bond. Despite this ambiguity, the yield of 9% and the maturity of the bond suggest that the correct approach is to calculate the present value of the face value at the yield rate.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Zero-Coupon Bond**:  
   The price is the present value of the face value:  
   \[
   \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Face Value}}{1 + \text{Yield}} = \frac{100,000}{1.09} \approx 91,743.12
   \]  
   However, this value is not among the options provided.

2. **Coupon Bond**:  
   The security may be a coupon bond paying 5% annually. In this case, the price is the present value of the coupon payment plus the present value of the face value:  
   \[
   \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Coupon Payment}}{1 + \text{Yield}} + \frac{\text{Face Value}}{1 + \text{Yield}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Price} = \frac{5,000}{1.09} + \frac{100,000}{1.09} = \frac{105,000}{1.09} \approx 96,330.28
   \]  
   This matches option B.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in the question, the most reasonable interpretation is that the security is a coupon bond with a 5% annual coupon rate. The correct price, based on the present value of the coupon and face value, is approximately $96,330.28.
