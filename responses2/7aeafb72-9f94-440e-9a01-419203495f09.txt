Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the mean, median, and mode of a set of numbers. Let me think through each step carefully to make sure I get it right.

The numbers given are 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, and 9. There are six numbers in total. The question is asking me to compute the mean, median, and mode, and then pick the correct option from A to J.

First, let's recall what each of these terms means.

The mean is the average. To find it, I add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. So, let me add them up: 3 +5 is 8, plus 6 is 14, another 6 makes 20, then 7 is 27, and finally 9 brings it to 36. Wait, wait, let me do that again. Oh wait, 3 +5 is 8, 8+6 is 14, 14+6 is 20, 20+7 is 27, and 27+9 is 36. So, the sum is 36. There are six numbers, so the mean is 36 divided by 6, which is 6. So the mean is 6.

Next, the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are six numbers, which is even, the median will be the average of the third and fourth numbers. Let me arrange them in order, which they already are: 3,5,6,6,7,9.

The third number is 6, the fourth is also 6. So the median is (6+6)/2 = 6. So the median is 6.

Now, the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the list: 3 appears once, 5 once, 6 appears twice, 7 once, 9 once. So the number that appears the most is 6, which occurs twice. So the mode is 6.

Wait, let me double-check that. Are there any other numbers that might be modes? No, because 6 is the only one that repeats. So the mode is 6.

Now, let's look at the options. Option D says Mean:6, Median:6, Mode:6. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the mean.

3 +5=8, +6=14, +6=20, +7=27, +9=36. Yes, 36 divided by 6 is 6. So mean is 6.

Median: the third and fourth numbers are both 6, so median is 6. Mode is 6.

Looking at the options, D's values match exactly. So the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: Mean: 6, Median: 6, Mode: 6.

Answer: D
