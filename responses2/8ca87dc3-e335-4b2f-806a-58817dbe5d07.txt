Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Faradays and calculating the atomic weight of calcium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that 0.0324 Faradays liberated 0.651 grams of calcium. I need to find the atomic weight of calcium. Wait, Faraday's laws of electrolysis... Oh right, Faraday's constant is involved here. Faraday's constant, F, is the amount of charge required to transfer one mole of electrons. I remember it's around 96485 coulombs per mole, but I'm not sure about the exact value.

So the formula I think is something like m = (M * Q) / F, where m is the mass, M is the molar mass (which is the atomic weight we're looking for), Q is the charge, and F is Faraday's constant. Let me write that down: m = (M * Q) / F.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Oh wait, right, the general formula for electrolysis is m = (M * Q) / F. Since the charge (Q) is in coulombs and Faraday's constant is coulombs per mole of electrons, this should work.

But wait, I need to find M. So rearranging the formula: M = (m * F) / Q.

Wait, but what's Q here? The charge per mole of electrons. Oh right, the equivalent weight. Because the equivalent weight is the mass of a substance that will lose or gain one mole of electrons. So for a metal, like calcium, which is +2, the equivalent weight is its molar mass divided by 2.

So Q would be the equivalent weight. So Q = M / n, where n is the number of electrons per ion. For calcium, n is 2. So Q = M / 2.

Wait, but let's make sure. In electrolysis, the charge required per mole is F * n. So for each mole of electrons, you go through F coulombs. So the charge (Q) per mole of electrons is F * n.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For every mole of electrons (n=1), the charge is F. So for n moles, it's nF. So the charge per mole of electrons is nF.

Wait, no. No, wait. The charge per mole of electrons would be F * n. Because each mole of electrons has n moles of electrons. So for each mole of electrons, the charge is nF.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of how much charge is required to deposit one mole of the metal.

Alternatively, another approach: the amount of electricity (charge Q) required to deposit a mass m of a substance is given by Q = (m * F) / n, where n is the valency (number of electrons per ion).

Wait, so to find the mass m, it's m = (Q * n) / F.

Hmm, maybe I should clarify this. The formula for the amount of substance is n = (Q * n) / (M * F), but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, I think the correct formula is m = (M * Q) / F. Because m = (Q * M) / F, where Q is the total charge in coulombs, M is molar mass (g/mol), and F is coulombs per mole of electrons. That makes sense.

So given m = 0.651g, F = 96485 C/mol, we need to find M.

But I don't know the value of Q yet. So I need to find the charge per mole of electrons.

Wait, the problem gives the Faraday's constant as 0.0324 Faradays. Wait, wait. Faraday's law states that the amount of substance liberated is directly proportional to the amount of electricity (charge) passed. The formula is Q = n * F * m, where m is the mass of the substance, n is the number of electrons per ion (valency), F is Faraday's constant, and Q is the charge in coulombs.

Wait, but wait. I think the correct formula is that the amount of substance (m) is (Q) / (nF), because Q is the charge, n is the number of electrons, F is Faraday's constant (C/mol). So m = Q / (nF).

Wait, but I thought earlier that m = (M * Q) / F, which would be m = (M * Q) / F. So solving for M, M = (m * F) / Q.

But I don't know Q. Hmm. Alternatively, since the charge is Q = n * F * (m/M), that's rearranged as m = (Q * M) / (nF).

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's see. Since the problem gives the Faraday's constant in terms of Faradays. Oh wait, wait. The question says 0.0324 Faradays. Oh wait, Faraday's constant is in C/mol. So 1 Faraday is 96485 C per mole.

So Faraday's constant F is 96485 C/mol. So perhaps I can calculate Q, which is the total charge in coulombs, by multiplying Faraday's value by the number of Faradays.

Wait, the question states 0.0324 Faradays. Oh that's a small number, so the charge might be small. Wait, but let me think. Faraday's law is Q = n * F * m, where m is in grams, n is the number of moles of electrons, and F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol). So Q is in coulombs.

Wait, but the problem states that 0.0324 Faraday liberated a certain mass. So 0.0324 F is the amount of charge. So Q = 0.0324 F * 96485 C/F. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 0.0324 * 96485. Let me compute 96485 * 0.03 = 2894.55, 96485 * 0.0024 = let's see. 96485 * 0.002 = 192.97, 0.0004 *96485= 38.594. So total 192.97 +38.594 = 231.564. So total Q is 2894.55 +231.564 = 3126.114 coulombs.

Wait, that's about 3126 C. But wait, Faraday's law is Q = n * F * m. So m is in grams. How do I get M from this?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equation again. The formula to calculate the mass is m = (n * F * m) / M, but that's not making much sense. Alternatively, rearranging m = (n * Q) / F. Because m = (n * (F * Q /n )) / F) ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the amount of charge (Q) in terms of Faraday's.

If 1 Faraday is 96485 C, then 0.0324 Faraday is 0.0324 * 96485 C. Let me calculate that: 0.0324 * 96485 = ?

Well, 0.03 *96485 = 2894.55 C.

0.0024 *96485 = ?

96485 *0.002 = 192.97.

96485 *0.0004 = 38.594.

So 0.0024 *96485 = 192.97 +38.594 = 231.564.

So total Q = 2894.55 +231.564 = 3126.114 C.

Now, the mass m is 0.651 grams. So using the formula m = (n * Q) / F.

Wait, but wait, n is the number of moles of electrons. For calcium, which is +2, n=2.

Wait, so m = (n * Q) / F. So m = (2 * 3126.114) / 96485.

Let me compute that. 2 *3126.114= 6252.228.

Divide by 96485: 6252.228 /96485 ≈ 0.0647 grams? But the given mass is 0.651 grams. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the formula again. The correct formula is m = (M * Q) / F, where M is molar mass, Q is charge, F is Faraday.

Wait, but in this case, I don't know M. Let's see. Because m = (M * Q) / F, so M = (m * F) / Q.

So, M = (0.651 g * 96485 C/mol) / Q.

But Q is the charge (n * F) * (m/M), but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of grams per faraday.

Wait, for each faraday (F), 1 faraday is 1 mole of electrons, which corresponds to a mass of M/2 grams (since for Ca, each Ca²+ ion has 2 electrons, so 2 moles of electrons per mole of Ca).

So, the mass (m) liberated is M / (2) * F.

Wait, that seems right. Because for each mole of Ca²+ ions, you need 2 moles of electrons (each Ca²+ has 2+ charge, so 2 electrons per ion). So the charge per mole of Ca is 2 F.

So the formula for the mass would be m = (M * 2) / F.

Wait, no, wait. Because F is 96485 C/mol. So per mole of Ca, the charge is 2 * F. So for m grams of Ca, the charge required is (2F) * (m/M) moles. Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the formula is m = (M * Q) / F, where Q is the total charge in coulombs.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let me think about Faraday's constant and the given values.

We have Q = 0.0324 F * 96485 C/F = 0.0324 *96485 = let's compute that.

0.03 *96485 = 2894.55 C.

0.0024 *96485= 231.564 C.

So Q = 2894.55 +231.564 = 3126.114 C.

So, the charge is 3126.114 C.

Now, the mass m is 0.651 grams. So per mole, the mass is M grams. So the moles are 0.651 / M.

But then, the charge needed is Q = n * F * (moles of substance). Wait, n is the number of moles of electrons, which for Ca is 2 (since each Ca²+ has 2 electrons). So n=2.

So Q = n * F * (moles of substance).

But moles of substance is 0.651 / M.

So, substituting:

3126.114 C = 2 *96485 C/mol * (0.651 / M)

Simplify:

3126.114 = (192970) * (0.651 / M)

Divide both sides by 192970:

(3126.114) / 192970 = 0.651 / M

Compute 3126.114 /192970 ≈ 0.01623.

So: 0.01623 = 0.651 / M.

Then M = 0.651 / 0.01623 ≈ 40.2 grams per mole.

Wait, that's interesting because 40.2 is option B.

So the atomic weight of calcium is approximately 40.2 g/mol.
</think>

To determine the atomic weight of calcium, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis and the given data:

1. **Given Data**:  
   - Faraday's constant, \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \)  
   - Charge, \( Q = 0.0324 \, \text{Faradays} \)  
   - Mass of calcium, \( m = 0.651 \, \text{g} \)  
   - For calcium, \( n = 2 \) (since \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) requires 2 electrons per ion).  

2. **Relationship Between Variables**:  
   The formula for the mass of a substance liberated is:  
   \[
   m = \frac{M \cdot Q}{F}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( M \):  
   \[
   M = \frac{m \cdot F}{Q}
   \]  

3. **Calculate \( Q \)**:  
   Since \( Q = n \cdot F \),  
   \[
   Q = 2 \cdot 96485 = 192970 \, \text{C/mol}.
   \]  

4. **Substitute Values into the Formula**:  
   \[
   M = \frac{0.651 \cdot 96485}{192970}.
   \]  
   First, calculate the numerator:  
   \[
   0.651 \cdot 96485 = 6252.2285 \, \text{C}.
   \]  
   Then divide by \( Q \):  
   \[
   M = \frac{6252.2285}{192970} \approx 0.0324 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  

5. **Final Calculation**:  
   \[
   M = \frac{0.651}{0.01623} \approx 40.2 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  

Thus, the atomic weight of calcium is approximately **40.2 g/mol**, which corresponds to option **B**.
