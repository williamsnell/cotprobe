Okay, so I've got this question here about predicting the number of votes candidate A would get based on a survey. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that a survey of 1000 registered voters found that 450 would vote for candidate A. So, that's the data we have from the survey. Now, they want to know how many votes this survey takers would predict candidate A would get if 220,000 people vote in the election. 

Wait, so the survey is about 1000 voters, and in that group, 450 support candidate A. So, the first thing I think is that this is a proportion problem. Maybe it's a percentage calculation. Let me see.

Let's calculate the percentage of the survey that supports candidate A. So, 450 out of 1000. To find the percentage, I divide 450 by 1000. 450 divided by 1000 is 0.45. So, 45%. That means the survey predicts that 45% of the voters will choose candidate A.

Now, the total number of voters in the election is 220,000. So, to find out how many votes candidate A would get, I need to calculate 45% of 220,000. 

Hmm, how do I compute that? Well, 45% is the same as 0.45 in decimal form. So, I multiply 0.45 by 220,000. Let me do that calculation.

Let me write it out: 0.45 * 220,000. Let's break it down. 220,000 * 0.4 is 88,000. 220,000 * 0.05 is 11,000. Adding those together, 88,000 +11,000 equals 99,000. So, 99,000 votes would be the prediction.

Looking at the options, option C is 99,000. So, the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way is to set up a proportion. The ratio of survey voters to actual voters is 1000 to 220,000. So, 1000/220,000 = 450/x. Solving for x, which is the votes for candidate A. 

Wait, wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the ratios. Let's see. The proportion would be 450/1000 = x/220,000. So, solving for x: x = (450 * 220,000)/1000. That's 450 * 220,000 divided by 1000. 220,000 divided by 1000 is 220. So, 450 * 220. Let me calculate that: 450 * 200 is 90,000, and 450 * 20 is 9,000. Adding together, 90,000 +9,000 equals 99,000. Yep, same result. So, C is correct.

The survey indicates that 450 out of 1000 voters support candidate A. To estimate candidate A's votes in a total of 220,000 voters, calculate 45% of 220,000. This yields 99,000 votes.

Answer: C: 99,000
