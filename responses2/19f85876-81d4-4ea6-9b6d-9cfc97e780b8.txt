Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about what Berkeley thought about heat and cold. Hmm, I remember from my philosophy class that Berkeley was a key thinker in the Enlightenment. Let me think about his views on matter and energy.

The question asks what Berkeley insists about heat and cold. The options are A through J. I'll go through each one to figure out which is correct.

Option A says they're elements of nature that don't exist independently. Wait, Berkeley's view on matter was that it's not independent. He thought that matter is a kind of mind or a collection of mental states. So if matter is mind-like, maybe he thought heat and cold aren't real. But wait, I'm not sure about that. I think he believed they are real, though.

Option B: only things existing apart from our minds. That sounds like what he was against. He was critical of the idea that physical objects exist independently. He believed that things are mentally constructed.

Option C: only sensations existing in our minds. That sounds more in line with his view. He thought that physical objects don't have their own reality; they are merely mental constructs. So heat and cold, as physical properties, would be mind constructs. So C might be correct.

Option D: physical objects. But I'm pretty sure he didn't think they're physical or real. He rejected materialism.

Option E: manifestations of our subconscious. Maybe, but I think he was more about the brain's role in creating perceptions, not about the subconscious as a real entity.

Option F: only sensations outside our minds. Wait, that's opposite of C. If C is correct, F would be wrong.

Option G: not real unless observed. I'm not sure about this one. I think he believed in the mind's role in perception, not necessarily that things aren't real but that they're constructed.

Option H: illusions. I'm not sure about this either. I don't recall him specifically denying any illusions, though.

Option I: types of energy. No, that's more modern physics, not his view.

Option J: purely subjective and not measurable. I don't think he thought they were subjective; he was more about whether they are real.

So putting it together, if C says only sensations exist in our minds, that aligns with his belief that matter is a mental construct. So heat and cold, being physical properties, are mental constructs, so they're not real independently. So the answer should be C.

Berkeley believed that heat and cold are mental constructs rather than independent physical entities. This aligns with option C, which states that they are only sensations existing in our minds. 

Answer: C
