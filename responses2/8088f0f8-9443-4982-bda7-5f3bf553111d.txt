During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.
D: Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.
E: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.
F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.
G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.
H: No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the jury size.

Okay, so I've got this question about a federal diversity action and jury selection. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

So the scenario is a man suing a bus company, claiming he had an accident and sustained injuries. He wanted a jury trial. The man asked for a jury, and the parties' attorneys examined the potential jurors. They found six to be the right number. Then, during the trial, two jurors got sick and were replaced by alternate jurors. At the end, a third juror also got sick, and the court excused him. The attorneys stipulated to the five-person jury being returned a verdict. The jury had reached its verdict for the company. The man filed a motion for a new trial, saying that the five-person jury wasn't enough to reach a verdict. The question is whether the court should grant that motion.

Hmm. So, the key points are about the jury size and whether the man's motion was valid.

First, in federal civil procedure, the jury must be of a certain size. I remember that in the U.S., the federal civil procedure code, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1006, requires a jury of at least six members for civil procedure. So the company is using a jury of six.

Now, the initial selection was six jurors, which is the minimum. Then, two were replaced by alternate jurors. That leaves four new jurors plus the two alternates, making six again. Then, a third juror got sick, and the court excused him. So, the total number of remaining jurors is five.

Wait, the man's argument is that a five-person jury wasn't enough. But federal civil procedure requires at least six. So the court must have a six-person jury. If the jury is reduced to five, that's below the required size.

But wait, the man's attorney stipulated that a verdict would be returned from a five-person jury. So, the attorneys are saying they agreed to have a verdict with five people. But the court is still using a six-person jury, right? Because the initial selection was six, and then they had to replace some. But the man's motion is that the reduced jury size invalidated the verdict.

Wait, but the man's motion is about the size of the jury. The court needs to have a six-person jury. If the jury is five, that's too small. So the court is required to have at least six, right?

So the question is, can the court have a five-person jury for a federal civil procedure case? From what I remember, the federal civil procedure is designed to ensure that a jury of at least six is used. So, a five-person jury is not allowed. The court must use a six-person jury.

So if the man's attorney said that the verdict would be from a five-person jury, that's a violation of the federal procedures. The court must have a six-person jury. So even if the initial selection was six, but then someone got ill and wasn't present, the court still had to have a six-person jury to proceed. So the man's motion is correct because the court can't use a five-person jury. The correct answer would be E: Yes, because the court must have a six-person jury.

Wait, but let me double-check. The case is a federal diversity action, so it's civil procedure. The initial selection was six. Then, two were replaced by the alternates. Then, a third got sick and was excused. So, the number of jurors would have been six, then four + two alternates (so still six), then one less, so five. But the man's attorney said that the jury would be five. But the court has to have a six-person jury, so a five-person would mean the court's procedure is invalid.

So the court can't have a five-person jury. The man's motion is valid because the court must have a jury of at least six. So the answer is E: Yes, because the court must have a six-person jury.

Wait, but why would the man's motion be against the reduced jury size? Because federal procedure requires a six-person jury for a verdict. So the court must use a six-person jury. If they used a five-person, that's a problem.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E: Yes, because the court must have a six-person jury for a federal civil procedure case. The man's motion is valid as the court cannot use a five-person jury, which violates the federal civil procedure code requiring a jury of at least six members.

Answer: E
