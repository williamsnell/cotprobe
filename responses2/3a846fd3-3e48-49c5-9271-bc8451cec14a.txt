Okay, so I've got this question about Margaret Mead and her ideas on gender roles and adolescence. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that Margaret Mead was a big name in anthropological fields, especially in the study of gender and socialization. She co-wrote with Sewall commuters, right? They made some significant contributions. I think she talked a lot about how cultural norms and values influence young people, including adolescence.

Looking at the options, I need to pick which statement she suggested. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Cultural norms have no influence on adolescence and gender roles. Hmm, not sure. From what I remember, Mead did think that cultural norms do play a role. Like, they shape how people behave and develop their identities, including gender roles.

Option B: Gender roles in three New Guinea societies were identical and so must be biologically determined. Wait, no, I think Mead argued against this. She believed that gender roles were influenced by cultural contexts beyond biology, like social norms and values. So, these societies might not have had identical roles; instead, they were shaped by their unique cultural dynamics.

Option C: Anthro fieldwork is completely objective and unbiased. That doesn't sound right. Mead's fieldwork was highly subjective and controlled, not objective. She emphasized researcher bias, so this option is probably incorrect.

Option D: Fieldwork can be problematic because researcher values affect observations. Yes, that sounds familiar. Mead's work was known for being sensitive and controlling, so fieldwork can be tricky and might be biased. So this seems correct.

Option E: Gender roles are universally identical and biologically determined. No, I don't think she thought that. She believed that different societies have different gender roles based on their cultural and social structures.

Option F: Every society has the same adolescence experience. I don't think Mead agreed. She thought that the experience varied, especially due to cultural and social factors.

Option G: Adolescence and gender roles varied between societies, so they were culturally determined. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Mead suggested that these roles aren't predetermined biologically but are shaped by cultural norms and values.

Option H: No variations in gender roles and adolescence across cultures. That seems opposite of what Mead said, so probably incorrect.

Option I: USA is a time of relative calm compared to Japan and Europe. I'm not sure about this. Mead's work was more about how societies structure their youth, not their overall stability. Like, she saw the young in different countries as forming unique groups with their own structures, not necessarily a "calm" versus turmoil.

Option J: Adolescence is universally turmoil and confusion. That doesn't align with her views either. She thought it's a time of development and learning, not chaos.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be G, which says that roles varied between societies, so they were culturally determined.

The correct answer is G: adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined.

**Answer: G**
