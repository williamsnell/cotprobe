Question:

Susan reads a book at a rate of 1 page every 3 minutes. If her reading rate remains the same, which method could be used to determine the number of minutes for her to read 18 pages?

Options:

A: add 18 and 3
B: subtract 18 from 3, then multiply by 3
C: divide 18 by 3
D: add 18 and 3, then divide by 3
E: subtract 3 from 18
F: subtract 18 from 3
G: add 3 to 18
H: multiply 3 by 18
I: divide 3 by 18

Okay, so I've got this question here where Susan reads a book at a rate of 1 page every 3 minutes. The question is asking which method can determine how long it takes her to read 18 pages. The options are A to I, each with some mathematical operations.

Hmm, let me think. Susan's rate is 1 page per 3 minutes. So for each page, she takes 3 minutes. That makes sense. So if I have 18 pages, each taking 3 minutes, the total time should be 18 multiplied by 3. Oh wait, but let me look at the options.

Option C is to divide 18 by 3. Oh wait, wait. So 18 divided by 3 equals 6. So that would give 6 minutes. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 18 pages at 1 per 3 minutes would take 18 * 3 =54 minutes. So if I divide 18 by 3, I get 6, which is way too low. That can't be right. So option C is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units. Rate is pages per minute. So her rate is 1/3 pages per minute. Oh, wait, that's not correct. Wait, no. If she reads 1 page in 3 minutes, then her rate is 1/3 pages per minute. So to find total time for 18 pages, you take pages divided by rate. So 18 divided by (1/3) is 54. So the correct method is to divide 18 by (1/3), which is the same as multiplying 18 by 3. So the correct formula is 18 ÷ (1/3) = 54. But none of the options seem to directly express this.

Let me look at the options again. Option C is 18 divided by 3, which is 6. That's not correct. Option A is 18 +3, which is 21. No, that's adding, which doesn't make sense for a rate. Option B is subtracting 3 from 18, then multiplying by 3. So (18-3)*3 = 15*3=45. Not correct.

Option D is add 18 and 3, then divide by 3. So (18+3)/3=21/3=7. No, that's wrong. Option E is subtract 3 from 18. That would be 15, which again is wrong.

Option F is subtract 18 from 3, which is negative, so that's -15. Not relevant.

Option G is adding 3 to 18, giving 21. Not helpful.

Option H is multiplying 3 by 18, which is 54. That's the correct total time. Wait, but none of the options have "multiply 3 by 18" except option H. So option H would be correct, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: add 18 and 3 → 21

B: subtract 18 from 3, then multiply by 3 →15*3=45

C: divide 18 by 3 →6

D: add 18 and 3, then divide by 3 →7

E: subtract 3 from 18 →15

F: subtract 18 from 3 →-15

G: add 3 to 18 →21

H: multiply 3 by 18 →54

I: divide 3 by 18 →1/6

So option H is multiplying 3 by 18, which gives 54. That's correct because 18 pages at 3 minutes per page would take 54 minutes. So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, wait a second. Oh wait, no! Wait, I'm getting confused. Susan's rate is 1 page per 3 minutes. So for each page, it's 3 minutes. So 18 pages would take 18 *3=54 minutes. So yes, option H is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is the formula: time = pages * time_per_page. So pages is 18, time per page is 3 minutes. 18 *3=54.

So the correct method is to multiply 18 by 3, which is option H.
</think>

The correct method is to multiply the number of pages by the time per page, which is 18 pages multiplied by 3 minutes per page, resulting in 54 minutes. Therefore, the correct option is H.

Answer: H
