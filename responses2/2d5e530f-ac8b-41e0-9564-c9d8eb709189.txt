Okay, so I have this question here about calculating the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters from a PTC tasting ability test. Let's see... I remember that PTC stands for Pteranostichial Taster, but I'm not entirely sure how that fits into this problem. Anyway, the key details are that there were 146 students tested, with 105 being tasters and 41 non-tasters.

The question is asking for the frequencies of each. I think frequency in this context refers to the proportion of each group in the total sample. So, I need to calculate the percentage of tasters and non-tasters out of 146.

First, let's confirm the numbers. Tasters: 105, non-tasters: 41. Total students: 105 +41 = 146. That adds up correctly.

To find the frequency, I should divide each group by the total number of students and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage. Alternatively, I can express it as a decimal by dividing each number by the total.

Let me calculate for tasters first. 105 divided by 146. Hmm, let's do the division. 105 ÷ 146. Let me think: 146 goes into 105 zero times. So, 0. Then, adding a decimal point and a zero makes it 1050. How many times does 146 go into 1050?

Let's see, 146 * 7 is 1022. 146*7=1022. Subtract that from 1050: 1050-1022=28. Bring down another zero, making it 280. 146 goes into 280 once (146*1=146). Subtract: 280-146=134. Bring down another zero, making 1340. 146*9=1314. 1340-1314=26. Bring down another zero, making 260. 146*1=146. 260-146=114. Bring down another zero, making 1140. 146*7=1022. Subtract: 1140-1022=118. Bring down another zero, making 1180. 146*8=1168. 1180-1168=12. So, putting this all together, the division gives approximately 0.7246... So, about 0.7246, which is 72.46%.

Wait, but let's double-check that, maybe I messed up somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 105/146 using another method, like breaking it down. Let me think: 146 * 0.7 = 102.2. So 0.7 is 102.2, but 105 is 2.8 higher. So 0.7 + (2.8/146). 2.8 ÷146 ≈0.019. So 0.7 +0.019=0.719. So approximately 0.719, which is about 71.9%, which rounds to 0.72. 

Similarly, for non-tasters, 41 out of 146. Let's compute 41/146. Well, 41 is roughly a third of 146 (since 146 ÷3 is about 48.666). So 41 is a bit less, maybe 0.28. Let's compute 41 ÷ 146.

146 into 41.000. 146 goes into 410 two times (2*146=292). Subtract: 410-292=118. Bring down a zero, making 1180. 146*8=1168. Subtract: 1180-1168=12. Bring down another zero, 120. 146 goes once, subtract 146, get 120-146=-26, but that can't be. So perhaps 0.28 something.

Wait, let me try a different approach. 41/146. Let's simplify the fraction: 41 is a prime number, so can't be reduced. So, 41 ÷146. Alternatively, I can compute 41 ÷ 146 as (41/146) = (41 ÷ 41)/(146 ÷41) )=1/3.560... Wait, that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps think of 41 ÷146 as (41 ÷ 146) = approximately 0.28. Let's compute 146 × 0.28.

146 × 0.2 =29.2, 146 ×0.08=11.68. So total is 29.2 +11.68=40.88. So 0.28 gives 40.88, which is just a bit less than 41. So the actual value is a bit higher than 0.28. Let's compute 146 × 0.284 = ? Let me compute 146 ×0.28=40.88, and 146 ×0.004=0.584, so 0.284 is 40.88 +0.584=41.464. Oh, that's over 41. So 0.284 gives 41.464, which is 0.464 over. So we need 0.283.

Wait, but perhaps I should just compute 41 ÷146: 41 ÷146 = 0.2808 (approximately). So 0.2808, which is approximately 0.281, which is about 28.1%. So about 0.281.

So Tasters have a frequency of approximately 0.72 and non-tasters approximately 0.28. Looking at the options, let me see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

A: T 0.59, t 0.41 → T is much higher than 0.72. So no.

B: T 0.47, t 0.53 → T is lower than 0.72. So no.

C: T 0.72, t 0.28 → Yes, this matches our calculation.

D: T 0.50, t 0.50 → No, because T is 50%, which is less than 72%.

E: T 0.41, t 0.59 → T lower, t higher.

F: T 0.53 is about 53%, t would be 47%, no match.

G: T 0.28, t 0.72 → No, because T is lower than 0.72.

H: T 0.39, t 0.61 → T is 39%, which is way lower than 72%.

I: 0.35, 0.65 → No.

J: 0.61, 0.39 → No.

So, the correct option is C.

The correct calculation involves dividing the number of tasters (105) and non-tasters (41) by the total number of participants (146). 

- Tasters: 105 / 146 ≈ 0.7246 (approximately 0.72)
- Non-tasters: 41 / 146 ≈ 0.2808 (approximately 0.28)

Thus, the frequencies are approximately 0.72 for tasters and 0.28 for non-tasters. The correct option is C.
