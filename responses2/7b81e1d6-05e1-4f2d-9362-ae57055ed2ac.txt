Options:

A: 103 students
B: 50 students
C: 90 students

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. So, there are 300 college freshmen with grades that are approximately normally distributed. The mean is 2.1, and the standard deviation is 1.2. The question is asking how many have GPAs between 2.5 and 3.5, rounded to the nearest tenth. The options are A to J, each with a different number.

Hmm, alright. I remember that when dealing with a normal distribution, we can use the Z-score to find probabilities. So, the first step is probably to find the Z-scores for 2.5 and 3.5, right?

Wait, the mean is 2.1, so 2.5 is 0.4 above the mean. And 3.5 is 1.4 above. Let me calculate the Z-scores. The formula for Z-score is (X - μ) / σ. So for 2.5, it's (2.5 - 2.1) / 1.2. Let me calculate that: 0.4 divided by 1.2 is 0.333... So about 0.333. For 3.5, it's (3.5 - 2.1) /1.2 = 1.4/1.2 = 1.166... So about 1.166.

Now, I need to find the area under the normal curve between these two Z-scores. I think I should look up the cumulative probabilities for each Z-score and subtract them. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact values. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that for Z=0.33, the cumulative probability is about 0.6293, and for Z=1.17, it's about 0.8790. Wait, but our Z-scores are 0.333 and 1.166. So maybe I should use more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a Z-table. Let me think: for Z=0.33, the area to the left is approximately 0.6293. For Z=1.16, it's about 0.8770. But wait, since our Z-scores are 0.333 and 1.166, maybe I should use more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the exact Z-values. Let me double-check. For Z = 0.333, the cumulative probability is about 0.6306. For Z = 1.166, wait, 1.166 is close to 1.17, and the cumulative probability for 1.17 is approximately 0.8790. So the area between 0.333 and 1.166 would be 0.8790 minus 0.6306, which is 0.2484.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I might have gotten the order wrong. Since 0.333 is lower than 1.166, the area between them is the area to the right of 0.333 and to the left of 1.166. So that would be the same as (area to left of 1.166) minus (area to left of 0.333). So that's 0.8790 - 0.6306 = 0.2484. So about 24.84% of the data lies between 2.5 and 3.5.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator or a better approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the standard normal distribution's area between 0 and 1 is about 0.3413, and between 0 and 1.17 is about 0.3794, but that might not help here. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator for more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should use the standard normal distribution table. Alternatively, let me think of it as Z=0.333 and Z=1.166. So, for Z=0.333, the cumulative probability is 0.6306. For Z=1.166, the cumulative is 0.8790. So the area between is 0.8790 - 0.6306 = 0.2484, which is approximately 24.84%.

So that's about 24.84% of the 300 students. Let me compute 300 * 0.2484. 0.2484 * 300 is 74.52. So approximately 75 students. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 75 as the exact number. Looking back: options are A:103, B:50, C:90, D:110, E:82, F:95, G:120, H:75, I:68, J:57.

Wait, 75 is option H. So the expected number is about 75, which is option H.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the Z-scores and calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, mean is 2.1.

For 2.5: (2.5 - 2.1) = 0.4. Divided by 1.2 gives approximately 0.3333 (exactly 1/3). So Z=0.3333.

For 3.5: (3.5-2.1) = 1.4. 1.4/1.2 = 1.166666... So Z=1.166666.

Looking up Z=0.3333: cumulative probability is 0.6306.

Z=1.166666: cumulative is 0.8790.

Subtracting: 0.8790-0.6306=0.2484, as before.

300 * 0.2484 = approximately 74.52, so about 75. So the answer should be 75, which is option H.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the standard normal table is more precise.

Wait, another approach: using the Z-table, the precise Z=0.3333 is 0.6306, and Z=1.1666 is approximately 0.8790, so the difference is 0.2484.

So, 300 * 0.2484 = 74.52 ≈75. So option H.

To determine how many of the 300 college freshmen have a GPA between 2.5 and 3.5, we use the properties of the normal distribution. The mean (μ) is 2.1, and the standard deviation (σ) is 1.2. 

1. **Calculate Z-scores:**
   - For 2.5: \( Z = \frac{2.5 - 2.1}{1.2} = 0.333 \)
   - For 3.5: \( Z = \frac{3.5 - 2.1}{1.2} = 1.166 \)

2. **Find the cumulative probabilities:**
   - The cumulative probability for \( Z = 0.333 \) is approximately 0.6306.
   - The cumulative probability for \( Z = 1.166 \) is approximately 0.8790.

3. **Calculate the area between the two Z-scores:**
   - The area between 0.333 and 1.166 is \( 0.8790 - 0.6306 = 0.2484 \).

4. **Compute the expected number of students:**
   - Multiply the area by the total number of students: \( 300 \times 0.2484 \approx 74.52 \).

5. **Round to the nearest whole number:**
   - Approximately 75 students.

The closest option to this calculation is **H: 75 students**.
