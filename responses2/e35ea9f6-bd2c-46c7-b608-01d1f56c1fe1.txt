Okay, so I need to figure out how many people in the U.S. were homeless in 2016. Let's see. I don't know the exact figure off the top of my head, so I'll have to think through some data I remember or can reason from.

First, I recall that the U.S. has a significant number of homeless people. I think it's in the hundreds of thousands, maybe millions. I've heard that numbers can be in the millions, but I'm not certain. 

I remember that in 2014, the number was around 1.5 million. But wait, I'm trying to recall if it was higher or lower. I think in 2016, it might have been a bit higher because of the economy and social issues. Or maybe lower because more people moved in or out. Hmm. Alternatively, I might be mixing up data from different years.

Let me think about the data points. In 2016, estimates were around 1.5 million people. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 1.5 million, which would be 1,500,000. Another option is F: 5,500,000, which is 5.5 million. So, why would there be such a big jump? Maybe because the number was growing or there was a specific reason for the increase.

I remember that in 2014, the U.S. homeless population was approximately 1.5 million. By 2016, I think it had grown to a higher number. Or perhaps it was around that much. Alternatively, maybe the number was lower because some people moved out due to finding better housing.

Wait, another angle: I've heard that the number of homeless people in the U.S. has been fluctuating. For example, in 2016, an estimate might be around 1.5 million. But the options don't have 1.5 million, wait no, option D is 1.5 million, which is 1,500,000. So that's one of the choices. Alternatively, another possibility is that the number was 5.5 million, which is option F.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider the trend. From 2014 to 2016, the number could have increased or decreased. If the number was around 1.5 million in 2014, perhaps in 2016 it was higher, maybe around 5 million. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might have read somewhere that in 2016, the number was around 1.5 million.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that the number of homeless people was around 1.5 million in 2016. So that would make option D the correct answer. But wait, another possibility is that I'm mixing up 2016 with another year's data. Let me think of the past data points.

Wait, I remember that in 2017, the number was about 1 million, and in 2018, it might have been around 2 million. So if 2016 was the year, perhaps it's higher than 2015 but not as high as 2017. Alternatively, maybe 2016's number was around 1.5 million. So option D.

Alternatively, I might have confused the numbers. Another approach is to think about the options. The options are A:55k, B:500k, C:10m, D:1.5m, E:600k, F:5.5m, G:10k, H:55m, I:1m, J:550k.

So, what's the average? Let's see the numbers. 55k is 55,000; 500k is 500,000; 10k is 10,000; 55m is 55 million; 600k is 600,000; 10m is 10 million; 5.5m is 5,500,000; 1m is 1 million; 550k is 550,000.

Wait, I think the correct number for 2016 was around 1.5 million, so D. Alternatively, I might be wrong, and the correct answer is F: 5.5 million. But I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach. I remember that in 2016, estimates were around 1.5 million, so D is the answer.

The number of people homeless in the United States in 2016 was estimated to be around 1.5 million, which corresponds to option D: 1,500,000.
