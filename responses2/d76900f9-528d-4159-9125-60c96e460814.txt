Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields around a charged disk. I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the distance along the central perpendicular axis (which I think is the axis perpendicular to the surface of the disk and passing through its center) where the electric field is half of what it is at the center. The disk has a radius of 0.600 meters and is uniformly charged with plastic.

Wait, I remember that the electric field for a uniformly charged disk isn't the same as for a point charge. Oh right, for a point charge, the field is 1/(4πε₀) * (Q/r²), but for a disk, the field varies with distance from the center. The formula I think is E = (σ/2ε₀) (1 - a²/(a² + z²)^(3/2)), where σ is the surface charge density, ε₀ is vacuum permittivity, a is the radius of the disk, and z is the distance along the axis.

Wait, let me get that right. The electric field at a point on the axis is E = (σ/2ε₀) [ ( z² + a² )^(1/2) - z ] / z².

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should write down the correct expression.

The formula for the electric field on the axis of a uniformly charged disk is:

E(z) = (σ)/(2ε₀) * ( z² + a² )^(1/2) - z ) / z².

Hmm, wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The electric field at a point along the axis at a distance z from the center is given by:

E(z) = ( σ / (2 ε₀) ) * [ ( z² + a² )^(1/2) - z ] / z².

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of z being much larger than a. Wait, but in this problem, it's not necessarily the case. So the expression is E(z) = (σ/(2ε₀)) [ ( ( z² + a² )^(1/2) - z ) / z² ].

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is E(z) = (σ/(2ε₀)) * [ (z² + a²)^(1/2) - z ] / z².

Wait, maybe another way. The electric field without the division by z^2 is E(z) = (σ/(2ε₀)) [ (z² + a²)^(1/2) - z ] * (1/z²). No, I might have it wrong. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is E(z) = (σ/(2ε₀)) [ (z² + a²)^(1/2) - z ] / z².

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to derive it.

The electric field due to a ring of radius r is dE = (σ * 2π r dr) / (2ε₀ (r² + z²))^{1/2}.

Wait, that's the electric field due to a ring at position r. Then to find E(z), we integrate from r=0 to r=a:

E(z) = ∫ (σ * 2π r dr) / (2ε₀ (r² + z²)^½ )

Wait, but wait, the formula is E(z) = (σ/(2ε₀)) ∫ (r dr) / (r² + z²)^(1/2) ) from 0 to a.

That integral is standard.

∫ (r dr) / (r² + z²)^½ ) from 0 to a.

Let u = r² + z², du = 2r dr → (1/2) du = r dr.

Then the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ du / sqrt(u) from u = z² to u = a² + z².

So (1/2) [ 2 sqrt(u) ] evaluated from z² to a² + z² → (1/2)*2 [ sqrt(a² + z²) - sqrt(z²) ]

Which simplifies to [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ].

So putting it all together:

E(z) = (σ/(2ε₀)) * [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ].

Wait, that seems more manageable. So E(z) = (σ/(2 ε₀)) [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ].

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I've heard it expressed as E(z) = (σ/(2 ε₀)) [ (z^2 + a^2)^{1/2} - z ].

Wait, but let me think about the units. The electric field should have units of N/C. Let's see. (σ is C/m², ε₀ is C²/(N·m²), z is in meters.

So (σ/(2ε₀)) has units (C/m²)/( C²/(N·m²) ) )= ( (N m²)/(C) )) * (C²/(N m²) )) → (C/(m²)) * m^-2 → No, wait,

Wait, more accurately: σ is C/m², ε₀ is F/m (farads per meter), and 1/(ε₀) has units C²/(N·m²).

So (σ/(ε₀)) has units (C/m²) * (C²/(N m²)) ) → (C^3)/(N m^4).

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here. Let me approach it differently.

Wait, in any case, the formula for E(z) is (σ/(2 ε₀)) [ (z² + a²)^(1/2) - z ].

Wait, now the problem says that the electric field is half of the field at the center. Let's first find E at the center, which is at z=0.

At z=0: E(0) = (σ/(2 ε₀)) [ (0 + a²)^(1/2) - 0 ] = (σ/(2 ε₀)) * a.

We need to find z where E(z) = (1/2) E(0).

So E(z) = (1/2) * (σ a)/(2 ε₀) ) = (σ a)/(4 ε₀).

Wait, no, wait. E(0) is (σ/(2 ε₀)) * a. So half of that is (σ a)/(4 ε₀).

So E(z) = (σ a) / (4 ε₀) ).

So set (σ/(2 ε₀)) [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ] = (σ a)/(4 ε₀).

We can divide both sides by (σ/(2 ε₀)).

Then [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ] = [ (σ a)/(4 ε₀) ) ] * (2 ε₀)/(σ) ) → [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ] = a/2.

Hmm, wait:

Let me redo the equation:

(σ/(2 ε₀)) [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ] = (σ a)/(4 ε₀ )

Multiply both sides by (2 ε₀)/σ:

[ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ] = (a/2).

So sqrt(a² + z²) = z + a/2.

Hmm, now I can square both sides:

a² + z² = (z + a/2)^2 → z² + 2 a z + (a²/4) →  a² + z² = z² + a z + a²/4.

Subtract z² from both sides:

a² = a z + (a²/4).

Bring a² terms to one side:

a² - a²/4 = a z → (3/4) a² = a z.

Divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠0):

z = (3/4) a.

Wait, wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, the maximum z would be when the disk is a sphere, but for a disk, as z increases beyond a, the field decreases. So if a is 0.6 m, then z would be 0.45 m. Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait, in the equation:

sqrt(a² + z²) = z + a/2.

Square both sides:

a² + z² = z² + a z + a²/4.

Cancel z²:

a² = a z + a²/4 → a² - a²/4 = a z → (3/4)a² = a z → z = (3/4) a.

So for a=0.6 m, z=0.45 m. Which is option E: 0.450 m.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me verify if that's correct. I think I might have made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, but wait, another approach: E(z) is (σ/(2 ε₀)) [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ].

We need E(z) = (1/2) E(0) = (σ a)/(4 ε₀).

So:

(σ/(2 ε₀)) [ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ] = (σ a)/(4 ε₀ )

Divide both sides by (σ/(2 ε₀)):

[ sqrt(a² + z²) - z ] = (a/2).

Then, sqrt(a² + z²) = z + a/2.

Square both sides:

a² + z² = (z + a/2)^2 → z² + a z + a²/4.

Wait,

Left side: a² + z².

Right side: z² + 2*(a/2)*z + (a/2)^2 = z² + a z + a²/4.

So,

a² + z² = z² + a z + a²/4.

Subtract z²:

a² = a z + a²/4.

Bring a² terms to left:

a² - a²/4 = a z → (3/4)a² = a z → z = (3/4)a.

But a is 0.6 m, so (3/4)*0.6 = 0.45 m.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.450 m.

But wait, wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the setup because I'm getting a result that seems to be (3/4) a, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the general expression for E(z) correctly. Let me check the formula again.

Alternative approach: I found a formula elsewhere that E(z) = (σ/(2 ε₀)) [ (z² + a²)^(1/2) - z ].

So, E(z) = (σ/(2 ε₀)) ( sqrt(z² + a²) - z ).

Set E(z) = (1/2) E(0).

E(0) = (σ/(2 ε₀)) (a) → half is (σ a)/(4 ε₀).

So,

(σ/(2 ε₀)) ( sqrt(z² + a²) - z ) ) = (σ a)/(4 ε₀ )

Multiply both sides by (2 ε₀)/σ:

sqrt(z² + a²) - z = (a/2).

So sqrt(z² + a²) = z + a/2.

Square both sides: z² + a² = z² + a z + a²/4.

Subtract z²: a² = a z + a²/4 → a² - a²/4 = a z → (3/4) a² = a z → z = (3/4) a.

So for a=0.6 m, z=0.45 m.

So the answer is E:0.450 m.

To determine the distance along the central perpendicular axis of a uniformly charged plastic disk where the electric field is half the magnitude at the center, we start with the formula for the electric field along the axis of a uniformly charged disk:

\[
E(z) = \frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0} \left( \sqrt{a^2 + z^2} - z \right),
\]

where \( \sigma \) is the surface charge density, \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, \( a \) is the radius of the disk, and \( z \) is the distance from the center along the axis.

The electric field at the center (\( z = 0 \)) is:

\[
E(0) = \frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0} a.
\]

The problem requires finding \( z \) such that \( E(z) = \frac{1}{2} E(0) \). Substituting \( E(z) \) and \( E(0) \), we get:

\[
\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0} \left( \sqrt{a^2 + z^2} - z \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0} a.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + z^2} - z = \frac{a}{2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + z^2} = z + \frac{a}{2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
a^2 + z^2 = \left( z + \frac{a}{2} \right)^2.
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:

\[
a^2 + z^2 = z^2 + a z + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]

Canceling \( z^2 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 = a z + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]

Subtracting \( \frac{a^2}{4} \) from \( a^2 \):

\[
\frac{3}{4} a^2 = a z.
\]

Dividing through by \( a \) (assuming \( a \neq 0 \)):

\[
z = \frac{3}{4} a.
\]

For \( a = 0.600 \, \mathrm{m} \), we find:

\[
z = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 0.600 = 0.450 \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Thus, the distance along the central perpendicular axis where the electric field is half the magnitude at the center is \( 0.450 \, \mathrm{m} \).
