Okay, so I've got this probability problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The joint density function of X and Y is given as f(x, y) = 6x²y, where both x and y are between 0 and 1. I need to find the probability that X is between 0 and 3/4 and Y is between 1/3 and 2. 

Wait, hold on a second. The question says 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1. So Y can only go from 0 to 1 as well. But the problem wants me to find the probability where Y is less than 2. Oh, but Y can't be more than 1, so the upper limit is actually 1. So I should adjust the upper limit for Y to 1. So the region we're looking at is 0 < x < 3/4 and 1/3 < y < 1. Because Y can't be more than 1.

The probability is the double integral over this region of f(x, y) dy dx. So I should set up the integral as the integral from x=0 to x=3/4, and for each x, the integral from y=1/3 to y=1 of 6x²y dy dx.

Let me compute the inner integral first— integrating with respect to y. The integrand is 6x²y, so integrating with respect to y would be 6x² * (y²/2) evaluated between y=1/3 and y=1.

Calculating that: at y=1, it's 6x²*(1/2) = 3x². At y=1/3, it's 6x²*( (1/3)^2 / 2 ) = 6x²*(1/9 * 1/2) = 6x²*(1/18) = (6/18)x² = (1/3)x². So subtracting, we have 3x² - (1/3)x² = (8/3)x².

Now the outer integral is integrating (8/3)x² from x=0 to x=3/4. So ∫ (8/3)x² dx from 0 to 3/4. The integral of x² is x³/3, so we have (8/3) * ( ( (3/4)^3 ) / 3 ) - 0.

Calculating (3/4)^3: 27/64. Divided by 3 gives 9/64. Multiply by 8/3: (8/3)*(9/64) = (72)/(192) = 3/8. Wait, 72/192 simplifies to 3/8? Let me check: 72 ÷ 24 is 3, 192 ÷24 is 8. So yes, 3/8.

So the probability is 3/8. Looking at the options, option H is 3/8. So I think the answer is H.

The probability is calculated by integrating the joint density function over the specified region. The result is 3/8, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
