Okay, so I've got this question about memory systems, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking which memory system is the most automatic among the options given. Let me think through each option.

First, let's list out the options again: A is Implicit memory, B is autobiographical, C is semantic, D working, E is episodic, F prospective, G explicit, H declarative, I sensory.

I remember that memory can be categorized into different types based on how automatic they are. Automatic vs. controlled. Automatic memories happen without conscious effort, right? Like when you're reading and forget to check your keys, but you can do it quickly without thinking.

I think the basic structures of memory are divided into different levels. There's the short-term (like immediate) and long-term (like memory palace) storage. But the question is about automaticity, not necessarily the depth.

So, implicit and explicit memories. Implicit is automatic, which I think is the base level. Like you just know things without thinking about why or how. Explicit is deliberate, meaning you actively try to remember them, perhaps by encoding them.

I remember that when a person is in a state of automaticity, they don't need to actively control their memory. So implicit is more automatic. Explicit is controlled, like when you have to remember something and have to think about it.

So the options are between implicit (A), explicit (H), and maybe others. Let me think about the options given. The choices include both implicit and explicit (A and H). The question is which is the most automatic. So, implicit is more automatic than explicit.

Wait, but what about explicit vs. automatic? I think implicit is automatic, explicit requires effort. So the most automatic is implicit. That would make A the answer.

But wait, another thought: some sources say that implicit is the base level, and explicit is a higher level. So the most automatic would be implicit, which is option A.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up some terms. Let me make sure. From what I remember, implicit is the default, automatic, and that's the base. Explicit is when you actively try to remember, but that's a controlled process.

So putting it all together, the most automatic is implicit. So the answer is A.
