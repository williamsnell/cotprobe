Okay, so I've got a statistics question about confidence intervals. Hmm, let me think. The question is about which factors will result in a smaller margin of error when estimating a population mean using a confidence interval. The options are I, II, III, etc.

So, the original setup is a random sample of n families' monthly grocery expenditures. They’re asking which of the three statements (I, II, III) will lead to a smaller margin of error.

Let me remember the formula for the margin of error. I think it's something like E = z*(σ/√n) for a large sample, or E = t*(s/√n) for a small sample. But in this case, the question doesn't specify whether the sample size is small or large, but maybe it's using the z-score approach.

The margin of error formula depends on the standard error. The standard error is σ divided by the square root of n, but if we don't know σ, we use the sample standard deviation, s, over sqrt(n). Or if we're using a t-distribution, it's t*(s/sqrt(n)).

Wait, the question is about which of the three factors (I, II, III) will make the margin of error smaller. Let's break down each option.

Option I: Smaller confidence level. I know that a higher confidence level (like 95% vs. 90%) requires a larger z-score or t-score, which increases the margin of error. So a smaller confidence level would mean a smaller z or t, which reduces the margin of error. So I would make E smaller. So statement I is correct.

Option II: Smaller sample standard deviation. Oh wait, the margin of error formula includes s. So if s is smaller, the standard error is smaller, so E would be smaller. So statement II is correct.

Option III: Smaller sample size. The sample size n is in the denominator under the square root. So a smaller n would lead to a larger denominator, making the standard error larger. So E would be larger, not smaller. So statement III would make E bigger, so it's not correct.

So which of the options include I and II? Let's check the options.

Option A: I and II. So I and II are correct.

Option D: II and III. No, because III would be incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me recheck. I is correct, II is correct. III is incorrect. So the correct statements are I and II, which is option A.

So the answer should be option A.

The margin of error is influenced by the confidence level, sample standard deviation, and sample size. A smaller confidence level reduces the margin of error, a smaller sample standard deviation also reduces it, and a larger sample size (smaller n) increases the margin of error. Therefore, only statements I and II result in a smaller margin of error, making the correct answer:

**A: I and II**

Answer: A
