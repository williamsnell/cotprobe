Okay, so Simmons gives her child a publicly traded stock. The stock has a basis of $40,000 and a fair market value (FMV) of $30,000. They didn't pay any gift tax because that's how it's done. Then the child sells the stock for $36,000. The question is about the child's recognized gain or loss.

Hmm, I remember that when a parent gives a gift to a child, the child's basis is based on the parent's basis plus any distributions or capital gains they receive. Wait, but in this case, Simmons is the parent giving the stock. The child's basis is the parent's basis plus any distributions they receive. But wait, Simmons's basis is $40,000. She gave the stock, so the child's basis becomes $40,000 minus any distributions. Wait, no, the child's basis is the parent's basis plus any distributions. But since no distributions were made, the child's basis remains $40,000.

Wait, no, the child's basis is calculated as the parent's basis plus any distributions received, up to the basis limit. Since the parent's basis is $40k, and the child didn't receive any distributions, the child's basis is $40k. Now, the child sells the stock for $36k. The FMV was $30k before selling, but when you sell, you have to consider the FMV at the time. Wait, the FMV is the price the parent sold it for, which is $30k. But when the child sells, they record the selling price as the basis? Or do they record the difference?

Wait, the child's basis is $40k. They sell it for $36k, which is a selling price of $36k. The recognized gain or loss is the difference between the selling price and the basis. But wait, is the FMV the same as the selling price here? Or is it different? Because the FMV is the price the parent sold it for, not the child's selling price.

Wait, let me think. The parent's basis is $40k. When the parent sells the stock, the FMV is $30k, so the parent would record a loss of $10k. But when the child sells it, the child's basis is $40k. The child sells it for $36k, which is less than FMV. Wait, but the FMV is the price the parent sold it for, not the child's. So the child's gain or loss is the difference between the selling price and the basis. So, $36k minus $40k is a $4k loss. But wait, that doesn't feel right. Because the FMV is $30k, so the parent would have a loss, but the child doesn't take that into account. So the child's basis is $40k, and the child sells at $36k. So the difference is $4k, which is a loss. So the child has a $4k loss.

Wait, but what about the FMV? Because the parent's FMV was $30k, leading to a loss of $10k for the parent. But the child didn't have any distributions, so their basis is still $40k. So when the child sells for $36k, the loss is the difference between $36k and $40k, which is $4k. So the answer should be a $4k loss. Looking at the options, option G is $6,000 loss, H is $4,000 loss. So the correct answer is H: $4,000 loss.

The child's recognized gain or loss is determined by comparing the selling price to the basis. Simmons's basis is $40,000, and the child's basis is also $40,000 (no distributions). The child sells the stock for $36,000. Therefore, the child has a recognized $4,000 loss.

Answer: H: $4,000 loss.
