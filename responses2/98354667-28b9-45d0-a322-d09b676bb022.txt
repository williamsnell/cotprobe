Okay, so I've got this finance problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about Charles paying Bernice $800 five years from now if Bernice lends him $500 now. They're asking for the rate of return on the $500 loan. Hmm, I remember that rate of return is related to interest rates and returns on investments. 

Wait, let's think about this. So Charles is giving Bernice a loan of $500 today, and in five years, he'll get back $800. That means the $500 has grown to $800 over five years. I think this is a classic present value to future value problem. The formula I remember is that future value equals present value multiplied by (1 plus the rate) raised to the number of periods. So, FV = PV * (1 + r)^n.

In this case, FV is $800, PV is $500, n is 5 years, and r is the rate we're trying to find. So plugging in the numbers: 800 = 500 * (1 + r)^5. I need to solve for r.

Let me rearrange the equation. Divide both sides by 500. That gives me 800/500 = (1 + r)^5. 800 divided by 500 is 1.6. So 1.6 equals (1 + r)^5. Now I need to solve for r. 

Taking the fifth root of both sides. So take 1.6 to the power of 1/5. I'm not exactly sure how to do that by hand, but I can estimate or use logarithms. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use logarithms. Let me see: ln(1.6) = 5 * ln(1 + r). Then divide both sides by 5, and take the exponential to get (1 + r).

Calculating ln(1.6). I think ln(1.6) is approximately 0.4700. Then ln(1 + r) = 0.4700 / 5 ≈ 0.094. So e^0.094 is approximately... wait, e^0.1 is about 1.105, so e^0.094 would be a bit less. Let me think. 0.094 is about 9.4%, and e^0.09 is about 1.09417, so 0.094 would be a little higher, maybe 1.0975 or similar. So 1 + r ≈ 1.0975, which means r ≈ 9.75%. 

Looking at the options, option C is 11.86%, option G is 9.86%. Wait, my calculation gave me around 9.75%, which is closest to 9.86%, which is option G. But wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the rule of 72 to estimate the doubling time, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Let me try another approach. Let me compute (1 + r)^5 = 1.6. Let's try r = 9.75%: (1.0975)^5. Let me compute that step by step. 

1.0975^1 = 1.0975

1.0975^2 = 1.0975 * 1.0975 ≈ 1.2045

1.0975^3 = 1.2045 * 1.0975 ≈ 1.3209

1.0975^4 = 1.3209 * 1.0975 ≈ 1.444

1.0975^5 ≈ 1.444 * 1.0975 ≈ 1.592. Hmm, that's 1.592, which is less than 1.6. So maybe r is a bit higher.

Let me try r = 9.86%: 1.0986^5. Let's compute:

1.0986^2 ≈ 1.0986 * 1.0986 ≈ 1.2069

1.0986^3 ≈ 1.2069 * 1.0986 ≈ 1.3256

1.0986^4 ≈ 1.3256 * 1.0986 ≈ 1.455

1.0986^5 ≈ 1.455 * 1.0986 ≈ 1.599. Hmm, that's about 1.599, which is a bit higher than 1.6. Wait, but 1.592 was at 9.75%, and 1.599 at 9.86%. So maybe the exact rate is between 9.75% and 9.86%. Let's try 9.8%: 1.098^5.

Compute 1.098^5:

1.098^2 = (1.098)(1.098) = 1.205604

1.098^3 = 1.205604 * 1.098 ≈ 1.3225

1.098^4 = 1.3225 * 1.098 ≈ 1.448

1.098^5 ≈ 1.448 * 1.098 ≈ 1.587. Hmm, that's 1.587, which is less than 1.6. So perhaps 9.8% gives 1.587, and 9.86% gives 1.599. So the exact rate is somewhere in between.

Wait, but the options are given as:

A:13.86%, B:5.86%, C:11.86%, D:10.86%, E:12.86%, F:14.86%, G:9.86%, H:8.86%, I:7.86%, J:6.86%.

Looking at my calculations, the closest option is G)9.86% and the next is F)14.86%, which is way higher. So perhaps the correct answer is G:9.86%.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I did the calculations correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponentiation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Rule of 72, but that's for doubling time. Let me think. 72 divided by the rate gives the doubling period. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Wait, another approach: if I use the formula for effective annual rate. The formula is r = (FV/P)^(1/n) -1. So with FV=800, P=500, n=5.

So 800/500 = 1.6. So (1.6)^(1/5) = 1.6^0.2. Now, 1.6^0.2 is approximately 1.0975, as I calculated earlier. So r is approximately 9.75%, which is about 9.8%. So option G is 9.86%, which is very close. So the correct answer is G.

The problem involves calculating the rate of return on a $500 loan that will yield $800 in five years. This is a present value to future value problem. Using the formula FV = PV × (1 + r)^n, where FV is $800, PV is $500, n is 5 years, and r is the rate, we rearrange to find r:

1.6 = (1 + r)^5  
Taking the fifth root: (1.6)^(1/5) ≈ 1.0975  
Thus, r ≈ 9.75%, which is closest to option G (9.86%).

Answer: G
