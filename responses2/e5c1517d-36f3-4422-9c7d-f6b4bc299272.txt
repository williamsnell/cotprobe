Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility products and precipitation. Hmm, I remember that solubility products (Ksp) are used to determine when a hydroxide will precipitate. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the solubility products for Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃ are 10⁻¹⁷ and 10⁻³⁸ respectively. Both Fe²+ and Fe³+ concentrations are 10⁻⁵ M. I need to find the pH at which each hydroxide just begins to precipitate. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, I think I should start by writing the dissolution equations for both hydroxides. For Fe(OH)₂, it would dissociate as Fe(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Fe²+ (aq) + 2 OH⁻ (aq). Similarly, Fe(OH)₃ would be Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³+ (aq) + 3 OH⁻ (aq).

The Ksp for each is given, so for Fe(OH)₂, Ksp = [Fe²+][OH⁻]² = 10⁻¹⁷. For Fe(OH)₃, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]³ = 10⁻³⁸.

Now, the concentrations of Fe²+ and Fe³+ are both 10⁻⁵ M. Let's denote the pH as 'pH', which affects the concentration of OH⁻ ions. Since pH + pOH = 14, and pOH = -log[OH⁻], so [OH⁻] = 10⁻(14 - pH).

But wait, actually, the concentration of OH⁻ is [OH⁻] = 10^(-pH + 14) but wait, no. Actually, [OH⁻] = 10^(-pOH) and pOH = 14 - pH. So [OH⁻] = 10^(pH -14). Wait, that's correct. Alternatively, [OH⁻] = 10^(-pOH) = 10^(14 - pH).

So, let's proceed step by step for each hydroxide.

Starting with Fe(OH)₂. The Ksp = [Fe²+][OH⁻]².

Given [Fe²+] = 10⁻⁵ M.

So, plug in the values: 1e-17 = (1e-5) * ( [OH⁻] )².

Solve for [OH⁻]²: [OH⁻]² = (1e-17) / (1e-5) = 1e-12.

So [OH⁻] = sqrt(1e-12) = 1e-6 M.

Now, since [OH⁻] = 1e-6, we can find pH. [OH⁻] = 1e-6 = 1e-(pH -14 +14) ? Wait, no. Wait, [OH⁻] = 1e^(-pOH). pOH = pH + 14, no, wait, no. Wait, pH + pOH = 14. So, [OH⁻] = 1e^(-pOH) = 1e^(- (14 - pH)) ) = 1e^(pH -14 +14?) Wait, better think again. pOH is 14 - pH. So [OH⁻] = 10^(-pOH) = 10^{-(14 - pH)} = 10^{(pH -14)}. Wait, no, wait, 10^(- (14 - pH)) = 10^{pH -14} ? No, that can't be right. Wait, 14 - pH is pOH. So 10^(-pOH) = [OH⁻] = 10^{-(14-pH)}.

Wait, 10^(- (14-pH)) is equal to 10^{pH-14} ?

Wait no, let me compute. Let’s say pH is 7. Then pOH is 7. [OH⁻] is 1e-7, which is correct. So, in general, [OH⁻] = 10^{ (pH -14) } ?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because 10^{(pH-14)} is the same as 10^{pH} * 10^{-14}, which is the same as [H+] * 1e-14. But [OH⁻] is 1e-(pOH) = 1e^(- (14-pH)) = 1e^{pH-14}.

Wait, no, pH = -log[H+], so [H+] = 10^(-pH). [OH-] = 10^(-pOH) = 10^(14 - pH). So [OH-] is 10^{14 - pH}.

Wait, let me think again. If pH is 7, then [OH-] = 1e-7, which is 1e^(7-14) = 1e^(-7) → that's correct.

So [OH⁻] = 10^{(pH -14)}? Wait, no. Wait, no, [OH-] is 10^{pH -14} when pH is 7, because 10^{7-14}=1e-7. That's correct. So [OH⁻] = 10^{pH -14} for pH between 0 and 14.

Wait, wait, no. Let me make this clear.

pH + pOH = 14 → pOH = 14 - pH.

So [OH-] = 10^{-pOH} = 10^{-(14-pH)} = 10^{pH -14} * 10^{14} → wait no, 10^(- (14-pH)) = 10^{pH -14} when? No, because 10^{a} is 10^{-(14-pH)} → pH is 7, 14-pH is 7. So 10^{7} is 1e7. So [OH-] = 1e7 M. Wait, but that can't be right because pH 7 is acidic solution. Wait, but [OH-] in a solution with pH 7 is 1e-7 M, which matches 10^{7-14}=1e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should go back. [OH-] = 10^{pH -14} is correct? Let's test pH=7: 7-14= -7 → 1e-7. Correct. pH=14 → [OH-] = 1e0=1 → correct (since pH 14 is basic, [OH-]=1e-0=1 M). pH=0: 1e-14 → correct (so [OH-]=1e-14 M, which is correct for a very acidic solution).

So, yes, [OH-] = 10^{pH -14}.

Wait, but wait, in our case, after calculating, [OH-] is 1e-6 M. So:

1e-6 = 10^{pH -14} → pH -14 = -6 → pH = 8. So the pH for Fe(OH)₂ is 8.

Wait, but let me double-check. [OH-] = 1e-6 → pH is 8 because 1e-6 is 1e- (8-14) → 8-14=-6 → pH=8. So for Fe(OH)₂, the pH is 8.

Now, let's do the same for Fe(OH)3.

The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 1e-38. The dissolution is Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3 OH- → Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = 1e-38.

Given [Fe³+] = 1e-5 M.

So, 1e-38 = (1e-5) * ( [OH⁻] )³.

Divide both sides: [OH⁻]³ = (1e-38) / (1e-5) )=1e-33.

So [OH⁻] = (1e-33)^(1/3) → cube root of 1e-33.

Cube root of 1e-33 is 1e-11, because (1e-11)^3 =1e-33.

So [OH-] = 1e-11 M.

Now, [OH-] is 1e-11. Again, [OH-] =10^{pH -14}.

So 1e-11 = 10^{pH -14} → pH -14 = -11 → pH=3.

So for Fe(OH)3, the pH is 3.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E has pH=8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH=3 for Fe(OH)3. That's option E.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option E says pH=8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH=3 for Fe(OH)3. That matches what I found. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents.

Let me re-calculate for Fe(OH)3.

Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 1e-38.

[Fe³+] is 1e-5. So (1e-5) * (OH⁻)^3 = 1e-38 → (OH⁻)^3 = 1e-33 → OH⁻ = (1e-33)^(1/3) = 1e-11.

So [OH-] =1e-11 → correct.

Now, [OH-] =1e-11 =10^(pH-14) → pH-14= -11 → pH=3. So yes, correct.

Thus, the pH values are 8 and 3 respectively. Looking at the options, option E is pH=8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH=3 for Fe(OH)3. So the correct answer must be E.

To determine the pH at which each hydroxide just begins to precipitate, we use the solubility product constant (Ksp) and the given concentrations of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺. The hydroxides in question are Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃, with Ksp values of 10⁻¹⁷ and 10⁻³⁸, respectively. The concentrations of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ are both 10⁻⁵ M.

### For Fe(OH)₂:
1. The dissolution equation is: Fe(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Fe²⁺ (aq) + 2 OH⁻ (aq).
2. The Ksp expression is: Ksp = [Fe²⁺][OH⁻]².
3. Substituting the given values: 10⁻¹⁷ = (10⁻⁵)[OH⁻]².
4. Solving for [OH⁻]²: [OH⁻]² = (10⁻¹⁷) / (10⁻⁵) = 10⁻¹².
5. Taking the square root: [OH⁻] = 10⁻⁶ M.
6. Since [OH⁻] = 10^(pH - 14), we have: 10^(pH - 14) = 10⁻⁶.
7. Solving for pH: pH - 14 = -6 → pH = 8.

### For Fe(OH)₃:
1. The dissolution equation is: Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺ (aq) + 3 OH⁻ (aq).
2. The Ksp expression is: Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.
3. Substituting the given values: 10⁻³⁸ = (10⁻⁵)[OH⁻]³.
4. Solving for [OH⁻]³: [OH⁻]³ = (10⁻³⁸) / (10⁻⁵) = 10⁻³³.
5. Taking the cube root: [OH⁻] = (10⁻³³)^(1/3) = 10⁻¹¹ M.
6. Since [OH⁻] = 10^(pH - 14), we have: 10^(pH - 14) = 10⁻¹¹.
7. Solving for pH: pH - 14 = -11 → pH = 3.

### Final Results:
- pH for Fe(OH)₂ is 8.
- pH for Fe(OH)₃ is 3.

### Matching with Options:
- Option E states pH = 8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH = 3 for Fe(OH)₃, which matches the calculated values.
