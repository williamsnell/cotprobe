Okay, so I need to answer this question about Butler and Stokes (1969) and their theory on why the working class supported the Labour Party. Hmm, I remember that Butler is associated with a different perspective on politics, maybe more about individualism and self-interest. Let me think.

The question is asking which of the options best explains the working class's support for Labour. The options are A to J, each with different ideas.

 Butler and Stokes (1969) are known for their work on political theory, particularly in the area of individualism. They argued that people have a self-interested drive, but they also saw that this drive was influenced by the cultural context, especially the working class's desire for social status and control. So, it's not just individual self-interest but also how it's shaped by the social structures of the time.

Looking at the options:

A: rational calculation of self-interest. This sounds more like what Butler was saying, about individual choices under pressure. But wait, the question is about why the working class supported Labour, so maybe this isn't the main point.

B: Socialization into working class families. That's more about how the working class becomes part of society, but I'm not sure if that's directly about the political support.

C: Influence of trade unions and workers' movements. These movements did play a role, but the question is about the underlying cause, not the outcomes.

D: Influence from upper-class ideals. Butler focused on the working class's own ideas, not just the other classes.

E: Impact of local political landscape and voting habits. This is about how the political environment affects voter behavior, but the question is about why working class support came to Labour.

F: Desire to conform to societal norms. That's about individual motives, but again, the question is about the political reason behind the support.

G: False consciousness and hegemonic values. I'm not sure how relevant this is. It might relate to a cultural shift, but the question is more about individual choices.

H: Lack of exposure to other ideologies. If the working class didn't have access to other views, they might support Labour. But that's more about the political climate rather than the cause of support.

I: Issue-based concerns about culture and lifestyle. This seems like a perspective-based approach, which Butler discussed. He talked about individual choices influenced by cultural factors.

J: Dissatisfaction with other parties. This is a modern perspective, not from Butler's time, so probably not the right answer.

Putting it together, Butler and Stokes argued that working class individuals have a self-interested drive but are also shaped by social structures. So the working class's support for Labour comes from their individual self-interest within the social context, which is option A. But wait, I think I'm mixing up the concepts here. Another angle: the question's answer is about the political reason behind the support, so perhaps the answer is C. Wait, no, because Butler focused on individual choice, not the influence of unions.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about why the working class supported Labour. The theory would explain it as their individual self-interest, influenced by the working class's desire for social control and status. So the answer should be A: rational calculation of self-interest. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, Butler's work is about individualism, so individual choice under pressure, which might align with option A. But I'm a bit confused because I thought Butler's focus was individualism, not self-interest as in A.

Wait, but the question lists option A as "rational calculation of self-interest". So according to Butler, the working class's self-interest is rational, but it's also shaped by the social context. So the correct answer would be A. Alternatively, someone might think that option C is the answer, because it's about the influence of unions and workers' rights, but the question is about the underlying reason for support, not the effect.

Alternatively, perhaps option G is correct, but I think it's not. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is A because Butler's theory was about individualism, which includes self-interest within the social context.

Butler & Stokes (1969) proposed that working class support for the Labour Party arose from a rational calculation of self-interest, influenced by the social context. Butler's theory emphasized individualism, where individual choices are shaped by cultural and social structures, particularly within the working class's desire for social control and status.

**Answer: A: rational calculation of self-interest**
