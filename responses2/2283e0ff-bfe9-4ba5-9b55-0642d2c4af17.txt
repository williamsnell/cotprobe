Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of normal distributions. Let's see what it's about. The question says that 60% of parts last over 3 years, and 70% last less than 6 years. They're assuming a normal distribution, and I need to find the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The options are A through J, each giving different μ and σ values.

Hmm, I remember that in a normal distribution, the probabilities correspond to areas under the curve. So, if 60% of the parts last over 3 years, that should correspond to the 60th percentile. Similarly, 70% last less than 6 years, which is the 70th percentile. Wait, wait. Wait, no—wait, actually, if 60% last over 3 years, that means 40% last 3 years or less. And 70% last less than 6 years, so 30% last 6 years or more. So in terms of the standard normal distribution, I think I need to find the z-scores corresponding to these probabilities.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For a normal distribution, the area to the left of a certain value is the cumulative probability up to that point. So, the 60% that last over 3 years would mean that 40% (100% - 60%) last 3 years or less. Similarly, 70% last less than 6 years. So, for the 3-year mark, it's the 40th percentile, and for the 6-year mark, it's the 70th percentile.

So I need to find the z-scores for these percentiles. Let's figure that out. I think I can use a z-table or a calculator for this. Alternatively, maybe I can remember some common z-scores, but I don't think they're exact for 40% and 70%. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inverse of the standard normal distribution.

Wait, another approach: The 40th percentile corresponds to a z-score of about -0.2533 (I think, but I'm not sure). Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The 50th percentile is 0, the mean is 0. The 40th percentile is to the left of the mean. So for a standard normal distribution, the 40th percentile is a z of about -0.2533. And the 70th percentile is about 0.5244. Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact z-values. Alternatively, I can use the inverse function. But since I don't have a calculator here, perhaps I can recall that for the 40th percentile, the z is approximately -0.25, and for the 70th, it's about 0.52. But I'm not certain, so maybe I should think of it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the mean and standard deviation. Suppose that the 40th percentile (z1) corresponds to 3 years, and the 70th percentile (z2) corresponds to 6 years. So,

z1 = (3 - μ) / σ
z2 = (6 - μ) / σ

Now, I need to find z1 and z2 such that the area to the left of z1 is 0.4 (since 40% is below 3) and the area to the left of z2 is 0.7 (since 70% is below 6). So, I need to find z1 and z2 such that their cumulative probabilities are 0.4 and 0.7 respectively.

I think the standard normal distribution table can help. Let me try to remember or estimate these z-values.

For z1, which is the 40th percentile, approximately z = -0.25 because the 34th percentile is about -0.43, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator. Wait, in any case, perhaps instead of trying to remember, I can proceed with the equations.

So, from the first equation: 3 = μ + z1 * σ → z1 = (3 - μ)/σ

From the second equation: 6 = μ + z2 * σ → z2 = (6 - μ)/σ

Now, the area under the curve to the left of z1 is 0.4, and to the left of z2 is 0.7.

I think that for z = -0.2533, the area is approximately 0.4. So let's say z1 is approximately -0.25, and z2 is about 0.52. Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, looking up the z-scores:

For a standard normal distribution, the z-score corresponding to 0.4 is about -0.2533. Let me confirm:

Using a z-table, the 40th percentile is at a z value of approximately -0.2533.

Similarly, the 70th percentile. Wait, the area to the left of z is 0.7. So the z is about 0.5244. Because the z for 0.7 is approximately 0.5244.

So,

z1 = (3 - μ)/σ = -0.2533
z2 = (6 - μ)/σ = 0.5244

Now, I have two equations:

Equation 1: (3 - μ) = -0.2533 * σ → 3 - μ = -0.2533 σ → μ = 3 + 0.2533 σ

Equation 2: (6 - μ) = 0.5244 σ → 6 - μ = 0.5244 σ → μ = 6 - 0.5244 σ

Now, since both expressions equal μ, I can set them equal to each other:

3 + 0.2533 σ = 6 - 0.5244 σ

Now, bring like terms together:

0.2533 σ + 0.5244 σ = 6 - 3

(0.2533 + 0.5244) σ = 3

0.7777 σ = 3

σ = 3 / 0.7777 ≈ 3.861

Wait, so σ is approximately 3.861. Then, plugging back into equation 1:

μ = 3 + 0.2533 * 3.861 ≈ 3 + (0.2533 * 3.861)

Calculating 0.2533 * 3.861: Let me compute that. 0.25 *3.861 is about 0.96525, and 0.0033 *3.861 is about 0.0127. So adding them, 0.96525 + 0.0127 ≈ 0.97795. So μ ≈ 3 + 0.97795 ≈ 3.97795, which is approximately 3.978, which I can round to 3.98.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option H is μ=3.977, σ=3.861, which is exactly what I got. So that would be the right answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

So, σ was 3.861, which is one of the options. And the mean came out to about 3.977, which is also an option (H). Let me check if that's consistent.

Wait, but let's verify. Let's plug μ=3.977 and σ=3.861 into the equations.

Equation 1: (3 - μ) / σ = (3 - 3.977)/3.861 = (-0.977)/3.861 ≈ -0.2533. That's correct because z1 is -0.2533.

Equation 2: (6 - μ) / σ = (6 - 3.977)/3.861 = (2.023)/3.861 ≈ 0.5244. That's correct because z2 is 0.5244.

So that's all consistent. Therefore, μ is approximately 3.977, σ is approximately 3.861. Looking at the options, option H is μ=3.977, σ=3.861. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes these problems can be tricky.

Looking at the options:

A: 3.677, 3.661 → seems lower than our calculated mean and σ.

B: 4.177, 3.561 → higher mean, lower σ.

C: same as A → lower mean.

D: 4.377, 3.261 → higher mean, lower σ.

E: 4.277, 3.861 → higher μ than our calculated 3.977, same σ.

F: 3.277, 3.461 → lower μ.

G: 3.877, 3.961 → close to our μ, but σ is a bit higher.

H: 3.977, 3.861 → which matches our calculation.

J: 4.077, 3.661 → higher μ, same σ.

So, the only option that matches our calculated μ and σ is option H. So the answer must be H.

The problem involves determining the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of a normal distribution based on given probabilities. 

Given:
- 60% of parts last over 3 years → 40% last 3 years or less.
- 70% last less than 6 years → 30% last 6 years or more.

These correspond to the 40th and 70th percentiles. Using standard normal distribution tables or known z-scores:
- The 40th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately -0.2533.
- The 70th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.5244.

Setting up the equations:
1. \( 3 = \mu + (-0.2533) \cdot \sigma \)
2. \( 6 = \mu + 0.5244 \cdot \sigma \)

Solving these:
- From equation 1: \( \mu = 3 + 0.2533 \cdot \sigma \)
- From equation 2: \( \mu = 6 - 0.5244 \cdot \sigma \)

Equating the two expressions for μ:
\[ 3 + 0.2533 \cdot \sigma = 6 - 0.5244 \cdot \sigma \]
\[ 0.7777 \cdot \sigma = 3 \]
\[ \sigma = \frac{3}{0.7777} \approx 3.861 \]

Substituting σ back into the equation for μ:
\[ \mu = 3 + 0.2533 \cdot 3.861 \approx 3.977 \]

Thus, the mean μ is approximately 3.977 and the standard deviation σ is approximately 3.861. This matches option H.
