Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about profit maximization for a firm, and then considering a tax on the profit. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the problem says that firm A has a demand function P = 15 - 0.05q and a total cost function TC = q + 0.02q². There are two parts: part (a) is to find the point of profit maximization, and part (b) is to find the maximum profit if a $1/unit tax is imposed.

Starting with part (a). I remember that profit maximization occurs where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. So I need to find the marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC), set them equal, and solve for q.

The demand function is P = 15 - 0.05q. To find MR, I can take the derivative of total revenue (TR) with respect to q. TR is P*q, so substituting the demand function, TR = (15 - 0.05q) * q = 15q - 0.05q².

Taking the derivative of TR with respect to q gives MR = dTR/dq = 15 - 0.10q.

Now, the total cost is given as TC = q + 0.02q². So, the marginal cost is the derivative of TC with respect to q. That would be MC = dTC/dq = 1 + 0.04q.

Setting MR equal to MC: 15 - 0.10q = 1 + 0.04q.

Let me solve for q:

15 - 1 = 0.04q + 0.10q  
14 = 0.14q  
q = 14 / 0.14  
q = 100.

So, q* is 100 units. Now, I need to find the price P*. Using the demand function: P = 15 - 0.05(100) = 15 - 5 = 10. So P* is $10.

So part (a) gives q* as 100 and P* as 10. Now, part (b) is about a $1 unit tax being imposed. I think this affects the marginal cost because the firm now has to pay the tax on its profits. So the tax would be included in the cost structure.

Let me think: the tax is a cost, so it's a fixed cost per unit. So the new total cost would be TC = q + 0.02q² + 1*q (since the tax is $1 per unit, and q is the quantity). Wait, no, wait. The tax is a per-unit tax, so it's a fixed cost in terms of per-unit cost. So the new cost function would be the original cost plus the tax. So TC becomes q + 0.02q² + 1*q? No, wait, that's not correct. The tax is a per-unit tax on the firm's profit. Alternatively, the tax can be considered as an additional fixed cost. 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the firm's new cost structure. When a tax is imposed, the firm's cost increases by the tax amount. So the new cost function is TC = q + 0.02q² + t*q, where t is $1. So, substituting t=1: TC = q + 0.02q² + q = 2q + 0.02q².

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the firm's cost is now TC = q + 0.02q² + t*q, so t is the tax per unit, which is $1. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, if the tax is imposed, the firm's cost increases. So the new cost function is TC_new = original TC + (tax per unit) * q. Since the tax is $1 per unit, then TC_new = q + 0.02q² + q = 2q + 0.02q².

Now, to find the new profit maximization. The new MR is the same as before, because the tax isn't affecting the demand, only the cost. So MR is still 15 - 0.10q.

Set MR equal to new MC.

The new MC is the derivative of TC_new with respect to q: d/dq (2q + 0.02q²) = 2 + 0.04q.

Setting MR = MC:

15 - 0.10q = 2 + 0.04q  
15 - 2 = 0.04q + 0.10q  
13 = 0.14q  
q = 13 / 0.14  
Let me calculate that: 13 divided by 0.14. 0.14 goes into 13 how many times? 0.14 * 92 = 12.88 (since 92 * 0.14=12.88), and 0.12 remains. So 92.857 approximately. But let's compute it accurately.

13 ÷ 0.14 = (13 * 100) /14 = 1300 /14 = 92.8571...

So q* is approximately 92.857. Let me see, perhaps 93 when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Then, the price P* is found by plugging into the demand function: P = 15 - 0.05 * 92.857.

Calculating that: 0.05 *92.857 ≈ 4.64285. So P ≈ 15 -4.64285=10.35715, approximately $10.36.

So the new q* is about 93 and P* is about $10.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which option has q* around 93 and P* around 10.36.

Looking at the options:

Option B: q* = 100, P* =10, tax on profit. No, because it's without the tax.

Option G: q* =70, P* =11.5, nope.

Option B's options are different, so let me check all options.

Wait, the options are A to J, with each having q*, P* and q*, P* with a tax.

Looking at the options:

Option B: q* = 100, P* =10, and then with tax. But that's for part (a) only.

Wait, actually, no. Looking again:

Each option has four values: q*1, P*1, q*, P*, and then with a tax or not.

Wait, the problem says:

a) find the point of profit maximization.

b) find maximum profit if a $1/unit tax is imposed.

So, the options each have q* and P* for part a) and then part b) with a tax.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Looking at the options:

Option B: q* =100, P* =10, q* =93, P* =10.36 with tax.

So that's for part a) and part b). So for part a), it's 100 and 10, and then with tax, the profit is lower.

But wait, without tax, the profit would be (10 - (15 -0.05*100 )) *100. Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, the profit is (P - MC) * q.

Wait, but in part a), without tax, so let's compute the original profit.

Wait, without tax, the MC is 1 + 0.04*100 = 1 +4=5.

So profit is (10 -5)*100=5*100=500.

But with tax, the MC becomes higher.

Wait, so in part b), the new profit would be (P* - new MC)*q*.

P* is 10.36, q* is93.

New MC is 2 + 0.04*93 = 2 +3.72=5.72.

So profit is (10.36 -5.72)*93 = 4.64 *93.

Hmm, let me compute that.

4.64 *93: 4*93=372; 0.64*93=60.72. So total is 372+60.72=432.72.

Wait, but the question says to find the maximum profit with a tax.

But the options in the problem are looking for the new profit.

But the options given for the answer are the same as this, for each option.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Each option lists four values, like q*1, P*1, q*2, P*2, and then with a tax or not.

Wait, no, looking at the way the options are presented:

The options are like:

A: q* =140, P* =8, q* =130, P* =7.36 with tax

B: q* =100, P* =10, q* =93, P* =10.36 with tax

C: q* =110, P* =12, q* =97, P* =11.36 with tax

And so on, up to J.

So option B is q* =100, P* =10, q*=93, P* =10.36 with tax.

Which makes sense because part a) is 100 and 10, part b) is 93 and 10.36, and with a tax.

So the correct option would be option B.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Wait, when the tax is imposed, the new MC is higher, so the firm's optimal q* is lower, and the price is lower. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the point of profit maximization and the maximum profit with a $1/unit tax, we proceed as follows:

### Part (a): Profit Maximization
1. **Demand Function**: \( P = 15 - 0.05q \)
2. **Total Cost Function**: \( TC = q + 0.02q^2 \)
3. **Marginal Revenue (MR)**:  
   \( TR = P \cdot q = (15 - 0.05q) \cdot q = 15q - 0.05q^2 \)  
   \( MR = \frac{dTR}{dq} = 15 - 0.10q \)
4. **Marginal Cost (MC)**:  
   \( MC = \frac{dTC}{dq} = 1 + 0.04q \)
5. **Set MR = MC**:  
   \( 15 - 0.10q = 1 + 0.04q \)  
   \( 14 = 0.14q \)  
   \( q^* = \frac{14}{0.14} = 100 \)
6. **Price at \( q^* = 100 \)**:  
   \( P^* = 15 - 0.05(100) = 10 \)

Thus, without the tax, the firm maximizes profit at \( q^* = 100 \) and \( P^* = 10 \).

### Part (b): Profit Maximization with a $1/unit Tax
1. **New Total Cost Function (including tax)**:  
   The tax effectively increases the marginal cost by $1.  
   \( MC_{\text{new}} = 1 + 0.04q + 1 = 2 + 0.04q \)
2. **Set MR = MC** (with the new MC):  
   \( 15 - 0.10q = 2 + 0.04q \)  
   \( 13 = 0.14q \)  
   \( q^* = \frac{13}{0.14} \approx 92.86 \) (rounded to 93)
3. **Price at \( q^* \approx 93 \)**:  
   \( P^* = 15 - 0.05(93) \approx 10.36 \)
4. **Profit Calculation**:  
   Profit = \( (P^* - MC_{\text{new}}) \cdot q^* \)  
   \( MC_{\text{new}} = 2 + 0.04(93) \approx 5.72 \)  
   Profit = \( (10.36 - 5.72) \cdot 93 \approx 4.64 \cdot 93 \approx 432.72 \)

### Matching with Options
- **Option B**: \( q^* = 100 \), \( P^* = 10 \), \( q^* = 93 \), \( P^* = 10.36 \) with tax.

This matches the calculations for both profit maximization (part a) and profit maximization with a $1/unit tax (part b).
