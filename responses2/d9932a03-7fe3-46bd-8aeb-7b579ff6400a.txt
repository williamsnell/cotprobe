Okay, so I've got this problem about Lisa's small business. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that she had a loss on Monday and a profit on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, it was a loss, and on Thursday, a profit. I need to find the total profit or loss over these four days. The options are given, but I should figure it out myself first.

Alright, so let's break it down day by day. On Monday, there was a loss of $14. Loss means she spent money, so I should represent that as a negative number. Then on Tuesday, she made a profit of $18, which is positive. Wednesday was a loss of $6, again negative. And Thursday, a profit of $7, positive again.

So the sequence is:

- Monday: -$14 (loss)
- Tuesday: +$18 (profit)
- Wednesday: -$6 (loss)
- Thursday: +$7 (profit)

Now, I need to add all these numbers together to find the total. Let me write them down: (-14) + 18 + (-6) + 7.

Hmm, working this out step by step. Let's add Monday and Tuesday first. -14 + 18. That's like subtracting 14 from 18, which leaves me with 4. So after Monday and Tuesday, she's up $4.

Next, adding Wednesday's loss: 4 + (-6) is the same as 4 - 6. That equals -2. So now she's down by $2.

Finally, adding Thursday's profit: -2 + 7 is like adding 7 to -2. That gives me +5. So the total is a $5 profit.

Looking at the options, option E is $5 profit. So the answer should be E.

The total profit or loss is $5 profit.

Answer:

E: $5 profit
