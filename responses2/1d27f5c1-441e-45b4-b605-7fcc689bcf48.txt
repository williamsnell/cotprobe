Okay, so I need to find the energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state. The question says to use the mass of the electron instead of the reduced mass of the hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen has two electrons, but wait, no—hydrogen has just one. Oh right, because the proton is much heavier and acts as the nucleus. So the reduced mass here would be the mass of the electron divided by the mass of the proton, right?

Wait, but the question says to use the electron's mass instead. So that means the reduced mass isn't needed. That's different. I think the formula for the energy levels in hydrogen involves the reduced mass because the more massive the nucleus, the smaller the reduced mass, which affects the energy levels. So if I'm using the electron's mass, the reduced mass is just the electron's mass, because the proton's mass is so much larger that it's negligible and can be ignored.

The energy formula for hydrogen in the ground state is something like E = -13.6 eV * (1/n²), where n is the principal quantum number. For n=1, it's -13.6 eV. But wait, if I'm using the electron's mass instead of the reduced mass, does that affect the energy? Because if the reduced mass is different, the energy might be different.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how the reduced mass affects the energy. Let me think. The energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = - (μ * e^4) / (8 ε0² h² c), where μ is the reduced mass. But if μ is different, the energy changes.

So if I'm using the electron's mass, μ equals m_e, because for the hydrogen atom, μ = (m_e * m_p) / (m_e + m_p). But since m_p is much larger than m_e, μ ≈ m_e. So the reduced mass wouldn't change much, but let's see.

Wait, no. Wait, the reduced mass is (m_e * m_p)/(m_e + m_p). But if we're using m_e, that's the same as the reduced mass when m_p is much larger than m_e. Because m_e << m_p, the denominator is m_p, so μ ≈ m_e. So using the electron's mass is a good approximation.

But wait, the actual energy would be a bit different, but for the purposes of this question, using the electron's mass is acceptable because the proton's mass is so much larger that the effect on the reduced mass is negligible. So for E_n, when using the electron's mass, it's the same as if we used the exact reduced mass. Therefore, the energy is the same as the standard formula.

So the ground state energy is -13.6 eV. But wait, what's the unit here? The options have various units. Let me look at the options.

Option A is -13.61eV. Option C is -2.1802e-18 J. Oh wait, because 1 eV is approximately 1.6e-19 joules. So let me compute what -13.6 eV is in joules.

So 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 13.6 eV is 13.6 *1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that.

13.6 * 1.602e-19 = 21.7992e-19 J. So -13.6 eV is approximately -2.17992e-18 J. Looking at the options, option C is -2.1802e-18 J. That seems to match.

So the correct answer would be option C. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, the standard formula uses μ, the reduced mass. If I use the actual reduced mass, would that affect the energy? Because if I use μ = (m_e m_p)/(m_e + m_p), then the energy would be lower in magnitude because μ is less than m_e. But since the question says to use the electron's mass, I don't have to consider that. So using m_e gives the same energy as the reduced mass approximation. So the energy is -13.6 eV, which is option A, but wait, no, because option A is -13.61eV, which is a bit higher than the standard value. Wait, what's the actual value?

Wait, I think the exact ground state energy is -13.6 eV. Let me think again. Maybe the options are approximations.

Wait, another approach: the ground state energy is E = -13.6 eV for hydrogen. So if I use the electron's mass, the reduced mass is m_e, so the energy is the same as the standard value. So the correct answer is option A: -13.61eV?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute the exact value. So 13.6 eV is the standard value when using the reduced mass. But when using the electron's mass, the reduced mass is m_e, but the actual E would be E = -13.6 eV * (m_e / m_e )? Because if μ is m_e (since m_p is much larger), then E is same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the formula. The formula for E_n is: E_n = - (μ e^4)/(8 ε0² h² c). So μ is the reduced mass. If I use μ = m_e, then the energy is the same as the standard formula. Because in the standard formula, μ is (m_e m_p)/(m_e + m_p) ≈ m_e.

So using m_e instead of the reduced mass, the energy would be the same as the standard value. So the ground state energy is -13.6 eV. So option A is -13.61eV, which is close. So option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again. Option A is -13.61eV, which is very close to the standard value of -13.6 eV. So the correct answer should be option A, because using the electron's mass leads to the same energy as the standard formula.

So the answer is A.

To calculate the energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n = 1) using the mass of the electron rather than the reduced mass of the hydrogen atom, we start by recalling the formula for the energy levels in hydrogen: 

\[
E_n = -\frac{\mu e^4}{8 \varepsilon_0^2 h^2 c},
\]

where \( \mu \) is the reduced mass of the system. For a hydrogen atom, the reduced mass is given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_e m_p}{m_e + m_p},
\]

where \( m_e \) is the mass of the electron and \( m_p \) is the mass of the proton. Since \( m_p \gg m_e \), the reduced mass \( \mu \) is approximately equal to \( m_e \). Therefore, using the electron's mass instead of the reduced mass does not significantly change the energy calculation.

The ground state energy of hydrogen is a standard value of approximately \(-13.6 \, \text{eV}\) when using the reduced mass. Since the question specifies using the electron's mass, the energy remains the same as the standard value. Among the options provided, the closest match is:

- **Option A: -13.61eV**.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it represents the ground state energy of hydrogen using the electron's mass.
