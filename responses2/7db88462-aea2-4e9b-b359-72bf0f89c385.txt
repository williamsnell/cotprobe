Okay, so I have this question about economics and GDP. I need to figure out which of the given events has no effect on GDP. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which event doesn't affect GDP. I remember that GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country in a specific period. So, events that contribute to production within a country would impact GDP, while others might not.

Option A: A college buys computers. Well, computers are produced in a factory, so that's a business investment. Companies invest in machinery, equipment, and technology to produce goods. This would increase GDP because it's a spending on goods (computers) that are part of the economy's production. So, A affects GDP. So A is not the correct answer.

Option B: The Department of Transportation repaves a road. Repaving roads is a public service. Roads are typically government projects. Government spending on infrastructure is considered part of GDP because it's spending by the government on goods and services. So repaving a road would contribute to GDP. So B affects GDP, so B is not the correct answer.

Option C: A city spends money to refurbish a public park. Refurbishing a public park is another expenditure by the city government. Like with the road, this is government spending on public goods. So, this would add to GDP because it's part of the government's budget. So C affects GDP, so C is not the right answer.

Option D: You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend. Hmm. This is a personal transaction. The GDP measures production, not personal consumption. So buying a personal vehicle isn't part of the economy's production output. It's a use of personal spending, not something that affects the value of goods and services produced within the country. So D doesn't impact GDP. That would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes people's personal spending can affect GDP indirectly through the income they receive. For example, someone buying a car might earn some income, which is then considered personal income. But GDP doesn't include personal income. So the purchase itself isn't a business investment, and thus doesn't directly contribute to GDP.

So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D. 

**Explanation:**
GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country. Personal transactions, such as buying a 1957 Chevy, do not contribute to GDP. While they may generate personal income, GDP focuses on production and doesn't include this personal spending. Thus, the purchase of a personal vehicle does not affect GDP.

Answer: D
