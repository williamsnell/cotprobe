Okay, so I've got this question about skewness in a dataset. Hmm, I remember that skewness has to do with the asymmetry of a distribution. Right, positive skewness means the tail on the right side is longer, and negative skewness is the opposite. Oh wait, and if the mean and median are equal, that's a sign of a perfectly normal distribution.

The question gives me six data points: 3, 2, 3.7, 5, 2.7, and 3. Wait, let me list them out in order to better understand. Let's sort them: 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. So six numbers, arranged from smallest to largest.

First, I should calculate the mean. Let's do that. Summing them up: 2 + 2.7 is 4.7, plus 3 is 7.7, plus 3 is 10.7, plus 3.7 is 14.4, plus 5 is 19.4. So mean is 19.4 divided by 6. Let me compute that: 19.4 /6 is approximately 3.233 inches.

Next, the median. Since there are six data points, which is even, the median is the average of the third and fourth values. The third is 3, the fourth is 3. So (3+3)/2 =3. So median is 3.

Wait, the mean was around 3.23, and the median is 3. So the mean is greater than the median. That's interesting. In a perfectly normal distribution, the mean and median are the same, but here they're different.

Now, for skewness, if the mean is greater than the median, and the distribution is skewed right (positive skewness), right? Because the longer tail is on the right. So that would indicate positive skewness.

Alternatively, thinking about the data: looking at the numbers, most are around 3, but there's a 5 and a 2.7. Wait, 5 is higher and 2.7 is lower. So the data has two tails: one on the high end (5) and one on the low end (2.7). The bulk is around 3.

Wait, but is the distribution symmetrical? Let me check. The data points are 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. The distances from the mean would be: 3-2=1, 3-2.7=0.3, 3-3=0, 5-3=2, 3.7-3=0.7, 3-3=0. The distances are 1, 0.3, 0, 2, 0.7, 0. Wait, some distances are higher on the right, some on the left. But does the mean being higher than the median suggest a right skew?

Wait, no. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median. That's correct. So in this case, since the mean is about 3.23 and the median is 3, the data is positively skewed. So the distribution would have a positive skewness.

Looking back at the options, option C is "The distribution is negatively skewed." No, that's the opposite of what we have. Option A is about positive skewness. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait a second, but I should think about the other options. For example, option I says "The distribution has no skewness." But that's only true if mean equals median, which isn't the case here. So that's not right. Option G and J are about multimodal. Let's see: the data has all values unique except for maybe 3. But wait, no, each value is distinct. So there's only one mode—each number occurs once. So the distribution is unimodal. So options G and J which suggest bimodal or multimodal are incorrect.

Option E is uniform. Uniform distributions have all data points the same, which isn't the case here. So E is out.

Option H says "The skewness cannot be determined from the given data." Hmm. Well, sometimes, with small data sets, you might not be able to accurately compute skewness without more information, but in this case, we have all the data points. So I think it's possible to compute it. So H is probably incorrect.

Option D is about being perfectly normal. Well, with six data points, it's unlikely to be perfectly normal. Plus, the mean and median don't match, so it's not normal. So D is incorrect.

So the options left are A, I, or maybe H. Wait, I thought A was about positive skewness. Wait, but wait, the question is about the relative measure of skewness, but the options don't specify whether it's positive or negative. Or perhaps the question is about whether the skewness is determined, not the direction.

Wait, the question is about the relative measure of skewness, which is about whether it's positive, negative, or symmetrical. So, in this case, the mean is higher than the median, so it's positively skewed. So the correct option would be A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought skewness can be determined with certain formulas, but in this case, the question is more about the nature of the distribution. Let me think again.

Wait, the distribution is not symmetric because the mean and median are different. So if the distribution is not symmetric, it's either positively or negatively skewed. Since mean is higher than median, it's positively skewed.

So the correct answer is A, which states the distribution is positively skewed. So Option A is the correct choice.

The question asks about the relative measure of skewness for the given data. The data represents waist measurements, sorted as 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. Calculating the mean (≈3.23) and median (3), we find the mean is greater than the median, indicating a positive skew. This means the distribution is skewed to the right. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: The distribution is positively skewed** is correct because the mean is greater than the median, indicating positive skew.
- Other options are incorrect: B (zero skewness) is wrong; C (negative skewness) is incorrect; D (perfect normality) is incorrect; E (uniformity) is incorrect; F, G, J (bimodal, multimodal, no skewness) are incorrect.
