Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me read it again. The question is asking how many electrons need to be removed from a coin to leave it with a charge of +1.0 ×10^-7 C. The options are from A to J, each with a different number. Hmm, I think I remember something about charge and electrons.

Wait, right. Electrons have a negative charge, so if I remove electrons from the coin, the coin's charge becomes positive. Because the removed electrons carry negative charge, so the coin would have a positive charge equal to the number of electrons removed multiplied by the charge per electron.

So each electron has a charge of -1.6 ×10^-19 coulombs. Oh wait, actually, the elementary charge e is approximately 1.6 ×10^-19 C. I think that's right.

The formula I remember is charge equals number of electrons multiplied by the charge per electron. So charge (q) = n * e. Oh wait, but wait! Since the coin is being given a positive charge, the electrons removed must be such that the total charge is positive. So n is the number of electrons removed, and q is positive.

Wait, but the charge of the coin is q = +1.0e-7 C. So how do I get the number of electrons? Oh right, because each electron contributes a negative charge, so to get a positive charge, you remove electrons. So the number of electrons removed will be the total charge divided by the charge per electron.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Suppose I have a coin with charge -q0. If I remove electrons, each electron has a negative charge. So the coin's charge after removing n electrons would be q = (-q0) + (-n * e). Wait, no, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me think: the coin has a negative charge because electrons are bound to it. So when you remove electrons from it, its charge becomes less negative (so becomes less, but wait, the problem says it's a positive charge? Wait that's confusing.

Wait no, the problem says the charge is +1.0e-7 C. So the coin must have lost electrons, because otherwise, if it had a positive charge already, you couldn't remove more electrons. So the initial charge must be negative. But in the problem, it's giving a positive charge, which suggests that maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the coin's charge as being due to electrons. Let me restate the problem: the coin's charge is +1.0e-7 C. So the coin's charge is positive, which implies it must have lost electrons. Because electrons have negative charge, so the coin becomes positively charged when it loses electrons.

So the number of electrons removed would be the total charge divided by the charge per electron.

Wait, but wait. If the coin's charge is +1.0e-7 C, which is a small positive charge, that implies that the number of electrons removed (n) is equal to the total charge (q) divided by the charge per electron (e), but with a negative sign because the electrons are removed. Wait, no, wait. Since each electron has a charge of -e, the total charge of the coin would be the initial charge minus the charge lost from electrons. Hmm, perhaps I should model it mathematically.

Let me denote the initial charge of the coin as Q_initial. But wait, the problem doesn't give the initial charge, only the final charge. So perhaps I should think that the coin had an initial charge of -n_e * e, and after removing n_e electrons, its charge is +1.0e-7 C.

Wait, maybe that's the way to approach it. Let me define n as the number of electrons removed. So each electron has charge -e. So, the total charge of the coin after losing n electrons would be:

Q = Q_initial + ( -n * e )

But wait, no. Because the initial charge Q_initial is negative (since the coin is negatively charged). Or wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Alternatively, the charge of the coin is the sum of the charge it had before plus the charge of the electrons removed.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the initial charge as being zero, but that's not correct. Oh, no, perhaps I should model it as: the coin has a negative charge because it has electrons bound to it. The number of electrons in the coin is N, so the initial charge is N * (-e). When you remove n electrons, the charge becomes (N - n)*(-e) = - (N - n) e. But the problem says the charge is +1e-7 C. So equating this:

- (N - n) e = 1e-7 C

But then we can't solve for n because N is unknown. So perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial charge is zero, but that's not correct. Or maybe the coin has a certain amount of charge, and when electrons are removed, the charge becomes positive. Oh wait, perhaps the initial charge of the coin is negative, and removing electrons (each with charge -e) makes it less negative. So the change in charge is the number of electrons removed times e.

Wait, no, because electrons contribute to increasing the charge positively. Let me think: if I have a charge of -e, and I remove one electron, the charge becomes zero. So each electron I remove adds e to the charge (since it was negative before).

Wait, but that would mean that the final charge is the initial charge plus (number of electrons removed) * e.

Wait, but the initial charge of the coin is negative, so let me denote the initial charge as Q_initial = -n_e * e, where n_e is the number of electrons originally on the coin.

When you remove n_e' electrons, the final charge is Q_final = Q_initial + n_e' * e.

So substituting:

Q_final = (-n_e * e) + n_e' * e = [n_e' - n_e] * e

But wait, the problem says the final charge is +1e-7 C. So,

[ n_e' - n_e ] * e = +1e-7 C

But I don't know n_e or n_e'. Hmm, this is tricky. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking: how many electrons must be removed to get a charge of +1e-7 C. Since each electron has a charge of -1.6e-19 C, then the number of electrons removed would be the charge divided by the elementary charge (but with a negative sign because the electrons are removed, adding to the positive charge).

Wait no, that can't be right. Because each electron removed contributes -e to the charge. So the total charge is (number of electrons removed) × (-e) = -n_e × e. But the problem states that this charge is +1e-7 C, so:

- n_e * e = +1e-7 C

Which implies:

n_e = - (1e-7 C) / e

Wait, but e is positive, so this would make n_e negative. That's impossible because you can't remove a negative number of electrons. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, wait, perhaps the initial charge is positive, which is not the case here. Because when you remove electrons, you make the charge more positive. But the problem says the final charge is +1e-7 C, which is a small positive number. So perhaps the initial charge was higher than zero, and we're removing electrons to make it positive.

Wait, maybe the initial charge was zero, but that's not correct. Because if the coin is neutral, then removing electrons would make it more positive. But the problem doesn't say the coin was neutral. So perhaps the initial charge is the sum of the charge from electrons in the coin. Oh, but the problem doesn't give the initial charge, only the final.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of it as an equation. Let me denote the number of electrons removed as n. Each electron has a charge of -1.6e-19 C. So the total charge change is n × (-1.6e-19 C) = -n × 1.6e-19 C.

The final charge is the initial charge plus this change. But the problem doesn't tell us the initial charge, only the final. Oh wait, perhaps the initial charge was zero? No, that can't be because then the final would be -n × 1.6e-19 C, but the problem says it's +1e-7 C, which would not match.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without knowing the initial charge. Let me try the equation again.

The final charge is +1e-7 C. Each electron I remove adds (since it's negative) to the charge. So the number of electrons removed is the total charge divided by the charge per electron, but with a negative sign because each electron's charge is negative.

So, n = (1e-7 C) / (1.6e-19 C/electron) ) * (-1), but wait, that would give a negative number, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the equation should be:

n = (charge of coin) / (charge per electron)

But wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try with some substitution.

Let me denote:

Let q be the final charge: q = +1e-7 C.

Each electron removed contributes e = -1.6e-19 C.

So each removed electron adds e to the charge. So to get a positive charge, the number of electrons removed would be q / (-e) multiplied by the number of electrons removed, but since each electron contributes e to the charge, the number of electrons removed would be q / e. But wait, because each contributes e, the total would be q = n * e, where e is the magnitude. So n = q / e.

Wait, let me calculate that.

q = +1e-7 C.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

n = (1e-7 C) / (1.6e-19 C/electron) )

n = (1e-7) / (1.6e-19) ) electrons.

Compute this:

1e-7 = 10^-7

1.6e-19 = 1.6 * 1e-19

So 1e-7 / 1.6e-19 = (1 / 1.6) * (1e-7 / 1e-19) ) = (0.625) * (1e12) ) = 6.25e11 electrons.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option F is 4.5e11, option G is 6.3e11, which is close to what I calculated.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me do it step by step.

1e-7 divided by 1.6e-19.

1e-7 is 1e-7.

1.6e-19 is 1.6e-19.

So 1e-7 / 1.6e-19 = (1/1.6) * 1e12.

1/1.6 is 0.625, so 0.625e12 → 6.25e11.

So n would be 6.25e11, but the options don't have that. The closest option is H:5e11, which is 5e11, and G:6.3e11. Wait, but I think I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I should have considered the absolute value, but no, the calculation seems right. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the absolute value correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1e-7 / 1.6e-19 = (1e-7)/(1.6e-19) = (1/1.6) * 1e12 = 0.625 * 1e12 = 6.25e11.

So the number of electrons is approximately 6.25e11. Looking at the options, the closest is option G:6.3e11.

Wait, but let me look again at the options:

Options:

A:8.5e11

B:7.1e11

C:7.5e11

D:9.2e11

E:3.8e11

F:4.5e11

G:6.3e11

H:5.0e11

I:8.0e11

J:6.9e11

So, 6.25e11 is closest to 6.3e11 which is option G. But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Another approach: the charge q is +1e-7 C. The charge of one electron is e = 1.6e-19 C. So the number of electrons removed is q / e.

Which is (1e-7) / (1.6e-19) = (1 / 1.6 ) * 1e12 = 0.625e12 = 6.25e11.

Which is what I got before. So the answer should be approximately 6.25e11, which is 6.3e11, option G.

Wait, but wait. What if the initial charge was zero? Then, to get a positive charge, you need to remove electrons. So the number of electrons would be 1.0e-7 / (1.6e-19) = same as before, 6.25e11. So that would align.

Wait, but the calculation comes to 6.25e11. So the correct option is G:6.3e11.

Wait, but the options don't have 6.25e11, but option G is 6.3e11, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact calculation.

Wait, 1e-7 is 0.0000001 C.

1.6e-19 is 0.0000000000000000016 C.

Dividing 0.0000001 by 0.0000000000000000016.

Let me compute this as (1e-7) / (1.6e-19) = 1e-7 / 1.6e-19 = (1/1.6) * 1e12 = 0.625e12.

0.625e12 is 6.25e11.

So about 6.25e11, which is 6.25 multiplied by 1e11, which is 6.25e11.

Looking at the options, the closest is G (6.3e11). So the answer should be option G.

To determine how many electrons need to be removed from a coin to leave it with a charge of \( +1.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{C} \), we start by noting that each electron has a charge of \( e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). Removing an electron increases the charge of the coin by \( e \). 

The number of electrons removed, \( n \), is given by the total charge divided by the charge per electron:

\[
n = \frac{q}{|e|} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{C}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C/electron}}
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
n = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-7}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1}{1.6} \times 10^{12} \approx 0.625 \times 10^{12} = 6.25 \times 10^{11}
\]

This result, \( 6.25 \times 10^{11} \), is closest to the value in option G (\( 6.3 \times 10^{11} \)). 

Thus, the correct answer is:
