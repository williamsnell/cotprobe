Alright, so I've got this question about the 'managerial revolution' debate. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about what John Scott (1997) argued in his debate. The options are A to J, each presenting a different point. I need to figure out which one he supported.

First, I should remember what I know about the managerial revolution. From what I recall, the managers during that time were seen as having more control over their businesses than the owners. They believed in their decision-making power and were more proactive in managing rather than letting the shareholders dictate things.

Option A: Managers are becoming dissatisfied with their working conditions and plan to overthrow owners. Hmm, that sounds more like the ' shareholder revolution' or the 'managerial contraction' perspective. I think that's the opposite of what John Scott was arguing. He was against the owners, so A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: Owners still use groups of shareholders and interlocking directorships. That sounds like the shareholder revolution, where big corporations are controlled by a network of shareholders. John Scott, as part of the 'managerial revolution' debate, would have argued against this. So B is probably not the correct choice either.

Option C: Ownership and management are becoming increasingly separate. Wait, that's what I remember. John Scott was against this separation. He thought ownership and management were separate, and that management was becoming more integrated. So C seems to align with his argument.

Option D: The managerial revolution was a myth because owners still hold majority power. I think John Scott was one of the early defenders of the managerial revolution. He believed it wasn't a myth. So D is probably not correct.

Option E: Managers plan to unionize for better conditions. I think that's more of a socialist perspective. John Scott was against that, so E doesn't fit.

Option F: Scientific management is universally applicable. No, the debate focused on whether it's a good system. I think Scott was critical of its limitations. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Management increasingly depends on shareholders. That goes against the managerial revolution. John Scott opposed this, so G is probably not the answer.

Option H: Techniques of scientific management are too efficient and inefficient. I think he pointed out that the techniques were too bureaucratic, making them less effective. So H is in line with his view.

Option I: Owners and managers merge into a single role. That sounds more like the shareholder revolution idea. So I is probably not correct.

Option J: Owners losing control because of management autonomy. That's the opposite of what John Scott said. He supported separation between ownership and management, so J is incorrect.

Looking back at the options, both C and H seem relevant. But wait, John Scott was arguing against the idea of separation. So C and H are both about the separation.

Wait, the question is about what John Scott (1997) argued. So I need to pick between C and H. Let me think again. The question is about the debate about managerials.

I think the correct answer is C: ownership and management becoming increasingly separate. That's the position John Scott was against. He believed that ownership and management were not separate but integrated, and that managers were more proactive in decision-making and management.
