Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about backward conditioning, and I need to figure out what the usual effect is and explain inhibitory conditioning. Let me start by recalling what backward conditioning is. From what I remember, backward conditioning involves taking a conditioned stimulus and associating it with an unconditioned stimulus that was previously paired with the conditioned one. So it's like reversing the usual process.

Wait, the procedure usually involves the researcher first exposing the subject to the unconditioned stimulus (US), then the conditioned stimulus (CS). Then, after removing the CS and exposing the subject to the US again, the CS becomes associated with US, creating a new association. So the CS and US are now linked.

Now, the question is about the usual effect of backward conditioning. I think that backward conditioning usually leads to the conditioned stimulus being irrelevant because the association is reversed. So the CS is now tied to the US, which was previously the unconditioned stimulus. So the conditioned response (AR) is tied to the unconditioned response. That makes the CS less effective because the connection to AR is weak or non-existent. So option E says backward conditioning weakens the unconditioned response, which I think is correct. But wait, the question also mentions the usual effect, which I think is that the conditioned stimulus becomes irrelevant because it's no longer linked to the conditioned response.

Wait, another angle. When you perform backward conditioning, the conditioned stimulus is presented after the unconditioned stimulus. So the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus is no longer effective because it's tied to the unconditioned response. So the CS is no longer learned, so it's irrelevant.

But let me look at the options again. Option E says backward conditioning weakens the unconditioned response. Wait, isn't the unconditioned response the original response that didn't involve the CS? Wait no, in forward conditioning, you have an unconditioned stimulus paired with a neutral stimulus. So forward conditioning leads to a response tied to the unconditioned stimulus. Backward conditioning, by reversing the process, uses the unconditioned stimulus to create an association with the conditioned stimulus, which is then tied to the unconditioned response.

So backward conditioning usually leads to the conditioned stimulus being irrelevant. So E says 'weakens the unconditioned response'. Wait, no. Because the unconditioned response is the original one, which was formed with the US. After backward conditioning, the CS is tied to the US, so the AR would be tied to US. So the CS is no longer used to produce the AR. So the CS is irrelevant, not the unconditioned response. Because the unconditioned response is already the original response, but in backward conditioning, the CS is now tied to the US, which was the original unconditioned stimulus. So the AR is tied to US. So the CS is no longer used because it's tied to the unconditioned response.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In forward conditioning, the US is used to create an association with CS. So the AR is tied to US. In backward conditioning, the US is now used to create an association with CS. So the AR is tied to the CS, which is now linked to the US. So the CS is no longer used to produce the AR. The AR is tied to the US and the CS, but the CS is no longer used. So the CS isn't used anymore, making it irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus is no longer effective because it's now tied to the unconditioned response, so it doesn't produce the desired effect. Therefore, the usual effect is that the CS becomes irrelevant.

Looking at the options:

Option E says 'weakens the unconditioned response.' Wait, the unconditioned response is the original response, which was tied to the US. But in backward conditioning, the CS is tied to the US. So the AR is tied to the US and the CS. So the CS isn't used anymore, so the CS is irrelevant. So option E is probably incorrect because the unconditioned response is the same as in forward, but the CS is now irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the CS is no longer used, so it's irrelevant, making E wrong because it's saying the unconditioned response is weakened, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I should think about the usual effect of backward conditioning. I think the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus is no longer used, so it becomes irrelevant. So option E is wrong because E says 'weakens the unconditioned response,' which is not the case. Instead, the unconditioned response is already there, but the CS is tied to it. So in backward conditioning, the CS is now tied to the unconditioned response, so the CS isn't used anymore, making it irrelevant.

Wait, that would mean the usual effect is that the CS is irrelevant. So looking at the options, option E says backward conditioning weakens the unconditioned response. But that's not correct because the unconditioned response is already the original response, which is tied to the CS in the backward process. So the CS is now irrelevant because it's tied to the unconditioned response, which was originally a US.

Wait, no. Let me think about the process again. In forward conditioning, the US is used to create a CS-AR association. In backward, the US is used to create a CS-AR association by reversing the process. So the AR in backward conditioning is tied to the US. So the CS is no longer used to produce AR; instead, it's tied to the unconditioned response (US), which was the original response. So the CS is no longer used, making it irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the CS is irrelevant, which would be option E or another option.

Wait, option E says 'weakens the unconditioned response.' But the unconditioned response is the same as the original response. So the effect is that the CS is no longer used, making it irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the CS is irrelevant, so the answer should be that the CS becomes irrelevant. So looking at the options, I don't see that exactly. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Backward conditioning weakens the unconditioned response.

Option A: Backward conditioning results in the conditioned stimulus becoming irrelevant.

So option A says the CS is irrelevant. Option E says the unconditioned response is weakened. But in backward conditioning, the unconditioned response is still the same as in forward. The unconditioned response is formed by the US and CS in forward. But in backward, the CS is tied to the US, so the AR is tied to US and CS. So CS isn't used. So the CS is irrelevant.

So the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus is irrelevant. So the correct answer would be option E if the usual effect was that the unconditioned response is weakened. But I thought the usual effect was that the conditioned stimulus is irrelevant. So perhaps I'm muddling the concepts.

Wait, no. Another approach: forward conditioning leads to a response tied to the unconditioned stimulus. Backward conditioning leads to a response tied to the conditioned stimulus, which is why the CS isn't used anymore, making it irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus is irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus is no longer effective, making it irrelevant.

So looking at the options, option E says 'weakens the unconditioned response.' But that's not correct because the unconditioned response is still the same as the original. The unconditioned response is formed by the US and the CS in forward, but in backward, the CS is tied to the US, so the AR is tied to the CS as well as the US. So the CS isn't used, making it irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the CS is irrelevant, so the correct option is A: the conditioned stimulus is irrelevant.

Wait, but the question also asks about inhibitory conditioning. So I should probably address that too. Inhibitory conditioning is when an unconditioned stimulus that was previously paired with a conditioned stimulus is now paired with an unconditioned stimulus, leading to the conditioned stimulus being conditioned to produce the unconditioned response. So the effect is that the conditioned stimulus is no longer used and becomes irrelevant.

Therefore, backward conditioning, which also involves reversing the process, leads to the conditioned stimulus being irrelevant. So I think option A is correct because backward conditioning makes the conditioned stimulus irrelevant.

Wait, but the question is about the usual effect of backward conditioning, which also includes the explanation of inhibitory conditioning. So the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus becomes irrelevant. So A is correct.

Wait, but in the options, option E says 'weakens the unconditioned response.' But considering that in backward conditioning, the US remains the same. The unconditioned response is formed by the US and CS. But in backward, the CS is tied to the US, so the AR is tied to the US and CS. So the CS isn't used. So the usual effect is that the CS is no longer used, making it irrelevant. So the usual effect is that the conditioned stimulus is irrelevant, so option A is correct.

Wait, but the question also talks about the usual effect of backward conditioning, which is that the CS becomes irrelevant. So the answer would be option A.

So putting it all together, the usual effect of backward conditioning is that the conditioned stimulus becomes irrelevant. So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

Backward conditioning involves reversing the usual process by associating an unconditioned stimulus (US) with a conditioned stimulus (CS), which was previously paired with the US. This results in the CS being tied to the US, making it irrelevant because it no longer produces the desired effect. The usual effect of backward conditioning is that the conditioned stimulus becomes irrelevant.

Additionally, inhibitory conditioning occurs when an unconditioned stimulus (US) is paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS), leading to the conditioned stimulus being conditioned to produce the unconditioned response. This is a specific case of backward conditioning, where the CS is no longer used and becomes irrelevant.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Backward conditioning results in the conditioned stimulus becoming irrelevant.**  
  This is correct. In backward conditioning, the CS is tied to the US, making it irrelevant and not used to produce the desired response.

- **B: Backward conditioning is the same as forward conditioning in terms of effectiveness.**  
  Incorrect. Backward conditioning reverses the usual process, while forward conditioning creates an association between an unconditioned stimulus and a neutral stimulus.

- **C: Backward conditioning has no impact on the response to the conditioned stimulus.**  
  Incorrect. Backward conditioning changes the association, making the CS irrelevant.

- **D: Backward conditioning strengthens the response to the conditioned stimulus.**  
  Incorrect. Backward conditioning does not strengthen the CS; instead, it reverses the association.

- **E: Backward conditioning weakens the unconditioned response.**  
  Incorrect. The unconditioned response is formed by the US and CS in forward conditioning, but in backward conditioning, the CS is tied to the US, making it irrelevant.

- **F: Backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning.**  
  Correct. Inhibitory conditioning is a specific case of backward conditioning where the CS is no longer used.

- **G: Backward conditioning is highly effective.**  
  Incorrect. Backward conditioning does not enhance learning or effectiveness.

- **H: Backward conditioning usually leads to excitatory conditioning.**  
  Incorrect. Excitatory conditioning involves an unconditioned stimulus being paired with a conditioned stimulus, which is not the case in backward conditioning.

- **I: Backward conditioning is a procedure where the conditioned stimulus is presented long after the unconditioned stimulus.**  
  Correct. In backward conditioning, the US is presented first, followed by the CS, making the CS irrelevant.

- **J: Backward conditioning enhances the unconditioned stimulus's effect without involving the conditioned stimulus.**  
  Incorrect. The unconditioned response is formed by the US and CS, but in backward conditioning, the CS becomes irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
The usual effect of backward conditioning is that the conditioned stimulus becomes irrelevant, which is best described by **A**. Additionally, inhibitory conditioning is a specific case of backward conditioning.
