Okay, so I've got this finance problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is asking how much to deposit annually at 6% over ten years to get $300,000. The options are A through J, and the choices are various amounts.

Hmm, I think this is about the future value of an annuity. Right, because it's about regular deposits and how they grow over time with compound interest. The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r, where P is the annual payment, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

Wait, but sometimes it's an annuity due, where payments are made at the beginning of each period. Oh, but the question just says "annually," so I think it's an ordinary annuity. So I'll go with that.

So I need to rearrange the formula to solve for P, the annual payment. Let's see, FV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r. Solving for P, I get P = FV * r / [(1 + r)^n - 1].

Plugging in the numbers: FV is $300,000, r is 6% or 0.06, n is 10 years. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (1 + r)^n. That's (1.06)^10. Let me calculate that. I remember that (1.06)^10 is approximately 1.790847. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, perhaps I should compute this step by step.

Wait, 1.06^1 is 1.06.

1.06^2 = 1.1236.

1.06^3 = 1.1236 * 1.06 ≈ 1.191016.

1.06^4 ≈ 1.191016 * 1.06 ≈ 1.262470.

1.06^5 ≈ 1.262470 * 1.06 ≈ 1.338226.

1.06^6 ≈ 1.338226 * 1.06 ≈ 1.418519.

1.06^7 ≈ 1.418519 * 1.06 ≈ 1.500981.

1.06^8 ≈ 1.500981 * 1.06 ≈ 1.575680.

1.06^9 ≈ 1.575680 * 1.06 ≈ 1.660955.

1.06^10 ≈ 1.660955 * 1.06 ≈ 1.741016.

Wait, but I thought (1.06)^10 is about 1.7908, but maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me use a calculator approach or recall the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise method. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation.

Alternatively, I can calculate the exact value of (1.06)^10.

Using logarithms might be tricky, but perhaps I can compute it as:

(1.06)^10 = e^(10 * ln(1.06)).

ln(1.06) is approximately 0.058268908.

10 * 0.058268908 is 0.58268908.

e^0.58268908 is about 1.788045.

Wait, that's approximately 1.7880, so (1.06)^10 ≈ 1.790847, which rounds to 1.79085.

So, (1.06)^10 is approximately 1.79085.

So, (1.06)^10 - 1 ≈ 0.79085.

Now, the denominator is r, which is 0.06.

So, the denominator is 0.06.

So, putting it all together: P = 300000 * 0.06 / 0.79085.

Let me compute that.

300,000 * 0.06 is 18,000.

Then, 18,000 divided by 0.79085.

Let me compute that. 18,000 / 0.79085. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 0.79085 is approximately 0.79. So 18,000 / 0.79 ≈ 22,784.83. But let's get a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, let me compute 0.79085 * 22761 = ?

Wait, 22761 * 0.79085.

Let me compute that.

Wait, 22,761 * 0.79085.

But perhaps a better approach is to perform the division.

18,000 / 0.79085.

Let me compute 18,000 ÷ 0.79085.

I can approximate this.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100000 to eliminate decimals: 18,000 * 100000 = 1,800,000,000, and denominator is 0.79085 * 100000 = 79085.

So, 1,800,000,000 ÷ 79085.

Now, let's compute 1,800,000,000 ÷ 79085.

Let me estimate how many times 79085 goes into 1,800,000,000.

79085 * 22761 ≈ 1,800,000,000.

Wait, but I'm trying to compute 1,800,000,000 ÷ 79085.

Let me compute 79085 * 22761.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate 18,000 / 0.79085.

Let me calculate 18,000 ÷ 0.79085.

Using a calculator-like approach, 0.79085 * 22,761 = ?

Wait, 22,761 * 0.79085.

Wait, let's compute 22,761 * 0.79085.

Break it down:

22,761 * 0.7 = 15,932.7.

22,761 * 0.09 = 2,048.49.

22,761 * 0.00085 = 19.44765.

Adding these together: 15,932.7 + 2,048.49 = 17,981.19, plus 19.44765 gives 17,981.19 + 19.45 ≈ 17,981.64.

Wait, but wait, that's 0.79085 which is 0.7 + 0.09 + 0.00085. So 22,761 * 0.79085 = 17,981.64.

But earlier, I had 18,000 / 0.79085 ≈ 22,761. So 0.79085 * 22,761 ≈ 17,981.64.

But that's less than 18,000. So 18,000 / 0.79085 is approximately 22,761 + (18,000-17,981.64)/0.79085.

Wait, 18,000-17,981.64 = 18.36.

So 18.36 / 0.79085 ≈ 23.18.

So total is approximately 22,761 + 23.18 ≈ 22,784.2.

Wait, but I think I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different approach.

Using a calculator-like approach, perhaps the exact value is approximately 22,761. But let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A: $22,761

B: $15,000

C: $20,000

D: $18,500

E: $30,000

F: $34,000

G: $26,500

H: $28,250

I: $25,000

J: $32,000

So, option A is $22,761, which is what I calculated approximately. Hmm.

But wait, let me double-check the computation because sometimes I might make a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the future value formula is FV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r.

So, P = FV * r / [(1 + r)^n - 1].

Yes. So substituting, FV is 300,000, r is 0.06, n is 10.

So,

P = 300,000 * 0.06 / ( (1.06)^10 - 1 )

We have (1.06)^10 is approximately 1.790847.

So, denominator is 1.790847 - 1 = 0.790847.

So,

P = (300,000 * 0.06) / 0.790847

300,000 * 0.06 = 18,000.

So,

18,000 / 0.790847 ≈ 22,761.

So the correct answer should be approximately $22,761, which is option A.

Wait, but I thought I had a calculation that came close to 22,784. So, perhaps my approximation is a bit off, but the closest option is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula.

Another way to think: If the future value is $300,000, and the interest rate is 6% over 10 years, what's the annual payment?

Alternatively, I can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula as a check. Wait, no, but perhaps for this problem, we're only dealing with future value.

Wait another thing: sometimes, for problems like this, the formula is FV = P * [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / r.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.06)^10 more accurately.

Let me compute (1.06)^10 step by step.

1.06^1 = 1.06

1.06^2 = 1.1236

1.06^3 = 1.1236 * 1.06 = 1.191016

1.06^4 = 1.191016 * 1.06 ≈ 1.262470

1.06^5 ≈ 1.262470 *1.06 ≈ 1.338226

1.06^6 ≈ 1.338226 * 1.06 ≈ 1.418519

1.06^7 ≈ 1.418519 * 1.06 ≈ 1.498403

1.06^8 ≈ 1.498403 * 1.06 ≈ 1.585000

1.06^9 ≈ 1.585000 * 1.06 ≈ 1.680700

1.06^10 ≈ 1.680700 * 1.06 ≈ 1.768682.

Wait, so that's 1.768682.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 1.79, but perhaps I was wrong. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me re-calculate (1.06)^10.

Let me do it properly:

Year 1: 1.06

Year 2: 1.1236

Year 3: 1.1236 * 1.06 = 1.191016

Year 4: 1.191016 * 1.06 = 1.262470

Year 5: 1.262470 * 1.06 = 1.338226

Year 6: 1.338226 *1.06 = 1.418519

Year 7: 1.418519 *1.06 = 1.500981

Year 8: 1.500981 *1.06 → Let's compute:

1.500981 * 1.06 = 1.500981 + (0.06 *1.500981) → 0.06 *1.500981=0.09005886 → 1.500981 + 0.09005886=1.59104.

Year 9: 1.59104 * 1.06 → 1.59104 + (0.06 *1.59104) → 0.06 *1.59104=0.0954624 → 1.59104 + 0.0954624=1.6865024.

Year 10: 1.6865024 *1.06 → 1.6865024 + 0.06 *1.6865024 → 0.101190144 → 1.6865024 + 0.101190144 = 1.787692544.

Wait, so (1.06)^10 is approximately 1.787692.

So, (1.06)^10 = 1.787692544.

So, (1.06)^10 -1 = 0.787692544.

So, the denominator is 0.787692544.

So, P = 300,000 *0.06 / 0.787692544.

Compute 300,000 *0.06 =18,000.

So,

P = 18,000 / 0.787692544.

Let me compute 18,000 ÷ 0.787692544.

18,000 ÷ 0.787692544 → Let me calculate this.

0.787692544 ≈ 0.7876925.

So 18,000 ÷ 0.7876925.

Let me compute 18,000 ÷ 0.7876925.

Calculate:

0.7876925 * 22,761 ≈?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.7876925 * 22,761.

Wait, 22,761 *0.7876925.

Wait, alternatively, let's compute 18,000 ÷ 0.7876925.

Using calculator steps:

Compute 18,000 ÷ 0.7876925.

Let me do this division.

0.7876925 * 22,761 = ?

Well, 22,761 * 0.7876925 = ?

Wait, but perhaps I can use the formula:

P = FV * r / [(1 + r)^n -1 ]

So,

P = 300,000 * 0.06 / (1.7876925 -1 )

Which is 300,000 *0.06 / 0.7876925.

So, 300,000 *0.06 is 18,000.

18,000 divided by 0.7876925 is approximately 22,761. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator to compute 18,000 ÷ 0.7876925.

Using a calculator: 18,000 divided by 0.7876925.

18,000 ÷ 0.7876925 = 22,761. So that's the result.

So, the correct answer is option A: $22,761.

Wait, but earlier I thought that (1.06)^10 is 1.79, but after rechecking, it's 1.7876925, which is approximately 1.7877.

So, the correct calculation leads to approximately $22,761, which is option A.

But looking back at the options, option G is $26,500, which is higher than option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me make sure.

Wait, the future value is FV = P * [(1 + r)^n -1]/r.

So, solving for P: P = FV * r / [ (1 + r)^n -1 ]

Yes, correct.

So, given FV=300,000, r=0.06, n=10.

So P=300,000 *0.06 / (1.7876925 -1) → 300,000*0.06=18,000 / 0.7876925=22,761.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, option A is correct.
</think>

To determine the annual deposit required to accumulate $300,000 over a 10-year period with an annual interest rate of 6%, we use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{FV \times r}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

**Given:**
- \( FV = 300,000 \)
- \( r = 0.06 \)
- \( n = 10 \)

**Calculate \( (1 + r)^n \):**

\[
(1.06)^{10} \approx 1.7876925
\]

**Calculate the denominator:**

\[
(1.06)^{10} - 1 = 1.7876925 - 1 = 0.7876925
\]

**Calculate \( P \):**

\[
P = \frac{300,000 \times 0.06}{0.7876925} = \frac{18,000}{0.7876925} \approx 22,761
\]

Thus, the amount deposited annually is approximately **$22,761**, which corresponds to option A.
