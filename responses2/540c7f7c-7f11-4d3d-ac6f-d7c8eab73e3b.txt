Okay, so I have this psychology question here about Maine's aphorism, right? The question is about how the idea is misunderstood. Hmm, the main point is that the aphorism says "the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract." And the question is asking in what way this is misunderstood.

Wait, I remember that the aphorism comes from Maine's work, but I'm not exactly sure which one. Oh, right, Maine's "Invisible Man" is about progress. Oh, but the specific aphorism in question here is probably from his "Moving from Status to Contract," which I think is about how progress has led to more control and division, not necessarily to an increase in status.

Now, the question is about misunderstanding it. So when people take it literally, like if they see it as a prediction or a statement about society's progress, but that's not the case. Let me think. The original idea is that society's movement has been from being in a certain status to contracting or becoming more divided, perhaps in terms of power and control.

So if someone misunderstands it, they might think it's predicting something about the future of society. Like, instead of saying society is moving from Status to Contract, they might think it's a forecast of what progress would look like in the future. That would make the aphorism a prediction. Or maybe they misinterpret the terms.

Wait, but the options are about how it's misunderstood. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: His concept of status is misrepresented. Well, if the aphorism says progress ends in Contract, but maybe people think it's saying someone's going from Status to Contract, which would be about change in status. So if someone thinks the original idea is about status change, then A would be correct. But I thought the original idea was about movement, not status.

Option B: It is misinterpreted as a prediction. That's another possibility. If the original idea is about society's movement towards less control and division, then taking it literally might mean it's predicting future trends. So people could take it as a statement about what's happening, not as a forecast. So option B would be correct.

Option C: His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems. I don't think that's the case. Maine's ideas were about social progress, so they probably apply to Western systems. Plus, the idea is about progress leading to division, not necessarily legal structures, but that's not the main point here.

Option D: It's incorrectly related to economic progression. Hmm, the aphorism is about society's movement, not specifically economic. So the question is about misinterpretation, not about economic relevance.

Option E: It's taken literally. So if taken literally, it means people think it's a literal statement, not a metaphor. So that's option E.

Option F: His use of 'progressive' is often misconstrued. Maybe people think progressive isn't about moving from Status to Contract. I'm not sure about this. I thought 'progressive' refers to moving towards a better position, but maybe some people use it differently.

Option G: His concept of 'contract' is often misinterpreted. I'm not sure about this one. Contract is a business term, but in the context of Maine's work, 'contract' refers to a division of responsibility, perhaps. So misinterpreting that might be possible.

Wait, going back: the original idea is about society moving from Status to Contract, which means becoming more divided. People might take that literally, thinking it's a literal statement. So option E says it's taken literally. Alternatively, if it's misinterpreted as a prediction, that's option B.

So if someone takes the aphorism as a literal statement, that's E. If they take it as predicting future trends, that's B.

The question is about what is misunderstood. So, the original idea is that society's movement is from Status to Contract. So if someone takes it literally, they take it as a statement about the future, which is a prediction. So option B is correct in that sense.

Alternatively, if someone misunderstands it, they might think it's about the concept of Status, leading to A being correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is which way the aphorism is misunderstood. So the correct answer is that it's misinterpreted as a prediction. So option B.
</think>

The aphorism "the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract" is often misunderstood. If taken literally, it is misinterpreted as a literal statement about the future trends of society, implying a prediction rather than an analysis of the current movement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
