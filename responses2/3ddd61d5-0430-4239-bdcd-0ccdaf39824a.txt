Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the real numbers a, b, and c such that the function f(x + iy) = x² + a y² + y + i(bxy + c x) becomes an analytic function of the complex variable z = x + iy. I'm a bit rusty, so let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for a complex function to be analytic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The function is given in terms of x and y, so I'll need to separate it into its real and imaginary parts. Let me write f(z) as u + iv, where u and v are the real and imaginary parts respectively.

So, the function is x² + a y² + y + i(b x y + c x). Breaking this down:

u = x² + a y² + y   (the real part)
v = b x y + c x      (the imaginary part)

Wait, no, wait. Because in the imaginary part, the term is multiplied by i. So actually, the imaginary part is (b x y + c x) multiplied by i, which would make it v = b x y + c x.

Now, the Cauchy-Riemann equations state that for f(z) = u + i v to be analytic, the partial derivatives must satisfy ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x.

So let me compute the partial derivatives.

Starting with u:
u = x² + a y² + y
∂u/∂x = 2x
∂u/∂y = 2a y + 1

Now for v:
v = b x y + c x
∂v/∂x = b y + c
∂v/∂y = b x

So applying Cauchy-Riemann:

1. ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y: 2x = b x
2. ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x: 2a y + 1 = - (b y + c)

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: 2x = b x

Equation 2: 2a y + 1 = -b y - c

Let me solve Equation 1 first. 2x = b x. Let's rearrange this:

2x - b x = 0 → x (2 - b) = 0

This must hold for all x, so the coefficient must be zero. So 2 - b = 0 → b = 2.

Now substituting b = 2 into Equation 2.

Equation 2 becomes:

2a y + 1 = - (2 y) - c → 2a y + 1 = -2 y - c

Let's rearrange terms:

(2a) y + 1 = (-2) y + (-c)

So for these to be equal for all y, the coefficients must match:

2a = -2 → a = -1

And the constants:

1 = -c → c = -1

So a is -1, b is 2, c is -1.

Looking at the options, let me check. The options are:

A: [2, 2, 2]

B: [-1, 2, -1]

C: [1, 1, 1]

D: [-1, -2, 1]

E: [0, 0, 0]

F: [1, -2, 1]

G: [-2, -1, 2]

H: [-2, 1, -1]

I: [2, 1, -2]

J: [2, -1, 2]

So option B is [-1, 2, -1]. That matches our solution. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the function \(f(x + iy) = x^2 + ay^2 + y + i(bxy + cx)\) is analytic, we apply the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The function is separated into real and imaginary parts as:

- \(u = x^2 + ay^2 + y\)
- \(v = bxy + cx\)

The partial derivatives are:

- \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x\)
- \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 2ay + 1\)
- \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = by + c\)
- \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = bx\)

The Cauchy-Riemann equations are:

1. \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\)
2. \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\)

Substituting the partial derivatives:

1. \(2x = bx\) → \(2 = b\)
2. \(2ay + 1 = -by - c\)

From \(2x = bx\), we find \(b = 2\). Substituting \(b = 2\) into the second equation:

\(2ay + 1 = -2y - c\)

Matching coefficients:

- \(2a = -2 \Rightarrow a = -1\)
- \(1 = -c \Rightarrow c = -1\)

Thus, \(a = -1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -1\). The correct answer is:

**B: [-1, 2, -1]**

B
