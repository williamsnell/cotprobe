Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The setup is that steam is condensing on the outside of a pipe, and cool water is flowing inside. The bulk mean water temperature is 65°F. The water side's coefficient of heat transfer is 300 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. The steam is at 3 inches of mercury absolute pressure, and the steam side coefficient is 1500 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. The pipe is 3/4 inch gauge standard size made of brass with a thermal conductivity of 66 Btu/hr-ft-°F. I need to find the mass flow rate of steam condensed per unit length. The options are from A to J, with various values.

Hmm. I remember that the heat transfer through a pipe can be calculated using the formula for convective heat transfer. But wait, in this case, it's probably a heat exchanger, so maybe it's a heat transfer at both inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but the pipe is a standard size, so maybe it's a thin-walled tube, so the area is the surface area of the pipe.

Wait, the formula I think is Q = (h * A * (T_inside - T_outside)), but wait, the directions of heat transfer. Oh, right, since steam is condensing and water is flowing in, the steam is on the outside, and the water inside is flowing, but the steam is at a lower temperature (since it's condensing), so the steam is at a lower temperature than the water. So, the heat is flowing from the water to the steam, meaning the heat transfer is Q = h * A * (T_water - T_steam). Because for heat transfer, the direction is from hot to cold, so the difference is T_water minus T_steam.

Wait, but the steam is on the outside, and water inside. So, if steam is condensing, the liquid is at a lower temperature than the steam, assuming the water is flowing at the same temperature as its bulk. Wait, but I don't know the water's temperature. Wait, the problem doesn't give that. Oh, so perhaps I can find the water's temperature using the heat transfer equation. Hmm, but wait, I don't have the heat rate, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem involves calculating the heat transfer rate, but I don't have Q, and I'm looking for mass flow rate. But the problem says to calculate the mass flow rate per unit length. So maybe I can use the heat transfer equation and rearrange to find the mass flow.

Wait, but I don't have Q, so perhaps I need to find Q from another equation or find another relation. Alternatively, maybe the heat exchanger equation is applicable, but in this case, it's a simple pipe with heat transfer happening from one surface to another.

Wait, let's think about the heat transfer equation. The heat transfer rate Q is given by Q = h * A * (T_in - T_out), where A is the area. But wait, the "h" values given are for the steam and water sides. Wait, because the steam is on the outside, so the coefficient for the steam side (h_s) is 1500, and the water side coefficient (h_w) is 300. So, when heat flows from the water to the steam, the heat transfer is Q = h_s * A (T_water - T_steam) + h_w * A (T_steam - T_water)? No, wait, that can't be right. Because the steam is on the outside, so the heat is flowing into the steam from the water. So, the heat lost by the water is equal to the heat gained by the steam. So, Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_water * A (T_steam - T_water)? Wait, no, because the water is inside the pipe, so it's flowing in. So, the heat is flowing from the water to the steam. So, the heat lost by the water is equal to the heat gained by the steam. So, the heat transfer equation should be: Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_water * A (T_steam - T_water). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because that would mean h_water is negative, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I should think: the heat lost by the water is Q = h_water * A (T_water - T_steam). The heat gained by the steam is Q = h_steam * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam). Since the steam is condensed, its temperature is lower than the water (assuming the water is flowing at a higher temperature than the steam), so T_steam_steam < T_water.

Hmm, but without knowing T_water, I'm stuck. Unless, wait, maybe the water's temperature is the same as the bulk mean temperature? The problem states the bulk mean water temperature is 65°F. So perhaps T_water is 65°F. That would make sense, because it's the average temperature inside the pipe.

So, if T_water is 65°F, and T_steam is at a lower temperature. So, the heat transfer Q is Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_water * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam). Wait, no, the water is inside, so the heat flow is from the water to the steam. So, Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = heat lost by water. But the heat gained by the steam is the same, so Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_water * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam). Wait, that can't be right because h_water is 300, h_steam 1500. So in that case, this would imply:

1500 * A (65 - T_s) = 300 * A (T_s - T_s), which can't be right because that would make the right side zero, and the left side would be 1500*A*(65-Ts). But that can't be correct because that equation would only hold if Ts = T_s, which is not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the h values mixed up. Because the steam is on the outside, so maybe the heat transfer equation is: Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_water * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam). But that doesn't make sense because h_water is less than h_steam. So, perhaps I'm mixing up the sides.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is: since the steam is on the outside, the heat is flowing from the water to the steam, so the heat transfer equation is Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = heat lost by water. The heat gained by the steam is Q = h_steam * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam). Hmm, but T_steam_steam is the temperature of the steam, which is lower than T_water. So, the heat gained by the steam is Q = h_steam * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam) = Q = h_steam * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam). Wait, that would just be the heat loss from the steam, but that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the heat transfer equation as:

Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_water * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam) → but that would require h_water = h_steam, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

The heat lost by the water is Q_water = h_water * A (T_water - T_steam).
The heat gained by the steam is Q_steam = h_steam * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam).
But that can't be because the heat lost by water is equal to the heat gained by the steam, but the signs would need to be opposite. So, perhaps:

Q_water = h_water * A (T_water - T_steam) = Q_steam = h_steam * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam).

Wait, but that would imply h_water = h_steam, which they are not. So, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat transfer equation is:

Q = Q_water = Q_steam,

so h_water * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_steam * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam).

Wait, but T_steam_steam is the temperature of the steam, which is lower than T_water.

Hmm, but without knowing the steam's temperature, I'm stuck. Wait, but wait, the problem gives the steam pressure, which is 3 inches Hg absolute. So, perhaps I can find the steam's temperature using the ideal gas law? Because for water, if it's a vapor, the pressure is given, and I can find the temperature.

Wait, but the steam is at 3 inches of Hg absolute pressure. Hmm, that's 3 inches of Hg. Let me convert that to Pascals or some standard pressure.

1 inch of Hg is about 3386.39 Pa. So, 3 inches is 3 * 3386.39 ≈ 10159.17 Pa. That's about 10160 Pa, which is roughly 1 atm (since 1 atm is about 101325 Pa, so 10160 is close to 1 atm, but a bit lower). Wait, but wait, the standard atmospheric pressure is about 101325 Pa. So, 3 inches Hg is about 10,150 Pa, which is slightly below 1 atm, so about 0.99 atm.

But perhaps the steam is at a higher pressure than the surrounding? Or maybe the problem is assuming the steam is at the same pressure as the pipe. Wait, but the pipe is made of brass, which isn't likely to change its pressure much, but the steam is at 3 inches of Hg, which is higher than atmospheric pressure. So, perhaps it's the same as the surrounding air's pressure.

Wait, but the problem states the pipe is made of brass, which is a metal, so maybe it's not affected, but perhaps the steam is at a higher pressure, so it's acting as a source of heat.

Wait, perhaps this is about using the steam's temperature to calculate the heat transfer. Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the temperature of the steam using the given pressure. Since the pressure is 3 inches of Hg, which I converted to around 10,159 Pa. Now, assuming that the steam is a saturated vapor, let's find its temperature.

Wait, but how? For that, I'd need to use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, but since it's a vapor, maybe using the steam tables would help. Alternatively, I can use the saturated steam tables. Let's see.

Wait, let me look up the steam tables for 3 inches of Hg absolute pressure. Alternatively, since I can't actually look them up, let me think. At 3 inches Hg, which is about 1 atm (but slightly less), the saturation temperature is around 198.3°C. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the saturation temperature for water at 30 inches of Hg would be higher than at 1 atm. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: since the steam is at 3 inches Hg absolute, which is about 10160 Pa. Let me think about the saturation point for that pressure. For water, the saturation pressure is around 33.8 psi (233.8 kPa) at 100°C, and 1 atm (101325 Pa) at about 374°C. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the numbers. Alternatively, perhaps let's think:

At 101325 Pa, the saturation temperature is about 374°C. At 33.8 kPa (which is about 10160 Pa), the saturation temperature would be lower than 374°C, perhaps around 198.3°C. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 3 inches is higher than 101325 Pa, which is 1 atm. So, higher pressure would correspond to higher temperature. So, if at 1 atm (101325 Pa), the saturation is about 374°C, then at 10160 Pa, which is slightly less than 1 atm, the saturation temperature would be lower, perhaps around 198°C.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but let's proceed. Alternatively, since this could take a lot of time and I'm a bit confused about the exact value, perhaps I can proceed with the assumption that the steam temperature is higher than the water's, but the exact value isn't essential for the calculation because the problem gives the h values and the water's T. Wait, but without knowing the steam's T, I can't proceed. So perhaps I made a mistake in approach.

Wait, maybe the problem involves the use of the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) for heat exchangers, but that's for two-phase flow, but maybe in this case, it's a single pipe. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: I know that the heat transfer equation is Q = h * A (T_diff), but in this case, the direction of heat flow is from the water to the steam. So, the heat transfer equation is Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam) = h_water * A (T_steam - T_steam_steam). But since the heat is losing from the water and gaining by the steam, their Q values are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, but without knowing T_steam, I can't find Q. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves the use of the steam's temperature to find the heat transfer rate, but given that, I'm stuck.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steam is at the same temperature as the pipe, but that doesn't make sense because it's condensing.

Wait, maybe I should consider the fact that the pipe is made of brass, which has a high thermal conductivity. Maybe the heat transfer is through conduction, but the problem likely refers to convection because it's a pipe with steam inside and water outside.

Wait, but the question states it's a pipe, so it's probably convection heat transfer. So, the heat transfer is via convection from the pipe's inner surface (steam) and outer surface (water).

So, then the formula would be (for each surface):

Q = h * A (T_difference)

Assuming that the pipe is thin-walled, so the area is the surface area.

But since the pipe is 3/4" gauge, which I think is the wall thickness. So, the surface area would be the circumference times the length, but since we're looking for mass flow rate per unit length, perhaps the length cancels out.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the mass flow rate per unit length, so the length L is probably in the denominator. So, perhaps Q is expressed as (h * A) * (T_diff) = (h * (2πr L) ) * (T_diff) = (h * 2π r L) * (T_diff) ), so mass flow rate m_dot = Q / (h * 2π r L) ) → the L cancels. So, m_dot = (h * 2π r) * (T_diff) ) / (2π r L * h) ) → wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The mass flow rate is m_dot = (Q * L) / (h * A), where A is the area (the surface area of the pipe). But A = 2π r L (since it's a thin-walled cylinder). So, Q = h * A * (T_in - T_out). So,

m_dot = (h * 2π r L) (T_in - T_out) * L ) / (2π r L) ) → Simplify:

m_dot = (h * 2π r L * (T_in - T_out) * L) ) / ( 2 π r L ) )

Canceling terms:

m_dot = (h * (T_in - T_out) * L^2 ) / (L ) → m_dot = h * (T_in - T_out) * L.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should rearrange for m_dot:

Q = m_dot * (h * A) → m_dot = Q / (h * A )

But Q = (h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam )) → m_dot = (h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam )) / (h_steam * A ) → m_dot = T_water - T_steam.

Wait, that can't be right because the mass flow rate would be T_water - T_steam, but that's in °F. But the options are in lbm/hr-ft, so perhaps I'm missing the proper units.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think about the equation again.

The heat transfer is Q = h (A) (T1 - T2), where T1 is the incoming temperature and T2 is the outgoing. But in this case, A is the area of the pipe.

Wait, but m_dot is the mass flow rate. So, m_dot = Q / (h * A )

So,

m_dot = (h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam )) ) / (h_steam * A )

The h_steam and A cancel, leaving m_dot = (T_water - T_steam) → but this gives the mass flow rate in terms of temperature difference, but the units are in °F, which is inconsistent with the lbm/hr-ft. So perhaps I'm missing the conversions.

Wait, but perhaps I should express the heat transfer in terms of the temperatures in °R (since the formula uses absolute temperatures), because the heat transfer formula is Q = h * A (T_abs1 - T_abs2).

So, perhaps I should compute the heat transfer using the correct absolute temperatures.

So, the problem states that the water is at 65°F (which is 65 + 459.67 ≈ 524.67 °R), but the steam's temperature is higher than that. Wait, no, wait, the steam is at 3 inches Hg, which is about 10159 Pa. Using the ideal gas law, for a saturated vapor, the pressure is 10159 Pa, which is 3 inches Hg. So, the saturation temperature is, as I thought earlier, around 198.3°C. Wait, that seems quite high, but perhaps correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the actual value.

Wait, another approach: using the steam tables, at 3 inches Hg absolute pressure, the saturation temperature is approximately 198.3°C. So, the temperature of the steam is 198.3°C (471.47 K). The water inside the pipe is at 65°F, which is 524.67 K.

Wait, but that makes sense, because the steam is hotter than the water. So, the heat flow is from the water to the steam.

So, now, the heat transfer equation would be:

Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam )

But A is the area of the pipe. Since the problem asks for the mass flow rate per unit length, perhaps L is the length of the pipe. So, Q = h_steam * A * (T_water - T_steam ) = h_steam * (2 π r L) ) * (T_water - T_steam )

So, m_dot = Q / (h_steam * A )

= [ h_steam * 2 π r L (T_water - T_steam ) ] / ( h_steam * 2 π r L )

Simplifying:

m_dot = (T_water - T_steam )

But the units of T_water in °F is in the numerator, but the mass flow rate is in lbm/hr-ft. Wait, but how are the units related?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Because the mass flow rate is expressed in terms of (T_water - T_steam), which is in °F, but the options are in lbm/hr-ft, which is in lbm/(hr·ft). The units don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should express the heat transfer in terms of the absolute temperatures. So, T_water in °F is 65 + 459.67 = 524.67 °R. T_steam is at 3 inches Hg, which is 10159 Pa, and the saturation temperature for that pressure is around 198.3°C, which is 198.3 + 459.67 = 657.97 °R.

So, the absolute temperature of the steam is 657.97 °R.

The heat transfer equation is Q = h_steam * A (T_water_abs - T_steam_abs )

So,

A = 2 π r L (since the pipe is thin-walled)

So, Q = h_steam * 2 π r L (T_water_abs - T_steam_abs )

Then, m_dot = Q / (h_steam * A ) = [ h_steam * 2 π r L (T_water_abs - T_steam_abs) ] / (h_steam * 2 π r L )

Simplifies to m_dot = (T_water_abs - T_steam_abs )

Which is (657.97 - 657.97) = 0. That can't be right. So, I made a mistake in this approach.

Hmm, perhaps I shouldn't have considered the area. Wait, because when you're calculating the mass flow rate per unit length, the area cancels out. Let me think again.

Wait, the mass flow rate per unit length (m_dot per L) is:

m_dot = (Q) / (A * L )

But Q = h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam )

So,

m_dot = [h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam ) ] / (A * L )

Which simplifies to:

m_dot = [h_steam * (T_water - T_steam ) ] / L

Wait, but that doesn't help because L is in the denominator. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat transfer using the correct formula and then find the mass flow rate.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the mass flow rate, so perhaps I need to find Q in terms of the given variables, then express m_dot as Q divided by some area.

Wait, let me try another angle. The thermal resistance (R) of the pipe would be (1/(h_steam * A)) + (1/(h_steam * A)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using the formula for convective heat transfer:

Q = (h * A) (T1 - T2)

But for a pipe, the effective area would be the surface area. So, the surface area of the pipe is 2 π r L (assuming L is the length). So, the area A = 2 π r L.

So, Q = h * (2 π r L) ) (T1 - T2 )

But the mass flow rate is related to the heat transfer by Q = m_dot * (h * (2 π r L) )

So, m_dot = Q / (h * (2 π r L) )

But Q also equals h * (2 π r L) ) (T1 - T2 ), so substituting:

m_dot = [h * (2 π r L ) (T1 - T2 ) ] / [h * (2 π r L) ]

Which simplifies to m_dot = T1 - T2.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because T1 and T2 are in °F, and mass flow rate is in lbm/hr-ft. So, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to calculate (T1 - T2) in °R and use that to find the mass flow rate per unit length.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because the units don't match.

Wait, perhaps the answer is (657.97 - 657.97) = 0, which can't be right. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the heat transfer using the log mean temperature difference for a pipe, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the thermal resistance of the pipe, but without knowing the material's properties, this seems impossible.

Wait, but the problem gives the thermal conductivities of brass, which is 39.9 W/(m·K) at 20°C, but perhaps they're using the log mean temperature difference for the pipe.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I should move on and try to think of the formula for the thermal resistance of a pipe and see if that can help.

The thermal resistance R of a pipe (for conduction) is given by:

R = (L) / (h * A )

Where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and L is the length.

But in this case, the heat is convection, so R is the resistance due to convection. However, the problem is that I don't know L or h.

Wait, but perhaps I can find h using the steam's temperature. So, perhaps I can find h_steam from the steam tables.

But the problem states that the pressure is 3 inches Hg, which is 10159 Pa. So, the saturation temperature for that pressure is about 198.3°C, which is 657.97 K.

Wait, but how do I find h_steam? Well, h_steam is the enthalpy of the steam at 10159 Pa and 657.97 K.

But without a steam table, I can't find h_steam. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without the steam's temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by assuming that the heat transfer is determined by the difference in the water and steam temperatures, and that the mass flow rate is found using the formula:

m_dot = (Q) / (h * A)

But since Q = (h_steam * A) (T_water - T_steam ), substituting:

m_dot = (h_steam * A * (T_water - T_steam )) / (h_steam * A) ) → m_dot = T_water - T_steam.

But this is in °F, and the options are in lbm/hr-ft, so perhaps I should convert.

Wait, let me try that. So, if T_water is 65°F, and T_steam is 657.97°F, then T_water - T_steam is -592.97°F. But mass flow rate can't be negative, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the absolute temperatures. So, T_water_abs = 524.67 °R, T_steam_abs = 657.97 °R. The difference is 133.3 °R.

So, m_dot = 133.3 °R.

But the options are in lbm/hr-ft. So, perhaps I need to relate this to lbm/hr/ft.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Perhaps I should consider that 133.3 °F is equivalent to a certain amount in terms of heat transfer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to calculate the mass flow rate using the heat transfer equation, assuming that the pipe is thin-walled and the area is the surface area.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute Q using the steam's temperature and then find m_dot.

But without knowing the steam's temperature, I can't compute Q. So, perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the difference in the water and steam temperatures, regardless of the actual values, and proceed to find the mass flow rate in terms of a function of these temperatures.

But that doesn't make sense because the options don't include such dependence.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula:

m_dot = (Q) / (h * A)

But Q is calculated as (h_steam * A * (T_water - T_steam )).

So, substituting, m_dot = (h_steam * A (T_water - T_steam )) ) / (h_steam * A ) → m_dot = T_water - T_steam.

But again, this gives m_dot in °F, but the options are in lbm/hr-ft, so I'm missing a conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the heat transfer Q in terms of the absolute temperatures and then relate it to the mass flow rate.

Wait, let's proceed, assuming that the heat transfer occurs via convection from the pipe's inner surface (steam) and outer surface (water).

So, the heat transfer per unit length (m_dot) would be:

m_dot = (Q) / (h * A )

But Q = h_steam * A (T_water_abs - T_steam_abs )

So,

m_dot = (h_steam * A (T_water_abs - T_steam_abs )) ) / (h_steam * A )

Simplifying, m_dot = (T_water_abs - T_steam_abs )

So, m_dot = (652.67 - 657.97) = -5.3 °F? That can't be right, because mass flow rate can't be negative. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used absolute temperatures, so:

T_water_abs = 65 + 459.67 = 524.67 °R
T_steam_abs = 657.97 °R

So, the difference is 133.3 °R.

So, m_dot = 133.3 °R.

But the question asks for the mass flow rate per unit length, so 133.3 °R per unit length.

But the options are in lbm/hr-ft, which is different units. So, perhaps I should convert 133.3 °R to lbm per hour per foot.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to do that without knowing the conversion factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to the answer by using the steam's temperature and the given values, but I'm not confident in the approach.

But given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the correct answer is option B: 3.5 lbm/hr-ft.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the mass flow rate per unit length of a pipe where steam condenses at the inner surface and water flows at the outer surface. The heat transfer is driven by convection, and the mass flow rate is determined using the formula for convective heat transfer:

\[
Q = h \cdot A \cdot (T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}})
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the heat transfer rate,
- \( h \) is the convective heat transfer coefficient,
- \( A \) is the surface area of the pipe,
- \( T_{\text{in}} \) is the inner surface temperature (steam),
- \( T_{\text{out}} \) is the outer surface temperature (water).

The mass flow rate per unit length (\( \dot{m} \)) is given by:

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{Q}{A}
\]

Substituting \( Q \) into the equation for \( \dot{m} \):

\[
\dot{m} = \frac{h \cdot A \cdot (T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}})}{A} = h \cdot (T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}})
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\dot{m} = h \cdot (T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}})
\]

The values provided in the problem are:
- \( T_{\text{in}} = 65^\circ \text{F} \) (steam),
- \( T_{\text{out}} = 657.97^\circ \text{F} \) (water),
- \( h = 198.3^\circ \text{C} \) (steam).

Converting \( T_{\text{in}} \) and \( T_{\text{out}} \) to absolute temperatures:
- \( T_{\text{in}} = 65^\circ \text{F} + 459.67 = 524.67^\circ \text{R} \),
- \( T_{\text{out}} = 657.97^\circ \text{R} \).

The temperature difference is:

\[
T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}} = 524.67 - 657.97 = -133.3^\circ \text{R}
\]

However, the mass flow rate cannot be negative, so there must be an error in the approach. Re-evaluating the problem, the correct approach should involve using the given values and the correct formula for convective heat transfer. The final answer, after re-evaluating the problem and considering the provided options, is:
