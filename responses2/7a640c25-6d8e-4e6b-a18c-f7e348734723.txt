Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of [ln(1+x) - x] divided by x squared. The question suggests using L'Hôpital's rule and also to perform a Taylor expansion on both numerator and denominator. Hmm, let me start by understanding each method.

First, let's look at L'Hôpital's Rule. The given limit is as x approaches 0. Plugging in 0, the numerator becomes ln(1+0) - 0 = 0, and the denominator is 0 squared, which is 0. So we have a 0/0 indeterminate form. That means L'Hôpital's Rule applies here.

So, according to L'Hôpital's Rule, we can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator and then take the limit again. Let's compute those derivatives.

The derivative of the numerator, ln(1+x) - x, is (1/(1+x)) - 1. The derivative of the denominator, x squared, is 2x. So the limit becomes:

lim(x→0) [(1/(1+x) - 1) / (2x)].

Simplify the numerator: 1/(1+x) - 1 = (1 - (1+x))/(1+x) = (-x)/(1+x). So the expression becomes:

lim(x→0) [ (-x)/(1+x) ] / (2x) = lim(x→0) (-x)/(1+x) * 1/(2x) = lim(x→0) (-1)/(1+x) * (1/2).

As x approaches 0, (1+x) approaches 1, so this simplifies to (-1/2) * (1/2) ? Wait, no. Wait, let me compute again.

Wait, it's (-x)/(1+x) times 1/(2x). So the x terms: x in numerator and x in denominator. So x/x is 1, so we're left with (-1)/(1+x) * 1/2. As x approaches 0, this becomes (-1)/(1) * 1/2 = -1/2. So the limit is -1/2. So according to L'Hôpital's Rule, the limit is -1/2. So that's one way.

Now, the question also says to evaluate it using a Taylor expansion. Let's do that.

First, let's expand ln(1+x) as a Taylor series around x=0. The Taylor series for ln(1+x) is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... So ln(1+x) - x would be (x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...) - x = -x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... So the numerator is approximately -x²/2 when x is near 0.

The denominator is x squared. So when we take the ratio, the numerator is O(x²) and the denominator is x², so the ratio should approach a constant. The leading term is -x²/2 divided by x², which is -1/2. So again, the limit is -1/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is -1/2. So that's what I get using both methods.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the Taylor expansion.

Wait, ln(1+x) is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 + ... So ln(1+x) minus x is indeed (-x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 + ...). So when x approaches 0, the leading term is -x²/2. Then the numerator is approximately -x²/2, and denominator is x². So the ratio is (-x²/2)/x² = -1/2. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, using L’Hospital's Rule, we found the same result. So the limit is -1/2, which is option H.

To evaluate the limit
$$
\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\ln (1+x)-x}{x^2},
$$
we can use L'Hôpital's Rule and Taylor series expansion.

**Using L'Hôpital's Rule:**
1. At \( x = 0 \), the numerator \( \ln(1+x) - x \) becomes 0, and the denominator \( x^2 \) also becomes 0, resulting in the indeterminate form \( \frac{0}{0} \).
2. Applying L'Hôpital's Rule, we differentiate the numerator and denominator:
   - Derivative of the numerator: \( \frac{d}{dx} [\ln(1+x) - x] = \frac{1}{1+x} - 1 \).
   - Derivative of the denominator: \( \frac{d}{dx} [x^2] = 2x \).
3. The new limit becomes:
   $$
   \lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{1+x} - 1}{2x}.
   $$
4. Simplify the numerator:
   $$
   \frac{1}{1+x} - 1 = \frac{1 - (1+x)}{1+x} = \frac{-x}{1+x}.
   $$
5. Substitute back:
   $$
   \lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{-x}{(1+x) \cdot 2x} = \lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{-1}{2(1+x)}.
   $$
6. As \( x \to 0 \), \( 1+x \to 1 \), so the limit is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).

**Using Taylor Expansion:**
1. Expand \( \ln(1+x) \) as a Taylor series around \( x = 0 \):
   $$
   \ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \cdots.
   $$
2. Subtract \( x \) from the expansion:
   $$
   \ln(1+x) - x = -\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \cdots.
   $$
3. The numerator is approximately \( -\frac{x^2}{2} \) for small \( x \).
4. The denominator is \( x^2 \).
5. The ratio becomes:
   $$
   \frac{-\frac{x^2}{2}}{x^2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   $$

Both methods yield the same result: the limit is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).
