Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about tongue rolling ability in students and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me think this through step by step.

The problem states that the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene. So, if a student has at least one dominant allele (let's say 'D'), they can roll their tongue. The recessive allele, which doesn't allow them to roll their tongue, is 'd'. 

Now, 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. That means they have the recessive genotype, which would be 'dd'. The question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele (Dd).

Hmm, I remember that in Mendelian genetics, when dealing with dominant and recessive traits, the ratio of phenotypes in a population is determined by the genotypes. Since the students are in a school, I assume this is a population where the gene is dominant at the locus in question.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of students who are heterozygous. So I need to find the frequency of the Dd genotype in the population.

I've learned about a method using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The Hardy-Weinberg equations are p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (D) and q is the recessive (d). The terms represent the frequencies of the homozygous dominant (p²), heterozygous (2pq), and homozygous recessive (q²) genotypes.

We know that 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (q² = 0.16). To find q, I take the square root of 0.16. Let's see, sqrt(0.16) is 0.4 because 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16. So q is 0.4.

Since p + q = 1 (because all alleles are either dominant or recessive), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Now, the heterozygous frequency is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's calculate that:

0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24, then multiply by 2 gives 0.48. So 48% of the students are heterozygous.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up any terms. The percentage who are heterozygous is 48%. Let me cross-check. 

Another way: the total percentage is 100%. The recessive (q²) is 16%, heterozygous (2pq) is 48%, and the dominant (p²) is 64% (since 0.6^2=0.36, which is 36%). 36 +48 +16 = 100, which adds up correctly. 

So the correct answer should be 48%, which is option G.

To determine the percentage of students who are heterozygous for the dominant gene (D), we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The recessive allele (d) has a frequency of 16%, so the frequency of the recessive genotype (q²) is 0.16. Taking the square root gives q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, p = 0.6. The heterozygous frequency (2pq) is calculated as 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. This matches option G. 

Answer: G
