Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which set of integers is in order from least to greatest. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question provides several options labeled A through J. Each option is a list of integers. I need to determine which one is arranged in ascending order—that is, from the smallest number to the largest.

I remember that when numbers are in order from least to greatest, each subsequent number is larger than the one before it. So I should compare each option and see which one follows that rule.

Let's list out all the options again to make it clear:

A: 11, −9, 7, −6, −3
B: 7, 11, −6, −3, −9
C: −3, 7, −9, −6, 11
D: −6, −3, 7, 11, −9
E: −9, −3, 7, 11, −6
F: −3, −6, 7, 11, –9
G: −9, 7, −6, −3, 11
H: −9, −6, −3, 7, 11
I: 11, 7, −3, −6, −9
J: 7, −9, −6, −3, 11

Wait, hold on. Looking at option F, the numbers are −3, −6, 7, 11, –9. That seems odd because −6 is less than −9. So −6 is greater than −9. Wait, no, in numbers, −6 is higher than −9 because it's to the right on the number line. So in the correct order, −9 comes before −6, which comes before −3. So F's sequence is: -3, then next is -6, which is less than -9. So that would be wrong. Because in the correct order, -9 should come first, then -6, then -3.

Let me think about each option.

Option G: −9, 7, −6, −3, 11. Let's line them up:

-9 is first, then 7, then −6, then −3, then 11. Wait, is -6 less than -3? Yes, because -6 is to the left of -3 on the number line. So -6 is less than -3. So after 7 comes −6, then −3. Then 11. But wait, in G, after 7 comes -6, which is correct, but then comes -3, which is correct too. So G is in order: -9, 7, -6, -3, 11. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me check other options as well.

Option C: -3,7,-9,-6,11. Let me see: Starting at -3. Next is 7. Then -9, which is less than 7. So that's correct, but then -9 is followed by -6, which is correct, but then 11. So the order would be -3,7,-9,-6,11. Wait, but -9 is less than -6, so the order after -3 is 7, then -9. That's correct. So C is in order: -3,7,-9,-6,11. Hmm, that's another correct sequence. Wait, but I thought G was correct as well.

Wait, perhaps I need to check each option's order.

Option H: −9, −6, −3, 7, 11. That's in order. Starting with -9, then -6, then -3, then 7, etc. So that's correct.

Option B: 7,11,−6,−3,−9. That's not right because after 11 comes -6, which is less than 11. So that's incorrect.

Option D: −6, −3, 7, 11, −9. Wait, -6 comes after -9 in H, but here, D starts with -6, which is higher than -9. So that's wrong.

Option F: −3, −6, 7, 11, −9. Wait, −6 is less than −9, so the order after -3 is -6, which is less than −9. So that's incorrect. Because in the correct order, −9 comes before −6.

Option J: 7,−9,−6,−3,11. After 7 comes -9, which is correct. Then -6, which is correct, then -3, then 11. So that's correct. So J is in order.

Wait, but then we have multiple options that seem correct. Or did I miss something?

Wait, let's check each option again.

Option A: 11, −9,7,−6,−3. That's 11, then -9 (which is low), then 7, then -6 (higher than -9), then -3 (higher than -6). So the order is 11, -9, 7, -6, -3. That's not in order because after -9, 7 is next, which is correct, but then -6 comes after 7, which is lower than 7, so that's correct. But where does -3 fit? After -6. So the order is correct for the numbers, but wait, no, because -9 is less than -6, which is less than -3. So the correct order should have -9 first, then -6, then -3. But in option A, after 7, it jumps to -6 and then -3. So the order is 11, then -9, then 7, then -6, then -3. So that's correct only if the order is 11, -9, 7, -6, -3. Which is correct. Wait, but that's because -9 is less than 7, which is less than -6, which is less than -3. So the sequence is correct in terms of numbers, but the way it's arranged is from least to greater. Wait, no, the numbers themselves are in order, but the order in the option may not be. Oh wait, the question is about the set being in order from least to greatest. So the numbers in each option should be in increasing order.

Wait, perhaps I should list the sequence of numbers in each option and see if they are in increasing order.

Let me go through each option step by step.

Option A: 11, -9, 7, -6, -3
Check the order: Are each numbers after the first greater than the previous?
11 > -9? Yes.
-9 >7? No. So this option is incorrect.

Option B:7,11,-6,-3,-9
Check: 7 <11. Then 11> -6, which is correct. -6 < -3? Correct? No, because -6 is less than -3. So -6 comes after 11. So 11, -6: 11 is larger, so B is incorrect.

Option C: -3,7,-9,-6,11
Check each step: -3 <7: correct. 7> -9: correct. -9 < -6: correct. -6 <11: correct. So each next number is larger than the previous. So option C is correct.

Option D: -6, -3,7,11,-9
Check each step: -6 < -3: correct. -3 <7: correct. 7<11: correct. 11> -9: correct. So D is correct. Wait, but is that right? Because -6, then -3: correct. Then 7: correct. Then 11, then -9. But the way the option lists, after 11 comes -9, which is correct. So D is in order.

Wait, but I thought option H was correct.

Option E: -9, -3,7,11,-6
Check each step: -9 < -3: correct. -3 <7: correct. 7 <11: correct. 11 >-6: correct. So E is correct.

Option F: -3, -6,7,11,-9
Check each step: -3 > -6? No, because -6 is less than -3. So in the sequence, -3 comes before -6, which is not correct. So F is incorrect.

Option G: -9,7,-6,-3,11
Check each step: -9 <7: correct. 7> -6: correct. -6 < -3: correct. -3 <11: correct. So G is correct.

Option H: -9, -6, -3,7,11
Check each step: -9 < -6: correct. -6 < -3: correct. -3 <7: correct. 7 <11: correct. So H is correct.

Option I: 11,7,-3,-6,-9
Check each step: 11>7: correct. 7> -3: correct. -3 < -6: No, because -6 is less than -3. So I is incorrect.

Option J:7, -9, -6, -3,11
Check each step: 7 > -9: correct. -9 < -6: correct. -6 < -3: correct. -3 <11: correct. So J is correct.

So now, which options are correct? Let's recap:

Option C: correct.
Option D: correct.
Option E: correct.
Option G: correct.
Option H: correct.
Option J: correct.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in evaluating option B and E.

Wait, in option D, sequence is -6, -3,7,11,-9. So after 11, it goes to -9. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about which of these are in order.

Wait, perhaps I should arrange each option's numbers in order and see if they match any of the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to list all the options and determine which one is in increasing order.

But I think I made a mistake in evaluating some options.

Wait, let's do this again.

Option A: 11, -9,7,-6,-3. Let's see the order: 11 is first. Next is -9, which is less than 11, so incorrect.

Option B:7,11,-6,-3,-9. 7 is first, then 11 (correct), then -6 (which is less than 7, so incorrect).

Option C: -3,7,-9,-6,11. Let's see: -3 is first, then 7 (correct), then -9 (less than 7), next -6 (correct), then 11 (correct). So the numbers are in order: -3 <7, 7> -9 (so correct), -9< -6 (correct), -6 <11 (correct). So C is correct.

Option D: -6, -3,7,11,-9. -6 < -3 (correct), -3 <7 (correct), 7 <11 (correct), 11 >-9 (correct). So D is in order.

Option E: -9, -3,7,11,-6. -9 < -3 (correct), -3 <7 (correct),7 <11 (correct), 11 >-6 (correct). So E is correct.

Option F: -3, -6,7,11,-9. -3 >-6 (incorrect), so F is incorrect.

Option G: -9,7,-6,-3,11. -9 <7 (correct), 7 >-6 (correct), -6 >-3 (correct), -3 <11 (correct). So G is correct.

Option H: -9, -6, -3,7,11. All in order, correct.

Option I: 11,7,-3,-6,-9. 11>7 (correct), 7> -3 (correct), -3 < -6 (incorrect), so I is wrong.

Option J:7, -9, -6, -3,11. 7 >-9 (correct), -9 < -6 (correct), -6 < -3 (correct), -3 <11 (correct). So J is correct.

So options C, D, E, G, H, J are correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which set is in order from least to greatest. So perhaps only one of these is the correct answer. But the options are labeled A to J, and the question gives options A to J, each with a different set.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating some options. Let me go through each again.

Option C: -3,7,-9,-6,11.

Check each step:

-3 is first. Next is 7, which is higher than -3: correct.

7 is next. Then -9: 7 >-9: correct.

-9 is next. Then -6: -9 < -6: correct.

-6 next. Then 11: correct.

So yes, C is correct.

Option D: -6, -3,7,11,-9.

-6 < -3: correct.

-3 <7: correct.

7 <11: correct.

11 >-9: correct.

So D is correct.

Option E: -9, -3,7,11,-6.

-9 < -3: correct.

-3 <7: correct.

7 <11: correct.

11 >-6: correct.

So E is correct.

Option G: -9,7,-6,-3,11.

-9 <7: correct.

7 >-6: correct.

-6 >-3: correct.

-3 <11: correct.

So G is correct.

Option H: -9, -6, -3,7,11.

All in order, correct.

Option J:7, -9, -6, -3,11.

7 >-9 (correct), -9 < -6 (correct), -6 < -3 (correct), -3 <11 (correct). So J is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which is in order from least to greatest. So that would be each option that is in increasing order.

But the question is which set is in order from least to greatest. So perhaps each option is a different set, and I need to pick the one that's the correct sequence.

Wait, perhaps the question is to pick the correct option, which is among A to J, each representing a different set.

Wait, but the correct answer is supposed to be one of the options. So perhaps I should look for the option where the numbers are in the right order.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's sequence in order.

Wait, let me list all the numbers in each option.

Option C: -3,7,-9,-6,11.

Wait, let's arrange them in order: -9, -6, -3,7,11. So the correct order is -9, -6, -3,7,11. Which is option H.

So if the correct order is H: -9, -6, -3,7,11, then H is the correct option.

Wait, but in option C, the numbers are arranged as -3,7,-9,-6,11, which is not in order because -3 is greater than -9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, because -3 is greater than -9, so -9 comes first, then -6, then -3, then 7, then 11. So the correct order would be -9, -6, -3,7,11. Which is option H.

So option H is the correct sequence.

But earlier, I thought option C is correct, but I think I made a mistake there.

Wait, let me check again.

Option C: -3,7,-9,-6,11.

Is this in order? Let's see.

-3 is first. Next is 7: correct. Then -9: 7> -9? No, because -9 is less than 7. So in the sequence, 7 comes before -9, which is incorrect.

Thus, option C is not in order.

Wait, so only option H is in order from least to greatest.

So the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought E is correct. Let me check again.

Option E: -9, -3,7,11,-6.

-9 < -3: correct. Then -3 <7: correct. 7 <11: correct. 11 >-6: correct. So E is in order, but it's not the correct overall order.

So the correct overall order is H.

Wait, but earlier, I thought option C is correct, but upon rechecking, it's not because the numbers after -3 are not in order.

So, the only correct option is H.
</think>

The question asks which set of integers is in order from least to greatest. Each option lists a sequence of integers, and we need to determine which one is correctly ordered.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A: 11, −9, 7, −6, −3**  
   - 11 is greater than −9, so incorrect.

2. **Option B: 7, 11, −6, −3, −9**  
   - 7 is less than 11, so incorrect.

3. **Option C: −3, 7, −9, −6, 11**  
   - −3 is less than 7, so incorrect.

4. **Option D: −6, −3, 7, 11, −9**  
   - −6 is less than −3, so incorrect.

5. **Option E: −9, −3, 7, 11, −6**  
   - −9 is less than −3, so incorrect.

6. **Option F: −3, −6, 7, 11, −9**  
   - −6 is less than −9, so incorrect.

7. **Option G: −9, 7, −6, −3, 11**  
   - −9 is less than 7, so incorrect.

8. **Option H: −9, −6, −3, 7, 11**  
   - Each subsequent number is greater than the previous, so correct.

9. **Option I: 11, 7, −3, −6, −9**  
   - 11 is greater than 7, so incorrect.

10. **Option J: 7, −9, −6, −3, 11**
