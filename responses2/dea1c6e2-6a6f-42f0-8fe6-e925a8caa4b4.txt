Okay, so I've got this problem here. I need to find the product of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) in the polynomial ring Z_8[x]. Hmm, Z_8 means we're working modulo 8, right? So all the coefficients will be modulo 8. The polynomials are f(x) = 4x -5 and g(x) = 2x² -4x +2.

Wait a second, I should remember how polynomial multiplication works. I'll need to multiply each term in f by each term in g and then combine like terms. But since everything is in Z_8, I'll have to reduce each coefficient modulo 8.

Let me write out the multiplication step by step.

f(x) = 4x -5
g(x) = 2x² -4x +2

Multiplying each term:

First, multiply 4x by each term in g(x):
4x * 2x² = 8x³
4x * (-4x) = -16x²
4x * 2 = 8x

Then, multiply -5 by each term in g(x):
-5 * 2x² = -10x²
-5 * (-4x) = 20x
-5 * 2 = -10

Now, let's combine all these terms:
8x³ -16x² +8x -10x² +20x -10

Next step, combine like terms:

For x³: 8x³
For x²: -16x² -10x² = (-16-10)x² = -26x²
For x: 8x +20x = 28x
Constants: -10

So the polynomial before reduction is 8x³ -26x² +28x -10.

Now, I need to reduce each coefficient modulo 8.

Let's do that:
8x³ mod8 is 0 (since 8 is 0 mod8)
-26x² mod8: Let's compute 26 divided by 8. 8*3=24, so 26-24=2 → -2 mod8 is 6. So -26x² is 6x².
28x mod8: 28 divided by 8 is 3*8=24, remainder 4 → 4x.
-10 mod8: 8*1=8, so -10 is -10 +16=6 → 6.

So the reduced polynomial is 0x³ +6x² +4x +6. But wait, the 0x³ can be omitted, so it's 6x² +4x +6.

Wait a moment, but looking at the options, option F is 6x² +4x +6. So that's one of the choices.

Wait, but I thought the options included 0. Oh, option H is 0. So why am I getting a non-zero result?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in combining the terms before reduction.

Let me re-add the terms after multiplying each term:

f(x) * g(x) = (4x)(2x²) + (4x)(-4x) + (4x)(2) + (-5)(2x²) + (-5)(-4x) + (-5)(2)

Calculating each term:

4x * 2x² = 8x³
4x * (-4x) = -16x²
4x * 2 = 8x
-5 * 2x² = -10x²
-5*(-4x) =20x
-5*2 = -10

So the combined terms are:
8x³ -16x² +8x -10x² +20x -10.

Combine like terms:

x³: 8x³
x²: -16x² -10x² = (-26)x² → -26 mod8. Let's compute 26/8: 3*8=24, remainder 2. So -26 mod8 is equal to (-2) mod8, which is 6. So 6x².

x terms: 8x +20x =28x. 28 mod8: 3*8=24, 28-24=4 → 4x.

Constants: -10 → -10 mod8. 8 goes into -10 once (since 8*(-2) =-16 is too low). So -10 is 6 mod8 (because -10 +16=6).

So the result is 8x³ +6x² +4x +6.

Now, each coefficient mod8:

8x³ → 0
6x² →6
4x →4
6 →6.

So the reduced form is 0x³ +6x² +4x +6 → 6x² +4x +6.

Looking back, option F is that. So the product is option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought option H was 0. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the multiplication.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering that in Z_8, 8 mod8 is 0, so any term with coefficient 8 would be 0.

So, in the product, 8x³ is 0, which I can ignore.

The 6x² term comes from the other terms.

Wait, perhaps I should go back and re-calculate the entire product.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial multiplication. Let me try again, perhaps.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me re-examine:

f(x) = 4x -5 = 4x + (-5)
g(x) = 2x² -4x +2.

Multiply each term:

(4x)(2x²) = 8x³
(4x)(-4x) = -16x²
(4x)(2) = 8x
(-5)(2x²) = -10x²
(-5)(-4x) = 20x
(-5)(2) = -10

Adding all together: 8x³ -16x² +8x -10x² +20x -10.

Combine like terms:

x³: 8x³
x²: -16x² -10x² = -26x² → -26 mod8 is 6x² (since 8*3=24, 26-24=2; -2 mod8 is 6)
x: 8x +20x =28x mod8: 28/8= 3*8=24, remainder 4 →4x
Constants: -10 → mod8, -10 +16=6 →6.

So the product is 6x² +4x +6.

So the correct option is F: 6x² +4x +6.

Wait, but earlier I thought option H was 0. Hmm. So why am I getting 6x² +4x +6 as the product? That's option F.

The product of the polynomials f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x² - 4x + 2 in Z_8[x] is calculated as follows:

1. Multiply each term of f(x) by each term of g(x):
   - 4x * 2x² = 8x³
   - 4x * (-4x) = -16x²
   - 4x * 2 = 8x
   - (-5) * 2x² = -10x²
   - (-5) * (-4x) = 20x
   - (-5) * 2 = -10

2. Combine like terms:
   - 8x³
   - (-16x² -10x²) = -26x² → -26 mod 8 = 6x²
   - (8x + 20x) = 28x → 28 mod 8 = 4x
   - -10 → -10 mod 8 = 6

3. The reduced polynomial is 6x² + 4x + 6.

Thus, the correct answer is option F: 6x² + 4x + 6.
