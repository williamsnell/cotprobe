Okay, so I've got this question about fuel oil expenses for a homeowners heating season. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that during a 6-month heating season, the homeowner expects to average $40 a month. So, each month, he should spend around $40. Now, he's already purchased some amounts over the past months, and we need to find out how much he'll spend in the last month to keep the average at $40.

Let me look at the amounts he has so far. The amounts he's spent in each of the first five months are: $37.50, $42.60, $39.80, $40.75, and $44.10. 

Wait, but waitâ€”oh, no, actually, are these the amounts he has purchased, or the amounts he has already spent? Because the wording says he has purchased the following amounts to date. So, perhaps the amounts are the ones he has bought so far. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify. 

Wait, no, the question says he "has purchased the following amounts to date." So, the amounts listed are the ones he has spent, not the ones he's purchased. Because he's bought them, and now he's spending them to cover the cost. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I think the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. But wait, the question is phrased as "he has purchased the following amounts to date: $37.50, $42.60, $39.80, $40.75, $44.10." So, he has purchased these amounts to date, meaning he's spent them, or he's bought them and now is spending them? Hmm, perhaps he's tracking his monthly expenses. Maybe he's budgeted to spend each month, and he's tracking how much he's spent so far to date, and he wants to know how much he'll spend in the last month to match the average. 

Wait, the question says he expects to average $40 a month. So the total expected over 6 months is 6 * $40 = $240. 

He's already spent five months, so the total he's spent now is the sum of those five amounts. Let me add them up. 

First, $37.50 + $42.60 = $80.10. Then + $39.80: 80.10 + 39.80 = $119.90. Next, $40.75: 119.90 + 40.75 = $160.65. Then $44.10: 160.65 + 44.10 = $204.75. 

So, he's spent $204.75 so far over five months. The total he's expected to have spent over six months is $240. So the amount he needs to spend in the sixth month is $240 - $204.75 = $35.25.

Looking at the options, option A is $35.25. So the correct answer should be A.

The total expected expenditure over six months is $240. After five months, he has spent $204.75. Therefore, the amount he needs to spend in the last month is $240 - $204.75 = $35.25, which corresponds to option A.

Answer:
A: $35.25
