Question:

It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.

Options:

A: The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only
B: Neurotransmitters can diffuse freely outside the synaptic cleft
C: Neurotransmitter travels in both directions
D: Neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end only
E: The synaptic cleft prevents the movement of neurotransmitters
F: Neurotransmitter release is controlled by the post-synaptic neuron
G: Neurotransmitters are synthesized in the synaptic cleft
H: Neurotransmitter is not involved in this process

Okay, so I've got this question about how neurotransmitters work in the synapse. Hmm, I remember that synapses are the places where signals are sent from one neuron to another. The question says the transmission is unidirectional, meaning neurotransmitters always go from the presynaptic axon to the post-synaptic dendrite. Wait, why is that?

I think I remember something about the synaptic cleft. Oh right, the cleft is the gap between the axon and the dendrite. When a neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic neuron, it's stored in this cleft. So maybe the cleft acts as a barrier. I think the neurotransmitters can't pass through because they're inside the cleft. Oh wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, neurotransmitters are usually in the cleft. So when the presynaptic neuron sends a signal, the neurotransmitter inside the cleft can't leave because it's trapped there. So maybe the cleft is what prevents the neurotransmitter from moving. So the neurotransmitter is released from the cleft, but can't get out because it's there. That might explain why it's only going from the presynaptic to post-synaptic.

Looking at the options, option E says the synaptic cleft prevents movement. That sounds familiar. So the neurotransmitter is within the cleft, and can't get out. So it's stored there. So it would not be able to travel to the other side, thus the unidirectional flow.

Wait another thought: some neurotransmitters can be released from the cleft, but perhaps they can't leave. So the cleft is a barrier. So option E fits.

Other options don't seem right. Option C says the neurotransmitter can travel both ways. That's probably not true. Option D says it's in the dendrite, which isn't correct because the cleft is where it's stored. Option F says release is controlled by the post-synaptic neuron, but that's not the cause. The release is more about the presynaptic neuron. Option G says it's synthesized in the cleft, which is correct, but that's about release, not the direction. So the direction is why E is the right answer.

The correct explanation for why neurotransmitters travel unidirectionally from the presynaptic axon to the post-synaptic dendrite is that neurotransmitters are stored within the synaptic cleft. This cleft acts as a barrier, preventing neurotransmitters from moving outside. Therefore, the neurotransmitter is not involved in this process, and the correct answer is:

**E: The synaptic cleft prevents the movement of neurotransmitters**

Answer: E
