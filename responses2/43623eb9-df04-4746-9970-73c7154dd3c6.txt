Okay, so I have this question about the difference between Hobbes and Locke's views. I remember that both were key figures in the development of classical and modern political philosophy, respectively. Let me think about their main ideas.

Hobbes was a rationalist, which means he believed in the power of reason to guide society. He talked a lot about the social contract, where people agree to certain terms of service that protect their rights. He wanted society to be order in a state of nature. His views were more about individual freedom and the state's role in maintaining order, like the "state of nature."

Locke, on the other hand, was more empiric. He thought that natural laws and social contracts were the primary means by which society operates. He believed that people have inherent rights and obligations, and he focused more on the natural order rather than the state's role. So, he might have agreed more with Hobbes's view about the social contract.

Looking at the options:

Option A: They differ on the courts. I'm not sure. Both were into the state, so maybe they didn't have different views on the courts? Or perhaps they agreed on the function of courts? Not sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: They disagree on law. That might be it. Because Hobbes believed in the role of law as a social contract, whereas Locke thought society's natural order was governed by these laws. So they might differ on the nature of law. 

Option C: Contractual obligations. Well, both would have different views because Hobbes was more about reason and Hobbesian contract, whereas Locke was more about natural law. So their views on contracts might differ, but I think they might not have opposing views about that.

Option D: Life before social contract. Hobbes talked about life before the social contract, which was about individual rights and freedom. Locke might have focused more on the social contract and natural law. So they might have different views on what life entails before the contract.

Wait, the question is about the principal difference. So I need to find what's the most significant contrast between them.

I think it's about the role of law. Hobbes believed law was a social contract, and he wanted it to be enforced by the state, ensuring order and justice. Locke thought that natural law was the primary means, where people's rights are inherent and not regulated by law. So they disagree on the role of law in society.

So the correct answer would be option B.

The correct answer is B: They disagree about the role of law in society.

**Answer: B**
