Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question: "What is the name of the disease that has been referred to as the 'disease of kings'?" The options are A to J, each with different diseases.

First, I need to break down the question. The phrase "disease of kings" sounds familiar. I remember hearing about it in the context of a famous disease. Let me think... Oh right, it's often associated with rubella, which is also known as polio. Wait, no, rubella is another name. Or was it polio? I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, I think the disease in question is polio. Oh, but wait, I might be mixing up polio with another term. Let me think again. Polio is a viral disease that's caused by the poliovirus. I remember that polio is often referred to as the "disease of kings" because it's a highly contagious disease that can kill millions, and it's been around for a long time, maybe even been around for centuries. Yeah, I think that's correct.

Looking at the options, option I is arthritis. That's not related to the disease of kings. Option J is rubella, which is another name for polio. So, I think option J is the right answer. But wait, let me double-check. Does rubella refer to the same disease? Polio is caused by polio virus, and rubella is caused by the same virus, with a different name. So, yes, rubella is the same as polio. So the correct answer is J: rubella.
