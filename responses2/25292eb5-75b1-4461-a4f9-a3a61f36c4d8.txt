Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Two bulbs contain ideal gases A and B. The density of A is twice that of B, and the molecular weight of A is half that of B. They're at the same temperature, and I need to find the ratio of the pressure of gas A to that of gas B. The options are A through J, with various ratios.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ideal gas laws, but I'll try to recall. Oh right, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V volume, n moles, R gas constant, T temperature. But wait, since the volume might be different for each gas in their respective bulbs, I'll need to think about that.

Wait, but the question says the two bulbs are separate. So each is in its own bulb, so each has its own volume. Let me think about the ideal gas equation for each.

So for gas A: P_A * V_A = n_A * R * T. Similarly for gas B: P_B * V_B = n_B * R * T.

But wait, what about the number of moles? Moles are related to mass and molar mass. Oh right, n = m / M, where m is mass, M is molar mass. And density (d) is mass over volume (d = m/V). So m = d * V. Substituting into n, we get n = (d * V) / M.

Putting that into the ideal gas equation: P * V = (d * V / M) * R * T. Oh wait, the V would cancel out on both sides, so P = (d * R * T) / M. So the pressure is (density * R * T) divided by molecular weight.

Wait, that's a key point. So each gas's pressure can be expressed as (d * R * T) / M. Since both are at the same temperature, T is the same for both. So the ratio of their pressures would be (d_A / d_B) * (M_B / M_A).

Wait, because P_A = (d_A R T) / M_A, and P_B = (d_B R T) / M_B. So P_A / P_B would be (d_A / d_B) * (M_B / M_A).

Let me plug in the values. The density of A is twice that of B, so d_A = 2 d_B. The molecular weight of A is half that of B, so M_A = 0.5 M_B. Wait, so M_B = 2 M_A.

So, substituting into the ratio: (2 d_B) / d_B * (2 M_A) / (0.5 M_A). Wait, wait. Let me compute this step by step.

Wait, P_A/P_B = (d_A / d_B) * (M_B / M_A). 

Given: d_A = 2 d_B, so d_A/d_B = 2.

M_A is half of M_B, so M_A = (1/2) M_B → M_B = 2 M_A.

So substituting M_B = 2 M_A into the ratio:

(2) * (2 M_A) / (M_A) ) → 2 * 2 = 4.

So the ratio P_A/P_B is 4. Looking at the options, option C is 4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, did I mix up the ratio? Let me double-check. The formula was P = (dRT)/(M). So P_A/P_B = (d_A/d_B) * (M_B/M_A). Yes, that's correct. So since d_A is 2 d_B, and M_A is 0.5 M_B → M_B/M_A = 2.

So 2 (d_A/d_B) * (M_B/M_A) = 2 * 2 =4. So pressure of A is four times that of B. So the ratio is 4, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of the pressure of gas A to gas B, we use the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), and relate the density of each gas to its pressure. For an ideal gas, the pressure can be expressed as:

\[
P = \frac{dRT}{M}
\]

where \( d \) is the density, \( M \) is the molar mass, and \( R \) and \( T \) are constants for both gases. The ratio of the pressures of gas A to gas B is:

\[
\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \frac{\frac{d_A RT}{M_A}}{\frac{d_B RT}{M_B}} = \frac{d_A}{d_B} \cdot \frac{M_B}{M_A}
\]

Given:
- \( d_A = 2d_B \) (density of gas A is twice that of gas B),
- \( M_A = \frac{1}{2}M_B \) (molecular weight of gas A is half that of gas B).

Substituting these values:
\[
\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \frac{2d_B}{d_B} \cdot \frac{M_B}{\frac{1}{2}M_B} = 2 \cdot 2 = 4
\]

Thus, the ratio of the pressure of gas A to gas B is 4. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 4**
