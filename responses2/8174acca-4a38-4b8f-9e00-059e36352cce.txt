Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat: if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not? During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, "Logan is the friend of the white man." I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about Logan, an Indian leader from 1774. The story describes Logan's background, and he's appealing to white men to fight against certain conditions. He's a leader of peace and has a lot of Reasons to be angry. The story ends with him seeking revenge and killing many, especially his women and children. He says, "I rejoiced at the beams of peace," but doesn't think his country's joy comes from fear. Instead, he's probably content with peace.

The question is asking which of the options in later years would most likely see themselves in Logan's position. The options are various people from different eras and fields—consumption, government, liberalism, big industry, civil rights, environmentalism, globalization, communism, feminism.

Hmm, so I need to find a person who's in Logan's shoes. Logan was a leader of peace, fighting against the harsh conditions of the war. He's a warrior who's angry about the suffering of others, especially his own people, and he's seeking revenge. His actions can be seen as a form of resistance against oppression.

Looking at the options, each represents a different field and era. Let's consider each option:

Option A: An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s. That's about promoting alternatives to traditional food and lifestyle. Not directly related to fighting harsh conditions or fighting for peace. But maybe someone who's passionate about resistance or抗击 war ideas. But I'm not sure.

Option B: An opponent of big government in the 1930s. That's about limiting government power. Not directly related to fighting oppression or fighting for peace.

Option C: A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s. liberalism is about free speech and civil liberties. Not directly related to fighting harsh conditions.

Option D: An opponent of industrialization in the 1800s. That's about promoting sustainable living and reducing industrial pollution. Again, not directly related to fighting oppression.

Option E: A supporter of civil rights in the 1960s. Civil rights was about fighting against discrimination. While civil rights were important, Logan was fighting more for peace, not necessarily discrimination. So maybe not this one.

Option F: A supporter of environmentalism in the 1980s. That's about preserving the environment and sustainable living. Not directly related to fighting harsh conditions.

Option G: An opponent of globalization in the 2000s. Globalization is about international trade and economic interdependence. Not directly related.

Option H: A supporter of communism in the 1950s. Communism is a form of state ideology promoting class struggle and collectiveism. While communism was a form of resistance, it's a different kind of resistance from fighting oppression. So maybe not the same as Logan's approach.

Option I: A supporter of feminism in the 1970s. Feminism is about fighting for gender equality and resistance. So this seems more aligned with Logan's approach of fighting for peace and resistance, which is a form of women's rights and fighting against oppression.

Putting it together, Logan was a warrior fighting against oppression, seeking revenge. A supporter of feminism (opposed to big government, fighting for women's rights) would be someone in Logan's shoes. So the answer should be I.
</think>

The correct answer is **I: A supporter of feminism in the 1970s**. This option reflects a person who would be in Logan's position, viewing himself as a fighter against oppression, fighting for peace, and advocating for women's rights, which Logan was also advocating for.
