Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrolysis. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that two electrolytic cells are placed in series. One has AgNO3 and the other CuSO4. Electrons are passed through them until 1.273g of Ag is deposited. I need to find out how much copper was deposited.

Hmm, electrolysis involves the flow of electricity through solutions, causing chemical reactions. I remember that in electrolysis, the process involves breaking down the solution into ions because the ions get separated at the electrodes.

So each cell is acting as an electrolytic cell. Since they're in series, the current goes through both cells one after the other. The deposition of silver and copper would depend on the amount of electricity passed through each cell.

Wait, but wait—the current is the same through both cells because it's series. Oh right, in series, the current is the same, but the voltage might differ. But in this case, the question is about the amount of substance deposited, not voltage.

I remember that Faraday's laws of electrolysis might help here. Faraday's first law says the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the amount of electricity (moles) that has passed through it. The formula is n = Q/(F), where n is moles, Q is charge, F is Faraday's constant.

Faraday's constant F is about 96485 C/mol. But I don't remember the exact value, but I know it's a constant.

So, the moles of Ag deposited can be found by mass divided by the molar mass. The molar mass of Ag is approximately 108 g/mol.

So, m_Ag = 1.273g. Moles of Ag = 1.273 / 108. Let me calculate that. 1.273 divided by 108. Let's see, 108 * 0.0118 is about 1.274 (since 0.01*108=1.08, 0.0018*108=0.1944; sum is 1.2744). So, 1.273 is 0.0118 mol approximately.

Wait, but wait, I think I should recalculate. 108 * 0.0118 is 1.2744, so 1.273 is a little less. So about 0.0118 mol Ag deposited.

Since it's electrolysis, the amount of Ag deposited is proportional to the charge passed. The same current will pass through both cells, so the moles of Ag and Cu should be related.

Wait, but what about the two electrolytic cells? Let's think. Each cell is undergoing electrolysis. In the first cell, we're depositing Ag, and in the second, Cu.

Let me think about the half-reactions. For AgNO3, the reaction is:

AgNO3 → Ag + NO3^- 

Wait, no, in solution, AgNO3 dissociates into Ag+ and NO3^- (but more accurately, it's a solution of AgNO3, so Ag+ and NO3^-).

When Ag+ is oxidized, it becomes Ag metal. The oxidation reaction is Ag+ → Ag (oxidation, loss of e-). The reduction is NO3^- + 4H+ + 3e^- → NO + 2H2O (I think that's the reduction half-reaction for nitrate ion reduction in acidic conditions).

Similarly, for CuSO4, the reaction is:

Cu^2+ + 2e^- → Cu (reduction).

So, in each cell, the electrons are being supplied. The amount of Ag deposited is proportional to the number of electrons lost, and the amount of Cu deposited is proportional to the number of electrons gained.

Since the two cells are in series, the same current flows through both, so the same amount of charge Q is passed through each cell. But wait, the actual amount passed is the sum of the charges from both cells, but each cell's current depends on its cell's potential.

Wait, but in this problem, the same current flows through both cells. So, the moles of electrons that pass through each cell would be Q/(F) for each cell. But each cell's cell potential determines how much charge can pass before electrolysis stops.

But since both cells are in series, the total voltage is the sum of their individual voltages. However, I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here because the problem is about the amount of substance deposited, not the voltage.

Wait, no—the key is that the same amount of charge (n = Q/F) passes through both cells. So, the moles of electrons for Ag and Cu would be the same? Or wait—no, because each cell might have different number of moles of electrons per mole of substance.

Wait, for Ag, each mole of Ag requires 1 mole of electrons (because it's a +1 oxidation state, losing 1 e- per Ag+ → Ag). So, moles of electrons = moles of Ag × 1.

For Cu, each mole of Cu^2+ gains 2 electrons. So, moles of electrons = moles of Cu × 2.

But in the problem, the same charge Q passes through both cells. So, Q = F × moles of electrons for Ag (n_Ag) and also Q = F × moles of electrons for Cu (n_Cu). But wait, no—because each cell is in series, the charge that flows through each cell must be the same.

Wait, but the same amount of Q passes through both cells. So, for Ag, n_Ag = Q/(F) × (1) (since each Ag requires 1 e-), and for Cu, n_Cu = Q/(F) × (1/2). Because each Cu requires 2 e-.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The charge Q is the same for both cells because it's the same current passing through both. So, Q = n_Ag × 1 (since each Ag requires 1 e- per mole) and Q = n_Cu × 2 (each Cu requires 2 e- per mole). So, n_Ag = Q/(F), and n_Cu = Q/(2F).

So, n_Ag is twice as much as n_Cu.

In this problem, the amount of Ag deposited is 1.273g, which is n_Ag = (1.273g) / (108 g/mol) = 0.0118 mol.

So, n_Cu = (0.0118) / 2 = 0.0059 mol.

Wait, but the question is asking how much copper was deposited. So, moles of Cu is 0.0059 mol.

So, mass of Cu = moles × molar mass. Molar mass of Cu is about 63.55 g/mol.

So, 0.0059 × 63.55 ≈ 0.373 g.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.3749g. Hmm, that's very close. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me be precise.

Compute n_Ag:

m_Ag = 1.273 g.

Molar mass Ag = 107.87 g/mol.

n_Ag = 1.273 / 107.87 ≈ let's calculate this.

107.87 * 0.0118 = 1.274, so 1.273 is about 0.0118 mol.

n_Cu = 0.0118 / 2 = 0.0059 mol.

Mass of Cu is 0.0059 * 63.546 (molar mass of Cu is 63.546 g/mol).

0.0059 *63.546= 0.3749 g approximately.

So, option G is 0.3749g. So the answer is G.

Wait, but let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Another approach: the amount of electrons is same for both cells.

n_Ag = Q / F (since each Ag requires 1 e- per mole).

n_Cu = Q/(2F) (since each Cu requires 2 e- per mole).

So, n_Ag = 2 * n_Cu.

Which means that the moles in Ag and Cu are in a 2:1 ratio. So, if Ag's moles are 0.0118, Cu's moles would be 0.0059.

So mass of Cu is 0.0059 *63.55= 0.3743 g, which rounds to 0.374g, which is the same as 0.3749g (option G).

So the correct answer is G.

To determine how much copper was deposited, we analyze the problem using Faraday's laws of electrolysis and the stoichiometry of the reactions in the two electrolytic cells.

1. **Reaction Analysis**:  
   - For AgNO₃, the reaction is:  
     $$ \text{Ag}^{+} \rightarrow \text{Ag} \, (\text{oxidation, loss of 1 electron per Ag atom}) $$  
     The molar mass of Ag is approximately 108 g/mol.  
   - For CuSO₄, the reaction is:  
     $$ \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} \, (\text{reduction, gain of 2 electrons per Cu atom}) $$  

2. **Moles of Ag Deposed**:  
   The mass of Ag deposited is 1.273 g. Using the molar mass of Ag (108 g/mol):  
   $$ n_{\text{Ag}} = \frac{1.273}{108} \approx 0.0118 \, \text{mol} $$  

3. **Relationship Between Moles of Ag and Cu**:  
   Since the same charge \( Q \) passes through both cells, the moles of electrons (\( n \)) for Ag and Cu are related by:  
   $$ n_{\text{Ag}} = n_{\text{Cu}} \times 2 $$  
   Rearranging:  
   $$ n_{\text{Cu}} = \frac{n_{\text{Ag}}}{2} = \frac{0.0118}{2} = 0.0059 \, \text{mol} $$  

4. **Mass of Cu Deposed**:  
   The molar mass of Cu is approximately 63.55 g/mol. Using the moles of Cu:  
   $$ m_{\text{Cu}} = n_{\text{Cu}} \times 63.55 = 0.0059 \times 63.55 \approx 0.3749 \, \text{g} $$  

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The mass of copper deposited is approximately 0.3749 g, which corresponds to option G.
