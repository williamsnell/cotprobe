Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the resultant force on a body of mass 48 kg when its acceleration is 6 m/s². The options are labeled from A to J, each with a different number of newtons.

Hmm, right, Newton's second law of motion comes into play here. Oh wait, Newton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. So, F = m*a.

The mass given is 48 kg, and the acceleration is 6 m/s². So I just multiply those two numbers together. Let me do the math: 48 kg multiplied by 6 m/s². Let's see, 48 times 6. 40 times 6 is 240, and 8 times 6 is 48, so 240 +48 is 288. So the force should be 288 newtons.

Looking at the options, option D is 288 newtons. So that's the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The formula is straightforward, and the numbers add up correctly. Oh, wait, wait a second. Did I get the units right? Mass is in kilograms, acceleration in meters per second squared, so the force in newtons. Yep, that's correct.

To determine the resultant force on a body of mass 48 kg with an acceleration of 6 m/s², we use Newton's second law of motion, \( F = ma \). Multiplying the mass by acceleration gives \( F = 48 \, \text{kg} \times 6 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 288 \, \text{N} \). The correct option is D.

Answer: D
