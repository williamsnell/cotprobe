Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given a sequence a_n, and it's telling me that the limit as n approaches infinity of a_n times the sum from i=1 to n of a_i squared equals 1. I need to find the limit of 3n times (a_n) cubed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's write down what's given. The limit is:

lim_{n→∞} a_n * ∑_{i=1}^n a_i² = 1

I need to find lim_{n→∞} 3n * (a_n)^3.

Hmm, so I have a product of a_n and the sum of squares of a_i up to n. The limit of this product is 1. I need to connect this to the behavior of a_n.

Let me denote S_n = ∑_{i=1}^n a_i². Then the given condition is lim_{n→∞} a_n * S_n = 1.

So, a_n * S_n tends to 1 as n approaches infinity. That means that as n increases, a_n must be roughly inversely proportional to S_n. Maybe a_n ≈ 1/(S_n) for large n.

Wait, but S_n is the sum of a_i squared. So, S_n is the sum of the squares of the terms a_i. If a_n is approximately 1/S_n, then each a_i is probably decreasing, because S_n is increasing.

Let me think, maybe I can model this as a recursive relation. Suppose that S_n is approximately equal to a_n multiplied by S_n, but that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the behavior of S_n as n increases.

If a_n is roughly 1/S_n, then S_n = a_n * S_n approximately equals 1. But that might not help directly. Let me think differently.

Suppose that as n becomes large, a_n behaves like some function, say, 1/n^k for some exponent k. Then S_n would be the sum from i=1 to n of a_i². If a_i is 1/i^k, then a_i² is 1/i^{2k}. So S_n would be the sum of 1/i^{2k} from i=1 to n. 

If 2k > 1, then the sum converges to a constant as n approaches infinity. If 2k =1, it diverges like ln n. If 2k <1, it diverges like n^{1-2k}.

So, depending on k, S_n behaves differently.

Given that a_n * S_n tends to 1, which is a finite limit. So S_n must be on the order of 1/a_n as n approaches infinity. So if S_n = 1/a_n + something that tends to zero.

Wait, but if S_n is approximately 1/a_n, then we can write S_n ≈ 1/a_n. But S_n is the sum from i=1 to n of a_i², so S_n ≈ ∑_{i=1}^n a_i² ≈ 1/a_n.

Hmm, but that equation can be rewritten as ∑_{i=1}^n a_i² ≈ 1/a_n. Which suggests that a_i² is roughly 1/(n a_n) for each i? Maybe not exactly, but perhaps for large n, each term a_i² is about 1/(n a_n). That would mean that a_i is about 1/(√n a_n).

Wait, maybe I can model this as an integral or a differential equation. Perhaps think of a_n as a function a(n), and then S_n as the integral from 1 to n of a(t)^2 dt. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cesàro-Stolz theorem, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps a_n is related to 1/n^{c} for some c. Let me try that approach.

Suppose a_n = C / n^c, where C is some constant and c is a positive exponent.

Then a_n² = C² / n^{2c}

So S_n = ∑_{i=1}^n a_i² ≈ ∫_{1}^{n} C² / t^{2c} dt = C² ∫_{1}^{n} t^{-2c} dt.

This integral converges if 2c > 1, so c>1/2. If c=1/2, it diverges as ln n. If c<1/2, it diverges as n^{1-2c}.

Given that a_n * S_n = 1, let's plug in a_n = C/n^c and S_n ≈ C² ∫_{1}^{n} t^{-2c} dt.

So a_n * S_n ≈ (C / n^c) * (C² ∫_{1}^{n} t^{-2c} dt ) = C³ ∫_{1}^{n} t^{-2c} dt / n^c.

Let me compute the integral ∫_{1}^{n} t^{-2c} dt. If 2c ≠1, the integral is [n^{1-2c} -1 ] / (1-2c). If 2c=1, it's ln n.

So, let's split into cases.

Case 1: 2c >1, which is c>1/2. Then the integral is [n^{1-2c} -1]/(1-2c).

So a_n * S_n ≈ C³ [ (n^{1-2c} -1 ) / (1-2c) ) ] / n^c.

As n→infty, n^{1-2c} / n^c = n^{1-3c}.

So this becomes C³ (n^{1-3c}/(1-2c)) ) as n→infty.

But the limit of this is 1. So for this term to approach a finite limit (1), we must have that the exponent of n is zero, so 1-3c=0 → c=1/3.

So c=1/3.

Then, in this case, 1-3c=0, so the term becomes C³ / (1-2c).

But 2c=2*(1/3)=2/3, so 1-2c=1-2/3=1/3.

So C³ / (1/3) = 3 C³.

We are given that this limit is 1.

So 3 C³ =1 → C= (1/3)^{1/3}.

Therefore, a_n ≈ (1/3)^{1/3} / n^{1/3}.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. So if a_n is C/n^{1/3}, then a_n squared is C² / n^{2/3}.

The sum S_n = ∑_{i=1}^n a_i² ≈ ∫_{1}^{n} C² / t^{2/3} dt = C² ∫_{1}^{n} t^{-2/3} dt = C² [ (3/1) t^{1/3} ] from 1 to n = 3 C² (n^{1/3} -1).

So S_n ≈ 3 C² n^{1/3}.

Then a_n * S_n ≈ (C /n^{1/3}) * 3 C² n^{1/3} = 3 C³.

Which is set to 1 → 3 C³ =1 → C= (1/3)^{1/3}.

So yes, this seems consistent.

So a_n ≈ (1/3)^{1/3} / n^{1/3}.

Now, the question is to find the limit of 3n (a_n)^3.

Let me compute (a_n)^3.

(a_n)^3 = [ (1/3)^{1/3} / n^{1/3} ]^3 = (1/3) / n.

Therefore, 3n (a_n)^3 = 3n * (1/(3n)) )= 3n*(1/(3n))= 1.

So the limit is 1.

Wait, but let me check that again.

Wait, a_n is (C) /n^{1/3}, so a_n^3 is C^3 /n.

So 3n * (a_n)^3 = 3n * (C^3 /n) )= 3 C^3.

But from earlier, C^3 is 1/3.

So 3*(1/3) =1.

So yes, the limit is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the integral. Let me see.

Wait, the integral for 2c >1, which is c>1/2, then the sum S_n is approximately C² ∫_{1}^{n} t^{-2c} dt.

Which is C² [n^{1-2c} -1 ]/(1-2c).

As n approaches infinity, n^{1-2c} dominates, so S_n ≈ C² n^{1-2c}/(1-2c).

Then a_n * S_n ≈ (C /n^{c}) * (C² n^{1-2c})/(1-2c) ) = C^3 n^{1-3c}/(1-2c).

Set this to 1, so 1-3c=0 → c=1/3.

Then 1-2c =1-2/3=1/3.

So a_n * S_n ≈ C^3/(1/3)=3 C^3.

Set equal to 1, so 3 C^3=1 → C= (1/3)^{1/3}.

Then, (a_n)^3 = (C^3)/n = (1/3)/n.

So 3n (a_n)^3 =3n*(1/(3n))=1.

So the limit is 1.

So the answer is E, which is 1.0.

The given condition is that the limit of \( a_n \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \) as \( n \) approaches infinity is 1. We need to find the limit of \( 3n(a_n)^3 \).

Assume \( a_n \) behaves like \( C / n^c \). Then \( a_n^2 = C^2 / n^{2c} \), and the sum \( S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \) approximates to \( C^2 \int_{1}^{n} t^{-2c} dt \).

If \( 2c > 1 \), the integral converges to \( C^2 [n^{1-2c} - 1]/(1-2c) \). For the product \( a_n S_n \) to approach 1, we need \( 1-3c = 0 \), so \( c = 1/3 \).

Substituting \( c = 1/3 \), we find \( S_n \approx 3 C^2 n^{1/3} \), so \( a_n = C / n^{1/3} \). Then \( (a_n)^3 = C^3 / n \), and \( 3n (a_n)^3 = 3 C^3 \). Since \( 3 C^3 = 1 \), the limit is 1.
