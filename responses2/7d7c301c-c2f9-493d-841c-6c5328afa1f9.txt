Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here about finding the volume of a solid. The base is a circular disk with radius 3, and the cross-sections perpendicular to the base are isosceles right triangles with their hypotenuse lying along the base. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me visualize the problem. The base is a circle with radius 3, so the equation of the circle would be x² + y² = 9, assuming the center is at the origin. But wait, the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, so I'm guessing the base is horizontal in this case, which would make the solid a sort of cylinder or something else.

Wait, no, the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base. If the base is a circular disk, I think that means the base is lying on a plane, maybe the xy-plane, with the center at a certain point. But the cross-sections are perpendicular, so they are vertical slices.

Wait, the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles. So, each cross-section is a triangle with two sides equal, and the right angle is between the two equal sides. The hypotenuse of each triangle is along the base, which is the circular disk. Hmm, wait, the hypotenuse is lying along the base, which is the base of the solid. So, in other words, each cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is along a chord of the circular base.

Wait, but the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base. So, if the base is a circle, then the cross-sections are taken perpendicular to the base, meaning that they are vertical slices (if the base is in the horizontal plane) or maybe horizontal if the base is in a vertical plane.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of integrating with respect to the axis perpendicular to the circular base. Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, and the base is a circle, it's likely that the base is in the x-y plane, and we're slicing along the z-axis. So, each cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is along a line on the base.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-sections are taken along the radius of the circle. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the base is a circular disk of radius 3. The cross-sections perpendicular to the base are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse along the base. So, each cross-sectional slice is a triangle, and the hypotenuse is a straight line along the edge of the base circle.

Wait, so each cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the circle. Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, which is the plane of the circle, each cross-section is a vertical slice (like a vertical line through the circle) and the cross-section is a triangle with hypotenuse along a chord.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with a coordinate system. Let me assume the base is the circle x² + y² = 9 in the xy-plane. The cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, meaning they are vertical slices (along the z-axis). So, each slice is a triangle whose hypotenuse lies on the base circle.

Wait no, perhaps the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, so they are taken along lines that are perpendicular to the base. Since the base is a circle in the xy-plane, the cross-sections would be along the z-axis. So each cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the circle.

So, for each cross-section at a certain point along the z-axis, the triangle's hypotenuse is a chord of the circle. Because the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, they should be slices through the solid along lines parallel to the z-axis.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the radius. Since the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse along the base, which is a circle of radius 3. So, for each cross-section, the hypotenuse is a chord of the circle.

Wait, but the cross-section is perpendicular to the base, so the hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle? No, because the hypotenuse is along the base, which is a chord, not necessarily a diameter. Wait, but the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles, so the legs of the triangle are equal, and the angle between them is 90 degrees. So, in each cross-section, the triangle has two legs of equal length, and the right angle is between them.

Wait, the hypotenuse is lying along the base, which is the base of the solid. So, in the case of a cross-section, the hypotenuse is the line along which the triangle is lying. Maybe it's better to think of each cross-section as a vertical slice (perpendicular to the base) where the hypotenuse is a line segment on the base circle.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with a coordinate system. Let me consider a cross-section where we take a vertical slice at a certain height along the z-axis. The cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse lying along a chord of the circle.

Wait, maybe the cross-sections are taken along the z-axis, and each cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the circle. So, the base of the solid is the circle, and we're slicing it vertically, so each slice is perpendicular to the base.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a parameter along the z-axis and find the area of each cross-section, then integrate over z to find the volume. But wait, how is the solid constructed? Because the cross-sections are in the plane perpendicular to the base, so each cross-section is a triangle in that plane.

Wait, maybe each cross-section is a vertical strip (perpendicular to the base) and the cross-section is a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the diameter of the base circle. Wait, but the diameter is 6, but the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of polar coordinates. Because the base is a circle, it might be easier to parameterize using radius r and angle θ. So, if I take a cross-section at a certain point along the radius, the cross-section would be a triangle with legs along the radius.

Wait, let me think again. The cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse lying along the base. So, the hypotenuse is a chord of the base circle. Let me consider a chord of the circle. The length of the hypotenuse is the length of this chord. For an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2).

Let me denote the legs as 'a' each. Then, the hypotenuse is a * sqrt(2). But since the hypotenuse is along the base, which is a chord of the circle, its length depends on where it is. Wait, perhaps I should model each cross-section as a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the circle, and the legs are along the axes perpendicular to this chord.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model this using integration. Let me think of slicing the solid along the radius. Let's say I have a radius r from the center to the edge, and for each such r, the cross-sectional area is a triangle. Hmm, but the problem is that the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, so perhaps each cross-section is taken along a horizontal line, and the triangle is in the vertical plane.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the cross-sections as being in the plane perpendicular to the base, so each cross-section is a vertical slice. Each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse lying along the base. So, the base is the circular disk, and each cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the circle.

Wait, but in this case, the cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the base circle. Let me imagine that for a given cross-section at a certain height along the z-axis, the hypotenuse is a horizontal chord of the circle. The legs of the triangle would be vertical and horizontal.

Wait, perhaps each cross-section is a right triangle with legs along the radius, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a function of z. So, the base is a circle of radius 3, centered at the origin. The cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, so they are vertical slices. Each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle whose hypotenuse is a horizontal chord of the circle.

In that case, the length of the hypotenuse is the length of the chord. For a given chord at a certain position, the legs of the triangle would each be equal, and the hypotenuse would be their combined length.

Wait, the triangle is an isosceles right triangle, so legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2). So, if the hypotenuse is of length 'h', then each leg is h/sqrt(2).

But the hypotenuse is a chord of the circle. The length of a chord in a circle of radius r at distance d from the center is 2*sqrt(r² - d²). So, for this case, the chord length h is 2*sqrt(3² - d²) = 2*sqrt(9 - d²).

So, the legs of the triangle would each be (2*sqrt(9 - d²))/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2*(9 - d²)).

But wait, wait. Alternatively, the chord is the hypotenuse, so the legs are the sides. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2). So, if the hypotenuse is h, then each leg is h / sqrt(2).

Wait, but the legs are in the cross-section. So, perhaps the legs are each of length a, so h = a*sqrt(2), so a = h / sqrt(2).

But in this case, the legs are in the cross-sectional triangle. So, the cross-sectional area would be (a)^2 / 2, since area of a right triangle is (base * height)/2 and base and height are equal.

Wait, but wait. The cross-section is a triangle with legs of length a each, so area is (a^2)/2.

But a is h / sqrt(2), and h is the chord length, which is 2*sqrt(9 - d²). So, a = (2*sqrt(9 - d²)) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - d²).

Therefore, a² = 2*(9 - d²).

So, the area of the cross-section is (2*(9 - d²))/2 = (9 - d²).

Wait, but wait: No, because the cross-sectional area is (a)^2 / 2. Since a = h / sqrt(2), and h is 2*sqrt(9 - d²). So, a = (2*sqrt(9 - d²)) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - d²).

Thus, a^2 = 2*(9 - d²). Then, the area is (a^2)/2 = (2*(9 - d²))/2 = (9 - d²).

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. The area of the cross-section is 9 - d²? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

The chord length h is 2*sqrt(r² - d²), where r=3 and d is the distance from the center to the chord. So, h = 2*sqrt(9 - d²).

Since the cross-section is a right triangle with legs a and a, and hypotenuse h, then h = a*sqrt(2). So, a = h / sqrt(2) = (2*sqrt(9 - d²)) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - d²).

So, the area of the cross-section is (a^2) / 2. So a^2 is [sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - d²)]² = 2*(9 - d²). So, area = (2*(9 - d²))/2 = (9 - d²).

Wait, but if that's the case, then the cross-sectional area as a function of d is (9 - d²). Then, to find the volume, I need to integrate this area along the height z. Wait, but what's the relationship between d and z?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The cross-section is taken perpendicular to the base. If the base is a circle, then the cross-sections are taken along lines parallel to the z-axis. So, each cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord at a certain distance d from the center.

Wait, but the chord is at a certain d, so each cross-sectional area is 9 - d², and the height (in the z-direction) of each cross-section would be the length along the z-axis. But I'm not sure how to relate d and z.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-sections are not along z but along the radius. Hmm, maybe I should consider slicing along the radius and integrating the area along the radius.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's model this as a solid of revolution. If the base is a circle, and the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, then the solid is a cylinder, but wait, no. Because the cross-sections are triangles, which are not circular.

Wait, maybe it's a cone. No, because cross-sections are triangles.

Wait, perhaps the solid is a kind of "cone" but with a triangular cross-section.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with a coordinate system. Let me assume that the base is in the xy-plane, and the cross-sections are taken in the plane perpendicular to the base at some point z. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, here's another approach. Since each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse along the base, which is a circle of radius 3. Let's parameterize the cross-sections in terms of the radius r. For each r, the cross-section is a triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the circle with radius 3. The length of the hypotenuse is the chord length, which is 2*sqrt(9 - r²) as we found earlier.

Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the legs are each (2*sqrt(9 - r²)) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(9 - r²). So, the area of the cross-section at radius r is (sqrt(2) * sqrt(9 - r²))² / 2 = (2*(9 - r²))/2 = (9 - r²).

Wait, so the area as a function of r is (9 - r²). So, if we can express z in terms of r, we can integrate the area along the z-axis.

But what is the relationship between r and z? Since the cross-sections are taken perpendicular to the base, and the base is in the xy-plane, the cross-sections would be in planes that are perpendicular to the base. Wait, perhaps each cross-section is taken along the z-axis, so the plane is x = z or y = z, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the cross-sections are taken at a height z from the center. So, the position along the z-axis would mean that the cross-sectional radius is z, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the base. The base is a circle of radius 3, so any cross-section perpendicular to it would be a line segment of length 2*sqrt(9 - d²), where d is the distance from the center. But since the cross-section is a triangle, perhaps we can model it as a function of d.

Wait, maybe the cross-sectional area is (9 - d²), and since the height of each slice is in the z-direction, which is 2*sqrt(9 - d²) long, but that would make the volume integration more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's think about it as slices along a line, not along the radius. For each point along the radius, the cross-sectional area is (9 - d²). Then, integrating this area from d = -3 to d = 3 would give the volume.

Wait, but let me think again. The cross-section at each d is (9 - d²), and the height of each slice (along the z-axis) is 2*sqrt(9 - d²), which is the length of the chord. So, integrating the area over the height would give the volume.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because each cross-section is a triangle, so it's not a slice along the height but rather a triangular area at each d. Therefore, the volume would be the integral from d = 0 to d = 3 of (9 - d²) times the height (2*sqrt(9 - d²)).

Wait, that would be integrating (9 - d²) * 2*sqrt(9 - d²) from d = 0 to d = 3, which would be 2 * integral from 0 to 3 of (9 - d²)^(3/2) * sqrt(9 - d²) = 2 * integral of (9 - d²)^2 * sqrt(9 - d²) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The cross-sectional area is (9 - d²), and the length of the chord is 2*sqrt(9 - d²). So, the volume would be the integral of cross-sectional area times the length along the height. Wait, but I'm not sure how the height relates to d.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is taken along the z-axis, so each cross-section is a triangle with height along the z-axis. Then, the cross-sectional area is (9 - d²), and the height along the z-axis is 2*sqrt(9 - d²). So, the volume would be the integral from d = 0 to d = 3 of (9 - d²) * (2*sqrt(9 - d²)) dd. That would be 2 times the integral from 0 to 3 of (9 - d²)^(3/2) dd.

Wait, but this seems mathematically intensive. Let me compute that integral. Let’s make a substitution: let u = 9 - d². Then, du = -2d dd. Hmm, but that substitution doesn't directly help because the integrand is (9 - d²)^(3/2) dd.

Wait, perhaps a trigonometric substitution would work better. Let me let d = 3 sinθ, where θ ranges from 0 to π/2. Then, 9 - d² = 9 - 9 sin²θ = 9 cos²θ. So, (9 - d²)^(3/2) = (9 cos²θ)^(3/2) = 9^(3/2) (cos²θ)^(3/2) = 27 cos³θ.

Also, dd = 3 cosθ dθ. So, the integral becomes: 2 * ∫ (from θ=0 to θ=π/2) [27 cos³θ] * [3 cosθ dθ] = 2 * ∫ [27 * 3] cos^4θ dθ = 2 * 81 ∫ cos^4θ dθ from 0 to π/2.

So, this integral is 162 times the integral of cos^4θ dθ from 0 to π/2. I remember that the integral of cos^nθ from 0 to π/2 can be expressed using reduction formulas or beta functions.

The formula for the integral of cos^nθ dθ from 0 to π/2 is:

( sqrt(π) * Γ((n + 1)/2) ) ) / ( 2 * Γ( (n + 2)/2 ) ) )

But maybe that's more than I need. Alternatively, for even exponents, the integral can be expressed using the beta function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ∫ cos^4θ dθ using the power-reduction formula.

The power-reduction formula for cos^4θ is:

cos^4θ = (3/8) + (1/2)cos(2θ) + (1/8)cos(4θ).

So, the integral from 0 to π/2 of cos^4θ dθ is:

(3/8) * π/2 + (1/2) * ∫ cos(2θ) dθ + (1/8)* ∫ cos(4θ) dθ evaluated from 0 to π/2.

Compute each term:

First term: (3/8) * (π/2) = 3π/16.

Second term: (1/2) * [ (sin(2θ)/2) ] from 0 to π/2. At θ=π/2, sin(π) = 0. At θ=0, sin(0)=0. So, this term is zero.

Third term: (1/8) * [ (sin(4θ)/4) ] from 0 to π/2. At θ=π/2, sin(2π) = 0. At θ=0, sin(0)=0. So, this term is also zero.

Therefore, the integral ∫ cos^4θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is 3π/16.

So, going back to the volume calculation: the integral was 162 * (3π/16) = 162 * (3π/16) = (162 * 3) π / 16 = 486 π / 16.

Simplify 486 / 16: 486 ÷ 2 = 243; 16 ÷ 2 = 8. So, 243 π / 8.

Wait, but 243 is 3^5. So, 243 / 8 is 30.375, but in terms of pi, it's 243 pi /8.

But looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I did the substitution u = 9 - d², then du = -2d dd. But the integral I'm dealing with is ∫ (9 - d²)^(3/2) dd, which is ∫ u^(3/2) * (-du/(2d)).

But that's getting complicated, and perhaps I should have used the trigonometric substitution approach instead.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to think of the cross-sections as being in slices along the z-axis. So, each cross-section is a triangle with area A(z) and height dz. Then, the volume is the integral from z = -3 to z = 3 of A(z) dz.

But in this problem, the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, which is a circle. So, the cross-sections would be taken along lines that are perpendicular to the base, which are the z-axis if the base is the xy-plane.

Wait, perhaps each cross-section is taken along the z-axis, so the cross-sections are in planes perpendicular to the base. So, each cross-section is a triangle in the plane z = constant. But the base is a circle, so perhaps the cross-sections are in planes perpendicular to the base, which are the same as the planes perpendicular to the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's think of the solid as a cone whose base is a circle of radius 3, and whose height is also 3, but with a different cross-sectional area.

Wait, but the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles. So, perhaps each cross-section is a triangle whose legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is a chord.

Wait, but earlier, I found that the area of the cross-section at radius r is (9 - r²). So, if I can integrate (9 - r²) times the height in the z-direction, but I'm not sure how the height relates to r.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as slices along the radial direction. So, for each r, the cross-section is a triangle with area A(r) = (9 - r²), and the height along the z-axis is the length of the chord at radius r, which is 2*sqrt(9 - r²).

Wait, so the volume would be the integral from r = 0 to r = 3 of A(r) * (height) dr. That would be ∫ (9 - r²) * 2*sqrt(9 - r²) dr from 0 to 3.

Which simplifies to ∫ 2*(9 - r²)^(3/2) dr from 0 to 3.

Hmm, that integral is similar to the one I computed earlier. Let's compute that.

We can use substitution: let u = 9 - r², then du = -2r dr. Wait, but that substitution doesn't directly help because we have (9 - r²)^(3/2). Alternatively, perhaps we can use trigonometric substitution.

Let me let r = 3 sinθ, so that when r=3, sinθ=1, θ=π/2. Then, dr = 3 cosθ dθ.

Then, u = 9 - r² = 9 - 9 sin²θ = 9 cos²θ.

So, (9 - r²)^(3/2) = (9 cos²θ)^(3/2) = 9^(3/2) (cos²θ)^(3/2) = 27 cos^3θ.

Then, the integral becomes:

∫ 2 * (27 cos^3θ) * (3 cosθ dθ) = 2 * 27 * 3 ∫ cos^4θ dθ.

Wait, no: Wait, the substitution is u = 9 - r², du = -2r dr, but in this case, we're dealing with ∫ 2*(9 - r²)^(3/2) dr.

Wait, but the substitution was r = 3 sinθ, so dr = 3 cosθ dθ.

So, the integral becomes:

∫ 2 * 27 cos^3θ * 3 cosθ dθ = 2 * 27 * 3 ∫ cos^4θ dθ.

Wait, no, let me be precise.

Wait, the integral after substitution is:

∫ 2 * (9 - r²)^(3/2) dr = ∫ 2 * (9 cos²θ)^(3/2) * 3 cosθ dθ.

So, (9 cos²θ)^(3/2) = 27 cos^3θ.

So, the integral becomes:

2 * 27 cos^3θ * 3 cosθ dθ = 2 * 27 * 3 ∫ cos^4θ dθ = 162 ∫ cos^4θ dθ.

We've already computed that ∫ cos^4θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is 3π/16.

So, the integral becomes 162 * (3π/16) = (162 * 3) π / 16 = 486 π / 16.

Simplify 486 / 16: 486 ÷ 2 = 243; 16 ÷ 2 = 8. So, 243 π / 8.

Wait, but 243 is 3^5, so 243 π /8 is the volume.

Looking at the options, option D is 243π/8.

So, the correct answer should be D.
</think>

To find the volume of the solid, we model it as slices along the radius. Each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse a chord of the circle. The area of each cross-section is (9 - r²), and integrating this along the radius from 0 to 3 gives the volume.

Using trigonometric substitution, we compute the integral:

\[
\int_{0}^{3} (9 - r^2) \cdot 2\sqrt{9 - r^2} \, dr = 162 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos^4{\theta} \, d\theta = \frac{243}{8} \pi
\]

Thus, the volume is **D**, \( \frac{243\pi}{8} \).

**Answer:** D
