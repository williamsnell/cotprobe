Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about additional terms in a merchant's acceptance. I remember from my studies that when merchants agree to additional terms, those terms have to be part of the contract. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true. Let's go through each option step by step.

Option A: "They become part of the contract only if both parties are merchants." Hmm, I think when merchants agree to additional terms, the contract probably starts to form. But does it require both to be merchants? Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe only one has to agree, or it's a mutual agreement regardless of their roles. I'm not certain, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: "They become part of the contract only if the offeree does not object within a reasonable time." Well, if the offeree objects quickly, maybe the contract doesn't form. Or does it require a reasonable time for the offeree to not object before the contract is agreed? I think there's a rule that if the offeree objects within a reasonable time, the contract is void. So this statement might be true.

Option C: "They become part of the contract only if the offeree agrees to them within a reasonable time." That sounds correct. If the offeree doesn't agree within a reasonable time, the contract might not form. So C is probably a true statement.

Option D: "Additional terms always become part of the contract." I don't think that's true. There are exceptions, like if the terms are oral and not written. So D is false, which makes it a possible answer if other options are true.

Option E: "They become part of the contract only if the additional terms are in writing." That makes sense because unless written, the terms might not stick. So E might be a true statement.

Option F: "They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement." Altering could mean changing the terms, which could void the contract. So F is likely correct.

Option G: "They become part of the contract only if the offeror sends a written confirmation within a reasonable time." Yes, I remember that merchants must confirm their acceptance in writing within a reasonable time to avoid the contract being void. So G is a true statement.

Option H: "They never become part of the contract." No, that's false because merchants usually require the terms to be in writing and agreed upon within a reasonable time. So H is the opposite of true.

Option I: "They become part of the contract unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer." I'm not sure about this. Does a limitation mean the terms are already in the contract? Or does it mean the offerer's terms are limited, so the additional terms might exclude them? I think a limitation would prevent the additional terms from being accepted, so I'm not sure about this. Maybe I should think about it differently. For example, if the offerer says they can't accept beyond a certain point, then the additional terms might not be accepted. So perhaps this is a true statement.

Option J: "They become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time to the additional terms." If the offeror objects, then the contract is void. So J is correct.

So let's recap:

A: Not sure if both merchants are required. Maybe only one needs to agree, but perhaps for a contract to form, both should agree. Not sure.

B: If the offeree doesn't object quickly, the contract forms. But if they do, it's void. So B's statement is correct because the offeree doesn't object within a reasonable time (which would mean the contract doesn't form).

C: The offeree must agree to the terms within a reasonable time. So C is correct.

D: False, because terms can be oral or unrecorded.

E: Correct, because written terms are necessary.

F: Correct, alteration voids the contract.

G: Correct, the offer must confirm in writing.

H: Incorrect, because terms may be altered.

I: Correct. A limitation would prevent additional terms, so the additional terms can't be accepted.

J: Correct, because objecting voids the contract unless it's within reasonable time.

The question is asking which is NOT true. So looking for the false statement.

A: Not sure. If both agree in writing, is the contract formed? I think the offeree only needs to agree in writing, but the question is about whether the terms become part of the contract only if both are merchants. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

If both are merchants, but they don't agree, then the contract might not form. But the question is whether the terms become part of the contract only if both are merchants. So if both agree, then the contract is formed. But if they don't, it doesn't. So the statement in A says the terms become part of the contract only if both are merchants. That's true because if either isn't, the contract isn't formed. So A is correct.

Wait, that would mean all the statements except one are correct. Which one is not true.

Wait, the options: which is not true. So looking for the statement that is false.

Option H: "They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement." If the terms are altered, like changed, does that void the contract? I think altering terms could void it. So H is correct.

So which one is incorrect? Let me re-examine:

A: They become part of the contract only if both are merchants. Well, does that mean that without both being merchants, the terms don't form? Or that the contract is formed only when both are merchants? Or is it that both have to agree, regardless of their roles?

Wait, merchants are usually involved in transactions, so they'd agree to terms. But perhaps the contract can form when both are merchants, but only if they agree. So the statement in A says the terms become part of the contract only if both are merchants. That would mean that if either isn't a merchant, the contract doesn't form. But merchants might not necessarily be the only ones involved in the agreement. For example, if a merchant and a non-merchant agree, the contract forms. So the statement in A is correct.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the requirement. When merchants enter into a new agreement, the contract is formed when both agree to terms, regardless of their roles. So the statement in A says that the terms become part of the contract only if both are merchants. But perhaps it's not necessary for both to be merchants; they just have to agree. So the statement in A would be incorrect if both don't have to be merchants. Because, for example, a merchant and a non-merchant could enter into a contract. So the statement in A is not entirely accurate.

Wait, but the question is about additional terms. So the additional terms are added to the agreement. So if both parties agree to them, the contract becomes part of it. But the statement in A says that the terms become part of the contract only if both are merchants. So if only one is a merchant, the terms may not form. But merchants are involved in transactions, so maybe both have to be. So perhaps the statement in A is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, because the additional terms may be altered, which could void the contract. So if the additional terms are altered, it doesn't become part of the contract. So H is correct.

So looking back, which option is NOT true.

Wait, the question is which is not true. So which is false.

Option H says "They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement." So if the additional terms are altered, the contract is void. Therefore, the terms only become part of the contract if they're not altered. So H is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: ... if both are merchants.

B: ... only if the offeree doesn't object within a reasonable time.

C: ... within a reasonable time.

D: Always.

E: ... in writing.

F: Unless they alter.

G: ... sends written confirmation.

H: ... unless they alter.

I: Unless the offerer limits.

J: Unless the offerer objects.

So the options that are correct are B, C, E, F, G, I, J. Only A and D are false.

Wait, no, perhaps I was wrong about A.

Wait, the correct rule is that for the additional terms to be part of the contract, the offeror must send a written confirmation within a reasonable time. So the terms only form if that's done. So the statement in G says that: "They become part of the contract only if the offeror sends a written confirmation within a reasonable time." So G is correct.

So which option is not true? The question is which statement is not true.

So reviewing:

Looking for a statement that is false.

Option H: "They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement." So if the additional terms are altered, it doesn't form. So H is correct.

Option D: "They always become part of the contract." That's not true because if the agreement is oral or unrecorded, the terms may not be in writing, so the additional terms may not form. So D is false.

So the question is asking for the statement that is NOT true. So the answer is D.

To determine which statement about additional terms proposed in the acceptance of a merchant's agreement is NOT true, let's analyze each option carefully:

- **Option A**: "They become part of the contract only if both parties are merchants." This is true because both parties must agree to the additional terms, and merchants are typically involved in transactions. However, this statement may not be entirely accurate if either party is not a merchant but still agrees to the terms.

- **Option B**: "They become part of the contract only if the offeree does not object within a reasonable time." This is true because if the offeree objects quickly, the contract may be void. Thus, the additional terms are only accepted if the offeree does not object within a reasonable timeframe.

- **Option C**: "They become part of the contract only if the offeree agrees to them within a reasonable time." This is true because the offeree must confirm the terms in writing within a reasonable time to avoid the contract being void.

- **Option D**: "They always become part of the contract." This is false because terms can be oral, unrecorded, or unwritten, meaning additional terms may not form.

- **Option E**: "They become part of the contract only if the additional terms are in writing." This is true because unless written, the terms may not stick, voiding the contract.

- **Option F**: "They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement." This is true because altering terms could void the contract.

- **Option G**: "They become part of the contract only if the offeror sends a written confirmation within a reasonable time." This is true because the terms must be accepted in writing within a reasonable time frame.

- **Option H**: "They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement." This is true because altering terms voids the contract.

- **Option I**: "They become part of the contract unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer." This is true because limiting terms prevents additional acceptance.

- **Option J**: "They become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time to the additional terms." This is true because refusing to accept voids the contract.

After analyzing all options, the false statement is **Option D**, as additional terms do not always become part of the contract; they depend on various factors such as the terms being in writing, agreed upon, and unaltered.
