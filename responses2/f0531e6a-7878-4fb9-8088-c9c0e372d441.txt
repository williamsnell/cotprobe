Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When the Portuguese go from Macao in China to Japan, they carry much white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain: and they bring from Japan nothing but silver. They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.
When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Portuguese trade patterns and a historical development that undid those patterns. Let's try to break this down.

The first paragraph talks about the Portuguese going from Macao to Japan, carrying specific items like silk, gold, etc. They bring nothing from Japan except silver. They have a carrack yearly, and they get coins from India each year, which is a lot—two thousand plus more than the coins they bring from Japan. So this mentions a lot of silver and their ability to increase their wealth there.

The question is asking which development from the period 1450-1750 undid these trade patterns. The options are A to D, each a different event from that period.

Looking at the options:

A: The eastward expansion of Russia. That's probably about expansion of the Russian Empire, which is more about geography than trade. Not sure if it affects their trade patterns.

B: Portuguese conquest of India. Wait, but the first paragraph doesn't mention the Portuguese taking India. Oh wait, no, the first paragraph is about Macao to Japan, the content is different. So if option B is about the Portuguese taking India, but the question's first paragraph is about Macao to Japan, perhaps the answer is about another event.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first paragraph is about the Portuguese going from Macao to Japan, carrying specific goods. So the main point is about trade patterns in these regions. Which historical event in the specified period would disrupt that trade?

Option B: The Portuguese conquest of India. Hmm. I thought the Portuguese actually did take India in the 16th century, like the Mughal Empire. But the period given is 1450-1750. Maybe the event is about the introduction of something that disrupts trade.

Option D: Spanish conquest of Mexico. That's a big event, but I'm not sure if it directly relates to the first paragraph. The first paragraph might be about a different part of the world, like Japan and Macao.

Wait, the first paragraph is about trading with Japan, Macao, and some other places. The options are about events in 1450-1750. So which one undid the trade patterns mentioned.

Let me think. The first paragraph's trade items are silk, gold, etc. So, the Portuguese were trading with gold, silk, etc., which were heavy and valuable. They bring silver, which is cheaper. So their trade was probably in high-value, gold, silver goods.

If the Portuguese were able to get a lot of silver from India, that might have made their trade in gold and silver more profitable. But the first paragraph mentions that they carry much white silk and gold, and bring nothing from Japan except silver. So any factor that makes their trade in gold and silver more profitable might have been disrupted.

Wait, the question is which event undid the trade patterns. So perhaps the event caused a shift in their trade. For example, the introduction of gold or silver into regions where they were trading.

Looking at the options, option B is the Portuguese taking over India. If the Portuguese had taken control of India, perhaps they would have been able to trade more in gold and silver, which would have increased their profit, thus changing their trade patterns.

Alternatively, option D is the Spanish conquest of Mexico. But the first paragraph is about the Portuguese going to Japan, not Mexico. So that's probably not it.

Wait, the first paragraph is about the Portuguese going from Macao to Japan. The options are about events in 1450-1750. So the options B and D are about other regions. So the problem is, which of these events caused a change in the trade patterns that were mentioned in the first paragraph.

The first paragraph's trade description includes gold, silver, silk, etc. So the event that caused the Portuguese to change their trade patterns might have been the introduction of gold or silver into regions they were trading. But the options don't have such a thing.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Option B is the Portuguese taking control of India. If the Portuguese had taken over India, they would have had access to more gold and silver, which could have changed their trade—maybe they were less profitable in their previous trade routes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the event that disrupts their trade patterns—like the introduction of a new metal, like silver, which the first paragraph says they brought nothing from Japan except silver. Oh wait, the first paragraph says they bring nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps if the Portuguese had access to more silver, their trade in other regions (like Japan) would become less profitable. But in the first paragraph, they're bringing silver, not gold.

Wait, but the first paragraph's trade includes gold, silk, etc. So maybe the introduction of gold or silver could have changed their trade patterns.

But I'm not certain. Another angle: the first paragraph's trade mentions gold and silver as imported, and nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps the event that made the trade more expensive (like introducing gold) would have made their trade in Japan less profitable, thus changing their patterns.

Wait, but the options don't directly relate. Let's think of each option:

A. Eastward expansion of Russia: That's a political expansion, not directly about trade. So probably not the answer.

B. Portuguese conquest of India: If they took control of India, they would have more gold, silver, and spices, which could have changed their trade patterns. But I'm not sure how this would directly affect their previous trading patterns in Macao and Japan.

D. Spanish conquest of Mexico: That's about introducing more gold and spices, which would have changed their trade in areas like the Americas.

Hmm, but the first paragraph is about regions they went to—Macao, Japan, and perhaps others. So the event that would cause their trade in those regions to change would be something that made their trade more or less profitable.

Looking for which event would cause their trade to change. For example, if the Portuguese had access to cheaper metals or new resources, they might trade more in certain areas.

But none of the options directly relate to that, except perhaps option B if it introduced gold.

Alternatively, the question is about the period 1450-1750, so events within that time.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: The Portuguese took control of India. If they did, they'd have access to more gold and spices, which would have changed their trade patterns. For example, their trade in Japan might have become less profitable if they could import cheaper gold and silver. But I'm not sure if this was a direct cause of their trading patterns.

Wait, the first paragraph is about the Portuguese going to Macao and Japan, and bringing much gold and silk. They bring nothing from Japan except silver. So, maybe the introduction of silver into their trade made their trade in Japan less profitable. But the options don't mention silver; the first paragraph says they bring nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps the event that made their trade patterns different is the opportunity to trade in gold and silver.

Wait, another angle: the first paragraph's trade mentions gold and silk. Maybe the event that made their trade in gold and silver more profitable. For example, the introduction of a new currency or metal.

But none of the options directly relate to that. So perhaps the correct answer is B, the Portuguese taking over India. Because if they had more gold and silver, their trade in those regions would have changed. But I'm not fully certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the event that disrupted their trade was the introduction of gold, which would have changed their trade patterns in other regions. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the question is which development from the specified period undid the trade patterns. So the options are about events that caused a change. Let's think about the options:

Option B: The Portuguese took control of India. If they had more resources there, their trade patterns might have changed. But I'm not sure if that was the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the event that disrupted their trade would be the introduction of a metal that made their trade more expensive elsewhere.

But the options don't directly point to that. So maybe the correct answer is option B. Because the Portuguese taking control of India may have allowed them to import more gold and spices, which would have changed their trade patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, the Portuguese taking over India, because if they had more gold and spices, then their trade in Japan (which was mainly gold and silver) would have become less profitable, thus changing their trade patterns.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Another approach: what's the first paragraph about? It's about the portalki going to Japan, and bringing gold and silk, and bringing nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps the event that affected their trade in those regions was the introduction of gold. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are about events during 1450-1750. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is the Portuguese taking control of India. If that happened, their trade in other regions would have changed. For example, if they could import more gold, their trade in areas that used to rely on gold would become less profitable. But the first paragraph doesn't mention any gold imports except from Japan.

Wait, the first paragraph says they bring nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps the event that caused their trade in Japan to be less profitable was the introduction of gold, but that's not in the options.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, because the introduction of gold into India would have made their trade in that region (like Java) more profitable, but the first paragraph's trade includes gold, so that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Because that would have introduced more gold and spices into the regions, making their trade more expensive in areas like the Americas, which might have affected their trade patterns elsewhere.

Wait, but the first paragraph talks about Macao, Japan, and perhaps the East China (which is near Macao). So maybe the introduction of gold or silver into the East China region would have changed the trade patterns.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about each option's impact.

A: Eastward expansion of Russia. This would affect trade in other regions, but the first paragraph's focus is on Macao, Japan, so probably not the answer.

B: Portuguese took control of India. That would likely have had a huge impact on their trade in India, which would have changed their trading patterns, but I'm not sure if it directly affects the trade in Macao and Japan as described.

D: Spanish conquest of Mexico. This would have introduced gold and spices, which may have affected their trade in regions like the Americas, but the first paragraph is about Macao, Japan, so perhaps that's not the main point. Also, the first paragraph doesn't mention the Spanish, so maybe D is not the answer.

Wait, the first paragraph talks about the trade in Macao, Japan, and elsewhere. The options are about events in 1450-1750. So which event would disrupt their trade in those areas.

Option B: The Portuguese took over India. That would have allowed them to trade more in gold and spices, which could have changed their trade in areas like Java, which the first paragraph mentions as a region.

Wait, the first paragraph mentions the portalki going to Macao, which is in China. So the event that would change their trade in areas like Java or the East China region (near Macao) is the taking control of India, which would have offered more resources.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the event that caused the portalki to change their trade was the introduction of silver, which they bring. Wait, no, the first paragraph says they bring silver, not gold.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option B. Because the portalki took control of India, which would have allowed them to import more gold and spices, changing their trade patterns in areas that used to be dependent on Japan's exports.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Because that would have introduced gold and spices, which would have made the portalki's trade in areas like the Americas more expensive, thus changing their patterns.

Wait, but the first paragraph doesn't mention Mexico, so perhaps that's not the case. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

But I'm not confident. Another way: think about the options. The first paragraph mentions that the portalki carried gold, silk, etc., and nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps the event that made it cheaper to import gold and silver would have affected their trade.

But the options don't directly cause that. So perhaps the correct answer is B, the portalki took control of India, because that would have given them access to more resources, which could have changed their trade patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, the portalki took control of India, which would have allowed them to import more gold and spices, thus changing their trade patterns in areas like Java, which the first paragraph refers to.

Wait, but the first paragraph doesn't mention that. Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the answer choices and what each represents.

If the portalki took control of India (option B), they'd have access to more gold and spices, which could have made their trade in regions like Java more profitable. But the first paragraph doesn't mention Java. Alternatively, the event might have allowed them to import more gold and silver, thus making their trade in Japan (which used to be imported mainly from Japan) more profitable, but the first paragraph says they bring nothing from Japan except silver, so that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate. That's about the Japanese rule, but the first paragraph is about the portalki's trade. So maybe the event that changed the portalki's trade is another Japanese event.

Wait, but the options are about events in the 1450-1750 period, which includes the Tokugawa Shogunate's establishment. So if the portalki went to Japan and brought silver, perhaps the Tokugawa Shogunate's rule had some effect. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the first paragraph says they go from Macao to Japan. Perhaps the Tokugawa Shogunate is about Japanese expansion, but I'm not connecting it.

Wait, the first paragraph's trade includes gold and silk, and no from Japan except silver. So perhaps the event that introduced gold into India (option B) would have changed their trade. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, the correct answer is B because the portalki took control of India, which would have allowed them to trade more in the East, which would have increased their profit and changed their trade patterns.

So, after thinking through all this, I think the correct answer is B: The Portuguese conquest of India. Because if they had control of India, they would have more resources, which could have altered their trade patterns in areas like Java. But I'm not 100% certain, but that's the best I can think of.

The question focuses on identifying which historical event from the period 1450–1750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph, which describe the portalki (Chinese portalki)'s trade involving gold, silk, and other valuable items, as well as their dependence on silver from Japan, with less import from Japan except silver.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: The eastward expansion of Russia**  
   This refers to the Russian expansion into the East, which primarily affects geography rather than trade. It does not directly impact the portalki's trade patterns in Macao, Japan, or other regions described in the first paragraph. Therefore, this is unlikely to be the correct answer.

2. **Option B: The Portuguese conquest of India**  
   If the portalki had taken control of India, it would have provided them with access to more gold, spices, and resources, potentially altering their trade patterns in regions like Java. However, the first paragraph does not explicitly mention the introduction of gold or spices, which would be a direct cause of the portalki's trade changes. While plausible, it is not the most direct explanation.

3. **Option C: The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogun**  
   This pertains to Japanese rule, which occurred during the same period. The Tokugawa Shogunate's rule would have influenced the portalki's trade dynamics, but the question specifically asks about events in the 1450–1750 period, and the Tokugawa Shogunate is more related to Japanese history than the portalki's trade patterns. Thus, this is less relevant.

4. **Option D: The Spanish conquest of Mexico**  
   This event introduced gold and spices, which could have made the portalki's trade in regions like the Americas more expensive. However, the first paragraph does not mention Mexico, and the focus is on the portalki's trade in Macao, Japan, and possibly the East China. Therefore, this is not the most direct cause of the trade changes described.

### Conclusion:
The portalki's trade patterns were most directly undid by the **Portugal taking control of India** (Option B), as this would have introduced more resources into their trade, potentially altering their patterns in regions like Java. However, the first paragraph does not explicitly mention gold, making this explanation less directly relevant. Despite this nuance, Option B is the most plausible answer based on the options provided.
