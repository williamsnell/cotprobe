Okay, so I've got this question about translating a statement into predicate logic. The statement is "Johnny came late." Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to break down the statement. The main subject is "Johnny," which is a name, so it's a constant. The verb here is "came late." I'm not sure if "late" is a verb or an adjective. I think it's a verb, but I'm not 100% certain. Wait, "came late" sounds like a past tense verb, so maybe it's a verb. So the entire statement is a subject (Johnny) and a verb (came late).

Now, in predicate logic, we usually talk about whether something is true or false. So, maybe the statement is a predicate. But wait, the way it's phrased is "Johnny came late," which doesn't have a predicate attached. It's more like an assertion about Johnny.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see, the options are all in terms of Lj and Cj. I'm not sure what Lj and Cj mean. Oh, perhaps Lj stands for "Johnny is late" and Cj stands for "Johnny came." So, the statement could be a conjunction of these two: Johnny is late and Johnny came. So, that would be Cj ∧ Lj. Looking at the options, that's option F: Lj ∧ Cj. Wait, no, it's Cj ∧ Lj, so option F is Lj ∧ Cj, which is the same as Cj ∧ Lj because AND is commutative.

Alternatively, if I'm to interpret it as Johnny came late, perhaps it's just "Johnny came late" as a predicate. But the options don't have a predicate, they're all about Johnny's state.

Wait, another possibility: "came late" might just be an adjective describing Johnny's behavior. But in predicate logic, it's more about a predicate attached to the subject. So, if the statement is "Johnny came late," perhaps it's a predicate that describes Johnny's state, but I'm not sure how to represent that.

Wait, let's think again. The statement is "Johnny came late." So, the subject is Johnny, and the predicate is "came late." But in predicate logic, the predicate is a predicate, not a verb. So, maybe the verb is part of the predicate. Alternatively, perhaps "came late" is a predicate indicating Johnny's state.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to see that the sentence is a predicate of Johnny. So, "Johnny came late" is the predicate, so in logic terms, it's a predicate P(j) where P is "came late" and j is Johnny. But looking at the options, none of them seem to have a predicate. Instead, they're about Johnny's state.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The options are all about Johnny's state: whether he is late (Lj) or came (Cj). So, "Johnny came late" could be interpreted as him coming (Cj) and being late (Lj). So, the statement is a conjunction of these two: Cj ∧ Lj. Looking at the options, option F is Lj ∧ Cj, which is the same as Cj ∧ Lj. So that would be option F.

Alternatively, if someone misreads it as just "came late" as a predicate, but that doesn't fit the options. Let me check the options again:

A: Lj ∨ Cj → OR of late and came.

B: Lj → Only late.

C: L∧j → Wait, that's probably a typo, maybe Lj ∧ something.

D: jC → Not sure what that means.

E: j ∨ L → Johnny or was late.

F: Lj ∧ Cj → Johnny came late.

G: Cj ∨ Lj → Johnny either came or is late.

H: Lx → Johnny is late.

I: jL → Johnny is late.

J: Cx → Johnny came.

Wait, the original statement is "Johnny came late." So, perhaps it's a predicate that Johnny is late, but in that case, the subject is Johnny, and the predicate is "came late." But in predicate logic, the predicate is attached to the subject, so it would be something like came late(Johnny). But the options don't include that, they're all about Johnny's state.

Alternatively, perhaps "came late" is a predicate, so Johnny is in a state where he came late. But the options don't have a predicate. So, the statement "Johnny came late" is asserting Johnny's state. So, if "came late" is a state, perhaps it's represented as a predicate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps "came late" is a predicate, so the sentence "Johnny came late" is a predicate applied to Johnny. So, if the predicate is P, then P(j) would be Johnny came late. But in the options, I don't see any of that. So maybe none of the options correctly represent this, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking again, the options are all about Johnny's state: whether he is late (Lj) or came (Cj). So the statement is "Johnny came late," which could be interpreted as Johnny is late and came, which would be Cj ∧ Lj. So, that's option F: Lj ∧ Cj. So, the answer is F.

Alternatively, if "late" is a verb, perhaps it's just Cj, but that would be the statement that Johnny came. But the question says he came late, which implies both came and late. So, the correct translation would be both are true: Cj ∧ Lj. Which is option F.

The correct translation of the statement "Johnny came late" is that Johnny came (Cj) and Johnny is late (Lj). This is represented as Cj ∧ Lj. Looking at the options, this corresponds to option F: Lj ∧ Cj.

Answer: F
