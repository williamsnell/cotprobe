Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Brown's sales commission. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of questions, but I'll take it slow.

The question says Mr. Brown earns a 1% commission on all his sales. But there's an additional 1.5% if he sells more than $1,000,000. He sold $1,200,000 worth of goods. I need to calculate how much he earned in total.

Hmm, first, I should break it down. The total commission is two parts: the base commission and the bonus. The base is 1% of the total sales, and the bonus is 1.5% of the sales over $1 million.

Wait, the total sales are $1,200,000. So the first part is 1% of that. Let me calculate the base commission. 1% of $1,200,000 is straightforward. 1% is 0.01, so 0.01 * 1,200,000 = $12,000.

But wait, no, because the bonus is only applied if he exceeds $1M. So the first $1M is 1%, and anything above that is the 1.5%. So let's see, his total sales are $1,200,000, which is $200,000 above $1M. So the bonus is 1.5% on $200,000.

So the bonus is 1.5% of $200,000. Let me calculate that: 0.015 * 200,000. Hmm, 0.015 times 200,000. 0.01 is 2,000, so 0.015 is 2,000 * 1.5 = 3,000. So the bonus is $3,000.

Now, total commission is base plus bonus: $12,000 + $3,000 = $15,000. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is $15,000. That matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Am I adding them correctly? Let me double-check. The base is 1% of $1,200,000, which is $12,000. The bonus is 1.5% on $200,000, which is $3,000. So yes, $12k + $3k = $15k. So the answer should be C, $15,000.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options, option C is $15,000. So that's the one. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh, wait, another way to think about it: the base is 1% on $1M, which is $10,000, and the bonus is 1.5% on $200k, which is $3,000. So total is $13,000? Wait, no, that would be $10k + $3k = $13k. But that can't be right because that would be 13k, which isn't one of the options. Wait, maybe I did a miscalculation.

Wait, no. Let me do it again. Base is 1% of $1,200,000. Let me compute 1% of 1,200,000. 1% is the same as 0.01, so 0.01 * 1,200,000 is 12,000. Correct. Then, the amount above $1M is 200,000. 1.5% of 200,000 is 3,000. So 12k +3k is 15k. So option C, yes. So the correct answer should be option C: $15,000.

The correct calculation involves two parts: the base commission at 1% of total sales and the bonus at 1.5% on sales exceeding $1M. 

Total sales: $1,200,000.  
Base commission: 1% of $1,200,000 = $12,000.  
Bonus: 1.5% on ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) = 1.5% of $200,000 = $3,000.  
Total commission: $12,000 + $3,000 = $15,000.

Answer: C: $15,000.
