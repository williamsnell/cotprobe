Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about calculating the electrostatic force between two point charges. The charges are both 1.00 Coulombs and they're separated by 1.00 meters. The question is asking for the magnitude of the force, and the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right, I remember that the formula for Coulomb's law is F equals k times q1 times q2 divided by r squared. Oh wait, q1 and q2 are the charges, r is the distance between them, and k is Coulomb's constant. What's the value of k again?

I think it's 8.988 times 10^9 N·m²/C². I'm pretty sure that's the value they use in these problems. So, k is approximately 8.99e9 N·m²/C².

The charges are both 1.00 C. So, q1 is 1, q2 is 1. The distance r is 1.00 meters.

Plugging those values into the formula: F = (8.99e9) * (1) * (1) / (1)^2. That simplifies to 8.99e9 N. Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 8.99e9 N, which matches what I just calculated.

Wait a second, let me check the options again. Option I is 8.99e9 N. So that's the answer. But wait, what's the exact value of k that I should use here? Oh, right, sometimes problems round it to 9e9, but in this case, the options include 8.99e9, which is precise. So, I think option I is correct.

Wait, but why are the other options different? Let me make sure I haven't made any mistakes. So, Coulomb's law is F = k (q1 q2) / r squared. Since both are 1, it's k*(1*1)/1^2 = k. So the force is k, which is 8.99e9 N.

Looking at the options, option I is 8.99e9 N, which is exactly what I got. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me go through each to see if I'm missing anything. 

Option A is 7.99e9. Hmm, that would be if k was 7.99e9, which I don't think is the case. So A can't be right.

Option B is 9e10. That's 9 times 10^10, which is 90,000,000,000. That's larger than what I have. So B is way off.

Option C is 5e9. No, that's smaller than what I have. So C is wrong.

Option D is 1.2e8, which is 120 million. That's way too small.

Option E is 1e10. 10 billion? No, I have 8.99e9.

Option F is 2.5e9. Also less than 8.99e9.

Option G is 5e11, which is 50 billion. That's way too big.

Option H is 4.5e9, still lower than 8.99e9.

Option I is 8.99e9, which matches our calculation. So I think I is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing—could the charges be something else? The question says 1.00 C each. So, nope. What if the formula uses a different k? No, that's not the case. The standard k is around 9e9, but in this case, the exact value depends on what's used. So using 8.99e9 is accurate here.

So, yeah, option I is the right choice. The magnitude of the force is 8.99e9 N, which is option I.

To determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges, we use Coulomb's law:

\[
F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
\]

Here:
- \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) (Coulomb's constant),
- \( q_1 = 1.00 \, \text{C} \),
- \( q_2 = 1.00 \, \text{C} \),
- \( r = 1.00 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
F = \left(8.99 \times 10^9\right) \frac{(1.00)(1.00)}{(1.00)^2} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N}.
\]

This matches option I. The other options are either too small or too large to be correct based on the calculation.
