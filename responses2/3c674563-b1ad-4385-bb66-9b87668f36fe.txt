Question:

A landlord was the owner of a two-story dwelling house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for a 10-year period. Two years after the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement with the landlord, he subleases the house to his cousin. Thereafter, the cousin defaults on the rental payments. If the landlord brings an action to recover the past rent due from the cousin, the landlord will:

Options:

A: not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.
B: recover, because the landlord is the original owner of the house.
C: not recover, because the landlord did not approve the sublease agreement.
D: recover, because there is privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
E: not recover, because there is no privity of contract between the landlord and sublessee.
F: recover, because there is both privity of estate and privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
G: not recover, because the original tenant is responsible for the rent, not the sublessee.
H: recover, because there is privity of estate and privity of contract between the landlord and the original tenant.
I: recover, because the landlord has a right to payment from any tenant occupying the property.
J: recover, because pnvity of estate exists between a landlord and sublessee.

Okay, so I need to answer this question about landlord-protegease law. Let me think through it step by step.

The scenario is that the landlord leased a two-story house to a tenant for 10 years. Two years later, the tenant subleases the house to his cousin. The cousin defaults on the rental payments after that. The landlord wants to recover past rent from the cousin and wants to know if he can do so.

The question is about whether the landlord can recover the past rent. I remember that in property law, there are principles about privity of estate and contract.

First, privity of estate: this is the right of the person to have possession. If someone else has the right to rent the property, then the landlord can recover from them. But wait, the tenant subleases to the cousin. So, the cousin was previously a tenant, but now subrents the house. Does this affect privity?

I think privity of estate is about the right to use the property. Since the cousin now is a subtenant, they have the right to use the property as if they were a tenant. So the landlord has the right to rent to the cousin, which means they can collect rent from them if they default.

But wait, there's something about the original tenant and the subtenant. The original tenant is still the owner, right? But when the tenant subleases, does that affect privity of estate? Or does the sublease situation not directly affect the landlord's ability to collect from the cousin?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think about privity of contract. For the landlord to recover from the tenant, they need to have privity of contract with the tenant. But the tenant's contract is now with the cousin. So, does the landlord still have privity of contract with the original tenant? Or not? I'm getting confused.

Wait, the landlord leased to the original tenant, so he has privity of contract with that tenant. But then the tenant subleases to the cousin. So the original tenant and the cousin are now tenants for the same property. So the original tenant and the cousin have the same privity of contract. But the landlord is asking for past rent, which was from the original tenant.

Wait, but the question is about the past rent. So, the tenant moved out two years before subleasing. So the original tenant was in place for two years. Then, the tenant subleases to the cousin. So, the original tenant is still the owner, but the property is now sublet to the cousin. So, the original tenant is still the owner, so the landlord can collect from the original tenant.

Wait, but the cousin defaults on the sublease. So, does the cousin have the right to collect from the original tenant as well, or does the original tenant have the right to collect from the cousin?

Hmm. The issue is whether the landlord can recover the past rent. The past rent is from the original tenant. So, can the landlord recover from the cousin for the past rent?

Wait, the question is about recovering the past rent due to the cousin. So, does the cousin have a claim against the original tenant for the past rent? Or is the original tenant the original owner, so the landlord can't claim against the cousin?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's think. The original tenant was the one who occupied the property for two years before subleasing. So, they're still the owner. So, the landlord can claim against them for the past two years. So, the cousin, subleasing now, is not a tenant anymore, so he doesn't have a claim against the original tenant for the past rent. So the landlord can't claim against him.

But wait, maybe the privity of estate is such that the original tenant has possession, and the cousin is a subtenant, so the landlord can collect from the cousin for past rent. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, the question is about whether the landlord can recover the past rent. Since the tenant subleases, but the original tenant is still there, the landlord can still claim against the original tenant for the past rent. So the cousin doesn't have a claim against the original tenant, so the landlord can't recover from him.

Wait, but the question says the cousin defaults. So, the landlord can't recover from the cousin because the cousin isn't a tenant anymore. Because the past rent was from the original tenant.

Let me think about the law. The landlord has privity of estate with the original tenant because he can rent to them. So, he can collect from the original tenant if they default. But the cousin is a subtenant, so he's not a tenant for the same purpose. So, the original tenant is still the owner, so the landlord can collect from them, but the cousin can't claim against the original tenant for past rent.

Wait, but the question is whether the landlord can recover the past rent due from the cousin. If the cousin is a subtenant, he can't claim against the original tenant for past rent. So, the landlord can't recover from the cousin. 

Looking at the options:

A: Landlord can't because privity doesn't exist. Privity of estate exists (landlord can rent to original tenant). So A is wrong.

B: Recover because landlord is original owner. No, because the original tenant is still the owner; the cousin isn't a tenant.

C: Landlord didn't approve the sublease. But the question doesn't say the landlord approved it. So the landlord can still recover if he does have privity of contract with the original tenant.

D: Recover because privity of contract exists. But the problem is with the cousin. The privity of contract between landlord and cousin might not exist because the cousin is not a tenant anymore for the same purpose.

E: Landlord can't because no privity of contract. But the original tenant has privity of contract with the landlord. The cousin doesn't have it.

F: Recover because both estate and contract exist. But the cousin doesn't have privity of contract with the landlord.

G: Landlord can't because original tenant is responsible. No, the original tenant is the owner, so if they default, the landlord can claim against them.

H: Recover because privity of estate. Yes, but the cousin doesn't have privity of estate with the landlord.

I: Recover because landlord can get payment from any tenant. But the cousin is a subtenant, so maybe not. But the privity of contract is a factor.

J: Recover because privity of estate. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the question is about the past rent. The original tenant is still the owner, so the landlord can claim against them, not the cousin. So, the cousin can't claim against the original tenant. So the landlord can't recover from the cousin for past rent.

So the correct answer would be that the landlord cannot recover because the cousin doesn't have privity of contract with him. Now, looking at the options, E says the landlord can't because there's no privity of contract. So, E would be correct.

Wait, let me recheck. Landlord's privity of contract with the original tenant exists. Landlord's privity of contract with the cousin does not because he's a subtenant. So, the cousin can't claim against the original tenant, so the landlord can't recover from him for past rent. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
</think>

The landlord cannot recover past rent from the cousin because the cousin does not have privity of contract with the landlord. The cousin is a subtenant, so the landlord lacks the right to claim against them for past rent. The correct answer is E.

**Answer: E**
