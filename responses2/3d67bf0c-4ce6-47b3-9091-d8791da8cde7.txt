Okay, so I've got this economics question here about autonomous increase in spending. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking what an autonomous increase in spending means. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me start by recalling what I know about autonomous spending. I remember that in the Keynesian model, aggregate expenditure is made up of autonomous spending and induced spending. Autonomously, I think that refers to spending that doesn't depend on the level of income. So like, if someone's income increases, autonomous spending probably stays the same, or maybe changes in other ways.

Wait, autonomous spending is the part that doesn't get multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume. Oh right, so autonomous would be the part that's fixed. Like, if the government increases spending, that's autonomous. But it's not dependent on the current level of income because it's not being used to multiply through the multiplier effect.

So the question is about an autonomous increase in spending. That would mean that the government or some external factor is increasing their spending without considering the current level of income. So if, say, the government decides to spend more on infrastructure, that's autonomous because it's not tied to people's income. So the increase in spending is not dependent on the level of income; it's a separate decision.

Looking at the options: 

A: Decrease in total spending due to lower income. No, that's the opposite. Lower income would lead to less spending, not an increase.

B: Increase in spending proportional to income increase. That's more about the multiplier effect. It's not an autonomous increase. Autonomous is a one-time decision.

C: Increase in total spending not from income increase. Hmm. If autonomous spending is increased, it's not tied to income. So the total increase in spending (like maybe a government spending increase) would be independent of current income. So the total could go up, but that's not because it's tied to income. So option C says the increase isn't because of an increase in income. That seems to fit.

D: Increase in income leading to higher spending. That's the multiplier effect, which is a result of induced spending. Autonomous is separate from that.

So the correct answer should be C: An increase in total spending that is not the result of an increase in income. Because autonomous spending is independent of income. So an increase in government spending would lead to an increase in total spending without considering income levels. That makes sense.

The correct answer is C: An increase in total spending that is not the result of an increase in income. Autonomous spending refers to spending that does not depend on the level of income, such as government spending decisions. An increase in autonomous spending leads to an increase in total spending without being tied to current income levels. 

Answer: C
