Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of drawing the ace of diamonds from a shuffled deck. Hmm, let's think. A standard deck has 52 cards, right? And each card is unique, so each has an equal chance of being drawn.

The question is asking about a specific card: the ace of diamonds. I remember that in probability, when you're looking for the chance of a particular outcome, you take the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing the ace of diamonds, which is just one card. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cards in the deck, which is 52. So the probability should be 1 divided by 52.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not overlooking anything. The deck is thoroughly shuffled, so each card is equally likely to be drawn. So no card is favored over another. That makes sense. So the probability is indeed 1/52.

Looking at the options, option H is 1/52. So the correct answer should be H.

The probability of drawing the ace of diamonds is 1/52, as there are 52 unique cards in the deck, each with equal chance.

Answer: H: 1/52
