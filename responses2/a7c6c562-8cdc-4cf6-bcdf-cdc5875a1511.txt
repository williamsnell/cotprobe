Okay, so I've got this problem here about writing a number in expanded form. Let me see. The question says that a post office delivered eighteen thousand ninety-six pieces of mail in a week, and I need to figure out which option correctly represents this number as expanded form.

Hmm, expanded form usually breaks down a number into the sum of each digit multiplied by its place value. So for example, the number 456 in expanded form would be 400 + 50 + 6. Each digit is written out in terms of how many hundreds, tens, or units they represent.

The given number is eighteen thousand ninety-six. Let me write that out as a numerical value. Eighteen thousand is 18,000, and ninety-six is 96. So together, that's 18,000 + 96. Wait, but let me make sure I'm getting the digits right.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 18,000 is 1 ten thousand and 8 thousands. But in the number 18,096, the digits are 1,8,0,9,6. Let's break them down:

- The first digit from the right is 6, which is in the ones place. So that's 6.
- The next is 9, which is in the tens place: 9*10=90.
- Then 0 in the hundreds place: 0*100=0.
- Then 8 in the thousands place: 8,000.
- Then 1 in the ten thousands place: 10,000.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me get the number straight. The number is 18,096. So the digits are 1, 8, 0, 9, 6. Let me write this as 18,096.

So, the place values are:
- 1 is in ten thousands place: 10,000
- 8 is in thousands place: 8,000
- 0 is in hundreds place: 0
- 9 is in tens place: 90
- 6 is in ones place: 6

So expanded form would be the sum of each digit multiplied by its place. So, 10,000 + 8,000 + 0 + 90 + 6. But 0 doesn't contribute anything, so it can be omitted. So, 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 +6.

Wait, looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A: 10,000 + 8,000 + 900 +6 → So 10k +8k +900+6. Wait, but 0 in the hundreds place is missing. So this option has 900 instead of 0. So that's wrong.

Option B: 10,000 + 8,000 +900 +6 → Same issue as A: 900 instead of 90.

Option C: 10,000 +7,000 +100 +96 → 7k is 7,000, which isn't part of our number. Also 96 isn't correct because in the number, it's 96, so 90 +6=96. So no, that's not correct.

Option D: 18 +1,000 +900 +60 → 18 is 18, but in our number it's 18,096, which is 18,000 +96. So 18 would be part of it? Wait, 18,096 is 18,000 plus 96. So 18 is in the tens and ones place? Wait, no, 18,096 is 18 thousand and ninety-six. Wait, 18,000 is 18 thousand, and 96 is ninety-six. So 18,096 is 18,000 +96, which is 10k+8k+90+6. So 18 is in option D as 18, which is incorrect because 18,000 is 10k+8k, not 10k+8k +18. So D is incorrect.

Option E: 18,000 +90 +6 → That's 18,000 +96, which is correct. Because 18,000 +96 is 18,096. So E is 18,000 +90 +6. Wait, 90 is wrong. Because 18,096 is 90 in the tens place. So that's wrong. So E isn't correct.

Option F: 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6 → That's 10k+8k+90+6 = 18,096. Yes, that's correct. Because 18,000 is 10k+8k. So F is 10k+8k+90+6.

Option G: 18 +1,000 +90 +6 → That's 18,100 +96? Wait, 1,000 is 1k, 18 is 18. So 1,000 +18 =1,018. Plus 90 is 1,108. Plus 6 is 1,114. That's much lower than 18,096. So G is wrong.

Option H: 1,000 +8,000 +90 +6 → 9k (9,000) + 8k (8,000) is 17,000. Plus 90 is 17,090, plus 6 is 17,096. That's incorrect because 18,096 is higher. So H is wrong.

Option I: 10,000 +8,000 +100 +6 → 18k +100 +6 = 18,106. That's 18,106, which is 18,000 +106. So it's off by 100. So I is incorrect.

Wait, wait, but looking back, the actual number is 18,096. So the expanded form would be 10k +8k +90 +6. So the correct option is F, which has 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh wait, option F is 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6, which seems correct. But wait, the original number is 18,096, which is 18,000 +96. So 18,000 is 10k +8k. 96 is 90 +6. So the expanded form should be 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6. So option F.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F is 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be F.
</think>

The correct expanded form of 18,096 is 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
