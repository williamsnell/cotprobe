Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and think through what I know.

The problem is about the reaction where carbon dioxide is reduced by hydrogen. The reaction is CO2(g) + H2(g) ⇌ CO(g) + H2O(g). They told me that one mole each of CO2 and H2 are reacted at 825K. At equilibrium, 0.27 atm of CO is present. I need to find the equilibrium constant K.

Hmm, I remember that for equilibrium problems, the ICE table method is usually used. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. Let me try setting that up.

The reaction: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O.

Initial: [CO2] = 1 mol, [H2] = 1 mol. CO and H2O are both zero because the reaction hasn't started yet.

Change: Let me let x be the change. Since CO is 0.27 atm at equilibrium, which is x. So the change would be CO increases by x, and CO2 and H2 would decrease by x each? Wait, no, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So if CO is 0.27, then CO2 and H2 would each decrease by 0.27.

Wait, but the initial moles are 1 each. So initial concentrations are 1 for CO2 and H2. At equilibrium, CO is x, which is 0.27. So CO2 and H2 are each (1 - x) atm.

But wait, let me double-check. The reaction is CO2 + H2 ⇌ CO + H2O. So for every mole of CO2 that reacts, one mole of H2 is used, producing one mole of CO and one of H2O.

So if x is the change in CO, which is 0.27 atm, then the change in CO2 is -x. Similarly, H2 change is -x. CO2 and H2 at equilibrium are (1 - x) each, and CO and H2O are x each.

Wait, but wait a second. Partial pressure is in atm. But since the reaction is in gases, the units are atm. So when setting up ICE, the changes are in atm.

So now, the equilibrium concentrations are:

[CO2] = 1 - x = 1 - 0.27 = 0.73 atm.

[H2] = 1 - x = 0.73 atm.

[CO] = x = 0.27 atm.

[H2O] = x = 0.27 atm.

Wait, but the initial setup was CO2 and H2 each at 1 atm. So when x is 0.27, their concentrations are 0.73 atm each.

Now, the equilibrium expression K is given by the concentrations (or partial pressures, since it's gases) raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

The expression for K is [CO] [H2O] / [CO2] [H2].

Plugging in the values:

K = (0.27) * (0.27) / (0.73) * (0.73).

Wait, because both numerator and denominator have the same terms. Let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.27 * 0.27 = 0.0729.

Denominator: 0.73 * 0.73 = 0.5329.

So K = 0.0729 / 0.5329 ≈ let's compute that.

Hmm, 0.0729 / 0.5329 ≈ roughly 0.137.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.5329 is approximately 0.5329.

0.0729 divided by 0.5329.

Let's compute 729 / 5329. Hmm, 5329 is 73 squared (73x73=5329). 729 is 27 squared (27^2=729).

So 729 / 5329 = (27/73)^2.

So 27/73 is approximately 0.3699.

So (0.3699)^2 = approx 0.1368.

So K ≈ 0.1368, which is about 0.137.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.137. So I think the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I get the reaction equation correctly?

The reaction is CO2 + H2 ⇌ CO + H2O.

Yes. So the stoichiometry is 1:1:1:1. So each mole of CO2 and H2 gives a mole of CO and H2O.

So when x is 0.27, that's correct.

Wait another thing: does the initial amounts matter beyond setting up the ICE table? Like, if the reaction started with 1 mole each, and we're using the change x. But in the setup, since the initial concentrations are 1 each, and x is 0.27, the equilibrium concentrations are 1-x, which is correct.

So the calculation seems right. So K is approximately 0.137, which is option B. So the answer should be B.

To determine the equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction:

\[
\text{CO}_2(g) + \text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons \text{CO}(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(g),
\]

we use the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) method. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of CO is given as 0.27 atm. The initial partial pressures of CO\(_2\) and H\(_2\) are both 1 atm, and H\(_2\)O is initially 0 atm.

1. **Setting up the ICE table:**
   - **Initial concentrations:** \([ \text{CO}_2 ] = 1 \, \text{atm}, \, [ \text{H}_2 ] = 1 \, \text{atm}, \, [ \text{CO} ] = 0 \, \text{atm}, \, [ \text{H}_2\text{O} ] = 0 \, \text{atm}.
   - **Change in concentration:** Let \( x \) be the change in partial pressure of CO. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the changes are:
     - \( [ \text{CO}_2 ] = 1 - x \),
     - \( [ \text{H}_2 ] = 1 - x \),
     - \( [ \text{CO} ] = x \),
     - \( [ \text{H}_2\text{O} ] = x \).
   - **Equilibrium concentrations:**
     - \( [ \text{CO}_2 ] = 1 - x = 0.73 \, \text{atm} \),
     - \( [ \text{H}_2 ] = 1 - x = 0.73 \, \text{atm} \),
     - \( [ \text{CO} ] = x = 0.27 \, \text{atm} \),
     - \( [ \text{H}_2\text{O} ] = x = 0.27 \, \text{atm} \).

2. **Equilibrium constant expression:**
   \[
   K = \frac{[ \text{CO} ][ \text{H}_2\text{O} ]}{[ \text{CO}_2 ][ \text{H}_2 ]}.
   \]
   Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:
   \[
   K = \frac{(0.27)(0.27)}{(0.73)(0.73)}.
   \]

3. **Calculating \( K \):**
   - Numerator: \( (0.27)(0.27) = 0.0729 \),
   - Denominator: \( (0.73)(0.73) = 0.5329 \),
   - \( K = \frac{0.0729}{0.5329} \approx 0.137 \).

Thus, the equilibrium constant \( K \) is approximately 0.137. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
