Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the wavelength and energy of a photon associated with the series limit of the Lyman series. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's see if I can work through this.

First, I remember that the Lyman series is part of the hydrogen atom's emission spectrum. Right, and the Lyman series has photons with wavelengths in the ultraviolet range. Oh wait, the series limit would be the shortest wavelength in that series, right? Because the limit is the smallest possible wavelength—a photon can't have zero energy, so the limit is when the photon just starts to have enough energy to cause the electron to drop into the ground state.

Wait, the formula for the wavelengths in the Lyman series comes from the Rydberg formula, right? The Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where n1 is the principal quantum number for the final state and n2 is the initial. Since this is the Lyman series, n1 should be 1, because the electron is moving back to the ground state (n=1). So the formula becomes 1/lambda = R (1/1² - 1/n2²). 

Wait, but what's the value of the Rydberg constant? I think the Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m⁻¹, but I might be mixing it up. Wait, isn't the Rydberg constant R = 1.097e7 m⁻¹? Oh no, no, wait. Let me get this right. The Rydberg constant is about 1.097373e7 m⁻¹. So yeah, 1.097e7 m⁻¹.

So when the electron transitions from higher energy levels (n2) to the ground state (n1=1), the series limit occurs when n2 is approaching infinity. Because as n2 becomes very large, 1/n2 squared approaches zero. So in the limit, the Rydberg term becomes R*(1 - 0) = R. So 1/lambda = R.

Wait, no. Because 1/lambda = R (1 - 1/n2²). As n2 approaches infinity, 1/n2² approaches zero, so 1/lambda = R*(1-0) = R. So lambda = 1/(R).

But wait, correct me if I'm wrong. The formula is 1/lambda = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²). So n1 is 1.

So substituting n1=1, 1/lambda = R (1 - 1/n2^2). For the series limit, which is when n2 is infinity, the term 1/n2² becomes zero. So 1/lambda = R*(1) → lambda = R / R → wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 1/lambda = R*(1 - 0) → 1/lambda = R. So lambda = 1/(R). Oh wait, no, that would be R = 1/lambda, so lambda is 1/R. But that can't be right because R is about 1e7 m^-1, so lambda would be 1e-7 meters, which is 100 nm, but that's not the series limit.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the formula is 1/lambda = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²). Wait, if n1 is 2, then the Balmer series is for n2=2, but that's different.

Wait, no, the Lyman series is n1=1. So the formula is correct. But when n2 approaches infinity, the 1/n2² term becomes zero.

So 1/lambda = R*(1 - 0) → 1/lambda = R → lambda = 1/R.

But wait, R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1, so 1/R is about 9.117e-8 meters, which is 911.7 nm. Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.

But wait, let me check. Oh wait, no, wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the reciprocal. R is 1.097e7 m^-1, so 1/R is approximately 9.118e-8 meters, which is 91.18 nm. That's approximately option A: 91.17 nm.

Wait, but that's the wavelength, but what about the energy? Oh, right, the energy of a photon is E = hc/lambda. But I need to make sure I have the correct values.

Wait, I should double-check the Rydberg constant. R is approximately 1.097373e7 m^-1. So 1/R is 9.1189e-8 m, which is 91.189 nm. So option A is 91.17 nm, which is close. So that's the wavelength.

So the wavelength is 91.18 nm. Now, what about the energy? The energy E is given by E = hc/lambda. But I need to remember the units. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (91.18e-9 m) → Let me compute that.

First, compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 91.18e-9 m = 9.118e-8 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (9.118e-8) → Let me compute that.

1.9878e-25 / 9.118e-8 = (1.9878 / 9.118) * 1e-17.

1.9878 / 9.118 is about 0.218. So 0.218 * 1e-17 = 2.18e-18 J.

Wait, but wait, that's in joules. I should convert that to electron volts for easier understanding, perhaps.

Oh, because 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So divide by 1.602e-19:

2.18e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (2.18 / 1.602) * 10^( -18 +19 ) → 1.361 * 10^1 → approximately 13.61 eV.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Let me compute the exact calculation:

E = (6.62607015e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / 91.189e-9 m

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 3e8 = 1.987821045e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 91.189e-9 = 9.1189e-8 m.

So E = 1.987821045e-25 / 9.1189e-8 = (1.987821045 / 9.1189) * 1e-17.

1.987821045 /9.1189 ≈ 0.218.

So 0.218e-17 = 2.18e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 2.18e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (2.18 /1.602) * 10 = about 1.36 * 10 = 13.6 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 13.6 eV. Hmm, but the question is just about wavelength and energy. So the energy is about 13.6 eV. But the options given are in the range of 80s to 100s of nm, and the energy probably varies.

Wait, the options for the wavelength are:

A: 91.17 nm

B: 123.64 nm

C:121.54

D:84.15

E:88.21

F:102.57

G:105.46

H:110.98

I:75.38

J:97.23

So option A is 91.17 nm, which matches what I got for the wavelength. So that's correct.

But wait, the question is about the photon associated with the series limit. So the wavelength I found is 91.17 nm, which is option A. So the answer would be option A. But wait, another thought: are they asking for the energy in eV or in some other unit? The options don't list eV, so perhaps it's just wavelength.

So, the correct wavelength is 91.17 nm, which is option A. So the answer must be option A.

To calculate the wavelength and energy of a photon associated with the series limit of the Lyman series, we use the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( n_1 = 1 \) (since the Lyman series involves transitions to the ground state) and \( n_2 \to \infty \). For the series limit, the term \( \frac{1}{n_2^2} \) approaches zero, so the formula simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R.
\]

The Rydberg constant \( R \) is approximately \( 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \). Thus, the wavelength is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{1.097 \times 10^7} \approx 9.118 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} = 91.18 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This corresponds to option A: \( 91.17 \, \text{nm} \).

Next, the energy of the photon is calculated using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 91.18 \, \text{nm} = 91.18 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{91.18 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{91.18 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 2.18 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting this energy to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E = \frac{2.18 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 13.6 \, \text{eV}.
\]

However, the question does not ask for the energy in electron volts, so the wavelength is the primary focus.

Thus, the correct answer is:
