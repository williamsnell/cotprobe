Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a particle moving in a circle with a radius of 10 meters. At a certain instant, its speed is 10 m/s and is increasing at 10 m/s². We need to find the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle moves in a circular path, its acceleration has two components: tangential and centripetal. The tangential acceleration is responsible for the change in speed, and the centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle.

Wait, but in this problem, the speed is increasing. So the tangential acceleration is positive. The centripetal acceleration is always perpendicular to the velocity, right? Because it's pointing towards the center of the circle, and the velocity is tangential.

Wait, no. Wait, the direction of velocity is tangent, and centripetal acceleration is perpendicular to that. So the angle between the velocity vector and the centripetal acceleration is 90 degrees. But the question is about the angle between the velocity and the total acceleration vector, which is a combination of tangential and centripetal.

Let me think. The total acceleration vector (a) is the vector sum of the tangential acceleration (a_t) and the centripetal acceleration (a_c). So, a = a_t + a_c.

The velocity vector (v) is along the tangent, and a_c is perpendicular to it. So the angle between v and a_c is 90 degrees. But the angle between v and a (the sum of a_t and a_c) is something else.

Let me try to visualize this. Imagine the velocity vector as a tangential vector. The centripetal acceleration is pointing towards the center, which is at 90 degrees from the velocity vector. The tangential acceleration is in the direction of the velocity (since it's increasing speed, so the direction of acceleration is the same as the velocity, since a_t is the time derivative of velocity).

Wait, because the speed is increasing, the tangential acceleration a_t is positive in the direction of the velocity. So the a vector is the sum of a_t (same direction as v) and a_c (perpendicular to v).

So, to find the angle between v and a, we can model this as a right triangle where one side is a_t, the other is a_c, and the hypotenuse is a.

So the angle θ between v and a is the angle between the hypotenuse and the side a_t. Using trigonometry, tanθ = (a_c) / (a_t).

Wait, but wait, no. Because a is the vector sum, so the angle between v and a would be the angle of the vector a with respect to v. Alternatively, since a is a vector in the plane, the angle would be determined by the components.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitude of a and then find the components.

Wait, the speed is v = 10 m/s, and the tangential acceleration a_t is 10 m/s². So the magnitude of the tangential acceleration is a_t = dv/dt = 10 m/s².

The centripetal acceleration a_c is given by v^2 / r. So r is 10 m, v is 10 m/s, so a_c = (10)^2 / 10 = 10 m/s². Oh, same as a_t.

So both a_t and a_c are 10 m/s² each.

So the total acceleration a is sqrt( (a_t)^2 + (a_c)^2 ), but no, wait, because a is a vector sum. Wait, no, a is the vector sum of a_t and a_c. So the magnitude of a is sqrt( (a_t)^2 + (a_c)^2 ) = sqrt(10² + 10²) = sqrt(200) = 10√2 m/s².

But wait, the question isn't about the magnitude, it's about the angle between v and a.

So the angle θ between v and a can be found using the dot product formula. So cosθ = (v · a) / (|v| |a|).

But v is in the direction of a_t, and a has components a_t (in v's direction) and a_c (perpendicular). So the dot product v · a is equal to (v) * (a_t) * cos(0) + (v) * (a_c) * cos(90°). Because a_t is in the same direction as v, and a_c is perpendicular. So the a_c part contributes zero to the dot product.

So v · a = v * a_t * 1 + 0 = v a_t.

The magnitude of v is |v| = v =10 m/s.

The magnitude of a is sqrt( (a_t)^2 + (a_c)^2 ) = sqrt(10² + 10²) = 10√2 m/s.

So cosθ = (v a_t) / (v a) )= (v a_t) / (v * sqrt(a_t² + a_c²)) )

Wait, wait. Let me plug in the numbers. a_t is 10, a_c is 10.

So cosθ = (v * a_t ) / (v * a )

Which is a_t / a.

Since a is sqrt( (a_t)^2 + (a_c)^2 ), and a_t = a_c in this case.

So a = sqrt(10² +10²) = 10√2.

So a_t / a = 10 / (10√2 )= 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071.

What angle has cosine 0.7071? That's 45 degrees.

Wait, but wait, wait. If a_t is in the same direction as v, and a_c is perpendicular, then the angle between v and a is the angle between the v direction and the vector that has both a_t and a_c.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach is better. Since a is the vector sum of a_t and a_c, and a_t and a_c are perpendicular. So the vector a is at 45 degrees to each of them.

Because in a right-angled triangle, the two legs are equal, so the angle from each is 45 degrees.

Wait, but the angle between v and a is the angle between the hypotenuse (a) and the side a_t (which is the same direction as v). So that angle would be 45 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. Because a is the vector sum. So the direction of a is such that the angle between a and v is 45 degrees. Because the triangle is isosceles.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's 45 degrees. Because if a_t and a_c are equal, the angle between them is 90 degrees, and the vector a would make 45 degrees with each.

So the angle between v and a is 45 degrees.

Looking at the options, option G is 180°, that's too big. Option F is 45°, so that's the right answer.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me think of the vectors. Let's say the velocity is along the x-axis, and the centripetal acceleration is along the negative y-axis (since it's pointing towards the center of the circle, which in this case, if the velocity is along x, the center is at (0,0), so the acceleration is towards (0,0) from (10,0), so direction is negative y-axis.

So the velocity vector v is along x, a_t is along x, a_c is along negative y.

So the total acceleration a is the vector sum of (10,0) and (0,-10), so (10, -10). The angle between v (along x) and a (10, -10) can be found using dot product.

The dot product v · a is 10*10 + 0*(-10) = 100.

The magnitude of v is 10, the magnitude of a is sqrt(10² + (-10)^2) )= sqrt(200) = 10√2.

So cosθ = (100)/(10 * 10√2) ) = (100)/(100√2) )= 1/√2. So θ is 45 degrees.

So the angle is 45°, which is option F.

So the correct answer is F:45°.

The problem involves a particle moving in a circle with a radius of 10 meters. At a certain instant, its speed is 10 m/s, and it is increasing at a rate of 10 m/s². The goal is to determine the angle between the velocity vector and the acceleration vector.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Velocity and Acceleration Components**:
   - The velocity vector is tangential to the circle, pointing in the direction of motion.
   - The acceleration vector consists of two components:
     - **Tangential Acceleration (a_t)**: This is responsible for changes in speed and is given as 10 m/s².
     - **Centripetal Acceleration (a_c)**: This is directed towards the center of the circle and is perpendicular to the velocity vector. Its magnitude is calculated as \( a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} \), where \( v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( r = 10 \, \text{m} \), giving \( a_c = 10 \, \text{m/s}² \).

2. **Total Acceleration**:
   - The total acceleration vector \( \mathbf{a} \) is the vector sum of the tangential and centripetal accelerations:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{a}_t + \mathbf{a}_c
     \]
   - Since \( \mathbf{a}_t \) is along the velocity vector (tangential direction) and \( \mathbf{a}_c \) is perpendicular to it, \( \mathbf{a} \) forms a right triangle with \( \mathbf{a}_t \) and \( \mathbf{a}_c \).

3. **Angle Between Velocity and Total Acceleration**:
   - The angle \( \theta \) between \( \mathbf{v} \) (velocity) and \( \mathbf{a} \) can be determined using the dot product formula:
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{|\mathbf{v}| |\mathbf{a}|}
     \]
   - Substituting the components:
     - \( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a} = v \cdot a_t \cdot \cos(0^\circ) = v \cdot a_t \)
     - \( |\mathbf{v}| = v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \)
     - \( |\mathbf{a}| = \sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = 10\sqrt{2} \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Thus:
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{v \cdot a_t}{v \cdot |\mathbf{a}|} = \frac{a_t}{|\mathbf{a}|} = \frac{10}{10\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
   - The angle \( \theta \) is \( 45^\circ \) because \( \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

### Conclusion:
The angle between the velocity vector and the acceleration vector is \( 45^\circ \). This corresponds to **Option F**.
