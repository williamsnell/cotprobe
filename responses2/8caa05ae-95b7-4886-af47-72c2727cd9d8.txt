Question:

Company X shipped 5 computer chips, 1 of which was defective, and Company Y shipped 4 computer chips, 2 of which were defective. One computer chip is to be chosen uniformly at random from the 9 chips shipped by the companies. If the chosen chip is found to be defective, what is the probability that the chip came from Company Y?

Options:

A: 3 / 9
B: 4 / 9
C: 5 / 9
D: 5 / 6
E: 3 / 4
F: 1 / 3
G: 1 / 2
H: 2 / 9
I: 2 / 3
J: 1 / 9

Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out. 

The problem says that Company X shipped 5 computer chips, with 1 being defective. Company Y shipped 4 chips, and 2 are defective. So, we've got a total of 5 + 4 = 9 chips. 

Now, one chip is chosen uniformly at random from these 9. We're told that the chosen chip is defective, and we need to find the probability that it came from Company Y. Hmm, this sounds like a conditional probability question. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). 

Let me define the events:
- Let D be the event that a defective chip is chosen.
- Let Y be the event that the chip came from Company Y.

We need to find P(Y | D), which is the probability that the chip is from Company Y given that it is defective. 

So, according to the formula, P(Y | D) = P(Y and D) / P(D). 

First, I need to compute P(Y and D), which is the probability that the chip is both from Company Y and defective. 

Looking at Company Y, they have 4 chips, 2 defective. So, the probability of selecting a defective chip from Y is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2. But wait, we're dealing with the overall selection. Since each chip is equally likely to be chosen, the probability is the number of defective chips from Y divided by the total number of chips. So, that's 2/9. Because there are 2 defective in Y out of 9 total. 

Next, P(D) is the probability that a randomly chosen chip is defective. To find this, I need the total number of defective chips across both companies and divide by the total number of chips. 

Company X has 1 defective, and Company Y has 2, so total defective is 1 + 2 = 3. Total chips are 9, so P(D) is 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3. 

Putting it all together, P(Y | D) = (2/9) / (1/3) = (2/9) * (3/1) = 6/9 = 2/3. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, P(Y and D) is 2/9, and P(D) is 3/9. So dividing 2/9 by 3/9 gives 2/3. That seems right. 

Looking at the options, option I is 2/3. So the answer should be I. 

I think that's correct because the calculation shows that given a defective chip, there's a 2/3 chance it came from Y. Because the total defective chips are 3, and Y contributes 2.

The probability that the chosen defective chip came from Company Y is calculated by considering the number of defective chips from each company. Company Y has 2 defective chips out of 9 total, while Company X has 1 defective out of 5. The conditional probability P(Y | D) is (2/9) divided by (3/9), which simplifies to 2/3.
