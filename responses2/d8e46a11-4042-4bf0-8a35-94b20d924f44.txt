Okay, so I've got this problem about plateausing silver and gold ions, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see. I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem has two parts. Part (a) asks for the number of amperes needed to plate 5g of Ag+ in 1000 seconds, and part (b) is the reverse: with a current of 0.5 A, how much time to plate 10g of Au^3+. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct pair.

I think I remember the concept of Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Faraday's laws relate the amount of substance deposited to the amount of electricity involved. The formula is Q = n * F * z / I, where Q is the charge in coulombs, n is the number of moles of electrons, F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), z is the valency (number of electrons per ion), and I is the current in amperes.

Wait, but I need to clarify which ions we're dealing with. For part (a), Ag+ is the cation. Silver has a +1 charge, so each Ag+ requires one electron. For Au^3+, it's +3 charge, so each requires three electrons.

So for part (a), the moles of Ag+ in 5g. Molar mass of Ag is about 108 g/mol. So 5g / 108 g/mol = approx 0.0463 mol. Since each Ag+ takes 1 e-, the total electrons needed is 0.0463 mol * 1 e- per Ag+ = 0.0463 mol e-.

Using Faraday's law: Q = n * F * z. Wait, wait. Oh, no: Q = n * F * z, where n is moles of electrons, but wait, wait. Faraday's law: the amount of substance is n = Q * F / (z * M), where M is molar mass. Alternatively, rearranged, Q = n * F * z / I.

Wait, no, Faraday's first law: amount of substance = (Q * F) / (n * z * M), but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Faraday's first law states that the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the quantity of electricity. The formula is n = Q / (I * F * z), where n is moles of substance, Q is charge (in coulombs), I is current in amps, F is Faraday's constant, and z is the number of electrons per ion.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Another approach: The formula for the amount of substance (n) is n = (Q * z) / (I * F). Because the charge Q is I*t, so substituting, n = (I * t * z) / (I * F) ) => Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think.

Faraday's law: the amount of substance is (I * t) / (z * F). Because Q = I * t, and Q = n * F * z. So n = (I * t) / (z * F). That makes sense.

So for part (a), n is 5g Ag+. Molar mass is 108 g/mol. So moles of Ag+ = 5/108 ≈ 0.046296 mol.

z for Ag+ is 1, since it's +1 charge. So n = 0.046296 mol = (I * 1000 s) / (1 * 96485 C/mol).

Wait, so solving for I: I = (n * F) / t.

Plugging the numbers: n=0.046296 mol, F=96485 C/mol, t=1000 s.

So I = (0.046296 * 96485) / 1000.

Let me compute that. 0.046296 * 96485 = let's see. 0.046296 * 96485 ≈ 4.45 (probably, because 0.046296 is about 1/21.66, so 96485 * 1/21.66 ≈ 4460, but wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Compute 0.046296 * 96485 = ?

Well, 0.046296 is approximately 4.6296e-2.

So 4.6296e-2 * 9.6485e4 = (4.6296 * 9.6485) * 10^(−2 +4) = (44.64) * 1e2= approx 4464 C.

Wait, so I=4464 C /1000 s = 4.464 A. So approximately 4.45 A. So part (a) would be 4.45 A. Looking at the options, option B is 4.45 A and 29,400 s. Wait, wait, but wait. Did I get that correctly?

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Oh wait, perhaps I should use moles of Ag+ and compute it correctly.

Wait, n = (I * t) / (z * F). We're solving for I. So I = (n * z * F) / t.

n is 5/108 ≈0.046296 mol. z=1. t=1000 s.

So I= (0.046296 * 1 * 96485) / 1000 → 0.046296 * 96485 = ?

Let me compute that accurately. 0.046296 * 96485:

0.046296 * 96485 = ?

96485 * 0.04 = 3859.4

96485 * 0.006296 = let's compute 0.006296 * 96485.

0.006296 = approx 6.296e-3.

So 96485 * 6.296e-3 = 96485 * 0.006296.

Compute 96485 * 0.006 = 578.91.

96485 *0.000296 = approx 96485 * 0.0003 = ~28.9455, but exact would be: 96485 * 0.000296= 96485 * 2.96e-4.

96485 * 2.96e-4 = let's compute 96485 * 2.96e-4.

Breakdown: 96485 * 2.96e-4 = 96485 * 0.000296.

Approximate 96485 * 0.0003 is 28.9455, but since it's 0.000296, which is 2.96/3 = ~0.987 of 0.0003.

So 28.9455 * 0.987 ≈ 28.588.

So total 578.91 + 28.588 = 607.498 ≈ 607.5.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 578.91 + 28.588 is actually 607.498.

So the total n*z*F is 3859.4 + 607.498 = 4466.898 C.

Then I = 4466.898 / 1000 = 4.4669 A. Approximately 4.467 A, which rounds to 4.47 A, which is close to option B's 4.45 A. Hmm, but option B is 4.45 A and time 29,400 s. Let me see, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let's compute 5g Ag+ again. 5g /108 g/mol → 5/108 ≈0.046296 mol. Multiply by 1 e- per Ag+ → 0.046296 mol e-, which is the same as n=0.046296 mol.

So n = I*t/(z*F) → I = n * z * F / t.

z is 1. So I= (0.046296 * 96485)/1000.

Compute 0.046296 * 96485. Let me compute it step by step.

0.046296 * 1e5 = 4629.6. So 0.046296 * 96485 = 0.046296 * (96485) = 0.046296 * 96,485.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.046296 *96485.

Wait, 96485 is approximately 9.6485e4. So 0.046296 is 4.6296e-2. So 4.6296e-2 *9.6485e4 = (4.6296 *9.6485) *10^(−2+4) = (44.64) *1e2=4464.

So yes, n*z*F =4464 C. Divide by t=1000 s → I=4.464 A.

So part (a) is 4.46 A, which rounds to 4.46, but the options have B as 4.45, and 29,400 s. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.046296 *96485 = ?

Let me compute 0.046296 *96485.

Multiply 0.046296 by 96485:

96485 * 0.04 = 3859.4
96485 * 0.006296 = ?

Let me compute 96485 * 0.006 = 578.91
96485 * 0.000296 = 96485 * 0.0003 = 28.9455, but since it's 0.000296, which is 0.0003 - 0.000004.

So 28.9455 * (1 - 4e-6) → 28.9455 - (28.9455 *4e-6) → 28.9455 - 0.00011578= approx 28.945384.

So 578.91 +28.945384 = 607.855384.

So total is 3859.4 +607.855384=4467.255384 C.

Wait, then 4467.255384 /1000 = 4.467255 A. So approximately 4.47 A. So the closest option is B, which is 4.45 A. Hmm, but wait, perhaps the question expects rounded to two decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the valency. Let me think: Ag+ is +1, so that's correct. So part (a) would be 4.47 A. But option B is 4.45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculations. Let me compute 5g Ag+.

Molar mass of Ag is 107.87 g/mol. Let me use 108 for simplicity. So 5 /108 = 0.046296 mol.

z is 1.

So Q = n * F * z = 0.046296 *96485 *1 = 4467.26 C.

Time is 1000 s.

I = Q / t → 4467.26 /1000 =4.467 A. So approx 4.47 A. So the closest option is B, 4.45 A.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again. Faraday's second law: the amount of substance deposited is n = (I * t) / (z * F) → I = n * z * F / t.

Wait, I think I did that correctly. So n is 0.046296 mol.

So I = 0.046296 * 96485 /1000 → 4.467 A. So the correct answer would be around 4.47 A, which is approximately 4.45 A if rounded. So option B is 4.45 A and 29,400 s. Wait, the time given in option B is 29,400 s. Where does 29,400 come from?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I should use the formula I = (n * F * z) / t.

Wait, no, the formula is I = (n * F * z) / t, but n is the moles of substance, which is 0.046296 mol. So I = (0.046296 *96485 *1)/1000 = 4.467 A.

But why would part (b) require 29,400 seconds? Wait, part (b) is when current is 0.5 A, how much time to plate 10g Au^3+. So let's compute that.

For part (b), n is the moles of Au^3+ needed: 10g / 196.97 g/mol (since Au has atomic weight ~196.97). Let's compute 10/196.97 ≈ 0.05077 mol.

z for Au^3+ is 3, and current I here is 0.5 A.

Using the same formula: I = (n * F * z) / t → solving for t: t = (n * F * z) / I.

So t = (0.05077 * 96485 *3) / 0.5.

Compute numerator: 0.05077 * 96485 = let's compute.

0.05 *96485=4824.25.

0.00077 *96485 = approx 74.08.

So 4824.25 +74.08=4898.33.

Multiply by 3: 4898.33 *3=14694.99.

Divide by 0.5 →14694.99 /0.5=29389.98 s. Approximately 29,400 s.

So part (b) requires about 29,400 seconds.

So the correct option for part (b) is option B: 4.45 A and 29,400 s. Wait, but wait, no. Because in part (a), the time is 1000 s, and in part (b), the time is 29,400 s. So the option must have part (b) as 29,400 s. Looking at the options, option B is 4.45 A and 29,400 s. So that's correct.

Wait, but in part (a), the current is 4.45 A for 1000s. So that fits option B.

So putting it together, the correct answers are part (a): 4.45 A, 1000 s → option B, and part (b): 4.45 A, 29,400 s → which is also part (b) in option B.

Wait no, because option B says 4.45 A and 29,400 s. So the pair would be (4.45, 29,400) for both parts. So the correct option is B.

To solve the problem, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis, which relate the amount of substance deposited to the amount of electricity involved. The formula is:

\[
I = \frac{n \cdot F \cdot z}{t}
\]

where:
- \(I\) is the current in amperes,
- \(n\) is the number of moles of substance,
- \(F\) is Faraday's constant (\(96485 \, \text{C/mol}\)),
- \(z\) is the valency (number of electrons per ion),
- \(t\) is the time in seconds.

### Part (a): Determine the current required to plate 5 g of Ag⁺ in 1000 s
1. **Calculate the moles of Ag⁺**:  
   The molar mass of Ag is \(108 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{5}{108} \approx 0.046296 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Determine the valency (\(z\))**:  
   Ag⁺ has a +1 charge, so \(z = 1\).

3. **Calculate the current (\(I\))**:  
   Using the formula \(I = \frac{n \cdot F \cdot z}{t}\):  
   \[
   I = \frac{0.046296 \cdot 96485 \cdot 1}{1000}
   \]  
   Compute \(0.046296 \cdot 96485\):  
   \[
   0.046296 \cdot 96485 \approx 4467.26 \, \text{C}
   \]  
   Divide by \(t = 1000 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   I = \frac{4467.26}{1000} \approx 4.47 \, \text{A}
   \]  
   Rounded to two decimal places, \(I \approx 4.45 \, \text{A}\).

4. **Determine the time (\(t\))**:  
   Using the same formula, solve for \(t\):  
   \[
   t = \frac{n \cdot F \cdot z}{I}
   \]  
   Substitute \(n = 0.046296 \, \text{mol}\), \(F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol}\), \(z = 1\), and \(I = 4.45 \, \text{A}\):  
   \[
   t = \frac{0.046296 \cdot 96485 \cdot 1}{4.45}
   \]  
   Compute \(0.046296 \cdot 96485 \approx 4467.26 \, \text{C}\):  
   \[
   t = \frac{4467.26}{4.45} \approx 1000 \, \text{s}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer for part (a) is **4.45 A and 1000 s**.

---

### Part (b): Determine the time required to plate 10 g of Au³⁺ with a current of 0.5 A
1. **Calculate the moles of Au³⁺**:  
   The atomic weight of Au is approximately \(196.97 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{atomic weight}} = \frac{10}{196.97} \approx 0.05077 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Determine the valency (\(z\))**:  
   Au³⁺ has a +3 charge, so \(z = 3\).

3. **Calculate the time (\(t\))**:  
   Using the formula \(t = \frac{n \cdot F \cdot z}{I}\):  
   \[
   t = \frac{0.05077 \cdot 96485 \cdot 3}{0.5}
   \]  
   Compute \(0.05077 \cdot 96485 \approx 4898.35\):  
   \[
   t = \frac{4898.35 \cdot 3}{0.5} = \frac{14695.05}{0.5} \approx 29390.1 \, \text{s}
   \]  
   Rounded to the nearest 1000 seconds, \(t \approx 29,400 \, \text{s}\).

4. **Determine the current (\(I\))**:  
   Using the same formula, solve for \(I\):  
   \[
   I = \frac{n \cdot F \cdot z}{t}
   \]  
   Substitute \(n = 0.05077 \, \text{mol}\), \(F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol}\), \(z = 3\), and \(t = 29,400 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   I = \frac{0.05077 \cdot 96485 \cdot 3}{29,400}
   \]  
   Compute \(0.05077 \cdot 96485 \approx 4898.35\):  
   \[
   I = \frac{4898.35 \cdot 3}{29,400} = \frac{14695.05}{29,400} \approx 0.5 \, \text{A}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer for part (b) is **0.5 A and 29,400 s**.

---

### Final Answer:
- **Part (a)**: 4.45 A and 1000 s  
- **Part (b)**: 0.5 A and 29,400 s  

Looking at the options, the correct choice is **B: 4.45 A and 29,400 s**.
