Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about sound resonating in a pipe. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question is about a pipe that's open at both ends. I remember that open pipes have a certain resonance frequency based on their length and the speed of sound. 

The problem states that at 20°C, the pipe resonates at 440 Hz. Then it asks what the frequency would be on a day when the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20°C. So the key here is to find how the speed of sound affects the resonant frequency. 

Wait, wait. I think the formula for the resonant frequency in an open pipe is f = (n v) / (2L), where n is the harmonic number (like 1, 2, 3, etc.). But since the pipe is open, it supports all harmonics, so the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency.

So the fundamental frequency is f = v / (2L). At 20°C, f is 440 Hz. Now, on the colder day, the speed of sound v is 3% less than at 20°C. Let me calculate what that is. 

First, what's the speed of sound normally at 20°C? Oh wait, I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can relate the two. Let me denote v0 as the speed at 20°C, and v as v0 * 0.97 since 3% less is 97% of the original speed. 

So the new frequency f' will be v / (2L). But wait, the length L of the pipe probably doesn't change because the pipe is the same. So f' = (v0 * 0.97) / (2L) = 0.97 * (v0 / (2L)). But v0 / (2L) is the original frequency, which is 440 Hz. So f' = 440 Hz * 0.97. 

Let me calculate that. 440 * 0.97. Hmm, 440 * 0.97 = (440 * 1) - (440 * 0.03) = 440 - 13.2 = 426.8 Hz. But the options are whole numbers, so I guess I should pick the closest option, which would be 427 Hz. Looking at the options, option A is 427 Hz. 

Wait another thing, does the pipe's length change? The problem says it's the same pipe, so the length L should be the same. So the frequency ratio is indeed 0.97 times the original. So the answer should be 427 Hz. So the correct option is A.

To determine the resonant frequency of the pipe on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20°C, we start by noting the relationship between the frequency, the speed of sound, and the length of the pipe. For an open pipe, the fundamental frequency is given by:

\[
f = \frac{v}{2L}
\]

where \( v \) is the speed of sound and \( L \) is the length of the pipe. At 20°C, the pipe resonates at 440 Hz, so:

\[
f_{\text{original}} = \frac{v_0}{2L} = 440 \, \text{Hz}
\]

On the colder day, the speed of sound is reduced by 3%, so the new speed is:

\[
v = v_0 \times 0.97
\]

The new resonant frequency is then:

\[
f_{\text{new}} = \frac{v}{2L} = 0.97 \times \frac{v_0}{2L} = 0.97 \times f_{\text{original}}
\]

Substituting \( f_{\text{original}} = 440 \, \text{Hz} \):

\[
f_{\text{new}} = 440 \times 0.97 = 426.8 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the resonant frequency on the cold day is approximately 427 Hz. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A: 427 Hz**
