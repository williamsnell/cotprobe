Question:

 In response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not exercise higher mental capacities, Lee and George argue that

Options:

A: it doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.
B: mental capacities should not be a factor in determining personhood.
C: the ability to exercise higher mental capacities could be considered a potential, not an actuality.
D: to have killed a human embryos that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.
E: embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.
F: higher mental capacities are not the only defining characteristics of a person.
G: they dispute the notion that higher mental capacities are a requirement for personhood.
H: the argument is irrelevant as they believe life begins at conception.
I: embryos are potential persons and therefore should have the same rights.
J: the argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.

Okay, so I've got this question about whether embryos can be considered persons. The question is about a legal argument, I think. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that Lee and George argue against the idea that embryos are not persons because they don't exercise higher mental capacities. So, the main point is that the argument is against the notion that the embryo's mental abilities are a characteristic of being a person.

I remember from my studies that in law, personhood is often discussed in terms of the idea of biological determinism. So, is the embryo's ability to develop into a person a real characteristic, or is it just a result of the parents' actions?

Option A says it doesn't make sense to say a person exercises higher mental capacities. That makes sense because in many legal systems, personhood is based on biological determinism. So, if the embryo has some mental capabilities, they're still considered persons because their mental abilities are a result of the parents' actions, not their own.

Option B suggests mental capacities aren't a factor in personhood. That's similar to A, but it's more about the definition. It supports the idea that personhood is determined by biological processes, not psychological ones.

Option C claims the ability is a potential, not actuality. That ties into the idea that it's not something the embryo is capable of at the time of birth, which would mean it's not a person because it hasn't yet developed those abilities. So this is about the concept that the embryo's potential isn't realized yet.

Option D talks about killing embryos to be the same as killing the person. That's a bit more about the physical consequences of personhood. It's a bit of a stretch, but it's trying to say that if you can't kill the embryo because it's not a person, then you can't do the same for the person. But I'm not sure if that's the argument here. The question is about personhood, not about actions and consequences.

Option E says embryos do exercise higher mental capacities. But that's the opposite of B and C. If the embryo does have higher mental abilities, it's not a person because personhood is supposed to be determined by biological processes. So E is the opposite of what Lee and George are arguing.

Option F says higher mental capacities aren't the only defining characteristics. So personhood isn't solely about having mental abilities. That would support the idea that personhood is determined by the biological process, not psychological ones.

Option G is Lee and George's direct argument. They're saying that the idea that the embryo doesn't exercise higher mental capacities is wrong, but the question is about what they argue. The options are the possible conclusions they might reach.

Option H is about their belief that life begins at conception. That's a different point. It's about the biological process of birth, not personhood. If life begins at an early stage, then perhaps the embryo can develop, but the question is about personhood.

Option I argues that embryos are potential persons. So they think the embryo can develop into a person, but that's more about the biological possibility rather than personhood.

Option J is about the validity of their argument, suggesting it's sound but falls due to a logical fallacy. So, is their argument logically flawed? If the argument relies on some hidden assumption, that would mean J is correct.

Back to the question, the options are about what Lee and George argue. The question is about what their argument is. The options are given, so the question is about the reasoning behind their claim.

The argument is that the idea that embryos don't exercise higher mental capacities is wrong. So Lee and George are supporting the idea that the embryo does have higher mental capacities and thus is a person.

Looking at the options, the correct reasoning would be that they argue that it doesn't make sense to say a person doesn't exercise higher mental capacities. So option A says it doesn't make sense because personhood is determined by biological determinism, and the embryo's abilities are a result of the parents' actions, not their own.

Alternatively, option B says mental capacities aren't a factor, supporting the same idea. Option C is about the potential aspect, supporting that the embryo doesn't have the necessary qualities to be a person yet.

Wait, the question is about what they argue. So the question is asking what they argue, not what they're arguing against. The argument is that the idea that embryo doesn't have higher mental abilities is wrong.

So, the options are about what their argument is. The options are A through J.

Option A: it doesn't make sense to say a person exercises higher mental capacities. That's about the nature of personhood.

Option B: mental capacities should not be a factor in determining personhood. Also about the nature of personhood.

Option C: the ability to exercise higher mental capacities could be considered a potential, not an actuality. That's about the potential development.

So, Lee and George's argument would come down to one of these. The question is about their argument, which is that the idea that the embryo doesn't exercise higher mental capacities is incorrect.

So, the correct reasoning would be that it doesn't make sense to say that a person doesn't have higher mental capacities. So option A.

Wait, another angle: in some legal systems, personhood is determined by biological determinism. So, if the embryo has the mental abilities, they're still persons because it's a result of the parents' actions, not the embryo's own abilities.

But the options are about what they argue. So the question is, what do they argue? They argue that the idea that the embryo doesn't have higher mental capacities is wrong.

So, what is their argument? It would be that it makes sense for a person to have higher mental capacities. So the argument would be about the nature of being a person, not about the capabilities of the embryo.

Option A says it doesn't make sense. That refers to the idea that personhood is determined by the embryo's mental abilities. But the question is about what they are arguing, not the opposite.

Alternatively, the argument could be that it makes no sense to say that a person doesn't have higher mental capacities, which would be option A.

Wait, the question is: " Lee and George argue that..." So the argument is that the idea that higher mental capacities are not a factor in personhood is incorrect.

So, Lee and George would argue that personhood is determined by the biological factors, not by the mental capacities. So their argument would be that it doesn't make sense to say that a person doesn't have higher mental capacities.

So option A would be the correct answer, as it's the direct argument they're making.

The question revolves around Lee and George's argument regarding whether embryos are persons based on their potential to exercise higher mental capacities. The key point is that personhood is determined by biological determinism, and the idea that a person doesn't have higher mental capacities is incorrect. 

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

- **A**: "It doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities." This directly reflects the argument that personhood is determined by biological processes, not psychological ones. This aligns with the idea that the embryo's mental abilities are a result of the parents' actions, not their own.

- **B**: "Mental capacities should not be a factor in determining personhood." This supports the same reasoning as A, emphasizing that personhood is determined by biological factors.

- **C**: "The ability to exercise higher mental capacities could be considered a potential, not an actuality." This highlights the potential development aspect, which is relevant but not the primary argument in this context.

Options D, E, F, G, H, and I relate to different aspects of personhood, such as legal definitions, biological determinism, or the nature of personhood itself, which are less relevant to the specific argument about higher mental capacities.

The question asks what Lee and George argue, which is that the idea of a person not having higher mental capacities is incorrect. This directly points to **A** as their argument.
