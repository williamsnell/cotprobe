Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Mr. Williams rented a truck from Armco, and we need to calculate the total cost he paid. The costs are per day, per mile, per gallon, and additional hours. 

First, let's break down all the information given:

- The rental cost is $32 per day.
- $0.22 per mile driven.
- $0.55 per gallon of gasoline used.
- Additional hours charged at $2.75 per hour.

Mr. Williams rented the truck for 2 days and 3 hours. He drove it 320 miles and used 30 gallons of gas.

I think the best approach is to calculate each component separately and then add them up. Let's list each part:

1. Daily cost: 2 days × $32/day.
2. Mileage cost: 320 miles × $0.22/mile.
3. Gasoline cost: 30 gallons × $0.55/gallon.
4. Additional hours: 3 hours × $2.75/hour.

Wait, I also remember that the additional hours are per day, so the 3 hours are extra beyond the 2 days. So, I don't need to multiply by 2 for the hours. That makes sense.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Daily cost: 2 days × $32/day.
So, 2 × 32 = $64.

Mileage cost: 320 miles × $0.22/mile.
0.22 multiplied by 320. Let me calculate that. 0.22 × 300 is 66, and 0.22 × 20 is 4.4, so 66 + 4.4 = $70.40.

Gasoline cost: 30 gallons × $0.55/gallon. 0.55 × 30. Let me see, 0.55 × 30 is 16.5 dollars.

Additional hours: 3 hours × $2.75 per hour. 3×2.75 is 8.25.

Now, adding all these together: 64 (daily) + 70.40 (miles) + 16.5 (gas) + 8.25 (hours).

Let me add them step by step.

64 + 70.40 = 134.40.

134.40 + 16.5 = 150.90.

150.90 + 8.25 = 159.15.

Wait, that gives me $159.15. Looking at the options, option J is $159.15.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Daily cost: 2 days × $32 = 64, correct.

Mileage: 320 × 0.22. Let me compute 0.22 × 320. 320 is 300+20. 0.22×300=66, 0.22×20=4.4 → 66+4.4=70.4, correct.

Gasoline: 30 × 0.55. 0.55 ×30 is 16.5, correct.

Additional hours: 3 × 2.75. 2.75 ×3 is 8.25, correct.

Adding them: 64 +70.40 =134.4; 134.40 +16.5=150.90; 150.90 +8.25=159.15. So total is $159.15.

Looking at the options, J is $159.15.

Wait, but looking again at the options, J is $159.15.

So the correct answer should be J.

The total cost is calculated as follows:

1. Daily cost: 2 days × $32/day = $64.
2. Mileage cost: 320 miles × $0.22/mile = $70.40.
3. Gasoline cost: 30 gallons × $0.55/gallon = $16.50.
4. Additional hours: 3 hours × $2.75/hour = $8.25.

Adding these together: $64 + $70.40 + $16.50 + $8.25 = $159.15.

The correct answer is J: $159.15.
