Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out. So, both Mr. and Mrs. Brown have an autosomal recessive condition that makes them anemic. Hmm, autosomal means it's on a non-sex chromosome, right? So that's either a mom or dad's chromosome. 

The question says that Mr. Brown has a substitution in the beta-chain of his hemoglobin. Mrs. Brown has a similar defect in her alpha-chain. Oh wait, autosomal recessive means that you have to have two copies of the defective gene to show the trait. So if Mr. Brown has one substitution, he must have another one somewhere else, probably in his gamete. Similarly, Mrs. Brown has one in her alpha-chain, so she also has another substitution elsewhere.

Now, the children—Betsy and Boopoy—are not anemic. Wait, so neither of them is showing the condition. So what's going on here?

If both parents are carriers, meaning they each have one defective allele, then the chance they pass it on to their children depends on how many are carriers. Each parent would contribute one allele. If each parent is heterozygous (carries two normal alleles), then each child has a 25% chance of getting the defective one from each parent. So the possible genotypes for the child are:

- Normal/Normal (25%)
- Normal/Defective (25%)
- Defective/Normal (25%)
- Defective/Defective (25%)

Since the condition is recessive, the child only expresses the condition if they have two defective alleles. So unless the child has the defective allele twice, they won't be anemic. But in this case, the children are not anemic. So that suggests that the child doesn't have both alleles defective. Wait, but if the parents are each heterozygous (like Aa), then each child has a 25% chance of being aa (anemic). But the question says neither child is anemic. That would mean that none of the children have aa. So that's confusing because if both parents are carriers, it's possible but not certain. 

Wait, but the options are about possibilities. Let me look at the options again.

Option E says the children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic. Wait, why would they be carriers? A carrier would mean having one defective allele. But if the children aren't showing the condition, they don't have the defective alleles. So perhaps they are not carriers. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not carriers. 

Wait, the question says that both parents have the condition. So if they both have the condition, they must be carriers because they have one substitution. So each parent is heterozygous (Aa), meaning each has one normal and one defective allele. 

If both are carriers, the chance a child has a recessive disorder (aa) is 25%. But the children are not anemic. So that suggests that the chance of aa is zero. So it's impossible for the child to get aa. How? Because if both parents are carriers, there's a 25% chance the child is aa. But if the children aren't showing the condition, that would mean that aa never happened. So perhaps none of the children inherited the aa genotype. 

But wait, what if the parents are not carriers? That would mean they're homozygous recessive, which would make them anemic. But the question says they have the condition. So that's not the case. So the parents must be carriers, meaning they each have one defective allele. So each child has a 25% chance of getting aa. But in the question, the children are not anemic. So perhaps the children never got the aa genotype. But that seems unlikely because it's possible.

Wait, maybe neither parent is a carrier. But the question states that both have the condition. So that's not possible. So the other options suggest different possibilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Only one parent can pass the disorder to the children. No, because both parents are carriers, so each can pass it on.

Option B: Both parents will definitely pass the disorder to their children. That would be the case only if both are homozygous, which they aren't. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Both children inherited a different form of anemia that's not detectable at their current age. But I don't see how that's possible. The question says the children are not anemic, but if they inherited a different form, that wouldn't explain it unless the allele is not detectable. But the condition is autosomal recessive, so it's the same type. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Both parents have a homozygous trait but may or may not pass the disorder to their children. Wait, if the parents are both homozygous, then they are not carriers. But the question states that both have the condition, so they must be carriers. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic. Wait, if the children are not carriers, that would mean they don't have the disorder. But if a child is not a carrier, that's possible. For example, if a child doesn't have the aa genotype. But according to Mendelian genetics, the probability is 25% for aa. So unless the parents are homozygous, but that's not the case. So E is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The parents are both carriers (heterozygous), so each has a 25% chance to pass each allele. So the chance the child gets aa is 25%. But the children are not anemic. So none of the children have aa. How can that happen? Because it's possible in some cases, but not impossible. 

Wait, but the question says "neither Betsy nor Boopoy, their children, are anemic." So if the children are not carriers, which would mean they don't have the condition. But if the parents are carriers, then the children have a 25% chance to be aa. So the question says that the children are not anemic, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are not carriers. Because they could have a different form not detectable yet.

Wait, but the question's options are about possible explanations for why the children aren't anemic. Let's re-examine the options.

Option A: Only one parent can pass the disorder to the children. No, both can.

Option B: Both parents definitely pass the disorder to their children. No, because they're carriers, each can pass it on.

Option C: Both children inherited a different form of anemia not detectable. I don't think so because the condition is autosomal recessive, same type.

Option D: Both parents are homozygous but may or may not pass. Wait, if both parents are homozygous, then they don't pass the disorder. But the question says both have the condition, so they can't be homozygous.

Option E: The children cannot be carriers. Because carriers mean they have one defective allele. If the children are not anemic, they might not have the disorder. But that doesn't mean they are not carriers. So E is not correct.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Since both parents are carriers, each has a 25% chance of passing the condition to their child. So the chance that a child doesn't have the condition (is not anemic) is 75%. But the question says that the children are not anemic. So this must mean that all children have aa. Wait, but that's only possible if both parents are homozygous. Because if both parents are carriers (Aa), then the chance a child is aa is 25%. So the chance all children have aa is 25%, which is possible but not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not carriers. But the question says both have the condition. So they have to be carriers. So, given that, the only explanation is that the children are not carriers, but that's not correct because carriers can pass the disorder. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question asks, "Why are the children not anemic?" So if both parents are carriers, the children have a 25% chance of being aa. But in this case, the children are not anemic, meaning none of them are aa. So how can that happen?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the parents are not both carriers. But the question says both have the condition. So they must be carriers. So the only possible explanation is that the children are not carriers. But why not? Because carriers have one defective allele. If the children are not carriers, that would mean they have no defective alleles. But the question says the children are not anemic. So they could be either normal or have aa. 

Wait, but the question says none of them are anemic. So the children must not have aa. So in this case, the only way that can happen is if none of the children inherited the two defective alleles. But that's not possible—each child has a 25% chance. But the question says none are anemic, meaning they don't have aa. So perhaps the parents are not carriers, but that's against the question statement.

Wait, perhaps the parents are both normal. No, because they have the condition. So that can't be. So the only other option is that the children are not carriers. But why would that be the case? Because if the parents are carriers, the children have a 25% chance to be aa. But the question says that none of the children have aa. So that suggests that the children are not carriers, which would mean that they don't have the condition. But if the parents are carriers, that's impossible. So perhaps the only correct option is E.

Wait, option E says the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. But that's incorrect, because carriers don't have the condition. So if the children are not anemic, they are either normal or have aa. So the fact that they aren't anemic doesn't mean they are carriers. 

Wait, but the children cannot be carriers and not have the condition. So perhaps the option is that the children are not carriers (so they can't pass the condition), but they are not anemic because they are normal. 

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic. But carriers don't have the condition. So this is wrong.

Option D: Both parents are homozygous (so not carriers) but may or may not pass the disorder to their children. Wait, but the question says both have the condition, so they can't be homozygous. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another approach. If the parents are both carriers, each has a 25% chance of passing each allele. So the chance a child doesn't inherit any defective allele is 25%. But the question says that the children are not anemic. So that's possible but not certain. But the options are about possible explanations.

The question is, why are the children not anemic? Since the parents have the condition, they must be carriers. So the children have a 25% chance of being aa. But the children are not anemic, which implies they don't have aa. But why would they not have aa? Unless the parents are not carriers. But the question says both have the condition, so they must be carriers. So this situation is impossible unless they don't pass the condition to the children, but that's not possible if they are carriers.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because if the children are not carriers, meaning they don't have the condition, but the parents are carriers. But that would mean the children don't have the condition, but the question says they are not anemic. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the condition is autosomal recessive. So, the children are not anemic (so not affected) but are not carriers. But carriers have one defective allele. So, for the children to not be carriers, their alleles must be normal. But that doesn't explain why the children aren't anemic. Unless the parents are not carriers, which isn't the case.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that since both parents are carriers, the children have a 25% chance. But the only way the children aren't anemic is if none of them have aa. But that's not possible in most cases. So perhaps the only possible explanation is that the children are not carriers. But that's incorrect because carriers have the condition.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question asks why the children are not anemic. So the correct reasoning is that the parents are carriers, each with a 25% chance to pass the disorder. But the children aren't. So that would only happen if the parents don't pass the disorder. But that's impossible because they are carriers.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is E: The children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. But that's not correct because carriers don't have the condition. So that's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is that both parents are carriers, so each has a 25% chance. But the only way the children aren't anemic is if none of them have aa. But that's not possible in most cases. So perhaps the only possible explanation is that the children are not carriers. But that's incorrect because carriers have the condition.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. So option E is incorrect because carriers don't have the condition.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try another approach. Each parent is a carrier (Aa). The chance a child is aa is 25%. So the possible genotypes for the child are:

- AA (25%)
- Aa (25%)
- aa (25%)
- aa (25%)

So the chance of aa is 25%. But the question says the children are not anemic, meaning they don't have aa. So that's possible. But why? Because the parents are carriers. So the children can't be carriers themselves. So they are not carriers, meaning they don't have the condition. But the question says the children are not anemic. So it's possible but not certain. 

The options don't give an explanation for this. So which option is correct?

Looking again at the options:

Option E says the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. That's incorrect, because carriers don't have the condition. So the children are not carriers and are not anemic.

Wait, but the question asks why the children are not anemic. So the correct reasoning is that since both parents are carriers, the children have a 25% chance. But the only way the children aren't anemic is if none of them have aa. But that's not possible in most cases. So perhaps the only possible explanation is that the children are not carriers. But that's incorrect because carriers have the condition.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. So option E is incorrect because carriers don't have the condition.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic.

Wait, why would the children be carriers? Because carriers have the condition. If the children are not anemic, they don't have the condition, so they can't be carriers. So the children are not carriers. But that's the opposite of what option E says. Option E says the children cannot be carriers, but that would imply they don't have the condition. So in that case, the children are not carriers, but they are not anemic. 

Wait, but if the children are not carriers, that means they don't have the condition. So in that case, the children are not anemic because they don't have the condition. So the correct reasoning is that the children can't be carriers, which is option E.

Wait, no. Because carriers don't have the condition. So if the children are carriers, they must have the condition. So the children can't be carriers if they are not anemic. So the correct reasoning is that the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. So option E is correct.

Wait, but the options don't say that. Option E says "The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic."

Wait, that can't be right. Because carriers have the condition. So if a child is a carrier, they have the condition. So the only way a child isn't a carrier is if they don't have the condition. So the children are not carriers and not anemic. So the correct reasoning is that they are not carriers. Hence, option E is correct.

Wait, I'm getting really confused. Let me think again. The question says that the children are not anemic. So the children could be either normal (non-carriers) or carriers. But the options don't directly address that. Only option E says that the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. Which is correct because if they were carriers, they would have the condition. So the fact that they are not anemic implies they are not carriers. So option E is correct.

The question involves two parents, Mr. Brown and Mrs. Brown, who both have an autosomal recessive condition making them anemic. Mr. Brown has a substitution in the \(\beta\)-chain of his hemoglobin, while Mrs. Brown has a similar defect in her \(\alpha\)-chain. Neither of their children, Betsy nor Boopoy, are anemic. The task is to determine the correct explanation for this observation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Genetic Background**: Both parents are carriers of the anemia allele. For a condition to be recessive, a parent must be heterozygous (e.g., \(Aa\)), meaning they have one normal allele and one defective allele. If both parents are carriers, each child has a 25% chance of inheriting two copies of the defective allele (\(aa\)), making them anemic. Conversely, there is a 75% chance a child will inherit only one defective allele (\(Aa\)) and thus not be anemic.

2. **Observation**: The children are not anemic. This means none of the children inherited two defective alleles (\(aa\)). However, the reasoning provided in the options must align with this observation.

3. **Option Evaluation**:
   - **Option E**: "The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic."
     - This is correct. If a child were a carrier (\(Aa\)), they would have the anemia condition. Since the children are not anemic, they cannot be carriers. This explanation aligns with the observation and provides a logical conclusion.

4. **Other Options**:
   - **Option A**: "Only one parent can pass the disorder to the children."
     - Incorrect. Both parents are carriers and can pass the disorder to their children.
   - **Option B**: "Both parents will definitely pass the disorder to their children."
     - Incorrect. Both parents are carriers and can pass the disorder to their children.
   - **Option C**: "Both children inherited a different form of anemia that is not detectable at their current age."
     - Incorrect. The question does not provide evidence that the children inherited a non-detectable form of anemia.
   - **Option D**: "Both parents have a homozygous trait but may or may not pass the disorder to their children."
     - Incorrect. The parents are carriers, not homozygous, and they can pass the disorder to their children.

### Conclusion:
The only correct explanation is that the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. If the children were carriers, they would have inherited the anemia condition. Since they are not anemic, this further confirms that they cannot be carriers.
