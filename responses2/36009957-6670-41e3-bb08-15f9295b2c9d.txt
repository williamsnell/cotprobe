Okay, so I have this problem here: finding the coefficient of x²y⁵ in the expansion of (x + 2y)^7. Hmm, I remember something about the binomial theorem from algebra. Let me try to recall how that works.

The binomial theorem says that (a + b)^n expands into a sum where each term is C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k, right? Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So in this case, a is x, b is 2y, and n is 7. 

Wait, the term we're looking for is x²y⁵. Let me think about the exponents. Since a is x and b is 2y, each term in the expansion would be C(7, k) * x^(7 - k) * (2y)^k. So the exponents of x and y in each term are (7 - k) and k respectively. 

We want x²y⁵, which means (7 - k) should be 2 and k should be 5. Let's check: 7 - k = 2 → k = 5. Yep, that's correct. So the term we're interested in is when k is 5. 

Now, let's compute the coefficient. The coefficient is C(7,5) multiplied by (2)^5. Wait, because (2y)^5 is 2^5 * y^5. So the coefficient is C(7,5) * 2^5.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think C(7,5) is the same as C(7,2) because of the combination formula's symmetry. Let me compute C(7,5). 

C(n, k) is n!/(k!(n -k)!). So for C(7,5): 7!/(5! * (7-5)!) = 7!/(5!2!) = (7×6×5!)/(5!×2×1) )= (7×6)/(2×1) = 42/2 = 21. So C(7,5) is 21.

Then, 2^5 is 32. So the coefficient is 21 * 32. Let's compute that. 20 *32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so 640 +32=672. So the coefficient is 672.

Wait, but looking at the options, one of them is F:672. So that's the answer. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake.

Alternatively, I can compute C(7,5) * (2)^5. Another way is to compute 21 * 32. 21 * 32: 20*32=640, plus 1*32=32 → 672. Yep, same result.

Wait, but let me think again about the term. Because the expansion term is C(7,5) * x^(7-5) * (2y)^5. So x^2 y^5, which is exactly what we need. So the coefficient is 672, which is option F. 

Wait, but another thing: sometimes I get confused with the exponents. Let me make sure: (x + 2y)^7, so each term is C(7,k) * x^(7 -k) * (2y)^k. So when k=5, it's x^2 * (2y)^5. So the coefficient would be C(7,5) * (2)^5, which is 21 * 32 = 672. So yes, F is the correct answer.

To find the coefficient of \(x^2y^5\) in the expansion of \((x + 2y)^7\), we use the binomial theorem. Each term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{7}{k} \cdot x^{7-k} \cdot (2y)^k
\]

We need the term where \(x^2y^5\), which corresponds to \(7 - k = 2\) and \(k = 5\). Thus, the term is:

\[
\binom{7}{5} \cdot x^2 \cdot (2y)^5
\]

Calculating the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{7}{5} = \binom{7}{2} = \frac{7!}{2!5!} = 21
\]

Next, compute \(2^5 = 32\). Therefore, the coefficient is:

\[
21 \cdot 32 = 672
\]

Thus, the coefficient of \(x^2y^5\) is **672**.
