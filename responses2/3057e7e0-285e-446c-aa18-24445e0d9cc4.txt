Okay, so I've got this question here about banking and the reserve ratio. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question says: The reserve ratio is 0.1. If a bank gets $200 in deposits, what's the maximum amount it can lend? The options are A to J, with various amounts.

Hmm. Right, I remember that the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that a bank must hold as reserves and can't lend out. So, if the reserve ratio is 0.1, that's 10%. 

So, for every dollar in deposits, the bank keeps 10 cents as reserves and can lend out 90 cents. Because 100% - 10% = 90%.

Wait, so if the bank gets $200 in deposits, then the reserve it must hold is 10% of 200. Let me calculate that. 10% of 200 is 0.1 * 200 = $20. So the bank has to keep $20 as reserves and can lend out the rest. 

So the maximum it can lend is the total deposits minus the reserves. That would be 200 - 20 = $180. 

Wait, but is that the maximum it can lend? Because that's the amount it can lend if it doesn't need to hold any more reserves. But I think in real banking systems, the reserve ratio is fixed, and the bank can only borrow up to what it can hold as reserves. So if the bank has $200 in deposits and the reserve ratio is 10%, it can't lend more than $180. Because if it wants to lend more, it would need more reserves. 

Let me think again. Reserves are 10% of deposits. So if the bank gets $200, it must keep 10% as reserves. So 0.1 * 200 = $20. Therefore, it can lend out $200 - $20 = $180. 

So the maximum it can lend is $180. Looking at the options, option F is $180. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way to think about it is the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio). So 1/0.1 = 10. So the money multiplier is 10. That means the maximum money supply is 10 times the deposit multiplier. But in this case, the question is about the maximum amount a bank can lend, not the total money in the economy. So that's different. The maximum it can lend is determined by its own reserves and deposits. So no need to go beyond the multiplier for this question.

So, the maximum it can lend is $180. So the correct answer is F.

The reserve ratio is 0.1 (10%). For $200 in deposits, the bank must hold 10% as reserves, which is $20. Thus, the maximum it can lend is $200 - $20 = $180. 

Answer: F
