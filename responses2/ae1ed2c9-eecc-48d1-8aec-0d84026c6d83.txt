Okay, so I have this accounting question about depreciation per mile. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

John's Rent-A-Truck bought a van for $4,500. The truck is expected to last for 100,000 miles, and then trade-in value is $500. I need to find the cost of depreciation per mile.

Hmm, I remember there are methods for calculating depreciation. The question doesn't specify which method, but I think the most common for problems like this is the straight-line method. Straight-line depreciation spreads the cost evenly over the useful life of the asset.

So, the formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value)/Total Useful Life. Let me plug in the numbers. The cost is $4,500, the salvage value is $500, and the useful life is 100,000 miles. 

So the total depreciation expense is $4,500 - $500 = $4,000. Then, divide that by 100,000 miles. That would be $4,000 / 100,000 miles. Let me do the math: 4000 รท 100,000 = 0.04. So the depreciation per mile is 0.04 dollars.

Looking at the options, option J is $0.04 per mile. So the answer should be J.

The cost of depreciation per mile using the straight-line method is calculated as:

1. **Total Depreciable Amount**: Cost - Salvage Value = $4,500 - $500 = $4,000.
2. **Depreciation per Mile**: $4,000 / 100,000 miles = $0.04 per mile.

**Answer:** J: $0.04 per mile

J
