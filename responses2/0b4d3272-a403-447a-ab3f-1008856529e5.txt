Okay, so I have this question about calculating Hamming distances between some binary codewords. The codewords given are 00000, 10101, and 01010. I need to find the minimum Hamming distance among them and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, Hamming distance is the number of positions where the corresponding bits are different between two binary strings of the same length. So, for each pair, I'll compare their bits and count the differences.

Let me list the codewords:

1. 00000
2. 10101
3. 01010

I think I should calculate the Hamming distance between each pair and then find the minimum.

First, let's compare the first pair: 00000 and 10101.

Looking at each position:

1. Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different.
2. Position 2: 0 vs 0 → same.
3. Position 3: 0 vs 1 → different.
4. Position 4: 0 vs 0 → same.
5. Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different.

Wait, that's positions 1, 3, and 5. So that's three differences. So the Hamming distance is 3. So between 00000 and 10101, it's 3.

Next, compare 00000 and 01010.

Let's go through each bit again.

Positions:

1. 0 vs 0 → same.
2. 0 vs 1 → different.
3. 0 vs 0 → same.
4. 0 vs 1 → different.
5. 0 vs 0 → same.

So positions 2 and 4 are different. That's two differences. So the Hamming distance is 2.

Now, comparing 10101 and 01010.

Let's line them up:

10101: 1 0 1 0 1
01010: 0 1 0 1 0

Compare each position:

1. 1 vs 0 → different.
2. 0 vs 1 → different.
3. 1 vs 0 → different.
4. 0 vs 1 → different.
5. 1 vs 0 → different.

Wait, that's five differences. So the Hamming distance between 10101 and 01010 is 5.

So now, the three distances are 3, 2, and 5.

The minimum among 3, 2, 5 is 2, so the answer should be B:2.

The Hamming distances between the codewords are calculated as follows:

1. **00000 vs 10101**:  
   Differences in positions 1, 3, and 5 → distance = 3.

2. **00000 vs 01010**:  
   Differences in positions 2 and 4 → distance = 2.

3. **10101 vs 01010**:  
   Differences in all 5 positions → distance = 5.

The minimum Hamming distance is 2. 

Answer: B:2
