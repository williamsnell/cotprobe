Okay, so I have this logic question in front of me. I'm a bit nervous because I've just started learning about truth tables and logical equivalences. Let me take it step by step.

The question is asking me to construct a complete truth table for two given propositions and then determine their logical relationship—whether they're equivalent, contradictory, consistent, etc. The propositions are:

1. (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N)
2. (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]

And there are multiple-choice options to choose from. The options are A through J, each describing a different relationship between the two propositions.

Hmm, first, I remember that to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent, they must have the same truth values in all possible scenarios. If one is always true when the other is, they are equivalent. Conversely, if one is always false when the other is, they are contradictory. If they don't cover all possibilities without contradictions, and they are not the same, they might be inconsistent or consistent.

So I think I should construct a truth table with all possible truth values for M, N, and O. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

Let me list all the possible truth values for M, N, O. They can each be T (true) or F (false). So the combinations are:

1. M=T, N=T, O=T
2. M=T, N=T, O=F
3. M=T, N=F, O=T
4. M=T, N=F, O=F
5. M=F, N=T, O=T
6. M=F, N=T, O=F
7. M=F, N=F, O=T
8. M=F, N=F, O=F

Now I need to compute the truth values for each proposition for each of these 8 scenarios.

Let's take the first proposition: (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N)

Breaking this down:

First, ~M is the negation of M. So if M is T, ~M is F, and vice versa. Similarly, ~N is the negation of N.

Then, (~M ⊃ ~N) is an implication. Remember, an implication A ⊃ B is only false when A is T and B is F. So when ~M is F, regardless of ~N, the implication is T. Because any implication with the antecedent false is considered true.

So, (~M ⊃ ~N) is equivalent to: if M is T, then ~N must be T for the implication to be T. If M is F, the implication is automatically T.

Now, the other part is (O ≡ N). That's an equivalence, which is true only when O and N have the same truth value.

So for each of the 8 scenarios, I'll compute both (~M ⊃ ~N) and (O ≡ N), then take their disjunction (∨).

Now, moving to the second proposition: (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]

Breaking this down:

First, (~M · N) is the conjunction of ~M and N. So it's true only when both ~M is T and N is T.

The other part inside the brackets is [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]. Let's evaluate each part.

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, (~O ∨ ~N) is OR of ~O and ~N. So it's true unless both O and N are T.

Second, (O ∨ N) is OR of O and N. So it's true unless both are F.

So [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is the conjunction of these two. For this to be true, both conditions must be true. But wait, let's think about this. It's the AND of two terms. The first term (~O ∨ ~N) is true except when both O and N are T. The second term (O ∨ N) is true except when both are F.

So when both ~O ∨ ~N and O ∨ N are true, what does that imply?

Wait, if O ∨ N is true, then either O is T, or N is T, or both. Then, ~O ∨ ~N is equivalent to (O ∧ N) being F. Because if O is T, ~O is F; if N is T, ~N is F; but if both are F, ~O and ~N are T.

So, when O and N have at least one T, then ~O ∨ ~N is always T.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me make a truth table for these two expressions.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider all possible combinations of O and N and see if both (~O ∨ ~N) and (O ∨ N) are true.

Let's make a table for O and N:

Case 1: O=T, N=T.

Then, ~O=F, ~N=F.

So, (~O ∨ ~N) = F ∨ F = F.

(O ∨ N) = T ∨ T = T.

So [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] = F · T = F.

Case 2: O=T, N=F.

~O=F, ~N=T.

So, (~O ∨ ~N) = F ∨ T = T.

(O ∨ N) = T ∨ F = T.

So, (T · T) = T.

Case 3: O=F, N=T.

~O=T, ~N=F.

So, (~O ∨ ~N) = T ∨ F = T.

(O ∨ N) = F ∨ T = T.

So, (T · T) = T.

Case 4: O=F, N=F.

~O=T, ~N=T.

So, (~O ∨ ~N) = T ∨ T = T.

(O ∨ N) = F ∨ F = F.

So, (T · F) = F.

So, in which cases is [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] true?

Only when O and N are not both true, but wait, looking at the cases:

Only in cases 2 and 3, the expression is true. Because in case 2: O=T, N=F; case 3: O=F, N=T.

Wait, but when both O and N are F (case 4), the expression evaluates to F.

So, [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is true only when at least one of O or N is true, but not both. Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, in case 2: O=T, N=F. So O is T, N is F. So O ∨ N is T, and ~O ∨ ~N is F ∨ T = T. So both terms are true.

Similarly, case 3: O=F, N=T. Then, ~O = T, ~N=F, so (~O ∨ ~N) = T, (O ∨ N) = T. Both terms are true.

In case 1: O=T, N=T. Then, ~O=F, ~N=F. So (~O ∨ ~N) is F, and (O ∨ N) is T. So F · T = F.

Case 4: O=F, N=F. Both conditions are F, so F.

So the expression [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is true only when either O is T and N is F, or O is F and N is T. So it's true when exactly one of O or N is true.

If both O and N are true, the expression is false.

Wait, but let me check case 4 again. When O and N are both F, then O ∨ N is F, so [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is (T · F) = F.

So, the expression is true when (O ∧ ~N) is true, or (~O ∧ N) is true.

Wait, that's the cases where either O is T and N is F, or O is F and N is T.

So in those cases, the expression is true.

So, going back to the second proposition: (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)].

So, this is the conjunction of two parts: (~M · N) and [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]. 

For this entire expression to be true, both parts must be true.

So, let's break it down into the two parts:

1. (~M · N): This is true only when M is F and N is T.

2. [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: As discussed, this is true when either O is T and N is F, or O is F and N is T.

So, the overall expression is true only when:

Case 1: (~M · N) is true, and [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is also true.

So, let's find when both are true.

Let's consider when (~M · N) is true. That is, M=F and N=T.

And when [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is true. So, from earlier, that's when (O ∧ ~N) is true, or (~O ∧ N) is true.

Wait, when O is T and N is F, then (O ∧ ~N) is T ∧ T, which is T. And when O is F and N is T, that's ~O ∧ N, which is T ∧ T, so both parts are true.

So, the only time when both parts are true is when M=F, N=T, and either O is T and N is F, or O is F and N is T.

Wait, but N is T in the case where M=F, N=T. So in the first part, if M=F and N=T, then in the second part, we need to see when O is such that [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is true.

But since N=T in this case, the expression becomes [(~O ∨ F) · (O ∨ T)].

Which is equivalent to [(~O) · O], because F ∨ anything is anything, and anything ∨ T is T.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] with N=T becomes ( ~O ∨ F ) · ( O ∨ T ) = ( ~O ) · T = ~O.

So, the second part is ~O.

So, the entire expression is (~M · N) · ( ~O )

So, when M=F, N=T, the expression becomes (F · T) · ( ~O ) → F · ( ~O )

Which is F, regardless of O.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the second part earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's compute the entire expression for each combination.

I think it's getting a bit complicated, but let me try to compute each part for all possible M, N, O.

Let me make a table.

The propositions are:

P = (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N)

Q = (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]

I'll create a table for M, N, O, and compute P and Q for each case.

So, for each of the 8 possible scenarios:

1. M=T, N=T, O=T
2. M=T, N=T, O=F
3. M=T, N=F, O=T
4. M=T, N=F, O=F
5. M=F, N=T, O=T
6. M=F, N=T, O=F
7. M=F, N=F, O=T
8. M=F, N=F, O=F

Let's go through each case.

Case 1: M=T, N=T, O=T.

Compute P:

~M is F, ~N is F. So, (~M ⊃ ~N) is F → F = T.

Then, O ≡ N: T ≡ T = T. So P = T ∨ T = T.

Compute Q:

~M · N: F · T = F.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O is F, ~N is F → (F ∧ F) = F. Then O ∨ N is T ∨ T = T. So F ∧ T = F.

So Q = F · F = F.

So, P=T, Q=F. So P and Q are different.

Case 2: M=T, N=T, O=F.

Compute P:

~M=F, ~N=F. So, ~M ⊃ ~N is F→F = T.

O ≡ N: F ≡ T = F. So P = T ∨ F = T.

Compute Q:

~M · N: F · T = F.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O is T, ~N is F. So (T ∧ F) = F. O ∨ N is F ∨ T = T. So F ∧ T = F.

Thus Q = F · F = F.

So P=T, Q=F. Different.

Case3: M=T, N=F, O=T.

Compute P:

~M=F, ~N=T → ~M ⊃ ~N is F → T = T.

O ≡ N: T ≡ F = F. So P = T ∨ F = T.

Compute Q:

~M · N: F · F = F.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O=F, ~N=T → (F ∧ T) = F. O ∨ N: T ∨ F = T. So F ∧ T = F.

Q = F · F = F.

So P=T, Q=F. Different.

Case4: M=T, N=F, O=F.

Compute P:

~M = F, ~N=T → F → T = T.

O ≡ N: F ≡ F = T. So P = T ∨ T = T.

Compute Q:

~M · N: F · F = F.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O=T, ~N=T → (T ∧ T) = T. O ∨ N: F ∨ F = F. So T ∧ F = F.

Q = F · F = F.

So P=T, Q=F. Different.

Case5: M=F, N=T, O=T.

Compute P:

~M=T, ~N=F → T → F = F.

O ≡ N: T ≡ T = T. So P = F ∨ T = T.

Compute Q:

~M · N: T · T = T.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O=F, ~N=F → (F ∧ F)=F. O ∨ N: T ∨ T = T. So F ∧ T = F.

So Q = T · F = F.

So, P=T, Q=F. Different.

Case6: M=F, N=T, O=F.

Compute P:

~M=T, ~N=F → T → F = F.

O ≡ N: F ≡ T = F. So P = F ∨ F = F.

Compute Q:

~M · N: T · T = T.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O=T, ~N=F → (T ∧ F)=F. O ∨ N: F ∨ T = T. So F ∧ T = F.

Q = T · F = F.

So P=F, Q=F. Same. So both are false.

Case7: M=F, N=F, O=T.

Compute P:

~M=T, ~N=T → T → T = T.

O ≡ N: T ≡ F = F. So P = T ∨ F = T.

Compute Q:

~M · N: T · F = F.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O=F, ~N=T → (F ∧ T)=F. O ∨ N: T ∨ F = T. So F ∧ T = F.

Q = F · F = F.

So P=T, Q=F. Different.

Case8: M=F, N=F, O=F.

Compute P:

~M=T, ~N=T → T → T = T.

O ≡ N: F ≡ F = T. So P = T ∨ T = T.

Compute Q:

~M · N: T · F = F.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O=T, ~N=T → (T ∧ T) = T. O ∨ N: F ∨ F = F. So T ∧ F = F.

Q = F · F = F.

So P=T, Q=F. Different.

So compiling the results:

For each case, the propositions P and Q are either both true, both false, or different.

Let's list each case's P and Q:

Case | P | Q
--- | --- | ---
1 | T | F
2 | T | F
3 | T | F
4 | T | F
5 | T | F
6 | F | F
7 | T | F
8 | T | F

So, in all cases except case 6, P and Q are both true or both false. In case 6, both are false.

Now, what does this tell us about the statements P and Q?

Wait, case 6 is when M=F, N=T, O=F.

Looking at the overall truth table, in case 6, both P and Q are false.

But looking back, in all other cases, either both are true or both are false.

So, when would P and Q be logically equivalent? That would require them to have the same truth values in all cases. But in this table, they don't. They are the same in all cases except case 6, where they are both false.

Wait, no. In all cases except case6, either both are true, or both are false. But in case6, both are false. So in all other cases, P and Q have the same truth values.

Wait, no, case6 is the only one where they are both false. So in all other cases, either both are true, or both are false.

Wait, so if two propositions are logically equivalent, they must have the same truth values in all possible scenarios. But here, they don't. They are the same in all scenarios except case6, where they are both false.

So, that suggests that they are not logically equivalent because they differ in at least one case.

Wait, but in all cases except case6, they have the same truth values. So in all cases except case6, they are the same. But case6 is the only one where they are both the same (both false). So, it's not the same in all cases. Because in case6, they are both the same, but in other cases, they are the same as well.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me see if P and Q are the same in all possible cases.

Looking back, in all cases except case6, P and Q have the same truth values.

In case6, both are same (both false).

So, wait, perhaps P and Q are logically equivalent. Because in all possible cases, they have the same truth values.

Wait, but I thought in case6, they are same, but in other cases, they are same as well. So yes, in all possible cases, they have the same truth values. So they are logically equivalent.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine the results.

In all cases except case6, P and Q have the same truth values. In case6, they are both false.

If that's the case, then P and Q are logically equivalent because they always have the same truth values.

Wait, but in the truth table, in all cases except case6, P and Q have the same values. In case6, they are both same (both false). So, yes, they are equivalent.

So, that suggests that P and Q are logically equivalent.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in all cases except case6, they have the same truth values. So, in that sense, they are logically equivalent.

Now, the question is to determine which of the following is true.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the cases.

Wait, in case6, M=F, N=T, O=F.

So, P = (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N) → (T ⊃ F) ∨ (T ≡ T) → T ∨ T = T.

Q = (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] → (T · T) · ( (T ∧ F) · (F ∨ F) ) → T · (F · F) → T · F = F.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in case6, M=F, N=T, O=F.

P = (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N) → (T → F) ∨ (T → T) → F ∨ T = T.

Q = (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] → (T · T) · (F · F) → T · F = F.

So, in case6, P is T, Q is F → different.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in case6, the expressions evaluate to F. So, that's correct.

Wait, so that suggests that in case6, P is T and Q is F. Whereas in all other cases, they have the same truth values.

So, the conclusion is that P and Q are logically equivalent because in all possible cases, they have the same truth values.

Wait, but case6 is the only case where they are the same (both T). In all other cases, they have the same truth values. So, their truth values are always the same. Therefore, they are logically equivalent.

Now, the question is to determine which of the following is true.

Wait, perhaps I should check again the cases to make sure.

Case6: M=F, N=T, O=F.

Check P:

~M = T, ~N = F. So, T → F = F.

O ≡ N: F ≡ T = F.

P = F ∨ F = F. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, in case6, P should be T, but according to this, P is F.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the computation.

Let me recompute P for case6.

Case6: M=F, N=T, O=F.

Compute P = (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N).

~M = T, ~N = F.

So, T → F = F.

Now, O ≡ N: F ≡ T = F.

So, P = F ∨ F = F.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, in case6, P is F, Q is F. So same.

In all other cases, P and Q have the same truth values.

So, that means that P and Q are logically equivalent.

So, in the truth table, P and Q have the same truth values across all possible cases.

Thus, P and Q are logically equivalent.

Therefore, the answer should be that the two statements are logically equivalent.

But wait, from the truth table, in all other cases, P and Q are same, but in case6, they are same too (both F). So the truth values are the same in all cases, so they are equivalent.

So, the conclusion is that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

Now, looking back at the original question, which asks to determine which of the following is true, but the question isn't fully restated here. I think the options are about whether the propositions are equivalent, contradictory, etc.

So, in this case, since P and Q are logically equivalent, the correct answer would be that they are logically equivalent.

But earlier, when I thought case6 was the only case where P and Q are same, but in other cases, they are same as well, so yes, they are same in all cases.

So, in all the cases, P and Q have the same truth values. Therefore, P and Q are logically equivalent.

So, the correct answer would be that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

Alternatively, since in all cases, P and Q have the same truth values, they must be equivalent.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought case6 was the only case where P and Q are the same, but in other cases, they are the same as well. So, yes, they are same in all cases, so they are equivalent.

Thus, the answer is that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

So, the correct answer would be that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

But looking back at the problem statement, I think the question is whether the two propositions are equivalent, which would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the truth table.

Wait, perhaps in case6, I should compute P again.

Case6: M=F, N=T, O=F.

Compute P = (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N).

~M = T, ~N = F.

So, T → F = F.

O ≡ N: F ≡ T = F.

So, P = F ∨ F = F.

Q = (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)].

~M = T, N=T → T · T = T.

[(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]: ~O = T, ~N = F → T ∧ F = F. O ∨ N = F ∨ T = T. So F ∧ T = F.

So, Q = T · F = F.

So, in case6, P=F, Q=F. Same.

In all other cases, P and Q have the same truth values.

So, the truth values of P and Q are the same across all cases, so they are logically equivalent.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in case6, P is T and Q is F. But now, I see that's incorrect. So, in case6, both are F, same.

In all other cases, P and Q are same as well.

Therefore, the answer is that the two propositions are logically equivalent.
</think>

The two propositions P and Q are logically equivalent because in all possible scenarios, they have the same truth values. Therefore, the conclusion is that the two propositions are logically equivalent.

**Answer:** The two propositions are logically equivalent.
