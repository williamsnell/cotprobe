Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about comprehensive schools in the 1960s. The question is asking why comprehensive schools didn't eradicate class inequalities in education. Let me break this down.

First, I remember from my studies that comprehensive schools were a major part of the education system in the 1960s. They were supposed to provide a broad, balanced education, covering all subjects. But I think they had some issues with inequality.

Option A says selective schools could 'cream off' the most able, while comprehensives put children into ability streams. Wait, selective schools are for high-achieving students, right? Like, they focus on the best students. But comprehensives might not be selective; maybe they have more mixed-ability classes. However, I'm not sure if comprehensive schools were selective or not. I think they were more about providing a broad education rather than differentiating based on ability.

Option B suggests comprehensive schools didn't have capacity to accommodate all students, causing overcrowding and lower quality. That makes some sense. In the 1960s, schools were probably more focused on attendance and not on individual student needs. So if there were more students than the school could handle, they'd have to put them into ability groups. That would mean some students are grouped with others, leading to inequalities based on their abilities.

Option C says comprehensive schools were in affluent areas, limiting access for working class students. That doesn't seem right because working class areas were probably more populated. The question is about the lack of elimination of inequality, not about the availability of students.

Option D compares teaching methods between teachers and students. I don't think that's the main point here. The issue is about the distribution of students, not the methods used.

Option E states segregation between working class and middle class students was still apparent. Another way of saying the same thing as option C, but again, it's more about the presence of students rather than inequality.

Option F says comprehensive schools recruited inner city and working class students. That sounds familiar. In the 1960s, there were issues with school funding and low enrollment in certain areas. So comprehensive schools, which were supposed to be affordable, might have been filled by students from working class backgrounds who couldn't afford the cost of education. This would mean that the schools didn't have enough students from the working class to fill them, leading to segregation.

Option G says comprehensive schools weren't funded well, limiting education for the poor. That's a possibility. Without adequate funding, schools might not provide quality education, but I'm not sure if this was the main issue causing inequality.

Option H is about not offering advanced courses, limiting gifted students. That's a possibility, but I think the main issue was more about the quality of education and the number of students, not the types of courses.

So, considering the options, I think option E is correct. The 1960s had issues with funding, so schools were filled by working class students, leading to segregation and not eliminating class inequalities.

The correct answer is:

**E: the segregation between working class and middle class in comprehensive schools was still very apparent**

This option highlights the issue where working class and middle class students were segregated in comprehensive schools, likely due to funding constraints and limited enrollment.
