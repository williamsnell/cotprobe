Okay, so I have this question here: "What is 7% equal to?" and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on percentages, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the percentage symbol means per hundred. So, 7% should be 7 per hundred, which is the same as 7 divided by 100. Let me write that down: 7% = 7/100. If I do the division, 7 divided by 100 is 0.07. So, the decimal equivalent of 7% is 0.07.

Now, looking at the options: 

A is 0.0007. That's way smaller than 0.07. 
B is 700, which is way bigger. 
C is 0.007, still smaller than 0.07. 
D is 0.007%. Oh wait, that's 0.007%, which is much smaller than 7%. 
E is 0.7. That's 0.7, which is 70% of 1, not 7%.
F is 0.7%. That's even smaller. 
G is 7, which is 100% of 7, not 7%.
H is 70, which is even bigger than G. 
I is 7%, which is exactly what we're looking for. 
J is 0.07, which matches our calculation.

So, the correct answer should be option I because it's exactly 7%. Alternatively, option J is 0.07, which is the decimal form of 7%. But wait, the question asks what it's equal to. So, 7% equals 0.07 as a decimal, which is option J. Alternatively, option I is saying 7%, which is the percentage form.

Wait, but the question is asking what 7% is equal to. So, the options are the possible forms. So, 7% is equal to 0.07. So option J is correct because it's the decimal representation. Alternatively, 7% is equal to 700 times 0.01, which is 0.07. So yes, the answer must be J.

The correct answer is J: 0.07.
