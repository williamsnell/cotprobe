Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Reiman and van den Haag's arguments for the death penalty. Hmm, I remember that these two are significant figures in the debate around capital punishment. Let me try to think through this.

The question is asking what their arguments are based on. The options include various points like flawed evidence, human rights, retribution, etc.

Wait, I think Reiman and van den Haag were involved in the context of the death penalty's morality. I recall that Reiman argued against the death penalty as it's a form of torture. Or was it Van den Haag? Maybe Reiman's arguments were more about the necessity of capital punishment, while Van den Haag's might have focused on the concept of retribution.

Looking at the options, option F says they should be accepted. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, option C is about human rights, which might not be their strongest point, but they did discuss the moral constraints.

Option G says their arguments contradict human rights. I think that's not entirely accurate. They did argue for the death penalty, but it's about its moral impermissible nature rather than outright human rights violations.

Option H says their arguments are based on retribution. That might not be correct either. Reitation might be more about the concept of retribution, but Reiman's position was about the necessity of punishment, not necessarily retribution.

Option I says they promote the idea of capital punishment. That could be true because I think their arguments were in favor of it, but I'm not sure if they promoted it as a moral choice or just discussed its necessity.

Wait, another angle: I remember that Reiman and Van den Haag's arguments were in the context of the right to life and the moral imperative to use the death penalty. So their main point is that it's necessary, not that it's inherently wrong. So their arguments are flawed because they're based on moral impermissible necessity, not on factual or empirical evidence.

But looking at the options, option B says their arguments are flawed due to lack of empirical evidence. That seems plausible. Reiman and Van den Haag might have argued that the death penalty is morally impermissible because it's a necessary punishment, but they might not have provided solid empirical evidence to back this up. Their arguments might have been more philosophical or theoretical than based on real-world evidence.

Alternatively, option F says they should be accepted. But I don't think that's correct because their arguments were against it, not for it.

So looking at the options, option B seems to fit. Their arguments were flawed because they're based on moral impermissible necessity without empirical support. So the answer is B.

The correct answer is B: are flawed due to lack of empirical evidence. Reiman and van den Haag's arguments for the death penalty were based on moral impermissible necessity without empirical support, making their arguments flawed.

Answer: B
