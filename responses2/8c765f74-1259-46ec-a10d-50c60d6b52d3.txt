Okay, so I have this accounting question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about what an auditor should do when there's a change in accounting principles but the effect on comparability isn't material. Hmm. I remember that when a change happens, auditors should probably not make the audit any worse. So, the effect isn't material, which probably means they don't need to adjust their opinion or change their report.

The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Issue a qualified opinion due to the change. Wait, I think qualified opinions are given when the change is material, right? And the question says the effect isn't material. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: Refer to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change. I'm not sure. If the note is about the change, maybe the auditor should include that. But does that mean they have to refer to the note or can they just state it? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Option C: Explicitly state whether the change conforms with GAAP. That sounds like the auditor should clarify whether the change is acceptable. But again, if the change isn't material, maybe they don't need to do that. Or wait, maybe they still have to mention it to show compliance.

Option D: Include a paragraph detailing the change in the notes to the financial statements. This seems like a good choice. If the change isn't significant, maybe the notes can just include a brief mention without elaborating too much. Or maybe the notes should just summarize the change without going into too much detail, especially if it's not material.

Option E: Issue an adverse opinion. No, that's not right. Adverse opinions are when the change affects comparability, and the effect is material. So E is the opposite of what we need.

Option F: Request client to restate prior year's statements. That doesn't seem right. The question is about the effect on comparability, not about the client's responsibility.

Option G: Discontinue audit due to change in principles. I don't think that makes sense. The audit should probably continue regardless of the change; it's more about the impact on comparability.

Option H: Not refer to the change in the auditor's report. Wait, no, the auditor should refer, but only if the change is material. Since it's not, maybe they don't need to. Or perhaps they do need to, just not in a significant way.

Option I: Refer to an emphasis-of-matter paragraph. I'm not familiar with this. Emphasis of matter is about how detailed the financial statements are. I don't think that's the case here.

Option J: Require the client to disclose the change in a separate financial statement. That's about transparency, I think. The question is about comparability, not about disclosure. So J is probably not correct.

So, the key here is whether the change is material. Since it's not, the auditor doesn't need to redo the audit or change the report. They can refer to the current notes, but not in a way that affects the comparability. So option D says to include a paragraph detailing the change in the notes. That sounds correct because the notes can just mention the change without going into too much detail, especially if it's not material.

Wait, but sometimes auditors do that to avoid making other people think the change is material. So including a brief note in the notes to the financial statements would be appropriate. That aligns with option D.

Option B's note might refer to the existing change, but since the effect isn't material, maybe including it isn't necessary unless the change's impact is significant. But the question says it's not material, so maybe B isn't the right choice.

So the correct answer seems to be D.

The correct answer is D: Include a paragraph detailing the change in the notes to the financial statements.

**Explanation:**

When there's a change in accounting principles that has no significant effect on comparability, the auditor should not alter the audit significantly. Therefore, they should reference the change in the notes without elaborating excessively, as this is optional and can be omitted if the change is not material. This allows the auditor to maintain the audit's objectivity while acknowledging the change. 

Option D is the most appropriate choice because it directs the auditor to include a brief mention of the change in the notes, which is acceptable when the impact is not material. Other options either involve unnecessary changes (B) or incorrect actions (A, C, E, G, H, J) or require disclosure (J), which is not relevant to comparability.
