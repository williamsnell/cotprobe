Okay, so I need to figure out what 365 plus 56 is. Hmm, let me think about how to add these numbers. 

First, I'll write them down to make it clearer. 

365  
+ 56  
= ?

I'll start by adding the units place. 5 plus 6 is 11. So I write down 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place. 

Next, the tens place: 6 plus 5 is 11, plus the carried over 1 makes 12. I write down 2 and carry over 1 again. 

Finally, the hundreds place: 3 plus 0 (since 56 has no hundreds) plus the carried over 1 makes 4. 

So putting it all together, the sum should be 421. Let me check if I did that right. 

Wait, maybe I should try adding them another way. Like, 365 plus 50 is 415, and then add 6 more to get 421. Yep, that checks out. 

Looking at the options, D is 421. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: 421.
