C: M~ism
D: ~Mmis
E: M~mis
F: ~Mmsi

Okay, so I have this logic problem here. The question is to select the best translation into predicate logic for the statement: "Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy." The options are A to I, and each involves various combinations of the predicates and variables.

Let me break this down. The sentence is about Marco moving, but specifically, the fact is that he doesn't move from Spain to Italy. So, I need to represent that in predicate logic.

First, let's identify the components. The main subject is Marco, the predicate is that he doesn't move from one place to another. The locations are s for Spain and i for Italy.

The predicate given is Mxyz, which I think stands for "x moves to y from z." So, each Mxyz is a predicate that says x moves from z to y.

Now, the statement says Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy. So, x is Marco (m), z is Spain (s), and y is Italy (i). So, the predicate would be Mmzi.

But wait, the statement is that Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy, which is the negation of him moving from there. So, the predicate is negated.

So, the full statement in predicate logic should be ~Mmzi.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option A: ~Mis. Hmm, Mis would be Mm s? Because if s is Spain, then Mis is Mm s. So ~Mis would be ~Mm s, which is the same as ~Mmzi when i is Italy, but wait, the actual variables are m, s, i. So Mis is Mm s, so ~Mis would be ~Mm s. But the correct statement is ~Mmzi, which is ~Mm s i. So option A is just ~Mm s, which is incorrect because it doesn't include the destination Italy.

Option B: Msi~. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Msi would be Mm i s â€” does that make sense? Or maybe it's Mm i s. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the predicate structure. The problem says Mxyz is x moving to y from z. So Mmzi is correct because x is Marco (m), y is Italy (i), z is Spain (s). So Mmzi is Mm ( Marco) moving to i (Italy) from s (Spain). So the correct predicate is Mmzi, and the negation is ~Mmzi.

So looking at the options, none of the options directly have ~Mmzi. Let me look again.

Option G: M~si. Wait, that's not correct. M~si would mean something like M moves from s to i, but the correct predicate is Mmzi, which is Marco moving from s to i. So G is M~si, which doesn't make sense because M is the subject, and ~si is moving from s to i, but the predicate is about moving from s to i. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, looking again: the options are:

A: ~Mis
B: Msi~
C: M~ism
D: ~Mmis
E: M~mis
F: ~Mmsi
G: M~si
H: M~msi
I: Mims~

Wait, perhaps I should parse each option.

Option B: Msi~. That would be M moving from s to i, but with a tilde. Wait, Msi is M moving from s to i, but the original is M moving from s to i. So Msi would mean moving from s to i, but the correct is M moves from s to i, so Msi is correct. But then adding a tilde would make it Msi~. So the option is Msi~.

Wait, but the original statement is that Marco doesn't move from s to i. So the correct translation is ~Msi. So option B is Msi~, which is the same as ~Msi. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. The original problem is "Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy." So, in terms of moving from s to i. So the predicate is M moving from s to i. So the correct predicate is Msi, meaning Marco moves from s to i. So the negation is ~Msi. So the correct option is the one that says ~Msi.

Looking back, option B is Msi~, which is correct.

Wait, let me check other options. Option F is ~Mmsi. Mmsi would be moving from m to i, but that doesn't fit the scenario. So no.

Option B: Msi~. So that's correct.

So the answer should be option B: Msi~.

The correct translation is ~Msi, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
