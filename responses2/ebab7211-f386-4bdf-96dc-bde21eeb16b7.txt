Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is asking what value of y makes the equation y + 2.9 equal to 11 true. Hmm, I need to find y. Let me think about how to solve this.

Alright, so the equation is y + 2.9 = 11. To find y, I should isolate it on one side. How do I do that? Oh right, I subtract 2.9 from both sides. So, that would be y = 11 - 2.9.

Wait, let me calculate that. 11 minus 2.9. Hmm. 11 is the same as 10.9 plus 0.1. So, 10.9 + 0.1 is 11.0. So, subtracting 2.9 from 11.0 would be 11.0 - 2.9. Let me do the math. 11 minus 2 is 9, and then minus 0.9 is 8.1. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me calculate it correctly.

Alternatively, 2.9 is the same as 2.90. So, 11.00 - 2.90. Subtracting the cents: 00 minus 90. Can't do that, so borrow a ten. 100 cents minus 90 is 10. So, the tenths place becomes 10 - 9 = 1. The units place was 11, after borrowing it's 10, so 10 - 2 is 8. So, 8.1. So, y equals 8.1.

Looking at the options, which one is 8.1? Let me check the options again. Option C is 11.1, that's too big. Option G is 8.1. So, the correct answer should be option G.

The equation y + 2.9 = 11 requires solving for y. Subtracting 2.9 from both sides gives y = 11 - 2.9 = 8.1. The correct option is G, which is 8.1.

Answer: G
