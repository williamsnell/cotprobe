Okay, I'm trying to solve this polarized light problem. So, the question is about unpolarized light going through two ideal linear polarizers with their transmission axes at 45 degrees. I remember that when dealing with polarizers, the intensity depends on the angle between the transmission axes.

Unpolarized light has an intensity of I0, and when it passes through the first polarizer, which has a transmission axis at 0 degrees (let's say the first one is at θ1=0), the intensity becomes I1 = I0/2. That's because an unpolarized beam passes through a polarizer, and half of the light is transmitted.

Now, the second polarizer is at 45 degrees to the first. So the angle between the two transmission axes is 45 degrees. The second polarizer will further filter the light. The formula for the intensity after the second polarizer is I2 = I1 * cos²(θ), where θ is the angle between the two transmission axes.

Plugging in the numbers, I1 is I0/2, and θ is 45 degrees. So cos(45°) is √2/2, and squared is (2/4) = 0.5. So I2 = (I0/2) * 0.5 = I0/4.

Wait, wait, that would mean the intensity is a quarter of the original, which is 25%. But wait, that's option D. But wait, I'm getting confused. Because after the second polarizer, we have I2 = (I1) * cos^2(theta). I1 was I0/2. So cos^2(45) is 0.5, so I2 is (I0/2)*0.5 = I0/4. So intensity is 25% of the original. That would be option D.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: the first polarizer gives I0/2. The second polarizer, at 45 degrees, so the angle between their transmission axes is 45 degrees. The formula is I2 = I1 * cos^2(theta). So I1 is I0/2, theta is 45. So I2 = (I0/2) * (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = (I0/2)* (2/4) )= (I0/2) * (1/2) )= I0/4, so 25% which is 25%. So answer is D.

Wait, but I've heard sometimes that the maximum transmission is when the second is at 0, which is 50%, but when it's at 45, it's lower. Another way to think: if the first and second polarizers are 45 degrees apart, then the maximum reduction is 25% because cos(45) is about 0.707, squared is 0.5.

Yes, that makes sense. So the transmitted intensity is 25% of the original, which is option D.

Unpolarized light with intensity \( I_0 \) passes through the first polarizer, which reduces the intensity to \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \) because unpolarized light is filtered to half intensity by a polarizer. The second polarizer has its transmission axis at 45 degrees to the first, so the angle between their transmission axes is \( \theta = 45^\circ \). The intensity after the second polarizer is given by:

\[
I_2 = I_1 \cos^2(\theta)
\]

Substituting \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \) and \( \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we find:

\[
I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{I_0}{4}
\]

Thus, the transmitted intensity is 25% of the original intensity, which corresponds to option D.
