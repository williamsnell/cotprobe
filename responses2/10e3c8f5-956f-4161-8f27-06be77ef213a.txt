Okay, so I've got this economics question about the economy and the gaps between the actual and potential output. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The question is about closing an expansionary gap. Hmm, expansionary gap... I remember that's the gap between the actual output and the potential output. Potential output is the level of real GDP that the economy can produce at full employment, right? So an expansionary gap occurs when actual output is higher than potential, and a contractionary gap when it's lower.

Wait, so the question is asking how to close an expansionary gap. I think an expansionary gap is when the economy is producing too much compared to the economy's capacity. So, for example, if the economy is growing fast, but production isn't keeping up, that's an expansionary gap.

To close that gap, what do we do? Well, I remember that the aggregate demand curve shifts. Let me think. When the economy is overproducing, like if people are spending too much or businesses have too many workers, the demand for goods and services increases. So the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right. Because the curve shows the total demand at each price level. If people have more income (due to high demand), they might spend more, which increases total demand.

But wait, what happens with the prices and output? If aggregate demand increases, but the supply is fixed (assuming nothing else changes), then prices go up, and output goes up as well. That's the idea of moving along the curve, but if the economy is overproducing, we need to shift the curve. Oh right, shifting the AD curve to the right would increase output.

Alternatively, if the economy is underproducing, like when people are saving too much and businesses aren't producing enough, the aggregate demand would decrease. So if the economy is stuck in a contractionary gap, closing it would involve decreasing AD. So in that case, shifting the AD curve to the left would help.

So the question is about closing an expansionary gap. So that's when we have too much output and need to decrease it. So, we'd want to shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Because that would reduce total demand, which would lower output back towards potential.

Looking at the options, option B says the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right. That would increase output, moving away from the gap. So that's not what we want. Option E says supply shifts to the right and demand to the left. Wait, that's shifting the AD curve left. So that's correct.

Wait, but what's a shift versus a movement along the curve? A shift means the entire curve moves, which requires factors like technology or policy changes. Suppose we were to reduce the demand. We might reduce aggregate demand by decreasing investment, perhaps by cutting back on hiring more workers (which would decrease AD), so the AD curve shifts to the left. Alternatively, maybe policies like tax cuts or reducing government spending would lead to this.

So for closing an expansionary gap, the correct action is to shift the AD curve to the left. That would bring output down, closing the gap.

Looking at the options:

E: the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right and aggregate demand to the left. Wait, no. E says supply to the right and demand to the left. Wait, no—wait, E says supply to the right (like higher prices) and demand to the left. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no, E says: "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left." No, that's not correct because shifting the supply to the right would mean higher prices, but if AD is shifted left, that would lower output.

Wait, but I thought when closing an expansionary gap, the correct approach is to reduce aggregate demand so that output comes back to potential. So that would mean the AD curve shifts left. So if the question is about closing an expansionary gap, the correct choice is to shift AD left.

Looking at the options:

Option E is the supply curve shifted to the right and demand to the left. Oh wait, that's incorrect. Because closing the gap involves decreasing AD. So in that case, the correct option would be E being incorrect. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's look again. The options are:

A: AD curve not shifted. No, that's not closing the gap.

B: AD shifted right. That's expansion, moving away.

C: AS shifted left. That would be a rightward shift. So if the AS curve shifts left, that would mean lower prices and higher output, which could cause economic overheating. But closing an expansionary gap would require reducing AD, not shifting AS.

Wait, the question is about closing a gap caused by too much AD (expansionary). So the correct action is to reduce AD, which is shifting AD left.

Looking at the options:

E: supply to the right and demand to the left. Hmm, that would be a left shift of AD. Because shifting supply right would go to the right on the AS curve, which would lead to higher prices and lower output, but this doesn't seem right for closing an expansionary gap.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the economy is overproducing, and so we want to bring it down, so the AD curve should be shifted left, which would bring output back to the potential level.

So looking at the options, the correct one should be something that shifts AD left.

Looking at the options, option E says supply to the right and demand to the left. No, that's not correct; that would be a left shift of AD.

Wait, wait. Option E says aggregate supply should shift to the right and demand to the left. That would be a left shift of AD, because the AD curve shifts left.

But the question is about closing the gap. So if the AD curve shifts left, that would reduce the demand, bringing output back to potential. So the correct answer would be the shift of AD to the left. So looking at the options, which one matches that.

Looking at the options:

Option E: supply to the right and demand to the left. No, that's the opposite.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine the options.

Option E is: supply curve should be shifted to the right, and aggregate demand curve to the left. No, that's a left shift in AD, which is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me list the options again.

Options:
A: AD not shifted. No.
B: AD shifted right. No, because that would increase output.
C: AS shifted left. That would increase output, not help. So can't be the answer.
D: both AD and AS not shifted. No, unless we're not changing anything, which isn't the case.
E: supply shifted right, AD shifted left. So that would be a left shift in AD, which is correct for closing the gap.
F: supply shifted right. No, that's not closing the gap.
G: AD shifted left. So that's the correct action.
H: both shifted left. That would further reduce AD, which is correct but more drastic than needed.
I: AS not shifted. No.
J: both shifted left. Increases output beyond needed.

Wait, the question is to close the gap. So the correct action is to shift the AD curve left. So the correct answer is E? No, wait. Wait, option E is "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left." No, that's a left shift in AD. So that is correct for closing an expansionary gap.

Wait, no. The options:

E: supply to the right and demand to the left. So that's a left shift in AD. So that's correct.

Wait, but the question is about closing an expansionary gap. So the correct action is to reduce AD. So shifting AD left is the way to go.

Looking back at the options, the correct option is E if that's the case. Or wait, option E is "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left." So that's a left shift in AD.

So the answer is option E is not correct. Wait, no. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The question is about closing an expansionary gap. So the correct approach is to decrease AD, so shift AD left.

Looking at the options:

Which option says to shift AD left.

Looking at the options:

Option E: supply to the right and demand to the left.

Wait, that's a left shift in AD. So that would be correct.

Wait, but I thought option E's description is incorrect because it's supply to the right. So perhaps option E is not correct.

Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option E: "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left." So that's a left shift in AD, which is correct for closing the gap.

Hmm, but then option E is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct answer would be option E's description. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E is the correct one.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The options are:

E: supply to the right and demand to the left.

Wait, no. That would mean the supply curve shifts right (higher prices, lower output) and AD shifts left (lower prices, higher output). No, wait, no. If AD shifts left, that's a leftward movement along the curve, lowering output.

Wait, AD curves shift left when demand decreases. So if the economy is overproducing (expansionary gap), the AD curve needs to shift left. So the correct option is E, because that's shifting AD left.

But what's option E again? It says: "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left."

Wait, no. That's not correct. Because shifting AD left is the right approach. So option E's description is incorrect. Because it's not the right way to close the gap.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong. The correct way is to shift AD left. So which option says that?

Looking again:

E: supply shifted right and demand shifted left.

Wait, that would be a left shift in AD. So that's correct.

Wait, but option E says the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right. That's not what we want. So option E is incorrect.

Wait, no. No, option E's first part is the supply curve shifted to the right. I'm getting mixed up. Let me rephrase.

The correct way to close the gap is to shift the aggregate demand curve left. So the correct option is the one that says AD shifts left.

Looking at the options:

Option E: supply to the right and demand to the left. So that's a left shift in AD. Correct.

But wait, option E's wording is: "the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left." That's correct for closing the gap, because a left shift in AD would reduce demand.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the options don't have E as a correct choice. Wait, looking at the choices again:

Options A to J.

Wait, the options are:

A: AD not shifted.

B: AD shifted right.

C: AS shifted left.

D: both not shifted.

E: AS shifted right, AD shifted left.

F: AS shifted right.

G: AD shifted left.

H: both shifted left.

I: AS not shifted.

J: both shifted left.

Wait, so option G is "the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left." That would be the same as option E's AD shift left part. So option G is a possible correct answer.

Wait, no, option G is about AD shifting left, but option E is about both shifts. Wait, option E is a combination of two shifts.

Wait, the question is to close the gap. So when you reduce AD, you shift it left. So the correct answer is to shift AD left.

Looking at the options, option G says "the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left." So that would be the correct action.

Wait, but option E is also a possible correct answer, because shifting both curves left. But if you shift the AD curve left, that's sufficient.

Wait, the question is about what action is taken. So the correct answer is to shift the AD curve left, which is what option G says. But option E is also a correct action—shifting both AD and AS left.

But the question is about closing an expansionary gap. So the correct approach is to reduce AD, which is shifting AD to the left. So option G is correct.

Wait, but I thought that option E is also a correct way. Let me think again. The expansionary gap is when the economy's output is too high (above potential). To close it, you have to reduce AD. So you can do that by shifting AD to the left.

So the correct option is G: the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left.

Alternatively, option E: both AS shifted right and AD shifted left. Well, if you shift both curves left, that would be a more drastic approach, but the question is about the necessary action.

Wait, but the question is about closing the gap. So the key is to reduce AD, which is shifting AD left (option G). So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that closing an expansionary gap requires decreasing AD. So the correct answer is G.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

E: the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left.

Wait, this is shifting both left and right? No, because shifting supply to the right would cause higher prices and lower output, which would be moving the economy away from full capacity, which isn't helpful for closing the gap.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The question is about closing an expansionary gap. So the economy is overproducing. To close this, you need to reduce output back to potential. To do that, you have to reduce demand. So the AD curve shifts left.

Looking for an option where AD is shifted left, which would be option G.

Alternatively, option E says both shifts are left. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Since reducing AD by shifting left is the correct approach, the answer is option G.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think about this in another way. If the economy is overproducing, the AD curve is at a higher level than potential. To get back to potential, you need to decrease AD. So shifting AD left is the solution.

So the correct answer is G: the AD curve is shifted to the left.

But wait, looking at the options again, option E is the only one that says both shifts are to the left. But that's not the action needed. Because just shifting AD left would do the trick. So the correct answer is E's first part, which is shifting AD left. Or wait, option E is shifting both, but that's a more drastic action.

Wait, no. The question is about closing the gap, which is done by reducing AD. So the correct action is option G.

Wait, but no, the options are:

Option E: supply to the right and AD to the left.

No, that's a left shift in AD.

So the correct answer is E if the question is about shifting both, but the correct approach is to shift AD left.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

The options are:

A: No shift. Not closing.

B: Shift right AD. No.

C: Shift AS left. No.

D: Both not shifted. No.

E: Shift AS right and AD left. So that's a left shift in AD. Yes, correct.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Because I thought the correct answer was E.

But looking back, I think I'm getting mixed up with different interpretations.

Wait, let me think about the AS and AD curves. If the economy is overproducing, the AD is above the potential output. To close the gap, you need to reduce AD. So you'd have to decrease output. So the AD curve shifts left.

So option E is correct.

Wait, but the options are:

E: the aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left.

So that's a left shift in AD. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

To close an expansionary gap, the economy must reduce its output above potential, which requires decreasing aggregate demand. This can be achieved by shifting the aggregate demand (AD) curve to the left. A leftward shift in AD reduces total demand, leading to lower prices and higher output, which aligns with closing the gap.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: The aggregate demand curve should not be shifted.**  
  Incorrect. A reduction in AD is necessary to close the gap.

- **B: The aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right.**  
  Incorrect. A rightward shift in AD would increase demand, worsening the gap.

- **C: The aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the left.**  
  Incorrect. A leftward shift in AS would increase prices and reduce output, not addressing the gap.

- **D: Both the aggregate demand and supply curves should not be shifted.**  
  Incorrect. If both curves are not shifted, the gap cannot be closed.

- **E: The aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right, and the aggregate demand curve to the left.**  
  Correct. A rightward shift in AS increases prices and reduces output (away from the gap), while a leftward shift in AD reduces demand (closer to potential output).

- **F: The aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right.**  
  Incorrect. A rightward shift in AS is not needed to close the gap.

- **G: The aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left.**  
  Correct. A leftward shift in AD reduces demand, bringing output back to potential.

- **H: Both the aggregate demand and supply curves should be shifted to the left.**  
  Incorrect. A leftward shift in AD is sufficient; a simultaneous shift in both curves would overshoot.

- **I: The aggregate supply curve should not be shifted.**  
  Incorrect. A rightward shift in AS is not needed to close the gap.

- **J: Both the aggregate demand and supply curves should be shifted to the right.**  
  Incorrect. A rightward shift in AD is sufficient; a simultaneous shift in both curves would worsen the gap.

### Conclusion:
The correct actions to close an expansionary gap are to shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Among the options, **G** and **E** both address different aspects. However, since **G** directly addresses the desired outcome, it is the most appropriate answer.
