Okay, so Paul wants to know the exact interest he'll pay for a $720 loan at 5% per year, from April 25 to June 15. Hmm, exact interest probably means simple interest, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think.

First, I need to calculate the number of days between April 25 and June 15. Let's break it down. April has 30 days, so from April 25 to April 30 is 5 days (including the 25th). Then May has 31 days. June 1 to June 15 is 15 days. So total days are 5 + 31 + 15 = 51 days.

Wait, wait. Wait, April 25 is the starting point. So from April 25 to April 30 is 5 days (since 25 is the starting day, the 25th is the first day, and April 30 is the last day of the month). So 30 - 25 = 5 days? No, wait, no. Wait, if it's from April 25 to April 25: that's 0 days. So April 25 to April 30 is 5 days. Because 30 -25 = 5, but you include both start and end days. Wait no, wait. Wait, no: from day 1 (April 25) to day 5 (April 30) is 5-25 +1 = 6 days? Or is it 5 days, since you count each day from 25 to 30 inclusive. So 25,26,27,28,29,30: that's 6 days. Ah, I see. So I should count the days between April 25 and June 15, including both start and end.

So April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (25,26,27,28,29,30). Then May has 31 days, and June 1 to June 15 is 15 days. So total days is 6 +31 +15 = 52 days.

Wait, no. Let me recount. April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (including both ends). May has 31 days, so from May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. June 1 to June 15 is 15 days. So 6 + 31 +15 = 52 days. So 52 days.

But sometimes, when calculating exact interest, you might consider the exact number of days between dates, sometimes including the end date. But I think in this case, since Paul is starting on April 25 and ending on June 15, the exact period is 52 days, including both start and end dates.

Wait, no. Wait, the period is from April 25 to June 15. So how many days is that? Let's count each day.

April 25,26,27,28,29,30: that's 6 days. May 1 to May 31: 31 days. June 1 to June 15:15 days. Total 6 +31 +15 = 52 days.

But sometimes, in some contexts, the end date is included. So that's 52 days. So 52 days.

Now, the interest is calculated as principal * rate * time. So it's 720 * 0.05 * (52/365), since the rate is annual, and we're using exact days.

Wait, but wait, maybe the exact method is the actual number of days, so using 52/365.

So let me compute.

First, 5% per year is 0.05.

Principal is $720.

Time is 52 days / 365 days per year.

So:

Interest = 720 * 0.05 * (52/365)

Let me compute that.

720 * 0.05 = 36. So interest is 36 * (52/365).

Compute 52/365: that's approximately 0.1424657534.

So 36 * 0.1424657534 ≈ 5.1288.

Wait, 36 * 0.1424657534 = ?

Well, 36 * 0.1424 = 5.1264. But let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 36 * 52 = 1872. 1872 / 365 = ?

Let me compute 1872 ÷ 365.

365 *5 = 1825. 1872-1825=47. So 5 and 47/365.

47/365 is approximately 0.128767.

So 5.128767.

So approximately $5.13 in interest. But the options are all whole numbers. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount.

Wait, April 25 to June 15.

April: 25,26,27,28,29,30 → 6 days.

May: 31 days.

June: 15 days (from June 1 to June 15 is 15 days).

Total: 6 +31 +15 = 52 days.

Wait, but wait, when you count from April 25 to June 15 inclusive, you have to consider how many days each month has.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me think again.

Wait, the exact period is from April 25 to June 15. So April 25 is day 0? Or the start date is April 25, and the end is June 15. So the number of days is the number of days between April 25 and June 15, including both dates.

So, days in April: 25th is day 1, 26th day 2, 27th day3, 28th day4, 29th day5, 30th day6. Then May 1 is day7, up to May31: 31 days in May. June 1 is day38 (6+31), and up to day52 (June 15). So 52 days.

Alternatively, sometimes, the number of days between two dates is the end date minus the start date, without including the start date. So to be precise, perhaps I should use the formula: days = (end_date - start_date) +1, if inclusive.

But in this case, the exact period is from April 25 to June 15, which includes both dates. So 52 days.

But let me think about another approach. I could calculate the exact number of days between April 25 and June 15.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the exact days by adding the days in each month correctly.

Starting from April 25:

April 25: day1

April 26: day2

...

April 30: day6

May 1: day7

May 31: day31

June 1: day32

June 15: day47 (since day32 is June 1, 33 is 2, ..., 32 +15 =47).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if June 1 is day32, then June 15 is day32 +14 =46? No, wait, I'm confusing the count.

Wait, let's count:

April has 25,26,27,28,29,30: 6 days.

May has 31 days.

June, from 1 to 15: 15 days.

So, from April 25 to June 15, the total days counted as inclusive is 6 (April) +31 (May) +15 (June) =52 days.

But wait, wait. If I count the days from April 25 to June 15, including both dates, then that's 52 days.

Wait, no. Because from April 25 to April 25 is 1 day (so day1), but when including both dates, it's 6 days (April25 to April30). So that's 6 days.

But perhaps I should think differently. Let's think of the number of days from April25 to June15, including both dates.

So April25 is day0? Or day1? No, perhaps better to think of the dates as:

April25, April26, ..., April30 (6 days). So from April25 to April30 is 6 days, including the start and end.

Then May has 31 days, so May1 to May31 is 31 days.

Then June1 to June15 is 15 days.

So total days: 6+31+15 =52 days.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of days from April 25 to June 15 is (June 15 - April 25) +1 days.

But I think the correct approach is to calculate the exact number of days between the two dates, including both endpoints.

So let's use the formula: days = (end_date - start_date) +1 if inclusive.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to calculate each month.

From April25 to April30: 6 days.

May has 31 days.

June 1 to June15:15 days.

Total 6+31+15=52.

So 52 days.

Now, the interest is calculated as P * R * T, where T is in years.

So P = $720, R=5% =0.05, T=52/365.

So interest = 720 * 0.05 * (52/365).

Compute 52/365 first.

52 divided by 365 is approximately 0.14246575342465753.

Multiply by 0.05: 0.05 * 0.14246575342465753 = 0.007123287671232876.

So 720 * 0.007123287671232876 = ?

720 * 0.007123 = let's compute.

720 * 0.007 = 5.04.

720 *0.000123= 0.08856.

So total is 5.04 +0.08856=5.12856.

So interest is approximately $5.13.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: $2.03, B:4.03, C:10.03, etc. Wait, none of these are near $5.13.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I'm counting the days incorrectly.

Wait, maybe I should count the days from April 25 to June 15, not including the end date.

Wait, let's think: if it's from April25 to June15, but not including June15, then the total days are 51.

Wait, let me recount.

April25 to April30: 6 days.

May1 to May31:31 days.

June1 to June14:14 days.

So 6 +31 +14=51 days.

So 51 days.

Then, interest would be 720 *0.05 * (51/365).

Compute 51/365 = approx 0.13972602739726028.

So 0.05 *0.139726 = 0.0069863.

Multiply by 720: 720 *0.0069863 = let's see.

720 *0.006 =4.32.

720 *0.0009863= approx 0.711.

So total is 4.32 +0.711=5.031.

So $5.03.

Looking back at the options, option E is $5.03.

So the correct answer would be E: $5.03.
</think>

The exact interest is calculated using simple interest, where the number of days between April 25 and June 15 is 51 days (excluding June 15). The interest is:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time  
= $720 × 5% × (51/365)  
= $720 × 0.05 × 0.139726  
≈ $5.03.

The closest option is E: $5.03.
