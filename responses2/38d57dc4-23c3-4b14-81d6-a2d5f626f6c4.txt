Okay, so I need to figure out how the Arabic numeral for '2' is written. Let me think about this. I'm a bit rusty on my numerals, but I'll try to remember.

First, the options are A to J. The possible answers are:

A: IIi
B: Zwei
C: Deux
D: Dos
E: I
F: Two
G: 22
H: 2
I: ii
J: II

Wait, let me list the numerals I know. The number 2 in Arabic script is usually written as 'Zwe', which is one of the options. So that would be option B or D. Hmm, but wait, sometimes you see '2' written as 'II' in some contexts, like in Roman numerals, but that's not for Arabic numerals. Oh wait, noâ€”the question is about Arabic numerals, so that's not it.

Alternatively, I remember that in some scripts, like Arabic, the number two is called 'Zwe', which is written with two lines. So that's option B. But another option is 'Dos', which is D. Wait, I'm getting confused between these. Let me think, in the Arabic alphabet, 'Zwe' is the word for two, and 'Dos' is another form. Or maybe it's '2' as a digit, which is written as 'II' in some cases. Wait, but the question is specifically about the numeral, not the word.

Wait, the options are in the form of writing the numeral, not the word. So the numeral for two is '2', which is a single digit. So looking at the options, H is '2', which would be correct. But wait, one of the options is 'II' (J), which is written as two I's. Wait, are there any cases where the numeral is written as 'II' for two?

No, I think the numeral two is written as '2', which is a single digit. So the correct answer should be H: 2. But wait, looking back, the options are:

Option H: 2, which is the Arabic numeral two. So that's the right choice. But wait, let me make sure. Are there any other options that represent two in different forms? Option B is 'Zwe', which is the word form, not the numeral. Option D is 'Dos', which is another word for two but perhaps a different form. Option G is '22', which is for twenty-two, so that's not two. Option C is 'Deux', which is also the word for two.

So the numeral for two is '2', which is option H. But wait, another thought: Is there a way that the numeral is written with two I's? Like II? That would be 2 in Roman numerals, but in Arabic numerals, it's just a single 2. So I think the correct answer is H: 2.

The correct numeral for '2' in Arabic is '2', which is option H.
