Okay, so I need to figure out which options are the synoptic Gospels. I remember from my studies that the synoptic Gospels are the first three books of the New Testament, which are Luke, John, and Paul. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I should think this through carefully.

First, I recall that the New Testament is divided into four books: Luke, John, Mark, and the Gospels. The first three are the early ones, and the fourth is the Gospels. Synoptic Gospels are the ones that contain a lot of shared content, so they're used to show the early Christian church's growth.

I think the first three are Luke, John, and Paul. But I'm not entirely sure if all three are considered synoptic. I remember that Mark is more like the later books, while Luke and John are more of the early ones. So, when the question is asking which are the synoptic Gospels, the correct answer should include the first three: Luke, John, and Paul.

Looking at the options, option A is Luke, John, Paul. Option I is John, Matthew, Paul. Wait, no, that's not right because Mark isn't included there. Option G is Matthew, Mark, Peter. That's the later ones, so probably not. Option H is Peter, Mark, Luke. No, that's also not the first three. 

Option E is Matthew, Mark, Luke. Again, later ones. Option J is Matthew, Peter, Luke. No, that's not right either. Option C is Peter, John, Mark. No, Peter is a later writer. Option F is Mark, Luke, Paul. That's the same as A, but maybe re-ordered? Or perhaps it's a different order. Wait, no, the order doesn't matter because the question is about which are included, not the order.

Wait, but I think the first three are Luke, John, and Paul. So option A is correct. Let me double-check. The synoptic Gospels are the first three, so A should be the right answer.
