Okay, let's tackle this logic problem. The question is about translating a statement into predicate logic. The statement is "David teaches Chris." We have to pick the correct option from A to J.

First, I need to understand what each part of the statement means in terms of predicate logic. The statement is about David (d) teaching Chris (c). So, the main predicate here is "teaches," which is Txy, where x is the one teaching, and y is the one being taught.

So, if David is teaching Chris, that should be represented as Td Chris, but in symbols, it's Tdc because Txy means x teaches y, right? So, x is David (d), y is Chris (c). So the formula would be Tdc.

Looking at the options:

A: Tdc → This seems correct.
B: Tcc → This is Chris teaching Chris, which isn't what's stated.
C: cTd → This would mean Chris teaches David, which is the opposite.
D: cTc → Chris teaching Chris, same as B.
E: dTdc → This reverses the order, meaning David teaches Chris, but written as Tcd instead of Tdc. Wait, no, Tcd would mean Chris is teaching David, which is not the case here.
F: dTc → David teaching Chris, but in reverse order, which is not correct.
G: Tcd → Chris teaches David, which is the opposite statement.
H: Tdd → David teaches David, which is not applicable.
I: dTcd → David teaches Chris, but written as Tcd, which is the reverse.
J: cTdd → Chris teaches David, which is wrong.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake with option E. Let me double-check. Option E is dTdc, which would be David teaching Chris in the correct order, but written as Tcd. Wait, no, Txy is x teaching y. So dTdc is David teaches Chris, which is correct. But option I is dTcd, which would be David teaches Chris in the reverse—so that's wrong. So option I is incorrect. So the correct option is A, which is Tdc.

The correct translation is Tdc, which corresponds to option A.
