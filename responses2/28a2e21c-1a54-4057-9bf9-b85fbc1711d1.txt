Okay, so I've got this economics question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about how a competitive firm determines its demand for labor. I remember that in microeconomics, labor supply and demand play a big role in determining the number of workers a firm hires.

The options are A through J. I need to find out which of these factors directly affects the demand for labor. Let's break it down.

First, I recall that in perfectly competitive markets, the firm is a price taker. That means it can't set its own price; it has to accept the market price. So the firm's demand for labor comes from the value it can get from hiring an additional worker. 

Thinking about the marginal product of labor (MPL), which is the additional output produced by hiring one more worker. The firm's demand for labor depends on how much this MPL contributes to the firm's profits. If the market price (P) is higher, the firm can sell more units, which would increase the value of its MPL. So, higher P should lead to a higher demand for labor.

The marginal physical product (MPL) is the key because it tells us how much extra output each additional worker contributes. So, the demand for labor (QL) is likely to be higher when the MPL is higher. But wait, how does that connect to the other factors?

Looking at the options: 

Option A says the marginal physical product and the output price. Output price would be the market price, right? So the demand for labor is influenced by both the MPL (how much each worker adds) and the price (how much each worker can sell for). That makes sense because if the price is high, even a small increase in MPL could mean a lot more profit.

Option B is about opportunity cost. That's more about why someone would choose one good over another, but for labor demand, it's about what's most profitable. So B is probably not the main factor.

Option C is the same as A, but phrased differently. It's essentially the same thing. So C is correct.

Option D says the number of employees. That's more about how many workers there are, not about why they're hired. So D is about quantity, not the demand.

Option E is profits. The firm's demand is about how many workers it needs to hire, not the profits it makes. So E is about profit, not about the determination of the number hired.

Option F: average physical product and output price. Wait, average product is output per worker. But the firm's demand for labor is about how many workers, not average output. So F doesn't seem right.

Option G: the wage and average product. Hmm, the wage is the cost of labor, but the demand for labor depends on how much each worker can add value. So G might be about the cost per worker, but not directly about the demand for labor itself. Unless wage is a factor, but the question is about the factors influencing the demand.

Option H: cost of production. That's about costs, like total expenses. But for labor, it's about how much each worker's contribution (MPL) affects the firm's profits. So H is about costs, not the demand.

Option I: cost of production and sales revenue. Wait, maybe I should think again. The total revenue is price times quantity. But the demand for labor depends on how much each worker contributes to revenue. So the correct factors are MPL and price (output price), not cost.

Option J: market share. That's about competition, not the firm's own demand for labor.

So the key factors are the marginal physical product (how much each worker can add to output) and the output price. Since the question is asking what directly determines the demand for labor, the correct answer must include both factors.

Looking back at the options, A says "the marginal (physical) product of labor and the output price." That fits. So the answer should be A.

To determine the demand for labor in a competitive firm, the key factors are the marginal physical product (MPL) and the output price. The firm's demand is influenced by how much additional output each worker contributes and the market price, as these factors directly affect the profitability of hiring additional workers.

**Answer: A: the marginal (physical) product of labor and the output price**
