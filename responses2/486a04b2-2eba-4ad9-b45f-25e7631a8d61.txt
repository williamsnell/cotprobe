Okay, I'm trying to solve this probability problem about resistors. Let's see what the question says.

So, the shipment of resistors has an average resistance of 200 ohms with a standard deviation of 5 ohms, and the resistances are normally distributed. We're supposed to find the probability that a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance under 194 ohms, but wait, the question is specifically about the probability that its resistance is greater than 188 ohms given that it's under 194. Hmm, no, wait, no, let me read again.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as: "Suppose a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance under 194 ohms. What is the probability that its resistance is greater than 188 ohms?" So, given that R < 194, what's the probability that R > 188?

Alternatively, maybe I misread. Let me parse the question again. The question states: "A shipment of resistors have an average resistance of 200 ohms with a standard deviation of 5 ohms, and the resistances are normally distributed. Suppose a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance under 194 ohms. What is the probability that its resistance is greater than 188 ohms?" 

Wait, but the way it's phrased, it's conditional probability. So, P(R > 188 | R < 194). That is, given that the resistance is under 194, what's the chance it's over 188.

So, to find this, I can use the properties of the normal distribution.

First, I should calculate the z-scores for 188 and 194.

The formula for z-score is (X - μ) / σ.

For X = 188: (188-200)/5 = (-12)/5 = -2.4.

For X = 194: (194-200)/5 = (-6)/5 = -1.2.

So, we're looking for P(R > 188 | R < 194) = P(-2.4 < Z < 1.2)? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because when you condition on R being less than 194, the sample space is all resistors with R < 194. So, within that subset, what's the probability that R is greater than 188?

Alternatively, it's the proportion of resistors between 188 and 194 ohms, but wait, no, because the condition is R < 194. So, it's the portion of the distribution between 188 and 194.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the probability that R is between 188 and 194, and then divide by the probability that R is less than 194.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF).

Let me compute P(R < 194), which is the CDF at 194, then compute P(R > 188), and then take the ratio.

Wait, no, because the condition is R < 194, so within that, what's the probability that R > 188.

So, P(R > 188 | R < 194) = P(188 < R < 194) / P(R < 194).

Because when we condition on R < 194, we're looking at the probability that R is greater than 188 and less than 194, divided by the probability that R is less than 194.

So, let me calculate each part.

First, find P(R < 194). That is the CDF at 194, which is the area to the left of 194 in the normal distribution.

Similarly, P(R > 188) is 1 minus the CDF at 188.

Wait, but let me think in terms of the standard normal variable. Let me compute the z-scores.

Z1 = (188-200)/5 = (-12)/5 = -2.4.

Z2 = (194-200)/5 = (-6)/5 = -1.2.

So, P(R < 194) is the CDF at Z = -1.2. Let me find that.

Looking up a standard normal table, the CDF at Z=-1.2 is approximately 0.8849.

Similarly, P(R > 188) is 1 - CDF at Z=-2.4. The CDF at Z=-2.4 is approximately 0.0082, so 1 - 0.0082 = 0.9918.

But wait, that's the probability that R is over 188, regardless of it being under 194.

So, the conditional probability is the ratio of [P(188 < R < 194)] to [P(R < 194)].

Alternatively, since P(R > 188 and R <194) is the same as P(188 < R <194).

Which can be found as P(R <194) - P(R <188).

So, that's 0.8849 - 0.0082 = 0.8767.

So the numerator is approximately 0.8767.

The denominator is 0.8849.

So the conditional probability is 0.8767 / 0.8849 ≈ 0.988, which is about 0.99.

So looking at the options, option G is 0.99, so the answer should be G.

To solve the problem, we calculate the conditional probability P(R > 188 | R < 194). This is the probability that a resistor's resistance is greater than 188 ohms given that it is under 194 ohms.

1. **Calculate z-scores:**
   - For R = 188: \( z_1 = (188 - 200) / 5 = -2.4 \)
   - For R = 194: \( z_2 = (194 - 200) / 5 = -1.2 \)

2. **Find probabilities using the standard normal distribution:**
   - P(R < 194): The CDF at z = -1.2 is approximately 0.8849.
   - P(R > 188): The CDF at z = -2.4 is approximately 0.0082, so P(R > 188) = 1 - 0.0082 = 0.9918.

3. **Calculate P(188 < R < 194):**
   - This is the difference between the two probabilities: 0.8849 - 0.0082 = 0.8767.

4. **Compute the conditional probability:**
   - P(R > 188 | R < 194) = P(188 < R < 194) / P(R < 194) = 0.8767 / 0.8849 ≈ 0.988, which is approximately 0.99.

Thus, the probability that the resistance is greater than 188 ohms given it is under 194 ohms is approximately 0.99.
