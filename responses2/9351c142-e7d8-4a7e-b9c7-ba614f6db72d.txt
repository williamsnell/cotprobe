Okay, so I've got this question about architectures for classifying high-resolution images. Hmm, let's see. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the best one as of 2020. I'm a bit rusty on my machine learning, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is about high-resolution images, which are probably big in size. So the model needs to be efficient enough to handle large amounts of data without getting too slow or memory-heavy.

Looking at the options, let's list them out:

A: Graph networks — I think graph-based models are good for data that's structured in nodes and edges, like social networks or molecules. But images are usually represented as grids of pixels, so maybe not the best fit here.

B: Autoencoders — These are neural networks used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They can compress data, but I'm not sure how they're best used for classification. They might work, but maybe not the top choice for high-resolution images.

C: Convolutional networks — I remember that CNNs are specifically designed for images. They use kernels to detect features and are translation-invariant, which is great for images. They also have layers that capture hierarchical features, starting from edges to more complex parts. This seems like a strong candidate.

D: Fully connected networks — These are typically used in the output layer for tasks like classification. But they have a lot of parameters and might not be efficient for high-resolution data. Plus, they might overfit if the data is small. So probably not the best choice here.

E: Long Short-Term Memory Networks — These are used for sequences, like time series data or natural language processing. They handle temporal dependencies but are not suited for image classification, which is spatial. So E is probably not the answer.

F: Support Vector Machines — SVMs are good for small datasets and can be used with kernels. But they might not scale well with high-resolution images, which can be large. Also, they don't handle high dimensionality as well as CNNs. So maybe not the top choice.

G: Deep Belief Networks — These are generative models, not discriminative. They learn to reconstruct data but aren't used for classification tasks. So G is probably not the answer.

H: RBF networks — Radial Basis Function networks are used for classification, especially with a small number of inputs. They are also used in neural networks for tasks like regression. But for high-resolution images, which are high-dimensional, RBF might not be as efficient as CNNs.

I: Recurrent Neural Networks — These are designed for sequential data, like time series, and can handle temporal dependencies. They aren't ideal for image classification since images are spatial data. So I is probably not the best option.

J: Radial Basis Function Networks — Same as H, probably not the best for image classification.

So, considering all the options, I think Convolutional Networks (C) are the best choice. They are specifically designed for image data and can handle high-resolution images efficiently in terms of both computation and memory. They are also known for their ability to capture local patterns and feature hierarchies, which is crucial for image classification tasks. The other options either don't handle the spatial data effectively, are computationally intensive, or are not suitable for the type of classification needed for high-resolution images.

Wait, but what about Autoencoders? They can be used for feature extraction and might be part of a larger network, but they might not be the primary architecture for classification tasks. So I think Convolutional Networks are more likely.

The best architecture for classifying high-resolution images is Convolutional Networks (C), as they are specifically designed to handle image data, efficiently capture features, and manage large datasets. 

Answer: C
