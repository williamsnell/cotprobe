Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about utilitarianism and its objections. Hmm, let me think about what I know. I remember that utilitarianism is about making the best possible overall good, right? So it's all about maximizing happiness or utility.

The question is asking about one of Mill's strongest objections to utilitarianism. The options are A to J, each giving a different concept. I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that Mill had several objections, but I think one of them was about the concept of "supererogation." Supererogation is when someone does an action they didn't expect to do, and they claim it's right even if it goes against what others think they should do. Like, for example, if someone commits a crime they didn't intend to, they might argue that it's right to do so because it's better than other ways to achieve the best overall outcome.

Wait, let me make sure. Mill's objections were mainly about the practicality of making decisions, the concept of 'ought' vs 'is,' and the idea that utilitarianism doesn't account for the moral value of the action itself. So supererogation is one of those, I think. He said that if you commit an act you didn't expect, it's not necessarily just because the outcome is better, but because it's a positive action, which can be seen as an 'ought.'

Looking at the options, option B is supererogation. So I think that's the answer.

The correct answer is B: supererogation. Mill's objection to utilitarianism includes the concept of supererogation, where one commits an action they didn't expect, claiming it's right even if it's against others' intentions. 

Answer: B
