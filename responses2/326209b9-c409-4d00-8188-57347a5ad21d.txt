Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the Soviet planned economy's major microeconomic problems. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Soviet planned economy was a system that aimed to manage resources efficiently, but I'm not exactly sure about all the specific issues they faced. I'll try to recall the key factors that might have contributed to the problems.

I know that during the Soviet Union's transition period, there were significant economic and social changes. The planned economy was supposed to be more efficient than the market economy because it relied on central planning. But I also remember hearing about some major issues that arose, especially during the collapse of the Soviet Union.

One of the main problems I recall is hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is a severe run-up in the value of money, often leading to economic collapse. I think this was because of high production levels, especially in industries like agriculture. The Soviet Union had huge agricultural enterprises, and that led to high demand, which in turn caused prices to skyrocket. That would make option C, which mentions hyperinflation due to overprinting of currency, a strong candidate.

Another issue I remember is that the planned economy focused too much on manufacturing and service industries rather than capital goods. I think this was because of the high investment needed in infrastructure, especially for cities. The planned economy tried to finance these investments through savings and government injection, but it led to a lack of private capital, which could be a problem. So, looking at option H, which talks about excessive focus on service industries, that might be another issue.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Option A talks about inefficiency in consumer satisfaction, physical output, quality, cost, etc. The Soviet economy was supposed to be efficient, but perhaps the emphasis on output obscuring quality led to inefficiencies. But I'm not sure if that was a primary problem.

Option B says overemphasis on consumer goods over capital goods. That sounds familiar. The planned economy tried to produce only goods that were deemed essential for the state, which might have led to a shift towards consumer goods over capital goods. That could be a valid point, but I'm not sure if that's one of the main issues.

Option D says lack of foreign trade. I don't recall that as a primary problem in the planned economy. It's more about national savings and investments, perhaps.

Option E is about enterprise complete autonomy leading to market competition. If all enterprises were free to compete, that would lead to market-driven outcomes, not planned ones. But was that a problem of the planned economy? I think the planned economy aimed to prevent that, but perhaps it did lead to some market competition as a result.

Option F is overemphasis on agricultural production. I remember this more than the planned economy's focus on manufacturing. The Soviet economy's reliance on agriculture probably led to issues with food prices and resource allocation, which could contribute to economic problems.

Option G is reliance on imported goods, leading to trade deficits. That makes sense because without a stable currency, exports might suffer, leading to import surpluses and trade deficits. This could worsen the economy.

Option H, the excessive focus on service industries, might have been a problem because the planned economy prioritized manufacturing, especially for infrastructure, which could have created a gap between manufacturing and service sectors.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between options C, F, and G. Let me think again. If hyperinflation (C) was due to overprinting, that's definitely a problem. Over emphasis on agricultural production (F) would lead to issues like food shortages, which could cause price increases. Reliance on imported goods (G) would also cause trade deficits, but I'm not sure if that's a major issue in the planned economy.

Looking back, I think hyperinflation and the shift towards consumer goods are key. So, option C and F are both possible. But I'm not certain which is the primary issue.

Another point: the planned economy tried to finance its investments with savings and government money, which could lead to a lack of private capital. That's option H, but I also think the shift towards consumer goods and over emphasis on physical output (like in option A) were issues.

Wait, the question asks about the major problems, so perhaps the primary issues are hyperinflation and the shift towards consumer goods. So, option C says hyperinflation due to overprinting of currency, which sounds correct because higher production led to higher prices. And option F is about overemphasis on agricultural production, which is also a problem.

But the options are mutually exclusive. I need to pick the best answer.

Let me see: the Soviet economy's planned system led to high production, which caused hyperinflation, which is option C. Additionally, the planned economy prioritized manufacturing over capital goods, which is option H. Or is it the over emphasis on consumer goods?

Wait, I think the main issues were hyperinflation and reliance on capital goods. So option C and H are both possible. But in the options, C is about hyperinflation, which is a big problem, while H is about service versus manufacturing.

Alternatively, another approach is to think of what the planned economy aimed to solve. The planned system tried to balance internal production with external demand, but in the process, it may have created issues like high prices (hyperinflation) and a focus on manufacturing over agriculture.

So, putting it all together: the major microeconomic problems were hyperinflation and reliance on capital goods, which probably refers to option C and H. But the options are only one correct answer.

Wait, I think the correct answer is C. Hyperinflation is a classic Soviet problem, and the shift towards consumer goods may have been another issue. Or is it the over emphasis on physical output?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of what I know about the planned economy.

The planned system was more efficient but faced issues like:

1. Hyperinflation: Excessive production led to high prices.
2. Over emphasis on consumer goods: Focused on what the state needed, not what the private market could produce.
3. Reliance on imported goods: High savings led to trade deficits.

But the question is about the primary issues.

Wait, the options are A to J, with H being excessive focus on service industries. So perhaps the answer is C: hyperinflation due to overprinting of currency.

Alternatively, another possible issue is the over emphasis on consumer goods, which is option F.

Wait, but hyperinflation is a more severe problem than agricultural overemphasis.

So, I think the correct answer is C. Hyperinflation is a major problem because of high production and overprinting.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another thought: the planned economy's shift towards manufacturing and service industries might have been a problem. Let me check my notes again.

I remember that the Soviet economy was criticized for overproducing goods, leading to hyperinflation. That's option C. Also, the planned economy focused more on manufacturing and services than on capital goods, which is H.

Wait, but the question is about microeconomic problems. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, the primary problem is hyperinflation, which is option C.

The correct answer is C: Hyperinflation due to overprinting of currency. The Soviet planned economy faced significant challenges, including hyperinflation, which resulted from high production levels and overprintings of the currency. This led to a severe decrease in the value of money, causing significant price increases and destabilizing the economy. Additionally, the planned economy's shift towards consumer goods and overemphasis on manufacturing over capital goods were also recognized as issues. However, the primary problem, hyperinflation, aligns with option C.
