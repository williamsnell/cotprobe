Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about calculating the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 0°C. Oh wait, I remember that entropy change is related to heat transfer. Let me think through this.

First, the formula I think I need is the formula for entropy change when a substance is heated reversibly. The formula is ΔS = Q_rev / T. Right, because entropy is a state function, and for a reversible process, we can use this formula.

Wait, but the problem says it's a large block of iron. Oh, that's an important point. I remember that when a substance is large enough, the process can be considered as a reversible isothermal expansion, even if it's a solid or liquid. Because the entropy change depends on the heat absorbed, not the actual process. So for a solid or liquid, the entropy change is the same as if it were an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal expansion.

Wait, no. Or is it? Hmm. Let me clarify. For a solid or liquid, when you heat it, it expands, but the entropy change is calculated using the same formula as if it were an ideal gas. Because the entropy change is a function of temperature and the heat transfer, not the material. So the formula ΔS = Q_rev / T holds for solids and liquids as well, right?

The problem states that all gases are perfect, but it doesn't specify the material. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the entropy change formula applies here.

So the given data: 25 kJ of energy is transferred as heat reversibly and isothermally. So Q_rev is positive (since heat is added to the system). The temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. Wait, but the question says to use 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. Oh wait, no. The question says all gases are perfect, and data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. But the problem here is about a block of iron, not a gas. So for the iron, which is a solid, the formula still applies.

So I'll proceed with T = 298 K. Wait, or is it 273 K? The question specifies "298.15 K unless otherwise stated." Oh, so the initial data is 298.15 K. So the temperature is 298 K.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the temperature is 0°C. So 0°C is 273.15 K. But the question says to use 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. Oh, that's confusing. Wait, the problem says 'all gases are perfect and data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated.' But for solids, the data is perhaps at a different T. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says, "data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated." So maybe the question is using 298 K for the calculation. But wait, the initial statement says 25 kJ is transferred at 0°C. So perhaps I should use the temperature in K as 273.15 K.

Wait, but the question's note says that data are 298.15 K. So perhaps for all solids, the temperature is 298 K. Or maybe the formula uses the given temperature, 273 K. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let me read the note again. "Assume that all gases are perfect and that data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated." So the note is saying that in the problem, when data is given, they're using 298.15 K. So for the iron (a solid), the temperature is 298.15 K. So the T in the formula is 298.15 K.

Wait, but wait another moment. The problem gives 25 kJ of energy as heat. So Q is positive, because heat is being added. So ΔS = Q / T.

So Q is 25 kJ. Which is 25,000 J. T is 298.15 K.

So ΔS = (25000 J) / (298.15 K) = ?

Let me compute that. 25000 divided by 298.15. Hmm.

Well, 298.15 is approximately 300. So 25000 / 300 is about 83.33. But since 298 is less than 300, the actual value is a little higher. Let me compute 25000 / 298.15.

Let me compute it step by step. 298.15 * 83 = ?

298 *80=23,840. 298 *3=894. So 23,840 +894=24,734. 298 *83 = 24,734.

Now, 298.15 *83 is 24,734 plus 0.15 *83. 0.15*83=12.45. So total 24,746.45.

So 298.15 *83.2 = ?

24,746.45 + 298.15 *0.2 = 298.15 *0.2=59.63.

So 24,746.45 +59.63= 24,806.08.

Hmm, but 24,806 is less than 25,000. So 83.2 gives 24,806.08, which is 194 J short. So 25,000-24,806.08=193.92 J.

So how much more? 193.92 J divided by 298.15 is approximately 0.65 K.

So total is 83.2 +0.65 = 83.85 K.

So approximately 83.9 J/K.

Looking at the options, option E is 85 J/K, which is close but a bit higher. The other options are lower. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation.

25000 / 298.15 = ?

I can compute 25000 ÷ 298.15.

Let me write it as 25000 / 298.15 = (25000 * 1000) / (298.15 *1000) = 25,000,000 / 298150.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use calculator-like steps.

Alternatively, 298.15 is approximately 298.15.

Let me compute 298.15 * 83.5 = ?

83.5 * 298.15:

Compute 83 *298.15 = 24,746.45 (as before), and 0.5 *298.15 = 149.075.

So 83.5 * 298.15 = 24,746.45 +149.075 = 24,895.525.

Subtract that from 25000: 25000 -24895.525 = 104.475.

So 83.5 gives 24,895.525 J.

104.475 J left. So how much more is needed? 104.475 / 298.15 ≈ 0.35 K.

So total is 83.5 +0.35=83.85 K. So approximately 83.85 J/K.

But none of the options match exactly. Wait, looking at the options:

Options are A:135, B:50, C:150, D:100, E:85, F:92, G:65, H:110, I:120, J:75.

So the computed value is approximately 83.85. The closest option is E:85, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 25,000 divided by 298.15.

Another approach: Let's compute 25,000 ÷ 298.15.

298.15 × 83 = 24,734.45 as before.

25,000 -24,734.45=265.55 J.

So 265.55 J is left. Now, 265.55 / 298.15 ≈0.892.

So total is 83.892 J/K. So approximately 83.89 J/K. So about 83.9 J/K.

Looking at the options, the closest is E)85 J/K. But some options are lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula.

Wait, is the formula ΔS = Q_rev / T correct for solids? I think yes, because entropy is a state function and the formula is derived for any process, but when the heat is transferred reversibly and isothermally, the formula applies regardless of the material. So I think the formula is correct.

Alternatively, let me think if the entropy change for a solid would be the same as if it were an ideal gas. For example, when a gas is heated, the entropy change is calculated using the same formula, even if the gas is a solid. So the formula should apply here.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the entropy change as if it's a process for solids. Another thought: the entropy change for a solid undergoing a temperature change is actually different than for a gas. But wait, no. Because for a solid, the entropy change is calculated based on the heat transfer reversibly and isothermally, just like for a gas.

So perhaps the formula is correct.

So the options don't have 83.9, but option E is 85. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the temperature used is 298 K, not 273 K. Let me try that.

If T is 298 K, then ΔS=25000 / 298.

25000 ÷298 = Let's compute.

298 ×84 = 298 ×80=23840, plus 298×4=1192 → 23840+1192=24932.

25000 -24932=68. So 68 J left.

68 /298 = approx 0.228 K.

So total ΔS=84.228 J/K ≈84.23 J/K.

Looking again, the closest option is E:85 J/K.

So that's even closer, perhaps. But option E is 85, which is higher than 84.23.

Hmm. So maybe the correct answer is E:85 J/K.

Wait, but the problem states that 0°C is 273.15 K. So why is the calculation using 298 K? Or perhaps the problem note is misleading, and the temperature is 298 K. Because the problem note says data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. So when the problem gives the temperature as 0°C, perhaps it's 298 K because that's what the note says.

Wait, the problem says, "data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated."

Ah, that's the key. So the note says when data is given, it's 298 K. So even though the problem says the temperature is 0°C (273.15 K), the note says to use 298 K. So we should use T=298 K.

So that changes things. So in that case, the calculation is 25000 / 298.

Which is approximately 84.23 J/K. So the closest option is E:85 J/K.

But wait, let me compute more accurately.

25,000 ÷298.

298 ×84 = 24,852.

25,000 -24,852=148.

148 ÷298 = approx 0.4966.

So 84.4966 → approximately 84.5 J/K.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:85 J/K.

So the answer would be E.
</think>

To calculate the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 0°C, we use the formula for entropy change:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
\]

Here:
- \( Q_{\text{rev}} = 25 \, \text{kJ} = 25,000 \, \text{J} \),
- \( T = 298.15 \, \text{K} \) (as specified in the note, even though the temperature is typically \( 273.15 \, \text{K} \) for solids).

### Step 1: Calculate the entropy change
\[
\Delta S = \frac{25,000}{298.15} \approx 83.9 \, \text{J/K}
\]

### Step 2: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated entropy change of approximately \( 83.9 \, \text{J/K} \) is closest to option **E: 85 J/K**.

### Final Answer:
ANSWER: E
