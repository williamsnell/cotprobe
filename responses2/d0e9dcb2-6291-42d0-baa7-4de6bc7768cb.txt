Okay, so I've got this question about integral domains and polynomial rings. Hmm, let's think about this step by step. 

Statement 1 says, "If a R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain." I remember that an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. So, if R is an integral domain, then R[x] should also be one. Wait, is that always true? I think so. Because when you add a polynomial to another, the leading terms can't cancel each other out if R is an integral domain. Like, if you have two non-zero polynomials, their product should also have a non-zero leading coefficient. So, yeah, R[x] should be an integral domain if R is. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2 says, "If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x)." Wait, no. The degree of the product isn't necessarily the sum of the degrees. Oh right! Because when you multiply two polynomials, the degree is the maximum of the degrees of the factors. Or wait, no, wait. Oh right, if two polynomials have degrees m and n, then their product has degree m + n. But only if their leading coefficients are non-zero. So, for example, if f(x) is x^2 and g(x) is x^2, then f(x)g(x) is x^4, which has degree 4, which is 2 + 2. But if f(x) is x^2 and g(x) is x^3, the product is x^5, which has degree 5 (2+3). So in general, if neither polynomial is zero, and their leading coefficients are non-zero, then yes, the degree is the sum. But wait, the statement doesn't specify that the leading coefficients are non-zero. So, if either f(x) or g(x) has a zero leading coefficient, then their product's degree might be less than the sum. For example, if f(x) is x^2 and g(x) is x^3 + 1, then f(x)g(x) is x^5 + x^2. The degree of the product is 5, which is less than 2+3=5 (same in this case). Wait, no, 5 equals 5. Another example: f(x)=x^2, g(x)=x^3. Then product is x^5, which is degree 5, same as 2+3. What if f(x)=x^2, g(x)=x^3 + x^1? Their product is x^5 + x^3. The leading term is x^5, so degree 5, which is 2+1=3? Wait, no, 2+3 is 5, but 2+1 is 3. Wait, no, 2 and 1 add to 3, but the product's degree is 5. So in this case, the degree of the product is higher than the sum of individual degrees. So the statement is false because it's not always equal. So Statement 2 is False.

So, putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Now I need to look at the options. The options are A to J, each pair indicating the truth values of Statement 1 and Statement 2.

Looking at the answer options:

A: True, True → No, because Statement 2 is False.

B: True, Not Applicable → Not applicable because both are either True or False.

C: True, False → This matches our conclusion.

D: False, Not Applicable → No, both can't be false.

E: False, True → No, because Statement 2 is false.

F: Not Applicable, False → No, because Statement 1 is True.

G: Not Applicable, True → No.

H: Not Applicable, Not Applicable → No.

I: False, False → No.

J: Not Applicable, Not Applicable → No.

Wait, wait, the options are A to J, with each option being a pair of two options, each indicating the truth of the statements. So, for example, option C is "True, False" which correctly corresponds to our analysis.

So the correct answer should be option C: True, False.

The analysis indicates both statements are evaluated as follows: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Therefore, the correct option is C: True, False.

ANSWER: C
