Okay, so I've got this question about Earth's internal energy sources. Hmm, I remember from school that Earth's core is really hot, but what's the primary source of that energy? Let me think. Oh right, the Earth's core is rich in certain types of heat because it's formed from the decay of radioactive elements. So I think thermal conduction is a key here. Wait, thermal conduction is when heat moves through a material, like heat from the core passing through the crust. So that makes sense because the core is hot and the crust is cooler, so heat is transferred that way. 

Wait, but are there other sources? Like, I remember tidal friction causing the moon's crust to heat up. That's another source, but the question is about the principal source. Solar radiation—oh right, the sun's radiation is a big component, but that's not the main source. Electric currents? That's more like what happens in power grids, not geothermal. Wind energy? No, that's from the Earth's atmosphere. Magnetic fields? Those are from the core itself, but not the source of the energy. Gravitational pressure? That's related, but not the primary source of internal energy. Hydroelectric power? That's a form of electricity, not energy itself. 

So the main thing is the radioactive decay of elements in the core, which produces thermal energy. So the correct answer should be H: geothermal heat.

The principal source of Earth’s internal energy is the radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core, which produces thermal energy. This is known as geothermal heat. 

Answer: H
