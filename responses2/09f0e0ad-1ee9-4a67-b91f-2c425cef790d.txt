Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating interest for three loans from different banks. Hmm, let me see. I remember that interest can be simple or compound, but the question doesn't specify. Wait, the question says "each of them have to pay," but it doesn't mention compounding. So I think it's simple interest for each case. Got it.

First, let's look at each loan one by one. I'll need to calculate the interest for each separately and then see which option matches. The question gives four options, but actually, there are ten possible options, but the correct one is among the choices A to J. Wait, no, the options are A to I, but the correct answer is among them. Let me think.

The problem is about simple interest. The formula is I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate (as a decimal), and T is time in years.

Let's tackle each loan:

1. Ms. Atlas: $1,800 at 6% for 60 days.

Wait, the time is in days, so I need to convert 60 days to years. 60 days is a little over a month, so about 60/365. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 365 is approximately 0.1644 years.

So the interest here would be 1800 * 0.06 * 0.1644. Let me compute that. 1800 * 0.06 is 108, then 108 * 0.1644. Let me see, 0.1644 times 100 is 16.44, so 108 times 0.1644 is about 17.8392. So approximately $17.84. Wait, but looking at the options, some have $360, $1820, $18, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, no, because 60 days is more than a month, but the rate is 6%, so maybe the calculation is different.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in simple interest, if the period is less than a year, but they might consider the time as exact days. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes 360 days a year for interest calculation. Oh! That makes sense. I think in some financial calculations, especially for loans, the day count is 360 days a year, so you calculate the interest based on 360 days per year.

So in that case, the time would be 60/360 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 years.

Then, interest would be 1800 * 0.06 * (60/360) → 1800 * 0.06 = 108, times (1/6) is 18. So I = $18.00. So Ms. Atlas's interest is $18.00.

Wait, looking at the options, option I says Ms. Atlas pays $18, which matches. So option I is for Ms. Atlas: $18.

Wait, but other options don't have $18 for her. Let me check all the options:

Looking at the options, option I is A: Ms. Atlas: $18, Mr. Johnson: $360, Mr. Breakman: $1,820. Wait, no, the options are presented as options A-J, and each of them is a separate option. Wait, perhaps I should list each option's numbers.

Wait, the options are:

A: Ms. Atlas: $360, Mr. Johnson: $1,820, Mr. Breakman: $18.

B: $21, $420, $2,310.

C: $45, $300, $1,610.

D: $1,820, $18, $360.

E: $1,800, $2,400, $7,000.

F: $30, $720, $1,540.

G: $54, $120, $2,100.

H: $108, $480, $4,200.

I: $18, $360, $1,820.

J: $15, $600, $1,960.

Wait, so for Ms. Atlas, the correct interest is $18, which is option I's first number. So the correct option is I for Ms. Atlas.

Now, let's check Mr. Johnson: $2,400 at 5% for 3 years.

Again, using 360 days in a year, so time is 3 years, which is 3*360=1080 days. But the formula uses time in years, so 3 years is 3. So it's 3 years. So interest is 2400 * 0.05 * 3 = 2400 * 0.15 = $360. So Mr. Johnson’s interest is $360. Looking at the options, option I's second number is 360. So option I's second number is correct.

Finally, Mr. Breakman: $7,000 at 6.5% for 4 years. So 6.5% is 0.065. Time is 4 years, so 4 years. Interest: 7000 * 0.065 *4 = 7000 * 0.26 = $1,820. So his interest is $1,820. Looking at the options, option I's third number is 1820. So option I's third number is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is the only one that has all three numbers matching. So the correct answer is option I: Ms. Atlas: $18, Mr. Johnson: $360, Mr. Breakman: $1820.
</think>

The correct answer is option I, where each bank's interest is calculated using simple interest (360 days/year) and the rates and periods provided. 

- **Ms. Atlas**: $1,800 at 6% for 60 days → Interest = $18.  
- **Mr. Johnson**: $2,400 at 5% for 3 years → Interest = $360.  
- **Mr. Breakman**: $7,000 at 6.5% for 4 years → Interest = $1,820.

Thus, the correct choice is **I: Ms. Atlas: $18, Mr. Johnson: $360, Mr. Breakman: $1,820**.
