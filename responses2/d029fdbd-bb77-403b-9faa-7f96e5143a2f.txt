Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a charged nonconducting rod. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the number of excess electrons on the rod. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the rod has a length of 2.00 meters. The cross-sectional area is 4.00 cm². Oh wait, I should probably convert that to square meters. Because the volume charge density is in μC/m³, right?

Wait, the area is 4.00 cm². Let me think, 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 0.0001 m². Oh wait, wait, wait. No, wait, 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 0.0001 m². So 4.00 cm² is 4.00 * 0.0001 m², which is 0.0004 m², right?

Wait, no. Wait, 4 cm² is 4 * (1cm)^2. Oh yeah, 1 cm is 0.01 m, so (0.01)^2 is 0.0001 m². So 4 cm² is 4 * 0.0001 = 0.0004 m². Got it.

The rod's length is 2.00 m. So the volume of the rod would be the cross-sectional area multiplied by length. So volume V is 0.0004 m² * 2.00 m = 0.0008 m³. Wait, 0.0004 *2 is 0.0008. Yeah.

The volume charge density rho is given as -4.00 μC/m³. Oh wait, μ is 1e-6, so that's -4e-6 C/m³.

So the total charge Q on the rod is charge density multiplied by volume. So Q = rho * V.

Calculating that: rho is -4e-6 C/m³, V is 0.0008 m³. So Q = (-4e-6) * 0.0008. Let me compute that. 4e-6 times 0.0008 is 3.2e-9? Wait, no, 0.0008 is 8e-4. So 4e-6 * 8e-4 = 32e-10 = 3.2e-9. But with the negative sign, so Q is -3.2e-9 C.

Wait, but wait, the question is about excess electrons. So I need to find how many electrons make up the charge Q. Each electron has a charge of -e, where e is about 1.6e-19 C. So the number of electrons n is |Q| / e.

So |Q| is 3.2e-9 C.

So n = (3.2e-9 C) / (1.6e-19 C/electron) = 2e10 electrons.

Wait, let me compute that. 3.2e-9 divided by 1.6e-19. So 3.2 / 1.6 is 2. Then exponent is -9 - (-19) = +10. So 2e10 electrons. So that's 2 x 10^10 electrons.

Looking at the options, option H is 2.00 x 10^10 electrons. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me recompute.

Volume: 4 cm² = 4 * (1 cm)^2 = 4 * (0.01 m)^2 = 4 * 0.0001 = 0.0004 m². Length 2 m. So V = 0.0004 *2 = 0.0008 m³.

Charge Q = rho * V. rho is -4e-6 C/m³. So:

Q = (-4e-6) * 0.0008 = (-4e-6) * 8e-4 = (-32e-10) C = -3.2e-9 C.

Number of electrons: |Q| / e = 3.2e-9 / 1.6e-19 = (3.2/1.6) * (1e-9 / 1e-19) = 2 * 1e10 → 2e10. So 2 x10^10 electrons.

Looking back at the options, H is 2.00 x10^10 electrons. So I think that's the right answer.

To determine the number of excess electrons on the charged nonconducting rod, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert the cross-sectional area to square meters**:  
   The cross-sectional area is given as \(4.00 \, \text{cm}^2\). Since \(1 \, \text{cm}^2 = (0.01 \, \text{m})^2 = 0.0001 \, \text{m}^2\), the area in square meters is:  
   \[
   A = 4.00 \times 0.0001 = 0.0004 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

2. **Calculate the volume of the rod**:  
   The length of the rod is \(2.00 \, \text{m}\). The volume \(V\) is given by:  
   \[
   V = A \times \text{length} = 0.0004 \times 2.00 = 0.0008 \, \text{m}^3.
   \]

3. **Determine the total charge on the rod**:  
   The volume charge density is \(\rho = -4.00 \, \mu\text{C}/\text{m}^3 = -4.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}/\text{m}^3\). The total charge \(Q\) is:  
   \[
   Q = \rho \times V = (-4.00 \times 10^{-6}) \times 0.0008 = -3.2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of excess electrons**:  
   Each electron has a charge of \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\). The number of electrons \(n\) is:  
   \[
   n = \frac{|Q|}{e} = \frac{3.2 \times 10^{-9}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.00 \times 10^{10}.
   \]

5. **Select the correct option**:  
   From the given options, the number of excess electrons is \(2.00 \times 10^{10}\), which corresponds to option **H**.
