Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to kinetics, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question says that compound A reacts with B in a one-step reaction to give C. The rate constant is 2.0 × 10^-3 M^-1 sec^-1. Then they give the initial amounts of A and B, and the volume of the container. The question is asking about the initial rate of the reaction.

Wait, right, the rate law for a reaction is generally rate = k [A]^m [B]^n. Here, since it's a one-step reaction, they probably assume the rate is based on the concentrations of A and B. But the problem doesn't specify the orders, so I think maybe I can infer from the question that the reaction is first-order in each reactant.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the stoichiometry. Oh, wait, unless the stoichiometry affects the rate law. But in a one-step reaction, the rate is overall first-order in the reactants, so the rate would depend on the concentrations of A and B to the first power each. Or maybe not; sometimes, if the reaction is a combination of steps, the rate might depend on the rate-determining step, which could be something else.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the stoichiometric coefficients, so I might have to make an assumption here. Maybe since it's a one-step reaction, the rate law is first-order in each reactant. So the rate is k [A][B].

But wait, wait! Let's think again. The rate constant is given as 2.0e-3 M^-1 sec^-1. But when calculating the rate, the units would be M/sec because rate is concentration per time. So for the rate, [A] and [B] would have units of M each, so their product would be M². Multiply by 2e-3 M^-1 sec^-1, so the units would be (M²) * (M^-1 s^-1) )= M/(s), which is correct for a rate. So that makes sense.

But wait, the question is about the initial rate. The initial concentrations of A and B are given as 0.50 mole and 0.30 mole in a 0.50 liter box. Wait a second, units matter here. The concentrations would be moles divided by liters. So 0.50 moles of A in 0.50 L is 1.0 M. Similarly, 0.30 moles of B in 0.50 L is 0.60 M.

So, [A] is 1.0 M, [B] is 0.60 M. The rate constant is 2.0e-3 M^-1 sec^-1.

Putting it all together: rate = k [A][B] = (2.0e-3) * (1.0) * (0.60) M^-1 * M. The M^-1 and M would cancel, leaving M/sec.

Wait, but wait: 1.0 * 0.60 is 0.6. 2e-3 * 0.6 is 1.2e-3, but wait, no: 2e-3 * 0.6 is 1.2e-3? Let me compute: 2e-3 is 0.002. 0.002 * 0.6 = 0.0012. Which is 1.2e-3.

So the rate is 1.2e-3 M/sec. Looking at the options, option C is 0.40 × 10^-3, which is 4e-4, which is 0.0004. Option F is 1e-3, which is 0.001. Wait, wait, no: option F is 1.00e-3, which is 0.001. Option H is 1.8e-3, which is 0.0018. Option G is 1.2e-3, which is 0.0012. So the computed rate is 1.2e-3. But wait, did I calculate correctly?

Wait, let me recheck. The rate is (2.0e-3) * 1.0 * 0.6 = 2e-3 * 0.6 = 1.2e-3. So the rate is 1.2e-3 M/s, which is 0.0012 M/s. Looking at the options, option G is 1.20×10^-3 M/sec, which is 0.0012 M/s. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but wait, is that all? Because the reaction is one-step, but if the stoichiometry (like the ratio of A to B) affects the rate law. Oh wait, no, the rate law for a reaction is determined by the rate-determining step, which for a one-step reaction is probably first-order in each reactant. So the calculation I did is correct.

But hold on, another approach: sometimes, the rate law can involve the ratio of the concentrations. For example, if the reaction is A + B → C, and the rate is first order in each, then rate = k [A][B]. But if the reaction is 2A + B → C, then it's rate = k [A]^2 [B].

But the problem doesn't specify the stoichiometric coefficients, so I can't assume that. So for the given problem, I think the correct approach is to take the rate as k [A][B].

So with [A] = 0.50 / 0.50 = 1.0 M. [B]=0.30 /0.50 = 0.6 M. So rate = 2e-3 * 1 * 0.6 = 1.2e-3 M/s. So option G is 1.20e-3, which is exactly that. So the correct answer is G.

To determine the initial rate of the reaction, we use the rate law for the reaction, which is assumed to be first-order in both reactants A and B: 

\[
\text{rate} = k [A][B]
\]

The rate constant \( k \) is given as \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}^{-1} \text{sec}^{-1} \). The initial concentrations of A and B are calculated from the given moles and volume:

\[
[A] = \frac{0.50 \, \text{mol}}{0.50 \, \text{L}} = 1.0 \, \text{M}, \quad [B] = \frac{0.30 \, \text{mol}}{0.50 \, \text{L}} = 0.60 \, \text{M}.
\]

Substituting these values into the rate law:

\[
\text{rate} = (2.0 \times 10^{-3}) \times (1.0) \times (0.60) = 1.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M/sec}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is **G: 1.20 × 10⁻³ M/sec**.
