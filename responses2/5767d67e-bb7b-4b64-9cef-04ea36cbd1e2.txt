Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm, it's about a spaceship orbiting Mars and a missile fired by Martians. I need to find the minimum velocity the missile must leave the surface with to successfully destroy the intruder. Alright, let's break this down.

The spaceship is in a circular orbit 22,000 km above Mars' surface. And it's rotating at the same speed as Mars, so it stays above the same point. Oh wait, so the orbital velocity of the spaceship must be the same as Mars's rotational speed. Interesting. So the spaceship's orbital radius is 22,000 km plus the radius of Mars. Mars' radius is 3400 km, so the orbit radius is 25400 km.

Wait, wait. The question is about the missile fired vertically upward from the spot beneath the spaceship. So the missile's speed when it leaves the Martian surface is what we need to find. The minimum velocity needed for the missile to escape (or not just escape, but perhaps just reach the surface again) or to reach the point where it can hit the spaceship. Wait, no, wait. So the problem is about whether the missile can reach the spaceship again. So in other words, the missile is fired from the point below the spaceship, and needs to reach the spaceship again. So the missile's velocity when it leaves the surface must be such that, after being launched upwards, it can reach the point where the spaceship is.

Wait, but the spaceship is in orbit. So when the missile is fired, it's going to orbit Mars as well, but perhaps at a different speed. Wait, no. Because if the spaceship and the missile are both in orbit, but the missile is fired vertically. Oh, but wait, the spaceship's orbital velocity is the same as Mars's rotation speed. So the spaceship is moving at the same speed as Mars's rotation. So if the missile is fired upwards, it's moving in the same direction as Mars's surface rotation, but perhaps at a higher speed. Wait, no, wait. The problem says the spaceship is in a circular orbit at the same speed as Mars. So the orbital speed of the spaceship is equal to Mars's rotational speed. So when the spaceship is directly above the spot where the missile is fired, the missile is at the same point. So the missile's initial velocity is vertical, and it's moving upwards with some speed. But wait, when it's fired, it's going to have some speed, and it's subject to Mars' gravity. So the missile's trajectory will be a projectile motion under Mars' gravity.

But the key is that the missile needs to reach the same point in the orbit. So the missile is fired from the surface at point A (the spot under the spaceship). It's going to orbit Mars, but perhaps at a higher altitude. Wait, but the question is about whether the missile can reach the spaceship again. So the missile's path must intersect with the spaceship's orbit.

Wait, but the spaceship is in a circular orbit, same as Mars's rotation. So the spaceship's orbital speed is the same as Mars's rotation speed. So when the missile is fired, it's going to have some speed, and the question is: what's the minimum speed needed for the missile to reach the spot where the spaceship is again. So, the missile's speed must be sufficient to reach the same point as the spaceship after some time.

Alternatively, perhaps the missile has to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit. So the missile's initial velocity when it leaves the surface must be such that, under Mars' gravity, it reaches the point where the spaceship is again in orbit. So the missile's velocity must not only be enough to reach that spot, but also to have sufficient velocity to stay in orbit.

Wait, but the spaceship is already in orbit. So the missile is fired from the surface at the same spot as the spaceship. The missile will go up, and its trajectory will be a projectile. The point where the spaceship is again in orbit is at the same distance as Mars' surface. So perhaps the missile's velocity needs to be such that it reaches that point, but also, considering the orbital mechanics, it's probably being launched at just the right angle. Wait, but if the missile is fired straight up, it won't have any sideways velocity. But in reality, the spaceship is moving with the same speed as Mars's rotation, so when the missile is fired, the question is whether it can reach the same position at the same time.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the missile must have a speed that allows it to reach the same point as the spaceship after some time. But the spaceship is already in orbit. So let's think about the missile's trajectory.

Wait, the spaceship's orbital speed is v_orb = sqrt(G*M / r_orb), where r_orb is the orbital radius. But the problem is, the spaceship is in orbit at 22,000 km above Mars' surface, which is 22,000 +3400 =25400 km. So the orbital radius is 25400 km.

Wait, but the key point here is that the spaceship is in a circular orbit at the same speed as Mars, so the orbital speed is the same as Mars' rotation speed. So, the orbital velocity of the spaceship (v_orb) is equal to the angular velocity times the radius, which is same as the rotational speed.

Now, for the missile: it's fired vertically upward from the surface. So let's think about the missile's velocity when it leaves the surface. Let's denote the speed as v. The missile's trajectory is a vertical projectile under Mars' gravity. So the missile's speed when it leaves the surface is v, and it's moving upwards. The question is: what's the minimum value of v such that the missile reaches the position where the spaceship is again in orbit.

Wait, but the spaceship is in orbit. So the missile must reach the same point on the surface as the spaceship's position when it's in orbit. But the spaceship is moving along with Mars, so when the missile is fired, it's going to be at a certain point. The missile's path must reach that point again.

Wait, perhaps the missile's speed must be such that, when it reaches the maximum height, it lands at the same point where the spaceship is again in orbit. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the missile's velocity must be sufficient to reach the spaceship's position again after some time, considering the orbital period.

Alternatively, perhaps the missile's speed must be such that, when it reaches the point where the spaceship is again in orbit, it's moving with the same speed as the spaceship, which would allow it to stay above the same spot. But wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because the spaceship is in orbit, so it's moving with the same velocity as Mars. So if the missile is fired with that speed, it will reach the same point again. But wait, the missile is moving straight up, so it would reach the surface again at the same spot as the spaceship. So in that case, the missile's speed would be exactly the orbital speed, which is the same as Mars' rotation speed. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If the missile is fired upwards with orbital speed, but actually, the orbital speed is about moving along the orbit. But the spaceship is also moving with the rotation. So if the missile's speed is the same as the orbital speed, it would be going in the same direction as the spaceship, thus moving along with it. But if the missile's speed is higher than the orbital speed, it would go further out. But if the speed is lower, it would fall back down. So to reach the same point, the missile's speed must be exactly the orbital speed â€” but then the missile would just follow the same orbit, and the spaceship is already following the same orbit. So perhaps the missile is moving in the same orbit as the spaceship. So the missile's speed is the same as the orbital speed. So the minimum velocity needed is the orbital speed. But wait, no. Because the orbital speed is about the distance from Mars' center. So the orbital velocity is v_orb = sqrt( (G*M) / r ). So r is the orbital radius, which is 25,400 km.

Wait, but the problem is that the spaceship is moving in orbit, but the missile is being launched from the surface. So the question is what speed does the missile need to have so that it can reach the position where the spaceship is again in orbit. So perhaps this requires that the missile's speed is higher than the orbital speed, because it's being launched from the surface. Wait, but if it's launched at orbital speed, then it would just follow the same orbit. If it's launched faster, it would escape or go higher. If it's launched slower, it would fall back.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum velocity. So the missile's speed must be just enough to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit, but perhaps at the same time as the spaceship's orbital period. Hmm, this is getting a bit complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the missile needs to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit. So the missile is fired from the surface, and it must reach the same point where the spaceship is again in orbit. So the missile's path must reach that point.

Wait, but the spaceship is in orbit, so the missile must reach the same point as the spaceship. So the missile's launch velocity must be such that, under Mars' gravity, it arrives at the same spot as the spaceship after some time. But wait, the spaceship is moving with the same velocity as Mars, so the missile needs to reach that spot when the spaceship is again in orbit.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's compute the orbital velocity of Mars, because that's part of the problem. The mean density of Mars is 4120 kg/mÂ³. The radius is 3400 km, which is 3.4e6 meters.

The orbital velocity v_orb is given by sqrt( (G*M) / r ), where M is the mass of Mars, and r is the orbital radius.

Wait, but to find v_orb, we can use the formula v_orb = sqrt( (G*M) / r ). We can compute M using density.

Density rho = M/( (4/3) pi r^3 )

So M = (4/3) pi r^3 rho.

So M = (4/3) * pi * (3400e3 m)^3 * 4120 kg/mÂ³.

But alternatively, perhaps using the formula for orbital velocity in terms of density and radius.

Wait, another formula: v_orb = sqrt( (G*M) / r ) = sqrt( (G * (4/3 pi R^3 rho )) / R ) = sqrt( (4/3 pi G rho R^2 ) )

So v_orb = sqrt( (4/3) * pi * G * rho * R^2 )

Wait, let me compute that.

G is 6.674e-11 mÂ³ kg^-1 s^-2.

R is 3.4e6 m.

rho is 4120 kg/mÂ³.

So compute inside the sqrt:

(4/3) * pi * 6.674e-11 * 4120 * (3.4e6)^2.

Calculate step by step.

First, (3.4e6)^2 = (3.4)^2 * 1e12 = 11.56e12 = 1.156e13 mÂ².

Then 4/3 * pi â‰ˆ (4/3)*3.1416 â‰ˆ 4.1888.

So 4.1888 * 6.674e-11 â‰ˆ 2.795e-10.

Multiply by 4120: 2.795e-10 * 4120 â‰ˆ 1.152e-6.

Multiply by 1.156e13: 1.152e-6 * 1.156e13 â‰ˆ 1.332e7.

Take the square root: sqrt(1.332e7) â‰ˆ 3650 m/s.

Wait, 3650 m/s is about 3.65 km/s. But that's the orbital speed.

Wait, but the spaceship's orbital speed is the same as Mars' rotation speed. So the spaceship is moving at 3.65 km/s. The problem is about the missile being fired vertically. So if the missile's speed is exactly 3.65 km/s, it would orbit Mars in the same way as the spaceship. But wait, the spaceship is already in orbit, so perhaps the missile's speed must be just enough to reach the spaceship's orbit.

Wait, another approach: the missile is fired from the surface, so its initial velocity must be such that, when it reaches the point where Mars' surface is at the same latitude as the spaceship's position, it will have a velocity that matches the spaceship's orbital speed.

Wait, but the spaceship is moving with the same speed as Mars's rotation. So the missile's speed when it reaches that point must be equal to the spaceship's speed, which is 3.65 km/s. But wait, the missile is moving vertically. So its speed when it reaches the point is 3.65 km/s.

Wait, but let me think again. The missile is being fired from the Martian surface, so it's at rest relative to the surface. The surface is rotating with the same speed as Mars. So when the missile is fired vertically, it will follow a projectile path under Mars' gravity. The missile's initial velocity is vertical, which is in the same direction as Mars' rotation.

Wait, the key point is that the missile's speed when it reaches the point where the spaceship is again in orbit must equal the spaceship's orbital speed (3.65 km/s). Because, if the missile's speed is higher, it would escape, and if it's lower, it wouldn't reach the same spot.

Wait, but if the missile's speed is exactly the orbital speed, it would follow a circular orbit. But since the spaceship is already in a circular orbit, this would mean the missile stays in the same orbit. So the missile would orbit Mars as the spaceship, so it's not going to hit the spaceship again because it's moving with the same speed. Hmm, but that's not what the problem says. The problem says the missile is fired directly beneath the spaceship, so it's aimed at the same point. So if the missile's speed is the same as the spaceship's orbital speed, it will follow the same orbit, and thus never reach the spaceship again. So that's not the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the missile's speed needs to be higher than the orbital speed to reach the same spot again. Wait, no, because if the missile is launched with a higher speed, it would escape or go further out. Wait, but the problem is about the minimum velocity. So perhaps the minimum velocity is the orbital speed, but that would only reach the same orbit. So this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should think about the missile's trajectory as a projectile. The missile is fired vertically upward, so its initial speed is V. The key factor is that, for the missile to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit, it must reach that point at the same time as the spaceship. Wait, but if the spaceship is moving with the same speed as Mars' rotation, then perhaps in the time it takes the missile to reach the point where the spaceship is, the spaceship has moved a certain distance.

Wait, perhaps the missile needs to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit (so same latitude) at the same time as the spaceship's orbital period. Or maybe the missile's speed has to match Mars' rotation speed at that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the missile's speed must be sufficient to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit (same as the surface) at the same time as the spaceship's orbital period. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: think about the escape velocity and the orbital speed. The escape velocity is higher than the orbital speed. The orbital speed is about 3.65 km/s. The escape velocity is sqrt(2) times the orbital speed, approximately 5.1 km/s.

But the question is about the velocity required for the missile to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit. So perhaps the missile's velocity must be the escape velocity, so it can escape and reach the same spot again. But that can't be right because the spaceship is in orbit, and the problem says the missile is fired at the same spot as the spaceship, so escaping would mean it would go further away, but the spaceship is also moving. Wait, but the problem is about the missile reaching the spaceship again. So perhaps the missile's velocity must be just enough to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit, which is at the same radius as Mars' surface.

Wait, but if the missile is fired straight up, it will reach a certain height, but it's going to land back on the surface at the same spot as the spaceship, but that doesn't make sense because the spaceship is moving with the same speed. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the missile's velocity must be such that, when it reaches the point where the spaceship is again in orbit, its speed is equal to the spaceship's orbital speed. Because if the missile's speed is higher than that, it would escape, and if it's lower, it wouldn't reach the same point.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum velocity needed. So the missile needs to have velocity V such that, when it reaches the same point as the spaceship, it's moving with the same speed as the spaceship. So the missile's speed upon reaching that point must be equal to the spaceship's orbital speed.

So the missile must reach that point at a speed equal to 3.65 km/s.

But the missile is fired vertically upward with speed V. So when it reaches the point where the spaceship is again in orbit, its speed is 3.65 km/s. So the missile's initial speed must be such that it reaches this point in time, and the speed at that point is 3.65 km/s.

Wait, but the time it takes for the missile to reach that point can be found by considering the vertical motion. The missile's vertical motion is under Mars' gravitational acceleration, which is g = G*M / r^2.

Wait, but the problem is probably more about the energy required. Because the missile must have enough kinetic energy to reach the point where the spaceship is again in orbit.

Hmm, perhaps the missile's speed must be such that the kinetic energy it has when it reaches the point equals the potential energy difference from the surface to that point. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the escape velocity from the surface of Mars, because the problem is about the minimum velocity needed for the missile to reach the same spot again. Wait, but the escape velocity is about 5.1 km/s, which is higher than the orbital speed.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum velocity required for the missile to reach the spaceship again. So perhaps the minimum velocity is the escape velocity, because the missile needs to have enough kinetic energy to escape Mars' gravity and reach the same spot again.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the spaceship is in orbit, and the missile is being fired from the surface. So the missile would need to have a speed of at least the escape velocity to reach the same spot again, but that doesn't seem right because the spaceship is already in orbit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the missile's trajectory. It's fired straight up with speed V. It will take a certain time to reach the highest point, then come back down. But the time it takes to reach that point is when the missile is at the same altitude as the spaceship's position. So the time it takes for the missile to reach that point is the time it takes for the spaceship to orbit once, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the missile's speed must be such that, when it reaches the point where the spaceship is again in orbit, it has enough velocity to stay in orbit.

Wait, but that would require that the missile's speed equals the orbital speed. So the missile's speed when it reaches the point is 3.65 km/s. So the missile's initial speed is 3.65 km/s, but then the problem is, the spaceship is already in orbit. So if the missile's speed is 3.65 km/s, it would orbit at that speed, so it would not reach the spaceship again. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the missile's speed must be higher than the orbital speed so that it can reach the same point again. Because if it's launched at the same speed as the orbital speed, it would follow the same orbit, but if it's launched faster, it would go further out. But if the missile's speed is slower than the orbital speed, it would fall back to the surface. So perhaps the missile's speed must be higher than the orbital speed so that it can reach the same point again. But that doesn't make sense, because if the missile is launched at a higher speed, it will reach the same altitude as the spaceship's orbit. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the escape velocity from the surface of Mars, because the problem is about the minimum velocity needed for the missile to escape and reach the same spot again. The escape velocity is about 5.1 km/s, so that's option F.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the spaceship is in a circular orbit, so the question is about the missile's velocity to reach the same point again. So the missile's velocity must be equal to the escape velocity, otherwise, it would not reach the same spot again. So the minimum velocity is the escape velocity, which is about 5.1 km/s. Looking back at the options, that's option F.

Wait, but let's think again. The escape velocity is the speed needed to break free from Mars' gravity. So if the missile's speed is exactly the escape velocity, it will escape to infinity. If it's higher, it will escape to infinity as well. If it's lower than escape velocity, it will fall back to the surface.

But the question is about the missile reaching the spaceship again, which is moving along with Mars. So the missile must have sufficient speed to reach the same point as the spaceship again. The escape velocity is the speed required to do that, so the minimum velocity is the escape velocity.

So the answer should be F: 5.1 km/s.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1.3 km/s

B) 2.4 km/s

C) 3.4 km/s

D) 4.4 km/s

E) 5.0 km/s

F) 6.0 km/s

G) 7.0 km/s

H) 8.0 km/s

I) 9.0 km/s

J) 10.0 km/s

K) 11.0 km/s

Wait, so the escape velocity is about 5.1 km/s, which is option E.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

To determine the minimum velocity required for the missile to reach the spaceship again, we analyze the scenario as follows:

1. **Orbital Velocity of Mars**: The orbital velocity of Mars is approximately **3.65 km/s**, calculated using the formula \( v_{\text{orb}} = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of Mars, and \( r \) is the orbital radius.

2. **Escape Velocity**: The escape velocity from Mars is approximately **5.1 km/s**. This is the minimum speed required for an object to break free from Mars' gravitational pull and escape to infinity.

3. ** missiles' Trajectory**: The missile is fired vertically upward from the surface of Mars with an initial velocity \( V \). For the missile to reach the spaceship again (which is in a circular orbit), it must have sufficient speed to escape Mars' gravity. If the missile's speed is equal to the escape velocity, it will break free to infinity. If it is higher, it will escape further. However, if it is lower, it will fall back to the surface.

4. **Minimum Velocity Requirement**: Since the spaceship is in a circular orbit, the missile must have the same orbital speed as the spaceship to remain in the same orbit. However, the problem specifies that the missile is fired directly beneath the spaceship, aiming to reach the same spot again. For the missile to reach the spaceship again, it must have a speed greater than the orbital speed to escape and reach the same point as the spaceship.

5. **Conclusion**: The escape velocity is the minimum speed required for the missile to break free from Mars' gravity and reach the spaceship again. Therefore, the minimum velocity required is approximately **5.1 km/s**.
