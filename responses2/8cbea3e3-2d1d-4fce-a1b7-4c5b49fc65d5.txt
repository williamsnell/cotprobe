Okay, so I have this problem about Brownian motion and covariance. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the covariance between X(s) and X(t), where X(t) is defined as the exponential of a Brownian motion W(t). The time points are s = 1/2 and t =1.

Wait, Brownian motion W(t) is a standard Brownian motion, right? So it's a continuous-time Gaussian process with W(0) = 0. And the covariance between two Brownian motions at times s and t is min(s,t), I think. Oh wait, but here we're dealing with X(t) = exp(W(t)), which is a log-normal process. So it's a bit different than standard Brownian motion.

I remember that for log-normal variables, if I have two random variables like X = exp(W(t)) and Y = exp(W(s)), then the covariance between X and Y is E[X Y] - E[X] E[Y]. So I need to compute E[X Y], E[X], and E[Y], then subtract the product.

So let's write down what's given. s is 1/2 and t is 1. So X(s) = exp(W(1/2)) and X(t) = exp(W(1)). The covariance is E[X(s) X(t)] - E[X(s)] E[X(t)].

Wait, but I need to compute E[X(s) X(t)]. Since X(t) and X(s) are both exponentials of Brownian motions, maybe I can find their correlation.

Wait, the covariance between X(t) and X(s) is E[X(t) X(s)] - E[X(t)] E[X(s)].

But X(t) = exp(W(t)), X(s) = exp(W(s)). Let me see, since W(t) is a Brownian motion, W(t) = W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)), and the increments are independent. So W(t) - W(s) is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance t - s.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute E[X(t) X(s)] by expressing it in terms of W(t) and W(s). Let's see:

E[X(t) X(s)] = E[exp(W(t)) exp(W(s))] = E[exp(W(t) + W(s))].

Since W(t) and W(s) are jointly normal, their sum is also normal. So W(t) + W(s) is a normal variable with mean (W(s) + W(s)) = 2 W(s)? Wait no, wait, W(t) is W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)). So W(t) + W(s) = W(s) + W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)) )? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight: W(t) = W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)), right? So W(t) + W(s) = 2 W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)). But no, that's not correct because W(t) - W(s) is independent of W(s), but I think the sum is W(s) + W(t) = W(s) + [W(s) + (W(t)-W(s))] = 2 W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should think of W(t) as W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)). So W(t) + W(s) = [W(s) + (W(t)-W(s))] + W(s) = 2 W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)).

Wait, but W(t) - W(s) is independent of W(s). So the sum is W(s) + W(t) = W(s) + [W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)))] = 2 W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)). So the expectation of exp(W(t) + W(s)) is E[exp(2 W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)))].

But since W(t) - W(s) is independent of W(s), because Brownian motion has independent increments, the expectation can be factored into E[exp(2 W(s)) ] * E[exp(W(t) - W(s)) ].

Because the exponents are additive, and the two terms are independent. So E[exp(2 W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)))] = E[exp(2 W(s))] * E[exp(W(t)-W(s))], since they are independent.

So, let me compute each part. The first part is E[exp(2 W(s))]. Since W(s) is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance s. Let me denote W(s) ~ N(0, s). Then 2 W(s) has mean 0 (since 2 * 0) and variance (2^2) * s = 4 s.

Wait, no: If X is normal with variance σ², then aX has variance a² σ². So 2 W(s) is normal with variance (2)^2 * s = 4 s.

Then E[exp(2 W(s))] is the moment generating function of 2 W(s) evaluated at 1. The MGF of a normal variable Z ~ N(μ, σ²) is E[e^{Z}] = e^{μ + σ² /2}. Here, μ = 0, σ² =4 s. So E[exp(2 W(s))] = e^{0 + (4s)/2} = e^{2 s}.

Now the second part: E[exp(W(t) - W(s))]. Since W(t) - W(s) is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance t - s. So its MGF is e^{(t-s)/2}.

Putting it all together: E[exp(W(t) + W(s))] = e^{2 s} * e^{(t-s)/2} = e^{2s + (t-s)/2}.

Let me compute that. 2s is 2*(1/2) =1, and (t-s)/2 is (1 -1/2)/2 = (1/2)/2= 1/4. So 1 + 1/4 =5/4. So E[exp(W(t) + W(s))] = e^(5/4) ≈ e^1.25. Let me compute that: e^1 is ~2.718, e^1.25 is about e^(1) * e^(0.25) ≈ 2.718 * 1.284 ≈ 3.508.

So E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{5/4} ≈ 3.508.

Wait, but wait a minute, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the way I expressed W(t) + W(s). Alternatively, perhaps I can think of X(t) and X(s) as exp(W(t)) and exp(W(s)), and find their covariance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider E[X(s) X(t)] = E[exp(W(s)) exp(W(t))} ]= E[exp(W(s) + W(t))].

Since W(s) and W(t) are not independent, but W(t) = W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)), and the increment (W(t)-W(s)) is independent of W(s).

So W(s) + W(t) = 2 W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)).

Therefore, W(s) + W(t) = 2 W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)).

So, E[exp(W(s) + W(t))] = E[exp(2 W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)))].

Since (W(t)-W(s)) is independent of W(s), the expectation factors into E[exp(2 W(s))] * E[exp( (W(t)-W(s)) )}.

As before, E[exp(2 W(s))] = e^{2s}, since W(s) is N(0, s), so 2 W(s) is N(0,4 s), and its MGF is e^{ (2s) * 2 }, wait wait, no. Wait, the MGF of a normal variable Z ~ N(μ, σ^2) is e^{μ Z + (σ^2 Z²)/2}, but in practice, for the MGF evaluated at x, it's e^{μ x + (σ² x²)/2}.

Wait, no, wait, the MGF G_Z(t) = E[e^{t Z}] = e^{μ t + (σ² t²)/2}.

So for 2 W(s), the MGF is G_{2 W(s)}(t) = E[e^{t * 2 W(s)}] = e^{0 * t + (4 s * t²)/2} = e^{2 s t²}.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute E[exp(2 W(s))} where W(s) ~ N(0, s).

So, 2 W(s) has mean 0 and variance (2)^2 s =4 s. So, the MGF of 2 W(s) is E[e^{t * 2 W(s)}] = e^{(4 s) t^2 / 2} } because for a normal variable Z ~ N(μ, σ^2), MGF is e^{μ t + (σ² t²)/2}.

So in this case, μ=0, σ²=4s, t is the variable being multiplied by Z. So, the MGF becomes e^{0 * t + (4 s t²)/2} = e^{(2 s) t²}.

So, E[exp(2 W(s))] is e^{2 s * (1)^2} = e^{2 s}.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm computing E[exp(2 W(s))], which is E[exp(t * 2 W(s)) ] where t=1. So t=1, so the MGF is e^{ (4 s * 1^2 ) / 2 } = e^{2 s}.

So that part is correct.

Now, for E[exp( (W(t) - W(s)) )], since (W(t)-W(s)) is N(0, t-s), so its MGF is e^{ (t - s) / 2 }.

So E[exp(W(t) + W(s))] = e^{2 s} * e^{ (t -s)/2 }.

So putting it together, E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{2s} * e^{(t - s)/2}.

Wait, but 2s is s + s. So 2s is the same as s + s. So (t - s)/2 is (t)/2 - s/2.

So, 2s + (t -s)/2 = 2s + t/2 -s/2 = (2s -s/2) + t/2 = (3s/2) + t/2.

Alternatively, 2s + (t - s)/2 = (4s + t - s) / 2 = (3s + t) / 2.

So E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{(3s + t)/2}.

Wait, but let's compute that with s=1/2 and t=1.

So (3*(1/2) + 1) / 2 = (1.5 +1 ) / 2 = 2.5 / 2 = 1.25. So e^1.25 is approximately 3.508.

But wait, that's the expectation of the product. Now I need to compute E[X(s)] and E[X(t)].

E[X(s)] is E[exp(W(s))], which is e^{s/2}, because for a normal variable Z ~ N(0, s), E[e^{W(s)}] = e^{s/2}.

Similarly, E[X(t)] = e^{t/2}.

So Cov(X(s), X(t)) = E[X(s) X(t)] - E[X(s)] E[X(t)].

Which is e^{(3s + t)/2} - e^{s/2} e^{t/2}.

Wait, but (3s + t)/2 = s + (t - s)/2. Hmm, let me compute that for s=1/2 and t=1.

(3*(1/2) +1 ) / 2 = (1.5 +1 ) /2= 2.5/2=1.25. So e^1.25 ≈3.508.

E[X(s)] = e^{(1/2)/2} = e^{0.25} ≈1.284.

E[X(t)] = e^{1/2} ≈1.6487.

So E[X(s)] E[X(t)] ≈ 1.284 * 1.6487 ≈2.117.

So Cov = 3.508 - 2.117 ≈1.391.

Looking at the options, I see option D is 1.3733 and option E is 0.9876. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E[X(s) X(t)] exactly. Because I'm using the expectation of the product as e^{(3s +t)/2}.

Wait, perhaps I can do it another way. Maybe I can express X(t) and X(s) as exponentials, and find their covariance using the formula for exponentials of Brownian motions.

I remember that for two log-normal variables, X and Y, the covariance can be found using the formula involving the correlation between X and Y. Since X = exp(W(t)) and Y=exp(W(s)), their correlation is min(s,t), which is s in this case (since s < t). So the correlation ρ is s.

Wait, but wait, s is 1/2, so ρ = 1/2.

So the covariance Cov(X, Y) = E[X Y] - E[X] E[Y].

We can also compute E[X Y] using the formula for the expectation of the product of two exponentials of Brownian motions.

I think there's a formula for E[exp(W(t)) exp(W(s))] which is e^{μ t + μ s + (σ_t^2 + σ_s^2 + 2 ρ σ_t σ_s)/2} }, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, more accurately, for two variables W(t) and W(s), where W(t) = W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)), and W(t) - W(s) is independent of W(s), then W(t) = W(s) + Z, where Z is independent of W(s).

So W(t) + W(s) = 2 W(s) + Z.

Thus, E[ exp(W(t) + W(s)) ] = E[ exp(2 W(s) + Z) ] = E[ exp(2 W(s)) exp Z ].

Since Z is independent of W(s), the expectation factors into E[ exp(2 W(s)) ] * E[ exp Z ].

As before, E[ exp(2 W(s)) ] = e^{2 s} and E[ exp Z ] = e^{0.5 (t - s)} because Z is N(0, t-s).

So E[exp(W(t) + W(s))] = e^{2 s} * e^{(t - s)/2} = e^{(4 s + t - s)/2} } = e^{(3 s + t)/2}.

Which is what I had before. So E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{(3s + t)/2}.

So with s=1/2, t=1, it's e^{(3*(1/2) +1 )/2} = e^{(1.5 +1)/2} = e^{2.5/2} = e^{1.25} ≈3.508.

E[X(s)] = e^{s/2} = e^{0.25} ≈1.284.

E[X(t)] = e^{1/2} ≈1.6487.

So Cov(X(s), X(t)) = 3.508 - (1.284)(1.6487).

Let me compute that. 1.284 * 1.6487: let's compute 1.284 *1.6487.

1.284 *1 =1.284.

1.284 *0.6 = 0.7704.

1.284 *0.0487 = approx 0.0622.

Adding together: 1.284 + 0.7704 = 2.0544 + 0.0622 ≈2.1166.

So 3.508 - 2.1166 =1.3914.

Looking at options, option D is 1.3733, option E is 0.9876.

Hmm, 1.3914 is close to 1.3733 but a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute E[X(s) X(t)].

Wait, another approach: X(t) = exp(W(t)), X(s)=exp(W(s)).

Cov(X(s), X(t)) = E[X(s) X(t)] - E[X(s)] E[X(t)}.

But perhaps I can express X(t) = X(s) * exp( (W(t) - W(s)) ), since W(t) = W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)).

So X(t) = X(s) * exp(Z), where Z is N(0, t-s).

So X(s) X(t) = X(s) * X(s) exp(Z) = X(s)^2 exp(Z).

E[X(s)^2 exp(Z)] = E[exp(Z) (X(s)^2) ].

But X(s) is exp(W(s)), so X(s) = exp(W(s)), which is exp(0 + W(s)). So X(s)^2 = exp(2 W(s)).

Thus, E[X(s)^2 exp(Z)] = E[exp(2 W(s)) exp(Z) ].

Since Z and W(s) are independent, this becomes E[exp(2 W(s))] * E[exp(Z)].

As before, E[exp(2 W(s))] is e^{2 s} and E[exp(Z)] is e^{( (t-s) ) / 2 }.

So again, E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{2s} * e^{(t - s)/2}.

Which is e^{ (4s + t -s ) / 2 } = e^{(3s + t)/2}.

So for s=1/2, t=1: (3*(1/2) +1 ) /2 = (1.5 +1)/2 =2.5/2=1.25.

So e^1.25 ≈3.508.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I computed E[X(s) X(t)].

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the covariance in terms of the correlation between X and Y.

Since X and Y are both log-normal, with correlation ρ = min(s,t) = s=1/2.

The formula for covariance Cov(X,Y) is:

Cov(X,Y) = (σ_X^2 σ_Y^2 / σ^4) * 2 σ^2 ρ,

Wait, perhaps I'm not remembering the formula correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

Cov(X,Y) = E[X Y] - E[X] E[Y}.

We know E[X] = e^{s/2}, E[Y] = e^{t/2}.

E[X Y} is e^{(3s + t)/2}.

So Cov(X,Y) = e^{(3s +t)/2} - e^{s/2} e^{t/2}.

Which is e^{(3s +t)/2} - e^{(s +t)/2}.

So (3s +t)/2 = s + (t - s)/2.

Thus, Cov(X,Y) = e^{s + (t - s)/2} - e^{(s + t)/2}.

Wait, that simplifies to e^{ (2s + t - s )/2 } - e^{ (s + t)/2 }.

Which is e^{ (s + t)/2 + s/2 } - e^{ (s +t)/2 }.

Wait, that's e^{ (s + t)/2 + s/2 } = e^{ (s + t + s)/2 } = e^{ (2s +t)/2}.

Wait, no: Wait, (s + t)/2 + s/2 = (s + t + s)/2 = (2s +t)/2.

So e^{(2s +t)/2} - e^{(s +t)/2}.

Factor out e^{(s+t)/2}:

e^{(s+t)/2} [e^{s} -1 ].

So Cov(X,Y) = e^{(s+t)/2} [e^s -1].

Wait, is that correct? Let me plug in s=1/2 and t=1.

Cov = e^{(1.5)/2} [e^{0.5} -1} = e^{0.75} (sqrt(e) -1).

Compute e^0.75: e^0.75 ≈2.117.

sqrt(e) ≈1.6487, so sqrt(e) -1 ≈0.6487.

So 2.117 * 0.6487 ≈1.373.

Ah! So the covariance is approximately 1.373.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1.3733 and option E is 0.9876.

So the correct answer should be D:1.3733.

Wait, but earlier I thought the expectation was e^1.25≈3.508, but that's E[X Y].

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the covariance.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E[X(s) X(t)}] using another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for covariance of two log-normal variables.

Another approach: since X(t) = exp(W(t)), and W(t) = W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)), and (W(t)-W(s)) is independent of W(s), then W(t) = W(s) + Z, where Z is independent of W(s) and has variance (t -s).

So W(t) + W(s) = 2 W(s) + Z.

So X(t) X(s) = exp(W(t)) exp(W(s)) = exp(2 W(s) + Z).

Since Z is independent of W(s), the expectation is E[exp(2 W(s)) exp Z} ] = E[exp(2 W(s)) ] E[exp Z}.

As before, E[exp(2 W(s)) ] = e^{2 s} and E[exp Z} ] = e^{ (t - s)/2 }.

So E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{2 s} e^{(t - s)/2}.

So that's correct.

So the covariance is e^{(3s +t)/2} - e^{(s + t)/2}.

Which is e^{(3*(1/2)+1)/2} - e^{(1/2 +1)/2}.

So e^{(1.5 +1)/2} = e^{2.5/2}=e^{1.25}.

e^{(0.5 +1)/2}=e^{1.5/2}=e^{0.75}.

So Cov = e^{1.25} - e^{0.75}.

Compute e^1.25: e^1 ≈2.718, e^0.25≈1.284, so 2.718 *1.284≈3.508.

e^0.75≈2.117.

So Cov≈3.508-2.117≈1.391.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's 1.373.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: perhaps I should compute the covariance using the formula:

Cov(X,Y) = E[X Y] - E[X] E[Y}.

We have E[X Y} = e^{(3s +t)/2}.

E[X] = e^{s/2}, E[Y}=e^{t/2}.

So Cov= e^{(3s +t)/2} - e^{(s+t)/2}.

Which is e^{(3s +t)/2 - (s +t)/2} } * [e^{(s +t)/2} ].

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the expression.

Let me factor out e^{(s +t)/2}:

Cov= e^{(s + t)/2} [ e^{(3s +t - s -t)/2} - 1 ].

Wait, 3s + t - s -t = 2s.

So it's e^{(s +t)/2} [ e^{2s /2} -1 ] = e^{(s + t)/2} [e^s -1 ].

Which is the same expression as before.

So Cov = e^{(s + t)/2} (e^s -1).

So for s=1/2, t=1:

e^{(0.5 +1)/2} (e^{0.5} -1 ) = e^{0.75} (sqrt(e) -1).

Compute e^0.75: e^0.75 ≈2.117.

sqrt(e)=e^{0.5}≈1.6487.

So 1.6487 -1 =0.6487.

So 2.117 *0.6487 ≈1.373.

Ah, so that's where the 1.373 comes from.

So the correct answer is option D:1.3733.

Wait, but the question says the last option is E:0.9876. So the answer is D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the covariance was approximately 1.391, which is close to 1.3733. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute e^{(s +t)/2} (e^s -1).

s=0.5, t=1.

So (s +t)/2 = (0.5 +1)/2=1.5/2=0.75.

e^0.75≈2.117.

e^s =e^0.5≈1.6487.

So e^s -1≈0.6487.

Multiply them: 2.117 *0.6487≈1.373.

So the correct answer is D:1.3733.

Wait, but why is option E 0.9876? That's much less than 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the covariance using the fact that the covariance is E[X Y] - E[X] E[Y}.

E[X Y} is e^{(3s +t)/2}.

E[X] E[Y}= e^{s/2} e^{t/2} = e^{(s +t)/2}.

So Cov= e^{(3s +t)/2} - e^{(s +t)/2}.

Which is e^{(s +t)/2} (e^{s} -1).

So for s=0.5, t=1:

e^{0.75} (e^{0.5} -1) ≈2.117 * (1.6487 -1)≈2.117 *0.6487≈1.373.

So the correct answer is D:1.3733.

I think I was correct in this approach, so the answer should be D.
</think>

To find the covariance between two log-normal processes \( X(t) = \exp(W(t)) \) and \( X(s) = \exp(W(s)) \), we use the formula for covariance of log-normal variables. The covariance is given by:

\[
\text{Cov}(X(s), X(t)) = e^{(3s + t)/2} - e^{(s + t)/2}.
\]

For \( s = 1/2 \) and \( t = 1 \):

1. Compute \( e^{(3s + t)/2} \):
   \[
   \frac{3 \cdot (1/2) + 1}{2} = \frac{1.5 + 1}{2} = 1.25, \quad e^{1.25} \approx 3.508.
   \]

2. Compute \( e^{(s + t)/2} \):
   \[
   \frac{1/2 + 1}{2} = \frac{1.5}{2} = 0.75, \quad e^{0.75} \approx 2.117.
   \]

3. Subtract the two results:
   \[
   \text{Cov}(X(s), X(t)) = 3.508 - 2.117 \approx 1.391.
   \]

4. Refine the calculation using the formula \( e^{(s + t)/2} (e^s - 1) \):
   \[
   e^{0.75} (e^{0.5} - 1) \approx 2.117 \cdot (1.6487 - 1) \approx 2.117 \cdot 0.6487 \approx 1.373.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is **D: 1.3733**. 

ANSWER: D
