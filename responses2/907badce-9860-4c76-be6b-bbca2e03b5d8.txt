Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how much work is done when a mass is raised a certain height. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says: How much work is done when a mass of 5 kilograms is raised a height of 2 meters? The options are A to J, with various joules values. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that work has to do with force and distance. 

Hmm, right. Work done against gravity is calculated using the formula W = mgh, where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. I think g is approximately 9.8 m/s², but sometimes problems might use a simplified value like 10 or 10. So, which one should I use here?

The problem gives me 5 kg and 2 meters. Let me plug in the numbers. So, W = 5 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 2 m. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is W = mass * gravity * height. So yes, 5 * 9.8 * 2. 

Calculating that: 5 multiplied by 9.8 is 49, and 49 multiplied by 2 is 98. So the work done would be 98 joules. Let me double-check the units. Mass is in kg, height in meters, and g in m/s². The units for work are kg·m²/s², which is joules. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, option J is 98 joules. So the correct answer should be J. 

Wait, but why don't I consider if I'm calculating the wrong formula? Like, sometimes work can depend on force and displacement, but since the force here is the gravitational force (weight), which is m*g, yeah, that's the right approach. So I don't think I need to consider any other factors like friction or anything like that. It's a simple case of moving against gravity, so W = mgh is spot on.

To determine the work done when a mass of 5 kilograms is raised a height of 2 meters, we use the formula for work done against gravity, \( W = mgh \), where \( m \) is mass, \( g \) is acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)), and \( h \) is height. 

Plugging in the values:  
\[
W = 5 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 2 \, \text{m} = 98 \, \text{joules}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **98 joules**, which corresponds to option **J**.
