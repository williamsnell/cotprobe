Question:

Although theoretically any food protein could act as a food allergen, there are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America which account for most of the allergic triggers observed in childhood. Which of the allergens pairings contains an allergen, which is not part of the group of eight major allergens?


Options:

A: Fish, shellfish
B: Soy, peanuts
C: Mustard seeds, lamb,

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about food allergens. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that any food protein could be a food allergen in theory, but in practice, Europe and North America have eight major allergens. The question is asking which pair includes an allergen that's not among these eight.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Fish, shellfish. I remember that fish and shellfish are definitely major allergens. Fish have a lot of proteins, like tannins and polyphenols, which are allergens. So both are here; they're major allergens, so this pair might be part of the eight. Wait, but the question is about which pair has an allergen not part of the eight, so if both are major, this pair might not be the correct answer. Wait, wait, but the question is which pair contains an allergen which is not part of the eight. So if all the pairs in the options are part of the eight, perhaps I need to look elsewhere.

Option B: Soy, peanuts. Soy is a major allergen in North America. Peanuts are also a major allergen. So both are from the eight, so this pair is made up of allergens in the list. So this wouldn't be the correct answer.

Option C: Mustard seeds, lamb. Mustard seeds are another major allergen, I believe. Lamb is also an allergen. Both are part of the eight major allergens. So this pair is made up of allergens in the list. So this can't be the correct answer either.

Wait, but the options only give three choices. Let me double-check because I might be missing something. Maybe the question is looking for an allergen that's not part of the eight. So which of these pairs includes a non-8 allergen?

Wait, the question says "which of the allergen pairings contains an allergen which is not part of the group of eight major allergens." So the pair must have one allergen that's not in the eight, and the other is in the eight.

Looking back, the eight major allergens in the US are: shellfish (including fish and shellfish), dairy, tree nuts, pollen, and the seven allergens: wheat, soy, corn, ragwort, triticale, herring, and mustard seeds. Wait, no—actually, the eight I think are: shellfish, dairy, tree nuts, pollen, and the seven others: wheat, soy, corn, ragwort, triticale, herring, and mustard seeds. So all these are major allergens.

So in the options, all the pairs are made up of allergens from the eight. But the question is asking which pair includes an allergen that is not part of those. So perhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking that one of the options has an allergen that's not in the eight. But according to my previous thought, all the options are pairs of allergens in the eight.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me make sure.

Wait, the eight major allergens are:

1. Shellfish (e.g., fish, shellfish)
2. Dairy (milk, cheese, etc.)
3. Tree nuts (almonds, walnuts, etc.)
4. Pollen
5. Wheat
6. Soy (soybeans)
7. Corn
8. Ragswort (like ragwort and triticale)
9. Herring
10. Mustard seeds

Wait, no, the 8 are shellfish, dairy, tree nuts, pollen, wheat, soy, corn, herring, and mustard seeds? Or is it 8 or 9?

Wait, correction: The 8 major allergens in the US are:

1. Shellfish (including fish, shellfish)
2. Dairy (milk, cheese)
3. Tree nuts (almonds, walnuts, etc.)
4. Pollen
5. Wheat
6. Soy (soybeans)
7. Corn
8. Herring
9. Mustard seeds

Wait, some sources say 9, others 8. Oh, but the question says 8 major allergens, so perhaps the list is 8.

Wait, no, I think the correct list is 8: shellfish, dairy, tree nuts, pollen, wheat, soy, corn, herring, and mustard seeds—so 9. But the question says 8, so perhaps the last one is not included?

But perhaps the confusion is in the answer options. The question is which pair includes an allergen not in the eight. So perhaps one of the options has an allergen not in the eight.

Wait, let me see:

Option C: Mustard seeds and lamb. Mustard seeds are a major allergen (8th), lamb is another major one (8th). So both are in the list.

Wait, what if the question is about the other way around: the pair includes a non-8 allergen, but the other is an 8.

Wait, let me re-examine all options:

Option A: Both fish and shellfish are part of the 8.

Option B: Soy and peanuts. Soy is 8th, peanuts are 2nd (dairy), so both in the list.

Option C: Mustard seeds (8th) and lamb (8th). Both in the list.

Wait, but the question is, which pair has an allergen not in the eight. So perhaps I've made a mistake in identifying which allergens are part of the 8.

Wait, perhaps in the US, the 8 major allergens are:

1. Shellfish
2. Dairy (milk, cheese)
3. Tree nuts (almonds, walnuts)
4. pollen
5. Wheat
6. Soy (soybeans)
7. Corn
8. Herring

So, does mustard seeds count as the 8th? Or is it another one?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

The eight in the US:

1. Shellfish (fish, shellfish)
2. Dairy (milk, cheese, etc.)
3. Tree nuts (almonds, walnuts, sunflower)
4. Pollen
5. Wheat
6. Soy (soybeans)
7. Corn
8. Herring
9. Mustard seeds (mustard seeds)

Wait, but some sources say the 8 are: shellfish, dairy, tree nuts, pollen, wheat, soy, corn, and herring. So mustard seeds would be the 9th.

But the question says 8, so perhaps mustard seeds is not one of the 8. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

The question is asking which pair contains an allergen not in the eight. So if an option includes a non-8 allergen, then that's the correct answer.

Looking again:

Option C: Mustard seeds and lamb.

Mustard seeds are a 9th allergen, so not in the 8. Lamb is a 8th. But the question is which pair includes an allergen not in the 8. So if one is in the 8 and the other is not, then that's the correct answer.

Wait, but all the options are pairs where both are in the 8. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that. Let me check the options again.

Option C: Mustard seeds and lamb. Both in 8.

Option B: Soy and peanuts. Soy is 8th, peanuts are 2nd (dairy), so both in 8.

Option A: Fish and shellfish. Both in 8.

So the question is which pair includes an allergen not part of the eight. So all the options have pairs where both are in the eight.

But that's impossible, because all the given options are pairs of allergens from the eight.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me re-express the 8 allergens correctly.

Wait, another approach: in the US, the 8 major allergens are:

1. Shellfish (fish, shellfish)
2. Dairy (milk, cheese)
3. Tree nuts (almonds, walnuts)
4. Pollen
5. Wheat
6. Soy (soybeans)
7. Corn
8. Herring

So mustard seeds are not in this list—so they would be the 9th. So, in the options, the only pair that includes a non-8 is option C: mustard seeds (non-8) and lamb (which is 8th).

Wait, but option C is mustard seeds and lamb. So that pair's first element is not in the 8.

But the question is which pair contains an allergen not part of the 8. So the correct answer would be option C, because one is a non-8 allergen.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

So the correct answer is option C, which includes a non-8 allergen.
</think>

The question asks which pair of allergens contains an allergen that is not part of the eight major allergens in Europe and North America. The eight major allergens are: shellfish, dairy, tree nuts, pollen, wheat, soy, corn, and herring. Mustard seeds are not among these eight, making them the non-8 allergen in the options provided.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A: Fish, shellfish**  
  Both fish and shellfish are major allergens and are part of the eight allergens. This pair contains allergens in the list, so it is not the correct answer.

- **Option B: Soy, peanuts**  
  Soy is a major allergen (part of the eight), and peanuts are dairy, which is also part of the eight. Both allergens in this pair are included in the list, so this pair is not the correct answer.

- **Option C: Mustard seeds, lamb**  
  Mustard seeds are not among the eight major allergens, while lamb is a major allergen (part of the eight). This pair contains one allergen (mustard seeds) that is not part of the eight, making it the correct answer.

Thus, the pair that includes an allergen not part of the eight is **Option C: Mustard seeds, lamb**.
