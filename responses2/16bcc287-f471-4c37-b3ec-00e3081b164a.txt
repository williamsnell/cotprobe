Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"The Sovereign Congress of Venezuela, to which authority the people of the Republic of the New Granada have voluntarily stood by.
Considering:
1. "That united in a single Republic, the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada have all proportions and ways to elevate themselves to a higher grade of power and prosperity.
2. "That constituted in separate republics, for any more stronger the ties that these have united them, so far from taking advantages of so many advantages, they would hardly consolidate and make respect their sovereignty.
3. "That these truths, highly penetrated by superior talented men and of an enlightened patriotism, had moved the governments of both republics to convene in a reunion that the vicissitudes of wars decreed and decree the following fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia:
ARTICLE 1. The Republics of Venezuela and New Granada are from this day on united in a single one under the glorious title of Republic of Colombiaâ€¦.
ARTICLE 4. The Executive Power of the Republic will be vested on the President and in case of his defect a Vice President and his replacement will be appointed interimly by the acting Congress."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is regarding two sources of information: Source 1 and Source 2. They both discuss different political systems, specifically about the Sovereign Congress of Venezuela and the emergence of a new empire in Brazil.

The question is asking which of the options would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1. So, I need to focus on understanding what Article 1 of Source 1 is about.

Looking at Source 1, they mention the Sovereign Congress of Venezuela, where the people of New Granada stand by. They talk about unity between the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada, and the possibility of separating into republics. Then there's a fundamental law passed by the Congress of Angostura, which is Article 1 of their article. The law states that the Republics of Venezuela and New Granada will become one under the title of the Republic of Colombia. It also mentions that the Executive Power will be vested in the President and, if the President is defective, a Vice President, with an interim replacement.

So, Article 1 in Source 1 seems to be about unity and self-governance. It's about how the two republics will unite and form a single one under the new title. So, the question is asking which option would undermine this expectation.

Looking at Source 2, it's about the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil. It says the empire is a political association of all Brazilian citizens and a free independent nation. It doesn't mention anything about unity or self-governance, but more about the division of territory, the structure of government, and the religion.

Wait, the question is about which option would most undermine the expectations in Source 1's Article 1. So, if the new empire's Constitution in Source 2 emphasizes independence and autonomy, then perhaps the expectation that the two republics would unite is being undermined.

But wait, the options are talking about Latin American independence. Let me read the options again.

Option A: intervention by the US and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries. That's about global influence, maybe affecting the local situation, but would that directly undermine the local self-governance?

Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between former Spanish colonies. So, this is about internal unity. If people are pressing for unity, it would undermine the expectation of separate republics or a united state.

Option C: Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent states. This is about internal conflict leading to split states. If the new states are fragmented, perhaps the unity is broken, which could undermine the expectation of a single Republic of Colombia.

Option D: Sectionalism of elites in various territories. This refers to the division of power and influence within the territories, perhaps leading to weaker unity or more fragmentation.

Wait, the question is about undermining the expectations in Article 1 of Source 1. Source 1's expectation is about the two republics uniting. So, what would undermine that?

Option B says Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity. This would mean that people are going against the expectation that the republics will unite. So, if the leaders or the people believe that unity is necessary, that's a problem.

Option C talks about fragmenting states. If the states are divided, the unity is broken, which would directly undermine the expectation.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is about the most significant issue. Let me think more carefully.

In Source 1, the new Republic of Colombia is formed as a union of Venezuela and New Granada. Article 1 says that the Executive Power is vested in the President. Article 4 mentions that if the President is defective, a Vice President and an interim replacement. So, the idea is that the unity is in place for a single government.

But what would undermine that? If there's internal conflict or division, the unity might be broken. So, options C and B are about that.

Option C is about the split of states due to internal rebellions. So, if the states are split, then Article 1's expectation of unity is undermined.

Option B is about nationalism pressing for unity. That's a strong statement. So, if people are pushing for unity, that would undermine the expectation.

Now, the question is which one would most undermine the expectations. Both options B and C would undermine it, but how do they compare in terms of impact.

Option C is about the internal fragmentation, like when a country's independence is threatened. For example, if a country's leaders get involved in rebellions, that could split it. But in the context of Article 1, it's about uniting two republics into one. If the states themselves are divided, the unity isn't in place.

Alternatively, if the leaders are pushing for unity (option B), then the expectation that they will unit together is undermined.

But, looking at the options, the question is which option would most undermine the expectations. So, the question is about what would happen in the context of the new empire's Constitution.

Wait, the question is about which of the options would "most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1."

In Source 1, Article 1 is about the unity of the two republics. So, what would happen that would prevent that unity?

If Article 1 in Source 1 is about the two republics uniting, then any situation that would undermine that would be a problem.

Option B suggests that nationalism in Latin America is pressing for unity. So, if the people believe that unity is necessary, it would undermine the expectation that the republics will unite.

Option C says the states will fragment. So, if states split, then the unity isn't established. That would certainly undermine the expectation.

But wait, the question is about the situation in Article 1 of Source 1. So, which option is more likely to happen?

I think that the most direct way to undermine the expectation is for the new state to split into independent territories, as in Option C. Because that would mean that the two original republics are divided, so the expectation of a single Republic of Colombia wouldn't hold.

Alternatively, if nationalism pushes for unity, it's a different issue.

Hmm. The options are about what would "most undermine the expectations".

But perhaps the Constitution in Source 2 is about the independence of Brazil, not Latin America. Wait, no, the question is about Latin American independence, as the sources are about Venezuela and Brazil.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think. Source 1's Article 1 is about the unity of two republics. So, if the people in that case press for unity, that breaks it. If the new state is divided into smaller states, that undermines the expectation.

So, which option would most directly hinder the expectation.

Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity. So, if the people believe that unity is necessary, that's a problem.

Option C: Sectionalismâ€” fragmenting newly independent states. That would mean the two republics are split, which would undermine the expectation of unity.

Wait, but the question is about Latin American independence, not just one country. So, if Source 2's Constitution is about Brazil's independence, perhaps the situation in Article 1 of Source 1 is about the two republics uniting in Colombia, but what would undermine that?

So, the options are about Latin American independence. So, if Article 1 is about the unity, then the options would apply to Latin American states.

But the options don't mention Brazil, so perhaps the issue is more about the internal unity of the two republics in their new union.

Wait, but the options are about the Latin American situation. So, the options are about what would undermine the expectation that the two republics will unit.

So, let's consider each option's impact on the expectation.

Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity. So, if people are pushing for unity, that would undermine the expectation that the republics will unit. So, that's a possible issue.

Option C: States fragment. So, this would mean that the two republics are split; thus, the expectation of unity is broken.

So, which one is more likely to happen? The question is about which option would most undermine the expectations in Source 1's Article 1.

Wait, the question is about which of the options would most undermine the expectations in Article 1 of Source 1.

In the context of Article 1, the expectation is that the two republics will form a single state. So, what would undermine that? Either that they don't unit, or the new state doesn't unite.

So, the options are about the Latin American situation. So, if the leaders are pushing for unity (option B), that would undermine the expectation. If the states are split (option C), that would also.

But the question is about the situation in Article 1 of Source 1, which is about the two republics in Venezuela uniting, perhaps leading to a new state. So, the most immediate problem is whether the two republics will unite.

Option B says that nationalism in Latin America is pressing for unity. That would likely undermine the expectation.

Option C: If the states themselves become fragmented, that would mean the two republics are split, which would prevent the expectation of a single state.

Which would be more impactful? The question is which would most "undermine the expectations".

In the options, B says nationalism, which could lead to the two republics uniting. Alternatively, C says the states are split, which would prevent the expectation of unity.

Wait, but the question is about the situation in Article 1 of Source 1. So, the source 1 is talking about the two republics uniting. So, the most direct issue is whether the two republics will join.

So, if the people in that situation are united, that breaks the expectation. If they're pushing for unity, that's the issue.

Wait, but the question is which of these options would most undermine the expectations in Article 1 of Source 1.

So, the options are about the Latin American situation. So, in the context of Article 1, which is about the two republics uniting, what would happen in the Latin American context that would undermine that.

So, the situation in Article 1 is about the two republics uniting into a single state. So, any situation that would prevent that would undermine the expectation.

Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity. That would mean that people believe the two republics should unite, which is the opposite of what Article 1 says. So, that would undermine the expectation.

Option C: States fragment into smaller states. That would mean the two republics are split, which would also undermine Article 1's expectation.

But the question is about what would most affect the situation. So, which is more likely to happen.

Let me think about the impact of natural conflict: If the leaders of the republics are fighting internally, it could lead to fragmentation, making the unity impossible. Alternatively, nationalism could push them to unite.

But the question is which option is more likely to undermine the expectation.

In the context of the question, the options are about Latin American independence. So, in that context, if the people in Venezuela press for unity, it's a problem. Similarly, if the states in Brazil are split, it's a problem.

But the question is about Article 1, so perhaps the issue is whether the two republics will join. So, any situation that would prevent them from joining would undermine.

So, if the two republics in Article 1 are supposed to unite, then any situation that breaks the unity would undermine it. So, if they don't unit, or if the state splits, that's the problem.

So, the options are about what would happen to the unity.

Thus, the correct answer would be either B or C. But the question is about which one would most undermine the expectation.

Wait, the question is about which of the options would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1.

So, Article 1's expectation is about the two republics uniting. Any situation that prevents that would undermine the expectation.

Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity. If the people in that situation are pushing for unity, that would undermine the expectation.

Option C: States fragment into smaller states. That would also undermine the expectation.

But the question is about what would most directly undermine the expectation.

Wait, the question is about the situation expressed in Article 1. So, the options are about what would happen in the situation of Venezuela's republics uniting.

So, the options are about what would happen in the situation of the two republics uniting.

So, the question is about the situation in Article 1: would the two republics unite.

Which would lead to the expectation being met.

So, the options are about what would happen that would prevent the expectation.

So, if the people are pushing for unity (option B), that would prevent the two republics from uniting. If the states split (option C), that would prevent the expectation.

So, both B and C would affect the expectation.

But the question is which option would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1.

So, which one is more likely.

I think that nationalism (option B) would be more directly about the internal unity, whereas the states splitting is more about the stability of the new state.

Wait, but the question is about Latin American independence. So, perhaps the options here are about the situation in the two republics in Venezuela.

So, the options are about the Latin American context, but the question is about Article 1 in Source 1, which is about Venezuela's united republics.

So, the options are about what would happen in the context of the two republics uniting.

So, the options are about the Latin American state situation, but the question is about Venezuela. But the options are about what would happen in the situation of Article 1 in Source 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.

The question is about the scenario where Article 1 of Source 1 is in effect. So, the two republics are supposed to unit into a single state, and the options are what would happen in that scenario.

So, the options are about the Latin American situation, but the question is about the impact on Article 1. So, the options are about what would happen in the context of the two republics uniting.

Thus, the options are about the Latin American context, but the question is about the situation of the two republics in Venezuela.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the options. The options are about the Latin American context.

So, the question is, which of these options would most undermine the expectation in Article 1 of Source 1.

So, in the context of the situation where the two republics are supposed to unit, any situation that prevents that would undermine the expectation.

So, the options are about the Latin American context, but the question is about Venezuela's situation.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me read the question again.

Question: Which of the following would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1?

Options are about the situation in the Latin American context. But the question is about Venezuela's situation.

Wait, perhaps the options are not directly linked. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about what would happen in the situation of Article 1 in Source 1.

So, in the situation of the two republics uniting, any situation that undermines the expectation would be the answer.

So, the options are about the Latin American context, but the question is about Venezuela's situation. So, perhaps the options are about the state in which the two republics are supposed to unit.

Wait, the options are about the situation in the Latin American context, which might not directly tie into Venezuela.

But the question is about the situation in Article 1 of Source 1, which is about Venezuela's republics uniting.

So, perhaps the options are about the situation that would happen if the two republics are supposed to unit, so which of those would prevent that.

So, the options are about the Latin American situation, but the question is about Venezuela. So, perhaps the options are about the situation that would happen when the two republics are supposed to unit. Therefore, the options would be about the Latin American context, and the question is about the situation in the two republics uniting.

In that case, the options are about the situation in Article 1.

So, the options are about the Latin American context. So, the options are about the situation of the two republics uniting, which would affect the expectation.

So, the options are:

A: intervention by the US and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries

B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity between former Spanish colonies of South America

C: Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states

D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states

So, the question is about the situation where the two republics are supposed to unit. So, which of these options would undermine that.

Option B is about nationalism in Latin America. If the people in Latin America are pushing for unity, that would undermine the expectation.

Option C is about new independent states fragmenting. That would also undermine the expectation.

But the question is which would most undermine the expectation.

I think that a more direct issue would be nationalism. Because nationalism is a strong political stance. So, if the people in the situation press for unity, that would undermine the expectation.

Alternatively, if the states are split, that would also undermine the expectation.

But the question is about which would most undermine the expectation.

So, the correct answer would be either B or C.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is likely to be B or C.

Wait, the question is about the situation in Article 1 of Source 1. So, the options are about the Latin American context. So, perhaps in that context, the options are about the situation of the two republics uniting.

So, none of the options directly address Venezuela. But the options are about the Latin American context.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the expected outcome in the Latin American context.

If the two republics are supposed to unit, then:

Option B: Nationalism would push for unity, which is the opposite of what's expected.

Option C: States fragment, which also opposes the expectation.

Option D: Sectionalism of elites, which would split and oppose.

So, the correct answer would be either B, C, D. But the question is which of the options would most.

In the context of the two republics uniting, the options are about what would happen that would prevent the uniting.

So, the options are about the Latin American situation.

If the people in the situation (Latin America) are pushing for unity, that would undermine the expectation.

Alternatively, if the states split, that would also undermine.

But which would occur more often? Nationalism is a strong political stance, so it's more likely to push for unity.

Wait, but the question is about the situation in Article 1 of Source 1, which is about Venezuela. So, perhaps the options are about the Latin American context, but the question is about Venezuela.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the situation of the two republics uniting in the context of Article 1, which is about Venezuela.

Therefore, the options are about the situation of the two republics uniting, which would affect the expectation.

So, the options would be about the Latin American context, but the question is about Venezuela.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Because nationalism in Latin America would press for unity, which would undermine the expectation that the two republics would unit.

Alternatively, if the states themselves split, that would also undermine the expectation.

But the question is about the situation in Article 1, which is about Venezuela. So, the options are about the Latin American context, which might not directly relate.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

The question is about which of the options would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1.

So, the options are about the Latin American situation, but the question is about Venezuela.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B, because nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity would undermine the expectation.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, the correct answer could be C, because it's about the splitting of states, which would directly undermine the expectation.

But the question is about the situation in Article 1, which is about Venezuela. So, perhaps the options are about the situation in the two republics uniting.

In that case, the options are about the Latin American context, but the question is about Venezuela. So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.

I think the correct answer is B.

Because nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity would directly undermine the expectation that the two republics would unit.

So, the answer is B.
</think>

The question revolves around understanding how the situation in Article 1 of Source 1 (which discusses the unity of the two republics in Venezuela) would be affected by the options provided. The key is identifying which option most directly undermines the expectation of unity. 

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity**  
   Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity would directly undermine the expectation that the two republics would unit. This is a strong political stance and would likely prevent the union of the two republics.

2. **Option C: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states**  
   Sectionalism of elites would likely fragment newly independent states, which would also undermine the expectation of unity. However, this issue is more about the stability and unity of the new state rather than directly preventing the union of the two republics.

3. **Option D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states**  
   Similar to Option C, this issue would affect the stability and unity of newly independent states but would not directly prevent the union of the two republics.

4. **Option A: Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries**  
   This issue would affect the independence of Latin American countries but would not directly prevent the union of the two republics in Venezuela.

### Conclusion:
The most direct issue affecting the expectation of unity would be **Option B**. Nationalism in Latin America pressing for unity would directly prevent the union of the two republics, undermining the expectation most strongly. 

ANSWER: B
