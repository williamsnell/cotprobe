Question:

A woman owned a 10-acre tract of rural farmland in fee simple absolute. The woman agreed to sell the farmland to a man, and each signed a writing stating that the farmland was beitig sold: ". . . for $10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged. " In actuality, the man had not yet paid the woman the $10,000. At the date set for closing, the woman transferred a deed to the farmland to the man, who gave the woman a check for $10,000. Howevei, a few days after the woman deposited the check, she received notice from her bank that the check had not cleared, due to insufficient funds in the account. The woman then brought suit against the man. At trial, the woman seeks to testify that the man did not in fact pay her the $10,000 as recited in their written instrument. The man objects to the woman's proposed testimony. Will the trial court judge be correct in sustaining the man's objection?

Options:

A: Yes, because the woman accepted the check as payment and the risk of the check not clearing falls on her.
B: No, because the woman can demonstrate that the man has breached the contract.
C: No, because the man's act of issuing a check that did not clear is evidence of fraudulent intent.
D: Yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
E: No, because the parol evidence rule does not operate to exclude evidence to show lack or want of consideration.
F: Yes, because the parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of oral agreements that contradict written agreements.
G: Yes, because the woman's acknowledgment of receipt in the written instrument is conclusive proof of payment.
H: No, because the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing.
I: Yes, because the doctrine of promissory estoppel will prevent the woman from denying her own signed acknowledgment that she received the $10,000.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The scenario is a woman who owns 10 acres of rural farmland. She agreed to sell it to a man, and both signed a deed stating it was "beitig sold" for $10,000, with receipt acknowledged. The man then gave the woman a check for $10,000. But a few days later, the woman deposited the check, and she received notice that the check hadn't cleared because the bank didn't have enough funds. She sued the man, claiming he didn't pay the $10,000 as written in their contract. The man objects, and the question is whether the judge should allow that objection.

So I need to determine whether the man's breach of contract is proven by the check not clearing, and whether the woman's written agreement is sufficient to show that he paid.

Hmm, I remember that contracts can be oral or written, and some contracts are subject to checks being honored. But the written instrument in this case is a deed, which is a written contract. The deed is a form of a written agreement, so it's likely enforceable.

Wait, but in this case, the check wasn't honored because the funds didn't clear. Does that mean the contract was breached? The check is a form of payment, so if the payment was done, the check should have been honored. But the fact that the funds didn't clear suggests that the payment wasn't made.

But in the written instrument, the promise was to receive the payment. So the woman should have accepted the check as payment, and the man should have been bound. However, when the man gave the check, the woman deposited it, and the bank didn't have enough funds to process it. So the check didn't clear, which would mean the payment wasn't made.

So the question is whether the check not clearing is evidence of breach. I think in some jurisdictions, the payment must be made before the check can be honored. If the payment is missed, then the check fails to clear, leading to breach.

But wait, the written contract states that the check must be received. So the promise is that the payment is accepted when the check is received. If the check is deposited but never received, that's a breach. But if the check is deposited and the payment is made (via the check), then it should have been honored.

But in this case, the money didn't clear, which suggests that the check wasn't honored. So the woman would say the man didn't pay, and the man objects.

I'm trying to recall whether a check not clearing is sufficient to prove breach. I think that if a party deposits a check, that's considered a payment. But if the funds don't clear, that doesn't necessarily prove that the check was honored. It could be that the funds were insufficient, but the check was deposited, so the payment was made.

Wait, but in the deed, the promise is to receive the payment when the check is received. So if the check is deposited, the payment is made. So the check should have been honored. However, the bank didn't process it because the funds were insufficient. So in that case, the payment wasn't honored because the funds were insufficient. But the contract is for $10,000, so the check should have been made, but the funds weren't there. So the payment was made (the check was deposited, so the payment was done), but the funds weren't there, so the check didn't clear.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the check was deposited, so the payment was made, but the funds weren't enough to process it. So the check didn't clear, but the payment was made. So the man's breach is that he didn't honor the check, even though the payment was made.

So the woman's written agreement says the payment is made when the check is received. So when she deposited the check, that's when the payment occurred. So the check should have been honored. But the funds were insufficient, so the check didn't clear.

In that case, the woman would have to prove that she was properly informed of the funds not being sufficient, but the check was deposited, which should have been honored. So the man's breach is the failure to honor the check despite the funds not being sufficient.

But wait, is the failure to process the check the same as the failure to honor the payment? Because the payment was made, just not with the right funds. So the check should have been honored, but the funds weren't there.

So the issue is whether the check didn't clear is evidence of breach. I think that's a yes. Because the check was deposited, that's considered payment. So the payment was made, but the funds weren't there. So the check didn't clear, meaning the payment wasn't honored.

Alternatively, if the funds were insufficient, the check should still have been honored because it was deposited. The failure to process the check would be a breach regardless.

Wait, but in some cases, if the funds are insufficient, the check might not clear, but the payment was made. So the contract is for $10,000, so the payment was received, but the funds weren't enough. So the check didn't clear, but the payment was made. So the man breached the contract by not honoring the payment despite the check being deposited.

But does the fact that the check was deposited negate the failure to process it? I think the deposit is considered payment, so the check should have been honored. The failure to process the check is another type of breach, but in this case, the payment was made, so the failure to process is a separate matter.

So the woman's written contract was for the payment upon the receipt of the check. So if the payment was made, the check should have been honored. But the bank didn't process it, so the payment wasn't honored. So the man breached the contract.

But the issue is whether the check not clearing is evidence of breach. I think it is, because the check was deposited, which is considered payment. So the payment was made, but the funds weren't there. So the failure to process the check is a separate breach.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the check not processing is a separate breach, but the payment being made is considered a breach because the payment was done, even if the funds weren't there. So the man's breach is that he didn't honor the payment despite the check being deposited, which was a condition of the contract.

So the woman's written instrument shows that she accepted the check as payment. The check should have been honored, but the funds weren't there. So the man breached the contract.

So the man's point is that he didn't honor the payment, even though the check was deposited. So the woman's written agreement is the key.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the woman accepted the check as payment and the risk of the check not clearing falls on her.

This seems correct. The check was deposited, so she accepted it as payment. The failure to process the check is a separate breach, but the payment was done. So the man is wrong to say he didn't pay, as she did.

Option B: No, because the woman can demonstrate that the man has breached the contract.

But the written contract says the payment is upon receipt. So if the payment was made, the check should have been honored, but the funds were insufficient. So the payment was done, but the check didn't clear. So the man breached.

Option C: No, because the man's act of issuing a check that did not clear is evidence of fraudulent intent.

Wait, the issue is not about intent but about breach of contract. So whether the check didn't clear is enough to show breach. I don't think the man can show fraud through the check not clearing. Fraud requires illegal misrepresentation or fraudulent intent, not just failure to process.

Option D: Yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement.

The written instrument is between the woman and the man, so it's a complete agreement. So her acceptance of the check is a part of the contract. So this might be a reason to trust the contract, but the issue is whether the check wasn't honored.

Option E: No, because the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing.

I don't think the parol evidence rule applies here. The issue is not about oral agreements after the writing. The contract was in writing, so the parol evidence rule doesn't apply.

Option F: Yes, because the parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of oral agreements that contradict written agreements.

Again, the contract was in writing, so the parol evidence rule doesn't apply; the written agreement is the only evidence.

Option G: Yes, because the woman's acknowledgment of receipt in the written instrument is conclusive proof of payment.

This is correct because in a written contract, the promise to receive is part of the agreement. The woman's acceptance (acknowledgment of receipt) is a part of the contract, so the man didn't pay, which is the breach.

Option H: No, because the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing.

Wait, the parol evidence rule says that evidence presented after the writing is not admissible. But in this case, the issue is about what was in the writing, not about events after the writing. So this option might not be relevant.

Option I: Yes, because the doctrine of promissory estoppel will prevent the woman from denying her own signed acknowledgment that she received the $10,000.

Pro presto estoppel says that the grantor can estonor damages from the grantee if the promise is breached. So if the man breached by not paying, the woman can estore her own acknowledgment.

Wait, but the woman's written agreement shows she accepted the check as payment. So she can rely on that. Promissory estoppel doesn't negate that, it just allows the woman to recover damages, but she already accepted the payment.

So the question is whether the man's breach is proven. I think the check not clearing is a breach of contract, so the man's objection is correct, and the judge should allow the objection.

So the correct answer is A.
</think>

The woman's written contract states that the man agreed to sell the land for $10,000 upon receipt of a check. The man deposited the check and the woman received notice the check hadn't cleared due to insufficient funds. The woman seeks to testify the man breached the contract, while the man objects. The question is whether the judge should allow the man's objection.

The key issues are whether the check not clearing constitutes a breach of contract and whether the woman's written contract is sufficient to show payment.

1. **Writing Contract vs. Oral Agreement**: The contract is in writing, which is enforceable. The woman's acknowledgment of receipt in the contract is conclusive proof of payment.

2. **Check Not Cleared as Evidence of Breach**: The check was deposited, indicating payment. The failure to process the check (even though funds were insufficient) suggests breach of contract. This is a valid breach, as the payment was made (via the check), and the failure to process is a separate matter.

3. **Promissory Estoppel**: While promissory estoppel allows recovery of damages, it does not negate the woman's acceptance of payment in the written contract.

4. **Parol Evidence Rule**: This rule applies to events after the contract was formed, which is irrelevant here.

The woman's written agreement demonstrates payment, and the check not clearing is evidence of breach. The judge should allow the man's objection.

**ANSWER: A**
