Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the minimum vertex cover of an undirected graph. Let's see what I remember about vertex covers. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest such set.

The graph G has edges E = {<0,2>, <2,4>, <3,4>, <1,4>}. So the nodes are 0,1,2,3,4. The edges are between (0-2), (2-4), (3-4), and (1-4). 

The question is asking which of the options A to J represents the minimum vertex cover, and it has to include 0. So I need to check each option and see which one is a vertex cover, and among those, find the smallest one.

Wait, no, actually the question says "What is the minimum vertex cover of G if 0 is one of vertex cover?" So the vertex cover must include 0. So I can only consider the options that include 0.

Looking at the options:

A: [0,1,2] → includes 0, yes.
B: [0,2,4] → yes.
C: [0,1,4] → yes.
D: [0,4] → yes.
E: [0,3,4] → yes.
F: [0,1,3] → yes.
G: [0,1] → no, because 2 and 4 are not included, so it's not a cover.
H: [0,2,3] → includes 0, yes.
I: [0,2] → yes.
J: [0,3] → yes.

Now, I need to determine for each of these whether they are vertex covers, and then among those, find the smallest (i.e., with the least number of vertices).

Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum vertex cover, but if 0 is required, perhaps I should also consider that the vertex cover must include 0, and then find the smallest such set.

So let's check each option that includes 0:

Option A: [0,1,2]. Let's see if all edges are covered. Edge 0-2: yes. Edge 2-4: 2 is in the set. Edge 3-4: 4 not in the set, 3 not either. So no, 3-4 is not covered. So A is not a vertex cover.

Option B: [0,2,4]. Edges:
0-2: yes.
2-4: yes.
3-4: 4 is in the set, yes.
1-4: 4 is in the set, yes. So B is a vertex cover.

Option C: [0,1,4]. Let's see:
0-2: 0 is in the set, yes.
2-4: 4 is in the set, yes.
3-4: 4 is in the set, yes.
1-4: 1 and 4 in set. So yes. So C is a vertex cover.

Option D: [0,4]. Check edges:
0-2: yes.
2-4: yes.
3-4: 4 is in set, yes.
1-4: yes. So D is a vertex cover.

Option E: [0,3,4]. Edges:
0-2: 0 is in set, yes.
2-4: 4 is in set, yes.
3-4: yes.
1-4: yes. So E is a vertex cover.

Option F: [0,1,3]. Check edges:
0-2: 0 is in set, yes.
2-4: neither 2 nor 4 are in the set. So 2-4 is not covered. So F is not a vertex cover.

Option G: [0,1]. Check edges:
0-2: yes.
2-4: 1 is not in set, 2 not either. So 2-4 is not covered. So G is not a vertex cover.

Option H: [0,2,3]. Check edges:
0-2: yes.
2-4: 2 is in set, yes.
3-4: 3 is in set, yes.
1-4: 4 is not in set. So 1-4 is not covered. So H is not a vertex cover.

Option I: [0,2]. Check edges:
0-2: yes.
2-4: 2 is in set, yes.
3-4: 4 not in set, 3 not in set. So 3-4 is not covered. So I is not a vertex cover.

Option J: [0,3]. Check edges:
0-2: yes.
2-4: 3 not in set, 2 not in set. So 2-4 not covered. So J is not a vertex cover.

So the vertex covers that include 0 are options B, C, D, E.

Now, among these, which is the minimum in terms of the number of vertices? Let's count the size:

B: 3 vertices.
C: 3.
D: 2.
E:3.

Wait, D has 2 vertices. So D is a vertex cover with only 2 vertices, which is smaller than B, C, and E. So D is the smallest. But I should confirm if D is a vertex cover.

Looking back, D is [0,4]. So yes, all edges are covered as I already checked.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check option D. Because in the graph, nodes 3 and 4 are connected. So 4 is in the vertex cover, so that edge is covered. Similarly, node 1 and 4 are connected, 4 is in the cover, so that's covered. The other edges are connected to 0, so covered. So yes, D is a vertex cover.

So the minimum vertex cover with 0 included is D, which has 2 vertices. But wait, are there any other options with fewer vertices that include 0? Let me see.

Wait, option I is [0,2], but that doesn't cover the 3-4 edge. So I can't choose I.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should check if there's a vertex cover of size 2 that includes 0. I think there is—the option D. Because 4 is connected to 3 and 1, but 4 is part of the cover.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is [0,4], which is a vertex cover. So that's the minimal one with 0 included.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps using the complement graph or using some algorithm to find the minimal vertex cover, but since it's a small graph, maybe I can find it manually.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct minimal vertex cover is [0,4], which is option D. But wait, looking at the options again, option E is [0,3,4], which is also a vertex cover. But D has 2, which is smaller.

Wait, but in the options given, option D is a vertex cover, and it's the smallest. So the answer should be D.

The question asks for the minimum vertex cover of the graph G, which includes node 0. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. 

The graph G has edges {<0,2>, <2,4>, <3,4>, <1,4>}. The options provided are sets of nodes, and we need to determine which set is a vertex cover and has the minimum number of nodes. Since 0 must be included, we eliminate any options that do not contain 0.

After evaluating each option, we find that option D ([0,4]) is a vertex cover because it ensures that all edges are covered:
- Edge <0,2> is covered by 0.
- Edge <2,4> is covered by 4.
- Edge <3,4> is covered by 4.
- Edge <1,4> is covered by 4.

Option D is the smallest vertex cover that includes 0.
