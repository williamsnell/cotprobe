Okay, so I've got this economics question here about nominal and real income and the price level. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that the nominal income rises by 4 percent and real income falls by 1 percent. I need to find out by how much the price level changed. The options are various percentages, so I should probably think about how these changes relate to each other.

Alright, let's break it down. I remember that nominal income is what people earn before adjusting for inflation, while real income is after adjusting for inflation. So, if nominal income increases, but real income decreases, that suggests that prices must have fallen because people's purchasing power is decreasing.

Wait, the formula that connects these should be something like real income equals nominal income divided by the price level. So, R = N / P, where R is real income, N is nominal, and P is the price level. Rearranging that, P = N / R. 

In this case, the nominal income (N) is increasing by 4%, so N increases by 4%. Real income (R) is decreasing by 1%, meaning R decreases by 1%. Wait, so R is 1% less than before. 

So if I think about the price level P, which is N/R. Let me assign some numbers to make this clearer. Let's say initially, the nominal income is N and the real income is R. 

After the changes, the new nominal income is N * 1.04 (since it's a 4% increase). The new real income is R * 0.99 (since it's a 1% decrease). 

So the new price level P' = (N * 1.04) / (R * 0.99). 

But wait, initially, P = N/R. So substituting that in, P' = (N/R) * (1.04/0.99). Let's calculate that fraction: 1.04 / 0.99. Let me compute that. 0.99 is approximately 1, so 1.04/0.99 is roughly 1.0505 (since 0.99 * 1.0505 ≈ 1.04). 

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation. 1.04 divided by 0.99. Let me compute: 1.04 ÷ 0.99. Let me think, 0.99 * 1.05 is 1.0395, which is about 1.04. So 1.04 / 0.99 ≈ 1.0505. So P' is approximately 1.0505 times the original P. 

So the price level has increased by about 5.05%? That seems a bit high, but let me check the options. The options are 4%, 3%, no change, 5% decrease, 5% increase, etc.

Wait no, wait. Because in the formula, P' is (N/R) * (1.04/0.99). So P' is 1.0505 times the original P. That would mean the price level has increased by about 5%. So the price level went up 5%, which would make the options look for a 5% increase. Let me see the options again.

Option E is 5 percent increase. So that's the answer? Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm applying the formula correctly. Because sometimes the formula is stated as the change in the price level. Let me think about the percentage change.

Alternatively, another approach: the formula for the inflation rate is (R' - R)/R * 100%. Here, R is the real income, which decreased by 1%, so R' = R - 1% R = 0.99 R. The nominal income increased by 4%, so N' = N * 1.04.

The price level P is N/R. So the new price level is P' = N' / R' = (N * 1.04) / (0.99 R) = (N/R) * (1.04/0.99) = P * (1.04/0.99).

So the new price level is P multiplied by 1.0505, which is a 5.05% increase. So the price level went up by about 5%. That would make the correct answer option E: 5 percent increase.

Wait, but another way to think about it: perhaps using the concept of real vs nominal changes. When nominal income increases by 4%, and real income decreases by 1%, that means the price level has increased by the difference between those two.

Wait, the real income has decreased by 1% relative to the old real income. So the new real income is 99% of the old. The new nominal income is 104% of the old. So the price level must have risen such that (104% / 99%) is the factor by which prices have gone up.

104 / 99 = 1.0505, which again is a 5.05% increase. So that points to option E.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the original nominal income is N, and real income is R. The price level is P. So N = P * R. 

After the changes: N' = 1.04 N, and R' = 0.99 R. So N' = P' * R'. 

Substituting, 1.04 N = P' * 0.99 R. But since N = P R, we can write 1.04 * P R = P' * 0.99 R. 

Divide both sides by R: 1.04 P = 0.99 P'. 

So P' = (1.04/0.99) P = approximately 1.0505 P. So the price level goes up by about 5.05%, which is roughly 5 percent. So the correct answer is E.

The question involves understanding the relationship between nominal income, real income, and the price level. The formula connecting these is:

\[
\text{Real Income (R)} = \frac{\text{Nominal Income (N)}}{\text{Price Level (P)}}
\]

Rearranging, the Price Level is:

\[
P = \frac{N}{R}
\]

Given that nominal income rises by 4% and real income falls by 1%, the new values are:

- New Nominal Income (\(N'\)) = \(N \times 1.04\)
- New Real Income (\(R'\)) = \(R \times 0.99\)

The new Price Level (\(P'\)) is:

\[
P' = \frac{N'}{R'} = \frac{N \times 1.04}{R \times 0.99} = \frac{N}{R} \times \frac{1.04}{0.99}
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{1.04}{0.99}\):

\[
\frac{1.04}{0.99} \approx 1.0505
\]

Thus, the new Price Level is:

\[
P' = 1.0505 \times P
\]

This indicates a 5.05% increase in the Price Level. Among the options, the closest match is a 5% increase.
