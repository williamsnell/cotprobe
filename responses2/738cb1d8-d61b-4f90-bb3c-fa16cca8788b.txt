Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is asking for the sum of the primes between 100 and 200, inclusive, that are either 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what the question is really asking. We're looking for prime numbers in the range 100 to 200. For each of these primes, we need to check if they are either 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. So, any prime p that satisfies p = n² + 1 or p = n² + 2 for some integer n. If that's true, then p is included in our sum.

Alright, so the plan is to list all the primes between 100 and 200, and then for each prime, see if it's one more or two more than a square. Then sum all such primes that meet the criteria.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than checking every prime in that range. Because checking primes one by one could take a while. Let me think about the approach.

Maybe I can generate all the perfect squares near the primes we're considering. So, for each prime p between 100 and 200, I can check if p-1 or p-2 is a perfect square. So, for example, for p=101, p-1=100, which is 10², so that's a perfect square. So 101 would be included because it's 10² +1.

Wait, but wait: we're looking for primes that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. So for each prime, subtract 1 or 2 and see if the result is a square.

Alternatively, for each number n² +1 and n² +2, check if it's a prime and within the 100-200 range.

Wait, but n² can't be too big. Let's see: the maximum n² would be such that n² +2 < 200. So n² < 198. So n can be up to 14, since 14² is 196, and 14² +2 is 198, which is still under 200. But wait, 14²=196, so n=14 gives 198, which is within the range. So n can be from 1 to 14, but let's see what that covers.

But perhaps a better approach is to generate all possible n² +1 and n² +2 within 100-200 and check if they're primes.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Enumerate all n² +1 and n² +2 where n² +1 is between 100 and 200, and n² +2 is between 100 and 200.

So n² +1 >= 100 → n² >=99 → n >=10 (since 10²=100). Similarly, n² +1 <=200 → n² <=199 → n <=14 (14²=196, 15²=225 which is over 200.)

Similarly for n² +2: n² +2 >=100 → n² >=98 → n >=10 (10²=100). And n² +2 <=200 → n² <=198 → n <=14 (since 14²=196, 15²=225 is over.)

So n can be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

So let's compute n² +1 and n² +2 for each n from 10 to 14.

n=10:

n²=100.

n²+1=101, which is a prime.

n²+2=102, which is not a prime (divisible by 2).

So 101 is a candidate.

n=11:

n²=121.

n²+1=122, which is even, so not a prime.

n²+2=123. 123 is divisible by 3 (1+2+3=6), so not a prime.

n=12:

n²=144.

n²+1=145. 145 is 5*29, so not prime.

n²+2=146. 146 is even, so not prime.

n=13:

n²=169.

n²+1=170. 170 is even, so not prime.

n²+2=171. 171 is divisible by 3 (1+7+1=9), so not prime.

n=14:

n²=196.

n²+1=197. Let's check if 197 is prime. Hmm, 197 divided by primes up to sqrt(197) (~14). 197 ÷2? No. 3? 1+9+7=17, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, no. 7: 7*28=196, so 7*28+1=197. So 197 is a prime.

n²+2=198, which is even, so not prime.

So the primes that satisfy the condition are 101 and 197.

Wait, let me double-check for n=11. n=11 gives 122 and 123, both non-primes.

Wait, wait, wait—am I considering all possible n's? What about n=9? Because for n=9, n²=81. n²+1=82 (even, not prime), and n²+2=83. 83 is a prime, but wait: 83 is between 81+1=82 and 81+2=83. Wait, but 83 is less than 100, so it's not in our range (100-200). So we can ignore it.

Similarly for n=8: n²=64. n²+2=66, which is even, not prime. n²+1=65, which is 5x13, not prime.

n=7: 7²=49.

n²+1=50 (even), not prime.

n²+2=51 (divisible by 3), not prime.

n=6: 36. n²+1=37 (prime), but 37 is below 100. n²+2=38, even.

n=5: 25.

n²+1=26 (even), not prime. n²+2=27 (divisible by 3), not prime.

n=4: 16.

n²+1=17 (prime), but below 100. n²+2=18 (even).

n=3: 9.

n²+1=10 (even), n²+2=11 (below 100).

n=2: 4.

n²+1=5, n²+2=6.

n=1: 1.

n²+1=2 (below 100), n²+2=3 (below 100).

So the only primes in the range 100-200 that fit are 101 and 197. So the sum would be 101 + 197 = 298.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 245 and D is 400, etc. Wait, wait, I thought 101 and 197 sum to 298, which is option C. But looking at the options again, none of the options are 298 except option C.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, 101 + 197 is 298. So the sum is 298, which is option C.

But wait, did I miss any other primes in the range? Let me check another approach.

What about numbers like 103? Wait, 103 is 10² + 3, so not 1 or 2 more than a square. So 103 isn't considered.

Wait, but wait—let me think if I missed any n's. Oh, wait, what about n=12: 144. 144 +1=145, which is 5*29, not prime. 144 +2=146, which is 2*73, not prime.

n=13: 169. 169+1=170, not prime. 169+2=171, 9*19, not prime.

n=14: 196. 196+1=197 (prime), 196+2=198 (even). So only 197.

Wait, but what about n=15: 225, but that's over 200, so not considered.

So I think 101 and 197 are the only primes in the range that meet the condition.

So their sum is 101 + 197 = 298, which is option C.

The primes between 100 and 200 that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square are 101 and 197. Their sum is 298.

Answer: C: 298
