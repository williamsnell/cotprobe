Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A truck driver was assigned to drive a huge tractor- trailer loaded with logs. The logs were being sold by a lumber company, which had loaded the tractor- trailer. After four hours of steady driving, the truck driver stopped at a lounge and consumed five bottles of beer. He left the tavern in an intoxicated condition and then drove off to make his final delivery. As he came to the top of a steep incline in the highway and started his descent, an 11-year-old girl suddenly darted out into the road directly in front of him. The truck driver slammed on his powerful air brakes and swerved sharply to the left to avoid hitting her, but the girl was struck by the tractor- trailer and was seriously injured. The girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the lumber company to recover damages for the girl's injuries. At trial, which of the following is LEAST likely to be admissible?

Options:

A: Evidence that the truck driver completed a state-approved alcohol education program, if the driver claims that he was not intoxicated.
B: Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the lumber company and truck driver argue that the latter was not negligent.
C: Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.
D: Evidence that the girl had darted into the road in front of vehicles before, if the parents argue that she was frightened by the truck.
E: Evidence that the truck driver had a previous conviction for a DUI five years ago.
F: Evidence of the girl's school records, if her parents argue that she was a cautious child.
G: Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the lumber company argues that the truck driver was an independent contractor.
H: Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone at the time of the accident, if the lumber company argues that the driver was distracted.
I: Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of DUI arising from this incident.
J: Evidence that the lumber company had previously been fined for overloading their trucks, if the lumber company argues that the truck was not overloaded.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about a law of liability, specifically involving a truck driver and a truck trailer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a truck driver was driving a tractor trailer with logs from a lumber company. After four hours, he stopped and drank, then drove off. He was intoxicated when he saw an 11-year-old girl darted in front of him. He swerved left to avoid her, but the trailer hit her, causing serious injury. The parents of the girl are suing the lumber company for damages. The question is which evidence is least likely to be admissible at trial.

The options are A through J, each offering a piece of evidence. I need to figure out which one isn't admissible based on common law principles.

Let's go through each option:

A: Evidence that the truck driver completed an alcohol education program. If he says he wasn't drunk, this would be a defense, but if the driver claims he was not intoxicated, is this admissible? Wait, I think if a driver says they were not intoxicated, it's a defense. If the driver's defense is that they completed an education program, that's not admissible. Because evidence of completed education is against the statute of fraud. Statute of fraud requires a reasonable belief that the person was intoxicated before driving. So if the driver says they didn't, that's against the statute of fraud. So this would likely be inadmissible unless it's a police report or something, but the question says this is evidence the driver claims he wasn't. So this is probably not admissible because it's an against-the-statute-of-fraud defense.

B: Evidence that the truck driver's reputation is poor. The truck driver argues that he wasn't negligent. No, that's not admissible because reputation is about the credibility of the driver's past actions. If the driver is not negligent, the reputation isn't the issue. The relevant issue is whether the trucker was at fault for the accident.

C: Evidence that the lumber company has liability insurance. If the company says they don't own the truck, the insurance would be irrelevant. But wait, the question says the company's insurance company testified that they deny ownership. So if the company doesn't own the truck, then liability isn't based on their insurance. The liability would be on the driver's fault, not the company's. So if the company is arguing that they don't own the truck, and the insurance is irrelevant because they don't own it, then this evidence is not admissible. So C is probably not admissible.

D: Evidence that she had darted in front of vehicles before. The parents argue she was cautious. If she was cautious, there's no evidence of negligence or intent, so this isn't admissible.

E: Evidence of alcohol use. The truck driver claims he had a previous DUI five years ago. If he was on his drug tape, that's against the law for overloading. So this evidence is admissible.

F: School records. The parents argue she was cautious. No, school records are for criminal cases. School records don't help with negligence in a traffic accident. So F is not admissible.

G: Evidence that the company has liability insurance. If the company claims they don't own the truck, then liability would be their company's fault, not their. So this is relevant because the trucker is at fault. So G is admissible.

H: Evidence that he was on his phone. The parent argues he was distracted. If he was texting, that's a factor in negligence. So this evidence is admissible.

I: Evidence that he pleaded guilty to DUI. If he did, that's a defense to liability. If the driver was accused of DUI, then it's a defense. But the question is about evidence admissibility. The evidence that he pleaded guilty is against the statute of fraud, so it's not admissible unless it's a police report, but the question says this is evidence the driver claims he was on his phone. So I is likely not admissible.

J: Evidence that the company was over loaded. The company argues the truck wasn't overloaded. But if the company is arguing they didn't overload, that's against the law. So this evidence is inadmissible.

So now, the question is asking which is least likely to be admissible. Let's list the options:

A: Against statute of fraud.
B: Not admissible because the reputation of the driver isn't relevant.
C: If the company doesn't own the truck, the insurance is irrelevant. Admissible only if the company does own it, which they don't. So this is not admissible.

D: Not admissible because it's not evidence of negligence.
E: Admissible because DUI is under the law.
F: Not admissible because school records don't help with negligence.
G: Admissible because the claim is for negligence.
H: Admissible because it's about causing harm.
I: Admissible because it's a defense.
J: Admissible because it's about overloading, which is against the law.

Wait, wait. Wait, the question is about which is least likely to be admissible. So I need to find the option that is against the law or doesn't fit the criteria of admissibility.

Looking back:

Option A: If the driver says he wasn't drunk, that's against the statute of fraud. So this evidence is against the law. So it's likely to be inadmissible unless it's a police report.

Option C: If the company says they don't own the truck, then liability isn't theirs. So this is admissible because the company's liability is based on their own judgment.

Wait, the question is which is least likely to be admissible.

So the options that are against the law are:

A: Against the law (statute of fraud)
C: If the company doesn't own the truck, then liability isn't theirs. So if company says they don't own it, then this is inadmissible because no liability would be against them.

Wait, the question is about which is least likely to be admissible. So the least likely would be an against-the-statute-of-fraud situation.

Wait, but the options are about what's least likely to be admissible. So looking at the options:

Option A is against the law, so it can't be admitted. So it's least likely to be admissible.

Option C is about whether the company owns the truck. If the company says they don't, then liability isn't theirs. So if the company is claiming they don't own the truck, then this evidence is admissible because it's regarding the company's liability. So this is admissible.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the company argues that they don't own the truck, then liability isn't theirs. So the company's liability is a separate matter. So evidence that the company has liability insurance on the trailer is relevant because it would show that the company is at fault. So if the company is on the hook, the evidence is admissible.

So the least likely is either A or C or another option.

Wait, the question is, which is least likely to be admissible. So let's list the options and their admissibility:

A: Against statute of fraud. So this is not admissible. Because if the driver says they weren't drunk, it's against the law. So this evidence is against the law, so it can't be admitted.

B: Not relevant. The reputation isn't about negligence.

C: If the company doesn't own the truck, then liability isn't theirs. So if the company is saying they don't own it, then this is inadmissible because it's about the company's liability, which would be irrelevant. So if the company says they don't own the truck, the liability is on the trucker, so evidence of the company's liability is admissible.

Wait, but the issue is whether the company's liability is to be admitted. If the company says they don't own the trailer, then the company isn't at fault. So the liability is on the driver. So the evidence that the company has liability insurance is relevant. So C is admissible.

D: Not admissible because it's not evidence of negligence.

E: Admissible because DUI is under the law.

F: Not admissible because school records don't help.

G: Admissible because it's about negligence.

H: Admissible because it's about intent.

I: Admissible as it's a defense.

J: Admissible because overloading is against the law.

So the least likely to be admissible is option A. But wait, why? Because if the driver says he was not intoxicated, that's against the statute of fraud, so that evidence is against the law, making it inadmissible.

Wait, but the question is which is least likely to be admissible. So A is against the law, so it's not admissible. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other points? For example, is the company's liability evidence admissible if they don't own the trailer?

Yes, because the company's insurance is separate from the trucker's. So if they argue they don't own it, then liability isn't theirs. So the evidence is about the company's insurance, not about liability against them. So in that case, the company's liability isn't being used for this purpose, so the evidence is admissible. So C is admissible.

So the only one that's against the law is A. So the least likely is A.

Wait, but in the options, the question is which is least likely to be admissible. So, the options are which is least likely to be admitted.

So the options are:

A: Against the law.

B: Not admissible.

C: Admissible.

D: Not admissible.

E: Admissible.

F: Not admissible.

G: Admissible.

H: Admissible.

I: Admissible.

J: Admissible.

So the options that are not admissible are A, B, D, F, J, and I. But wait, I is against the law, so it's not admissible.

Wait, I thought I was against the law. So the least likely is A and I.

Wait, no. Because I is against the law, so it can't be admitted. So both A and I are against the law, making them least likely to be admitted.

Wait, but the question is which is least likely. So the options that are against the law are A, I, and J.

Wait, J is about overloading. J says the company had previously been fined for overloading. That's against the law. So J is against the law, making it least likely to be admitted.

So J's evidence is against the law, so it can't be admitted. So J is the least likely to be admitted.

Wait, but option J says "Evidence that the lumber company had previously been fined for overloading their trucks." If the company's claim is that they were overloading, that's against the law. So this evidence is against the law, so it can't be admitted. So J is the least likely.

Wait, but earlier I thought A was against the law. So now I'm confused between A and J.

Wait, the question is asking which is least likely to be admissible. So which of the options is against the law and can't be used to prove liability.

So J says the company was fined for overloading. That's against the law, so this evidence is likely to be inadmissible.

So the least likely is J.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Against the law.

B: Not admissible.

C: Admissible.

D: Not.

E: Admissible.

F: Not.

G: Admissible.

H: Admissible.

I: Admissible.

J: Against the law.

So the least likely to be admitted are A, J, and perhaps others.

Wait, but the question is about which evidence is least likely to be admissible. So the options are:

Which of the following is least likely to be admissible?

So, looking at the options:

A: Against statute of fraud, so definitely inadmissible.

B: Not admissible.

C: Admissible.

D: Not admissible.

E: Admissible.

F: Not.

G: Admissible.

H: Admissible.

I: Admissible.

J: Admissible? No, J is against the law, so inadmissible.

So J is the least likely because it's against the law.

Wait, but J says " evidence that the company had previously been fined for overloading." If the company is arguing that they were overloading, then their claim is against the law. So this evidence is not admissible.

So J is least likely.

Wait, but the options are A through J, and the question is which is least likely to be admissible. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options.

Wait, let me think again. The question is, which is least likely to be admissible.

So from the options, the ones that are against the law are:

A: Against the law (statute of fraud).

J: Against the law (overloading).

So these are the ones that can't be admitted.

Now, the other options:

B: Not admissible because it's about reputation.

D: Not admissible because it's not evidence of negligence.

F: Not admissible because it's not evidence of negligence.

G: Admissible because it's about liability.

H: Admissible because it's about intent.

I: Admissible because it's a defense.

C: Admissible because it's about the company's insurance.

So the least likely are A, J.

Wait, but the question is which is least likely to be admissible. So the options are:

A: Against law.

J: Against law.

So the options are A, J, and perhaps F, B, D, etc.

Wait, no. The question is, which is least likely to be admissible. So among the options, which one is against the law and therefore can't be used.

So the options that can't be admitted are those that are against the law.

So the options that are against the law are A and J.

So the question is, which is least likely. So between A and J, which of them is least likely to be admitted.

But wait, the question is about which is least likely to be admissible. So the options that are against the law are both least likely. But since the options are only one answer, perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, let's think again about each option.

Looking at option A: Evidence that the trucker was not intoxicated. If the driver claims they weren't, that's against the law. So this evidence is inadmissible.

Option J: Evidence that the company was fined because of overloading. That's against the law, so J is inadmissible.

So between A and J, which is least likely? Both are inadmissible. But the question is which one is least likely. So perhaps the question is a bit more nuanced.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The other options are about whether the evidence is admissible. For example, option J's evidence is against the law, so it's inadmissible. So the least likely would be J.

Wait, but the question is about which of the following is least likely to be admissible. So the correct answer is J because it's against the law.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the trucker's liability. The parent's argument is that the trailer was at fault. So the evidence that the company had a fine for overloading is about the company's liability. So if the company is arguing that they were overloading, then this evidence is against the law, making it inadmissible. So J is inadmissible.

But the question is, which is least likely to be admissible. So if I'm choosing from the options, J is least likely because it's against the law, while others are about whether the evidence is admissible (like A is against the law, so inadmissible; J is also against the law, so inadmissible). So the question is asking which is least likely to be admissible, so both A and J are inadmissible.

Wait, but in the options, the question is looking for which is least likely, so perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering whether the evidence is admissible. For example, if J is against the law, it's inadmissible, but if it's admissible in another way, perhaps not. But I think the key is that J is against the law, so it's inadmissible.

Wait, but the question is about which is least likely to be admissible. So the answer is J.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Against the law.

J: Against the law.

So the least likely to be admitted is J because it's against the law.

But wait, perhaps the question is a bit different.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the least likely is J because it's about overloading, which is against the law. So this is inadmissible.

So the correct answer is J.
</think>

To determine which evidence is least likely to be admissible, we analyze each option based on legal principles:

### Option A: Evidence that the trucker completed a state-approved alcohol education program, if the driver claims he was not intoxicated.
- **Analysis**: If the driver claims they were not intoxicated, this is against the statute of fraud. The statute requires a reasonable belief that the person was intoxicated before driving. Therefore, this evidence is **admissible only if it is against the statute of fraud**. However, since the claim is against the statute of fraud, this evidence is **inadmissible**.

### Option B: Evidence that the trucker's reputation for driving is poor, if the lumber company and trucker argue that the latter was not negligent.
- **Analysis**: The reputation of the trucker's driving is irrelevant to the claim of negligence. If the trucker is not negligent, the reputation is not the basis for liability. Thus, this evidence is **inadmissible**.

### Option C: Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.
- **Analysis**: If the company denies ownership, liability isn't theirs. Thus, this evidence is **admissible**.

### Option D: Evidence that the darted in front of vehicles before, if the parents argue that she was cautious.
- **Analysis**: Cautious behavior is not evidence of negligence. Thus, this evidence is **inadmissible**.

### Option E: Evidence that the truck driver pressed guilty to a criminal charge of DUI arising from this incident.
- **Analysis**: If the driver is accused of DUI, this is a defense. However, if the driver pleads guilty, this is a defense to liability. Thus, this evidence is **admissible**.

### Option F: Evidence that the truck driver had a bad reputation for driving, if the truck driver argues that he was not negligent.
- **Analysis**: The trucker's reputation is irrelevant to the claim of negligence. Thus, this evidence is **inadmissible**.

### Option G: Evidence that the girl darted in front of vehicles before, if the truck driver argues that she was not negligent.
- **Analysis**: This evidence is relevant to the claim of negligence. Thus, this evidence is **admissible**.

### Option H: Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone at the time of the accident, if the truck driver argues that he was not negligent.
- **Analysis**: If the driver is not negligent, this evidence is irrelevant. Thus, this evidence is **inadmissible**.

### Option I: Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to DUI, if the truck driver argues that he was on his phone.
- **Analysis**: If the truck driver pleads guilty, this is a defense to liability. Thus, this evidence is **admissible**.

### Option J: Evidence that the lumber company had previously been fined for overloading, if the company argues that they don't own the truck.
- **Analysis**: If the company argues they don't own the truck, the evidence that they were overfed is irrelevant. Thus, this evidence is **inadmissible**.

### Conclusion:
The evidence that is least likely to be admissible is **Option A** because it is against the statute of fraud. However, the question appears to ask for the least likely among all options, and **Option J** is also against the law. Since both A and J are against the law, the least likely to be admitted is **Option J**, as it is more directly against the law.
