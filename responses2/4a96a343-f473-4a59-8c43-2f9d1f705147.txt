Question:

In the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico are black lava formations surrounded by light-colored sandy desert. Pocket mice inhabit both areas. Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?

Options:

A: The light-colored mice evolved from the dark-colored mice over time.
B: The color of the mice is determined by their diet in the lava formations and desert.
C: The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.
D: The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.
E: Selection favors some phenotypes over others.
F: The two varieties of mice have always existed separately and did not share a common ancestor.
G: Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.
H: The mice were originally light-colored, but some darkened over time to blend into the lava formations.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about the Tularosa Basin in New Mexico. Hmm, I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two areas in the Tularosa Basin: one has black lava formations surrounded by sandy desert. Pocket mice live there. The dark mice are in the lava, and the light-colored ones are in the desert. The question is asking which statement is correct about this scenario.

The options are A to H. I'm going to think through each one.

Option A: The light-colored mice evolved from the dark-colored mice over time. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I thought dark mice live in a different environment, so maybe their color changed. But the problem says they're different species. So A can't be right because it implies a common ancestor, which isn't stated.

Option B: The color of the mice is determined by their diet in the lava and desert. That sounds plausible. Because if the mice are dark in lava and light in desert, their diet would influence their coloration. So B might be correct.

Option C: The two varieties descended from a recent common ancestor. No, I don't think so. Usually, different species split from a common ancestor. This seems to suggest that the mice changed color without a common ancestor, which isn't the case here.

Option D: The mouse population was originally one that diverged into two species due to mutations. Well, mutations do bring changes, but this question is more about natural selection and environment. So D might not be the best choice here.

Option E: Selection favors some phenotypes. Selection favors certain traits. In this case, the coloration probably selected based on what was available. So E is correct, but I need to look at the other options to see if another is better.

Option F: The two varieties have always existed separately and didn't share a common ancestor. No, there's a time when they were both present. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Originally, mice were dark, and some darkened because that color was favorable in lava. That makes sense. If the dark color was a preferred option there, maybe the dark mice evolved from a common ancestor. But wait, the question says the mice are in two different areas. So I'm confused now. So the correct scenario would be that the dark mice evolved into a different species because their color changed due to the environment. So option G is about a shared ancestor that evolved, which would imply a different scenario than the question. So G's statement might be correct if both are from a common ancestor but different colors. But wait, the question says they are different species, so perhaps the dark mice are another species. Hmm.

Wait, the question says they're different species. So option B says the color is determined by diet, which could be correct. Also, option G says dark mice were originally dark and some darkened because that color favored in lava. That fits with the scenario.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's about evolution from a common ancestor. So the correct answer would be between B and G.

Wait, the scenario is that in the Tularosa Basin, the dark mice are in lava, and the light are in desert. So they're different species. So their coloration is due to diet. So B is about their color being determined by diet. So that's correct.

But what about the other options? Option G says they were originally dark, and some darkened. That implies a recent change, which would require a common ancestor. But the question doesn't state that. The scenario is that they are different species, each in their own environment. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but then why would G be correct? Because if dark mice were originally dark and evolved into light, that would require a common ancestor. But the question states that the mice are in two different areas, so they are different species. So option G is incorrect.

Wait, but the initial hypothesis for G is that they were originally dark and some darkened. That's possible if there was a recent mutation that changed their color, but the question says they are different species and not from a common ancestor. So G's statement would not be correct.

So now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is about the color pattern of the mice. The options are about their origin and the reasons for their coloration.

Option B: mice color is determined by diet. That seems correct because in different environments, their diet changes, leading to coloration. So the mice's color is influenced by their diet. So B is correct.

Option G says that they were originally dark and some darkened. So that's about evolution from a common ancestor. But the question says the two species are in different parts of the basin. So their coloration must be determined by their diet, not by a common ancestor. So G is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be B.

Wait, but I also need to consider option F: mice were always separate. No, because the question says they inhabit both areas. So F is incorrect.

Option E: selection favors some phenotypes. That's correct too, but the question is about what's correct about the scenario, not about general selection. So E is correct, but the question is about the scenario, not about general biology.

So the correct answer is B.

The question involves the coloration of pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin, where dark mice inhabit lava formations and light mice inhabit sandy deserts. The task is to identify the correct statement about this scenario.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The colors of the mice do not imply a common ancestor, as they are in different environments. This suggests a divergence, not evolution from a common ancestor.
- **Option B**: Correct. The coloration of the mice is determined by their diet in different environments, and this explanation aligns with the scenario.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The mice are different species, not derived from a recent common ancestor.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While mutations may influence coloration, this is not the primary explanation for the scenario, as it involves diet and environment rather than mutations.
- **Option E**: Correct. Selection does favor certain phenotypes based on availability in specific environments. However, this is a general biological principle and not the specific explanation for the scenario.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The mice were not always separate; they inhabit both areas, indicating they are different species.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The mice were originally dark, but their coloration changed due to environmental factors, not a common ancestor. This contradicts the scenario.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The mice were not originally light-colored. Their color change was due to diet and environment, not a recent mutation.

The most accurate statement is **Option B**, as it directly explains the coloration mechanism based on diet in different environments.

**ANSWER: B**
