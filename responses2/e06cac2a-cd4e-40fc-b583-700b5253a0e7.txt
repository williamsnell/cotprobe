Alright, so I'm trying to answer this question about behavior disorders that are genetically inherited. The options are A: Hemiplegia, B: Anxiety Disorders, C: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and D: Adjustment Disorders. 

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that genetic disorders are those that are passed down from parents to offspring, based on specific genes. The question is asking for specific disorders where the behavior is influenced by genetics.

Starting with option A: Hemiplegia. I think hemiplegia is a condition where a person can't walk a certain leg, like a paralysis. I seem to recall that hemiplegia can be caused by genetic mutations. For example, in some cases, a mutation in the HPAH gene leads to a severe form of hemiplegia called hemiplegic polyphagia. So A could be a possible answer.

Option B: Anxiety Disorders. These are a broad category, but I don't think they're strictly genetic. They can result from various factors like environment, genetics, or environment. For instance, anxiety disorders can be influenced by family history (genetic) or by external stressors. So B doesn't fit the specific description of the question.

Option C: PTSD. PTSD, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, is definitely a genetic disorder. It's caused by the body's response to traumatic events and is influenced by family history, environment, and genetics. So C is another possible answer.

Option D: Adjustment Disorders. These are more about how people interact with others. I'm not sure if they're genetic. They can be influenced by family dynamics, environment, and other factors, but not as definitively as the others. So D might not be the best fit.

So the question is asking for various behavior disorders, which are genetic. Hemiplegia and PTSD fit that because they're heritable. Adjustment disorders might not be as strictly genetic, but they can be influenced by genetic factors. However, the other options are more likely to be genetic. So the best answers would be A and C.

The answer is **C: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** and **A: Hemiplegia**.

**Explanation:**
- **A: Hemiplegia** is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the HPAH gene, leading to paralysis.
- **C: PTSD** is a genetic disorder influenced by family history, environment, and genetic factors, resulting from the body's reaction to trauma.
