Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question. The question is asking which procedure an accountant would least likely perform during an engagement to review a nonissuer's financial statements. Hmm, let me go through each option step by step.

First, the options are A to I, and the correct answer needs to be one of them. Let's break it down.

Option A: Assessing the company's risk management procedures. I remember that risk management is crucial for audits. An accountant would definitely look into how well the company controls risks. So this seems like something they'd do, so probably not the answer.

Option B: Making inquiries of management about actions taken at board meetings. Board meetings are part of internal company activities, and because they're internal, the accountant might need to find out what management did, especially if there were concerns. So this is likely a procedure they would perform, so not the answer.

Option C: Identifying internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements. Internal controls are a core part of financial auditing. The accountant would definitely need to review these to ensure they're effective. So this is something they would do, so not the answer.

Option D: Study the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns. This sounds like something to check for consistency. The accountant would look at how the numbers relate to each other, like revenue to expenses, to see if they make sense. This is part of due diligence, so they'd do this. So not the answer.

Option E: Reviewing the company's tax returns for the period. Tax returns are part of the financial statements and are audited. So an accountant would definitely check these to make sure they're accurate. So E is a procedure they'd perform, so not the answer.

Option F: Interviewing employees about their job responsibilities. Wait, employees' job responsibilities are more about the role and expectations rather than the financial statements. The accountant's role is more about the financial data, so they wouldn't need to interview employees. This seems like the least likely procedure. So F might be the correct answer.

Option G: Evaluating the company's compliance with regulations. Compliance is a key concern for auditors. They would check if the company meets all regulations, so G is definitely something they'd do. Not the answer.

Option H: Checking for mathematical accuracy in the company's ledgers. Leadgers are where the data is stored, and checking for errors is part of the audit process. The accountant would do this to ensure data integrity. So H is a procedure they'd perform, so not the answer.

Option I: Comparing financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts. This is standard due diligence. The accountant would review the financials against what was expected to see if there are discrepancies. So I is a procedure they'd perform, so not the answer.

Wait, but reviewing the company's tax returns (option E) is also a part of due diligence. So which is more likely to be something an accountant would skip? Since it's about the company's financials, the accountant would review these to ensure they're correct. So F, interviewing employees' job responsibilities, is more about the person's role than the financial data. So the accountant wouldn't need to do that, making F the correct answer.

The accountant would least likely perform the procedure in option F, interviewing employees about their job responsibilities. This is because interviewing employees focuses on their roles and expectations, which are not directly related to reviewing the financial statements. The accountant's role is more about analyzing financial data and ensuring its accuracy, as seen in options A through I.

**Answer: F**
