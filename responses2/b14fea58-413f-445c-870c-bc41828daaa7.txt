Question:

Discuss Fiedler's contingency model of leadership.

Options:

A: The model posits that leadership effectiveness arises from the leader's intelligence and experience, rather than the situation or their style.
B: The model asserts that leadership effectiveness is primarily a function of the leader's motivation rather than the situational context or their leadership style.
C: Fiedler's contingency model suggests that a leader's effectiveness is fixed and cannot be changed by understanding situational factors.
D: Fiedler's contingency model of leadership suggests that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent on the interaction between their style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations and the leader's power.
E: Fiedler's model suggests the effectiveness of a leader is determined solely by their personality.
F: According to the model, the only factor that determines a leader's effectiveness is their ability to communicate clearly and effectively with their team.
G: According to Fiedler, a leader's effectiveness is contingent upon the organization's culture.
H: Fiedler's model implies that a leader's effectiveness is determined by their ability to adapt their style to every situation.
I: Fiedler’s model indicates that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent solely on the economic status of the organization and has no relation to the leader’s style or situational variables.

Okay, so I've got this question about Fiedler's contingency model of leadership. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that Fiedler talked about leadership effectiveness being influenced by different factors. The model probably has something to do with the leadership style, the situation, and perhaps some other variables. I think the model is about how leadership effectiveness can be either effective or ineffective based on the situation and the leader's style.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. 

Option A says that leadership effectiveness is based on intelligence and experience, not the situation or style. That sounds a bit off because I thought the model suggested that other factors play a role too.

Option B claims effectiveness is about motivation, not situational factors or style. Hmm, but I don't think Fiedler's model is about motivation. He was more about style and environment.

Option C suggests the effectiveness is fixed and can't change. I don't recall that being the case. Fiedler's model implies that leadership effectiveness can be influenced by various factors, so this might not be correct.

Option D: According to the model, effectiveness depends on the leader's style and three situational factors. That sounds like what I remember. So D sounds right.

Wait, let me think again. Fiedler's model, as I recall, was about three factors: the style of leadership, the structure of the task, and the leader's power. So, yes, the effectiveness is contingent on these three factors. So D says that, which fits.

Option E says effectiveness is determined by personality, but I don't think so. Fiedler's model is about style and task, not personal traits.

Option F talks about communication as the only factor. I know Fiedler's model was about the combination of style and environment, not just communication. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says effectiveness is based on the organization's culture. I don't think Fiedler thought that the company's culture was the main factor. His model was more about individual leadership styles and the environment.

Option H claims effectiveness depends on adapting to every situation. That doesn't fit—Fiedler's model suggests that it depends on combination of style and environment, not just adapting.

Option I says effectiveness is solely based on economic status. No, that doesn't make sense. Fiedler's model was more about structure and style.

So putting it all together. The correct answer must be option D. It aligns with Fiedler's model where leadership effectiveness depends on the leader's style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations, and leader's power.

The correct answer is **D: Fiedler's contingency model suggests that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent on the interaction between their style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations, and the leader's power.**

**Answer:** D
