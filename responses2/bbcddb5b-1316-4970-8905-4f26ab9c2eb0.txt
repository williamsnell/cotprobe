Okay, so I have this algebra problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that for some numbers a, b, c, the sum a + b + c is equal to 1. Also, the sum of their pairwise products, ab + ac + bc, is -4. And the product abc is also given as -4. The question is asking for the value of a³ + b³ + c³. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that there's a formula related to the sum of cubes. Let me try to recall what it is. I think it involves the sum, sum of products, and the product of the variables. Oh right, I think the formula is something like a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Does that sound right?

Wait, let me make sure. So, expanding (a + b + c)³, I get a³ + b³ + c³ plus three times the sum of the products of each pair each taken three at a time, which would be 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b). Hmm, but that might not be the most straightforward approach.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Yeah, that seems correct. Because when you expand (a + b + c)³, it actually includes all the terms you'll get from each of the three factors. So when you subtract 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc), you're removing some of the cross terms, leaving you with the sum of cubes plus the other terms. But wait, maybe I should think of it another way.

Wait, another approach is using the identity: a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc). But I'm not sure if that helps here. Maybe I should stick with the first formula I thought of.

So let's write down what we have:

We know a + b + c = 1. So (a + b + c) is 1.

The sum ab + ac + bc is -4. So that's -(4).

And the product abc is -4.

We need to find a³ + b³ + c³.

Using the formula I mentioned earlier: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Let me plug in the values:

First, (a + b + c)³ is 1³, which is 1.

Then, 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) is 3 * 1 * (-4) = 3 * (-4) = -12.

Wait, but in the formula, it's subtracting 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc), so it's 1 - (-12) because the formula is (1) - [3*(-4)] = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, we have +3abc, which is 3*(-4) = -12.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me redo that step.

Wait, the formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So substituting the known values:

= (1)³ - 3*(1)*(-4) + 3*(-4)
= 1 - (-12) + (-12)
Wait, wait, that can't be right because 3*(1)*(-4) is -12, and then multiplied by 3? No, wait, no.

Wait, no, the formula is (a + b + c)³ minus 3 times (a + b + c) times (ab + ac + bc), plus 3 times abc.

So it's 1 minus [3*(1)*(-4)] plus [3*(-4)].

Calculating each part:

3*(1)*(-4) = -12. So 1 - (-12) is 1 + 12 = 13.

Then, 3*(-4) is -12. So 13 + (-12) = 1.

Wait, so that gives me 1 as the value of a³ + b³ + c³. So the answer should be option I, which is 1.

Alternatively, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me think of another way to approach this.

Another way is to consider that if a, b, c are roots of a cubic equation. Then the equation would be x³ - (a + b + c)x² + (ab + ac + bc)x - abc = 0. So substituting the known values, the equation would be x³ - (1)x² + (-4)x - (-4) = x³ - x² -4x +4 = 0.

Now, if a, b, c are roots of this equation, then for each root, a³ = a² +4a -4, and similarly for b³ and c³. So adding them up:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a² + b² + c²) + 4(a + b + c) - 3*4

Wait, because each a³ is a² +4a -4, so three terms would be 3a² +3b² +3c² + 4(a + b + c) -12.

Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since a³ = a² +4a -4, then adding all three:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a² + b² + c²) +4(a + b + c) - 12.

But I don't know what a² + b² + c² is. Alternatively, maybe I can find a² + b² + c² using the formula (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, (1)² = (a² + b² + c²) + 2*(-4).

So 1 = (a² + b² + c²) -8.

Then, a² + b² + c² = 1 +8 =9.

So substituting back into the expression for a³ + b³ + c³:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 9 + 4*(1) -12 = 9 +4 -12 = (13) -12 =1.

So that also gives me 1. So this method also confirms that the sum is 1.

Therefore, the answer should be option I: 1.

The problem requires finding \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \) given \( a + b + c = 1 \), \( ab + ac + bc = -4 \), and \( abc = -4 \). Using the algebraic identity for the sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
= 1^3 - 3(1)(-4) + 3(-4) = 1 + 12 - 12 = 1
\]

Thus, the answer is 1, which corresponds to option I.
