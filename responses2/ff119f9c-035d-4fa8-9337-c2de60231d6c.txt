Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I marvel not a little, right worshipful, that since the first discovery of America (which is now full four score and ten years), after so great conquests and plantings of the Spaniards and Portuguese there, that we of England could never have the grace to set fast footing in such fertile and temperate places as are left as yet unpossessed of them. But . . . I conceive great hope that the time approacheth and now is that we of England may share and part stakes [divide the prize] (if we will ourselves) both with the Spaniard and the Portuguese in part of America and other regions as yet undiscovered.
"And surely if there were in us that desire to advance the honor of our country which ought to be in every good man, we would not all this while have [neglected] the possessing of these lands which of equity and right appertain unto us, as by the discourses that follow shall appear most plainly."
â€”Richard Hakluyt, Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent, 1582

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Richard Hakluyt's passage from "Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent." The question is asking which of the given options the passage most closely reflects the influence of. The options are A through J, each representing a different philosophical or political theory.

First, I need to understand the passage. The passage is about Hakluyt's beliefs regarding the discovery of America. He talks about England's ability to establish a foothold in the new lands, despite the Spanish and Portuguese plantations. He also mentions a desire to share stakes with them, implying that their support might help.

I remember that Richard Hakluyt was a 17th-century English scientist and writer. His works were influential in the exploration of the Americas. His ideas were part of the broader scientific and philosophical movements of his time.

Looking at the options, I need to match the themes in the passage to the theories listed.

Option A: The Renaissance. Renaissance was a cultural movement focused on humanism, science, and ideals. Hakluyt was a proponent of scientific inquiry and empiricism, so this might be a match.

Option B: The Enlightenment's natural rights. The Enlightenment emphasized individual rights and the importance of reason. Hakluyt's ideas might not align with this because he's more about the social structure and the possibility of Manifest Destiny, which ties into the social contract theory or a different perspective.

Option C: The social contract theory. This was a later idea, more about what people agree to for the sake of the state, which I don't think was the focus of Hakluyt's work.

Option D: The political philosophy of absolutism. absolutism was the idea that governments are infallible and immune to change, which seems more tied to political philosophy and wider ideas of governance, not specifically the social contract.

Option E: Mercantilism. That's about trade, land, and the state. Hakluyt's work was more about exploration and discovery, not just trade.

Option F: Capitalism. Again, Hakluyt's main focus was on exploration and the possibility of Manifest Destiny, not economic policies.

Option G: Conversion theory. That's Christian or religious, about conversion of people. This doesn't seem related to the passage.

Option H: Predestination theory. Also religious, about divine will and natural laws. Not relevant here.

Option I: The theory of divine right of kings. That's about the divine power of a monarch to rule, which doesn't fit with Hakluyt's ideas.

Option J: Colonialism theory. That's about how nations take over territories. Hakluyt's passage is about the possibility of sharing American lands with other Spanish and Portuguese colonies, which aligns with the idea of expansion and the new nation's integration. So the passage reflects the influence of colonialism theory.

So putting it together: the passage discusses the belief in the possibility of sharing and dividing stakes (like dividing land) with other Spanish and Portuguese colonies, which is a big point in colonialism. Hakluyt was an advocate for the idea of Manifest Destiny and the expansion of the United States, which is closely tied to the theory of colonialism. Therefore, the influence is most closely reflected in J: The philosophy of colonialism.
