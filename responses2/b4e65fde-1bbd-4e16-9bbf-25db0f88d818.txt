Okay, so I've got this question here about happiness levels in different countries and the United States. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question presents two statements. 

Statement 1 says: In every country, people think other individuals in their country are less happy than they actually are. So, for example, in every country, people might think their neighbors are not as happy as they are. That sounds a bit odd to me. I mean, I know that people often have an illusion of reality, like believing their friends are not as happy because they're not. But does that apply to every country? Well, some countries might have more social bonds, like in places like Japan where people are very happy. Or maybe in some countries, people live in cities where they're surrounded by happy people. Or perhaps in countries where people live in more isolated areas, they might think others are unhappy. So I'm not sure if this is universally true. I could be wrong, but perhaps it's true because people often have an inaccurate perception of others' happiness. So I'll tentatively think statement 1 is true.

Statement 2 says: In the United States, women’s happiness has increased both absolutely and relatively to men. Wait, increasing both means that, for example, women are happier on average than men in the US. But I've read about studies where women's happiness might actually be lower than men's, or there might be significant differences. Oh, I remember hearing that women in the US live longer and have better health, but I'm not sure about their overall happiness. I think some studies suggest that women in the US might be less happy than men because of different social norms or economic factors. For example, societal expectations can influence how people perceive others. Maybe in the US, women's happiness isn't higher than men's. Or perhaps the increase is not in absolute terms but relative. Wait, the statement says both "absolutely and relative," which might be a bit confusing. Let me think: "absolutely" could mean higher in absolute terms, and "relatively" meaning higher relative to others. Or maybe it's a typo and meant to say that women's happiness has increased relative to men. But I'm not sure. I recall there have been some studies where women in the US might be less satisfied with life than men. For instance, in some surveys, women report lower levels of life satisfaction in the US compared to men. So if that's the case, statement 2 would be false because women's happiness has NOT increased relative to men. So the second statement is false.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, option E is "True, False," which matches. Let me double-check. Statement 1: true. Statement 2: false. So E is correct.

The analysis of the two statements leads to the conclusion:

- **Statement 1** is true because people often have inaccurate perceptions of others' happiness.
- **Statement 2** is false because, according to some studies, women in the US may report lower life satisfaction compared to men.

Thus, the correct answer is E: True, False.

**Answer: E**
