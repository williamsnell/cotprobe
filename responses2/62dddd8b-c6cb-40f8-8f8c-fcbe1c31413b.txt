Okay, so I've got this question about how much cat food Rob uses per month. Hmm. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days. I need to find out approximately how many boxes he uses in a month.

First, I should figure out how many 5-day periods are in a month. A month can vary, but I think the question is probably expecting a general calculation. Let's assume an average month has about 30 days. So, if Rob uses 1 box every 5 days, then how many boxes does he use in 30 days?

Wait, but months can have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. Maybe I should use 30 days for simplicity. So, 30 divided by 5 is 6. That would mean 6 boxes per month. But wait, I should check if that's accurate. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if a month is about 30 days, and he uses 1 box every 5 days, then 30/5 is 6. So 6 boxes. Looking at the options, option C is 6 boxes. But another approach is to consider if the month starts and ends on a day Rob uses the food. For example, if he starts on day 1, then on day 5, he uses a box, and so on. So in 30 days, it's 6 uses.

Wait, but maybe I should consider a different approach. Let's calculate how many weeks are in a month. Since a week has 7 days, 30 divided by 7 is about 4.28 weeks. But that doesn't directly help unless I know how much he uses per week. Alternatively, maybe the initial method is correct.

Wait, another way: if he uses 1 box every 5 days, then in 30 days, he uses 30/5 = 6 boxes. So 6 boxes per month, which is option C. Looking at the options, option C is 6 boxes. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but the options also include 5 boxes (B) and others. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to think is that 5 days per boxâ€”so in a month (30 days), that's 30/5 = 6. So 6 boxes. So the correct answer would be C, 6 boxes.

The correct answer is C, 6 boxes.
