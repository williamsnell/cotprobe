Question:

Trace language development during preschool age.

Options:

A: During preschool age, children learn an entirely new language spontaneously without prior exposure.
B: Language development during preschool age involves understanding complex grammatical rules without the ability to apply them in speech.
C: Language development during preschool age is limited to two-word sentences.
D: Preschool children develop the ability to write sentences before they can speak them.
E: Preschool children's language is limited to mimicking sounds without forming coherent words or sentences.
F: During preschool age, children only learn how to perfectly use grammar without developing their vocabulary.
G: During preschool age, children communicate exclusively through non-verbal means and gestures, with no advancement in spoken language.
H: At preschool age, children's vocabulary shrinks before it begins to grow again.
I: Language development regresses during preschool age.
J: During preschool age, the language development of the child progresses beyond the formation of two-word sentences. He begins to form three-word sentences and, from this point on, his language and grammar become more diverse and complex.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about language development in preschool age. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking about the progression of language development during preschool. I remember that early childhood is a time of rapid language development, especially for young children. So the options might relate to how they learn to talk, understand, and use language skills.

Option A says they learn a new language spontaneously without prior exposure. That seems unlikely because kids are exposed to many languages from birth. I don't think they learn entirely new languages on their own.

Option B talks about understanding complex grammatical rules without applying them. That makes sense. Preschoolers often grasp rules before they can use them correctly. Maybe they don't apply the rules yet, but they understand the structure.

Option C says language is limited to two-word sentences. I don't think that's right. Preschoolers can form longer sentences, like more complex ones. Two-word sentences are more basic.

Option D says they start writing sentences before speaking. I'm pretty sure they start speaking first, but they do write later. Maybe they can write simple sentences after they start talking, but writing isn't the same as speaking yet.

Option E mentions mimicking sounds without forming words or sentences. That's probably not right because children start making sounds and then learning to translate them into words. They also form sentences, like in a story.

Option F says they only learn grammar without vocabulary. That's not correct. Vocabulary is built along with grammar skills. Without vocabulary, they can't form sentences.

Option G says communication is non-verbal. That's not true. Preschoolers use a lot of gestures and speech; they don't just talk; they also draw or use body language.

Option H says vocabulary shrinks before growing. That doesn't make sense. Vocabulary typically increases from birth. At some point, it starts to develop, especially with simple words.

Option I says language regresses, meaning it gets worse. I don't think that's the case. Language development usually progresses, not regresss.

Option J says beyond two-word sentences, he starts three-word and then forms more complex sentences. I've read that children in preschool can form longer sentences, so J sounds plausible. But I'm not 100% certain.

Let me review. So, the key is that around 3 years, they start speaking, but they might still use simple sentences. By 5 or 6, they can form more complex sentences and understand longer grammatical structures. So the correct answer should be J, which says they start forming three-word sentences and beyond, leading to more complex language and grammar.

The correct answer is J: During preschool age, the language development of the child progresses beyond the formation of two-word sentences. He begins to form three-word sentences and, from this point on, his language and grammar become more diverse and complex.

Answer: J
