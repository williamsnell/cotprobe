Okay, so I'm faced with this economics question about nominal and real income. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that in Sherwood, the average price level tripled over a period. Robin's income went from $30,000 to $60,000. I need to figure out how Robin's nominal and real incomes changed.

First, I should recall what nominal and real income mean. Nominal income is what people actually earn, adjusted for inflation. Real income is the purchasing power, meaning how much they can buy with their income. If the price level goes up, that affects both nominal and real incomes.

So, the price level tripled. That means each dollar in Robin's income can buy three times as much as before. Let's break it down.

Starting with Robin's income: $30,000. If the price level triples, then the purchasing power of that income is reduced. Let's say the base year is 100 (for simplicity). In the previous year, the price level was 100, now it's 300.

For the nominal income: It's the actual money earned. So, $30,000 is still $30k in nominal terms. The real income calculation is income divided by the price level. So, before the price increase, real income was 30k / 100 = $300. After, it's 30k / 300 = $100. So, real income decreased by a third.

Wait, but actually, the question doesn't state the base year. Oh, but the way it's worded, it's about the effect of the price level tripled. So, from the previous period (base year), the price level becomes three times higher.

So, if Robin's income was $30k, in real terms, it's 30k / 3 = $10k. Wait, but actually, I think the base period isn't specified, so maybe we can think of it as the change in real income. Alternatively, the change in real income is calculated as the change in nominal income divided by the change in price level, but that's more complicated.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the real income before and after the price level change.

Let me think: Suppose the base year is 2023. Robin's nominal income in 2023 is $30k. The price level in 2024 (since it's tripled) is 3 times the base. So, the price level in 2024 is 300 (if 100 was base). So, the real income in 2024 is 30,000 / 300 = $100. So, from $30k to $10k. That's a significant decrease.

Alternatively, if the base year is 2023, the previous year's price level was 100. So, in 2024, the price level is 300. So, the real income in 2024 is 30,000 / 300 = $100. So, from $30k to $10k, a decrease of 2/3.

Wait, but the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the options are given as (A) through (J) with letters. I think the options are the letter answers.

So, looking at the options, the first column is the first part (e.g., for A, it's (G) Stayed the same, Increased). The second part is the second column, such as (B) Increased, Increased.

Wait, no, the options are given as (A) (G), (B) (B), etc. So, each option is two letters, the first for the first answer, the second for the second.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are labeled (A) through (J). Each option lists two letters, the first for the first part (e.g., (G), which is Stayed the same), and the second for the second part (e.g., (A), which is Increased).

So, the options are:

A: (G) Stayed the same, (A) Increased
B: (B) Increased, (B) Increased
C: (D) Increased, (C) Stayed the same
D: (J) Decreased, (E) Decreased
E: (F) Stayed the same, (E) Increased
Wait, no, looking back, the user presented the options as:

Options:

A: (G) Stayed the same, (A) Increased

Wait, perhaps the options are in the format of (X) (Y), where X is the first part (nominal) and Y the second (real). Or perhaps the options are options for how the nominal and real incomes changed.

Wait, the way the question is written is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read.

"In a given period the average price level in the country of Sherwood tripled and Robin's income increased from $30000 to $60000. What happened to Robin's nominal and real income? Nominal Income    Real Income"

So, the question is about both nominal and real income.

So, the options are probably something like (X) for how the nominal income changed, and (Y) for how the real income changed. Wait, but the user presented the options as (A), (B), etc., each with two letters. Hmm.

Wait, the options are presented as:

Options:

A: (G) Stayed the same, (A) Increased

Wait no, the user wrote:

Options:

A: (G) Stayed the same, (A) Increased

Wait, perhaps each option has two parts. Like:

Option A says that the nominal income stayed the same and the real income increased. But that doesn't make sense. Because if the price level went up, real income should decrease.

Wait, let me think. Let's assume that each option is a pair of letters, the first being the change in nominal income, the second being the change in real income.

So, for example, option A says: (G) Stayed the same, (A) Increased.

Wait, but how do we interpret the options? Let me look again.

Wait, the user presented the options as:

Options:

A: (G) Stayed the same     Increased
B: (B) Increased     Increased
C: (D) Increased     Stayed the same
D: (J) Decreased     Stayed the same
E: (F) Stayed the same     Decreased
F: (A) Increased     Decreased
G: (C) Decreased     Decreased
H: (I) Stayed the same     Stayed the same
I: (H) Decreased     Stayed the same
J: (E) Decreased     Increased

Wait, that makes sense. Each option is a pair of letters, the first for the first part (e.g., nominal), the second for the second part (e.g., real). So, for example:

A: (G) Stayed same, (A) Increased.

Wait, but that seems a bit unclear. Maybe the options are structured as (X) for the first part and (Y) for the second. But it's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps each option is a pair, with the first part being the change in nominal income (e.g., if it stayed the same) and the second part the change in real income (e.g., increased or decreased).

So, for example:

Option A says: (G) Stayed same, (A) Increased.

Hmm, that might not make much sense because if the price level tripled, real income should decrease, not increase.

Wait, maybe the first letter is the change in nominal income, the second the change in real income.

But let's proceed. Let me think about the original problem again.

The price level tripled. So, the base period, prices were P, now they are 3P.

Robin's income increased from 30,000 to 60,000. So, his nominal income increased by 2 times.

What was his real income before and after?

Real income = nominal income / price level.

So, before the price increase, his real income was (30,000) / P. After, it's (60,000) / (3P) = (60,000 / 3P) = 20,000 / P.

So, his real income went from 30,000/P to 20,000/P. So, it's (20,000 / P) compared to (30,000 / P), which is a decrease by a third.

So, real income decreased.

Now, what about nominal income? His nominal income went from 30,000 to 60,000, so it increased by a factor of 2.

So, nominal income increased, real decreased.

Looking at the options, which option says that?

Looking at the options presented:

Each option is a pair of letters. So for example, option A is (G) Stayed same, (A) Increased.

Wait, so (G) means the first part: stayed same. (A) means the second part: increased.

So, if both happened, that would be the case here. Or, if the first part is increased and the second is decreased.

Wait, the first part (nominal) increased, the second (real) decreased.

Looking through the options:

Options:

A: (G) Stayed same, (A) Increased → both not correct.

B: (B) Increased, (B) Increased → both incorrect.

C: (D) Increased, (C) Stayed same → incorrect.

D: (J) Decreased, (E) Decreased → both incorrect.

E: (F) Stayed same, (E) Increased → incorrect.

F: (A) Increased, (D) Decreased → wait, F is (A) (D) Decreased.

Wait, option F: (A) Increased, (D) Decreased. So, nominal increased, real decreased. That's our case.

So, which option is (A) Increased, (D) Decreased?

Looking through the list:

Looking at each option:

A: (G) Stayed same, (A) Increased → both not correct.

B: (B) Increased, (B) Increased → both incorrect.

C: (D) Increased, (C) Stayed same → no.

D: (J) Decreased, (E) Decreased → no.

E: (F) Stayed same, (E) Increased → no.

F: (A) Increased, (D) Decreased → yes. So, option F is (A) and (D). So, according to this, the correct answer is (F), which is (A) (D) Decreased.

Wait, but wait. The options are presented as pairs. So, option F is (A) (D) Decreased, which would mean nominal income increased (A) and real income decreased (D). So, the correct option is F.

Wait, but the initial problem says "What happened to Robin's nominal and real income?" So, the answer would be that nominal increased, real decreased.

Looking back, the options are:

F: (A) Increased, (D) Decreased.

Wait, no. No, the letters are part of the option. Each option is two letters, the first for nominal change, the second for real.

So, option F is (A) (D) → nominal increased (A), real decreased (D). So, that would fit.

In the options, option F is the correct one.

In Sherwood, the average price level tripled, and Robin's nominal income increased from $30,000 to $60,000. To determine how his real income changed, we calculate the effect of inflation. The real income is calculated as nominal income divided by the price level. Initially, Robin's real income was $10,000 (30,000 / 3), and after the price increase, it decreased to $20,000 (60,000 / 3). Thus, real income decreased. 

Analyzing the options, each is a pair of letters representing the change in nominal and real income, respectively. The correct pair is "Increased" for nominal income and "Decreased" for real income. Among the options, **F: (A) Increased, (D) Decreased** matches this description.

ANSWER: F
