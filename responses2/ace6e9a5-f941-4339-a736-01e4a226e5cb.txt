Okay, so I've got this question here about aggregate demand and marginal propensity to consume. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what each term means.

Aggregate demand (AD) refers to the total demand for final goods and services in an economy. It's composed of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The question is about how an increase in private investment affects this AD.

Wait, the question says 100 units of new autonomous private investment are added. Oh, so that's an autonomous expenditure. Autonomous means it doesn't depend on the level of income, so it's a fixed amount that the government or the central bank can inject into the economy.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is given as 0.90. MPC is the proportion of additional income that people spend on consumption. So, for every extra dollar of income, 90 cents is spent on consumption, and 10 cents is saved. 

I remember that the multiplier effect comes into play here. The multiplier tells us how much total income increases when there's an initial increase in autonomous spending. The formula for the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC). So, if MPC is 0.90, then 1 - 0.90 is 0.10. Taking the reciprocal, 1/0.10 is 10. So the multiplier is 10.

Wait a second, so each dollar of autonomous spending leads to a 10 times increase in total demand. So if we add 100 to AD, how much does that shift AD to the right? Let me think.

The initial addition is 100. The multiplier is 10, so the total increase in aggregate demand would be 100 multiplied by 10. 100 *10 is 1000. So the AD shifts to the right by 1000.

Looking at the options, option E is $1,000. So that's probably the answer.

The correct answer is **E: $1,000**, as the 100 units of autonomous investment, with a MPC of 0.90, leads to a total multiplier effect of 10. This results in a shift of aggregate demand to the right by 10 times 100, which is 1,000.

Answer: E
