Options:

A: From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier decreased from 4 to 3.

C: From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.
D: The marginal propensity to save increased from year 1 to year 2.
E: A given change in government spending would have had a less powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2.
F: In year 2, a $100 billion increase in government spending would have decreased real output by a maximum of $80 billion.
G: The marginal propensity to consume decreased from 0.75 in year 1 to 0.70 in year 2.
H: The marginal propensity to save decreased from year 1 to year 2.
I: In year 1, a $100 billion increase in government spending would have increased real output by a maximum of $75 billion.

Alright, so I've got this economics question here about the spending multiplier and marginal propensities. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the question says that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) increased from 0.75 in year 1 to 0.80 in year 2. Then, I need to figure out which of the options A to H correctly describe the implications of this change.

I remember that the spending multiplier is calculated as 1 divided by (1 - MPC). So, if MPC increases, the denominator (1 - MPC) decreases, which makes the multiplier bigger. Let's calculate the multipliers for both years.

In year 1, MPC is 0.75. So, 1 - 0.75 is 0.25. The multiplier is 1 / 0.25 = 4. That's correct. In year 2, MPC is 0.80. 1 - 0.80 is 0.20, so the multiplier is 5. So the spending multiplier went from 4 to 5. That means option C says it increased from 4 to 5, which is correct. So C is a possible correct answer.

But wait, let me check the other options as well.

Option A: Spending multiplier decreased from 4 to 3. That's wrong because the multiplier went up from 4 to 5.

Option B: In year 2, a $100 billion increase in government spending would have increased real output by a maximum of $75 billion. Wait, the multiplier is 5, so 100 * 5 is $500 billion. So B's statement is incorrect because it says $75, which is one fifth of 100. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the multiplier is 5, then increase in spending is 100, so output is increased by 500. So the statement says $75, which is incorrect. So B is wrong.

Option D: The marginal propensity to save increased from year 1 to year 2. Wait, marginal propensity to save is (1 - MPC). So in year 1, MPC is 0.75, so savings are 0.25. In year 2, 0.80, so savings are 0.20. So savings are decreasing. So D is incorrect.

Option E: A given change in government spending would have a less powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2. Wait, power is about size. The multiplier increased from 4 to 5, so a change in spending would have a bigger effect in year 2. So E's statement is wrong because year 1's effect was less.

Option F: In year 2, a $100 billion increase in government spending would have decreased real output by a maximum of $80 billion. Wait, no, because the spending multiplier is 5, so 100 * 5 is $500 billion. So the output change is $500. So F's statement that it's $80 is wrong. So F is incorrect.

Option G: M marginal prop to consume decreased from 0.75 to 0.70. No, that's not what happened. It went up from 0.75 to 0.80, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Marginal propensity to save decreased. As before, D is wrong, but H says it decreased. No, it actually increased. So H is incorrect.

Option I: In year 1, a $100 billion increase in spending would have increased real output by $75. Wait, the multiplier is 4, so 100 *4 = $400. So I's statement is incorrect because it would have increased by $400, not $75.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations again. So in year 1, spending multiplier 4. So yes, $100 billion of spending would increase output by 400 billion. I's statement says 75, which is one fourth of 300, so that's wrong.

So reviewing all the options, the only correct conclusion is option C: The spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.

So looking back, the correct answer should be option C.

The question involves analyzing the impact of an increase in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) from 0.75 to 0.80 over two years and determining which conclusions are correct. The spending multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{(1 - \text{MPC})} \). 

1. **Year 1 Calculation**:  
   MPC = 0.75 ⇒ \( 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \) ⇒ Multiplier = \( \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \).

2. **Year 2 Calculation**:  
   MPC = 0.80 ⇒ \( 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \) ⇒ Multiplier = \( \frac{1}{0.20} = 5 \).

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A**: Incorrect. The multiplier increased from 4 to 5.  
   - **B**: Incorrect. The spending multiplier is 5, so a $100 billion increase would lead to a $500 billion increase in real output.  
   - **C**: Correct. The multiplier increased from 4 to 5.  
   - **D**: Incorrect. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is \( 1 - \text{MPC} \). Since MPC increased, MPS decreased.  
   - **E**: Incorrect. A higher multiplier means a more powerful effect, so year 1's effect was less.  
   - **F**: Incorrect. The spending multiplier is 5, so a $100 billion increase would lead to a $500 billion increase.  
   - **G**: Incorrect. The MPC increased, not decreased.  
   - **H**: Incorrect. The MPC increased, not decreased.  
   - **I**: Incorrect. The multiplier is 4, so a $100 billion increase leads to a $400 billion increase.  
   - **J**: Not provided, so not considered.  

Thus, the correct conclusion is **C**.
