Okay, so I have this question about depreciation using the declining-balance method. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says the Five Star Hotel put down $3,000 worth of carpeting. Wait, wait—carpeting is an intangible asset, right? So it's probably being depreciated over its useful life. The carpeting lasts for five years, so that's the useful life. 

The accountant wants to use the declining-balance method. I remember that the declining balance method is an accelerated depreciation method. Unlike straight-line, which spreads the cost evenly over the asset's life, the declining balance method charges a higher depreciation in the early years and lower in later years. 

The question asks for the depreciation in the second year. So I need to figure out the depreciation rate first. But wait, I'm not given the rate. Hmm, I think in the declining-balance method, it's usually a fixed rate applied each period. But since the problem doesn't specify the rate, like maybe 200% or 150% of straight-line, I might need to assume a standard rate. Or perhaps the problem expects me to calculate it based on a rate. Oh wait, wait! The question doesn't say anything about the rate. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is part of a larger context where the rate is implied. Or maybe it's expecting me to assume that the depreciation rate is the same as straight-line? Let me think.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit more straightforward. The problem states that the carpeting is made to last five years, so it's being depreciated over five years. If it's using the declining balance method, the depreciation rate would be double the straight-line rate. Wait, no—actually, in the declining balance method, the rate is typically a multiple of the straight-line rate. For example, a 200% declining balance rate, which is double the straight-line rate. But without the rate specified, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming a standard rate. Let me think about how I would approach this. Normally, in the declining balance method, the depreciation each period is the book value at the beginning of the period multiplied by a fixed rate. But without knowing the rate, I can't compute the exact amount. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem assumes a 200% declining balance rate, which is a common practice. Let me check that. So, straight-line depreciation per year would be total cost divided by useful life. Here, $3,000 over 5 years is $600 per year. So straight-line rate is 1/5=20% per year. Declining balance would use a higher rate, like 200%, so 2 * 20% = 40% per year. But wait, that's if it's 200% of straight-line. Alternatively, some use 200% per year, others use 200% over the life. Wait, no, I think 100% is straight line, and 200% is double that. 

Wait, no, that's not correct. The straight-line rate is 1/5=20% per year. Declining balance would use a higher rate, perhaps 200% of that, so 40% per year. But wait, no, the rate is usually a multiple, like 200% of straight-line. So that would be 40% per year. So in the first year, depreciation is 40% of $3,000, which is $1,200. 

But wait, the question is about the second year. So in year two, the book value is reduced by $1,200. So the book value at the start of year two is $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800. Now, applying the same 40% rate, the depreciation for year two would be 40% of $1,800. Let's calculate that: 0.4 * 1800 = 720. So the depreciation for the second year would be $720. Looking at the options, option H is $720. 

But wait, did I get the rate right? Let me double-check. The problem states the carpeting is made to last five years, which is 5 years. So using the straight-line method, the annual depreciation is $3,000 /5 = $600. But that's for straight-line. Declining balance uses a higher rate. So in declining balance, if the rate is 200%, then 2 * 20% =40% per period. So each year, the depreciation is 40% of the book value at the start of the year. 

So for year one: 40% of 3000 is 1200. Book value after year one is 1800. Year two: 40% of 1800 is 720. So the depreciation in the second year is $720. Therefore, the correct answer is H: $720. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is 100% (so double straight line) or 80%? Wait, no, the problem isn't specific about the rate. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the rate is 200% of straight line, which is 40% per year. So the answer is H. 

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the rate is double the straight line, but sometimes people use 200% of the straight line. So I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Straight line is 20% per year, so 40% is 2x. So that's correct. So the second year would be $720. So the correct answer is H. So the options are H: $720. Looking back at the options, option H is $720. So the answer should be H.

To determine the depreciation for the second year using the declining-balance method, we start by calculating the annual depreciation rate. The carpeting costs $3,000 and is depreciated over five years, making the straight-line rate 20% ($3,000 ÷ 5). The declining-balance method typically uses a higher rate, often double the straight-line rate, which is 40% ($20 × 2).

1. **First Year Depreciation**: $3,000 × 40% = $1,200.  
   - Book value after first year: $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800.

2. **Second Year Depreciation**: $1,800 × 40% = $720.  
   - Book value after second year: $1,800 - $720 = $1,080.

Thus, the depreciation for the second year is $720, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
