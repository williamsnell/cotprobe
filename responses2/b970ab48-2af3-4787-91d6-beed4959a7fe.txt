Question:

Aggressive ants live in the swollen thorns of a small tropical tree and feed on oil-rich bodies that the tree produces at the tips of its leaflets. Which of the following experiments best tests the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects?

Options:

A: Remove oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent ant density.
B: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.
C: Add more oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent leaf damage.
D: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent leaf damage.
E: Remove ants and measure subsequent thorn growth.
F: Add more leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.
G: Remove the thorns and measure subsequent density of ants.
H: Remove the tree and measure subsequent ant density.
I: Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.
J: Add more ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.

Okay, so I've got this question here about ants and plants. Let me try to break it down. The question is about which experiment tests the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The ants are aggressive and live on the swollen thorns of a tropical tree. They feed on oil-rich parts of the tree's leaflets. So, the main point here is that ants are defending the tree by either eliminating the insects or evading them.

The hypothesis is that the ants either kill the insects or chase them away. The experiments are different scenarios where certain conditions are altered, and we measure the effect on ant density or thorn growth.

Let me look at the options again:

A: Remove oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent ant density.
Wait, wait. The oil-rich bodies are feeders, right? So if we remove them, the ants might not find food anymore. That would lead to less ant density, but does that test the hypothesis of either killing or chasing? I'm not sure. It might be testing the effect on feeding, but the hypothesis is about defense methods, not about direct removal of food.

B: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.
Hmm, this removes the insects that the ants are supposed to be avoiding. If the ants are chasing them, removing them would mean more ants getting to find other food. So, lower ant density. That directly tests the hypothesisâ€”ant defense via chasing.

C: Add more oil-rich bodies and measure leaf damage.
Adding more food means the ants are feeding more. They might take more thorns, leading to more damage. That's about feeding, not defense, so maybe not relevant.

D: Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent leaf damage.
Wait, the question is about thorns. So removing the insects (insects are the feeders) would cause ants to chase them away. That would lead to less ants and more thorn damage. But wait, the hypothesis is about thorns being defended by ants. If the thorns are defended, then removing them (by either killing or chasing) would affect ant density. But D is about removing the insects, which is the feeders, not the thorns. So this might not directly test the thorns' defense.

E: Remove ants and measure thorn growth.
If ants are removed, the thorns would grow more, as they're the thorns. That's about the thorns being destroyed, but the hypothesis is about defense, not just destruction. So maybe not the best test.

F: Add more leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.
Adding more feeders would lead to more ants chasing them, so lower ant density. That's similar to B but with more insects.

G: Remove the thorns and measure ant density.
If thorns are removed, ants might not have to defend them, leading to higher density. That's testing if thorns are being defended, but the hypothesis is about defense methods, not just presence. So this might not directly test the hypothesis.

H: Remove the tree and measure ant density.
If the tree is removed, thorns would grow. Then, ants might have no thorns to defend, leading to higher density. This again is about thorns presence and defense, not about defense methods.

I: Remove ants and measure leaf damage.
Removing ants would mean they can't find food, so maybe they chase the insects. That would lead to more damage on thorns. But again, this is about the insects being removed, not about how the thorns are defended.

J: Add more ants and measure leaf damage.
Adding more ants would mean more food, so maybe they eat the insects. That would reduce leaf damage, which would support the hypothesis that ants are defending by eating and thus not damaging the leaves. But this is about adding more ants, not removing them.

Wait, the question is about the hypothesis that the ants either kill or chase away the insects. So the best experiment would be to remove the insects (the feeders), which would cause more ants to chase them, thus reducing the number of ants on the thorns. That's exactly what option B is doing.

So the correct answer should be B.

The question involves testing the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects. The best experiment to test this hypothesis would involve removing the insects (the feeders) to observe their effect on ant density. 

Option B, "Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density," directly tests the hypothesis by showing that when the feeders are removed, ants are more likely to chase them, leading to fewer ants and potentially more thorn damage. This experiment clearly tests the defense mechanism of the ants by removing the insects.

ANSWER: B
