Okay, so I've got this problem here about a vice president of sales taking a client out for lunch. The total cost of the lunch is $44, and she gave a 20% tip. I need to figure out how much she spent in total. The options are from A to J, each with different amounts.

Hmm, let's break this down. The total is $44, and she tipped 20%. So first, I should calculate what 20% of $44 is. To find a percentage of a number, I can multiply the percentage (in decimal form) by the number. 

20% is the same as 0.20. So I'll do 0.20 multiplied by 44. Let me calculate that: 44 * 0.20 = 8.80. So the tip is $8.80.

Now, I need the total amount spent, which includes the original $44 plus the tip. So I add $8.80 to $44. Let me add that: 44 + 8.80 = 52.80. 

Looking at the options, I see that option C is $52.80. So that must be the correct answer.

To determine how much the vice president spent on lunch, including the tip, we first calculate the 20% tip on $44.

**Tip Calculation:**
20% of $44 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 44 = 8.80 \]

**Total Spent:**
Adding the tip to the original cost:
\[ 44 + 8.80 = 52.80 \]

The total spent is $52.80, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
