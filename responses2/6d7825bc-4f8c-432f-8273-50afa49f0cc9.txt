Question:

A plumbing company hired a worker to work at various construction sites. The worker used his own truck to travel between the company's warehouse and the construction sites, but the company fitted the truck with a rack for carrying plumbing pipes. The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the company was not responsible for the worker's actions during his commute to work.
B: No, because the worker was an independent contractor.
C: No, because the worker was responsible for his own actions outside of work hours.
D: No, because the company was not aware of the worker's suspended license.
E: Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials.
F: Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.
G: Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.
H: No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.
I: Yes, because the worker was using a truck fitted by the company at the time of the accident.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about contract law, specifically about negligent hiring. Hmm, let me break this down.

The scenario is a plumbing company hired a worker to drive between the warehouse and construction sites. The worker used his own truck for this, and the company fitted it with a rack for plumbing pipes. The worker was paid for traveling, but not for his driving. Because the worker was required to carry pipes in his truck while working, the company asked the worker if he had a valid driver's license. He said he did, but actually had one suspended because he was convicted of motor vehicle collisions.

Then, on a commute to work one morning, the worker caused a collision with a woman. Her action against the company is based on negligence in hiring. The question is whether she's likely to prevail.

The options are A to H, and the answer must be one of them. Let me think about what I know about this law.

Negligent hiring law. From what I remember, a worker has a duty to provide a safe working environment. If the worker doesn't have a valid license, the company is at fault. So, because the worker's license was suspended, the company failed to verify the license. So the company's failure to verify could be negligence in hiring, leading to negligence on their part.

Wait, but the question is about the worker's own actions. The accident happened while the worker was driving to work, which is part of his employment. So, if the worker was using his truck, and the accident happened in the scope of employment, maybe the worker is liable.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the duty to hire is separate from the duty to provide a safe environment. Let me think. If the worker is working within the scope of employment, the company's hiring is a duty to provide a safe environment, but if the worker is working on their own truck, maybe the company's duty is to ensure the truck is safe, but the worker's own actions during work could be liability.

Wait, but the question is whether the worker's actions are negligence. The worker was using the truck, which the company fitted. If the worker was driving, and had a valid license, perhaps he was doing his job. But in this case, he didn't have a license, so maybe he was acting in his own interest or not?

Wait, the worker's license was suspended. So the worker was not considered a competent driver. Therefore, the company's failure to verify his license would be a breach of the hiring duty. But the question is whether the accident is a negligence in hiring. Because the accident happened during his employment, maybe the worker is liable.

Wait, the company's duty to hire a competent driver is likely to be separate from the duty to provide a safe environment. So if the company didn't verify the worker's license, that's a failure to hire, which is negligence. But if the accident occurred during his employment, perhaps it's a breach of his duty to provide a safe working environment, which would be negligence.

Wait, but the question is about whether the woman is likely to prevail based on negligence in hiring. The woman's claim is based on negligence in hiring. So, for her to succeed, she would need to show that the company's hiring was negligent.

So, the key here is whether the company's duty to hire a competent driver (which included verifying the worker's license) was breached. If the worker's license was invalid, the company failed to verify, which is a breach of the hiring duty. That would be negligence, leading to the company being liable. But the question is about whether the worker was responsible for his own actions, so perhaps the worker was at fault.

Wait, but the question is whether the woman is likely to prevail. So, if the company's hiring was considered negligent, the woman might have a case. Alternatively, if the worker's failure to have a valid license led to his own negligence, the company might be liable.

Wait, the worker was working while the company fitted the truck with a pipe rack. The worker's actions during work, but the accident happened while he was driving to work, which is part of his employment. So, the accident is within his employment scope.

So, according to some laws, the company's failure to verify the worker's license is a breach of the hiring duty, which is negligence. So, the company is liable for not having a competent driver. But if the worker was working and had a valid license, why didn't the company verify it? Because the company could have verified it beforehand, but didn't, leading to a breach.

Wait, but the worker's license was suspended because of a prior offense. So, the company didn't know about that because they were just verifying the worker's license. So, the company's failure to verify (and thus, the failure to hire a competent driver) is a matter of breach of the hiring duty. That would be negligence on the company's part.

But the question is whether the woman is likely to prevail. The woman is suing based on negligence in hiring. So, she would need to show that the company's hiring was negligent.

But wait, the worker's failure to have a valid license is a reason for negligence in hiring. So the company is liable for not having a competent driver, which is a duty to hire. So, the company's failure to verify the license is a breach of the hiring duty, leading to negligence.

Wait, but the question is whether the worker's actions were negligent. The accident happened during work, which was his employment. So, if the worker was at fault for the accident, the worker would win. But perhaps the worker was at fault because he was driving while the truck was fitted with a pipe rack. So, using a truck with a rack probably meant it's not going to fall. So, the accident might be accident-free, but if the worker was at fault for not having a license, he is liable.

Wait, but the problem is about whether the woman is likely to prevail. So, the woman's case is based on negligence in hiring. She would need to show that the company's hiring was negligent.

The fact that the worker was driving and the accident happened during his work could be a contributing factor. But if the worker was using the truck, and the accident was on purpose (accidentally), maybe he's liable. Alternatively, if he was operating under the belief that it would fall, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, but if the worker was driving and saw the woman, and then the accident happened, the worker could be at fault for the accident. But the question is about the woman's theory, which is based on the company's hiring being negligent. So, if the worker's failure to have a valid license is a cause of the accident, the company's duty to hire a competent driver is a cause of the accident.

So the company's duty is a matter of hiring, which is a separate duty from the duty to provide a safe environment. So, the company is liable for not verifying the license, which is a failure to hire a competent driver. That's negligence on their part. Therefore, the woman, suing on negligence, would succeed if the company was negligent.

Wait, but the question is whether the worker was responsible for his own actions. The problem is that the company fitted the truck with a pipe rack, which the worker used. So, perhaps the worker was responsible for the accident because the truck's safety was in question, and the worker was taking care to prevent the accident. But that's a different issue.

Alternatively, the company's failure to verify the worker's license is a matter of hiring, which is a duty to hire a competent driver. The company's duty extends to actions taken by the worker in the scope of employment. Since the accident happened while working, the accident is within the scope of employment, so the company's duty includes the worker's actions. But if the worker didn't have a license, that's a breach of that duty.

But the company didn't verify the license, so that's a breach. Therefore, the company is liable for not having a competent driver. The worker was at fault because he didn't have a license, and even if the accident was his doing, the failure to verify the license is a separate duty.

Wait, but the question is about whether the woman's claim is based on the company's hiring being negligent. So, the woman is suing for negligence in hiring. So, she would need to show that the company's hiring was negligent.

The company's failure to verify the worker's license is a breach of their hiring duty. That's a matter of hiring, not the duty to provide a safe environment. So, the company is liable for not hiring a competent driver, which is a matter of their duty to hire.

So, the company's failure to verify the license leads to negligence. The woman would have to prove that the company's hiring was negligent. If the worker's failure to have a license is a cause of the accident, then the company's duty to hire a competent driver is a cause of the accident. So, the accident is both a result of the worker's failure to have a license and the company's failure to hire a competent driver.

Wait, but the accident happened during the worker's work, so it's within the scope of employment. So, perhaps the accident is a result of his negligence, but the company's duty to hire a competent driver is a separate matter. So, the company could be liable for failing to hire a competent driver, leading to the accident.

But wait, the company's duty is to hire a competent driver. If the worker was not verified, that's a breach of their duty. So, the company is liable. So, if the worker was at fault for the accident, the worker would win. But if the company's duty to hire is breached, and the accident resulted from that, then the company is liable.

Wait, but if the accident happened while the worker was working, perhaps the accident was a result of his own negligence, not the company's. But the question is about the company's duty to hire, not their duty to provide a safe environment.

Wait, but let's think about this. The worker was driving a truck fitted with a pipe rack. The accident was while working, so the problem is whether the company's hiring was negligent. If the worker didn't have a valid license, the company failed to hire a competent driver. The company's duty to hire is a matter of hiring, not of driving. So, this is a breach of the hiring duty, not of the duty to provide a safe environment.

So, the company's failure to hire a competent driver is a matter of their duty to hire, which is negligence. The accident, which occurred while the worker was working, is within the scope of employment, making the accident a matter of the worker's own negligence.

Wait, but the woman is suing on negligence in hiring, so the woman's claim is based on the company's hiring being negligent. So, the company's failure to verify the license is a breach of their duty to hire, leading to the accident.

So, the accident is a result of the company's failure to hire a competent driver. So the company is liable for that. Therefore, the woman is likely to prevail based on the company's negligence.

Wait, but the question is about whether she is likely to win. So, if the company's duty to hire a competent driver is a breach, the company is liable. So, the woman's claim is based on the company's negligence in hiring.

But wait, the question is about whether the worker was responsible for his own actions. The worker was working while the company fitted the truck, but the accident happened while he was driving. So, perhaps the worker was at fault for the accident because he was driving with the truck, not because he didn't have a license. But that's a different issue, as the question is about negligence in hiring.

Wait, but the question is about whether the company's failure to verify the worker's license is a matter of negligence. So, the company's duty is to hire a competent driver. If the worker didn't have a license, that's a breach. So, the company is liable for not having a competent driver, which is a duty to hire.

So, the accident is a result of the worker's failure to have a license. So, the company's duty to hire a competent driver is a cause of the accident. Therefore, the accident is due to the company's failure to hire a competent driver, which is a matter of their duty. So, the company is liable for that.

But the question is whether the worker was responsible for his own actions. If the accident was due to the worker's negligence, the worker wins. If it was due to the company's negligence, the company wins. But the question is about the woman's theory being based on the company's hiring being negligent. So, if the company's failure to hire a competent driver is a matter of their duty, that's a failure of duty, leading to negligence, and the woman's claim is based on that.

So, the woman's claim is that the company's hiring was negligent. So, if the company's failure to verify the worker's license is a matter of their duty (hiring), and that led to the accident (which was the worker's fault because he didn't have a license), then the company is liable. So, the woman would win.

Alternatively, if the accident happened because the worker was using the truck correctly, but the worker didn't have a license, then the worker could be at fault for not having a license, which is a separate duty. So, the company's duty is separate from the duty to provide a safe environment.

Wait, the question is about whether the worker was responsible for his own actions. His actions were the accident. But the question is based on the company's hiring being negligent. So, if the company's failure to hire a competent driver is a matter of their duty, that's negligence, leading to the accident.

So, the woman is suing based on the company's hiring being negligent. So, the woman would win if the company's hiring was negligent.

So, looking at the options, let me see. The options are A to H. The question is about the woman's theory being based on the company's hiring being negligent.

Option E says: Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials. That's similar to saying the company's failure to verify is a breach of their duty to hire, leading to negligence.

But another option is H: No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.

Hmm, so if the company's duty is to have a competent driver, but the worker was working in the scope of the company's employment, then the company's duty includes the worker's actions. So, the company is liable for the worker's failure to have a license, which is a breach.

So, if the worker was at fault for the accident, the company is liable. The woman is suing on that basis.

So, the correct answer would be E: Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials.

Wait, but another thought: the company fitted the truck with a pipe rack, which probably meant it's not going to fall. So, maybe the accident wasn't due to the truck's condition but because of the driver's fault. If that's the case, then the accident was caused by the worker's own negligence, not the company's.

So, in that case, the accident was the worker's fault, not the company's. So, the company's duty to hire a competent driver is a matter of the company's duty, not the worker's.

Therefore, the woman wouldn't be liable if the worker was at fault for the accident.

But the question is about whether the worker was liable for his own actions. Wait, no, the question is about the woman's claim being based on the company's hiring being negligent.

So, if the accident was due to the worker's failure to have a license, then the company is liable for not having a competent driver, leading to the accident. So, the woman's claim is based on the company's negligence.

In that case, the correct answer would be E: Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify.

The key points:

- The worker was driving a truck fitted with a pipe rack, which likely means it's not going to fall, so the accident was probably accident-free.

- The worker was at fault for the accident because he didn't have a valid license.

- The company's duty to hire a competent driver is a breach of the hiring duty, leading to the accident.

- The accident is within the scope of the worker's employment.

- If the accident was due to the worker's failure to have a license, the company is liable for not having a competent driver, which is a breach of the hiring duty.

- So, the woman's theory is based on the company's hiring being negligent.

So, the correct answer is E: Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials.

Looking back at the answer options, E is "Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials."

So, that's the reasoning.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the woman is likely to prevail in her negligence claim based on the company's hiring being negligent. The key facts include the worker failing to have a valid driver's license, which resulted in an accident while the worker was working. The worker was driving a truck fitted with a pipe rack, which likely prevented the accident. The company fitted the truck with a pipe rack, which the worker used. The worker was thereby at fault for the accident, as the accident was not due to the worker's fault but to his failure to have a valid license.

The company's duty to hire a competent driver is a breach of the hiring duty, which is a matter of the company's duty to verify the worker's license. The accident occurred within the scope of the worker's employment, making the accident a result of the worker's negligence. Therefore, the woman's claim is based on the company's hiring being negligent.
