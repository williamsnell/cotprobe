Okay, so I need to find the freezing point of a solution made by mixing 92 grams of ethanol (C2H5OH) and 500 grams of water. I'm a bit rusty on freezing point depression, but let's think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the freezing point depression depends on the molality of the solute. The formula I think is ΔTf = Kf * m, where Kf is the freezing point depression constant for the solvent (water here), and m is the molality.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The solvent is water, and the solute is ethanol. So, yes, we're dealing with freezing point depression here. The freezing point of the solution will be lower than that of pure water because of this.

So, the freezing point of pure water is 0°C. So, we'll subtract the freezing point depression from that. But wait, the formula is ΔT = Kf * m. So the solution's freezing point is 0 - ΔT.

I think the Kf for water is 1.86 °C/molal. So Kf = 1.86.

Now, I need to find the molality. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solute here is ethanol. So I'll need to calculate the moles of ethanol.

The molar mass of ethanol (C2H5OH) is (2*12) + (6*1) + (16) = 24 + 6 + 16 = 46 g/mol.

So moles of ethanol = mass (g) / molar mass. The mass is 92 g, so 92 / 46 = 2 moles. Wait, 46 times 2 is 92, so yes, 2 moles.

The solvent is water, which is 500 grams. So in kg, that's 0.5 kg.

Molality (m) is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So 2 moles / 0.5 kg = 4 mol/kg.

So m = 4.

Now, ΔTf = Kf * m = 1.86 * 4 = 7.44 °C.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Because the question is about freezing point depression, which is the change in freezing point. But wait, no, wait. No, in the formula, ΔT is the freezing point depression, which is the change in the freezing point. So the freezing point of the solution is lower than that of the solvent.

Wait, but wait, the solvent's freezing point is 0°C, so the solution's freezing point is 0 - ΔTf. So, ΔTf is 7.44°C, so the freezing point of the solution is -7.44°C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, isn't the formula ΔTf = Kf * m. So that gives the freezing point lowering. So yes, the solution's freezing point is 0 - 7.44, which is -7.44. So the answer would be option A (-7.44 degrees).

Wait, but I thought the molality calculation was 4. Let me double-check the molality calculation.

Ethanol mass =92g, molar mass=46g/mol. So 92 /46=2. So yes, 2 moles. Water is 500g = 0.5 kg. So molality is 2 / 0.5 =4. So that's correct.

So the freezing point depression is 1.86 *4=7.44. So freezing point of solution is 0 -7.44= -7.44.

Looking at the options, option A is -7.44, which matches.

To determine the freezing point of a solution containing 92 g of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) and 500 g of water, we use the formula for freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \( K_f \) is the freezing point depression constant for water, \( 1.86 \, ^\circ C \cdot \text{kg/mol} \),
- \( m \) is the molality of the solute.

### Step 1: Calculate the molality of ethanol
The molality \( m \) is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. 

1. **Molar mass of ethanol (C₂H₅OH):**
   \[
   \text{Molar mass} = (2 \times 12) + (6 \times 1) + (16) = 24 + 6 + 16 = 46 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of ethanol:**
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{92 \, \text{g}}{46 \, \text{g/mol}} = 2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Mass of water in kilograms:**
   \[
   \text{Mass} = 500 \, \text{g} = 0.5 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

4. **Molality of ethanol:**
   \[
   m = \frac{\text{Moles of ethanol}}{\text{Mass of water (kg)}} = \frac{2 \, \text{mol}}{0.5 \, \text{kg}} = 4 \, \text{mol/kg}.
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the freezing point depression
Using the formula for freezing point depression:
\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m = 1.86 \cdot 4 = 7.44 \, ^\circ C.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the freezing point of the solution
The freezing point of pure water is \( 0 \, ^\circ C \). Since the solution undergoes freezing point depression, the freezing point of the solution is:
\[
\text{Freezing point of solution} = 0 \, ^\circ C - 7.44 \, ^\circ C = -7.44 \, ^\circ C.
\]

### Final Answer
The freezing point of the solution is \( -7.44 \, ^\circ C \), which corresponds to option **A**.
