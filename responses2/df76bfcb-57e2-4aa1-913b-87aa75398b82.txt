Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. The function is g(x) = 1 divided by (1 + x raised to the 3/2 power). And I need to find the derivative g'(x) when x is 1. Hmm, derivatives. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, first, let's write down the function again to make sure I have it right: g(x) = 1 / (1 + x^(3/2)). That's the same as g(x) = (1 + x^(3/2))^{-1}. Right, because dividing by something is the same as raising to the negative first power.

Now, to find the derivative, I should use the chain rule. The chain rule says that if you have a function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) is f'(g(x)) * g'(x). So here, f(u) = u^{-1}, where u is (1 + x^(3/2)).

Let me compute the derivative step by step. First, find the derivative of f(u) with respect to u. That's straightforward. The derivative of u^{-1} is -1 * u^{-2}, right? So f'(u) = -1/u².

Now, I need to find the derivative of u with respect to x. u is 1 + x^(3/2). So the derivative of u with respect to x is (3/2)x^(1/2), because the derivative of x^n is n x^(n-1). So, du/dx = (3/2)√x.

Putting it all together using the chain rule, g'(x) is f'(u) * du/dx. So:

g'(x) = (-1/u²) * (3/2 √x)

Substituting back u = 1 + x^(3/2), we get:

g'(x) = (-1 / (1 + x^(3/2))²) * (3/2) * √x

Now, I need to evaluate this at x = 1.

Let's plug in x = 1 into each part. First, compute u at x=1: u = 1 + (1)^(3/2). Since 1 to any power is 1, u = 1 +1 = 2.

So, 1/u² is 1/(2^2) = 1/4.

Then, √x at x=1 is √1 = 1.

Putting it all together, g'(1) = (-1/4) * (3/2) * 1.

Multiply the constants: (-1/4) * (3/2) = (-3)/(8). So g'(1) is -3/8.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3/2 times 1/4 is (3/2)*(1/4)=3/8, but with the negative sign it's -3/8. So -3/8 is equal to -0.375.

Looking at the options, option A is -0.375. So the correct answer should be A.

To find \( g'(1) \) for \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^{3/2}} \), we use the chain rule. Let \( u = 1 + x^{3/2} \), so \( g(x) = u^{-1} \). The derivative \( g'(x) \) is:

\[
g'(x) = -u^{-2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} x^{1/2}
\]

Substituting \( u = 1 + x^{3/2} \) and \( x = 1 \):

- \( u = 1 + 1^{3/2} = 2 \)
- \( x^{1/2} = 1 \)

Thus,

\[
g'(1) = -\frac{1}{2^2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot 1 = -\frac{3}{8} = -0.375
\]

The correct answer is **A: -0.375**.
