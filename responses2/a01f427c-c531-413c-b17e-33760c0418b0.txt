Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the heat of fusion for sucrose. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. I remember that the heat of fusion is the amount of energy required to melt a substance. The formula I think is something like the heat change equals the mass of the solute multiplied by the molal change in temperature multiplied by some constant, right?

Wait, the problem states that the solution is ideal, so it's a solution of sucrose and water. The solubility is given as 6.2 molal. Oh wait, molality is moles per kilogram of solvent. So if the solution is 6.2 molal, that's the molality of the solute in the solvent. So the molality (m) is 6.2 mol/kg.

But wait, the question is about the heat of fusion, which is the enthalpy change when freezing or melting. For solutions, I think we have to consider the freezing point depression or something, but wait, the problem says it's an ideal solution, so maybe we don't need to account for that. Oh wait, no, the question gives the solubility, so perhaps we can work with that.

The heat of fusion formula I think is ΔH fusion = m * ΔT * K, where K is the heat capacity at constant pressure. Wait, but wait, I think there's a formula that relates the heat of solution to molar masses and other properties. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Oh wait, another thing I remember is the formula for the heat of solution. The heat of solution (ΔH_sol) is given by:
ΔH_sol = i * M * R * ΔT_molal
Wait, no, I think that's for the freezing point depression. Alternatively, the formula for the heat of fusion when considering a solution is ΔH_fus = i * M * C_p * m, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no. The heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) for a solution is related to the freezing point depression. The formula for freezing point depression is ΔT = i * K_f * m, where i is the van't Hoff factor, K_f is the freezing point depression constant, and m is molality.

But wait, the problem states that the solubility is 6.2 molal. So the molality m is 6.2 mol/kg. But what about the freezing point? The question gives the melting point of water, which I think is 0°C. But wait, the solution's freezing point must be lower because it's more solute. Wait, no, the problem states the solubility is 6.2 molal, but what about the freezing point? Hmm, maybe I need to find the freezing point depression.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the solubility is 6.2 molal. So the solution's freezing point is lower than water. So the freezing point ΔT would be given by ΔT = i * K_f * m. But what's K_f for water? I think for water, Kf is 1.86°C/molal. So ΔT = 1 * 1.86 * 6.2 = approx 11.53 °C. So the solution freezes at 0°C - 11.53 = -11.53°C. But wait, is that necessary for the heat of fusion calculation?

Wait, another approach. If this is a solution of sucrose in water, and the freezing point is lower, but we're being asked about the heat of fusion. Oh wait, the heat of fusion is the energy change during the phase transition. So for a solution, the heat of fusion would be the enthalpy change when you melt the solution.

But wait, the specific heat capacity (Cp) is involved. The formula for the heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) is: ΔH_fus = i * M * C_p * ΔT, where M is the molality of the solute, and ΔT is the freezing point change. But wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Another way: the heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) is the enthalpy change when a substance freezes. For a solution, the formula is ΔH_fus = i * m * C_p * ΔT.

Wait, but the problem provides the solubility, which is molality, not the freezing point. Let me recheck the given data.

The given data:

- Solubility: 6.2 molal. So m = 6.2 mol/kg.
- Molar mass of sucrose: 342 g/mol.
- Melting point of water: 200°C. So when it freezes, it's 0°C (since water's melting point is 0°C).
- Heat of fusion of water: 1400 cal/mol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the heat of fusion of water is 1400 cal/(mole·°C) * 0°C? Because the freezing point is at 0°C, so the change in temp is 0-0=0? Wait, no, the heat of fusion is the energy per mole to melt. So for water, it's about 1400 cal to melt per mole.

But wait, the problem states that the heat of fusion is to be calculated for sucrose. So for a solution, the heat of fusion would be less than that of water because it's more solute.

Wait, but the given data: the solubility is 6.2 molal, so that's the molality of the solution. So the molality of the solute is 6.2 mol/kg, which is 6.2 mol/kg.

Wait, but the question is about the heat of fusion of sucrose. The heat of fusion is the energy change when the substance freezes. For a solution, the heat of fusion is less than that of the pure substance because of the freezing point depression. So the formula involves the molality of the solution and the freezing point depression.

Wait, I've got to find ΔH_fus for the solution. The formula for the enthalpy change upon freezing is:

ΔH_fus = i * m * C_p * (ΔT).

Wait, but where does the ΔT come from? The freezing point depression. The freezing point depression ΔT is given by ΔT = i * K_f * m. Wait, but for the freezing point, i is the van't Hoff factor. For a non-electrolyte, i=1. So ΔT = 1 * 1.86 * 6.2 = 11.532 °C. So the freezing point of the solution is 0°C - 11.532°C = -11.532°C.

But the heat of fusion is related to the enthalpy change when freezing. So the ΔT here is the freezing point change. Wait, but the formula for the heat of fusion is ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol * (ΔT_freezing / ΔT_sol). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps ΔH_fus is equal to the heat of solution multiplied by ΔT, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the formula for the heat of fusion.

The heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) for a solution is given by:

ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol * (ΔT_freezing / ΔT_sol), where ΔT_freezing is the freezing point change (ΔT), and ΔT_sol is the solute's own freezing point change (ΔT_sol).

Wait, but the solute's ΔT_sol is 0 (since it's a solute, it's already in solution). No, wait, the formula is probably:

ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The heat of fusion is related to the heat of solution and the freezing point depression. The formula is ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing). But I'm not really confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution is the heat of solution (ΔH_sol) multiplied by the ratio (ΔT_sol / ΔT_freezing). So:

ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol * (ΔT_sol / ΔT_freezing)

But what is ΔT_sol? For the solute, it's its own freezing point, which is 0°C, but that's not right. Wait, no. The freezing point of the solution is lower than that of pure water. So the freezing point change for the solution is ΔT_sol = 0°C - (-11.532°C) = 11.532°C.

But wait, the formula for the heat of fusion of a solution is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Wait, no. Alternatively, I think the heat of fusion of the solution is the heat of solution multiplied by the ratio of the freezing point depression of the solution to the freezing point depression of the pure solvent. So ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol * (ΔT_sol / ΔT_freezing).

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the formula. Wait, I'm trying to recall. Oh, wait, another approach: the heat of fusion of a solution can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (i * m * C_p * ΔT_freezing) * (1 / (i * Kf) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the formula I've seen is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the given data.

Given:

- Solubility (molality, m) = 6.2 mol/kg
- Molar mass (M) = 342 g/mol
- Heat of fusion of water (ΔH_fus_water) = 1400 cal/mol
- Temperature of water: 0°C, so freezing point is 0°C.

Wait, but wait, the freezing point of the solution is at 0°C minus the freezing point depression. So ΔT_freeszing = (i * Kf * m) = 1*1.86 *6.2 = 11.532°C. So the solution freezes at 0 - 11.532 = -11.532°C.

But for the heat of fusion, I'm not sure. Let me think about the heat of solution. The heat of solution (ΔH_sol) is the heat required to dissolve one mole of the solute into the solvent. For a solution, this ΔH_sol is negative (exothermic).

But for the purposes of calculating the heat of fusion, I think I need to find the value of ΔH for the freezing process of the solution.

Wait, another formula: heat of solution (ΔH_sol) = i * M * R * ΔT_molal.

But M is the molality (6.2 mol/kg), R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) or 0.00186 cal/(g·K).

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the heat of solution first, and then relate that to the heat of fusion.

Wait, but the formula for ΔH_sol is:

ΔH_sol = i * M * R * ΔT_molal.

Wait, let's substitute the values.

M = 6.2 mol/kg.

ΔT_molal = 6.2 mol/kg * 0.001 kg/mol = 0.0062 °C.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 0.008314 cal/(g·K) → wait, no, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So to convert J to cal, divide by 4.184.

Wait, let me compute correctly.

ΔT_molal = 6.2 mol/kg * (1 kg/1000 g) → wait, molality is moles per kilogram, so 6.2 mol/kg = 6.2 mol per 1000 g.

So to convert mol/kg to °C, it's 6.2 * (0.001 kg/mol) → wait, no, molality is mol/kg. So m = 6.2 mol/kg = 6.2 mol per kg.

So to get degrees C, m * ΔT_molal = 6.2 * ΔT (in °C).

Wait, but the formula is ΔH_sol = i * M * R * ΔT_molal.

Wait, but ΔT_molal is in °C, which is the same as K, so R must be in cal/(mol·K). Let me check R's value in cal units: R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 1.98 cal/(mol·K). So, 8.314 cal/(mol·K) = 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 1.98 cal/(mol·K).

So, putting it all together:

ΔH_sol = i * M * R * ΔT_molal
= 1 * (6.2 mol/kg) * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (6.2 mol/kg * 0.001 kg/mol)
Wait, wait, no. Wait, M is molality, so 6.2 mol/kg. So when I multiply M by R, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K), I get J/(mol·K) * mol/kg → J/(kg·K). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Oh, because molality is in mol/kg, and R is in cal/(mol·K), maybe I should convert molality to mol/kg into mol/kg * R (cal/(mol·K)) * K.

Wait, let's try the calculation step by step.

M = 6.2 mol/kg.

ΔT_molal = 6.2 * 1 = 6.2 °C (since molality is in mol/kg, and 1 kg is 1000 g, but perhaps I can ignore that for the calculation).

Wait, no, the molality is 6.2 mol per kg. So, if I have 1 kg of solution, it contains 6.2 moles of solute. So, when the solution freezes, which requires a temperature drop of ΔT = 11.532 °C as calculated earlier.

So, the energy required to freeze the solution would be the enthalpy of solution (ΔH_sol) multiplied by the amount of substance (6.2 mol).

Wait, no, energy to freeze is the enthalpy of solution per mole multiplied by moles. So, the heat required to freeze 6.2 moles is ΔH_sol * 6.2 mol.

But wait, the problem is about the heat of fusion of the sucrose. The heat of fusion is the energy required to melt the solution into the solvent. So, perhaps we have to consider the enthalpy change for the freezing, but how does that relate to melting?

Wait, the heat of fusion is the energy required to melt one mole of solid at its melting point to liquid. For a solution, it's the reverse of freezing. So, the heat of fusion for the solution (ΔH_fus) is the negative of the heat of solidification (ΔH_solid), but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the heat of fusion is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Wait, but this is unclear. Another approach: the heat of fusion can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (i * m * C_p * (ΔT_freezing)) / (i * Kf * m)

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the heat of fusion is given by (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing).

Wait, since for freezing, the ΔT is 11.532 °C. For the solution, the ΔH_sol is the enthalpy change when the solution freezes, which is the opposite of the solution's enthalpy change when it's a solvent. So, solution freezing is exothermic, so ΔH_sol is negative.

Hmm, but perhaps I should proceed with the formula:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Assuming ΔH_sol is the enthalpy change upon freezing (negative), so:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But then, ΔH_sol is the enthalpy change when the solution freezes. So, if the solution is less dense than water, the freezing is exothermic, so ΔH_sol is negative.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the enthalpy of fusion. The heat of fusion is the amount of energy released when the solution freezes. So, the formula would be:

ΔH_fus = (i * m * C_p * ΔT_freezing) / (i * Kf) )

Wait, because ΔT_freezing is (ΔT_sol). No, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, the formula for the heat of fusion of a solution is:

ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol (solution) * (ΔT_sol / ΔT_freezing)

Wait, but ΔT_sol is the freezing point change of the solute. So, for the solute, ΔT_sol = 0 - (-11.532) = 11.532 °C.

For the solution, ΔT_freezing is 0 - (-11.532) = 11.532 °C.

Wait, so the same ΔT. So, in that case, the (ΔT_sol / ΔT_freezing) ratio would be 1. So, the heat of fusion would be the same as the solution's enthalpy change.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because solution's heat of solution (ΔH_sol) is negative, but the heat of fusion is positive. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think of the heat of fusion as the energy required to melt the solution into water. So, since the solution is less dense than water, freezing is exothermic, so the solution's ΔH_sol is negative. So, the heat of fusion would be the opposite (positive) of the solution's ΔH_sol.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution is equal to the solution's ΔH_sol divided by the ratio of the freezing point changes.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me see if I can find a formula that can help me relate these variables.

Wait, I think the formula is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But considering the signs, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) is the energy change when the solid freezes into liquid. For a solution, the enthalpy change upon freezing would be opposite to that of the pure substance. So, if the pure substance has a positive ΔH_fus, the solution's ΔH_fus would be negative.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Let's use the formula for the heat of solution (ΔH_sol) as:

ΔH_sol = i * M * R * ΔT_molal

Where M is molality, R is the gas constant, and ΔT_molal is the change in temperature (°C).

Wait, but M is 6.2 mol/kg, ΔT_molal is 6.2 * ΔT (°C). Wait, but ΔT_molal is 6.2 * (0.001 kg/mol) = 0.0062 °C. Wait, no, because molality is mol/kg. So, molality multiplied by kg/mol gives kg/mol. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me compute M * ΔT_molal.

M = 6.2 mol/kg.

ΔT_molal is 6.2 mol/kg * (0.001 kg/mol) = 0.0062 K. But wait, molality is mol/kg, which is mol per kg. So, M * ΔT_molal = 6.2 mol/kg * 0.001 kg/mol = 0.0062 K. Since 1 K = 1 °C, this is 0.0062 °C.

So, ΔT_molal = 0.0062 °C.

So, putting it into the formula for ΔH_sol:

ΔH_sol = i * M * R * ΔT_molal

Wait, but i=1 (since sucrose is a nonelectrolyte), R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), and ΔT_molal is 0.0062 K.

So:

ΔH_sol = 1 * 6.2 * 8.314 * 0.0062

Calculating this:

6.2 * 8.314 = 51.7828

51.7828 * 0.0062 ≈ 0.3216 J/mol.

But wait, this is the enthalpy change when the solution freezes. Since freezing is exothermic, ΔH_sol is negative. So:

ΔH_sol ≈ -0.3216 J/mol.

Wait, but J is a small unit. Converting to cal: 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 0.3216 J = 0.3216 / 4.184 ≈ 0.077 cal.

So, ΔH_sol ≈ -0.077 cal/mol.

Wait, but the heat of solution is usually a negative value, as it releases energy when the solution freezes.

Now, the heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) is the energy required to melt the solution into water. Since the solution is less dense than water, melting it would require energy. So, the heat of fusion is positive.

But how do I relate the heat of solution to the heat of fusion?

Wait, perhaps I can use the relationship between the two. The heat of solution is the energy change when the solution is dissolved, and the heat of fusion is when it's melted. They're related through the molar masses and the solvent's properties.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But I'm not sure about the signs. Let me think.

Assuming ΔT_sol is the temperature change when the solution freezes, which is 11.532°C, and ΔT_freezing is the same 11.532°C.

So, ΔT_sol = 11.532°C.

Wait, but wait, in the formula for ΔH_sol, I've calculated it as the solution freezing, which is negative. So ΔH_sol is -0.077 cal/mol.

But the heat of fusion is the energy required to melt, so positive. So, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Wait, but I'm not confident about the signs. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

ΔH_sol ≈ -0.077 cal/mol.

ΔT_sol = 11.532 K (since freezing point depression is 11.532°C, which is the same as 11.532 K).

ΔT_freezing = 11.532 K.

So:

ΔH_fus = (-0.077 cal/mol) * (11.532 K) / (11.532 K) = -0.077 cal/mol.

Wait, but the answer should be a positive value, so I'm getting a negative. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But I'm getting a negative result, which is incorrect. So perhaps I should take the absolute value.

Wait, but ΔH_sol is negative, so multiplying by ΔT_sol which is positive would make it more negative, which isn't correct. So perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Wait, but that's not the case. Maybe I should think about the relation between the two.

Wait, another way: the heat of fusion can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Wait, but I'm getting a negative number, which is wrong. So perhaps I should take the absolute value, but that doesn't seem correct.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the enthalpy change when the solution freezes. The solution is less dense than water, so it requires energy to freeze, which is exothermic. So, the solution's ΔH_sol is negative. The heat of fusion is the opposite, so it's positive but the magnitude is the same.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps the heat of fusion can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = ΔH_sol * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But I'm not recalling it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

Wait, but I'm getting a negative number, which is impossible. So perhaps I should take the absolute value, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But with ΔT_sol and ΔT_freezing as positive, and ΔH_sol as negative, this would give a negative number, which is incorrect. So perhaps I should take the absolute value of ΔH_sol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the solution's heat of solution and the heat of fusion. The solution's heat of solution (ΔH_sol) is the enthalpy change when the solution freezes. Since freezing is exothermic, ΔH_sol is negative.

The heat of fusion is the opposite of the solution's heat of solution. So, the heat of fusion is positive and equal in magnitude to the solution's heat of solution.

Wait, but that can't be because the solution's heat of solution is for the process of freezing, and the heat of fusion is for the process of melting.

Wait, perhaps the heat of fusion is the same magnitude as the solution's heat of solution but opposite in sign.

So, if I can calculate the solution's heat of solution and take its magnitude as the heat of fusion, that could work.

Wait, but how?

Well, the solution's heat of solution (ΔH_sol) is equal to:

ΔH_sol = i * m * R * ΔT_molal

But wait, using the values:

i = 1 (sucrose is nonelectrolyte)
m = 6.2 mol/kg
R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)
ΔT_molal = 6.2 * 0.001 kg/mol → 6.2 * 0.001 = 0.0062 K.

So,

ΔH_sol = 1 * 6.2 * 8.314 * 0.0062

Calculating:

6.2 * 8.314 = 51.7828
51.7828 * 0.0062 = 0.3216 J/mol

So, ΔH_sol = 0.3216 J/mol (negative, because freezing is exothermic).

So, the heat of fusion would be the magnitude of this, which is 0.3216 J/mol. But that's for the solution's melting. Wait, but the problem is about the heat of fusion of the sucrose itself.

Wait, that's confusing. The heat of fusion of the solution (ΔH_fus_sol) is the same as the heat of fusion of the solution (ΔH_fus), which is the energy required to melt the solution. But the problem is asking for the heat of fusion of the sucrose itself.

Wait, but the heat of fusion of the solution would be the same as the heat of fusion of the solution, which is way higher than the heat of fusion of the sucrose.

Wait, but that's not the question, the question is about the heat of fusion of the sucrose, which is the energy required to melt it, which is lower than the heat of fusion of the solution.

Wait, but perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution is the same as the heat of solution, so I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution is the same as the heat of solution, which would imply that the heat of fusion is 0.3216 J/mol, but that's not an option provided.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the solution has a molality of 6.2 mol/kg and the heat of fusion of the solution is 140 J/mol. So, perhaps the solution's ΔH_fus is 140 J/mol, and I need to find the ΔH_fus of the sucrose.

Wait, but this doesn't make sense. The solution's heat of fusion is the same as the solution's heat of solution. So, perhaps I'm supposed to find the heat of solution of the solution and then relate it to the heat of solution of the sucrose.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to approach this differently.

Wait, another approach: the heat of fusion can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But since ΔH_sol is the enthalpy change when the solution freezes, which is exothermic, and ΔT_sol is the freezing point change of the solution, which is 11.532 °C, and ΔT_freezing is the same. So, the ratio is 1, and the calculation would yield the same value as ΔH_sol.

But since ΔH_sol is negative, the ΔH_fus would be the same as ΔH_sol, which is also negative. That's not possible because the heat of fusion should be positive.

So, perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = (ΔH_sol) * (ΔT_sol) / (ΔT_freezing)

But if I take the absolute values, perhaps that would give the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the problem differently.

The problem states that the solution has a molality of 6.2 mol/kg and a heat of fusion of 140 J/mol. I need to calculate the heat of fusion of the sucrose.

Wait, but perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution is the same as the solution's heat of solution. But the solution's heat of solution would be the same as the heat of solution of the solution, which is different from the heat of solution of the sucrose.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to calculate the heat of solution of the solution, then find the heat of solution of the sucrose, and then relate them to find the heat of fusion of the sucrose.

Wait, but perhaps the heat of solution of the solution is equal to the heat of solution of the sucrose. But that doesn't make sense because the solute is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the heat of solution and the heat capacity.

Wait, another approach: the heat of solution is given by:

ΔH_sol = n * ΔH_fus

But this is the case when the solution is made by dissolving a substance, and the heat of solution is the heat of fusion multiplied by the number of moles.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again.

Wait, the heat of solution (ΔH_sol) is the enthalpy change when the solution is formed. It is related to the heat of solution of the solute (ΔH_sol_solute) and the heat of solution of the solvent (ΔH_sol_solvent).

But perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy of solution.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the problem in another way.

The given data is that the solution has a molality of 6.2 mol/kg and a heat of fusion of 140 J/mol. I need to find the heat of fusion of the sucrose.

Wait, perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution is the same as the heat of solution of the solution. So, the heat of solution of the solution is 140 J/mol.

But the heat of solution of the solution is the enthalpy change when the solution freezes. So, if the solution's heat of solution is 140 J/mol, then the heat of fusion of the solution would be 140 J/mol.

But the problem is asking for the heat of fusion of the sucrose. So, perhaps the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the heat of solution of the sucrose.

Wait, but that can't be right because the solute is different.

Wait, no, the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the heat of solution of the solution, which would be the same as the heat of solution of the solute. So, perhaps the heat of solution of the solution is 140 J/mol, which is the same as the heat of solution of the solute.

Wait, but that's not directly helpful for finding the heat of fusion of the sucrose.

Wait, perhaps the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the heat of solution of the sucrose. But the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the heat of solution of the solution itself. So, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by using the formula for the heat of solution of a solution.

The heat of solution of the solution (ΔH_sol) is given by:

ΔH_sol = n * ΔH_fus

Where n is the number of moles of solute.

But wait, the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the heat of solution of the solute. So, perhaps I can write:

ΔH_sol = n * ΔH_fus

But in this case, the ΔH_sol is the same as the solution's heat of solution, which is 140 J/mol.

But the solution's heat of solution is the same as the heat of solution of the solution. So, perhaps the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the heat of solution of the solute, which is 140 J/mol.

Wait, but then the heat of solution of the solution is 140 J/mol. So, the heat of solution of the solute is 140 J/mol.

But the problem is asking for the heat of fusion of the sucrose, which is the same as the solution's heat of solution.

Wait, but that can't be right because the solution's heat of solution is different from the solution's heat of fusion. The solution's heat of solution is the same as the solution's heat of solution, which is the same as the solution's heat of fusion.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing terms here. Let me try to clarify.

The heat of solution is the energy change when a solute dissolves in a solvent. It can be endothermic or exothermic, depending on whether the dissolution is absorbing or releasing heat.

The heat of fusion is the energy required to melt a solid, and it's endothermic.

So, the solution's heat of solution is the same as the solution's heat of fusion. Therefore, if the solution's heat of fusion is 140 J/mol, then the solution's heat of solution is also 140 J/mol.

But the problem is asking for the heat of fusion of the sucrose, which is the solution's heat of solution. So, the heat of fusion of the solution is 140 J/mol, which is the same as the solution's heat of solution.

Wait, but that would imply that the solution's heat of solution is 140 J/mol, which is the same as the solution's heat of fusion. So, the problem is asking for the solution's heat of solution, which is 140 J/mol.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the heat of fusion of the sucrose, which is the solution's heat of solution. So, the answer is 140 J/mol.

Wait, but the options given don't include 140 J/mol. The options are A: 80 J, B: 136 J, C: 140 J, D: 410 J.

So, the correct answer is option C: 140 J.

But wait, let me make sure. Because the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the solution's heat of fusion, so the heat of solution of the solution is 140 J/mol, which is the heat of fusion of the solution.

But the question is about the heat of fusion of the sucrose. So, perhaps the heat of solution of the solution is the same as the solution's heat of fusion, which is 140 J/mol.

Wait, but that would mean the answer is 140 J/mol, which is option C.

So, the correct answer is option C: 140 J.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the solution's heat of fusion is 140 J/mol, which is the same as the solution's heat of solution. So, the solution's heat of solution is 140 J/mol, which is the same as the solution's heat of fusion.

But the question is asking for the heat of fusion of the sucrose, which is the solution's heat of solution. So, the answer is 140 J/mol.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the solution's heat of solution is 140 J/mol, which is the same as the solution's heat of fusion, so the answer is 140 J/mol.

So, the correct answer is C: 140 J.

Wait, but the question is about the heat of fusion of the sucrose, which is the solution's heat of solution. So, the answer is 140 J/mol.

So, the correct option is C: 140 J.

The heat of fusion of the solution is the same as the solution's heat of solution. Since the solution's heat of solution is 140 J/mol, the heat of fusion of the solution is also 140 J/mol. The question asks for the heat of fusion of the sucrose, which is the solution's heat of solution. Therefore, the answer is 140 J.

ANSWER: C: 140 J
