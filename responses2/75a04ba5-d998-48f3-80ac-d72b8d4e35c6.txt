Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about net sales revenue. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that a shoe retailer allows customers to return shoes within 90 days. The company estimates that 5% of sales will be returned. During the month, sales are $200,000, and returns of prior months are $5,000. They're asking for the net sales revenue recorded for new sales during the month.

Hmm, I think net sales revenue is what's left after subtracting the returns from the total sales. So, the basic idea is Net Sales = Total Sales - Returns.

Wait, but wait. Are the returns of prior months affecting the current month's net sales? Because in some cases, like if a company has a policy to write off returns, the prior month's returns might be considered part of the current period's revenue.

Wait, this is about the current month's net sales. The company's current sales are $200,000. Now, 5% of that is estimated to be returned. So, the expected returns would be 5% of $200,000, which is $10,000. That's $10,000.

But then, there's a return of prior months of $5,000. Does that have to do with the current month's net sales or the net sales for the accounting period? Because if the $5k is from prior months, then it's not part of the current period's net sales. Or is it?

Wait, maybe the $5k is the amount that was returned in the previous accounting period and is being carried forward as part of the net sales for the current period. Or is it that the $5k is the amount that's already written off, so it's subtracted from the current sales.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The company's net sales are calculated by taking the total sales, subtracting the returns. So, in this case, the $5,000 is probably the amount that was returned in the prior months, so it's part of the return process. But when calculating net sales for the current month, we subtract the current month's returns from the total sales.

So the current month's net sales would be $200,000 (total sales) minus 5% returns, which is $10,000. That would give $190,000. But wait, another point: the prior month's returns are $5,000. Is that part of the current month's net sales? Or is it just part of the previous period's returns.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is a return from prior months, so it's already accounted for in the net sales of the previous period. So, in the current period, the company is seeing 5% of the current sales returned, which is $10k. But the $5k is part of the prior period's returns, so it doesn't affect the current net sales. So, the net sales would be $200k - $10k = $190k.

Wait, but wait, the options are A:195k, B:200k, etc. So 190 is not an option. Hmm. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the $5k is not subtracted from the net sales. Because that $5k is the amount that was written off in the prior period, so it's part of the prior period's net sales, not the current. So the current net sales would be the $200k minus the current period's returns, which is 5% of the current sales. So $200k - $10k = $190k. But this isn't an option. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The company's net sales is the total sales minus the returns that are expected to be returned in the current period. So $200k minus 5% of $200k is $190k. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the $5k is already part of the net sales for the previous period. So, the current period's net sales is $200k minus the current period's 5% returns ($10k) and minus any prior returns (but wait, prior returns would be part of the previous period's net sales, not the current. So, the current net sales would be 200k minus 10k (current returns), so 190k. But that's not an option, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is the amount that was written off in the prior period, which would be part of the prior period's net sales. So, the current period's net sales would not include that $5k. That's correct, because the $5k is from prior months. So, the current net sales should be 200k - 10k = 190k. But that's not an option. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the $5k is the amount from the current period's returns that are being written off. Wait, no, because the 5% is of the current period's sales.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is the amount of prior month's returns, which are not part of the current period's net sales. So, the current period's net sales would be the $200k minus the current period's 5% returns (10k), so 190k, but that's not an option. So, why isn't that an option?

Looking at the options, option J is 190,000, but no, the options are A:195, B:200, C:205, D:220, E:175, F:180, G:185, H:210, I:215, J:190. So, I'm getting 190, but that's not an option. Wait, no, option J is 190,000.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go again. 5% of $200,000 is $10,000. So, subtract that from $200k gives $190k. But the options don't have that. So maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is part of the net sales for the current period. Let me think: If the company expects 5% of sales to be returned, then the net sales would be total sales minus returns. But the returns are of prior months, so the current period's net sales are 200k -10k=190k. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the $5k is part of the net sales for the current period.

No, that doesn't make sense. Because the $5k would be part of the prior period's net sales. So, the current period's net sales are 200k minus (5% of 200k) =190k. But the options don't have 190. So perhaps the options are wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is the amount of returns from the prior period that have been written off and are now included in the current period's net sales. So, perhaps the net sales would be the current sales minus the current returns (10k) plus the prior returns (5k), but that doesn't make sense because prior returns would have already been subtracted in the previous accounting period.

Wait, no. Because in the previous period, the company wrote off $5k in returns. These are part of the previous period's net sales and are not part of the current period's net. So, the current period's net sales are 200k minus the current 5% returns (10k), giving 190k. But the options don't have that. So, maybe the question is considering the $5k as part of the current period's returns, which would mean that the net sales are 200k minus 10k, but that's 190k, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the company's net sales are calculated as total sales minus the estimated returns. So, 200k - (5% of 200k) = 190k. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the question is considering the $5k as part of the net sales for the current period. No, that can't be right because that would imply that the $5k is part of the current net sales, which would require that the returns for the current period are less than 5% of the total sales.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is the amount of the prior returns that are being accounted for in the current period. So, the current period's net sales are 200k minus the current 5% returns (10k) plus the prior 5k. Wait, that seems incorrect because prior returns would be part of the previous period's net sales, which are already subtracted.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is part of the net sales, but that doesn't make sense because it's a prior return. So, the current period's net sales would be 200k minus 10k (5% of 200k) = 190k. But that's not an option. Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased wrong.

Wait, wait another way: Maybe the $5k is a return from the previous period that's now part of the current net sales. So, perhaps the current period's net sales are 200k minus the current returns (10k) plus the prior returns (5k). So, 200k -10k +5k=195k. Which is option A.

Ah, that makes sense! Because the $5k is the amount of prior returns that are now being included in the current period. So, net sales would be 200k minus (5% of 200k) plus 5k. So 200k -10k =190k plus 5k=195k. So, 195k is option A.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the prior period's returns are already subtracted from the previous net, they wouldn't be part of the current period's net sales. So, the $5k is part of the previous period's accounting, not current. So, the current net sales should be 200k minus current returns (10k) =190k. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the $5k is the amount of returns that have been written off in prior months, so they are part of the prior net sales, not the current. So, the current period's net sales would be 200k minus 10k =190k, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate net sales as total sales minus the expected returns. So 200k -10k=190k, but that's not one of the options. Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option J:190,000. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is 195k.

Wait, maybe the $5k is the amount that's part of the current period's returns, but only 5% of the prior period's. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the company expects 5% of the prior period's sales to be returned, not the current period's. But the question states that the company estimates 5% of sales will be returned within the 90-day period.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is the amount of prior period's returns, but the current period's net sales are calculated as total sales minus the current period's returns plus the prior returns. Because, for example, the company might have a policy that returns a portion of prior sales as part of the current period's net. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the $5k is the amount of prior returns that have been written off, so they are part of the prior net sales. So, in the current period, net sales are 200k minus (5% of 200k) equals 190k. But that's not among the options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, alternative approach: Let me re-read the question.

"The company allows customers to return shoes within 90 days. The company estimates 5% of sales will be returned within the 90-day period. During the month, the company has sales of $200,000 and returns of sales made in prior months of $5,000. What amount should the company record as net sales revenue for new sales made during the month?"

Ah, so net sales is the total sales minus the returns. So, 200k - (5% of 200k) =190k. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the $5k is part of the net sales calculation, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of revenue. Net sales is total sales minus the amount that's expected to be returned. So, that's 200k -10k=190k. But no option is 190k. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is the amount of returns that have been written off in the prior period, and thus are part of the prior period's net sales. So, when calculating the current period's net sales, only the 5% of the current sales is subtracted. So, net sales is 200k -10k=190k. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is J, 190k.

But wait, looking at the options, J is 190,000. So, that would be the answer, but I'm a bit confused because I thought perhaps it's 195k. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5k is the amount of returns in the current period that are already written off. So, if 5% of current sales is returned, and the prior returns are 5k, then the net sales would be 200k - (5% of 200k +5k) = 200k - (10k +5k)=185k. Which is option G.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me calculate that. 5% of 200k is 10k, plus the 5k written off (prior) would be 15k. So 200k -15k =185k, which is option G. But why would the 5k prior returns be added?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because prior returns are part of the previous period's net, not the current. So, the current period's net sales would be 200k -10k =190k. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct approach is to subtract only 10k, making the answer 190k, which is not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the $5k is part of the current period's returns, so the net sales would be 200k - (5% of 200k) + (5k). Wait, that would be 200k -10k +5k=195k, which is option A.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because if the company expects 5% of the current sales to be returned, and also wrote off 5k in prior, perhaps the current period's net sales are 200k minus the current returns, plus the prior returns (since they were already written off). No, I think that's incorrect, because the prior returns have already been accounted for.

Wait, maybe the $5k is the amount of returns in the current period that were not written off yet. No, that doesn't make sense.

Another way: The company's net sales is calculated as the total sales minus the returns that are expected to be returned. So, 200k -10k=190k. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem is that the $5k is part of the prior period's returns, which are already included in the net sales of the previous period. So, the current period's net sales would not include that, but the current period's net sales should subtract the current returns, which is 10k, giving 190k.

But the options don't have 190. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's see: 5% of 200k is 10k, so 200k-10k=190k. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest option is J, 190k. But why would that be correct?

Wait, perhaps the question's wording is different. Maybe the $5k is the amount of returns that have been written off in the prior period, and that's part of the prior period's net sales. So, the current period's net sales are calculated as 200k (current sales) minus the expected current returns (10k) plus the prior returns (5k). So, 200k -10k +5k=195k. So, the answer would be A, 195k.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because prior returns are not part of current sales. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the $5k is the amount of returns that have been written off from the current period. For example, if the company had a policy that 5% of current sales are returned, but in the past, they had written off 5k, so the current period's returns are 5k. So, net sales would be 200k -5k=195k. But that's the same as the first approach where the 5k is subtracted from the current returns.

Wait, let me think differently. The company's net sales is the total sales minus the estimated returns. The estimated returns are 5% of current sales, which is 10k. So, net sales is 190k. But none of the options are 190k. So, perhaps the correct approach is to subtract the 5% of the current sales and add the 5k from the prior. That gives 195k. But why would you add the prior returns?

Alternatively, perhaps the $5k is the amount of returns that have been written off, so they're already part of the prior period's net sales. So, the current period's net sales are 200k minus the current returns (10k), plus the prior returns (5k) because they were already written off. So, 200k -10k +5k=195k. So, the answer would be A, 195k.

But I'm not sure if that approach is correct. It seems a bit odd to subtract the prior returns again. So, perhaps the correct way is that the $5k is part of the prior period's net sales, so the current period's net sales are 200k minus the current returns (10k). So, 190k, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that's not possible. So, I think I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the $5k is part of the current period's expected returns, so the net is 200k minus 10k, which is 190k. So, why would the options have 195k? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the $5k is the amount of prior returns that are recorded as current period's net, so the current period's net would subtract 10k and add 5k, leading to 195k. That approach makes sense because the $5k is part of the current period's net sales and should be added back.

So, the calculation would be 200k - (5% of 200k) + 5k = 200k -10k +5k=195k. So, the correct answer is A: 195,000.
</think>

The company's net sales is calculated as total sales minus the estimated returns. The estimated returns are 5% of the current sales, which is $10,000. However, the company also wrote off $5,000 in prior period returns, which are part of the prior period's net sales and should not be included in the current period's net sales.

Thus, the correct calculation is:

$200,000 (current sales) - $10,000 (current returns) + $5,000 (prior returns) = $195,000.

So, the correct answer is A: $195,000.
