Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about John's MPC and break-even point. Hmm, let's see what I remember. MPC stands for Marginal Propensity to Consume, right? And break-even point is where total income equals total spending, so he's not making any profit in that sense.

The question says John's MPC is constant at 3/4. Wait, so that's 0.75. Break-even occurs at $7,000. I need to find out how much he has to borrow when his income is $3,000.

Wait, wait. First, I think I should recall the formula for break-even. I remember something about the break-even point being calculated using the MPC, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the break-even point (BP) in terms of income is where the total spending equals total income. So, total spending is MPC multiplied by income, right?

Wait, let me think. The MPC is the fraction of each additional income that is spent, not saved. So, the break-even point is when total spending equals total income. So, total spending is MPC*(income) + some initial amount, maybe. Wait, no, the MPC is the fraction of additional income that's consumed, so the MPC is the MPC. So, the break-even occurs when income equals MPC times income plus perhaps a base level.

Wait, another approach: the break-even formula is often written as BP = initial autonomous expenditure / MPC. Because autonomous expenditure is the part of spending that doesn't depend on income, like taxes or something. So, when income equals MPC*(income) plus autonomous expenditure, we get to the break-even point.

Wait, so if BP is the break-even income, then BP = autonomous expenditure / MPC.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the break-even is the point where total saving equals total investment, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is: Break-even point (in terms of income) is when the amount saved from income equals the amount that doesn't get spent. So, maybe it's when MPC*(income) = income - autonomous.

Alternatively, wait, noâ€”maybe I should think about the MPC and MPC's relationship when considering saving.

Wait, let me think again. The MPC is the fraction of additional income that is spent. So, if MPC is 3/4, then for every additional dollar earned, 3/4 is saved. So, the MPC is the MPC. But the break-even point is when total spending equals total income.

Wait, the break-even point can be calculated using the formula:

Break-even Income = Autonomous Expenditure / MPC.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because Autonomous Expenditure is the part of spending that doesn't depend on income, like taxes. So, when MPC is 3/4, the MPC is 0.75.

Wait, but the question isn't giving me Autonomous Expenditure. Hmm. Or is it?

Wait, the break-even point is when his total consumption (spending) equals his total income. So, Consumption = MPC * Income + Autonomous Expenditure.

At break-even, Consumption = Income. So,

Income = MPC * Income + Autonomous Expenditure.

Rearranging this, we get:

Autonomous Expenditure = Income - MPC * Income = Income*(1 - MPC).

So, Autonomous Expenditure = MPC * (1 - MPC) * Income? Hmm, no, wait, that can't be right because Autonomous Expenditure is a fixed amount, independent of income. So perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Autonomous Expenditure = MPC * BP.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the break-even point where total saving equals total investment. But I don't think that's directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

BP = Autonomous Expenditure / MPC.

But I'm not 100% certain. Let me try plugging in the numbers given in the problem.

The MPC is 3/4, which is 0.75. The break-even point is given as $7,000. So, BP = $7,000.

Wait, so if BP = Autonomous Expenditure / MPC, then Autonomous Expenditure would be MPC * BP. So, 0.75 * 7,000 = 5,250.

Wait, that would mean Autonomous Expenditure is $5,250. So, when his income is $3,000, how much does he have to borrow?

Wait, but why would he have to borrow money? Because his income is $3,000 and his MPC is 0.75. So, his MPC is 3/4, so 3/4 of 3,000 is 2,250. So, his MPC * income is 0.75 * 3,000 = 2,250.

But at break-even, his total consumption equals his income. So, if his income is 3,000, he would spend 2,250. But to break even, he must have enough savings to cover the rest.

Wait, but the question is about how much he needs to borrow. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me re-read the question.

The question is: How much will John have to borrow when his income is $3,000?

Wait, but if his MPC is 3/4, that means he spends 3/4 of his income. So, when he's earning $3,000, he will spend 3/4 * 3,000 = $2,250. So, his savings would be 3,000 - 2,250 = $750. So, if he has $750 in savings, he doesn't need to borrow anything. Wait, but that doesn't align with the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the break-even point is when he neither saves nor spends any further. Wait, maybe the break-even point is the point where he stops saving, and that's when his income equals his MPC times income plus autonomous expenditure.

Alternatively, perhaps the break-even point is when he has zero savings, meaning that his income is exactly what he needs to cover his MPC times income plus any autonomous expenditure. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

BP = (Autonomous Expenditure) / MPC.

Which would be the same as the break-even point.

Wait, another thought: the MPC is the rate at which income is spent. So, the MPC is the MPC. So, if MPC is 3/4, then each dollar earned is 3/4 spent, and 1/4 saved.

So, when income increases, the MPC is 3/4. So, if his income is $3,000, his MPC * income is $2,250. So, his total spending is $2,250, and his total saving is $750. So, if he has $2,250 in spending, that's his break-even point.

Wait, but the break-even point is when income equals MPC * income plus autonomous expenditure. Wait, I'm not getting this right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Break-even income = (Autonomous Expenditure) / MPC.

So, if MPC is 3/4, and the break-even point is $7,000, then Autonomous Expenditure is MPC * BP = (3/4)*7,000 = $5,250.

So, Autonomous Expenditure is $5,250.

Now, when John's income is $3,000, how much does he need to borrow? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the break-even point is the income level at which his consumption equals his total expenditure, including savings. So, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the MPC is the fraction of additional income that is spent; so, for each additional dollar earned, 3/4 is saved, 1/4 is saved. So, if his break-even point is at $7,000, that means that he saved $7,000 - his spending at that point. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for break-even.

Break-even occurs when total spending equals total income.

Total spending = MPC * Income + Autonomous Expenditure.

At break-even: MPC * Income + AE = Income.

Rearranged: AE = Income (1 - MPC).

So, AE = Income * (1 - MPC).

So, in this problem, we know that the break-even point is $7,000, so:

AE = 7,000 * (1 - 3/4) = 7,000 * 1/4 = $1,750.

So, autonomous expenditure is $1,750.

Now, when John's income is $3,000, what does that mean?

Wait a minute, in this scenario, perhaps the question is about how much he needs to borrow, meaning he has to cover the amount he would spend beyond his income. Or perhaps it's about the amount he needs to have saved beyond his MPC * income.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, when his income is $3,000, his MPC is 3/4, so he will spend 0.75 * 3,000 = $2,250. So, his total spending is $2,250. But to break even, his total spending should equal his total income, which is $3,000. So, he needs to have $750 more than his MPC * income. But wait, if he has $3,000, he can't spend 2,250 and save 750. So, he doesn't need to borrow anything; he can just spend 2,250 and save the rest. So, he doesn't need to borrow anything, which would mean the amount he has to borrow is $0. That's option J.

But looking at the options, J is $0. So, that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I thought the break-even point is when his total spending equals his income. So, at $3,000 income, he's spending 2,250, so his saving is 750. So, he doesn't need to borrow anything because he can use his $3,000 to cover his expenses, and he has $750 in savings. So, he doesn't need to borrow anything. So, he has $0 to borrow.

So, the answer is J: $0.
</think>

The MPC is given as 3/4, and the break-even point is at $7,000. Using the formula for break-even, the Autonomous Expenditure (AE) can be calculated as:

\[
AE = \text{BP} \times (1 - \text{MPC}) = 7,000 \times (1 - 0.75) = 7,000 \times 0.25 = 1,750
\]

Now, when John's income is $3,000, his MPC is 3/4, so his planned spending is:

\[
\text{Spending} = \text{MPC} \times \text{Income} = 0.75 \times 3,000 = 2,250
\]

At break-even, total spending should equal total income. Since John's income is $3,000 and he plans to spend $2,250, he will have $750 in savings. This means he does not need to borrow any money. Therefore, the amount he has to borrow is $0.
