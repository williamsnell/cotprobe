Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the total cost of 4 magazines and 3 books. Let me see, each magazine is $2.99 and each book is $6.99. Hmm, I think I should calculate the cost of the magazines first and then the books, and then add them together.

Alright, let's start with the magazines. If each costs $2.99 and I need 4, then I can multiply 2.99 by 4. Let me do that. 2.99 times 4... wait, 3 times 4 is 12, but since it's 2.99, which is one cent less than 3, I need to subtract 4 cents. So 12 minus 0.04 is 11.96. That's the cost for the magazines.

Now, for the books. Each is $6.99 and I need 3. So I'll multiply 6.99 by 3. Let's see, 7 times 3 is 21, but since each is one cent less, I need to subtract 3 cents. So 21 minus 0.03 is 20.97. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me do it correctly. 6.99 is 7 minus 0.01 each. So 3 times 6.99 would be 3 times 7, which is 21, minus 3 times 0.01, which is 0.03. So 21 minus 0.03 is 20.97. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because 3 times 6 is 18, and 3 times 0.99 is 2.97, so 18 + 2.97 is 20.97. Oh, wait, that's correct. So the books cost $20.97.

Now, I need to add the cost of the magazines and books together. The magazines are $11.96 and the books are $20.97. Adding those together: 11.96 plus 20.97. Let me add the dollars first: 11 + 20 is 31. Then the cents: 96 + 97. 96 + 97 is 193 cents, which is $1.93. So adding that to the $31 gives $32.93. Wait, but let me check my math again. 11.96 + 20.97: 11 + 20 is 31, 0.96 + 0.97 is 1.93. So 31 + 1.93 is indeed 32.93.

Looking at the options, option B is $32.93. So that's the answer.

The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of magazines and books by their respective prices and then adding them together. The magazines cost $11.96 and the books cost $20.97, totaling $32.93. 

Answer: B: $32.93
