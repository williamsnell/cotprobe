Okay, so I've got this problem about the temperature dropping between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M. It starts at 84°F at 10 P.M., and it drops by 11°F by then. I need to find the temperature at 6 P.M. So, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably set up an equation to represent the situation. The temperature at 10 P.M. is given as 84°F, and the drop is 11°F. Since the temperature is dropping, I know that the 11°F is subtracted from the original temperature. So, if I let t be the temperature at 6 P.M., then t must be higher than 84°F because it's the temperature at a later time when it's warmer.

So, the equation would be t minus 11°F equals the temperature at 10 P.M., which is 84°F. So, t - 11 = 84. Hmm, wait, but looking at the options, I don't see t - 11 = 84. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A: 84 − t = 11; 73°F
B: 84 − 11 = t; 73°F
C: t + 11 = 84; 73°F
D: t + 84 = 11; -73°F
E: t - 84 = 11; -73°F
F: 11 - t = 84; -73°F
G: 84 - t = 11; 11°F
H: t − 11 = 84; 95°F

Wait, option B is 84 minus 11 equals t, which would be 73°F. But then option G says 84 - t = 11, which would solve to t = 73. Because if 84 - t = 11, then t = 84 -11 = 73. So that would be correct. So, the equation is 84 - t = 11, and solving that gives t=73°F.

Wait, but let me think again. The temperature at 10 P.M. is 84°F, it's dropping by 11°F. So, the temperature at 6 P.M. must be higher than 84°F. So, if t is the temperature at 6 P.M., then t must be 84 + 11 = 95°F. Wait, that doesn't match any of the equations except perhaps option G.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I got the direction wrong. Oh, wait, the problem says the temperature dropped 11°F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M. So, from 6 P.M. to 10 P.M. (which is 4 hours), the temperature went down 11°F. So, the temperature at 6 P.M. was warmer than at 10 P.M.

So, if T6PM is the temperature at 6 P.M., then T10PM = T6PM - 11°F = 84°F. So, T6PM = 84 + 11 = 95°F.

Wait, but let's look at the options again. Option G says 84 - t =11. Solving that gives t=73. Which would set up the equation as 84 -73=11, which is correct because 84-73=11. So, t would be 73°F, which would be the temperature at 6 P.M. But according to my calculation, it should be 95°F.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the setup. The problem says the temperature dropped 11°F, meaning it went down by 11°F. So, the equation should be T10PM = T6PM - 11. Given that T10PM is 84, then 84 = T6PM -11. Therefore, solving for T6PM gives T6PM = 84 +11 = 95°F.

Looking at the options, none of them have 84 +11 = t. Let me check the options again. Option G is 84 - t = 11, which would imply t =84 -11=73. That would mean T6PM -11 =84? No, that can't be right. Wait, if the equation is T6PM -11=84, then T6PM would be 95. So, that's correct.

So, the correct equation is T6PM -11 =84. So, that would be option B if it's 84 - t=11, but no. Wait, option B is 84 -11 = t. That suggests T6PM =84-11=73, which would mean the temperature at 6 PM is 73, but that's contradictory because it should have increased. So, perhaps I'm getting the setup wrong.

Wait, the equation should be T6PM -11 =84°F. So, T6PM =84 +11=95. Now, looking for an equation that leads to this. The options:

A: 84 − t =11 → t=73. So, T6PM=73. Incorrect.

B:84−11= t → t=73. So, same as A, so T6PM=73. Incorrect.

C: t+11=84 → t=73. So, T6PM=73. Incorrect.

D:t+84=11 → t=-73. So, T6PM=-73. Incorrect.

E:t−84=11 → t=95. So, T6PM=95. That's correct.

Option E: t−84=11 → t=95. So, equation is T6PM−84=11 → T6PM=95. Correct.

So, option E says t -84=11, and the solution is t=95°F. Wait, but the temperature at 6 P.M. was 95? But it's dropping 11°F from 95 to 84 at 10 P.M. Because 95-11=84. Yes, that makes sense. So, option E is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 84 - t =11. Solving that gives t=73, which is wrong because the temperature at 6 P.M. is 95, not 73. So, option G is incorrect.

So, the correct equation is t -84=11 → t=95. So, option E is correct. But wait, looking at the options, option G is 84 - t =11, which would give t=73. That's incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I misread the equation. Let me look again.

Wait, the problem says the temperature dropped by 11°F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M. So, the temperature at 10 P.M. is 84°F, which is 11°F less than at 6 P.M. So, T6PM =84 +11=95°F. So, the equation should be T6PM -11=84 → T6PM=95.

Which is the same as t -11=84 → t=95. That's correct. So, option E's equation is t -84=11 → t=95. So, option E is correct.

Wait, but the equation in option E is t -84=11. So, t=95. That's correct. So, the correct equation is option E. So, the answer would be E. However, looking at the options, option G is 84 - t =11, which is wrong because t would be 73 and gives a wrong result.

So, the correct option is E.
</think>

The temperature at 10 P.M. is 84°F, and it dropped by 11°F by 6 P.M. To find the temperature at 6 P.M., we set up the equation \( t - 11 = 84 \), where \( t \) is the temperature at 6 P.M. Solving for \( t \) gives \( t = 95°F \). Comparing this to the options, option E correctly states the equation and the temperature.
