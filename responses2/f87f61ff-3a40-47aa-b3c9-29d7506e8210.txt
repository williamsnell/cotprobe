Question:

A state in which several popular ski resorts are located has enacted a law requiring state certification of ski instructors. Under the law, applicants for certification must attend a monthlong course, pass a test, and pay a fee of $1,000. The stated purpose of the law is to "promote uniformity in the methods of ski instruction at the state's ski areas." Shortly before the law's enactment, when the state did not require certification of ski instructors, a woman moved to the state intending to find employment as a ski instructor. The woman had been a ski instructor in another state for many years. But since her move, even though ski resorts in the state have found her to be highly qualified, no resort will offer her a contract for employment as a ski instructor because she has not received the required state certification. As applied to the woman, does the state certification requirement constitute a violation of the contracts clause?

Options:

A: Yes, because the requirement substantially impairs her ability to contract for employment in the absence of an important government objective.
B: Yes, because the law was enacted after she moved to the state.
C: No, because the law is necessary for the safety of skiers.
D: No, because her ability to contract for employment with the state is not being impaired.
E: Yes, because the law restricts her freedom to engage in her profession.
F: Yes, because, as applied to an otherwise qualified ski instructor, the requirement is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
G: Yes, because the certification requirement is too costly and time-consuming.
H: No, because the certification requirement is intended to standardize ski instruction.
I: No, because she has no existing contract that is being impaired.
J: No, because the law applies to all ski instructors equally.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about contracts and the law requiring state certification for ski instructors. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question sets up that a state has a law requiring state certification for ski instructors. The purpose of the law is to promote uniformity in instruction methods. Before the law, instructors needed to pass a test and pay $1,000. Now, some ski resorts won't hire her because she hasn't taken the certification test.

The woman moved to the state intending to become a ski instructor. She's been one in another state for many years. But even though resorts found her highly qualified, they can't offer a contract because she hasn't taken the required certification.

The question is whether this certification requirement is a violation of the contracts clause. The options are A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that the contracts clause (also known as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Clause 6(a)) protects businesses from being unfairly excluded from contracts because of unreasonable demands. So, if a law imposes a significant requirement that would prevent someone from entering into a contract, it could be a violation.

In this case, the law is about certification of ski instructors. The purpose was to promote uniformity, which makes sense. But now, without certification, the state can't offer a contract. That seems like a strong reason to believe the law is impeding employment.

Looking at the options, option A says the requirement impairs her ability to contract. That directly ties into the contracts clause. Option B says the law was enacted after she moved, but even if the law was passed after her move, it's still about whether the law impairs her ability to contract. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C suggests it's cost too much, but the law is $1,000, which is a lot. So maybe it's justified, but the question is about whether it's a violation of the contracts clause, not just cost.

Option D says her ability isn't impaired. But the law prevents her from applying, so that's a violation. So D is not correct.

Option E talks about freedom of profession, but the law is about certification, not the right to choose a profession. So E doesn't apply.

Option F says the requirement isn't rationally related. But the problem is the cost and the fact that the law is necessary for safety. It's a legitimate government interest, so F is incorrect.

Option G says the law is too costly and time-consuming. The $1,000 fee is a significant cost. But if it's necessary for safety, it's justified. So G might not be the answer.

Option H says it's to standardize instruction. While it's about uniformity, that's more about the effect of the law, not whether it's a violation of the contracts clause. So H is not the right reason.

Option I says she has no existing contract. But the law makes it impossible, so that's a violation regardless.

Option J says the law applies to all ski instructors. There's no indication of that, so J is not relevant.

So the key point is whether the certification requirement impairs her ability to contract. The law makes it impossible for her to get a job, so it's a violation of the contracts clause.

The state certification law for ski instructors makes it difficult for the woman to acquire employment as a ski instructor because she must pass the test and pay the fee. This impairs her ability to enter into a contract, directly addressing the contracts clause. 

Answer: A
