Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the share of global deaths by suicide in 2017. The options are A through J, each with a percentage. 

Hmm, I remember that suicide is a big issue, especially in low-income countries. I think the numbers might be in the 1% or 2% range. Let me try to recall any recent data. 

Wait, I think the 2017 statistics might have been around 1.4% or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have heard that it's around 2.8% or 3.2%, but I'm not certain. 

Another approach: think about the options. Option G is 2.80%, which is pretty close. But I'm not certain if that's the correct number. Oh, and option F is 6.80%, which seems higher. 

Wait, I think the 2017 figure was actually around 1.4% of deaths were due to suicide. But I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the global suicide rate has been rising. Maybe the figure for 2017 was lower than the current rate, which is around 1-2% now. 

So between G (2.8%) and F (6.8%), I'm more confident that 2.8% is the correct answer. But wait, another thought: I've heard that the number could have been higher. Let me think about when I studied this. Oh, I think in 2017, the estimate was around 1.4%. So option H is 3.2%, which is higher than that. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the source. The World Health Organization's data from 2017: According to WHO, around 1.4% of deaths were due to suicide in 2017. That would make option H (3.2%) incorrect. 

So wait, there's a discrepancy here. Earlier, I thought 2.8%, but now I'm recalling 1.4%. Let me double-check. Maybe the correct number is 1.4%, which is option H. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the sources. 

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is 0.7%, option G. No, that doesn't seem right. I think the 2017 number was 1.4%. So the correct answer should be H: 3.2%? No, wait, that's higher than 1.4%. Alternatively, maybe it's 1.4% but I'm getting confused. 

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the data. Let me try to think again. I think the 2017 data: approximately 1.4% of global deaths were due to suicide. So option H is 3.2%, which is higher. So perhaps that's incorrect. 

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me structure this. 

Option H is 3.2%, which is higher than 1.4%, so if the correct answer was 1.4%, H wouldn't be correct. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. I think I read that the 2017 figure was around 1.4%, which would make option H incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is another option. 

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the 2017 figure with the current one. Let me see. The 2017 statistics might have been higher, but the current rate is lower. For example, the 2017 rate was 1.4%, and it's increasing now. So 2017 is 1.4%, which is option H. Or was it lower? I'm a bit stuck. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 2017 number was 0.7% (G) or 6.8% (F). I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is 3.2% (H), but I'm not certain. 

Wait, another thought: I think the 2017 figure is 1.4%, which is option H. But I'm confused because earlier I thought of another figure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G: 2.8%, which is higher than 1.4% but lower than 3.2%. 

Wait, I'm getting myself tied up here. Let me try to think of another approach. Perhaps I should remember that in 2017, approximately 1.4% of deaths were due to suicide. So that would point to option H: 3.2% is higher than that, so it's incorrect. So maybe the correct answer is another option, perhaps option G: 2.8%? Or option F:6.8%, which is even higher. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1.4%, which is option H. But wait, I'm getting conflicting information. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact figure. I think the 2017 figure was around 1.4%, so option H isn't correct. So the correct answer must be another option. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option G: 2.8%, based on another source. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F:6.8%, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps I confuse the data. Let me try to think of what I know. I remember that in 2017, the number was 1.4% (as per WHO), making option H incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is option G:2.8%, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me look up the exact figure. (But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on what I remember.) 

Ah, I think the 2017 data shows that about 1.4% of global deaths were due to suicide. So the correct answer would be option H:3.2% which is higher than 1.4%. Wait, that would mean H is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is another option. 

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the 2017 and 2018 numbers. Or perhaps the correct answer is option G:2.8%? No, that's higher than 1.4%, so it would not fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F:6.8%? That's way higher. No, that can't be right. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: think about the answer options. The options are A)7.90%, B)5.60%, C)0.70%, D)10.30%, E)9.10%, F)6.80%, G)2.80%, H)3.20%, I)1.40%, J)4.50%. 

Wait, the correct answer would be 1.4%, which is option I. So option I is the answer. But earlier I thought option H was 3.2%, which is higher. 

Wait, another angle: perhaps the 2017 figure was around 1.4%, so option H is not correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option G (2.8%)? No, that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the number was 0.7% (G), which is lower. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 3.2% (H), but I thought 2017's data was 1.4%. 

Wait, maybe I should recheck. I think the 2017 data actually had a suicide rate of around 1.4%, making option H (3.2%) incorrect. So then the correct answer would be another option. 

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up 2017 and 2016. Let me think: 2016, the numbers were different. Oh, but the question is 2017. 

I think I'm out of time here. I'll have to make a choice. Based on what I remember, the 2017 figure was 1.4%, which is option I. So the answer is option I:1.40%.

The correct answer is option I: 1.40%.
