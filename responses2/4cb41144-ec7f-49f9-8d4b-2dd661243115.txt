Question:

There are 20 students in Mr. Clark's fourth-grade class. There are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class. Which equation can be used to determine the number of students, n, in the entire fourth grade?

Options:

A: 20x5=n
B: n=5/20
C: 5xn= 20
D: 20+5=n
E: n=20-5
F: 5+20=n
G: 20/n=5
H: 5n=20

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about figuring out how many students are in the entire fourth grade, based on the information given about Mr. Clark's class. Let me read the problem again.

There are 20 students in Mr. Clark's fourth-grade class. It says there are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in the class. So, the class has 20, and the whole grade is 5 times that. 

Hmm, so I need to find the total number of students in the entire fourth grade, which is n. Let me think about the relationship here. If the class has 20 students, and the whole grade is 5 times that, then n should be 5 multiplied by 20. 

Wait, let me put that into an equation. So 5 times the class size equals the total number. So 5 times 20, which is 100. So n would be 100. 

Looking at the options, option H is 5n=20. Wait, no. Let me check each option. 

Option A is 20x5=n. That would be 100, which is correct. Because 5 times 20 is 100. So n would be 100. So option A is 20 multiplied by 5 equals n. That makes sense because 20 is the class size, multiplied by 5 gives the total.

Other options: Option B is n=5/20, which would be 0.25. That can't be right because the whole grade is much bigger than the class. Option C is 5 multiplied by n equals 20, which would mean n is 4, which is way too small. Option D is 20+5=n, which is 25, which is not correct because adding 5 times would be 25, but the total should be 5 times 20. Option E is n=20-5=15, which is again too small. Option F is 5+20=25, same issue. Option G is 20/n=5, which implies n=4. Again, that's wrong because 5 times the class size is larger. Option H is 5n=20. Wait, that would mean n=20/5=4. Which again can't be right because that would make the class size 4 and the total 20, which is not what the question states. 

Wait, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the problem. The class has 20 students. The entire fourth grade has 5 times as many as the class. So the class is 20, and the total is 5*20=100. So n should be 100. So the equation is 5 times n equals 20? No, wait, no. Wait, no, because if n is the total, then n=5 times the class. The class is 20, so n=5*20=100.

Looking again, option H is 5n=20. Let me plug in n=100 into that. 5 times 100 is 500, which is not equal to 20. So that's not correct. So what's wrong with the other options.

Option A: 20x5=n â†’ 20*5=100 =n. That's correct. So option A is the right equation.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are involved, the equations can sometimes be tricky. Let me think again. The class has 20 students. The total is 5 times that, so n=5*20=100. So the equation should express that n equals 5 multiplied by 20. So 5 times n equals 20? No, that's incorrect because 5n=20 would mean n=4, which is wrong. So the correct equation is n=5*20, which is option A.

Alternatively, some people might set up the equation as 20 multiplied by 5 equals n, which is what option A says. So yes, option A is 20x5=n, which is 100=n.

The correct equation is option A: \(20 \times 5 = n\).
