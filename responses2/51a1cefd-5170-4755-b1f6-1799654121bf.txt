Okay, so I've got this question about insurance coverage, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Mr. Fields owns a house worth $30,000. He insures it with a $20,000 fire insurance policy that has an 80% coinsurance clause. Because of a fire, the house is damaged to the extent of $10,800. The question is, how much will the insurance company pay on the loss?

Hmm. I remember that coinsurance is a clause that ensures both the insured and the insured party agree to protect the insured from partial or total loss beyond a certain point. The coinsurance clause typically requires the insured to cover a certain percentage of the loss, up to a maximum. 

In this case, the coinsurance clause is 80%. So, the insured (Mr. Fields' insurance company) must cover 80% of the actual damage. But wait, I should double-check: does the coinsurance clause work on the insurance's coverage or the actual damage? I think it's based on the insurance's coverage. So the insurance company's policy is for $20,000, and they have an 80% coinsurance clause, meaning they have to cover 80% of the damage.

The actual damage is $10,800. So, the insurance company's payment would be 80% of $10,800. Let me calculate that: 0.8 * 10,800. Hmm, 10,000 times 0.8 is 8,000, and 800 times 0.8 is 640. So 10,800 * 0.8 = 8,800.

Wait, but wait a second. There's also the idea that sometimes the coinsurance clause might cap the payment at the policy's coverage or the damage itself. Oh, wait, the policy's coverage is $20,000, which is more than the damage here. So in this scenario, the payment would be the lesser of 80% of the actual damage or the policy's coverage.

So 80% of 10,800 is 8,800, which is less than $20,000. So the insurance company would pay $8,800. But looking at the options, I don't see an option of $8,800. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A: $8,000, B: $10,800, C: $6,000, D: $9,000, E: $12,000, F: $7,200, G: $10,000, H: $20,000, I: $24,000, J: $8,640.

Wait, none of these options is $8,800. Did I make a mistake? Let me re-examine the problem.

The house is worth $30,000. The insurance is $20,000. The coinsurance is 80%. The damage is $10,800.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, sometimes the coinsurance clause is applied to the policy's value, but here, the policy is for $20,000, but the damage is $10,800. So the coinsurance clause is 80%, so the insurance company must cover 80% of the damage. So 10,800 * 0.8 = 8,640.

Wait, but wait again. Let me calculate 10,800 multiplied by 0.8.

10,800 * 0.8 = 8,640. Oh! So that would be option J ($8,640). But earlier I thought the payment would be 8,800, but that's because I thought the insurance policy covers $20,000, but wait, wait. Wait, noâ€”the coinsurance clause is on the damage, not the policy's coverage. So it's 80% of the actual damage.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The coinsurance clause says that the insured must cover a certain percentage of the loss. So if the loss is $10,800 and the coinsurance is 80%, then 0.8 * 10,800 = 8,640.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the coinsurance clause is on the policy's coverage. So the policy covers $20,000. If the damage is $10,800, the insurance company can only cover 80% of that, which is 80% of 10,800, which is 8,640. So that would match option J.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that the coinsurance clause works on the damage, not the policy's coverage. Let me try to recall the exact wording: "coinsurance clause (COINSURANCE CLAUSE) is a provision which ensures that both parties agree to protect each other against loss beyond a certain amount."

In this case, the insurance policy's coverage is $20,000. So, the policy's coverage is $20,000, but the coinsurance clause is 80% on the damage. So the insurance company must cover 80% of the damage, which is $10,800 * 0.8 = $8,640. So the payment would be $8,640, which is option J.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is $8,640. So that's the answer. But why is option B $10,800? Because that's the actual damage, but that's probably not the case here.

So, the correct answer should be J: $8,640.

The correct answer is J: $8,640. 

**Explanation:**
The question involves applying an 80% coinsurance clause to a $10,800 damage. The coinsurance clause requires the insured (Mr. Fields' insurance company) to cover 80% of the actual loss. Calculating 80% of $10,800:

\[
0.8 \times 10,800 = 8,640
\]

Thus, the insurance company will pay $8,640 on the loss.

**Answer:** J: $8,640
