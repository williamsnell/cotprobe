Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about an inductor and the voltage across it. Hmm, okay, I remember from my studies that inductors have some relationship between the current through them and the voltage across them, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

The question says the current is given by i_L(t) = 0.1 sin(10^6 t). I need to find the voltage across the inductor, ν_L(t). Oh wait, right! The formula for voltage across an inductor is ν_L = L * di/dt. So it's the inductance multiplied by the derivative of the current with respect to time.

Let me plug in the numbers. The inductance L is 10^-3 henry. The current is 0.1 sin(10^6 t). So, I'll take the derivative of that current with respect to time t. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), but I have to multiply by the coefficient and the derivative of the inside function.

So, di/dt would be 0.1 * 10^6 cos(10^6 t). Wait, what's 10^6? Oh, that's 1,000,000. So multiplying 0.1 by 1e6 gives 100. So di/dt is 100 cos(10^6 t). 

Now multiply that by L, which is 1e-3. So ν_L(t) = 1e-3 * 100 cos(10^6 t). Let me calculate that. 1e-3 times 100 is 0.1. So ν_L(t) = 0.1 cos(10^6 t).

Wait, but looking at the options, one option is 0.1 cos, which is option E. But I thought that voltage across an inductor leads the current. Oh wait, wait a second! Oh, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, no. The voltage across an inductor lags the current by a phase of 90 degrees. Because in an inductor, the current tries to oppose the change in current, so the voltage is out of phase. So if the current is sin, the voltage is cos, which is lagging.

But in this case, the current is sin(1e6 t), and the voltage is 0.1 cos(1e6 t). So that's correct because the voltage is lagging, meaning it's a cosine function. So option E is 0.1 cos(1e6 t), which matches.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see E is 0.1cos1e6t. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait another thing, sometimes I get confused between inductors and capacitors. Oh right, with capacitors, the voltage leads the current. So for inductors, the voltage is behind (cosine), current is sine. So I think I'm right.

So the correct answer is E: 0.1cos1e6t.

To determine the voltage across an inductor, we use the formula \( \nu_L = L \frac{di_L}{dt} \). Given the current \( i_L(t) = 0.1 \sin(10^6 t) \) and inductance \( L = 10^{-3} \, \text{H} \), we first compute the derivative of the current:

\[
\frac{di_L}{dt} = 0.1 \cdot 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) = 100 \cos(10^6 t).
\]

Substituting into the voltage formula:

\[
\nu_L(t) = L \frac{di_L}{dt} = 10^{-3} \cdot 100 \cos(10^6 t) = 0.1 \cos(10^6 t).
\]

Since the current is a sine function, the voltage across the inductor lags, represented by a cosine function. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.1cos10^6t**
