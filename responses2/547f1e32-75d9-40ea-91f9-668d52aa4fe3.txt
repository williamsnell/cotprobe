Question:

A disadvantage of the contention approach for LANs, such as CSMA/CD, is the capacity wasted due to multiple stations attempting to access the channel at the same time. Suppose that time is divided into discrete slots, with each of 5 stations attempting to transmit with probability 0.35 during each slot. What fraction of slots is wasted due to multiple simultaneous transmission attempts?

Options:

A: 0.465
B: 0.654
C: 0.572
D: 0.743
E: 0.501
F: 0.217
G: 0.599
H: 0.389
I: 0.125
J: 0.308

Okay, so I've got this question about the contention approach in LANs, specifically about CSMA/CD. The question is about finding the fraction of slots wasted due to multiple simultaneous attempts to transmit. 

Let me think. I remember that CSMA/CD uses a medium access control protocol where stations try to transmit, but if they collide, they wait until a collision is resolved. The question mentions that each of 5 stations has a probability of 0.35 of transmitting in each slot. 

Wait, so the problem is asking for the fraction of slots where more than one station is transmitting at the same time. That would mean the slot is wasted because of contention, right? So I need to calculate the probability that more than one station is transmitting simultaneously.

Hmm, to compute this, maybe I should consider the scenarios where 0, 1, 2, ..., up to 5 stations are transmitting. But since we're looking for the cases where it's more than one, I need the sum of probabilities for 2,3,4,5 stations transmitting. 

But wait, calculating each of those probabilities sounds time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way. Oh, I think the binomial probability formula would work here. The probability that exactly k stations transmit is C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of stations, p is the probability each transmits.

So, n is 5, p is 0.35. I need to compute the probability that k >=2, which is 1 - (probability that 0 transmits + probability that 1 transmits).

Let me compute that. Let's calculate P(k=0) and P(k=1), then subtract their sum from 1.

P(k=0) = C(5,0)*(0.35)^0*(0.65)^5. C(5,0)=1, 0.35^0=1, 0.65^5 is (0.65)^5. Let me calculate that: 0.65^5. Let's see, 0.65 squared is 0.4225. Cubed is 0.4225 *0.65 = approx 0.2746. 0.2746 *0.65 is about 0.1785. 0.1785 *0.65 is approximately 0.1159. So P(k=0) is approximately 0.1159.

Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 0.65^5:

0.65^2 = 0.4225
0.65^3 = 0.4225 * 0.65 = 0.274625
0.65^4 = 0.274625 * 0.65 = 0.17850625
0.65^5 = 0.17850625 *0.65 = 0.1159285625

So P(k=0) ≈ 0.1159.

Now P(k=1) = C(5,1) * (0.35)^1 * (0.65)^4. C(5,1)=5. 0.35 * 0.17850625. Let's compute that: 0.35 * 0.1785 is 0.062476875. So P(k=1)=5 * 0.062476875 = 0.312384375.

So the total probability of 0 or 1 transmitting is 0.1159 + 0.312384375 = 0.428284375.

Therefore, the probability that more than one station is transmitting is 1 - 0.428284375 = 0.571715625.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.572. That matches closely. So the fraction of slots wasted is approximately 0.572, so the answer should be option C.

To determine the fraction of slots wasted due to multiple simultaneous transmissions in a CSMA/CD protocol with 5 stations each transmitting with probability 0.35, we calculate the probability that more than one station transmits. Using the binomial distribution:

1. Calculate P(k=0):  
   \[
   P(k=0) = C(5,0) \cdot (0.35)^0 \cdot (0.65)^5 \approx 0.1159
   \]

2. Calculate P(k=1):  
   \[
   P(k=1) = C(5,1) \cdot (0.35)^1 \cdot (0.65)^4 \approx 0.312384
   \]

3. Sum these probabilities:  
   \[
   P(k=0) + P(k=1) \approx 0.1159 + 0.312384 = 0.4283
   \]

4. Subtract from 1 to find P(k ≥ 2):  
   \[
   P(k \geq 2) = 1 - 0.4283 = 0.5717
   \]

The closest option to 0.5717 is **0.572 (Option C)**.
