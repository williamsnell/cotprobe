Okay, so I've got this question about the Intelligence Quotient, or IQ. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that IQ is a measure of intelligence, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula. Let me try to recall. I think it's calculated using some sort of ratio involving different age-related terms.

Wait, the options are A through J, each giving different combinations of chronological age, mental age, performance score, etc., multiplied by 100 or not. So the question is about defining the IQ correctly.

I think the standard formula is something like (mental age / chronological age) × 100. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard it defined as (mental age × 100) divided by chronological age. Or was it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, I remember reading that IQ tests measure a person's mental age relative to their chronological age. So the mental age is how much they've achieved in their age. So if someone is 10 years old and scores high on a test, their mental age would be close to 10, but maybe higher if they can solve more complex problems.

Wait no, maybe it's the other way around. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think: what's the definition. Oh right, the formula is (mental age / chronological age) × 100. So for someone of average age, say 10, their IQ would be based on their mental age relative to 10.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: chronological age/verbal score ×100. That seems off because I don't think verbal score is part of the standard definition. Verbal IQ, like the Wechsler test, uses verbal reasoning and might be a different scale.

Option B: mental age/performance score ×100. Product of mental age and performance score? That doesn't seem right. The product would be a two-factor measure, which doesn't make sense for a single index like IQ.

Option C: chronological age/performance score ×100. Wait, performance score. So that's like (CA / PS) ×100. But I'm not sure why you'd divide chronological age by performance score. That doesn't ring a bell.

Option D: verbal score/chronological age ×100. That would be (VS / CA) ×100. But I think verbal IQ is usually calculated as (VS / CA) ×100 as well. So D and B are similar but perhaps B is the same as D.

Option E: verbal score/performance score ×100. So (VS / PS) ×100. That doesn't sound familiar to me.

Option F: chronological age/mental age ×100. So (CA / MA) ×100. Wait, that's the same as option J, which is the same as option F. I think I've heard that the formula is (MA / CA) ×100, so this would be the inverse.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard formula is (mental age / chronological age) ×100. So the answer would be option J: mental age/chronological age ×100.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's see the options again:

Options:

A: chronological age/verbal ×100 → No, verbal isn't part of the formula.

B: mental age/perf. score ×100 → Product, not ratio.

C: chronological/perf. ×100 → No.

D: verbal/CA ×100 → Same as B? Or is it a different formula?

Wait, no, I think both B and D are similar but not the same. Let me think about what I've learned before. The IQ formula is typically (mental age × 100) divided by chronological age. So (MA×100)/CA.

So that would match option J: (mental age/chronological age) ×100. Because that's MA/CA ×100, which is the same as (MA ×100)/CA.

Wait, but another way to write it is (MA/CA) ×100. So yes, that's option J.

So looking at the options, option J is mental age/chronological age ×100.

So the correct answer should be J.
</think>

The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is calculated as the ratio of a person's mental age to their chronological age, multiplied by 100. This ensures the result is dimensionless and comparable across different age groups. Among the options provided, the correct formula is represented by option J: mental age/chronological age × 100.

Answer: J
