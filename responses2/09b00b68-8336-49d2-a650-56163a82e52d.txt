Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating a Riemann Sum for a double integral over a rectangle. Let me try to unpack this step by step. 

The rectangle R is given as [1, 2.5] in the x-direction and [1, 2] in the y-direction. So, it's a rectangle that goes from x=1 to x=2.5 and y=1 to y=2. The integral we're dealing with is the double integral of xy over R, and we're supposed to approximate it using a Riemann sum with S_{3,2}. 

Wait, Riemann sum for double integrals... I remember that for double integrals, we divide the region into small rectangles (or subrectangles) and evaluate the function at a sample point, then sum up the areas multiplied by the function's value at those points. The type of sample points can vary, like the lower-left, upper-right, or maybe the center. Here, the problem specifies using the lower-left vertex as the sample points.

So, S_{3,2} suggests that we're dividing the rectangle into 3 subintervals in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction. Wait, actually, wait: The subscript is S_{m,n}, where m is the number of subintervals in x and n in y. So here, m=3 and n=2. 

Let me visualize the rectangle. The x-range is from 1 to 2.5, which is 1.5 units long. Dividing that into 3 equal parts would give subintervals of 0.5 each. So, the x-coordinates would be 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5. Similarly, the y-range is from 1 to 2, which is 1 unit. Dividing that into 2 equal parts gives subintervals of 0.5 each. So, the y-coordinates would be 1, 1.5, 2.

Wait, wait, no, wait: The number of subintervals is m=3 for x and n=2 for y. So, each subrectangle will have width Δx = (2.5-1)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5, and height Δy = (2-1)/2 = 1/2 = 0.5. That makes sense.

So, the rectangles are each 0.5 units wide in x and 0.5 units tall in y. The lower-left vertex of each rectangle would be the (x_i, y_j) point, where x_i is the start of the rectangle in x and y_j is the start in y.

So, let's list out all the sample points. The x-values start at 1 and go up by 0.5 each time for 3 steps. So x_0 =1, x_1=1.5, x_2=2, x_3=2.5. Similarly, y starts at 1 and goes up by 0.5 for 2 steps: y_0=1, y_1=1.5, y_2=2.

Each rectangle will have a lower-left corner at (x_i, y_j). So, for each combination of x_i and y_j, the rectangle's lower-left corner is (x_i, y_j), and the upper-right corner is (x_i+Δx, y_j+Δy). 

The Riemann sum S_{3,2} is the sum over i=0 to 2 and j=0 to 1 of f(x_i, y_j) * Δx * Δy. Because it's a double sum, each term is the function value at the sample point multiplied by the area of the rectangle (which is Δx * Δy).

So, let's list out all the (x_i, y_j) points:

For i=0 (x=1):
j=0: (1,1), j=1: (1,1.5)

i=1 (x=1.5):
j=0: (1.5,1), j=1: (1.5,1.5)

i=2 (x=2):
j=0: (2,1), j=1: (2,1.5)

So, that's 3 x 2 = 6 points.

Now, for each of these points, we calculate f(x, y) = xy.

Let me compute each term:

1. (1,1): f=1*1=1
   Multiply by Δx*Δy = 0.5*0.5=0.25
   So term is 1 * 0.25 = 0.25

2. (1,1.5): f=1*1.5=1.5
   Term: 1.5 * 0.25 = 0.375

3. (1.5,1): f=1.5*1=1.5
   Term: 1.5 * 0.25 = 0.375

4. (1.5,1.5): f=1.5*1.5=2.25
   Term: 2.25 * 0.25 = 0.5625

5. (2,1): f=2*1=2
   Term: 2 * 0.25 = 0.5

6. (2,1.5): f=2*1.5=3
   Term: 3 * 0.25 = 0.75

Now, sum all these terms:

0.25 + 0.375 = 0.625

0.625 + 0.375 = 1.0

1.0 + 0.5625 = 1.5625

1.5625 + 0.5 = 2.0625

2.0625 + 0.75 = 2.8125

So, the Riemann sum S_{3,2} is 2.8125.

Looking at the options, option F is 2.812, which is very close. So the answer should be F.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, 6 terms:

Term 1: 0.25

Term 2: 0.375 → total 0.625

Term 3: 0.375 → total 1.0

Term 4: 0.5625 → total 1.5625

Term 5: 0.5 → 2.0625

Term 6: 0.75 → total 2.8125. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct value is 2.8125, which is option F.

To calculate the Riemann Sum \( S_{3,2} \) for the integral \( \int \int_{R} xy \, dA \) over the rectangle \( R = [1, 2.5] \times [1, 2] \) with sample points as the lower-left vertices, we proceed as follows:

1. **Divide the region**:  
   - The rectangle is divided into 3 subintervals in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction.  
   - The width of each subrectangle in x is \( \Delta x = \frac{2.5 - 1}{3} = 0.5 \).  
   - The height of each subrectangle in y is \( \Delta y = \frac{2 - 1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Identify sample points**:  
   The lower-left vertices of the subrectangles are:  
   \( (1, 1), (1, 1.5), (1.5, 1), (1.5, 1.5), (2, 1), (2, 1.5) \).

3. **Evaluate the function at each sample point**:  
   Calculate \( f(x, y) = xy \) for each point:  
   - \( (1, 1): 1 \times 1 = 1 \)  
   - \( (1, 1.5): 1 \times 1.5 = 1.5 \)  
   - \( (1.5, 1): 1.5 \times 1 = 1.5 \)  
   - \( (1.5, 1.5): 1.5 \times 1.5 = 2.25 \)  
   - \( (2, 1): 2 \times 1 = 2 \)  
   - \( (2, 1.5): 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \)  

4. **Compute the Riemann sum**:  
   Each term is multiplied by \( \Delta x \times \Delta y = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).  
   Summing these terms:  
   \[
   1 \times 0.25 + 1.5 \times 0.25 + 1.5 \times 0.25 + 2.25 \times 0.25 + 2 \times 0.25 + 3 \times 0.25 = 2.8125
   \]

5. **Match the result to the options**:  
   The calculated sum \( 2.8125 \) corresponds to option **F**.

Answer: F
