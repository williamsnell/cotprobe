Okay, so I have this baseball park seating problem to solve. There are three sections: red, blue, and green. The question is asking for the total number of people who can sit there. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the red section has 200 people. That's straightforward. The blue section has 20 fewer people than the red section. Hmm, so if red is 200, subtracting 20 gives me the blue section. Let me write that down: Blue = Red - 20 = 200 - 20 = 180. So the blue section can seat 180 people.

Now, the green section seats twice as many as the blue section. Oh right, so I need to multiply the blue section's number by 2. Blue is 180, so Green = 2 * 180 = 360. Got it, the green section can hold 360 people.

So adding them all up: Red is 200, Blue is 180, Green is 360. Let me calculate the total. 200 + 180 is 380, plus 360 makes 740. Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A:700, B:500, C:380, D:900, E:740, F:1000, G:800, H:260, I:640, J:600. So option E is 740. That seems right.

Wait a second, did I add correctly? 200 + 180 is indeed 380, and 380 + 360 is 740. Yep, that adds up. So the total seating capacity is 740.

The total number of people who can sit in the baseball park is calculated by adding the capacities of all three sections. Red section has 200, blue section has 180 (200-20), and green section has 360 (2Ã—180). Adding them together: 200 + 180 + 360 = 740.

Answer: E:740
