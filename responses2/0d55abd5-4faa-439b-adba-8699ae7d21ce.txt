Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about linear models and adding more basis functions. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is about what happens when you increase the number of basis functions in a linear model. I remember that basis functions are used in things like regression, especially in models like Support Vector Machines or in neural networks, but I'm more familiar with basis functions in the context of linear models, maybe in kernel methods or feature expansion.

Wait, in linear regression, a basis function approach might involve transforming the input features into a higher-dimensional space. For example, using polynomial features, like adding squares or cubes of existing features. So if you add more basis functions, you're increasing the dimensionality of the feature space.

Now, when you increase the model's capacity by adding more basis functions, you're essentially increasing the model's complexity. In machine learning terms, a model's capacity refers to how much it can fit the training data. A higher capacity means it can fit more complex patterns but might also overfit.

In linear regression, increasing the number of basis functions increases the model's flexibility. Let's think about bias and variance. The bias is the error due to incorrect assumptions in the learning model. High bias means the model doesn't fit the data well and has a lot of error variance. Variance is the error due to sensitivity to the training data. High variance means the model is too sensitive to the training data and may overfit.

So adding more basis functions (increasing model capacity) should help reduce the bias because it makes the model fit the data better. But does it also increase variance? Or maybe not?

Wait, if you have a fixed number of training samples, adding more features (basis functions) should lead to a lower variance. Because the model is more flexible and would not overfit as much. But wait, isn't variance related to the model's sensitivity to the training data? So, adding more features might not increase variance as much as adding more data does.

Wait, another angle: the bias-variance tradeoff. The bias is about how much the model's predictions differ from the true underlying function. The variance measures how much the model's predictions change with different training sets. 

So, if you add more basis functions, you're increasing the model's capacity, which reduces the bias. Because the model can fit the data more closely. But what about variance? Adding more features might lead to a model that's more complex and could overfit if not controlled. But in this case, the question is about basis functions, which could imply a model that's more flexible.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of kernel methods. For example, in kernel regression, you're implicitly mapping the input data into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function. Adding more basis functions (like using a higher-degree polynomial kernel) would make the model fit the data better, which would reduce bias. However, the model's ability to fit the data would also depend on the number of training examples. If you have more training data, adding more features (basis functions) can help reduce variance as well.

But the question doesn't specify the number of training samples. So assuming it's about the model's capacity without changing the data size, adding more features (basis functions) would increase the model's capacity, leading to lower bias (since it's better at fitting the data) and lower variance because it's less likely to overfit.

Wait, but I thought that when you have more features, you can have a model that's more prone to variance. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: in linear regression, the bias is the error due to model assumptions. The variance is how much the model's prediction varies with different training sets. So adding more features (like in a linear model with more terms) reduces bias because it's better at fitting the data. But does it increase variance? Or does variance decrease?

Wait, the bias is about the model's error due to incorrect assumptions, like linearity. Adding more basis functions allows the model to fit more complex functions, so it reduces bias. But the variance is about overfitting. If the model has more flexibility and is more complex, it could overfit, but with more features, it might not fit as much. Wait, but if you have more features, each one adds a dimension, but perhaps the variance is lower because each feature contributes to fitting the data.

Alternatively, think of it in terms of the model's degrees of freedom. More basis functions mean higher flexibility and more degrees of freedom. This leads to lower bias and lower variance because the model can fit the data better (less bias) and doesn't vary too much across different training sets (less variance).

So, the model's bias decreases, and the model's variance also decreases. So looking at the options:

A: Decreases model bias → Correct.

E: Decreases variance → Also correct.

But wait, the options are not paired; each option is a separate choice. So the question is about which option is correct when adding more basis functions.

The options are:

A: Decreases model bias

B: Increases estimation bias

C: Doesn't affect bias and variance

D: Increases both bias and variance

E: Decreases variance

F: Decreases both bias and variance

G: Doesn’t affect estimation bias

H: Increases model bias

Wait, the options are single choices, but the question is about the effect. So, when adding more basis functions, what happens?

The effect on model bias is that it decreases because the model is better at fitting the data. 

What about variance? Let me think: if you have more basis functions, you're adding more features, but each is orthogonal or not. The variance of the model is how much it varies with different training sets. If you have more features, the model is more flexible and could overfit, but in a situation where you have enough data, adding more features might reduce variance.

Wait, no. Actually, adding more features can increase variance because each feature adds more flexibility. But wait, if you have a model that's more expressive due to more basis functions, it's possible that the model's variance decreases because it's less prone to overfitting. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of an example. Suppose you have a simple linear model (one basis function). Adding more basis functions (like adding more terms) could make the model fit the training data better but might also increase the variance because it's more prone to overfitting.

But wait, according to some sources, adding more basis functions (increasing the model's capacity) generally leads to lower bias and lower variance. Because with more basis functions, the model becomes more complex and can fit the data better, but also has more flexibility, which might lead to less overfitting. Or wait, is it the other way around?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again about bias and variance. 

Adding more basis functions increases the model's ability to fit the data, which reduces bias. Also, with more basis functions, the model is more complex, but if the training data is sufficient, it might not overfit. So variance decreases because the model is less sensitive to the training data. So both bias and variance decrease.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the effect of adding more basis functions on the model's bias and variance. So, when you have more basis functions, the model's bias decreases because it's better at fitting the data, and the model's variance decreases because it's less prone to overfitting. 

So looking at the options, A says "Decreases model bias" and E says "Decreases variance." So both A and E are correct. But each option is a single choice. Wait, no, the options are separate choices. So the question is which of the following is the correct outcome.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Decreases model bias

E: Decreases variance

But the question is about the effect when adding more basis functions. So both A and E would be correct, but the options don't allow for that. Wait, no, each option is a separate possibility. The question is asking which option is the most probable when adding more basis functions.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A and E. But looking back, the options are a list of possible answers. Let me look again. The options are labeled A to H, each a separate possibility.

Wait, but the original options are:

A: Decreases model bias

B: Increases estimation bias

C: Doesn't affect bias and variance

D: Increases both bias and variance

E: Decreases variance

F: Decreases both bias and variance

G: Doesn’t affect estimation bias

H: Increases model bias

So, the correct options are A and E. But the way the question is phrased, it's looking for the most probable option when adding more basis functions.

In the context of linear regression, when you increase the number of basis functions (like increasing the model's complexity), you're effectively increasing the model's capacity. This leads to a decrease in bias because the model can fit the data better. However, does this lead to an increase in variance? Or does it decrease?

Wait, in kernel methods, as you increase the number of basis functions (like using a higher-degree polynomial kernel), the model becomes more complex. With more features, the model is more likely to overfit if the number of training samples is fixed. So in that case, variance would increase. 

Wait, wait, this is conflicting with what I thought earlier. So some sources say that adding more basis functions (i.e., increasing the model's capacity) leads to a decrease in bias but increases variance. Or perhaps no change.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's variance decreases as the number of basis functions increases, assuming the data is sufficient.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose I have a simple linear model with one basis function. When I add another basis function, say a quadratic term, the model becomes more complex. Now, if I have a fixed dataset size, the quadratic model might fit the data better, reducing bias. But the quadratic model is more complex and might overfit the data if not enough data is present. Wait, but the question is about the model's generalization ability, not the number of data points.

Wait, the question doesn't specify the number of data points. So, in a scenario where the model has enough data, adding more features would allow it to fit the data better, reducing both bias and variance. But if the model is too complex, it could overfit, but perhaps that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that adding more basis functions decreases both bias and variance. So option F says "Decreases both bias and variance."

But in that case, E says "Decreases variance" and A says "Decreases model bias." If the model's bias decreases and variance decreases, then options A and E are correct. But the options are separate. So, the question is, what is the correct outcome.

Wait, the question is about adding more basis functions. So the model becomes more flexible, which should reduce both bias and variance. So, both A and E would be correct, but the options don't have an option that combines both.

Looking at the options again:

F: Decreases both bias and variance.

So perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that adding more basis functions reduces both. So why isn't F the correct answer?

Wait, another thought: in linear regression, the bias is the difference between the expected model output and the true function. When you add more basis functions (like more features), the model can fit the data more closely, which reduces bias. However, increasing the number of basis functions also increases the variance because the model becomes more sensitive to the training data. But wait, if the model is more complex, does that lead to higher variance?

I'm a bit in a loop. Let me think of the bias-variance tradeoff. The bias is the model's error from incorrect assumptions, like linearity. The variance is the error from sensitivity to the training data. So, increasing model capacity (more basis functions) reduces the model's bias but increases its variance. Or does it decrease both?

Wait, I think that adding more basis functions reduces the model's bias because it's better at fitting the data. But does it increase the model's variance? Or does it decrease it? Another approach: kernel methods. Adding more basis functions (like higher-degree polynomials) increases the model's flexibility. So, the model's variance decreases because it's less likely to overfit. Wait, but kernel methods can either increase model capacity and thus reduce bias and variance, or increase variance.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: think about the degrees of freedom. More basis functions mean higher degrees of freedom. More degrees of freedom can lead to lower bias and lower variance. So model's bias decreases, variance decreases.

But wait, if a model has a higher number of parameters, it's more likely to overfit, which would increase variance. So maybe adding more basis functions increases variance.

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of linear models, adding more basis functions (e.g., more features) increases model flexibility, which reduces bias but increases variance because the model becomes more prone to overfitting.

Wait, but I thought that adding more features can lead to a model that is more complex and thus less prone to overfitting. So perhaps the variance decreases.

But I'm not entirely confident here. Another angle: in neural networks, adding more hidden units (which are like basis functions) can increase the model's capacity, leading to lower bias and lower variance because the model can fit the data better, and the training data has enough examples to generalize well.

But in this question, it's about linear models, so perhaps it's different. Linear models are less flexible, so adding more basis functions might increase variance because the model becomes too complex.

Wait, maybe the answer is E: Decreases variance. Or perhaps F: Decreases both.

I think I'm getting stuck, but given the options, the most likely correct answer is that adding more basis functions decreases both bias and variance. So the correct option is F.

Alternatively, another perspective: the model's bias is reduced because it's better at fitting the data. The model's variance is reduced because it's less prone to overfitting. So both A and E are correct, but the options don't allow selecting two. So perhaps the question is about the effect on model bias and variance, and whether both decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is that bias decreases, and variance decreases. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but looking back, the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the options are A to H, and I have to pick the correct letter.

So the options are:

A: Decreases model bias

E: Decreases variance

Wait, the question is which option is correct when adding more basis functions. So, both A and E would be correct if both are true. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct overall answer is F: decreases both. Or perhaps adding more basis functions would only decrease variance, not bias.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the bias-variance tradeoff. Adding more features (basis functions) reduces bias but increases variance. Or the opposite?

I think the correct answer for linear models when adding more basis functions is that bias decreases and variance decreases. So both A and E are correct. But since the options are separate, the question might be which one is correct. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: decreases variance. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the model's degrees of freedom. More basis functions mean more degrees of freedom, which reduces both bias and variance. So the correct answer is F.

When adding more basis functions to a linear model, the effects on bias and variance depend on the context. Basis functions, such as polynomial features or kernel functions, increase the model's complexity by adding more features. This increase generally leads to a decrease in bias because the model becomes better at fitting the training data. However, it also reduces variance because the model becomes less prone to overfitting. 

In the context of linear models, increasing the number of basis functions can help the model generalize better, leading to both a reduction in bias and a decrease in variance. This is because the model becomes more flexible and less likely to fit noise in the training data. Therefore, the correct answer is that adding more basis functions decreases both bias and variance.

ANSWER: F
