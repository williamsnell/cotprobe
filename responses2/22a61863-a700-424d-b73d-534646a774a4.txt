Question:

You want to cluster 7 points into 3 clusters using the k-Means Clustering algorithm. Suppose after the first iteration, clusters C1, C2 and C3 contain the following two-dimensional points: C1 contains the 2 points: {(0,6), (6,0)} C2 contains the 3 points: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)} C3 contains the 2 points: {(5,5), (7,7)} What are the cluster centers computed for these 3 clusters?

Options:

A: C1: (3,3), C2: (6,6), C3: (12,12)

Okay, so I've got this question about k-Means clustering. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take my time.

The question says we have 7 points to cluster into 3 clusters. After the first iteration, the clusters are C1, C2, and C3. Each cluster has a certain number of points. C1 has two points: (0,6) and (6,0). C2 has three points: (2,2), (4,4), (6,6). C3 has two points: (5,5) and (7,7). 

The task is to find the cluster centers after the first iteration. The options are A to J, each listing the centers for C1, C2, and C3.

First, I remember that in k-Means, the initial cluster centers are usually set by the user, but in this case, the question doesn't specify. Wait, noâ€”the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. But the question is about the cluster centers, so I need to find the correct centers based on the given points for each cluster.

Wait, each cluster's points are provided. So for C1, its points are (0,6) and (6,0). To find the center, I think we take the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates. So for C1, the x's are 0 and 6. Average is (0+6)/2 = 3. The y's are 6 and 0. Their average is (6+0)/2 = 3. So C1's center would be (3,3).

Similarly, for C2, the points are (2,2), (4,4), (6,6). For C2's center, average x is (2+4+6)/3 = (12)/3 =4. Average y is also (2+4+6)/3=4. So (4,4) is the center.

C3 has points (5,5) and (7,7). Average x is (5+7)/2=6, average y same. So center is (6,6).

Now, looking at the options, let's see what each option lists as centers.

Option A: C1: (3,3), C2: (6,6), C3: (12,12). Wait, C3's center is (12,12), but from our calculation, it's (6,6). So A is wrong.

Option B: C1: (6,6), C2: (12,12), C3: (12,12). C1 is (6,6), which is our calculated. C2 and C3 would have to be (12,12) but our centers are (4,4) and (6,6). So B is wrong.

Option C: C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6). That's exactly what we calculated. So C is a candidate.

Option D: C1: (1,1), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6). C1's center is (1,1), which doesn't match our calculation. So D is out.

Option E: C1: (0,0), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6). C1's center doesn't match. Also, C2's center is (4,4), which is not the average of 2,4,6 (which is 4). So E is wrong.

Option F: C1: (6,0), C2: (4,4), C3: (7,7). C1 is (6,0), which is one of the points, but the center is (3,3) which is the average. So F is wrong.

Option G: C1: (3,3), C2: (2,2), C3: (7,7). C2's center would be (2,2), which is one of the points, but our calculation for C2 is (4,4). So G is wrong.

Option H: C1: (2,2), C2: (5,5), C3: (7,7). C1 is (2,2), which is one of the points but the center would be the average of (0,6) and (6,0), so (3,3). So H is wrong.

Option I: C1: (0,0), C2: (48,48), C3: (35,35). Both C2 and C3 centers are way off from our calculation. So I is wrong.

Option J: C1: (0,6), C2: (2,2), C3: (5,5). C1's center is (0,6) but our calculation is (3,3). So J is wrong.

So the only correct option is C, which lists centers at (3,3), (4,4), (6,6).

To determine the cluster centers for the given clusters after the first iteration, we calculate the average coordinates of the points in each cluster.

- **Cluster C1**: Contains points (0,6) and (6,0). The average x-coordinate is (0 + 6)/2 = 3, and the average y-coordinate is (6 + 0)/2 = 3. Thus, the center is (3,3).
- **Cluster C2**: Contains points (2,2), (4,4), and (6,6). The average x-coordinate is (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4, and the average y-coordinate is (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4. Thus, the center is (4,4).
- **Cluster C3**: Contains points (5,5) and (7,7). The average x-coordinate is (5 + 7)/2 = 6, and the average y-coordinate is (5 + 7)/2 = 6. Thus, the center is (6,6).

Comparing these calculated centers with the options provided, the correct choice is **C: C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)**.
