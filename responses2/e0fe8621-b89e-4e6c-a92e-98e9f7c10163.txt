Okay, so I've got this question about Laplace transforms and improper integrals. Hmm, let's think through it step by step. The question is asking about the integral G(s) which is the improper integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) dt. And I need to determine for which values of s this integral converges and then find the Laplace transform of f(t) = 1.

Wait, I remember that Laplace transforms for functions like f(t) = 1 are pretty standard. The Laplace transform of 1 is usually given as 1/s, but I need to be careful about the convergence conditions because that's what determines if the transform exists.

So, what does G(s) look like? It's the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-s t) dt. Let's compute that. The integral of e^(-s t) with respect to t is (-1/s) e^(-s t). Evaluated from 0 to infinity.

Wait, let me write that out. The integral is:

G(s) = lim (t→∞) [ (-1/s) e^(-s t) - (-1/s) e^(0) ]

Which simplifies to:

G(s) = lim (t→∞) [ (-1/s) e^(-s t) + 1/s ]

Now, the term (-1/s) e^(-s t) as t approaches infinity depends on the value of s. Let's consider the limit as t approaches infinity.

If Re(s) > 0, then e^(-s t) approaches 0 because s t becomes a large positive number, and e to a large negative number is zero. So the first term goes to zero.

If Re(s) = 0, then s is purely imaginary, say s = iω. Then e^(-s t) = e^(-iω t) which oscillates and doesn't approach zero. So the limit doesn't exist in this case.

If Re(s) < 0, then e^(-s t) grows without bound because s t is a large negative number, making e^(s t) go to infinity. So the term (-1/s) e^(-s t) goes to negative infinity (since s is negative, the denominator would be negative, but multiplied by the e^(-s t) which is growing, so I think it's actually going to negative infinity, but since we have a negative sign in front, it's positive infinity. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, if Re(s) < 0, then s = -|s|. So e^(-s t) = e^(|s| t), which grows exponentially. So (-1/s) e^(-s t) becomes (-1/(-|s|)) e^{|s| t} = (1 / |s|) e^{|s| t}, which goes to infinity. So the limit is infinity. So in this case, the integral diverges.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck. The integral G(s) is from 0 to infinity of e^(-s t) dt. The antiderivative is (-1/s) e^(-s t).

So evaluating from 0 to infinity:

lim (t→∞) [ (-1/s) e^(-s t) ) - (-1/s) e^(0) ]

Which is lim (t→∞) [ (-e^(-s t)/s) + 1/s ]

So if Re(s) < 0, then e^(-s t) = e^{|s| t} because s is negative. So e^{|s| t} goes to infinity, so (-e^(-s t)/s) becomes (-infinite)/s. But s is negative, so s = -|s|.

Wait, let me take s as a complex number. Let's say s is a real number for simplicity. If Re(s) < 0, then s is negative. So e^(-s t) = e^{|s| t} which is growing exponentially. So the term (-1/s) e^(-s t) would be (-1/s) * e^{|s| t}, which is (-1/s) times a positive number growing to infinity. Since s is negative, 1/s is negative, so (-1/s) would be positive. So (-1/s) * e^{|s| t} would be positive, and times e^{|s|t} grows to infinity. So the whole expression approaches infinity. So the limit is infinity. So the integral diverges for Re(s) < 0.

Wait, but wait: let me double-check. If s is real and negative, like s = -a, a>0, then e^(-s t) = e^{a t}, which grows without bound as t approaches infinity. So the integral becomes:

lim (t→∞) [ (-1/(-a)) e^{a t} + 1/(-a) ) ]

Which is lim [ (1/a) e^{a t} - 1/a ]

As t approaches infinity, e^{a t} goes to infinity, so the first term goes to infinity, so the integral diverges.

If s is real and positive, then e^(-s t) decays to zero. So the integral becomes:

lim (t→∞) [ (-1/s) e^{-s t} + 1/s ] = (0 + 1/s) = 1/s.

So G(s) converges when Re(s) > 0 and diverges otherwise.

Now, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 1 is L{f} = 1/s, provided Re(s) > 0.

So looking at the options:

Option B: G(s) converges for all s.

Wait, no. Because if Re(s) ≤ 0, it diverges. So B is incorrect.

Option C: G(s) converges to (1/s) for Re{s} > 0 and diverges otherwise. The required Laplace transform is L{1} = (1/s) for Re{s} > 0.

Wait, but the Laplace transform is 1/s, which is correct when Re(s) > 0. So option C says exactly that.

Option D says G(s) converges for Re{s} = 0. But we saw that when Re(s) = 0, the integral diverges because e^{0 t} is 1, so it's 1/s times something that doesn't approach zero. Oh wait, no. Wait, when Re(s) = 0, s is purely imaginary, so s = iω. Wait, no, wait: when Re(s) = 0, s is a purely imaginary number, so for example s = iω. Then e^{-s t} = e^{-iω t} which is oscillatory and doesn't converge. So the integral from 0 to infinity of e^{-iω t} dt would oscillate between positive and negative infinity, so it doesn't converge. Therefore, G(s) diverges when Re(s) = 0.

So option C is correct.

Looking at the other options, option E says convergence for Re{s} < 0. But we saw that when Re(s) < 0, the integral diverges because e^{s t} grows. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Converges to 2/s. Wait, I thought Laplace of 1 is 1/s. So F is wrong.

Option G: Laplace is 1/s², which is the transform of t. So G is incorrect.

Option I: Converges for s=0. But s=0 is not allowed because we saw that when s=0, the integral becomes ∫0^infty 1 dt, which is obviously divergent. So I is wrong.

Option H: Converges to (s/2) for Re{s} >1. Hmm, that's not right because the Laplace transform is 1/s. So H is incorrect.

Option J: Laplace is s for Re{s} > 0. Wait, no. The Laplace transform is 1/s. So J is wrong.

Wait, but looking back, option C says "G(s) converges to (1/s) for Re{s} > 0 and diverges otherwise." The required Laplace transform is L{1} = 1/s. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the values of \( s \) for which the improper integral \( G(s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} \, dt \) converges and to find the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \), we analyze the integral and its conditions.

The integral is:
\[
G(s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} \, dt
\]
The antiderivative of \( e^{-st} \) with respect to \( t \) is:
\[
\int e^{-st} \, dt = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st}
\]
Evaluating from 0 to \( \infty \):
\[
G(s) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left[ -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} + \frac{1}{s} \right]
\]

### Convergence Analysis:
1. **If \( \text{Re}(s) > 0 \):**
   - \( e^{-st} \to 0 \) as \( t \to \infty \) because \( st \) becomes large and positive.
   - The integral converges to \( \frac{1}{s} \).

2. **If \( \text{Re}(s) = 0 \):**
   - \( s \) is purely imaginary, say \( s = i\omega \).
   - \( e^{-st} = e^{\omega t} \), which grows without bound as \( t \to \infty \).
   - The integral diverges.

3. **If \( \text{Re}(s) < 0 \):**
   - \( s \) is negative, so \( e^{-st} = e^{-\omega t} \) grows exponentially as \( t \to \infty \).
   - The integral diverges.

Thus, \( G(s) \) converges if and only if \( \text{Re}(s) > 0 \), and the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \) is \( \frac{1}{s} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not diverge for all \( s \); it only converges for \( \text{Re}(s) > 0 \).
- **Option B:** Incorrect. \( G(s) \) converges only for \( \text{Re}(s) > 0 \), not all \( s \).
- **Option C:** Correct. \( G(s) \) converges to \( \frac{1}{s} \) for \( \text{Re}(s) > 0 \), which is the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \).
- **Option D:** Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge for \( \text{Re}(s) = 0 \).
- **Option E:** Incorrect. \( G(s) \) diverges for \( \text{Re}(s) < 0 \).
- **Option F:** Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge to \( \frac{2}{s} \).
- **Option G:** Incorrect. The Laplace transform is \( \frac{1}{s} \), not \( \frac{1}{s^2} \).
- **Option H:** Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge to \( \frac{s}{2} \).
- **Option I:** Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge for \( s = 0 \).
- **Option J:** Incorrect. The Laplace transform is \( \frac{1}{s} \), not \( s \).
