Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again. It says: We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times. What's the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls? The options are A through J, each with different fractions.

Hmm, okay. So, at most 2 sixes in 5 rolls. That means 0, 1, or 2 sixes. I think I remember that this is a binomial probability problem. The formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success.

In this case, n is 5 because we roll the die 5 times. p is 1/6 since each roll has a 1/6 chance of rolling a six. We need the probability for k=0, k=1, and k=2. Then sum those probabilities.

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, for k=0: That's rolling no sixes. So, P(0) = C(5,0)*(1/6)^0*(5/6)^5. C(5,0) is 1 because there's only one way to choose nothing. (1/6)^0 is 1. So P(0) = 1 * 1 * (5/6)^5.

What's (5/6)^5? Let me compute that. 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. Raising that to the 5th power: 0.8333^5. Let me compute it step by step. 0.8333^2 is about 0.6944. Then 0.6944 * 0.8333 is about 0.5837. Multiply by another 0.8333: ~0.5837 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.4866. Multiply by another 0.8333: ~0.4866 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.4084. So (5/6)^5 is approximately 0.4019.

Wait, maybe I should get a more accurate value. Let me calculate 5^5 is 3125 and 6^5 is 7776. So 3125/7776 is exactly that. So (5/6)^5 is 3125/7776. That's about 0.4019 when converted to decimal. So P(0) is 3125/7776.

Next, k=1: P(1) = C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4.

C(5,1) is 5. (1/6)^1 is 1/6. (5/6)^4 is 5^4 /6^4. 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So (5/6)^4 is 625/1296.

So P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296). Let's compute that. 5 * (1/6) is 5/6. Then multiply by 625/1296: (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296) = 3125 / 7776. Wait, that's the same as P(0), which can't be right because 0,1,2 should sum to less than 1. But looking at the options, some have 25/648, which is larger. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Wait, 3125/7776 is about 0.4019, but the options have 25/648, which is approximately 0.039.

Wait, let me recheck. Because 3125 divided by 7776 is roughly 0.4019. But when I sum that for k=0, k=1, and k=2, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: Maybe it's better to compute each term accurately.

Wait, let's compute each term step by step.

P(0) = (5/6)^5. 5^5 is 3125, 6^5 is 7776. So 3125/7776 ≈ 0.4019.

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 is 625/1296. Multiplying by 5/6: 5 *625 = 3125, denominator 6*1296=7776. So P(1)=3125/7776 ≈0.4019.

P(2) = C(5,2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3.

C(5,2) is 10. (1/6)^2 is 1/36. (5/6)^3 is 125/216.

So P(2)=10*(1/36)*(125/216).

Let me compute 10*(1/36) = 10/36 = 5/18. Then multiply by 125/216: (5/18)*(125/216) = (5*125)/(18*216) = 625/(3888). Wait, 18*216 is 3888.

So P(2)=625/3888 ≈0.1608.

Wait, but 625 divided by 3888 is approximately 0.1608.

Now, let's sum all three probabilities. So P(0) + P(1) + P(2) = 3125/7776 + 3125/7776 + 625/3888.

Wait, but 3888 is 7776 divided by 2, because 7776 /2 = 3888. So 625/3888 = (625*2)/(7776) = 1250/7776.

So adding up:

3125 + 3125 + 1250 = 7500. So total is 7500/7776.

Simplify that fraction. Let's see if it divides. 7500 and 7776, both divisible by 12. 7500 ÷12=625; 7776 ÷12=648. So 625/648.

Wait, but let me check: 625 * (7776/7500). Alternatively, 7500 divided by 7776. Let me compute 7500/7776.

Wait, 7500 ÷ 36 is 208.333, and 7776 ÷36 is 216. So 208.333/216 = approx 0.96296. Wait, but I think I made a miscalculation here. Wait, wait, 7500/7776 is equal to 7500 ÷7776. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, let's see if 625/648 simplifies. 625 is 5^4, and 648 is 81*8= (9*9)*8= 72*9. Wait, 625=5^4, 648= 2^3 * 3^4. So no common factors. So 625/648 is the simplified fraction.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option G is 2/648, which simplifies to 1/324. That's much smaller than 625/648. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculations. Maybe I messed up the P(2) term. Let me recalculate P(2).

P(2) = C(5,2)*(1/6)^2*(5/6)^3.

C(5,2) is 10. (1/6)^2 is 1/36. (5/6)^3 is 125/216.

So 10*(1/36) = 10/36 = 5/18.

Multiply by 125/216: (5/18)*(125/216) = (5*125)/(18*216) = 625 / (3888).

But 3888 is 7776/2. So 625/3888 = (625 * 2)/7776 = 1250/7776.

Now, P(0) is 3125/7776, P(1)=3125/7776, P(2)=1250/7776.

Adding them together: 3125 + 3125 + 1250 = 7500.

So 7500/7776.

Simplify this fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12: 7500 ÷12=625; 7776 ÷12=648. So 625/648.

Wait, but 625/648 is approximately 0.96296. But looking at the options, none of them seem to match this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 25/648

B:1000/648

C:625/648

D:5/648

E:1/6

F:300/648

G:2/648

H:1/648

I:200/648

J:125/648

Wait, option C is 625/648. So that's one of the options. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 625/648 is about 0.96296, which seems high for getting at most 2 sixes in 5 rolls. Because getting 0,1, or 2 sixes probably isn't that high.

Wait, but wait, let me check if I added correctly. 3125 (P0) + 3125 (P1) = 6250. Add 1250 (P2) → 7500. 7500/7776 = 625/648. So the correct answer should be 625/648, which is option C.

But wait, why did I think it was 25/648 at first? Because I must have confused it with a different problem. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps when I calculated P(2), I made an error. Let me compute each step again.

P(2) = C(5,2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3.

C(5,2) is 10.

(1/6)^2 is 1/36.

(5/6)^3 is 125/216.

So 10 * (1/36) = 10/36 = 5/18.

Multiply by 125/216: 5/18 * 125/216 = (5 * 125) / (18 * 216) = 625 / 3888.

Wait, but 3888 is 3888. Let me see, 3888 divided by 7776 is 0.5, right? Because 3888*2=7776. So 625/3888 = (625 * 2)/(7776) )= 1250/7776.

So adding all three probabilities:

P0 = 3125/7776,

P1 = 3125/7776,

P2 = 1250/7776.

Total = 3125 + 3125 + 1250 = 7500 → 7500/7776.

Simplify: 7500 ÷ 12 = 625, 7776 ÷12=648. So 625/648. So the correct answer is C: 625/648.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 625/648, which matches. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the probability of rolling a 6 in at most 2 of 5 rolls, we use the binomial probability formula:

\[ P(k) = C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where \( n = 5 \), \( p = \frac{1}{6} \), and \( k \) can be 0, 1, or 2.

1. **For \( k = 0 \):**
   \[ P(0) = C(5,0) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{3125}{7776} = \frac{3125}{7776} \]

2. **For \( k = 1 \):**
   \[ P(1) = C(5,1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^1 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{625}{1296} = \frac{3125}{7776} \]

3. **For \( k = 2 \):**
   \[ P(2) = C(5,2) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \frac{125}{216} = \frac{625}{3888} = \frac{1250}{7776} \]

Summing these probabilities:
\[ P(\text{at most 2 sixes}) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) = \frac{3125}{7776} + \frac{3125}{7776} + \frac{1250}{7776} = \frac{7500}{7776} = \frac{625}{648} \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
