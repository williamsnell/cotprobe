Okay, so I have this triangle problem to solve. The question says that the longest side is 10, and I need to figure out which of the options can't be the lengths of the other two sides. Hmm, I remember something about the triangle inequality theorem. Let me think.

The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for any three sides a, b, c, the following must all be true: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a.

In this case, the longest side is 10. Let's denote the other two sides as x and y. So, x and y are the lengths of the other two sides, and they have to satisfy certain conditions with 10.

Wait, but wait. Because the triangle's longest side is 10, that means both x and y must be less than 10, right? Because if either of them was equal to or longer than 10, then 10 wouldn't be the longest side anymore. So, both x and y must be less than 10.

But that's not all. Because the sum of x and y must be greater than 10, or else the side of length 10 wouldn't be the longest. Wait, no, wait: the sum of the two shorter sides must be greater than the longest side. Because in a triangle, the longest side must be less than the sum of the other two. So, x + y > 10. 

So, let's look at each option:

Option A: 5 and 5. So, x=5, y=5. The sum is 10, which is not greater than 10. So, 5 +5 =10, which means 10 is not greater than 10. So, that can't be the case. Because if x and y are 5 and 5, then 5+5=10, which is equal to the longest side. So, that doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality. So, option A would not form a valid triangle because the sum is equal, not greater. Therefore, perhaps option A is the answer.

Option B: 9 and 8. Sum is 17, which is greater than 10. Also, each side is less than 10. So, this should be a valid triangle. So, B can be a possibility.

Option C: 3 and 9. The sum is 12, which is greater than 10. Both sides are less than 10. So, valid. So, C is okay.

Option D:6 and5. Sum is 11, which is greater than 10. Both are less than 10. So, valid. D is okay.

Option E:4 and7. Sum is 11, which is greater than 10. Both less than 10. So, valid. E is okay.

So, the only option that doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality is option A.

The correct answer is **A** because 5 + 5 = 10, which does not satisfy the triangle inequality (needs to be greater than 10). Thus, it cannot form a valid triangle.

Answer: A
