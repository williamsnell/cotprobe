Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which factor is associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Being African or Hispanic American. I recall that Hispanic individuals, especially, have a higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease. So this one is probably not the correct answer.

Option B: A lower level of education. Lower education might mean you're less likely to be exposed to certain risk factors because maybe you don't have the knowledge needed. But wait, does lower education directly decrease the risk? Or is it the other way around? I think higher education might lead to better access to information, so maybe lower education increases risk. Hmm, not sure. Maybe not the best choice.

Option C: Living in a city. Cities are more densely populated, which might mean more exposure to environmental factors. But I'm not sure how that affects Alzheimer's risk. I think city living might lead to more stress or living in crowded areas, but I don't remember if that's a direct factor. Maybe it's not the best answer either.

Option D: Being married. I don't think being married would decrease your risk. In fact, it might make you more susceptible because of the lifestyle factors like higher consumption of red meat or alcohol. So probably not the correct answer.

Option E: Having a family history of Alzheimer's. Oh wait, that's exactly what the question is about. If you already have it, your risk is lower. So this is a good candidate.

Option F: High intake of saturated fats. Saturated fats are linked to various chronic diseases, including heart disease and Alzheimer's. So more saturated fats might increase the risk, not decrease it. So this is probably not the answer.

Option G: Older age. I remember that older adults are generally at higher risk for Alzheimer's. So older age would increase the risk, not decrease it.

Option H: Eating fish. Fish is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are protective against Alzheimer's. So eating fish might lower the risk. But is this a common factor? I'm not entirely sure, but it's a possibility.

Option I: Being a smoker. Smokers are at higher risk for many diseases, including Alzheimer's. So a higher likelihood of smoking would increase the risk, not decrease it.

Option J: Drinking alcohol regularly. alcohol is a big risk factor for Alzheimer's. Higher alcohol intake would increase the chance of developing it. So this is not the correct answer.

So the options that are associated with a decreased risk are E and H. But wait, the question is asking which factor is associated with decreased risk. So which one is correct?

Wait, the options are about factors that are associated with decreased risk. So the correct answer would be E and H. But the question is giving us a single correct answer. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is which factor is associated with decreased risk. So, E is a family history (lower risk) and H is about diet (lower risk). So both E and H are correct factors. But the options given are A to J, each as a separate option, so perhaps the question is looking for one correct answer.

Looking back, the options are listed, so the factors are independent. The question is asking which is associated with decreased risk. So among the options, E and H are both correct. But let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are:

E: Having a family history of Alzheimer's. So this is a lower risk factor because if you have it, you're less likely to get it.

H: Eating fish. So if you eat fish, you might have lower risk. So both E and H are correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each of which is a separate factor. The question is asking which factor is associated. So both E and H are factors that are linked to lower risk. But looking at the options, which of these is one of the factors.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor associated with decreased risk. So the answer is either E or H. But the options given are separate. So the correct answers for decreased risk would be E and H.

Wait, but I'm supposed to choose one of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: African or Hispanic
B: education level
C: city living
D: married
E: family history
F: saturated fats
G: older age
H: fish
I: smoking
J: alcohol.

So the factors that are linked to decreased risk would be E and H. But the question is asking which option is associated. So, both E and H are correct. But the options are single-choice.

Wait, perhaps one of them is incorrect. Let me think again.

E: family history is a known risk factor, so yes, lower risk.

H: Eating fish is a known dietary factor, so yes, lower risk.

So both E and H are correct, but in the options, the question asks which is associated. The options are each a single factor, so the correct answers would be E and H. However, the options are all presented as single options, so perhaps the correct answer is E and H. But looking at the choices, I think the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the options are given as separate, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but another approach: if I think about the factors, which are known to decrease the risk. Family history (E) and diet (H) are definitely linked. So E is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps H is not a correct factor. Wait, I thought fish is a good source, but maybe there are other considerations. Or perhaps the question is looking for H as a correct factor.

Wait, the answer options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct. So the question is which of the options is a factor associated with decreased risk. So both E and H are correct, but perhaps the options are designed to have only one correct answer, so the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because family history is a known factor. As for H, I think the answer is H is not a correct factor for decreased risk. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: I remember that family history is a strong indicator of a lower risk. So E is correct.

As for H, I think eating fish is a factor but maybe it's not a primary factor. Or perhaps the question is about the factors, and the correct answers are both E and H. But the options are presented as separate, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I should look up some data. No, I can't look up data. So based on my knowledge: family history lowers the risk. Eating fish is a dietary factor, which also contributes. So both E and H are correct. But the question is asking which of the following is associated with a decreased risk. So both E and H are factors, but the options are singular.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and H. But the options don't have a combined choice. So perhaps E is the best answer.

Wait, another thought: The question is about factors. So both E and H are factors that decrease the risk. But the options are separate, so perhaps the question expects E as the answer.

The question asks which factor is associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A: Being African or Hispanic American**: This is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's, so it is associated with increased risk, not decreased.

- **B: A lower level of education**: Lower education might expose individuals to less information or risk factors, potentially lowering the risk. However, it’s not a definitive or widely accepted factor.

- **C: Living in a city**: While living in a city may involve more exposure to environmental factors, it is not a direct or strong factor linked to decreased risk.

- **D: Being married**: Being married increases lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption and increased exposure to smoking, which are associated with higher risk.

- **E: Having a family history of Alzheimer's**: This is a well-known factor that directly decreases the risk, as it indicates a higher baseline of Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.

- **F: High intake of saturated fats**: Saturated fats are linked to chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's, so this increases the risk, not decreases it.

- **G: Older age**: Older age is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's, increasing the likelihood of disease.

- **H: Eating fish**: Fish is a nutrient-dense food that supports brain health and is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's.

- **I: Being a smoker**: Smoking is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's, increasing the likelihood of disease.

- **J: Drinking alcohol regularly**: Alcohol is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's, increasing the risk.

Between the factors, **E (family history)** and **H (eating fish)** are both associated with decreased risk. However, the question asks for a single factor, and **E** is a well-established and widely recognized factor linked to lower Alzheimer's risk.

ANSWER: E
