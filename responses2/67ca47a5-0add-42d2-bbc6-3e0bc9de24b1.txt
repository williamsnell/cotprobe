Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the minimal polynomial of a given matrix A and then evaluate it at 99. Hmm, let's see. The matrix is 4x4, so that's a bit large, but I remember that the minimal polynomial is the smallest degree monic polynomial that the matrix satisfies, right? So I need to find the minimal polynomial f(x) such that f(A) = 0.

First, I think I should find the characteristic polynomial of A. The characteristic polynomial is given by det(A - λI), where I is the identity matrix and λ is an eigenvalue. Once I have that, maybe I can factor it or find its roots to determine the minimal polynomial.

So, let's start by writing down matrix A minus λ times the identity matrix. 

Matrix A:
[
[-2, -1, -1, -1],
[2, 1, 3, 2],
[1, 1, 0, 1],
[-1, -1, -2, -2]
]

So, A - λI would be:

[[-2-λ, -1, -1, -1],
 [2, 1-λ, 3, 2],
 [1, 1, 0-λ, 1],
 [-1, -1, -2, -2-λ]]

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. Calculating a 4x4 determinant manually sounds a bit tedious, but I'll try expanding along the first row.

The determinant of a 4x4 matrix is calculated by expanding along a row or column. I'll expand along the first row.

The determinant is:

(-2 - λ) * det(minor11) 
- (-1) * det(minor12)
+ (-1) * det(minor13)
- (-1) * det(minor14)

Wait, minor11 is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1. Let me write that out.

minor11:
[
[1-λ, 3, 2],
[1, 0-λ, 1],
[-1, -2, -2-λ]
]

Similarly, minor12 is the matrix with row 1 and column 2 removed:

[
[2, 3, 2],
[1, 0-λ, 1],
[-1, -2, -2-λ]
]

And so on for the other minors.

This seems a bit involved, but let me try calculating each minor step by step.

First, minor11 determinant:
The matrix is:
[1-λ, 3, 2]
[1, -λ, 1]
[-1, -2, -2-λ]

I'll compute its determinant using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let's do cofactor expansion along the first row.

= (1-λ) * det( [ -λ, 1; -2, -2-λ ] ) 
- 3 * det( [1, 1; -1, -2-λ] ) 
+ 2 * det( [1, -λ; -1, -2] )

Compute each:

First minor:
det( [ -λ, 1; -2, -2-λ ]) = (-λ)(-2 - λ) - (1)(-2) 
= 2λ + λ^2 + 2 
= λ^2 + 2λ +2

Second minor:
det( [1, 1; -1, -2-λ] ) = (1)(-2-λ) - (1)(-1)
= -2 - λ +1 
= (-λ -1)

Third minor:
det( [1, -λ; -1, -2] ) = (1)(-2) - (-λ)(-1)
= -2 - λ

Now putting it all together for minor11 determinant:

= (1-λ)(λ² + 2λ + 2) - 3*(-λ -1) + 2*(-2 - λ)
= (1-λ)(λ² + 2λ +2) + 3λ +3 -4 -2λ
= (1-λ)(λ² + 2λ +2) + (λ -1)

Now, expanding (1-λ)(λ² +2λ +2):

= 1*(λ² +2λ +2) - λ*(λ² +2λ +2)
= λ² +2λ +2 - λ^3 - 2λ^2 -2λ 
= -λ^3 - λ² + 0λ +2

So, adding the other terms:

-λ^3 - λ² +2 + λ -1 
= -λ^3 -λ² + λ +1

So, minor11 determinant is (-λ^3 - λ^2 + λ +1).

Now, moving to minor12:

Minor12:
[
[2,3,2],
[1, -λ,1],
[-1,-2,-2-λ]
]

Again, compute the determinant.

Expanding along the first row:

2 * det( [ -λ, 1; -2, -2-λ ] ) 
- 3 * det( [1,1; -1, -2-λ] )
+ 2 * det( [1, -λ; -1, -2] )

Compute each minor:

First minor:
det( [ -λ,1; -2, -2-λ ]) = (-λ)(-2-λ) - (1)(-2)
= 2λ + λ^2 +2 
= λ² +2λ +2

Second minor:
det( [1,1; -1, -2-λ] ) = (1)(-2-λ) - (1)(-1)
= -2 -λ +1 
= -λ -1

Third minor:
det( [1, -λ; -1, -2] ) = (1)(-2) - (-λ)(-1)
= -2 - λ 

Putting together:

= 2*(λ² +2λ +2) -3*(-λ-1) +2*(-2 - λ)
= 2λ² +4λ +4 +3λ +3 -4 -2λ 
= 2λ² + (4λ +3λ -2λ) + (4+3-4)
= 2λ² +5λ +3 

Wait, let me compute again step by step.

First term: 2*(λ² +2λ +2) = 2λ² +4λ +4

Second term: -3*(-λ -1) = 3λ +3

Third term: 2*(-2 - λ) = -4 -2λ

Adding all together:

2λ² +4λ +4 +3λ +3 -4 -2λ 
= 2λ² + (4λ +3λ -2λ) → 5λ 
+ (4 +3 -4) → 3 

So, minor12 determinant is 2λ² +5λ +3.

Next, minor13:

Minor13 is the matrix with row 1 and column 3 removed:

[
[2, 1, 2],
[1, 0, 1],
[-1, -2, -2-λ]
]

Determinant: 

= 2 * det( [0,1; -2, -2-λ] ) 
- 1 * det( [1,1; -1, -2-λ] ) 
+ 2 * det( [1, 0; -1, -2] )

Compute each minor:

First minor: det( [0,1; -2, -2-λ] ) = 0*(-2-λ) -1*(-2) = 0 +2 = 2.

Second minor: det( [1,1; -1, -2-λ] ) = 1*(-2-λ) -1*(-1) = -2-λ +1 = -λ -1

Third minor: det( [1,0; -1, -2] ) = 1*(-2) -0*(-1) = -2 -0 = -2.

Putting it all together:

= 2*2 -1*(-λ-1) +2*(-2)
=4 +λ +1 -4
= (4+1-4) +λ → 1 +λ.

So minor13 determinant is λ +1.

Now, minor14:

Minor14 is the matrix with row 1 and column 4 removed:

[
[2, 1, 3],
[1, 1, 0],
[-1, -1, -2]
]

Determinant:

= 2 * det( [1,0; -1, -2] ) 
-1 * det( [1,0; -1, -2] ) 
+3 * det( [1,1; -1, -1] )

Wait, maybe I should use the standard expansion. Let me write the matrix:

[
[2, 1, 3],
[1, 1, 0],
[-1, -1, -2]
]

So, expanding along the first row:

2 * det( [1,0; -1, -2] ) 
-1 * det( [1,0; -1, -2] ) 
+3 * det( [1,1; -1,-1] )

Wait, no, the cofactor expansion is:

det = a11*C11 + a12*C12 + a13*C13

Where Cij is the cofactor, which is (-1)^(i+j) * Mij, where Mij is the minor.

So for a11, it's (+) the minor, for a12, (-) minor, etc.

So, minor14 is the matrix with row 1 and column 4 removed:

[
[1, 1, 0],
[-1, -1, -2]
]

So, the minor is:

[
[1,1,0],
[-1,-1,-2]
]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant directly.

Compute det of minor14:

= 1 * det( [-1, -2; -1, -2] ) 
- 1 * det( [ -1, -2; -1, -2 ] ) 
+0 * det( [ -1, -1; -1, -1 ] )

Wait, perhaps that's not the best approach. Let me compute it directly.

The determinant is 1*( (1*(-2) - 0*(-1) ) ) - 1*( (1*(-2) - 0*(-1) ) ) + 0*( ... )

Wait, no, the better way: expanding the 3x3 matrix:

det = 
1*(1*(-2) -0*(-1)) 
-1*(1*(-2) -0*(-1)) 
+0*(1*(-1) -1*(-1)) 

Wait, that's not right. Let's use the first row:

For a 3x3 matrix:

[
a b c
d e f
g h i
]

det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)

So, for our minor14:

a=1, b=1, c=0
d=-1, e=-1, f=-2
g=-1, h=-1, i=-2

So,

det = 1*( (-1)(-2) - (-2)(-1) ) 
-1*( (-1)(-2) - (-2)(-1) ) 
+0*( ... )

Simplify:

= 1*(2 - 2) 
-1*(2 -2)
+0*... 

= 1*(0) -1*(0) +0 
= 0 -0 +0 = 0.

So, minor14 determinant is 0.

Putting it all together for the first row of the cofactor expansion:

= (-2 - λ) * ( -λ^3 - λ² + λ +1 ) 
+ (1) * (2λ² +5λ +3) 
- (1) * (λ +1) 
+ (-1) * (0)

So, that's:

= (-2 - λ)(-λ^3 - λ^2 + λ +1) + (2λ² +5λ +3) - (λ +1)

Let me expand the first term:

(-2 - λ)(-λ^3 -λ² +λ +1) 

Multiply term by term:

= (-2)(-λ^3) + (-2)(-λ²) + (-2)(λ) + (-2)(1)
+ (-λ)(-λ^3) + (-λ)(-λ²) + (-λ)(λ) + (-λ)(1)
= 2λ^3 + 2λ² - 2λ -2 
+ λ^4 + λ^3 - λ² - λ 

So, combining all terms:

2λ^3 +2λ² -2λ -2 + λ^4 +λ^3 -λ² -λ 

Combine like terms:

λ^4 + (2λ^3 + λ^3) → 3λ^3 
+ (2λ² - λ²) → λ² 
- (2λ + λ) → -3λ 
-2 

So, the first part is: λ^4 +3λ^3 +λ² -3λ -2.

Now, adding the other terms: (2λ² +5λ +3) - (λ +1) 

= 2λ² +5λ +3 -λ -1 
= 2λ² + (5λ - λ) → 4λ + (3-1) → 2λ² +4λ +2.

Wait, no, because the expansion from the other terms is just adding (2λ² +5λ +3) and subtracting (λ +1), which is the same as adding (2λ² +5λ +3 - λ -1) = 2λ² +4λ +2.

So total determinant is:

λ^4 +3λ^3 +λ² -3λ -2 
+ 2λ² +4λ +2 
= λ^4 +3λ^3 + (λ² +2λ²) → 3λ^3 
+ (-3λ +4λ) → λ 
+ (-2 +2) → 0.

So determinant is λ^4 +3λ^3 +3λ^2 +λ.

Hmm, is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, the first expansion was:

(-2 -λ)(-λ^3 -λ² +λ +1) → which gave λ^4 +3λ^3 +λ² -3λ -2.

Then adding (2λ² +5λ +3) - (λ +1) → 2λ² +4λ +2.

Adding all together:

( λ^4 +3λ^3 +λ² -3λ -2 ) + (2λ² +4λ +2) 
= λ^4 +3λ^3 + (λ² + 2λ²) → 3λ^3 
+ (-3λ +4λ) → λ 
+ (-2 + 2) → 0.

So, the determinant is λ^4 +3λ^3 +3λ^2 +λ.

Wait, but I can factor this perhaps. Let's factor:

λ^4 +3λ^3 +3λ^2 +λ = λ (λ^3 +3λ^2 +3λ +1 )

Hmm, λ^3 +3λ^2 +3λ +1. Let me see if this factors. Maybe (λ +1)^3.

(λ+1)^3 = λ^3 +3λ^2 +3λ +1. Yes! So, the determinant is λ (λ+1)^3.

So, the characteristic polynomial is det(A - λI) = λ (λ +1)^3.

Wait, but wait, the determinant is the product of eigenvalues, so for a 4x4 matrix, the characteristic polynomial is λ^4 +3λ^3 +3λ^2 +λ, which factors as λ (λ^3 +3λ^2 +3λ +1 ) = λ (λ+1)^3. So that's correct.

Now, the minimal polynomial f(x) must divide the characteristic polynomial, and it's the smallest degree polynomial such that f(A) =0.

The characteristic polynomial has roots at 0 (with multiplicity 1) and -1 (with multiplicity 3).

So, possible minimal polynomials could be (x)(x+1)^k, where k is the multiplicity. But let me think.

Since the minimal polynomial is the product of (x - eigenvalues) raised to the power of their geometric multiplicities. Wait, but in this case, for each eigenvalue, the algebraic multiplicity is equal to the geometric multiplicity if the minimal polynomial is the same as the characteristic polynomial.

Wait, but in this case, the matrix might have a geometric multiplicity less than the algebraic multiplicity, so the minimal polynomial might be of lower degree.

Wait, in our case, for λ =0, the algebraic multiplicity is 1. So, the minimal polynomial for λ=0 would be (x - 0)=x, because for a single eigenvalue, the minimal polynomial is x.

For λ=-1, the algebraic multiplicity is 3. So, to find the minimal polynomial for this, we need to see if the matrix is diagonalizable. If so, the minimal polynomial is (x+1)^3. But otherwise, it could be lower.

Wait, but if the minimal polynomial is x(x+1)^3, then the characteristic polynomial would have higher degree. So, maybe the minimal polynomial is (x)(x+1)^k, where k is the size of the Jordan block for λ=-1.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's compute A^2 and see if it's a multiple of A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to compute A^2 to see if it's a multiple of A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the minimal polynomial by checking whether (A + I) is invertible, (A + I)^2, etc.

Wait, let's try. Compute (A + I) and see if it's invertible.

A + I is:

[
[-2+1, -1, -1],
[2,1+1,3],
[1,1,0+1]
]
= [
[-1, -1, -1],
[2, 2, 3],
[1, 1, 1]
]

So, matrix B = A + I is:

[
[-1, -1, -1],
[2, 2, 3],
[1, 1, 1]
]

Now, compute determinant of B.

I can compute this determinant using expansion. Let's expand along the first row.

det(B) = (-1) * det( [2,3; 1,1] ) 
- (-1) * det( [2,3; 1,1] ) 
+ (-1) * det( [2,2; 1,1] )

Wait, no, for each element:

= (-1) * det( [2,3; 1,1] ) 
- (-1) * det( [2,3; 1,1] ) 
+ (-1) * det( [2,2; 1,1] )

Wait, perhaps I should compute each minor properly.

Wait, the matrix is 3x3, so the determinant is:

= (-1) * [ (2)(1) - (3)(1) ) ] 
- (-1) * [ (2)(1) - (3)(1) ) ] 
+ (-1) * [ (2)(1) - (2)(1) ) ]

Compute each term:

First minor: [2,3;1,1] → 2*1 -3*1= 2-3=-1.

Second minor: same as first → -1.

Third minor: [2,2;1,1] → 2*1 -2*1=0.

So, putting together:

= (-1)*(-1) - (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(0)
= 1 -1 +0 
= 0.

So, determinant is zero. So, that means (A+I) is not invertible, so the minimal polynomial might have a factor of (x+1). Now, let's check whether (A+I)^2 is zero.

Compute (A+I)^2 = (B)^2.

First, compute B squared.

But since B is a 3x3 matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute it step by step.

But this might take a while, but let's try.

Compute B:

B = [
[-1, -1, -1],
[2, 2, 3],
[1, 1, 1]
]

So, B squared is:

B^2 = B * B.

Compute each element of the resulting matrix.

The resulting matrix will be 3x3.

Let me compute each element:

Row 1:

Column 1: (-1)*(first row of B's first column) + (-1)*(second row of B's first column) + (-1)*(third row of B's first column).

Wait, no, the correct way is:

Each element (i,j) in the resulting matrix is the dot product of row i of the first matrix and column j of the second matrix.

So, for 3x3, each (i,j) is summing over k=1 to 3 of B[i,k] * B[k,j].

Let's compute each element step by step.

Element (1,1):

= (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(2) + (-1)*(1)
= 1 -2 -1 = -2.

Element (1,2):

= (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(2) + (-1)*(1)
= 1 -2 -1 = -2.

Wait, no, wait, let me compute each correctly.

Wait, actually, for element (1,2), it's the sum of B[1][1]*B[1][2] + B[1][2]*B[2][2] + B[1][3]*B[3][2].

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the correct way is each element (i,j) is summing over k=1 to 3 of B[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, for (1,2):

= B[1][1]*B[1][2] + B[1][2]*B[2][2] + B[1][3]*B[3][2]

= (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(2) + (-1)*(1)
= 1 -2 -1 = -2.

Element (1,3):

= B[1][1]*B[1][3] + B[1][2]*B[2][3] + B[1][3]*B[3][3]

= (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(3) + (-1)*(1)
= 1 -3 -1 = -3.

Now, element (2,1):

= B[2][1]*B[1][1] + B[2][2]*B[2][1] + B[2][3]*B[3][1]

= 2*(-1) + 2*(2) + 3*(1)
= -2 +4 +3 =5.

Element (2,2):

= B[2][1]*B[1][2] + B[2][2]*B[2][2] + B[2][3]*B[3][2]

=2*(-1) +2*(2) +3*(1)
= -2 +4 +3 =5.

Element (2,3):

= B[2][1]*B[1][3] + B[2][2]*B[2][3] + B[2][3]*B[3][3]

=2*(-1) +2*(3) +3*(1)
= -2 +6 +3 =7.

Element (3,1):

= B[3][1]*B[1][1] + B[3][2]*B[2][1] + B[3][3]*B[3][1]

=1*(-1) +1*(2) +1*(1)
= -1 +2 +1 =2.

Element (3,2):

= B[3][1]*B[1][2] + B[3][2]*B[2][2] + B[3][3]*B[3][2]

=1*(-1) +1*(2) +1*(1)
= -1 +2 +1 =2.

Element (3,3):

= B[3][1]*B[1][3] + B[3][2]*B[2][3] + B[3][3]*B[3][3]

=1*(-1) +1*(3) +1*(1)
= -1 +3 +1 =3.

So, B squared is:

[
[-2, -2, -3],
[5,5,7],
[2,2,3]
]

Now, compute B^3 = B^2 * B.

Let me compute each element again.

Element (1,1):

= (-2)*(-1) + (-2)*(2) + (-3)*(1)
= 2 -4 -3 =-5.

Element (1,2):

= (-2)*(-1) + (-2)*(2) + (-3)*(1)
= 2 -4 -3 =-5.

Element (1,3):

= (-2)*(-1) + (-2)*(3) + (-3)*(1)
= 2 -6 -3 =-7.

Element (2,1):

=5*(-1) +5*(2) +7*(1)
= -5 +10 +7=12.

Element (2,2):

=5*(-1) +5*(2) +7*(1)
= -5 +10 +7=12.

Element (2,3):

=5*(-1) +5*(3) +7*(1)
= -5 +15 +7=17.

Element (3,1):

=2*(-1) +2*(2) +3*(1)
= -2 +4 +3=5.

Element (3,2):

=2*(-1) +2*(2) +3*(1)
= -2 +4 +3=5.

Element (3,3):

=2*(-1) +2*(3) +3*(1)
= -2 +6 +3=7.

So, B^3 is:

[
[-5, -5, -7],
[12,12,17],
[5,5,7]
]

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere, but let's proceed.

Wait, but the minimal polynomial is the smallest degree such that (A + I) is a multiple of the minimal polynomial, but I'm not sure. Perhaps a better approach is to compute the minimal polynomial of A directly.

Wait, but given that the matrix A is 4x4, perhaps the minimal polynomial can be found by considering the possible options.

Wait, another approach is to check if A^2 can be expressed in terms of A. If so, then the minimal polynomial would have lower degree.

Wait, but from earlier calculations, A + I is a 3x3 matrix whose determinant is zero, so (A + I) is singular. So, (A + I)^2 is not necessarily zero, but let's compute (A + I)^2.

Wait, I already computed (A + I)^2 as B^2, and it's a 3x3 matrix.

But perhaps I should compute A^2 and see if it's a multiple of A, which would imply that A satisfies the equation A^2 = kA, which would make the minimal polynomial (x^2 -k x). But in that case, the minimal polynomial would be degree 2. Alternatively, if A^2 is a multiple of A, but in our case, for λ=-1, the minimal polynomial might be x+1.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the case. So, let's think again.

The characteristic polynomial is x (x+1)^3.

The possible minimal polynomials could be x (x+1)^1, or x (x+1)^2, or x (x+1)^3.

But since the characteristic polynomial is x (x+1)^3, the minimal polynomial must divide it.

To find the minimal polynomial, we can check if (A) satisfies (x) or (x+1). If (A) satisfies (x), then the minimal polynomial is x. But if not, then we need to check higher multiplicities.

Wait, but given that the minimal polynomial is the polynomial of least degree that annihilates A, let's try to see if A satisfies (x) or (x+1).

If A satisfies (x), then it has eigenvalue 0, which is already present. But perhaps in this case, the minimal polynomial is x, but that would only be the case if the matrix is nilpotent, which it's not, because it has eigenvalue -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial is x (x+1), meaning that the matrix satisfies A^2 + A =0.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial is x (x+1)^2, so that the matrix satisfies A^2 + A =0, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute A^2 and see if it's a multiple of A.

Compute A^2.

A is:

[
[-2, -1, -1],
[2, 1, 3],
[1, 1, 0]
]

So, A^2 would be A multiplied by A.

Let me compute each element.

Element (1,1):

= (-2)*(-2) + (-1)*2 + (-1)*1
=4 -2 -1=1.

Element (1,2):

= (-2)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1
=2 -1 -1=0.

Element (1,3):

= (-2)*(-1) + (-1)*3 + (-1)*0
=2 -3 +0= -1.

Element (2,1):

=2*(-2) +1*2 +3*1
= -4 +2 +3=1.

Element (2,2):

=2*(-1) +1*1 +3*1
= -2 +1 +3=2.

Element (2,3):

=2*(-1) +1*3 +3*0
= -2 +3 +0=1.

Element (3,1):

=1*(-2) +1*2 +0*1
= -2 +2 +0=0.

Element (3,2):

=1*(-1) +1*1 +0*1
= -1 +1 +0=0.

Element (3,3):

=1*(-1) +1*3 +0*0
= -1 +3 +0=2.

So, A^2 is:

[
[1,0,-1],
[1,2,1],
[0,0,2]
]

Now, let's see if A^2 can be expressed as a multiple of A plus a multiple of the identity matrix.

Let me assume that A^2 = c A + d I.

We can try to find c and d such that this holds.

But in our case, for each element, we can set up equations.

But let's take the first row:

A^2 [1,0,-1] = c A [1,0,0] + d I [1,0,0].

Wait, but A is a 3x3 matrix, so perhaps this approach isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can try to compute the minimal polynomial from the A matrix.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed by checking if (A + I) is invertible. But earlier, we saw that (A + I) has determinant zero, so it's not invertible. So, perhaps the minimal polynomial is (A + I)^2.

Wait, but then I would compute A^2 + A, which is a multiple of A, but let's see.

Wait, if I compute A^2 + A, what do I get?

Compute each element:

(1,1): 1 + (-2) = -1

(1,2): 0 + (-1) = -1

(1,3): -1 + (-1) = -2

(2,1): 1 + 2 = 3

(2,2): 2 +1=3

(2,3):1 +3=4

(3,1):0 +1=1

(3,2):0 +1=1

(3,3):2 +0=2.

So, A^2 + A is:

[
[-1,-1,-2],
[3,3,4],
[1,1,2]
]

Hmm, that doesn't seem to be a multiple of A, so perhaps A^2 + A is not equal to c A + d I.

So, perhaps (A + I) is not a multiple of A, but then we have to find the minimal polynomial.

Wait, but maybe I can compute the minimal polynomial by using the matrix A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to compute the minimal polynomial by using the fact that the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial and check for each possible factor.

The possible factors are: x, x+1, x(x+1), x(x+1)^2, x(x+1)^3.

We can compute the minimal polynomial by checking if A^k = 0 for some k.

Wait, but if the minimal polynomial is x, then A=0, which is not the case. So, the minimal polynomial cannot be x.

If the minimal polynomial is x+1, then (A + I) must be nilpotent, meaning that (A + I)^k = 0 for some k.

But earlier, we saw that (A + I) has determinant zero, so it's singular. So, let's check if (A + I)^2 is zero.

Compute (A + I)^2 = B^2, which we calculated earlier as:

[
[-2, -2, -3],
[5,5,7],
[2,2,3]
]

Which is not zero. So, (A + I)^2 is not zero, so minimal polynomial is not x+1.

Next, let's check if (A + I)^3 is zero.

Compute B^3 = B^2 * B.

Earlier, B^3 was:

[
[-5, -5, -7],
[12,12,17],
[5,5,7]
]

Which is also not zero. So, (A + I)^3 is not zero, so minimal polynomial is not x+1.

Thus, the minimal polynomial must be of higher degree.

Now, perhaps the minimal polynomial is x(x+1)^2.

Let me see: If A(x) =x(x+1)^2, then A^2 = (x(x+1)^2)^2 =x^2(x+1)^4.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (A + I)^2 = B^2, and check whether (A + I)^2 is a multiple of (A + I).

Wait, if (A + I)^2 = c (A + I) + d I, then perhaps we can find c and d such that this holds for each element.

Let me try to find such c and d.

So, we can set up equations based on each element.

For example:

From (1,1): -2 = c*1 + d*1 + 0.

From (1,2): -2 = c*0 + d*1 +0.

From (1,3): -3 = c*(-1) +d*0 +0.

Similarly, for other elements.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to set up equations for each element.

Let me denote:

A^2 = c A + d I.

So, let's write each element:

Element (1,1):

1 = c*(-2) + d*1.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated, so maybe I should try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (A + I)^2 and see if it's a multiple of (A + I).

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, (A + I)^2 is:

[
[-2, -2, -3],
[5,5,7],
[2,2,3]
]

Which is a 3x3 matrix. Let me see if this is a multiple of (A + I).

Suppose that (A + I)^2 = k (A + I), where k is a scalar.

But (A + I) is a 3x3 matrix, and (A + I)^2 is also a 3x3 matrix, so k must be a scalar such that each element of (A + I)^2 is k times the corresponding element of (A + I).

But let's check:

Element (1,1) of (A + I)^2 is -2, and of (A + I) is -2. So, k would be 1 here.

Element (1,2) of (A + I)^2 is -2, and of (A + I) is -2: so k=1.

Element (1,3) of (A + I)^2 is -3, and of (A + I) is -3: so k=1.

Similarly, Element (2,1): 5 =k*2 → k=2.5.

But earlier, k was 1, which is a contradiction. So, (A + I)^2 is not a multiple of (A + I), which suggests that (A + I) is not nilpotent, so minimal polynomial is not x+1.

Hmm, perhaps the minimal polynomial is x(x+1)^3. But that's the same as the characteristic polynomial, which would imply that the matrix is nilpotent, which it's not. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial is x(x+1)^2, meaning that (A + I)^2 is a multiple of (A + I).

But as we saw, that's not the case because (A + I)^2 is not a multiple of (A + I).

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the minimal polynomial of A by finding the smallest k such that A^k is a scalar matrix.

Wait, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the minimal polynomial by finding the minimal degree polynomial that A satisfies, which would be either degree 1, 2, or 3.

Since we've already established that the minimal polynomial isn't x or x+1, it's either x(x+1) or x(x+1)^2, etc.

Wait, perhaps the minimal polynomial is x(x+1)^2, meaning that (A + I)^2 is a multiple of (A + I).

But in our earlier calculation, (A + I)^2 is not a multiple of (A + I), so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial is x(x+1)^3, but that's again the same as the characteristic polynomial, implying that the matrix is nilpotent, which it's not.

Hmm, this is getting a bit frustrating. Maybe I should try to compute the minimal polynomial step by step.

First, let's find the minimal polynomial of A. Since the minimal polynomial must divide the characteristic polynomial, which is x(x+1)^3, the possible minimal polynomials are x, x+1, x(x+1), x(x+1)^2, x(x+1)^3.

We've already ruled out x and x+1.

Now, let's check if x(x+1)^2 is the minimal polynomial.

To check, we can see if (A + I)^2 is a multiple of (A + I).

But as we saw earlier, (A + I)^2 is not a multiple of (A + I), so that's not the case. Therefore, x(x+1)^3 is not the minimal polynomial.

Next, let's check if x(x+1)^2 is the minimal polynomial.

To do that, we can check if (A + I)^2 is a multiple of (A + I). But as we saw, it's not, so x(x+1)^2 is not the minimal polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the minimal polynomial by finding the smallest k such that A^k is a scalar matrix.

But in our case, A is not a scalar matrix, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal polynomial using the fact that the minimal polynomial is the product of the minimal polynomials of each Jordan block.

But in our case, the Jordan blocks are each of size 1, except for the block corresponding to λ=-1, which has size 3. So, the minimal polynomial would be x(x+1)^3, which is the same as the characteristic polynomial. So, that suggests that the matrix is nilpotent, which it's not, so that can't be.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the characteristic polynomial.

Wait, let me recheck that.

Compute the determinant of A:

A is:

[
[-2, -1, -1],
[2, 1, 3],
[1, 1, 0]
]

So, the determinant is:

(-2) * (1*0 - 3*1) - (-1) * (2*0 - 3*1) + (-1) * (2*1 - 1*1)

Calculating each term:

First term: (-2) * (0 - 3) = (-2)*(-3) =6

Second term: -(-1) * (0 - (-3)) =1*(3)=3

Third term: (-1) * (2 -1 )= (-1)(1)= -1

Adding up: 6 +3 -1=8.

Wait, so I made a mistake earlier in calculating the determinant. The determinant is 8, not 2.

So, the characteristic polynomial is det(x) =x^3 -8.

Wait, but that's different from what I thought before.

So, the characteristic polynomial is x^3 -8.

Now, the possible minimal polynomials are divisors of x^3 -8.

Which factors are possible?

Well, x^3 -8 can factor into linear and/or cubic factors.

But let's see, x^3 -8 can be factored as (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x +4), because 2^3=8.

So, x^3 -8 = (x -2)(x^2 +2x +4).

So, the possible minimal polynomials could be:

1) x -2,

2) x^2 +2x +4,

3) (x -2)(x^2 +2x +4) =x^3 -8,

4) x^2 +2x +4,

5) x -2,

6) x^3 -8.

Wait, but x^3 -8 is a cubic, so the minimal polynomial could be of degree 1, 2, or 3.

Wait, but let me think again. Since the matrix A has eigenvalues 2 and the roots of x^2 +2x +4, which are complex, the minimal polynomial can't have repeated roots, because the matrix is diagonalizable only if the minimal polynomial has distinct roots.

But in this case, the matrix isn't diagonalizable because it has complex eigenvalues.

Wait, but in any case, the minimal polynomial would be the product of the minimal polynomials of each Jordan block.

But in our case, each Jordan block is 1x1, except for the block corresponding to λ=-1, which has size 3.

But wait, no, for λ=2, the size is 1, and for λ=-1, the size is 3, so the minimal polynomial would be (x -2)(x^2 +2x +4). So, x^3 -8.

Wait, but that can't be, because the determinant is 8, so the characteristic polynomial is x^3 -8, and the minimal polynomial is the same as the characteristic polynomial.

Wait, but if the minimal polynomial is x^3 -8, then the matrix is not diagonalizable, but it's certainly diagonalizable over the complex numbers, which is fine.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, we thought the determinant was 2, which was incorrect, but with the corrected determinant of 8, the minimal polynomial is x^3 -8.

Wait, but then, the minimal polynomial is of degree 3.

Hmm, but let's think about the matrix A again.

A is:

[
[-2, -1, -1],
[2, 1, 3],
[1, 1, 0]
]

We can compute the trace, which is the sum of the diagonal elements: -2 +1 +0= -1.

The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, so the sum of the eigenvalues is -1.

But the eigenvalues for A are 2 and the roots of x^2 +2x +4.

Wait, so sum of roots of x^2 +2x +4 is -2, so 2 + (-2) =0, but the trace is -1, which is a contradiction. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, no, wait. The sum of roots of x^2 +2x +4 is -2 (from quadratic formula: -b/a = -2/1=-2). So, sum of eigenvalues is 2 + (-2) =0, but the trace is -1, which is a contradiction. So, something's wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the determinant.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant of A correctly.

Compute determinant of A:

A is:

Row 1: -2, -1, -1

Row 2: 2, 1, 3

Row 3:1,1,0

Compute determinant:

= -2*(1*0 -3*1) - (-1)*(2*0 -3*1) + (-1)*(2*1 -1*1)

= -2*(-3) - (-1)*(-3) + (-1)*(1)

= 6 -3 -1 =2.

Wait, so the determinant is 2, so the characteristic polynomial is x^3 -2.

Wait, so earlier calculation was wrong. So, determinant is 2, so characteristic polynomial is x^3 -2.

So, the possible minimal polynomials are the divisors of x^3 -2.

Which factors are possible?

Well, x^3 -2 factors into (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x +4). So, it's a product of a linear term and an irreducible quadratic term.

So, the minimal polynomial could be:

Either (x -2), (x^2 +2x +4), or (x^3 -2).

But in our case, the matrix has eigenvalues 2 and the roots of x^2 +2x +4, so the minimal polynomial must have both factors, so it must be (x -2)(x^2 +2x +4)=x^3 -2.

Wait, but that's the same as the characteristic polynomial. So, that suggests that the matrix is diagonalizable, but since the minimal polynomial is the same as the characteristic polynomial, which is degree 3, that suggests that the matrix is not diagonalizable, but it's still diagonalizable over complex numbers.

Wait, but in any case, the minimal polynomial is x^3 -2, which is the same as the characteristic polynomial, so the matrix is not diagonalizable.

But perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of the determinant, but now it's clear that the determinant is 2, so the characteristic polynomial is x^3 -2.

So, the possible minimal polynomials are (x -2), (x^2 +2x +4), and (x^3 -2).

Now, let's check whether (x -2) is the minimal polynomial.

To check, we can see if (A -2I) is the zero matrix.

Compute A -2I:

A is:

Row 1: -2, -1, -1

Row 2: 2, 1, 3

Row 3:1,1,0

Minus 2I:

Row 1: -2, -1, -1

Row 2: 2, 1, 3

Row 3:1,1,-2

So, A -2I is:

Row 1: -2, -1, -1

Row 2: 2, 1, 3

Row 3:1,1,-2

Is this the zero matrix? No, so (A -2I) is not zero, so (x -2) is not the minimal polynomial.

Next, check if (x^2 +2x +4) is the minimal polynomial.

To check, we can compute (A^2 +2A +4I) and see if it's zero.

Alternatively, since the minimal polynomial divides x^3 -2, and we've already ruled out x-2 and x^3 -2, the minimal polynomial is x^2 +2x +4.

So, let's compute (A^2 +2A +4I) and see if it's zero.

First, compute A^2:

A is:

Row 1: -2, -1, -1

Row 2: 2, 1, 3

Row 3:1,1,0

Compute A^2:

Row 1:

(-2)*(-2) + (-1)*2 + (-1)*1 =4 -2 -1=1

(-2)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1=2 -1 -1=0

(-2)*(-1) + (-1)*3 + (-1)*0=2 -3 +0=-1

Row 2:

2*(-2) +1*2 +3*1= -4 +2 +3=1

2*(-1) +1*1 +3*1= -2 +1 +3=2

2*(-1) +1*3 +0*0= -2 +3 +0=1

Row 3:

1*(-2) +1*2 +0*1= -2 +2 +0=0

1*(-1) +1*1 +0*1= -1 +1 +0=0

1*(-1) +1*3 +0*0= -1 +3 +0=2

So, A^2 is:

Row 1:1,0,-1

Row 2:1,2,1

Row 3:0,0,2

Now, compute 2A:

Row 1:2*(-2)= -4, 2*(-1)= -2, 2*(-1)= -2

Row 2:2*2=4, 2*1=2, 2*3=6

Row 3:2*1=2, 2*1=2, 2*0=0

So, 2A is:

Row 1:-4,-2,-2

Row 2:4,2,6

Row 3:2,2,0

Compute 4I:

Row 1:4,0,0

Row 2:0,0,0

Row 3:0,0,4

Now, add A^2 +2A +4I:

Compute each element:

Element (1,1):

A^2:1, 2A:-4, 4I:4

Sum:1 -4 +4=1

Element (1,2):

A^2:0, 2A:-2, 4I:0

Sum:0 -2 +0= -2

Element (1,3):

A^2:-1, 2A:-2, 4I:0

Sum:-1 -2 +0=-3

Element (2,1):

A^2:1, 2A:4, 4I:0

Sum:1 +4 +0=3

Element (2,2):

A^2:2, 2A:2, 4I:0

Sum:2 +2 +0=4

Element (2,3):

A^2:1, 2A:6, 4I:0

Sum:1 +6 +0=6

Element (3,1):

A^2:0, 2A:2, 4I:0

Sum:0 +2 +0=2

Element (3,2):

A^2:0, 2A:2, 4I:0

Sum:0 +2 +0=2

Element (3,3):

A^2:2, 2A:0, 4I:4

Sum:2 +0 +4=6

So, A^2 +2A +4I is:

Row 1:1, -2, -3

Row 2:3, 4,6

Row 3:2,2,6

Which is not the zero matrix, so (A^2 +2A +4I) ≠0, so (x^2 +2x +4) is not the minimal polynomial.

Thus, the minimal polynomial must be x^3 -2, which is the same as the characteristic polynomial.

So, the minimal polynomial is x^3 -2.

Wait, but let me check whether the minimal polynomial is indeed x^3 -2.

So, to check, we can see if (A - cI) is invertible for any c, but perhaps the minimal polynomial is x^3 -2.

Wait, but in any case, since the minimal polynomial is x^3 -2, which is the same as the characteristic polynomial, the matrix is not diagonalizable, but is diagonalizable over the complex numbers.

But regardless, the minimal polynomial is x^3 -2.

So, to answer the original question: the minimal polynomial is x^3 -2, which is option C.

So, the answer is C.
</think>

The minimal polynomial of the matrix \( A \) is \( x^3 - 2 \).

**Answer:** C
