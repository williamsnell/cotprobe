Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem. Let me read it again. Lucy is counting by 2s, starting at 2 and stopping at 50. The question is asking which number she wouldn't count. The options are A to I, with numbers like 24, 4, 22, 2, 11, 38, 50, 48, 34, and 48 again.

Hmm, counting by 2s means she's listing every even number, right? So she starts at 2, then 4, 6, 8, and so on up to 50. So the numbers she counts are all even numbers between 2 and 50 inclusive.

Now, I need to find which of the options isn't an even number. Wait, some options are even and some are odd. Let me check each option:

A:24 – even.
B:4 – even.
C:22 – even.
D:2 – even.
E:11 – odd. Oh, that's a problem.
F:38 – even.
G:50 – even.
H:48 – even.
I:34 – even.

So the only odd number in the options is E, which is 11. So Lucy wouldn't count 11 because she's only counting even numbers by 2s.

The correct answer is E:11.
