Question:

A 7-year-old student arrived in the United States one year ago from a non-Englishspeaking country, where she achieved high scores in reading. Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?

Options:

A:  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.
B: The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is due to the different teaching methodologies in her previous and current schools.
C: The student's high scores in reading in her native language are misleading her actual reading capacity in English.
D: The student's reading difficulty is due to her inability to adjust to the new learning environment.
E: The student's difficulty in reading is due to lack of exposure to English literature.
F: The student's reading skills are being hindered due to her proficiency in speaking and listening.
G: The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.
H: The student's reading difficulty is due to lack of interest in the subject matter in the basal reader.
I: The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.
J: Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a 7-year-old student from a non-English speaking country who just returned to the US. She's pretty good at reading in her native language and has recently learned fluent social English. Her teacher evaluated her because she's having trouble with the basal reader, which I think is the kind of book students use to learn vocabulary and reading skills.

So, looking at the evaluation results, she does better in speaking and listening tests compared to the peers in English, both in monolingual kids and those in her native language. But she's way below the mean in reading, both in English and in her native language.

Hmm, so why is that? The options suggest different explanations. Let's break it down.

Option A says the discrepancy is because the complex English makes reading harder. But the student is good at reading in her native language, so maybe that's not it. Also, she's fluent in social English, which might be helping.

Option B suggests the teaching methods are different. But the teacher has already referred her because of reading difficulties. So maybe the issue is different, not the teaching methods.

Option C claims her native language reading skills are misleading. That could be true because maybe the language is harder, but the student does well in her native. She's good with her native, so maybe the problem isn't with her reading in her native. So this option might be wrong.

Option D says her reading difficulty is due to not adjusting to the new learning environment. That could be a possibility, but I'm not sure. The student is fluent in social English, which might indicate she's comfortable with that.

Option E suggests she's not exposed to English literature. That's a possibility, but why would that cause reading difficulties? Maybe she's not used to reading complex texts.

Option F says her reading skills are hindered by speaking and listening. That's a possibility because speaking and listening are important for reading, especially with basal readers which often require comprehension.

Option G says the discrepancy is expected because social skills are richer. That makes sense. In school, students learn to read through basal texts, which often require understanding spoken words and sentences. So if she's learning social skills, that might make reading harder.

Option H suggests her interest in the subject matters affects reading. But she's good in her native, so maybe that's not her issue.

Option I suggests early reading difficulties could lead to academic problems. That's a possibility, but the student is doing well in speaking and listening, which are important for reading.

Option J says the student is using her native language in her home, interfering with English. That's a concern, but I'm not sure how that would affect her reading.

So, putting it together, the student's reading difficulties are probably because she's learning social English, which might make reading more challenging. So the most accurate answer would be option G, which states that the discrepancy is expected due to the richer context of social skills.

Wait, but option F also suggests reading is hindered because of speaking and listening. So which is more accurate?

The student's strengths in her native language might suggest that the issue is different, but perhaps the lack of exposure to English literature or the way basal readers are structured might make it worse. So option G seems plausible.

Looking again, the student's high scores in reading in her native language are above the peers, but in English, she's below. That suggests that her reading in her native language is better, but the English reading is worse. So the problem might be that in English, the basal reader is harder to grasp because of the language itself or the context.

So options B and F are about the teaching methods or language. Option G is about the context, which seems more likely.

So the answer should be G.

The discrepancy in the student's reading skills between her native language and English is most likely due to the richer context of learning English, which includes exposure to more complex texts and varied vocabulary. 

Answer: G
