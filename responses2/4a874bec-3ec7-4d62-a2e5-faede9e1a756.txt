Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a flywheel and angular acceleration. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

So the question says the flywheel is a uniform disk with a diameter of 4.0 ft. Oh wait, diameter, so the radius is half that, which is 2 ft. The weight is 600 lb. Wait, weight isn't mass, right? Oh wait, weight is mass times gravity. So I'll need to find the moment of inertia, which depends on mass and radius.

The formula they gave us is I = (1/2) m R². But wait, I need to find the mass, right? Because the weight is 600 lb, and weight equals mass times gravity. Oh wait, but wait, the units here might be a bit tricky. Because in the formula, I is mass in slugs or kg, but in English units, it's different.

Wait, I think the weight is given in pounds. Weight W is mass m multiplied by gravity g, which is 32 ft/s²? Since in the US, g is about 32 ft/s². Oh wait, no, actually, in the English system, the unit of weight is pounds, which is mass times gravity. So 1 pound is approximately 1 lb·ft/s²? Wait, no—wait, I think that's the unit for force, which is mass times acceleration. So for weight, W = m * g, where g is 32 ft/s². Because in the English system, g is approximately 32 ft/s².

So the weight is 600 lb. So, m (mass) would be weight divided by g. So m = 600 lb / (32 ft/s²) = 18.75 lb·s²/ft. Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. Because in the formula for I, it's (1/2) m R². So m needs to be in slugs because I is in slug·ft².

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck with units. Let me think again. Maybe I should work in pounds and feet, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the angular acceleration without worrying about units as long as I use correct formulas.

Wait, another approach: angular acceleration α is given by torque τ divided by moment of inertia I. So α = τ / I. The torque is given as 225 lb-ft. So I need to find I, which is (1/2) m R².

Wait, but I need the mass. The weight is 600 lb, which is m * g. So m = weight / g. But wait, in the English system, g is about 32 ft/s². So m = 600 lb / 32 ft/s² = 600 /32 = 18.75 lb·s²/ft. Wait, but that's not correct because the units are a bit tricky. Let me think: in the English system, mass in slugs is mass in pounds divided by g. So m is 600 / 32 = 18.75 slugs. Because I think the formula is m = W / g. Oh wait, wait—right! So W is in pounds, which is m * g. So m = W / g. So m is 600 lb / (32 ft/s²) = 18.75 lb·s²/ft. But wait, no, because when you solve m = W / g, W is in pounds (which is force), and g is in ft/s². So m is in slugs. So 600 / 32 is 18.75 slugs.

Wait no, no. Let me think again. Because the formula for weight is W = m * g. So m is mass, and W is weight. So m = W / g. So 600 lb / 32 ft/s² = 18.75 lb·s²/ft. Wait, but that's not right because when you divide pounds by (feet per second squared), the units become mass. Oh wait, no, 600 lb is force, not mass. So perhaps I should convert the weight to mass in slugs.

Wait, another way. Let me think in terms of units without worrying too much. So m = W / (g), but with correct units. Let me think in terms of the units for moment of inertia: I = (1/2) m R². So, R is 2 ft. So I = (1/2) * m * (2 ft)^2 = 2 m (ft²). So I must be in slug·ft².

So let me get back. The moment of inertia is I = (1/2) m R². So m is in slugs.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units. Let me proceed step by step.

First, mass m: W is 600 lb, which is force. Since W = m * g, m = W / g. But wait, g is 32 ft/s². So m = 600 /32 = 18.75 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, but 1 slug is equal to 32.174 lb·s²/ft. Hmm, so 18.75 lb·s²/ft / 32.174 lb·s²/ft per slug = 0.582 slug. So m = 0.582 slug.

Wait, but that's perhaps complicating things. Another approach: perhaps simply treat the calculation algebraically, dealing with the units as if they cancel out.

So, I = (1/2) * m * R^2. I need to find I in slug·ft².

So m is in slugs, R is in feet.

So, let me compute I.

m is 600 lb / (32 ft/s²) = 18.75 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, but 1 slug is equal to 32.174 lb·s²/ft. Hmm, but perhaps the units are getting in the way. Let's just compute I in terms of lb·ft².

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of unit conversions. Let's see: 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So, if m is in slugs, then m = (W / g) / (32.174 lb·s²/ft per slug). Because 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate I in terms of lb·ft².

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

So R is 2 ft. So R squared is 4 ft².

Now, I = (1/2) * m * (2 ft)^2 = (1/2) * m * 4 ft² = 2 m ft².

So I is 2 * m (in slug) * ft².

But m is 600 lb / 32 ft/s².

Wait, so m = 600 /32 = 18.75 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, but 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So 18.75 lb·s²/ft = (18.75 / 32.174) slug.

So I = 2 * (18.75 / 32.174) slug * ft².

Calculating that:

First, 18.75 /32.174 ≈ 0.582 slug.

So I ≈ 2 * 0.582 slug·ft² = 1.164 slug·ft².

Wait, or perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should compute I in terms of the units of lb·ft².

Wait, let's proceed more carefully. Let me not get stuck on units, but compute the moment of inertia numerically.

So, m = 600 lb / 32 ft/s² = 18.75 lb·s²/ft.

R = 2 ft.

So I = (1/2) * m * R².

So I = (0.5) * (18.75 lb·s²/ft) * (4 ft²).

Compute that: 0.5 * 18.75 *4 = 0.5 *75 = 37.5 lb·ft².

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about the units. When I multiply lb·s²/ft by ft², the ft² cancels out, leaving lb·s².

But in the formula for torque, τ = I * α, units of torque are lb-ft. So, if I is in kg·m², and α is in rad/s², then the units would be (kg·m²) * (rad/s²) ), which is (kg·m²/s²) ), which is equivalent to N·m (since N·m = kg·m²/s²). So, in this problem, the units are consistent.

So, I is 37.5 lb·ft²? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, calculation:

I = 0.5 * (18.75 lb s²/ft ) * (4 ft²) = 0.5 * 18.75 *4 = 0.5 *75 = 37.5 lb·s²/ft * ft²? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the units of m are lb/s², R is ft, so R squared is ft². So when you multiply m (lb/s²) by R² (ft²), you get (lb/s²) * (ft²) = lb·ft²/s².

But for moment of inertia, I should have units of mass times distance squared. Wait, no: in the formula I = (1/2) m R², m is mass (slugs), R is distance (ft). So I's units would be (slug * ft²). But a slug is 32.174 lb·s²/ft, so I would have units of (32.174 lb·s²/ft) * ft² = 32.174 lb·ft·s². Hmm, that's a bit messy, but I think that's correct.

But perhaps in this problem, the units are handled in a way that I can just compute the numerical values without worrying about units, as long as the units cancel properly.

So, I think I can proceed with the calculation numerically.

So I = 0.5 * m * R².

m is 18.75 lb·s²/ft.

R is 2 ft, so R² is 4 ft².

So I = 0.5 * 18.75 *4 = 0.5 *75 = 37.5 lb·ft².

Wait, but isn't moment of inertia in units of mass times distance squared? Oh wait, no, I think that in the formula I = (1/2) m R², the units are (mass) * (distance squared). So m is in slugs, R in feet, so I is in slug·ft².

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in different units. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that I can ignore units and just compute the numerical value, as long as the units are consistent.

So now, the torque is given as 225 lb-ft. Torque τ is equal to I * α (angular acceleration). So, α = τ / I.

So τ is 225 lb-ft, I is 37.5 lb-ft².

So α = 225 / 37.5 = 6 rad/s².

Wait, 225 divided by 37.5: 37.5 *6 is 225, so yes, α is 6 rad/s².

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.3, option B is 3.5, etc. So option A is 6.3, which is higher than 6. Oh wait, no, wait 6 is exactly 6, but none of the options is 6. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, let me double-check the units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing I.

Wait, earlier calculation: m = 600 lb / (32 ft/s²) = 18.75 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, but 1 slug is 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So 18.75 lb·s²/ft is (18.75 / 32.174) slug.

So m = (18.75 /32.174) slug ≈ 0.582 slug.

R is 2 ft.

So I = (1/2) * m * R².

So I = 0.5 * 0.582 slug * (2 ft)^2.

Calculating that: 0.5 *0.582 *4 = 0.5 *2.328 = 1.164 slug·ft².

Now, τ is 225 lb-ft, so α = τ / I = 225 / 1.164 ≈ ?

Compute 225 / 1.164. Let's see, 1.164 * 193 ≈ 225. Because 200 *1.164=232.8. So 193 *1.164=?

Yes, 193 *1.164: 200*1.164 is 232.8. Subtract 7 *1.164: 8.148. So 232.8 -8.148=224.652, which is almost 225. So 193. So approximately 193 rad/s². But wait, that's way higher than any option given. None of the options are near 193.

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. The moment of inertia I for a disk is (1/2) m R². So for a uniform disk, yes.

Wait, let me recheck the moment of inertia calculation.

Wait, m is 18.75 lb·s²/ft? That can't be right. Because 1 slug is 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So 32.174 lb·s²/ft is 1 slug. So 18.75 lb·s²/ft is 18.75 /32.174 ≈ 0.582 slug.

So I = (1/2) * 0.582 slug * (2 ft)^2 = 0.5 * 0.582 *4 = 0.5 *2.328 = 1.164 slug·ft².

So I is 1.164 slug·ft².

Torque τ is 225 lb-ft.

So α = τ / I = 225 / 1.164 ≈ 193. So around 193 rad/s².

But none of the options are close to that. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia should be (1/2) m R², with m in slugs and R in feet.

But m is in slugs: 600 lb / (32.174 lb·s²/ft ) = (600 /32.174) slug ≈ 18.70 slug.

Wait, no, because (600 lb)/(32.174 lb·s²/ft) ) = (600 /32.174) * (ft / s²) ??? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, because 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So 1 lb = 1/(32.174) slug·s².

So 600 lb = 600 /32.174 slug·s².

So m = 600 lb / (32.174 lb·s²/ft ) * (ft) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, the formula for moment of inertia is I = (1/2) m R². Here, m is in slugs, R is in feet.

So m is 600 lb. Wait, no, wait: wait, weight is m * g, so m = W / g.

So W is 600 lb; g is 32.174 ft/s² (approx 32 ft/s²).

So m = 600 /32.174 ≈ 18.70 slug.

So R is 2 ft.

So I = 0.5 * 18.70 * (2)^2 = 0.5 *18.70 *4 = 0.5 *74.8=37.4 slug·ft².

So I is 37.4 slug·ft².

Torque τ is 225 lb-ft.

So α = τ / I = 225 /37.4 ≈ 6.025 rad/s².

So approximately 6 rad/s², which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the torque calculation gave 193, but that must have been a mistake. So the correct answer is option A, 6.025 rad/s².

To solve the problem, we calculate the angular acceleration (α) using the formula:

\[
\alpha = \frac{\tau}{I}
\]

where:
- \(\tau\) is the torque (225 lb-ft),
- \(I\) is the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia \(I\) for a uniform disk is given by:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} m R^2
\]

where:
- \(m\) is the mass of the disk,
- \(R\) is the radius of the disk.

The mass \(m\) is calculated using the weight \(W = 600 \, \text{lb}\) and the gravitational acceleration \(g = 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2\):

\[
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{600 \, \text{lb}}{32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2} \approx 18.70 \, \text{slug}
\]

The radius \(R\) is given as 2 ft.

Now, calculate the moment of inertia \(I\):

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m \cdot R^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 18.70 \, \text{slug} \cdot (2 \, \text{ft})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 18.70 \cdot 4 = 37.4 \, \text{slug·ft}^2
\]

Finally, calculate the angular acceleration \(\alpha\):

\[
\alpha = \frac{\tau}{I} = \frac{225 \, \text{lb-ft}}{37.4 \, \text{slug·ft}^2} \approx 6.025 \, \text{rad/s}^2
\]

Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is:

**A) 6.3 rad/s²**
