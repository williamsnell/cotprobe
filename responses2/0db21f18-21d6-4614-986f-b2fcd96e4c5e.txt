Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the ionization constant, Ka, for this weak monoprotic acid. The question says that a 0.060 molar solution has a pH of 2.0. Hmm, I remember that for monoprotic acids, the ionization is HA ↔ H+ + A-. 

First, I should find the concentration of H+ ions. Since pH is 2, I can calculate [H+] as 10^-2, which is 0.01 M. Wait, no, wait: pH is -log[H+], so [H+] is 10^-pH. Oh right, so pH 2 gives [H+] = 1e-2 = 0.01 M. But wait, wait, the solution is 0.060 M in the acid. So the concentration of H+ is 0.01 M, but the acid is 0.060 M. 

Wait, I think I should set up an ICE table. The acid HA dissociates into H+ and A-.

Initial concentrations: [HA] = 0.060 M, [H+] = 0 (since it's a weak acid), [A-] = 0.

Change: Let's say x is the concentration of HA that dissociates. So [H+] becomes x, and [A-] becomes x. At equilibrium, [HA] is 0.060 - x, [H+] is x, [A-] is x.

But wait, the pH is 2, so [H+] = 1e-2 = 0.01 M. So x is 0.01 M. So [HA] is 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.05 M. So now I can plug these into the Ka expression.

Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA] = (0.01)(0.01) / (0.05) = (0.0001) / 0.05 = 0.002. Wait, 0.002 is 2e-3, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.

The options are: A:3e-3, B:2e-3, C:1.7e-1, D:1.5e-2, E:2e-1, F:2.5e-2, G:1.5e-1, H:5e-3, I:1e-2, J:4e-3.

Wait, so 2e-3 is option B. So is that the correct answer? But wait, did I make any mistakes here?

Wait a minute, wait a moment. So if [H+] is 0.01, then x is 0.01. So [HA] is 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.05. Then Ka is (0.01)^2 / 0.05 = 0.0001 / 0.05 = 0.002. So 2e-3 is 0.002. So that's option B. So why is the answer option B.

But wait, wait. Wait, the concentration of the acid is 0.060 M, so 0.06 M. But if the solution is 0.06 M and we have 0.01 M H+, then 0.05 M HA left. So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be B: 2.0 × 10^-3.

To determine the ionization constant, \( K_a \), for the weak monoprotic acid, we start by noting that the solution has a concentration of 0.060 M and a pH of 2.0. From the pH, we calculate the concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions as:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-2} = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
\]

The dissociation of the weak acid \( \text{HA} \) can be represented as:

\[
\text{HA} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:
- \( [\text{HA}] = 0.060 - x \),
- \( [\text{H}^+] = x = 0.01 \, \text{M} \),
- \( [\text{A}^-] = x = 0.01 \, \text{M} \).

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}.
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_a = \frac{(0.01)(0.01)}{0.060 - 0.01} = \frac{0.0001}{0.05} = 0.002 = 2.0 \times 10^{-3}.
\]

Thus, the ionization constant \( K_a \) is \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \), which corresponds to option B.
