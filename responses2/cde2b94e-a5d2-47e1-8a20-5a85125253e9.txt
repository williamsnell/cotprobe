Okay, so I've got this question about Mr. Stone taking a loan and how much he actually receives. Let me think this through step by step. 

The question says he borrows $4,000 for ninety days at 6 percent discount. I need to find out how much he actually gets. Hmm, I remember something about discount loans and how they're structured. 

Wait, what's a discount loan? Oh right, in a discount loan, the bank deducts the interest upfront from the principal amount. So instead of paying interest over time, you pay it all at the beginning. That means the amount he actually receives is less than the principal.

So the formula for the amount received (the net amount) would be: 

Net amount = Principal - (Interest)

But wait, the interest is calculated on the principal. So first, I need to calculate the interest. The discount rate is 6%, and the time is 90 days. 

Wait, I should clarify whether the 6% is the simple interest rate or if it's compounded. The question says "discount," so it's likely simple interest. But wait, sometimes "discount" might refer to the discount amount, but in this case, since it's "discount," it's about the interest being deducted upfront.

So, the interest would be 6% of $4,000, but since it's a discount, the interest is deducted from the principal. So the interest amount is:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
But wait, the time here is 90 days. So I need to convert that into a fraction of a year.

Assuming it's a 360-day year for simplicity (common in banking calculations), 90 days is 90/360 = 1/4 of a year, which is 0.25.

So, Interest = 4000 * 0.06 * 0.25

Let me calculate that. 4000 times 0.06 is 240. Multiply that by 0.25: 240 * 0.25 = 60. So the interest is $60.

Therefore, the amount he receives is the principal minus the interest: 4000 - 60 = 3940.

Looking at the options, option J is $3,940, which matches.

The amount Mr. Stone actually receives is calculated by subtracting the interest from the principal. The interest is 6% of $4,000 for 90 days, which equals $60. Thus, the net amount is $4,000 - $60 = $3,940.

Answer: J
