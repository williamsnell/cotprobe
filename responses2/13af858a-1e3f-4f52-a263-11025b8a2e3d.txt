Okay, so I've got this problem here about Dani and Joe with marbles. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says Dani has 45 marbles, and she has 5 times as many as Joe. I need to find out how many marbles Joe has. 

Wait, so if Dani has 5 times as many as Joe, that means Joe has a smaller number. Let me think about how to set this up. Maybe I should write an equation. Let me denote the number of marbles Joe has as J. Then, Dani's marbles would be 5 times J, right? So Dani's marbles = 5 * J.

But wait, the problem says Dani has 45 marbles. So substituting that in, 45 = 5 * J. To find J, I need to divide both sides by 5. So J = 45 / 5. Let me calculate that. 45 divided by 5 is 9. So Joe has 9 marbles. 

Looking at the options, option J is 9. So that must be the answer. Let me double-check: 5 times 9 is 45, which matches Dani's total. Yep, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

To determine how many marbles Joe has, let's break down the problem:

1. **Given**: Dani has 45 marbles, and she has 5 times as many as Joe.
2. **Let J be the number of marbles Joe has**.
3. **Equation**: 45 = 5 * J.
4. **Solve for J**: J = 45 / 5 = 9.

**Answer: J (9)**

Answer: J
