Okay, so I have this gas problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because gas laws can get tricky. Let me take it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says a gas occupies 1.0 liter at 27°C and 500 Torr pressure. Then the temperature is changed to 60°C, and the pressure to 700 Torr. I need to find the new volume. 

Hmm, I remember there's Charles's Law and Boyle's Law that apply here. Wait, but when both temperature and pressure change, which law do I use? Oh right, combined gas law. Yeah, because it combines Charles and Boyle's laws into one equation. 

The combined gas law is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. Right, because pressure and volume are inversely proportional when temperature and amount is constant. 

But wait, the temperatures are in Celsius, not Kelvin. Oh yeah, I need to convert them to Kelvin. So, 27°C is 300 K, and 60°C is 333 K. 

Let me plug in the numbers. P1 is 500 Torr, V1 is 1.0 L. P2 is 700 Torr, V2 is what I'm solving for. 

So, rearranging the formula to solve for V2: V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1). 

Plugging in the numbers: (500 * 1.0 * 333) / (700 * 300). Let me compute that. 

First, calculate numerator: 500 * 1.0 is 500, multiplied by 333 is 500*333=166500. 

Denominator: 700 * 300 is 210000. 

So, V2 = 166500 / 210000. Let me divide. 166500 ÷ 210000. 

Hmm, 166500 divided by 210000. Let's see, 166500 ÷ 210000. Let me simplify. 

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 1665 / 2100. Hmm, can I divide both by 15? 1665 ÷ 15 is 111, and 2100 ÷15 is 140. So 111/140. 

Wait, wait, maybe that's not the simplest way. Alternatively, 1665 ÷ 2100. Let me compute 1665 ÷ 2100. 2100 is 2.1 * 1000. 1665 divided by 2100 is same as 0.8 (because 2100 * 0.8 = 1680, which is a bit higher than 1665). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me do it step by step. 

Wait, 1665 ÷ 2100. 2100 is 21 * 100. 1665 ÷ 21 = 79.285... Then 0.79285... So 0.79285... But wait, 2100 is 21 times 100, so 1665 / 2100 is same as (1665 / 21)/100. 1665 ÷ 21 equals 79.2857... So that's 79.2857 / 100 = 0.792857. So approximately 0.793 liters. 

Looking at the options, option A is 0.79, option J is 0.69, etc. So 0.793 would round to 0.79, which is option A. Wait, but wait a minute! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the calculations. 

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 166500 / 210000. Both can be divided by 100, so 166500 ÷ 210000 = 1665 / 2100. Let me do this division. 

Alternatively, 1665 ÷ 2100. Let's see, 2100 goes into 1665 zero times. So, 0.

Adding a decimal point, and adding a zero: 16650 ÷ 2100. 2100 *7 is 14700. 14700 is less than 16650. 7 times 2100 is 14700. Subtract: 16650 - 14700 = 1950. Bring down a zero: 19500. 

2100 goes into 19500 how many times? 9 times (9 * 2100=18900). Subtract: 19500 - 18900 = 600. Bring down another zero: 6000. 2100 goes into 6000 2 times (2*2100=4200). 6000-4200=1800. Bring down a zero: 18000. 2100*8=16800, which is less than 18000. 8*2100 is 16800. Subtract: 18000-16800=1200. Bring down another zero: 12000. 2100*5=10500. Subtract: 12000-10500=1500. Bring down a zero: 15000. 2100*7=14700. Subtract: 15000-14700=300. Bring down another zero: 3000. 2100*1=2100. Subtract: 3000-2100=900. Bring down a zero: 9000. 2100*4=8400. Subtract: 9000-8400=600. 

Wait, this seems like it's starting to repeat. So the result is 0.792857..., which is approximately 0.793 liters. 

Looking at the options, option A is 0.79 and option J is 0.69. So 0.793 would round to 0.79, which is option A. But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes when the decimal is 0.792857, it's 0.79 when rounded to two decimal places. So the correct answer would be 0.79 liters, which is option A. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. The formula is V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1). Correct? Because Charles's law is V1/T1 = V2/T2 under constant pressure, and Boyle's law is P1/V1 = P2/V2 under constant temperature. So combined, (P1 V1)/T1 = (P2 V2)/T2. So yes, V2 = (P1 V1 T2 )/( P2 T1 ). 

Oh, wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units. The temperatures were given in Celsius, but I converted them to Kelvin correctly. 27°C is 300 K, 60°C is 333 K. So that's correct. 

Another way to think about it: if pressure increases and temperature increases, the volume should increase. Because, for example, if you heat gas, it expands. If pressure increases, same volume, it would expand. So the new volume should be higher. Wait, but in this case, the pressure is increasing from 500 to 700, which is higher, so V should decrease, right? Because pressure increases, assuming volume and temperature are changing. Wait, no, wait: let's think about the combined effect. 

Wait, initial state: P=500, V=1.0, T=300. 

Final state: P=700, V=? , T=333. So the pressure increased, and temperature increased. So according to combined gas law, since pressure and temperature are both increasing, but which effect is stronger? The volume would decrease if pressure increases, but the temperature increase would cause it to increase. Hmm, let's compute: 

Using the numbers, the calculation gave us V2 ≈0.793 liters, which is a decrease. So that makes sense. Because, the pressure increases and the temperature increases, but the volume went down. Let me think in terms of formula: The product of (P and V) is proportional to (T). So when P increases, V should decrease if T is held constant, but T also increases. So the effect on V depends on which effect is stronger. 

Wait, in our problem, since both P and T are increasing, the effect on V could be either way. But according to the calculation, it's a decrease. Hmm, but let me think about the numbers. 500 to 700 is a 40% increase in pressure. 27 to 60 is 33% increase in temperature. So 33% * the 40% = 13.2%, which would cause the volume to decrease by about 13%. So the original 1.0 L would go to about 0.868 L. Wait, but according to calculation, it's 0.793, which is lower than 0.868. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute again. 

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate the numbers. 

P1 is 500, P2 is 700. So P2 is 700/500 = 1.4 times P1. T2 is 333 K, T1 is 300 K. So T2/T1 is 333/300 = 1.11. 

So V2 = (P1 V1 T2) / (P2 T1) = (500 * 1.0 * 333) / (700 * 300). 

Compute numerator: 500 *1.0=500, *333=166500. Denominator: 700 *300=210000. 

So V2=166500 / 210000 = 0.792857... ≈0.793 liters. 

So that's about 0.79 liters, which is option A. 

But wait, earlier I thought that an increase in pressure and temperature would cause a decrease in volume. But according to the calculation, it's a decrease. So that makes sense because the pressure increase is more significant than the temperature increase. Let me see the ratio again: P2/P1=1.4, T2/T1=1.11. So (P2/P1) * (T2/T1) = 1.4 * 1.11 ≈ 1.554. So V2 would be V1 multiplied by this factor. V1 is 1.0 L. 1.0 * 1.554 ≈1.554, but wait no, wait: no, wait, the combined gas law says (P1 V1) / T1 = (P2 V2)/T2, which rearranges to V2= (P1 V1 T2)/(P2 T1). So which is (500*1.0*333)/(700*300). Which we've calculated as ~0.793. So that's correct. 

So the correct answer would be 0.793, which is approximately 0.79 liters, so option A. 

Wait but another thought: could I have made a mistake in unit conversion? What's 500 to 700? Oh, 500 to 700, that's a 40% increase, and 27 to 60 is a 33% increase. The product of the two is about 132%, which would cause V to decrease by around 32%, so 100 * 0.68=68% of 1.0 L is 0.68, which is not matching our calculation. So our calculation must be correct because the effect is more than just a 30% decrease. 

Wait, no: when you have both P and T increasing, and V2 = (P1 V1 T2)/(P2 T1), the ratio (P1/P2) * (T2/T1) is (500/700) * (333/300) = (5/7) * (1.11) ≈ 0.714 * 1.11 ≈ 0.792, which is less than 1. So V2 is 0.792 times V1. So 0.792 *1.0 L=0.792 L. So that's 0.79 L, which is option A. 

So the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = 60^\circ \text{C} = 333 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Plug in the values
- \( P_1 = 500 \, \text{Torr} \), \( V_1 = 1.0 \, \text{L} \)
- \( P_2 = 700 \, \text{Torr} \), \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 333 \, \text{K} \)

\[
V_2 = \frac{(500)(1.0)(333)}{(700)(300)}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
- Numerator: \( 500 \times 1.0 = 500 \), \( 500 \times 333 = 166500 \)
- Denominator: \( 700 \times 300 = 210000 \)
- \( V_2 = \frac{166500}{210000} \approx 0.793 \, \text{L} \)

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated volume is approximately \( 0.793 \, \text{L} \), which rounds to \( 0.79 \, \text{L} \). Among the options, the closest match is **A: 0.79 liters**.
