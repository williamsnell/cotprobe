Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the tax on a store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The store's assessed valuation is $6,640. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think it's the value of the property or something. But wait, in terms of tax, I think the assessed value is the amount that's taxed. So that's probably the base for calculating the tax.

The tax rate is $3.87 per $100. Oh, right, that's like a rate per hundred. So for every $100 of the assessed valuation, you pay $3.87 in tax. So I need to figure out how many $100s are in $6,640 and multiply that by $3.87.

Let me calculate that. 6,640 divided by 100 is 66.4. So there are 66.4 hundreds in $6,640. But since you can't have a fraction of a hundred, I think we use the whole number part. So 66 hundreds. So 66 multiplied by 3.87.

Wait, let me do that multiplication. 66 times 3 is 198, and 66 times 0.87 is let's see. 66 * 0.8 is 52.8, and 66 * 0.07 is 4.62. So 52.8 +4.62 is 57.42. Adding that to 198 gives 198 +57.42 = 255.42. But wait, that was 66 * 3.87. But wait, wait a second. I think I made a mistake here. Because 3.87 is per 100, so 66 * 3.87 is correct. Or wait, no. Wait, 66 * 3.87. Let me calculate 66 * 3.87 more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as 66 * 3.87 = (60 * 3.87) + (6 * 3.87). 60 *3.87 is 232.2, and 6 *3.87 is 23.22. So 232.2 +23.22= 255.42. So the tax before collector's fee is $255.42.

But wait, the problem says there's an additional charge of 2% of the tax as a collector's fee. So I need to calculate 2% of $255.42 and add that to the tax. Let me compute that.

2% of 255.42 is 0.02 *255.42 = 5.1084. So approximately $5.11. So the total tax would be 255.42 +5.11= 260.53. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. The options are A:256.97, B:275, C:300, D:262.11, E:258, F:5.14, G:268.11, H:270.55, I:245.89, J:280.13.

Wait, I got about $260.53, which isn't exactly one of the options. Let me check my calculations again. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I should compute the tax before adding the collector's fee first, and then add 2% of the total tax on top. Or perhaps I should compute the collector's fee as part of the tax. Let me read the question again.

The question says: the tax is $3.87 per $100, and an additional 2% is added as collector's fee. So it's a two-step process: first calculate the tax on the assessed value, then add 2% of that tax as a fee.

So the initial tax is 66.4 *3.87. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the assessed value is $6,640. So 6640 divided by 100 is 66.4. So 66.4 *3.87 =?

Wait, 66 *3.87 =255.42 as before. But 0.4 *3.87 is 1.548. So total tax before collector's fee is 255.42 +1.548 = 256.968. Approximately $256.97. Then, the collector's fee is 2% of 256.97. So 2% is 0.02 *256.97 =5.1394. So approximately $5.14.

So total tax would be 256.97 +5.14= 262.11. That's option D. That's one of the options. So the correct answer should be D: $262.11.

To determine the total tax on the store, we first calculate the tax based on the assessed valuation and then add the collector's fee.

1. **Calculate the initial tax**: The assessed valuation is $6,640, and the tax rate is $3.87 per $100. Dividing $6,640 by $100 gives 66.4. Multiplying 66.4 by $3.87 gives $256.968, which we can round to $256.97.

2. **Add the collector's fee**: The collector's fee is 2% of the initial tax. Calculating 2% of $256.97 gives approximately $5.14.

3. **Total tax**: Adding the collector's fee to the initial tax gives $256.97 + $5.14 = $262.11.

The correct answer is D: $262.11.
