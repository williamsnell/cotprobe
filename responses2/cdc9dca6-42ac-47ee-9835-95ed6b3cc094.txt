Okay, so I have this question about enzymes involved in DNA replication, specifically regarding DNA methylation. Hmm, I remember that DNA replication has different enzymes doing different things, and methylation is one of them. Let me think... DNA replication happens in the S phase of the cell cycle, right? And during this process, the DNA unwinds into two strands.

Wait, there are two main enzymes that copy methylation marks, I think. I recall DNMT stands for DNA methyltransferase. There are different types of DNMT enzymes. Oh right, DNMTs are involved in maintaining methylation patterns across generations, so they're maintenance enzymes, right?

Wait, but the question is about the enzyme that copies methylation from the parent to daughter strands. Oh, wait! I think there are two main DNMTs. One is DNMT1, and the other is DNMT3. DNMT1 is for short-term maintenance. Like, any changes in methylation patterns are copied by DNMT1, right? So it's the same strand replication, copying the new methyl marks from the parent.

Then there's DNMT3, which I think has different variants. DNMT3a and DNMT3b are the main ones, and DNMT3L is one of them. Oh right, DNMT3 is for long-term maintenance. That means it maintains methylation patterns across cell divisions. DNMT3a and 3b are the main subtypes of DNMT3, I believe. DNMT3a is mostly in the nucleus, and DNMT3b is more in the cytoplasm, but both are part of the DNMT3 family.

So the question is specifically about copying methylation from the parent to daughter strands. That suggests it's the maintenance phase, which would be done by DNMT1. Because DNMT1 copies the new methylation from the parent strand into the daughter strand, ensuring that the next replication step uses the correct pattern.

So looking at the options: A is DNMT1. B, C, D are DNMT3 variants. So the correct answer should be A.

The enzyme responsible for copying methylation marks from the parental strand to the daughter strand during replication is DNMT1. DNMT1 is a DNA methyltransferase that ensures the maintenance of methylation patterns by accurately copying the new methylation marks from the parent strand into the daughter strand. While DNMT3a, DNMT3b, and DNMT3L are involved in long-term maintenance and are part of the DNMT3 family, they are not responsible for copying new methylation marks during replication.

Answer: A
