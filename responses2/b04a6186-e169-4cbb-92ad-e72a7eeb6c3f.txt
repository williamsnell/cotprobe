Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about the coefficient of elasticity. Hmm, I remember elasticity is about how much one variable responds to changes in another. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition. Let me think.

Wait, the coefficient of elasticity is a measure of responsiveness. So, when the price of a good changes, how much does the quantity demanded or supplied change? Right, elasticity is generally calculated as the percentage change in one variable divided by the percentage change in another.

Looking at the options, option B says the percentage change in the independent variable divided by the percentage change in the dependent variable. That seems right. But wait, sometimes you have to take absolute values, right? Because elasticity is a ratio, not a signed value. But looking at the options, I don't see any that mention absolute values. So maybe B is correct because it's the ratio, regardless of sign or absolute change.

Option F is the percentage change in dependent divided by percentage in independent. Wait, no, because that would reverse it. Oh, wait, no. If we're talking about responsiveness, it's the percentage change of the dependent over the independent. Because elasticity is (ΔQd/ΔP) * (P/Q), which is (ΔQd/ΔP). So in terms of elasticity, it's percentage change in Qd divided by percentage change in P. So option F is the reverse.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Elasticity is usually (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). But when you take the ratio of percentage changes, it's (ΔQ%)/(ΔP%). So the coefficient of elasticity is (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q), but when expressed as a ratio of percentage changes, it's (Q%)/(P%), which is (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The coefficient of price elasticity is (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). But when expressing it as a ratio of percentage changes, it's (ΔQ%)/(ΔP%) = (P/Q) * (ΔQ/ΔP) = (Q/P) * (ΔP/ΔQ). Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, but the correct formula for price elasticity is (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P) ), which is (ΔQ/ΔP)*(P/Q). So that's the coefficient. So when you calculate elasticity, it's (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). So the coefficient is this ratio. So looking back at the options, option B is "The percentage change in the independent variable divided by the percentage change in the dependent variable." Wait, that would be (ΔP/ΔQ), which is the reciprocal of the elasticity. So that can't be right because elasticity is usually represented as (ΔQ/ΔP), or the other way around.

Wait, the question is about the coefficient of elasticity. So it's the measure itself, not the elasticity formula. So the coefficient is the ratio of the percentage changes. So if you have a price change that leads to a certain quantity change, you take percentage of price change divided by percentage of quantity change. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes elasticity is calculated as the ratio of the absolute values. For example, price elasticity is (ΔQΔP) * (P/Q), but when you take percentage changes, it's (ΔQ%)/(ΔP%), which is (Q/ΔQ) * (P/ΔP) * (ΔP/ΔQ) ? No, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of elasticity is simply the ratio of the percentage change in quantity to the percentage change in price. So that would be Q% / P%. So that would be option F. Wait, option F says "The percentage change in the dependent variable divided by the percentage change in the independent variable." So if the dependent is quantity, and the independent is price, then it's Q% / P%. So option F is correct.

Wait, but I thought elasticity was (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). So when expressed as a ratio, it's (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q) = (Q/P) * (ΔP/ΔQ)⁻¹. Hmm, but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, sometimes the elasticity is expressed as (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q), which is a number (like 2, meaning elasticity of 200%). But when talking about the coefficient itself, it's the ratio of percentage changes, which would be (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q) times (P/Q) / (P/Q) ? Wait, this doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The coefficient of elasticity is a measure of responsiveness and is given by (ΔQ/ΔP) multiplied by (P/Q), which is the formula. But when you represent it as a ratio of percentage changes, it's (ΔQ%)/(ΔP%). So (ΔQ%)/(ΔP%) = (P/Q) * (ΔQ/ΔP) * (ΔP%/P%), wait no, that's getting tangled.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient is a ratio of percentage changes. So if the price increases by 10%, and quantity decreases by 20%, the coefficient is 20% /10% = 2. So the coefficient is 2. So the coefficient is (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q) which becomes (Q%)/(P%) in this case.

Wait, so the coefficient of price elasticity is Q% / P%. But wait, the options. Let me check the options again.

Option F: "The percentage change in the dependent variable divided by the percentage change in the independent variable." So if we're taking Q% / P%, that's correct. So F is correct.

But wait, other options: for example, option B says the independent variable's percentage change divided by the dependent's. So that would be P% / Q% which is the reciprocal of what we're looking for. So option F is correct as it's Q/P%.

So the coefficient of elasticity is the ratio of the percentage change in the dependent variable to the percentage change in the independent variable. Wait, no, because in the formula, it's the other way around. But when expressed as a ratio of percentage changes, it's (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q) × (P/Q) / (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q) ) ? I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The formula for price elasticity is (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q). It's a unitless measure. So when you take the ratio of percentage changes, it's (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q) × (P/Q)/(Q/P) )? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought. The coefficient of elasticity is the coefficient that relates the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in price, which is called price elasticity. So the formula is (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q), which is the same as (Q/Q) × (P/P) × (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q) ) — not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as (Q% change)/(P% change) being the coefficient.

So for example, if price decreases by 10% and quantity increases by 20%, the coefficient is 20%/10% = 2. So that's option F.

But wait, the formula for elasticity is (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q), which is a number. So the coefficient itself is that number, but when expressed as a ratio of percentage changes, it's (Q%)/(P%) = (P/Q) × (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q) ? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the coefficient of elasticity, which is the measure, not the formula. So the coefficient is the ratio of the percentage change in the dependent variable to the percentage change in the independent variable. So if the dependent is quantity demanded and independent is price, then it's Q% / P%. So that's option F.

But wait, another angle. The coefficient of price elasticity is (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q). But when you take percentage changes, it's (ΔQ%)/(ΔP%) = (Q%)/(P%). But wait, the coefficient is (ΔQ/ΔP)*(P/Q). So when expressed as a ratio of percentage changes, it's (Q%)/(P%) = (P/Q)*(ΔQ/ΔP) * (ΔP/ΔQ) = (P/Q)*(ΔQ/ΔP)*(P/Q) ? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q) = elasticity. So, when you have the coefficient, it's that ratio. So if someone says the coefficient is 2, that means a 2% increase in quantity for a 1% increase in price. So, the coefficient is (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). 

So when you express this as a ratio of percentage changes, it's (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q) ) × (P/Q)/(Q/P) ) — that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient itself is (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). So, when the question says "the coefficient of elasticity" which is E, then E is that ratio. So it's Q% / P% which is option F.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. The question is about the coefficient, so which option correctly describes it. 

Looking at the options again:

A: Sum of both % changes — no, elasticity is a ratio, not a sum.

B: % independent / % dependent — which would be the inverse of what we need.

C: % change in indep / absolute change in dep — no, because it's a ratio, not absolute.

D: absolute change in dep / absolute change in indep — no, because it's the actual change, not the percentage.

E: change in dep / change in indep — no, as it's the actual change, not the percentage.

F: % dep / % indep — correct as it's the ratio of percentage changes, which is the coefficient.

G: change in indep / change in dep — no, it's the reciprocal.

H: % dep / absolute change in indep — no, because it's about the change in indep, which is absolute, but elasticity is a ratio.

I: absolute change in indep / % dep — no, same issue.

J: sum of dep and indep — no.

So the correct answer is F.
</think>

The coefficient of elasticity is a measure of responsiveness, calculated as the percentage change in the dependent variable divided by the percentage change in the independent variable. It represents how much the dependent variable changes in response to a change in the independent variable, expressed as a ratio of percentage changes. 

Analyzing the options:

- **B**: Incorrect. This represents the inverse of the coefficient, as it would be the percentage change in the independent variable divided by the dependent variable.
- **F**: Correct. This accurately describes the coefficient of elasticity as the ratio of percentage changes in the dependent and independent variables.
- The other options either involve absolute values (C, D, G, H, J) or mix up the order of changes (A, E, I) or use the wrong formula (B, F, etc.).

Thus, the correct answer is **F**.
