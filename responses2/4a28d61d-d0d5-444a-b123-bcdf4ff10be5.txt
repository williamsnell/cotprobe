Okay, so I've got this question here about figuring out the day of the week 10^(10^10) days from now. Today is Wednesday, so I need to find out what day that will be. Hmm, the number is really big—10 to the power of 10 to the power of 10. That's a googolplex? Wait, no, 10^(10^10) is a googolplex? Or wait, no, a googol is 10^100, so a googolplex is 10^googol. Wait, so 10^(10^10) would be 10 raised to the 10^10th power? Yes, that's correct. 

So, the calculation is 10^(10^10) days from Wednesday. But that's a huge number. I can't calculate it directly, so I need another approach. Maybe using modular arithmetic? Because the days of the week repeat every 7 days, so if I can find the remainder when that huge number is divided by 7, I can figure out how many days that is ahead, and thus determine the day of the week.

Wait, but 10 and 7 are coprime, right? Because 10 mod 7 is 3, which is not zero. So Euler's theorem might help here. Euler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ is Euler's totient function. Since 10 and 7 are coprime, φ(7) is 6 because 7 is prime. So 10^6 ≡ 1 mod 7.

But wait, our exponent here is 10^10, so the exponent is 10^10. So I need to compute 10^(10^10) mod 7. Because 10^(exponent) mod 7 can be simplified using Euler's theorem.

So the exponent is 10^10. Since φ(7)=6, I can reduce the exponent modulo 6. Because 10^k mod 7 would cycle every 6 exponents. So 10^(10^10) mod 7 is the same as 10^( (10^10 mod 6) ) mod 7. 

Wait, I think I got that right. So first, let me find 10^10 mod 6. Because the exponent is 10^10, but since we're dealing with exponents in mod φ(n), which is 6, we can reduce the exponent modulo 6.

Wait, but let me think again. Euler's theorem says that a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n. So for a=10, n=7, φ(7)=6. So 10^6 ≡ 1 mod 7. So 10^k mod 7 is equal to 10^(k mod 6) mod 7. So to compute 10^m mod 7, where m is 10^10, I can compute m mod 6 first.

So m = 10^10. Let me find 10^10 mod 6. 10 mod 6 is 4. So 10^1 mod 6 =4; 10^2 mod6= 4^2=16 mod6=4; Wait, 4 squared is 16, which mod6 is 4 (because 6*2=12, 16-12=4). So 10^2 mod6=4.

Hmm, so 10^k mod6 for any k >=1 is 4? Because 10 mod6 is 4, and 4^k mod6. Let's see: 4^1=4 mod6 →4. 4^2=16 mod6 →4. It's always 4. So 10^k mod6 is 4 for any k >=1.

Therefore, 10^10 mod6=4. So the exponent for 10^(10^10) mod7 is 4. So 10^4 mod7. Let me compute that.

Wait, 10^1 mod7=3, 10^2=3^2=9 mod7=2, 10^3=2*3=6 mod7, 10^4=6*3=18 mod7=4 (since 7*2=14, 18-14=4). So 10^4 mod7=4. Wait, but wait: 10^1 is 10 mod7=3, 10^2 is 3*10=30 mod7=2 (because 7*4=28, 30-28=2). 10^3 is 2*10=20 mod7=6 (7*2=14, 20-14=6). 10^4 is 6*10=60 mod7. 7*8=56, so 60-56=4. So 10^4 mod7=4. 

So 10^(10^10) mod7=4. 

Wait, but so the total number of days is 10^(10^10), which modulo7 is 4. So that means 4 days ahead. But I'm trying to find the day of the week. Since today is Wednesday, adding 4 days would be: Wednesday +4 days is Sunday. Is that right?

Wait, wait, let's check the steps again. Oh wait, because 4 days ahead from Wednesday is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (that's four days). So Wednesday +4 days is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recheck the calculation because I'm a bit confused. So 10^(10^10) mod7. Using Euler's theorem, φ(7)=6, so 10^6≡1 mod7. So 10^k mod7 is 10^(k mod6) mod7. So 10^10 mod6 is 4, so 10^10 ≡4 mod6. So 10^(10^10) mod7 is 10^4 mod7. 10^4 mod7 is 4, as we calculated.

So 4 days ahead from Wednesday is Sunday. So the correct answer is A: Sunday.

The day of the week 10^(10^10) days from Wednesday can be determined using modular arithmetic. Since the days of the week repeat every 7 days, we calculate 10^(10^10) mod 7. Using Euler's theorem, we find that 10^(6) ≡ 1 mod 7, so 10^(10^10) mod 6 is 4 (since 10^10 mod 6 = 4). Thus, 10^(10^10) mod 7 = 10^4 mod 7 = 4. Adding 4 days to Wednesday gives Sunday. 

Answer: A: Sunday
