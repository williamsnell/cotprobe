Okay, so I've got this question about operant conditioning, which I remember from psychology class. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking what's called when a behavior is automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus. The options are A to J.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Let's see. The options are:

A: aversive stimulus. Hmm, stimuli are conditions, not responses. So probably not A.

B: learned response. Wait, learned responses are part of conditioned responses, right? So B is probably not the right term.

C: conditioned response. Okay, I remember that conditioning involves creating a conditioned response. So this sounds like it's about a learned response, which is C.

D: negative reinforcement. That's when a response is strengthened by adding a consequence. So D is more about adding a reward, not about what happens automatically.

E: cognitive response. That seems unrelated. Responses are usually physical or behavioral, not mental.

F: reflex. A reflex is a learned behavior, so F is a possible answer. But the question is about an environmental stimulus, not a learned reflex.

G: condition. Wait, in conditioning, a condition is a stimulus that results in a response. So maybe G is a condition, but I'm not sure if that's the term they're looking for.

H: unconditioned stimulus. Unconditioned stimuli are things that are naturally associated with a response. So H is the opposite of what the question is asking.

I: reinforcement. This is about adding a consequence to a response, but again, the question is about what happens automatically, not the method.

J: operant behavior. Wait, operant behavior refers to any behavior that is a result of conditioning, which includes both conditioned and unconditioned responses. So J seems to fit as a broad term, but the question seems to be looking for a specific type of response.

Wait, let me think. The question says the behavior is automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus. So what's that called? I think it's a conditioned response because it's a learned response that's caused by conditioning.

So looking back at the options, C is conditioned response. That makes sense. Alternatively, F is a reflex, which is also a learned behavior. But the question specifies an environmental stimulus, which is a condition, but I'm not sure if that's the right term either.

Wait, another angle. The process of learning is called conditioning, and the result is a conditioned response. So the behavior that's automatically elicited is a conditioned response, which is option C.

So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is **C: conditioned response**. 

**Explanation**: 
- The question asks for a behavior automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus. This refers to a conditioned response, which results from conditioning and is learned through interaction with the environment. It is not an unconditioned response, and thus C is the appropriate choice.
