Okay, so I have this problem where a young person wants to invest $k$ dollars each year continuously at a 7.5% annual return rate, compounded continuously. They want to have $1 million available for retirement in 40 years. I need to find the value of k. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when dealing with continuous investments, the formula involves integrating the investment over time. The formula for the future value when you have continuous contributions is an integral of the investment multiplied by the growth factor. So, the formula would be something like FV = k * ∫(e^{rt} dt) from t=0 to t=40. Wait, but actually, I think it's more like FV = k * (e^{rT} - 1)/r, where T is the time in years. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for the future value of a continuous annuity is FV = (k/r)(e^{rT} - 1). Yeah, that sounds right.

So, plugging in the numbers. The rate r is 7.5%, which is 0.075. The time T is 40 years. The future value FV should be $1,000,000. So, setting up the equation: 1,000,000 = (k / 0.075)(e^{0.075*40} - 1). 

Wait, let me compute e^{0.075*40} first. 0.075 times 40 is 3. So e^3 is approximately 20.0855. So the numerator becomes 20.0855 - 1 = 19.0855. So the equation is 1,000,000 = (k / 0.075) * 19.0855. 

Solving for k: k = (1,000,000 * 0.075) / 19.0855. Let's compute that. 0.075 times 1,000,000 is 75,000. Then divide that by 19.0855. Let me calculate 75,000 / 19.0855. 

Hmm, 19.0855 goes into 75,000... Let me approximate. 19.0855 times 3920 is approximately 75,000? Let's check: 19 * 4000 is 76,000, which is a bit more than 75,000. So 3920 would be a bit less. Let me compute 19.0855 * 3920. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do 75,000 ÷ 19.0855. Let me compute that more accurately. Let me see: 19.0855 * 3920 = 19.0855 * 4000 - 19.0855 * 80. 4000 *19 is 76000, so 19.0855 *4000 is 76342. So 19.0855*3920 would be 76342 - (19.0855 *80). 19.0855 *80= 1526.84. So 76342 -1526.84=74815.16. That's close to 75,000. The difference is 75,000 -74815.16=184.84. So how much more do I need to add? Each additional 1 in the multiplier adds 19.0855. So 184.84 /19.0855 ≈9.68. So 3920 +9.68≈3929.68. So k≈3929.68. Hmm, looking at the options, option H is 3930. That would be the closest. So the answer should be H: 3930.

To determine the annual contribution \( k \) required to reach \$1 million in 40 years with a continuous 7.5% return, we use the formula for the future value of a continuous annuity:

\[
FV = \frac{k}{r} (e^{rT} - 1)
\]

Given:
- \( FV = \$1,000,000 \)
- \( r = 7.5\% = 0.075 \)
- \( T = 40 \) years

Plugging in the values:
\[
1,000,000 = \frac{k}{0.075} (e^{0.075 \times 40} - 1)
\]
\[
e^{3} \approx 20.0855
\]
\[
1,000,000 = \frac{k}{0.075} (20.0855 - 1)
\]
\[
1,000,000 = \frac{k}{0.075} \times 19.0855
\]
\[
k = \frac{1,000,000 \times 0.075}{19.0855} \approx 3930
\]

The correct answer is H: 3930.

Answer: H: 3930
