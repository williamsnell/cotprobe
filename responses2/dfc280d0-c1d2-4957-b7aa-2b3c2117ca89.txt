Okay, so I've got this question here about determining a number X that's uniformly distributed over the set {1, 2, ..., 256}. The process involves asking a series of yes/no questions, each of which is whether X is in a particular subset S of this set. The goal is to find out how many deterministic questions are needed to determine X. The options are from A to J, with various numbers like 1024, 64, etc.

Hmm, let's think about this step by step. I remember that in information theory, the number of bits needed to represent all possible outcomes is related to the amount of information needed. Since X can be any of 256 possibilities, the entropy, or the amount of information required, is log2(256) which is 8 bits. So, in theory, 8 bits should be enough because each yes/no question can give one bit of information.

Wait, but each question is a subset S. So each question effectively gives a bit of information, depending on whether X is in S or not. But the subsets themselves are chosen randomly. Oh, wait, the question says all subsets are equally likely. So for each question, the subset S is chosen uniformly at random, and then the answer is determined by whether X is in S. 

But wait, the subsets are chosen before the questions are asked. So in each step, we can choose any subset S. But since we need deterministic questions, maybe each question is a fixed subset. Hmm, or is it that the subsets are chosen uniformly at random, and each question's subset is determined by a random selection, and then the answers are based on whether X is in that subset? Or perhaps the subsets are determined in a way that each question is a partition, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me re-read the question: "We ask random questions: Is X ∈ S₁? Is X ∈ S₂? ... until only one integer remains. All 2²⁵⁶ subsets are equally likely." So, each S_i is a subset, and each question is about whether X is in that subset.

But wait, the subsets are chosen uniformly at random. So each S_i is a random subset, and each question is whether X is in S_i. Since all subsets are equally likely, each S_i is equally likely to be any subset.

But wait, if all subsets are equally likely, then the probability that X is in S_i is 0.5 for each question. Because each subset S_i has exactly half the elements of {1, ..., 256} (since there are 256 elements, and each subset has exactly 2^255 subsets, but wait no, wait: the number of subsets is 2^256, which is 2^256. Wait, 2^256 is a huge number, but each subset has a probability of 1/(2^256) of being chosen. So, when you ask about X being in S_i, the probability that X is in S_i is (number of subsets containing X) divided by total number of subsets. The number of subsets containing X is 2^255, since each such subset must include X and can include any combination of the other 255 elements. The total number of subsets is 2^256, so 2^255 / 2^256 = 1/2. So each question has a 50% chance of being true.

So each question effectively gives 1 bit of information, since each has a 50% chance. That makes sense.

Since the entropy is 8 bits, and each question gives 1 bit, we need 8 questions. Wait, but wait, each question is about a specific subset, which could be anything. But how do the subsets relate to the bits needed to uniquely identify X?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the subsets are chosen uniformly at random, each question gives 1 bit of information, and to distinguish between 256 possibilities, we need 8 bits. So 8 questions should suffice.

Looking at the options, option E is 8. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but is there a smarter way to choose the questions such that each question gives maximum information? Because sometimes, with adaptive questioning, you can do it in log2(N) questions, but in this case, the subsets are chosen randomly each time. Wait, but in this problem, are the subsets chosen in a way that allows us to determine X? Or are they fixed?

Wait, the problem says "we ask random questions: Is X∈S₁? Is X∈S₂? ... until only one integer remains." So each question is about a random subset S_i. So each S_i is a random subset, and the answers are whether X is in S_i or not. Each question gives 1 bit of information, since S_i is equally likely to be any subset.

Since each question gives 1 bit, and we need 8 bits to know X, we need 8 questions. So the answer is E: 8.

The question involves determining X, which can be any of 256 possibilities, using yes/no questions about subsets. Each question's subset is chosen uniformly at random, providing 1 bit of information per question. Since 8 bits are needed to distinguish between 256 possibilities, 8 questions are required.

Answer: E
