Question:

Elaine Morris, assistant to the sales manager of Cox Distributors, prepares a weekly summary of sales representatives' expenses. The following figures are taken from the records for the first week in September: Danvers, $203,75; Halleck, $187.50; Isaac, $185; Meade, $176.85; Munez, $163.90; Wooten, $214. Arrange the expenses in a column; then find the total of all representatives' expenses for the week.

Options:

A: $1,155.00
B: $1,250.00
C: $1,130.00
D: $1,200.00
E: $1,131.00
F: $1,210.00
G: $1,135.00
H: $1,145.00
I: $1,100.00
J: $1,160.00

Okay, so I need to figure out the total expenses for the sales representatives in the first week of September. The data provided is for six people: Danvers, Halleck, Isaac, Meade, Munez, and Wooten. Each has their own expense amount. Let me list them out to make sure I don't miss any.

First, I'll write down each person's expense:
- Danvers: $203,750
Wait, wait, no. Wait a second, the question says $203,75, but that looks like it's a typo. I think it's probably $203,750, because commas are often used to separate thousands. So that's $203,750.

- Halleck: $187.50
- Isaac: $185.00
- Meade: $176.85
- Munez: $163.90
- Wooten: $214.00

Wait, hold on. The first person's figure is written as $203,75, which I think should be $203,750. Let me confirm that because I might have made a mistake.

So, the numbers are:
Danvers: $203,750 (which is $203,750)
Halleck: $187.50
Isaac: $185.00
Meade: $176.85
Munez: $163.90
Wooten: $214.00

Now, I need to sum all these up. Let me add them step by step.

First, add Halleck and Isaac: $187.50 + $185.00 = $372.50

Add Meade: $372.50 + $176.85 = $549.35

Add Munez: $549.35 + $163.90 = $713.25

Add Wooten: $713.25 + $214.00 = $927.25

Now add Danvers's figure: $927.25 + $203,750.00. Wait, that's 203,750 plus 927.25.

Let me compute that: 203,750 + 927.25 equals 204,677.25.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Because 203,750 plus 927.25 is indeed 204,677.25.

Wait, but let me double-check by adding all the numbers step by step again to make sure I didn't miss a number.

So, let's list all the numbers:

Danvers: 203,750
Halleck: 187.50
Isaac: 185.00
Meade: 176.85
Munez: 163.90
Wooten: 214.00

Adding them:

Start with 203,750.

Add Halleck: 203,750 + 187.50 = 203,937.50.

Add Isaac: 203,937.50 + 185.00 = 204,122.50.

Add Meade: 204,122.50 + 176.85 = 204,300.35.

Add Munez: 204,300.35 + 163.90 = 204,464.25.

Add Wooten: 204,464.25 + 214.00 = 204,678.25.

Wait a second, that's different from my previous total. Earlier I thought Danvers was 203,750, but maybe I misread the commas. Wait, perhaps the commas are part of the numbers, not thousands. Let me check the original data.

Wait, the user wrote: $203,75; Halleck, $187.50; Isaac, $185; Meade, $176.85; Munez, $163.90; Wooten, $214.

Hmm, the first number is written as $203,75; which is probably $203,750. Because the comma is used to separate thousands, so 203,750.

Wait that's the case. So, the sum is 203,750 + 187.50 + 185 + 176.85 + 163.90 + 214.

Let me compute that again properly.

Start with 203,750.

Add 187.50: 203,750 + 187.5 = 203,937.5.

Add 185: 203,937.5 + 185 = 204,122.5.

Add 176.85: 204,122.5 + 176.85 = 204,300.35.

Add 163.90: 204,300.35 + 163.90 = 204,464.25.

Add 214: 204,464.25 + 214 = 204,678.25.

So, total expenses are $204,678.25.

Wait, but none of the options given seem to match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:
A: $1,155.00
B: $1,250.00
C: $1,130.00
D: $1,200.00
E: $1,131.00
F: $1,210.00
G: $1,135.00
H: $1,145.00
I: $1,100.00
J: $1,160.00

Wait, none of these options are close to $204,678.25. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the data.

Wait, perhaps the commas are just for readability in the figures, and the actual numbers don't have commas. Let me check: The user wrote $203,75; Halleck, $187.50; Isaac, $185; Meade, $176.85; Munez, $163.90; Wooten, $214.

So, for example, $203,75 is probably $20375, not $203,750. Because usually, $500,000 is written as $500,000 without a comma. So perhaps the commas are just for thousands, but the numbers themselves are without commas.

Wait, that's confusing. So let me break down each number:

Danvers: $203,75 → $20375.

Halleck: $187.50 → $187.50.

Isaac: $185 → $185.

Meade: $176.85 → $176.85.

Munez: $163.90 → $163.90.

Wooten: $214 → $214.

Wait, but then adding these together: 20375 + 187.50 + 185 + 176.85 + 163.90 + 214.

Let me compute that step by step:

20375 + 187.50 = 20562.50.

20562.50 + 185 = 20747.50.

20747.50 + 176.85 = 20924.35.

20924.35 + 163.90 = 21088.25.

21088.25 + 214 = 21302.25.

Wait, that's $21,302.25, which is even higher. But none of the options are around that. So that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the commas are part of the numbers. Let me try that.

If the numbers are written as $203,750, $187.50, etc., then:

Danvers: 203,750 → 203750.

Halleck: 187.50 → 187.50.

Isaac: 185 → 185.

Meade: 176.85 → 176.85.

Munez: 163.90 → 163.90.

Wooten: 214 → 214.

Adding all together:

203,750 + 187.50 = 203,937.50.

+185 → 204,122.50.

+176.85 → 204,300.35.

+163.90 → 204,464.25.

+214 → 204,678.25.

Again, same result. None of the options match this. So perhaps I'm misreading the data.

Wait, is it possible that the numbers are in thousands? Like, the first number is 203,750 → 203750.

But the options are all in thousands, like 1,210,000 etc. So maybe the data is in thousands, so I should sum them as thousand units.

Wait, that would make the figures:

Danvers: 203.75 (assuming the comma is just for thousands, and the number is in thousands. So $203.75 per unit.)

Halleck: 187.50

Isaac: 185.00

Meade: 176.85

Munez: 163.90

Wooten: 214.00

Adding all in thousands:

203.75 + 187.50 = 391.25.

+185 → 576.25.

+176.85 → 753.1.

+163.90 → 917.

+214 → 1,131.

Wait, that's 1,131.00. Looking at the options, option E is $1,131.00.

But wait, perhaps that's the correct approach. So the figures are in thousands, and we sum them as such.

So adding as thousands:

203.75 + 187.50 + 185.00 + 176.85 + 163.90 + 214.00.

Let me add them:

203.75 + 187.50 = 391.25.

391.25 + 185.00 = 576.25.

576.25 + 176.85 = 753.10.

753.10 + 163.90 = 917.00.

917.00 + 214.00 = 1,131.00.

So the total is $1,131.00.

Looking at the options, option E is $1,131.00. So the answer is E.
</think>

The total expenses for the sales representatives are calculated by adding all the given amounts. 

The figures are:
- Danvers: $203,750
- Halleck: $187.50
- Isaac: $185.00
- Meade: $176.85
- Munez: $163.90
- Wooten: $214.00

Adding them step by step:
1. $203,750 + $187.50 = $203,937.50  
2. $203,937.50 + $185.00 = $204,122.50  
3. $204,122.50 + $176.85 = $204,300.35  
4. $204,300.35 + $163.90 = $204,464.25  
5. $204,464.25 + $214.00 = $204,678.25  

However, this sum does not match any of the provided options. Reinterpreting the figures as thousands, the sum becomes:
- 203.75 + 187.50 + 185.00 + 176.85 + 163.90 + 214.00 = 1,131.00  

This matches option E.
