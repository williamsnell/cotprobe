Okay, so I've got this equation here: y divided by 4 equals 8. I need to find the value of y. Let's see, how do I approach this.

Hmm, the equation is y/4 = 8. I remember that to solve for a variable in an equation, I need to get it by itself. In this case, y is being divided by 4. So, to isolate y, I should do the opposite operation. The opposite of dividing by 4 is multiplying by 4.

Let me write that down. If y/4 = 8, then multiplying both sides by 4 should work. So, 4 times (y/4) on the left side would cancel out the division. On the right side, 8 multiplied by 4 is... let me calculate that. 8 times 4 is 32. So, y equals 32.

Wait, let me double-check. If I plug 32 back into the original equation, what do I get? 32 divided by 4 is indeed 8. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be 32.

The equation is y/4 = 8. To solve for y, multiply both sides by 4: y = 32.
