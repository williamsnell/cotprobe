Okay, so I have this question here about Harry's commission. Let's see, the question says that Harry is paid a 4% commission on all his sales. Last week, he sold $2,100 worth of goods. The question is asking, what was his commission?

Hmm, I think I remember that commission is a percentage of the sales amount. So, if it's 4%, I need to calculate 4% of $2,100. Let me think about how to do that.

First, I should convert the percentage into a decimal. 4% is the same as 4 per 100, so that's 0.04 in decimal form. Then, I multiply that by the sales amount. So, I take $2,100 and multiply it by 0.04.

Wait, let's do the math step by step. 2,100 times 0.04. Hmm, maybe I can break it down. 2,100 times 0.04 is the same as 2,100 times 4% of 100. Let me calculate 2,100 times 0.04. 

2,100 multiplied by 0.04. Well, 2,000 times 0.04 is 80, because 2,000 * 0.04 = 80. Then, 100 times 0.04 is 4. So, adding those together, 80 + 4 = 84. So, 2,100 * 0.04 = $84.

Looking at the options, option E is $84. So, that should be the answer. But wait, I should double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can think of it as 4% of 2,100. Breaking it down, 10% of 2,100 is 210, right? So, 4% would be a quarter of that, which is 52.5. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 210 divided by 4 is 52.5. But that contradicts my earlier calculation of 84. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. I think I got confused. Because 4% is 0.04, so 2,100 * 0.04 is indeed 84. Alternatively, 10% is 210, so 4% is 4/10 of 210, which is 84. Oh, right, because 4/10 of 210 is 84. So that checks out. So the correct answer should be E ($84).

Harry's commission is 4% of $2,100. Calculating 4% of 2,100:

4% of 2,100 = (4/100) * 2100 = (4 * 2100) / 100 = 84.

The correct answer is E: $84.
