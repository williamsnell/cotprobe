Okay, so I have this question here about finding all c in Z_3 such that the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) is a field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my field theory, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a quotient ring R/I is a field if and only if I is a maximal ideal in R. So, in this case, R is Z_3[x], which is a polynomial ring over a field, so it's a principal ideal domain. Therefore, any maximal ideal must be generated by an irreducible polynomial. So, the polynomial x^3 + c x^2 + 1 must be irreducible in Z_3[x].

Right, so I need to find all c in Z_3 (so c can be 0, 1, 2) such that x^3 + c x^2 +1 is irreducible over Z_3. Because if it's irreducible, the quotient ring will be a field.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: in Z_3, we're considering the polynomial modulo 3. So c can be 0,1,2.

Wait, but let me check if x^3 + c x^2 + 1 is irreducible. How do I check if a cubic is irreducible over Z_3? One way is to check if it has any roots in Z_3. If it has a root, then it's reducible. If it doesn't, then it's irreducible because the degree is 3.

So, let's compute f(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + 1 for c=0,1,2, and see if any of them have roots in Z_3.

Let's start with c=0: f(x) = x^3 + 0x^2 +1 = x^3 +1. Let's check if x=0 is a root: (0)^3 +1 = 0+1=1 ≠0. x=1: 1 +1=2≠0. x=2: 8 +1=9=0 mod3. Oh, wait, 2^3 is 8, 8 mod3 is 2. 2 + 1 =3 → 0 mod3. So x=2 is a root. So f(x) factors as (x-2)(x^2 + ...). So it's reducible when c=0.

Next, c=1: f(x)=x^3 +x^2 +1. Let's check x=0: 0 + 0 +1=1≠0. x=1:1 +1 +1=3=0 mod3. So x=1 is a root. Therefore, the polynomial factors as (x-1)(x^2 + ...). So reducible when c=1.

Now c=2: f(x)=x^3 +2x^2 +1. Check possible roots.

x=0: 0 +0 +1=1≠0.

x=1:1 +2*1 +1=1+2+1=4≡1 mod3≠0.

x=2:8 + 2*(4) +1. Wait, because 2^3=8≡2 mod3. 2x^2: 2*(4)=8≡2 mod3. So 2 + 2 +1=5≡2 mod3≠0.

So none of the elements of Z_3 are roots of f(x)=x^3 +2x^2 +1. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Z_3 when c=2.

Wait, but wait a second. Another point: but is the polynomial x^3 +2x^2 +1 in Z_3[x] irreducible? Because when you have a cubic, if it has no roots, it's irreducible. So yes, because in this case, none of the elements satisfy f(x)=0.

So the only c that makes the polynomial irreducible is c=2.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake. Maybe I should also consider the case where the polynomial factors into a linear times an irreducible quadratic. But since I already checked for roots, and found none when c=2, it must be irreducible.

So the answer should be c=2, which is option I. Looking at the options given: A is 4, which in mod3 is 1, but wait, all options are numbers, but wait, options are A:4, B:-1, etc. Wait, the problem statement has c in Z_3, which is the integers mod3. So c can only be 0,1,2. So the possible c's are 0,1,2.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

A:4 → which is 1 mod3.

B: -1 → which is 2 mod3.

C:0.

D:1.

E: -3 → which is 0 mod3.

F:6 → which is 0 mod3.

G:5 → which is 2 mod3.

H:-2 → which is 1 mod3.

I:2.

J:3 → which is 0 mod3.

So the options correspond to c=0,1,2 as:

c=0: option C.

c=1: D.

c=2: G.

Wait, but wait, let me see. The question is asking for c in Z_3, but the options are given as numbers. So in Z_3, 2 is represented as 2, which is option I. So the correct answer is I:2.

Wait, but wait another point: but I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck because I might have missed something.

Wait, when c=2, the polynomial is x^3 +2 x^2 +1. Let me check if it can be factored modulo3. Suppose it factors as (x + a)(x^2 +bx +d). Then expanding:

x^3 + (b + a)x^2 + (d + ab)x + ad.

Compare to x^3 +2x^2 +0x +1.

So:

b + a =2.

d + ab=0.

ad=1.

We can solve these equations.

We can try a=1:

Then, b = 2 -a =1.

d + (1)(1)=0 → d =-1 → 2 mod3.

Check ad=1*2=2. But we need ad=1 mod3. So 2≠1. So not possible.

a=2:

b=2-2=0.

d + (0)=0 → d=0.

ad= 2*0=0≠1. So no good.

a=0: Then b=2.

d +0=0 → d=0.

ad=0*0=0≠1. So no.

So no such a,b,d in Z_3. So the polynomial is indeed irreducible.

So the only c is 2, which is option I.

The quotient ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) \) is a field if and only if the polynomial \( x^3 + c x^2 + 1 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). To determine this, we check if the polynomial has any roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) (i.e., if \( x = 0, 1, 2 \) is a root). 

1. **For \( c = 0 \):** The polynomial becomes \( x^3 + 1 \). Testing \( x = 2 \) gives \( 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \). Thus, it factors as \( (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2) \), making it reducible.

2. **For \( c = 1 \):** The polynomial is \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \). Testing \( x = 1 \) gives \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \). It factors as \( (x - 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2) \), so it's reducible.

3. **For \( c = 2 \):** The polynomial is \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \). Testing \( x = 0, 1, 2 \) yields no roots. Since there are no roots, the polynomial is irreducible.

Thus, the only value of \( c \) that makes the polynomial irreducible is \( c = 2 \).
