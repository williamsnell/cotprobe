Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct total assets for Silvertown Office Supplies based on the given information. Let me start by recalling what a balance sheet entails. A balance sheet lists assets, liabilities, and equity. The total assets should equal the total liabilities plus total equity.

Looking at the data provided:

- Cash: $3,390
- Notes Receivable: $2,905
- Accounts Receivable: $8,215
- Merchandise Inventory: $23,600
- Store Supplies: $720
- Store Fixtures: $2,895
- Furniture and Equipment: $5,600
- Notes Payable: $5,250
- Accounts Payable: $4,800

First, I'll list out all the assets. Assets are usually what a business owns, so these would be:

- Cash: $3,390
- Notes Receivable: $2,905
- Accounts Receivable: $8,215
- Merchandise Inventory: $23,600
- Store Supplies: $720
- Store Fixtures: $2,895

Wait, does the furniture and equipment fall under assets? Yes, I think so because they're part of the assets of the business.

So let me add up each asset:

Starting with Cash: 3,390

Plus Notes Receivable: 3,390 + 2,905 = 6,295

Adding Accounts Receivable: 6,295 + 8,215 = 14,510

Merchandise Inventory: 14,510 + 23,600 = 38,110

Store Supplies: 38,110 + 720 = 38,830

Store Fixtures: 38,830 + 2,895 = 41,725

Furniture and Equipment: 41,725 + 5,600 = 47,325

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I missed adding the furniture and equipment to the total. Let me recount the assets.

Wait, maybe I should list each asset and add them one by one.

Let me list all the assets:

1. Cash: $3,390
2. Notes Receivable: $2,905
3. Accounts Receivable: $8,215
4. Merchandise Inventory: $23,600
5. Store Supplies: $720
6. Store Fixtures: $2,895
7. Furniture and Equipment: $5,600

So, the total assets are the sum of all these.

Adding them step by step:

Starting with 3,390.

Add 2,905: 3,390 + 2,905 = 6,295.

Add 8,215: 6,295 + 8,215 = 14,510.

Add 23,600: 14,510 +23,600 = 38,110.

Add 720: 38,110 +720 = 38,830.

Add 2,895: 38,830 +2,895 = 41,725.

Add 5,600: 41,725 +5,600 = 47,325.

Wait, so the total assets are $47,325.

Now, looking at the options, option H is "Total assets 47,325". So the correct answer should be option H.

The balance sheet lists assets on the left, liabilities and equity on the right. To determine the total assets, we sum all asset accounts:

- Cash: $3,390  
- Notes Receivable: $2,905  
- Accounts Receivable: $8,215  
- Merchandise Inventory: $23,600  
- Store Supplies: $720  
- Store Fixtures: $2,895  
- Furniture and Equipment: $5,600  

Adding these together:

$3,390 + $2,905 = $6,295  
$6,295 + $8,215 = $14,510  
$14,510 + $23,600 = $38,110  
$38,110 + $720 = $38,830  
$38,830 + $2,895 = $41,725  
$41,725 + $5,600 = $47,325  

The total assets are $47,325. Among the options, option H matches this total.

**Answer: H**
