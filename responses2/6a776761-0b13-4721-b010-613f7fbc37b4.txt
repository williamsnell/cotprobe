Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Let A and B be independent events with P(A) = 0.7 and P(B) = 0.2. Compute P(A ∩ B).

Hmm, right. I remember that for independent events, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, P(A ∩ B) should be P(A) multiplied by P(B). Let me write that down.

So, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). Plugging in the numbers, that's 0.7 multiplied by 0.2. Let me calculate that. 0.7 times 0.2 is 0.14. 

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 0.7 is the same as 7/10, and 0.2 is 2/10, so 7/10 * 2/10 is 14/100, which simplifies to 0.14. Yep, that's correct.

Looking back at the options provided, I need to find the one that equals 0.14. Let's see: Option C is 0.14. So that's the right answer.

To find \( P(A \cap B) \) when \( A \) and \( B \) are independent events, we use the formula for independent events:

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\]

Given:
\[
P(A) = 0.7 \quad \text{and} \quad P(B) = 0.2
\]

Calculating:
\[
P(A \cap B) = 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14
\]

Looking at the options, the correct choice is:

**C: 0.14**

Answer:
\boxed{C}
