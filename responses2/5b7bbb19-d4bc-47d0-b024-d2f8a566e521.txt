Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which step isn't part of COSO's effective internal control monitoring approach. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that COSO has standards for internal control, and each option is a step someone might take. Let me list the options to see which one isn't part of it.

The options are A to I. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Increasing the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with laws. I think this is about ensuring that the company is doing its reporting accurately and in compliance, which is part of monitoring. So A is a step.

Option B: Regularly updating monitoring procedures based on business changes. Updating procedures makes sense because business conditions change, so procedures need to keep up to keep the system effective. B is a step.

Option C: Conducting surprise audits regularly. Hmm, surprise audits are less common. I thought regular audits are more standard. Maybe this isn't a standard COSO step. I'll keep this in mind as a possible answer.

Option D: Whistle-blowing system. Whistle-blowing is a controls measure, so D is part of monitoring.

Option E: Prioritizing risks for effective monitoring. I remember that setting risk levels and prioritizing is a key part of the framework. So E is a step.

Option F: Establishing monitoring foundation. The foundation is the setup, like deciding how much monitoring is needed. Makes sense, so F is part of it.

Option G: Ensuring monitoring procedures are understood by everyone. That sounds like a foundational step, so G is a part.

Option H: Assessing and reporting results, including corrective actions. This is about evaluating and implementing results, which is part of the monitoring process.

Option I: Automating procedures as much as possible. Automation is a good practice, so I is a step.

Now, the question is asking which is NOT a step. So looking back, C is about surprise audits. I thought surprise audits are not standard, especially in COSO's framework. Maybe they are a newer or less common practice. Alternatively, if the question is about the most effective approach, sometimes companies prefer regular audits over surprise ones for consistency. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of COSO's approach.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the correct answer is C, because surprise audits don't fit the standard COSO approach. The others seem to fit. So the answer is C.

The correct answer is C. Conducting surprise audits on a regular basis is not a standard part of COSO's effective internal control monitoring approach. 

Answer: C
