Okay, so I've got this question here about inventory turnover rate for Kane's Record Store. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me some numbers from the ledgers: Beginning Inventory Purchases Ending Inventory. Wait, I'm not exactly sure what those terms mean. Let me think. Oh, right, in accounting, when they mention Beginning Inventory Purchases, I think that refers to the cost of goods available for sale. Because when you have purchases, you add them to the beginning inventory to get the total available for sale. So, it's like Beginning Inventory + Purchases = Cost of Goods Available for Sale. Then, Ending Inventory is subtracted from that to get COGS (Cost of Goods Sold). 

Wait, but the question is asking about the inventory turnover rate. Oh, right! Inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the Cost of Goods Sold by the Average Inventory. So I need to get two numbers: COGS and Average Inventory.

Wait, wait a second, the question gives me the beginning inventory, purchases, and ending inventory. Let me make sure I'm getting these correct. The problem states:

Beginning Inventory Purchases Ending Inventory = $16,000 = $58,000 = $14,000.

Wait, that's a bit confusingly written. Maybe it's Beginning Inventory, Purchases, and Ending Inventory, which sum up to $16k, $58k, and $14k. But I'm not sure how that ties into the calculation. Wait no, maybe the numbers given are:

Beginning Inventory = $16,000,

Purchases = $58,000,

Ending Inventory = $14,000.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because Purchases would typically be part of the calculation. Let me think again. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is using abbreviations or typos. Maybe it's:

Beginning Inventory: $16,000,

Ending Inventory: $14,000,

and Purchases: $58,000.

But then how do these relate to the formula? Let's see. The formula for COGS using the basic method is COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory. So COGS would be 16k +58k -14k = 60k. 

But wait, the question is asking about the rate of inventory turnover. That rate is calculated as COGS divided by Average Inventory. So the Average Inventory is (Beginning + Ending)/2. Let me compute that: (16k +14k)/2 = 30k/2 =15k.

So the formula would be COGS / Average Inventory = 60k /15k = 4 times. So the rate is 4 times per year.

Looking at the options, option A is 4 times, so the answer should be A. But wait, wait another thingâ€”could I have made a mistake here? Let me double-check.

Starting from the beginning, the company's beginning inventory is 16k, they made purchases totaling 58k, and ended with 14k. 

COGS = 16k +58k -14k = 60k.

Average inventory = (16k +14k)/2 = 15k.

Inventory turnover = 60k /15k =4. So 4 times. That's option A.

Wait, but the options also have other numbers. Let me check if I interpreted the question correctly.

Wait, the question says "Beginning Inventory Purchases Ending Inventory". Maybe that's a typo and should be (Beginning Inventory + Purchases) as the total, and then subtracting Ending Inventory. But that's what I did. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers given are the beginning, purchases, and ending, but I'm not sure how they're related. But according to the formula for inventory turnover, I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering Purchases as ending inventory, but that doesn't fit. No, Purchases would be part of the COGS as well, but the formula for COGS is beginning + purchases - ending.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is option A:4 times.

The question asks for the store's rate of inventory turnover using the provided numbers: Beginning Inventory Purchases Ending Inventory = $16,000 = $58,000 = $14,000. 

To determine the inventory turnover rate, we first calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) using the formula:

\[ \text{COGS} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{COGS} = \$16,000 + \$58,000 - \$14,000 = \$60,000 \]

Next, we calculate the Average Inventory:

\[ \text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \frac{\$16,000 + \$14,000}{2} = \$15,000 \]

Finally, the Inventory Turnover Rate is:

\[ \text{Turnover Rate} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}} = \frac{\$60,000}{\$15,000} = 4 \text{ times} \]

Thus, the store's rate of inventory turnover is **4 times**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
