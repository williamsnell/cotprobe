Okay, so I've got this question here about directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says: Given a finite directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) where E is not empty, which of the following must be true? The options are I, II, III, and the choices are combinations of these.

First, let's recall what a DAG is. A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph with no cycles. Since it's finite and acyclic, it has a certain structure. 

The question lists three points:
I. G has a vertex with no incoming edge.
II. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.
III. G has an isolated vertex, meaning no incoming or outgoing edges.

I need to determine which of the options (A to J) correctly state that these must be true.

Starting with I: Does a DAG always have a vertex with no incoming edges? Hmm. Let's think about a simple example. Suppose G has just one vertex and one edge pointing to it. Then the source vertex has no incoming edges, but wait, in that case, the destination has one outgoing edge. But wait, the question is about the source. So in that case, the source would have no incoming edges—so I is true. But wait, what about a DAG with two vertices pointing to each other? No, that's a cycle, which isn't allowed in a DAG. Oh, right, the graph is acyclic, so cycles are impossible. So in a DAG, any vertex can't have multiple edges pointing to it in a cycle. So any DAG must have a "sink" vertex with no incoming edges. Because if you have a graph that's a DAG, it's a partially ordered set, so there's a minimal element with no incoming edges. So yes, I must be true.

Moving on to II: G has a vertex with no outgoing edge. Wait, that's a source. Because a source is a vertex with no outgoing edges. So in a DAG, can there be a vertex with no outgoing edges? Yes. For example, take a DAG with three vertices A → B → C. Here, A is a source with no outgoing edges. So II must be true.

Now III: G has an isolated vertex. That's a vertex with neither incoming nor outgoing edges. Is this always the case? Hmm. Let's think. 

Take a simple DAG. Suppose it's just a single vertex with no edges. Then, that vertex has no incoming or outgoing edges. So it's isolated. But what if the graph has multiple vertices but no edges? But E is given to be non-empty, so E can't be empty. So the graph must have at least one edge. So in that case, if it's a DAG, can it have no isolated vertices?

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose G has two vertices A and B, and two edges A → B and B → A. Oh wait, that's a cycle, so it's not allowed in a DAG. So another example: two vertices A and B, only one edge A → B. Then, A is a source with no outgoing edges (II is true), and B has an outgoing edge to nowhere. Does B have an incoming edge? No, except from A. So B has an incoming edge and an outgoing edge. So it's not isolated. So in this case, G has a vertex (A) with no outgoing edge (II is true), but B has an incoming edge. So III is not necessarily true. 

Wait, but in this example, is there an isolated vertex? A has no incoming edges. B has an incoming edge from A. So neither is isolated. So in this case, III is false. So the claim that III must be true is incorrect. So the answer can't include III as always true.

Wait, but wait another example: suppose the graph is a single vertex with no edges. Then, no, because E is given to be non-empty. Oh, wait, the problem states |E| > 0, so E can't be empty. So every DAG in the problem has at least one edge. So in that case, can there be a vertex with no incoming or outgoing edges?

Wait, maybe in a graph with only one vertex and one edge. For example, G has V = {A}, E = {A→B} (wait, no, that would require B to be another vertex, but the problem is about a graph with V and E where E is the set of edges. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me rephrase. Another example: a DAG with two vertices, A and B, and edges A → B. Then, A has no incoming edges (so I is true). B has an incoming edge from A, so it's not isolated. So in this case, III is false because B has an incoming edge, but no outgoing edge. Oh, wait. Or wait, in this case, B has an outgoing edge? No, because the edge is A → B. So B has no outgoing edges. So II is true, but III is false because B has an incoming edge but no outgoing edge. So in this case, III is not true.

Wait, but is there a DAG where all vertices have at least one incoming or outgoing edge? Hmm. Let's think: a DAG with two vertices, no edges. But that's E empty, which isn't allowed. The graph must have at least one edge. So, in a graph with two vertices and one edge, like A → B. Then A is a source (no outgoing edge, so II is true), B has an incoming edge but no outgoing edge. So in this case, III is false because B has no outgoing edge, but II is true. So III is not necessarily true.

Alternatively, what if the graph has two vertices and two edges: A → B and B → A? That's a cycle, which is not allowed in a DAG. So that's invalid.

Another example: a graph with three vertices, A, B, C, with edges A→B, B→C. Then A is a source, B has an incoming edge from A and outgoing to C, C has incoming from B but no outgoing. So in this case, C has no outgoing edge (II is true), but C has no incoming edge (so it's isolated), but B has an incoming edge and outgoing edge. So II is true, but III is also true because C has no incoming edge? Wait, no, C has an incoming edge from B. So in this case, III is false because C has an incoming edge.

Wait, let me clarify. III is an isolated vertex, which is a vertex with neither incoming nor outgoing edges. So in the three-node example I just thought of, A is a source, B has both, and C has an incoming edge. So in this case, no vertex is isolated. So the graph doesn't have any isolated vertices. But the question is whether III must be true. So in this case, III is false.

Wait, but earlier I thought that III was false because in the two-node example, B has a incoming edge but no outgoing edge. So in that case, III is false.

Wait, but wait: In the three-node example, A is a source, II is true, but C has an incoming edge, so it's not isolated. So in this graph, is any vertex isolated? No. So III is not true.

So, in the case where the graph has at least one edge, III is not always true. Therefore, the statements I, II, and III are not all necessarily true. So which of the options are correct?

The options are:

A: I and III only → No, since III is not always true.

B: None of the above → Maybe.

C: I and II only → II is correct, but III may not always be correct. So C could be correct if other conditions are met, but let's see.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me check each part again.

I: Always true? Yes. Because in a DAG, there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges. Because if all vertices had edges pointing to some other vertex, you could have a chain, but in a DAG, the minimal element is a source. So I is always true.

II: Always true? Yes, because a DAG must have at least one vertex with no outgoing edges. So II is always true.

III: Not always true. Because in the two-node case, you can have a graph where A is the source (no outgoing edges, so II is true), and B is the sink (no incoming edges, so it's isolated. Wait, wait, but in that case, B is isolated because it has no incoming edges. So III would be true because B is isolated. But wait, another example: suppose G has three vertices, A, B, C, and edges A→B and B→C. Then C has no incoming edges, so it's isolated, so III is true. But in another case: two vertices A and B with edge A→B. Then B has an incoming edge, no outgoing edges (II is true), and A has no outgoing edges (so III also would be true because A has no incoming or outgoing edges? Wait no: A has no incoming edges, so it's isolated. 

Wait, in the two-node case, A is a source (II is true), and if the edge is A→B, then B has an incoming edge but no outgoing. So in this case, B is not isolated because it has an incoming edge. But A is isolated because it has no incoming edges and no outgoing edges (since E is non-empty, but wait, it depends on the edge.

Wait, the edge is A→B, so B has outgoing edge to nowhere. So in that two-node example, A is a source (no incoming edges, no outgoing edges), and B has an outgoing edge (no, because the edge is A→B, so B has no outgoing edges). So B has no outgoing edges, so it's a sink. But does it have an incoming edge? Yes, from A. So B is not isolated. So in that case, III is false because no vertex is isolated.

Wait, but in the two-node example, A is the source, so no incoming edges (so it's isolated), and it has no outgoing edges (so III is also true because it has no incoming or outgoing edges). Wait, but B has an incoming edge but no outgoing. So B is not isolated.

So in that case, the graph has one isolated vertex (A) and one non-isolated vertex (B). So in that case, III is not true because A is isolated, but II is true because B is a sink.

So in that case, statement III is not necessarily true. But in the three-node example I thought earlier, all vertices are not isolated. But wait, no, in the three-node example, A is a source, B has an incoming and outgoing edge, and C has an incoming edge but no outgoing. So C has no outgoing edge (II is true), but it's not isolated because it has an incoming edge. So in that case, III is false because C is not isolated.

Wait, but wait, another example: suppose the graph has three vertices with two edges: A→B and B→C. Then, A is a source (no outgoing edges, so II is true) and C has no outgoing edges, so II is true. But B has outgoing edge (to C) and incoming from A. So B is not isolated, but C is isolated because it has no incoming or outgoing edges? Wait no, because C's outgoing edge is to nowhere, so it has an outgoing edge. So C is not isolated because it has outgoing. So in this case, III is false because C is not isolated.

Wait, but in that example, A has no outgoing edges (II is true), but A has no incoming edges as it's the source. So it's isolated. So III is false because C is not isolated, but A is isolated. So in this case, III is not true because not all vertices are isolated.

Wait, but in a DAG, can all vertices have at least one incoming or outgoing edge? Let me think. Let's say the graph has three vertices, A, B, C, and edges A→B and B→C. So A is a source (no outgoing edges, so II is true), B has incoming and outgoing edges, and C has an incoming edge but no outgoing. So III is false because C is not isolated. So in this case, III is not true.

Hmm. So in some DAGs, III is true (like when there's a vertex with no incoming or outgoing edges), but in others, it's not. So statement III is not necessarily true.

Wait, but let's think of a DAG where all vertices have at least one incoming or outgoing edge. Is that possible?

Let me try. Suppose I have four vertices, A, B, C, D. Edges: A→B, B→C, C→D. Then, A is a source (no outgoing edges, so II is true), D is a sink (no incoming edges, so III is true). B has outgoing edge (to C) but incoming from A. C has outgoing edge to D, so no incoming, but I think that's not the case. Wait, no, C has no incoming edge (because edge is B→C), and D has no outgoing edge (no edge out of D), so D is a sink. So in this case, both A and D are isolated (II and III are true). But what about other vertices?

Wait, in this case, A is a source (no outgoing edges), II is true. D is a sink (no incoming edges), so III is true. B has outgoing edge, so not III. C has outgoing edge, so not III.

Another example: consider a graph with a single source and a single sink. Like A → B → C, and D is a sink? No, because that would form a cycle. Wait, perhaps a DAG with a single source and a single sink.

Wait, another example: A → B → C is a DAG. A is a source (no outgoing), and C is a sink (no incoming). So II and III are both true. What about other vertices? B has outgoing edge to C, so no, not III. So II and III are true.

Wait, but in some other DAG, can all vertices have at least one incoming or outgoing edge? Let's think of a DAG with two vertices: A and B, and no edges. That's not allowed because E is non-empty. So the minimal case is a single edge: A→B. Then, A is a source (no outgoing, so II is true), and B has an incoming edge but no outgoing. So III is false because B isn't isolated. So the only isolated vertex is A.

Wait, another example: three vertices, A, B, C, with edges A→B and B→C. Then, A is a source (no outgoing edges, so II is true), and C has no outgoing edges, so II is true. B has outgoing and incoming edges. So in this case, A is an isolated vertex (II and III are true), and C is an isolated vertex (II and III are true). B is not isolated.

Another example: four vertices, A→B→C→D. Then, A is a source (II true), D is a sink (III true), B and C have outgoing and incoming edges. So II and III are true.

Hmm, it seems that in every example I can think of, either II or III is true, but not both. So the conclusion is that in a DAG, II and III are not always true because sometimes only II is true, sometimes only III is true, sometimes both.

Wait, but the question is about whether each of I, II, III must be true. So for the question, which asks which of the options must be true, so if all the statements I, II, III are necessarily true, then the option that says all must be true is correct.

But in our earlier analysis, III is not necessarily true because in some DAGs, no vertex is isolated, but in others, some are. So option G (all of I, II, III) does not hold because III isn't always true.

So the options are:

A: I and III only → No, because III isn't always true.

B: None of the above → Maybe.

C: I and II only → II is correct, but III is not.

D: II and III only → II is correct, but III is not.

E: II only → No, because III is not always true.

F: I, II, and a vertex with one outgoing edge → Not necessarily.

G: All of the above → No.

H: II only → No.

J: III only → No.

So the correct option is B: None of the above. Because none of the options (A to J) correctly state that all three must be true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's think again about statement III. Is it possible for a DAG to have no isolated vertices? Well, no. Because in any DAG, there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges (I is true). At least one must have no outgoing edges (II is true). But it depends on the structure.

Wait, suppose a DAG has three vertices arranged in a chain: A→B→C. Then, A is a source (II true), C is a sink (III true), and B has both outgoing and incoming edges. So in this case, both II and III are true. So in this case, II and III are both true, but not all DAGs have this. For example, if you have a DAG where all vertices except one are in a cycle, but that's not allowed in a DAG. So perhaps in a DAG with at least two vertices, III is not always true.

Wait, another example: a DAG with two vertices, A and B, and no edges. That's not allowed because E is non-empty. So the minimal DAG with at least one edge has two vertices and one edge. So in that case, the source (II is true) has no outgoing edge, but the sink (III is true) has no incoming edge. So in that case, both II and III are true. So in any DAG where E is non-empty, at least one vertex has no incoming edges (II is true) and at least one has no outgoing edges (II is true). So II is always true.

So for the question, the statements are:

I: Must be true.

II: Must be true.

III: Not necessarily true.

So the correct option is B: None of the above. Because the question says, which of the options must be true. Since statement III isn't always true, none of the options (A to J) correctly state that all three must be true. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

The question asks which of the statements I, II, and III must be true for a finite directed acyclic graph (DAG) with non-empty edge set. Let's analyze each statement:

1. **Statement I (G has a vertex with no incoming edge):**  
   In any DAG, there must be at least one such vertex, which is a source. Therefore, I is always true.

2. **Statement II (G has a vertex with no outgoing edge):**  
   Similarly, there must be at least one vertex with no outgoing edges, which is a sink. Thus, II is always true.

3. **Statement III (G has an isolated vertex):**  
   An isolated vertex has neither incoming nor outgoing edges. In a DAG, it's possible to have no isolated vertices (e.g., a chain with two vertices where one vertex has no outgoing edges and another has no incoming edges). Therefore, III is not necessarily true.

Since none of the options (A to J) correctly state that all three statements must be true, the correct answer is:

**B: None of the above**
