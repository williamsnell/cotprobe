Question:

3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that they form a pair? (A 3-card hand is a 'pair' if two of the cards match in rank but the third card is different. For example, 668 is a pair, but 999 is not.)

Options:

A: \frac{1}{26}
B: \frac{13}{52}
C: \frac{1}{13}
D: \frac{72}{425}
E: \frac{1}{78}
F: \frac{4}{13}
G: \frac{1}{36}
H: \frac{3}{26}
I: \frac{1}{8}
J: \frac{1}{52}

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about getting a pair when choosing three cards from a standard deck. Hmm, I remember that a standard deck has 52 cards, with 13 ranks and 4 suits each. The question asks for the probability of getting a pair, which means two cards of the same rank and one of a different rank. For example, 668 is a pair, but 999 isn't because all three are identical.

Alright, let me think about how to approach this. Probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, first, I'll calculate the total number of possible 3-card hands. That should be the combination of 52 cards taken 3 at a time. The combination formula is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So, 52 choose 3 is 52*51*50/(3*2*1) = 22100. So, the total number of possible hands is 22100.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to get exactly one pair and one different card. How do I compute that?

Well, I think the approach is to first choose the rank for the pair. There are 13 different ranks, so there are 13 choices for the rank of the pair. Then, I need to choose two suits for that rank. Since each rank has 4 suits, the number of ways to choose 2 suits out of 4 is 4 choose 2, which is 6.

Next, for the third card, it can't be of the same rank as the pair. So, after choosing the pair's rank, there are 12 remaining ranks to choose from. For each of these ranks, there are 4 suits, so 12*4 = 48 possible cards for the third card.

Wait, so the number of favorable hands is 13 (choices for the pair's rank) multiplied by 6 (ways to choose the suits for the pair) multiplied by 48 (ways to choose the third card). Let me compute that:

13 * 6 = 78. Then, 78 * 48. Hmm, 70*48 is 3360, and 8*48 is 384, so total is 3360 + 384 = 3744. So, 3744 favorable hands.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this the correct way to calculate it? Let me think again. Oh, wait, because when you choose the third card, you have to exclude the cases where it's the same rank as the pair. But in this setup, when you choose the third card, you're not choosing a specific pair, just any card that's not of the pair's rank. But perhaps I didn't account for the fact that the third card could be of the same rank as another card, but that shouldn't matter because we're looking for exactly one pair. So, I think that part is correct.

So, the total number of favorable hands is 3744.

Therefore, the probability is 3744 / 22100.

Now, let me simplify that fraction. Let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by something. Let's try dividing numerator and denominator by 12.

3744 ÷12 = 312, and 22100 ÷12 is not an integer. Wait, maybe I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3744 and 22100.

Alternatively, I can factor both:

3744 = 3744 ÷ 16 = 234, which is 234=2*3*3*13. Wait, maybe I should factor 3744 and 22100.

Wait, 3744: Let's divide by 12: 3744 /12= 312. 312= 12*26. So 3744=12*12*26? Wait, 12*12 is 144, 144*26= 3744. So 3744= 12*12*26.

22100: Let's see, 22100= 100*221. 221 is 13*17. So 22100=100*13*17.

So, the numerator is 12*12*26, and denominator is 100*13*17. Hmm, perhaps there's a common factor. Let's see, 26 is 2*13, and the denominator's 13 cancels out, leaving:

3744 = 12*12*2*13
22100 = 100*13*17

So, both have a 13. So, divide numerator and denominator by 13.

3744 /13= 288, because 13*288=3744. And 22100/13= 1700, because 13*1700=22100.

So, the fraction becomes 288 / 1700.

Let me see if that can be simplified further. 288 and 1700. Let's check for common divisors. 288 is 2^5 * 3^2. 1700 is 100*17, which is 2^2 *5^2 *17.

So, the common factors are 2^2=4. So, divide numerator and denominator by 4.

288 /4=72, 1700 /4=425. So, 72/425.

So, the probability is 72/425. Now, let me look at the answer options. The options are:

A: 1/26 ≈0.0385

B:13/52=1/4=0.25

C:1/13≈0.0769

D:72/425≈0.1698

E:1/78≈0.0128

F:4/13≈0.3077

G:1/36≈0.0278

H:3/26≈0.1154

I:1/8=0.125

J:1/52≈0.0192

So, 72/425 is option D. So, the answer should be D.

The probability is calculated by determining the number of favorable outcomes (pair) divided by the total number of possible 3-card hands. The number of ways to choose a pair is 13 ranks × 6 (suits combinations) × 48 (third card choices) = 3744. Dividing by the total 52 choose 3 = 22100 gives 3744/22100, which simplifies to 72/425, corresponding to option D.
