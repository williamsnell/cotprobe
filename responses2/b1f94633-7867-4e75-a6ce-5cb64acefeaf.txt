Okay, so I've got this FORTRAN problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about writing a function to compute the Poisson distribution. The formula given is P(X) = e^-m * m^x / x!, right? So I need to write this function in FORTRAN, considering that X and m are integers, and that m is small enough so that no term would exceed the size of a real variable.

Wait, the options are A to J, each with different code snippets. I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about the structure of the function.

First, the function is called P and takes arguments X and M. I notice that in some options, the function uses FLOAT(M) or Y = FLOAT(M). Oh, right, because if m is an integer variable, we need to convert it to a float to use it in exponentials and factorials properly.

Looking at the options, the function must compute the probability P(X) as per the formula. The formula is P(X) = e^{-m} * (m^x) / x!.

So, the steps would be:

1. Compute e^(-m): that's the exponential function.
2. Compute m^x: that's m raised to the power of x.
3. Compute x! (x factorial): that's the factorial of x.
4. Multiply e^(-m) by m^x and then divide by x!.

But in the options, the function is written as P = EXP(M) * M ** X / FACT(X). Wait, that can't be right because the formula has e^-m, not e^m. Oh wait, wait, the formula says P(X) = e^-m * m^x / x!. So the function should have e raised to the negative m, not positive. So the code would be EXP(-Y) where Y is m.

Looking for that, in the options, the correct EXP part should be EXP(-Y). Let's see.

Option B: P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X). Oh, but wait, when X is the variable, the code is written in terms of M. So that's correct.

Option C: EXP(-M) * (M ** X) / FACT(X). So that's same as B but with a different Y variable. Wait, C uses Y = FLOAT(M), but in the code, it's written as M, perhaps? Or perhaps in the code, the function's parameters are X and M, but in the code, M is passed as a parameter.

Wait, the function's parameters are X and M, but in the code, M is being used as a float. So in the function, when you call EXP(-M), M is treated as a float. So in the function call, the first argument is M, which is passed as a float.

So the code in option B is P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X). That seems correct.

Looking at the other options, option B uses M as a float, so that's correct. Let's check option C: it uses M as an integer, but in the code for option B, M is passed as a float. Wait, no, the function's parameters are X and M as integers, but the code uses M as a real variable, which is correct because the exponential function can take a float argument.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me look at the code in each option again.

Option B: function P(X,M) as integers. The code is P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X). So the code uses M as a float variable, but in the function, M is an integer parameter. That's okay because in the code, M is accessed as a float.

Option C: EXP(-M) is correct, but in the code, M is used as an integer. So the code is written as M ** X, which is correct for integer M and integer X. But in the code, the function is defined as function P(X, M) with integer arguments, but the function uses M as a float. That's not a problem, because the code is treating M as a float.

Wait, but the function's definition in option C is function P(X, M) as real? No, the function is written as P(X,Y) in the other options. Let me check each option:

Looking back, the options are:

A: X and M are integers. The code uses M as a float.

B: integer X and M. The code is M ** X, so integer exponent.

C: function P(X, M) as integer X and M. The code uses M as a float, but M is a parameter of type integer, so M is treated as an integer in the code, but in the function, M is declared as an integer. So perhaps that's okay.

But wait, the function in option C is written as P = EXP(-M) / (M ** X * FACT(X)) which is opposite of the correct formula. Wait no, option C is:

C: P = EXP(-M) / (M ** X * FACT(X)) 

Wait no, no, no. Let me check each option:

Wait, let me read each option correctly.

Option A: P = EXP(M) * M^X / FACT(X)

No, that's incorrect because the formula is e^-m, not e^m. So option A is wrong.

Option B: P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X) → correct in the formula, but the function's parameters are X and M.

Option C: P = EXP(-M) / (M^X * FACT(X)) → That's incorrect because the formula is e^-m * (m^x) / x!. So option C is missing the exponential part correctly. It's e^-m over (M^X * FACT(X)), which is not correct. Because the numerator is m^X, but the denominator is M^X times FACT(X). Wait, no: the formula has e^-m times m^x, not m^x over (something). So option C is wrong.

Wait, the correct formula is e^-m * m^x / x!. So the function should compute that.

So option B is correct because it computes e^-M (since M is a float, so that's e^-m), multiplied by M^X, divided by FACT(X). But the function's parameters are X and M as integers. So when the function is called, it's passed X and M as parameters, but M is treated as a float in the code.

Wait, but when you call P(X, M), in option B, the function uses M as a float. So the code is correct.

Option D: EXP(Y) where Y is M as float. Oh wait, in option D, the function uses EXP(Y) where Y is M as float. So that's correct in the formula (since e^Y is e^-m, which is correct). But the code is P = EXP(Y) * M ** X / FACT(X). Wait, that's incorrect because the formula has m^x, not M^x. Oh, because M is a float, and the code is treating M as an integer. So for example, if M is 3, then M**X is 3^X, but if X is 5, then M**X is 3^5. But in the formula, it's m^x, so that's correct. But the problem is that the formula is e^-m * m^x / x!, but in option D, the code is EXP(Y) multiplied by M^X, which is m^x if Y is m. So that part is correct. But then it's not divided by x!, so option D is wrong.

Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option D: P = EXP(Y) * M ** X / FACT(X) → Y is M as float, so this is e^m * m^x / x! → which is the reciprocal of the correct formula. So that's incorrect.

Option E: P = EXP(Y) * M ** X / FACT(X) → same as D, but correct. Because Y is m, so e^m. So E is correct? Wait, no:

Wait, the formula is e^-m * m^x / x! → which is e^(-m) multiplied by m^x, divided by x!.

So in option E, it's EXP(Y) which is e^(m), multiplied by M^X (which is m^x), divided by FACT(X). So the formula would be e^m * m^x / x! → which is the inverse of what we need. So E is wrong.

Option F: P = EXP(Y) / (M^X / FACT(X)) → which simplifies to EXP(Y) * FACT(X) / (M^X) → which is e^m * x! / (m^x) → which is m^x / x! multiplied by e^m → which is not the correct formula.

Option G: P = EXP(-Y) * Y^X → so that's e^-m multiplied by m^x → correct, but then multiplied by FACT(X)^-1. Because the formula has m^x / x! → so G is e^-m * m^x / x! → correct. But what about the function's arguments?

Function G is defined as REAL X, Y = FLOAT(M). So M is converted to Y, which is a float. The code in G is P = EXP(-Y) * Y ** X → which is e^-Y * Y^X. Then this is divided by FACT(X). Wait, the code in option G is P = EXP(-Y) * Y ** X / FACT(X). So that would be e^-m * m^x / x! → which is correct. So G's formula is correct, but are the function parameters correct?

Wait, the function in option G is defined as P(X,Y) with X and Y as integers. But the code in the function uses Y as a float. So when the function is called, X and Y are integers, but Y is a float. So the code is correct, because in the function, Y is treated as a float for the computation.

But looking back, the function's parameters are X and M as integers, but in the code, M is passed as a float (Y). So that's correct.

Option H: EXP(-Y) * M ** X * FACT(X) → that's e^-m * m^x * x! → which is way off. So that's incorrect.

Option I: EXP(-Y) / (M ** X * FACT(X)) → which is e^-m / (m^x * x!) → which is the reciprocal of the correct formula. So I is wrong.

Option J: EXP(-Y) * M / X / FACT(X) → e^-m * m / (x * x!) → not the correct formula.

So which option is correct?

So the correct formula is P = e^-m * m^x / x!.

Looking through the options again, option B: P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X) → correct.

But wait, function parameters are X and M as integers. So in the function, M is treated as a float, which is correct.

Wait, but in option B, the function is written as P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X). So then, the code is correct.

Wait, but the function's parameters are X and M as integers, but in the code, M is treated as a float. So that's okay, I think.

So the correct function is option B.

Wait, but looking at option B, the function is defined as P(X,M) with X and M as integers. The code uses M as a float, so it's okay.

What about option C? Option C's code is P = EXP(-M) / (M^X * FACT(X)). That's incorrect because the formula is e^-m * m^x / x!, which is e^-m * m^x divided by x!, not m^x multiplied by x!.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but looking again, the function in option B is P = EXP(-M) * M ** X / FACT(X). So that's e^-m multiplied by m^x divided by x!.

Which matches the formula.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the correct FORTRAN function to compute the Poisson distribution, we analyze the formula and the given options. The Poisson distribution formula is:

\[ P(X) = e^{-m} \cdot \frac{m^x}{x!} \]

### Key Observations:
1. **Exponential Term**: The term \( e^{-m} \) must be used, which requires converting \( m \) to a float since \( e^m \) for integer \( m \) would overflow or underflow for large values.
2. **Factorial Calculation**: The function must compute \( x! \), which is correctly handled by the factorial function.
3. **Order of Operations**: The formula requires \( e^{-m} \) first, followed by \( m^x \), and then dividing by \( x! \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect because it uses \( e^m \) instead of \( e^{-m} \).
- **Option B**: Correct. It uses \( e^{-m} \), computes \( m^x \), and divides by \( x! \).
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it divides by \( M^X \cdot FACT(X) \) instead of \( FACT(X) \) after \( m^X \).
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it uses \( e^m \) instead of \( e^{-m} \).
- **Option E**: Incorrect because it uses \( e^m \) instead of \( e^{-m} \).
- **Option F**: Incorrect because it divides by \( M^X \) instead of multiplying by \( m^X \).
- **Option G**: Correct but uses integer arguments, which is allowed since \( m \) is converted to a float. However, the formula is correct.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because it multiplies by \( M \) instead of \( m \).
- **Option I**: Incorrect because it divides by \( M^X \cdot FACT(X) \) instead of \( FACT(X) \) after \( m^X \).
- **Option J**: Incorrect because it divides by \( x \cdot FACT(x) \) instead of \( FACT(x) \).

### Conclusion:
The correct function is **Option B**, as it accurately implements the Poisson formula with the correct order of operations and uses the factorial function.
