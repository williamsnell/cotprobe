The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: "You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia." Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: "You are abundant," so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: "You are poor and impotent," so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind."
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Joseph Stalin's speech and how it relates to later Soviet foreign policy decisions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question gives a passage about Stalin's speech where he refers to his country, Russia, as being beaten by various powerful people, including Mongol, Turkish, Swedish, Polish, and others. The key point here is that he refers to these beatings as a continuation of the process of "continual beatings," which he attributes to Russia's backwardness and backwardness in various fields like military, culture, politics, etc. He also mentions that these beatings are not against him, but rather part of the capitalist system that allows these men to exploit him.

Now, the question is asking which decision in later Soviet foreign policy supports this reference to "continual beatings." The options are A through J, each representing a different policy decision.

I think the key is to figure out what the speech implies about the Soviet government's stance on the role of powerful people and their impact. In Stalin's speech, he states that "they beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity." This suggests that the Soviet government views these powerful individuals as an advantage, not a threat. So, they're not taking kindly to them, which implies that the Soviet government is willing to accept the beatings as part of their system.

Looking at the options, I need to find which policy decision the Soviet government would support. Let's review each option:

A: Declaration of war against Japan. That was the end of World War II, but I don't think it relates to the beatings in the speech.

B: blockade of Berlin. That's related to WWII, but again, not directly about the beatings.

C: Support for Cuban Revolution. That's more about the Cuban Missile Crisis and the resulting arms race, which doesn't tie in with the beatings in the speech.

D: Building the Berlin Wall. That was a response to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Not directly related to the beatings.

E: Imposition of Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters. That's about the Soviet Union's counter-strategy against the Cold War. Not directly related to the beatings in the speech.

F: Signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. That was a mutual assured destruction agreement, which the Soviet Union did sign, but it's about mutual destruction, not the system of beatings.

G: Launching Sputnik. That's the first satellite, which was a big deal for space exploration. Doesn't seem related.

H: Diplomatic recognition of the PRC. That would be the Soviet Union's recognition of the People's Republic of China, but I don't think that's connected to beatings.

I: Invasion of Afghanistan. That was part of the Cold War, specifically the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Not related.

J: Creation of Warsaw Pact. That's the outcome of the USSR's response to the Soviet Union's early failure to win the Cold War peace negotiations. Not directly connected.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The speech is about the Soviet government's stance on power and the ability to exploit others. So, they're not taking kindly to powerful individuals, implying that they're willing to accept the beatings as part of their system. So, the Soviet government's foreign policy in the post-Soviet era would have included actions that support this, which is the creation of the Warsaw Pact.

Wait, but the options given don't include J ( creation of Warsaw Pact) as a possible answer. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option J is the creation of the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact was a regional union of countries in the area, including Poland, Hungary, and others. The creation of the Warsaw Pact was a response to the Soviet Union's failure to secure a united block in the early Cold War. It was a significant event in the post-Soviet period.

But wait, the speech was delivered in 1931, and the question is about later Soviet foreign policy. The Warsaw Pact was established in the early 1950s, so perhaps the Soviet government's foreign policy in the post-Soviet era would include the Warsaw Pact as part of their foreign policy.

Alternatively, another angle: the reference to beatings suggests that the Soviet government is not facing direct threats, or that it's indifferent, but perhaps the decision that reflects the government's stance would be the Warsaw Pact, which was a response to the failure to establish a united block.

Wait, but the options given don't have "the creation of the Warsaw Pact" as an option. Let me look back.

Wait, no, option J is the creation of the Warsaw Pact. So, perhaps that's the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference to beatings implies the government was more open to threats and thus supported the creation of a united block, which the Warsaw Pact was. Therefore, the correct answer would be J.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the original speech says the government is not wanting to be beaten, which would imply a more open policy towards threats. So, the government might have supported the Warsaw Pact, which was a response to the failure to form a united block.

So, the correct answer would be J.

The reference to "continual beatings" in Stalin's speech indicates that the Soviet government viewed these powerful individuals as an advantage, not a threat. This stance would align with the creation of the Warsaw Pact, a regional union established in the early 1950s as a response to the Soviet Union's failure to secure a united block in the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was a significant foreign policy decision reflecting the government's openness to threats.

ANSWER: J
