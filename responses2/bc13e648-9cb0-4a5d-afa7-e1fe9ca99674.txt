Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: Find -1 divided by -3 multiplied by 1 divided by (-1/3). Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's like this: -(1/-3) * (1/(-1/3)). Wait, no, actually, the original question is written as: -1/-3 multiplied by 1 divided by (1/-3). Hmm, maybe I should approach it as fractions and signs.

Let me tackle each part separately. The first part is -1 divided by -3. Dividing two negatives should give a positive. So, -1/-3 is the same as 1/3, right? Because a negative divided by a negative is positive, and 1/3 is the result.

Now the second part is 1 divided by (-1/3). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 1 divided by (-1/3) is the same as 1 multiplied by (-3/1), which equals -3. So, that part is -3.

Now, I need to multiply the two results together. So, the first part was 1/3, and the second part is -3. Multiplying these together: (1/3) * (-3) equals -1. Because 1/3 of -3 is -1.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the entire expression first before calculating. Let me see. The original expression is -(1/-3) * (1/(-1/3)).

Simplifying each part: -(1/-3) is the same as 1/3 because negatives cancel. Then, 1 divided by (-1/3) is -3, as I calculated before. So, 1/3 multiplied by -3 is indeed -1.

Alternatively, I can think about the signs. The first fraction is negative divided by negative, which is positive. The second fraction is positive divided by negative, which is negative. So, positive multiplied by negative is negative. So, we know the result is negative. Looking at the options, the possible answers are B: -1/3, C:1/3, F: -2, J: -3, H: -1, etc.

Wait, but I got -1, which is H. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:3, B:-1/3, C:1/3, D:2, E:2/3, F:-2, G:0, H:-1, I:1, J:-3.

So, I calculated -1, which is H. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me go through again.

First part: -(1/-3) = 1/3. Correct.

Second part: 1/(-1/3) = -3. Correct.

1/3 * (-3) = -1. So, the answer should be -1, which is option H.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the order of operations. Is the expression -(1/-3) multiplied by [1/(-1/3)] or is it (-1/-3) multiplied by [1/(-1/3)]? Because that could change things.

No, the original expression is -(1/-3) multiplied by 1/(1/-3). So, yes, the first part is -(1/-3) which is 1/3, and the second part is 1 divided by (-1/3), which is -3. Multiplying them gives -1.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as fractions. Let me express each part as fractions.

-(1/-3) is the same as ( -1 ) / ( -3 ) = 1/3.

1 divided by (-1/3) is 1 multiplied by (-3/1) = -3.

1/3 * (-3) = -1.

So, yeah, I think the correct answer is H: -1.

The expression simplifies to -1, which corresponds to option H.
