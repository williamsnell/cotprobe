Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Let's see. The given temperature is -10°C. I remember there are formulas to convert between these scales.

First, the Celsius to Fahrenheit part. I think the formula is F = (C × 9/5) + 32. So let's plug in -10 for C.

Calculating that: (-10) multiplied by 9/5 is... wait, 9/5 is 1.8. So -10 * 1.8 is -18. Then add 32: -18 +32 is 14. So Fahrenheit is 14°F. That's option F and G, but wait, the options list F as 14°F and 273K (since 0°C is 273K, but they added 273). Hmm, but wait, 0°C is 273K, so the absolute zero is 0 K. So for a temperature of -10°C, the absolute Kelvin would be 263 K (since 273 -10 = 263). So the K part is 263 K. Therefore, the absolute K is 263.

Looking at the options, option G is 14°F and 263K. So that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check everything.

Wait, but the question says, what are the equivalent Fahrenheit and absolute Kelvin? So the two answers are F and K parts.

Wait, option G is 14°F and 263K. So that's correct. But let me look at the other options too.

Option I says Fahrenheit is -10°F, which can't be right because the formula gives 14. So I is out. Option A is 20°F which is too high. Option B is -5°F which is way lower.

For the Kelvin part, 263 K. Let me make sure that's correct. 0°C is 273K, so subtracting 10 would give 263, which is correct. So option G is the correct pair for F and K.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 14°F and 263K. So that's correct. So the correct answer should be option G.

The question requires converting -10°C to Fahrenheit and absolute Kelvin. Using the formula for conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit: 

\[
F = (C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
\]

Substituting \( C = -10 \):

\[
F = (-10 \times 1.8) + 32 = -18 + 32 = 14°F
\]

For absolute Kelvin, the formula is:

\[
K = C + 273.15
\]

Substituting \( C = -10 \):

\[
K = -10 + 273.15 = 263.15K
\]

The closest option is \( 263K \). Checking the options, option G provides \( 14°F \) and \( 263K \), which matches our calculations.

ANSWER: G
