Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: I need to add 13 over 14 and 7 over 14. Hmm, both fractions have the same denominator, which is 14. That should make things easier, right? Because when the denominators are the same, adding the numerators is straightforward.

So, the first fraction is 13/14, and the second is 7/14. I'll add the numerators: 13 plus 7 equals 20. So, the sum should be 20/14. Wait, but I remember that fractions can sometimes be simplified or converted into mixed numbers. Let me see if I can reduce 20/14.

Both 20 and 14 are divisible by 2. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives me 10/7. Okay, so 20/14 simplifies to 10/7. Now, 10 divided by 7 is equal to 1 with a remainder of 3. Because 7 times 1 is 7, and 10 minus 7 is 3. So, that would be written as 1 and 3 over 7. 

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one. Option C says "1 and 3 over 7," which matches what I got. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 13/14 plus 7/14 is (13+7)/14 = 20/14. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2, getting 10/7, which is 1 3/7. Yep, that's option C. 

I don't think I made any errors here. The denominators are the same, adding the numerators was correct, and simplifying the fraction was the right step. So, the answer should be option C.
