Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about coping mechanisms, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking which of the listed options relies on internal resources to cope with a problem. The options are A through J, each with a different coping strategy.

First, I'll try to recall what each of these terms means. I remember that coping strategies can be categorized into different types, like emotion-focused or problem-focused, and they often involve different cognitive processes.

Emotion-focused coping involves using your emotions to manage stress or problems. So that's probably option A.

Dissonance reduction is when you seek out the underlying reasons for a problem to alleviate its symptoms. That sounds like it's about seeking solutions rather than reacting to it, so maybe it's B.

Problem-focused coping deals with the actual issue by addressing its root cause. So that would be option C.

Cognitive dissonance is the mental tension when people hold conflicting beliefs or desires. I think this is more about why people act in certain ways, not directly about coping mechanisms for problems, so maybe D isn't the right choice here.

Problem-solving coping is about finding solutions to problems, which I think is option E.

Behavioral coping involves using observable behaviors to control a situation, so that's J.

Appraisal-focused coping is about evaluating the situation to decide how to handle it, which would be H.

Defense mechanisms are ways to avoid stress, like avoiding contact with the outside world, so that's I.

Lastly, cognitive restructuring is a strategy where you change beliefs or thought processes to better understand a situation, which I think is related to problem-focused coping, as it involves restructuring your mental model of the problem.

Wait, the question is asking which relies on internal resources. So, I need to pick options that are about using your own thinking or knowledge to find solutions rather than external resources.

Problem-focused coping (C) and cognitive restructuring (I) both seem to fit this. Because problem-focused coping centers on addressing the root cause internally, and cognitive restructuring is about altering your beliefs to better understand the problem.

Looking back at the options, C is Problem-focused coping and I is Defense mechanisms. Wait, defense mechanisms are about avoiding the problem, not necessarily solving it. So maybe I's not the best fit.

Wait, problem-focused coping (C) is about solving the issue by addressing it internally, which uses internal resources. Cognitive restructuring (I) is about changing your mental model, which might involve thinking internally. So both C and I could be correct.

But the options are single letters, so I have to choose one. Let me think again. The question is about which depends on internal resources. Both C and I seem to fit, but I'm not sure which is more accurate.

Wait, problem-focused coping (C) is a strategy where you approach the problem by focusing on its cause, often using your own knowledge and reasoning. Cognitive restructuring (I) is about changing your beliefs or thought processes, which could be part of that. So both could be considered. But the options are singular letters, so I'm probably supposed to choose one.

Hmm. Looking back at the options, the correct answer is either C or I. But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: problem-focused coping is about problem-solving by addressing the cause, so it's about using internal resources. Cognitive restructuring is about changing your mental model to better understand the problem, which could also be internal. Wait, but the question is about coping mechanisms, so perhaps the answer is either C or I.

Wait, problem-focused coping (C) is about dealing with the problem by addressing its cause internally. Cognitive restructuring (I) is about changing your beliefs to better understand the problem, which also involves internal thought processes. So both could be applicable, but perhaps the question refers to problem-focused coping as the one relying on internal resources. Because problem-focused coping is about solving the problem by addressing its root cause, which relies on internal thinking, whereas cognitive restructuring is about adjusting your understanding, which might be internal.

Alternatively, I'm more confident that problem-focused coping is the correct answer. Because Problem-focused coping (C) is about dealing with the problem by focusing on its cause, using internal resources to resolve it. So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: Problem-focused coping. This strategy involves addressing the underlying cause of a problem internally, thereby relying on internal resources to solve the issue. Problem-focused coping is about focusing on the root cause, making it the most accurate choice.

Answer: C
