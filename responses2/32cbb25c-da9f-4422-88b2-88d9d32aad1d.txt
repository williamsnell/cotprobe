Question:

If XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room then

Options:

A: GDP increases because the painting is considered a luxury good.
B: GDP is unaffected because it is a second hand sale.
C: GDP is unaffected because the painting is considered a non-monetary asset.
D: GI)P decreases because I decreases.
E: GDP is unaffected because the painting is considered a depreciating asset.
F: GDP increases because it is considered an investment in art.
G: GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because C decreases.
H: GDP decreases because the painting is considered an unproductive asset.
I: GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because G decreases.
J: GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about GDP and assets. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about XYZ Corporation buying an original Matisse painting to hang in the board room. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that GDP measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given period. So, if XYZ buys a painting, does that affect GDP?

Well, the painting is an asset. When you buy an asset, like a painting, you're paying for its value. In some cases, like with goods, the buyer pays the market price. But for assets, it's a bit different. So, the value of an asset is usually recorded at its market value. So if the painting is sold for more than its original price, the buyer gets some profit. That profit is recorded in GDP because it's considered a transaction, even if it's an asset.

Wait, but wait. The question is about whether the purchase affects GDP. So, the purchase itself is a transaction. Whether you're buying a second-hand or original painting, the act of buying it counts as a GDP transaction. So XYZ's purchase adds to GDP because it's an explicit cost in the economy.

Wait, but wait again. No, I think I'm mixing up some concepts here. Let me think about this again. GDP is the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a specific period. So, when XYZ buys a painting, that's adding a new resource (the painting) into the economy. If the painting wasn't produced by XYZ before, then the cost is considered intermediate. But if it's a new painting, it's a new good, so it's considered final.

Wait, but Matisse is an old painting. So, the original painting might not have been produced by XYZ. So, if XYZ buys it, they're purchasing an asset. So, the purchase of an asset would contribute to the GDP because it's a transaction. So, XYZ's payment is a cost accounted for in GDP.

So, looking at the options:

Option B: GDP is unaffected because it's a second-hand sale. No, wait, if it's a second-hand sale, the value of the asset is already accounted for, so no gain or loss. But if it's a new painting, then XYZ bought it, so they're paying for something that's now in use. So the transaction adds to GDP, so B is incorrect.

Option F: GDP increases because it's considered an investment in art. Wait, no, because the purchase is just an explicit cost. The value of the painting is already in the market. When XYZ buys it, it's a cost, so it's added to GDP. So F is incorrect because it's not an investment; it's just the purchase of an asset.

Option J: GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases. Wait, I is GDP. So J is saying that the increase in the purchase (which is the price) causes GDP to increase by that amount. That makes sense because the purchase is an explicit cost, so XYZ's payment is a part of GDP. But if they had sold it, the value would have been different, but since it's bought, the GDP increases.

Wait, but wait. The question is about whether the purchase affects GDP. So, when XYZ buys the painting, the value of that purchase is an explicit cost. So, the amount paid is part of the GDP calculation because it's a transaction. So, yes, the purchase adds to GDP.

So looking at the options again, option J says, "GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases." Wait, I is GDP. So the purchase (which is I) increases GDP by that amount. So J is correct.

Wait, but what's the correct approach here? The purchase is an explicit cost, so XYZ's payment is a cost. So the GDP increases by the price paid. So yes, J is correct because the purchase (I) increases GDP by that amount.

Alternatively, looking at the other options: option F says GDP increases because the painting is an investment. But the painting is just bought as an asset, not necessarily being invested in. It's more about the cost of the asset.

So, putting it all together. The correct answer should be option J.
</think>

The correct answer is J: "GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases." When XYZ Corporation purchases an original Matisse painting, this transaction adds to the GDP because it is an explicit cost accounted for in the economy. The purchase, therefore, contributes to the overall value of goods and services produced within the country. 

Answer: J
