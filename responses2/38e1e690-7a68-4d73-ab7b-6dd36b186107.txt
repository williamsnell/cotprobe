Okay, so I've got this question about the binding energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state. Hmm, I remember that binding energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom, right? And for hydrogen, the ground state is the lowest energy level, which is the first energy level, n=1.

Wait, I think the binding energy for hydrogen in the ground state is a well-known value. Oh right, I think it's about 13.6 eV. Let me think why. Oh, because the energy levels in hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / nÂ². So when n is 1, E is -13.6 eV. But binding energy is the magnitude of that, so 13.6 eV. That's the ground state.

Looking at the options, option G is 13.6eV. So the correct answer should be G.

The binding energy of the hydrogen atom in its ground state corresponds to the energy required to remove the electron, which is the absolute value of the energy level at the first energy level (n=1). Using the formula for energy levels in hydrogen, \( E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2} \), the energy at \( n=1 \) is \( -13.6 \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the binding energy is \( 13.6 \, \text{eV} \).

The correct option is G: \( 13.6 \, \text{eV} \).

Answer: G
