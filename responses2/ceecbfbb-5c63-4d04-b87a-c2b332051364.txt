Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about how resources are allocated in the Soviet economy compared to a market economy. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the question is asking about how productive resources are allocated in the Soviet economy and how that differs from how they're allocated in a market economy. The options given are A through J, each presenting a different scenario.

I recall that in the Soviet Union, there was a central planning system. I think that means the government was in charge of allocating resources. Unlike the market economy, where resources are usually determined by supply and demand, the Soviet system probably uses some form of planning. I've heard terms like "central planning committee" or "social accounting offices" before. These are probably parts of the government that ensure resources are distributed in the best possible way for the country's needs.

Looking at the options, option H says: "A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy." That sounds about right. In the market economy, resources are typically determined by market forces like supply and demand, where prices guide where goods are produced and where they go. But in the Soviet system, the government has more authority, so they set the priorities and allocate resources based on plans and expert opinions.

Wait, what about option G? It says: "In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation." I don't think that's correct. I believe consumer votes are more like the system used in some countries, but not the central planning system. Also, market economy producers would dictate, but the government (or central committee) doesn't let producers decide alone. It's the government that makes the allocation decisions.

Another thought: option B says the government invests in sectors with high returns. That might be part of the central planning, but it's not the entire picture. The government doesn't just invest; they set the overall allocation based on their plans. Plus, the central committee isn't just investing but allocating all resources according to their plans.

Option C: "Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns." I'm not sure if Gosbank is a name I should associate with Soviet economies. Alternatively, maybe option C is mixing up terms. I think the correct term is central planning committee, not Gosbank.

Option E: Resources are distributed equally. That doesn't sound right because the Soviet system prioritizes certain sectors. It's not a fair or equal distribution; instead, it's based on planned priorities.

Option A: In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly. That doesn't make sense. Random allocation is usually a feature of competitive markets, not central planning.

Option D: Resources allocated by local governments versus international bodies. No, that's not how it works. The government in the Soviet Union (the central committee) has more authority than local governments. International bodies are more involved in market economies, especially in global markets.

Option F: Single body dictates allocation. That's more like the market economy. The market itself would determine allocation based on supply and demand, not a single central authority.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be H. The Soviet economy uses a central planning committee to allocate resources based on plans and expert opinions, while the market economy relies on market forces of supply and demand. So the difference is that in the Soviet system, the government has more control through central planning, whereas the market economy is driven by individual market interactions.

The correct answer is H: "A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy."

**Explanation:**
The Soviet economy utilized a central planning system, where a central committee was responsible for resource allocation based on predefined plans and expert opinions. In contrast, the market economy in the United States relies on supply and demand to determine resource allocation, with no single body dictating the allocation. This distinction highlights the contrast between centralized planning and decentralized market mechanisms.
