Okay, so I've got this question about Anscombe's views on Sidgwick's ethics. Hmm, I remember that both of them are associated with different school of thought in ethics, probably moral positivism. Let me think.

The question is about what's the badness of an action that's estimated in Sidgwick's view. The options are A to J. I think I need to recall what each person's stance is.

I remember that Sidgwick's ethics are more about the consequences of actions rather than the intentions. So he's more concerned with what would happen as a result of an action. On the other hand, Anscombe was part of the utilitarian tradition, which focuses on the value of actions, not their consequences.

So, Anscombe's approach was more about the potential benefits and the consequences. I think he emphasizes the moral value in terms of the benefits and the consequences. So, the badness of an action is estimated based on its potential benefits and the consequences it might have.

Looking at the options, D says "its potential for causing harm." That sounds right because that's about the benefits, which includes both good and bad. So the badness would be about the potential harm, not just the actual consequences.

Wait, but the question is about what's estimated in Sidgwick's view. Sidgwick's focus is on the consequences, so perhaps the badness is based on whether it violates divine law, or something else? Or wait, no. Sidgwick's view might be more about the consequences rather than the intentions. So Sidgwick would look at the outcomes, not necessarily the intentions.

Wait, no. Sidgwick's ethics are moral positivism, so they focus on consequences. He's concerned with the end of the action, not just the beginning. So, when evaluating an action, Sidgwick would consider what harm it would cause. So the badness is estimated based on whether it violates divine law, or any duties. Wait, no, because that's more about duties. Or does he look at the consequences?

Wait, Sidgwick's work is about the moral consequence of an action. His concept is that actions should be judged by their consequences, not their intentions. So when evaluating an action, you look at the outcomes. So the badness is based on whether it's harmful or not, and what the consequences would be.

But looking at the options, option D is about potential harm. That seems to fit because the badness is estimated based on whether it causes harm, not just the badness.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about what's estimated in Sidgwick's view. So Sidgwick's focus is on the consequences, so the badness is based on whether it's harmful.

Alternatively, maybe it's more about the actual consequences. So the badness is based on its potential for causing harm. That would align with option D.

Wait, no. Because potential harm might include both positive and negative aspects. So when you evaluate the badness, you look at how bad it would be, considering the potential consequences. So perhaps the badness is about the potential for harm, meaning whether it's bad in the long run.

Alternatively, maybe it's about its potential for causing harm, which is a broader consideration.

Wait, another angle: I've heard that Sidgwick's theory is more about the consequences, so the badness is assessed based on whether it's harmful or not. So the badness would be based on whether it violates divine law, but that's not an option here.

Looking at the options, option D is about potential harm, which would be part of the badness. Option F is about expected consequences, which is more about the actual outcome. Option H is potential benefits, which is similar.

Wait, I think I remember that in Sidgwick's ethics, the moral value is based on the consequences, not the intentions. So he would look at the end result, whether it's good or bad. So the badness is estimated based on whether it violates divine law or not. But none of the options directly say that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option D is potential for causing harm. So if someone does an action that could cause harm, the badness is estimated based on that potential harm. So that would make sense because it's about the consequences of the action.

Alternatively, maybe the badness is based on whether it violates any duties. Oh, but that's not one of the options. Option E is actor's intentions, which is part of Sidgwick's view because he looked at the consequences rather than the intentions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of what each option refers to.

Option A: whether it upholds social justice. Sidgwick is a proponent of social justice, but his view is about consequences, not about social justice itself.

Option B: whether it violates divine law. That's more related to religious ethics, not moral positivism.

Option C: whether it violates any duties. That's about duties, which isn't the focus of Sidgwick.

Option D: potential for causing harm. That's about the consequences, which is what I thought.

Option E: actor's intentions. Sidgwick looked at consequences, not intentions.

Option F: expected consequences. That's about what's going to happen, which is part of the expected consequences.

Option G: actual consequences. That's about the outcomes, including the actual harm.

Option H: potential benefits. That's similar to potential harm, just positive.

Option I: its alignment with personal values. That's about whether it's in line with personal values, more about personal ethics.

Option J: cultural norms. That's about external factors, not the internal consequences.

So, I think Sidgwick's ethics focus on the consequences. So the badness is estimated based on whether it causes harm, which is D. But wait, does that include potential for harm? Or does it consider the actual consequences?

Wait, Sidgwick's view is that the badness is the actual consequences. So the badness is based on the potential harm (i.e., the consequences), which would be option D.

Alternatively, I'm not sure. Wait, I think I might have gotten this wrong. Maybe it's about whether it violates any duties, but that's more about duties rather than consequences.

Alternatively, I've heard that in Sidgwick's view, the badness is based on the consequences, including the actual and potential harm.

Wait, another angle: I think I remember that Sidgwick's main focus is on the consequences, so he would evaluate actions based on their outcomes, whether they're good or bad. So the badness is the actual consequences, which would be option F or G.

Option F is expected consequences, which is about what's likely to happen, including potential harm. Option G is actual consequences, which are the results.

So, if the badness is estimated based on whether it causes harm, which would be the actual consequences, it's option G.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the badness is based on whether it violates any duties, which would be option I.

Wait, no. Because that's about duties, not the consequences.

Hmm. Another approach: the question is about what Sidgwick's view looks at. I think in his ethical theory, he focuses on the consequences. So the badness is based on the potential harm, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: I think that in Sidgwick's view, the badness of an action is determined by its consequences. So, the badness is based on whether it's harmful, and the potential for harm is part of that.

Wait, but the options don't have "potential harm" as an option. Option H is potential benefits, which is similar to potential harm but in the positive sense.

Wait, the question asks what is the badness estimated in Sidgwick's view. So the badness is the actual consequences. So it's about whether it's harmful, including the potential for harm.

Wait, but the options are:

A) social justice.

B) violates divine law.

C) violates any duties.

D) potential for causing harm.

E) actor's intentions.

F) expected consequences.

G) actual consequences.

H) potential benefits.

I) alignment with personal values.

J) cultural norms.

So, option G is "actual consequences." So the badness is estimated based on whether it's harmful, which includes potential harm. So the badness is based on the actual consequences, which is G.

But wait, does Sidgwick look at the actual consequences or the potential of the consequences? I think Sidgwick's view is that actions should be judged by their consequences, not by intentions. So when evaluating the badness, you look at the outcomes, not the actions.

Wait, but when you evaluate the consequences, you consider whether they're good or bad, and how bad they are. So the badness is part of the consequence's severity.

Alternatively, perhaps the badness is determined by the actual effects of the action. So, the badness is based on its actual consequences, which would be option G.

But earlier I thought option D might be correct because it refers to potential harm.

Wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Sidgwick's approach was more about the consequences. So, the badness is the actual consequences, which are the outcomes. So, the badness is based on whether it's harmful, which is about the consequences, including potential harm. So the badness is F (expected consequences) or G (actual consequences).

Wait, but Sidgwick's view is that the badness of an action is the actual consequences. He looks at the consequences, not the intentions. So if an action causes harm, it's bad, whether it's expected or not.

So, the badness is assessed based on whether it's harmful, which includes the actual consequences. That would be option G.

Wait, but wait. I think I'm getting something wrong. I'm now getting too confused. I need to find a better approach.

Another way: I remember that in Sidgwick's ethics, he focuses on the consequences, so the badness is the actual consequences, meaning option G.

But I'm not completely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the badness is based on the potential for harm, which is option D.

Wait, perhaps I can find it in my notes. I think I remember that in Sidgwick's view, the badness is the actual consequences. So, the consequences are what's being considered, including whether it's harmful.

So, the badness is estimated based on whether it's harmful, which is the actual consequences. So the answer is G.

Wait, but another thought: Sidgwick's view is that actions should be judged by their consequences. So, the badness is the actual consequences. So option G.

So, I think the correct answer is G: its actual consequences.
</think>

The question asks about the badness of an action estimated in Sidgwick's view. Sidgwick's ethics prioritize the consequences of actions, not their intentions. He focuses on the outcomes rather than the actions themselves. The options provided are analyzed as follows:

- **A, B, C, E, I, J**: These relate to duties, divine law, intentions, cultural norms, and personal values, which are not part of Sidgwick's approach.
- **D**: Potential for causing harm refers to the possibility of harm but does not encompass the actual consequences.
- **F**: Expected consequences focus on what is most likely to happen, including potential harm.
- **G**: Actual consequences directly refers to the outcomes of the action, which aligns with Sidgwick's focus on consequences.

Since Sidgwick evaluates actions based on their actual consequences, the correct answer is **G: its actual consequences**.
