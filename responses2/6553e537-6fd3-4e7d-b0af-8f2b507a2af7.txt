Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron moving in a magnetic field. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. Oh right, electrons have charge, so the direction matters. I think the right-hand rule might apply here.

The problem says the electron is moving upwards in the plane of the page with speed V into a magnetic field B that's directed into the page. Wait, wait, I need to clarify: the electron's charge is negative (-E?), but the magnetic field is into the page. Oh wait, the question says the charge is -E, but the magnetic field is B, which is into the plane. So the direction of the force on the electron will be opposite to what the right-hand rule would predict.

Right-hand rule for magnetic force: point your thumb in the direction of the magnetic field, then fingers in the direction of the velocity, and the palm gives the direction of force. But wait, wait, the electron's charge is negative, so the force would be opposite to what the right-hand rule says.

So the electron is moving upwards. Let's picture the velocity vector pointing upward. The magnetic field is into the page. So if I point my thumb into the page and my fingers into my palm, the force on a positive charge would be to the right. But since the electron is negative, the force is opposite. So the force would be to the left.

Wait, wait, the direction of the force is given by F = q(v × B). Since the electron has a negative charge, the force is opposite. So let's compute the direction.

v is upward, B is into the page. The cross product v × B: if v is along +y (up), B is along -z (assuming page is the xy-plane, then into page is -z). So y × (-z) is: y × (-z) = -(y × z). y × z is i (since y and z axes are perpendicular, right? Wait, no, the right-hand rule for vectors: i x j = k. So y is the middle (like j), z is the index (k). y × z = j × k = i (positive x). So v × B = (+y) × (-z) = - (y × z ) = -i. So the direction is negative x, so to the left.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Alternatively, for the electron's velocity, direction of the force is opposite of the right-hand rule. So if the right-hand rule gives a force to the right, the electron's force is to the left.

So the electron is moving upwards, and the magnetic field is into the page. So the force on it is to the left. That's the direction of the centripetal force, right? Because the electron is moving in a circular path, centripetal force is what provides the change in direction.

So the force is towards the left, which is the negative x-direction. Or wait, the force is to the left, so the electron is moving in a circle where the magnetic force provides the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, the centripetal force is m v² / r, and that's provided by the magnetic force. Let me write that down: F = m v² / r.

But what's the direction of F? As we found, it's to the left, which is opposite to the direction of the velocity (upwards). So the force is in the -x direction, but velocity is +y. So the direction of acceleration (which is centripetal) is towards the left.

Wait, but the force is the magnetic force, which is towards left. So the electron's charge is negative, so the direction of the force is opposite, which would be to the right. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The right-hand rule for a positive charge: thumb up, fingers into the page, force on positive charge is into the page. But since the electron is negative, the force is opposite, so to the right.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me restate: the right-hand rule for F. Velocity (v) is up. B is into the page. So v (up) is +y, B is -z. The cross product v × B is y × (-z) = -(y × z) = -(i) = -i. So the direction is -i, which is to the left. But since the charge is negative, F is opposite, so to the right.

Wait, no. Wait, the F is q(v × B). q is negative, so F = q (v × B) = (-E) (v × B). So if v × B is to the left (i.e., -i), then F is (-E)(-i) = E i, which is to the right.

So the force is to the right. The direction of the force is right, which is opposite to the velocity. So the electron is moving upward, but the force is to the right, causing it to curve to the right. So the direction of rotation would depend on the right-hand rule for the force direction and velocity direction.

Wait, I need to determine whether the electron is making a counterclockwise or clockwise rotation when viewed from above. Let me think about the direction of the force and the direction of the velocity.

The force is to the right, and velocity is upward. So, the direction of the force (right) is to the right, and the velocity is up. So using the right-hand rule for the direction of circular motion: thumb in the direction of velocity (up), fingers in the direction of the force (right), the palm points the direction of the circular path.

Wait, no, the right-hand rule is for the direction of the magnetic force on a positive charge. Wait, but for the circular motion, the direction is determined by the cross product of velocity and B. Because for a charged particle, the direction of the force is perpendicular to both v and B, and thus the particle moves in a circle whose plane is perpendicular to the direction of v × B.

So, if v is upward (y direction), B is into the page (-z direction). v × B is y × (-z) = - (y × z) = -(i) = -i. So the direction is to the left (negative x). But since the charge is negative, F direction is opposite, which is to the right (positive x).

So the force is in the positive x-direction (to the right), and velocity is in positive y. So the force is in +x, velocity is +y. So using the right-hand rule for the direction of circular motion: if F is in +x and v is +y, then the direction of rotation (using the right-hand rule) would be such that your thumb points along v (up), your fingers curl in the direction of the force (right?), but wait, no: the force is to the right (x+), velocity is upward (y+). The cross product v × B is in negative x (left) because the fingers would curl in the direction of F.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the right-hand rule for circular motion.

The direction of motion is given by the right-hand rule for the force on a positive charge. But for a negative charge, the direction is opposite.

Since the force on the electron is to the right (positive x), and the velocity is upward (positive y), the electron is moving in a circle where the centripetal force is to the right.

Wait, but the force is in the direction of the centripetal acceleration. So the acceleration is towards the right, which is the negative x direction. So the electron is moving in a circle with centripetal acceleration to the right.

So the electron's path is a circle where the acceleration is to the right, which is towards the center of the circle.

Wait, but the direction of centripetal acceleration is towards the center. Let me imagine the electron moving in a circle. The center of the circle is to the left of the point where it started, because the force is to the right.

Wait, no: if the electron is moving up and the force is to the right, then the center is to the left of the point of entry, right? Because the force is to the right, which would point to the right, so the center is on the left.

So the direction of the circular path is clockwise or counterclockwise when viewed from above?

Let me visualize. When the electron is moving up, and the force is to the right, the path is a circle that curves to the left. So when viewed from above, the path is clockwise.

Wait, perhaps another way: if the force is to the right, and the velocity is upward, the direction of the force is right, and the electron's velocity is up. So, using the right-hand rule, the electron would move in a counterclockwise circle when viewed from above. No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The right-hand rule for determining the direction of circular motion: if the fingers of the right hand are aligned with the velocity (fingers in the direction of velocity), and the palm faces the direction of the magnetic force, then the thumb points in the direction of the circular motion.

Wait, no. The right-hand rule for the direction of motion: if you point your thumb in the direction of the velocity, the direction of the force is given by the palm. So for a positive charge, the force would be towards the left (as we found). But since the electron is negative, the force is to the right, which is the direction of the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, maybe I should think about the direction of the force using the right-hand rule and see if it's a left or right turn.

Let me represent the velocity as upward (positive y) and force as to the right (positive x). So, the electron is moving in a circle where the force is to the right.

The direction of the circular motion can be determined using the right-hand rule for the force's direction. So, if I point my thumb in the positive y direction (velocity) and the palm faces the direction of the force (positive x), then the fingers point tangentially to the circle.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the standard right-hand rule for circular motion. The direction of the motion is given by the right-hand rule for the force on a positive charge. If the force is to the right, and the velocity is upward, then the electron's path would curve to the left. Because the force is to the right, which would make the electron curve in a circle that turns to the left.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the direction of the circular motion is determined by the cross product of velocity and B. Since v is up (y), and B is into the page (-z), the cross product v × B is y × (-z) = -(y × z) = -(i) = -i. So the direction is -i, which is to the left (negative x). So the direction of the force is to the left, which is opposite to the initial velocity direction (up). So the electron is moving in a circular path where the force is to the left. Hence, the direction of the velocity changes to the left.

Wait, but that would imply that the electron is moving in a circle where the force is to the left. But wait, from the earlier calculation, the force was to the right. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, earlier when I calculated with the right-hand rule, I thought the force was to the right, but the cross product suggested it's to the left. Which is correct? Let me re-examine.

The cross product of velocity (v) and B is v × B.

v is upward, i.e., +y.

B is into the page, which is -z.

So, y × (-z) = - (y × z ) = - ( i )= -i.

So the cross product is -i, which is to the left.

So the direction of the magnetic force on a positive charge would be to the left. But since the electron has a negative charge, the force is opposite, so to the right.

Ah, so the force is to the right. So the electron is moving in a circle where the force is to the right.

So, in that case, the direction of the force is right, and the velocity is up.

Thus, using the right-hand rule for the direction of the circular motion: if the fingers point in the direction of the velocity (up, +y), and the palm faces the direction of the force (right, +x), then the thumb points tangentially to the circle.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact direction. Let me think about the right-hand rule for the direction of rotation. The thumb points in the direction of the velocity (up), the palm faces the direction of the force (right), and the fingers point tangentially.

Wait, but the force is to the right, and the velocity is up. So the direction of the force is right, which is the direction the electron is being pushed.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the direction of the circular motion is determined by the right-hand rule for the force on a positive charge. So if the force is to the right, the electron's path would be a circle where it turns to the left.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron's path is such that it moves in a circle with a certain radius. Let's compute that.

The force on the electron is F = e * (v × B). Since B is into the page (-z), and v is up (+y). So v × B is (y × (-z)) = -(y × z) = -(i) = -i.

So F = e * (v × B) = e*( -i ) = -e i. So the force is -e i, which is to the left. But wait, wait. No, wait: F is q(v × B). q is -e. So F = (-e) * (v × B). So v × B is -i, so F = (-e) * (-i) )= e i. So the force is to the right.

So the force is to the right (positive x). The electron's acceleration is a = F/m = (e i) / m. Wait, no, because of the charge being negative. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, F = q (v × B). q is -e. So F = (-e) * (v × B). v × B is -i, so F = (-e) * (-i) = e i. So F is to the right (positive x).

Thus, the acceleration is a = F/m = (e/m) i. So the electron accelerates in the positive x direction. But since it's moving in a circle, the acceleration is centripetal, meaning it's directed towards the center of the circle.

Wait, but in this case, the force is in the positive x direction, which would mean that the electron's path is curving to the right. Hmm, but that depends on the specific setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about using the right-hand rule for the direction of the circular motion. The force on the electron is to the right, and the velocity is up. So if I point my thumb in the direction of the velocity (up), and the palm faces the direction of the force (right), then the fingers point tangentially to the circle. So, the direction of the circular path is such that the electron is moving in a circle where the velocity is up, and the force is to the right. That would mean the path curves to the left. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the right-hand rule for the direction of rotation.

The right-hand rule for circular motion: point your thumb in the direction of the velocity (up), your fingers in the direction of the force (right), which direction is the circular path? Because the force is the centripetal force, the electron would be moving in a circle such that the force (to the right) is towards the center of the circle.

Wait, if the electron is moving up, the force is to the right. The center of the circle must be to the left of the starting point. So the direction of the path is clockwise when viewed from above.

Wait, that makes sense: when the force is to the right, the path curves to the left. So when viewed from above, the electron is moving in a clockwise circle.

So the electron's path is a circle in the plane of the page, clockwise when viewed from above.

Now, let's look at the options. The options are about the radius of the path.

The centripetal force is provided by the magnetic force: F = m v² / r. We have F = e * (v × B) / m ?

Wait, wait. Let me compute F. F is e times (v × B). Let's compute v × B.

v is upward, which is +y. B is into the page, which is -z. So y × (-z) = -(y × z) = -(i) = -i.

So v × B = -i. So F = e * (-i) = -e i. But since F is the magnitude, the magnitude of the force is e times the magnitude of (v × B). So F = e v B, because the magnitude of (v × B) is v B sin(theta), theta being 90 degrees, so sin(theta)=1. So F = e v B.

So, F = e v B.

But the force is equal to m a, where a = v² / r.

So e v B = m (v² / r).

Solving for r: r = (m v )/(e B).

Wait, wait. Because F = m a → e v B = m (v² / r) → r = (m v )/(e B).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says radius is mv/(eB), and the electron is moving clockwise. So that matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought the radius would be mv/(eB). So option D is correct.

Wait, but another way: the force is e v B (since the charge is negative, the force is opposite of the direction we calculated). Oh wait, wait a minute. The force calculation:

F = q (v × B).

q is -e.

v is +y.

B is -z.

v × B is y × (-z) = -(y × z) = -i.

So F = (-e) * (-i) = e i.

So F is to the right, which is positive x. So F = e B v.

So, F = m (v² / r) → e B v = m v² / r → r = (m v )/(e B).

So the radius is mv/(eB), which matches option D. And the direction of rotation is clockwise, as viewed from above.

So the correct option is D.

The problem involves an electron moving upward in the plane of the page with a velocity \( V \), under the influence of a magnetic field \( B \) directed into the page. The goal is to determine the direction of the circular motion and the radius of the electron's path.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Direction of the Magnetic Force**:
   - The force on the electron is given by \( F = q (v \times B) \), where \( q = -e \), \( v \) is upward (+y), and \( B \) is into the page (-z).
   - The cross product \( v \times B \) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     v \times B = (+y) \times (-z) = -(y \times z) = -(i) = -i.
     \]
   - Thus, \( v \times B = -i \), meaning the force is to the left (positive x-direction).

2. **Circular Motion Direction**:
   - Since the electron is moving upward (+y) and the magnetic force is to the left (-i), the circular motion is clockwise when viewed from above.

3. **Radius of the Circular Path**:
   - The magnetic force provides the centripetal force for the circular motion. The relationship between these forces is:
     \[
     F = \frac{m v^2}{r}.
     \]
   - Substituting the magnetic force \( F = e v B \) (since the charge is negative, the force is opposite to the direction of \( v \times B \)):
     \[
     e v B = \frac{m v^2}{r}.
     \]
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     r = \frac{m v}{e B}.
     \]

4. **Matching Options**:
   - The radius of the circular path is \( r = \frac{m v}{e B} \).
   - The direction of rotation is clockwise when viewed from above.

5. **Correct Option**:
   - Option D states: "The radius of the circular path is \( \frac{m v}{e B} \), and the electron is rotating clockwise when viewed from above."

Thus, the correct answer is:
