Question:

The ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene, while its recessive allele fails to confer this ability. If 16 percent of the students in a school cannot roll their tongues, what percentage of students are heterozygous?

Options:

A: 36 percent
B: 32 percent
C: 24 percent
D: 40 percent
E: 20 percent
F: 48 percent
G: 68 percent
H: 16 percent
I: 64 percent
J: 52 percent

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about tongue rolling ability and the frequency of heterozygotes in a school.

The setup says that students can roll their tongue, and this ability is determined by a dominant gene. The recessive allele doesn't let them do it. So, the students who can't roll their tongue are the ones who have the recessive allele, right?

The question says that 16% of the students can't roll their tongue. Wait, so that must mean they're homozygous recessive because the dominant allele is needed to roll the tongue. So, if someone can't roll their tongue, they must have two recessive alleles, like aa.

I remember that for these kinds of problems, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation. The equation is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. Since q² equals the frequency of homozygous recessive (the ones who can't roll), q² is 16%, so q is the square root of 16%, which is 40% (0.4).

Wait, because sqrt(0.16) is 0.4. So q is 0.4. Then p, the dominant allele frequency, is 1 - q. So p would be 0.6.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele. The formula for the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq.

So let's plug in the numbers. p is 0.6 and q is 0.4. So 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals... 0.48, which is 48%. That would be the percentage of heterozygotes.

Wait, but wait, I should make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let me think again. So the students who can't roll their tongue are aa (q² = 16%). The percentage of aa is 16%, which is q². So q is 40% as I thought.

Then the frequency of Aa (heterozygotes) is 2pq. Because each of the dominant alleles comes from a heterozygote. So 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48% of the students.

Looking at the options, option F is 48 percent. So the answer should be F.

To determine the percentage of students who are heterozygous, we use the Hardy-Weinberg equation. The recessive allele (q) has a frequency such that q² = 16% (the students who cannot roll their tongue). Calculating q: 

\[
q = \sqrt{0.16} = 0.4
\]

The dominant allele frequency (p) is:

\[
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6
\]

The frequency of heterozygotes (Aa) is given by 2pq:

\[
2pq = 2 \times 0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.48
\]

Thus, 48% of the students are heterozygous. 

Answer: F: 48 percent
