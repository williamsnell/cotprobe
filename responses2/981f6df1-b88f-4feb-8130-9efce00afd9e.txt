Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says: An eastbound car travels a distance of 40 meters in 5 seconds. I need to find the speed of the car. The options are given from A to J, with various numerical values.

Wait, speed is the rate at which something moves, right? So speed equals distance divided by time. Oh, yeah, that's the formula. So I'll need to plug in the numbers. The distance is 40 meters, and the time is 5 seconds. So I'm calculating 40 divided by 5.

Let me do that math. 40 divided by 5 is 8. So the speed is 8 meters per second. Let me check the options. Option H is 8 m/s. So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Did I get the formula right? Oh yes, speed is distance over time. So yeah, 40/5 is definitely 8 m/s. The car is moving eastbound, but that doesn't affect the calculation for speed. It just tells us the direction, but speed is a scalar quantity, so it doesn't depend on direction.

So looking at the options, I'm pretty confident that H is the correct answer. No other option matches 8 m/s. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So I'll go with option H.

The correct answer is H: 8 m/s.
