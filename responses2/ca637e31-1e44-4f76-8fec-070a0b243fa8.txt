Okay, so I need to find the volume of this solid S. The base is an elliptical region with boundary curve 9x² + 4y² = 36. The cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are isosceles right triangles with the hypotenuse in the base.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should probably figure out the equation of the ellipse. The given equation is 9x² + 4y² = 36. I think I should rewrite this in standard form. So, dividing both sides by 36 gives (x²)/4 + (y²)/9 = 1. That simplifies to (x²)/(2²) + (y²)/(3²) = 1. So, the ellipse has semi-major axis 3 along the y-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the x-axis.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the standard form for an ellipse is (x²)/(a²) + (y²)/(b²) = 1, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor. But in this case, since 9x² +4y² =36, when I divide both sides by 36, it's (x²)/4 + (y²)/9 =1. So, a²=4, so a=2, and b²=9, so b=3. So, the major axis is along the y-axis because the denominator under y² is larger. So, the ellipse is longer along the y-axis, stretching from y=-3 to y=3, and along the x-axis from x=-2 to x=2.

Now, the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis. So, they are vertical slices. Each slice is an isosceles right triangle with the hypotenuse lying on the ellipse.

Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis, I'll integrate along the x-axis. For each x, the cross-section is a triangle whose base is along the ellipse's boundary. Wait, no. The hypotenuse is on the base, which is the ellipse. So, the hypotenuse is a line segment on the ellipse. But for the cross-section, the triangle is attached to the base, and the hypotenuse is along the base.

An isosceles right triangle has legs of equal length, and the hypotenuse is the longest side. The hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So, for each x, the triangle's hypotenuse is a segment on the ellipse.

Wait, maybe I should think about the shape. The ellipse is given by 9x² +4y²=36. So, if I solve for y in terms of x, I can get the upper and lower boundaries of the ellipse for each x.

Let me solve for y:

4y² = 36 -9x²  
y² = (36 -9x²)/4  
y = ±√[(36 -9x²)/4]  
y = ±(√(36 -9x²))/2  
Simplify the square root: √(9*(4 -x²))=3√(4 -x²)  
So, y = ±(3√(4 -x²))/2

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 36 -9x² is 9*(4 -x²), so sqrt(9*(4-x²)) is 3*sqrt(4-x²). So, y = ±3*sqrt(4 -x²)/2. So, the ellipse is symmetric about both axes.

So, for each x, the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse along the ellipse. Wait, but the hypotenuse is on the base, which is the ellipse itself, so the hypotenuse is a line segment on the ellipse.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse in the base. So, the hypotenuse is part of the ellipse's boundary, and the triangle is attached such that the hypotenuse is on the base.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: for each x, the base is the ellipse, so the hypotenuse is a line segment along the ellipse. But the cross-section is perpendicular to the x-axis, so it's a vertical slice. So, each cross-section is a triangle whose base is the chord of the ellipse at that x, and the hypotenuse is that chord. Wait, but the triangle is isosceles and right-angled. So, the hypotenuse is the base of the triangle, but wait, in that case, the triangle would be a right triangle with the hypotenuse on the ellipse.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is sitting on top of the ellipse. Wait, no, the problem says the hypotenuse is in the base, so the hypotenuse is on the boundary of the base, which is the ellipse. So, the triangle's hypotenuse is a line segment on the ellipse.

But wait, for a triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. So, for an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg*sqrt(2). So, if I can find the length of the hypotenuse, I can find the area of the triangle, and then integrate that along the x-axis.

So, for each x, I need to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is the length of the chord on the ellipse at that x. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg*sqrt(2). 

Wait, but the hypotenuse is the base of the triangle, right? So, the base of the triangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. So, the length of the hypotenuse is the length of the base on the ellipse.

So, perhaps the area of each cross-section is (1/2)*base^2, since in an isosceles right triangle, area is (1/2)*a², where a is the length of the legs.

Wait, but if the hypotenuse is the base, then let me make sure. Let me think: in an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, say length 'a'. Then hypotenuse is a*sqrt(2). So, if the hypotenuse is the base of the triangle, then the base is a*sqrt(2). No, wait, no, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, so in this case, the hypotenuse is the longest side, so the legs are the other two sides.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. Let's consider the triangle as such: the hypotenuse is the base on the ellipse, and the two legs extend from the endpoints of the hypotenuse to form the right angle. No, wait, no, if the hypotenuse is the base, then the two legs are the other sides, and they meet at a right angle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the hypotenuse is the base, so the base is the length of the hypotenuse, and the area would be (1/2)*base*(height), but in this case, the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, so the height would be equal to the base divided by sqrt(2).

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering that the hypotenuse is the base on the ellipse. So, for each x, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between the two points on the ellipse at that x. But wait, the ellipse is a curve, so for each x, there are two points on the ellipse (one positive y and one negative y). So, the chord length would be the distance between these two points.

Let me think, the ellipse equation is y = ±(3√(4-x²))/2. So, for a given x, the two points are (x, 3√(4-x²)/2) and (x, -3√(4-x²)/2). So, the distance between these two points is 2*(3√(4-x²)/2) = 3√(4 -x²).

So, the length of the hypotenuse at each x is 3√(4 -x²).

But in the problem, the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse in the base. So, the hypotenuse is 3√(4 -x²), and the area of the triangle would be (1/2)*leg², but since it's an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg*sqrt(2). So, if hypotenuse is 3√(4 -x²), then leg = hypotenuse / sqrt(2) = (3√(4 -x²))/sqrt(2).

Therefore, the area of each cross-section is (1/2)*(leg)^2 = (1/2)*[(3√(4 -x²))/sqrt(2)]².

Let me compute that:

= (1/2)* [ (9*(4 -x²)) / 2 ] = (1/2)*(9*(4 -x²)/2) = (9*(4 -x²))/4.

So, the area A(x) is (9*(4 -x²))/4.

Then, the volume is the integral of A(x) dx from x = -2 to x = 2, because the ellipse goes from x = -2 to x = 2.

Wait, but wait, the ellipse equation was 9x² +4y²=36, which we rewrote as (x²)/4 + (y²)/9 =1. So, the semi-minor axis is 2 along the x-axis, so x ranges from -2 to 2.

So, the volume V is the integral from x=-2 to x=2 of (9*(4 -x²))/4 dx.

Let me compute that.

First, factor out the constants:

V = (9/4) * ∫ from -2 to 2 of (4 -x²) dx.

Since the function (4 -x²) is even, meaning f(-x) = f(x), we can compute the integral from 0 to 2 and multiply by 2.

So, V = (9/4) * 2 * ∫ from 0 to 2 of (4 -x²) dx.

Compute the integral:

∫ (4 -x²) dx from 0 to 2 is [4x - (x^3)/3] from 0 to 2.

At x=2: 4*(2) - (8)/3 = 8 - 8/3 = 16/3.

At x=0: 0 -0=0.

So, the integral is 16/3.

Therefore, V = (9/4)*2*(16/3) = (9/4)*(32/3) = (9*32)/(4*3).

Simplify:

32/4 is 8, so 9*8=72, over 3: 72/3=24.

Wait, that gives V=24, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Did I compute the area correctly?

Wait, earlier I thought that the area of the triangle is (1/2)*leg^2, but in an isosceles right triangle, the area is (1/2)*a², where a is the length of each leg.

But according to the problem, the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse in the base. So, in that case, if the hypotenuse is length h, then each leg is h / sqrt(2). So, the area would be (1/2)*(h / sqrt(2))² = (1/2)*(h² / 2) = h² /4.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if h is the hypotenuse, then area is h² /4.

But earlier, I computed the area as (1/2)*(leg)^2, which is correct because for an isosceles right triangle, area is (base * height)/2, and since both are equal, it's (a*a)/2 = a²/2. But since a = h / sqrt(2), substituting gives (h² / 2)/2 = h² /4.

So, yes, correct.

So, the area A(x) is h² /4, where h is the hypotenuse, which is 3√(4 -x²).

So, A(x) = [ (3√(4 -x²) ) ]² /4 = (9*(4 -x²))/4, which matches my earlier calculation.

So, integrating this from x=-2 to x=2.

Alternatively, if I consider the integral of (9*(4 -x²))/4 from x=-2 to x=2.

Which is (9/4) * integral from -2 to 2 of (4 -x²) dx.

As I did before, this becomes (9/4)*2 * integral from 0 to 2 of (4 -x²) dx.

Which is (9/4)*2*(16/3) = (9/4)*(32/3) = 24.

So, volume is 24, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have confused the area formula.

Wait, another approach: for each x, the base of the triangle is the chord length, which is 2*(3√(4 -x²)/2) = 3√(4 -x²). So, the base is 3√(4 -x²). Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the area is (base * height)/2, but wait, no, in an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the area is (leg^2)/2. Alternatively, using base and height, since the two legs are equal, the height is equal to leg length.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Let me think: for an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2). So, if the hypotenuse is h, legs are h / sqrt(2). So, the area is (h / sqrt(2)) * (h / sqrt(2)) * (1/2) = (h² / 2) * (1/2) = h² /4. So, yes, correct.

So, given that, the area is h² /4, where h is the hypotenuse, which is 3√(4 -x²). So, plugging in, area is (9*(4 -x²))/4. So, integrating that from -2 to 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me compute the integral step by step.

Compute ∫ (4 -x²) dx from -2 to 2.

The integral of 4 dx from -2 to 2 is 4*(2 - (-2)) = 4*4 = 16.

The integral of x² dx from -2 to 2 is 2*∫ x² dx from 0 to 2 (since it's even function).

∫ x² dx from 0 to 2 is [ (x^3)/3 ] from 0 to 2 = 8/3 - 0 = 8/3.

So, 2*(8/3) = 16/3.

So, ∫ (4 -x²) dx from -2 to 2 is 16 - 16/3 = (48/3 -16/3) = 32/3.

So, the integral is 32/3.

Multiply by (9/4): (9/4)*(32/3) = (9*32)/(4*3) = (288)/(12) = 24.

Yes, so the volume is 24, which is option D.

To find the volume of the solid \( S \), we start by analyzing the given information. The base is an ellipse with the equation \( 9x^2 + 4y^2 = 36 \), which simplifies to \( \frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1 \). This represents an ellipse with semi-major axis 3 along the y-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the x-axis. The cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are isosceles right triangles with hypotenuse lying on the ellipse.

For each \( x \), the hypotenuse of the triangle is the chord length of the ellipse at that \( x \). The ellipse's equation gives \( y = \pm \frac{3\sqrt{4 - x^2}}{2} \), so the chord length is \( 3\sqrt{4 - x^2} \). Since the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles, the area of each triangle is \( \frac{(3\sqrt{4 - x^2})^2}{4} = \frac{9(4 - x^2)}{4} \).

The volume \( V \) is the integral of the area from \( x = -2 \) to \( x = 2 \):
\[
V = \int_{-2}^{2} \frac{9(4 - x^2)}{4} dx.
\]
Using symmetry, this simplifies to:
\[
V = \frac{9}{4} \times 2 \int_{0}^{2} (4 - x^2) dx.
\]
Evaluating the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{2} (4 - x^2) dx = \left[4x - \frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2 = \frac{32}{3}.
\]
Thus:
\[
V = \frac{9}{4} \times 2 \times \frac{32}{3} = 24.
\]
