Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a 0.2 M solution of formic acid. I remember formic acid is a weak acid, so I can't just assume it completely dissociates in water. The question gives me the acid dissociation constant, Ka, which is 1.76 × 10^-4. 

Wait, right, for weak acids, the formula we use is the approximation where x is much smaller than the initial concentration. But wait, sometimes that's not the case. So I should set up the equation properly. The dissociation reaction for formic acid (HCOOH) is HCOOH ⇌ H+ + HCOO^-.

The initial concentration of HCOOH is 0.2 M, and both H+ and HCOO^- start at 0. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of HCOOH will be 0.2 - x, H+ is x, and HCOO^- is x. 

The Ka expression is (x^2) / (0.2 - x) = 1.76e-4. Since Ka isn't that small, I can't assume x is negligible. Hmm, but wait, sometimes if x is small, like a few parts per million, then the approximation holds. Let me check if 0.2 * Ka is less than 5% of 0.2. 

0.2 * 1.76e-4 is about 3.52e-5. 5% of 0.2 is 0.01. 3.5e-5 is much less than 0.01, so the approximation should be okay. So I can proceed with x^2/(0.2) = 1.76e-4. Solving for x, x = sqrt(0.2 * 1.76e-4) = sqrt(3.52e-5) ≈ 0.00593 M. So pH is -log(0.00593). Let me calculate that. Log(0.00593) is about log(5.93e-3) = log(5.93) + log(1e-3) ≈ 0.77 + (-3) = -2.23. But since it's negative log, pH is 2.23. 

Wait, but when I do that calculation, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can do the quadratic equation properly. Let's try that.

The equation is x² = (1.76e-4)(0.2 - x). Expanding: x² = 3.52e-5 - 1.76e-4 x. Bringing everything to one side: x² + 1.76e-4 x - 3.52e-5 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a). Here a=1, b=1.76e-4, c= -3.52e-5. 

Discriminant D = (1.76e-4)^2 + 4*(1)*(3.52e-5) = (3.0976e-8) + (1.408e-4) ≈ 1.4081e-4. The square root is sqrt(1.4081e-4) ≈ 0.01187. So x = [-1.76e-4 ± 0.01187]/2. We can ignore the negative root because x can't be negative. So x ≈ (0.01187 - 1.76e-4)/2 ≈ (0.011694)/2 ≈ 0.005847. So x≈0.00585 M. So [H+] is 0.00585. pH is -log(0.00585). Let me compute that. Log(0.00585) is log(5.85e-3) → log(5.85)=0.767, so total is 0.767 -3 → -2.233. pH is 2.233, which rounds to 2.23. So the pH is approximately 2.23. 

So looking at the options, option B is 2.23. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the pH of a 0.2 M solution of formic acid (HCOOH) with a given \( K_a = 1.76 \times 10^{-4} \), we start by recognizing that formic acid is a weak acid. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{HCOOH} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{HCOO}^-
\]

Let the equilibrium concentration of \(\text{H}^+\) and \(\text{HCOO}^-\) be \( x \). At equilibrium, the concentration of formic acid is \( 0.2 - x \). The \( K_a \) expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.2 - x}
\]

Since \( K_a \) is relatively small, the approximation \( x \ll 0.2 \) is valid. Substituting \( x^2 / 0.2 = K_a \) gives:

\[
x^2 = (1.76 \times 10^{-4})(0.2) = 3.52 \times 10^{-5}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{3.52 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 0.00593 \, \text{M}
\]

The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log(x) = -\log(0.00593)
\]

Using logarithmic properties:

\[
\text{pH} = -( \log(5.93 \times 10^{-3}) ) = -( \log(5.93) + \log(10^{-3}) ) \approx -(0.77 + (-3)) = 2.23
\]

To verify, the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 1.76 \times 10^{-4}x - 3.52 \times 10^{-5} = 0 \) is solved using the quadratic formula. The discriminant is:

\[
D = (1.76 \times 10^{-4})^2 + 4(1)(3.52 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.408 \times 10^{-4}
\]

\[
\sqrt{D} \approx 0.01187
\]

\[
x = \frac{-1.76 \times 10^{-4} + 0.01187}{2} \approx 0.00585 \, \text{M}
\]

This confirms \( x \approx 0.00585 \, \text{M} \), leading to the same pH of approximately 2.23. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:
