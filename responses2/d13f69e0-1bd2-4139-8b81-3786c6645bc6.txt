Okay, so I've got this question about convex polygons and dividing them into triangles. Hmm, I remember something about this from geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think it through.

The question is asking how many ways a convex octagon (8 sides) can be divided into triangles using non-intersecting lines connecting its vertices. Oh right, I think this is related to something called Catalan numbers. Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics, including this problem.

Wait, what's the formula for Catalan numbers? I think it's something like Cn = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). But wait, is that for the nth Catalan number? Let me check. Oh right, for a convex (n+2)-gon, the number of ways to triangulate it is the nth Catalan number. So for an octagon, which has 8 sides, n would be 6 because (n+2) =8. So n=6. 

So the formula would be C6 = (1/(6+1)) * (2*6 choose 6) = (1/7) * (12C6). Let me compute that. 12 choose 6 is (12!)/(6!6!) = (12*11*10*9*8*7)/(6*5*4*3*2*1) = let's see, numerator is 665280, denominator 720. 665280 /720 is 924. So 924 divided by 7 is 132. So the 6th Catalan number is 132. Wait, but wait, the options are given. Let me check.

Looking at the options: A:140, B:90, C:80, D:160, E:150, F:120, G:100, H:200, I:110, J:132.

So J is 132, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be J:132.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the formula right? Because sometimes I mix up the index. Catalan numbers are usually Cn for n pairs of parentheses, or for triangulating a polygon with n+2 sides. So for a triangle (3 sides), n=1, C1=1, which is correct. For a quadrilateral (4 sides), n=2, C2=2. So yes, for an octagon, which is n+2=8, n=6. So C6=132. So the correct option is J:132.

The problem involves finding the number of ways a convex octagon can be divided into triangles without intersecting lines. This is a classic problem solved using Catalan numbers. For an n-sided polygon, the number of triangulations is the (n-2)th Catalan number. For an octagon, n=8, so we need the 6th Catalan number (C6). The formula for the nth Catalan number is Cn = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). Calculating C6 gives 132, which matches option J.

Answer: J:132
