Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear transformations and the change in atomic number. Let's see what I remember. I know that alpha particles and beta particles are types of radiation emitted during nuclear reactions.

The question says an element emits 1 alpha particle, and then its products emit 2 beta particles in succession. I need to figure out how the atomic number changes.

Wait, wait. Let me think step by step. The process involves alpha decay. An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So when an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That affects the atomic number because protons are what the atomic number represents.

So, the initial element has an atomic number Z. After emitting an alpha, the new atomic number would be Z minus 2. Because the protons decrease by 2. So the product after alpha emission has Z-2.

Then, the products emit 2 beta particles. Beta particles are electrons. So when a beta particle is emitted, it means a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton, releasing an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino. So each beta emission increases the atomic number by 1.

Wait, wait a second. Let me clarify. Beta particles are electrons. So each beta decay converts a neutron into a proton. So for each beta decay, the atomic number increases by 1. Because the number of protons increases by 1 (a neutron becomes a proton).

So the process is: first, alpha emission, then two beta emissions.

So initial Z: Z.

After alpha: Z-2.

Then, two beta emissions: each adds 1, so 2 more. So Z-2 + 2 = Z.

Wait, so the final atomic number is the same as the initial. So the change is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in the question, it says the element emits 1 alpha, then the products emit 2 beta particles in succession.

So the first step: atom A emits alpha → becomes atom A'. Then atom A' emits beta → becomes atom A''.

Each alpha decay reduces the atomic number by 2. Each beta decay increases it by 1. So two betas would add 2.

So for the first step: Z becomes Z-2.

Then, adding 2 (from two betas): Z-2 + 2 = Z.

So the resulting element has the same atomic number as the original. Therefore, the change is zero.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, beta emission: when a nucleus emits a beta particle, it's a conversion of a neutron into a proton. So the atomic number increases by 1 each time. So two beta emissions mean +2.

Alpha is −2.

So 2 beta → +2, and alpha → -2. So total change is 0.

So the atomic number doesn't change. So the answer would be G: does not change.

The process involves two steps: the emission of one alpha particle and two beta particles. An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so the emission of an alpha particle decreases the atomic number by 2. Subsequently, each beta particle emission increases the atomic number by 1. Since two beta particles are emitted, this increases the atomic number by 2.

The net change in the atomic number is calculated as follows:
- After emitting one alpha particle: \( Z \to Z - 2 \).
- After emitting two beta particles: \( Z - 2 \to (Z - 2) + 2 = Z \).

Thus, the final atomic number is the same as the initial atomic number. Therefore, there is no change in the atomic number.
