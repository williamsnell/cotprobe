Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this economics question about the short-run contractionary monetary policy. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that monetary policy refers to changes in the money supply or interest rates. A contractionary policy would reduce the money supply or increase interest rates. Since it's the short run, it's a bit different from long-term policies because factors like sticky prices and wages matter.

So, the question is about how a contractionary monetary policy affects aggregate demand. Aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy. It's made up of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. In the short run, this includes factors like prices and wages, which can adjust or not.

A contractionary policy would lower the money supply. When the economy is in equilibrium, the AD curve is drawn such that it intersects the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve at the equilibrium point. So, lowering the money supply would shift the AD curve to the left, meaning at every price level, the quantity of goods and services demanded is lower.

Wait, but what happens to prices and output? If AD decreases, it could cause both output and prices to drop because the economy is in equilibrium. For example, if people have less money, they might spend less, leading to lower consumption. Investment might also decrease because businesses have less capital. So, both AD and the short-run equilibrium shifts to the left. This leads to lower output and lower prices. So, output decreases and price level decreases. 

Looking at the options, let's see which ones match this. The question provides two blanks: first, output and price level. Let me check the options:

Option A: Decreases, Decreases. No, that can't be right because price level should decrease, not stay same.
Option B: Increase, decrease. No, both should decrease.
Option C: Increase, increase. No, that's not right.
Option D: Decrease, Decrease. Wait, but the price level should decrease, so no.
Wait, wait, no: the question says 'the price level to' but I think it's about output and price level each. Let me look again.

Wait, the question says: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen. The options are:

The question is: "In the short run contractionary monetary policy causes aggregate demand to output to and the price level to...".

So the two blanks are: output to [something], price level to [something else].

So the first blank is about output. The second is about the price level.

So the options are:

A: Decreases, Decreases

No, because price level should decrease, not stay same.

B: Increases, decreases. No, both should decrease.

C: Increases, increases. No.

D: Decreases, decreases. Output decreases, price level decreases. That would make sense for a contractionary policy.

Wait, but let me double-check. The initial state is equilibrium, AD is at a certain point. A contractionary policy (like reducing money supply) causes AD to shift left. So the new AD is lower. As a result, at each price level, the quantity of goods and services demanded is less. So the economy's output (AGGREGATE output) would decrease because there's more empty space in the aggregate supply (like less capacity). Prices would also fall because the demand isn't enough to push them up.

So output decreases, price level decreases.

Looking at the options, the first blank is output. The options for output are D: Decreases, and others. The second blank is price level. So, which option matches output decreases and price level decreases? Let's see.

Option D says: Decreases for output, Decreases for price level. That's correct.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me think again. If the AD curve shifts left, in the short run, the economy might not adjust as much as in the long run. So in the short run, perhaps the price level might not decrease as much as in the long run, but in the short run, we're talking about the immediate effect.

Oh, but the question is about the short run. So the short run doesn't allow for full adjustment. So in the short run, a contractionary policy leads to lower output and lower prices. So the correct answer is D: Decreases, Decreases.

Wait, but looking at the options again, I see that option D is indeed: Decreases, Decreases.

Wait, but I thought sometimes in the short run, the price level might stabilize if output decreases. But no, in most models, the short run leads to a decrease in both.

So the correct answer should be option D.

The correct answer is D: Decreases, Decreases. A contractionary monetary policy reduces aggregate demand by lowering the money supply or increasing interest rates. At every price level, the quantity of goods and services demanded decreases, leading to a decrease in both output and the price level in the short run.

Answer: D
