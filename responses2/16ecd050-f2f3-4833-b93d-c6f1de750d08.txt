Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Mr. Williams is entitled to in dividends. Let me read the question again.

He owns 75 shares of Mid-Atlantic common stock that pay a dividend of $0.35 per share. And he also owns 135 shares of its 5% $50 par-value preferred stock. I need to calculate the total dividends he receives.

Hmm, so there are two types of stock: preferred and common. Each has its own dividend rate. For common stock, the dividend is usually on a per share basis, but for preferred, it's often a fixed rate regardless of the number of shares, unless specified otherwise.

Wait, the common stock's dividend rate is given as $0.35 per share. So that's straightforward. For the preferred stock, it's a 5% dividend rate on a $50 par value. So I need to calculate that.

First, let's compute the preferred stock's dividend. Preferred stock's dividend is based on its par value and the dividend rate. The formula is: Dividend per share = (Dividend Rate) * (Par Value). So 5% of $50 is 0.05 * 50 = $2.50 per share. He owns 135 shares, so total preferred dividend is 135 * $2.50.

Wait, let me calculate that. 135 * 2.50. Let me break it down: 100 * 2.50 is $250, 35 * 2.50 is $87.50. Adding them together gives 250 + 87.50 = $337.50.

Now the common stock. He has 75 shares, each paying $0.35. So 75 * 0.35. Hmm, 70 * 0.35 is 24.50, and 5 * 0.35 is 1.75. So 24.50 + 1.75 = $26.25.

So total dividends he receives are the sum of preferred and common. That's $337.50 + $26.25 = $363.75.

Looking at the options, option H is $363.75. So I think the answer is H.

To determine Mr. Williams' total dividend income, calculate the preferred and common stock dividends separately:

1. **Preferred Stock Dividend:**
   - Dividend rate: 5% of $50 par value = $2.50 per share.
   - Number of shares: 135.
   - Total preferred dividend: 135 * $2.50 = $337.50.

2. **Common Stock Dividend:**
   - Dividend per share: $0.35.
   - Number of shares: 75.
   - Total common dividend: 75 * $0.35 = $26.25.

3. **Total Dividends:**
   - Sum of preferred and common: $337.50 + $26.25 = $363.75.

The correct answer is **H: $363.75**.

Answer: H
