Question:

A 35-year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her body mass index was 23 kg/m2 before surgery, and, except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. The patient remains unable to eat 6 days after surgery. Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient?

Options:

A: oral protein-rich diet
B: feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube
C: feeding through a jejunostomy tube
D: central hyperalimentation
E: intravenous saline solution
F: peripheral hyperalimentation
G: oral carbohydrate-rich diet
H: feeding through a gastrostomy tube
I: oral fat-free modular diet
J: intravenous dextrose solution

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this nutrition question about a patient who had a cholecystectomy. Let me read through it again.

The patient is a 35-year-old female who developed nausea and vomiting after undergoing a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her BMI was 23 kg/m² before the surgery, and except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. She can't eat for 6 days after surgery.

So the question is asking which form of nutritional support is most appropriate. The options are A to J, each with different dietary or feeding methods.

I remember that cholecystectomy is the removal of the gallbladder. Protracted ileus is when the ileum takes a long time to pass, which is often caused by gallstones or infections. So the patient must have had an infection that led to the cholecystectomy.

After a cholecystectomy, what happens? I think the body generally stops absorbing bile and goes straight to the stomach. But since the patient was able to eat for 6 days, it suggests that the stomach is still absorbing some bile. So she might be on a diet that includes some bile, but not enough to fully get rid of it. 

When the stomach can't absorb all bile, there's a need for additional support. I recall that the esophagus needs support too. The esophagus takes bile and converts it into acid, which helps with acid reflux. So the patient probably needs to eat through the esophagus or a tube.

Option B is feeding through a nasogastric tube. Option H is feeding through a gastrostomy tube. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The esophagus is the first part after the stomach. So if the esophagus can't handle enough acid, you feed through the esophagus, which is the nasogastric. But when it's overwhelmed, both the esophagus and stomach are fed through. So the esophagus is fed through, which is a nasogastric tube. So option B is correct? Or is it the gastrostomy tube?

Wait, another thought: the esophagus can't handle enough acid. So you'd need to feed through the esophagus, which is a nasogastric tube. If the esophagus is overwhelmed, one tube can handle the stomach, but perhaps the esophagus is fed through a tube that connects to the stomach. Alternatively, maybe the esophagus is fed through a tube, but that's the esophagus itself. So in this case, the esophagus was overwhelmed, so the patient ate through the esophagus, which is done via a nasogastric tube. So option B is correct.

Wait, no, sometimes when the esophagus is overwhelmed, you can use a gastrostomy tube, which connects to the stomach and allows both the esophagus and stomach to be fed through. But the patient in this case couldn't eat at all because she couldn't manage the acid. So she had to eat through the esophagus, which requires a nasogastric tube. So option B is correct.

Looking at the options, option B is feeding through a nasogastric tube. So that's probably the right choice.

Alternatively, another option is option H (gastrostomy tube), which I think is a tube that feeds both the esophagus and the stomach. But I think the main way to handle the esophagus is through a nasogastric tube. For handling the stomach, sometimes you use a gastrostomy tube, but the question is about the esophagus.

So the patient's situation is that the esophagus is overwhelmed. So the best form of support would be feeding through a nasogastric tube. So option B.
</think>

The patient, a 35-year-old female with protracted ileus and cholecystectomy, experienced nausea and vomiting. Her condition suggests that the stomach was able to absorb some bile, but the esophagus was overwhelmed, necessitating additional support. The appropriate form of nutrition in this case involves feeding both the esophagus and the stomach through a single tube. The correct method is to feed through a nasogastric tube, which bypasses the esophagus and directly delivers bile to the stomach. 

**Answer: B**
