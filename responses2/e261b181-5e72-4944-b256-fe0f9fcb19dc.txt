Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the change in enthalpy (ΔH°) for the reaction where gaseous hydrochloric acid dissociates into water. The reaction is written as HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). They've given me the heats of formation for each of these species, which I think are the standard molar enthalpies of formation.

Heats of formation provided:
- HCl(g) has a ΔHf° of -87.54 Btu/mol.
- H⁺(aq) has a ΔHf° of 0 Btu/mol.
- Cl⁻(aq) has a ΔHf° of -158.8 Btu/mol.

My task is to find ΔH°_77°F for this reaction. Wait, wait, the notation here is a bit unclear. The subscript 77°F might mean something else. Oh wait, I think that's just a typo in the problem. Usually, the symbol °F would be the temperature, but since they're talking about the heat of reaction, which is a state function (doesn't depend on path), maybe it's a typo and they just want the standard change in enthalpy, which is ΔH°, regardless of temperature. Because ΔH° for a reaction is generally expressed at standard conditions (usually 25°C, which is 298 K, and 1 atm pressure), and it's in units of Btu per mole.

So I can proceed under the assumption that they're asking for the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction, which is the sum of the enthalpies of the products minus the reactants.

Wait, but the reaction is written as HCl → H+ + Cl-.

So the formula for ΔH° for the reaction is:

ΔH°_rxn = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)

Let me write that out.

The products are H+ and Cl⁻. So their ΔHf° are 0 and -158.8 respectively.

The reactant is HCl, which has a ΔHf° of -87.54.

So,

ΔH°_rxn = [ (0) + (-158.8) ] - [ (-87.54) ]

Because the reactant's ΔHf is subtracted.

Let me calculate that.

First part: products sum is 0 + (-158.8) = -158.8.

Reactants sum is -87.54.

So,

ΔH°_rxn = (-158.8) - (-87.54) = (-158.8) + 87.54.

Let me compute that: 158.8 minus 87.54 is... Hmm.

158.8 minus 80 is 78.8, minus 7.54 is 71.26. But since 158.8 is larger than 87.54, the result is positive.

Wait, (-158.8) + 87.54 = -(158.8-87.54) = -71.26.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Because 87.54 is less than 158.8. So 158.8 - 87.54 = 71.26 (since 87.54 +71.26 = 158.8). So 87.54 is less than 158.8, so 158.8-87.54 is 71.26, and since it's 158.8 minus 87.54, but the initial calculation was (-158.8) +87.54, which is - (158.8 -87.54) = -71.26.

Wait, but wait, that's the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute.

Wait, 158.8 - 87.54 is 71.26. So 158.8 = 87.54 +71.26.

So (-158.8) +87.54 = -71.26.

So the ΔH°_rxn is -71.26 Btu/mol.

Looking at the options, option E is -71.26 Btu. Option H is -71.26 Btu.

Wait, but wait, another way to think: the products are H+ and Cl⁻. The standard enthalpy of formation for HCl is -87.54, meaning that when HCl is formed, it releases 87.54 Btu. But in the reaction, HCl is a reactant, so it's being consumed. So the reaction is like HCl breaking down, so the enthalpy of the reaction would be the opposite of the formation of HCl. That's why the calculation ends up being negative.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is HCl(g) → H+ + Cl-.

The ΔH° for the reaction would be the sum of the products' ΔHf minus the sum of the reactants' ΔHf.

So:

ΔH° = (0 + (-158.8)) – (-87.54) = (-158.8) +87.54 = -71.26.

So the correct ΔH° is -71.26 Btu.

Looking at the options, option H is -71.26 Btu.

Wait, but wait, the question says 'using the following heats of formation, calculate ΔH°_77°F for the reaction.' Oh, the subscript 77°F might be a typo, as I thought earlier. So the answer is -71.26 Btu. So the correct option is H.

To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \sum \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

### Given Data:
- ΔHf°(HCl(g)) = -87.54 Btu/mol
- ΔHf°(H⁺(aq)) = 0 Btu/mol
- ΔHf°(Cl⁻(aq)) = -158.8 Btu/mol

### Calculation:
The reaction involves HCl(g) decomposing into H⁺(aq) and Cl⁻(aq). The enthalpy change for the reaction is calculated as:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \left[ \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{H⁺}) + \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{Cl⁻}) \right] - \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{HCl})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \left[ 0 + (-158.8) \right] - (-87.54)
\]

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = -158.8 + 87.54
\]

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = -71.26 \, \text{Btu/mol}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (-87.54 Btu):** Incorrect. This corresponds to the ΔHf° of HCl, not the enthalpy change of the reaction.
- **Option B (-87.54 Btu):** Incorrect. This is the same as Option A and does not represent the correct calculation.
- **Option C (0 Btu):** Incorrect. This would imply no reaction occurs, which is not the case.
- **Option D (158.8 Btu):** Incorrect. This is the ΔHf° of HCl, not the reaction enthalpy.
- **Option E (-71.26 Btu):** Correct. This matches the calculated value of ΔH°_rxn.
- **Option F (-158.8 Btu):** Incorrect. This corresponds to the ΔHf° of Cl⁻, not the reaction.
- **Option G (246.34 Btu):** Incorrect. This is unrelated to the calculation.
- **Option H (-71.26 Btu):** Correct. This matches the calculated value of ΔH°_rxn.
- **Option I (-246.34 Btu):** Incorrect. This is unrelated to the calculation.
- **Option J (-175.34 Btu):** Incorrect. This is unrelated to the calculation.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **H (-71.26 Btu)**.
