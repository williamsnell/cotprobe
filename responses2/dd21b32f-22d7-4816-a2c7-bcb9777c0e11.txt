Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me see. The question is about work done when dragging a mass. Hmm, I remember that work is force times distance, but wait, there are other factors involved, especially friction. Right, because when you drag something, friction is acting against the motion, so the actual work done would be less than the simple F*d.

So the problem states: a mass of 150 kg is dragged 10 meters, coefficient of sliding friction is 0.30. I need to find the work done. Oh wait, the formula for work done against friction is force of friction multiplied by the distance.

Right, frictional force is μ (mu) times the normal force. And the normal force is equal to the weight of the object, which is mass times gravity. So F_friction = μ * m * g.

Then, work done by friction is F_friction multiplied by the distance. But wait, since friction is acting opposite to the direction of motion, the work done by friction is negative. But when the question asks for the work done, I think they just want the magnitude, or maybe they consider the total work done on the mass, including overcoming friction. Oh wait, the question is about the work done when dragging the mass. So it could be the net work, but I think in such problems, they usually consider work done against friction, which is what I should calculate.

Wait, the problem is asking "How much work is done", but I'm not sure if it's the net work or just the work done against friction. Let me think. Dragging a mass against friction would mean the work done is the work done against friction. Because the other forces (like tension or whatever you're applying) aren't mentioned, perhaps we assume that the only force doing work is friction. Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because you have to apply a force to drag it. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify the force applied. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait the problem probably expects the work done by friction, which is the force times distance, but the question is about the work done when dragging the mass, which could be the work done by all forces. But maybe in this context, the term 'work done' refers to the work done against friction, since that's the primary force opposing the motion.

So let me proceed. Let's compute the frictional force first.

Friction F = μ * m * g. So μ is 0.30, m is 150 kg, g is 9.8 m/s². So F = 0.30 * 150 *9.8. Let me calculate that.

0.3 times 150 is 45. 45 times 9.8 is about 441 N. So that's the frictional force.

Then, work done by friction is F * d, where d is 10 meters.

So W = 441 N * 10 m = 4410 joules. Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 4410 joules. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the work done by friction the same as the work done against it? Yes, because the frictional force is opposing the motion, so the work done by friction (which is negative) is indeed 4410 J. But wait, the question is asking how much work is done. Since work done by friction is negative, but the problem may be considering the total work, including the movement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the net work, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the work done is the net work, which would be the applied force minus friction. But since the applied force isn't given, this approach might not be correct. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify any other forces except friction. Wait, perhaps the question is only about the work done against friction, so 4410 J is the correct answer. Looking back at the options, option I is 4410 J. So that's the choice.

To determine the work done when dragging a mass of 150 kg over a distance of 10 meters with a coefficient of sliding friction (μ) of 0.30, we first calculate the frictional force. The frictional force is given by:

\[
F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \cdot m \cdot g
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
F_{\text{friction}} = 0.30 \cdot 150 \cdot 9.8 = 441 \, \text{N}
\]

The work done against friction is then:

\[
W = F_{\text{friction}} \cdot d
\]

Where \( d = 10 \, \text{m} \):

\[
W = 441 \cdot 10 = 4410 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the work done when dragging the mass is **4410 joules**, which corresponds to option **I**.
