Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically about how different policies can affect an economy. The question is about which policies will close an inflationary gap. Hmm, I remember that an inflationary gap occurs when the economy's actual output is less than its potential output, leading to an increase in inflation. To close this gap, the economy needs to stimulate growth, maybe through increased demand.

The options are A to H, each giving a series of policies. I need to figure out which combination of policies will close the inflationary gap. Let me think about what each policy does.

First, I should recall the theories related to fiscal policy and monetary policy. I remember that both can influence the economy, but their effects can be different.

Monetary policy involves changes in the money supply, like increasing or decreasing it. If the central bank increases the money supply, it can stimulate the economy, especially if the economy is a recession. This can lead to higher demand, which might push up prices and reduce the inflationary gap.

On the other hand, fiscal policy involves changes in government spending or taxation. If the government increases its spending or decreases taxes, that can increase aggregate demand. For example, increasing government spending directly adds to total demand. Decreasing taxes allows people and businesses to save more, which can also increase demand.

Now, I think that in an inflationary gap, the economy is producing less than potential output. To close this, the economy needs to stimulate demand, which can be done through either a contractionary fiscal policy or a contractionary monetary policy. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Inflationary gaps occur when the economy is too low, so to close the gap, you can either increase demand (which would contract the economy) or reduce demand (which would stimulate). But the question is about policies that will close the inflationary gap, so perhaps it's about stimulating demand.

Wait, let me think again. An inflationary gap is a situation where the economy's output is below its potential, which causes higher prices. So to close this, the economy needs to increase demand beyond its current level. So, policies that stimulate demand would help. So which policies do that?

Monetary policy: If the central bank increases the money supply (which can be done through expansionary policies), that can lead to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive, which might reduce spending. But that's the opposite of what I thought before. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait no, another approach: to close an inflationary gap, you want to increase demand. So, either fiscal or monetary policies that encourage more spending or investment.

Monetary policy (like expansionary, increasing the money supply, or increasing the money multiplier) can stimulate the economy. But if the central bank increases the money supply, it can lead to lower interest rates. Lower rates can encourage borrowing and investment, which would stimulate the economy, thereby opening up the gap.

Alternatively, a contractionary monetary policy (like decreasing the money supply) can lead to higher interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. This can dampen spending, which might reduce demand, thereby closing the gap.

Wait, but in this question, the options are about which policies will close the gap. So, the question is about policies that will close the inflationary gap. So, for example, if the economy is at low output, and the central bank increases the money supply (expansionary), this can increase demand, which would reduce the gap. Or, if the central bank's monetary policy is contractionary (like decreasing the money supply), that can reduce demand, which would close the gap.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Increase money supply; decrease taxes; increase government spending.

Wait, if the central bank increases the money supply, that could be an expansionary policy. Then, decreasing taxes would increase disposable income, leading to higher consumption. Increased government spending would also directly add to GDP. So, both of these would promote more demand, perhaps helping to close the gap.

Option E: Decrease the money supply; decrease taxes; increase government spending.

Decreasing money supply could be a contractionary policy, which would lower interest rates, making borrowing cheaper. Decreasing taxes would increase disposable income, so more spending. Increasing government spending would add to output. So both of these could lead to increased demand.

Wait, the question is which policies will close the inflationary gap. How do these policies do that?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider the effect of each policy on the economy. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Increase money supply (expansionary), decrease taxes (increase consumption), increase government spending (add to GDP). So total effect: higher money, higher taxes, higher spending. All of which can increase demand. So the economy would be stimulate. That would likely close the inflationary gap.

Option E: Decrease money supply (contractionary), decrease taxes, increase spending. So money supply is lower, so that could lead to lower interest rates. Lower rates can encourage spending. Decreasing taxes: more disposable income, more spending. Increased spending: more money added to the economy. So all three policies would contribute to higher demand, which would close the gap.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The question is which option contains policies that will close the inflationary gap.

An inflationary gap can be closed by either increasing demand or decreasing demand. So if a policy increases demand, it would close the gap. If it's a contractionary policy that reduces demand, it would close the gap.

Wait, but in which cases will each option do that?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the options list E as: decrease money supply; decrease taxes; increase government spending. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: in the context of the money demand and output.

The inflationary gap is when actual output is below potential. To close that, the economy needs to move towards potential output. So, either increase demand ( stimula tion) or reduce demand (contraction). So, which of the options do that.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Decrease the money supply (that's a contractionary monetary policy). Decreasing taxes usually leads to a contractionary fiscal policy. Wait, no, decreasing taxes can be a contractionary policy if the economy is below full employment, but in this case, the question is about closing the gap, so probably the right way is to increase demand.

Wait, let's think about each policy's effect on the economy.

Option E: Decrease money supply (so people have less money to spend, which could be a contractionary policy). Decreasing taxes would lead to more disposable income, which can increase consumption and businesses' willingness to invest. Increasing government spending can directly increase GDP. So the combination would stimulate demand, leading to a closing of the gap.

Wait, that makes sense. So Option E would increase demand, which closes the gap.

But wait, another way: the question is about which policies will close the gap. So the correct answer would be one which increases demand.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the options list E as: decrease money supply; decrease taxes; increase government spending. Let me think.

Wait, but let me think about the term 'closing' the gap. The inflationary gap is when actual output is below potential. So to close it, the economy needs to reach potential output, which can happen by increasing demand (expansionary) or decreasing demand (contractionary).

So, which policies contribute to increasing demand? Let's see each option.

Option A: Increase money supply (expansionary); decrease taxes (increase demand); increase government spending (increase demand). So all three contribute to demand, so closing the gap.

Option E: Decrease money supply (contractionary); decrease taxes (so less tax, more disposable income, increase demand); increase government spending (more money added). So all three contribute to demand, which would close the gap.

Option B: Maintain money supply; decrease taxes; increase spending. So money supply is same, taxes decrease, spending increases. So the demand is higher, so closing.

Option C: Decrease money supply; run a budget deficit. That means government spending is higher than taxes. So net demand for goods and services is higher, so closing.

Option D: Increase money supply; increase taxes; reduce spending. So money supply up, taxes up (so less disposable income, less spending), spending down (so less). So net demand would be lower, which would open up the gap. So not closing.

Option F: Increase money supply; run a surplus. That would mean government spending is higher than taxes. So net demand is up, closing.

Option G: Decrease money supply; increase taxes; reduce spending. So money is reduced, taxes up (so less disposable), spending down. So net demand is lower, which opens up the gap. So doesn't close.

Option H: Increase money supply; run a surplus. So money up, spending up (since surplus means spending more than tax). Net demand is up, closing.

Wait, so all options except D and B, F, H, G, and others have policies that can stimulate demand, closing the gap.

Wait, but looking back, the question is which list contains policies that will close the inflationary gap. So for each option, which ones do that.

Option E: Decrease money supply (contractionary, reduces demand); decrease taxes (contractionary, increases demand? Or is that just a normal policy that increases demand.) Wait, no: decrease taxes increases disposable income, so increase spending. Increase government spending is an increase in demand.

Wait, so E's policies all increase demand. So the combination would lead to increased demand, closing the gap.

Wait, but in that case, option E would close the gap. So the correct option would be E.

Wait, but I thought that when the money supply is decreased (option E's first part is decrease money supply), it's a contractionary policy (so perhaps that reduces demand). So if that's the case, then E's policies would reduce demand, which would not close the gap.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about what each policy does:

In the context of the Phillips curve, an inflationary gap is a situation where the economy is below its potential output, leading to higher inflation. To close this, the economy must move towards potential output. So the policies should encourage more demand.

Monetary policies that are expansionary (increase money supply) or increase the money multiplier will increase demand. So policies that are expansionary (increase money supply) or increase tax rates would be contractionary.

Wait, but in this case, the options are different combinations.

Looking back at the question: the options are about which policies will close the inflationary gap. So the correct answer would be a list of policies that increase demand.

So, for example:

Decreasing taxes (contractionary) would reduce disposable income, decreasing consumption, possibly reducing demand. So that would not help close the gap. So if a policy causes demand to decrease, it won't close the gap.

Wait, no. Wait, if taxes are decreased, people have more disposable income, so they'll spend more. So that's increasing demand.

Wait, so let me reevaluate each option.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of a different approach. Let's think about what happens in each scenario.

The correct strategy to close an inflationary gap is to increase demand. So the policies should promote expansion.

Which options promote expansion?

Option A: Increase money supply (expansionary), decrease taxes (increase spending), increase spending. So all three are expansionary, leading to higher demand.

Option E: Decrease money supply (contractionary), decrease taxes (increase demand), increase spending. So all three promote expansion.

Wait, but that would mean options A and E both promote expansion, so both could close the gap.

Wait, but the question is which option is correct. So the correct answer is either A or E.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is: decrease money supply; decrease taxes; increase government spending.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option's effect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it includes the combination of decreasing money supply, which can lead to contraction, but also the combination of decreasing taxes and increasing spending. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: in the context of the money demand curve. At a given interest rate, if the money supply increases, demand increases. So if the central bank increases the money supply (option A), that would increase demand. So that would help close the gap.

Option E: Decreasing money supply (so people have less money to spend, which could be a contractionary policy, which reduces demand). So E's first policy is a contractionary one, which would reduce demand.

But the rest of the options in E: decreasing taxes (increasing demand) and increasing spending (increasing demand). So if that's the case, E's policies would increase demand, which would close the gap.

Wait, but option E's first policy is a contractionary one, but the later policies are expansionary.

Hmm. So the question is: which policies will "close" the gap. So which policies will increase demand.

So, if any of the options have policies that increase demand, they would.

Looking back at option E: all three policies increase demand. So option E would close the gap.

Wait, but another thought: the central bank's policy could be a contractionary one, but if the economy is in an over-demand situation, the central bank might respond by reducing the money supply to prevent inflation.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the answer as E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E. Because the combination of decreasing taxes (increase demand) and increasing government spending (increase demand) would help close the gap.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of each option:

Option A: All three policies are expansionary. So they increase demand. So option A would close the gap.

Option E: Decrease money supply (contractionary, which reduces demand) but other policies increase demand. So the net effect would be a mix of contraction and expansion. Let me think: if the money supply is decreased, that's a contractionary policy which would reduce demand. But if taxes are decreased, that's a contractionary as well? Or is it a positive? Wait, no: decreasing taxes reduces the tax burden, so more people can spend. So that's expansionary.

Wait, no. Wait, decreasing taxes would mean less tax, so more disposable income. So that would increase consumption and investment, leading to more demand.

So in option E, the first policy is a contractionary (decrease money supply), which might reduce demand. The second and third policies are expansionary. So net effect: some demand, some not. But the question is whether the combination as a whole will close the gap.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it includes some contractionary and some expansionary policies, but the overall effect is positive.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is E. Because the options list E as: decrease money supply; decrease taxes; increase government spending. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: in the context of the money demand curve. At a given interest rate, if the money supply increases, demand increases. So expansionary policy (like option A) would increase demand.

In option E, the first policy is a contractionary (decrease money supply), so demand might decrease. But the other two policies are expansionary. So the net effect would depend on the balance between the two.

But the question is about the list containing policies that will close the inflationary gap. So the list should be the combination of policies that increase demand.

So which of the options have policies that increase demand.

Looking back:

Option A: All three policies increase demand.

Option E: First policy is a contractionary, but the others are expansionary. So how does that affect? Well, maybe the net effect is expansionary, but perhaps the combination is that the overall demand is increasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the other options either have policies that reduce demand or don't add up.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it includes some contractionary and some expansionary policies, but the overall effect is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: the combination of decreasing taxes (which increases demand), and increasing government spending (which also increases demand). So both being expansionary, so the combination would increase demand.

Hmm, I'm not entirely certain, but I think the correct answer is option E.
</think>

To determine which policies will close an inflationary gap, it is important to identify the combination of policies that increase demand, as this will help stimulate the economy and reduce the gap between potential output and actual output. An inflationary gap occurs when actual output is below potential output, leading to higher inflation. To close this gap, the economy must stimulate demand, which can be achieved through expansionary or contractionary policies.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Increase the money supply (expansionary).  
   - Decrease taxes (increase disposable income, which increases consumption and investment).  
   - Increase government spending (directly adds to GDP).  
   All three policies promote expansionary demand, which would close the gap.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Maintain the money supply (contractionary).  
   - Decrease taxes (increase disposable income, which increases consumption and investment).  
   - Increase government spending (directly adds to GDP).  
   The first policy is contractionary, which reduces demand, so this option does not close the gap.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Decrease the money supply (contractionary).  
   - Run a budget deficit (increasing government spending, as it is more than taxes).  
   - Increase government spending (directly adds to GDP).  
   The first policy is contractionary, which reduces demand, so this option does not close the gap.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Increase the money supply (expansionary).  
   - Increase taxes (reduces disposable income, which decreases consumption and investment).  
   - Reduce government spending (directly reduces GDP).  
   This combination reduces demand, so it does not close the gap.

5. **Option E**:  
   - Decrease the money supply (contractionary).  
   - Decrease taxes (increase disposable income, which increases consumption and investment).  
   - Increase government spending (directly adds to GDP).  
   While the first policy is contractionary, the other two policies (decreasing taxes and increasing government spending) promote expansionary demand. The combination as a whole may increase overall demand, potentially closing the gap.

6. **Option F**:  
   - Increase the money supply (expansionary).  
   - Run a federal budget surplus (increasing GDP).  
   Both policies promote expansionary demand, so this option closes the gap.

7. **Option G**:  
   - Decrease the money supply (contractionary).  
   - Increase taxes (reduces disposable income, which decreases consumption and investment).  
   - Reduce government spending (directly reduces GDP).  
   This combination reduces demand, so it does not close the gap.

8. **Option H**:  
   - Increase the money supply (expansionary).  
   - Run a surplus (increasing GDP).  
   Both policies promote expansionary demand, so this option closes the gap.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option E**, as it includes a combination of policies that promote expansionary demand. While the first policy (decreasing the money supply) is contractionary, the other two policies (decreasing taxes and increasing government spending) are expansionary and work together to increase demand, thereby closing the inflationary gap.
