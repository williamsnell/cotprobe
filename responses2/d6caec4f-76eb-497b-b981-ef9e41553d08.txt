Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many spikes are on the Statue of Liberty's crown. I remember that the Statue of Liberty has several key features, including the crown, arms, and maybe some other parts. Let me think step by step.

First, I recall that the crown is a central part of the statue. The crown is made up of a series of small, decorative stones. I think there are several stones around the crown. I remember that the crown has more than just a few stones. I think it's been modified over time. There was a time when the crown was just the main stone, but now it's been changed to have more, more intricate stones.

Wait, I think the original crown had maybe three stones around the top. Then over time, they added more. I think it's been updated several times. Let me try to remember. Oh, right! The original crown had three stones around it, but each year, they add more. So, the current crown has 13. I'm pretty sure that's right because I've heard the statue being updated every few years, adding more stones. 

So, the question is asking specifically about the number of spikes on the crown. Spikes, in this context, are the small stones around the crown. I remember that each year, they add a few more. For example, I think the crown was updated in 2000, adding a few stones. So, if it's been updated 13 times, that would mean 13 stones. 

Let me double-check. If the original had three and each update adds two, then 3 + 2*13=29, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, perhaps each update adds one or two. Alternatively, maybe the current number is 13. I'm pretty confident that the number is thirteen. So the answer should be E: thirteen.
