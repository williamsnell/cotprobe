D: 9 and 3 over 5
E: 3 and 3 over 4

Okay, so I have this equation here: (5/8) * m = 6. I need to find the value of m. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this step by step.

First, I remember that to solve for m, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The current equation is (5/8) multiplied by m equals 6. So, the fraction 5/8 is being multiplied by m. To get rid of that fraction, I should multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 5/8. The reciprocal of 5/8 is 8/5.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. The reciprocal flips the numerator and denominator, so yes, 5/8 becomes 8/5.

So, if I multiply both sides by 8/5, that should cancel out the 5/8 on the left side. Let's write that out:

(5/8) * m * (8/5) = 6 * (8/5)

On the left side, the 5's and 8's should cancel each other out. So, m remains, right? Because (5/8) * (8/5) is 1. So, m = 6 * (8/5).

Now, I need to calculate 6 multiplied by 8/5. Let me think about how to do that. Alternatively, it's the same as 6 divided by 5 multiplied by 8, right? Or perhaps I can convert 6 into a fraction over 5. Wait, perhaps it's easier to just multiply 6 by 8 first, then divide by 5.

So, 6 * 8 is 48. Then, 48 divided by 5. Let's see, 5 goes into 48 nine times because 5 * 9 is 45, and that leaves a remainder of 3. So, 48/5 is 9 and 3/5. Oh wait, because 5 * 9 is 45, so 48-45=3, so it's 9 and 3/5. So, m equals 9 and 3/5.

Looking at the options, let me check which one matches that. The options are A to J. Let's list them:

A: 5 and 1/3 → Hmm, no, that's 5.333... which doesn't match 9.333.

B: 6 and 1/2 → That's 6.5, no.

C: 7 and 1/2 → 7.5, nope.

D: 9 and 3/5 → Wait, 3/5 is 0.6, so 9 + 0.6 is 9.6. That's 9 and 3/5. So yes, D is 9 and 3/5. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should verify my calculation. Let me double-check. 5/8 multiplied by m equals 6. So m is 6 divided by 5/8. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 6 * (8/5) is 48/5, which equals 9.6, or 9 and 3/5. So yes, D is correct.

To solve for \( m \) in the equation \( \frac{5}{8} \times m = 6 \), we first multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{5}{8} \), which is \( \frac{8}{5} \).

This gives:
\[ m = 6 \times \frac{8}{5} \]

Calculating \( 6 \times \frac{8}{5} \) yields \( \frac{48}{5} \), which is equal to \( 9 \frac{3}{5} \).

Looking at the options, the correct answer is D: \( 9 \) and \( \frac{3}{5} \).

Answer: D
