Okay, so I've got this question about the principle of comparative advantage and whether it's only applicable to international trade. Hmm. Let me think through this.

I remember that the principle of comparative advantage was introduced by David Ricardo. He talked about how countries can benefit from specializing in what they're good at and trading with others. So, it's more about opportunity cost and comparative advantage than just consumer choice in the market.

Wait, the question is asking if it's only for international trade. So, does it apply elsewhere? Like, could it apply to domestic trade? Or just between countries?

I think the key here is that comparative advantage applies to any exchange where two parties have different productive efficiencies. So even within a country, if one good is more efficient to produce than another, the country should specialize in the one with the lower opportunity cost.

Oh, right! For example, a country can choose to produce either good A or B. If producing A uses fewer resources than producing B, it might have a comparative advantage in A. Then, it trades with another country that's better at producing B. This can lead to mutual gains for both.

So, the principle applies to exchange of goods, not just services. It doesn't necessarily require barter. It can be used in any economic exchange as long as each party has a comparative advantage.

Looking back at the options, option B says it's only applicable to the exchange of services, not goods. Wait, that's not right. Because the principle allows for any goods, right? Like, a country could produce both cars and trucks, and still have a comparative advantage in one.

Option D says it applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies. That sounds correct. Because the principle is about who is more efficient in producing which good. So even within a country, or even in the same country, it's applicable.

Who is right? So the answer should be either B or D. Let me think again.

The principle of comparative advantage is not limited to international trade. It's a general principle that applies to any exchange where two parties have different productive efficiencies. So, it applies to both goods and services, and it can occur within a country.

So option B is about exchange of services only. That's incorrect. The principle is more general.

Option D says it applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies. That fits because the principle compares the opportunity costs (which depends on relative efficiencies) of producing goods.

Wait, let me check the options again:

A: No, it's only consumer choice in the market – no, because it's a broader principle.

B: No, only services – no.

C: Yes, trade between neighboring countries – no, it's more general.

D: No, any exchange with differing relative efficiencies – yes, that's correct.

E: No, only international trade – no, it's not limited to that.

Wait, the options are: the question is, does the principle apply only to international trade?

So the correct answer is that it's not limited to international trade. So the answer is D.

Wait, but another thought: the principle is about any two parties. So it could be between domestic industries, not just international trade. So the principle's applicability is broader.

So the correct answer is D: No, it applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies.

The principle of comparative advantage applies to any exchange where two parties have differing productive efficiencies. It allows for mutual gains through specialization and trading, applicable to goods and services, not just international trade. Among the options, the correct answer is D: No, it applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies.

Answer: D
