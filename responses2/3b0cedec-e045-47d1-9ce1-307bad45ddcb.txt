Okay, so I have this question about calculating the total floor space of an office building. The given floor space is 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10 square feet. I need to find the number in standard form. Hmm, wait, I think I should first add those numbers up to get the total.

Let me break it down. 300,000 is a big number, then 5,000 is a bit more, then 600, and 10 is the smallest. So adding them together: 300,000 plus 5,000 is 305,000. Then add 600 to get 305,600. Finally, add 10 to make it 305,610. So the total is 305,610 square feet. 

Now, looking at the options: I think the options are all different numbers, but I need to see which one matches 305,610. Let me check the options again. Option G is 305,61, but that looks like it's missing the comma. Wait, no, I think the commas are part of the standard form. Wait, no, wait. Let me check. Wait, the question says the answer must be in standard form, which I think is when it's written with commas as thousand separators. So 305,610 would be 305 thousand six hundred ten. Looking at the options, option G is 305,61, which is probably a typo because it's missing the comma. Let me look again.

Wait, all the options are written as numbers without commas. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the options again. Wait, the question says "What is the number of square feet of floor space written in standard form?" So in standard form, each comma separates every three digits starting from the right. So 305,610 would be written with a comma after the first three digits from the right. So 305,610 is correct. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 3,561 → That's three thousand five hundred sixty-one.
B: 30,561,000 → thirty, five hundred sixty-one thousand.
C: 30,561 → thirty, five hundred sixty-one.
D: 35,610,000 → thirty-five million, six hundred ten thousand.
E: 3,056,100 → three million, five hundred sixty-one hundred.
F: 300,561 → three hundred thousand, five hundred sixty-one.
G: 305,61 → thirty, five hundred sixty-one.
H: 305,610 → thirty, five hundred sixty-one, but wait, that's what I calculated.
I: 35,610 → thirty-five thousand, six hundred ten.

Wait, so G is 305,61 and H is 305,610. My calculation was 305,610, which would be option H. But wait, looking at the initial calculation, the total is 305,610. So option H is 305,610. So the correct answer should be H. But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute, my initial calculation adds up to 305,610. So that's 300,000 +5,000=305,000; +600=305,600; +10=305,610. So yes, 305,610. So option H is 305,610. So the correct answer is H.

The total floor space is calculated by adding 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10, which equals 305,610 square feet. In standard form, this is written with commas as thousand separators, making it 305,610. Among the options, option H matches this value.

Answer: H
