Question:

A 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife come to the office for evaluation for infertility. The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?

Options:

A: Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes
B: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations
C: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations
D: Serum prolactin concentration

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this infertility question. Let me think through it step by step. 

The situation is a 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife are coming in for evaluation for infertility. The wife's gynecologist says there are no abnormalities, so she's looking at male factors. The husband is 188 cm, 6'3", with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm seen in semen analysis. So the question is, which test is most likely to establish the underlying cause of their infertility.

Hmm. I remember that infertility is often due to male factors. The main tests for male factors include things like the testicular biopsy, which looks at the testes, or maybe a molecular test like a karyotype. Also, hormonal tests like estrogen and testosterone levels are important because they can influence sperm production and testicular function. 

The husband's testicular size is small, but that doesn't immediately tell me if it's causing infertility. Since sperm isn't seen, it's more about male factors than testicular size. So looking at the testes (like a karyotype) would be more direct. But wait, the options don't have a karyotype—option A is a karyotype from peripheral leukocytes. Wait, karyotype usually refers to looking at chromosomes, which isn't part of this scenario. So maybe that's not the right answer.

Option B is serum estrogen and testosterone. These are key because they regulate male fertility. If the levels are abnormal, it can lead to infertility. But since the question is about the underlying cause, knowing the levels is important. But the question is which test is most likely to establish the cause. So if the levels are abnormal, that points to a possible issue, but the test itself (serum levels) is part of the evaluation. But I'm not sure if any test directly examines the testicular function.

Option C is serum levels of FSH and LH. I think these are related to testosterone. Testosterone levels can influence testicular function and sperm production. So if the levels are low or high, it affects whether the testes can produce sperm. Since the husband has small testicles, maybe it's more about the hormone levels than the testicular size. But I'm not certain if this is the most direct test for underlying causes of infertility.

Option D is prolactin. Wait, prolactin is related to testosterone. The testes are more about testosterone (TSH) and androgens, not directly prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that affects milk production, which might be a different issue, but not directly linked to testicular function. So prolactin levels might not be the best indicator here.

Wait, but the issue is sperm production. So factors that affect sperm production are the main areas. The most direct way to look at that would be the testicular function, which is often assessed with a testicular biopsy. But none of the options mention that. Let me check the options again.

Option A is a karyotype from peripheral leukocytes. I think that's looking at chromosomes, not testes. So that's probably not it. The question is about male factors, so maybe a testicular function test is needed. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the question says which test is most likely to establish the underlying cause. So the options are about different areas. 

Another thought: the absence of a karyotype (so A is not correct), the question is about male factors. So the next steps would be to look at the testes function—whether the testes are functional. To do that, a testicular biopsy might be done. But none of the options mention that.

Looking back at the options, the options given are A, B, C, D. So I need to choose among these.

Wait, the question is about the underlying cause. Potential male factors could be related to factors like androgens, testosterone, and possibly hormone imbalances. The serum estrogen and testosterone levels (Option B) are key because they directly affect male fertility. If the levels are abnormal, it's a problem. 

But the question is about which test is most likely to establish the cause. So if the levels are abnormal, that's a clue. But the test itself (like a karyotype) would determine whether the testes are functional. Since the options don't include a karyotype, perhaps the question is referring to a molecular test that assesses the testes.

Wait, the possible answers are A, B, C, D. So among these, option C is about serum levels of FSH and LH. I think that's more about the testes' response to testosterone. Because the testes produce and release androgens, which are produced by the TSH. So if FSH and LH are low, it might indicate that the testes aren't responding properly, which could affect sperm production. 

So in that case, the serum levels of FSH and LH would be more indicative of the underlying issue. Because the testes' function is more directly linked to these levels. Option C would indicate if the testes are producing androgens, which is a factor in infertility.

Alternatively, option B is about the hormone levels, so knowing if they're normal. But the question is which test is most likely to establish the cause. So if the levels are abnormal, that's a clue, but the test itself (like a karyotype) would be the direct way to assess function.

But since the options don't have a karyotype (A is a karyotype from peripheral leukocytes), which is not one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is C: serum levels of FSH and LH.

Wait, but the question says "most likely to establish the underlying cause." If the levels are abnormal, that's a clue. But the test itself (serum levels) is a way to get at that. However, the question is about the test, which test is used. Oh, perhaps the question is about which test is used to look at the test's function, which would be C.

Alternatively, if the test is the testicular function, which would be done via a biopsy, but that's not an option here. So the options are A, B, C, D. 

So, the possible answer is C, because looking at FSH and LH levels would tell you if the testes are producing androgens, which is a factor. So the answer would be C.

Wait another thought: the husband is 188 cm, 6'3", but his testicles are small. So maybe testicular size is not the main issue. The main issue is the production of androgens. So the FSH and LH levels would be more indicative of that.

So the correct answer is C.

The question involves a 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife evaluating for infertility, with the wife reporting no abnormalities in her evaluation. The husband has mild gynecomastia, small, firm testicles, and no sperm. The goal is to determine which test is most likely to establish the underlying cause of infertility.

Key considerations include the primary factors influencing male fertility, such as testicular function, hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, androgens), and the molecular basis of testicular activity. The options provided are:

- **A: Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes**  
  This refers to a testicular biopsy, which is not among the options. Thus, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

- **B: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations**  
  These levels are crucial as they directly affect male fertility. If levels are abnormal, it could indicate a problem with testicular function. However, the question asks for a test that establishes the underlying cause, and the molecular basis (testicular function) is not listed.

- **C: Serum levels of FSH and LH**  
  FSH ( females' testosterone) and LH (lactin hormone) levels are closely linked to testosterone production. Testosterone levels regulate testicular function, including sperm production. If these levels are abnormal, it could suggest a problem with the testes' ability to produce androgens, which are essential for fertility. This test directly assesses the functional aspects of the testes.

- **D: Serum prolactin concentration**  
  Prolactin is a hormone that affects milk production but is not directly linked to testicular function or sperm production. It is not relevant here.

Given that the primary issue is male fertility, the most relevant test is **C: Serum levels of FSH and LH**, as these levels are indicative of testicular function and respond to testosterone production. While serum levels (B) are important, they are not the direct test used to assess the functional role of the testes.

ANSWER: C
