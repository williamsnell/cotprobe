Okay, so I've got this question about perfectly competitive firms in the long run. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking which of the options is not correct for a perfectly competitive firm in the long run. The options are A, B, C, D.

I remember that in perfect competition, firms are price takers, so they set their own prices. Also, in the long run, firms can enter or exit the market due to free entry and exit, which affects the market supply.

So, in the long run, what happens for a firm? Well, I think that in the long run, firms will adjust to achieve the most efficient scale, probably through economies of scale. So, the firm will produce at the minimum point of its average total cost (ATC), right? That's because if ATC is minimized at a certain quantity, the firm can produce that quantity at the lowest average cost.

Wait, but I'm a little confused between ATC and average variable cost (AVC). Oh, right, in the long run, the average variable cost is still a consideration for entry and exit, but the minimum ATC is the first point where a firm would decide to produce. Because if the price is above minimum ATC, the firm will enter. But in the long run, everyone adjusts, so the market will reach a point where all firms are producing at the minimum ATC, which is also the minimum AVC, I think. Or maybe not exactly? Because sometimes there's a difference between the two.

Wait, the options are:

A: price = marginal revenue. That's true in any market because marginal revenue equals price in a perfectly competitive firm. So A is correct.

B: price = minimum average cost. Oh wait, in the long run, the firm's price should equal its minimum average cost. Because if the price is higher than minimum ATC, the firm can enter and lower the ATC. So B is correct.

C: price = minimum average variable cost. Wait, does that make sense? Because in the long run, the firm will produce at the minimum average variable cost. Because if the price is above that, the firm can cover its variable costs and some fixed costs. But wait, the minimum average variable cost is a separate concept from ATC. So, I think in the long run, the price will equal the minimum average variable cost because that's the point where the firm's marginal cost equals the price. But wait, that's in the short run, I believe. In the long run, the firm will adjust to minimize ATC, which may be higher than the minimum AVC if there are diminishing returns or if the firm's scale isn't optimal.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In perfect competition, in the long run, the firm's output will be determined by the minimum average total cost. Because if the price is higher than the minimum ATC, the firm will produce at the quantity where ATC is minimized. So, the price will equal the minimum ATC, not the minimum AVC. So option C is saying price equals minimum AVC, which might not be correct. Because in the long run, the firm's average variable cost might not be the same as the minimum ATC. Or do they ever coincide? No, I think they don't because for a perfectly competitive firm, the minimum ATC occurs at a higher quantity than the minimum AVC.

Wait, no, let's clarify. The minimum average total cost is the point where ATC is minimized, which occurs where the average total cost is equal to the average variable cost (AVC) plus the fixed cost per unit. So the minimum ATC occurs when the firm is producing at the most efficient scale, but that point might be where the average variable cost is at its minimum, but not necessarily lower than the ATC. Wait, no, actually, the minimum ATC is the same as the minimum of the average variable cost plus fixed costs. So at the minimum ATC, the average variable cost is equal to the ATC minus fixed cost. So the minimum ATC would occur at the quantity where the firm is producing at the minimum average variable cost plus fixed cost.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of equations. Suppose the firm's total cost is C(q) = TFC + TVC(q). Then ATC(q) = C(q)/q = (TFC/q) + (TVC/q) = AFC + AVC. So, the ATC is the sum of the average fixed cost and average variable cost. The minimum ATC would occur where (ATC is minimized). Since AFC is TFC/q, which decreases as q increases, while AVC is TVC/q, which may decrease or increase depending on returns to scale. So, the minimum ATC could occur at a quantity where ATC is lower than the minimum of AVC, because AFC is getting smaller.

Wait, but the minimum ATC could be at a higher quantity than the minimum AVC. So in the long run, the price will be equal to the minimum ATC, which is higher than the minimum AVC. So, in the options, option C says price equals minimum average variable cost. That would be incorrect because the minimum ATC is higher than the minimum AVC. So, option C is not correct, meaning it's the correct answer to the question as it's asking which is not correct.

Alternatively, let's think about each option:

A: price = marginal revenue. True in all markets, including perfect competition. So A is correct.

B: price = minimum average cost. In the long run, the price will be equal to the minimum ATC, not the minimum AVC. So B is correct.

C: price = minimum average variable cost. Incorrect, because in the long run, the price equals the minimum ATC, not the minimum AVC. So C is not correct.

D: price = marginal cost. That's correct in the long run, because firms produce where price equals marginal cost to minimize profit. So D is correct.

So the question is which is not correct. So the answer is option C.
</think>

In a perfectly competitive firm operating in the long run, the correct statements are:

- **A**: Price equals marginal revenue. This is true in all markets, including perfect competition, as marginal revenue equals price in such markets.

- **B**: Price equals the minimum average cost. In the long run, the firm will produce at the quantity where the price equals the minimum average total cost (ATC). While the minimum ATC may occur at a higher quantity than the minimum average variable cost (AVC), the price will still equal the minimum ATC, not the minimum AVC. Thus, B is correct.

- **C**: Price equals the minimum average variable cost. This is incorrect. In the long run, the price equals the minimum ATC, not the minimum AVC. The minimum ATC occurs at a quantity where the firm is producing at the most efficient scale, which may involve higher production levels than the minimum AVC.

- **D**: Price equals marginal cost. This is correct in the long run, as firms produce at the quantity where price equals marginal cost to maximize profit.

The option that is not correct is **C**, as the price in the long run equals the minimum ATC, not the minimum AVC.

**Answer: C**
