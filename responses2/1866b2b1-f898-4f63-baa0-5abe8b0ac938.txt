Okay, I have this complex analysis problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The integral is ∫C 1/(z^2 + 4)^2 dz, where C is a contour that's a circle centered at (0, i) with a diameter of 3. It goes counter-clockwise. I need to evaluate this integral and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, so the contour is centered at (0, i), which is the point on the imaginary axis. The diameter is 3, so the radius is 1.5. That means the circle has radius 1.5, right? So in the complex plane, the center is at (0,1) and radius is 1.5. So it's a circle that extends from (0,1) - 1.5i to (0,1) +1.5i, but wait, no, the center is (0, i) which is (0,1) in the complex plane. So the circle is in the upper half-plane.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The diameter is 3, so radius is 1.5. The center is at (0, i), so in the complex plane, the center is (0,1), and the radius is 1.5. So the circle goes from 0,1 - 1.5 to 0,1 +1.5. So in the complex plane, that's from (0, -0.5) to (0, 2.5). So it's a circle that's mostly in the upper half-plane, but does it pass through the origin? Let me check: the center is at (0,1), radius 1.5. So the distance from the center to the origin is 1. So the origin lies inside the circle because the radius is 1.5 and the distance from center to origin is 1, which is less than 1.5. So the origin is inside the contour.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that matters for the integral. Maybe, but maybe there's another approach. Since the integrand is 1/(z^2 +4)^2, I should think about the singularities of this function. The denominator is (z^2 +4)^2, so z^2 +4 = 0 → z^2 = -4 → z= ±2i. So the poles of the integrand are at z=2i and z=-2i.

Now, since the contour is centered at (0,i) with radius 1.5, let's see where these poles are relative to the contour. The center is at (0,1), and radius 1.5, so the distance from the center to each pole:

For z=2i, it's at (0,2). The center is at (0,1), so the distance is 1 unit. So the pole is inside the contour. For z=-2i, the center is at (0,1), and the pole is at (0,-2). The distance from center to pole is 3 units in the imaginary direction. Since the radius is 1.5, this pole is outside the contour.

So the function has a pole inside the contour at z=2i, and the other pole is outside. So, in the integrand, the only singularity inside C is at z=2i.

Now, I need to compute the integral ∫C [1/(z^2 +4)^2] dz. Since the integrand has a pole of order 2 at z=2i, I can use the residue theorem here.

The residue theorem says that the integral over a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. So I need to calculate the residue of 1/(z^2+4)^2 at z=2i.

Residue at z=2i for a function f(z) = 1/(z^2 +4)^2. Since z=2i is a pole of order 2, the residue can be calculated using the formula:

Res(f, z=a) = (1/(k-1)!)) * lim_{z→a} [d^{k-1}/dz^{k-1} ( (z - a)^k f(z) ) ]

In this case, k=2, so the formula becomes:

Res(f, z=2i) = lim_{z→2i} (z - 2i) * [1/(z^2 +4)^2]

Wait, but let me make sure. The function f(z) = 1/(z^2 +4)^2. The pole at z=2i is a double pole, so k=2. So the residue is (1/(2-1)!) * lim_{z→2i} d^{2-1}/dz^{2-1} [ (z - 2i)^2 f(z) ) ]

Which simplifies to (1/1!) * lim_{z→2i} d/dz [ (z - 2i)^2 * 1/(z^2 +4)^2 ]

So compute that derivative.

Let me write (z^2+4) = (z - 2i)(z + 2i). So (z^2+4)^2 = (z -2i)^2 (z +2i)^2.

So (z - 2i)^2 f(z) = (z -2i)^2 * 1/( (z-2i)^2 (z+2i)^2 ) ) = 1/(z + 2i)^2.

So the expression inside the limit is 1/(z + 2i)^2.

Taking the derivative with respect to z of that gives:

d/dz [1/(z + 2i)^2] = -2/(z + 2i)^3.

Evaluate this at z=2i:

Denominator becomes (2i + 2i) = 4i. So (4i)^3 = 64 i^3 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So the derivative at z=2i is -2 / (-64i) = (-2) / (-64i) = 2/(64i) = (1)/(32i).

But wait, the residue is multiplied by 1/(k-1)! which is 1/1! =1, so the residue is 1/(32i).

But wait, the residue is [1/(32i)].

Wait, no, because (z-2i)^2 f(z) becomes 1/(z+2i)^2, so the derivative is d/dz [1/(z+2i)^2] = -2/(z+2i)^3.

At z=2i, this is -2/( (2i +2i) )^3 = -2/(4i)^3.

(4i)^3 = (4)^3 * i^3 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So it's -2 / (-64i) = (2)/(64i) = 1/(32i).

But wait, the residue is Res = 1/(32i).

But the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside. So integral = 2πi * (1/(32i)) )= 2πi * (1/(32i)).

Simplify that: 2πi / (32i) ) = 2π/(32) )= π/16.

Hmm, wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the steps because that seems a bit off.

Wait, 2πi times [1/(32i)] equals (2πi)(1/(32i)) = (2π)(1)/(32) )= π/16 ≈ 0.19635. Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.19634, which is approximately 0.19635. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the residue calculation?

Wait another approach: Let me write the function as f(z) = 1/(z^2 +4)^2 = 1/[(z-2i)^2 (z+2i)^2].

So, since z=2i is a double pole, the residue is [1/(2-1)!] lim_{z→2i} d^{2-1}/dz^{2-1} [ (z-2i)^2 f(z) ]

Which is 1 * lim [d/dz ( (z - 2i)^2 * 1/( (z-2i)^2 (z+2i)^2 ) ) ]

= lim [d/dz (1/(z+2i)^2) ]

= lim [ -2/(z+2i)^3 ]

At z=2i, this is -2/( (2i +2i) )^3 = -2/(4i)^3.

(4i)^3 = 64 i^3 = -64i.

So it's -2/(-64i) = 2/(64i) = (1)/(32i).

So the residue is 1/(32i).

Then the integral is 2πi times 1/(32i) = (2πi)(1/(32i)) = 2π/(32) = π/16 ≈ 0.19635, which is option B.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B: 0.19634.

To evaluate the integral ∫C 1/(z² + 4)² dz over the contour C, which is a circle centered at (0, i) with a diameter of 3, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the contour and poles**:  
   - The contour is a circle with center (0, i) and radius 1.5.  
   - The poles of the integrand 1/(z² + 4)² are at z = ±2i.  
   - The pole at z = 2i lies inside the contour (distance from center (0, i) to 2i is 1, which is less than the radius 1.5).  
   - The pole at z = -2i lies outside the contour (distance from center to -2i is 3, which is greater than the radius 1.5).

2. **Apply the residue theorem**:  
   Since there is only one pole inside the contour (z = 2i), the integral equals 2πi times the residue at z = 2i.

3. **Calculate the residue**:  
   For a double pole at z = 2i, the residue is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Res}(f, 2i) = \lim_{z \to 2i} \frac{d}{dz} \left[ (z - 2i)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2} \right]
   \]  
   Simplify the expression inside the limit:  
   \[
   (z^2 + 4)^2 = (z - 2i)^2 (z + 2i)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2} = \frac{1}{(z - 2i)^2 (z + 2i)^2}
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   (z - 2i)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2} = \frac{1}{(z + 2i)^2}
   \]  
   Differentiate with respect to z:  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dz} \left[ \frac{1}{(z + 2i)^2} \right] = -\frac{2}{(z + 2i)^3}
   \]  
   Evaluate at z = 2i:  
   \[
   -\frac{2}{(2i + 2i)^3} = -\frac{2}{(4i)^3} = -\frac{2}{-64i} = \frac{1}{32i}
   \]  
   The residue is 1/(32i).

4. **Compute the integral**:  
   Using the residue theorem:  
   \[
   \int_C \frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2} dz = 2\pi i \cdot \frac{1}{32i} = \frac{2\pi}{32} = \frac{\pi}{16} \approx 0.19635
   \]  

5. **Match the result to the options**:  
   The closest option to 0.19635 is **B: 0.19634**.
