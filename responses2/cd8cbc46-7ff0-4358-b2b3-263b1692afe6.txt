Okay, so I have this question about a phase change, right? The question says, "When a gas turns into a liquid, the process is called..." and then gives me a list of options. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that phase changes involve different states of matter: gas, liquid, solid. The key here is the process by which they change. Let me think about each option.

Option A is deposition. I think deposition is when a liquid turns into a solid, like when ice forms from water. So that's not what's happening here since we're going from gas to liquid.

Option B is sublimation. Sublimation is a phase change where a substance goes from gas to solid directly, without passing through liquid. Like dry ice turning into solid CO2. Yes, that fits because when a gas (like CO2) turns into a liquid (dry ice) and then solidifies into solid CO2. So sublimation is the right term here.

Option C is condensation. That's when a gas turns into a liquid, but it goes through the intermediate phase of liquid. So that's more like when a parcel of steam cools and turns into water droplets. So condensation is the opposite of sublimation.

Option D is solidification. I think that's when a liquid turns into a solid, like ice forming from liquid water. So that's the reverse of fusion, which is when solid turns into liquid.

Option E is fusion. That's when a solid becomes a liquid, like melting ice. So fusion is the opposite of solidification.

Option F is precipitation. That's when a solution's solute crystals, like when water freezes and ice forms on a windowpane. That's a solidifying process, but not directly a phase change from gas to liquid.

Option G is evaporation. That's when a liquid turns into gas, like water turning into vapor. So that's a different process.

Option H is dissolution. That's when a solid's ions get into solution, like dissolving sugar in water. Again, a different process.

Option I is ionization. That's about breaking ions into smaller pieces, which isn't a phase change.

Option J is vaporization. That's when a liquid turns into gas, like boiling water into steam. So that's a gas turning into vapor, which is the opposite of what we're looking for.

So, putting it all together. The question is about gas turning into liquid. Sublimation is when gas goes directly to solid, so that's the correct term. So the answer should be B.

When a gas turns into a liquid, the process is called **sublimation**. This occurs when a substance transitions directly from gas to solid without passing through liquid, such as dry ice turning into solid CO2. 

Answer: B
