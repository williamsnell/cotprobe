Okay, so I have this question about liquid NH3 boiling and what happens during that process. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that boiling occurs when a liquid turns into gas. For NH3, which is a liquid, it's going to boil when it reaches its boiling point. The boiling point of NH3 is around 100 degrees Celsius, I think. But wait, am I mixing that up with other gases? Yeah, because NH3 is a liquid at room temperature, so it can boil.

So during boiling, the molecules start to escape from the liquid phase into the gas phase. I'm trying to remember what happens in that phase change. The intermolecular forces are breaking. For gases, the main intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces. So when NH3 turns into gas, those London forces are being released.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: The hydrogen bonds within individual NH3 molecules break apart. Wait, NH3 is a molecule with hydrogen bonds. So when it's in liquid form, the H-N-H bonds are strong, right? So as it boils, those bonds break. But the question is about the hydrogen bonds within individual molecules. I think that's correct because each NH3 molecule has H-H bonds. So when it's in liquid state, those H-H bonds are holding the molecule together. When it boils, the bonds break, so A would be correct. But wait, is the question about the hydrogen bonds breaking apart, or within the molecules? I think the question is about the bonds within the molecule, so A is correct.

Option B: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together become stronger. No, because as the liquid turns into gas, the molecules are moving apart and H-H bonds breaking, so the bonds become weaker. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The overall temperature of the solution rises as the NH3 molecules speed up. Wait, as the solution boils, the temperature remains the same until it reaches the boiling point. Because boiling is a phase change, not a temperature change. So if the solution is brought to boiling, the temperature stays at 100Â°C, not rising. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules strengthen. N-H bonds are the same as the H-H bonds in NH3. When it boils, the H-H bonds break, so the N-H bonds break as well. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The amount of energy within the system remains constant. No, because as the liquid turns into gas, energy is released. So the system's energy decreases. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The overall temperature of the solution decreases as the NH3 molecules slow down. Wait, as the NH3 boils, the temperature doesn't change. The solution remains at the boiling point until it all turns into gas. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart. No, because N-H bonds are part of the liquid, and during boiling, they break. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart. Oh, wait! When the liquid NH3 is boiling, it's moving from a more ordered state (liquid) to a less ordered state (gas). The hydrogen bonds holding the molecules together in the liquid state break as the molecules escape into the gas phase. So H is correct.

Option I: The overall volume of the solution decreases. That doesn't make sense. When NH3 boils, the volume would actually increase because it's turning into gas, which tends to occupy more space. So I is incorrect.

So the correct answers are A and H.

The boiling of liquid NH3 occurs at its boiling point, where the hydrogen bonds within the liquid molecules break apart, and the molecules are driven apart into the gas phase. Here's the breakdown of the options:

- **A: The hydrogen bonds within individual NH3 molecules break apart.**  
  This is correct because as the liquid NH3 turns into gas, the hydrogen bonds within the molecules are released.

- **B: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together become stronger.**  
  This is incorrect because as the liquid boils, the hydrogen bonds break, weakening the intermolecular forces.

- **C: The overall temperature of the solution rises as the NH3 molecules speed up.**  
  This is incorrect because boiling is a phase change at a constant temperature, so the temperature does not rise.

- **D: The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules strengthen.**  
  This is incorrect because the N-H bonds break as the liquid NH3 boils away into the gas phase.

- **E: The amount of energy within the system remains constant.**  
  This is incorrect because the boiling process releases energy, so the system's energy decreases.

- **F: The overall temperature of the solution decreases as the NH3 molecules slow down.**  
  This is incorrect because the boiling temperature remains constant until the solution reaches the boiling point.

- **G: The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart.**  
  This is incorrect because the N-H bonds remain in the liquid phase until boiling.

- **H: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.**  
  This is correct because as the liquid NH3 boils, the hydrogen bonds between molecules are released, freeing the molecules from the liquid phase.

- **I: The overall volume of the solution decreases.**  
  This is incorrect because the volume of the solution increases as the liquid NH3 turns into gas.

The correct answers are **A** and **H**.
