Okay, so I need to find the opposite of the number -7. Hmm, let's think about what "opposite" means. Oh right, the opposite of a number is its additive inverse. So if I have a number x, the opposite is -x. 

So in this case, the number is -7. The opposite would be -(-7). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so that would be 7. 

Looking at the options, option E is 14 and option J is 70. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Because sometimes people confuse opposite in terms of reciprocal or something else. But no, additive inverse is definitely -x. So -(-7) is 7. But none of the options have 7. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me read them again.

A: −0.77
B: −14
C: −7
D: 0.7
E: 14
F: 7
G: −0.07
H: −7.7
I: 0.77
J: 70

So wait, option F is 7. Oh, because 7 is the opposite in a way, but that's not the additive inverse. Because the additive inverse of -7 is 7. So if I'm looking for the opposite, it's 7. But in the options, F is 7. So why isn't that the correct answer?

Wait, but wait. Oh no, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. The additive inverse of a number is the number that, when added to the original, equals zero. So -7 plus 7 is zero. So the opposite is indeed 7. But looking at the options, F is 7.

So based on that, the correct answer would be F. But wait, I'm confused earlier because I thought maybe the reciprocal or something else is considered the opposite. But no, the opposite is additive inverse. So I think F is the right answer.

The opposite of -7 is 7, which is option F.

Answer: F
