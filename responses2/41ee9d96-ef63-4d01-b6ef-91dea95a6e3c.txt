Okay, so I've got this problem here about salaries in a metropolitan region. The question is about finding the standard deviation given some information. Let's see, the mean salary is $55,800, and the first quartile is $48,815. Hmm.

I remember that the first quartile, Q1, is the value separating the lowest 25% of the data from the rest. In a normal distribution, the first quartile is related to the mean and the standard deviation. I think the formula involves the Z-score. Oh wait, the first quartile is at the 25th percentile, which corresponds to a Z-score of about -0.6745. Because in standard normal distribution tables, 25% is at around Z = -0.674.

So, the formula for Z is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. I need to set up the equation using the first quartile.

So, Q1 = μ + Z * σ. Wait, no, actually, the first quartile is at the point where 25% of the data is below it. So in terms of Z, Q1 corresponds to the Z-score where the cumulative probability is 0.25. I think that's correct.

So, substituting the values: 48,815 = 55,800 + (-0.6745) * σ. Let me compute this.

First, subtract 55,800 from both sides: 48,815 - 55,800 = (-0.6745) * σ. Let's calculate 48,815 - 55,800. That's -6,985.

So, -6,985 = (-0.6745)*σ. To solve for σ, divide both sides by -0.6745.

So σ = (-6,985) / (-0.6745) = 6,985 / 0.6745.

Hmm, I need to compute that division. Let me do it step by step. 6,985 divided by 0.6745.

Wait, 0.6745 is approximately 2/3, but maybe I should be more precise. Alternatively, I can calculate it as 6,985 ÷ 0.6745.

Let me approximate: 0.6745 * 10,356 would be around 7,000? Let me check: 0.6745 * 10,000 is 6,745, so 10,356 would be 0.6745*(10,000 + 356) = 6,745 + (0.6745*356). 0.6745 *356 is approx 240. So 6,745 + 240 = 6,985. So 0.6745 * 10,356 ≈ 6,985. So σ would be approximately 10,356.

Looking back at the options, option D is $10,356. So that must be the answer.

The first quartile (Q1) in a normal distribution corresponds to a Z-score of approximately -0.6745. Using the formula:

\[
Q1 = \mu + Z \cdot \sigma
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
48,815 = 55,800 + (-0.6745) \cdot \sigma
\]

Solving for \(\sigma\):

\[
48,815 - 55,800 = -0.6745 \cdot \sigma \\
-6,985 = -0.6745 \cdot \sigma \\
\sigma = \frac{6,985}{0.6745} \approx 10,356
\]

Thus, the standard deviation is approximately $10,356.

Answer: D
