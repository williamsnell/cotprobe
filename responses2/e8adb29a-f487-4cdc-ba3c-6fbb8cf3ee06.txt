Alright, so I have this question about social behavior and decision-making. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is asking about someone who is low in self-monitoring. Snyder, in 1987, probably refers to Snyder's theory about self-criticism. I remember that self-criticism is the ability to monitor one's own behavior and assess whether it aligns with one's values and goals. If a person has low self-monitoring, they probably don't do much of thatâ€”maybe they don't evaluate their own actions much, so they rely more on other strategies.

Now, the question is about what they rely on when making a decision in a social situation. The options are A through J. I'll go through each one to see which makes sense.

Option A: His/her life scripts. Life scripts are like a template of how a person behaves based on their life experiences. I think people who are low on self-monitoring might rely on these templates rather than evaluating their own behavior. So this could be a possibility.

Option B: Past experiences in similar situations. If someone relies on past experiences, they might use these as a guide. But wait, if they're low on self-criticism, they might not prioritize past experiences as much as they do other strategies. Or maybe they do rely on them. I'm not sure.

Option C: Advice from friends or family. Friends and family can provide a lot of information and emotional cues. But again, if someone is low on self-monitoring, they might not rely too much on others, so this might not be the best answer.

Option D: Random decision making. That doesn't make much sense. If someone relies on others, they should have a more deliberate approach, not random choices. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Societal norms and expectations. These are external factors, but if someone is low in self-monitoring, they might not have a lot of influence. But maybe they still rely on societal cues more than they make decisions themselves.

Option F: Internal working models acquired during infancy and early childhood. These are personal beliefs and values. If someone's self-criticism is low, they might rely more on these internal models rather than external cues.

Option G: Popular trends or fads. Trends can influence behavior, but if someone is low on self-monitoring, they might not be swayed by current trends as much.

Option H: Expectations of authority figures. If someone is low on self-criticism, they might rely more on what others expect of them, like what authority figures say.

Option J: Personal feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. This seems like a strong candidate. If someone is low on self-monitoring, they might not think much about their own feelings or beliefs. They might just follow the advice of others or rely on what they've learned from life scripts or past experiences.

Wait, but the question is about what they rely on. Snyder's theory suggests that low self-criticism leads to reliance on life scripts and past experiences. Because self-criticism is about evaluating one's own actions, if you don't do that, you might just follow a set of patterns (life scripts) or remember past instances (past experiences). 

So the answer should be J, because they rely on their own feelings, like what they feel about their own behavior, their own past experiences, and their own beliefs. That's the low self-critics approach.

The correct answer is **J: his/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs**. 

**Explanation**: 
When a person is low in self-monitoring, they rely more on internal factors such as their prior experiences, life scripts, and personal beliefs rather than external cues or evaluations. This aligns with the idea that low self-criticism leads to dependency on personal attitudes and feelings. 

Answer: J
