Okay, so I have this logic question to solve. The question is about translating the statement "No artifacts are people" into predicate logic. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the statement "No artifacts are people." That means every artifact is not a person. So, if something is an artifact (let's say Ax), then it cannot be a person (let's say Px). So, in logical terms, if Ax is true, then Px must be false. 

In predicate logic, "no" often translates to a universal negative. So, for every x, if Ax is true, then Px is false. The implication here is ~Px. So the statement can be written as ∀x (Ax → ~Px). But wait, looking at the options, I don't see a universal implication yet. Let's see the options given.

Option A: (∀x)(~Ax ⊃ Px). Hmm, that's saying if it's not an artifact, then it's a person. That doesn't make sense because the original statement is about artifacts not being people. So A might be the opposite of what we want.

Option B: (∀x)(Px ⊃ ~Ax). This states that if something is a person, then it's not an artifact. Wait, that's similar to our statement! Because the original statement is that all artifacts are not people, which can be rewritten as all people are not artifacts. So B seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The original statement is "No artifacts are people." So, for every x, if Ax is true, then Px is false. So, Ax → ~Px. But none of the options directly match that. Let's look at the other options.

Option B is ∀x (Px → ~Ax), which is the same as ∀x (Ax → ~Px) because implication is reversible. So B is correct.

Looking at the other options, like option A is the converse. Option C is ∀x (Ax ∧ Px), which would mean every artifact is a person, which is the opposite of the original statement. So C is wrong.

Option D is ~Aa, which is a particular statement about a specific artifact. But the original statement is about all artifacts, not just a specific one. So D is too specific and not a universal statement.

Option E: ∀x (Px → Ax). That would mean every person is an artifact, which is not the opposite of our statement. So E is wrong.

Option F: ∀x (Ax → ~Px). That's exactly what I was thinking earlier. So F should be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F is ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is the same as the statement we want to express. So F is correct.

Let me double-check the other options. Option G is ~Pa, which is a particular statement about a specific person a. It doesn't cover all artifacts. So unless the person a is an artifact, which is not given, it's not a universal negation. So G is only true for a specific a, not for all.

Option H: ∀x (Px ∧ Ax). That's saying all people are artifacts, which is the opposite, so H is wrong.

Option I: ~Ap. That's a particular statement about a specific artifact a. But again, only applies to a, not all artifacts.

Option J: ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px). That's saying every artifact is not a person, which is exactly the statement we need to translate. So J is also correct.

Wait, so both F and J are correct? That can't be right. Let me read the question again. The question says "select the best translation," and all options are different. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, the question is about "No artifacts are people." So it's a universal statement claiming that for all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person.

Which is ∀x (Ax → ~Px). But looking at the options, F is ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which matches. J is ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px), which is the same as F because Ax → ~Px is equivalent to ∀x (Ax → ~Px) and also equivalent to ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px) if we consider that for each x, Ax implies ~Px, so Ax must be true only if ~Px is true, meaning Ax and ~Px must both be true.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Ax → ~Px is equivalent to ~(Ax ∧ Px). Because if Ax is true, then Px must be false. So Ax → ~Px is the same as ~(Ax ∧ Px). So option F is ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is the same as ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px) is not correct because Ax → ~Px is not the same as Ax ∧ ~Px. Because Ax ∧ ~Px is only true when both are true, but Ax → ~Px is only true when Ax is true and ~Px is true. So F is correct as ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is the same as J: ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px) is not correct. Wait, no. Because (Ax → ~Px) is equivalent to ~(Ax ∧ Px). So for each x, either it's not an artifact, or it's not a person, or both. But J is saying Ax and ~Px, which is a stronger statement. So J is not the same as F.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about it differently. The original statement is "No artifacts are people," which is ∀x (Ax → ~Px). So in predicate logic, that's correct. So F is ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is the same as J's statement, which is ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px). Wait, no, they are not the same. Because Ax → ~Px is not equivalent to Ax ∧ ~Px. Let me see: Ax → ~Px is equivalent to ~Ax ∨ ~Px. Which is the same as ~(Ax ∧ Px). So F is ∀x (~Ax ∨ ~Px), which is the same as the original statement. J is ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px), which is a different statement. So F is correct, but J is not. Because J is stating that every artifact is not a person, but F is saying that every artifact is not a person or it's not an artifact. So F's statement is the same as the original. So F is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J. So F is correct, J is not. Because J is ∀x(Ax ∧ ~Px), which is a stronger statement than F. So F is the correct translation.

Wait, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me summarize:

- "No artifacts are people" → ∀x (Ax → ~Px) → which is option F.

- "J: ∀x (Ax ∧ ~Px)" → which is ∀x(Ax and ~Px), which is a stronger statement than F. So F is correct, J is not. Because F is equivalent to ∀x( ~Ax ∨ ~Px ), which is the same as the original statement.

So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that F and J might both be correct. But no, J is stronger. So the correct option is F.

The correct answer is F.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

The statement "No artifacts are people" translates to "Every artifact is not a person." In predicate logic, this is expressed as ∀x (Ax → ~Px), which is option F. This means for every x, if x is an artifact (Ax), then x is not a person (~Px). None of the other options correctly represent this universal negation. 

- **A and G:** These options are the converse of the original statement, not the negation.
- **C, D, E, H, I, J:** These options are either particular statements (only about a specific artifact or person) or mix universal and particular statements, which do not accurately capture the universal negation.

Thus, the correct translation is option F.

**Answer: F**
