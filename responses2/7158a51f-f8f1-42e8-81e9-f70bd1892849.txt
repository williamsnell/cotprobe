Okay, so I've got this property question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read the question again carefully.

The homeowner conveys his home and surrounding properties to his daughter with a deed that says: "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move." 

I'm supposed to determine what the daughter's interest is at the end of her lifetime. The options are various types of interests.

First, I need to understand the conveyance structure. The deed is divided in such a way that the daughter gets a life estate to her aunt, but there's a condition. If the aunt moves to another state, then the daughter's interest passes to her sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest goes to the sister's heirs.

Wait, no, wait. Let me parse the deed correctly. The order is: daughter gets life to aunt, then if aunt moves, sister gets life to aunt, then if aunt doesn't move, sister's heirs. So the structure is like:

- Daughter: life to Aunt
- Aunt moves: sister gets life to Aunt
- Aunt doesn't move: sister's heirs

But wait, that would have the daughter's interest passing through aunt only if she moves. So the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, which is a vested remainder subject to executory limitation. Because if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest goes to her sister. If she doesn't move, she gives to the sister's heirs.

Wait, but wait, the deed says: "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, then if my aunt moves, to my sister for life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move." So the structure is:

- Daughter: life to Aunt
- If Aunt moves: sister: life to Aunt
- If Aunt doesn't move: sister's heirs.

So the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but only if she doesn't move. If she does move, it goes to the sister's heirs. So the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to certain conditions. Hmm.

Wait no, the structure is that the daughter has a life estate to her aunt, but if her aunt moves, she has a life estate to her sister, and if her aunt doesn't move, she has a life estate to her sister's heirs. So the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but only if the aunt doesn't move. If the aunt moves, she doesn't have a life estate to her sister but goes to her sister's heirs.

Wait, that's a bit different. So the daughter's estate is a life estate to her aunt, but only if the aunt doesn't move. So it's a life estate subject to certain conditions. So it's a vested remainder subject to executory limitation. Because the daughter has a vested remainder (life estate) to her aunt, but it's subject to the condition that if the aunt moves, she doesn't get it back but gives to the sister's heirs.

So the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to condition subsequent. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that if the aunt moves, she doesn't get a remainder back but instead gives to the sister's heirs. So the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to being transferred to the sister's heirs if the aunt moves.

So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to executory limitation. Because she has the right to possess the property for life, but if the condition is met (aunt moves), she can't possess it anymore, and instead passes it to someone else.

Looking at the options, option I is "vested remainder subject to complete divestiture." Option A is "vested remainder subject to open."

Wait, let's clarify. A vested remainder subject to open means that the remainder is vested (the property is given to the remainder for life) but if the remainder moves, the remainderer (the one who gets the property) can take it. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, a vested remainder is when the property is given to the remainder for life. But if the remainder moves, the original grantee (the one who got the remainder) can take it. So it's a vested remainder subject to open.

Option I is "vested remainder subject to complete divestiture." That's when the remainder is vested, but if the condition is met, the remainder is divested, and the property goes to the grantee (the one who originally got the remainder, perhaps the one who conveyed the deed).

Wait, in this case, the daughter gets the life estate to her aunt. If the aunt moves, she no longer has that life estate, and instead, the sister gets her to the sister's life estate. Wait, no, the structure is that if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is given to her sister. So the daughter has a life estate to her aunt, but if her aunt moves, that life estate is passed to her sister. So she doesn't have a vested remainder subject to some other condition, but rather, it's a life estate that's subject to the condition.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The deed structure is:

- Daughter: life to Aunt
- If Aunt moves: sister: life to Aunt
- If Aunt doesn't move: sister's heirs.

So if the aunt moves, the daughter doesn't have the life estate to her aunt anymore. She instead has a life estate to her sister, but that's only if the aunt didn't move. If the aunt does move, the daughter's interest is to her sister's heirs. Wait, no, I think the actual structure is that the daughter has a life estate to her aunt, but if her aunt moves, that life estate is passed to her sister. If she doesn't move, then the daughter's life estate goes to her sister's heirs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

The deed structure is a series of life estates and remainderships. The structure is:

Daughter: life to Aunt (Aunt is a life estate to herself, but if she moves, she can't possess the daughter's interest anymore, and instead, the daughter's interest would pass to her sister.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure is:

Daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt. If her aunt moves, then the daughter's interest would pass to her sister. If the aunt doesn't move, then the daughter's interest passes to her sister's heirs.

Wait, no, perhaps the entire structure is that the daughter has a life estate to her aunt. However, if the aunt moves, that life estate is transferred to her sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is transferred to her sister's heirs. So the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if her aunt moves, that interest is transferred to her sister. If the aunt doesn't move, then the daughter's interest goes to her sister's heirs.

So, in that case, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's estate is transferred to her sister's heirs. So the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to executory limitation.

Looking at the options, option I is "vested remainder subject to complete divestiture." That would mean the remainder is vested (the property is given to the holder for life) but if the condition is met, the holder is divested and the property goes to the original grantee.

Wait, but in this case, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. So if the aunt moves, her daughter's interest is transferred. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest goes to the sister's heirs. So it's a life estate that's subject to being transferred if the condition is met.

Alternatively, perhaps the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to executory limitation. Because she has a vested remainder (the property is given to her for life), but if the condition is met, she can't possess it anymore, and instead, the property goes to someone else. So the condition is that if the aunt moves, the daughter's remainder is divested and given to the sister.

So the correct term for this is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture. Because the remainder (daughter's interest) is vested, but if the condition is met (aunt moves), the remainder is divested (given to the sister) and the property is no longer with the daughter.

Wait, but the condition is that the remainder is subject to certain divestment. Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct term is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture. So option I.

Option I: "vested remainder subject to complete divestiture." So the daughter's interest is a vested remainder (life estate) to her aunt, but only if the aunt moves. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest moves to her sister's heirs. So the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

Alternatively, another way: if the condition is that the aunt moves, then the daughter's remainder is divested, and transferred to the sister's heirs.

So, the daughter's estate is a life estate, but only if the condition (aunt moves) is met. If it's not, she gets the sister's heirs. So the interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

Wait, but what's the difference between complete and open divestiture? Complete divestiture would mean that the remainder is divested and the property goes to the original grantee (the one who conveyed the deed, in this case, the sister is the original grantee). Open divestiture is when the remainder is divested but the property remains with the grantee.

So, in this case, if the aunt moves, the daughter's remainder is divested and given to the sister. So the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture, because if the condition is met, the remainder is gone (divested) and given to the sister.

Wait, but in the deed, the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but only if the aunt moves. So she has a vested remainder subject to certain conditions. So the correct term is vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

Another angle: The deed says "if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move." So the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but only if the aunt doesn't move. If the aunt does move, she can't have that interest, and instead, the interest goes to the sister's heirs.

So, the daughter's interest is a life estate (vested) to her aunt, but it's subject to the condition that the aunt must move. If the condition is met, the daughter's life estate is transferred. If not, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister's heirs. So, it's a life estate subject to certain conditions.

There's another term for this. A life estate subject to executory limitation means that the estate is vested and is subject to being transferred if the condition is met. So the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to executory limitation.

Alternatively, a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture would mean that if the condition is met, the remainder is gone, and the property is transferred to the original grantee.

Wait, but in this case, the condition is that if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is transferred. So if the aunt moves, the daughter's remainder is gone, and the property is given to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's remainder stays, but under what condition? Wait, no. The way the deed is phrased, it's a life estate to the aunt, and if the aunt moves, the daughter's estate is transferred. So the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to the condition that the aunt must move. If the condition is not met, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister's heirs.

Wait, but the term "subject to" can refer to whether the estate is divested. So if the aunt moves, the daughter's remainder is divested and given to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's remainder stays, but the property is given to the sister's heirs. So the daughter's interest is subject to the condition that the aunt must move. If that condition is met, the daughter's remainder is divested and given to the sister. If not, the remainder is still hers, but the property is given to the sister's heirs.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt. So if the aunt doesn't move, the daughter has a life estate to her sister. But according to the deed, the daughter's interest is a life estate to the aunt, but if the aunt moves, it's transferred, and if the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest passes to the sister's heirs. But that doesn't make sense because the sister's heirs would be the descendants of the sister, not the aunt's heirs.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the options are. The options are about the type of interest the daughter has.

Option I: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

Option F: shifting executory interest.

Wait, another approach. The structure is that the daughter has a life estate to her aunt, but only if the aunt doesn't move. So, if the aunt does move, she can't have that life estate, and instead, the daughter's interest is given to her sister's heirs. So, the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to the condition that the aunt must move. If the condition is met, the remainder is divested and given to the sister. If not, the remainder is still hers, but the property is given to the sister's heirs. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the sister's heirs are the remaindermen of the sister, not the aunt's.

Wait, I think the correct way to think about this is that the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. So, if the aunt moves, the daughter's estate is divested and given to the sister. If she doesn't move, the daughter's estate passes to the sister's heirs. So, in either case, the daughter's estate is a vested remainder (to her aunt) with the possibility of being divested if the condition is met.

So, the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture because if the aunt moves, the remainder is divested and given to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister's heirs, but that's another life estate, not the daughter's.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is divested and given to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is a life estate to her sister, but that's not what's written. Let me see: the question says "if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move."

Wait, the structure is: daughter (life to aunt), if aunt moves: sister (life to aunt), else: sister's heirs.

So, the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if the aunt moves, the daughter's remainder is divested and given to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is a life estate to her sister, but that's not the case because the structure says that if the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is to the sister's heirs.

Wait, no. The structure is that the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt. If the aunt moves, then the daughter's interest is transferred. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should approach this by considering each option.

Option I: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture. So, the remainder is vested (to the aunt) but if the condition is met (aunt moves), it's divested and given to the sister.

Option A: vested remainder subject to open. That would mean that the remainder is vested, but if the condition is met, it doesn't transfer but the property moves to the grantee. Or perhaps, the remainder is divested and transferred to the grantee.

Wait, no. Open divestiture is when the remainder is divested, but the property remains with the original grantee. Complete divestiture is when the remainder is divested and the property goes to the original grantee.

In this case, if the aunt moves, the daughter's remainder is divested and given to the sister. So, the daughter's interest is vested (life estate) to her aunt, but only if the Aunt moves. If the condition is met, the remainder is divested and given to the sister; if not, the remainder is still hers, but the property is given to the sister's heirs.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me think again. The daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt. The aunt's interest is a life estate to the sister. But the condition is that if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is given to the sister. So, the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but only if the aunt moves. If the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister. So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt moves.

If the condition is met, the daughter's interest is given to the sister. So, the daughter's interest is a vested remainder (life estate to her aunt) subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain the interest.

So, the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture. Because if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is divested and given to the sister. So, the daughter's interest is subject to complete divestiture.

Alternatively, if she doesn't move, the daughter's interest remains with her, but the property is given to the sister's heirs. So, the daughter's interest is a gift to the sister's heirs, but that's not a vested remainder. It's more like a gift that's subject to certain conditions.

Wait, the initial phrasing of the deed is:

"to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move."

So, if the aunt moves, the daughter doesn't have her interest. Instead, she gets the sister's heirs. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest remains with her, but the property is given to her sister's heirs.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if the aunt moves, she no longer has that. So, the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if the aunt moves, the daughter's estate is transferred to the sister. So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move.

If the condition is met, the daughter's interest is divested and given to the sister. If the condition is not met, the daughter's interest is still hers, but the property is given to the sister's heirs.

Wait, that can't be right because the sister's heirs are the descendants of the sister, not the aunt's. So, this structure is a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is that the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, which is a life estate to the sister, which is a life estate to the sister's heirs. But that doesn't explain the "if my aunt moves" part.

Hmm. Maybe it's more about the structure of the deed as a series of life estates and remainderships.

So, the initial grant is a life estate to the daughter, but only if the daughter doesn't move. If the daughter moves, then that life estate is transferred. Then, if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is transferred again. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister's heirs.

Wait, perhaps the structure is that the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister's heirs.

So, the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister's heirs.

In this case, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. If the condition is met, the daughter's interest is divested and given to the sister. If the condition is not met, the daughter's interest is transferred to the sister's heirs.

So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. If the condition is met, the daughter's life estate is divested and given to the sister. If the condition is not met, the daughter's life estate is given to the sister's heirs.

So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. So, it's a life estate subject to executory limitation.

So, the correct answer is I: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

Wait, but another perspective: The daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is transferred. So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. So, the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

Yes, that makes sense. So the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to being transferred if the condition is met. So, if the condition is met, it's divested and given to the sister. If not, it's transferred to the sister's heirs.

So, the correct term is "vested remainder subject to complete divestiture," which is option I.

Wait, but another way: the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt. If the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is given to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the daughter's interest is given to her sister's heirs. So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it. So, the daughter's interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

So, the correct answer is I.

Wait, but let me think again. The structure is:

- Daughter (life to Aunt)
- If Aunt moves: Sister (life to Aunt)
- If Aunt doesn't move: Sister's heirs.

So, if the aunt moves, the daughter's interest is gone, and the sister's heir gets the daughter's interest. If the aunt does not move, the daughter's interest is gone, and the sister's heirs get the sister's heirs. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is that the daughter's interest is a life estate to her aunt, but if the aunt moves, her interest is transferred to the sister. If the aunt doesn't move, the sister's heirs take the daughter's interest.

So, the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain it.

Therefore, the correct term is I: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

So, the answer is I.
</think>

The correct answer is **I: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture**.

### Explanation:
The deed structure describes a series of life estates and remainderships. Specifically:
- The daughter has a life estate to her aunt.
- If the aunt moves, the daughter's life estate is transferred to the sister.
- If the aunt does not move, the daughter's life estate is transferred to the sister's heirs.

This structure means that the daughter's interest is a life estate subject to the condition that the aunt must move for her to retain the interest. If the condition is met, the daughter's life estate is divested and transferred to the sister. If the condition is not met, the daughter's life estate is transferred to the sister's heirs. Therefore, the daughter's interest is best described as a **vested remainder subject to complete divestiture**. 

ANSWER: I
