Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about Malus' law. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about unpolarized light passing through multiple polarizers. The setup is that unpolarized light goes through a polarizer, then another polarizer at 30 degrees to the first, and then another at 50 degrees to the second. We need to find the percentage of the original intensity that comes out of the third polarizer.

Wait, okay. Let's start by recalling what I know about polarizers and Malus' law. Malus' law says that the intensity of the transmitted light is I = I0 * cos²(theta), where theta is the angle between the polarization direction of the light and the polarizer's axis.

So, the first step is that the light is unpolarized. The intensity before the first polarizer is I0 because unpolarized light's intensity is uniform in all directions. The first polarizer is oriented, let's say, at 0 degrees. So the light intensity after passing through the first polarizer is I1 = I0 * cos²(0°). Cos(0) is 1, so I1 is I0 * 1 = I0.

Wait, but wait, no—unpolarized light is equivalent to having a certain average direction. So the first polarizer's transmission will let I0/2 pass, right? Because for polarizing, the average intensity is ½ I0 * cos²(theta), since the average of cos²(theta) over all angles is ½. So wait, maybe I'm confusing the situation then.

Hold on, let's think step by step. 

1. Unpolarized light: Its intensity is uniform, I0. So before any polarizer, it's I0.

2. First polarizer: Its angle is theta1. Since it's the first, theta1 is 0 degrees. So cos(theta1) is 1. So the intensity after first polarizer is I1 = I0 * cos²(theta1) = I0 * 1 = I0. Wait, that's confusing because without any polarizer, intensity is I0, but with first polarizer at 0 degrees, the intensity after it would be I0 * cos²(0) = I0. So the first polarizer doesn't reduce the intensity—wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait. If it's unpolarized, the first polarizer at 0 degrees would let all the light through. So that's correct—I1 is I0.

3. Second polarizer: The angle between the first and second is 30 degrees. So theta2 = 30 degrees. The intensity after the second polarizer is I2 = I1 * cos²(theta2). So I1 is I0, theta2 is 30 degrees. Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. Squared is (3/4). So I2 = I0 * 3/4 = 0.75 I0.

Wait, but wait again. Because the intensity after the second polarizer is I2 = I1 * cos^2(theta2). But since the first polarizer is at 0 degrees (so let's say the light is incident along the x-axis), the second polarizer is at 30 degrees. So the angle theta between the second polarizer's axis and the incident light is 30 degrees.

So yes, I2 = I1 * (cos 30)^2 = I0 * (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = I0 * (3/4) = 0.75 I0.

4. Third polarizer: The angle between the second and third is 50 degrees. So theta3 is 50 degrees. So the intensity after third polarizer is I3 = I2 * cos^2(theta3).

So I2 is 0.75 I0. Theta3 is 50 degrees. Cos(50) is about 0.6428. Squared is approximately 0.4132. So I3 = 0.75 I0 * 0.4132 ≈ 0.31 I0.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The third polarizer's angle is 50 degrees relative to the second's. But what's the direction of the light coming into the third polarizer?

Wait, the first polarizer is at 0 degrees (so x-axis), the second is at 30 degrees. The third is at 50 degrees relative to the second. So the angle between the second and third is 50 degrees. That makes the third polarizer at 30 + 50 = 80 degrees, but wait, no—wait, no, I'm getting confused about how the angles are measured. Oh! So the third polarizer is positioned at 50 degrees relative to the second. But the second is at 30 degrees.

So the angle between the third polarizer's axis and the second's is 50 degrees. So the second is at 30 degrees, so third is at 30 + 50 = 80 degrees. So the angle between the third and the second is 50 degrees, which is correct.

So, the third polarizer is at 80 degrees. The light that comes in is from the second polarizer at 30 degrees. So the angle between the second and third is 50 degrees. So theta3 is 50 degrees.

So, I3 = I2 * cos^2 (50 degrees). I2 is 0.75 I0.

So cos^2(50) is (cos(50))². Let me compute that. Cos(50) is approximately 0.6428. Squared is about 0.4132. So I3 is 0.75 * 0.4132 ≈ 0.31 I0.

Wait, but wait—another approach: each polarizer reduces the intensity by a factor of cos^2(theta). So the first polarizer doesn't change the intensity (I0), the second is I0 * cos^2(30) = I0 * 0.75, and the third is (I0 * 0.75) * cos^2(50) ≈ 0.31 I0. So 31% of the original intensity, which would be approximately 31% of I0.

Looking at the options, option E is 31.0%, option J is 31.0%, so would that be the correct answer?

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the direction of the angles. Let me recheck. The second polarizer is at 30 degrees, and the third is at 50 degrees to the second. So the angle between the second and third is 50 degrees. But the third polarizer's angle from the first is 30 (second) + 50 = 80 degrees. But why did I think earlier that the third is at 30 +50? Oh, wait, because the third is placed at 50 degrees relative to the second. So the second is at 30, so third is at 30 +50 =80 degrees.

But wait, I'm not sure if that affects the calculation. Because the angle between the second and third is 50 degrees, regardless of the first's position. So the third's angle relative to the second is 50 degrees, so the calculation is correct.

So the third polarizer's angle relative to the first is 80 degrees, but the angle between the third and the second is 50 degrees. So in that case, the angle used for the third's intensity would be 50 degrees.

So the third's intensity is I3 = I2 * cos²(50 degrees). Which is 0.75 * (0.6428)^2 ≈ 0.75 * 0.4132 ≈ 0.31 I0. So 31% of the original intensity.

Looking at the options, option E is 31.0. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the first polarizer is at 0 degrees, so the light after it is I0. Then the second is at 30 degrees, so I2= I1 * cos^2(30)= I0 * (sqrt(3)/2)^2= I0*(3/4)=0.75 I0. The third is at 50 degrees from the second, so the angle between third and the first is 30+50=80 degrees. So the angle between third and second is 50 degrees. So the third is at 80 degrees from the first. But when computing the intensity through the third, it's the angle between the second and third polarizers. So yes, the angle is 50 degrees. So I3= I2 * cos^2(50)≈ 0.31 I0.

So the answer is E: 31.0.

To determine the percentage of the original intensity that exits the third polarizer, we apply Malus' law sequentially through each polarizer. 

1. **Unpolarized light**: The initial intensity is \( I_0 \).

2. **First polarizer**: The light is incident at 0 degrees, so the angle \( \theta_1 = 0^\circ \). Using Malus' law, the intensity after the first polarizer is:
   \[
   I_1 = I_0 \cos^2(0^\circ) = I_0 \cdot 1 = I_0.
   \]

3. **Second polarizer**: The second polarizer is at 30 degrees relative to the first. The angle between the light and the second polarizer is \( \theta_2 = 30^\circ \). The intensity after the second polarizer is:
   \[
   I_2 = I_1 \cos^2(30^\circ) = I_0 \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = I_0 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 I_0.
   \]

4. **Third polarizer**: The third polarizer is at 50 degrees relative to the second. The angle between the light and the third polarizer is \( \theta_3 = 50^\circ \). The intensity after the third polarizer is:
   \[
   I_3 = I_2 \cos^2(50^\circ).
   \]
   Using \( \cos(50^\circ) \approx 0.6428 \), we find:
   \[
   \cos^2(50^\circ) \approx 0.6428^2 \approx 0.4132.
   \]
   Substituting \( I_2 = 0.75 I_0 \), we get:
   \[
   I_3 = 0.75 I_0 \cdot 0.4132 \approx 0.31 I_0.
   \]

Thus, approximately 31% of the original intensity exits the third polarizer. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:
