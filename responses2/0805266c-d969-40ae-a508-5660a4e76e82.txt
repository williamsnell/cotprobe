Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about communication models, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is: Which communication model describes the encoding and decoding of messages? The options are labeled from A to J, each with a different model name.

Hmm, I remember that communication models are ways to structure how information is exchanged. I think the main ones include the Two-step flow model, which I've heard about before. Let me try to recall each model.

Option A: Uses and Gratifications model. I'm not sure about this one. It sounds like it's about behavior and needs, but I think it's more about the process of communication, not specifically encoding and decoding.

Option B: Westley and MacLean model. I don't remember this one. Maybe it's about something else, like feedback or processes in communication.

Option C: Two-step flow model. Wait, this rings a bell. I think this model describes how communication happens. It's called the Two-Step Flow because the first step is the initiator, and the second step is the receiver. So, encoding is done by the sender, and decoding by the receiver. That makes sense. So this model is about how messages are sent and received.

Option D: Osgood and Schramm model. I'm not familiar with this one. I think Osgood and Schramm are known for something else, like social networks or something else in communication theory, but I'm not sure.

Option E: Gatekeeping model. This model is more about controlling access to information. Like in healthcare, where only certain patients can have their information shared. So it's about who can receive messages, not about encoding and decoding themselves.

Option F: Cultivation Theory model. I'm not familiar with this one. Cultivation Theory is more about how information is created and spread, perhaps in the context of technology or media.

Option G: Lasswell model. I remember Lasswell's model as being about information flow. It's a component model, meaning it breaks down communication into components like sender, message, receiver, and channel. This model focuses on the flow of information, so it's about how messages are passed along, including encoding and decoding.

Option H: Shannon and Weaver model. Oh right, that's the Information Theory model. It's about the capacity of communication channels and how much information can be transmitted. Shannon's work on entropy and information was foundational here. But I'm not sure if this model specifically addresses encoding and decoding, or if it's more about the overall information exchange.

Option I: Maletzke model. I'm not sure what this one is. It might be another model, but I don't remember specifics.

Option J: Hypodermic Needle model. That's a medical term, not related to communication. So I can rule this one out.

So, the question is about encoding and decoding of messages. Let's think about the Two-step flow model. The first step is encoding, where the sender creates the message, and the second step is decoding, where the receiver interprets it. Yeah, that fits the question perfectly.

As for the Lasswell model, it's more about the structure of communication. It's a way to break down communication processes into components, which includes the encoding and decoding aspects. But the question is specifically about the model that describes those two processes.

Wait, the Lasswell model might be part of a larger model, but it's not the model itself. The Two-step flow model is the model that directly describes encoding and decoding.

So, the correct answer should be option C: Two-step flow model.

The correct answer is C: Two-step flow model. This model describes the encoding and decoding processes, where the sender encodes the message and the receiver decodes it. 

Answer: C
