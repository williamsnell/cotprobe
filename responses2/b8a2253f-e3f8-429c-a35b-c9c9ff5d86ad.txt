Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a 25.00 ml sample of sea water was titrated with 2.50 M AgNO3 solution. They used K2CrO4 as an indicator, and the endpoint was when excess Ag+ was shown by the reddish Ag2CrO4. The density of the sea water is 1.028 g/cm³. They used 53.50 ml of AgNO3. I need to find the chlorinity (which I think is the amount of chloride ions in grams per kilogram of solution) and salinity (amount of dissolved salt, probably sodium chloride, in grams per kilogram or maybe grams per liter?).

First, I remember that in titrations involving AgNO3 and K2CrO4, the reaction is between Ag+ and CrO4^2-. The reaction is 2 Ag+ + CrO4^2- → Ag2CrO4(s). So for every mole of AgNO3, it reacts with one mole of K2CrO4 to form Ag2CrO4.

Wait, but in this case, are we titrating AgNO3 with Ag2CrO4 as an indicator? So the Cl- ions in the sea water would react with Ag+ to form AgCl. The reaction is Ag+ + Cl^- → AgCl(s). So the moles of AgNO3 will equal the moles of Cl- in the sample.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the number of moles of AgNO3 used.
   The concentration is 2.50 M, volume is 53.50 ml. So moles Ag+ = M * V = 2.50 * 0.0535 = let's calculate that.

2. Since each mole of AgNO3 gives one mole of Ag+, the moles of Cl- should equal that.

3. The sample's mass can be found from the density and volume. Since density is 1.028 g/cm³, 25.00 ml is 25.00 grams? Wait, no, wait. Because 25.00 ml is 25.00 grams only if the density is 1.00 g/ml, but here it's 1.028. So mass = density * volume = 1.028 g/cm³ * 25.00 cm³ = 25.7 g. So 25.7 grams.

4. Then, chlorinity is moles of Cl- divided by the mass in kg. Because chlorinity is grams per kilogram of solution.

5. Salinity is the mass of NaCl (or the equivalent, considering the molar mass) divided by the mass in kg of solution.

Wait, wait, let me get that right. Salinity is the mass of dissolved salt (in grams) divided by the mass of the solution (in kg). Or is it mass per kg of solution? Yes, because the solution's mass is the same as the sample's mass. Because the density is given, and the sample's volume is 25.00 ml, which is 25.00 grams, so the solution's mass is 25.7 grams.

Wait, no, 25.00 ml is 25.00 cm³, which at 1.028 g/cm³ would be 25.7 grams. So the solution's mass is 25.7 grams.

So, chlorinity (Cl-) is (moles Cl-) / (25.7 g) * (1000 g/kg) to get g/kg. Because chlorinity is grams per kg.

Wait, chlorinity is (moles Cl-) / (mass in kg). Because, Chlorinity is the amount of Cl- per kilogram of solution. So, chlorinity = (moles Cl-) / (mass in kg).

Similarly, salinity is the amount of solute (in grams) per kilogram of solution. So, mass of NaCl in grams divided by kg of solution.

So, let's go step by step.

Step 1: Calculate moles of AgNO3.

Volume is 53.50 ml, which is 0.0535 L. Molarity is 2.50 M, so moles = 2.50 * 0.0535 = let's compute this.

2.50 * 0.0535 = ?

Well, 2.5 * 0.05 is 0.125, 2.5 * 0.0035 is 0.00875. So total is 0.13375 mol.

So moles of AgNO3 are 0.13375 moles.

Step 2: Since the reaction is 2 AgNO3 + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4, each mole of AgNO3 reacts with 1 mole of K2CrO4, so the moles of Cl- would be equal to moles of AgNO3.

Wait, but the chloride comes from the Cl- in the solution. So, each mole of AgNO3 gives one mole of Cl-.

So, moles of Cl- = 0.13375 mol.

Step 3: Calculate chlorinity.

Chlorinity is (moles Cl-) / (mass of solution in kg) → 0.13375 mol / 25.7 g → then convert to kg.

So 0.13375 / 25.7 = approx 0.005215 mol/kg (but wait, no, molarity is per liter, but chlorinity is per kg).

Wait, no, chlorinity is grams per kg, so:

Chlorinity (w) = (moles Cl-) / (mass of solution in kg) * 1000 g/kg to get grams.

Wait, wait, no. Chlorinity is the amount of Cl- in grams per kilogram of solution.

So, chlorinity (w) = (moles Cl-) / (mass of solution in kg) * 1000 g/kg.

Wait, perhaps better to compute as (moles Cl-) * 35.45 g/mol / (mass of solution in kg). Because Cl is 35.45 g/mol.

Wait, let me think. Chlorinity means grams of Cl- per kilogram of solution. So, chlorinity (w) = (moles Cl-) * (atomic mass Cl) / (mass of solution in kg).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, chlorinity calculation:

w = (0.13375 mol) * (35.45 g/mol) / (25.7 g) * (1000 g/kg) → wait, no, because the units need to cancel correctly.

Wait, chlorinity is (moles Cl) * (atomic mass Cl) / (mass of solution in kg). So:

w = (0.13375 mol) * 35.45 g/mol / (25.7 g) → because 25.7 g is 0.0257 kg. So to get grams per kg, we multiply by 1000.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the mass of Cl in the solution is 0.13375 * 35.45 g. Then, to find chlorinity, which is grams Cl per kg solution: (0.13375 *35.45) / 0.0257 kg → wait, because 25.7 g is 0.0257 kg.

Wait, 25.7 g is 0.0257 kg. So chlorinity = (0.13375 *35.45) / 0.0257.

Let me compute that.

0.13375 *35.45 = approximately 4.75 grams? Let me compute.

35.45 *0.1 =3.545, 0.03 *35.45=1.0635, 0.00375 *35.45=0.1346625. So total is 3.545 +1.0635=4.6085 +0.13466=4.74316 g.

So chlorinity is 4.74316 g / 0.0257 kg → 4.74316 / 0.0257 ≈ 184.6 g/kg.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because chlorinity is a small number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it more carefully.

Wait, 0.13375 mol *35.45 g/mol = 0.13375 *35.45 = let's compute that.

35.45 *0.1=3.545.

35.45 *0.03 = 1.0635.

35.45 *0.00375 = let's compute 0.003 *35.45=0.10635, 0.00075 *35.45=0.0265875. So total is 0.10635 +0.0265875=0.1329375.

Adding all parts: 3.545 +1.0635=4.6085 +0.1329375=4.7414375 g.

So chlorinity is 4.7414375 grams Cl in 25.7 grams of solution.

So chlorinity (w) = 4.7414375 g / 25.7 g *1000 g/kg → because we want grams per kg.

Wait, wait, chlorinity is grams Cl per kg solution.

So chlorinity = (4.7414375 g Cl) / (25.7 g solution) → then multiply by 1000 to get per kg.

So 4.7414375 /25.7 ≈ 0.1847 → then *1000 = 184.7 g/kg.

Wait, that's a very high chlorinity. Chlorinity is typically around 3.5% or so, but 18% seems high. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the mass of the solution. The sample is 25.00 ml of sea water, which has a density of 1.028 g/cm³. So mass is 1.028 g/ml *25.00 ml = 25.7 g. That part seems correct.

Wait, but the chloride from AgCl would contribute a certain amount. Let me think again: the moles of AgNO3 are 0.13375. Since each mole of AgNO3 gives one mole of Cl-, the moles of Cl- is 0.13375.

Chlorine's molar mass is 35.45 g/mol. So grams of Cl- is 0.13375 *35.45 ≈4.74 g.

But the solution mass is 25.7 grams, so chlorinity is 4.74 /25.7 *1000 = approx 18.47 g/kg. That's about 18.5% chlorinity. But the options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options:

Looking at option A: Chlorinity 19%.
Option B: 13%.
Option C: 22%.
So 18.5% is close to 19%, which is option A.

But wait, wait, wait a second. Chlorinity is the mass of Cl- per kilogram of solution. But in reality, chloride is a small ion, so a high chlorinity like 19% seems high. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as per the moles and then find the chlorinity. Let me think again.

Wait, chlorinity is grams of Cl- per kg of solution, correct. So, chlorinity = (moles Cl-) * (atomic weight Cl) / (mass solution in kg)

So:

(0.13375 mol) *35.45 g/mol / (25.7 g) * (1000 g/kg) → same as (0.13375 *35.45 *1000) / 25.7.

Let me compute that.

0.13375 *35.45 = 4.7414375. Multiply by 1000: 4741.4375.

Divide by 25.7: 4741.4375 /25.7 ≈ 184.7 g/kg.

Wait, same result. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects chlorinity to be in grams of Cl- per kg of solution, which is correct. So that would be about 18.5% chlorinity, but let's look at the options.

Looking at the options:

A: Chlorinity 19% → possible.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, chlorinity is expressed as per kilogram of solution, but sometimes people confuse it with grams per kg, which is the same. So 19% chlorinity would mean 19 grams per kg of solution, which is correct.

Wait, but let me cross-verify. Another approach is to calculate the chloride concentration using AgCl.

The amount of AgNO3 is 0.13375 mol. Since AgNO3 is 1:1 with Cl-,

moles of Cl- = 0.13375 mol.

Mass of Cl- is 0.13375 *35.45 = 4.741 grams.

So grams Cl- in solution is 4.741 g. The solution's mass is 25.7 g. So chlorinity is 4.741 /25.7 *1000 = 18.47 g/kg.

So, 18.47% chlorinity. Looking at the options, option A is 19%, which is close.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the 53.50 mL of AgNO3 is titrated, but the chloride concentration is given as chlorinity, which is the Cl- per kg.

Wait, but the chloride comes from the solution, which is 25.7 grams. So chlorinity is 4.741 grams Cl in 25.7 grams solution → which is 4.741 /25.7 *1000 = 18.47 grams per kg. So 18.47% chlorinity, which is about 18.5%, but the closest option is A: 19% (chlorinity 19%).

But wait, looking back, the options for chlorinity are A:19% and others. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I'm misapplying the titration. Because the reaction is AgNO3 (titrant) with K2CrO4 (indicator). So the moles of Ag+ are equal to moles of Cl-.

So, moles of Ag+ = 2.50 M * 0.0535 L = 0.13375 mol. So Cl- is 0.13375 mol.

So chlorinity (w) is (0.13375 mol *35.45 g/mol) / (25.7 g) *1000 g/kg = (4.741 g) / (25.7 g) *1000 = 184.7 g/kg.

But the options don't have 18.5% chlorinity. Oh wait, wait, no, the chlorinity is 18.5% of the solution by weight. So if the solution is 25.7 g, 18.5% is 4.74 grams. So that's correct.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is Chlorinity 19 %, which is about 18.5% (19 is close).

So the chlorinity is about 18.5% and the salinity is to be found.

Now, moving to salinity.

Salinity is the mass of dissolved salt (NaCl) in grams per kilogram of solution. So, first, I need to find the moles of NaCl in the sample.

Wait, but the sample is 25.7 grams. The NaCl comes from the chloride. The Cl- is from NaCl. So the moles of NaCl in the solution are equal to the moles of Cl-.

Wait, yes. Because NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl-.

So, moles of NaCl = moles of Cl- = 0.13375 mol.

Mass of NaCl = 0.13375 mol *58.44 g/mol.

Compute that: 0.13375 *58.44 = let's calculate.

58.44 *0.1=5.844, 58.44*0.03=1.7532, 58.44*0.00375=0.21993.

Wait, let me compute 0.13375 *58.44:

58.44 * 0.1 = 5.844

58.44 * 0.03 = 1.7532

58.44 *0.003 = 0.17532

58.44 *0.00075 = 0.04383

Adding them all: 5.844 +1.7532 =7.5972 +0.17532=7.77252 +0.04383=7.81635 grams.

So the mass of NaCl is approximately 7.816 grams.

So the solution's mass is 25.7 grams. So the mass of NaCl is 7.816 grams in 25.7 grams of solution → which is 7.816 /25.7 = 0.3067 mol per kg of solution.

Wait, no, since we're looking for grams of NaCl per kg solution, it's 7.816 grams in 25.7 grams solution, which is 7.816 /25.7 = 0.3067 grams per kg solution.

So salinity is 0.3067 g/kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is salinity 3.0% (approx 3.0), which is way lower than 0.3 g/kg.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass of NaCl. Let me recompute moles of NaCl.

Molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol. So moles of NaCl is 0.13375 mol. So mass is 0.13375 *58.44.

Let me compute 0.13375 times 58.44.

58.44 *0.1 =5.844

58.44 *0.03 =1.7532

58.44 *0.003 =0.17532

58.44 *0.00075=0.04383

Adding all: 5.844 +1.7532=7.5972 +0.17532=7.77252 +0.04383=7.81635 grams. So 7.81635 grams.

So mass of NaCl is 7.81635 grams in 25.7 grams solution → which is 7.81635 /25.7 = 0.3067 grams per kg solution. So salinity is 0.3067 g/kg → which is about 0.3 g per kg.

Looking at the options, none of the options have 0.3 g/kg. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of AgNO3: 2.50 M *0.0535 L =2.50 *0.0535.

Wait, 2.5 *0.05 is 0.125, 2.5*0.0035 is 0.00875. So sum is 0.13375 mol.

So, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the chlorinity is calculated as (moles Cl) * (atomic weight Cl)/(mass of solution in kg). So chlorinity is (0.13375 *35.45) / (25.7) *1000 grams%/(kg) → 0.13375 *35.45 = 4.742 grams Cl. So 4.742 grams Cl in 25.7 grams solution. So chlorinity is (4.742 /25.7) *1000 → (0.1846) *1000 = 184.6 g/kg, which is 18.46% chlorinity.

Hmm, but the options don't have 18.5%. The closest is option A:19%.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the chloride comes from both AgNO3 and NaCl. Wait, no, the chloride in the solution comes only from NaCl and AgCl. But in this case, since AgNO3 is titrated, the chloride is only from NaCl.

Wait, no, in the titration, AgNO3 is reacting with Cl- from NaCl. The chloride in the solution is from NaCl, so the moles of Cl- is equal to the moles of NaCl.

So, the chlorinity is (moles Cl-)* (35.45 g/mol) / (mass solution in kg) * 1000 g/kg? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, chlorinity is (moles Cl-) *35.45 g/mol / (mass solution in kg) * 1000 g/kg.

Wait, 0.13375 *35.45 = 4.7414 g Cl.

4.7414 g Cl / 25.7 g solution = 0.1846, which is 18.46% chlorinity.

But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the chlorinity is (moles Cl-) * (atomic weight Cl) / (mass solution in kg) *1000.

Wait, 0.13375 *35.45 =4.7414, 4.7414 /25.7 =0.1846, 0.1846 *1000=184.6 g/kg.

Wait, but that can't be right because chlorinity is grams per kilogram, which is the same as grams per 1000 grams.

Wait, no, chlorinity is grams per kilogram of solution. So it's correctly 0.1846 *1000 =184.6 g/kg.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molarity or calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the titration was with K2CrO4 and the chloride is determined via the dichromate titration.

Wait, but the question is about chlorinity, which is the Cl- concentration in solution. So the way to calculate it is as (moles Cl-) *35.45 g/mol / (mass solution in kg) *1000.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the chlorinity calculation because it's grams per kilogram, which is the same as grams per 1000 grams. So, chlorinity is (n * molar mass Cl) / (mass solution in kg) *1000.

Wait, let me compute chlorinity again.

n =0.13375 mol.

molar mass Cl=35.45 g/mol.

mass solution=25.7 g.

chlorinity = (0.13375 *35.45) /25.7 *1000 (to convert grams to per kilogram).

So:

(0.13375 *35.45) =4.7414 g.

Divide by 25.7: 4.7414/25.7 =0.1846.

Multiply by 1000: 184.6 g/kg.

Wait, that's 184.6 g/kg chlorinity. That's way higher than any of the options given. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps chlorinity is expressed as grams per 1000 grams of solution. So in that case, chlorinity would be 184.6 g per 1000 grams solution, which is 18.46% chlorinity.

But options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the chlorinity is calculated as the grams of Cl in the sample divided by the mass of the sample in grams, multiplied by 1000 to get %.

So chlorinity (w) = (4.7414 g Cl) / (25.7 g sample) *1000 = (4.7414 /25.7 ) *1000 ≈ (0.1846) *1000 =184.6 g/kg.

So 184.6 g/kg chlorinity. That's way higher than any options. So perhaps the problem intended chlorinity to be grams per kilogram of solution, which is 18.4% chlorinity, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula chlorinity = (moles Cl-) * (atomic mass Cl) / (mass solution in kilograms) *1000.

Wait, let's try that again.

n =0.13375 mol.

atomic mass Cl=35.45 g/mol.

mass solution=25.7 g.

chlorinity = (0.13375 *35.45) /25.7 *1000 = 4.7414 /25.7 *1000 = same as before, 184.6 g/kg.

Hmm, this seems correct. But the options don't have 184.6%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of AgNO3. Let me double-check.

2.50 M AgNO3 *0.0535 L = 2.50 *0.0535=0.13375 mol. Correct.

So perhaps the chlorinity is 18.4%, but the options don't have that. So the closest option is A:19% chlorinity.

But then, the question is about chlorinity, which is grams per kilogram of solution. So 18.4% chlorinity is correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass of the sample is 25.7 grams, but the chloride concentration is calculated as (moles Cl) * (atomic mass Cl) / (mass of sample in kg) *1000.

Wait, (0.13375 *35.45) / (25.7) *1000 = 184.6 g/kg.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration in grams per 1000 grams of solution, which would be 18.46% (18.46% solution).

But the options don't have that. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the correct chlorinity is 18.5%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is A:19% chlorinity.

Wait, but then again, maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the amount of chloride is determined by the amount of AgCl formed, which is 2.50 M *0.0535 L =0.13375 mol. So the mass of AgCl is 0.13375 *143.32 = approx 19.2 grams.

So AgCl's mass is 19.2 g.

The mass of Cl- in AgCl is 19.2 g (since AgCl is 1:1 with Cl-).

But the solution's mass is 25.7 grams.

So chlorinity would be (19.2 g Cl-)/(25.7 g solution)*1000=75.0 g/kg.

Wait, but that's 75% chlorinity, which is way higher than any option.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the chloride concentration is determined by the amount of NaCl formed, which is 0.13375 mol. So mass NaCl is 0.13375 *58.44 =7.816 g. So the solution's mass is 25.7 g.

So chlorinity is (7.816 g Cl-)/(25.7 g solution)*1000=30.65 g/kg.

Which is 30.65% chlorinity. Still no match.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about the chloride concentration, which is the moles of Cl- per volume of solution.

Wait, but I think I've been overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the chlorinity is calculated as (moles of Cl-) * (atomic mass Cl) / (mass of solution in kg) *1000.

Which is 0.13375 *35.45 /25.7 *1000 = (4.7414 /25.7) *1000 =184.6 g/kg.

Hmm.

So perhaps the answer is option A: chlorinity 19% and salinity 3.4% (salinity is 0.3067 g/kg, but perhaps in the options, it's presented differently).

Wait, the options for chlorinity are:

A:19% chlorinity

C:22% chlorinity

E:27% chlorinity

So option A is 19% chlorinity.

But according to our calculation, chlorinity is 18.46% chlorinity, which is about 18.5%.

So the closest option is A:19% chlorinity.

So perhaps the answer is option A.

But then, the salinity calculation is about 0.3 g/kg, which isn't listed. So perhaps the options are presented in a way that some of the options are decimal points.

Wait, perhaps the chlorinity options are given as percentages, and the correct answer is A:19% chlorinity.

So I think the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The problem involves determining the chlorinity and salinity of a sample of sea water. Here's the analysis:

---

### **Chlorinity Calculation**

1. **Moles of AgNO₃**:  
   The concentration of AgNO₃ is 2.50 M, and the volume is 53.50 mL (0.0535 L).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of AgNO₃} = 2.50 \, \text{M} \times 0.0535 \, \text{L} = 0.13375 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of Cl⁻**:  
   The reaction between AgNO₃ and K₂CrO₄ involves the reaction of Ag⁺ with CrO₄²⁻ to form Ag₂CrO₄, which is further reacted with Cl⁻ to form AgCl. However, for the purpose of calculating chlorinity, the moles of Cl⁻ are directly determined by the moles of Ag⁺:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Cl⁻} = 0.13375 \, \text{mol}.

3. **Chlorinity (w)**:  
   Chlorinity is defined as the mass of dissolved chloride (Cl⁻) in grams per kilogram of solution. The mass of the solution is given as 25.7 g.  
   \[
   w = \frac{(\text{Moles of Cl⁻}) \times (\text{Atomic weight of Cl})}{\text{Mass of solution (g)}} \times 1000.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   w = \frac{0.13375 \times 35.45}{25.7} \times 1000 = 184.6 \, \text{g/kg}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to approximately 18.46% chlorinity.  

4. **Closest Option**:  
   The closest option to 18.46% chlorinity is **A: 19% chlorinity**.

### **Salinity Calculation**

1. **Mass of NaCl**:  
   The moles of NaCl are equal to the moles of Cl⁻.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of NaCl} = 0.13375 \, \text{mol} \times 58.44 \, \text{g/mol} = 7.816 \, \text{g}.
   \]  
   The mass of the solution is 25.7 g.  

2. **Salinity (s)**:  
   Salinity is defined as the mass of dissolved salt (NaCl) in grams per kilogram of solution:  
   \[
   s = \frac{\text{Mass of NaCl}}{\text{Mass of solution (g)}} \times 1000.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   s = \frac{7.816}{25.7} \times 1000 = 30.65 \, \text{g/kg}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to approximately 3.065% salinity.  

3. **Closest Option**:  
   While the exact value is 3.065%, none of the provided options match this value. However, the chlorinity option (A: 19% chlorinity) is the most reasonable choice based on the chlorinity calculation.
