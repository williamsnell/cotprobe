Okay, so I have to figure out how much heat is produced by an electric iron in 5 minutes when it's drawing 5 amperes from a 120-volt line. Hmm, I remember something about electrical power and heat from my physics class. Let me try to recall the formula.

Oh right, electrical power (P) is given by P = IV, where I is current and V is voltage. So in this case, the current is 5 A and voltage is 120 V. So P should be 5 * 120, which is 600 watts. Wait, but wait, power is in watts, which is joules per second. But the question is about heat production, so maybe it's the same as electrical power here because electrical energy is converted into heat.

So power (P) is 600 W. Now, they're asking for the heat produced over 5 minutes. Oh, right! I need to convert time into seconds. Five minutes is 5 * 60 = 300 seconds.

So the energy (E) is power multiplied by time. So E = P * t = 600 W * 300 s. Let me compute that: 600 * 300 is 180,000 joules. Wait, but the question asks for calories. Oh yeah, I remember that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So to convert joules to calories, I should divide by 4.184.

So 180,000 / 4.184. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 4.184 * 42,000 would be about 175, 4.184 * 42,000 = 4.184 * 4.2e4. 4.184 * 42,000 = 4.184 * 4.2 * 1e4 = (17.5728) * 1e4 = 175,728 joules. So 180,000 /4.184 is approximately 42,735 joules in calories. Wait, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, 600 W * 300 s = 180,000 J. Then 180,000 J * (1 cal /4.184 J) = 180,000 /4.184 cal. Let me compute 180,000 ÷4.184. Well, 4.184 * 42,000 = 175,  I think 4.184 * 42,000 is 175, 728 as I said earlier. Wait, 42,000 *4.184 = let me compute it step by step. 42,000 *4 = 168,000; 42,000 *0.184= 7,728. So total 175,728 J. So 42,000 cal is 175,728 J. But we have 180,000 J. So 180,000-175,728 =4,272 J left. 4,272 J is how many calories? 4,272 /4.184 ≈1024 cal. So total is about 42,000 + 1024 =43,024 cal. Hmm, but that's the exact number, but wait, the options don't include 43,024. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:72,000; B:80,000; C:36,000; D:65,000; E:54,000; F:43,000; G:60,000; H:50,000; I:54,000; J:30,000.

So the closest would be option F:43,000 calories. But wait, maybe I should recheck the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let me redo the calculation. Oh wait, perhaps I got the time in seconds wrong. Because 5 minutes is definitely 300 seconds, that's correct. So 600 W *300 s =180,000 J. 180,000 /4.184 = approx 42,735 J. Then 42,735 /4.184 cal. Wait, 42,735 /4.184 is approximately 10,214 calories? Or wait, wait, no, I think I got the units mixed. Because 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so to get the number of calories, you divide by 4.184. So 180,000 /4.184 is approximately 42,735 J, which is 42,735 /4.184 cal. Let me compute that: 42,735 ÷4.184. Let me see, 4.184 * 10,000 is 41,840. 42,735 -41,840= 895. Then 895 ÷4.184 ≈214. So total is approximately 10,214 cal. So that's 10,214 calories. Wait, but wait, that can't be because the options don't have that. Let me check all the options again.

Option F is 43,000. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Oh wait, I forgot that power is in watts, which is per second, so 600 W is 600 J/s. So over 300 seconds, that's 600 * 300 = 180,000 J. 180,000 J converted to calories is 180,000 /4.184 ≈ 42,735 cal, which is approximately 43,000. So option F is 43,000. But let me think again: is the question about heat or just the electrical energy? Oh, yes, since it's an electric iron, the energy is converted into heat, so the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but I remember that electrical energy can also be converted into light or other forms, but the question says heat. So the only source of heat is the electrical energy. So the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer should be F:43,000 calories.

Wait, but the options are in whole numbers, and 42,735 is about 43,000, so F is the right choice.

To determine how much heat is produced by an electric iron in 5 minutes, we start with the given data:

- **Voltage (V):** 120 V
- **Current (I):** 5 A
- **Time (t):** 5 minutes = 5 × 60 = 300 seconds

### Step 1: Calculate Power (P)
The power (P) is given by the formula:
\[
P = IV
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P = 5 \, \text{A} \times 120 \, \text{V} = 600 \, \text{W}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Energy (E)
Energy (E) is the product of power and time:
\[
E = P \times t
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E = 600 \, \text{W} \times 300 \, \text{s} = 180,000 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Convert Joules to Calories
The conversion factor between joules and calories is:
\[
1 \, \text{calorie} \approx 4.184 \, \text{joules}
\]
Thus, the energy in calories is:
\[
E_{\text{cal}} = \frac{180,000 \, \text{J}}{4.184 \, \text{J/calorie}} \approx 42,735 \, \text{calories}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the Closest Option
The calculation yields approximately 42,735 calories, which is closest to option **F: 43,000 calories**.
