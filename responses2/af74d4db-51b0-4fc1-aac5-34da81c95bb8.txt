Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"XI. As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.
XIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.
XXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&â€¦
XXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things."
Francis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620
By the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning reflected in the passage had undergone which of the following changes?

Options:

A: It had been expanded upon to include non-empirical forms of reasoning.
B: It had become a core principle of European culture.
C: It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.
D: It was only used in select areas of academic study.
E: It had been replaced entirely by a different method of reasoning.
F: It had become so widely accepted that it was no longer questioned.
G: It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.
H: It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.
I: It had been altered to incorporate religious beliefs into the scientific process.
J: It had been completely dismissed by the scientific community.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Francis Bacon's work in the "Novum Organum" and how his methods have changed by the 1800s. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is asking about changes to Bacon's method of empirical reasoning by the 1800s. The options are A to J, each describing a different change. I need to figure out which one is correct.

I remember that Bacon's method involves two main approaches. The first is hasty generalizations, where you make broad statements based on limited evidence. The second is the scientific method, which starts with specific observations and moves towards general principles.

Looking at the passage, it talks about both methods. The passage mentions that each begins with sensory and particular observations, but one is more incremental (method II) while the other is more direct (method I). However, the passage doesn't mention any changes to these methods; it's just explaining them.

The question is about the passage reflecting changes in the 1800s. I think I remember that by the 1800s, empirical methods were being adopted more widely. So perhaps the passage is talking about the shift from Baconian methods to more modern scientific practices.

Let me think about the options again. Option A says the method had been expanded to include non-empirical reasoning. That doesn't seem to fit because the passage is about expanding methods, not introducing new ones. Or is it? I'm not sure. Option B says it became a core principle, but that's more about how it's used, not necessarily a change in its structure. Option C talks about stagnation, which doesn't fit. Option D says it was only used in select areas, which is more of a personal perspective rather than a change in method. Option E suggests the method was replaced by a different approach, but I don't recall that happening. Option F: it became widely accepted so it's no longer questioned. I think that's true because the scientific method was popularized and became the standard, but I'm not sure if it was entirely replaced.

Option G says it was refined by many and became unrecognizable to Bacon. That doesn't sound right. Option H mentions incorporating religious beliefs, which isn't part of Bacon's approach. Option J is dismissed by the scientific community, which is incorrect because Bacon's method was eventually integrated into modern science.

So, what's the correct answer? The passage is about the methods, not the method itself. By the 1800s, empirical methods have become more accepted, so option F says it became widely accepted so it's no longer questioned. That makes sense because the scientific method was a major shift, so the 1800s saw its expansion and acceptance.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the passage refers to the passage's content changing or if it's about the passage being about the passage. The passage is just explaining Bacon's methods, so it's not about changes in his methods, but about the passage's content in the 1800s. But the question is about the passage's changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage's content was already covering empirical methods, so by the 1800s, it's described as a core principle. But I'm not certain. I think the passage is explaining how his methods were, not that they've changed.

Wait, but the question is about the method's changes by 1800s. So the answer is F because the method was widely accepted, so it's no longer questioned. So the answer should be F.

By the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning, as described in "Novum Organum," had become widely accepted and widely used as a core principle in European culture. This acceptance led to it being no longer questioned. 

**Answer: F**
