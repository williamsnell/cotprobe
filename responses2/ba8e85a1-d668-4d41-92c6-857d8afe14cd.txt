Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about entropy change when a gas expands. Hmm, let's see. The setup is a hydrogen gas in a cylinder with a piston. The cylinder has a cross-section of 5 cm². At room temperature, 25°C, it exerts a pressure of 2 atm and occupies 500 cm³. The question is about the change in entropy when the piston is withdrawn isothermally through a length of 100 cm. Oh wait, and I need to find the change in entropy, right?

I remember that entropy change for an isothermal process depends only on the change in volume. The formula for entropy change is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) when pressure is constant. But wait, in this case, the process is isothermal, so temperature remains the same. But the volume isn't changing? Or wait, the problem says the piston is withdrawn through a length of 100 cm. So the volume increases. Because the piston moving out would mean the volume of the gas increases.

So first, let me find out the initial and final volumes. The initial volume is 500 cm³. The cross-sectional area is 5 cm². The piston moves 100 cm, so the change in length is 100 cm. Since the area is 5 cm², the change in volume is area multiplied by the change in length. Oh wait, because each cm of movement would add an area of 5 cm² * 1 cm =5 cm³. So for 100 cm, it's 100 *5=500 cm³ change. So the final volume is initial volume plus 500 cm³? Wait no, wait, because the piston is moving outwards, so the volume increases. So 500 + 500 = 1000 cm³. So V1 is 500, V2 is 1000.

Wait, no. Because the movement of the piston is from the initial position. Wait, initial volume is 500 cm³. The piston is 5 cm². So when you push the piston, each cm you move it adds 5 cm³ to the volume. So moving 100 cm would add 500 cm³, so V2 is 500 +500=1000. So yes, V2 is 1000 cm³.

So the entropy change would be ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1). But wait, I don't know n. Hmm. How can I find n? Because the pressure is given as 2 atm. Oh, right, we can find n using the ideal gas law. PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT).

Let me compute that. P is 2 atm. V is 500 cm³, which is 500 * 1e-6 m³. Wait, wait, units are important. Let me think about the units. R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K). But I need to make sure the units are compatible.

Wait, 2 atm. I should convert that into pascals. Because R is usually in J/(mol·K), which is m³·Pa/(mol·K). Oh yes, because 1 atm is about 101325 Pascals. So 2 atm is 2 * 101325 = 202650 Pa. 

So V in m³ is 500 cm³ = 500 * 1e-6 m³ = 0.0005 m³. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). T is 25°C, which is 298.15 K.

So n = PV/(RT) = (202650 Pa * 0.0005 m³) / (8.314 * 298.15)

Let me calculate the numerator first: 202650 * 0.0005 = 101.325 J.

Denominator: 8.314 * 298.15 ≈ let's compute that. 8 * 300 is 2400, but more accurately:

298.15 *8.314 = Let's compute 298 *8.314.

298 *8 = 2384; 298 *0.314 ≈ 93.772. So 2384 + 93.772 = 2477.772. But wait, it's 298.15, so 298.15 *8.314 = approx 2477. Let's see, maybe better to compute exactly.

Wait, wait, 298.15 *8 = 2385.2; 298.15 *0.314 = 298.15 *0.3 = 89.445; 298.15 *0.014=4.1741. So 89.445 +4.1741=93.6191. So total is 2385.2 +93.6191=2478.8191.

So denominator is about 2478.82 J/(mol·K) * K (because T is in K, so units are J/(mol)), so denominator is 2478.82 J/mol.

So n = 101.325 / 2478.82 ≈ 0.04098 mol. Approximately 0.041 mol.

So n is about 0.04098 mol.

Now, the entropy change is ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1). 

V2 is 1000 cm³, V1 is 500. So V2/V1 is 2.

So ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So ΔS = 0.04098 * 8.314 * 0.6931.

Let me compute that.

First, compute 0.04098 *8.314. Let's see: 0.04 *8.314 is 0.33256. 0.00098 *8.314 ≈0.00814772. Adding them gives 0.3407077.

Then multiply by 0.6931: 0.3407077 *0.6931 ≈ let's compute.

Compute 0.3 *0.6931 =0.20793. 0.0407 *0.6931 = approx 0.02823. So total is 0.20793 +0.02823 ≈ 0.23616.

Wait, but wait: 0.3407077 *0.6931.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation.

0.3407077 *0.6931.

Let me compute 0.34 *0.6931 = 0.235654.

Then 0.0007077 *0.6931 ≈ 0.000491. So total is approximately 0.235654 +0.000491 = 0.236145 J/(mol·K).

So the entropy change is approximately 0.236 J/K.

But looking at the options: 

Options are A:0.04, B:0.44, C:0.74, D:0.34, E:0.94, F:0.64, G:0.14, H:0.24, I:0.54, J:0.84.

So my computed value is about 0.236, which is closest to option H:0.24.

Wait, but wait, is this correct? Because another approach: sometimes the formula is written as nR ln(V2/V1) when the process isn't isothermal, but wait in this case, the process is isothermal. So the formula applies.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Another thought: did I use the right formula?

Wait, the formula for entropy change when pressure is constant (or volume is changing) is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1). But wait, that's when the process is isothermal. So that's correct.

Wait, but I think that in some cases, ΔS can also be expressed using pressure changes. So another formula is ΔS = -nR ln(P2/P1). But since in this case, V is increasing, P is decreasing. Let me check.

Wait, the given pressure was 2 atm, but after expansion, the pressure would change because the volume increases. But wait, in the problem statement, have we considered whether the pressure is constant or not?

Wait, the problem says the process is isothermal through expansion. So the temperature is constant. The pressure and volume are changing, but T is fixed.

So, I think the correct formula is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), so 0.236 J/K.

But looking at the options, the closest is H:0.24.

So the answer would be H.

Wait, but could I have made a mistake in calculating n? Let me double-check.

n = (P V)/(R T) = (2 atm * 500 cm³) / (8.314 * 298.15 K).

Wait, but wait, I converted 2 atm to Pascals correctly? 2 atm is 2 * 101325 = 202650 Pa.

But wait, in the formula, PV should be in J. So 202650 Pa * 500e-6 m³ = (202650 *500e-6) J.

Wait, 500e-6 m³ is 500 * 0.000001 = 0.0005 m³.

So 202650 * 0.0005 = 101.325 J. Correct.

R is 8.314, T is 298.15. So 8.314 *298.15 ≈ 2478.8 J/(mol·K).

So n = 101.325 / 2478.8 ≈ 0.04098 mol.

So that's correct. So then the calculation for ΔS is 0.04098 *8.314 * ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is 0.6931.

So 0.04098 * 8.314 = 0.3407 J/(mol·K).

Multiply by 0.6931: 0.3407 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.236 J/K.

So the correct answer is approximately 0.24 J/K. So the option is H:0.24.

To determine the change in entropy of the hydrogen gas during the isothermal expansion, we use the formula for entropy change during an isothermal process:

\[
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles (\(n\))
Using the ideal gas law \(PV = nRT\), where \(P = 2 \, \text{atm} = 202650 \, \text{Pa}\), \(V_1 = 500 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0005 \, \text{m}^3\), \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}\), and \(T = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K}\):

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(202650 \, \text{Pa})(0.0005 \, \text{m}^3)}{(8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)})(298.15 \, \text{K})}
\]

\[
n = \frac{101.325 \, \text{J}}{2478.8 \, \text{J/mol}} \approx 0.04098 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the entropy change
The volume increases from \(V_1 = 500 \, \text{cm}^3\) to \(V_2 = 500 \, \text{cm}^3 + 500 \, \text{cm}^3 = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3\). Thus, the volume ratio is:

\[
\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{1000}{500} = 2
\]

The entropy change is then:

\[
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) = (0.04098 \, \text{mol})(8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)})(\ln 2)
\]

Using \(\ln 2 \approx 0.6931\):

\[
\Delta S = (0.04098)(8.314)(0.6931) \approx 0.236 \, \text{J/K}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated entropy change is approximately \(0.236 \, \text{J/K}\), which is closest to option **H: 0.24 JK\(^{-1}\)**.
