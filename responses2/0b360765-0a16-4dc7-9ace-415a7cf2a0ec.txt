Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of azomethane. I'm a bit rusty on my kinetics, but let me think through this.

The question says it's a first-order decomposition at 600 K. The original concentration decreases to half its value in 30 minutes. Wait, so that's the half-life, right? Because the half-life is the time it takes for the concentration to drop to half. So for a first-order reaction, the half-life is constant. That's good.

Now the question is, after 60 minutes have elapsed, what percentage remains? So I need to find the remaining concentration after 60 half-lives? Wait no, 60 minutes divided by 30 minutes per half-life is two half-lives. So two half-lives have passed.

Wait, for a first-order reaction, the formula for the remaining concentration is [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt), or alternatively, it can be expressed in terms of the half-life. I remember that the formula can also be written as [A] = [A]₀ * (1/2)^(n), where n is the number of half-lives. Since each half-life reduces the concentration by half.

So after one half-life (30 min), [A] is 1/2 of [A]₀. After two half-lives (60 min), it's (1/2)^2, which is 1/4. Wait, so 25% remains? But wait, looking at the options, I see option E is 1/4, which would be 25%.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's go through the steps again. The time elapsed is 60 minutes. Since each half-life is 30 minutes, that's two half-lives. So the decomposition occurs twice.

So first half-life: concentration is 50% (1/2). Second half-life: 50% of 50% is 25% (1/4). So yes, 25% remains. So the remaining concentration is 1/4 of the original, which is option E, 1/4.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the formula for first-order reactions is usually [A] = [A]₀ e^(-kt). Another approach is using the integrated rate law: ln([A]/[A]₀) = -kt. The half-life t_1/2 is (ln 2)/k. So t_1/2 is 30 minutes in this case.

So, for 60 minutes, which is two half-lives, the concentration would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, 25% remains.

Looking at the options, E is 1/4. So the correct answer must be option E.

The problem involves the first-order decomposition of azomethane at 600 K, where the concentration decreases to half its value in 30 minutes. This indicates that the half-life of the reaction is 30 minutes. The question asks for the percentage of azomethane remaining after 60 minutes, which is equivalent to two half-lives.

For a first-order reaction, the remaining concentration after \( n \) half-lives is given by:

\[
[A] = [A]_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n
\]

Here, \( n = 2 \) (since 60 minutes corresponds to two half-lives), so:

\[
[A] = [A]_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = [A]_0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}
\]

This means that 25% of the azomethane remains after 60 minutes. Among the provided options, the correct answer is **1/4**.
