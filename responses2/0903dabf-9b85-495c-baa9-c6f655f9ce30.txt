Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Articles of Confederation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Articles of Confederation.

The Articles of Confederation were the foundational documents that formed the U.S. government before it was divided into three branches. So, under this system, the national government had certain powers. Now, I remember that the original Articles didn't have a separate federal government, meaning the power to regulate interstate commerce and set laws was all in the state governments. 

Looking at the options, the question asks what the national government had under these articles. The options are A through G. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Abolish state governments. That doesn't sound right. The articles didn't abolish them; in fact, they expanded their power. So I can rule this out.

Option B: Regulate interstate commerce. The Constitution has the power for states to regulate interstate commerce, but the Articles of Confederation didn't. So I think B isn't correct.

Option C: Establish a federal judiciary. The Articles of Confederation didn't have a federal court system. The federal government only existed in the form of the state governments. So C is probably not correct either.

Option D: Negotiate treaties. I'm pretty sure the Articles didn't allow the national government to negotiate treaties. The federal government only had authority through the states to negotiate.

Option E: Enforce its laws. This seems right. Under the Articles, the national government could enforce its laws and pass them on. So E is a strong candidate.

Option F: Directly elect the President. No, the Articles of Confederation didn't grant this power. The Constitution does, but the Articles themselves didn't. So F is out.

Option G: Implement a federal education system. That's a bit vague, but I'm not sure if the Articles allowed that. I think the federal education system is part of the federal government, which isn't the case under the Articles. So G isn't correct.

So reviewing, the only option left is E, which says the national government could enforce its laws. That aligns with what I remember about the Articles of Confederation. They did have some powers, but not all like the federal authority that the Constitution does.

The correct answer is E: Enforce its laws. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question pertains to the Articles of Confederation, which formed the U.S. government before it was divided into branches. The national government under these articles did not have a federal judiciary, nor did it have powers like regulating interstate commerce or negotiating treaties.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect, as the Articles of Confederation did not abolish state governments.
   - **B**: Incorrect, as they did not regulate interstate commerce; the Constitution does.
   - **C**: Incorrect, as they did not establish a federal judiciary.
   - **D**: Incorrect, as they did not negotiate treaties; federal authority is held by the states.
   - **E**: Correct, as the national government could enforce its laws.
   - **F**: Incorrect, as the Articles did not directly elect the President.
   - **G**: Incorrect, as the federal education system is part of federal authority, not the national government.

3. **Conclusion**: The only accurate statement is that the national government could enforce its laws, making E the correct answer.
