Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the Inca's wars. Let's see, the question is asking why the Incas fought so many wars, and the options are A to E. I remember the Incas had a lot of conflicts, so their motivation must be something related to their internal needs or external circumstances.

Option A says it's to demonstrate military prowess. That makes sense because if you have a strong army, you'd need to fight to show your strength. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the main reason. They were very strategic and had a lot of conflicts, but maybe it's more about their resources and the environment.

Option B is about expanding their empire's territory. The Incas were a large empire, so expanding territory would be part of their strategy, but the question is about the wars, not the expansion issue.

Option C suggests unity through a common enemy. That rings a bell. The Incas often fought against various enemies, like the Hittites, the Hun, the Pameander, and Pachacuti, and they were united against them. So fighting wars was part of their strategy to unite their people and maintain dominance.

Option D is about cultivating talented leaders. The Incas had a system where they selected leaders, but why would they fight many wars to do that? It seems like fighting was more for survival and strategy, not necessarily for producing leaders.

Option E is about gaining control of resources. That's more about economic factors, not directly about the wars themselves.

So, putting it together, the main reason for fighting many wars was likely to unite their population and achieve dominance, which aligns with option C. They were fighting to maintain control and protect their neighbors, which made sense because they were facing various external threats.
