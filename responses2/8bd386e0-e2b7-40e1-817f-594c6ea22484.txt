Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about hypotheses for a department store's claim. Let me read it again:

"The department store claims that over 60 percent of the mall’s visitors shop at that store. Let p = the proportion of the mall’s visitors who shop at the store. Which pair of hypotheses should be used to support this claim?"

The options are from A to J, each offering different pairs of hypotheses. I'm supposed to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that hypotheses in statistics are structured to test a claim. The claim here is that p, which is the proportion of mall visitors who shop at the store, is more than 60%. So, p > 0.60.

Now, when setting up a hypothesis test, the null hypothesis (H0) is usually a statement of equality because it's easier to test. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is the statement you want to prove, which in this case is p > 0.60.

Looking at the options:

Option A: H0: p ≠ 0.60; Ha: p > 0.60. Hmm, that's not right because the null should be p = 0.60, not ≠. Also, the alternative is p > 0.60, which sounds correct, but the null isn't equal. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: H0: p < 0.60; Ha: p = 0.60. No, that's testing whether p is exactly 0.60, which is the opposite of what we want. Also, the alternative isn't p > 0.60. So B is wrong.

Option C: H0: p = 0.60; Ha: p = 0.60. Wait, that's just stating equality, which doesn't make sense for a hypothesis test. Hypotheses should have an inequality for the alternative. So C is wrong.

Option D: H0: p > 0.60; Ha: p = 0.60. Again, the null is p > 0.60, which is the opposite of what we want. The alternative should be p ≠ 0.60 or p < 0.60, but the question is about supporting the claim. So this is testing the opposite of the claim, so D is wrong.

Option E: H0: p ≤ 0.60; Ha: p = 0.60. So the null is p ≤ 0.60, meaning the proportion is 60% or less. The alternative is p = 0.60. That would be testing whether the proportion is exactly 60%, which isn't what we want. Also, the alternative doesn't cover the alternative hypothesis of p > 0.60. So E is wrong.

Option F: H0: p = 0.60; Ha: p ≠ 0.60. Oh wait, that's testing whether p is not 0.60. But the claim is that p is > 0.60. So this is a two-tailed test. However, the question is about supporting the claim, which implies a one-tailed test. So F is testing the opposite of the claim, which isn't correct.

Option G: H0: p ≤ 0.60; Ha: p > 0.60. So here, the null is p ≤ 0.60, and the alternative is p > 0.60. That's a one-tailed test where we're testing if the proportion is greater than 60%, which aligns with the store's claim. So this seems correct.

Option H: H0: p < 0.60; Ha: p > 0.60. Hmm, this tests whether p is greater than 0.60. The alternative is correct, but the null is p < 0.60. But the claim is p > 0.60, so this would support the claim only if the alternative is p > 0.60. So this is a good choice, but wait, does it match the null correctly?

Wait, the null should be the status quo. The claim is p >0.60, so the alternative should be p >0.60. So this is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which pair supports the claim. So the alternative should be p > 0.60.

So I'll look at the options again:

Option G: H0: p ≤ 0.60; Ha: p > 0.60. So this would mean that if the alternative is p >0.60, the null is p being 60% or less. So that's a one-tailed test, which is the correct approach.

Option H: H0: p < 0.60; Ha: p >0.60. This is testing if p is greater than 0.60, which supports the claim. But wait, the null is p < 0.60, which is a one-tailed test, but the claim is p >0.60.

So both G and H are possible. Wait, but the alternative is p >0.60, so the correct setup is H0: p ≤0.60 and Ha: p >0.60.

Wait, but option H is H0: p <0.60, which is a one-tailed test, but the claim is p>0.60. So perhaps option G is correct.

Wait, but what about H's alternative: Ha: p>0.60, and the null is p <0.60. So that's a two-tailed test? No, wait, it's a one-tailed test. No, wait, no. H is testing whether p is greater than 0.60. The null is p <0.60; so that's a one-tailed test where the alternative is p>0.60. So this setup is correct.

So why is option G correct and option H also correct? Because both options G and H are testing p>0.60. But I think the problem is whether the null is correctly set.

Wait, the question states that we need to support the claim that more than 60% shop. So the alternative should be p>0.60.

So which option correctly sets up the test with the alternative as p>0.60?

Option G: H0: p ≤ 0.60; Ha: p>0.60.

Option H: H0: p<0.60; Ha: p>0.60.

Both are testing p>0.60. H0 in G is p ≤0.60, which includes the null and alternative. H0 is the status quo, which in this case is the null.

So which is better? Both are testing the same as per the claim.

Wait, but the alternative hypothesis in G is p>0.60, which directly supports the claim. The alternative in H is also p>0.60.

So both G and H are correct. But the options don't have both; each option is a pair.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option G: H0: p ≤ 0.60; Ha: p >0.60.

Option H: H0: p <0.60; Ha: p>0.60.

Both are correct in testing the alternative, but the question is whether the alternative is correctly set to p>0.60.

The problem is, the correct test would have the null as p ≤ 0.60 and the alternative as p>0.60.

But looking at the options, option G has H0 as p ≤ 0.60 and Ha as p>0.60, which is correct.

Wait, but what about option H? It's H0: p <0.60 and Ha: p>0.60. This is testing whether p is greater than 0.60, but the null is p <0.60, which is a two-tailed test? No, wait, the null is p <0.60, and the alternative is p>0.60. So it's actually a one-tailed test, but the alternative is p>0.60. So that is correct for supporting the claim.

Wait, but another thought: the question is about testing whether the proportion is more than 60%. So the correct null is H0: p ≤0.60 and alternative Ha: p>0.60.

So which option is that? Looking at the options, that's option G.

Wait, but some might argue that the alternative should be p≠0.60, but that's not the case. The question is about supporting that more than 60% shop, so the alternative is p>0.60, not p≠0.60. Thus, the correct pair is G.

Wait, but looking at the options again, why is option H also a possible correct option?

Wait, let's think about option H. H0 is p<0.60 and Ha is p>0.60. So this test is a one-tailed test, but the alternative is p>0.60, which supports the claim. However, the null is p<0.60, which is a two-tailed test. Wait, no. H is testing whether the proportion is greater than 0.60, so the null is p <0.60, alternative p>0.60. So this is a one-tailed test, which is appropriate.

So both option G and H are correct, but wait, no. Because option H's alternative is p>0.60, same as G. But wait, the question is about the correct setup.

Wait, let me think again. The question is, which pair should be used to support the claim that more than 60% shop at the store.

So in hypothesis testing, the alternative should be the direction we want to test for. So we want to test if p>0.60. The null is the opposite, p≤0.60.

So option G is correct. Option H is testing p>0.60 as alternative, but the null is p<0.60. So that's also a correct setup. Wait, no, because in option H, the alternative is p>0.60, same as G. So both G and H are testing the same alternative.

Wait, no, looking at the options, I'm getting confused. Let's make a table:

Option | H0 | Ha
--- | --- | ---
A | p≠0.60 | p>0.60
B | p<0.60 | p=0.60
C | p=0.60 | p=0.60
D | p>0.60 | p=0.60
E | p≤0.60 | p=0.60
F | p=0.60 | p≠0.60
G | p≤0.60 | p>0.60
H | p<0.60 | p>0.60
I | p<0.60 | p>0.60
J | p>0.60 | p=0.60

So the claim is p>0.60. So the correct setup is to test p>0.60 as alternative. The null is p ≤0.60.

Looking at the options, G is H0: p ≤0.60; Ha: p>0.60.

H is H0: p<0.60; Ha:p>0.60.

So both G and H are testing the same alternative (p>0.60) but with different nulls.

Wait, but the question is which pair supports the claim. The correct setup is G.

Because in G, the alternative is p>0.60, which directly supports the claim. So option G is correct.

Wait, but another thought: option H is H0: p<0.60 and Ha: p>0.60. So the alternative is p>0.60. So both G and H are correct. But looking at the options, each option is a pair. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is G because it's the standard test of p>0.60 with a two-tailed alternative.

Wait no, the alternative in G is p>0.60, which is a one-tailed test, correct.

So the correct pair is G: H0: p ≤0.60; Ha: p>0.60.

To determine which hypothesis pair supports the claim that over 60% of mall visitors shop at the store, we need to set up a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is **p > 0.60** and the null hypothesis is **p ≤ 0.60**. This setup ensures that we are testing whether the proportion of shoppers is indeed greater than 60%.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (H0: p ≠ 0.60, Ha: p > 0.60):** Incorrect because the null hypothesis is not set to equality; it should be **p = 0.60**. Also, the alternative hypothesis should be **p > 0.60**, not **p ≠ 0.60**.
- **Option B (H0: p < 0.60, Ha: p = 0.60):** Incorrect because the alternative hypothesis should be **p > 0.60** to support the claim, not **p = 0.60**. The null hypothesis is also incorrectly set to **p < 0.60**.
- **Option C (H0: p = 0.60, Ha: p = 0.60):** Incorrect as it sets both hypotheses to equality, which is not a valid test for this claim.
- **Option D (H0: p > 0.60, Ha: p = 0.60):** Incorrect because the null hypothesis should be the opposite of the claim.
- **Option E (H0: p ≤ 0.60, Ha: p = 0.60):** Incorrect because the alternative hypothesis should be **p > 0.60**, not **p = 0.60**.
- **Option F (H0: p = 0.60, Ha: p ≠ 0.60):** Incorrect because it tests for equality, which does not align with the claim.
- **Option G (H0: p ≤ 0.60, Ha: p > 0.60):** Correct. This setup tests whether the proportion is greater than 60%, which supports the claim.
- **Option H (H0: p < 0.60, Ha: p > 0.60):** Correct. However, this setup tests whether the proportion is greater than 60%, which also supports the claim. While both G and H are valid, G is the more direct and appropriate setup for this claim.
- **Option I (H0: p < 0.60, Ha: p > 0.60):** Correct but less direct than G, as it tests whether the proportion is greater than 60%. However, G is the better choice.
- **Option J (H0: p > 0.60, Ha: p < 0.60):** Incorrect because it reverses the alternative and null hypotheses.

### Conclusion:
The correct setup is **Option G**, as it directly tests the claim that the proportion of shoppers is greater than 60% with the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses.
