Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about volatile liquids A and B. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question says that A and B are volatile liquids, and their pure vapor pressures are given: PA* is 165 Torr and PB* is 85.1 Torr. They're confined in a piston-cylinder assembly, and initially, it's all liquid phase. Then, when the pressure is reduced, the first vapor forms. The total pressure at which this first vapor is observed is 110 Torr. We need to find the mole fraction of A, xA.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when you have a mixture of liquids, the vapor pressure is determined by Raoult's Law. Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of each component in the vapor is equal to the mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by the pure vapor pressure. So, PA* = xA * PA*, and PB* = xB * PB*. Also, since the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures, P_total = PA + PB.

Wait, but in this scenario, the first vapor to form is when the excess vapor pressure is higher than the liquid. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the initial point before any vapor has formed. Initially, all is liquid, so the partial pressures would be zero. When we start adding vapor, the first vapor to form would be the one with the lower vapor pressure? Or the one with the lower mole fraction? Hmm, I think the first vapor to form is the one with the lowest mole fraction. Because at that point, the vapor's partial pressure is equal to the reduced pressure, and that's when it starts to form.

Wait, wait. Another approach: when you reduce the pressure, the first component to vaporize is the one with the lower vapor pressure. Because as you lower the total pressure, the first liquid to boil is the one that can't escape because its vapor pressure is lower than the surrounding pressure. So in the initial stages, the first vapor is the one with the lower vapor pressure. So, A has a higher vapor pressure (165) than B (85.1), so B would vaporize first. But wait, in the question, the total pressure is 110 Torr. That's lower than the vapor pressures of both. Wait, no: PA* is 165, which is higher than 110. So the first vapor to form must be the one with a higher mole fraction in the liquid phase? Or wait, maybe the first to form is the one with the lower vapor pressure? Because when you have a mixture, the vapor is richer in the component with the lower vapor pressure. So, the first to form is the one with lower vapor pressure, but the total pressure here is lower than both pure vapor pressures. That suggests that both are still liquid? Because the pure vapor pressures are higher than the current total pressure.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the total pressure is lower than both pure vapor pressures, then both liquids are still present. But the question says that the first vapor is observed, which implies that before that, perhaps both are liquid, and the first vapor comes from the first where the vapor pressure is higher than the surrounding pressure. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the system is at a pressure lower than the total vapor pressure, but higher than the pure vapor pressures of both, the first component to vaporize is the one with the lower vapor pressure. Because the vapor pressure of A is higher than B, so B has a lower vapor pressure. So B would be the first to vaporize, and the remaining liquid would have a higher mole fraction of A?

Wait, but the question says the first vapor is observed at total pressure 110. So, the first vapor is the first liquid to vaporize. So if B has a lower vapor pressure, it would vaporize first. That would mean that in the initial state after vaporization, the remaining liquid has higher mole fraction of A, since B has evaporated.

Wait, but the total pressure is 110. The pure vapor pressures of A and B are 165 and 85.1, respectively. So both are higher than 110. So both liquids are still present. But the total pressure is 110, which is lower than the pure vapor pressures of both. So the vapor is a mixture of both liquids.

Wait, no. Because if both are still present, then the vapor would have lower pressure than their pure vapor pressures. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if both are present, the vapor would have a partial pressure of each less than their pure. So the total would be less than the sum of the pure vapor pressures. Wait, but in this case, the sum of the pure vapor pressures is 165 +85.1=250.2 Torr. But the total pressure is 110, which is less than 250, so that implies that the vapor is a mixture of both liquids. So the mole fractions of A and B in the vapor are such that their partial pressures sum to 110.

Wait, but the question says the first vapor is observed at this total pressure. So the first vapor is the first to form, which would be the one with lower vapor pressure, which is B. But if we're at a pressure lower than both pure vapor pressures, then both are still present. So perhaps the first step is that both are in the liquid phase, and then the first to vaporize is B. So the vapor would have a composition that depends on the mole fractions.

Wait, but according to Raoult's Law, each component's partial pressure is x_i * P_i^*, where x_i is the mole fraction of the component in the liquid. So the partial pressure of B in the vapor would be x_B * 85.1. Since B is the first to vaporize, x_B at the first stage would be such that the total pressure (110) is the sum of the partial pressures of A and B.

Wait, let me write that down: 

At the first stage, the vapor is a mixture of A and B. Since B has lower vapor pressure, it's the first to vaporize. So the mole fraction of B in the liquid is x_B, and the mole fraction of A is x_A = 1 - x_B.

The partial pressure of B in the vapor is P_B = x_B * P_B^* = x_B *85.1. Similarly, P_A = x_A *165 = x_B * (165) * (1 - x_B).

Wait, but the total pressure is P_total = PA + PB = 110 Torr.

So 110 = x_A *165 + x_B *85.1.

But x_A is (1 - x_B), so substitute:

110 = (1 - x_B) * 165 + x_B * 85.1.

Let me compute that.

110 = 165(1 - x_B) +85.1 x_B.

Expanding 165(1 -xB) = 165 - 165 xB.

So:

110 = 165 -165 xB +85.1 xB.

Combine the xB terms:

-165 xB +85.1 xB = (-79.9) xB.

So:

110 = 165 -79.9 xB.

Subtract 165 from both sides:

110 -165 = -79.9 xB.

-55 = -79.9 xB.

Multiply both sides by -1:

55 =79.9 xB.

So xB =55 /79.9 ≈ 0.688.

So xB ≈ 0.688, so xA = 1 -0.688 ≈0.312.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options:

The options are:

A:0.665, B:0.525, C:0.312, D:0.250, E:0.600, F:0.750, G:0.400, H:0.175, I:0.150, J:0.450.

So option C is 0.312, which matches our xA.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

55 divided by 79.9. Let me compute that more accurately.

55 /79.9 ≈ 0.688, so xB=0.688, xA=0.312. That's option C.

But wait, the first vapor is observed at 110 Torr. Let me think if there's another way. Another approach: the vapor pressure of the mixture is P = xA * PA* + xB * PB*.

Since the total pressure is 110, and xA =1 -xB.

So 110 = (1 -xB)*165 + xB*85.1.

Let me compute that again.

Let me compute 165*(1 -xB) +85.1 xB =165 -165 xB +85.1 xB.

Which is 165 -79.9 xB.

Set equal to 110: 165 -79.9 xB =110.

So 165 -110 =79.9 xB →55=79.9 xB →xB=55/79.9 ≈0.688.

So xA=0.312, which is option C. So the correct answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the partial pressure of each component in the vapor is equal to the mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by the pure vapor pressure. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the components. The first vapor to form corresponds to the component with the lower vapor pressure, which is B in this case (PB* = 85.1 Torr). However, since the total pressure (110 Torr) is lower than both pure vapor pressures (PA* = 165 Torr and PB* = 85.1 Torr), both components remain liquid initially.

Using Raoult's Law, the partial pressures of A and B in the vapor are:

\[
P_A = x_A \cdot P_A^* \quad \text{and} \quad P_B = x_B \cdot P_B^*
\]

where \(x_A\) and \(x_B\) are the mole fractions of A and B in the liquid, respectively. The total pressure is:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_A + P_B = x_A \cdot P_A^* + x_B \cdot P_B^*
\]

Since \(x_A + x_B = 1\), we can express \(x_A = 1 - x_B\). Substituting this into the total pressure equation:

\[
110 = (1 - x_B) \cdot 165 + x_B \cdot 85.1
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
110 = 165 - 165x_B + 85.1x_B
\]

\[
110 = 165 - 79.9x_B
\]

\[
-55 = -79.9x_B
\]

\[
x_B = \frac{55}{79.9} \approx 0.688
\]

The mole fraction of A is:

\[
x_A = 1 - x_B = 1 - 0.688 = 0.312
\]

Thus, the mole fraction of A is approximately 0.312, which corresponds to option C.
