Question:

7.1-3. To determine the effect of $100 \%$ nitrate on the growth of pea plants, several specimens were planted and then watered with $100 \%$ nitrate every day. At the end of
two weeks, the plants were measured. Here are data on seven of them:
$$
\begin{array}{lllllll}
17.5 & 14.5 & 15.2 & 14.0 & 17.3 & 18.0 & 13.8
\end{array}
$$
Assume that these data are a random sample from a normal distribution $N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)$.
(a) Find the value of a point estimate of $\mu$.

F: $17.142$
G: $14.328$
H: $18.357$
I: $17.512$
J:  $15.757$

Okay, so I need to figure out the point estimate of the population mean μ for these pea plant growth data. The data given is from seven plants, and each plant's growth was measured after two weeks. The values are: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, and 13.8. 

Point estimate of μ is basically the sample mean, right? Because the sample mean is the best single value estimate for the population mean when we assume the data comes from a normal distribution. So, I just need to calculate the average of these seven numbers.

Let me write them down again: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, 13.8. 

To calculate the mean, I'll add all these numbers together and then divide by the number of observations, which is 7.

First, adding them up step by step:

17.5 + 14.5 = 32.0  
32.0 + 15.2 = 47.2  
47.2 + 14.0 = 61.2  
61.2 + 17.3 = 78.5  
78.5 + 18.0 = 96.5  
96.5 + 13.8 = 110.3

So, the total sum is 110.3. Now, divide that by 7.

110.3 divided by 7. Let me compute that: 7 goes into 11 once, remainder 4. 7 into 40 (after decimal) is 5 (5*7=35), remainder 5. 7 into 53 is 7 (7*7=49), remainder 4. 7 into 40 again is 5, remainder 5. Hmm, maybe a better way is to do 110.3 / 7.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 110.3 ÷ 7. 7*15 = 105, so 15 with a remainder of 5.5. Then 5.5 ÷ 7 is 0.7857... So the mean is approximately 15.7857.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A:14.857  
B:16.875  
C:16.231  
D:15.471  
E:15.000  
F:17.142  
G:14.328  
H:18.357  
I:17.512  
J:15.757

So, my calculation gave me approximately 15.7857, which is close to option J, 15.757. But wait, maybe I should double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me add them again:

17.5  
14.5  
15.2  
14.0  
17.3  
18.0  
13.8  

Adding them up:

17.5 + 14.5 = 32.0  
32.0 + 15.2 = 47.2  
47.2 + 14.0 = 61.2  
61.2 + 17.3 = 78.5  
78.5 + 18.0 = 96.5  
96.5 + 13.8 = 110.3

Yes, that's correct. So 110.3 divided by 7 is approximately 15.7857.

Looking at the options, J is 15.757, which is very close to 15.7857. There's a slight difference, but perhaps the exact value is 15.7857, so I need to check if any of the options match exactly or if it's rounded.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more precisely without rounding. Let me use a calculator method:

17.5 + 14.5 + 15.2 + 14.0 + 17.3 + 18.0 + 13.8.

Let me compute each addition step by step:

17.5 + 14.5 = 32.0  
32.0 + 15.2 = 47.2  
47.2 + 14.0 = 61.2  
61.2 + 17.3 = 78.5  
78.5 + 18.0 = 96.5  
96.5 + 13.8 = 110.3.

Yes, that's correct. So 110.3 divided by 7 is exactly 15.7857142857...

Looking at the options, the closest is J:15.757, which is 15.757, and the next one is I:17.512, which is higher. So, none of the options exactly match 15.7857, but J is the closest. Let me check if the exact mean is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in adding. Let me try adding them in pairs:

17.5 + 18.0 = 35.5  
14.5 +14.0=28.5  
15.2 +17.3=32.5  
13.8 +14.5=28.3? Wait, no, 13.8 +14.0=27.8, but that was already in a pair. Hmm, perhaps I should list them all again.

Wait, maybe I should sum them as individual numbers:

17.5  
14.5  
15.2  
14.0  
17.3  
18.0  
13.8

Let me just write each number's integer and decimal part:

17.5: 17 + 0.5  
14.5: 14 + 0.5  
15.2:15 + 0.2  
14.0:14 + 0.0  
17.3:17 + 0.3  
18.0:18 + 0.0  
13.8:13 + 0.8

Now adding the integer parts: 17+14=31, +15=46, +14=60, +17=77, +18=95, +13=108.

Now adding the decimal parts: 0.5 +0.5=1, 0.2, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.8.

So decimal sum: 1 +0.2=1.2, +0.0=1.2, +0.3=1.5, +0.0=1.5, +0.8=2.3.

Total sum: 108 + 2.3 = 110.3. So that's correct.

So 110.3 divided by 7 is indeed 15.7857.

Looking back at the options, J is 15.757, which is approximately 15.757, and the next one is I:17.512, which is higher. So 15.7857 is between J and I, but closer to J. However, none of the options exactly match 15.7857, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, maybe I should check if the mean is calculated correctly or maybe I misread the numbers.

Wait, looking at the data again: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, 13.8.

Wait, 18.0 is included, which is the highest value. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the mean using a different method, like adding them one by one:

Start with 17.5.

Add 14.5: 17.5 +14.5=32.

Add 15.2: 32 +15.2=47.2.

Add 14.0: 47.2 +14=61.2.

Add 17.3:61.2 +17.3=78.5.

Add 18.0:78.5 +18=96.5.

Add 13.8:96.5 +13.8=110.3.

Yes, same result. So 110.3 /7 is correct. So the mean is 15.7857, which is approximately 15.7857.

Looking at the options, J is 15.757, which is 0.0287 less than 15.7857. Option I is 17.512, which is higher. The closest is J.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the data is written with the decimal point before the comma? Like 17.5 instead of 17.50? But no, the way it's written is 17.5, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me check 110.3 divided by 7.

7 goes into 110 fourteen times (14 *7=98), remainder 12. Bring down the 3: 123.

7 into 123 is 17 (17*7=119), remainder 4. Bring down the decimal: 40.

7 into 40 is 5 (5*7=35), remainder 5. Bring down the 0: 50.

7 into 50 is 7 (7*7=49), remainder 1. So, it's 15.7857142857...

So yes, 15.7857 is the exact value, so the closest option is J:15.757. But wait, wait, let me check the exact value again.

Wait, perhaps I should use fractions. Maybe 110.3 is equal to 1103/10. So, 1103 divided by 70.

Wait, 70 goes into 1103 how many times? 70*15=1050, remainder 53.

53/70 is 0.757142857...

So 15 + 53/70 = 15 + 0.757142857 = 15.757142857...

Wait, that's 15.757142857...

But that's 15.757142857, which is approximately 15.7571. So, 15.7571 is approximately 15.757, which is option J.

Wait, but earlier I thought 110.3 /7 is 15.7857. But when I broke it into 1103/70, I get 15.7571, which is 15.7571. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, 110.3 divided by 7. Let me compute this as a fraction:

110.3 = 1103/10

So, 1103/10 divided by 7 is 1103/(10*7) = 1103/70.

Now, let me compute 1103 ÷70.

70*15=1050. 1103-1050=53.

So, 53/70. Let's convert that to decimal.

53 ÷70: 70 goes into 53 zero times. Add decimal: 530 ÷70=7 (7*70=490), remainder 40.

40 ÷70=0.57142857...

So, 53/70=0.757142857...

Therefore, 15 + 0.757142857=15.757142857...

Wait, that's 15.757142857, which is approximately 15.7571.

Wait, so that's conflicting with the initial calculation. Earlier, when I thought 110.3 ÷7=15.7857, but now, when I compute 1103/70, it's approximately 15.7571.

So which one is correct? Let me check the original numbers again.

The data is: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, 13.8. Sum is 110.3.

So 110.3 ÷7=15.7857. But when I compute 1103/70, I get 15.7571. That can't be right because 70*15.7571 is 70*15 +70*0.7571=1050 +53.0=1103.

Wait, so 1103/70 is 15.7571. But 110.3 ÷7 is 15.7857.

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake in the addition earlier. Let me recalculate the sum.

Let me add the numbers again:

17.5 +14.5 =32.0  
32.0 +15.2=47.2  
47.2 +14.0=61.2  
61.2 +17.3=78.5  
78.5 +18.0=96.5  
96.5 +13.8=110.3.

Wait, that's correct. So 110.3 ÷7=15.7857.

Wait, so why did I get 15.7571 when I did 1103/70? That can't be correct because 1103 ÷70 is 15.7571, but 110.3 ÷7=15.7857. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the decimal parts earlier.

Wait, let me compute the sum again. Maybe I miscounted the decimal additions.

Wait, 17.5 is 17 + 0.5,  
14.5 is 14 + 0.5,  
15.2 is 15 + 0.2,  
14.0 is 14 + 0.0,  
17.3 is 17 + 0.3,  
18.0 is 18 + 0.0,  
13.8 is 13 + 0.8.

So adding integer parts: 17 +14=31, +15=46, +14=60, +17=77, +18=95, +13=108.

Adding decimal parts: 0.5 +0.5=1.0, +0.2=1.2, +0.0=1.2, +0.3=1.5, +0.0=1.5, +0.8=2.3.

Total sum: 108 +2.3=110.3.

So, 110.3 ÷7=15.7857.

Wait, but 1103 ÷70 is 15.7571, which would imply that 1103 is 110.3 *10, so 110.3 ÷7 is 15.7571 when I multiply numerator and denominator by 10. But that's incorrect because 110.3 ÷7 is not 1103 ÷70.

Wait, I think I confused myself. Let me try to compute 110.3 ÷7 step by step.

7 goes into 11 once (1*7=7), subtract 7 from 11, remainder 4. Bring down the 0, making it 40.

7 into 40 is 5 (5*7=35), remainder 5. Bring down the 3, making it 53.

7 into 53 is 7 (7*7=49), remainder 4. Now, bring down a decimal point and a 0, making it 40.

7 into 40 is 5, remainder 5. So, 15.7571...

So, the correct mean is approximately 15.7571, which is 15.757 when rounded to four decimal places.

Looking back at the options, J is 15.757, which matches this. So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but earlier when I thought 1103/70 was 15.7571, but that's incorrect because 110.3 is 1103/10, not 1103/70. So, that was a mistake in my calculation.

Therefore, the correct mean is approximately 15.757, which is option J.

To determine the point estimate of the population mean (μ) for the given data, we calculate the sample mean by summing all the values and dividing by the number of observations.

The data is: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, 13.8.

Adding these values together:
17.5 + 14.5 = 32.0  
32.0 + 15.2 = 47.2  
47.2 + 14.0 = 61.2  
61.2 + 17.3 = 78.5  
78.5 + 18.0 = 96.5  
96.5 + 13.8 = 110.3

The total sum is 110.3. Dividing this by the number of observations (7) gives the sample mean:

110.3 ÷ 7 = 15.7571...

Looking at the options, the closest value is J: 15.757.
