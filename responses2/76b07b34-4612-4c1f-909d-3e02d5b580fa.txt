Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the first thing to do when a cardiac arrest happens. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, when someone has cardiac arrest, the first thing I remember is that the immediate action is to call for help. But wait, the options given don't include "call for help." Let me look at the options again.

The options are A through J. So the question is asking what the first action is after confirming cardiac arrest. The options are A to I and J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Ensure the emergency team/services are called. That sounds like an important first step because without them getting called, the medical team won't be ready to help. So A is definitely a correct first action.

Option B: administer an electric shock using a defibrillator. Wait, I thought that happens after some time, maybe when the patient is stable. The defibrillator is used in the event of a ST-segment elevation disorder or to restore normal sinus rhythm, not the first thing after a cardiac arrest. So B might not be the first action.

Option C: give 30 chest compressions. That's a standard procedure, but again, this comes after the first step of calling the emergency team. So C is a step, but not the first.

Option D: check the notes for DNAR order. DNAR stands for Direct Numerical Analysis of R Wave, which is an order for a defibrillator. Without knowing that, you can't administer the shock, so D is needed but not the first action.

Option E: rush to the ER. That's not right. Rushing without help is dangerous. The first step is to call them, so E is incorrect.

Option F: administer adrenaline. That's incorrect. adrenaline is a stimulant, and giving it would be during shock, not the first step.

Option G: lay the patient down and elevate legs. That's a comfort measure, not an action taken immediately after cardiac arrest. So G is not the first.

Option H: mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. That's a specific method, but it's not the first thing. It's usually the last resort.

Option I: check blood pressure. That's an important check, but again, not the first step.

Option J: two rescue breaths. Those are usually given after shock, not the first thing.

Wait, but the first thing is calling for help. So the correct answer is A. Let me make sure none of the other options fit this role.

So the first step is to call on emergency services, which is option A. The other options either involve administering shocks or other procedures, which come later. So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is **A: ensure the emergency team/services are called**.
