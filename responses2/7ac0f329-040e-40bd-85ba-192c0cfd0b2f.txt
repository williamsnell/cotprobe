Okay, so I've got this optics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a telescope with an eyepiece that has two lenses, each with a focal length of 6 cm. The objective has a focal length of 30 cm. The beam is parallel, and the rays are coming in parallel to the axis. The final image is at infinity, which suggests that we're dealing with a simple telescope setup, right?

Wait, wait, what's a telescope setup again? Oh right, a telescope usually consists of an objective lens (which collects light) and an eyepiece lens (which forms the image). The eyepiece is usually a compound lens, but in this case, each lens has a focal length of 6 cm. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the common focal length of each lens of the eyepiece is 6 cm. So each of the two lenses (if it's a compound lens, but maybe in the problem it's treated as two separate lenses? Or maybe it's a single lens with two focal lengths for each side?)

Wait, perhaps the question states that each of the two lenses of the eyepiece has a focal length of 6 cm. So maybe the eyepiece is a two-lens system where each lens has 6 cm. But wait, that can't be right because each lens in the eyepiece will have a different focal length. Oh wait, no, perhaps each lens in the eyepiece (as in, the two lenses in the eyepiece is a common focal length of 6 cm each). Hmm, maybe the eyepiece is a simple lens with a focal length of 6 cm, or perhaps the two lenses have focal lengths of 6 cm each. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "the common focal length of each of the lenses of the eyepiece is 6.0 cm." Oh, okay, so the eyepiece has two lenses, each with a focal length of 6 cm. So each lens of the eyepiece has a focal length of 6 cm. That's a bit unusual for a simple telescope because the eyepiece is usually a single lens, but the question says it's a two-lens system, each with 6 cm.

Wait, or maybe the two lenses have a common focal length of 6 cm. So each of the two lenses (front and back) has a focal length of 6 cm. That might make the eyepiece behave like a simple lens with a focal length of 6 cm.

Wait, but wait, in a simple telescope, the objective has a focal length of, say, 30 cm, and the eyepiece (which is a simple lens) has a focal length of 6 cm. The image is formed at infinity, which is the condition for a simple telescope.

So the setup is: an objective with f_objective =30 cm, and an eyepiece which is a simple lens with f_eyepiece =6 cm. Then the diameter of the objective is given as 3 cm, and we need to find the diameter of the beam emerging from the telescope.

Wait, but wait another thing: in a telescope, the diameter of the objective is important because the beam diameter at the objective is the size of the primary mirror, and as the light collects, it would spread out, but the point is that the beam diameter at the objective is the same as the diameter of the telescope's aperture. So perhaps the diameter of the beam emerging from the objective is the same as the diameter of the objective? Or maybe not, because perhaps the beam is focused in a way that the beam diameter is determined by some other consideration, like the divergence from the objective. Wait, but for a telescope, the beam diameter at the eyepiece is actually determined by the objective's diameter and the magnification.

Wait, let's think about the optics here. The beam is parallel, so the diameter at the objective is the same as the objective's diameter. But wait, the question is about the diameter of the beam emerging from the telescope, which is the same as the objective's diameter, right? No, wait, that's not correct. Because the beam is focused by the objective, so the actual beam diameter at the objective would be smaller than the objective's diameter, depending on the magnification. Wait, no, the objective collects the beam, so the beam diameter would be the same as the objective's diameter. Because the objective is just collecting the beam, but doesn't change its size. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the objective is a mirror, so the beam diameter would be the same as the objective's diameter. Because the mirror's size defines the beam size. So if the objective is 3 cm in diameter, the beam diameter is 3 cm. But wait, the problem says the beam is parallel, so the diameter would be same as the objective's. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the beam's divergence as it goes through the objective. For a telescope, the beam is usually focused by the objective, so the beam diameter at the objective is the same as the objective's diameter. So the diameter of the beam emerging from the objective is 3 cm. But wait, that would be the case if the beam is focused in a way that doesn't spread, but in reality, the objective is a mirror, so the beam spreads as it passes through it. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the beam diameter relates to the objective's size.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula for the beam diameter at the objective. Or, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the problem again. The beam is parallel, so the diameter of the beam as it's focused by the objective is determined by the objective's size. So, the objective's diameter is 3 cm, and the beam diameter as it comes into the objective is 3 cm. Then the eyepiece will magnify this beam, but perhaps it's the same as the objective's diameter.

But wait, in a simple telescope, the image is at infinity, which is the condition for a simple telescope. So in this case, the eyepiece is a simple lens, not a compound lens. So the diameter of the beam emerging from the eyepiece would be the same as the objective's diameter. Wait, but the diameter of the beam as seen by the eyepiece is the same as the objective's, but the eyepiece's image would be focused further. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The beam diameter at the objective is 3 cm, and the eyepiece's magnification depends on the magnification factor of the eyepiece. But wait, the eyepiece is a simple lens with a focal length of 6 cm. The magnification (m) of a simple telescope is given by m = f_objective / f_eyepiece. So m = 30 cm / 6 cm = 5. But wait, what's the formula for magnification in a telescope? Oh, wait, actually, the magnification is m = f_objective / f_eyepiece, but only when the eyepiece is acting as a magnifier with a virtual image. Hmm, wait, no, in the case of a telescope, the eyepiece is used as a magnifier, but the magnification formula for a simple telescope is m = f_objective / f_eyepiece. So in this case, m=5, so the image is magnified by a factor of 5.

But wait, the diameter of the beam is that of the objective. Because the objective's diameter is 3 cm, and the beam's diameter at the objective is 3 cm. So the beam diameter at the eyepiece would be the same as the objective's diameter, since the eyepiece magnifies the beam, but the beam's size is determined by the objective. Wait, no, because as the beam passes through the eyepiece, it's magnified. But in a simple telescope, the magnification is about the image being at infinity, so the beam diameter would be the same as the objective's.

Wait, but the problem says "the beam of parallel rays falls on the objective...". So the beam is the same as the objective's diameter. So the diameter of the beam emerging from the telescope would be 3 cm. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options are 35, 10, 12, 20, 30, 18, 25, 24, 15, 28, 18, 20, 28, etc. Wait, 3 cm is not an option. So that suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the magnification. Wait, the problem is about the diameter of the beam emerging from the telescope. So the question is, what's the beam diameter at the objective, which is 3 cm, or is it something else?

Wait another approach. The magnitude of the beam as seen by the eyepiece depends on the magnification. Wait, but the beam diameter as seen by the eyepiece is the same as the objective's diameter, but because the eyepiece is a magnifier, the beam's actual diameter would be larger. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.

The beam diameter at the objective is 3 cm. Then it's magnified by the eyepiece. But in a simple telescope, the beam is focused by the objective, so the beam diameter, as seen by the eyepiece, is the same as the objective's. But the magnification determines the size of the beam at the eyepiece. Wait, but the beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's diameter (3 cm). But the magnification would tell us how much larger or smaller the beam appears at the eyepiece. Wait, but in the case of a telescope, the eyepiece is the magnifier, so the beam diameter would be larger because the magnification increases the apparent size. So the beam diameter at the eyepiece would be the same as the objective's, but the magnification (for the eyepiece) is m=5, so the beam diameter at the eyepiece would be 3 cm * (m) = 15 cm? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because the magnification factor affects how much the beam appears.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it this way: in the eyepiece, the beam is focused to a point, but because of the magnification, the beam appears larger. So the beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's diameter (3 cm), but because the eyepiece magnifies it, the beam would be larger. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if the beam is focused by the objective, then the beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's. So the beam appears to be 3 cm in diameter at the eyepiece, but the magnification m=5 means that the actual beam is larger. So the actual beam, as seen by the eyepiece, is 3 cm. But the physical beam would be 3 cm * (m), which would be 15 cm? Or perhaps I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam diameter of the objective is 3 cm, and the magnification of the eyepiece affects the beam diameter as seen by the observer, but the actual beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find another approach.

Another approach: The diameter of the beam at the objective is 3 cm. Then, the eyepiece magnifies this beam. Because the eyepiece is a simple lens, the magnification m is f_objective / f_eyepiece.

So m = 30 cm / 6 cm = 5.

In a simple telescope, the magnification is the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece. So the beam diameter as seen by the eyepiece is the same as the objective's (3 cm), but the actual beam diameter is larger. Wait, no. Because the beam is focused by the objective, the beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's. So the beam diameter is 3 cm as seen by the eyepiece. But the actual beam would be larger because the eyepiece magnifies it.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The beam diameter at the objective is 3 cm. The eyepiece's magnification is m = 5. So the beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's (3 cm), but the beam appears larger because the magnification makes it look bigger. But the actual beam's diameter is 3 cm * m = 3 *5=15 cm?

Wait, no, wait. If the beam is 3 cm as seen by the eyepiece, which is after the magnification, then the actual beam would be larger. Because the magnification makes it look bigger. So, the beam's actual size at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's (3 cm), but the magnification makes it look larger. So the overall beam diameter is 3 cm (as seen by the observer), but the actual diameter is 3 cm * m. So 3 *5=15 cm. So the beam diameter after the eyepiece is 15 cm.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about magnification. The magnification (m) is the magnification factor, which is the ratio of the image size to the object size. So if the object is 3 cm, and the magnification is 5, the image would be 15 cm. So the beam diameter as seen by the eyepiece (which is the same as the objective's diameter) is 3 cm, but the actual beam is 15 cm.

Wait, but is the beam diameter at the eyepiece the same as the objective's diameter? Because the eyepiece doesn't collect the beam itself, but the beam is focused by the objective. So the beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's. So if the beam is 3 cm, then the magnification of the eyepiece (which is a simple lens) would cause the beam to appear larger, but the actual beam at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's (3 cm). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again. The beam is parallel, passes through the objective, which has a diameter of 3 cm. So the beam entering the objective has a diameter of 3 cm. The eyepiece's magnification would determine how much the beam appears as seen at the eyepiece, but the actual beam is the same as the objective's.

Wait, but wait again. The beam's diameter at the objective is 3 cm. The eyepiece magnifies this, but the beam's actual size as seen by the observer is the same as the objective's. So the beam diameter as seen by the observer is 3 cm, but the actual beam is 3 cm * m = 3 *5=15 cm.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the beam is 15 cm, that's larger than the objective's diameter. That would mean that the beam is diverging more, but the eyepiece would magnify it. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the direction of magnification wrong. Wait, in a simple telescope, the eyepiece is a magnifier. So the beam appears larger as it passes through the eyepiece. So, yes, the magnification m = 5 would make the beam appear 5 times larger than it is at the eyepiece. So the actual beam diameter at the eyepiece is 3 cm, but the magnification makes it look larger, so the beam diameter as seen by the observer is 3 cm * m = 15 cm. So the actual diameter of the beam after the eyepiece is 15 cm.

But wait, that's the beam diameter as seen by the observer. But wait, the question says, "find the diameter of the beam of light emerging from the telescope." So, the beam is focused by the objective, and then the eyepiece magnifies it. So the beam diameter would be the same as the objective's diameter, but considering the magnification, it's 3 cm * m = 15 cm. So the correct option would be 15 cm, which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check the approach.

Another approach: The telescope's objective has a diameter D =3 cm. The eyepiece has a magnification factor m= f1/f2=30/6=5. The beam diameter at the objective is D. Then, the beam diameter at the eyepiece is D, but the magnification m is applied to the beam. So the beam diameter as seen by the observer is D. But the actual beam diameter at the eyepiece would be D * (m) = 3*5=15 cm. However, the beam diameter as seen by the observer (the beam diameter at the eyepiece) is 3 cm. So perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. The beam diameter as seen by the observer (i.e., the beam diameter at the eyepiece) is the same as the objective's diameter, which is 3 cm. Then, the magnification m tells us how much bigger this beam appears. So the actual beam diameter as seen by the observer is 3 cm. But the eyepiece magnifies it, making it look larger. So the actual beam is 3 cm * m =15 cm. So the beam diameter as it's leaving the eyepiece is 15 cm. But wait, the question is about the diameter of the beam emerging from the telescope, which is the same as the beam diameter at the eyepiece, because the eyepiece doesn't spread out the beam beyond that point. Wait, no. The eyepiece focuses the beam, so the beam diameter as seen by the observer is 3 cm, but the actual beam diameter (the diameter of the beam as it exits the eyepiece) would be 3 cm * m = 15 cm.

Wait, but the question isn't about what the beam appears to the observer, but the actual beam. So the beam diameter at the eyepiece is 3 cm, but because the eyepiece is a magnifier, the actual beam is larger. So the beam would be 3 * m = 15 cm.

Wait, but wait, the beam is focused by the objective, so the beam diameter at the eyepiece is the same as the objective's. So the beam diameter at the eyepiece is 3 cm. But because the eyepiece is a magnifier, the actual beam is larger. The magnification factor is m=5, so the actual beam is 3 cm * m =15 cm.

Wait, but that would mean that the beam is 15 cm in diameter. If that's the case, then the correct answer is option H (15 cm). Let me check the options:

Options are:

A: 18 cm

B: 28 cm

C: 24 cm

D: 20 cm

E: 30 cm

F: 15 cm

G: 25 cm

H: 18, 20, 24, etc.

So option F is 15 cm, which would correspond to this reasoning. So the answer is 15 cm, which is option F.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is that the beam diameter at the objective is D. The eyepiece is a simple lens with focal length f_e. The magnification is m = f_objective / f_e =30/6=5. The beam diameter at the eyepiece is D* m. So 3 cm *5=15 cm. Since the beam diameter at the eyepiece is 15 cm, but the beam is focused by the objective, which has a diameter of 3 cm, the beam diameter that enters the eyepiece is 3 cm. Then, the magnification makes it appear as 15 cm.

Wait, but the question is about the diameter of the beam emerging from the telescope. The telescope's objective has a diameter of 3 cm, so the beam diameter would be 3 cm. But the eyepiece magnifies this beam, so the beam would appear as 3 cm * m =15 cm. But the question is about the beam that emerges from the telescope, which is the same as the beam that leaves the eyepiece. So the beam's actual diameter is 3 cm * m =15 cm.

Wait, but wait. The beam diameter at the objective is 3 cm. The eyepiece is a magnifier, which is placed after the objective. So the beam diameter just after the eyepiece is the same as the objective's diameter (3 cm), but the magnification makes it look larger. So the beam's actual diameter is 3 cm * m =15 cm.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The beam's diameter is determined by the objective. Since the eyepiece is a magnifier, the beam's size would be larger, but the question is about the beam that emerges from the telescope, which is the same as the beam that leaves the eyepiece. So the diameter of the beam at the eyepiece is 3 cm, but because the eyepiece is a magnifier, the beam's actual size is 3 cm * m =15 cm.

Wait, but this seems off because the beam would be larger, but the question is about the beam that emerges from the telescope. So the answer would be 15 cm, which is Option F.
</think>

To determine the diameter of the beam of light emerging from the telescope, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Objective Diameter**: The objective of the telescope has a diameter of 3 cm. This is the beam diameter as it enters the objective.

2. **Eyepiece Magnification**: The eyepiece of the telescope is a simple lens with a focal length of 6 cm. The magnification factor \( m \) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{f_{\text{objective}}}{f_{\text{eyepiece}}} = \frac{30 \, \text{cm}}{6 \, \text{cm}} = 5
   \]

3. **Beam Diameter at the Eyepiece**: The beam diameter entering the eyepiece is the same as the objective's diameter, which is 3 cm. However, the eyepiece magnifies this beam, making it appear larger. The actual beam diameter at the eyepiece is:
   \[
   \text{Beam Diameter at Eyepiece} = \text{Beam Diameter at Objective} \times m = 3 \, \text{cm} \times 5 = 15 \, \text{cm}
   \]

4. **Beam DiameterExiting the Telescope**: The beam diameter exiting the telescope is the same as the beam diameter at the eyepiece, as the eyepiece does not spread the beam further. Thus, the diameter of the beam emerging from the telescope is 15 cm.

5. **Matching with Options**: Among the given options, the correct answer is **15 cm**, which corresponds to option F.
