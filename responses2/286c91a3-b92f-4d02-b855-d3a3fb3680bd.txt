Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Rowena and Ruby can paint a room together in different amounts of time, and I need to find the ordered pair (x, y) that satisfies the given conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem again. Rowena can paint a room in 14 hours, so her painting rate is 1 room per 14 hours, or 1/14 per hour. Ruby can paint it in 6 hours, so her rate is 1/6 per hour. 

The first part says that if Rowena paints for x hours and Ruby for y hours, together they finish half the painting. So, the total work done in this case is half the room. The second scenario is that if Rowena paints for y hours and Ruby for x hours, together they finish the whole room. So, I need to set up two equations based on these scenarios and solve for x and y.

Let me denote the work done as the amount of the room painted. So, if Rowena paints for x hours, she paints (1/14)*x, and Ruby paints (1/6)*y. Together, they do (1/14)x + (1/6)y = 1/2. That's the first equation.

In the second scenario, Rowena paints for y hours, so she does (1/14)y, and Ruby paints for x hours, so she does (1/6)x. Together, they paint 1 room, so (1/14)y + (1/6)x = 1. That's the second equation.

So now I have two equations:

1) (1/14)x + (1/6)y = 1/2

2) (1/14)y + (1/6)x = 1

I need to solve this system of equations. Let me write them down more clearly:

Equation 1: (1/14)x + (1/6)y = 1/2

Equation 2: (1/14)y + (1/6)x = 1

Hmm, to solve for x and y, it might be easier to eliminate the fractions by multiplying through by a common denominator. Let's find the least common multiple of 14 and 6. The LCM of 14 and 6 is 42, so I can multiply each equation by 42 to eliminate the denominators.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 42:

42*(1/14)x + 42*(1/6)y = 42*(1/2)

Simplify:

3x + 7y = 21

Because 42*(1/14) is 3, 42*(1/6) is 7, and 42*(1/2) is 21.

Similarly, multiplying Equation 2 by 42:

42*(1/14)y + 42*(1/6)x = 42*1

Simplify:

3y + 7x = 42

So now we have two new equations:

Equation 1: 3x + 7y = 21

Equation 2: 7x + 3y = 42

Now, I can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination. Let me multiply Equation 1 by 7 and Equation 2 by 3 so that the coefficients of x will be 21 and 21, which can then be subtracted.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 7:

21x + 49y = 147

Multiplying Equation 2 by 3:

21x + 9y = 126

Now subtract the second new equation from the first:

(21x + 49y) - (21x + 9y) = 147 - 126

Simplify:

21x - 21x + 49y - 9y = 21

Which simplifies to:

40y = 21

So, y = 21 / 40.

Now plug this back into one of the original equations to find x. Let's take Equation 1: 3x + 7y = 21.

Substitute y = 21/40:

3x + 7*(21/40) = 21

Calculate 7*(21/40): that's 147/40.

So, 3x + 147/40 = 21

Convert 21 to 40ths: 21 = 840/40.

So, 3x = 840/40 - 147/40 = (840 - 147)/40 = 693/40

Thus, x = (693/40) / 3 = 693 / 120

Simplify 693/120: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 231/40.

So, x = 231/40 and y = 21/40.

Looking at the options, let's check which one is (231/40, 21/40). Option J is (231/40, 21/40). So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me verify my calculations to be sure. Sometimes when dealing with multiple fractions, it's easy to make a mistake.

Starting with the first equation: 3x + 7y = 21, and y = 21/40.

Plugging in y: 3x + 7*(21/40) = 21

7*(21/40) is indeed 147/40.

3x = 21 - 147/40.

Convert 21 to 40ths: 21 is 840/40.

So, 840/40 - 147/40 = (840 - 147)/40 = 693/40.

Then x = 693/40 divided by 3, which is 693/(40*3) = 693/120.

Simplify: 693 รท 3 = 231, 120 รท 3 = 40. So, 231/40. Correct.

So, x is 231/40 and y is 21/40, which is option J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is (231/40, 21/40), which matches. So, that should be the correct answer.

I don't see any errors in my calculations. So I think option J is correct.
