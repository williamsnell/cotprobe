Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mr. John Kirk borrowed $3,000 and needs to calculate the interest he'll pay. The interest rate is 10 and a half percent, and the time period is 180 days. Hmm, right, I remember something about simple interest from my classes. Let me think about the formula.

Wait, simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is the time. Oh right, and the time needs to be in the same units as the rate. Since the rate is given as an annual percentage, I should convert 180 days into years.

So the rate is 10.5%, which is 10.5 divided by 100, so that's 0.105. Okay. The time is 180 days. But how do I convert days into years? Well, a year is 365 days, so 180/365 is the fraction of the year. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 180 divided by 365. Hmm, let's do that. 180 ÷ 365. Let me compute that.

Wait, 180 divided by 365. Let's see: 180/365 is approximately 0.49315. So about 0.49315 years.

Now plug all the numbers into the formula. P is $3,000. R is 0.105. T is approximately 0.49315.

So I = 3000 * 0.105 * 0.49315.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. First, 3000 * 0.105. 3000 * 0.1 is 300, and 3000 * 0.005 is 15, so total is 315. Then multiply that by 0.49315. Let me compute 315 * 0.49315.

Hmm, let's break that down. 0.49315 is roughly 0.493. So 315 * 0.493. Let's compute 315 * 0.4 = 126, 315 * 0.09 = 28.35, 315 * 0.003 = 0.945. Adding all together: 126 + 28.35 = 154.35; plus 0.945 is 155.295. So approximately $155.30.

Wait, but let me double-check because maybe I missed a step. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it as (3000 * 0.105) * (180/365). So 3000 * 0.105 is 315, and 180/365 is 0.49315. So 315 * 0.49315.

Wait, let me compute 315 * 0.49315 more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe using a calculator approach: 315 times 0.49315.

Let me compute it step by step:

315 * 0.4 = 126.0

315 * 0.09 = 28.35

315 * 0.003 = 0.945

315 * 0.00015 = 0.04725

Now add all of these:

126 + 28.35 = 154.35

154.35 + 0.945 = 155.295

155.295 + 0.04725 ≈ 155.34225

So approximately $155.34. Hmm, but looking at the options, there's an option E: $157.50 and H: $315.00. Wait, maybe I made a mistake because my calculation gives about $155.34, which isn't exactly one of the options. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the time. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact fraction. Let me compute 180/365 precisely. 180 divided by 365 is equal to 0.4931506849... So 0.4931506849 years.

So 3000 * 0.105 = 315. Then 315 * 0.4931506849.

Let me compute this more accurately. Let's compute 315 * 0.4931506849.

So 300 * 0.4931506849 = 147.94520547

15 * 0.4931506849 = 7.3972602735

Adding these together: 147.94520547 + 7.3972602735 ≈ 155.34246574

So about $155.34.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: $157.50 and H: $315.00. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should have used simple interest correctly. Oh wait! Wait, sometimes simple interest is calculated using a 365-day year, and sometimes people use 365/360 or 360/365. Oh, but I think in this problem, the rate is given as 10.5% for 180 days, which is likely using a 365-day year for the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects to compute the interest as if it's 180/360 days, which is 0.5 years. Let me try that. 180/360 is 0.5.

So 3000 * 0.105 * 0.5.

3000 * 0.105 is 315. 315 * 0.5 is 157.5. So that would be $157.50, which is option I.

Wait, but why is that different from my previous calculation? Oh, because 180 days is exactly half a year. So 180/365 is approximately 0.49315, but perhaps the question is using the 360-day year method, which is more common in banking.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the standard method. In some calculations, the interest is based on 360 days for a year. So 180 days is a third of the year (360/3=120, wait no, 180/360 is 0.5). Wait, 180/360 is 0.5. So 180 days would be half a year.

Wait, so if I use 360-day year, then T=0.5.

So 3000 * 0.105 * 0.5 = 3000 * 0.0525 = 157.5. So $157.50, which is option I.

But earlier, when I calculated with 180/365, I got about $155.34. So which is correct?

Wait, the question says it's for a 180-day period. So if the rate is based on a 365-day year, then 180/365 is correct. But in practice, some banks use 360 days. Let me think: in U.S. banking, the 360-day method is often used, especially for interest calculations. So perhaps the correct approach is to use 360 days.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether to use 360 or 365. Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe I should proceed based on the standard formula, which is simple interest: I = P * R * T, where T is in the same time unit as the rate. So the rate is 10.5% per annum, and T is 180 days. So the calculation is correct as 180/365.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting numbers with different methods. Let me see the options again. The options are:

A: 210

B:105

C:150

D:225

E:120

F:262.50

G:75

H:315

I:157.50

J:180

Hmm, the correct calculation when using 180/365 is approximately $155.34, which isn't an option. But option I is $157.50, which is 3000 * 0.105 * 0.5.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using 360 days. Let me compute that: 180 / 360 = 0.5.

3000 * 0.105 = 315. 315 * 0.5 = 157.5, which is option I.

But why would the problem specify 180 days? If it's 360 days, then 180 is half a year, which would make the interest $157.50. So that would make option I the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the problem's calculation uses 365 days but with a different rate. Let me try that.

Wait, no. The problem says the rate is 10.5% for a 180-day period. So the time must be 180/365.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using 360 days, so 180 is half a year.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate with 180/365.

3000 * 0.105 = 315.

315 * (180/365) = 315 * (0.4931506849) = Let me compute this more accurately.

315 * 0.4931506849.

Let me compute this step by step:

0.4931506849 = 493.1506849/1000

So 315 * 493.1506849 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 315 * 0.4931506849.

315 * 0.4 = 126

315 * 0.09 = 28.35

315 * 0.003 = 0.945

315 * 0.0001506849 ≈ 0.0473986

Adding all:

126 + 28.35 = 154.35

154.35 + 0.945 = 155.295

155.295 + 0.0473986 ≈ 155.3424

So approximately $155.34, which isn't one of the options. The closest is option E: $157.50 and H: $315.00. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the interest as 10.5% per annum for 180 days, using the actual days. But 180 is exactly half a year. So that's 0.5 years.

So 3000 * 0.105 = 315. 315 * 0.5 = 157.50, which is option I.

But wait, is the problem using 360-day method? Because 180 days is half a year under that method (180/360=0.5). So 0.5 years.

In that case, the answer is 157.50, option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of 365 days, but the calculation is using 180/365, which I think is correct.

Wait, but another approach: maybe the problem is using a 30/360 day count convention, which is common in some contexts. Let's see.

30/360 would mean 30 days in a month, and a year as 360 days.

In that case, the interest would be calculated as (30/360) * 180 days = 15 days.

So the time factor would be 15/360 = 1/24. So (3000 * 0.105) * (15/360) = 315 * (0.0416667) ≈ $13.125. But that's not an option either.

So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem again. The problem says he borrowed $3,000 and the rate is 10.5% for 180 days. So it's simple interest, and the time is 180 days. So using 365 days, the interest is $155.34, which is approximately $155.34. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use 360 days, making the time 0.5 years.

So according to that, 3000 * 0.105 * 0.5 = 157.50, which is option I.

But why is that the case? Because the question doesn't specify whether to use 360 or 365, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it's intended to use 360 days.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a 365-day year, so 180/365 is the time. So 3000 * 0.105 = 315. Then 315 * (180/365) = 315 * (approx 0.49315) ≈ 155.34, which isn't one of the options. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the rate is annual, and the time is 180 days, which is 0.5 years. So 3000 * 0.105 = 315, multiplied by 0.5 is 157.50, which is option I.

But looking at the options, I is 157.50. But none of the other options match that. The closest is H: 315, which is twice that. So perhaps the correct answer is I: 157.50.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time is 180 days, but using a simple interest formula where the rate is annual. So T is 180/365. So using that, the interest is approximately 155.34, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use 10.5% per annum for 180 days, which is half a year, so 3000 * 0.105 = 315. 315 * 0.5 = 157.50.

So the correct answer is I: 157.50.
</think>

To calculate the interest, use the simple interest formula: 

\( I = P \times R \times T \)

Where:
- \( P = \$3,000 \)
- \( R = 10.5\% \) or 0.105 per annum
- \( T = \frac{180}{365} \) years (since 180 days is approximately 0.49315 years)

Compute:
\( I = 3000 \times 0.105 \times 0.49315 \approx 3000 \times 0.105 = 315 \times 0.49315 \approx 155.34 \)

However, this value isn't an option. If the problem uses the 360-day year (180 days = 0.5 years), then:

\( I = 3000 \times 0.105 \times 0.5 = 315 \times 0.5 = 157.50 \)

Thus, the correct answer is:
