Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about meiosis and crossing-over. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question asks what crossing-over during meiosis allows scientists to determine. The options are A to J, each with a different concept. I remember that crossing-over is a process in meiosis where homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA. This is important because it affects how genes are inherited.

First, I'll go through each option to see which one makes sense. Let's see:

Option A: the rate of mutations. Well, crossing-over itself doesn't directly determine mutation rates. Mutation rates are more about the frequency of random changes, not meiosis. So A might not be correct.

Option B: the chance for variation in zygotes. Wait, when meiosis happens, homologs separate, and crossing-over could lead to recombinant chromosomes. This could increase the chances of different gametes and zygotes, leading to variation. So B seems plausible.

Option C: the age of an organism. I don't think so. The age is more about cell divisions, probably through DNA replication. Crossing-over doesn't directly tell us how old an organism is.

Option D: potential for genetic disorders. Yes, because crossing-over can lead to new combinations of alleles. If a parent has a certain genotype, their child might inherit a variant from their parent if crossing-over happens during gamete formation. So D is correct.

Option E: the sequence of DNA bases. Crossing-over affects the arrangement of DNA, but the sequence itself is determined by the original DNA. So it doesn't change the sequence, just the arrangement. So E is probably not the correct answer.

Option F: the rate of cell division. Again, rate of cell division is more about when and how cells divide, not directly about the process itself. So F doesn't seem right.

Option G: the number of chromosomes in a cell. Crossing-over doesn't change the number of chromosomes. The number is determined before meiosis, and crossing-over doesn't alter that. So G isn't the right answer.

Option H: which traits are dominant or recessive. This relates to how traits are passed on, like in Mendelian genetics. Crossing-over might affect this, but how does it determine which traits are dominant? I'm not sure. Maybe it doesn't directly determine that, so H might not be the correct choice.

Option I: the sex of an organism. No, crossing-over isn't about gender. It's about chromosome pairing, but that's more about cell division than determining sex.

Option J: the distance between genes on a chromosome. Crossing-over doesn't directly determine the physical distance between genes. The physical arrangement is more about where genes are located, but crossing-over itself doesn't change the actual distance. So J is not correct.

So, the options left that make sense are B, D, and J. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, crossing-over affects the arrangement but doesn't determine the number of chromosomes (G), unless it's about pairing. But G is about the number of chromosomes, and crossing-over doesn't change that. So B is about variation in zygotes, D is about genetic disorders potential.

Wait, the question is about what crossing-over allows scientists to determine. So B says the chance for variation in zygotes. That's correct because when meiosis occurs, crossing-over can lead to new combinations of alleles, thus increasing the variation in gametes and zygotes. 

D is about genetic disorders—because crossing-over can lead to recombinant chromosomes, which may have different traits, increasing the risk of genetic disorders. 

So the question is asking which of the options are things that crossing-over allows scientists to determine. Both B and D seem correct, but the question is a single choice. Wait, the question is a single correct answer.

Wait, let me re-read the options:

Options are:

B: the chance for variation in zygotes.

D: the potential for genetic disorders.

So both B and D seem correct. But the question is phrased as "which of the following" options, so perhaps the answer is D. Because crossing-over affects the potential for genetic disorders. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Crossing-over during meiosis could lead to recombinant chromosomes, which may carry different alleles, thus increasing the risk of genetic disorders. So D is about the potential for genetic disorders.

Alternatively, the chance for variation in zygotes (B) is also something that could be determined by crossing-over. But maybe the main things crossing-over allows are determining variation in gametes and the potential for new combinations, which can lead to genetic disorders.

Wait, but the question is about what crossing-over allows scientists to determine. So both B and D are correct. Hmm. But the options are A to J, single choice. So perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is D, because crossing-over affects the potential for genetic disorders, which is a form of variation in zygotes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because crossing-over can lead to new alleles in gametes, increasing the variance and thus the potential for genetic disorders. 

Wait, but the question is about what crossing-over allows scientists to determine. So, does crossing-over allow scientists to know the potential for genetic disorders? Or does it allow them to determine the chance of variation in zygotes?

Wait, no. Crossing-over during meiosis can lead to recombinant chromosomes, which can result in new combinations of genes. This can increase the chances of genetic disorders because the child might inherit different alleles. So the potential for genetic disorders is determined by crossing-over.

Wait, but the chance for variation in zygotes (B) is a broader concept. It refers to the possibility that zygotes may have new combinations of alleles. So crossing-over allows scientists to determine that variation is possible.

So perhaps both B and D are correct, but the question is a single choice. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is D because it's about the potential for genetic disorders, which is a direct result of crossing-over.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because crossing-over can lead to the formation of new alleles, thus increasing the risk of genetic disorders.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about the options. Option B says "the chance for variation in zygotes." Crossing-over leads to the formation of recombinant chromosomes, which can lead to new alleles in zygotes. So this allows scientists to determine the possibility of variation. So B is correct.

Option D says "the potential for genetic disorders." Crossing-over can lead to children inheriting different alleles, thus increasing the risk. So D is correct.

But the question is which option the crossing-over permits to determine. So both B and D are correct. But the options are given as single letters, so perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because variation in zygotes is a broader concept. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because crossing-over affects the formation of genetic material that may lead to disorders. So D is the correct answer.

Wait, but the first line of the question is "Crossing-over during meiosis permits scientists to determine..." So crossing-over is a process that allows scientists to determine certain things. So both options B and D seem correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because crossing-over leads to the potential for genetic disorders, which is a form of variation. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about what each option implies.

Option B: the chance for variation in zygotes. When meiosis occurs, crossing-over can lead to new chromosomes, which may cause variation in the zygotes. So crossing-over makes it possible to determine that variation is possible.

Option D: potential for genetic disorders. Crossing-over can increase the risk of genetic disorders by creating new allele combinations that may cause diseases.

So both B and D seem correct. But if I have to choose between them, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the wording.

The question is phrased as, which crossing-over allows scientists to determine. So, the ability of crossing-over to lead to variation in zygotes allows scientists to determine that variation is possible (B). It can also lead to genetic disorders, which is a potential for variation (D). But which one is it.

Wait, the question is about what is determined when crossing-over occurs. So, the chance for variation in zygotes (B) is a direct result of crossing-over, as it allows for new allele combinations. Similarly, D is about the potential, meaning the likelihood of genetic disorders, which is a result of crossing-over.

So the question is about what crossing-over permits scientists to determine. So both B and D are correct. But since the options are single letter, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because crossing-over affects the formation of gametes which may lead to genetic disorders.

I think I need to decide between B and D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because crossing-over allows scientists to determine the potential for genetic disorders, which are a result of new allele combinations.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The question asks which crossing-over during meiosis allows scientists to determine. Let’s analyze each option:

- **Option A**: The rate of mutations. Crossing-over does not determine mutation rates. Mutation rates are influenced by other factors like DNA replication and mutation frequency. Incorrect.

- **Option B**: The chance for variation in zygotes. Crossing-over during meiosis can lead to recombinant chromosomes, which increases the potential for variation in zygotes. This allows scientists to determine that variation is possible. Correct.

- **Option C**: The age of an organism. The age of an organism is determined by factors like DNA replication and cell division, not directly by crossing-over. Incorrect.

- **Option D**: The potential for genetic disorders. Crossing-over can create new allele combinations, increasing the risk of genetic disorders. This is a form of variation in zygotes. Correct.

- **Option E**: The sequence of DNA bases. Crossing-over affects DNA arrangement but does not change the sequence of DNA bases. Incorrect.

- **Option F**: The rate of cell division. The rate of cell division is determined by other processes, not directly by crossing-over. Incorrect.

- **Option G**: The number of chromosomes in a cell. Crossing-over does not change the number of chromosomes; it only affects their arrangement. Incorrect.

- **Option H**: Which traits are dominant or recessive. Crossing-over affects allele combinations but does not determine dominance or recessiveness. Incorrect.

- **Option I**: The sex of an organism. Crossing-over does not determine an organism’s sex. Incorrect.

- **Option J**: The distance between genes on a chromosome. Crossing-over does not determine gene distances. Incorrect.

Both **B** and **D** are correct, as crossing-over allows scientists to determine variation in zygotes and the potential for genetic disorders, respectively. However, since the question requires a single answer, **D** is the most appropriate choice, as it directly relates to genetic disorders, a significant outcome of crossing-over.

ANSWER: D
