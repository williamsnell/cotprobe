Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about noroviruses and the symptoms they cause. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that noroviruses are a type of herpesvirus. They can be both positive and negative. What do I know about their symptoms?

From what I've studied, noroviruses can cause mild to severe respiratory illnesses. I think the common ones include the common cold, but also more severe ones like bronchitis, pneumonia, and maybe even bronchopneal transmetable illnesses (BMTIs). But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Let's look at the options. The question asks which of these is typically caused by noroviruses. The options are A through J.

Option A: High fever and cough. I think these are more common in some norovirus types, like the common cold, but I'm not certain if they're the typical causes of norovirus infections. Also, the question is about the typical causes, so maybe the more severe or common ones are the right answer.

Option B: Severe headache and muscle pain. I don't recall noroviruses causing headaches or muscle pain. That sounds more like a viral infection or something else.

Option C: Disease of the central nervous system. I think some norovirus infections do affect the nervous system, like if the virus is transmitted through the respiratory system and can cause things like bronchitis or pneumonia. So this could be a possible cause.

Option D: Loss of taste and smell. I don't think noroviruses cause such a severe loss as that. The body usually has mechanisms to handle most things, so this seems unlikely.

Option E: Projectile vomiting and diarrhea. Some norovirus infections can lead to vomiting and diarrhea, but are these the typical causes? I believe that some cases do, but maybe not the most common.

Option F: Rash. I'm not sure. Norovirus infections are generally mild, but would they cause a rash? Maybe some can, but I don't think that's the typical answer.

Option G: Rash and fever. I'm not sure about fever and a rash. Probably not the typical cause for noroviruses.

Option H: Diarrhea. That's more like a common gastrointestinal issue, and I don't think noroviruses cause that as much as, say, a gastroenteritis from a severe case of food poisoning.

Option I: Breathlessness and chest pain. That sounds like it could be related to infections causing respiratory issues, like Pneumonia. Breathing difficulties and chest pain are common symptoms in certain Norovirus cases.

Option J: Persistent hiccups and diarrhea. Hiccups come from the respiratory system, but I don't think noroviruses cause them, and diarrhea is less likely.

So putting it all together, the typical symptoms of norovirus infections are usually respiratory. So options I and C are possible. Wait, but I thought some types of noroviruses cause more severe respiratory issues, while others are mild.

Wait, another thought: Some Norovirus types can cause bronchitis, which is a respiratory illness. That would be option I, which mentions breathlessness and chest pain, which fits. But option C is about the central nervous system, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another point: Norovirus infections are usually mild, but some can lead to more severe respiratory issues. So the typical symptoms would be respiratory. So option I (I think) is a possible correct answer.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Norovirus infections are often mild, but some can be more severe. They cause respiratory illnesses, which would include things like bronchitis, pneumonia, etc. So the most common symptoms might be respiratory, like I.

But wait, I'm not 100% confident. Let me think about the possible options again.

Another approach: look up what Norovirus infections are known for. Norovirus A is commonly associated with bronchitis, pneumonia, and other respiratory illnesses. Norovirus B causes more severe respiratory conditions. Norovirus E is linked to bronchitis and pneumonia, while Norovirus O can cause bronchitis and other respiratory issues.

So the most common and typical symptoms for Norovirus would be respiratory, which would be options I (if the question refers to I) or C.

Wait, the question is asking which is "typically caused by". So the most common or typical would be respiratory (I) or perhaps the disease affecting the central nervous system (C).

Wait, but I think that the disease of the central nervous system is a result of the virus causing an infection, which could be due to a virus that affects the central nervous system, such as Norovirus E or O. But would that be the typical cause? Or does the typical cause involve respiratory issues?

Wait, another point: Some Norovirus infections can cause a rash or other systemic issues, but are those the typical symptoms? I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, I think that the typical symptoms of Norovirus infections are respiratory, so options I and C. But the question is about the typical, not the most common. So which is the more likely correct answer.

Wait, the question is in the context of an exam question, which often focuses on the more common symptoms. So perhaps the correct answer is I (I think), because it's about respiratory issues, which are more likely the typical causes.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again:

The options are:

A: High fever and cough - could be some Norovirus types, but is it the typical?

B: Severe headache and muscle pain - not likely.

C: Disease of the central nervous system - could be a result of an infection, but is that typical?

D: Loss of taste and smell - no.

E: Projectile vomiting and diarrhea - possible, but maybe not the typical.

F: Rash - possibly, but not typical.

G: Rash and fever - both may occur, but perhaps not the typical.

H: Diarrhea - not the typical.

I: Breathlessness and chest pain - likely, as a respiratory issue.

J: Persistent hiccups and diarrhea - less likely.

So the correct answer is I.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: I thought that some Norovirus infections cause a rash. For example, Norovirus E is associated with severe respiratory issues, but in some cases, it can lead to a rash if the virus is transmitted through the respiratory tract. But that's a more severe case, perhaps.

Alternatively, I'm not sure if the typical norovirus causes a rash. 

Wait, the question is about the last character of the answer. Let me check the options again.

The options are labeled A to J, and each has a certain last letter. The correct answer is to choose the option whose last letter is, say, I. But looking at the options, the last letters of the options are:

A: F
B: F
C: G
D: F
E: J
F: R
G: R
H: A
I: J
J: A

So the last letters of the options are F, F, G, F, J, R, R, A, J, A.

Wait, but the correct answer is I, which is option I. So the last letter of option I is J, which is the ninth letter. Wait, no, option I is "Breathlessness and chest pain." The last letter is J, which is the 10th letter of the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., J=10). 

But wait, the options are labeled from A to J, and the answer choices are each a letter, so the correct answer's last letter is the letter of the option. So the correct answer is option I, which has the last letter J. So the answer to the question, which is "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen," is J. But the options are A to J, each with their own letters. Wait, no, the options are A to J, each with a letter, and the question is which of these is the answer, so the answer is the letter J, but the options are labeled A to J, each with a letter. So the correct option is I, whose last letter is J.

Wait, but the question is which option is the correct answer, and the answer must be J. Looking at the options, the correct choice is I, which has the last letter J. So the last character of the answer must be J.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each being a letter. So if the correct answer is option I, then the correct letter is J, which is the last letter of option I. So the answer is I, and the last character is J.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit confusingly. The question is: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So I need to select the option whose last character in the label is the chosen letter. So if the correct answer is I, which is option I, then the last character of the answer is J.

So the answer is I, with J as the last letter.
</think>

The correct answer is I: "Breathlessness and chest pain." Norovirus infections typically cause respiratory issues, including symptoms like breathlessness and chest pain, which correspond to the last letter of option I, J. 

Answer: I
