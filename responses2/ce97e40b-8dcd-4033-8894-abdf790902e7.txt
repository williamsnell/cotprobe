Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says to write 11 multiplied by itself seven times, written as 11 • 11 • 11 • 11 • 11 • 11 • 11 • 11, using exponents. The options are A through J, each with different exponents or powers. Hmm.

Wait, exponents are like when you have a number multiplied by itself multiple times. So, when you see something like 11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 11, that's seven 11s multiplied together. In exponent form, that should be 11 raised to the power of 7, right? Because each multiplication is a power of 11.

Let me think: 11^1 is 11, 11^2 is 11*11, so each time the exponent increases by 1, you multiply another 11. So for seven 11s, it's 11^7. That would correspond to option C: 11^7. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The question is about 11 multiplied seven times, so the exponent is 7. So I don't think it's 88 or any other base number. Option A is 88^3, which would be 88 multiplied three times, not seven. Option B is 11^11, which is way too high. Option D, E, I, J are all either 8 or 88 with exponents, which don't match seven. So the correct one must be 11^7, which is option C.

The expression 11 multiplied by itself seven times is represented as 11^7. 

Answer: C: 11^7
