Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about chemical equilibrium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The reaction given is 3C₂H₂ ⇌ C₆H₆. The equilibrium constant, Keq, is 4. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, the problem says Keq is 4 for this reaction. But wait, the question is about the concentration of C₆H₆. Oh right, but I don't know the concentrations of either reactant or product yet. Wait, no, wait. The problem says the equilibrium concentration of C₂H₂ is 0.5 mole per liter. Oh, so [C₂H₂] is 0.5 M. I need to find [C₆H₆].

But wait, the reaction equation is 3 moles of C₂H₂ turning into 1 mole of C₆H₆, so the stoichiometric coefficients matter here. I remember that the equilibrium expression is based on these coefficients. Let me write out the expression for Keq.

Keq = [C₆H₆] / ([C₂H₂]^3). Because, for every 3 moles of C₂H₂ that react, one mole of C₆H₆ is formed. So, the denominator would be [C₂H₂]^3, and the numerator is [C₆H₆].

But wait, the problem says the Keq is 4. So, 4 = [C₆H₆]/(0.5)^3. Let me compute (0.5)^3 first. 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25, times another 0.5 is 0.125.

So, 4 = [C₆H₆]/0.125. To find [C₆H₆], I can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by 0.125. So, [C₆H₆] = 4 * 0.125. Let's compute that: 4 times 0.125 is 0.5. So [C₆H₆] would be 0.5 M.

Wait, but wait a second. That seems straightforward. So, looking at the options, option I is 0.5 mol/L. So is that the answer? Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the reaction coefficients or the setup.

Wait another thought: Could the reaction be reversible? So, if the reaction is going forward, the products would have a higher concentration. But in this case, the reaction is written as 3C₂H₂ ⇌ C₆H₆, meaning 3 moles of the dihydrogen compound form one mole of benzene. So, the reaction is moving towards the products.

But the given [C₂H₂] is 0.5, which is the reactant. So, if the reaction is going to produce more C₆H₆ (since Keq is 4, which is greater than 1), the concentration of C₆H₆ should be higher than [C₂H₂], right? Because when K is greater than 1, the products are favored, so higher product concentration.

Wait, but in this calculation, [C₆H₆] is 0.5, which is the same as [C₂H₂]. That seems odd. Another way to think: if the equilibrium expression is [C₆H₆]/([C₂H₂]^3) = 4. Let me plug in the values again.

So Keq = [C6H6] / (0.5)^3 =4. 0.5 cubed is 0.125. So [C6H6] = 4 * 0.125 = 0.5. So it's 0.5, which is option I.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think about the stoichiometry again. Another possibility is that I might have written the reaction the wrong way. The reaction is 3C₂H₂ → C₆H₆. So, it's a reverse reaction. Let me think: if the reaction is going backward, then the reverse would be 1 C₆H₆ ⇌ 3 C₂H₂, and Keq for the reverse reaction would be 1/4.

Wait, but the problem gives Keq as 4 for the forward reaction. So, yeah, I think my initial approach is correct. So, the concentration of C6H6 is 0.5 M, which is option I. So the answer should be I.

The reaction given is \( 3C_2H_2 \rightleftarrows C_6H_6 \), with an equilibrium constant \( K_{eq} = 4 \). The equilibrium concentration of \( C_2H_2 \) is provided as 0.5 mole/liter, and the task is to determine the equilibrium concentration of \( C_6H_6 \).

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{eq} = \frac{[C_6H_6]}{[C_2H_2]^3}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
4 = \frac{[C_6H_6]}{(0.5)^3}
\]

First, calculate \( (0.5)^3 \):

\[
(0.5)^3 = 0.125
\]

Now, solve for \( [C_6H_6] \):

\[
[C_6H_6] = 4 \times 0.125 = 0.5 \, \text{mol/liter}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( C_6H_6 \) is 0.5 mol/liter, which corresponds to option I.
