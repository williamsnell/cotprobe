Okay, so I've got this question about monopolistically competitive industries and what happens when new firms enter. Hmm. Let me think.

Monopolistically competitive industries are characterized by a bunch of firms selling slightly different products. Right, so each firm has some market power because their products are somewhat differentiated. But wait, in such markets, I remember that the number of firms is usually high, not too many. So if one firm makes a profit, would that affect others?

The question says that in this industry, the firms are enjoying above-normal profits. So the existing firms are making more money than they would in a perfectly competitive market. Now, what happens when other firms enter the industry?

I think in perfect competition, entry of new firms typically leads to the market price falling to the level of average total cost. That's because in perfect competition, existing firms don't have market power; new ones can't enter. But here, it's monopolistically competitive, so maybe the situation is different.

In monopolistic competition, each firm has some market power, but not as much as in perfect competition. So if existing firms are making above-normal profits, maybe they can attract new customers. New firms might enter because they find the existing products attractive enough to attract some customers.

When new firms enter, what happens to costs? Well, each new firm's entry would probably involve some new costs. But in monopolistic competition, I think the difficulty of entry is lower than in perfect competition because firms are more differentiated. So new firms might have lower costs than the existing ones. But wait, no, wait.

Wait, in monopolistic competition, each firm's average total cost is typically lower than in perfect competition because there are more firms. So when a new firm enters, it can probably lower its average total cost because it has more firms in the market to compete with.

But wait, if the existing firms are making above-normal profits, do they affect the entry? Or does the entry lead to lower costs for all? Or maybe the entry makes it so that the average cost decreases as new firms enter, leading to lower costs for all.

Alternatively, sometimes in industries with free entry (like perfect competition), when new firms enter, the market price falls to the level of average total cost, so the average cost remains the same. But in monopolistic competition, since the market isn't as competitive, maybe new firms can lower their costs, but the average cost is lower than in perfect competition.

Wait, another angle: In monopolistic competition, the number of firms is high, so each firm's average cost is lower. When new firms enter, the market becomes more competitive, so entry would cause the average cost to decrease because there are more firms, each with lower costs. So the entry of new firms would lower the average cost.

But wait, the question is about what happens to the costs of existing firms. Or, wait, the question is about the costs as other firms enter. So if new firms enter, perhaps the average cost decreases because the market becomes more competitive.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of existing high-profit firms makes it easier for new ones to enter because the market is more attractive. So new firms can lower production costs, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about what happens to costs as other firms enter. So if new firms are entering, the market becomes more competitive. So existing firms' costs would decrease.

Wait, no. If existing firms are already making above-normal profits, perhaps they can attract new customers, leading to entry. If entry increases competition, then the average cost for all firms, including existing ones, would decrease. So the costs would decrease.

But wait, in perfect competition, new firms can't enter because they're already making zero profits. In monopolistic competition, it's possible for new firms to enter because they can make above-normal profits.

So if new firms are entering, the market becomes more competitive. That would mean that the average cost of all firms, including the existing ones, would decrease.

Wait, but the question is about what happens to costs as other firms enter. So as new firms come in, the existing ones' costs go down. Or, perhaps, the presence of existing high-profit firms might allow new firms to lower their costs.

Alternatively, sometimes in industries with free entry (like perfect competition), when new firms enter, the market price falls to the level of average total cost. But in monopolistic competition, the market is not perfectly competitive, so the entry of new firms might not necessarily lower the average cost.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a real example. Suppose a market has 100 firms, each with average cost of $10. Now, if a new firm enters, what happens to the average cost? If the new firm can enter without reducing costs (like in a perfectly competitive market), then the average cost remains $10. But in monopolistic competition, the cost structure might be different.

Wait, no, in monopolistic competition, the number of firms is high, which usually leads to lower average costs. Because with more firms, each has a smaller share of the total costs. So when new firms enter, the average cost decreases.

So if existing firms are making above-normal profits, new firms can enter. As new firms enter, the market becomes more competitive, so the average cost for all firms (including existing ones) decreases.

Wait, but the question is about what happens to costs as other firms enter. So as new firms come in, the existing ones' costs go down. Or, perhaps, the presence of existing high-profit firms might allow new firms to lower their costs.

Alternatively, sometimes in industries with free entry (like perfect competition), when new firms enter, the average cost remains the same because all firms have the same cost structure. But in monopolistic competition, since all firms have different cost structures, the presence of new firms might allow existing ones to lower their costs.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another approach.

Monopolistic competitive markets are characterized by:

- Many firms, each producing a slightly different product.

- Firms have some market power (differentiated products).

- entry into the market is relatively easy (so free entry).

In such a market, the number of firms is high, so each firm's average cost is lower than in perfect competition.

So when new firms enter, the market becomes more competitive, which leads to lower average costs for all firms.

Therefore, as other firms enter the industry, the costs of the existing firms would decrease.

Wait, but the existing firms were making above-normal profits. So if the market becomes more competitive, their average costs would decrease, leading to higher profits. But in terms of costs themselves, their average costs go down.

Wait, but the question is about what happens to costs as other firms enter. So as new firms enter, the average cost of all firms, including existing ones, would decrease. So existing costs would go down as new firms come in.

So the correct answer would be option B: costs will decrease.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: in a perfectly competitive market, entry doesn't affect costs because all firms are identical. But in monopolistic competition, the cost structures are different. So when new firms enter, maybe the average cost of existing firms drops because they can now compete with the lower costs of new firms.

So the presence of new firms would lower the average cost for existing ones, so the costs would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of existing high profit firms makes it easier for new firms to enter because they can make above-normal profits, which can attract more customers. But during the entry process, perhaps the cost structures adjust.

Wait, but maybe the entry leads to lower average costs, so the answer is that costs will decrease. So the answer is option B.

In a monopolistically competitive industry, the presence of existing firms enjoying above-normal profits suggests that the market is more competitive than in a perfectly competitive market. As new firms enter the industry, the number of firms increases, which typically leads to lower average costs due to greater competition. This is because, in monopolistic competition, the market is not perfectly competitive, but the difficulty of entry is lower than in perfect competition. Therefore, as new firms enter, the market becomes more competitive, and the average cost of all firms, including the existing ones, decreases.

The correct answer is that as other firms enter the industry, the costs of existing firms will decrease.
