Okay, so I've got this question about the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and I need to figure out which subtests are part of the classic aging pattern. The options given are A to I, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that the classic aging pattern refers to how an individual's performance in certain subtests changes over time. It's based on the idea that younger adults perform better than older ones, while older adults perform worse.

The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised has several subtests. I think the Block Design subtest is one of them. I remember that Block Design assesses the ability to mentally rotate objects and categorize them by their appearance. So older adults probably do worse on this because they can't mentally rotate things as well.

Then there's the Vocabulary subtest. I think younger adults have better vocabulary. So as you age, their vocabulary tends to decline. That fits into the classic aging pattern.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is just the Vocabulary subtest, which makes sense because younger adults have better vocabulary. Option B says all subtests except Block Design. I'm not sure about that. Because Block Design is specifically about visual perception, which I think declines as you age. So if someone is older, they might perform worse on Block Design. But does this affect the classic aging pattern?

Wait, the classic pattern is about the decline in performance across different subtests. So if you have a pattern where younger adults score higher on all tests and older adults worse on all, that's the classic. So for the classic pattern, the subtests that show decline would be the ones that are part of the pattern. So the subtests that are older than younger would have higher scores.

So which subtests decline with age? Block Design and Vocabulary. So older adults have lower scores on these. So in the classic aging pattern, the subtests that are part of it are those where older adults show lower scores, which are Block Design and Vocabulary.

So looking at the options: option D is just Vocabulary, but option A includes both Block Design and Vocabulary. Option B says all except Block Design. Option E is all performance subtests. But I think the classic pattern refers to the decline across specific subtests, not all of them.

Wait, another thought: the classic pattern is more about the decline in specific areas, not all subtests. So the correct answer would be the subtests that show decline, which are Block Design and Vocabulary. But looking at the options, the only one that includes both is A: Arithmetic and Digit Span. No, that's not it. Option E is all performance subtests, which might include those that decline.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things. Let me think again. The classic pattern is defined as 2 declines on each of two subtests. I'm pretty sure that the two subtests in question are Block Design and Vocabulary. So in the classic pattern, older adults score lower on both. So which options include those?

Option D is just the Vocabulary subtest. Option A includes Arithmetic and Digit Span. I'm not sure about those. Option B is all except Block Design. So that's the opposite. Option E is all performance subtests. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is specifically about two subtests that declineâ€”Block Design and Vocabulary. Then the answer would be option A, which includes Arithmetic and Digit Span. Wait, but that doesn't include the decline subtests. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think: The classic pattern refers to the decline in performance across the block design and vocabulary subtests. So the correct answer would be the option that includes both of these. But looking at the options, the only one that includes both is A (if it's arithmetic and digit span, which don't decline, so that's not it). Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, which is vocabulary only.

Wait, but the classic pattern is about two subtests declining. So the correct answer should include both Block Design and Vocabulary. But none of the options directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Arithmetic and Digit Span. Not sure about these.

Option D: Vocabulary only.

Option E: All performance subtests.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B. Wait, no, B says all except Block Design. That's the opposite.

Wait, another angle: the classic pattern refers to two subtests that decline, which are Block Design and Vocabulary. So the correct answer would be the option that includes both. But the options don't have an option that includes both. So perhaps I'm wrong in my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the components. The classic aging pattern is based on the decline in performance across the Block Design subtest and the Vocabulary subtest. So the correct answer would be the subtests that are part of the classic pattern, which are Block Design and Vocabulary. But looking at the options, the only one that includes both is A: Arithmetic and Digit Span, which I don't think are the ones that decline. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that's all performance subtests, which might include those that decline.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to remember. The classic pattern includes two subtests: Block Design and Vocabulary. So the correct answer should include both. But the options don't have such an option. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, because if all performance subtests decline, then the classic pattern is that. But that doesn't make sense because not all performance subtests decline.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. No, because arithmetic and digit span are not the ones that decline. Let me think, arithmetic and digit span are subtests in the Wechsler Scale, but they are more about numerical ability and number processing. So younger adults have better in these, and older adults worse. So they don't decline as much as Block Design and Vocabulary.

Wait, the answer is option A: Arithmetic and Digit Span. Or option E? No, because they don't show decline. So maybe the correct answer is E, but that's all performance subtests, which may include those that decline. But the classic pattern is about two specific subtests. So perhaps the answer is D: Vocabulary only, but that's only one. But the classic pattern refers to two subtests.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The classic aging pattern is defined as 2 declines on Block Design and Vocabulary. So the correct answer should include both. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is E: All performance subtests, because the classic pattern is about decrement in performance across various subtests, not just a single one.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D: Vocabulary, but that's only one, but the classic pattern mentions two subtests. So perhaps the correct options are A and E, but the options are single letters.

Wait, the options are single letters, so which option includes both Block Design and Vocabulary? None of the options A to I do. So perhaps I'm wrong about the options.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Arithmetic and Digit Span

B: All except Block Design

C: Similarities and Picture Completion

D: Vocabulary only

E: All Performance subtests

F: Block Design only

G: All subtests except Vocabulary

H: Information and Comprehension

I: All Verbal

So, the correct answer is the one that includes both Block Design and Vocabulary. But the options don't have an option combining both. Instead, option A includes Arithmetic and Digit Span, which I think are more stable, not declining. Option E is all performance subtests, which includes all, including those that decline. But the classic pattern refers to two specific subtests, not all.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but the reasoning is that the classic pattern refers to the decline across the two subtests. So the answer is E, because all performance subtests would include those that decline. So the answer would be E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: Vocabulary. But that's one subtest. But I thought the classic pattern refers to two subtests.

Wait, another thought: the classic pattern is that older adults have lower scores on two subtests, Block Design and Vocabulary. So the correct answer is the one that includes both, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that's a bit odd.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Another way: the classic pattern refers to two specific subtests. So the correct answer should be the option that includes both, which is not present. So perhaps the intended answer is E, as the classic pattern refers to two subtests, and all performance subtests include those. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: All except Block Design. No, that's the opposite. Then again, maybe the correct answer is A: Arithmetic and Digit Span. I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: All performance subtests. Because the classic pattern refers to the general decline in performance, including those that decline in two specific subtests. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each subtest:

Block Design: Older adults have worse scores.

Vocabulary: Older adults have worse scores.

Arithmetic and Digit Span: These are more stable, not declining. So they are not part of the classic pattern.

Similarities and Picture Completion: These are also more stable.

All Verbal: More stable.

Information and Comprehension: More stable.

All Performance: Includes all, including those that decline.

So the classic pattern refers to the decline in two subtests. So the correct answer should include those two. But since they aren't an option, perhaps the intended answer is E: All Performance subtests.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: All except Block Design. No, that's the opposite.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. The correct answer is E. Because the classic pattern is that older adults have lower scores on two subtests, which are Block Design and Vocabulary. So the answer is the option that includes both. But since there's no such option, perhaps the answer is E, because it's the only one that includes all performance subtests, implying a decline across all.

Wait, I'm concluding that the correct answer is B: All except Block Design. No, that's the opposite. So I think I'm stuck, but I think the answer is E: All Performance subtests.

Wait, no, because the classic pattern refers to two specific subtests. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: Vocabulary only. But that's only one.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E, because all performance subtests include the ones that decline. So the answer is E.
</think>

The classic aging pattern refers to the decline in performance across specific subtests as individuals age. The Block Design and Vocabulary subtests are key, where older adults have lower scores due to their decline. However, none of the options directly include both Block Design and Vocabulary. 

Option E states "All Performance subtests," which implies a general decline across all subtests, including those that decline. This aligns with the idea that the classic pattern involves a decline in performance across various subtests. While the decline is specifically noted in Block Design and Vocabulary, the broader context of the pattern is best represented by E.
