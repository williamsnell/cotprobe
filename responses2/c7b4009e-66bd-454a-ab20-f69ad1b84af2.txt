Okay, so I've got this question about electromotive force and the equilibrium constant. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is asking what the electromotive force (emf) is when K is the equilibrium constant and Q is the concentration quotient. The options are A through J, with some numerical values and some options involving ln(Q) or ln(K).

Wait, wait. I remember that electromotive force relates to the driving force in a galvanic cell, which is the difference in potential between two half-cells. Oh right, the Nernst equation comes into play here. The Nernst equation connects the cell potential with the concentrations of the substances involved, the reaction quotient Q, and the gas constant and temperature, I think.

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q, where E° is the standard electrode potential. Oh wait, but the question is about emf, not E°. Oh, wait no, wait. The question says "the electromotive force (emf) of a system when K, the equilibrium constant for the reaction = Q, the concentration quotient?" Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the emf of a cell is determined by the concentrations and activities of the species involved, but the question is about the emf of the system when K equals Q. Hmm, perhaps I should think about what the relationship between K and Q is. Oh, right! At equilibrium, Q equals K. So K = Q when the system is at equilibrium.

But wait, the question is about the emf. How do these connect? Oh wait, maybe it's about the cell potential when the reaction is at equilibrium. At equilibrium, the cell potential is zero because there's no net current—so the cell is not driving any reaction. So the emf would be zero. That would point to option I.

Alternatively, think about the Nernst equation. When Q equals K, the reaction quotient equals the equilibrium constant. Substituting that into the Nernst equation would give E = E° - (RT/nF) ln K. But wait, when the system is at equilibrium, E would be zero if the cell is under standard conditions. Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the emf of a system when K equals Q. So when Q=K, the system is at equilibrium. At that point, the cell potential (emf) is zero because there's no driving force for electron transfer. So the emf would be zero. Therefore, the correct answer would be option I: 0.

Another angle: the emf is related to the driving force, which is the difference between the potentials of the cathode and anode. At equilibrium, these potentials are equal, so the difference is zero. So the emf is zero.

The question asks for the electromotive force (emf) of a system when the equilibrium constant \( K \) equals the concentration quotient \( Q \). At equilibrium, \( Q = K \), and the system is not undergoing any net change, meaning the cell potential (emf) is zero. This is because the emf drives the reaction in a direction to reach equilibrium, and once there, no further change occurs. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option I (0)**: This is correct because the emf of the system at equilibrium is zero.

Other options are incorrect because they either represent impossible scenarios (e.g., negative values for emf) or unrelated to the equilibrium condition.
