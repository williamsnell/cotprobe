Question:

In snapdragons, plants homozygous for red have red flowers; those homozygous for white have white flowers, and thosewhich are heterozygous have pink. If a pink flowered snapdragonis crossed with a white flowered plant, what will bethe expected phenotypic results in the progeny?

Options:

A: (1/2) RʹR pink (1/2) RʹRʹ white
B: (1/4) RR red (3/4) RʹRʹ white
C: (3/4) RʹRʹ white (1/4) RʹR pink
D: All RʹR pink
E: (3/4) RʹR pink (1/4) RʹRʹ white
F: (1/2) RʹRʹ white (1/2) RR red
G: (1/3) RʹRʹ white (2/3) RR red
H: All RʹRʹ white
I: (1/2) RR red (1/2) RʹR pink
J: (1/2) RR red (1/2) RʹRʹ white

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about snapdragons. I remember snapdragons are snapdragons, so maybe I should think about flower color and the genetics behind it.

The question says that snapdragons have three possible genotypes: homozygous red (RR), homozygous white (rr), and heterozygous (Rr). The flowers are red if RR, white if rr, and pink if Rr. 

The setup is that a pink-flowered snapdragon is crossed with a white-flowered plant. Wait, but wait, the white-flowered plant is homozygous because if it's white, then its genotype must be rr. So the pink one is Rr. So the cross is Rr (pink) × rr (white).

In genetics, when you cross a heterozygote (Rr) with a homozygous recessive (rr), the outcome is all the offspring will be Rr, right? Because the parent with rr can only give r to the offspring. So the offspring would all be Rr, which means they have pink flowers. 

So looking at the options, which one shows all the offspring as Rr (pink)? Let's check the options:

Option A: 1/2 R' R pink and 1/2 R' R' white. That's red and white. No, because the pink parent (Rr) can't give R' (R'), so white can't be a result.

Option B: 1/4 RR, 3/4 R' R'. So red (RR) and white (R' R'), which would be white. But the pink parent can't contribute R' because it's Rr. So B can't be correct.

Option C: 3/4 R' R' white and 1/4 R' R' pink. Wait, that's a typo. R' R' is white, and R' R is pink. But wait, the cross is Rr (pink) with rr. So all offspring should be Rr (pink). So C is wrong because it's saying some are white and some pink. No, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the parent is Rr and the other is rr, each offspring gets one R and one r. So all Rr. So phenotype is pink. So C is incorrect.

Option D: All R' R' white. That's not possible because the pink parent (Rr) gives R to some.

Option E: 3/4 R' R' white and 1/4 R' R pink. Again, this is mixing up. The R' R' is white, but if the parent is Rr, all offspring must be Rr, which is pink. So E is wrong.

Option F: 1/2 R' R' white and 1/2 RR red. That's the opposite of what we expect. F's parents are Rr and rr, so F's children should all be Rr (pink). So F isn't right.

Option G: 1/3 white, 2/3 red. Wait, how? Let me think. Oh wait, no. Because the cross is Rr (heterozygote) with rr. So all offspring should be Rr (pink). So G is wrong because it's showing a 2:1 ratio, which would be R^2 to Rr (or whatever), but that's the case when you're crossing a heterozygous with a homozygous recessive. So G's ratio is 1/3 white (rr) and 2/3 red (Rr). But that's if the cross is between two Rr and Rr, or when the parents are Rr and Rr. But in this case, the pink parent is Rr and the other is rr, so it's Rr × rr. So all offspring would be Rr, which is pink. So G is incorrect.

Option I: (1/2) RR red and (1/2) Rr pink. So half red and half pink. That's not correct because the Rr would all be pink, not half. So I is wrong.

Option J: 1/2 RR red and 1/2 Rr pink. Yes, exactly. Because the cross is Rr × rr. All offspring are Rr (pink). So the expected phenotypic results are half RR (red) and half Rr (pink). So the correct answer is J.

The question involves determining the phenotypic results of a cross between a pink-flowered snapdragon (Rr) and a white-flowered snapdragon (rr). Snapdragons exhibit flower color based on genetic inheritance: homozygous red (RR) produces red flowers, homozygous white (rr) produces white flowers, and heterozygous (Rr) produces pink flowers.

When a pink-flowered snapdragon (Rr) is crossed with a white-flowered snapdragon (rr), all offspring will inherit one R allele from the pink parent and one r allele from the white parent, resulting in a heterozygous (Rr) genotype. Since Rr produces pink flowers, all offspring will exhibit pink flowers. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It includes both red (RR) and white (rr) phenotypes, which is not possible since the pink parent cannot contribute an r allele.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It includes red (RR) and white (rr) phenotypes, which is not possible since the pink parent cannot contribute an R' allele.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It incorrectly labels one group as white and the other as pink, which contradicts the expected phenotype of pink flowers.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It incorrectly labels one group as white and the other as red, which is the opposite of the expected phenotype.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It incorrectly labels one group as white and the other as pink, which is the opposite of the expected phenotype.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It labels one group as white and the other as red, which is the opposite of the expected phenotype.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. It incorrectly labels the groups as 1/3 white and 2/3 red, which is the result of a different genetic cross (e.g., between two heterozygotes).
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It incorrectly labels all offspring as white, which is not possible since the pink parent cannot contribute an r allele.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It labels half of the offspring as red and half as pink, but all offspring should be pink.
- **Option J**: Correct. It accurately reflects the expected phenotypic outcomes: 1/2 RR red and 1/2 Rr pink.

The correct answer is **J: (1/2) RR red (1/2) R' R' white**.
