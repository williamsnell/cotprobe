Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because complex numbers can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. The expression is (i + 1)(5 – 5i)(5 + 5i). Hmm, I think I remember that when you have products of complex numbers, especially involving conjugates, that might simplify things.

Wait, what's a conjugate? Oh right, the conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a – bi. And when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you get a real number because the imaginary parts cancel out. So, for example, (a + bi)(a – bi) = a² + b². That's because (a + bi)(a – bi) = a² - (bi)² = a² - b²i², and since i² is -1, it becomes a² + b².

Looking at the expression, I see two factors here: (5 – 5i) and (5 + 5i). Oh, those are conjugates of each other! So maybe I can multiply those first and then handle the (i + 1) part.

Let me write this down:

First, multiply (5 – 5i) and (5 + 5i). Let's call them A and B for easier writing.

A = 5 – 5i
B = 5 + 5i

Their product is A * B = (5)(5) + (5)(5i) – (5i)(5) – (5i)(5i).

Wait, but actually, using the conjugate property, it's easier. A * B = (5)^2 + (5)^2 because i squared is -1. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for conjugates is (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So, in this case, a is 5 and b is 5i. So, (5)^2 - (5i)^2.

Calculating each term:

5 squared is 25.

(5i)^2 is 25i², and since i² is -1, that's 25*(-1) = -25.

So, A * B = 25 - (-25) = 25 + 25 = 50. Oh, so the product is 50.

Now the original expression becomes (i + 1) * 50. Which is 50*(i + 1), which is 50i + 50, or written as 50 + 50i.

Looking at the options, option C is 50 + 50i. So, that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in my calculations? Let me go through it again.

Multiply (5 – 5i)(5 +5i):

= 5*5 +5*5i -5i*5 -5i*5i
=25 +25i -25i -25i²
=25 +0i -25(-1)
=25 +25
=50.

Yes, correct. Then multiply by (i +1):

50*(i +1) = 50i +50 → 50 +50i → which is option C.

So I think I'm confident that the answer is option C.

The expression (i + 1)(5 – 5i)(5 + 5i) simplifies by recognizing that (5 – 5i) and (5 + 5i) are conjugates. Their product is 50. Multiplying 50 by (i + 1) gives 50 + 50i, which is option C.

Answer: C
