Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about time dilation in special relativity. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that an observer on Earth measures the lifetime of a neutron as 6.42 × 10^2 seconds. Now, we need to find out what the lifetime would be as measured by someone in a spacecraft moving past Earth at a speed of 2 × 10^8 m/s. Hmm, right, time dilation comes into play here because the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, I remember that time dilation is when time intervals measured in a moving frame appear longer than those in the stationary frame. The formula, if I recall correctly, is the Lorentz factor gamma multiplied by the proper time. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, the lifetime observed in the spacecraft (the moving frame) would be gamma times the proper time (the Earth's frame).

Let me write that down. Proper time (t₀) is the time measured in the rest frame, which is Earth's frame in this case. The observed time (t) would be t = gamma * t₀.

So, first I need to calculate gamma. The speed v is given as 2e8 m/s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So, v/c = (2e8)/(3e8) = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. 

The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging v/c = 2/3 into the equation: v²/c² is (4/9), so 1 - 4/9 is 5/9. Square root of 5/9 is sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745. So gamma is 1 / 0.745 ≈ 1.34. Wait, but wait, 1/sqrt(5/9) is 3/sqrt(5), which is approximately 3/2.236 ≈ 1.34.

So gamma ≈ 1.34.

Now, the proper time t₀ is 6.42e2 seconds. Multiplying by gamma gives the observed time t. So t = 1.34 * 642 seconds.

Let me calculate 1.34 * 642. Let's break it down: 642 * 1 = 642, 642 * 0.3 = 192.6, 642 * 0.04 = 25.68. Adding them together: 642 + 192.6 = 834.6; 834.6 +25.68 = 859.28. Hmm, wait, but that's 1.34 as 1 + 0.3 + 0.04. Wait, 1.34 =1 + 0.3 + 0.04? Wait, no, 0.3 is 30%, 0.04 is 4%... 1.34 is 134/100 = 1.34.

Wait, but 642 * 1.34: Let me compute 642 * 1 = 642. 642 * 0.3 = 192.6. 642 * 0.04 = 25.68. So adding them: 642 + 192.6 is 834.6, plus 25.68 gives 859.28 s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 1.34 × 6.42e2 s. Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 8.62e2 s
B: 2e8 s
C: 6.42e2 s
D: 5.67e2 s
E: 7.84e2 s
F: 12.84e2 s
G: 4.81e2 s
H: 1.34 × 6.42e2 s → Wait, that's written as 1.34 ×6.42e2, but that's a typo because 1.34 would be the factor. Maybe it's H: 1.34 × 6.42e2 s? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps H is 1.34e2, but that would be 134 s.

Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote option H as "1.34 × 6.42 × 10^2s", but that doesn't make sense. Oh, maybe the correct option is 1.34 multiplied by 642 seconds.

Wait, the options are given as:

Options:

A:8.62e2 s

B:2e8 s

C:6.42e2 s

D:5.67e2 s

E:7.84e2 s

F:12.84e2 s

G:4.81e2 s

H:1.34 ×6.42e2 s → Wait, that seems incorrect. Oh wait, perhaps it's H: 1.34 × 6.42 ×1e2 → but that's not correct syntax. Alternatively, perhaps H is 1.34e2 × 6.42e2, but that would be a much bigger number, but the options don't have that.

Looking again, the options are:

H is written as "1.34 × 6.42 × 10^2s". Oh wait no, that's not correct. Oh wait, the user wrote the option as H: 1.34 × 6.42 × 10^2s. Wait, that's not a proper number. Wait, perhaps the correct option is 1.34 times 642 s, which is approximately 859.28 s. Looking at the options, option A is 8.62e2 s → which is 862 s. Hmm, that's close but a bit less than 859.28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck.

v = 2e8 m/s, c = 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

v²/c² = (4/9) ≈ 0.4444

1 - v²/c² = 5/9 ≈ 0.5556

sqrt(5/9) = sqrt(0.5556) ≈ 0.745.

Gamma = 1/0.745 ≈ 1.343 approx. Let me calculate 1/0.745 more accurately.

0.745 ×1.343 = 1? Let me compute 1.343 * 0.745.

Well, 1.343 * 0.7 = 0.9401, 1.343 * 0.04 = 0.05373, 1.343 * 0.005=0.006715. Adding these together: 0.9401 + 0.05373 = 0.99383; plus 0.006715 is 0.9995. So about 1. So gamma is 1/0.745 = approximately 1.343.

So gamma is approximately 1.343.

So the observed time is t = gamma * t₀ = 1.343 * 642 s.

Let me compute that more accurately.

1.343 × 642:

Breaking it down:

642 × 1 = 642
642 × 0.3 = 192.6
642 × 0.04 = 25.68
642 × 0.003 = 1.926

Adding all together:

642 + 192.6 = 834.6

834.6 + 25.68 = 859.28

859.28 + 1.926 = 861.206 s.

So approx 861.2 s, about 8.61e2 s.

Looking at the options: Option A is 8.62e2 s, which is 862 s. Close enough.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the lifetime of a neutron as measured by an observer in a spacecraft moving at a speed of \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) relative to the Earth, we use the concept of time dilation from special relativity. The formula for time dilation is:

\[
t = \gamma t_0
\]

where:
- \( t_0 \) is the proper time (the lifetime measured in the Earth's frame, \( t_0 = 6.42 \times 10^2 \, \text{s} \)),
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of light \( c \) is \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{2 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667
\]

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \approx 0.4444
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.5556} \approx 0.745
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.745} \approx 1.343
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the observed time \( t \)
The observed time \( t \) is given by:

\[
t = \gamma t_0 = 1.343 \times 642 \, \text{s}
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
1.343 \times 642 = 861.2 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated observed time is approximately \( 861.2 \, \text{s} \), which corresponds to \( 8.62 \times 10^2 \, \text{s} \). Comparing this with the options:

- **A: \( 8.62 \times 10^2 \, \text{s} \)** matches the calculated value.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**A: \( 8.62 \times 10^2 \, \text{s} \)**
