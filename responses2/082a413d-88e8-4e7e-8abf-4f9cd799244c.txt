Okay, I need to figure out which expression in the nextIntInRange method will always return a value that satisfies the postcondition. The method is supposed to return a random integer between low and high, inclusive. So the return value has to be an integer that is >= low and <= high.

Let me look at the options one by one. Each option uses Math.random(), which returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Then it's multiplied by some number and adds another value. The key here is to make sure that the result is within the desired range.

Starting with option A: (int)(Math.random() * (high +1 - low)) + low. Let's think about the range. The multiplier is high+1-low, which is the number of possible values. For example, if low is 1 and high is 5, high+1-low is 5. So 5*0.5 is 2.5, which when cast to int is 2, then added to 1 gives 3. But wait, the maximum value would be (high+1 - low -1)*Math.random() + low. Wait, no, the expression is (high+1 - low) * Math.random() which can go up to (high+1 - low) -1, so when cast to int, it's between 0 and high+1-low -1. Adding low would make the maximum value low + (high+1 - low -1) = high -1 + low? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's take a concrete example. Let's say low is 1, high is 5. So high+1 - low is 5. So Math.random() *5 can be up to just under 5. So when we cast to int, it's 0 to 4. Adding low (1) gives 1 to 5. Which is correct. So for low=1, high=5, A is correct.

Option B: (int)(Math.random()*(high + low)) + low. Let's take the same example. High 5, low 1. So high+low is 6. So the multiplier is 6. Math.random() can be up to 1, but in this case, the maximum is 6*(1) -1 (since it's (high+low)*Math.random() which gives a value less than high+low). So the maximum is 6 -1=5, adding 1 gives 6. But the maximum allowed is 5. So this can return 6, which is wrong. So B is not correct.

Option C: (int)(Math.random() * (high - low +1)) + low. Let's see. High is 5, low is 1: high - low +1 is 5. So the multiplier is 5. So the maximum is 5*1 (since Math.random() can be up to 1) minus 1, so 5 -1=4. Adding low (1) gives 5, which is correct. What about the minimum? When random is 0, it's 0 +1=1. So yes, it's within 1 to 5.

Option D: (int)(Math.random() * (high - low +1)) + high. Let's test with the same example. High - low +1 is 5. So the multiplier is 5. Maximum value is 5*1=5. So adding high (5) would give 5+5=10, which is way over. So D is incorrect.

Option E: (int)(Math.random() * high) + low. So for low 1, high 5. Max random is just under 5. 5*0.9 is 4.5, so (int) is 4, added to 1 is 5. That's correct. But the minimum: when random is 0, 0*5=0. So 0+1=1. So in this case, the maximum is 5. But wait, let's take low as 2, high as 5. Max is 5*0.999=4.995, so added to 2 is 6, which is over the high of 5. So E is incorrect.

Option F: (int)(Math.random() *(high - low)) + high. Let's test with low=1, high=5. high - low is 4. So the multiplier is 4. So maximum is 4*1=4, added to high (5) gives 9. Which is way over. So F is incorrect.

Option G: (int)(Math.random() * (high - low -1)) + low. With high=5, low=1: high-low-1=3. So multiplier is 3. So random *3 could go up to 3*1=3, added to 1 gives 4. But wait, the maximum allowed is 5. So for example, if random is 1, 3*1=3, +1=4. But when random is 0.999..., 3*0.999=2.997, which is 2, plus 1 is 3. So the maximum possible is 4, which is below 5. So G is wrong.

Option H: (int)(Math.random() * (high + low -1)) + low. For low=1, high=5: high+low-1=5. So multiplier 5. So same as C, which is correct. Let me test: random can be 0.999, 5*0.999=4.995, integer 4, plus 1 is 5. Yes, correct.

Option I: (int)(Math.random() * (high + low +1)) + low. For low=1, high=5: high+low+1=7. So 7 * 0.999=6.993, which becomes 6, added to 1 gives 7. But high is 5. So that's over. So I is wrong.

Option J: (int)(Math.random()*(high - low)) + low. Which is the same as F but with high - low, so same problem.

So the correct options are C and H. But wait, the question says "which will always return a value that satisfies the postcondition". So both C and H are correct? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check again. For C: high - low +1 is the number of possible values. For example, low=1, high=5: 5 numbers. So the multiplier should be (high - low +1). So the correct multiplier is the number of possible values.

So for C, high-low+1 is 5. So the expression is correct. So for any low and high, the multiplier is (high - low +1).

Option C is correct. What about H: (high + low -1) * Math.random() + low. So high + low -1 would be 5+1-1=5, same as C. So H is also correct. So both C and H are correct expressions.

Wait, but the question is asking for which expression is correct. So looking at the options, both C and H are correct.

But the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, and the correct choice is supposed to be one. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating H. Let's think: high - low +1 is the number of values. So the maximum value would be (high - low +1 -1) * 1 + low = high. So H is correct.

So both C and H are correct, but looking at the options, the choices are separate. So perhaps the question is looking for only one correct option, but perhaps options C and H are both correct.

Wait, but the initial setup is that the question asks which expression will always return a value that satisfies the postcondition. So which of the options is correct.

Looking back, the correct way to generate a random number between low and high inclusive is to take (high - low + 1) as the multiplier, so that when multiplied by a random number (0 to 1), the result is between 0 and (high - low +1 -1) (since it's a < b *1). Then add low. So for example, in C, the multiplier is high - low +1, which is correct.

Similarly, H uses the same multiplier, so both C and H are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is an option and H is another. But in the given options, option C is present, and H is also present.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

C: (int)(Math.random() * (high - low +1)) + low;

H: (int)(Math.random() * (high + low - 1)) + low;

Wait, no, H is (high + low -1) as the multiplier, which is the same as (high - low +1). Because high + low -1 equals (high - low +1). So both C and H are correct.

But looking back at the options, perhaps both are correct, but the question expects only one correct option. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is not correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's take an example where low=1, high=5.

Option C: high - low +1 = 5. So Math.random() *5, which is 0 to 5 (exclusive). So (int) of that is 0 to 4, add 1 gives 1-5. Correct.

Option H: high + low -1 =5. So same as C. So both C and H are correct.

But in the options, the correct expressions are C and H. Wait, but looking again, the options are:

Looking at the given options, I see:

C: (int)(Math.random() * (high - low +1)) + low;

H: (int)(Math.random() * (high + low - 1)) + low;

Wait, wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: high - low +1.

Option H: high + low -1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because high - low +1 is the number of possible integers. So the multiplier should be high - low +1, not high + low -1. Wait, no, high + low -1 is the same as high - low +1 because high + low -1 = (high - low) +1. For example, high=5, low=1: 5+1-1=5, which is same as 5-1+1=5. So H is using high + low -1, which equals high - low +1. So H is correct.

So both C and H are correct expressions. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but the question expects to select one. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, but looking back, the initial options are provided as A to H. So in the given problem, the correct option is either C or H.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me reevaluate.

The correct way to generate a uniformly random integer between low and high (inclusive) is to calculate the range as (high - low + 1), then multiply the random number by that, add low, and cast to int.

So for example, if low is 10 and high is 20, the range is 11 numbers. So the multiplier is 11. So the expression should be (int)(Math.random() * 11) + 10.

So in the options, the expression that uses high - low +1 is option C.

But wait, in option H, the multiplier is high + low -1, which is also equal to high - low +1. So H is the same as C.

So both C and H are correct.

But the options are separate, so perhaps both are correct, but the question expects one option. Or perhaps the question is expecting only one correct option, but both C and H are correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are A to J, and the correct answer is option C and H, but since the options are single-select, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm confusing the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. The correct expressions are those where the multiplier is the number of possible values, which is high - low +1. So in the options, both C and H are correct because high - low +1 equals high + low -1.

Wait, wait, no: high - low +1 is the same as (high + low -1) when high and low are swapped. Wait, that's not correct. For example, high=5, low=1: high+low-1=5+1-1=5. high-low+1=5-1+1=5. So in this case, they are the same. But what if low=3, high=7? high + low -1=3+7-1=9. high - low +1=7-3+1=5. So in that case, high+low-1 is 9, which is more than 5. So in that case, H would be calculating 9, which is incorrect.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, high - low +1 is the number of possible values. So for example, low=3, high=7: 3,4,5,6,7 → 5 numbers. So high - low +1 is 5. H's multiplier is high + low -1 = 3+7-1=9. So 9 * Math.random() * could be up to 8.999, which is 8 when cast to int. So adding 3 gives 11, which is beyond the allowed range. So H is incorrect in that case.

Wait, but earlier I thought that H's multiplier is the same as C's, but that's only when high - low +1 equals high + low -1. Which is only true when high - low +1 = high + low -1 → which implies that 1 = 2low - 2 → 2low =3 → low=1.5, which is not possible since low is integer. So in general, H's multiplier is high + low -1, which is different from high - low +1.

So I made a mistake earlier. So H is not the same as C.

So which is correct? Let's see.

So the correct multiplier is (high - low +1). So for option C, it is correct. For option H, it's (high + low -1), which is not the same as high - low +1.

Wait, wait. Let's calculate for low=3, high=7. high - low +1=5, so correct. H's multiplier is 3+7-1=9. So 9 * Math.random() could be up to 8.999, which when cast to int is 8. Adding 3 gives 11, which is beyond the allowed range. So H is not correct.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that high + low -1 equals high - low +1, which is not correct in general. So H is incorrect.

So the correct expressions are options C and maybe others. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me re-examine the options again.

Option C: high - low +1 is the correct multiplier.

Option H: high + low -1 is not the same as high - low +1. So H's multiplier is higher than it should be, leading to incorrect results.

So the correct expression is option C.

But wait, let me think about another example. Let's take low=2, high=5. high - low +1=4. So the multiplier should be 4. So the expression (int)(Math.random() *4) +2. Let's see if it works.

Math.random() can be up to 0.999. 0.999*4=3.996 → int is 3. 3+2=5. Correct.

If random is 0.6, 0.6*4=2.4 → int 2. 2+2=4. Correct.

But if random is 0.5, 0.5*4=2.0 → 2+2=4. Correct.

If random is 0.7, 0.7*4=2.8 → 2+2=4. Correct.

If random is 0.999, 3.996 →3+2=5. Correct.

So option C works correctly.

Option H, for low=2, high=5: high + low -1=2+5-1=6. So 6 * random → up to 5.994, which when cast to int is 5, then +2 is 7. Which is beyond the allowed range. So H is incorrect.

So the correct option is C.

Looking back at the options, I think the correct answer is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that H's multiplier is same as C's, but now I see that's not the case. So the correct answer is C.

The correct expression is option C.

**Answer: C**

The expression in option C uses the correct multiplier of `high - low + 1`, ensuring that the generated random value falls within the desired range [low, high]. Other options either use an incorrect multiplier or do not always stay within the specified range.
