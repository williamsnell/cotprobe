Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding out how much oxygen in grams would contain the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water. Hmm, that sounds like a mole conversion problem.

Wait, right. Molecules are way too small to count directly. So I think I should convert grams to moles using the molar mass. Then, since O2 and H2O are diatomic molecules, I can figure out the number of moles, and then convert that to grams of O2.

First, let's find the molar mass of water. H2O has 2 hydrogens and one oxygen. Hydrogen's atomic weight is about 1.008 g/mol, so 2 times that is 2.016 g/mol. Oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. Adding them up, 2.016 + 16 = 18.016 g/mol. So roughly 18 g/mol for H2O.

The problem says 36.0 grams of H2O. To find the number of moles, I divide grams by molar mass. So 36.0 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 1.999 mol. Oh wait, that's almost 2 moles. So about 2 moles of H2O.

Now, since each H2O molecule has one O atom, the number of O atoms should be the same as H2O molecules. So the number of O2 molecules would be half, since each O2 molecule has two O atoms. Wait, no. Wait, O2 is one molecule containing two O atoms. So each H2O has one O atom, so the O atoms and O2 molecules are the same number. Because for each H2O, you get one O atom, and each O2 has two O atoms. So the number of O2 molecules would be half the number of H2O molecules. Or wait, let me think. Let's see: 1 mole of H2O has 1 mole of O atoms. Each O2 has two O atoms, so the number of O2 molecules is (moles of H2O) / 2.

So for 2 moles of H2O, the moles of O2 would be 2 / 2 = 1 mole.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. For each mole of H2O, there are 2 moles of H atoms and 1 mole of O. Each O2 molecule has two O atoms. So the number of O2 molecules is (number of O atoms) / 2.

Number of O atoms in H2O is 1 per H2O. So if I have n moles of H2O, I have n moles of O atoms. So O2 would be n / 2 moles.

So in this case, 2 moles of H2O → 1 mole of O2.

So the number of molecules of O2 is the same as the number of H2O molecules. Wait, no. Wait, H2O molecules are 2 moles, O2 molecules would be 1 mole. So that's a 2:1 ratio.

Wait, no. Because for every O2 molecule, you have two O atoms. So the number of O2 molecules is equal to the number of O atoms divided by two. So if there are 2 moles of O atoms (from 2 moles H2O), then the O2 is 1 mole.

So the number of O2 molecules is about 1 mole.

So the question is, how much O2 in grams would contain the same number of molecules as 36.0 g of H2O. So the number of O2 molecules is 1 mole.

So I need to find the mass of 1 mole of O2. O2's molar mass is 32.00 g/mol. So 1 mole O2 is 32 grams.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Let me think again.

Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol. So 1 mole O2 is 32 grams. So 32 grams of O2 would have 6.022e23 molecules, same as 2 moles of H2O (since 36g is 2 moles, each H2O has 1 O). So the number of O2 molecules is 1 mole, which is 32 grams.

Looking at the options, option H is 18 grams, F is 24, G is 18, I is 8, J is 72. Wait, wait, I thought it was 32 grams. But wait, the options don't have 32. Let me look again. Options are A to J.

Wait, the options are:

A:32.0 grams

B:48.0

C:36.0

D:16.0

E:8.0

F:24.0

G:18.0

H:64.0

I:8.0

J:72.0

So none of them is 32.0 grams. So wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the number of moles wrong. Let me redo the steps.

36.0 grams of H2O. Molar mass is approximately 18.015 g/mol. So moles = 36 / 18.015 ≈ 1.999, which is approximately 2.0 moles.

So moles of H2O is 2.0.

Each H2O has one O atom, so moles of O atoms = 2.0.

Each O2 molecule has two O atoms, so moles of O2 = moles of O atoms / 2 = 2.0 / 2 = 1.0 mole.

So 1.0 mole of O2 is 32.00 g. Because O2's molar mass is 32.00 g/mol.

So the answer should be 32 grams of O2. But looking at the options, option A is 32.0 grams. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait! Let me think again. Because sometimes when you have molecules, the number of molecules would be same if the moles are same. But in this case, H2O and O2 have different moles. So the number of O2 molecules is half that of H2O.

Wait, no. Wait, each H2O has one O. So O atoms are 2 per H2O. So the number of O2 molecules is (number of O atoms)/2 = 2n / 2 = n. So for 2 moles of H2O, the O2 is 1 mole.

Alternatively, the number of O2 molecules is same as number of H2O molecules. Wait, H2O and O2 are diatomic, so each has two atoms. The number of molecules would be equal only when the number of atoms is the same. So for each O2 molecule, you have two O atoms. For each H2O molecule, you have one O atom.

So if I have n H2O molecules, that's n O atoms. So to get the same number of O2 molecules, the number of O2 molecules is n/2.

Wait, no. Because each O2 molecule requires two O atoms. So the number of O2 molecules is equal to the number of O atoms divided by 2.

So for n H2O, number of O atoms is n. So number of O2 is n /2.

So in this case, n is 2 moles.

Number of O2 = 2 / 2 = 1 mole.

1 mole O2 is 32 g.

Looking at options, option A is 32.0 grams.

But wait, the options have A as 32.0 grams. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let me recalculate the molar masses.

Molar mass of H2O: 2*(1.008) + 16.00 = 2.016 +16.00 =18.016 g/mol.

36.0 grams /18.016 = approx 1.999 moles → 2 moles.

Number of O atoms: 2 moles * 1 O atom per H2O → 2 moles O.

Each O2 molecule has two O atoms. So number of O2 molecules = 2 / 2 = 1 mole.

Molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol. So 1 mole O2 is 32 grams.

So the correct answer is 32 grams, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 64.0 grams. Oh, wait a minute! Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 36g of H2O is 2 moles. So O2 is 1 mole, 32 grams. So the correct answer should be 32g, option A.

Wait, but wait—did I miscalculate the number of O2 molecules? Another approach: find how many O2 molecules are equivalent to 36g H2O.

Since H2O has 1 O per molecule, number of O2 molecules is same as H2O molecules.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each O2 molecule has two O atoms. So the number of O2 molecules is half the number of O atoms.

H2O has 2 * moles = 2 moles of O atoms. So O2 is 2 /2 =1 mole. So same as before.

So 1 mole O2 is 32g. So option A is correct.

But wait, another thought. Let me compute it using moles and then grams.

Moles of H2O = 36 / 18.016 ≈ 1.999 → 2 moles.

Molar ratio is 1 H2O per 0.5 O2. So 2 moles H2O → 1 mole O2.

Molar mass O2: 32.00 g/mol → 32 grams.

So correct answer is 32 grams. So option A.

To determine how many grams of oxygen (O₂) contain the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water (H₂O), we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the molar mass of H₂O**:  
   H₂O consists of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.  
   - Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol  
   - Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol  
   - Molar mass of H₂O = \(2 \times 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 \, \text{g/mol}\).

2. **Convert grams of H₂O to moles**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{\text{Mass of H₂O}}{\text{Molar mass of H₂O}} = \frac{36.0}{18.016} \approx 1.999 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  
   Since 18.016 g/mol is approximately 18.02 g/mol, this simplifies to approximately 2 moles of H₂O.

3. **Determine the number of molecules of O₂**:  
   Each molecule of H₂O contains 1 oxygen atom, and each molecule of O₂ contains 2 oxygen atoms.  
   - Number of oxygen atoms in 2 moles of H₂O = \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{moles of O}\).  
   - Number of O₂ molecules = \(\frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{moles of O₂}\).

4. **Convert moles of O₂ to grams**:  
   - Molar mass of O₂ = \(2 \times 16.00 = 32.00 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   - Mass of 2 moles of O₂ = \(2 \times 32.00 = 64.00 \, \text{grams}\).

However, the question asks for the number of molecules of O₂ that contains the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of H₂O. Since the number of molecules of H₂O is 2 moles, the number of O₂ molecules is also 2 moles. Each mole of O₂ weighs 32.00 g, so 2 moles of O₂ weigh \(2 \times 32.00 = 64.00 \, \text{grams}\).

5. **Match the answer to the options**:  
   The correct answer is **64.0 grams**, which corresponds to option **H**.
