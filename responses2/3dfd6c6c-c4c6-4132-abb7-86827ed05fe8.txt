Okay, so I've got this problem here about daps, yaps, and baps. It's a bit confusing at first glance, but I think I can figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: If 4 daps equal 7 yaps, and 5 yaps equal 3 baps, how many daps equal 42 baps? The options are A through J.

Hmm, so I have two conversion factors here. Let me jot them down:

1. 4 daps = 7 yaps
2. 5 yaps = 3 baps

I need to find out how many daps are equivalent to 42 baps. So, the plan is to convert baps to yaps first and then convert yaps to daps.

Let's start with the second conversion because the first one gives daps in terms of yaps, and the second gives yaps in terms of baps. So, I need to go from baps to yaps first.

The second equation is 5 yaps = 3 baps. So, if I have 1 bap, how many yaps is that? Let me calculate that.

If 5 yaps = 3 baps, then 1 bap = 5/3 yaps. Wait, no, because 5 yaps equal 3 baps, so to find out how many yaps are in 1 bap, I should invert the ratio. So, 1 bap = (5/3) yaps? Or wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. If 5 yaps = 3 baps, then 1 bap is (5/3) yaps? Wait, that would mean 3 baps equal 5 yaps, so 1 bap equals 5/3 yaps. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 baps would be 5 yaps, so 1 bap is (5/3) yaps? Wait, no, if 5 yaps = 3 baps, then 1 bap is (5/3) yaps. Wait, that's correct because 3 baps would be 5 yaps, so each bap is 5/3 yaps. Let me write that correctly.

So, 1 bap = (5/3) yaps. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If 5 yaps = 3 baps, then 1 bap is 5/3 yaps? Because 3 baps =5 yaps → 1 bap=5/3 yaps. Wait, no, that would mean 3 baps is 5 yaps, so 1 bap is 5/3 yaps. Wait, that can't be right because substituting 3 baps (which would be 5 yaps) I'm getting each bap as 5/3 yaps. Wait, no, that's correct. So, 3 baps =5 yaps → 1 bap=5/3 yaps.

Wait, but if I have 42 baps, then the number of yaps is 42 * (5/3) yaps. Let me compute that.

42 baps * (5 yaps / 3 baps) = (42 * 5) / 3 yaps. 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 14 *5=70 yaps. So 42 baps equal 70 yaps.

Wait, that seems high, but let's check. 5 yaps =3 baps, so 1 bap is (5/3) yaps, yes. So 42 * (5/3) = (42/3)*5=14*5=70 yaps. Yep.

Now, I need to convert 70 yaps into daps. The first conversion is 4 daps =7 yaps. So, how many daps per yap? Let me see.

4 daps =7 yaps → 1 yap = 4/7 daps.

So, 70 yaps * (4 daps /7 yaps) = (70 *4)/7 daps.

70 divided by7 is 10, so 10 *4=40 daps.

So, 70 yaps equal 40 daps.

Wait, so 42 baps equal 70 yaps, which equal 40 daps. So the answer is 40 daps, which is option B.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the conversion factors.

Another way: Let's find the conversion from baps to daps directly.

We have 4 daps =7 yaps → 1 dap =7/4 yaps.

And 5 yaps =3 baps → 1 bap =5/3 yaps.

So, to find how many daps equal 42 baps, we can convert baps to yaps first, then yaps to daps.

42 baps * (5 yaps /3 baps) = (42 *5)/3 yaps =70 yaps.

Then, 70 yaps * (4 daps /7 yaps) = (70*4)/7 daps = (40) daps.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is B:40.

To solve the problem, we'll convert baps to yaps and then to daps using the given conversion factors.

1. **Convert baps to yaps**:  
   Given that 5 yaps = 3 baps, we find that 1 bap = 5/3 yaps.  
   Therefore, 42 baps = 42 * (5/3) yaps = 70 yaps.

2. **Convert yaps to daps**:  
   Given that 4 daps = 7 yaps, we find that 1 dap = 7/4 yaps.  
   Therefore, 70 yaps = 70 * (4/7) daps = 40 daps.

The final answer is **40 daps**, which corresponds to option B.
