Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about guinea pigs and coat color. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. The coat color is determined by a dominant/recessive system: black is dominant, white is recessive. The offspring showed that three-quarters have black coats and one quarter have white. They're asking about the genotypes of the parents, with options A through J.

Alright, so first, let's break down the information. The parents both have black coats. So, both parents must have at least one B (dominant) allele. Because if they were bb, they'd have white coats. So the possible genotypes for each parent are either Bb or BB.

Now, the ratio of offspring is 3:1 for black to white. Hmm, that's a 3:1 ratio, which typically comes from a dihybrid cross or a test cross. Wait, but let's think about what that implies. 3/4 black, 1/4 white suggests that the parents must be heterozygous for the coat color gene. Because if they're homozygous (like BB), all offspring would be BB, which would be black. But here, some are white, so the parents can't be BB.

Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the F1 generation would be B (from BB) and Bb (from Bb parent). So the F1 would be 25% BB and 50% Bb. Then, when they mate, the F2 would have a 3:1 ratio. Because the F1 would self-mate, and each Bb parent would produce 50% B and 50% b. So when they're crossed, the F2 would get from each parent 50% B and 50% b. Let's calculate the possible genotypes and phenotypes.

Wait, the question says the parents are both black. So the possible parent genotypes are Bb or BB.

But if one parent is BB, then the other can't be BB (since they both have black, so if parents are BB, all offspring would be BB, which gives 100% black. But here, the ratio is 75% black and 25% white. So parents can't be BB and BB. So the parents must be heterozygous. So both are Bb.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. If both parents are Bb, then what's the F1? They would each have a 50% chance of passing B or b. So the F1 would be 25% (BB), 50% (Bb), 25% (bb). Then, if they mate, the F2 would be the cross of BB and Bb.

Wait, no. Wait, F1 from Bb × Bb is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Then, when F1 individuals are crossed, each parent's gamete distribution is 50% B and 50% b. So when you cross Bb (which is a Bb) with another Bb, the F2 would be:

Each parent contributes either B or b.

So for each gene, the possible combinations are:

B + B → BB (black)
B + b → Bb (black)
b + B → Bb (black)
b + b → bb (white)

So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (black:white), which matches the question. So if the parents are Bb × Bb, the F2 would have 3/4 B and 1/4 b.

So the parents are Bb each.

Looking at the options, option G is Bb × Bb. Option B is BB × BB and Bb × bb. Wait, no, let me check all the options.

The options are:

A: Bb × Bb

B: BB × BB and Bb × bb

C: bb × Bb

D: bb × bb

E: bb × BB

F: Bb × bb

G: Bb × Bb

H: BB × Bb

I: BB × bb

J: BB × BB

So the correct parents must be Bb × Bb. So option G is the correct answer.

The question involves determining the genotypes of parents who crossed to produce offspring with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (black:white = 3:1), given that both parents have black coats. The coat color is determined by a dominant/recessive system, where black is dominant and white is recessive. 

1. **Key Observations**:  
   - Both parents have black coats, so they must be either homozygous dominant (Bb) or heterozygous (Bb). If they were homozygous dominant (BB), all offspring would be black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  
   - The 3:1 ratio suggests a dihybrid cross or a test cross, where one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). However, the question specifies that both parents have black coats, so neither parent can be homozygous recessive (bb).  

2. **Genotypes of the Parents**:  
   - If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), their offspring would follow a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. This is because the F1 generation would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. The phenotypes would then be black (for BB and Bb) and white (for bb).  

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (Bb × Bb)**: Correct. This matches the 3:1 ratio and the requirement that both parents are black.  
   - **Option B (BB × BB and Bb × bb)**: Incorrect. If one parent were BB, all offspring would be black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  
   - **Option C (bb × Bb)**: Incorrect. If one parent were bb, all offspring would be black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  
   - **Option D (bb × bb)**: Incorrect. Both parents being bb would result in all offspring being black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  
   - **Option E (bb × BB)**: Incorrect. If one parent were bb, all offspring would be black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  
   - **Option F (Bb × bb)**: Incorrect. If one parent were Bb and the other bb, all offspring would be Bb (black), contradicting the 3:1 ratio.  
   - **Option G (Bb × Bb)**: Correct. This matches the 3:1 ratio and the requirement that both parents are black.  
   - **Option H (BB × Bb)**: Incorrect. If one parent were BB, all offspring would be black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  
   - **Option I (BB × bb)**: Incorrect. If one parent were BB, all offspring would be black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  
   - **Option J (BB × BB)**: Incorrect. If both parents were BB, all offspring would be black, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The only option that satisfies the 3:1 phenotypic ratio and the requirement that both parents have black coats is **Option G (Bb × Bb)**.
