Alright, let's see. I've got this question here about calculating a tax rate for a town. So, let's break it down. The town needs $465,000 to meet its financial obligations for the year. The assessed valuation of the property is $10,000,000. Hmm, okay, so I think I need to figure out the tax rate that would result in the town getting a revenue (or tax) of $465,000 from this assessed value.

Wait, I remember that tax rates are usually calculated by dividing the tax amount by the assessed value. So the formula would be tax rate = (tax amount / assessed value) * 100. Let me plug in the numbers here.

The tax amount is $465,000, and the assessed value is $10,000,000. So that's 465,000 divided by 10,000,000. Let me compute that. 

Let me do the division: 465,000 divided by 10,000,000. That's the same as 465 divided by 100,000, which is 0.00465. Then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage gives me 0.465%. Wait, but wait, that's a very low rate. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, 465,000 over 10 million. Let me compute 10 million is 10,000,000. So 10 million is 10^7. 465,000 is 4.65 x 10^5. So 4.65e5 / 1e7 = 0.0465. Oh, wait, that's 0.0465, which is 4.65%. Wait, but that's higher than what I thought earlier.

Wait, no—because 465,000 divided by 10,000,000 is 465,000 ÷ 10,000,000 = 0.0465, which is 4.65%. So that would mean the tax rate is 4.65%. Looking at the options, option G is 6.65%, option H is 4.65%. So that's option H.

Wait, did I get confused with the division? Let me make sure. 10,000,000 is 10 million. So 10 million goes into 465,000 how many times? Let me think in terms of numbers. 10 million is 10,000,000. So 465,000 is less than that. So 465,000 divided by 10,000,000. Let's think about it as 465 divided by 100,000 (because 465,000 is 465 * 1000, and 10,000,000 is 10,000 * 1000, so the thousands cancel out). So 465 / 100,000 = 0.00465, which is 0.465%, which is 0.465. So that's 4.65% when multiplied by 100. 

So the tax rate should be 4.65%. Looking back at the options, option H says 4.65%.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe it was higher, but no, the calculation seems correct. Let me double-check. 10 million divided by 10,000,000 is 1, so 465,000 is 46.5% of 10 million. Wait, no, 465,000 is 4.65% of 10 million. Oh wait! No, wait. Wait, 465,000 divided by 10,000,000 is 0.0465, which is 4.65%. That's correct. So the tax rate should be 4.65%, which is option H.

The tax rate is calculated by dividing the assessed valuation by the required revenue and converting it to a percentage. 

**Calculation:**  
Tax rate = (465,000 / 10,000,000) * 100 = 4.65%.

**Answer:**  
Option H: 4.65%
