Question:

Two friends were members of a fraternity at their college. During homecoming weekend, the fraternity held a big party, which was widely attended by students and alumni. At the party, the two friends were horsing around when the first friend pulled out a revolver. He gave the revolver's cylinder a spin, put the barrel of the gun to the second friend's head and, intending to scare the second friend, said, "Hey, man, let's play Russian roulette. " The second friend, who had consumed a fifth of bourbon, was very intoxicated. Thinking that the gun was unloaded, the second friend responded, "Sure, dude. " The first friend then pulled the trigger. The gun just made a clicking sound as the hammer fell on an empty chamber of the cylinder. The two friends both laughed and continued partying. Unbeknownst to the second friend, the first friend had placed bullets in two of the revolver's six firing chambers before making his challenge. The next day, the second friend found out that the gun was, in fact, loaded when the first friend pulled the trigger. If the second friend asserts a tort action against the first friend, he will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the first friend intended to place the second friend in apprehension.
B: prevail, because the first friend showed gross negligence.
C: not prevail, because there was no physical harm inflicted on the second friend.
D: prevail, because the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous.
E: prevail, because there was a substantial certainty that the second friend would be placed in apprehension.
F: not prevail, because the second friend was unaware that the gun was loaded.
G: not prevail, because the first friend did not actually intend to harm the second friend.
H: not prevail, because the second friend consented to participate in the Russian roulette game.
I: not prevail, because the second friend was under the influence of alcohol.

Okay, let's try to figure out this tort question. So, the scenario is two friends in a fraternity where one friend pulls out a revolver and shoots the other's head. The second friend was drunk and assumed the gun wasn't loaded, but the first friend actually loaded two chambers before the challenge. The second friend found out the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger. The question is, if the second friend sues the first, what's the outcome? 

First, I need to understand the legal principles involved. This seems like a tort law problem, specifically about negligence and recklessness. The key here is whether the first friend acted in a way that was negligent or reckless.

So, the first friend placed two bullets in two of the six chambers before attempting to shoot. That's a definite act of recklessness because he didn't intend to shoot the second friend. He knew the gun wasn't loaded because he thought the other friend was safe. His actions were not in the knowledge of the gun being loaded. So, he's considered negligent because he didn't have any reasonable belief that the gun was loaded, and he acted recklessly by firing when he wasn't certain.

Another point is the physical harm. The gun was in a firing chamber, but the second friend was in an empty chamber. Wait, noâ€”the first friend pulled the trigger and the hammer fell on an empty chamber. Wait, but the gun was loaded because the first friend placed two bullets in two chambers. So, the gun was loaded when he shot. So, the second friend found the gun loaded. So, the second friend was in a chamber with a bullet, which likely means he was injured, but perhaps not necessarily killed. But the question is about the tort action.

Wait, but the problem says the second friend found the gun was loaded. So, the second friend was in a chamber where the gun was loaded. So, he was in a chamber with a bullet, which would mean he was injured. But the options are about whether he can sue for tort.

In tort law, an action against someone for the act of putting bullets in the gun is called negligence. But wait, the first friend is putting bullets in the firing chambers. That's putting bullets in the gun, not just firing once.

Wait, the standard tort law for putting a bullet into a gun is known as "intentional commission of a weapon." So, putting bullets in the gun is a negligent act because the person intended to commit the act with intent to cause harm. Here, the first friend intended to place two bullets in the gun, knowing that he would be shot, so he knew the gun wasn't loaded. So, he committed the act with a substantial risk of injury. 

But wait, in this case, the second friend was in a chamber, so the gun was loaded, but the first friend had already pulled the trigger, and the hammer fell into the chamber. So, the second friend was in a chamber with a bullet. So, he was injured. 

But wait, the second friend didn't die, he was in a chamber where a bullet was in the gun. So, did he suffer any injury? Yes. So, the second friend was in a position of medical danger.

So, the first friend's action was negligent. Because he knew the gun wasn't loaded, he didn't intend to shoot the second friend. So, the second friend suffered from a tortious act, making the first friend liable.

But wait, the question is about the tort action against the first friend. So, the second friend's actions are in tort, and the first is acting in a negligent manner, so the second is liable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Prevail because first intended to place second in apprehension. Hmm, but B says the first acted negligently, which fits.

Option B: Prevail because first acted negligently. That's correct.

Other options: C says there was no physical harm. No, because the second was in a chamber with a bullet. D says the first's actions were reckless and dangerous. No, the first was reckless because he knew the gun wasn't loaded. E says not prevail because second was under influence. No, he wasn't. F says second wasn't aware gun was loaded. Wait, the first friend didn't know the gun was loaded because he thought the other friend was safe. So, the second friend (the one who pulled the trigger) was in a chamber with a bullet, so he was aware that the gun was loaded. So, F is false.

Wait, no, the second friend was the one who pulled the trigger. The first friend had already pulled the trigger and the hammer fell into a chamber with a bullet. So, when the first friend pulled the trigger, the chamber was loaded. The second friend is the one who was in that chamber. So, the second friend was aware that the gun was loaded, because the first friend had already placed two bullets in the chamber.

Wait, but no. The scenario says the first friend placed two bullets, intending to scare the second friend. So, when the first friend attempted to pull the trigger, the hammer would hit an empty chamber, but since the gun was loaded, the second friend was in a chamber with a bullet.

So, the first friend was in a position of danger because he knew the gun wasn't loaded. He intended to shoot the second friend but didn't because he thought the gun was loaded. So, the first friend acted with a duty of care, which he failed.

So, the first friend's action was negligent. Therefore, the second friend is liable for tort, and the first is negligent. So, the first is liable, so the second can sue for negligence.

Looking back at the options, option B says prevail because the first friend showed gross negligence. That's correct.

Wait, but another point: the first friend didn't have a reasonable belief that the gun was loaded. Because he thought the other friend was safe, he knew the gun wasn't loaded. So, he didn't have a reasonable belief, which means he acted with gross negligence.

So, the correct answer is B.
</think>

The first friend acted with gross negligence because he knew the second friend was safe and intended to shoot the gun, but he lacked a reasonable belief that the gun was loaded. This negligence led to the second friend's injury in a position of medical danger. Therefore, the second friend can assert a tort action against the first friend for negligence.

**Answer: B**
