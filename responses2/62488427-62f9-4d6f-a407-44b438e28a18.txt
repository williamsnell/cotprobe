Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the necessary centripetal force for a car rounding a curve. Hmm. Let me think about what I know. 

The car's mass is given as 3200 pounds, right? Wait, but wait a second, mass is usually measured in slugs or kilograms, not pounds. Oh, wait, no, pounds can be a unit of force. Oh, right! Weight is a force, so 3200 pounds is actually the car's weight. So, the weight is 3200 lb, but I need to find the centripetal force, which is a force, so I should probably convert pounds to mass in slugs.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for centripetal force. Oh right! Centripetal force F = m * v² / r. But wait, if the given weight is 3200 lb, that's the force due to gravity, which is weight = m * g. So, m = weight / g. Oh, but I'm not sure about the value of g here. Wait, the question uses miles per hour, so I should probably convert the speed to feet per second because the radius is in feet.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the mass of the car in slugs. Since weight (W) = m * g, m = W / g. g is 32 ft/s² approximately.
2. Convert the given speed from miles per hour to feet per second.
3. Calculate the centripetal force using F = m * v² / r.

Wait, but wait—centripetal force can also be expressed in terms of weight if needed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the force in pounds-force, but I think the standard approach is to compute it correctly using SI units or consistent units.

Wait, let's get into the details.

First, the speed is 60 mi/hr. I need to convert that to feet per second.

I know that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds.

So, 60 mi/hr = 60 * 5280 ft / 3600 s.

Let me compute that. 60 * 5280 = 316,800. Divided by 3600: 316800 / 3600. Let's see: 3600 * 88 is 316,800 because 3600 * 80 = 288,000, and 80 *80 is 288,000. Wait, actually, 3600 * 88 = 3600*(80+8)= 3600*80=288,000 and 3600*8=28,800. So 288,000+28,800=316,800. Oh wait, wait, no! Oh wait, 60 *5280 = 316,800. 316,800 divided by 3600. Let's compute 316800 / 3600: dividing both numerator and denominator by 100: 3168 / 36. 36 *88 =3168, because 36*80=2880 and 36*8=288 → total 3168. So the speed is 88 ft/s.

Wait, does that make sense? 60 mph is about 88 ft/s. I think that's correct. I've heard that 1 mph is about 1.4667 ft/s, so 60 *1.4667= about 88. So yes.

So v = 88 ft/s.

Next, the radius is 484 ft.

Mass m = weight / g = 3200 lb / g. Wait, but wait—what's the unit of g here? Because in the formula F = m*v²/r, the units should all make sense. If I'm using pounds as force, then m would be in slugs, and F would be in pounds. But wait, if I use mass in slugs, then F is m*v²/r, which would be (slug)*(ft²/s²)/ft → slug*ft/s², which is lb. So that's correct.

But wait, let me think: if the weight is 3200 lb (force), then m = 3200 / g, where g is in ft/s². So g is approximately 32.174 ft/s². Let's take g = 32 ft/s² for simplicity.

So m = 3200 / 32 = 100 slugs.

Now, compute v²: (88 ft/s)^2 = 7744 (ft²/s²).

r =484 ft.

So F = m * v² / r → 100 *7744 /484.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 7744 ÷484. Let's see, 484*16=7744? Because 484 * 10 = 4840, 484*6=2904. 4840 +2904=7744. So 484 *16=7744. So 7744 /484=16.

So F = 100 *16 =1600 lb.

Wait—that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option J is 1600 lb.

So the necessary centripetal force is 1600 lb. So the answer should be J.

To find the necessary centripetal force for the car, we use the formula:

\[
F = \frac{m v^2}{r}
\]

where \(m\) is the mass, \(v\) is the velocity, and \(r\) is the radius of the curve. The given data is:

- Weight of the car: \(W = 3200 \, \text{lb}\) (force)
- Speed of the car: \(v = 60 \, \text{mi/hr}\)
- Radius of the curve: \(r = 484 \, \text{ft}\)

### Step 1: Convert the speed to feet per second
The conversion factor is \(1 \, \text{mi/hr} = \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{3600 \, \text{s}} = \frac{88}{10} \, \text{ft/s}\). Thus:

\[
v = 60 \, \text{mi/hr} = 60 \times \frac{88}{10} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of the car
The weight \(W\) is related to mass \(m\) by \(W = m \cdot g\), where \(g \approx 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\). Thus:

\[
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{3200}{32} = 100 \, \text{slugs}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the centripetal force
Substitute \(m = 100 \, \text{slug}\), \(v = 88 \, \text{ft/s}\), and \(r = 484 \, \text{ft}\) into the formula:

\[
F = \frac{m v^2}{r} = \frac{100 \cdot (88)^2}{484}
\]

First, calculate \(v^2\):

\[
v^2 = 88^2 = 7744 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Now, calculate the numerator and denominator:

\[
\text{Numerator} = 100 \cdot 7744 = 774400
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = 484
\]

Thus:

\[
F = \frac{774400}{484} = 1600 \, \text{lb}
\]

### Final Answer:
The necessary centripetal force is \(1600 \, \text{lb}\), which corresponds to option **J**.
