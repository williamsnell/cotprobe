Okay, so I've got this question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in Egypt who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months in 2015. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with Egyptian public data, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the question is specifically about children aged 13-15, so I'm assuming that's a specific age group. The year mentioned is 2015, so I should think about what data is available for that period. I'm not sure if the data is from a specific survey or a compilation of data from various sources. 

I recall that in many countries, including Egypt, there are reports on bullying among children. I think in some places, they use surveys or questionnaires to track such behavior. Maybe the data is from a national survey conducted around that time.

Now, the options given are 60%, 80%, 90%, 20%, 70%, 10%, etc. I'm trying to think of what plausible numbers fall into this context. I'm not sure if 80% or 90% is realistic because I've heard about issues related to bullying in Egypt. I think there was a significant increase in bullying incidents, but I'm not certain of the exact percentages.

Wait, another angle: the question is asking specifically about the percentage of children aged 13-15. So maybe the data is for that exact age group. I think in some studies, the percentage might be around 70-80%, but I'm not certain.

I also remember that in some regions, like Egypt, there's been a noticeable rise in bullying, especially among younger children. I think the percentage might have been in the mid to high 70s or 80s. So perhaps 70% is the answer.

Looking at the options, E is 70%, which seems plausible. Other options like 80% (B) might be too high. 60% (A) is lower but I'm not sure if that's the case. 90% (C) is very high; maybe that's too optimistic.

Wait, but I also recall that in some countries, like the UK, the percentage might be around 50-60%, but that's not relevant here. Egypt's situation is more specific, so perhaps the numbers are different.

Another thought: perhaps the percentage is around 50% or lower because it's a specific age group. But I'm not sure about that. I'm leaning towards 70% because it's a common percentage in some reports, especially if it's a higher age group.

So, considering all that, I'll go with E:70%.

The correct answer is E:70%. 

Answer:
     E: 70%
