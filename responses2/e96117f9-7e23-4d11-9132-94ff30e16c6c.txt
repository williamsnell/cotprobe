Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about magnetic flux through a coil. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: A circular coil of diameter 20 mm is mounted with the plane of the coil perpendicular to the direction of a uniform magnetic flux density of 100mT. Find the total flux threading the coil.

Wait, flux through a coil. I remember flux (Φ) is calculated using the formula Φ = B * A * cosθ, where B is the magnetic field, A is the area, and θ is the angle between the field and the normal to the surface.

So first, I need to figure out the area of the coil. The problem says the diameter is 20 mm. Since the coil is circular, the radius is half of that. So radius r = 10 mm, which is 0.01 meters (since 1 mm is 0.001 m, so 10 mm is 0.01 m).

The area A of a circle is πr². Plugging in the radius: A = π*(0.01)^2 = π * 0.0001 = 0.0001 * π m². Hmm, 0.0001 is 1e-4, so A is πe-4 m².

But wait, the magnetic flux formula uses the area perpendicular to the field. Oh, wait, the problem says the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the field direction. So θ is 0 degrees, because the normal to the coil is aligned with the field. So cosθ would be cos(0), which is 1. So Φ = B * A * 1.

The magnetic field strength B is given as 100mT. Wait, 100 millitesla is 100e-3 Tesla. So B = 100e-3 T.

Putting it all together: Φ = (100e-3 T) * (π * (0.01 m)^2) * 1.

Calculating that: (100e-3) * (π * 0.0001) = 100e-3 * π * 1e-4. Let's compute that.

Wait, 100e-3 is 1e-1. So 1e-1 * π * 1e-4 = π * 1e-5.

So Φ = π * 1e-5 T·m². Wait, Tesla is kg/(s²·A), but the units here might not be needed; the question asks for µWb. Since 1 Wb is 1 Tesla times 1 m², so 1 µWb is 1e-6 Wb.

So let's compute it step by step.

Φ = 100e-3 T * π * (0.01 m)^2.

Compute each part:

0.01 m squared is 0.0001 m².

So 100e-3 T * 0.0001 m² = 0.00001 T·m² (since 100e-3 is 0.01, times 0.0001 is 0.00001).

Wait, 100e-3 is 0.1, but wait no, 100mT is 0.1 T? Oh wait wait, 100mT is 0.1 T, right. Because 1 T is 1000 mT. So 100 mT is 0.1 T.

Ah, so B is 0.1 T, not 100e-3. Wait, 100e-3 is 0.1, so that's correct.

So the area is π * (0.01)^2 = π * 0.0001 = 0.0001π m².

Then Φ = B * A = 0.1 T * 0.0001π m² = 0.1 * 0.0001 * π T·m² = 0.00001 * π.

0.00001 is 1e-5, so Φ = π * 1e-5 = 1e-5 π Wb.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute this again:

Φ = B × A × cosθ.

B is 0.1 T.

A is π (0.01)^2 = π × 0.0001 = 0.0001π m².

cosθ is 1 because θ is 0 degrees.

So Φ = 0.1 T * 0.0001π m² = 0.1 * 0.0001 * π = 0.00001 * π.

0.00001 is 1e-5.

So Φ = 1e-5 * π Wb = 1e-5 π Wb.

Wait, 1e-5 π is about 3.1416e-5 Wb. But since the question asks for µWb, which is 1e-6 Wb, I need to convert this.

3.1416e-5 Wb is equal to 31.416e-6 Wb, which is 31.416 µWb.

Looking at the options:

A: 62.8 µWb (twice what I have)

B:50

C:40

D:25

E:31.4 µWb (matches my calculation)

So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I've made a mistake in calculation again. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.1 T * 0.0001 m² is 0.00001 T m². Multiply by π: 0.00001 * π ≈ 0.00031416 Weber.

Wait, but 0.00001 is 1e-5. 1e-5 * π is 3.1416e-5 Wb. Which is 31.416e-6 Wb, or 31.416 µWb. So option E is 31.4 µWb, which is correct.

So the answer should be E.

To determine the total magnetic flux threading the circular coil, we use the formula for magnetic flux:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos\theta
\]

### Step 1: Given parameters
- Diameter of the coil: \( 20 \, \text{mm} \)
- Radius: \( r = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \, \text{mm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \)
- Magnetic flux density: \( B = 100 \, \text{mT} = 0.1 \, \text{T} \)
- Angle: The plane of the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, so \( \theta = 0^\circ \), and \( \cos\theta = 1 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the coil
The area of a circular coil is given by:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

Substituting \( r = 0.01 \, \text{m} \):

\[
A = \pi (0.01)^2 = \pi \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0001\pi \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the magnetic flux
Using the formula for magnetic flux:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos\theta
\]

Substitute \( B = 0.1 \, \text{T} \), \( A = 0.0001\pi \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( \cos\theta = 1 \):

\[
\Phi = 0.1 \cdot 0.0001\pi = 0.00001\pi \, \text{Wb}
\]

### Step 4: Convert to microWb
Since \( 1 \, \text{Wb} = 10^6 \, \mu\text{Wb} \), we have:

\[
0.00001\pi \, \text{Wb} = 3.1416 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{Wb} = 31.416 \, \mu\text{Wb}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated flux is \( 31.4 \, \mu\text{Wb} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
