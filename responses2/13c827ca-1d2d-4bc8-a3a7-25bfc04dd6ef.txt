Okay, so I've got this math problem here about whether the space P[0,1] with a certain distance is complete. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that a complete space means every Cauchy sequence in that space converges to a limit that's also in the space. So the question is asking if P[0,1], with the metric defined by ρ(p, q) = ∫₀¹ |p(x) - q(x)| dx, is complete.

Wait, P[0,1] refers to the set of all polynomials on the interval [0,1]. So each polynomial is a function from [0,1] to real numbers. The distance ρ is the integral of the absolute difference between two polynomials over [0,1].

I think about whether this space is complete. I remember something about the Weierstrass M-test and how it relates to uniform convergence, which is key for completeness. But wait, the space of continuous functions on [0,1] is complete under the uniform norm, but here the metric is integral. Maybe that's different.

Wait, another thought: the space of polynomials is dense in the space of continuous functions on [0,1] under the uniform norm, thanks to the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. But here, we're using the integral metric. So does that density help with completeness? Or is the integral metric's completeness something different?

Wait another point: the integral of the absolute difference might not capture the same topology as the uniform norm. Because if two functions are close in the uniform norm (meaning their max difference is small), their integral of the absolute difference might still be small, but the converse isn't necessarily true. So maybe the integral metric is finer than the uniform one.

But wait, for completeness, I think the space needs to be closed in a complete metric space. Since the space of continuous functions on [0,1] is complete under the uniform norm, but here we're using a different metric. So perhaps P[0,1] is not complete under ρ.

Wait, wait. I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think about Cauchy sequences. Suppose we have a Cauchy sequence in P[0,1] with respect to ρ. Does this sequence converge to a polynomial in P[0,1]?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the limit of such a Cauchy sequence is a polynomial. If the limit is a continuous function, but not necessarily a polynomial, then the space wouldn't be complete under ρ.

Wait, but I remember that the integral metric ρ is related to the L¹ norm. Polynomials are in L¹, but perhaps not Cauchy in L¹. Wait, no, the integral of the absolute difference is the L¹ distance. But wait, P[0,1] is a subset of C[0,1], which is a subset of L¹[0,1]. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the space of continuous functions. Wait, the Cauchy sequence in P[0,1] with respect to ρ would mean that for any ε>0, there's a polynomial p_n such that ρ(p_n, p_m) < ε for all n,m beyond some index. So the integral of |p_n - p_m| is small.

But does this imply that p_n converges uniformly? Because if the integral is small, it suggests that the functions are getting uniformly close. Because if two functions are close in L¹, and they are polynomials, perhaps their uniform difference is bounded.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the density again. Since polynomials are dense in C[0,1] (by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem), any continuous function can be approximated by polynomials. But what about the Cauchy sequence in P[0,1] with respect to ρ?

Wait, perhaps if the integral of the difference is small, the functions are getting close in a way that would allow us to find a limit function. But the limit function might not be a polynomial, which would mean it's not in P[0,1], so the space isn't complete under ρ.

Alternatively, maybe the space is complete. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: maybe the integral metric makes P[0,1] complete because any Cauchy sequence in P[0,1] under ρ would converge to a continuous function (since the integral of differences is small, the functions are getting uniformly close), and since the space of continuous functions is complete under uniform norm, the limit would be continuous. But is that limit necessarily a polynomial? Probably not. So P[0,1] would not be complete under ρ.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because if the sequence converges uniformly, then it converges to a polynomial, so the limit is in P[0,1], making it complete. But if the limit is a continuous function that's not a polynomial, then the space isn't complete. So, does the integral metric ensure that the limit is a polynomial?

Hmm, I don't think so. Because if a sequence of polynomials converges uniformly on [0,1], the limit is a continuous function, but it's not necessarily a polynomial. For example, the limit could be a non-polynomial continuous function, such as e^x, which isn't a polynomial. So in that case, the space isn't complete under ρ.

Wait, but then why is the question phrased that way? Oh, wait a second, maybe the integral of the absolute difference is too small for the functions to converge uniformly. Let me think again. If a sequence of polynomials p_n converges uniformly to a function f on [0,1], then certainly the integral would approach zero. But the converse isn't necessarily true. So for a Cauchy sequence in P[0,1] under ρ, the limit might be a continuous function, but not a polynomial. Hence, the space isn't complete.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Another angle: Could the integral of the difference being small imply uniform convergence? Because if two functions are close in L¹, then their maximum differences are bounded. Wait, perhaps using Markov's inequality or something like that.

Wait, let me think about a specific example. Let's say I have a sequence of polynomials p_n(x) that converges uniformly to a continuous function f(x) on [0,1]. Then, as n increases, p_n(x) approaches f(x), and thus |p_n(x) - p_m(x)| approaches zero uniformly. So the integral of |p_n - p_m| would approach zero, making ρ(p_n, p_m) small. So in that case, the sequence is Cauchy.

But the converse isn't true. If the integral of |p_n - p_m| is small, it doesn't necessarily mean that p_n converges uniformly. Because two functions could be getting "close" in L¹ even if they don't converge uniformly. For example, consider two functions that are close everywhere except near a point. But in our case, the space is on a closed interval [0,1], which is compact. So maybe the functions need to be uniformly close on a compact space.

Wait, but I'm not sure if L¹ convergence on a compact interval implies uniform convergence. No, that's not true. There are functions that are Cauchy in L¹ but don't converge uniformly. For example, functions like f_n(x) = x^n on [0,1] converge pointwise to the Heaviside step function, but in L¹, it's not Cauchy because the integral of |x^n - x^m| is 1/(n+1) -1/(m+1), which tends to zero as n and m grow, so it is Cauchy in L¹. But the limit isn't continuous, so the space C[0,1] isn't complete under L¹, but P[0,1] is a subset of C[0,1], so the same issue applies.

Wait, so in P[0,1], any Cauchy sequence in ρ would converge to a function in C[0,1], but not necessarily a polynomial. So perhaps the space isn't complete under ρ. But that would mean the answer is 0 for completeness, so the correct answer is 0.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to find a counterexample. Suppose I have a sequence of polynomials that converges to a continuous function f, but f is not a polynomial. Then, the integral of |p_n - f| would approach zero, making the sequence Cauchy in ρ, but the limit f is not in P[0,1], so the space isn't complete.

Wait, but the problem is whether P[0,1] is complete with respect to ρ. So yes, because the limit may not be in P[0,1], the space isn't complete. So the answer would be 0.

Wait, but wait! Another angle: Maybe the integral metric is equivalent to L¹ convergence, which is the same as uniform convergence on [0,1], which as I thought, requires the functions to be continuous. So in that case, the limit function would be continuous, but not necessarily a polynomial, so the space isn't complete.

So I think the space is not complete under ρ. Therefore, the answer is 0.

The space P[0,1] with the metric ρ is not complete. Therefore, the answer is 0.
