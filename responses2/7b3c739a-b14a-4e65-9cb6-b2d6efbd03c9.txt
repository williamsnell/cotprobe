Okay, so I have this question about group homomorphisms from the integers Z into the group Z_2. Hmm, I need to find how many such homomorphisms there are. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Z is the set of all integers, and Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2, which has two elements, 0 and 1, with addition modulo 2. A homomorphism between these groups would need to preserve the group operation, which here is addition.

So, a homomorphism φ: Z → Z_2 must satisfy φ(a + b) = φ(a) + φ(b) for all a, b in Z. Let me think about what φ has to do with the structure of Z.

Z is an infinite cyclic group, generated by 1. That means every element in Z can be written as n*1, where n is an integer. So, for any element n in Z, φ(n) = φ(1 + 1 + ... +1) n times. But since φ is a homomorphism, φ(n*1) = n*φ(1). So, φ is completely determined by the value of φ(1). Let's denote φ(1) = x, where x is in Z_2. So, x can be 0 or 1.

Wait, so there are two possibilities here: either φ(1) is 0 or 1. But I need to check if both possibilities are allowed and if they lead to valid homomorphisms.

If φ(1) = 0, then φ(n) = n*0 = 0 for all n. So that's a valid homomorphism. It maps every integer to 0 in Z_2.

If φ(1) = 1, then φ(n) = n*1 mod 2. So, for even n, φ(n) = 0, and for odd n, φ(n) = 1. Let me check if this is a homomorphism. Take any two integers a and b. Then φ(a + b) = (a + b) mod 2. Since φ(a) + φ(b) mod 2 is (a mod 2) + (b mod 2) mod 2, which is the same as (a + b) mod 2. So, yes, that works. So this is another homomorphism.

Wait a second, so there are two possible homomorphisms: one that sends everything to 0, and another that sends even integers to 0 and odd integers to 1. Are there any more? Or are these the only two possibilities?

Wait, another thought: since Z is generated by 1, any homomorphism is determined by where it sends 1. So, since φ(1) can only be 0 or 1, there are only two possible homomorphisms. So, the number of homomorphisms from Z to Z_2 is 2.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me confirm this. Let's think about what's the image of φ. Since Z is infinite, the image of φ would have to be either trivial (only 0) or isomorphic to Z_2. Because the kernel of φ would be a subgroup of Z, so it must be either Z or the trivial group. If the kernel is Z, then φ is trivial. If the kernel is trivial, then φ is an injection from Z to Z_2. But Z is infinite, and Z_2 is finite, so there can't be an injective homomorphism from Z to Z_2. Because the images under an injective homomorphism would be infinite, but Z_2 is finite. So the only homomorphism possible is the trivial one, mapping everything to 0. Oh wait, that's a problem because earlier I thought there were two possibilities.

Wait, wait, no. Actually, no, because earlier I considered that φ(1) can be 0 or 1. Hmm, but from the group theory perspective, let me think again.

In group theory, any homomorphism from Z to Z_2. Since Z is generated by 1, the homomorphism is uniquely determined by φ(1). So, φ(1) must be an element of Z_2. So φ(1) can be 0 or 1. So, that's two possibilities.

Wait, but the earlier conclusion that only the trivial homomorphism exists is conflicting. So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me think again. If φ: Z → Z_2 is a homomorphism, then as Z is cyclic, the image of Z is a cyclic subgroup of Z_2. The possible images are the trivial subgroup {0} or the entire group Z_2. 

So, for an injective homomorphism, the image would have to be Z_2, but Z is infinite, so an injective homomorphism can't exist. Therefore, the only homomorphism is the trivial one, mapping everything to 0. Which would be the case when φ(1) =0. So why earlier I thought that φ(1) =1 would also be a valid homomorphism?

Wait, wait, no. If φ(1) is 1, then φ is the inclusion of Z into Z_2, mapping even integers to 0 and odd to 1. But wait, that can't be right because Z is infinite, but Z_2 is finite. There's no way an injective homomorphism can exist, because the image would have to be infinite. So, that must mean that φ cannot be injective, so the only possible homomorphism is the trivial one.

Wait, so I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me clarify.

In group theory, for a cyclic group Z, any homomorphism into a group G must be determined by where it sends the generator. So, if G is Z_2, the image of φ can only be a cyclic subgroup of G. Since Z_2 is cyclic of order 2, the possible images are {0} or {0,1}.

So the possible homomorphisms are:

1. The trivial homomorphism sending everything to 0.

2. The homomorphism sending 1 to 1, and hence mapping all even integers to 0 and all odd integers to 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that φ(1) is 1 would map every integer n to n mod 2. But that can't be a homomorphism because, for example, φ(2) = 0, but 2*1 = 0 mod 2, so φ(2) =0, which is equal to 2*φ(1) = 2*1 mod 2 = 0. That works. Similarly, φ(1+1) = φ(2) = 0, which is φ(1) + φ(1) = 1+1=2 mod 2=0. So, that's fine. So, that's a valid homomorphism.

Wait, but that would be a homomorphism from Z to Z_2, but then the kernel is {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}, which is a subgroup of Z. So, that's valid because the kernel is an infinite cyclic subgroup.

Wait, but then φ(1)=1 is a homomorphism. So, there are two homomorphisms. So, why did I think earlier that φ(1) can't be 1 because of the injective condition?

Wait no, the injective condition applies only to homomorphisms whose images are isomorphic to Z. But in this case, the image is Z_2, which is not isomorphic to Z. So, the only homomorphism is the trivial one. So, my mistake was considering injective homomorphisms, but here we're considering all homomorphisms, which includes the non-injective ones.

So, the correct answer is 2.

But then, the options are as follows: option D is 0, which I don't think is correct. So, looking back at the options, the correct answer should be 2, which is option E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there two homomorphisms from Z to Z_2? The first is the trivial one, every element maps to 0. The second is the one that maps n to n mod 2. So, that's two. So, the answer is 2, which is option E.
</think>

The question asks for the number of homomorphisms from Z to Z_2. Since Z is cyclic, each homomorphism is determined by the image of 1. If the image is 0, then the homomorphism is trivial. If the image is 1, the homomorphism maps even integers to 0 and odd integers to 1. Thus, there are two homomorphisms.
