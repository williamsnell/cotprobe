Okay, so I've got this question about the solid-state structures of elemental boron's principal allotropes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

I remember that boron has different allotropes, and each has a specific structure. I think boron can exist in a few different forms, like diamond, hexagonal, and cubic structures. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall.

So, elemental boron is B, right? Boron is a metalloid, and it's known for having various allotropes. One of the main structures is the diamond cubic structure, which I believe is a space-filling network. Oh wait, that's the diamond cubic structure, which is a three-dimensional network of B atoms arranged in a way that each atom is connected to four others. I think that structure is made up of tetrahedra because each carbon in diamond is connected to four others in a tetrahedral arrangement. So, the diamond structure is B12, and it's a tetrahedral network. So that would correspond to option C, which is B4 tetrahedra. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the diamond structure has each tetrahedron made of B atoms. So each tetrahedron is made of 4 B atoms. So the structure isn't based on how many B atoms make each unit, but the number of tetrahedra. So the diamond structure has B12 as the total atoms and a tetrahedral network.

Wait, but the question is about the structural units of the allotropes. So the question is asking which structural units are present. For example, the diamond structure has a tetrahedral lattice where each tetrahedron is a unit. So the structural unit is a tetrahedron. So the answer would be B4 tetrahedra. Because each unit has four B atoms, each attached in a tetrahedral arrangement.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another allotrope is the hexagonal structure. I think in the hexagonal structure, each atom is connected in a hexagonal pattern. Oh right, the hexagonal structure is a form of the hexagonal network. Wait, the hexagonal network is a type of crystal structure, which has hexagons as faces. So each hexagon is a unit of the structure. Or is it a unit made of multiple atoms?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The diamond structure, as I said, is made of tetrahedral units. Each tetrahedron has four B atoms. The hexagonal structure, perhaps, has hexagonal units, each hexagon consisting of six B atoms? Or maybe each hexagon is a unit, but that's a different structure. Or wait, perhaps in the hexagonal structure, each hexagon is a part of the structure, but the unit is a single hexagon.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. The question is about the structural units of the principal allotropes. So for example, the diamond structure has a tetrahedral unit. The hexagonal structure, which I think is the hextet structure, has hexagons. Or is it the hextet structure which has a six-membered ring? Or perhaps the hexagonal network is made of hexagons, so the unit is a hexagon.

Wait, another way to approach this is to remember the names. The diamond structure is called the diamond cubic structure, which is a network where each carbon is part of a tetrahedron. So the units are tetrahedra. So the structural units are B4 tetrahedra. So the answer would be option C.

But then, what about the hexagonal structure? Oh wait, the hexagonal structure is called the hextet structure. Each hexagon has six atoms, so the unit is a hexagon. So that would be option F, which is B9 nonagons. Because each hexagon has six B atoms, so the structural unit is a hexagon, which is a nonagon? Wait, no, a hexagon is six sides, but the term 'nonagon' is nine, so maybe I'm mixing this up. Wait, no, if each hexagon is six B atoms, then the unit is a hexagon, which is a six-sided polygon. So the option would be B9? No, because B9 would imply a nonagon, which is nine-sided. That doesn't match. So perhaps I'm wrong about that.

Wait, perhaps the hexagonal structure's unit is a hexagon. So each hexagon has six B atoms. So the structural unit is a hexagon, which is a six-sided polygon. So looking at the options, the hexagons would correspond to B6, but none of the options say that. Wait, the options are:

Looking at the options, for example, option F is B9 nonagons, which doesn't make sense if the unit is a hexagon. So perhaps the hexagonal structure is made of hexagons, but none of the options have hexagons except perhaps option G, which is B8 cubes. No, option G is B8 cubes, which would imply an octahedron. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look up each option's structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of atoms in each unit. For example:

- Diamond structure: each tetrahedron has 4 B atoms. So the unit is a tetrahedron. So option C is correct.

- Hexagonal structure: each hexagon has six B atoms. So the structural unit is a hexagon, but the options don't have that. Wait, but looking at the options, the hexagonal structure isn't one of the options. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong.

Wait, another thought. The diamond structure is a network of tetrahedra, each made of four B atoms. So each tetrahedron is a unit. So the structure is made of tetrahedra, which is option C.

For the hexagonal structure, perhaps the unit is a hexagon, which would be six B atoms. So the unit is a hexagon. So the correct option would be one that includes a hexagon as the unit. But looking at the options, option G is B8 cubes. That's an octahedron. Option F is nonagons, which is nine sides. Option B is decagons, which is 10. Option H is heptagons (7 sides), option I is icosahedra (20 faces, each a triangle), and option J is octahedra (8 faces, each a triangle, but as a unit).

Wait, so perhaps the hexagonal structure is made up of hexagons, but none of the options say something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the hexagonal lattice is made of hexagons, so each hexagon is a unit. But the options don't have a hexagon, so maybe the question is about the diamond structure.

Wait, but the question says "the principal allotropes of elemental boron are made up of which of the following structural units?" So each allotrope has its own structural unit.

So if the question is about the principal allotropes, which are the diamond, the hextet, and the hexagonal structures. So each of these has their own units.

The diamond structure: each unit is a tetrahedron (like option C).

The hextet structure (hexagonal) has each unit as a hexagon (so a six-sided polygon), but none of the options say that. Wait, looking at the options, option G is B8 cubes, which are octahedrons. So that's a different structure. Option F is nonagons, which is a nine-sided polygon. Option B is decagons.

Wait, perhaps the hextet structure is made of hexagons, but the options don't have that. So maybe the question is referring to the diamond structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the actual structures.

The diamond structure is a network where each carbon is bonded to four others, arranged in a tetrahedral pattern. So the unit is a tetrahedron.

Another structure is the hextet (hexagonal) structure, which has each atom in a hexagonal arrangement. But how is that structured? Each hexagon is made of six B atoms.

Wait, but looking at the options, the only options I see are for tetrahedra, hexagons (nonagons?), cubes, etc. Wait, perhaps the question is about the diamond structure, which is a tetrahedral network. So the structural unit is a tetrahedron. So option C, which says B4 tetrahedra.

Alternatively, perhaps the hextet structure (hexagonal) is made of hexagons. But if that's the case, it's not an option. So perhaps the question is about the diamond structure, which is made up of tetrahedra. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the diamond structure's unit is tetrahedra, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the diamond structure is a network of tetrahedra, so each unit is a tetrahedron. So option C is correct.

Another way to think: the diamond structure has B atoms arranged in a way that each is part of a tetrahedron, so the unit is a tetrahedron. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, some sources say that the diamond structure is a tetrahedral network, each tetrahedron being the unit. So each tetrahedron is made of four B atoms. So the unit is a tetrahedron, so option C.

But another possibility is that the hextet structure is made up of hexagons. So each hexagon is a unit. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is referring to the diamond structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structures in terms of their unit cells. The diamond structure is a space-filling network, which is a B12 structure. So it's a tetrahedron-based network, each tetrahedron is a unit. So the option is C.

Wait, so in that case, the answer is option C.

The question asks about the structural units of the principal allotropes of elemental boron. Boron has several allotropes, including the diamond cubic structure, the hextet (hexagonal) structure, and the hexagonal structure. Each of these structures has distinct unit cells. 

1. **Diamond Cubic Structure**: This is a space-filling network where each carbon atom is bonded to four others in a tetrahedral arrangement. The unit cell is a tetrahedron, and each tetrahedron is made up of four boron atoms. Therefore, the structural unit is a tetrahedron.

2. **Hexagonal Structure**: This structure is characterized by hexagonal units, where each hexagon consists of six boron atoms. However, none of the provided options explicitly describe hexagons. Instead, the options focus on tetrahedra, cubes, and other polygons (e.g., nonagons, heptagons, octagons, etc.).

Given the options provided, the diamond cubic structure is the most clearly defined, as it is a tetrahedral network with each unit being a tetrahedron. The other structures, while important, do not align with the options or are not as clearly described.
