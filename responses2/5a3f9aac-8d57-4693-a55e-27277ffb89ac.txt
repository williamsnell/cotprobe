Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gravitational force on a person in an accelerating automobile. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says, what's the gravitational force on a 70 kg person when the car accelerates at 4 m/s²? The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. 

Hmm, wait, gravitational force. Oh right, gravitational force is usually calculated using Newton's second law, F equals mass times acceleration. But wait, wait—what's the direction here? Because when the car accelerates forward, the person inside would feel pushed back. That's the normal force, not the gravitational force. Oh, right, the gravitational force is the person's weight, which is their mass times the acceleration due to gravity (g, approximately 9.8 m/s²).

So, the gravitational force on the person is m * g. Here, m is 70 kg. So, 70 multiplied by 9.8. Let me compute that. 70 times 10 is 700, but 9.8 is 0.2 less than 10. So 70 * 9.8 = 70*(10-0.2) =700-14=696 N. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 696 exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options are A through J. Let's list them: A is 840 N, B is 140, C 350, D 280, E 686, F 700, G 280, H 4, I 70, J 0.

Wait, 70 * 9.8 is 686, because 70*9.8 = (70*10)- (70*0.2)=700-14=686. So that's option E, which is 686 N. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Wait, but the question is about gravitational force on the person. Oh, wait, no. The gravitational force on the person due to Earth is their weight, which is m*g. So that's 70*9.8=686 N. So option E is 686 N, which would be the correct answer.

But wait, I should make sure that perhaps the question is considering the normal force or something else. Because sometimes when someone is in an accelerating car, the apparent weight might change. But no, the question says the force on the person, which is their weight. Or does it consider the normal force?

Wait, the problem states, "gravitational force on a person whose mass is 70 kg when he is sitting in an automobile that accelerates at 4 m/s²." Wait, but the gravitational force is the person's weight, which is m * g. The acceleration of the car would affect the normal force, but the gravitational force is still m * g.

So regardless of the car's acceleration, the person's weight stays the same. So the gravitational force is 686 N. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is 686 N. So that's the answer. So the options are:

A: 8.4e2=840 (twice 400? Or 840? 840 is 70*12.0, no)
Wait, no, 70 * 12 is 840, which would be option A. Hmm, but that's if acceleration is 12.0, but the question says 4 m/s². So option E is correct.
</think>

To determine the gravitational force on a 70 kg person in an accelerating automobile, we use the formula for gravitational force, which is the person's weight: 

\[
F = m \cdot g
\]

Here, \( m = 70 \, \text{kg} \) and \( g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Substituting these values:

\[
F = 70 \cdot 9.8 = 686 \, \text{N}
\]

This calculation shows that the gravitational force on the person is \( 686 \, \text{N} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is **E: 686 N**.
