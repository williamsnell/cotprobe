Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an elevator in free fall. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the net force acting on a mass M in a freely falling elevator. The acceleration is given as a_O^y = -g^{y}, and y is measured upward from the Earth's surface. 

Wait, I remember that in free fall, the acceleration is due to gravity, but wait, in non-inertial frames, things are a bit different. Oh right, when you're in a freely falling elevator, you're in a state of free fall, so effectively you're in free space, but the frame itself is accelerating. 

So the acceleration given is a_O^y = -g^{y}. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Normally, free fall would have a acceleration of g downward, but here it's negative g, which suggests that upward is positive. So in this case, a_O is -g. Oh wait, but when you're in a freely falling elevator, the acceleration you experience is indeed g downward, but in the frame of the elevator, things are perceived differently. 

Wait, but the elevator is accelerating downward with acceleration a_O, which is equal to -g. So the elevator's acceleration is g downward. So any object inside would experience an acceleration relative to that frame. 

But wait, the question is about the net force on the mass M. Let me think about forces. Normally, in an inertial frame, the net force on an object is mass times acceleration. But in a non-inertial frame (like the freely falling elevator), the net force is equal to the sum of real forces plus the fictitious forces.

Wait, no. The net force in a non-inertial frame is the real forces plus the centrifugal and Coriolis forces. But wait, the problem is more straightforward than that. Let me think again. 

In a freely falling elevator, the acceleration is a_O = -g. So the elevator is in free fall, so if you're inside, you'd feel weightless. So the acceleration relative to the Earth's frame is g downward. 

Wait, but the question is about what the net force on M is. So in the Earth's frame, the elevator is accelerating downward at g. Therefore, any object inside the elevator would have a net force equal to M times that acceleration. 

Wait, the acceleration is a_O = -g, so a = -g. So F = M*a = M*(-g) = -Mg. So the net force is -Mg, which would mean a force of Mg downward. But wait, wait. Because in the Earth's frame, the acceleration is g downward, so the net force is Mg downward. 

Wait, but let me think again. In the Earth's frame, the elevator is accelerating downward at g. So any object in the elevator experiences a force of Mg downward. Because F = M a, a being g downwards. So the net force on M is Mg downward. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, the acceleration is given as a_O^y = -g^y. Oh wait, so that's in the y-direction, which is upward being positive. So a_O^y is negative, meaning acceleration is downward, which is correct because it's a free fall. So the acceleration is -g. 

So according to the Earth's frame, the net force on M is Mg downward. But wait, what are the options? Let me look. 

Option E says M is weightless. That would be the case if the net force is zero, which doesn't match here because force is Mg downward. So E is incorrect. 

Option A says M is stationary relative to the Earth's surface. Well, if the elevator is in free fall, it would be moving downward with the same acceleration as g. So relative to the Earth, M is accelerating, so it's not stationary. So A is incorrect. 

Option B: M is falling at the same rate as the elevator. Hmm, in free fall, the elevator is accelerating downward at g, so M is accelerating downward at g. So the elevator and M are going down, same acceleration, so M is indeed falling at the same rate. So B is correct? Wait, but the question is about the net force, not whether M is moving. 

Wait, the question is about the net force. So if the net force is Mg downward, that's a force equal to the weight of M, acting downward. So D says M experiences a force equal to its weight downward. That would be correct. 

But wait, wait. Because in the Earth's frame, the elevator is accelerating downward at g, so the object experiences a force F = M a. So F = Mg downward. So the force is equal in magnitude and direction to the weight. So D is correct. 

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says that the acceleration is a_O^y = -g^y. So the acceleration is downward, which is -g. So the net force on M is Mg downward. So D's correct. So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, another approach: in a freely falling frame, objects are weightless. But that's about being in an inertial frame. Wait, but the question is about the net force in a non-inertial frame. So in the elevator, which is a non-inertial frame, the effective force depends on the acceleration.

Wait, but the question is asking for net force acting on M, not about what it feels like to M. So the frame is non-inertial, so M experiences a force from the Earth (real force) plus fictitious forces.

But wait, in the non-inertial frame (elevator), the only real force is gravity. The other forces would be the pseudo-force. But in free fall, the elevator is accelerating downward at g. So in the elevator's frame, the acceleration is zero, so the real force would be zero, but the pseudo-force would be M a, which is Mg downward.

Wait, so in the non-inertial frame (the elevator), the pseudo-force is M a, which is M*(-g) = -Mg. But in the frame, the acceleration is zero, so the net force is just the pseudo-force, which is -Mg. So the net force is Mg downward. So the options: option D says M experiences a force equal to its weight downward. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the elevator is in free fall, then in the Earth's frame, the acceleration is g downward. So the net force on M is Mg downward. So the answer is D.

Wait, but what about the other options? Option E says M is weightless. That's true, but the question is about the net force, not whether it's weightless. So E is not correct. 

So the correct answer should be D: M experiences a force equal to its weight downward.

To determine the net force acting on a mass \( M \) at rest in a freely falling elevator, we analyze the situation in the Earth's frame of reference. The elevator accelerates downward with an acceleration \( a_O^\ding{217} = -g^\ding{217} \), where \( g^\ding{217} \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and the upward direction is defined as positive. This means the elevator is in free fall, accelerating downward at \( g \).

In the Earth's frame, the acceleration of the elevator is \( a = -g \). According to Newton's second law, the net force on the mass \( M \) is given by:

\[
F_{\text{net}} = M \cdot a = M \cdot (-g) = -Mg
\]

This indicates that the net force on \( M \) is \( Mg \) downward, which is equivalent to its weight. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A: \( M \) is stationary relative to the Earth's surface.**  
  This is incorrect because the elevator and the mass \( M \) are accelerating downward at \( g \), so \( M \) is not stationary relative to the Earth's surface.

- **B: \( M \) is falling at the same rate as the elevator.**  
  This is incorrect because, while the elevator is accelerating downward at \( g \), the mass \( M \) is also accelerating downward at \( g \) in the Earth's frame.

- **C: \( M \) experiences twice the gravitational force.**  
  This is incorrect because the net force on \( M \) is \( Mg \), not \( 2Mg \).

- **D: \( M \) experiences a force equal to its weight downward.**  
  This is correct because the net force on \( M \) is equal in magnitude and direction to its weight (\( Mg \)) downward.

- **E: \( M \) is weightless.**  
  This is incorrect because, in the freely falling frame, the mass \( M \) experiences a net force equal to its weight, not being weightless.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is that \( M \) experiences a force equal to its weight downward.
