Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The assumption by a government of the office of Reliever-general to the poor is necessarily forbidden by the principle that a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect. In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. …
The poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.
Herbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a passage from a book by Herbert Spencer. I need to figure out which option correctly infers from the passage. Let me read through the passage carefully.

The passage starts by talking about theReliever-general and how he's supposed to protect the people. It mentions that the government cannot do anything more than protect, which suggests that the government's role is limited. So, when the government asks citizens to contribute for mitigating distress, the state is reversing its function. That probably means it's not acting as a public defender but is taking on a more formal role, maybe like an institution.

Then, the passage talks about the poverty of the poor, the distress caused by imprudent citizens, starvation, and other social issues. It says these decrees are due to benevolent forces of a large farsayers, and when looked at together, these harsh situations are seen as the highest good. 

Spencer's work is "Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851." From what I remember, Spencer's ideas were more about biology and human nature, but he also wrote about social welfare and moral values. In his book, he discusses the nature of society and the role of the government.

Looking at the options, let's break them down based on the passage. The key points are about the government's role and the importance of social welfare.

Option A: believed working people should unite for a common cause. Spencer's work is more about how humans choose their own course rather than working people united. He's more about individual choice and biology, not collective action.

Option B: believed government should ensure satisfaction of citizens' needs. Spencer talks about the needs being driven by benevolent forces, but this seems more like a balance between needs rather than a commitment to ensuring satisfaction. The passage doesn't clearly state this point.

Option C: supported government intervention in economic matters. Spencer doesn't mention anything about intervention in the economy. He focuses more on social welfare and individual choices.

Option D: advocated for higher taxes to support social causes. Spencer doesn't support this either. He was more about individualism and natural selection.

Option E: believed government should do more than merely protect its people. This seems to align with the passage. Spencer's idea is that the government's role is not just protective but intended to serve the common good, perhaps through welfare states.

Option F: believed in a society where the strong help the weak. Spencer's work on social welfare supports this, as he talked about the welfare state. So this option seems correct.

Option G: opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor. Spencer didn't support this. He believed in the welfare state, which would include providing aid through taxes.

Option H: advocated for a welfare state. This directly matches the passage's emphasis on the government's role in ensuring the welfare of the poor and the society as a whole.

Now, looking back at the question, the passage says the government "cannot rightly do anything more than protect." And when the state is reversing its function in demanding contributions, it's because it's not protecting but acting formally. So, the passage suggests the government is not just protecting but also doing something more in terms of a system that serves the common good.

So, the options that are correct from the passage are E and H. Let's check the passage again. It says, "the state is reversing its function," which implies the government is taking on a more formal role beyond merely protecting. So, the government is not just protecting but also ensuring the welfare of the population. 

Looking at the options, E says the government should do more than merely protect. H says advocate for a welfare state. So both are correct, but the options are single selections. The question is, which one is the correct inference.

Wait, the passage says "the state is reversing its function." That suggests that it's not acting as a defender but as a formal entity. So the government is not merely protecting but also doing something else. So both E and H seem correct, but in the options, E and H are separate.

Wait, let me re-express the options:

E: believed government should do more than merely protect its people.

H: advocated for a welfare state.

The passage says the government cannot do more than protect. So, that suggests the government's function is not merely protective. So the government is doing more than just protecting. So the correct inference is that the government should do more than merely protect, which is E. Also, the passage says that the state is reversing its function, which implies the government is acting as a formal entity beyond just protecting. So, the government is not just protecting but also serving the common good—so providing welfare.

So, the two correct points are E and H. But the question allows only one correct answer.

Wait, the question is asking which one may infer from the passage. So, the passage says that the government can't do anything more than protect, and that when it demands contributions, it's reversing its function, implying that the government is taking on a more formal role than just protection.

So, the government's role is not merely protective but also includes welfare. That points to H as correct. Alternatively, E could be correct because it's the government's role to do more than merely protect.

Wait, let me think of each option.

E: believed the government should do more than merely protect its people. So, the government's role is more than protection. So, yes, that's correct.

H: advocate for a welfare state. So, the government is creating a welfare system, which is welfare state.

So both E and H are correct in their own ways. But perhaps the intended answer is E, because the passage states that the government cannot do anything more than protect, which implies that the government is doing something else beyond just protection. So that's E.

Wait, but the question is about what the passage infers. The passage says the government can't do anything more than protect. So, the government's role is not just protecting, but also serving others beyond that. So, the government is taking on a role that's more than protection. So, the inference is that the government should do more than merely protect, which is E.

Alternatively, the passage's emphasis on the state reversing its function and the need for welfare suggests that the government is creating a welfare state, which is option H. But the question is which one is inferred.

Let me read the passage again. It says "the government cannot rightly do anything more than protect." That means the government's role is not just protection. So, the government is not merely protecting but also serving or doing something else. So, the government's role is more than just protection, which is E.

But another part of the passage says that to enforce the fundamental law, it has to take care of every man in his rights. So, the state isn't just protecting but ensuring that everyone's rights are respected and that they can do whatever they want. So, that would imply that the government is taking on the role of creating a welfare system, which is a welfare state. So, H is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the inference from the passage. Which one is a direct inference.

The passage says that the government cannot do anything more than protect. So, the government's role is not merely protecting—so E is correct.

Alternatively, the passage also says that the state is reversing its function when it demands contributions. So, the government is taking on a more formal role beyond just protecting. So, the government is doing more than just protecting, which is E.

But wait, the options are each a separate statement. So, if the question is which one the passage infers, then both E and H are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers.

Wait, looking back at the options, E is about more than merely protecting, which is a broader inference from the passage. H is about creating a welfare state, which is a specific form of modifying the government's role beyond just protection.

In the context of the question, the passage says the government's function is not just protecting but also serving the common good. So, the government is not merely protecting, but serving others. So, the inference is that the government should do more than merely protect, which is E.

Alternatively, the passage says that when the government demands contributions, it's not just protecting but taking on a more formal role. So, that supports the idea that the government is not only protecting but is also doing something else—i.e., a welfare state. So, H would be the correct inference.

Wait, but the options are E and H, both possible. But the question is about the inference from the passage, which points to both E and H being correct.

Hmm, but the options are single letters, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the passage is more about the welfare state. Let me think. The passage starts by saying that the government cannot do anything more than protect. So the government's role is not just protecting but also ensuring that everyone can live in their own rights, which is the welfare state. So the government is not just protecting but also providing welfare, which is a welfare state.

So, the correct inference is that the government advocates for a welfare state, which is H. 

Wait, but the passage says that the government's role is not merely protecting. It's not just protecting, but also acting as a formal entity. So, perhaps the answer is E, because it's about the government's role beyond just protecting.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up a bit more.

Herbert Spencer's work: in "Social Statistics," he talks about the importance of social welfare. He believed that the government should take into account the welfare of the poor and provide support. So, the passage's emphasis is on this. 

The passage says that the state is reversing its function, so the government is not merely protecting but taking on a role as a welfare provider. Therefore, the government's role is more than just protecting; it's also creating a welfare state. So, the correct inference is that the government advocates for a welfare state, which is option H.

So, the answer would be H.
</think>

The passage discusses Herbert Spencer's beliefs about the government's role beyond just protecting the people. It emphasizes that the government cannot do anything more than protect and that the state is reversing its function when demanding contributions for mitigating distress. This implies that the government is not merely protecting but also ensuring the welfare of the people, which aligns with the concept of a welfare state. Therefore, the correct inference is that the government advocates for a welfare state.

**Answer: H**
