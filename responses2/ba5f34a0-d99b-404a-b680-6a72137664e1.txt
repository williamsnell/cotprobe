Okay, so I've got this question about the detection of a just-noticeable difference, or JND. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through. 

Hmm, JND is the smallest change that can be just noticed by the human senses. I remember it's related to how we perceive things—like how a slight increase in brightness can be barely noticeable. The question is asking what factors determine this JND.

The options are A to D. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Presence of a "no stimulus" control and the sensitivity of the signal-detection equipment. Wait, I don't remember that being the main factor. I think the no-stimulus control is more related to the null hypothesis significance testing, maybe in experiments. Also, the equipment's sensitivity—I'm not sure how that directly relates to JND. Maybe it's about the threshold itself, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Initial determination of the absolute threshold and the variation of the difference threshold. Absolute threshold is the smallest detectable signal, right? And the difference threshold is the smallest change that can be detected from the absolute threshold. Oh wait, no, that's more about the just noticeable difference. So JND is the difference between the absolute threshold and the difference threshold, but that's when you're comparing two stimuli. Wait, no, the JND is the change that makes the two stimuli just noticeable. So the JND is the difference between the absolute threshold and the threshold of difference. So the factors involved would be the absolute threshold and the threshold of difference. 

Option C: Frequency of the existing stimulus and the presence of one or more sensory modalities. Hmm, I'm not sure. Does the frequency of the existing stimulus matter? Or the presence of multiple senses? Like, does having two senses (like sight and sound) affect how we perceive a JND? I don't think that's a primary factor; more about the actual stimuli and their intensity.

Option D: Intensity of the new stimulus and that of the stimulus already present. Oh, this sounds familiar. I think the JND depends on how much the new stimulus is compared to the existing one. I remember that when you have two stimuli, the JND is the smallest change in the new one that would make it just as noticeable as the existing one. So the ratio of the two intensities is important. Like, if the existing is stronger, the JND is bigger. So yes, the intensity of both is a key factor.

Let me think again. So the question is about what determines JND. The options are about what factors are involved.

Option B is absolute threshold (smallest detectable signal) and difference threshold (smallest change to reach threshold). So JND is the difference between these two. Wait, no, JND is actually the difference between the absolute threshold and the threshold of difference. So the threshold of difference is the point where a change in the new stimulus just makes the two stimuli appear equally noticeable.

Wait, I think the JND is the difference between the absolute threshold (the smallest detectable signal) and the threshold of difference (the smallest detectable change that makes the two just noticeable). So the presence of a no-stimulus control is maybe not part of this. Also, the difference threshold itself is related to the sensitivity of the equipment.

Looking back at the options, option B says the absolute threshold and the variation of the difference threshold. That sounds a bit confused. Because the absolute threshold is a specific value, and the difference threshold is another. The JND is the difference between them.

Alternatively, option D says the intensity of the new and existing stimuli. That makes more sense. Because the JND would depend on how much the new stimulus is relative to the existing one. For example, if you have a strong existing stimulus, a small change in the new might not be noticeable. So the ratio of their intensities is key.

So option D seems to be the correct answer. The JND is determined by the intensities of the new and existing stimuli. So the right answer is D.
</think>

The detection of a just-noticeable difference (JND) depends on the relative intensity between the new stimulus and the existing one. This is because the JND is the smallest change in the new stimulus that makes it just as noticeable as the existing one. The intensity of the new stimulus relative to the existing one determines how noticeable the change is. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because the "no stimulus" control and the sensitivity of the signal-detection equipment are not primary factors in determining JND.
- **Option B** is misleading because it refers to the absolute threshold and the variation of the difference threshold, which are not directly the factors determining JND.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the frequency and the presence of sensory modalities do not play a direct role in JND.
- **Option D** is correct because it accurately describes how JND is determined by the relative intensities of the new and existing stimuli.
