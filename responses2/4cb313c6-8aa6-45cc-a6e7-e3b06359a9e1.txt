Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantageâ€”the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places."
Frederick Douglass, 1857

Okay, so I have this question about Frederick Douglass and the case Dred Scott v. Sandford. Hmm, I remember that this is a key part of his legal case where he was trying to get the usury laws passed by the Fugitive Slave Act blocked. I think he won that case, which was a big deal because it would prevent slaves from selling to people who couldn't afford to pay the high interest on loans.

The question is asking about what the Chief Justice Roger Taney said about this case. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me think about the case. So, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1819, I believe, which was a law that allowed slave owners to sell their slaves to people who couldn't afford the high interest on loans. This was seen by many as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted states the right to determine slavery, but the Supreme Court had passed a rule in 1828 that allowed states to pass such laws, which might have been causing tension.

Dred Scott v. Sandford came in 1845. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional because it was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. So Taney's ruling would have been that the Court held the law to be invalid, so the ruling rule out the Fugitive Slave Act.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Corporations are entitled to the same protections as individuals. That's a common belief, but I don't think Taney said that. The Supreme Court ruled that the Fugitive Act was unconstitutional, not that corporations should have the same rights.

Option B: Fugitive slave act was unconstitutional. That's exactly what Taney said. The Court ruled it invalid, so that's the right answer.

Option C: Women had the right to vote. I don't think that's related to the case. The issue was slavery, not voting rights.

Option D: Separate facilities for races. That's more about the eugenics movement, which Douglass wasn't involved in. So probably not.

Option E: Every state can secede. That's a broader thing about states' rights, but the Supreme Court was the one deciding whether it was a valid state action. The Court's ruling was about the Fugitive Act, so that doesn't match.

Option F: Abolishing the abolitionist movement. That's more about the evolution of the movement, not directly about the case. The Supreme Court's ruling was about the Fugitive Act, not the movement itself.

Option G: School prayer as a church issue. That's a matter of state vs. private choice, not directly related.

Option H: Second Amendment about keeping and bearing arms. That's more about protection against reasonable fear, not about the Fugitive Act.

Option I: Slavery is state's rights. I think that was one of the issues in the case, but Taney didn't say it. His ruling was about the Fugitive Act, not the state's right to issue slavery.

Option J: Congress can regulate slavery. That's part of the argument for secession, but the Supreme Court ruled against it.

So the correct answer should be B. Taney upheld the view that the Fugitive slave act was unconstitutional, which the Court had invalidated. So the right answer is B.

The correct answer is **B: the Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional**. This is because the Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott v. Sandford that the Fugitive Slave Act was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, upholding the ruling that invalidated the law. 

**Answer: B**
