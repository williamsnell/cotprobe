Okay, so I've got this question here about professional ethics and how a junior psychologist would handle their role in a research study. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that a senior psychologist hires a junior one to do a research study. The junior helps run the experiment and analyzes the results. Now, when the research is submitted for publication, they have to follow some ethical standards, and the junior needs to comply.

The options are A to J, each suggesting a different way the junior could be credited. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in academic publishing, especially in research papers, authors are usually listed as contributors. But the exact way it's done can vary. Some authors are listed as co-authors, others as the first author, and sometimes they get specific credits.

In this case, the junior psychologist is helping run the experiment and analyzing results. They probably contributed significantly to the research. So, they might be listed as a co-author because they did the main work.

Looking at the options:

A: Co-author. That makes sense because they run the experiment and help with the analysis. They likely contributed the most, so it's probably a co-author.

B: Promoted to a senior position. That sounds more like a career advancement. But the question is about ethics, not about promotion. So probably not this.

C: Given a percentage of any profits. That seems like they're taking a financial stake. But I think this is more about profit-sharing, not necessarily contributing to the work. So probably not C.

D: Given credit in a footnote. Footnotes can mention contributions, but the question is about formal credit, which I think is more about co-authors or listing as authors.

E: Credited as the editor. That doesn't sound right. The editor is someone else, not necessarily contributing to the research itself.

F: Listed in the acknowledgements section. That's a bit vague. Acknowledgements are usually for mentioning people or mentioning the work, but the junior is an author, not an acknowledutor.

G: Thanked for doing a good job. This is a bit informal and more about acknowledgment than formal credit. I think it's not the standard way.

H: Given a bonus or raise. This is about compensation, not contributions to the research itself.

I: Given a bonus or raise. Same as H.

J: Listed as an author. That's the most formal way to credit someone who contributed to the work. Since the junior helped run the experiment, they'd likely be listed as an author.

Wait, but the junior's main role is running the experiment and analyzing results, which are steps in conducting the research. So they might have contributed to the methodology and analysis. So they would be listed as authors or co-authors.

So the correct answer should be J: listed as an author. Alternatively, A: co-author. But which is more appropriate?

In many cases, especially when someone is actively contributing, they are listed as co-authors. However, sometimes the first author is the senior. But in any case, the junior's main role is running the experiment, which might be part of the research, so they would be listed as an author.

Wait, but the question says the junior helped "run the experiment" and "helps analyze and write up the results." So they are directly involved in the methodology and results. So they would be an author.

I think the correct answer is J: listed as an author. Because the junior is an author, contributing the most to the project's results. So they should be an author.

The correct answer is J: listed as an author. The junior psychologist, having actively contributed to the research by running the experiment and analyzing results, is listed as an author. 

Answer: J
