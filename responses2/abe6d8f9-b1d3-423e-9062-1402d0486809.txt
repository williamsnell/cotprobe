Okay, so I have this equation here: 1.2 equals 0.4y. I need to find the value of y using mental math. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that to solve for y, I should isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation is 1.2 = 0.4y. So, I can divide both sides by 0.4 to get y by itself.

Dividing 1.2 by 0.4. Hmm, let me calculate that. I'm a bit rusty on decimal division, but I remember that dividing by a decimal can be tricky. Maybe I can convert them into fractions to make it easier.

So, 0.4 is the same as 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. And 1.2 is the same as 12/10, which is 6/5. So, the equation becomes 6/5 = (2/5)y.

To solve for y, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2. So, multiplying both sides by 5/2 gives:

(6/5) * (5/2) = y.

Calculating that, the 5s cancel out, leaving 6/2, which is 3. So, y equals 3.

Wait, but let me check if I did that right. Alternatively, I could think about how many times 0.4 goes into 1.2. Since 0.4 times 3 is 1.2, that confirms it.

Looking at the options provided, option A is 3, which matches my calculation. So, the correct answer should be A: 3.
