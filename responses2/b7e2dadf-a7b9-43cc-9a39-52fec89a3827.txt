Question:

Distinguish economic goods from free goods, and give an example of each.

Options:

A: Economic goods require large amounts of resources to produce, such as diamonds, while free goods are created with minimal resources, like sunlight.
B: Economic goods are non-renewable resources, like coal. Free goods regenerate naturally and have no cost, like wind energy.
C: Economic goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air. Free goods are scarce and command a positive price, like oil.
D: Economic goods and free goods are the same, both are available in sufficient quantity to satisfy all wants.
E: Economic goods are produced by the government and are free of charge, like public education. Free goods are produced by private companies and have high prices, like smartphones.
F: Economic goods are those that cannot be consumed by multiple people at once, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared by many simultaneously, like a public park.
G: Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil.
H: Economic goods are scarce and command a positive price, like oil. Free goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air.
I: Economic goods are services that come at a cost, like legal advice. Free goods are natural phenomena that are not owned, like moonlight.
J: Economic goods are items with no intrinsic value, like currency. Free goods are essential for survival and cannot be owned, like oxygen.

Okay, so I've got this question here about distinguishing between economic goods and free goods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to understand what each term means. Economic goods, if I remember correctly, are what people can buy with money. So they're tangible and have value. Free goods, on the other hand, are things that can be used for free without any cost. They don't require any money to have them, right?

Let me look at the options. The question asks to distinguish them and give examples of each. So I need to pick which option correctly identifies both economic goods and free goods with examples.

Option A: Economic goods require large resources, like diamonds. Free goods are created with minimal resources, like sunlight. Wait, that doesn't make sense because diamonds are natural resources, so free goods shouldn't require as much. Also, the examples don't fit. I think I saw an example where free goods are like sunlight, but that doesn't sound right. Maybe A is wrong.

Option B: Economic goods are non-renewable, like coal. Free goods regenerate and have no cost, like wind. That's confusing. Economic goods are non-renewable, which is a type of resource, not the goods themselves. Free goods being non-renewable doesn't make sense because free goods are not tied to the environment. Plus, free goods don't regenerate. So B is probably not correct.

Option C: Economic goods are plentiful, like air. Free goods are scarce, like oil. Hmm, so economic goods are abundant and free goods are scarce. Wait, no, because free goods are not the same as economic goods. I think that's the opposite. So C seems wrong.

Option D: They're the same. That can't be right because they're different types. Economic goods are tangible, free goods are not. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Economic goods are government-provided, like public education. Free goods are private companies and high prices, like smartphones. Wait, public education is a service, not a good. So E is mixing services with goods. Not sure, but maybe not right.

Option F: Economic goods can't be shared, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared, like a park. That's good to know. So economic goods are individual use, free goods are shared. So F might be correct. Let me think further.

Option G: Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil. Wait, that's opposite. Economic goods are free, free goods are not. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Economic goods are scarce and have a positive price, like oil. Free goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air. Oh, this sounds better. So H is saying that economic goods are scarce (meaning they require resources, like oil is scarce) and have a positive price. Free goods are abundant and satisfy all wants. So this would mean H is correct.

Option I: Economic goods are services, like legal advice. Free goods are natural phenomena, like moonlight. But free goods are not natural phenomena. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Economic goods are without intrinsic value, like currency. Free goods are essential and not owned, like oxygen. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Economic goods are without intrinsic value, implying they don't have any value, which is true for things like currency. But free goods are essential and not owned, which is also true. However, I think J is mixing concepts. The point is, J is correct in saying economic goods are without intrinsic value, but what about free goods? Are they essential or can they be shared? I'm not sure. It's a bit tricky.

Wait, let's re-examine each option. Let's see if F and H are the right answers.

F: Economic goods can't be shared, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared, like a park. That makes sense. So F is a good example.

H: Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil. Wait, that's a problem because economic goods are free, and free goods are not. So H is incorrect.

Wait, no, let me read H again. H says: "Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil." Oh, so the first part is correct (air is free), but the second part says free goods are costly and scarce, which is incorrect because free goods don't have cost. So H is incorrect.

Wait, then which options have correct statements? Let's re-express each.

Option H: "Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil." This is wrong because free goods can't be costly. So H is incorrect.

Wait, what about option F: "Economic goods can't be shared, like a sandwich." Free goods can be shared, like a park. That's correct.

Another option, option G: "Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil." No, because free goods aren't costly. So G is incorrect.

So which option is correct?

Looking back, I think option F is correct. Let me check the options again.

Option F: Economic goods are those that cannot be consumed by multiple people at once, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared by many simultaneously, like a public park.

Wait, I'm not sure if a sandwich is an economic good. An economic good would be something that you can buy, like a sandwich, but it's a single item. So the first part of F is correct: economic goods can't be shared, but I'm not sure if a sandwich is an economic good. Maybe that's an example.

Wait, the question is to distinguish between economic goods and free goods, so examples should be clear.

Another thought: economic goods are tangible items you can buy, free goods are not. So, for example, a sandwich is an economic good, and a public park is a free good.

So option F is correct in that sense.

Looking again at each option:

A: Both examples don't match. So A is out.

B: Economic goods are non-renewable, free are regeneration and no cost. That doesn't seem correct. Economic goods are natural resources, not non-renewable.

C: Economic goods are plentiful, free are scarce. No, free goods are not like that. So C is wrong.

D: Same goods? No, they are different.

E: Economic goods are government-provided (like education), free goods are private (like smartphones). No, because free goods aren't government-provided.

F: Economic goods can't be shared, free can. Yes, that's the correct distinction.

H: Economic goods are free (air), free are costly (oil). No, because free goods aren't costly. So H is wrong.

G: Economic goods are free, free are costly. No. So G is incorrect.

I: Economic goods are services, free goods are natural phenomena. No, free goods aren't natural.

J: Economic goods are without intrinsic value. True. Free goods are essential and not owned. True. But the way J is phrased, free goods are essential, which is correct. But the original question is to distinguish between economic and free goods, so J is correct in that sense but perhaps not the best answer.

Wait, the question asks us to pick the correct answer among A to J.

So looking back, the correct options are F and H. But H is incorrect because it says free goods are costly, which is not true. So H is wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but let me recheck.

Wait, the question is to pick an example of each. So in the options, the correct pair should have one example of each.

So F is correct as an example of free goods and economic goods, as sandwich can't be shared, park can.

And H is incorrect because it misrepresents free goods. So F is the correct answer.

To distinguish between economic goods and free goods, it's important to understand their definitions: economic goods are tangible items that can be purchased with money, while free goods can be used for free without any cost. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It misrepresents the nature of economic goods and provides examples of free goods that are not accurate.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Economic goods are not non-renewable; they are natural resources, and free goods do not regenerate naturally.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Economic goods are not plentiful; they are typically scarce, and free goods are not always scarce.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Economic goods and free goods are distinct categories.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It mixes services with goods incorrectly.
- **Option F**: Correct. It provides clear examples: economic goods (like a sandwich) cannot be shared, while free goods (like a public park) can be.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Economic goods are not free.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It inaccurately states that free goods are costly and scarce.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While J correctly identifies economic goods as without intrinsic value, it misrepresents free goods as essential and not owned.

The correct answer is **F**, as it accurately distinguishes economic goods from free goods and provides clear examples.

**Answer: F**
