Okay, so I've got this question about Feminist Therapy and how it relates to Fara's responsibilities. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question describes Fara's situation. She helps her mother in the kitchen, and her brother does yard work like their father. It sounds like there's a hierarchy here, where Fara is expected to do housework while her brother does yard work. This seems like a problem of power and hierarchy, where women are supposed to do one thing and men another.

Now, the question is asking which part of Feminist Therapy addresses these kinds of issues. I remember that Feminist Therapy deals with gender and power dynamics in society. It's about understanding how women and men are positioned in their lives and how that affects societal roles.

Looking at the options:

A: Self-Concept Therapy - This is about how individuals feel about themselves, focusing on identity and how it's formed. Not directly about power structures or societal expectations.

B: Feminist Object Relations - This sounds like it's about how objects are owned and used in society. It deals with how people's perceptions of objects change, especially regarding gender. This could relate to the idea of men doing yard work and women doing housework, which are object relations.

C: Household Responsibilities - This seems more about the structure of home life and duties. It's more about how tasks are assigned, but it doesn't specifically address the issue of power dynamics and gender expectations.

D: Maternal Role Therapy - This focuses on the expectations and roles of mothers, like how they're supposed to raise children. It's more about the role of the mother, not about the social hierarchy between siblings.

E: Empowerment Therapy - This is about giving people the tools to be effective and capable. It's about how individuals can take charge of their lives, but it's more about empowerment within the individual rather than the societal structures that affect that.

F: Family Dynamics Therapy - This is about how families function, how they interact, and how different family members' roles affect each other. It could be relevant here because Fara's situation involves family dynamics, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about Feminist issues.

G: Child Responsibility Therapy - Similar to Family Dynamics, this is about children's responsibilities and how they should behave. It doesn't directly address the power structures or gender expectations in family roles.

H: Women's Rights Therapy - This focuses on ensuring that women have the rights and opportunities they're entitled to, which includes participation in decision-making processes and gender roles. This seems directly related because Fara's situation is about women being responsible for their home while their brothers are responsible for yard work, which could be seen as a gendered approach to family responsibilities.

Putting it together, Feminist Object Relations (B) deals with how objects and objects of power are owned and used, which includes gendered access to resources. Fara's situation fits into this by highlighting how men and women are expected to do different kinds of work, which could be seen as object relations. So the correct answer would be B.

The correct answer is B: Feminist Object Relations. This option addresses the power dynamics and gendered expectations in Fara's situation, where men and women are expected to perform different roles in the family, reflecting object relations in societal structures.

Answer: B
