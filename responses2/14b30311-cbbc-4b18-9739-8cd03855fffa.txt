Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the value of y(τ) at τ=2.5. The signals are x(t) and v(t), each of which are rectangular pulses. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's write down the functions again to make sure I have them right. x(t) is 1 from t=0 to t=3, and 0 otherwise. So it's a rectangle that starts at 0 and ends at 3. On the other hand, v(t) is 1 from t=0 to t=2 and 0 elsewhere. So v(t) is a shorter rectangle.

The function y(τ) is given by an integral from negative infinity to infinity of x(τ - t) * v(t) dt. Wait, that looks like a convolution integral. Because convolution is when you have x(t) convolved with v(t), which is the integral of x(τ - t) v(t) dt. So y(τ) is x(t) convolved with v(t) evaluated at τ.

But wait, the question is asking for y(2.5), so I need to compute the convolution integral at τ=2.5.

But convolution is only non-zero when the two signals overlap. So I should probably sketch the functions to see where their supports (the intervals where they are non-zero) overlap.

Let's think: x(t) is 1 between 0 and 3, and v(t) is 1 between 0 and 2. So when you shift x(t) by τ=2.5, the interval for x(τ-t) becomes x(t') where t' = τ - (τ - t). Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the shifted function.

Wait, τ is 2.5, so the shifted x function is x(2.5 - t). Wait, no, because x(τ - t) is x(2.5 - t). So when t is varying, the argument is 2.5 - t. But I'm a bit confused about how this shifts. Let me think about it differently.

Convolution is commutative, so x(t) * v(t) is the same as v(t) * x(t). So perhaps it's easier to compute one convolution and see when the overlap occurs.

But maybe I should visualize the overlapping regions. So x(t) is 1 from 0 to 3, and v(t) is 1 from 0 to 2. So when we shift x(t) by τ=2.5, the interval becomes (τ - 3) to τ, because x(τ - t) is non-zero when τ - t is between 0 and 3. So solving for t: τ - t >=0 → t <= τ, and τ - t <=3 → t >= τ -3. So for τ=2.5, t ranges from 2.5 - 3= -0.5 to 2.5. So the x(τ - t) is non-zero from -0.5 to 2.5.

Meanwhile, v(t) is non-zero from 0 to 2. So the overlapping region is where both are non-zero. So let's find the intersection of [-0.5, 2.5] and [0,2]. The overlap is from 0 to 2.

So the integral will be from 0 to 2 of x(τ - t) * v(t) dt.

But wait, x(τ - t) is 1 in this overlapping t range. So for t between 0 and 2, x(τ-t)=1. And v(t) is 1 in that range as well.

So substituting, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 2 of 1 * 1 dt. So that's just the integral of 1 dt from 0 to 2, which is 2.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the limits. Because when τ is 2.5, the x(τ - t) part is non-zero when t is between (2.5-3) = -0.5 and 2.5 (since t can't be more than 2.5 in this case if τ is 2.5 and x is 3). So the x function's non-zero part starts at t=-0.5 and ends at t=2.5.

V(t) is non-zero from t=0 to 2. So the overlap is from t=0 to t=2. So the integral is over t from 0 to 2 of x(2.5 - t) * v(t) dt.

But since x(2.5 - t) is 1 when 2.5 - t is between 0 and 3. But when t is 0, 2.5 - t is 2.5, which is within x's range (0 to 3, but wait x(t) is 1 from 0 to3. Wait, no, x(t) is 1 from 0 to3, but the argument is (2.5 - t). So when t is 0, 2.5 -0 = 2.5, which is within x(t), so x(2.5) is 1. But when t is 2.5, 2.5 - t = 0, which is also part of x(t). Wait, but when t is in (0, 2.5), 2.5 - t is in (0,2.5). But x(2.5 -t) is 1 when 2.5 - t is between 0 and 3. So for t between 0 and 2.5, 2.5 -t is between 0 and 2.5, which is within x's domain, so x is 1. So x(2.5-t) is 1 for t between 0 and 2.5.

So the x(2.5 - t) is 1 for all t in [0, 2.5], but v(t) is 1 only up to t=2. So the product x(2.5 -t) * v(t) is 1 *1 from t=0 to t=2.5, but only up to v(t)'s limit. Beyond t=2, v(t) is 0, so beyond t=2, the product is 0.

So the integral is from t=0 to t=2 of 1*1 dt, which is 2.

Wait, but wait again. Because from t=0 to t=2, x(2.5-t) is 1, and v(t) is 1. So yes, their product is 1, and integrating that from 0 to 2 gives 2. So y(2.5) is 2.

Looking at the options, option C is 2. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, I could think using the formula for convolution, which is y(τ) = ∫ x(τ - t) v(t) dt from -infty to infty.

So substituting τ=2.5, which gives:

y(2.5) = ∫_{-infty}^{infty} x(2.5 - t) v(t) dt.

But x(2.5 - t) is non-zero when (2.5 - t) is between 0 and3.

So 0 ≤ 2.5 - t ≤3 → 2.5 -3 ≤ t ≤2.5.

So t is between -0.5 and 2.5.

But v(t) is non-zero only when t is between 0 and2.

So the product x(2.5-t)*v(t) is 1*1 from t=0 to t=2, and 0 elsewhere.

So the integral is from 0 to 2 of 1 dt, which is 2. So yes, y(2.5)=2.

So the correct option is C:2.

To determine \( y(\tau) \) at \( \tau = 2.5 \), we use the convolution formula:

\[
y(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau - t) v(t) \, dt
\]

### Step 1: Identify the functions and their supports
- \( x(t) \) is a rectangular pulse that is 1 from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 3 \), and 0 otherwise.
- \( v(t) \) is a rectangular pulse that is 1 from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 2 \), and 0 otherwise.

### Step 2: Shift and overlap
The function \( x(\tau - t) \) is a shifted version of \( x(t) \). For \( \tau = 2.5 \), the interval where \( x(\tau - t) \) is non-zero is:
\[
t \in [0.5, 2.5]
\]
Since \( v(t) \) is non-zero only from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 2 \), the overlap between the two is:
\[
t \in [0, 2]
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the convolution integral
Within the overlap interval \( t \in [0, 2] \), both \( x(\tau - t) \) and \( v(t) \) are 1. Thus, the integrand \( x(\tau - t) v(t) \) is 1 for all \( t \) in this interval. The integral becomes:
\[
y(2.5) = \int_{0}^{2} 1 \cdot 1 \, dt = \int_{0}^{2} dt = 2
\]

### Step 4: Verify the result
The final value of \( y(\tau) \) at \( \tau = 2.5 \) is 2.
