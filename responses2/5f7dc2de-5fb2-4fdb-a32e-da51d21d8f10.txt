Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again. The urn has four balls numbered 1 through 4. We're drawing them one at a time without replacement. A match occurs if the ball numbered m is the mth draw. So, for example, if I draw ball 1 first, that's a match. If I draw ball 2 second, that's a match, and so on.

The problem says to extend this to n balls. So, in the original case, n is 4. We need to find the limit of the probability that a match occurs on the ith draw as n increases without bound. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm. So, first, I need to understand what the events A_i represent. A_i is the event that a match occurs on the ith draw. So, for each i from 1 to n, A_i is the event that the ith draw is the ith ball.

I remember this is similar to the concept of derangements, where none of the objects are in their correct position. But in this case, we're looking for at least one match, or maybe exactly one? Wait, no, the question says "the event A_i denotes a match on the ith draw." So, it's about a match occurring on the ith draw, not necessarily that all A_i's happen or anything.

Wait, but actually, the way the problem is phrased, the event A_i is about a match on the ith draw. So, each A_i is a separate event. So, for n balls, there are n such events A_1 through A_n.

The question is about the probability of at least one match occurring, or maybe exactly one? Wait, the wording says "the event A_i denotes a match on the ith draw." So, perhaps it's the probability that at least one of these events occurs? Or is it each A_i is the event that the ith draw is the ith ball, regardless of previous draws.

Wait, no. The wording says "the event A_i is the ith draw." So, for each i, A_i is the event that the ith draw is the ith ball. So, for example, A_1 is that the first draw is ball 1, A_2 is that the second draw is ball 2, and so on.

So, the question is about the probability that any of these A_i's occur. So, the probability that at least one match happens in the sequence of draws. We need to find the limit of this probability as n approaches infinity.

Wait, but wait. The original question is about the limit as n increases without bound. So, when n is finite, the probability is non-zero, but as n becomes very large, what happens?

So, perhaps I should model this for finite n and then take the limit as n approaches infinity.

So, the problem is similar to the birthday problem, but with specific numbers. In the birthday problem, we find the probability that at least two people share a birthday. Here, we're looking for a match where the ith draw is the ith ball.

In the birthday problem, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is approximately 1 - e^{-n/365} for large n. But that's for two people. Here, we have n people (balls) and n draws. So, perhaps the probability that at least one match occurs is similar, but let's think.

Wait, another approach: For each A_i, the probability that A_i occurs is 1/n, since for the ith draw, the probability that the ith ball is the ith one is 1/n. Because each ball is equally likely to be in any position.

But these events are not independent, of course. Because if one A_i occurs, it affects the probability of another A_j. For example, if the first draw is ball 1, then the second draw can't be ball 2, so A_2 has probability (n-1)/(n-1) = 1, but wait, no. Wait, n is the number of balls. So, for A_2, after the first draw, there are n-1 balls left, one of which is ball 2. So, the probability that the second draw is ball 2 is 1/(n-1). So, the probability of A_2 is 1/(n-1), not 1/n.

So, the probability that A_i occurs is 1/(n - i + 1), because after the first i-1 draws, there are n - (i - 1) balls left, and one of them is the ith ball. Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, if we're considering A_i, which is the event that the ith draw is the ith ball. So, for any i, the probability that this happens is 1/(n - i + 1). Because, for the ith draw, there are n - (i - 1) balls left (since the first i-1 draws have been made), and exactly one of those is the ith ball. So, the probability is 1/(n - i + 1).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of permutations. The probability that A_i occurs is 1/(n - i + 1), but for each i.

But the problem is about the probability that at least one A_i occurs. So, the probability we're looking for is the union of all A_i's.

But to compute the probability of the union, we can use inclusion-exclusion. But that might get complicated for large n. Alternatively, maybe there's a known probability for such events.

Wait, but let's think about the expectation. The expected number of matches is the sum over i of P(A_i). Since each P(A_i) is 1/(n - i + 1).

So, the expected number E is sum_{i=1}^n [1/(n - i + 1)] = sum_{k=1}^n [1/k] = H_n, the nth harmonic number. H_n is approximately ln n + gamma, where gamma is Euler-Mascheroni constant, for large n.

But the expected number of matches is about ln n. So, as n becomes large, the expected number becomes large as well. But what about the probability? If the expected number is large, we might expect that the probability of at least one match is close to 1.

But wait, if the expected number is ln n, that doesn't directly say about the probability. However, for rare events, the probability of at least one occurrence can be approximated by the expectation when the events are rare. Wait, but in this case, the events are not rare when n is large, because H_n is about ln n, which is large.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the probability that no matches occur. Let's call this Q. Then, the probability of at least one match is 1 - Q.

So, Q is the probability that none of the A_i occur. So, for each i, the probability that A_i does not occur is 1 - 1/(n - i + 1) = (n - i)/(n - i + 1).

But these events are not independent, so inclusion-exclusion might be necessary, but that's complicated. Maybe an approximation can be made.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a permutation problem. Each permutation of the balls is equally likely. So, the probability that no match occurs is the number of derangements of n elements divided by n! (n factorial).

Wait, a derangement is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. In this case, each A_i corresponds to a fixed point in the permutation. So, the number of derangements is !n, and the probability that there are no matches is !n / n!.

But the limit as n approaches infinity of !n / n! is 1/e. Because the probability that a permutation has no fixed points approaches 1/e as n becomes large.

Wait, that makes sense because the expected number of fixed points is 1, and for large n, the distribution of the number of fixed points approximates a Poisson distribution with λ=1. So, the probability of zero fixed points is e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679, which is 1/e.

So, the probability that no matches occur approaches 1/e as n becomes large. Therefore, the probability that at least one match occurs approaches 1 - 1/e.

So, looking at the options, option A is 1 - 1/e. So, the limit is 1 - 1/e.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, if the probability that no matches occur is approaching 1/e, then the probability that at least one match occurs is 1 - 1/e. So, that's the answer.
</think>

The probability that no matches occur in a permutation of n elements approaches 1/e as n becomes large, so the probability of at least one match approaches 1 - 1/e. Therefore, the limit is 1 - 1/e.
