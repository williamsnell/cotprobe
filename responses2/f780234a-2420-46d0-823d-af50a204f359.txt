Question:

At a bus station, buses begin their routes at 6:00 a.m. The schedule for two of the buses is based on the time intervals listed below.
* Bus A has a long route and leavesthe station every 75 minutes.
* Bus has a short route and leaves the station every 15 minutes.
What is the next time Bus A and BusB will leave the bus station at the same time?

Options:

A: 7:00 a.m.
B: 9:00 a.m.
C: 7:15 a.m.
D: 9:30 a.m.
E: 7:30 a.m.
F: 8:15 a.m.
G: 7:45 a.m.
H: 8:00 a.m.
I: 8:30 a.m.
J: 6:45 a.m.

Okay, so I need to find out when Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time again. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that Bus A leaves every 75 minutes and Bus B every 15 minutes. Since Bus B leaves more frequently, I think the next time they coincide would be the least common multiple (LCM) of their departure intervals. That makes sense because the LCM gives the smallest time interval where both events happen together.

So, what's the LCM of 15 and 75? Let's break it down. The factors of 15 are 3 and 5, so 15 = 3 * 5. The factors of 75 are 5 * 5 * 3. The LCM would take the highest powers of all prime factors involved. So, that's 3 * 5 * 5 = 75. So, the LCM is 75 minutes. That means every 75 minutes after their initial departure, they'll leave at the same time.

Now, the initial time given is 6:00 a.m. Both buses leave at least once every day. So, the next time they coincide would be 75 minutes after 6:00 a.m. Let me calculate that. 75 minutes is 1 hour and 15 minutes. Adding that to 6:00 a.m. gives me 7:15 a.m. So, the next time they meet would be at 7:15 a.m.

Let me double-check. Bus A leaves at 6:00, 7:45, 9:30, etc. Bus B leaves at 6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, 7:45, etc. So yes, the first common time after 6:00 is 7:15 a.m. That's option C.

The next time Bus A and Bus B will leave the station simultaneously is at 7:15 a.m.

Answer: C
