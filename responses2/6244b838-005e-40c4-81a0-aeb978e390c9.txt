Hmm, okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about a spring-block oscillator. I remember that in such systems, the block moves back and forth on a spring, and its motion is periodic. The question is about the maximum speed of the block and how it relates to the amplitude.

Let me think about the basics. In a simple harmonic oscillator, like a mass on a spring, the speed of the block depends on how far it is from the equilibrium position. When it's at the maximum displacement (the amplitude), the speed is zero because it's about to change direction. At the equilibrium point, it's moving the fastest.

So, the speed probably depends on the amplitude. I remember that the speed v can be derived from the system's energy. The potential energy at maximum displacement is all stored as potential, and when it's at equilibrium, all that potential becomes kinetic energy. So, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude.

The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², so equating the two gives me (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA². Solving for v, I get v = sqrt( (k/m) * A² ). Wait, that simplifies to v = A * sqrt(k/m). Oh, right, so the speed is directly proportional to the amplitude. Because if the amplitude increases, the speed increases, and vice versa, assuming mass and spring constant are constant.

So the maximum speed is proportional to the amplitude. Looking at the options, option C says 'proportional to amplitude'. That must be the correct answer.

Let me double-check the options. The question is about the maximum speed, and the options are about how speed varies with amplitude. So if speed is proportional to amplitude, option C is correct. The other options don't fit: option B says 'not related', which isn't true. Option D is inversely proportional, which would be if speed decreases as A increases, which isn't the case here. So yes, option C is correct.

The maximum speed of a block in a spring-block oscillator is proportional to the amplitude of the motion. This is because the speed depends on how far the block is from the equilibrium position, and at maximum displacement (amplitude), the speed is zero. As the block moves through the equilibrium point, its speed reaches its maximum. Using energy conservation, the speed is given by \( v = A \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), where \( A \) is the amplitude. This shows that the speed is directly proportional to \( A \).

The correct answer is:

**C: proportional to amplitude**
