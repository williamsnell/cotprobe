Question:

Ultra Co. uses a periodic inventory system. The following are inventory transactions for the month of January: 1/1 Beginning inventory 20000 units at $13 1/20 Purchase 30000 units at $15 1/23 Purchase 40000 units at $17 1/31 Sales at $20 per unit 50000 units Ultra uses the LIFO method to determine the value of its inventory. What amount should Ultra report as cost of goods sold on its income statement for the month of January?

Okay, so I've got this question about Ultra Co. using a periodic inventory system and LIFO for cost of goods sold. Hmm, let's see. I remember that periodic systems only count inventory at the end of the period, whereas FIFO and LIFO are part of the perpetual system. But wait, okay, I'll try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that Ultra starts with 20,000 units at $13 each. Then there's a purchase of 30,000 units at $15 each on January 20. Another purchase of 40,000 units at $17 on January 23. Then, sales of 50,000 units at $20 each. We need to find the cost of goods sold using LIFO.

Wait, LIFO is the last-in, first-out method. So, when calculating COGS, we assume that the most recently purchased items are sold first. Or wait, no, wait. No, when computing COGS, the COGS is based on the cost of the goods sold. So, if we're using LIFO, the COGS would be the cost of the most recent purchases, right? Or wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

In a periodic system, we don't track inventory at the end, but the LIFO method would have to consider which units are sold first. Since the company uses the LIFO method, the COGS would be the cost of the last purchases. But wait, the data is given in terms of units and costs, so we have to figure out which units are sold when.

Let me list the data:

- Beginning inventory: 20,000 units @ $13.
- Jan 20: purchase 30,000 @ $15.
- Jan 23: purchase 40,000 @ $17.
- Jan 31: sold 50,000 units @ $20 each.

Now, the sales are 50,000 units. So, let's figure out which units were sold. Since we're using LIFO, the most recent purchases are sold first. So, the last purchase is Jan 23's 40,000 units at $17. But we only sold 50,000 units. So, from the 40,000, all are sold. Then, the remaining 10,000 must come from the previous purchase, which is Jan 20's 30,000 at $15. Wait, no, wait—wait, the 30,000 is from Jan 20 (15), and the beginning was 20,000 at 13. So, the sales would be 40,000 (from Jan 23) + 10,000 (from Jan 20). So, the 10,000 comes from the beginning inventory? Or is there a misunderstanding.

Wait, wait. Let me recount the transactions:

- 20,000 units at $13.
- Then, 30,000 at 15.
- Then, 40,000 at 17.

Then, total units available: 20+30+40=90,000.

Wait, no, initial 20,000, then 30,000, and 40,000. So total is 90,000 units.

Wait, but the sales are 50,000 units. So, how's that possible? Because 50,000 comes from the last two purchases.

Wait, 40,000 (Jan 23) and 10,000 from the beginning (Jan 1). So, the 10,000 would come from the beginning inventory. So, the cost of goods sold is (40,000 * 17) + (10,000 * 13).

Wait, let me compute that. 40,000 * $17 is 680,000. 10,000 * $13 is 130,000. So total COGS is 680,000 + 130,000 = 810,000.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is $810,000. So that's one of the choices. But wait, wait, another point. Let me double-check the LIFO method. Because under LIFO, the most recent purchases are sold first. So the 40,000 at 17 is sold first, then the 10,000 from the beginning.

Wait, but wait, the beginning inventory is 20,000 at 13. So, 20,000 units from 13, and 30,000 from 15. So, the 40,000 from 17 is all from Jan 23. Then, the 10,000 would have to be from the 20,000 beginning. So yes, 10,000 * 13 is 130,000.

Wait, but let me think again. The sales are 50,000 units. So, 40,000 are from 23rd purchase, 10,000 from 1st. So, the COGS is 40,000 *17 + 10,000 *13 = 680,000 + 130,000 = 810,000.

But wait, another thought. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's consider the flow of inventory.

After the purchase on 23rd, the 40,000 units are part of the inventory. Then, on 31st, they sell 50,000 units. So, the 40,000 are sold first, and the remaining 10,000 are from the beginning.

So, yes, that would be 40,000 *17 and 10,000 *13.

So the COGS is 810,000. Looking at the options, option A is $810,000.

Wait, but another angle: are there any other factors? Like, is the beginning inventory considered part of the current period's inventory? Because in periodic systems, the beginning inventory is recorded at the start of the period. So, when calculating the cost of goods sold, it's the cost of all units sold, regardless of when they were purchased.

Wait, another thing: in periodic systems, the inventory is not updated at the end of the period; it's a snapshot. So, when calculating COGS, you have to account for all the units that were sold during the month.

But in this case, the only purchases are during the month. So, yes, the 40,000 from Jan 23 and 10,000 from the beginning.

Wait, but wait, could the beginning inventory be considered as part of the inventory before the purchase on Jan 20, so that when you compute the ending inventory, you have to subtract the total sold from the sum. But in this problem, the question is only about COGS, not about ending inventory. So, the COGS is correctly computed as 810,000.

So the answer should be option A: $810,000.

To determine the cost of goods sold (COGS) using the LIFO method for Ultra Co., we analyze the inventory transactions as follows:

1. **Beginning Inventory**: 20,000 units at $13 each.
2. **Purchases**:
   - January 20: 30,000 units at $15 each.
   - January 23: 40,000 units at $17 each.
3. **Sales**: 50,000 units at $20 each.

Under the LIFO method, the most recently purchased units are sold first. Therefore, the 50,000 units sold consist of:
- **40,000 units** from the January 23 purchase at $17 each.
- **10,000 units** from the beginning inventory at $13 each.

The cost of goods sold (COGS) is calculated as:
- (40,000 units × $17) + (10,000 units × $13) = $680,000 + $130,000 = $810,000.

Thus, the amount Ultra Co. should report as cost of goods sold is **$810,000**.
