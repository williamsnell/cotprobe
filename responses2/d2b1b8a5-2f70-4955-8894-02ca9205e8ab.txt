Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement is false. The options are labeled A through G. Let me take each one step by step.

Starting with option A: 5 > 3. Well, 5 is indeed greater than 3, so this is a true statement. So A is not the false one.

Next is option B: 10 < 20. Hmm, 10 is less than 20. That's correct, so B is also true. Not the one.

Option C: −3 > −5. Hmm, negative numbers can be tricky. When comparing negatives, the one with the smaller absolute value is actually larger. So -3 is greater than -5 because 3 is less than 5 in absolute terms. So C is true. Not the false choice.

Option D: 3 < 5. Yep, 3 is definitely less than 5. So D is true, not false.

Option E: −10 < −5. Wait a second. Negative numbers again. -10 is less than -5 because it's further to the left on the number line. So yes, -10 is less than -5. So E is true, not false.

Option F: 0 > -1. Zero is definitely greater than -1. So F is true.

Finally, option G: −5 > −3. Wait, no. -5 is not greater than -3. Because -3 is to the right of -5 on the number line, so -3 is greater. So -5 is less than -3. So G is a false statement.

So the false statement is option G.

The false statement is option G, as -5 is not greater than -3. 

Answer: G
