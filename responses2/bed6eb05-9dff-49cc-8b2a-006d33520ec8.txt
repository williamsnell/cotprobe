Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about Mr. Winter's insurance and what happens during a riot. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, he has a $50-deductible collision insurance, but no comprehensive coverage. The damage was $346.50. The question is, how much does the insurance company pay him? The options are A to J.

Hmm, I remember that insurance deductions apply when the damage exceeds the deductible. Wait, but if there's no comprehensive coverage, does that change anything? Oh right, I think without comprehensive coverage, the insurance company might not cover the damage at all because they can't claim for it. Let me think again.

So, collision insurance typically covers damages up to the deductible. The deductible is $50 here. So, if the damages are $346.50, which is way over $50, then the insurance company would pay the excess.

Wait, wait. But if there's no comprehensive coverage, that means they can't cover the damage beyond the deductible on their own. So the insurance company would have to pay the full amount because they can't claim for the excess. Because without comprehensive coverage, the insurance doesn't cover the damage unless it's covered by collision or other insurance.

Wait, but wait again. So, in this case, the insurance is only collision, no coverage for damage beyond the deductible. So, if the damage is $346.50, and the deductible is $50, then the insurance would only pay $50 towards the damage. But wait, no, wait. No, that's not correct. Because the insurance company covers the loss up to the deductible, but if the damage is more than the deductible, the excess is not covered by the insurance. So, the insurance company would only pay the deductible, which is $50.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me look at the options. Option B is $50. So that might be the answer. But wait, another thought: sometimes, if the insurance has a $50 deductible, and the damage is $346.50, then the insurance would pay $50 towards the damage. But wait, in cases where the insurance isn't the only one covering the damage, sometimes the insurance covers up to the limit, but in this case, without comprehensive coverage, the insurance can't cover any additional damage. So the insurance company would only pay the deductible, but that doesn't align with the options. Wait, the options don't have $50 as the amount the insurance company pays; option B is $50. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Wait, in this scenario, the insurance is only for collision. So, if the damage is $346.50, and the insurance only covers up to $50, then the insurance company would pay $50 towards the damage. But that doesn't make sense because that's not how insurance typically works. Typically, the insurance company would pay the amount up to the deductible, or the total if the damage is covered by other insurance. But if there's no comprehensive coverage, the insurance only covers the deductible. So, the excess would not be covered by the insurance. So, the insurance would only pay $50. But the options don't have $50 as the amount the insurance covers; option B is $50, but that's what the company would pay. Wait, but wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the insurance is considered to cover the entire damage. But that's not correct because the insurance only covers up to the deductible. So, if the damage is more than $50, the insurance covers $50, and the rest is out of their insurance. So, the insurance would only pay $50. But that's not an option. Looking back, the options are:

A: $296.50
B: $50
C: Two-thirds
D: $150
E: Not pay him
F: $200
G: $346.50
H: $246.50
I: Full coverage
J: Half

Wait, so the correct amount the insurance company would pay is $50, which is option B. But I'm not sure if that's right. Alternatively, sometimes, if the damage is more than the deductible, the insurance company may pay the entire amount, but that's only if they are the only party. But without coverage beyond the deductible, I think the insurance company would only pay the deductible. So the correct answer would be $50, which is option B.

Wait, wait another thought. Maybe the insurance is considered to cover the full damage. That would mean the insurance company pays $346.50, but that's not correct because the insurance only covers up to the deductible. So, the excess is not covered. So the insurance company would pay $50, making the correct answer option B.

The correct answer is **B: $50**. Mr. Winter's insurance covers up to a $50 deductible, so the insurance company would pay $50 toward the $346.50 damage. 

Answer: B
