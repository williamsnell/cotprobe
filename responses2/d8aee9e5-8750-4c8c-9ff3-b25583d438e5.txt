Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a barge being loaded with ore and sinking. I remember that when an object is submerged, it displaces a certain amount of water equal to its weight. So maybe I need to calculate the volume of the barge and how much water is displaced when the barge sinks.

The barge's mass is 15,000 kg. Its density is given as 7500 kg/m³. Oh wait, I should convert that to grams per cm³ because the ore's density is in grams per cm³. Let me recall the conversion: 1 kg is 1000 grams, and 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, which is 1e6 cm³. So 7500 kg/m³ is (7500 * 1000) g / (1e6 cm³) = 7.5 g/cm³. Got it.

The dock's surface area is 6633 m². Hmm, that's a huge area. The barge is loaded with ore that's 3 g/cm³. So when 80,000 kg of ore is aboard, the barge sinks. I'm supposed to find out how the water level in the dock changes.

Wait, when the barge sinks, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own weight. But wait, no, that's for floating objects. Oh wait, no. If the barge is made of a denser material, some of it will sink. So the water level may rise or fall depending on whether the barge floats or sinks.

Wait, but the problem says the barge sinks when ore is aboard. So that means the total weight of the barge plus ore is greater than the water it displaces, so it displaces more water than its weight. Wait, but when it sinks, the water displaced would be equal to the weight of the total mass. Hmm, perhaps the barge's own weight plus the loaded ore's weight displaces water, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the barge is made of a dense metal, so its density is higher than water. So when loaded, it might sink. But in this case, when 80,000 kg of ore is aboard, it sinks. So the combined mass (barge + ore) is heavier than the water it displaces. Wait, no. When a floating object displaces its own weight in water, it floats. If an object's density is less than water, it floats. If more, it sinks. So if the barge is made of a density higher than water, it will sink when loaded.

Wait, but the barge's density is 7500 kg/m³, and water's density is approximately 1000 kg/m³. So the barge is denser than water, so it will sink. So when it's loaded, it displaces a volume of water equal to its total mass.

Wait, no. Wait, for floating objects, the displaced water's mass equals the object's mass. For sinking objects, the displaced water's mass equals the object's mass. Because when the object is denser than water, it's more than displacing its own mass. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

An object floats when its average density is less than water. So a sinking object has average density greater than water. So in that case, when it's submerged, the water displaced equals its own mass. But that's only when it's fully submerged. But in reality, when an object sinks, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own mass divided by its density. So the water level would rise by an amount equal to the mass of the object divided by the area of the dock and the density of water.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The volume of water displaced is equal to the mass of the object divided by the density of water. Because F = m * g, and the weight of the displaced water must equal the weight of the object. So:

Object's mass = m = (density_object) * V_object.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of buoyancy. When the object floats, the buoyant force equals the object's weight. The buoyant force is the weight of the displaced water. So for floating, m_object * g = (density_water * V_displaced) * g. So V_displaced = m_object / density_water.

But when the object sinks, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own mass divided by the density of water. Because the weight of the displaced water must equal the weight of the object. So:

m_object * g = (density_water * V_displaced) * g → V_displaced = m_object / density_water.

But wait, that's only if the object is submerged until it sinks. But when the object is denser than water, it's fully submerged when it sinks. So the displaced water's volume is equal to the object's volume. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps when the object sinks, the water displaced is equal to the object's mass divided by the density of water. Because the weight of the displaced water is equal to the weight of the object. So:

m_object = (density_water) * V_displaced → V_displaced = m_object / density_water.

But wait, no. Wait, the mass of the object is m, and density_water is ρ_water. So:

m = ρ_water * V_displaced → V_displaced = m / ρ_water.

But then, V_displaced is the volume of water displaced. That volume would cause the water level in the dock to rise if the dock's surface area is large enough. Because the water level rise (h) is given by V = A * h, where A is the area. So h = V / A.

So, in this case, the volume displaced V is (15000 kg + 80000 kg) / 1000 kg/m³. Because the total mass is 15000 + 80000 = 95000 kg. Or wait, no. Wait, the barge's mass is 15000 kg, and the ore is 80000 kg. So total mass is 95000 kg. So V = (95000 kg) / (1000 kg/m³) = 95 m³.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the barge is made of metal. So when loaded with ore, the total mass is 15000 + 80000 = 95000 kg. So yes, V = 95000 / 1000 = 95 m³.

But the area of the dock is 6633 m². So the rise in water level is h = V / A. So h = 95 m³ / 6633 m².

Wait, 95 divided by 6633. Let me calculate that. 95/6633 is approximately equal to 0.01433 meters. Because 6633 * 0.014 is about 92.8, and a bit more. Let's see, 6633 * 0.0143 is 95. So 0.0143 meters is 1.43 cm. But that's if the barge were to displace more water than its own volume. But wait, the question is about when the barge sinks. Oh, wait, but the problem says the barge sinks. So maybe the initial calculation is correct.

But wait, another approach: maybe the barge is floating when loaded with ore. Because the total mass is 95000 kg, and the area is 6633 m². So the water level would rise if the barge floats. But the question says it sinks, so in that case, perhaps the entire mass is displacing water, leading to a rise in water level.

Wait, but when a floating object is loaded with ore, it might not necessarily sink completely. Maybe it floats partially submerged. But if the problem states the barge sinks, perhaps it's because the ore is so heavy that the barge's average density is higher than the ore's. Let me think: the original density of the barge is 7500 kg/m³, which is 7.5 g/cm³. The ore is 3 g/cm³. So the average density of the loaded barge would be (15000 + 80000) / 6633. Let me calculate that.

Wait, no. Wait, the barge's mass is 15000 kg, and the ore is 80000 kg. So total mass is 95000 kg. The barge's volume is (15000 kg) / (7500 kg/m³) = 2 m³. Because density = mass/volume → volume = mass/density.

So the barge's volume is 15000 / 7500 = 2 m³.

The loaded volume is 2 m³ + (80000 kg) / 3 g/cm³ → wait, but I'm not sure about the units. Let me convert the ore's density to kg/m³.

3 g/cm³ = 3000 kg/m³.

So the loaded mass is 95000 kg. The volume of the ore is 95000 kg / 3000 kg/m³ = 31.666... m³.

So the total volume is 2 + 31.666 = 33.666 m³. 

When the barge is loaded, it's now submerged up to a certain height. Since the density of the ore is less than the barge's, the barge will float, displacing water equal to its own mass. But this might not be the case here because the problem states the barge sinks. Hmm, maybe I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the question's approach is to calculate the rise in water level due to the additional mass. Because the barge sinks, the water level would rise based on the added mass.

So, the additional mass is 80000 kg. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³. So the volume of water displaced is 80000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 80 m³.

Wait, but the area of the dock is 6633 m². The rise in water level would be V / A = 80 m³ / 6633 m² → approx 0.012 m, which is 1.2 cm. But that's not any of the options. The options are 3.5, 2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.5, 3, 1, 0.5, 0.8 cm, etc. So 1.2 cm is close to option F: 1.5 cm. But maybe I'm missing something in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the barge as being fully submerged, not just sinking. Because if the barge is made of a dense metal, loading it with ore would cause it to sink. But when it sinks, the water level would rise as if it were floating, but it's not. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the barge is floating, but the question says it sinks. Hmm. Alternative approach: maybe the problem is that the barge sinks, so the water level rises. But the problem says when 80,000 kg are aboard, it sinks. So perhaps the total mass is heavier than the barge's own mass. So when loaded, the barge's total mass is 15000 + 80000 = 95000 kg, which is more than the barge's own mass. So then, the barge would sink, and the water level would rise.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rise would be 80 m³ / 6633 m² ≈ 0.012 m → 1.2 cm. But the options don't have 1.2. The closest is B:2 cm. Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the rise as if the barge were floating, but then it's given that it sinks, which makes me think perhaps that the calculation is different.

Wait, another thought: the barge is made of metal, so its density is higher than water. So when loaded with ore, it's denser than water, so it sinks. So the water level rise would be based on the mass of the loaded ore, divided by the area and density of water. So 80000 kg is the mass, divided by 1000 kg/m³, gives 80 m³. Divide by 6633 m² → 80 / 6633 = approximately 0.0121 m → 1.21 cm. So that's about 1.2 cm, which is close to option F (1.5 cm), but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the barge's own volume (2 m³) plus the added ore's volume (31.666 m³) is the total volume displaced when it sinks. So total volume is 2 + 31.666 = 33.666 m³. So the water level rise is 33.666 m³ / 6633 m² → h = 33.666 / 6633. Let's compute that: 33.666 / 6633 ≈ 0.00509 m → 0.509 cm, which is about 0.5 cm. That's option G (3 cm) is too large. So that's 0.5 cm. So option G is 3 cm, which is higher than this.

Wait, but the problem says the barge sinks, which would imply that it's fully submerged. So the total volume displaced is the sum of the barge's volume and the ore's volume. So the rise in water level would be (2 + 31.666) / 6633 → approximately 33.666 / 6633 → about 0.00509 m, which is 0.509 cm, ~0.5 cm. So that's option G: 3 cm? Wait, no, 0.5 cm is option G (since 0.5 is the value). Wait, the options are:

A:3.5, B:2, C:0.2, D:2.5, E:0.8, F:1.5, G:3, H:1, I:0.5, J:4.

Wait, option G is 3 cm, which is larger than 0.5 cm. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me compute the volume of the loaded barge. The barge's density is 7500 kg/m³, mass 15000 kg. So its volume is 15000 / 7500 = 2 m³.

The ore's mass is 80000 kg, density 3 g/cm³ = 3000 kg/m³. So the volume is 80000 / 3000 = 26.666... m³.

So the total volume of the loaded barge is 2 + 26.666 = 28.666 m³.

The area of the dock is 6633 m². So the rise in water level is (28.666) / (6633) = approximately 0.00433 m → 0.433 cm. So about 0.43 cm. Hmm, that's close to option H (1 cm). But none of the options are that low.

Wait, but wait, the question says the barge sinks. So perhaps the water level isn't determined by the displaced volume because the barge is sinking, but the calculation is based on the displacement when loaded.

Alternatively, perhaps the barge's own volume plus the ore's volume is the volume of water displaced. So that's 28.666 m³. So h = 28.666 / 6633 → 0.00433 m → 0.433 cm, which is approximately 0.4 cm. The closest option is H:1 cm, which is higher. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The average density of the loaded barge would be (15000 +80000) / (6633) = 95000 kg / 6633 m²? No, density is mass/volume. Wait, the total mass is 95000 kg, and the total volume is 2 + 31.666 = 33.666 m³. So the average density of the loaded barge is 95000 / 33.666 ≈ 2826 kg/m³. Since the water density is 1000 kg/m³, the average density is higher than water, so the barge will sink. So the water level rise is the mass of the loaded barge divided by the area and the water density. Or perhaps it's the displaced volume.

Wait, the displacement when the barge is loaded is the mass of the loaded barge divided by the water density. So V = (15000+80000) kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 95 m³. So h = 95 m³ / 6633 m² → 0.01433 m → 1.433 cm. So approximately 1.4 cm. Looking back at the options, option G is 3 cm, which is higher. Option H is 1 cm, which is lower. So this gives us around 1.4 cm, which is closer to option H (1 cm) than option G (3 cm). Or perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, 95 m³ is the displaced volume. Divided by 6633 m² is 0.01433 meters, which is 1.433 cm. So the water level rises by about 1.4 cm. That's closer to option H (1 cm) than option G (3 cm). But none of the options is 1.4 cm. But perhaps the calculation isn't as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the barge's weight is 15000 kg, and the ore is 80000 kg. So when loaded, the total weight is 95000 kg. The water displaced would be equal to the weight of the loaded barge divided by the water density. So 95000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 95 m³. So the rise in water level is 95 m³ / 6633 m² = 0.01433 m → 1.433 cm. So that's about 1.4 cm. But the options don't have 1.4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's approach.

Wait, another approach: the total mass is 95000 kg. The area of the dock is 6633 m². So the rise in water level is the mass of the loaded barge divided by the area and the water density. So h = (95000 kg) / (6633 m² × 1000 kg/m³) ) → h = 95000 / (6633 * 1000) → 95000 / 6633000 → 0.01433 m → 1.433 cm. So that's about 1.4 cm, which is near option H (1 cm). So the answer might be H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check the calculation again. 95000 kg / (1000 kg/m³ * 6633 m²) → 95000 / (6633 * 1000) → 95000 / 6633000 → Let's compute this:

6633000 ÷ 95000 → 6633000 / 95000 = (6633000 ÷ 1000) / (95000 ÷ 1000) → 66330 / 95 → 66330 ÷ 95 = let's see, 95 × 700 = 66500 → which is just a bit higher than 66330. So 700 × 95 = 66500, which is 170 more than 66330. So 700 - (170/95) → 700 - 1.789 → approx 698.21. So 66330 /95 ≈ 698.21. So 95000 / 6633000 → 1 / 69.821 ≈ 0.01432 → 1.432 cm. So yes, 1.43 cm, which is approximately 1.4 cm.

So the closest option is H:1 cm. But wait, 1 cm is 0.1 meters, and my calculation is 0.0143 meters, which is 0.143 cm. So about 0.14 cm. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rise in water level as the mass of the loaded barge divided by the area and the water density. Because when the barge sinks, the displaced water is equal to the mass of the barge. So h = (15000 + 80000) kg / (1000 kg/m³ * 6633 m²) → same calculation as before, giving 1.43 cm.

But the options don't have 1.4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total mass of the loaded barge and ore, and the area of the dock, so the rise is h = (15000 +80000) kg / (1000 kg/m³ * 6633 m²) → same as above. So 1.43 cm. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another way. Let's think in terms of the specific gravity of the loaded barge.

The barge's density is 7500 kg/m³. The ore's density is 3 g/cm³ = 3000 kg/m³. So the loaded barge's specific gravity is (15000 + 80000) / 15000 = 95000 / 15000 = 6.333. That's way higher than water, so it will sink.

So the rise in water level is given by the mass of the loaded barge divided by the area and the water density. So h = (15000 +80000) kg / (1000 kg/m³ * 6633 m²) → same as before, 1.43 cm. So the answer is 1.4 cm, which is closest to option H:1 cm. But wait, 1 cm is 0.1 meters, not 0.014 meters. So 1.4 cm is 0.014 meters. So no, it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rise in water level based only on the added mass of the ore, not the entire barge's mass. So h = (80000 kg) / (1000 kg/m³ * 6633 m²) → 80000 / 6633000 → 0.0121 m → 1.21 cm. So that's approximately 1.2 cm. Looking at the options, that's closest to option H (1 cm) and option F (1.5 cm). But 1.2 cm is closer to 1 cm than to 1.5 cm.

Wait, but the options are given as F:1.5 cm, H:1 cm. So perhaps 1.2 cm is closer to 1 cm. So the answer would be H:1 cm.

But earlier I thought that the rise was about 1.4 cm. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the rise in water level.

The mass of the loaded barge is 95000 kg. The water displaced would be equal to this mass because the barge sinks. So the rise in water level is volume divided by area.

Volume is 95000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 95 m³.

Area is 6633 m².

So h = 95 m³ / 6633 m² → 95 / 6633 → 0.01433 m → 1.433 cm.

So that's about 1.4 cm. So looking at the options, the closest is H:1 cm. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the barge is made of metal, so when loaded with ore, it would sink. The amount of water displaced would be equal to the mass of the loaded barge. So the rise in water level would be the mass divided by the area and the water density.

Wait, so h = mass / (area × density) → 95000 kg / (6633 m² × 1000 kg/m³) → 95000 / 6633000 → 0.01433 m → 1.433 cm.

So that's about 1.4 cm, which is approximately 1.4 cm. But the options don't have this. The closest is H:1 cm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the water level rise as the total mass divided by the area and the water density, but in a way that doesn't account for the mass of the barge. So perhaps the calculation is (80000 kg) / (6633 m² × 1000 kg/m³) → 80000 / 6633000 → 0.0121 m → 1.21 cm. So that's closer to 1 cm.

So perhaps the answer is H:1 cm. But wait, the problem says the barge sinks, so perhaps the calculation is based on the rise due to the additional mass of the ore. So the water level would rise by 1.2 cm, which is approximately 1 cm. So the correct answer is H.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the water level rise as the mass of the loaded barge divided by the area and the water density, but without considering the barge's own volume. So perhaps the calculation is (95000 kg) / (6633 m² × 1000 kg/m³) → same as before, which is 0.01433 m → 1.43 cm. So again, same result.

Hmm, perhaps some of the options are incorrect, but based on the calculations, the rise would be approximately 1.4 cm, so the closest option is H:1 cm.
</think>

To determine how the water level rises when the barge sinks, we calculate the rise based on the mass of the loaded barge and the area of the dock. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³. 

The mass of the loaded barge is 95,000 kg. The area of the dock is 6,633 m². The rise in water level is given by:

\[
h = \frac{\text{Mass of loaded barge}}{\text{Area of dock} \times \text{Density of water}} = \frac{95,000 \, \text{kg}}{6,633 \, \text{m}^2 \times 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3} = \frac{95,000}{6,633,000} \, \text{m} \approx 0.01433 \, \text{m} \approx 1.433 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The closest option to this calculation is **H: 1 cm**.

ANSWER: H
