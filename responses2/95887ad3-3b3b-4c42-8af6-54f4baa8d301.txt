Question:

A female psychologist provides a 2-month course of brief behavior therapy for a driving phobia to a male client. Six months after termination they meet at an art opening reception and begin to date. Over the next few months, the relationship progresses and they become sexual. In this situation, the psychologist has acted:

Options:

A: Ethically, as long as she does not provide therapy to the client again in the future
B: Ethically, because she waited an appropriate amount of time after termination before starting a relationship
C: Ethically because it had been 6 months since termination
D: Ethically, because the client initiated the relationship
E: Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment
F: Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances
G: Probably ethically since there was no coercion involved and the relationship was consensual
H: Unethically, because she should have referred the client to another psychologist before starting a relationship

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about behavior therapy and ethics. Let me read it again carefully.

The scenario is a female psychologist providing a 2-month course of brief behavior therapy to a male client. So, that's about 60 days, right? Then, after termination, they meet at an art opening reception and begin to date. The next few months, they become sexual. The question is about whether the psychologist acted ethically in this situation.

The options are A to H. I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, so what do I know about ethical behavior in relationships? Well, I remember that there are some ethical guidelines about how individuals should behave in relationships. For example, some suggest that one shouldn't initiate a sexual relationship with someone they've been around for a long time, especially if they've had similar experiences before. It's probably not okay to have a sexual relationship with a past client.

I think the main ethical dilemma here is the consent and consent for sexual activity. The client was terminated, which means they might have had some experiences or relationships that were important. If the client started a sexual relationship with the psychologist, that could be seen as involving a past client, which might not be allowed.

Let me look at the options again. Option F says it's unethically because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client. That sounds like it's based on the idea that the client shouldn't have been in a relationship with someone they've been around for a long time. That's a common ethical principle.

Option G says it's probably ethically because there was no coercion and it was consensual. But wait, coercion can be tricky, but in this case, the client might have had previous experiences. So, even if the interaction wasn't coercion, the fact that it was consensual might not be enough. Plus, some consider consensual to include past relationships.

Option E says it's unethically according to professional standards but the psychologist did poor judgment. That might be more about professional standards rather than ethics. But I think ethics should take into account professional judgment, so E might not be the right choice.

Option B and A are about waiting time and ethics. But the issue here is about the ethical implications, not the timing of starting the relationship.

So the key here is the ethical consideration of a client's past relationships. The psychologist should avoid any sexual activity involving someone they've had previous encounters with, unless it's part of a consensual arrangement. But in this case, the client was terminated, probably after a long time, and started a relationship, which might be against ethical guidelines.

Option F seems to fit best. It's unethically because of the past client. So the psychologist acted unethically.

The correct answer is F: **Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances.**

**Explanation:**
The scenario involves a female psychologist starting a sexual relationship with a client who had been terminated through brief behavior therapy. This is prohibited under ethical guidelines as it involves a past client. Option F accurately reflects this ethical consideration, making it the correct choice.
