Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the reaction between baking powder and some other components, and I need to find out how much CO₂ gas is produced when 4.2 grams of NaHCO₃ (baking powder) is used. The reaction given is:

NaHCO₃ + KHC₄H₆O₆ → NaKC₄H₄O₆ + H₂O + CO₂(g)

Wait, but wait. The product here is CO₂, so that's the gas produced. Since it's a gas, I might need to consider the ideal gas law for calculations. The problem is asking for the volume of CO₂ liberated at 273°C, which is 0°C, because 273 K is 0°C.

First, I should figure out how many moles of NaHCO₃ are present in 4.2 grams. The molar mass of NaHCO₃ is important here. Na is about 23, H is 1, C is 12, O is 16. So the calculation would be:

NaHCO3: Na (23) + H (1) + 2(C) (24) + 3(O) (48) = 23 +1 +24 +48 = 96 g/mol.

So, moles of NaHCO3 = mass / molar mass = 4.2 g / 96 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 4.2 divided by 96. Let me compute that: 96 goes into 4.2 about 0.04375 moles. Because 96 * 0.04375 = 4.2 (since 96 * 0.04 = 3.84, and 96 * 0.00375 is 0.36, adding up to 4.2).

So, n = 0.04375 moles of NaHCO3.

Looking at the reaction, each mole of NaHCO3 produces one mole of CO2. So the moles of CO2 will be the same as the moles of NaHCO3, which is 0.04375 moles.

Now, to find the volume of CO₂ at 273 K and 1 atm pressure. Since it's a gas, I can use the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

R is the gas constant, but I need to choose the right units. Since the volume is in liters, pressure is in atm, and temperature is in Kelvin, I'll use R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So, rearranging the formula to solve for volume: V = nRT/P.

Here, n is 0.04375 mol, R is 0.0821, T is 273 K, P is 1 atm.

Plug in the numbers: V = (0.04375 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (273 K) / 1 atm.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.04375 * 0.0821 = let's see. Let me compute 0.04 * 0.0821 = 0.003284, and 0.00375 * 0.0821 = 0.000308. Adding those: 0.003284 + 0.000308 ≈ 0.003592.

Wait, wait, that's not quite right. Because 0.04375 is 0.04 + 0.00375. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 0.04375 * 0.0821.

Let me compute it as 43.75 * 10^-3 * 82.1 *10^-3.

Wait, maybe another approach. 0.04375 * 0.0821 = ?

Well, 0.04375 is 43.75/1000, and 0.0821 is 82.1/1000. So 43.75 *82.1 = ?

Hmm, compute 43 *82 = 3526, but more accurately:

43.75 * 82.1 = ?

Let me compute 43 * 82.1 = 3512.3. Then 0.75 *82.1 = 61.575. So sum is 3512.3 + 61.575 = 3573.875. So 43.75 *82.1 = 3573.875.

So, 0.04375 * 0.0821 = 3573.875e-6 = 0.003573875.

Now multiply by 273 K:

0.003573875 * 273 = ?

Well, 0.003573875 * 273 = ?

Let me compute 0.003573875 * 273:

Well, 0.003573875 * 200 = 0.714775.

0.003573875 *70 = 0.25017125.

0.003573875 *3 = 0.010721625.

Adding them together: 0.714775 +0.25017125=0.96494625; plus 0.010721625 → 0.975667875.

So V = 0.975667875 liters.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.9756 is approximately 1 liter, but I think I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.04375 * 0.0821 * 273.

Let me compute 0.04375 *0.0821 first.

0.04375 * 0.0821 = ?

Well, 0.04 * 0.0821 = 0.003284.

0.00375 * 0.0821 = 0.000308025.

Adding these: 0.003284 + 0.000308025 = 0.003592025.

Now multiply by 273:

0.003592025 * 273 = ?

Hmm, 0.003592 * 273.

Let me compute 0.003592 * 273.

Well, 0.003592 * 200 = 0.7184.

0.003592 *70 = 0.25144.

0.003592 * 3 = 0.010776.

Sum these: 0.7184 +0.25144= 0.96984 +0.010776=0.980616 liters.

So, V ≈ 0.9806 liters. But wait, the options don't have that. Let's look at the options.

The options are:

A: 11.2 l

B: 0.05 moles

C: 22.4 l

D: 1.12 l

E: 2.24 l

F: 4.48 l

G: 0.112 l

H: 0.224 l

I: 3.36 l

J: 5.60 l

Wait, none of the options are around 1 liter. Hmm. So maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the number of moles. Let me recompute.

NaHCO3 molar mass: Na is 23, H is 1, C is 12, 3 O (48). So 23 +1 is 24, +12 is 36, +48=84. Oh wait, wait a second! Wait, Na is about 23, H is 1, C is 12, O is 16 each. So NaHCO3 is Na (23) + H (1) + 2 C (24) + 3 O (48) → 23 +1 is 24, plus 24 is 48, plus 48 is 96. So molar mass is 96 g/mol. So 4.2 grams is 4.2 /96 = 0.04375 mol, correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the reaction as written produces CO₂ gas. So the moles of CO₂ are equal to moles of NaHCO3. So 0.04375 moles. So V = nRT/P = 0.04375 * 0.0821 *273.

Wait, let me compute 0.04375 *0.0821 first.

Wait, 0.04375 * 0.0821 → 0.04375 * 0.08 = 0.0035 (approx), 0.04375 * 0.0021= 0.000091875. So total about 0.003591875.

Now multiply by 273 K:

0.003591875 * 273 = ?

Let me calculate 0.003591875 × 273.

Compute 0.003591875 × 273 = ?

Well, 0.003591875 × 200 = 0.718375.

0.003591875 ×70 = 0.25143125.

0.003591875 ×3 = 0.010775625.

Adding them: 0.718375 + 0.25143125 = 0.96980625 + 0.010775625 = 0.980581875 liters. Approximately 0.9806 liters, which is about 1 liter.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The closest option is maybe E: 2.24 l, but that's higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction is NaHCO3 + KHC8H4O6 → NaKC8H4O6 + H2O + CO2(g). So for each mole of NaHCO3, one mole of CO2 is produced. So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: The reaction as written is correct? Let me think. NaHCO3 and KHC8H4O6. Yes, because they're both bicarbonate. So they would react to produce Na2C8H4O6 (sodium hydrogen decahydroxy decahydrate?), but in any case, the product is CO2.

Hmm. So I'm not sure why my calculation isn't matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the ideal gas law again. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces more than one mole of CO2.

Wait, wait, let me re-express the reaction equation. The balanced equation is:

NaHCO3 + KHC8H4O6 → NaKC8H4O6 + H2O + CO2(g)

So, the molar ratio is 1:1:1. So for each mole of NaHCO3, one mole of CO2 is produced.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the volume of CO2 is 0.04375 moles * 22.4 L/mol (since at STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L). Wait, but wait, the temperature here is 273 K, which is 0°C, so it's not STP. So I can't use 22.4 L/mol. So that's why I need the ideal gas law.

But according to my calculation, it's about 0.98 liters. None of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass.

Wait a second, Na is 23 g/mol, H is 1, C is12, O is 16 each. So NaHCO3 is Na (23) + H (1) + C (12) + 3 O (48) → 23 +1 =24, +12=36, +48=84. So yes, 84 g/mol. Oh wait, earlier I thought 96, but that's incorrect. No, wait another moment: 84 is correct? No, wait: Na is 23, H is 1, C is 12, O is 16 each.

So:

Na: 23 g/mol.

H: 1 g/mol.

C: 12 g/mol.

O: 16 *3 = 48.

Total: 23+1=24, 24+12=36, 36+48=84. So molar mass is 84 g/mol. Oh! That's where I went wrong earlier. I thought 96 was correct, but it's actually 84.

So, moles of NaHCO3 = 4.2 g / 84 g/mol = 0.05 moles.

Ah, that makes more sense. So using 0.05 moles.

So, V = nRT/P.

n = 0.05 mol.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T = 273 K.

P = 1 atm.

So, V = 0.05 * 0.0821 * 273.

Calculating that:

0.05 * 0.0821 = 0.004105.

0.004105 * 273 = ?

Well, 0.004105 * 200 = 0.821.

0.004105 *73= 0.004105 *70 = 0.28735, 0.004105 *3= 0.012315.

So 0.28735 +0.012315=0.3. So 0.821 +0.3= 1.121 liters.

So approximately 1.12 liters.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1.12 l.

So the correct answer should be option D.
</think>

To determine the volume of CO₂ gas produced when 4.2 g of NaHCO₃ is used, we start by calculating the number of moles of NaHCO₃. The molar mass of NaHCO₃ is calculated as follows:

- Na: 23 g/mol  
- H: 1 g/mol  
- C: 12 g/mol  
- O: 16 g/mol (3 × 16 = 48 g/mol)  

Adding these together:  
$$ \text{Molar mass of NaHCO₃} = 23 + 1 + 12 + 48 = 84 \, \text{g/mol} $$  

The number of moles of NaHCO₃ is:  
$$ n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{4.2 \, \text{g}}{84 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} $$  

From the balanced chemical equation:  
$$ \text{NaHCO₃} + \text{KHC₄H₆O₆} \rightarrow \text{NaKC₄H₄O₆} + \text{H₂O} + \text{CO₂(g)} $$  

Each mole of NaHCO₃ produces one mole of CO₂. Therefore, the number of moles of CO₂ produced is also **0.05 mol**.

Using the ideal gas law to calculate the volume of CO₂:  
$$ V = \frac{nRT}{P} $$  

Where:  
- \( n = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \)  
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)  
- \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \)  

Substituting the values:  
$$ V = 0.05 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 273 $$  

First, calculate \( 0.05 \cdot 0.0821 \):  
$$ 0.05 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.004105 $$  

Next, multiply by 273:  
$$ 0.004105 \cdot 273 = 1.121 \, \text{L} $$  

Thus, the volume of CO₂ gas produced is approximately **1.12 L**.  

Among the given options:  
- **A: 11.2 L** is too large.  
- **B: 0.05 moles** is incorrect, as it relates to NaHCO₃, not CO₂.  
- **C: 22.4 L** is incorrect, as it corresponds to 1 mole of gas at STP (273 K), not 22.4 L.  
- **D: 1.12 L** matches the calculated value.  
- **E: 2.24 L**, **F: 4.48 L**, **G: 0.112 L**, **H: 0.224 L**, **J: 5.60 L** are incorrect.  

The correct answer is **D: 1.12 L**.
