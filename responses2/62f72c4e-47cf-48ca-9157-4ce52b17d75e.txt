Okay, so I have this question about finding the Laplace transform of f(t) = t². I'm a bit rusty on my transforms, but I remember that the Laplace transform converts a function of time into a function of a complex variable s. The most common ones are for t^n, so I think that's the way to go.

Wait, I remember something about the Laplace transform of t^n being n! divided by s^(n+1). Since f(t) is t squared, n would be 2. So that would make the transform 2! divided by s cubed. 2! is 2, so the transform is 2/s³. Let me check the options. Option E is 2/s³, so that should be the correct answer.

The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t^2 \) can be found using the formula for the Laplace transform of \( t^n \), which is \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \). For \( n = 2 \), this becomes \( \frac{2!}{s^3} = \frac{2}{s^3} \). 

**Answer: E: (2 / s^3)**
