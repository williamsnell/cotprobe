Okay, so I've got this question about a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the range of firing angle control when the load's counter emf is 200V. The source voltage is given as 400 sin(314 t) volts.

Wait, I remember from my studies that in single-phase pulse control, the firing angle determines when the pulse is applied. The counter emf is the load's emf, which here is 200V. Also, the source voltage is 400 sin(314t). I think the 314 is the angular frequency, which is 2π times the frequency. So, 314 = 2πf, so f is 50 Hz.

In a single-phase one-pulse circuit, when you apply a pulse, the load current is zero before the pulse starts, and then after the pulse, it lags behind the source voltage by the firing angle. So, the counter emf E is given by E = Vm sin(ωt + θ), where θ is the firing angle. But wait, no, actually, the firing angle is often denoted as α or θ, and the phase relationship is such that the firing occurs at α, and the counter emf is when the pulses are applied. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps the counter emf is the voltage across the load during the pulse.

Let me think: the load's counter emf is given as 200 V. So, the maximum value of the counter emf is 400 sin(θ), where θ is the firing angle. Wait, no, the source voltage is 400 sin(314 t), so its peak is 400V. The load's counter emf E is 200 V. But the counter emf is given as 400 sin(314t), so maybe the peak is 400, so the average would be 200, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I need to relate the firing angle to the maximum value of the counter emf.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the firing angle and the average or peak value of the load's counter emf. So, in a single pulse, the firing angle α determines the shape of the current. The average value of the load's current is (Vm/(πR)) * (1 - cos α), if I remember correctly. But wait, the question is about the range of the firing angle that results in a certain counter emf. Wait, no, the question gives the counter emf as E = 200 V. But the source voltage is 400 sin (314t), so the maximum source voltage is 400V, and the load is 200V. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the counter emf is the average value. Or maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let's think again.

The load's counter emf E is given as 200 V. The source EMF is 400 sin(314t). So, when the load is in the pulse, the counter emf is 200 V. Wait, but how does the firing angle relate to this?

In a one-pulse controlled circuit, the firing angle is the angle at which the pulse is applied. If the firing angle is alpha, then the pulse starts when the source voltage reaches a certain value. The counter emf during the pulse is determined by the time the pulse is applied.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to relate the firing angle to the average or peak value of the counter emf. Let me recall that in a single-phase pulse control, the average value of the current I_avg is (Vm / (π R)) * (1 - cos α), where alpha is the firing angle.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the average current is (Vm / π R) * (1 - cos α) when the firing angle is alpha. So, if the load's average counter emf is 200 V, then perhaps E_avg = 200 V. But wait, E is a voltage; the average value of the voltage across the load during the pulse.

Wait, the source voltage is 400 sin(314t). The pulse is applied when the source voltage is above a certain threshold. The counter emf during the pulse is E_applied, which is 200 V. Wait, perhaps I should think about the phase relationship.

In a single-phase pulse control, the current is zero before the pulse, and then it lags behind the source voltage by the firing angle α. The counter emf (E) is the voltage across the resistance R during the pulse. So, E = I * R. But I is the current during the pulse, which lags behind the source voltage by α. So, the source voltage during the pulse is V = Vm sin(ωt + 180° - α) I think. Because the current I is zero before the pulse and then leads the source by α. Wait, no, wait. The current I is zero when the pulse starts. Then, the current I becomes I0 sin(ωt - α), perhaps.

Wait, maybe I should model it. The source voltage is V_s = V_m sin(ωt + θ), where θ is some initial phase shift. The current I(t) during the pulse is I(t) = (V_s(t) - V_ref) / R, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the point where the pulse is applied.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to think about the maximum value of the load's counter emf and relate it to the firing angle.

The load's counter emf E is given as 200 V. The source EMF is 400 sin(314t). The maximum value of E would be when the source is at its peak. So, when the source is at 400 V, the counter emf is 200 V. So, what's the relation between the firing angle and this.

Wait, the counter emf during the pulse is given by E(t) = (V_s(t) - V_ref) / R, but perhaps I'm mixing up the reference. Alternatively, perhaps during the pulse, the counter emf is E = V_s - V_ref, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the average value. Let me think about the average value of E during the pulse. The average value of a sinusoid is zero, but for a single pulse, perhaps we're considering the average during the pulse, which is when the counter emf is 200 V.

Alternatively, perhaps the average value of the load's current is given by I_avg = (Vm (1 - cos α)) / (π R). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the average value of the counter emf is E_avg = Vm (1 - cos α) / (π R). 

Wait, considering that, if E_avg is 200 V, and Vm is 400 V, then:

200 = (400 (1 - cos α)) / (π R) * R ?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's try to figure it out more carefully.

The counter emf E is given by E = V_s - V_ref, perhaps. But when the pulse is applied, the current I = (V_s - V_ref)/R. The average value of I during the pulse (i.e., during the firing angle) would be the average of (V_s(t) - V_ref)/R.

But what is V_ref? It could be the reference voltage set by the circuit. But if V_ref is set to zero, then perhaps E_avg is (1/π) ∫ V_s(t) dt from 0 to T, but for a single pulse, it's the average during the pulse.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it this way: the maximum value of the counter emf occurs when the source voltage is maximum. So when V_s is 400 V, the counter emf E is 200 V.

Wait, but E is the counter emf, and it's 200 V. So when the source is at 400 V, E is 200 V. So, the ratio between the source and the counter emf is 2:1.

Perhaps the relation between E and V_s is E = k * V_s, where k is a constant. So, if E is 200 V when V_s is 400 V, then k is 0.5. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the average counter emf is 200 V. The average value of a sinusoid is zero, but maybe in this context, we're considering the average during the pulse.

Wait, maybe the average value of the counter emf is E_avg = (V_m / (π)) * (1 - cos α). So, if E_avg is 200 V, then:

200 = (400 / π) * (1 - cos α)

Solving for (1 - cos α):

1 - cos α = (200 * π) / 400 = (π)/2 ≈ 1.57

Wait, but 1 - cos α can't be more than 2, because cos α ranges between -1 and 1. So, 1 - cos α can be at max 2 (when α is 180°, cos α is -1), so 1 - (-1) = 2. So, 1 - cos α = 2 would give cos α = -1, which is 180°, but that gives (200) = (400/π) * (2) → 200 = 800/π ≈ 254.65, which is not correct. So, that approach must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is that the peak value of the load's counter emf is V_m * (1 - cos α) / π R. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the counter emf is V_s(t) - V_ref, but if the reference is zero, then E(t) = V_s(t). That can't be right, because then E would be 400 V at maximum, but the question says 200 V.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the firing angle as the angle at which the pulse is applied. The current I is zero before the pulse, and then I becomes maximum. So, the counter emf is the voltage across R during the pulse. Let me model this.

At firing angle α, the current is zero when the source voltage is at V_s(t) = V_m sin(ωt). So, the pulse is applied when V_s(t) ≥ V_ref. Let's assume V_ref is zero for simplicity. Then, during the pulse, the current I = V_s(t)/R.

The counter emf E is the voltage across R, which is I * R = V_s(t)/R * R = V_s(t). So, E = V_s(t) during the pulse.

But according to the problem, the average E is 200 V. But the maximum E is 400 V.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Alternatively, perhaps the average value of E is 200 V. The average of a sinusoid is zero, so perhaps it's the average during the pulse. The pulse starts when V_s(t) reaches V_ref. For a single pulse, perhaps the average of the pulse is (V_m)/(π).

Wait, in a single pulse, the pulse duration is when V_s(t) is above V_ref. Let me think of it as the pulse starts at a certain time.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options given. The options are ranges for the firing angle. The options are:

A:60-180

B:90-150

C:60-150

D:30-120

E:30-180

F:30-150

G:60-120

H:90-180

I:45-180

J:45-135

So, the question is, when the load's counter emf is 200 V, what are the possible firing angles.

Wait, the load's counter emf is 200 V. But the source's maximum is 400 V. So, the ratio is 200/400=0.5. So perhaps the firing angle is such that the maximum possible counter emf (when the pulse is applied) is 200 V.

Wait, but the maximum possible E is 400 V, which would happen when the pulse is applied at the peak voltage. But in this question, the E is 200 V, which is half of the maximum.

So, perhaps the firing angle is such that the period of the pulse is half the maximum, leading to E = 200 V.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the firing angle is determined by the ratio of the counter emf to the source's E. So, 200 is half of 400, so the firing angle is when the counter emf is half the source's peak.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the firing angle in terms of the duty cycle. The duty cycle is the fraction of the cycle in which the pulse is applied. For a single pulse, the duty cycle is 100% (assuming a pulse is applied for the entire period). Wait, no, in a single pulse, the pulse is only for a fraction of the cycle. The maximum pulse duration is 50% (half period).

Wait, but the question is about the firing angle. Let's recall that firing angle α is the angle at which the pulse starts. So, for a given firing angle, the duration of the pulse is  π - α. Because, when α is zero, the pulse starts at t=0, and the pulse duration is π (180 degrees). As α increases, the pulse starts later, and the duration decreases until α approaches π (180), the pulse starts near the peak, and the duration approaches zero.

Wait, I think the pulse duration is (π - α) radians. So, for example, if α is 0°, the pulse starts at t=0, and the duration is π radians (180 degrees) of the cycle. If α is 90°, the pulse starts at t = 90°, so the duration is π - (π/2) = π/2 radians (90 degrees).

So, the duty cycle (D) is the pulse duration divided by the period. The period is 2π radians (360 degrees). So D = (π - α) / (2π) ) = (1 - α/(π)) * (1/2) ) → Wait, no, D = (π - α)/ (2π) ) = (1 - α/(π)) * (1/2) → No, actually, D = (π - α) / (2π) ) = (1/2) (1 - (α)/(π) )) → Hmm, perhaps I should just calculate it as D = (π - α) / (2π) ) = (1 - α/π)/2. Wait, no, D = (π - α) / (2π) ) = (1/2) * (π - α)/π) = (1/2)(1 - α/(π)).

Alternatively, perhaps the duty cycle is (π - α)/(2π) ) → which is (1/2)(1 - (α/(π))).

Wait, but what's the relationship between the firing angle and the counter emf (E)? Hmm.

The counter emf E(t) is given by E(t) = V_s(t) - V_ref, but perhaps more accurately, when the pulse is applied, the current is I, so E = I * R. But I is the current, which is maximum when the pulse starts.

Wait, when the pulse starts at firing angle α, the current starts to rise. The maximum current I_max occurs when the pulse is applied. So, I_max = V_s(t)/R at the point when the pulse starts.

Assuming that the source is sinusoidal, the current during the pulse is V_s(t)/R, but V_s(t) is V_m sin(ωt + 180 - α), or something like that. Wait, perhaps when the pulse is applied, the source is at V_s(t) = V_m sin(ωt) - V_ref, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps in the pulse, the source voltage is V_s(t) = V_m sin(ωt + (π - α)), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the average value of the current during the pulse, which is I_avg = (1/(2π)) ∫ I(t) dt from 0 to T pulse. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible value of the counter emf (E_max) is V_m * (1 - cos α)/(π). So, when E_max is 400 sin(314t), and the average E is 200 V.

Wait, if E_max is 400 V (when the source is at peak), then E_max is (400)(1 - cos α)/π → 400 (1 - cos α)/pi = 200 → 1 - cos α = (200 * pi)/400 = pi/2 ≈ 1.57. But this is impossible because 1 - cos α cannot exceed 2 (since cos α is at least -1), but 1.57 is less than 2. So, that would give 1 - cos α = 1.57 → cos α = -0.57 → which would be around 125 degrees. But that's outside the options.

Wait, let me re-express the equation:

E_avg = (V_m / π) * (1 - cos α)

Given that E_avg is 200 V, and V_m is 400 V,

200 = (400 / π) * (1 - cos α)

Multiply both sides by π:

200 * π = 400 (1 - cos α)

Divide both sides by 400:

(200 * π)/400 = 1 - cos α → pi/2 = 1 - cos α

So, 1 - cos α = pi/2 ≈ 1.57 → cos α = 1 - 1.57 = -0.57 → alpha ≈ 125 degrees.

But wait, 125 degrees is not one of the options. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option F is 30-150, which is a range that includes 125. So, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but when the average counter emf is 200 V, the firing angle is 125 degrees. So, the firing angle is about 125 degrees, which is within the range of option F (30-150). So, the answer would be F: 30-150.

Wait, but let me think again. The average counter emf is 200 V, which is half of the source's peak voltage (400 V). So, how does the firing angle relate to this?

Earlier, I derived that (1 - cos α) = (200 * π)/400 = pi/2 → cos α = -pi/2 + 1 → which would be approximately -0.57, leading to alpha ≈ 125 degrees.

But wait, 125 degrees is just a single point, but the options suggest a range. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

E_avg = (V_m / (2π)) * (1 - cos α) * R → but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E_avg = (V_m / (π R)) * (1 - cos α) → because the current during the pulse is I = (V_s(t) - V_ref)/R, and the average is (1/π) ∫ V_s(t) dt from 0 to T.

But without getting stuck, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the firing angle is 125 degrees, which is within option F (30-150). So, the answer is F.
</think>

To determine the range of the firing angle for which the load's counter emf is 200 V, we analyze the relationship between the firing angle (α), the source voltage (V_s), and the load's counter emf (E). The source voltage is given as \( V_s(t) = V_m \sin(\omega t) \), where \( V_m = 400 \, \text{V} \), and the load's counter emf is \( E = 200 \, \text{V} \).

The counter emf during the pulse is directly related to the source voltage at the moment the pulse starts. Assuming the source voltage is sinusoidal, the pulse starts when the source voltage reaches its peak value (\( V_m \)). The firing angle (α) is the angle at which the pulse starts, and the duration of the pulse is proportional to \( \pi - \alpha \). For a single pulse, the pulse duration is \( \pi \) radians, and the duty cycle is \( \frac{\pi - \alpha}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \frac{\alpha}{\pi}) \).

The relationship between the firing angle and the counter emf is derived from the formula for the average value of the load's current during the pulse:
\[
E_{\text{avg}} = \frac{V_m}{\pi} (1 - \cos \alpha)
\]
Substituting \( E_{\text{avg}} = 200 \, \text{V} \) and \( V_m = 400 \, \text{V} \):
\[
200 = \frac{400}{\pi} (1 - \cos \alpha)
\]
Solving for \( 1 - \cos \alpha \):
\[
1 - \cos \alpha = \frac{200 \pi}{400} = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57
\]
\[
\cos \alpha = 1 - 1.57 = -0.57
\]
Thus, \( \alpha \approx 125^\circ \).

The options provided are ranges of firing angles. Since \( \alpha \approx 125^\circ \) falls within the range \( 30^\circ - 150^\circ \), the correct answer is:
