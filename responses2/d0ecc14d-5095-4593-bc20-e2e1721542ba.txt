Okay, so I have this chemistry question about demineralisation of tooth enamel. Hmm, I remember that demineralisation is when the tooth enamel, which is made up of calcium phosphate, is broken down into calcium hydroxide. This process typically occurs in the mouth where exposed food residues, like carbonated drinks, can cause tooth enamel to react with acids and release calcium hydroxide, which then dissolves in water. 

Wait, the question is about the critical pH below which this happens. I think the critical pH is the point below which demineralisation doesn't occur. So I need to recall what the pH is for that. I remember that when the pH is low enough, the calcium ions from the tooth enamel can't be removed because the solution is acidic. 

Let me think about the options. The options are A to J, with various pH values. I think the critical pH is around 5.2. Oh wait, I think it's around 5.2 because I've heard that below 5.2, demineralisation doesn't occur. So if the pH drops below that, the enamel would stay as it is because it can't be neutralized. 

So the critical pH is around 5.2. Looking at the options, option B is 5.2. So the answer should be B.

The critical pH below which demineralisation of tooth enamel occurs is usually around **5.2**. This is the pH at which the enamel can no longer be neutralized by the acidic environment, allowing it to remain as calcium phosphate. 

Answer: B
