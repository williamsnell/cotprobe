Okay, so I've got this question about the maturity date of a 60-day note that was dated March 15. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about how to approach it.

First, I remember that a note or a bond typically has a maturity date which is the date when the note is due to be paid back. The maturity date is calculated by adding the number of days specified in the note to the date it was issued.

So, the note is for 60 days and was dated March 15. That means I need to count 60 days starting from March 15.

Let me break it down step by step. March has 31 days. March 15 is the 15th day of March, so from March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (including both the 15th and 31st). Wait, no. Wait, no, 15th to 31st is 17 days because you count both the start and end dates. So 31 minus 15 plus 1 equals 17 days.

So March has 17 days from March 15 to March 31. That leaves 60 - 17 = 43 days remaining in the rest of the year.

Now, after March, the next month is April, which has 30 days. So if we subtract all of April, which is 30 days, that leaves 43 - 30 = 13 days. 

So the remaining time is 13 days into May. Since March 15 is the starting point, adding 30 days to March 31 brings us to April 30. Then we add 13 days to April 30. April has 30 days, so April 30 plus 13 days is May 13.

Wait, let me double-check. March 15 is the starting point. Let's count the days:

March 15: day 0.

March 16 to March 31 is 16 days (since 31-15=16, but including both dates). So March 15 → March 31 is 16 days. So 60 days minus 16 days is 44 days remaining.

April has 30 days. So 44 - 30 = 14 days remaining.

So 14 days into May. So May 14. So the maturity date is May 14.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, using a different approach: from March 15, adding 60 days.

Let me count each day step by step.

March 15 → March 31: that's 17 days (including both ends). So 17 days passed, leaving 60 -17=43 days.

April has 30 days, so 43 -30=13 days left into May.

So adding 13 days to April 30 would be May 13.

Wait, but wait, March 15 plus 43 days: let me count.

March has 17 days from March 15 to March 31. So 43-30=13 days in April and May.

Wait, March 15 is day 1. So adding 16 days (from March 15 to March 31) brings us to day 17. Then 43-17=26 days left. Wait, that's not right. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, March 15 is the starting point. Let's count each day:

March 15 is the first day (day 0). March 16 is day 1.

March has 31 days, so March 15 to March 31 is 17 days (since 31-15+1=17). So after March 15, 17 days get us to March 31.

That leaves 60-17=43 days remaining.

April has 30 days, so 43-30=13 days remaining in May.

So 13 days into May would be May 13. Wait, but wait, if I count 13 days from April 30, that's May 13. So the maturity is May 13.

But wait, another way: March 15 plus 60 days.

Let me compute it using a different method. 

March: 31 days. March 15 to March 31 is 17 days (including both). 60-17=43 days left.

April has 30 days, so 43-30=13 days left into May.

So May 13.

Looking at the options, option E is May 13.

But wait, I thought the answer was May 14. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recount. March 15 plus 60 days.

March has 31 days, so from March 15 to March 31 is 17 days (including March 15). So 60-17=43 days remaining.

April has 30 days, so subtract 30: 43-30=13 days into May.

Adding 13 days to April 30 (since March ends on March 31, so April 30 is the last day of April), so adding 13 days would be May 13 (since April 30 +13 is May 13).

So the answer should be May 13, which is option E.

Wait, but I thought earlier it was May 14. Did I get confused? No, I think I was correct the first time. So the correct answer is E: May 13.
</think>

The correct answer is E: May 13.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Start with March 15 as the starting date.**
2. **Calculate the number of days from March 15 to March 31 (inclusive):** 31 - 15 + 1 = 17 days.
3. **Subtract this from the total 60 days:** 60 - 17 = 43 days remaining.
4. **Subtract the 30 days in April:** 43 - 30 = 13 days remaining.
5. **Add these 13 days to April 30:** April 30 + 13 days = May 13.

Thus, the maturity date is May 13.

**Answer:** E: May 13
