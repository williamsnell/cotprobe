Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm supposed to calculate the change in enthalpy, ΔrH°, for a given reaction. The reaction is:

C₂H₅OH(l) + 3 O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g)

And they've given that the ΔrU° is -1373 kJ/mol at 298 K. Oh wait, and all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise, so I don't have to worry about non-ideal behavior here. 

Hmm, I remember that there's a relationship between ΔrH° and ΔrU°. Oh right, the equation ΔrH° = ΔrU° + Δr(TP), where the second term is the heat released or absorbed at constant pressure. Wait, actually, I think it's the other way around. Wait, let me think. Oh yes, the change in enthalpy is equal to the change in internal energy plus the product of pressure and the change in temperature. But wait, wait. Wait, no, the formula I remember is ΔrH° = ΔrU° + nΔrVΔH°, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Wait, wait, another approach: the enthalpy change can be found using the relation involving the Gibbs free energy or using the enthalpy and the change in enthalpy and internal energy.

Oh wait, another approach: the relation is ΔrH = ΔrU + (ΔrV)ΔT, but I think no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Wait, the formula is ΔrH° = ΔrU° + (ΔrV)ΔT. Wait, but at constant pressure, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is equal to the heat at constant pressure (q_p), and the change in internal energy (ΔU) is q_v (at constant volume), and there's a relation between them: ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT. Oh, right! Because H = U + PV, so when pressure is constant, dH = dU + d(PV) = dU + PdV + VdP. But at constant pressure, dP is zero, so dH = dU + PdV. But PdV is equal to RT d(n), because PV = nRT, so dV = (n/dP) dP = (d(n)/dP) P dV. Wait, maybe it's better to think that ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT. Because when you have a change in moles, n, the difference comes from the ideal gas part, which is nRT.

So the formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R T. Or wait, the change in number of moles of gas, Δn_gas, multiplied by R T. But wait, looking back, the formula is ΔH = ΔU + (Δn) R T. Oh, because at constant pressure, V is a function of n, so the change in U is a bit different from the change in V.

Wait, no, let me think again. The correct formula is ΔH = ΔU + (Δn) R T. Because H = U + PV, and PV = nRT, so when n changes, ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n) R T. Because PV is n R T, and when n changes by Δn, then PV changes by Δ(n) R T. So the change in H is the change in U plus the change in the PV term, which is Δn R T.

So that's the formula: ΔrH° = ΔrU° + Δr_n * R T, where Δr_n is the change in moles of gas.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, the formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n) R T. So the change in H is the change in U plus the change in the number of moles multiplied by R T. Because PV is nRT, so when n changes by Δn, PV changes by ΔnRT.

So yeah, the equation is:

ΔrH° = ΔrU° + Δr_n * R T

Where Δr_n is the change in the number of moles of gas from reactants to products.

So I need to compute Δn for this reaction.

Let's write out the balanced equation:

C₂H₅OH(l) + 3 O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g)

Now, looking at the moles of gas on each side.

Reactants: 1 mole (C₂H₅OH is a liquid, so it doesn't count) + 3 moles O₂ → total of 4 moles of gas? Wait, no. Wait, C₂H5OH is a liquid, so it contributes 0 to the gas moles. O₂ is 3 moles gas. On the product side: 2 moles CO₂ and 3 moles H2O. CO2 is gas, H2O is gas. So 2 +3 =5 moles gas.

So Δn = 5 -4 = +1 mole of gas.

So Δr_n = 5 - 4 = +1.

Wait, so the change in moles of gas is +1.

So plugging into the equation:

ΔrH° = ΔrU° + (Δn) R T

Wait, wait, no, the formula is ΔrH° = ΔrU° + (Δn) R T. Because H increases when the number of moles increases by Δn. So the change in H is the change in U plus the change in the PV term, which is Δn R T.

Wait, but wait, isn't the formula ΔH = ΔU + V dP? No, that's not it. Wait, maybe an alternative approach: using the relation between H and U.

Because H = U + P V, so the change in H is the change in U plus the change in (P V). But under constant pressure, P is constant, so the change is d(P V) = P dV + V dP. Since dP is zero, it's just P dV. But P V is n R T, so d(P V) = R T dn. So the change in H is ΔU + R T Δn.

Wait, that's right. So ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n) R T.

So in this case, ΔrH° = ΔrU° + (Δn) R T.

Wait, but wait, the formula is the change in H is equal to the change in U plus the change in (n) R T. Because H = U + n R T (since PV = n R T for ideal gas). So when n changes by Δn, H changes by Δn R T. So the total ΔH is ΔU plus Δn R T.

So yeah, that's correct.

So the equation is:

ΔH = ΔU + (Δn) R T

Here, Δn is +1, because the products have 5 moles of gas, reactants have 4.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔrH° = (-1373 kJ/mol) + (1 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K)

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the units for ΔrU are kJ/mol, so I should convert R to kJ.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K). Or sometimes, it's easy to get mixed up with units.

So the term (Δn) R T would be:

Δn = +1 mol.

R = 8.314 J/mol·K → 0.008314 kJ/mol·K.

T is 298 K.

So (1 mol) * (0.008314 kJ/mol·K) * (298 K) = 0.008314 * 298 = let's calculate that.

0.008314 * 300 is about 2.4942, but since it's 298, it's 2.4942 - (0.008314 * 2) = 2.4942 - 0.016628 = 2.477572 kJ/mol.

So the term is approximately 2.4776 kJ/mol.

So adding this to the ΔrU° which is -1373 kJ/mol gives:

ΔrH° = (-1373) + 2.4776 = let's compute that.

-1373 + 2.4776 = -1370.5224 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, the ΔrU° is negative. So adding a positive value, which is smaller in magnitude than the absolute value of ΔrU°.

So the total is about -1370.52 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option D is -1390, which is more negative.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the sign? Because the formula is ΔH = ΔU + (Δn) RT.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, wait, in the formula, H = U + PV.

PV = nRT, so H = U + n R T.

So when n increases by 1, H increases by R T. So the change is + R T, which is positive.

So the equation is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the reaction equation is written as reactants → products. So for this reaction, the number of moles of gas increases by 1 (from 4 to 5), so Δn is +1. So that's correct.

So the calculation is accurate.

So the ΔrH° is (-1373) + (8.314 * 298) * 1e-3 (since R is in kJ/(mol·K)).

Wait, let me recompute the term:

8.314 J/mol·K = 0.008314 kJ/mol·K.

Multiply by 298 K: 0.008314 * 298 = 2.477572 kJ/mol.

So the term is +2.477572 kJ.

So total ΔH is -1373 + 2.477572 = -1370.5224 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, which option is closest to this value?

The options are:

A: -1400

B: -1415

C: -1340

D: -1390

E: -1320

F: -1335

G: -1385

H: -1375

I: -1420

J: -1368

Wait, wait wait, wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the sign of the term? Because the formula is ΔrH° = ΔrU° + (Δn) R T.

Wait, the ΔrU is -1373 kJ/mol, and (Δn) R T is positive 2.4776 kJ.

So -1373 + 2.4776 = -1370.5224 kJ/mol.

So the ΔH is approximately -1370.52 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, the closest is option H: -1375, but wait, -1370 is not exactly H (which is -1375). Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the multiplication.

Alternatively, let me compute 8.314 * 298.

8.314 * 298 is equal to:

First, 8 * 298 = 2384.

0.314 * 298 = let's calculate:

0.3 * 298 = 89.4.

0.014 * 298 = 4.172.

So 89.4 +4.172=93.572.

So total is 2384 +93.572= 2477.572 J/mol.

Convert J to kJ: 2.477572 kJ/mol.

So that's correct. So the term is about 2.4776 kJ.

So the total is -1373 + 2.4776 = -1370.5224.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match this value. Let me look at the options again:

A: -1400

B: -1415

C: -1340

D: -1390

E: -1320

F: -1335

G: -1385

H: -1375

I: -1370? Wait, no, I is -1420.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the term. Wait, no, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the Δn. Let me make sure Δn is correct.

The reaction is C₂H₅OH(l) +3 O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g).

So moles of gas on reactant side: 0 (C2H5OH is liquid) +3 = 3.

Moles of gas on product side: 2 (CO2) + 3 (H2O) =5.

So Δn =5-3= +2.

Wait that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh! Wait, wait! Oh no, wait. No, no, no! Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Number of moles of gas on reactant side is 3 (from O2), and on product side it's 2 (CO2) +3 (H2O) =5. So Δn =5-3= +2.

Wait, so Δn is +2.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So where did I go wrong?

Ah! Oh wait, I must have made a mistake in counting moles earlier. Let me recheck.

Reactants:

C2H5OH(l) is a liquid, so moles of gas: 0.

O2 is 3 moles gas. So total is 3.

Products:

CO₂ is 2 moles gas.

H2O is 3 moles gas.

So product moles gas: 2 +3 =5.

So Δn =5-3= +2.

Oh! So I think I made a mistake earlier. So my Δn is +2, not +1.

Wait, that changes the calculation.

So with Δn =2, the term is 2 * R * T.

R is 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K). T is 298.

So 2 * 0.008314 * 298 = let's compute that.

0.008314 *298= 2.477572 (as before). Multiply by 2: 4.955144 kJ.

So ΔrH°= ΔrU° + 4.955144 kJ.

ΔrU° is -1373, so adding 4.955144 gives:

-1373 +4.955144= -1368.04486 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Looking at the options:

Which option is around -1368?

Looking at the options:

F: -1335

G: -1385

H: -1375

I: -1370

J: -1368.

So option J is -1368, which is very close to the calculated value of approximately -1368.04486 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the options are:

J: -1368.

So the correct answer should be option J.

Wait, but wait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. So where did I go wrong earlier?

I think I miscounted the moles. Oh, I see where I made the mistake. I thought the moles of gas on the product side were 5, but wait, let me recount:

C₂H5OH is a liquid, so it's not part of the gas count. O₂ is 3 moles. Products: CO₂ is 2, H2O is 3 → total 5. So yes, the change is +2.

So the correct calculation is:

Delta H = Delta U + (Delta n) * R T

= (-1373 kJ/mol) + (2 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) → but wait, in terms of kJ.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔrH° = ΔrU° + (Δn) R T

Where Δn is +2.

So ΔrH° = (-1373) + (2) * (8.314 * 298 kJ).

Wait, no, wait. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) → to get kJ, it's 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K).

So R T is 0.008314 * 298 = 2.477572 kJ/mol.

Multiply by Δn (2) → 4.955144 kJ.

So delta H is -1373 + 4.955144 = -1368.044856 kJ/mol.

Looking for the option, which is J: -1368.

So the correct answer is option J.
</think>

To calculate the change in enthalpy, ΔrH°, for the given reaction:

**Reaction:**
\[
\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{l}) + 3 \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) + 3 \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})
\]

We use the relationship between ΔrH° and ΔrU°, which accounts for the heat released or absorbed at constant pressure:

\[
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}}\mathrm{H}^\ominus = \Delta_{\mathrm{r}}\mathrm{U}^\ominus + \Delta_{\mathrm{r}}n \cdot R \cdot T
\]

### Step 1: Identify the values
- ΔrU° = -1373 kJ/mol (given)
- Δn = moles of gas on product side - moles of gas on reactant side:
  - Moles of gas on reactant side: 3 (from O₂)
  - Moles of gas on product side: 2 (CO₂) + 3 (H₂O) = 5
  - Δn = 5 - 3 = +2
- \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/(mol·K)} = 0.008314 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol·K)} \)
- \( T = 298 \, \mathrm{K} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the term \( \Delta_{\mathrm{r}}n \cdot R \cdot T \)
\[
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}}n \cdot R \cdot T = (+2) \cdot (0.008314 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol·K)}) \cdot (298 \, \mathrm{K})
\]

First, calculate \( R \cdot T \):
\[
R \cdot T = 0.008314 \cdot 298 = 2.477572 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

Now, calculate \( \Delta_{\mathrm{r}}n \cdot R \cdot T \):
\[
(+2) \cdot 2.477572 = 4.955144 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate ΔrH°
\[
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}}\mathrm{H}^\ominus = \Delta_{\mathrm{r}}\mathrm{U}^\ominus + \Delta_{\mathrm{r}}n \cdot R \cdot T
\]
\[
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}}\mathrm{H}^\ominus = (-1373) + 4.955144 = -1368.044856 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated value of ΔrH° is approximately **-1368.04 kJ/mol**, which matches option **J: -1368**.

ANSWER: J
