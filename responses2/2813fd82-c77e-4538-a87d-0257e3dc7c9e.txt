Okay, so I have this problem about Tim's earnings. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Tim's salary is a guaranteed $4800 a year, but he also makes commission based on his sales. The question asks about his gross earnings last month when his sales were $21,750. 

So, the commission structure is as follows:
- 4% on sales up to $12,000.
- 5% on sales from $12,000 to $20,000.
- 6% on sales over $20,000.

Hmm, so each month, he gets these different rates based on how much he sells. Last month he sold $21,750. Let me break this down.

First, the sales are split into three parts: up to $12k, between $12k and $20k, and anything over $20k. 

So, up to $12k: that's the first portion. He gets 4% of that. Then, between $12k and $20k, which is $8k (since $20k - $12k = $8k). He gets 5% on that. The remaining amount is over $20k, which is $1,750 (since $21,750 - $20k = $1,750). He gets 6% on that.

Let me calculate each part.

1. 4% of $12,000: 0.04 * 12000 = 480. So that's $480.

2. 5% of $8,000 (since $20k - $12k is $8k): 0.05 * 8000 = 400. So this is $400.

3. 6% of $1,750: 0.06 * 1750. Let me calculate that. 1750 times 0.06. 1750 * 0.06 is 105. So that's $105.

Now, add all these up. 480 + 400 = 880. 880 + 105 = 985. So his commission is $985.

Wait, but wait a second. The total is $985, but this is for the month, right? And Tim also has a guaranteed salary of $4800. So his gross earnings would be his salary plus the commission.

So $4800 (fixed) + $985 (commission) = $5785.

Let me double-check the calculations.

First part: 4% of 12k is 480. Correct.

Second part: 5% of 8k (since 20k -12k is 8k). 5% of 8k is 400. Correct.

Third part: 6% of 1750 is 105. Correct.

Adding them: 480 + 400 = 880. 880 + 105 = 985. Correct.

Adding to salary: 4800 + 985 = 5785. So the total gross is $5785.

Looking at the options, option B is $5785. So the answer should be B.

Tim's gross earnings are calculated as a combination of a fixed salary and commission based on his sales. 

1. **Commission Calculation:**
   - 4% of $12,000 = $480.
   - 5% of $8,000 ($20,000 - $12,000) = $400.
   - 6% of $1,750 ($21,750 - $20,000) = $105.

   Total Commission = $480 + $400 + $105 = $985.

2. **Gross Earnings:**
   - Fixed salary: $4800.
   - Commission: $985.

   Gross Earnings = $4800 + $985 = $5785.

The correct answer is **B: $5785**.

Answer: B
