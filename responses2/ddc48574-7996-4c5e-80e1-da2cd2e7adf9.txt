Okay, so I've got this problem here about bird feed bags being delivered over the week. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is asking for the total number of bags by the end of the week. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll list out the information given. There are nine bags already in storage. Then, the delivery schedule is as follows: 17 on Monday, 22 on Tuesday, 3 on Wednesday, 11 on Thursday, and 18 on Friday. I need to add all these together to find the total.

Wait, but wait. The initial nine are already in storage, right? So that's the starting point. Then, each day the number of bags being delivered. So I should calculate the total delivered bags over the week and add that to the initial nine.

Let me jot down the numbers:

- Monday: 17
- Tuesday: 22
- Wednesday: 3
- Thursday: 11
- Friday: 18

I think the best way is to add all these numbers together. Let's do it step by step. Maybe group some to make it easier.

Starting with Monday and Tuesday: 17 + 22 = 39. Then Wednesday adds 3, making it 42. Thursday adds 11, so 42 + 11 = 53. Friday adds 18, so 53 + 18 = 71. Wait, that's a total of 71 bags delivered during the week.

But wait, I also have the initial nine bags. So the total is 9 (initial) + 71 (delivered) = 80.

Wait, but let me check my addition again to be sure. Sometimes I might make a mistake adding.

Let me add the delivered bags again:

17 (Monday) + 22 (Tuesday) = 39.

39 + 3 (Wednesday) = 42.

42 + 11 (Thursday) = 53.

53 + 18 (Friday) = 71.

Yes, that's correct. So 71 delivered. Plus the initial nine, which gives 80.

Looking at the options, option D is 80. So I think the answer should be D.

The total number of bird feed bags by the end of the week is calculated by adding the initial nine bags to the sum of the bags being delivered each day:

- Initial bags: 9
- Monday: +17 = 26
- Tuesday: +22 = 48
- Wednesday: +3 = 51
- Thursday: +11 = 62
- Friday: +18 = 80

Total: 9 + 17 + 22 + 3 + 11 + 18 = 80.

Answer: D: 80
