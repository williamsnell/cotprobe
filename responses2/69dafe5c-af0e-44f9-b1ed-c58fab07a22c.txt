Question:

An Aston Martin V8 Vantage sports car has a lateral acceleration of $0.96g = (0.96)(9.8 m / s^2) = 9.4 m / s^2$. This is the maximum centripetal acceleration the car can sustain without skidding out of a curved path. If the car is traveling at a constant 40m/s on level ground, what is the radius R of the tightest unbanked curve it can negotiate? (Unit: m))

Options:

A: 190
B: 150
C: 220
D: 200
E: 160
F: 180
G: 230
H: 170
I: 210
J: 140

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an Aston Martin V8 Vantage car trying to negotiate a tightest unbanked curve. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when a car goes around a curve, it's all about centripetal acceleration. Right, because the car is moving along a circular path, so it needs a centripetal force which is provided by the friction between the tires and the road, I guess.

The problem states that the car has a lateral acceleration of 0.96g. Wait, lateral acceleration is the same as centripetal acceleration, right? So that's 0.96 times 9.8 m/s², which equals 9.4 m/s². Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the maximum without skidding out. So that's the maximum centripetal acceleration it can handle. So that value of 9.4 m/s² is the max a car can have in a curve without skidding.

But the question is about the tightest unbanked curve it can negotiate when moving at 40 m/s on level ground. So I need to relate this to the centripetal acceleration formula.

Centripetal acceleration a_c is given by v² divided by radius R. The formula is a = v² / R. So rearranging that, R would be v² divided by a. Because a is given as 9.4 m/s², and v is 40 m/s.

Wait, let me plug the numbers in. So v is 40, a is 9.4. So R = (40)^2 / 9.4. Let's calculate that.

40 squared is 1600. Then 1600 divided by 9.4. Hmm, let me do that division. 9.4 times 170 is 1600- wait, no, 9.4 times 170: 9.4 * 170 = (10 *170) - (0.6 *170) = 1700 - 102 = 1598. Oh, wait that's 170 would give 1598, which is just 2 less than 1600. So 1600 /9.4 is approximately 170.6... So about 170.6 meters.

Looking at the options, option H is 170. So the answer should be H, 170.

Wait, but wait a moment. The problem says it's the tightest unbanked curve. So does that mean the radius is determined by the lateral acceleration, which is the maximum it can take? Because the car is moving at a constant speed, so centripetal force is provided by the friction, and the lateral acceleration (which is the net centripetal) is given as 9.4 m/s². So yes, that's correct. So R would be 170, so option H.
</think>

To determine the radius \( R \) of the tightest unbanked curve the car can negotiate, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[
a_c = \frac{v^2}{R}
\]

Rearranging for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{v^2}{a_c}
\]

Given:
- Velocity \( v = 40 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Maximum centripetal acceleration \( a_c = 9.4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

Substituting the values:

\[
R = \frac{40^2}{9.4} = \frac{1600}{9.4} \approx 170.6 \, \text{m}
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 170 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
