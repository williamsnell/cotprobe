Okay, so I have this question about the Internal-External Control Scale and the differences between sex and race. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Internal-External Control Scale is a psychological test used to assess a person's ability to control their internal and external situations. It measures things like self-control, work performance, and emotional regulation. I think the scale categorizes people as either "more internal" or "more external" based on their performance.

Now, the question is asking about sex and race differences. I'm trying to recall if there are any established studies on this. I think some research has found differences, especially in certain groups. For example, I remember reading that men often perform better on this scale than women in some areas. But wait, I'm not sure about the specifics.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Women are more internal, blacks more external. That doesn't ring a bell. I think more internal isn't the case for women, and I don't recall blacks having more external. Also, the question is about sex differences, so comparing women to men and blacks to whites would make more sense.

Option B: No differences. That seems unlikely because the scale is designed to show differences based on individual traits.

Option C: Women more external, blacks more external. That contradicts what I remember. I think women do better, but I'm not sure if that's consistent across all subgroups.

Option D: Women more internal, blacks more internal. Again, I think women are more internal, so this might not be accurate.

Option E: No difference, but blacks more external. No, that doesn't seem right. I believe there are differences, especially in areas like emotional regulation.

Option F: Women more internal, whites more internal. Wait, this suggests that women are more internal than men, which aligns with what I thought before. But then it says whites are more internal than blacks. Does that make sense? I'm not certain, but it's a possibility.

Option G: No difference, but blacks more internal. No, that's opposite of what I remember.

Option H: Men more internal, blacks more internal. That doesn't fit because I think women are more internal.

Option I: Men more internal, blacks more internal. No, that can't be right. Both men and women might have similar internal abilities.

Option J: Men and women equally external, but blacks more internal. No, I don't think that's correct. There are significant differences.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. I believe that men tend to perform better on the Internal-External Control Scale than women. So women are less internal. But I'm not sure about the racial differences. I think there might be some differences in certain areas, but I'm not certain. For example, in some studies, it's found that women perform better than men across the board, but for certain traits, like emotional regulation, men might be better. But when it comes to race, I'm not sure if there are specific subgroups where one group is more internal or external than another.

Wait, another angle: the scale might have different norms for different groups. For example, maybe in the general population, men are more internal, but for a subgroup like blacks, the performance is higher in a way that makes them more external. But I'm not sure if that's a well-established finding.

Alternatively, perhaps the scale doesn't differentiate as much based on race as it does on gender, or maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall research. I think one study found that women outperform men on the scale, but I'm not sure about the racial aspects. Maybe in some races, men have better performance, but for the general population, women are better. I'm not certain.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer should reflect that men are more internal, and perhaps women are more internal than men. So options D and I suggest that. But I think the correct answer is that men are more internal than women, and I'm not sure about the racial differences. Alternatively, perhaps there's no significant difference in the scale between men and women, but that's not what the options say.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option I says men are more internal, blacks more internal. That suggests both men and blacks are more internal than women. But earlier, I thought women are more internal than men. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the scale categorizes people as more internal or external, and the differences are not consistent across the population across both sex and race. So maybe there's no significant difference in terms of both, but that's not an option.

Wait, the question is about sex and race differences. So, perhaps the scale is used to assess whether men and women have similar abilities or not. I think historically, it's been found that men perform better than women on this scale. So option E would be that there's no difference, which contradicts that.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option again.

Option D: Women more internal, blacks more internal. That would mean women are more internal than men, and blacks are more internal than women. The reasoning might be that both groups are more internal than men, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Option F: Women more internal, whites more internal. That suggests that women are more internal than men, which I think is correct, and whites are more internal than blacks. But I'm not sure if blacks are more internal than women. Wait, option F says whites are more internal than blacks, which would make whites more internal than blacks but less than women.

Alternatively, I'm not sure if blacks have a higher internal ability than women. Maybe it's the opposite.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is D. Because I remember that the scale's results show that men perform better than women, so women are less internal. But I'm not sure about the racial differences. Alternatively, maybe blacks are more internal than women, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: I recall reading that men are more internal, and that the scale's performance can vary by race. So maybe for a subgroup like blacks, men are more internal than women. So option I (men more internal, blacks more internal) might be correct.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember specific studies. I think a study found that men outperform women on the scale. So women are less internal than men. Then, regarding race, I think there might be some differences, but I'm not sure whether it's in terms of internal or external. I'm not certain about the exact findings.

Alternatively, perhaps the scale's results don't show significant differences between men and women, but that's not what the options say.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option I: Men are more internal than women and blacks are more internal than whites.

Option D: Women are more internal than men and blacks are more internal than whites.

What do I know? I think men are more internal. So options I and D suggest that.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a more concrete approach. I'll try to think about the possible answers.

The question is about sex and race differences on the scale. So, in the scale, the options would be looking for differences between men and women, and between different racial groups.

I think the correct answer is that men are more internal than women, and that for some racial groups, women are more internal than men. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: I've read that men have higher average scores on this scale than women. So women perform better, which would mean women are less internal. But that's not what any of the options say. Wait, noâ€”the options are about differences between men and women, and between races.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that men are more internal than women, but that's not an option. Looking at the options, option I says men are more internal than women. That would fit.

But wait, the question is about sex and race differences. So, perhaps both are being considered: gender and race differences.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the answers again.

Wait, another thought: the scale's results may show that men are more internal, but in certain racial groups, women are more internal. So for example, among blacks, women might perform better than men. So option F is about women being more internal than men, and whites more than blacks. That could be a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps blacks are more internal than whites, but that's not something I think is commonly found.

Wait, another approach: I'll try to think of the answer. The best option I can think of is that men are more internal than women, and that for some racial groups, women are more internal than men. So, perhaps option I is correct.

But wait, looking at the options again.

Option I: Men are more internal than women and blacks are more internal than whites.

Option D: Women are more internal than men and blacks are more internal than whites.

If the scale shows men are more internal, then option I is correct. But I'm not sure about the racial aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that men are more internal, and blacks are more internal than whites. So option F.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. I think I need to make a decision. Based on what I know, men are more internal than women. So the correct statement must be that men are more internal than women, and perhaps blacks are more internal than whites, or something else.

Looking at the options, option I says men are more internal than women, and blacks are more than whites. Option F says women are more than men, and whites are more than blacks.

I think the answer is that men are more internal than women, and perhaps blacks are more internal than whites. So option I.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the options.

Another angle: the scale is a self-reporting test, so it's possible that the results are not as straightforward.

Another thought: the scale may not have subgroups, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the scale's results show that men are more internal, and women are more internal than men in some areas, but not necessarily all.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but I think the correct answer is that men are more internal than women, and for certain racial subgroups, women are more internal than men. So option I. So the answer is I: Men are more internal than women and blacks are more internal than whites.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps option F is correct, because it says women are more internal than men, but I don't think that's what the scale indicates.

Wait, I think I should conclude that the correct answer is that men are more internal than women, and perhaps blacks are more internal than whites. So option I.

The Internal-External Control Scale measures individuals' ability to control internal and external situations. It categorizes people as "more internal" or "more external." Research suggests that men tend to perform better than women on this scale, indicating that women are more internal than men. However, there are no conclusive studies that show significant differences between racial groups. Based on the options provided, the most plausible answer is that men are more internal than women, and this pattern holds across all racial groups, including blacks. Therefore, the correct option is:

**I: Men are more internal than women and blacks are more internal than whites.**
