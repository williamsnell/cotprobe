Okay, so I have this math problem here about Gary's cows and horses. Let me read it again carefully. 

Gary has 72 cows on his farm. He has 6 times as many cows as he has horses. Then it gives me an equation: 72 ÷ h = 6, and I need to find how many horses, h, Gary has. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. 

Hmm, let's break this down. The problem says Gary has 6 times as many cows as horses. So, if I let h be the number of horses, then the number of cows would be 6 times h. But wait, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the equation given is 72 ÷ h =6. Let me think about this. 

So, 72 is the number of cows. The equation is 72 ÷ h =6. So, if I rearrange this equation, I can find h. Let me do that. 

Multiplying both sides by h gives 72 = 6h. Then, dividing both sides by 6, I get h = 72 ÷6. 72 divided by 6 is 12. So h should be 12. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 6 horses. That's not matching. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the relationship. The problem says Gary has 6 times as many cows as horses. So, cows = 6 * horses. So if cows are 72, then 72 =6h. So h=12. But 12 isn't an option. Wait, let me check the options again. 

Wait, wait, the options are A to J. Let me check the numbers again. The options are:

A: 24
B:48
C:36
D:60
E:432
F:18
G:78
H:66
I:12
J:6

Oh, I see. Option I is 12. So I thought I got 12, which is option I. But wait, the initial problem says Gary has 72 cows, which is 6 times the number of horses. So 72=6h → h=12. So the correct answer should be I:12 horses. But wait, the options don't have 12 as the correct answer. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-express the equation. The problem says, "He has 6 times as many cows as he has horses." Which means cows = 6 * horses. So cows =6h. Given that cows are 72, 72 =6h → h=12. So that's correct. So the correct answer should be option I:12.

Wait, but looking back, the user wrote the equation as 72 ÷ h =6. That would imply that h=72/6=12. So yeah, that's correct. So the answer is I:12 horses.
</think>

The problem states that Gary has 72 cows, which are 6 times the number of horses. The equation 72 ÷ h =6 leads to h=12. Among the options, option I is 12, which matches our calculation.

Answer: I
