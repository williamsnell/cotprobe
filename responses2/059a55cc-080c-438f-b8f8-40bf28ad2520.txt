Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because Euler's Method is a new topic for me. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem is: y'' + x y' + y = 0, with initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3. I need to approximate y(0.2) using Euler's Method. The options are A through J, each with a different number.

Wait, Euler's Method is for first-order differential equations, right? But here it's a second-order equation. Oh, right, I remember that Euler's Method is typically applied to first-order ODEs, but maybe I can reduce the second-order equation to a system of first-order equations.

So, let's think about that. Let me set up the system. Let me denote y' as another function, say z. Then, the original equation becomes:

y'' + x y' + y = 0
But y'' is the derivative of y', which is z'. So, z' + x z + y = 0.

Now, I have two variables: y and z. So, the system is:

y' = z
z' = -x z - y

That makes sense. Now, I can apply Euler's Method to this system.

Euler's Method for systems works by taking the current values of y and z, and then using the derivatives to estimate the next step. The formula is:

y_{n+1} = y_n + h * y'_n
z_{n+1} = z_n + h * z'_n

Where h is the step size. So, in this case, h is 0.2 because we're moving from x=0 to x=0.2 in steps of 0.2. Wait, but wait, we're using Euler's Method and it's a single step, right? Because the problem is to find y at x=0.2, which is just one step from x=0.

Wait, but wait again, initial conditions are at x=0. So, for the first step, n=0, x0=0, y0=2, z0=3.

So, let's compute y1 and z1.

First, compute y'_0, which is z0 = 3, and z'_0 is -x0 * z0 - y0.

x0 is 0, so that term is 0. So z'_0 = -(0)*3 - 2 = -2.

So, the Euler step is:

y1 = y0 + h * y'_0 = 2 + 0.2 * 3 = 2 + 0.6 = 2.6
z1 = z0 + h * z'_0 = 3 + 0.2*(-2) = 3 - 0.4 = 2.6

Wait, so after one step, y1 is 2.6 and z1 is 2.6.

But wait, the question asks for y(0.2), which is exactly one step, so the approximation would be 2.6. But looking at the options, option A is 2.67, H is 3.14, etc. Hmm, but that's not matching. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, perhaps I should re-examine the method. Maybe I should consider the step size differently. Oh, wait, Euler's Method can be applied even for second-order ODEs, but sometimes people convert the problem into a system of first-order ODEs and apply Euler's step.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Euler's Method is a first-order method, meaning that the error is proportional to the step size. So, for a step size h=0.2, the approximation after one step should be accurate to the first order. So why am I not getting one of the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me double-check.

The system is:

y' = z

z' = -x z - y

So, for the first step:

y1 = y0 + h * y'_0 = 2 + 0.2*3 = 2.6

z1 = z0 + h * z'_0. What's z'_0? It's -x0*z0 - y0 = -(0)*3 -2 = -2.

So, z1 = 3 + 0.2*(-2) = 3 -0.4 = 2.6

Wait, so that's correct. So y(0.2) is 2.6, but the options don't have 2.6. The closest is option A: 2.67, which is 2.67. Hmm, but wait, maybe I messed up the step size. Oh wait, perhaps the step size is 0.1 instead of 0.2? Because sometimes people use h=0.1 for one step.

Wait, no, the problem says to approximate y(0.2), so it's one step of size 0.2, so that should be correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

y1 = 2 + 0.2 * 3 = 2 + 0.6 = 2.6.

z1 = 3 + 0.2*(-2) = 3 - 0.4 = 2.6.

So that's correct. So y(0.2) is 2.6, but the options have 2.67 as option A. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Euler's Method is an approximation, so perhaps I should compute more steps. Wait, no, because the problem asks for y at x=0.2, which is only one step.

Wait, maybe the step size is 0.1? Oh wait, the question says to use Euler's Method to approximate y(0.2). So if the step size is 0.1, then we'll take two steps to reach x=0.2.

Ah, that's it! I've assumed the step size is 0.2, but perhaps it's 0.1. Let me reevaluate.

So, the problem says to approximate y(0.2). So the interval from x=0 to x=0.2 is 0.2. So if we use step size h=0.1, then we take two steps: first from 0 to 0.1, then from 0.1 to 0.2.

But wait, let me re-read the problem. It says, "use Euler's Method to calculate the approximation of y(0.2)". It doesn't specify the step size, but I think Euler's Method can be applied with any step size, and for each step, it's a first-order approximation. So perhaps the step size is 0.1, leading to two steps.

Wait, but I thought the options don't show a 2.6. Let me recalculate with step size 0.1.

Step 0:
x0 = 0, y0 =2, z0=3.

Step 1: x = 0.1, y1, z1.

Compute y'_0 = z0 =3, z'_0 = -x0 z0 - y0 = -0*3 -2 = -2.

y1 = y0 + h * y'_0 = 2 + 0.1 *3 = 2.3

z1 = z0 + h * z'_0 =3 + 0.1*(-2) = 3 -0.2 =2.8

Now, step 2: x=0.2, y2, z2.

Compute y'_1 = z1=2.8, z'_1 = -x1 z1 - y1.

x1 is 0.1, so -0.1 * 2.8 -2.3 = -0.28 -2.3= -2.58.

y2 = y1 + h * y'_1 =2.3 + 0.1 *2.8= 2.3+0.28=2.58.

z2 = z1 + h * z'_1 =2.8 +0.1*(-2.58)=2.8 -0.258=2.542.

So, y(0.2) is approximately 2.58, which is option F.

Ah, so that's why 2.58 is an option. So, if the step size is 0.1, then the approximation is 2.58. But wait, the problem says to use Euler's Method without specifying a step size, but for y(0.2), one step would be 0.2. So, perhaps the step size is 0.2, which would yield y1=2.6, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes a step size of 0.1, leading to y(0.2) being 2.58. So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify the step size. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem is: y'' + x y' + y = 0, y(0)=2, y'(0)=3. Approximate y(0.2) using Euler's Method.

The question says to "use Euler's Method to calculate the approximation", so perhaps the step size is 0.2, but in that case, the answer is 2.6, which is not among the options. So perhaps the step size is 0.1, and the correct approximation is 2.58.

Wait, but the options include 2.58 as option F. So perhaps the step size is 0.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use Euler's method with a single step of h=0.2. Then, the approximation would indeed be 2.6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the step size is 0.2, and the correct answer is 2.6, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects a single step, and the correct answer is 2.6, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to take two steps of h=0.1, leading to 2.58, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different version where the step size is 0.1. So, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a second-order equation, but I've converted it to a system, and applied Euler's method step by step.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to take one step with a step size of 0.2, using the formula correctly, but in that case, the first step is h=0.2.

Wait, but in that case, the approximation is 2.6, but that's not an option. So perhaps the step size is 0.1, leading to F. So, given the options, F is 2.58, which is the correct approximation when using two steps of 0.1 each.

So, perhaps the step size is 0.1, so the correct answer is F.

To solve the problem, we convert the second-order differential equation into a system of first-order equations and apply Euler's Method.

The system is:
\[
\begin{cases}
y' = z, \\
z' = -x z - y.
\end{cases}
\]
Initial conditions: \( y(0) = 2 \), \( z(0) = 3 \).

Using Euler's Method with a step size \( h = 0.1 \):

1. **First step (x=0 to x=0.1):**
   - \( y'_0 = z_0 = 3 \)
   - \( z'_0 = -0 \cdot 3 - 2 = -2 \)
   - \( y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot y'_0 = 2 + 0.1 \cdot 3 = 2.3 \)
   - \( z_1 = z_0 + h \cdot z'_0 = 3 + 0.1 \cdot (-2) = 2.8 \)

2. **Second step (x=0.1 to x=0.2):**
   - \( y'_1 = z_1 = 2.8 \)
   - \( z'_1 = -0.1 \cdot 2.8 - 2.3 = -0.28 - 2.3 = -2.58 \)
   - \( y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot y'_1 = 2.3 + 0.1 \cdot 2.8 = 2.58 \)

Thus, the approximation of \( y(0.2) \) is \( 2.58 \), which corresponds to option F.

**Answer: F**
