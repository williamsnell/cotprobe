Alright, so I've got this question about embryonic cleavage, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement about embryonic cleavage is incorrect. The options are A to D. I remember that embryonic cleavage is a process where an embryo breaks into roughly equal parts called blastomeres. It's a key part of development, especially in mammals.

Option A says the presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. Hmm. I think that's right. Yolk surrounding the embryo might prevent the cleavage process from happening because it could hinder the movement of the cells. But wait, isn't there some research suggesting that the yolk might actually promote cleavage? Or maybe it's the opposite? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, if the yolk is present, it might provide some protection, but perhaps not interfere with the process. Or maybe the yolk actually causes the cleavage to occur more readily. I'm not sure about this one. Let me think again. I think the presence of yolk inhibits cleavage because the yolk could block the movement of the cells. So A might be true.

Option B states that telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Telolecithal eggs are those that form the outer layer of the blastomeres, right? Meroblastic cleavage is when the egg undergoes cleavage with the formation of the inner cell mass and then the blastocyst. So this sounds correct. So B is a true statement.

Option C says the vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. The vegetal pole is the outer layer, the animal pole is the inner. I remember reading that the inner layers (animal pole) cleave faster. Also, the inner cell mass is more mature, so it might cleave more quickly. So C is probably a true statement.

Option D says that rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. Wait, the cleavage process involves mitosis, but the divisions are not direct. The early cleavage divisions create the inner cell mass, which then undergoes mitosis to form the blastomeres. So D sounds correct. Because the cleavage itself is the division, but it's the formation of the inner cell mass that leads to the blastomeres. Or is D incorrect? I'm not so sure. The process is that the cleavage (mitosis) creates the inner cell mass, which then undergoes mitosis again to form the blastomeres. So the initial cleavage divisions create the inner cell mass, which then undergo mitosis. So D says the divisions directly give the blastomeres. Wait, the question is about the presence of cleavage divisions directly giving the blastomeres. So if the divisions are the process of cleavage (which is mitosis), then the initial divisions (A and B) are the ones that create the inner cell mass, which then divide into blastomeres. So D's statement is correct because the divisions (mitosis) lead to the blastomeres. Or is D incorrect because it's the presence of the cleavage divisions themselves that lead to the blastomeres? This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe D is correct because the process of cleavage (mitosis) leads to the formation of the inner cell mass, which then cleaves to form the blastomeres. So D is a true statement.

Wait, but the question is which statement is NOT true. So if any of these are incorrect, I need to spot that.

Wait, I thought that the presence of yolk (A) inhibits cleavage. But I'm not entirely sure. I've read that the presence of a yolk might actually promote cleavage because the yolk helps in the movement of the cells. For example, if the yolk is present, it might not block the cleavage but rather protect it. So A might be false. Or perhaps the presence of yolk doesn't inhibit. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of other sources. Oh, wait, I remember that in some animals, including mice, the presence of a yolk actually inhibits cleavage. Because the yolk could block the movement. Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's not a factor in some species.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the yolk doesn't inhibit cleavage but causes it to proceed. Because the presence of a yolk might provide some protection, but the actual cleavage still occurs. So statement A could be incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of my notes. Oh wait, actually, I remember that in most animals, the yolk doesn't inhibit cleavage. It actually supports the process. So A is incorrect because the presence of yolk does not inhibit cleavage.

Wait, but I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. The yolk surrounding the embryo is considered to be a layer that might inhibit movement. For example, in the case of the mouse, the presence of a yolk in the mother's oocyte might inhibit cleavage. But I'm not sure. Or is it the opposite? I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the yolk is a factor in some cases. Like, in the case of the mouse, the presence of a yolk in the oocyte inhibits cleavage. So if that's true, then A would be a true statement, meaning it's not the incorrect one.

Wait, but the question is about the statement that is NOT true. So if any of the statements are false, that's the one we need.

Let me re-express each option:

A: Presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. If the yolk inhibits, then A is true. If it doesn't, then it's false.

B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Yes, correct.

C: Vegetal pole cleaves more readily. Yes, correct.

D: Cleavage divisions directly create blastomeres. Hmm, cleavage divisions are the process of cell division. The initial cleavage divisions (like in the blastocyst) create the inner cell mass. Then, the inner cell mass undergoes mitosis to form the blastomeres. So the presence of cleavage (mitosis) leads to the blastomeres. So D is correct.

So if all statements are correct except one, which one is not true.

If A is correct, then the incorrect statement is another.

Wait, another possibility: Some sources say that in the early cleavage, the presence of the yolk inhibits the movement of the cells, but the actual cleavage occurs. So statement A is true.

If that's the case, then all except one are true. Which would leave which option as the incorrect statement.

Wait, if all options are correct except one, then the incorrect statement is the one that's not true. But the question is which is NOT true.

Wait, hang on. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's validity.

Option A: Presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.

If the presence of the yolk inhibits cleavage, then A is true. But I thought that the presence of a yolk might actually promote cleavage. So if A is the wrong statement, that would be the answer.

Wait, another approach: if the presence of the yolk inhibits cleavage, then A is correct, so it's not the incorrect statement. But is that true? I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the yolk actually allows the inner layers to form. Or perhaps some animals have yolk that inhibits cleavage, while others promote it.

Wait, let me think about the mice. In mice, the presence of the yolk in the oocyte is thought to inhibit cleavage. In other animals, like humans, the presence of the yolk might not be as significant, but perhaps sometimes the yolk is present. So in this case, the statement in A is that the presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. So if in humans, the statement is correct (yes, yolk inhibits), then A is true. So the incorrect statement would be something else.

But the question is which is NOT true. So if I've got all but one correct, the incorrect one is the wrong option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option C: Vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily. That's correct, as I remember that inner layers cleave more quickly than the outer.

Option B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Correct, as that's how the early cleavage works.

Option D: Cleavage divisions directly give rise to blastomeres. Cleavage is the process that creates the inner cell mass (meroblastic), which then undergoes mitosis. So cleavage divisions (meroblastic) are the initial divisions. The divisions that create the inner cell mass are a result of cleavage. So D's statement is correct because cleavage divisions create the inner cell mass, which then undergo mitosis. So D is correct.

Which leaves option A as the only possible incorrect statement.

Wait, but is the presence of the yolk in the mother's oocyte actually inhibiting cleavage in all cases? Or does it vary? For example, in some species, the presence of yolk may not inhibit, but in others it does. So the statement in A might not always be true. But the question is about which statement is NOT true, implying that it's not correct in general.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which of the following statements is NOT true." So even if the statement is sometimes true, it's not always true, making it the incorrect option.

Wait, that's a possibility. So the incorrect statement is the one that is not always true.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option again.

Option A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. If that's true, then A is correct. But if it's false, then A is the incorrect statement.

So if the presence of the yolk does not inhibit, then A is wrong. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a yolk would cause the cleavage to occur more readily, or not? I'm getting so confused. Let me try to think of some examples.

In mice, the presence of yolk in the oocyte was thought to inhibit cleavage. In this case, statement A is correct. But what if the presence of the yolk actually promotes cleavage? Then A is incorrect.

If that's the case, then A is the incorrect statement.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure.

But the question is which statement is NOT true. So what is the incorrect one among the options.

Wait, another approach: the options are:

A: Yolk inhibits cleavage.

B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage.

C: Vegetal pole cleaves more readily.

D: Cleavage divisions directly give rise to blastomeres.

I think that the correct answer is A. Because I remember that the presence of the yolk inhibits cleavage. Or perhaps not? Some references say that the presence of the yolk may actually promote cleavage.

Wait, let me try to find some info.

Upon a quick recall, in mouse's oocyte, the presence of a yolk in the oocyte inhibits cleavage. So in that case, the statement A is correct.

But if the yolk inhibits, then the statement is correct. So A would be a correct statement, so the incorrect one is another.

But the question is which statement is NOT true. So if all are correct except one, that one is the answer.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the process again.

The cleavage process creates inner cell mass, which then undergoes mitosis to form the blastomeres. So the initial cleavage divisions create the inner cell mass. So cleavage (division) is the process that creates the inner cell mass. So the statement D says that the cleavage divisions directly give rise to blastomeres. But cleavage divisions are the process that creates the inner cell mass, not the blastomeres themselves. So D is correct because the cleavage divisions (mitosis) create the inner cell mass, which then divides into blastomeres.

So D is correct.

So back to the options, the only statement that I'm uncertain about is A. So perhaps A is correct, but what if the presence of the yolk actually promotes cleavage?

Wait, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again: in the mouse, the presence of the yolk in the oocyte does inhibit cleavage. So statement A claims yolk inhibits cleavage, which in this case would be correct. So A is a correct statement, making it not the incorrect one.

If that's the case, then the incorrect statement would be another.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the yolk doesn't inhibit cleavage, making A incorrect.

But I'm getting stuck in circles. Maybe I should just proceed with the assumption that option A is incorrect, making it the correct answer for the question.

To determine which statement about embryonic cleavage is NOT true, each option was carefully analyzed:

### Option A:
"The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage."  
In some animals, such as mice, the presence of the yolk in the oocyte is associated with inhibition of cleavage. However, in other cases, the yolk may promote cleavage. Since the statement does not explicitly state whether the presence of yolk generally inhibits cleavage, it is unclear if this is always true. However, it is plausible that the statement is correct in the context of mice, where the yolk does inhibit cleavage.

### Option B:
"Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage."  
Telolecithal eggs are the outer layers of the blastomeres, and their formation is described as undergoing meroblastic cleavage. This is a well-established process in embryonic development. Therefore, this statement is true.

### Option C:
"The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole."  
The inner layers of the blastomeres, such as the animal pole, cleave more readily than the outer layers (vegetal pole). This is a well-documented feature of embryonic cleavage. Thus, this statement is true.

### Option D:
"The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres."  
Cleavage involves mitosis, which is the process of cell division. The initial cleavage divisions create the inner cell mass, which then undergoes mitosis to form the blastomeres. Therefore, this statement is true.

### Conclusion:
All the statements except one are true. The likely incorrect statement is **A**, as the presence of yolk does not universally inhibit cleavage. However, the reasoning for this choice is based on the assumption that the statement is correct in the context of mice, where the yolk does inhibit cleavage.
