Okay, so I've got this question about calculating a percentage discount. Hmm, let's see. The question says the calculator has a list price of $10.00 and the seller is offering a $4.00 trade discount. I need to find the percentage of this discount.

Wait, I remember that the trade discount percentage is calculated by taking the discount amount and dividing it by the list price, then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. Oh right, so the formula is (Discount / List Price) * 100.

So here, the discount is $4.00 and the list price is $10.00. Plugging those numbers in, it's 4 divided by 10. Let me do the math. 4 รท 10 equals 0.4. Then, multiplying by 100 gives me 40%. 

Wait a second, but I should double-check if I'm applying the discount correctly. Sometimes discounts can be compounded, but in this case, I think it's straightforward. The discount is a simple percentage off the list price. So yes, 40% makes sense.

The percentage of the discount is calculated as (4 / 10) * 100 = 40%. 

Answer: F: 40%
