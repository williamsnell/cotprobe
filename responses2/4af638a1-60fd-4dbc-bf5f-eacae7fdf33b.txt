Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let me read it again. It says that 46% of the loci in a species' gene pool are heterozygous, and I need to find the average homozygosity. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

Wait, I remember that in population genetics, the Hardy-Weinberg principle helps with allele frequencies. Oh right, but wait, that's in a diploid organism with no selection, mutation, or migration. But wait, the question doesn't specify any of those, so maybe we're supposed to use H-W assumptions for the calculation? Or perhaps it's a more straightforward approach.

Let me think about the terms. Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles at a locus. So, in a population, the sum of homozygous and heterozygous should be 100% (or 1 in decimal). So, if 46% are heterozygous, what about the homozygous parts?

Homozygosity is the proportion of loci where both alleles are the same. So, for a locus, if it's homozygous, it's either AA or aa. But wait, the average homozygosity would be (p² + q²), where p and q are the allele frequencies. Right? Because for each locus, the probability of being AA is p² and aa is q², and since the two are mutually exclusive, you add them for the proportion of homozygotes.

But wait, the question is giving me the percentage of heterozygotes. Let me denote H as heterozygous percentage, and E as the sum of the squares of the allele frequencies (so E = p² + q²). Since H + E = 100%, and H is given as 46%, so E would be 54% (100 -46 = 54). So, the average homozygosity is 54%, which is option F.

Wait, but why? Let me double-check. Let me do the math. If H = 46% (so 0.46), then the sum of p² + q² is 0.54. The average homozygosity is 0.54, which is 54%.

Alternatively, thinking about the formula, the heterozygous frequency is 2pq. So, if 46% are heterozygous, then 0.46 = 2pq. But I don't need to find p and q individually because the question is about the proportion of homozygotes, which is p² + q² = 1 - 2pq. Oh wait, that's exactly 1 - H. So, 1 - 0.46 = 0.54, which is 54% as the homozygosity.

So the answer should be option F, 54%.
</think>

To determine the average homozygosity of the species given that 46% of the loci are heterozygous, we can use the relationship between heterozygosity (H) and homozygosity (E). The sum of heterozygosity and homozygosity equals 100%, so:

\[
H + E = 100\%
\]

Given \( H = 46\% \), we can calculate \( E \) as follows:

\[
E = 100\% - H = 100\% - 46\% = 54\%
\]

Thus, the average homozygosity of the species is 54%, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
