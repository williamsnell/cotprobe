Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about passive personality jurisdiction. Hmm, I remember that passive personality is a concept in law, especially in criminal law, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

Passive personality jurisdiction refers to a situation where the crime is committed in a place where the individual is not registered or hasn't registered yet. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh right, it's about the jurisdiction being determined by the fact that the individual is not registered, but in a different jurisdiction than the one where they're registered. So, if someone is not registered in their home country, and they commit a crime there, the jurisdiction would be based on their nationality. Because the law in their home country doesn't apply, so the law in their country is considered to be the jurisdiction.

Looking at the options, option H says it's based on the country of residence of the offender. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. But wait, let me make sure. The question is about passive personality jurisdiction. So, I think it's about the nationality determining the jurisdiction in this case.

Other options: Option A is based on the country where the person was registered. But that's where the person was registered, not where they're not. So that would be the opposite. Option B is based on nationality, which seems correct. Option C is about the relationship between the victim and the offender. I don't think that's the case; passive personality jurisdiction is about the individual's registration status. Option D is based on the victim's nationality, which doesn't make sense. Option E is based on the severity of the offence, which is about the crime's impact, not the jurisdiction. Option F is about the country planned, which doesn't fit. Option G is about international law, which doesn't apply to passive personality jurisdiction. Option I is about where the offence was committed, which is more about the crime location, not the personality. Option J is about the witness's nationality, which is irrelevant here.

So the correct answer should be H: It is jurisdiction based on the country of residence of the offender.

The correct answer is H: It is jurisdiction based on the country of residence of the offender. This is because passive personality jurisdiction refers to a situation where the individual is not registered in their home country, and the law in their country becomes the jurisdiction for the crime committed there.
