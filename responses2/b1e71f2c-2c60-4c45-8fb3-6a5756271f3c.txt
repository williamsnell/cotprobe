Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about a mass-spring-damper system. The question is asking for the damping coefficient gamma (γ) that makes the system critically damped. I remember that critical damping is a state where the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. 

So, the system has a mass of 8 pounds, and it stretches the spring 1.5 inches. Wait, but I think the units here are in inches, but the answer options are in lb·s/ft. Oh right, because when you're dealing with units, especially in mass-spring systems, you need to convert units properly.

First, I should probably find the spring constant k. The spring stretches 1.5 inches under a mass of 8 pounds. Remember, weight is mass times gravity, but I think for spring constants, the units are typically in pounds per foot because of the units involved in damping coefficients. But wait, let me get the formula right. 

Spring force is given by Hooke's law: F = kx. Here, F is the weight of the mass, which is 8 lb. The stretch x is 1.5 inches, so I need to convert that to feet because the answer options are in lb·s/ft. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1.5 inches is 0.125 feet.

So, k = F / x = 8 lb / 0.125 ft = 64 lb/ft. That's the spring constant.

Now, for a mass-spring-damper system, the damping coefficient gamma is related to the mass, stiffness, and the critical damping condition. The formula for critical damping is when the damping coefficient is 2 times the square root of (mass times spring constant). The formula is γ = 2√(m k). 

But wait, I need to make sure about the units. The mass m is given as 8 lb. Wait, wait, mass is in pounds, which is a unit of force. Oh, right, mass is in slugs when in English units because 1 slug is the mass that accelerates at 1 ft/s² when a force of 1 pound is applied. But I'm mixing the units here. Let me think again.

Wait no, in the formula for critical damping, the mass should be in slugs. But here, the mass is given in pounds. That's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I should express the mass in slugs.

Wait, the formula I know is γ = 2 * sqrt(m * k). But wait, in that formula, what are m and k? Oh, wait, m is mass in slugs, k is spring constant in pounds per foot.

But in this problem, the mass is given in pounds, not slugs. Oh, so I need to convert that. Because the unit for mass in the critical damping formula is in slugs.

How do I convert from lb (pounds) to slugs? The conversion factor is 1 slug = 32.174 pounds (since weight in pounds is mass in slugs times g, and g is about 32.174 ft/s²). So, 1 lb = 1/32.174 slugs.

So, the mass m in slugs is 8 lb / 32.174 lb/slug = approximately 0.2484 slugs.

Wait, perhaps I should keep it exact. Let's compute it precisely. 8 divided by 32.174. Well, 32.174 is 32 + 0.174. So 8/32 is 0.25, and 0.174 is about 0.174/32 is 0.0054375. So 0.25 - 0.0054375 = 0.2445625. So m ≈ 0.2445625 slugs.

Now, the spring constant k is 64 lb/ft, as I found earlier.

So plug into γ = 2 * sqrt(m * k) = 2 * sqrt(0.2445625 * 64).

Let me calculate the product inside the square root: 0.2445625 *64.

Hmm, 0.2445625 *64 = ?

Well, 0.2 *64=12.8, 0.0445625 *64= around 2.853, so total approx 15.653.

Wait, more accurately:

0.2445625 *64 = (0.2 + 0.04 + 0.0045625) *64

= (0.2*64) + (0.04*64) + (0.0045625*64)

0.2 *64=12.8

0.04 *64=2.56

0.0045625 *64= 0.29125

Adding them: 12.8 +2.56=15.36 +0.29125=15.65125.

So sqrt(15.65125) is approximately 3.956.

So γ=2 *3.956 ≈7.912.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 7.9 lb·s/ft. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait a second! Wait, I think I got the formula wrong. Because in the formula for critical damping, sometimes it's written as γ = 2 * sqrt(m k), but perhaps the mass is in slugs, and the units were correctly considered.

Wait, but let me think about units. The damping coefficient gamma has units of lb·s/ft. Let me verify the units in the formula.

Wait, the formula is gamma = 2 * sqrt(m * k). Let's check the units of m and k.

m is in slugs (mass). k is in lb/ft (spring constant). So the product m * k would have units of (slug * lb/ft). But wait, slug is mass, lb is force, and ft is distance. So (slug * (force/ft)) = slug * (mass * g)/ft. Since slug = mass (mass units), and g is ft/s², so slug * (mass * (ft/s²))/ft = (mass)^2 * ft/s² / ft = mass² * s^-2.

Wait, but I'm not sure that's helping. Alternatively, let me think about the units in the formula for critical damping.

Wait, another approach: The characteristic equation for a mass-spring-damper system is m x'' + γ x' + k x = 0.

The damping is critical when the discriminant is zero, so (γ² - 4 m k) = 0 → γ² =4 m k → γ=2 sqrt(m k).

So the units of gamma would be sqrt(m *k) → units of mass times spring constant, but then what?

Wait, mass (m) has units of slug, spring constant (k) is lb/ft. So m *k has units of slug * (lb/ft).

But 1 lb = 32.174 ft/s² * m, since F = m g. 

So, substitution: m *k = m * (m g) / ft → because k is lb/ft = (m * g) / ft (since F = m g)

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me think in terms of the product m *k.

m is in slugs, k is in lb/ft. So m * k would have units of slug * (lb/ft) → slug is mass, lb is force (mass times g). So (slug * (slug * g )) / ft → slug² * g / ft.

But this doesn't immediately make the units of gamma. Let me think about the units of gamma.

Gamma is in lb·s/ft. So let's compute the units of 2 * sqrt(m k):

m is in slugs → slug.

k is in lb/ft → lb/ft.

m *k → slug * (lb/ft) = slug * (slug * g / ft) → slug² * g / ft.

So sqrt(m k) → sqrt( slug² * g / ft ) → slug * sqrt(g / ft).

But sqrt(g) is s, and sqrt(1/ft) is 1/√ft.

So sqrt(mk) → slug * s / sqrt( ft )

Then, gamma, which is 2 * sqrt(mk), would have units of slug * s / sqrt( ft )

But wait, the units should result in lb·s/ft. Because gamma is in lb·s/ft.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for critical damping in terms of the units given. The formula for gamma is 2 sqrt( m k ), but the units must come out to lb·s/ft.

So perhaps let me express m in slugs, and k in lb/ft.

Compute 2 * sqrt( m * k ) = 2 * sqrt( (slug) * (lb/ft) )

But I need the units of the right hand side to be lb·s/ft.

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I should instead consider that the correct formula for critical damping is when damping coefficient gamma equals 2 * sqrt( (m) (k) ) ), but perhaps I've misapplied the units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, m is 8 lb. Wait, but m is in slugs. So to find m in slugs, it's 8 lb / (32.174 lb/slug) ) → m is approximately 0.2484 slugs.

k is 64 lb/ft.

So m * k = 0.2484 * 64 = 15.8544.

Square root is sqrt(15.8544) ≈3.9816.

Multiply by 2: γ ≈7.963 lb·s/ft.

Looking at the options, none are exactly 8 lb·s/ft. The options are A:10, B:2, C:4, D:14, E:6, F:20, G:16, H:18, I:12, J:8.

Hmm, so none are close to 8.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. I'm using the formula for critical damping, but let's think again. Another approach: the damping coefficient for critical damping is given by γ = 2 * sqrt(m * k). But wait, perhaps I should have used the mass in kg instead of slugs? No, because the units given are in lb, which is metric, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should look at the problem again. The problem states that the mass is 8 lb, which is in pounds, but in the mass-spring system, mass is in slugs. So I think I made a mistake there.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for critical damping is γ = 2 * sqrt(m * k), but the mass is in slugs. But when m is in lb, that's a unit that doesn't match. So maybe I should use the mass in slugs, even though it's given in pounds.

Wait, but the mass is given as 8 lb. Oh wait, no, the 8 lb is the weight. So, mass is weight divided by g. So mass is 8 lb / 32.174 ≈ 0.2484 slugs.

Ah, yes, so that's correct. So the mass is 0.2484 slugs.

So m * k = 0.2484 *64 =15.8544.

Square root: 3.9816.

Multiply by 2: 7.963, which is approximately 8 lb·s/ft.

Looking at the options, J is 8 lb·s/ft.

Wait, but option J is 8. So the correct answer should be J.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation. 8 lb is the weight, mass is 8 lb / g. g is 32.174, so mass is 0.2484 slugs.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation leads to gamma ≈8 lb·s/ft.

So the correct answer is J.

To determine the damping coefficient \( \gamma \) for which the system is critically damped, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Spring Constant (\( k \))**:  
   The mass stretches the spring 1.5 inches under a weight of 8 lb. Converting inches to feet:  
   \[
   x = 1.5 \, \text{inches} = 0.125 \, \text{ft}.
   \]  
   Using Hooke's law, \( k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{8 \, \text{lb}}{0.125 \, \text{ft}} = 64 \, \text{lb/ft} \).

2. **Mass in Slugs**:  
   The mass is given as 8 lb, which is a unit of weight. To convert to mass in slugs (since the formula for critical damping uses mass in slugs), we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{slug} = \frac{1}{g} \, \text{lb} \), where \( g \approx 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \). Thus,  
   \[
   m = \frac{8 \, \text{lb}}{32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2} \approx 0.2484 \, \text{slugs}.
   \]

3. **Critical Damping Condition**:  
   For critical damping, the damping coefficient \( \gamma \) is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = 2 \sqrt{mk}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( m \approx 0.2484 \, \text{slugs} \) and \( k = 64 \, \text{lb/ft} \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 2 \sqrt{(0.2484)(64)}.
   \]  
   First, calculate the product inside the square root:  
   \[
   (0.2484)(64) \approx 15.8544.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{15.8544} \approx 3.9816.
   \]  
   Finally, multiply by 2:  
   \[
   \gamma \approx 2 \times 3.9816 \approx 7.963 \, \text{lb·s/ft}.
   \]  

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( \gamma \) is approximately 7.963 lb·s/ft. Among the given options, the closest match is \( \gamma = 8 \, \text{lb·s/ft} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
