Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about urban models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my urban planning, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking which model theorizes that high-rent areas grow outward along major highways, with lower-rent people taking over one after another. The options are A to J, each a different model. I remember that urban models are ways to explain how cities develop and change.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Star model. I think the star model suggests that a few central areas (like a star in the sky) are the most developed, and as people move out, they end up in these central hubs. So high-rent areas are at the center, and lower ones are peripheral. But does this fit the question about sequential takeover? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Option B: Ribbon model. I'm not too familiar with the ribbon model. It might be related to the core-periphery model, but I can't remember exactly. I think it's about areas where high-density areas are in the center, and the rest are connected via a ribbon shape. But the question says high-rent areas grow outward, so maybe not.

Option C: Urban realms model. I'm not sure about this one either. It might be a newer model, but I don't recall it specifically.

Option D: Sector model. That's where cities are divided into sectors, like residential, commercial, etc., each growing separately. Doesn't seem to fit the question about sequential takeover.

Option E: Concentric zone model. Concentric zones are like circles around a central point, each representing a certain radius. The innermost area is the highest concentration. So high-rent areas are at the center, and lower ones are in the outer zones. This sounds like it matches the question. It's about concentric zones, so it's about high-rent areas growing outward, and lower-rent taking over as you move outward.

Option F: Urban sprawl model. Urban sprawl is when people move from the city center to the outskirts. It's a process where high-rent areas expand, and lower-rent areas are developed. So this fits the question. High-rent areas grow outward, and lower-rent take over. So F could be the answer.

Option G: Core-periphery model. This model has a central core and periphery. High-rent areas are in the core, and lower-rent in the periphery. But it's sequential in the sense that higher concentric zones are built first, but does it model sequential takeover? Maybe, but I think the core periphery is more about the arrangement, not the order of land use change.

Option H: Multiple nuclei model. I think this is similar to the core periphery but has multiple centers. So high-rent areas are around multiple nuclei, which themselves are arranged in a network. Not sure if that's sequential.

Option I: Matrix model. The matrix model divides the city into zones and zones of development. I'm not sure about the exact details, but I'm thinking it's more about the layers, which might relate to concentric zones.

Option J: Central place model. This model uses central places, which are the most important locations in the city. High-rent areas might be central, and lower-rent are peripheral. But the question mentions sequential takeover, which might not fit central places as much as concentric zones.

Wait, let me think again about the question. The question is about high-rent areas growing outward and lower-rent taking over one after another. So the model should represent areas from the center expanding outward, with the inner areas being more developed.

Concentric zones (Option E) fit this because the innermost zone is the highest concentration, and as you go outward, the density decreases. So high-rent areas are the innermost, then the next ring, etc. Lower-rent would be the outer rings, taking over as people move outward.

And the urban sprawl model (Option F) is a broader concept. Urban sprawl is the process where people move from the city center to the outskirts. So high-rent areas expand, and lower-rent take over. So both F and E could fit, but the question is specifically about the model that describes high-rent areas growing outward with lower-rent taking over. The key here is the sequential takeover.

Concentric zones emphasize the arrangement and the sequential nature of land use as you move outward. Core-periphery models have the core and periphery, but the periphery is built outward from the center. But in terms of sequential, maybe it's the core-periphery model where you first have the core, then expand outward.

Wait, no. Core periphery is more about the structure, not the process. For example, the core is the highest concentration, and the periphery is built outward. But in terms of the process of urban sprawl, it's about the movement of people from center to periphery.

So, the question is which model explains the sequential takeover. The model that explains this is the concentric zone model. Because each successive ring is built outward, and the inner rings (high-rent) take over first, followed by the next ring, and so on. Lower-rent take over as you move outward.

So the correct answer is E: Concentric zone model.

The question asks which urban model explains the sequential takeover of lower-rent inhabitants as high-rent areas grow outward. The correct answer is the concentric zone model (Option E). This model arranges cities into concentric rings around a central point, where high-rent areas (innermost zones) are the densest, and lower-rent areas expand outward as people move. This sequential expansion aligns with the question's description.

Answer: E
