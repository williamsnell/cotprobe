Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the ionization of acetic acid. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says that the dissociation constant Ka is 1.8 × 10^-5, and we're dealing with a 0.5 M solution. They want the percentage of ionization. Hmm, I remember that for weak acids, the ionization is small, so we can probably make an approximation. 

The reaction is HC2H3O2 ↔ H+ + C2H3O2^-. I think the first step is to set up an ICE table, but wait, maybe I should think about the formula for percentage ionization. Oh right, the percentage is (concentration of H+ ions / initial concentration) multiplied by 100. Because the initial concentration is the total solution's concentration of the acid, and the change is how much dissociates. 

Wait, but since the acid is weak, the change in concentration of H+ should be small compared to the initial concentration. So, the assumption would be that x (the amount that dissociates) is much smaller than 0.5 M. So, the initial concentration is 0.5 M, and after dissociation, it's approximately 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5. That would make the math easier.

The Ka expression is [H+][A-]/[HA], which here would be (x)(x)/(0.5 - x) ≈ x²/0.5. So, x² = (Ka)(0.5). Let me compute that. Ka is 1.8e-5, so 0.5 * 1.8e-5 is 9e-6. So x squared is 9e-6, so x is the square root of 9e-6. The square root of 9 is 3, and square root of 1e-6 is 1e-3, so x is 3e-3 M. 

So, the concentration of H+ is 0.003 M. The initial concentration was 0.5 M, so the percentage ionization is (0.003 / 0.5) * 100. Let's calculate that. 0.003 divided by 0.5 is 0.006, multiplied by 100 is 0.6%. 

Looking at the options, option A is 0.60%. So that's the answer. But wait, why don't I consider that the approximation might not be valid? Like, do I need to check the 5% rule? Oh, right, the 5% rule says that if x is 5% of the initial concentration, then the approximation holds. Here, x is 0.003, initial is 0.5. 0.003 / 0.5 = 0.6, which is less than 5%, so the approximation is valid. So I think I'm confident. 

So the percentage ionization is 0.6%, which is option A.

To calculate the percentage of ionization of 0.5 M acetic acid with a dissociation constant \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), we use the equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction:

\[
\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2 \rightleftarrows \text{H}^+ + \text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2^-
\]

The equilibrium concentrations are given by:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2^-]}{[\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2]}
\]

Assuming the change in concentration \( x \) is small compared to the initial concentration of acetic acid (0.5 M), we approximate:

\[
[\text{H}^+] \approx x, \quad [\text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2^-] \approx x, \quad [\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2] \approx 0.5
\]

Substituting into the \( K_a \) expression:

\[
K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.5} \implies x^2 = K_a \cdot 0.5 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.5) = 9 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \sqrt{9 \times 10^{-6}} = 3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

The percentage of ionization is:

\[
\text{Percentage ionization} = \left( \frac{[\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2]_{\text{initial}}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3 \times 10^{-3}}{0.5} \right) \times 100 = 0.6\%
\]

To ensure the approximation holds, we check the 5% rule. \( x = 3 \times 10^{-3} \), and 5% of 0.5 M is 0.025 M. Since \( 0.6\% < 5\% \), the approximation is valid.

Thus, the percentage of ionization is \( 0.60\% \), which corresponds to option A.
