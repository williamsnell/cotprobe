Okay, so I have this question about why economists use per capita figures when discussing growth. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that per capita is like a way to compare things by dividing by the number of people. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

Wait, the question is about why per capita is often used. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me go through each option.

Option A says per capita figures track businesses. I don't think that's right. Businesses are counted at the national level, not per person. Plus, I think per capita is more about economic indicators per person, not business counts.

Option B talks about government wealth. No, government wealth is a separate measure, like GDP or something. Per capita isn't used there. But wait, maybe some people confuse it with that? I'm not sure. The question is about growth, not wealth.

Option C says per capita figures are more accurate and show individual changes. That sounds plausible. Because when you look at a country's total output, it's a big number, but per capita would show how much each person produces. This would help in understanding individual growth and changes over time. Also, it can highlight disparities between rich and poor, which is important for policies.

Option D mentions understanding resource distribution. Oh, I think that's right. If you know how much each person gets, you can see who's getting what. But why is per capita used for growth? Maybe it's more about per person productivity or consumption.

Option E suggests per capita is for determining the richest. That doesn't sound right. The richest would just be the maximum, not per capita. Unless it's a different metric, but I don't think that's the main reason.

Option F says per capita simplifies calculations. That's a good point. It makes numbers easier to handle because you divide by the population. But the question is why they use it for growth analysis, not just calculation.

Option G says per capita helps understand population growth. Well, population is a variable, but I'm not sure if per capita is the main reason for using it in growth analysis. It's more about per person measures.

Option H says per capita is only for predicting future trends. That's not true. They are used for analyzing past trends as well as future ones. But the question is about why they use per capita in growth analysis, not the scope of use.

Option I says per capita is easier for the public. I think per capita makes it more understandable because it's a per person basis. So the public can grasp it better, which is good for policy-making.

Option J says per capita shows total output. No, that's not right. Total output is usually national GDP, which is a broad measure, not per capita. Unless it's a per person basis, but then it's per capita output per person.

So, putting it together. Why per capita is often used? It's because it allows comparing economic indicators on a per person basis, making it easier to see growth per individual, identify disparities, and analyze trends more accurately. That's option C: "Per capita figures measure growth more accurately and show changes in individual welfare."

Wait, but what about option C? Does it address growth? Hmm. Because per capita figures show individual welfare changes, but how does that relate to growth? Maybe I'm mixing up growth rates and per capita. Oh, wait, no. The question is about why per capita figures are used for growth analysis. So perhaps option C is correct because they allow for a more granular view of economic growth.

Alternatively, option C might not directly address growth, but option D talks about resource distribution. But the question is about growth. So maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another angle. The common reason per capita is used is to make national-level data more understandable. For example, instead of saying a country has $100 billion GDP, people often say $40,000 per person. This helps in seeing how much each person contributes. This is for growth analysis because it shows how productivity or consumption is distributed. So, option C seems correct.

So, the answer should be C: Per capita figures measure growth more accurately and show changes in individual welfare.

The correct answer is C: Per capita figures measure growth more accurately and show changes in individual welfare.

**Explanation:** 
Per capita figures are commonly used in economic analysis to provide a more granular understanding of growth. They allow for the comparison of economic indicators on a per person basis, making it easier to analyze how each individual contributes to overall growth. This helps in identifying disparities and trends, making them particularly useful for growth analysis.
