Okay, so I have this question about Hume and justice. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on Hume's views, but I'll try to think it through. I remember Hume is a philosopher, right? He's known for his critical thinking and skepticism towards certain ideas. 

The question is about the value of justice according to Hume. The options are A to D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says justice has no value. That doesn't sound right. I think Hume didn't think of justice as something that doesn't have value, but rather as something else. He might have argued that justice is a good thing, even if it's not universally considered valuable.

Option B states that justice has value because it's useful to society. Hume was critical of natural law theories, right? He believed that justice isn't inherently good but is useful. So he might argue that it's valuable because it serves society's interests.

Option C claims justice has value solely because it's useful to society. Wait, that seems similar to B but phrased differently. Oh, maybe they're the same. Or perhaps B is a more precise expression of C. I'm not sure, but I think both B and C could be pointing towards the idea that value comes from utility in society.

Option D says justice has value because it's useful to the agent. That seems a bit more about the agent's self-interest. Hume's arguments might lean towards the agent's perspective, but I'm not certain. I think he might have emphasized societal utility more.

Wait, Hume's arguments against natural law were about the role of justice in society. So he probably argued that justice is a good thing because it helps maintain social order and fairness. So it's not about the agent's self-interest but about societal utility.

So, looking at the options again. B says it's useful to society. C says it's solely because it's useful to society. So are they the same? Or is there a nuance in the wording?

Hmm, B could be a simplified version of C. Let me think. Hume might have considered that the value of justice lies in its ability to serve the common good, which is what society does. So both options B and C point to the same idea. But the wording differs.

Wait, the question asks for the correct choice. Let me recall what Hume wrote. I think he wrote that justice is a good thing, not because it's inherently good, but because it is useful to society. Or was he more critical of natural law?

Wait, no, Hume didn't think in terms of natural law. He's more about the role of justice in society. So he might say that justice is valuable because it serves society. So the answer would point to something like option B or C.

Wait, another angle: Hume's argument is that justice is a universal good, but it's not necessarily good in itself. It's a tool that helps maintain social harmony. So its value comes from its role in society.

Looking at the options again, option B says it's useful to society. Option C says it's solely because it's useful to society. So are they both correct? Or is one more precise than the other?

Wait, the difference between B and C is whether it's "solely" or just "because." If B is a more general statement, and C is more restrictive, then perhaps B is correct because it's not just solely about society but that's the reason. Or maybe the wording doesn't change the meaning.

Alternatively, perhaps Hume thought that the value of justice is because it is part of society's good. So both B and C are correct in saying that it's because of societal utility. But looking back at the options, the choices are between B and C, and D.

I think the correct answer is B or C. Wait, Hume's view: he was against natural law, but he did think that justice is a good thing. So it's not inherently good but is useful because of its role in society.

So the value comes from its utility to society. So the correct answer would be B, because it says "has value in part because it is useful to society." Or does it say "because it is useful to society" in a more general sense? Or is it more specific?

Wait, according to what I remember, Hume's position is that justice is a good thing, but he doesn't think it's inherently good. It's useful because it helps maintain societal order. So the value is due to its societal utility. So the answer is B, which says it's useful because of society's interest. Alternatively, option C says solely because it's useful to society. So if Hume considered it solely because of society, then C would be correct. But I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, perhaps the difference is that B is a more general statement, and C adds 'solely.' I think both are correct, but the question might be phrased to choose the more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B. I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with B as the correct answer. The answer is B: has value in part because it is useful to society.

The correct answer is B: has value in part because it is useful to society.

Hume's view on justice emphasizes its value as part of societal good. While Hume is known for his skepticism towards natural law, he argued that justice is a good thing, not inherently good, but it serves society's interests. Therefore, the value of justice lies in its utility to society, making option B accurate.

Answer: B
