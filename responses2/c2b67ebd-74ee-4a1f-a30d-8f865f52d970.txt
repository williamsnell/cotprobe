Okay, so I've got this problem here about a toy store selling puzzles in December. They sold 934 puzzles, and each one cost $6, including tax. The question is asking for the total cost of all the puzzles sold, including tax. The options are A through J, some of which are between $5,000 and $6,000. 

Hmm, let's break this down. Each puzzle is $6, and they sold 934 of them. So the total cost would be 934 multiplied by $6. I think I should start by calculating 934 times 6.

Let me do the math step by step. 900 times 6 is 5,400. Then, 34 times 6 is 204. Adding those together: 5,400 + 204 equals 5,604. So the total cost should be $5,604.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me double-check. 934 multiplied by 6: 900*6=5400, 30*6=180, 4*6=24. Adding those: 5400+180=5580, plus 24 is 5604. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option E is $5,604. So that's the right answer. The other options are either too low or too high. For example, option D is $6,004 which is way more, so that's incorrect. Option J is $5,904, which is higher than our calculation. So E must be the correct choice.

The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of puzzles (934) by the cost per puzzle ($6). 

934 Ã— 6 = 5,604.

The correct answer is E: $5,604.

Answer: E
