Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to understand what's being asked. 

The question says that a force of 100 Newtons is required to stretch a steel wire. The wire has a cross-sectional area of 2.0 mm² and is 2.0 meters long, stretched by a distance of 0.50 mm. I need to find out how much work is done in this stretching process. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, work done in stretching a wire... I remember that when you stretch a material, energy is stored as elastic potential energy. Oh right, the formula for elastic potential energy is (1/2) k x², but wait, is that right? Or was it another formula involving the force and displacement?

Wait, another approach: think about the work done is the integral of force over distance. So if the force varies with displacement, you might need to integrate F dx. But in this case, since the wire is stretched by a small amount, maybe we can approximate it using the formula for work done in a spring, which is (1/2) k x². But wait, is this a spring? The wire behaves similarly to a spring under small deformations, so perhaps that formula applies here.

Alternatively, I remember that for a wire under tension, the strain is related to the stress. Stress is force per area, and strain is change in length over original length. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here since the problem gives the force and the displacement, not the strain.

Wait, the wire is stretched a distance of 0.50 mm, so x = 0.50 mm. But the area is given in mm², and the force is in Newtons. I should probably convert all units to meters and Newtons because the standard SI units are better for calculations.

Let me see the given values:

- Force (F) = 100 N
- Cross-sectional area (A) = 2.0 mm² = 2.0e-6 m² (since 1 mm = 0.001 m, so mm² is (0.001)^2 = 1e-6 m²)
- Strain (ΔL/L) = 0.50 mm / 2.0 m = 0.25e-3 m/m → 0.00025 (since 0.5 mm is 0.0005 m, wait wait: 0.5 mm is 0.0005 meters. Because 1 mm is 0.001 meters. So 0.5 mm is 0.0005 m. So strain is ΔL / L = 0.0005 / 2.0 m = 0.00025.

Wait, but strain is usually (change in length) / original length. So yes, 0.5 mm is 0.0005 m. So strain is 0.0005 m / 2.0 m = 0.00025.

Alternatively, the amount of stretch (x) is 0.5 mm, which is 0.0005 meters.

Now, the work done is the integral of F dx from 0 to x. But if the force is constant, the work is F * x. So W = F * x. So in this case, F is 100 N, x is 0.0005 m.

So W = 100 N * 0.0005 m = 0.05 J.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.05 nt-m. So that's 0.05 joules.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The wire is being stretched, and the work done is the energy stored in the wire. Another way to compute it is as the elastic potential energy. The formula is (1/2) k x².

But to find k, the spring constant, or the Young's modulus, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the formula is (1/2) * (F * A) * x, but that might not be correct.

Wait, another thought: For a wire under tension, the work done is the energy stored, which is ½ k x². But k is the spring constant, which can be calculated as (F/A), where F is the force and A is the area. So k = F/A.

Wait, that makes sense because for a spring, the force is k x. So if F = k x, then k = F/x. So if k = F/A, then F/A = F/x → x = A. Hmm, that would imply x = A, which doesn't make sense because x is given as a small stretch. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, because the wire's stiffness is determined by its cross-sectional area and its length. The spring constant (or the " stiffness per unit area") is k = (1/(A)) * (F/(L)), because for a spring, F = k x, and for a wire, the force per unit length is k x. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for the work done in stretching a wire.

Wait, I think the formula for the energy stored in a wire when stretched by a length x is (1/2) k x². And k is the spring constant, which for a wire is (Y * A) / L, where Y is Young's modulus, A is cross-sectional area, and L is length.

But wait, without knowing Y, I can't compute k directly. Maybe I should use the initial approach, which is W = F * x. Let me see if that works.

In this case, F is 100 N, x is 0.5 mm, so 0.0005 m.

So W = 100 * 0.0005 = 0.05 J. Which is 0.05 N·m. Looking at the options, option F is 0.05 nt-m. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, using the other approach: If the wire is under tension, and the force is applied, the work done is ½ k x². But without knowing Y, perhaps the question expects us to use F * x. Because in the initial approach, it's straightforward.

Another point of consideration: The problem doesn't provide the material's properties, like Young's modulus. Therefore, the approach must be based on the given force and extension, and perhaps the question is designed to use the work done as F * x.

So the correct answer would be 0.05 N·m, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the work done in stretching the steel wire, we consider the relation between work, force, and displacement. The work done is given by the formula:

\[
W = F \cdot x
\]

where \( F \) is the force applied (100 N) and \( x \) is the displacement (0.50 mm = 0.0005 m). Substituting the values:

\[
W = 100 \, \text{N} \cdot 0.0005 \, \text{m} = 0.05 \, \text{J}
\]

This corresponds to 0.05 N·m. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.05 nt-m**

Thus, the work done in stretching the wire is **0.05 N·m**.
