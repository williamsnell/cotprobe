Alright, so I have this question here about the average number of square miles per county in Georgia. Let me see how I can approach this. The problem states that Georgia has 159 counties and covers 58,056 square miles. I need to find the average, round it to the nearest whole number, and then select the correct option from A to J.

Okay, so first, I remember that to find an average, I usually divide the total by the number of items. In this case, it's total area divided by the number of counties. So, 58,056 square miles divided by 159 counties.

Let me write that out: 58,056 ÷ 159. Hmm, doing the division. I might need to estimate or use a calculator, but since I'm just thinking, let me try to approximate.

Wait, 159 is just a bit less than 160. Maybe I can approximate it. So, 58,056 ÷ 159 ≈ 58,056 ÷ 160. Let's calculate that. 58,056 divided by 160. 

Hmm, 160 times 363 is 58,080. Because 160*300=48,000, 160*60=9,600, which sums to 57,600. Then 160*3=480, so 57,600 + 480 = 58,080. But wait, the total is 58,056, which is 24 less than 58,080. So, 363 - (24/160) ≈ 363 - 0.15 = 362.85. So, approximately 362.85 square miles per county.

Wait, but I'm supposed to round to the nearest whole number. So, 362.85 would round to 363. But looking at the options, I don't see 363. The options are 318, 150, 250, 350, 500, 274, 200, 159, 365, 400. Hmm, so 363 is closest to 365, which is option I.

Wait, but maybe I should do the exact division to make sure I'm not approximating too much. Let me try dividing 58056 by 159 accurately.

Another approach: Let's see how many times 159 goes into 58056.

First, 159 times 360 is 57,240 (because 159 * 300 = 47,700; 159*60=9,540; sum is 57,240). 58,056 minus 57,240 is 816.

Now, how many times does 159 go into 816? Let's compute 159 * 5 = 795, which leaves a remainder of 21 (816-795=21). So, 360 +5 = 365, and the remainder is 21. So, the exact division is 365 with a remainder of 21.

So the exact average is 365 + 21/159. 21/159 is approximately 0.132. So, the average is approximately 365.132 square miles per county.

Rounded to the nearest whole number is 365, which is option I. But wait, looking back at the options, option I is 365. But option J is 400, which is higher. So, 365.132 is closer to 365 than 366, so 365 is the correct answer. So, the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 365, wait no, looking back, option I is 365, so that's the correct choice. However, I'm looking at the options again:

Options:

A: 318

B: 150

C: 250

D: 350

E: 500

F: 274

G: 200

H: 159

I: 365

J: 400

So, 365 is option I, which is the correct choice. So the answer should be I: 365.

The correct answer is I: 365 square miles per county.
