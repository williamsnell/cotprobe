Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about residuals in regression. Hmm, I remember that residuals are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. Let me think about each option.

The question is asking which statement is true about residuals. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The sum of the residuals is always one. Wait, no. I think the sum should be zero because the mean of the residuals is zero. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: If the correlation is 0, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. Correlation being zero means no linear relationship. But in a regression residual plot, a perfect zero correlation doesn't necessarily mean no pattern. I think it might show a random scatter, but maybe not a distinct pattern. Alternatively, perhaps when r=0, the residuals should be random with zero mean. So B might not be correct.

Option C: The larger the residuals, the better the linear model. That doesn't make sense. Larger residuals mean the model isn't good at predicting that point. So C is wrong.

Option D: The residuals are always negative. No, residuals can be positive or negative. So D is incorrect.

Option E: If the correlation is 1, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. A perfect correlation implies all points lie on a line. So the residuals should all be zero, which is a perfect pattern, but since they're zero, it's not a pattern. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: The residual plot will always be a straight line. No, the residual plot is just the plot of residuals against the independent variable. It's a scatter plot, not necessarily a straight line. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Influential scores have large residuals. I remember that influential points can have large residuals, but they don't have to. So G is not necessarily true; that's an incorrect statement.

Option H: The mean of the residuals is always zero. Yes, that's a fundamental property of residuals in regression. The average of the residuals is zero because the regression line is chosen to minimize the sum of squared errors. So H must be correct.

Option I: If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals. Wait, not necessarily. For example, in a perfect model, all residuals are zero. So positive and negative counts are zero. Or, in models with a positive slope, the residuals might be more on one side. So I's statement might not always hold. I'm not sure, but I think it's not necessarily true. So I might be wrong.

Wait, but perhaps the model isn't perfect. If the model is a good fit, the residuals would be distributed around zero. So their sum is zero, but could they be equally positive and negative? No, because if the sum is zero, the number could be more positive than negative or vice versa, especially if the residuals are spread in a way. Wait, like if there are 3 positive and 1 negative, sum would be 3-1=2. But the mean is zero. So I is incorrect because the positive and negative residuals counts don't have to be equal.

Option J: The residuals can never be zero. No, that's not true. If the model perfectly predicts the data, all residuals are zero. So J is wrong.

So the only correct statement is option H.

The correct answer is H: The mean of the residuals is always zero.
