Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about constructing a truth table for an argument and determining its validity. The argument given is:

~C → D
D → C
C

And then there are several options about whether it's valid or invalid and what the counterexample would be if it's invalid.

First, I need to recall what a truth table is. It's a table that shows all possible truth values of logical statements. For the argument, I'll have to consider all possible truth values of the propositions involved, which are C and D in this case. So, there are two variables, each can be true or false. That means four possible combinations.

Next, I should figure out how the argument is structured. The argument has three statements:

1. ~C → D
2. D → C
3. C

We're supposed to see if these three statements together imply the third one, which is C. If they do, the argument is valid. If not, it's invalid, and we need to find a counterexample.

Wait, actually, wait. The problem says, "construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid." Oh, right, the conclusion here is C, and the premises are the first two. So according to the structure, the argument would be:

Premises: ~C → D and D → C.
Conclusion: C.

So, the argument is: { ~C → D, D → C } ⊢ C.

To check validity, we need to see if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If in any scenario where premises are true, the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

So, let's construct the truth table.

Variables: C and D.

Possible combinations:

1. C = T, D = T
2. C = T, D = F
3. C = F, D = T
4. C = F, D = F

Now, let's evaluate each premise for each combination.

First premise: ~C → D.

Which is equivalent to: If not C, then D.

So, in terms of truth values, when C is T, ~C is F, so F → D is only true when D is T.

Wait, no, the implication a → b is only false when a is T and b is F. So, for ~C → D, it's false only when ~C is T and D is F. Which would be when C is F and D is F.

Similarly, when C is F, ~C is T, so any D will make the premise true.

Second premise: D → C.

Which is D → C. So, it's false only when D is T and C is F.

Let me make a table.

| C | D | ~C | ~C → D | D → C | Premise 1 true? Premise 2 true? Conclusion C true? |
|---|---|----|--------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| T | T | F  | F → T = T | T → T = T | T and T → T | T |
| T | F | F  | F → F = T | F → T = F | T and F → F | F |
| F | T | T  | T → T = T | T → F = F | T and F → F | F |
| F | F | T  | T → F = F | F → F = T | F and T → F | F |

Wait, let me correct that. Let me reevaluate each premise for each combination.

Wait, perhaps I should make a better step-by-step evaluation.

1. When C=T, D=T:
   - ~C = F. So ~C → D is F → T = T.
   - D → C is T → T = T.
   So both premises are true. The conclusion is C=T. So in this case, the premises are true, and conclusion is true. No problem.

2. C=T, D=F:
   - ~C = F. So ~C → D is F → F = T.
   - D → C is F → T = T.
   Both premises are true. The conclusion is C=T. So again, same.

3. C=F, D=T:
   - ~C = T. So ~C → D is T → T = T.
   - D → C is T → F = F.
   So the second premise is false. Premises are not all true. So this scenario doesn't matter because the argument would be invalid only if premises are true and conclusion is false. But here, premises have at least one false, so this doesn't affect the argument's validity.

Wait, no, the argument's validity depends only on whether the premises being true can lead to the conclusion being false. So if in any case where premises are true, the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

Let's see which rows have all premises true.

Looking at the table again:

Only the first row, where C=T, D=T: both premises are true. The conclusion is also true. So no invalid in this case.

In the second row, C=T, D=F: premises are both true, but the conclusion is C=T. So no problem.

In the third row, C=F, D=T: the second premise is false; so all premises are not true.

In the fourth row, C=F, D=F: both premises are true (since ~C is T, so ~C → D is T → F is F? Wait, no. Wait, when D is F and ~C is T, the implication is F → F, which is always T. So ~C → D is T → F? Wait, no, D in that row is F.

Wait, perhaps I got confused. Let me reevaluate each premise.

Third row: C=F, D=T.

- ~C is T, D is T: so ~C → D is T → T = T.
- D is T, C is F: so D → C is T → F = F.

So the second premise is D → C, which is T → F = F.

Therefore, in this row, the second premise is false. So the argument's premises are only true in the first two rows? Wait, no, in the second row, C=T, D=F: both premises are true.

Wait, let me make a corrected table.

I'm getting a bit confused, let me try again.

Let's evaluate each premise for each row:

1. C=T, D=T:
   ~C = F → ~C → D is F→T = T
   D→C is T→T = T
   Both premises true. Conclusion true.

2. C=T, D=F:
   ~C=F → F→F = T
   D=F → C=T is F→T = T
   Both premises true. Conclusion true.

3. C=F, D=T:
   ~C=T → T→T = T
   D=T → C=F is T→F = F
   So second premise is false. So all premises aren't true here.

4. C=F, D=F:
   ~C=T → T→F = F
   D=F → C=F is F→F = T
   So first premise is false. So all premises aren't true here.

So only in the first two rows, both premises are true, and conclusion is true.

So in all cases where premises are true, the conclusion is also true. So the argument is valid.

Wait, but the options suggest that some are invalid. Did I make a mistake?

Wait the options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and D is false.

Wait, but in the cases where C=T and D=F, the premises are true, and the conclusion is C=T. So that's not a counterexample. Because in that scenario, the premises are true, and the conclusion is true. So that doesn't show the argument is invalid.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The argument is { ~C→D, D→C }, and the conclusion is C.

So if the premises imply C, then the argument is valid.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the structure. If both ~C→D and D→C are true, is C necessarily true?

Wait, that's actually the definition of an implication. If (A→B) and (B→A), then A and B are logically equivalent, and both are true only when A and B have the same truth value. So, if ~C→D and D→C are both true, then ~C and D must be equivalent. So, ~C ≡ D.

Which means, if ~C is true, then D is true, and vice versa.

So, if ~C and D are both true, then C must be false. But wait, if ~C is equivalent to D, then C would be the opposite of D.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think differently.

If ~C → D and D → C are both true, then ~C and D must have the same truth value.

Because if D is true, then ~C must also be true.

So, when D is true, ~C is true (C is false).

When D is false, ~C must also be false (so C is true).

Wait, that can't be. No. Wait, if D is true, ~C is true → C is false.

If D is false, then ~C is false (since ~C → D must be true). If D is false, then ~C must be false → C is true.

Wait, but if D is false, then for ~C → D to be true, since D is false, ~C must be true or false? Wait, no— the implication a→b is only false when a is true and b is false. So if a is false, the implication is true regardless of b.

So, when D is false, ~C can be either true or false; the implication ~C→D is automatically true.

So, in the case where D is false, ~C can be anything. So, if D is false, then C can be either true or false.

Wait, but let's get back to our truth table. We saw that in the case where C=T and D=F, both premises are true, and conclusion is C=T. So, in this scenario, the premises are true, and conclusion is true. So, it's consistent with the argument being valid.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the argument is valid, because whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is true.

But the options suggest that some are invalid. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the premises.

Wait, let's re-derive the premises for each case.

Case 1: C=T, D=T.

~C is F. So, ~C → D is F→T = T.
D → C is T→T = T.
So premise 1 is T, premise 2 is T. Conclusion is T.

Case 2: C=T, D=F.

~C is F. So ~C → D is F→F = T.
D → C is F→T = T.
So, both premises are T. Conclusion is T.

Case 3: C=F, D=T.

~C is T. So ~C → D is T→T = T.
D → C is T→F = F.
So, premise 1 is T, premise 2 is F. So premises are not both true.

Case 4: C=F, D=F.

~C is T. So ~C → D is T→F = F.
D → C is F→F = T.
So, premise 1 is F, premise 2 is T. So premises are not both true.

So, in all cases where the premises are true (cases 1 and 2), the conclusion is also T. So the argument is valid.

So the correct answer is that the argument is valid (option G).
</think>

The argument is valid because in all rows where the premises (~C → D and D → C) are true, the conclusion (C) is also true. There are no counterexamples where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is valid.
