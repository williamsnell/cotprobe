Okay, so I've got this question here about how much time Sanjay spent watching TV last weekend. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question says he watched 3 TV shows, each 30 minutes long. Then he also watched 1 movie that was 90 minutes. The question is asking for the total number of minutes he watched TV.

Hmm, so I need to add up all those watching times. Let me break it down. First, the 3 shows. Each show is 30 minutes, so 3 times 30. Let me calculate that: 30 * 3 is 90 minutes. Right, so the shows add up to 90 minutes.

Then there's the movie. It's 90 minutes. So I need to add that to the 90 minutes from the shows. Let me add them together: 90 + 90. That equals 180 minutes.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question specifies the total number of minutes he watched. So yes, I think 180 is the correct total. Looking at the options, option D is 180, so that must be the answer.

The total time Sanjay spent watching TV is calculated by adding the durations of all the shows and the movie. 

- 3 shows × 30 minutes = 90 minutes
- 1 movie × 90 minutes = 90 minutes
- Total = 90 + 90 = 180 minutes.

**Answer: D: 180**
