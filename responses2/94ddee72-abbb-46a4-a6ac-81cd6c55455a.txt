Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the pressure exerted by ethane gas. Hmm, let's see. The question says 10.0 moles of C2H6 gas are confined to a volume of 4.860 dm³ at 27 degrees Celsius. We need to find the pressure using the ideal gas law. Yeah, I remember the ideal gas equation is PV = nRT, right?

Wait, the ideal gas law uses pressure (P), volume (V), moles (n), temperature (T), and the gas constant R. But wait, what's the value of R here? Oh right, R is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using pressure in atm and volume in liters.

So first, I need to make sure all the units are compatible. The volume is given in dm³, which is liters. Oh, right, 1 dm³ is 1 liter, so that's good. 

The temperature is 27 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, the ideal gas law uses temperature in Kelvin. So I need to convert that. I remember adding 273.15 to convert. So 27 + 273.15 is 300.15 K. Let me double-check that: 27 +273=299, so 27+273.15=300.15 K. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the number of moles is 10.0. The volume is 4.860 liters. And R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Putting it all into the equation: P = (nRT)/V.

So n is 10.0, R is 0.0821, T is 300.15 K, V is 4.860 L.

Let me compute the numerator first: 10 * 0.0821 * 300.15.

Calculating that step by step:

10 * 0.0821 = 0.821. Then, 0.821 * 300.15. Let's see, 0.821 * 300 is 246.3, and 0.821 * 0.15 is about 0.12315. So adding those gives 246.42315. So the numerator is approximately 246.423 atm·dm³? Wait, no, units: R is in L·atm/(mol·K), V in L, so the units will be (mol * L·atm/(mol·K) * K) / L → atm. So the units are correct.

So P = 246.423 / 4.860. Let me compute that. Let's see, 246.423 divided by 4.860.

Hmm, 4.860 is approx 4.86. Let's see, 4.86 * 50 is 243. So 4.86 * 51 is 247.86. Oh wait, 4.86 *50.7 is 4.86*(50 + 0.7) = 243 + 3.402 = 246.402. Oh wait, that's exactly the numerator. So 50.7 is approximately the result. So P is around 50.7 atm.

Looking back at the options, H is 50.7 atm. So the answer should be H.

To calculate the pressure exerted by ethane gas using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), the following steps were taken:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - \( n = 10.0 \, \mathrm{mol} \)
   - \( V = 4.860 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = 4.860 \, \mathrm{L} \) (since \( 1 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = 1 \, \mathrm{L} \))
   - \( T = 27^\circ \mathrm{C} \), which needs to be converted to Kelvin: \( T = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \mathrm{K} \)
   - \( R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / (mol \cdot K)} \)

2. **Rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for pressure \( P \):**
   \[
   P = \frac{nRT}{V}
   \]

3. **Substitute the values into the equation:**
   \[
   P = \frac{(10.0)(0.0821)(300.15)}{4.860}
   \]

4. **Calculate the numerator:**
   - \( 10.0 \times 0.0821 = 0.821 \)
   - \( 0.821 \times 300.15 \approx 246.423 \)

5. **Divide by the volume:**
   \[
   P = \frac{246.423}{4.860} \approx 50.7 \, \mathrm{atm}
   \]

6. **Compare the result with the provided options:**
   - The calculated pressure is \( 50.7 \, \mathrm{atm} \), which matches option **H**.
