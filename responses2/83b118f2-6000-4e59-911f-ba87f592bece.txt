Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. John has five children, and we need to find the probability that at least half of them are girls. So, at least half of five is two or more girls. That makes sense because five divided by two is two.5, so we're looking for two, three, four, or five girls.

The question says we can assume that the probability of a boy or a girl being born is equally likely. So, each child has a 50% chance of being a boy and 50% a girl. I remember that when dealing with such probabilities, especially with independent events like children being boys or girls, we can use combinations and binomial probabilities.

First, I need to calculate the total number of possible gender combinations for five children. Since each child can be a boy or a girl, there are 2^5 = 32 possible outcomes. That's the denominator for our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of favorable outcomes, which are the cases where there are at least two girls. So, I'll need to calculate the probability of having exactly 2, 3, 4, or 5 girls and add them up.

Let me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to have exactly k girls out of n children is given by the binomial coefficient, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n-k)!).

So, for n =5 and k=2, it's C(5,2) = 10. For k=3, C(5,3)=10. For k=4, C(5,4)=5. And for k=5, C(5,5)=1. So the total number of favorable cases is 10 +10 +5 +1 =26.

Wait, wait, that adds up to 26. So the probability would be 26/32. Let me simplify that. 26 divided by 32 is the same as 13/16. Wait, but the options don't have 13/16. Let me check the options again.

Oh, wait, looking at the options again, the choices are A: 1/3, B:3/4, C:1/8, D:5/8, E:1/5, F:2/3, G:1/2, H:1/4, I:3/5, J:4/5. Wait, none of these match 13/16. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the favorable outcomes. Let me recount.

Wait, 5 children. At least two girls means 2,3,4,5 girls. So let's calculate each case:

Number of ways for exactly 2 girls: C(5,2) = 10.

Exactly 3 girls: C(5,3)=10.

Exactly 4 girls: C(5,4)=5.

Exactly 5 girls: C(5,5)=1.

Adding them: 10+10=20, 20+5=25, 25+1=26. So 26 favorable cases.

Total cases:32. So 26/32 simplifies to 13/16, which is 0.8125 or 81.25%.

But none of the options match this. Let's look at the options again. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. The question asks for "the probability that at least half of them are girls," which in English can sometimes be interpreted as "at least 2.5," but since we can't have half a girl, it's equivalent to 3 or more. So maybe I was wrong in the initial calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-express the problem. At least half of the five children being girls. Half is 2.5, so more than that would be 3 or more. So, the number of girls should be 3,4,5. So, adding those up.

So, number of ways for exactly 3 girls: C(5,3)=10.

Exactly 4 girls:5.

Exactly5:1.

So total of 16. So 16/32, which is 1/2. So the probability would be 16/32=1/2. Which is 50%.

Looking back at the options, that would be option G: 1/2. But wait, wait a second. Wait, initially, I thought that at least two girls would be 2,3,4,5. But if the question says at least half, which is 2.5, so the next integer is 3. So, I think I was correct in the first calculation, but the options didn't have 13/16, but option G is 1/2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial approach was to count at least two girls, which is 2,3,4,5. But maybe the question actually meant at least 3 girls because half of 5 is 2.5, so more than that. So the correct interpretation would be at least 3 girls, which would mean the number is 3,4,5.

So, 10 (for 3) +5 (4) +1 (5) =16. 16/32=1/2, which is option G. So the correct answer would be option G: 1/2.

But wait, wait again! Let me make sure. If the question is asking for at least half, which is 3 or more, then the probability is 16/32=1/2. So the answer is G.

Alternatively, if the question was asking for at least two girls, that's 26/32=13/16, which is not an option. So I think I was correct the first time, and the correct answer is option G: 1/2.

The probability that at least three of John's five children are girls is calculated by summing the combinations for exactly 3, 4, and 5 girls. Each combination is calculated using the binomial coefficient \( C(5, k) \) for \( k = 3, 4, 5 \). The total favorable cases are \( 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 \), leading to a probability of \( 16/32 = 1/2 \).

Answer: G
