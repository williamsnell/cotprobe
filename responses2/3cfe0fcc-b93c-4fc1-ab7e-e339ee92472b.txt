Okay, so I've got this inequality problem here: x squared minus 6x plus c is less than zero. And I need to find all positive values of c that make this inequality have real solutions. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a quadratic inequality like this can be solved by looking at the graph of the quadratic function. The inequality x² -6x + c < 0 represents the regions where the quadratic is below the x-axis. So, for there to be real solutions, the quadratic must dip below the x-axis somewhere.

Wait, so when does a quadratic have real roots? Oh right, the discriminant. The discriminant of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is b² - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots, which means the quadratic crosses the x-axis at two points, creating a parabola that opens upwards. So, if the quadratic crosses the x-axis, the part of the parabola below the x-axis will be between the two roots, meaning there are real solutions where the inequality holds.

But in this case, the parabola is y = x² -6x + c. Since the coefficient of x² is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. So, it will have a minimum point, and the quadratic will be negative between its two roots, if it has any real roots.

So, for the inequality x² -6x + c < 0 to have real solutions, the quadratic must have two distinct real roots. That means the discriminant must be positive.

Let me calculate the discriminant. The discriminant D is b² - 4ac. In this case, a is 1, b is -6, and c is c. So, D = (-6)² - 4*(1)*(c). That simplifies to 36 - 4c.

For real solutions, D must be greater than zero. So:

36 - 4c > 0

Let me solve for c. Adding 4c to both sides:

36 > 4c

Divide both sides by 4:

9 > c

Which is the same as c < 9.

But wait, the question says positive values of c. So c must be greater than zero and less than 9. So, c must be in (0,9). Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option D is (0,9), which matches. Option J is (4,9), which is a subset of D. But wait, the question asks for all positive values of c so that the inequality has real solutions. So any c less than 9 would work, as long as c is positive. So the interval should be from 0 to 9, not just a subset.

Wait, but I just thought that when discriminant is positive, the quadratic crosses the x-axis twice, so the inequality holds between the roots. So as long as the discriminant is positive, we have real solutions. So c must be less than 9.

But the question is about c being positive. So 0 < c < 9. Looking at the options, D is (0,9), which is correct.

Wait, but let me check if I missed something. Is it possible that when c is zero, the quadratic becomes x² -6x, which factors as x(x-6). So the roots are at 0 and 6. The quadratic is negative between 0 and 6, so for c=0, which is not positive, the inequality x²-6x+0 < 0 is true for x between 0 and 6. So if c is zero, the inequality still has real solutions, but c must be positive. So c must be greater than zero, but less than 9.

Thus, the correct interval is (0,9), which is option D. So the answer should be D.

To determine the positive values of \( c \) for which the inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) has real solutions, we analyze the quadratic function. The quadratic opens upwards, so it dips below the x-axis between its two real roots when the discriminant is positive. The discriminant \( D = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c \) must be positive for real roots. Solving \( 36 - 4c > 0 \) gives \( c < 9 \). Since \( c \) must be positive, the interval is \( (0, 9) \).

Answer: D (0, 9)
