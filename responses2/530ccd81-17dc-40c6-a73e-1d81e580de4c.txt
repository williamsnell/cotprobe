Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a sample of 3.00 moles of a diatomic perfect gas is compressed reversibly and adiabatically until its temperature reaches 250 K. I'm supposed to find the heat transfer (q) in joules, given that the molar heat capacity at constant volume, C_v,m, is 27.5 J K^-1 mol^-1. The options are from A to J, and the last character of the answer must match.

Hmm, let me think. So, it's a reversible adiabatic process. Wait, adiabatic means no heat exchange with the surroundings—so q should be zero. Because in an adiabatic process, q is zero. But wait, I need to make sure. 

Wait, wait, but wait. Oh, right. Wait, no. Because when the process is adiabatic, the system doesn't exchange heat with the environment. So, q is zero. But wait, is this a reversible adiabatic or something else? Because the question says it's adiabatic. So, yeah, q should be zero. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, another angle: in a reversible adiabatic process, heat transfer is zero because it's adiabatic. So, q=0. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. The process is adiabatic, which implies that no heat is transferred. So, q=0. So the answer should be option A, which is 0. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, another thought. Wait, the process is adiabatic, so no heat is exchanged. So q is zero. But wait, the process is also reversible. That might affect the calculations, but since it's adiabatic, the q is zero regardless.

Alternatively, another way to approach it: in an adiabatic process, ΔU = q + w. But wait, since q is zero, ΔU = w. But for a reversible adiabatic process, the work done is in such a way that q=0, right?

Wait, no, I think that's correct. Because in a reversible adiabatic process, the system is in equilibrium and no heat is exchanged. So yes, q is zero.

Wait, but the process is being compressed, so maybe the work done is negative. But the question is about q. So the correct answer would be option A, 0.

But wait, wait, the question says it's a diatomic perfect gas, so it's a diatomic molecule, so the degrees of freedom would be 5 (three translational, two rotational for diatomic). So, Cv,m is given as 27.5 J/(K·mol). Wait, but for a diatomic gas, the molar heat capacity at constant volume is (5/2)R. Let's check: R is 8.314 J/(K·mol). So (5/2)*8.314 is about 20.785 J/(K·mol), which is lower than the given 27.5. Hmm, that suggests that the gas might have more degrees of freedom. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, diatomic gases at room temperature have Cv = (5/2)R, but in higher temperatures, diatomic gases can have more degrees of freedom. Wait, but for a perfect gas, the molar heat capacity might vary with temperature. But the problem states that it's a perfect gas, so perhaps we can proceed with the given Cv,m.

So, wait, but the question is about finding q. Let me go back to the process. Since the process is adiabatic, q must be zero.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let's think about what the process entails. The gas is compressed, so work is done on the gas. Since it's adiabatic, the work done on the gas (positive work) is converted into internal energy. But since q is zero, the internal energy change would be equal to the work done. So, ΔU = W. But since the process is adiabatic, W = -q. So, if q is zero, W is zero? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the first law: ΔU = q + w. Where w is the work done on the system. Oh, wait, sometimes the convention is that w is work done on the system. So, in a compression, the system is doing work on the surroundings, so the work done on the system is positive.

So, if the process is adiabatic, q is zero. So, ΔU = w. But wait, the gas is compressed, so the work done on the system is positive. So, ΔU is positive because the internal energy increases when the system does work on the surroundings. Wait, no, wait: in an expansion, the system does work, so the internal energy decreases. In a compression, the system is doing work on the surroundings, so the internal energy increases. So, if the process is adiabatic, and the system is compressed, then ΔU is positive.

Wait, but the problem is about finding q. Since q is zero, the answer is 0. So, the correct option is A, which is 0.

Wait, but why do I need to calculate anything else? Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in a reversible adiabatic process, the temperature changes but q is zero. So, the correct answer is 0, which is option A.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that in some cases, especially with ideal gases undergoing certain processes, the heat transfer can be non-zero. Oh, wait no, in an adiabatic process, q is zero. So, the answer should be 0, option A.

The problem involves a sample of 3.00 moles of a diatomic perfect gas that is compressed reversibly and adiabatically until its temperature reaches 250 K. The goal is to calculate the heat transfer, \( q \), during this process.

In a **reversible adiabatic process**, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (\( q = 0 \)) because the process is adiabatic by definition. Even though the gas is compressed, the absence of heat transfer ensures that the internal energy change (\( \Delta U \)) is entirely due to the work done on the system (\( w \)). The fact that the gas is diatomic does not affect this conclusion, as the adiabatic condition ensures \( q = 0 \) regardless of the degrees of freedom or the specific heat capacity provided.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: 0**
