Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about astronaut John Glenn and his military service. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that astronauts are typically members of the military, but I'm not exactly sure which branch. I know that the Space Force is one of the branches in the United States, but I'm not certain if anyone from the Space Force has served as an astronaut.

Wait, I think I've heard that someone named Glenn served in the Space Force. Let me think about the options given. The options are National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, Marines, Air Force, Navy, etc.

I'm pretty sure that the Space Force is part of the armed forces, but specifically, it's the Space Marine Corps or the Space Force. But I'm not sure if astronauts like John Glenn were part of that. I remember that astronauts were typically in the Air Force, Navy, or Marine Corps, not the Space Force. 

John Glenn was a former astronaut. I think he was a successful astronaut who became a NASA scientist. He served in the Navy, I believe. Because he was involved in the Apollo program, right? He was the first American to travel to the Moon. So that would make him a Navy astronaut.

Looking at the options again: D is Air Force, F is Navy. The others don't seem to fit. The Space Force is option J, which is not correct. So the answer should be F, the Navy.

The astronaut John Glenn served in the Navy.
