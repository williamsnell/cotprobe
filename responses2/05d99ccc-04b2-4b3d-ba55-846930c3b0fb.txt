Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about the impact of government spending and tax changes on real GDP in country Z. Hmm, let me think about it.

The question says that the government increases spending by $12 million and raises tax collections by the same amount. I'm trying to remember the concepts from my notes on fiscal policy. Oh right, fiscal policy affects the economy through changes in government spending and taxation.

I remember that government spending (G) is a component of the aggregate demand model. When the government increases its spending, it directly boosts the aggregate demand because the government is spending more. But at the same time, when taxes are raised, it's a revenue source. So if taxes go up, people have more disposable income, which can influence consumption (C).

Wait, the problem says both spending and taxes are increased by $12 million. So if G increases by 12 and T increases by 12, what's the net effect on GDP?

I think the key here is to look at the multiplier effect. The government spending multiplier is 1 + (1 - marginal propensity to save), right? Let's say the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is, say, 0.2. Then the multiplier would be 1 + (1 - 0.2) = 1.8. So a $12 million increase in G would lead to 1.8 * 12 = $21.6 million increase in GDP.

But wait, when taxes are increased, it's a bit different because it's a tax multiplier. The tax multiplier is -MPS. So if tax increases by $12 million, the effect on GDP would be -MPS * 12. If the same $12 million is taxed, the MPC (marginal propensity to consume) is 1 - MPS. So the tax effect would be (MPC - 1) * 12, which is negative. 

Wait, let me think again. The spending multiplier is positive, and the tax multiplier is negative. So if both are increased by the same amount, the net effect on GDP would be (1 + (1 - MPS)) - (MPS) = 2 - 2*MPS.

Wait, that's probably not the right way to calculate it. Alternatively, the combined effect is:

ΔG = 12, ΔT = 12.

The change in GDP is ΔY = (ΔG) * (1 + (1 - MPS)) + (ΔT) * (MPC - 1). 

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it as: the government spending increases G by 12, and taxes decrease by 12 (since increasing taxes is like decreasing it in the formula). So the net impact is (G +12) - (T -12) = G +24. But wait, that's just the change in GDP, but that assumes that the government spending and tax changes are offset exactly in the same way. However, that's not the case here. The government increases G by 12, and the same amount is taken from taxes, so the net effect on the government budget is unchanged (same amount in and out). 

So the overall impact on GDP is based on the government's net change in spending. The government is increasing spending by 12 and reducing taxes by 12, so the net change in government spending is 12 (since T is reduced by 12, which is subtracted from the government's net spending). So the net effect on GDP is positive 12 million, because the government is effectively increasing its spending by 12, which is multiplied by the multiplier.

Wait, but the problem is that when both G and T are increased, the combined effect on GDP can be calculated by considering the net change in G. Because increasing G by 12 and increasing T by 12 is equivalent to increasing G by 12 (since net effect is 12 -12 = 0). No, wait, that can't be right because that would mean the overall effect on GDP is zero. But that's not correct because the tax change affects the multiplier.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this again. 

The formula for the impact of government spending on GDP is ΔG * (1 + 1 - MPS) = ΔG * (2 - MPS). 

The impact of a tax cut is (MPC - 1) * ΔT. So the combined effect is ΔG*(2 - MPS) + (MPC - 1)*ΔT. 

But since ΔG = ΔT (both 12 million), let's substitute:

= 12*(2 - MPS) + (MPC -1)*12 

= 12*(2 - MPS + MPC -1) 

MPC is 1 - MPS, so substituting:

= 12*(2 - MPS + (1 - MPS) -1) 

Simplify inside:

= 12*(2 - MPS +1 -MPS -1) 

= 12*(2 - 2MPS) 

So the total impact on GDP is 12*(2-2MPS) million.

Wait, but without knowing the MPC, can we say something? Or does it not matter because the problem says both G and T are increased by same amount, which implies that the net effect is zero? 

Wait, maybe not. Because if the MPC is 0.5, then 2-2*0.5=1, so the total change would be 12 million. But if MPC is 0.8, then 2-1.6=0.4, so 12*0.4=4.8 million.

Wait, but the options don't have such numbers. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the government is increasing both G and T by the same amount, which would net to zero net change in the government's net spending. That would mean that the overall impact on Y is zero, but that can't be right because the government is effectively increasing its spending by 12 million, which should have a multiplier effect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The change in GDP (ΔY) is the sum of the effects of the change in G and the change in T.

Effect of G: ΔG * (1 + (1 - MPS)) = 12*(2 - MPS).

Effect of T: Because when taxes are increased by ΔT (which is -12), the change in G would be multiplied by the tax multiplier. The tax multiplier is -MPS. So the effect is ΔT * (MPC - 1) = (-12)*( (1 - MPS) - 1 ) = (-12)*(-MPS) = 12 * MPS.

So total effect is:

12*(2 - MPS) + 12 * MPS = 24 -12MPS + 12MPS = 24 million.

Wait, that's interesting. The MPS terms cancel out, so the total change in GDP is 24 million. So the overall effect is that real GDP will increase by $24 million.

Looking at the options, option B says real GDP will increase by $24 million. So the correct answer should be B.
</think>

The question asks how increasing government spending by $12 million and raising tax collections by the same amount affects real GDP in country Z. To analyze this, we consider the multiplier effects of both government spending and taxes.

1. **Government Spending (G):** The increase in government spending directly boosts aggregate demand. The government spending multiplier is \(1 + (1 - \text{marginal propensity to save})\), which simplifies to \(2 - \text{MPS}\). If the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is, for example, 0.2, the multiplier would be \(1.8\). Thus, a $12 million increase in G would lead to \(12 \times 1.8 = 21.6\) million in GDP.

2. **Taxes (T):** Raising taxes reduces disposable income and, consequently, consumption. The tax multiplier is \(-(1 - \text{MPS})\), which is negative. If taxes increase by $12 million, the effect on GDP is \(-12 \times \text{MPS}\).

3. **Net Effect:** The net change in GDP is the sum of the effects of G and T:
   \[
   \Delta Y = 12 \times (2 - \text{MPS}) + (-12 \times \text{MPS})
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \Delta Y = 24 - 12 \times \text{MPS} - 12 \times \text{MPS} = 24
   \]
   The terms involving \(\text{MPS}\) cancel out, leaving a net increase in GDP of $24 million.

4. **Conclusion:** The overall impact of increasing both G and T by $12 million results in a $24 million increase in real GDP.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: Real GDP will increase by $24 million.**
