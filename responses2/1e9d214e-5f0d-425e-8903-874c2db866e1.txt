Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the interest rate for an installment plan. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says the desk is $125, and the plan includes a $16.25 down payment and 16 monthly payments of $7.50 each. I need to find the interest rate involved. The options are A to J, with various percentages.

First, I think I need to figure out the total amount paid through the installment plan. So the down payment is $16.25, and each month you pay $7.50 for 16 months. Let me calculate that. 7.50 multiplied by 16. Let's see, 7.5 * 10 is 75, 7.5 *6 is 45, so total is 75 +45=120. So total payments are 16 *7.50 = 120. Add the down payment: 120 +16.25 = 136.25. So the total amount paid is $136.25.

But the original price is $125. So the extra amount paid is 136.25 -125 = 11.25. That's the total interest paid over the term. So the interest amount is $11.25.

But wait, I think the way to calculate interest rates for installment plans is using the simple interest formula or maybe the present value of an ordinary annuity. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method here. Let me think.

The formula for installment payments is usually something like:

PMT = (P * r * (1 + r)^n ) / ((1 + r)^n -1 )

Where PMT is the monthly payment, P is the principal (the amount financed), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right formula. Alternatively, there's the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PV is the present value (the amount financed), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly rate, and n is the number of payments.

In this case, PV is $125, PMT is $7.50, n is 16, and we need to solve for r.

So the formula would be:

125 = 7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. I'm not sure how to solve for r in this equation algebraically. Maybe I can use trial and error, or perhaps use a financial calculator approach.

Alternatively, another way I remember is to calculate the interest rate by considering the total interest over the period. The total interest is $11.25. The original amount is $125. The time period is 16 months. But I think this is tricky because it's not just simple interest; the payments are spread over time, so the interest isn't just a simple percentage of the original amount.

Wait, maybe I should use the simple interest formula. Simple interest is calculated as I = P * r * t, where I is interest, P principal, r rate, t time in years. But this might not be the right approach here because the payments are spread over time, so it's actually an installment plan. So perhaps the better approach is to use the present value formula.

Another approach might be to use the formula for the monthly payment, but in reverse to find the rate.

Let me think about the present value of the payments. The present value should equal the amount paid, which is $125. So:

125 = 7.5 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

I can rearrange this equation to solve for r. But without a calculator, this might be difficult. Alternatively, I can use trial and error with possible rates.

Let me try some values. The options include various rates. Let's consider the possible answers.

Option D is 14.6%. Let's plug r=14.6% per month. Wait, but that seems high. Maybe I should think in terms of annual percentage rates.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the effective annual rate instead. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the monthly rate.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of an installment loan.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the effective rate.

Let me try to calculate this step by step.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the monthly interest rate.

Wait, I'll try to compute the right-hand side of the equation with different options to see which one makes the equation equal to 125.

Wait, let me write down the equation again:

125 = 7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

I can rearrange this to:

[ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] = 125 /7.50 = 16.666...

So the left side must equal approximately 16.666...

So, [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] = 16.666...

This is a bit tricky, but perhaps I can find a value of r that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, I can use logarithms or iterative methods, but perhaps I can make an educated guess.

Let me try some options.

Option D: 14.6% per month.

Wait, that's a very high rate. Let me compute the left side.

r=0.146 per month.

Compute (1 + r)^-16 = (1.146)^-16.

1.146^16 is a big number. Wait, but (1.146)^16 is roughly (1.146)^16.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1/(1 + r)^16.

But maybe using a calculator approach, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute at a higher rate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is about 14.6% annual rate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the interest rate using the present value of the payments.

Wait, another approach: The present value of the payments is equal to the amount financed, which is $125.

The present value (PV) is 125, the monthly payment (PMT) is 7.50, and the number of periods is 16.

The formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We can plug in the values:

125 = 7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Divide both sides by 7.50:

16.666... = (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r

So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r = 16.666...

Hmm, this is still tough without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the equation:

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) = 16.666... * r

So,

1 - (1 + r)^-16 = 16.666... r

But this seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an approximation. Let's assume that r is small, so (1 + r)^-16 ≈ 1 - 16r. Then,

1 - (1 - 16r) ≈16.666 r

Simplify:

16r ≈16.666 r

But that can't be right. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for small r, (1 + r)^n ≈ e^{n r}, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Rule of 78 or some other method, but that's probably not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the effective interest rate. The effective annual rate is (1 + monthly rate)^12 -1.

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the total interest as $11.25 over 16 months, which is an average of about 7.03% per month, but this doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I should try some of the options to see which gives the correct present value.

Option D is 14.6% per month.

So, let's calculate the present value factor.

First, compute (1 + r) = 1.146.

(1.146)^16 is a big number. Let me compute that approximately.

Let me compute 1.146^2 = 1.313.

1.146^4 = (1.313)^2 ≈ 1.724.

1.146^8 = (1.724)^2 ≈ 2.972.

1.146^16 = (2.972)^2 ≈8.833.

So, 1 - (1.146)^-16 = 1 - (1 /8.833) ≈ 1 - 0.1133 ≈0.8867.

Then, (0.8867) / (0.146) ≈6.006.

So, 7.50 * 6.006 ≈45.045. But the original amount is 125, so this would imply that the present value is 45.045, which is much less than 125. So the monthly rate is too low.

Wait, because at r=14.6%, the present value is 45.045, but we need it to be 125. So the required rate is higher.

Wait, because if the rate is higher, the present value would be lower, but our equation requires PV to be 125. Wait, perhaps I got the equation wrong.

Wait, the formula is PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

In this case, PV is 125, PMT is 7.50, n=16.

So [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] = 125 /7.50=16.666...

So, the left side must equal approximately 16.666...

So, for r=14.6%, we have the left side as approximately 6.006, which is much less than 16.666.

Which suggests that the required rate is higher than 14.6%. Because at higher r, the left side increases.

Wait, let's try a higher rate, say, option A: 16.3%.

Compute (1 +0.163)=1.163.

(1.163)^16. Let's compute:

1.163^2 = approx 1.353.

^4 = (1.353)^2 = approx 1.830.

^8 = (1.830)^2 = approx 3.349.

^16 = (3.349)^2 ≈11.217.

So, 1 - (1.163)^-16 = 1 - (1 /11.217) ≈1 -0.0892 ≈0.9108.

Then, 0.9108 / 0.163 ≈5.598.

So, 7.50 *5.598≈41.985. That's still much less than 125, so the PV would be 41.985, but we need 125. So the required rate is higher than 16.3%.

Wait, maybe I should try option C: 19.9% per month. That's higher.

r=19.9% per month.

Compute (1.199)^16.

Well, that's a big number. Let me approximate.

1.199^2 ≈ 1.437.

^4 = (1.437)^2 ≈2.064.

^8 = (2.064)^2 ≈4.26.

^16 = (4.26)^2=approx18.15.

So, 1 - (1.199)^-16 = 1 - 1/18.15≈0.943.

Divide by 0.199: 0.943 /0.199≈4.737.

Multiply by 7.50: 7.50 *4.737≈35.53. This is still much less than 125. So the required rate is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try a higher rate, but the options don't have higher rates. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try another angle.

Perhaps the interest is calculated as the difference between the amount paid and the principal. But that's the total interest, not the effective rate.

Wait, another formula I've heard is that the annual percentage rate (APR) is calculated as:

APR = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n - 1)) )

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the present value formula again.

Wait, the present value (PV) is $125. The monthly payment is $7.50, n=16, and we need to find r.

So, PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So, 125 =7.5 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Divide both sides by 7.5: 16.666... = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) =16.666... * r

Let me try r=14.6% per month, but I think earlier calculation showed that for r=14.6%, the PV is 41.985, which is way below 125. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the monthly rate is not as high as 14.6%, but the total interest is 11.25 over 16 months. Wait, that's an average of ~7.03% per month. But that's way too low because the total interest is $11.25 on $125, which is about 8.99% over 16 months, but that's the total interest.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the total interest as $11.25 over 16 months, which is about 7.03% per month. But that's the simple interest rate. But in this case, the payments are spread over time, so the simple interest isn't the same as the APR.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the effective annual rate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the present value factor for each option and see which one gives the PV equal to 125.

Let me try option D:14.6% per month.

Compute:

(1 + 0.146)^16 = 1.146^16. Let's compute this step by step.

1.146^2 = 1.313.

1.313^2 = 1.724.

1.724^2 = 2.972.

Wait, but 1.146^16 is (1.146^2)^8 = (1.313)^8.

But 1.313^2=1.724; 1.724^2=2.972.

So 1.313^8=2.972.

(1.146)^16=2.972.

So 1/(1.146)^16=1/2.972≈0.3367.

So,

(1 - 0.3367 ) =0.6633

Divide by r=0.146: 0.6633/0.146≈4.544.

Multiply by 7.50: 7.50 *4.544≈34.08. But PV should be 125, so this option is too low.

So, the required rate is higher than 14.6%.

Let me try option A:16.3% per month.

Compute (1.163)^16.

This will be a high number. Let me compute step by step.

1.163^2≈1.353.

^4≈(1.353)^2≈1.830.

^8≈(1.830)^2≈3.349.

^16≈(3.349)^2≈11.217.

So, 1/(1.163)^16≈0.08915.

(1 - 0.08915 )=0.91085.

Divide by r=0.163: 0.91085/0.163≈5.598.

Multiply by 7.50: 7.50 *5.598≈41.985. So PV is 41.985, which is way below 125. So the rate is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should try the options in the other direction. Let me try option B:17.8% per month.

Compute (1.178)^16.

Hmm, let me compute 1.178^2= approx 1.387.

^4= (1.387)^2≈1.923.

^8= (1.923)^2≈3.698.

^16= (3.698)^2≈13.68.

So, 1/(1.178)^16=1/13.68≈0.07315.

(1-0.07315)=0.92685.

Divide by r=0.178: 0.92685/0.178≈5.216.

Multiply by 7.50: 7.5 *5.216≈39.12. Still way below 125.

Hmm, perhaps I should try option E:18.5% per month.

Compute (1.185)^16.

1.185^2≈1.404.

^4≈(1.404)^2≈1.969.

^8≈(1.969)^2≈3.877.

^16≈(3.877)^2≈14.99.

So, 1/(1.185)^16≈1/14.99≈0.06673.

(1-0.06673)=0.93327.

Divide by r=0.185: 0.93327/0.185≈5.059.

Multiply by 7.50: 7.5 *5.059≈37.94. Still below 125.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the correct answer is option C:19.9% per month, but earlier calculations showed that the present value with that rate is way below 125.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula to compute the monthly rate. Let's use the given formula:

125 =7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Divide both sides by 7.50:

16.666... = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) =16.666... * r

Let me assume that (1 + r)^-16 ≈ e^(-16 r), but this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Newton-Raphson method to solve for r.

Let me set f(r) = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] -16.666...

I need to find r such that f(r)=0.

The Newton-Raphson method uses the derivative of f(r) to find the root.

But since this is getting complicated, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C:19.9% per month.

Wait, but earlier calculations for 19.9% gave a PV of 41.985, which is way too low. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should try option D again.

Wait, let me compute (1 +0.146)^16 again.

1.146^2=1.313.

^4= (1.313)^2=1.724.

^8= (1.724)^2=2.972.

^16= (2.972)^2=8.833.

So, 1/(1.146)^16=1/8.833≈0.1133.

(1 -0.1133)=0.8867.

Divide by 0.146: 0.8867 /0.146≈6.006.

Multiply by7.50: 7.50 *6.006≈45.045. So the PV is 45.045, which is way below 125. So option D is too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because the formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Which is correct.

So, in this case, the PV should be 125, so:

125 =7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

So, [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] =16.666...

So, the equation I'm trying to solve is:

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r =16.666...

Which can be rewritten as:

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) =16.666... * r

Now, let me try to rearrange this equation.

Let me move all terms to one side:

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) -16.666... * r =0

Let me define f(r) = (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) -16.666... * r.

We need to find r such that f(r)=0.

Now, let's calculate f(r) for some values of r.

First, let's try r=14.6% per month.

Compute:

(1 - (1.146)^-16 ) -16.666... *0.146.

We already computed (1 - (1.146)^-16 )=0.8867.

16.666... *0.146≈2.433.

So,

0.8867 -2.433≈-1.5463.

So, f(r)= -1.5463.

We need f(r)=0.

Now, let's try r=16.3% per month.

(1 - (1.163)^-16 ) -16.666... *0.163.

We computed (1 - (1.163)^-16 )=0.943.

16.666... *0.163≈2.736.

So,

0.943 -2.736≈-1.793.

Still negative.

Now, let's try r=19.9% per month.

(1 - (1.199)^-16 ) -16.666... *0.199.

We calculated (1 - (1.199)^-16 )=0.9108.

16.666... *0.199≈3.313.

So,

0.9108 -3.313≈-2.402.

Still negative.

So, f(r) is negative for r=14.6%, 16.3%,19.9%.

Wait, perhaps I should try a lower rate. But the options don't have lower rates.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the interest as the total amount paid minus principal, which is $11.25, but that's the total interest over 16 months, which is about 7.03% per month, but this isn't the APR.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the APR using the formula:

APR = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n - 1)) )

But I'm not sure if this formula is correct.

Wait, let me try this:

n=16, I=$11.25, P=$125.

APR = [ 2 *16 *11.25 ] / [125*(16-1) ]

Calculate numerator: 2*16=32, 32 *11.25=360.

Denominator:125 *15=1875.

So, APR=360/1875=0.192, which is 19.2%.

But that's the APR, which is the effective rate.

Wait, but the question is asking about the interest rate. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D:14.6% or option C:19.9%.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested that a higher rate would give a higher PV. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the present value of the amount is 125, so:

PV = (125) = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So,

7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] =125.

Divide both sides by 7.50:

[ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] =125/7.50=16.666...

So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) =16.666... * r.

Now, let me try to find r such that this equation holds.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate using trial and error.

Let me try r=14.6%:

(1 - (1.146)^-16 ) /0.146 ≈6.006.

Which is less than 16.666.

So, r needs to be higher.

Let me try r=16.3%:

(1 - (1.163)^-16 ) /0.163≈5.598.

Still less.

r=19.9%:

(1 - (1.199)^-16 ) /0.199≈-2.402.

Still negative.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the present value formula is wrong for this scenario. Let me double-check.

No, the formula PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] is correct for an ordinary annuity.

So, the formula is correct.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is option C:19.9% per month.

But earlier calculations for r=19.9% gave a PV of 41.985, which is way below 125.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

Question: "The last option is C:19.9% per month. So, the present value of the payment is 7.50 * [ (1 - (1 +0.199)^-16 ) /0.199 ].

Wait, perhaps I can compute this manually.

Compute (1 +0.199)^-16.

Wait, let me compute (1.199)^16.

But this is going to be a huge number, so (1.199)^-16 is a very small number.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (1.199)^16.

Let me compute (1.199)^2=1.437.

^4= (1.437)^2=2.063.

^8= (2.063)^2=4.254.

^16= (4.254)^2=18.10.

So, (1.199)^16=18.10.

So, 1/(1.199)^16=1/18.10≈0.0552.

So,

(1 -0.0552)=0.9448.

Divide by 0.199: 0.9448/0.199≈4.75.

Multiply by 7.50: 7.50 *4.75≈35.625. So, PV≈35.625, which is much less than 125. So, option C is not correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should calculate the interest rate using the formula for the simple interest. But the payments are spread over time, so the interest is computed on the amount paid each month.

Wait, perhaps the interest rate is the effective interest rate, which can be found by calculating the interest paid each month.

But the payments are made monthly, so the interest paid each month is based on the outstanding balance.

This approach is more complicated, but perhaps it's necessary.

Let me try this.

The present value is $125. The first payment is $7.50, so the amount paid is $7.50. The remaining balance is $125 - $7.50 = $117.50.

This is paid at the end of the first month. Now, the interest for the first month is calculated on $117.50.

So, the interest for the first month is $117.50 * r.

Then, the payment of $7.50 is made, which includes the interest and the principal.

So, the interest for the first month is $117.50 * r.

The principal paid is $7.50 - interest.

The new balance is $117.50 - (7.50 - interest) = $117.50 -7.50 + interest = $110 + interest.

Now, this new balance is $110 + interest, and the interest for the next month is calculated on that amount.

And this continues until the total payments equal $125.

This method is called the loan amortization method, and it's more accurate to compute the interest rate.

But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to compute step by step.

First, initial balance: $125.

Payment: $7.50.

Interest for first month: 125 * r.

Principal paid: 7.50 - 125 * r.

New balance: 125 - (7.50 - 125 * r) = 125 -7.50 +125*r=117.50 +125*r.

Now, interest for second month: (117.50 +125*r) * r.

Principal paid: 7.50 - (117.50 +125*r) * r.

New balance: (117.50 +125*r) - [7.50 - (117.50 +125*r)*r ] =117.50 +125*r -7.50 + (117.50 +125*r)*r =110 +125*r + (117.50 +125*r)*r.

This is getting complicated, but perhaps I can set up an equation.

The total payments are $125, so the sum of all principal payments plus all interest payments equals $125.

But this approach requires setting up equations for each month, which is time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate method.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the interest rate using the present value.

Wait, the present value is $125, and the present value factor is [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ].

So,

125 =7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

Divide both sides by7.50:

16.666...= [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) =16.666... * r

Hmm, perhaps I can use an iterative approach.

Let me start with an initial guess for r.

Suppose r=14.6% per month.

Compute (1 - (1.146)^-16 ) /0.146.

We already calculated this earlier and found it to be approximately 6.006.

Which is less than 16.666.

So, I need to increase r.

Let me try r=16.3% per month.

Compute (1 - (1.163)^-16 ) /0.163.

Earlier, this gave approximately 5.598, which is less than 16.666.

So, I need to increase r further.

Wait, but perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the relationship between r and the PV factor.

As r increases, [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] increases.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, let me think about it: as r increases, the present value factor increases.

For example, if r increases to 16.3%, the present value factor increases.

Wait, no, the present value factor is [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

So, as r increases, the numerator (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) decreases, but the denominator increases. So, the overall effect depends on the balance.

But perhaps I can think of it as a function of r.

So, let me define f(r) = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ].

We have f(14.6%)≈6.006

f(16.3%)≈5.598

Wait, but f(r) is decreasing as r increases.

Wait, perhaps I should try r=20% to see what happens.

Compute (1 - (1.2)^-16 ) /0.2.

(1.2)^-16 =1/(1.2)^16.

1.2^16= about 13.4.

So, 1.2^-16≈1/13.4≈0.0746.

So,

1 -0.0746=0.9254.

Divide by 0.2: 4.627.

So, f(20%)≈4.627.

So, as r increases, f(r) decreases.

But in our problem, f(r)=16.666.

Wait, but for r=14.6%, f(r)=6.006.

Which is much less than 16.666.

Wait, so perhaps the correct r is higher than 14.6% but lower than 16.3%, but my earlier calculations didn't show that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for r=16.3%.

Let me try again.

Compute f(r)= [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ].

r=16.3% per month.

Compute (1 +0.163)^-16 =1/(1.163)^16.

Compute (1.163)^16.

Let me compute step by step:

1.163^2=1.163*1.163≈1.353.

1.353^2≈1.833.

1.833^2≈3.361.

1.163^4≈3.361.

1.163^8≈3.361^2≈11.304.

1.163^16≈11.304^2≈127.8.

So, (1.163)^16≈127.8.

Thus, (1.163)^-16≈1/127.8≈0.00783.

So,

1 -0.00783≈0.99217.

Divide by 0.163:

0.99217 /0.163≈6.076.

So, f(16.3%)≈6.076, which is still less than 16.666.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that f(r) was decreasing as r increases.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try r=20% per month.

(1.2)^-16=1/(1.2)^16.

Compute (1.2)^16.

1.2^2=1.44

1.44^2=2.0736

2.0736^2≈4.298

4.298^2≈18.45

1.2^8≈18.45.

1.2^16≈18.45^2≈339.1.

So, (1.2)^-16≈1/339.1≈0.002955.

So,

1 -0.002955=0.997045.

Divide by 0.2: 4.985.

So, f(20%)≈4.985.

So, as r increases, f(r) decreases.

Wait, so to get f(r)=16.666, I need to find an r where f(r)=16.666.

But from the calculations, f(r) is decreasing as r increases.

Wait, that suggests that f(r) is maximum at r=14.6%, and decreases as r increases.

So, if I set f(r)=16.666, there's no r that satisfies this, because f(r) never reaches 16.666.

Wait, but that can't be, because the present value factor can't be negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps the formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Which is correct.

But the present value factor is a number between 0 and 1.

Wait, if PMT is negative, then PV would be positive.

Wait, but in our case, PMT is $7.50, which is positive.

So, PV is positive.

Wait, but the present value factor is [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

Which is always less than 1/(r), but depends on r.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] = [1/r - (1 + r)^-n ].

So, the present value factor is [1/r] - [ (1 + r)^-n ].

So, if [1/r] is much larger than [ (1 + r)^-n ], then the present value factor is positive.

But in our problem, f(r)=16.666.

Wait, but 1/r must be greater than 16.666, which would mean r < 1/16.666≈0.06.

So, r would have to be less than 0.06 or 0.6%.

But that's a very low interest rate.

But the options given don't have a rate below 14.6% or 19.9%.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the present value factor is [1/r] - [ (1 + r)^-n ].

So, rearranged, the equation becomes:

[1/r] - [ (1 + r)^-n ] =16.666.

Which can be rewritten as:

[1/r] -16.666= [ (1 + r)^-n ]

So,

[ (1 + r)^-n ] = 1/r -16.666

Which is:

[ (1 + r)^-n ] = (1 -16.666 r)/r.

So,

(1 + r)^-n = (1 -16.666 r)/r.

Which can be rewritten as:

(1 + r)^-n = (1/r) -16.666.

So, [1/r -16.666] = (1 + r)^-n.

But this seems circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take logarithms on both sides.

Taking natural logarithm:

ln( (1 + r)^-n ) = ln( (1/r) -16.666 )

Which gives:

- n * ln(1 + r) = ln( (1/r) -16.666 )

So,

n * ln(1 + r) = - ln( (1/r) -16.666 )

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use trial and error.

But given that all possible r values are above 0.06, which is not in the options, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the present value factor cannot be 16.666, which suggests that perhaps the problem is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Which is correct.

Wait, but if I consider that the present value is $125, and the monthly payment is $7.50, perhaps I can compute the interest rate using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity.

But perhaps I can use the formula:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

So, rearranged:

r = [ (PMT * PV) / (PV - PMT) ) ] -1

Wait, that might be a possible way.

Wait, let me try that.

r = ( (PMT * PV) / (PV - PMT) ) -1.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

PMT =7.50, PV=125.

So,

r= ( (7.50 * 125 ) / (125 -7.50) ) -1

Compute 7.50*125=937.5.

Denominator:125-7.50=117.5.

So,

r= (937.5 /117.5 ) -1.

Compute 937.5 /117.5.

117.5 *8=940.

So, 937.5 /117.5=8 - (2.5/117.5)=8-0.0213=7.9787.

So,

r=7.9787 -1=6.9787%.

So, approximately 6.9787%, which is about 7%.

Wait, but this is the r calculated using that formula.

But earlier, when I tried to compute f(r)= [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]=16.666, there was no solution.

But perhaps that approach was incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the present value formula to solve for r, treating it as a non-linear equation.

So, perhaps we can set up the equation as follows:

7.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] =125.

So,

[ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ] =125/7.50=16.666...

So,

16.666...= [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ]

So,

[ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) ] =16.666... * r.

So,

(1 + r)^-16=1 -16.666... r.

So,

(1 + r)^-16 = (1 -16.666 r)/1.

So,

(1 + r)^-16 = (1 -16.666 r).

Wait, perhaps I can take natural logs on both sides.

ln(1 + r)^-16 = ln(1 -16.666 r).

Which is:

-16 ln(1 + r)= ln(1 -16.666 r).

Hmm, this is a complex equation to solve analytically.

Perhaps I can use numerical methods.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate.

Wait, since r is positive, let's consider that 16.666 r is less than 1, so 16.666 r <1.

So, r <1/16.666≈0.06.

So, r <0.06.

So, let's try r=0.05.

Compute right side:1 -16.666*0.05=1 -0.8333=0.1667.

So, ln(0.1667)= -1.7718.

Left side: -16 * ln(1.05)= -16 *0.09531= -1.525.

So, -1.525 vs -1.7718. Not equal.

So, perhaps r is higher than 0.05.

Wait, but earlier when I tried r=0.146 (14.6%), f(r)=6.006, and r=0.163 (16.3%), f(r)=6.076.

Wait, but in the problem, we have f(r)=16.666, which is much higher.

Wait, so perhaps the correct approach is to find an r where f(r)=16.666, but earlier calculations suggest that f(r) is maximum at r=14.6% and decreases as r increases.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the present value factor cannot be 16.666, which suggests that perhaps the problem is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for r=0.146, f(r)=6.006, and for r=0.163, f(r)=6.076.

Wait, so f(r) is increasing as r increases.

Wait, that contradicts earlier calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating f(r) for higher r.

Let me recalculate f(r) for higher r.

Compute f(r)= [ (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) / r ].

Let me try r=0.146.

Compute (1 +0.146)^-16=1/(1.146)^16.

Compute 1.146^2=1.300.

1.300^2=1.690.

1.146^4=1.690^2=2.856.

1.146^8=2.856^2≈8.157.

1.146^16=8.157^2≈66.13.

So, (1.146)^16≈66.13.

So, (1.146)^-16=1/66.13≈0.01513.

So,

1 -0.01513=0.98487.

Divide by 0.146:

0.98487 /0.146≈6.708.

So, f(r)=6.708.

Wait, earlier, I thought it was 6.006, but this calculation shows it's 6.708.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake before.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1 + r)^-16 for r=0.146.

So, 1.146^2=1.146*1.146≈1.300.

1.300^2=1.690.

1.690^2=2.856.

1.146^8=2.856^2≈8.157.

1.146^16≈8.157^2≈66.13.

So, (1.146)^16≈66.13, so (1.146)^-16=1/66.13≈0.01513.

Thus,

1 -0.01513=0.98487.

Divide by 0.146: 0.98487 /0.146≈6.708.

So, f(r)=6.708.

So, for r=0.146, f(r)=6.708.

Similarly, for r=0.163, let's compute f(r).

Compute (1 +0.163)^-16.

1.163^2=1.167.

1.167^2≈1.354.

1.354^2≈1.833.

1.833^2≈3.329.

1.163^8=3.329^2≈11.06.

1.163^16=11.06^2≈122.5.

So, (1.163)^16≈122.5.

So, (1.163)^-16≈1/122.5≈0.00819.

So,

1 -0.00819=0.99181.

Divide by 0.163:

0.99181 /0.163≈6.076.

So, f(r)=6.076.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that when r increases, f(r) decreases.

Wait, but in this calculation, for r=0.146, f(r)=6.708, and for r=0.163, f(r)=6.076.

So, as r increases, f(r) decreases.

So, that suggests that f(r) is maximum at r=0.146 and decreases as r increases.

But then, in our problem, we have f(r)=16.666, which is much higher.

But according to this, as r approaches zero, f(r) approaches infinity.

Wait, because as r approaches zero, (1 + r)^-16 approaches 1, so (1 - (1 + r)^-16 ) approaches 0, but divided by r approaches infinity.

Wait, so f(r) approaches infinity as r approaches zero.

Wait, so that would suggest that f(r) can get very large, up to infinity as r approaches zero.

So, perhaps the given problem is impossible, because f(r) can't be 16.666.

Wait, but according to the previous calculation, when r=0.146, f(r)=6.708, which is less than 16.666.

Wait, but perhaps when r is very small, f(r) becomes very large.

Wait, let's try r=0.05.

Compute (1.05)^16.

1.05^2=1.040.

1.040^2=1.024.

1.024^2=1.015.

1.015^2=1.015.

Wait, this is getting too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that f(r) can be as high as needed, but in reality, the maximum possible f(r) is when r approaches zero, making f(r) approach infinity.

So, perhaps the question is correct, but the calculation shows that f(r)=16.666 is possible.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the equation:

(1 + r)^-16 =1 -16.666 r.

Wait, let me take natural logs:

-16 ln(1 + r)= ln(1 -16.666 r).

Which is:

-16*(r - r^2/2 + r^3/3 - ...) ≈ (-16)(r - (r)^2/2 + (r)^3/3 - ... )

On the right side:

ln(1 -16.666 r) ≈ -16.666 r - ( (16.666)^2 ) /2 * r^2 - ( (16.666)^3 ) /3 * r^3 - ...

So, equating both sides:

-16*(r - r^2/2 + r^3/3 ...) ≈ -16.666 r - ( (16.666)^2 ) /2 * r^2 - ( (16.666)^3 ) /3 * r^3 ...

Simplify:

-16r +8r^2 - (16/3) r^3 + ... ≈ -16.666 r - ( (16.666)^2 /2 ) r^2 - ( (16.666)^3 /3 ) r^3 + ...

Bring all terms to left side:

-16r +8r^2 - (16/3) r^3 + ... +16.666r + ( (16.666)^2 /2 ) r^2 + ( (16.666)^3 /3 ) r^3 + ... =0.

Compute each term:

For r^0: -16 +16.666=0.666.

For r^1: -16 +16.666=0.666.

For r^2: 8 + (16.666)^2 /2.

Compute (16.666)^2 =277.777.

Divide by 2: 138.883.

So, 8 +138.89=147.89.

For r^3: -(16/3) + (16.666)^3 /3.

Compute (16.666)^3=4664.56.

Divide by 3:1534.866.

So, -(16/3)= -5.333.

So, -5.333 +1534.866=1529.533.

So, the equation becomes:

0.667 +0.667 r +147.89 r^2 +1529.533 r^3 + ... =0.

But this is impossible because all terms are positive, and the sum cannot be zero.

Wait, this suggests that the equation has no solution, meaning that it's impossible to achieve a present value factor of 16.666 with the given parameters.

Therefore, the problem as stated is impossible.

So, the present value factor cannot be 16.666.

Hence, the problem is incorrectly posed.
</think>

The problem as stated is incorrect because it's impossible to achieve a present value factor of 16.666. The present value factor for an ordinary annuity (PVIFA) is maximized as the interest rate approaches zero, but it cannot exceed infinity. Therefore, the given problem has no solution.

$\boxed{\text{Problem has no solution}}$
