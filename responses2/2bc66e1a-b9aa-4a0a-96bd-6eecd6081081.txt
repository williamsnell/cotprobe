Question:

Occasionally a boy is born withundescendedtestes (cryptorchidism), and he will be sterile unless they are surgically caused to descend into the scrotum. Explain the reason for this.

Options:

A: Human sperm cannot develop at the high temperature found within the body cavity.
B: The testes require the lower pressure environment of the scrotum for sperm maturation
C: Testes must be in the scrotum to properly attach to the vas deferens
D: The scrotum provides the necessary nutrients for sperm development
E: Gravity is required for the testes to function properly
F: Undescended testes result in hormonal imbalances that prevent sperm production
G: The testes need to be in the scrotum for aesthetic reasons
H: Undescended testes can lead to cancer
I: The scrotum is the only place where the testes can receive oxygen
J: Testes descend into the scrotum to make room for other organs

Okay, so I have this question about a boy born with undescended testes, which is called cryptorchidism. The question is asking why this happens. I remember something about the scrotum and the testes being connected. Let me think.

Hmm, undescended testes means the testes are in the scalene, not the scrotum. So the body can't produce enough sperm, which makes him sterile. How does that work?

I think it has to do with the scrotum and the testes being in different locations. The testes are in the scrotum, right? When they're there, they can't move or develop properly because the area is too small. The testes probably don't develop during the testicular phase of the test because they can't receive enough blood or oxygen.

Wait, so the process of testicular development involves the testes moving into the scrotum. If the testes are already there, the body can't develop the testes further. That's why they can't produce sperm. So the scrotum is needed to attach the testes and allow them to develop. Without the scrotum, the testes can't undergo the necessary maturation.

Looking at the options, option J says that the testes descend into the scrotum to make room for other organs. That makes sense because without the scrotum, the testes can't develop, leading to infertility. So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: The testes descend into the scrotum to make room for other organs.
