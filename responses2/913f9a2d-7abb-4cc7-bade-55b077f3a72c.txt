Okay, so I've got this exchange rate problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives me the price of a British pound and a German mark in terms of dollars. It's asking about converting between the two. 

Part a) says: What should the price of a British pound be in terms of German marks? Hmm. So, if a British pound is \$2.00, and a German mark is \$0.40, how many marks would a pound be worth?

Wait, I think exchange rates can be a bit tricky. Let me think. If 1 pound is $2, and 1 mark is $0.40, then how many marks would $2 buy? Oh right, you divide. So pounds per mark. So 2 divided by 0.40 is 5. So a pound is 5 marks. That would make sense. So part a) is 5 marks. Looking at the options, I see option B says 5 marks and $0.40. Wait, no, the second number in each option is the exchange rate. Wait, wait, the question is asking for the price in terms of German marks. So the answer would be 5 marks per pound, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let me list them:

Option B: 5 marks, $0.40. So 5 marks for a pound, and $0.40. Wait, that doesn't seem right because if the pound is more expensive in dollars, it should be worth more marks. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the pound is \$2, and each mark is \$0.40, how many marks would a pound be worth? So 2 / 0.40 = 5. So 5 marks. So the pound should be 5 marks. So the exchange rate would be 5 marks per pound. So the answer for part a) should be 5 marks, and the rate would be 5 marks per pound. But the options for each part have a number followed by a dollar amount. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, wait, the first number is the amount in terms of the other currency. So a) is asking, what's the price of a British pound in terms of German marks. So in terms of marks, it's 5 marks. So the answer would be 5 marks, which is the first number, and then the second number would be the exchange rate, like how much a mark would cost in dollars. So 5 marks per pound, and the dollar amount would be 0.40 per mark? Or wait, no. Because the pound is more expensive, so in terms of marks, a pound would be worth more. So maybe the exchange rate is 5 marks per 1 pound. So in terms of marks, the pound is 5, and the dollar per mark is $0.40. So for part a), the answer would be 5 marks, with the dollar being 0.40. Looking at the options, that's option B. So a) answer is 5 marks, $0.40. 

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Oh, the options for each part are like '5 marks, $something'—so part a) is part of the first number. So for a), the answer is 5 marks, with each mark costing 0.40 dollars. So in the options, B is 5 marks and $0.40.

So part a) is option B, which is 5 marks and $0.40.

Now part b) is more complex. It says, if the market is paying 6 marks for every British pound, how can an Englishman make an arbitrage profit?

Hmm, so the market is trading at 6 marks per pound, but according to my part a), the pound should be 5 marks. So the market is at 6, which is higher than 5. So that's a situation of overvalued or undervalued?

Wait, exchange rates can be confusing. Let me think. If the pound is supposed to be 5 marks, and the market is saying it's 6, that means the pound is overpriced. Because 6 marks would be more expensive than 5. So if an Englishman buys the pound at the market price (6 marks) and then converts it into marks, he could get more marks than he should. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If a British pound is 5 marks, then 6 marks would mean that purchasing the pound for 6 marks is cheaper than 5. So the pound is overpriced by the market. So the market is paying 6, but it should be 5. So the market is overvaluing the pound. So an Englishman could buy the pound at the market price (6 marks) and then sell the pound in terms of marks, getting more than the 5. 

Wait, no. Let me approach this more methodically. Exchange rates can be confusing, so let's model this.

The exchange rate is usually expressed as 1 unit of currency A per unit of currency B. So, 1 British pound (GBP) equals X marks (EUR).

In part a), we found that 1 GBP = 5 EUR. So the exchange rate is 5.

But now, the market is saying 6 marks per pound. So the market rate is 6 EUR per GBP.

Wait, that's different. So the market is saying 1 GBP costs 6 EUR. But our calculation says 1 GBP is 5 EUR. So the market is saying 1 GBP is more expensive than our calculation. So the market is overvaluing the pound. So when the market says 6, but our calculation is 5, so the market is saying the pound is worth more than it should be.

So an Englishman can exploit this by buying the pound at the market's price (6 marks) but then sell it in terms of marks. Wait, but that's not possible because that's what it's supposed to be. Alternatively, perhaps he can sell the pound (which is overpriced) for more marks. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the approach is buying the pound at the market rate (6 marks) and then selling it in USD. But how would that work? Because if he buys the pound for 6 marks, and the market says it's 5 marks, then he would get more marks than he paid. Wait, no. Let me model it.

Suppose I have 1 pound. The market price is 6 marks per pound. But according to my calculation, 1 pound should be 5 marks. So the market is saying the pound is worth more than it is. So the person can buy the pound for 6 marks, and then sell it for 5 marks. But that would give him a profit.

Wait, but wait. If you're in the US, and you buy a pound for 6 marks (i.e., 6 dollars), and then the pound is actually worth 5 marks, you can sell it for 5 dollars. So your profit is 6 (buying) -5 (selling) = +1 per pound.

Wait, but that's a profit. So the Englishman would do this.

So, for example, if he has 100 pounds, he buys each at 6 marks (100 pounds × 6 = 600 marks), then sells each at 5 marks (100 ×5=500 marks). So he makes 600-500=100 marks profit. Or, in terms of USD, but the question is about arbitrage. So he can buy the pound for 6 marks, then sell it for 5 marks, making a profit. So the profit would be 1 mark per pound.

But wait, the question is about how he can make an arbitrage profit, not the profit per pound. So the answer is that he can buy the pound in the market (i.e., at 6 marks) and then sell it for 5 marks, making a profit. Alternatively, perhaps he can buy the pound at 6 marks and then sell it in USD, but I think the point is he's converting it into marks.

Wait, another approach: The market is selling the pound at 6 marks. So to get more marks than the market rate, he can buy the pound and sell it in marks. So, let's think in terms of the exchange rates.

If the market is at 6 marks per pound, but the actual rate is 5 marks per pound, then the market is overpriced. So he can buy the pound for 6 marks but sell it for 5 marks, making a profit.

So if an Englishman buys the pound at 6 marks and then sells it in marks, he gets 5 marks, which is less than he paid. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I must have the exchange rates wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as exchange rates between USD and the two currencies. Let me set it up.

Let’s define:

- 1 GBP = 2 dollars (from the given: 1 pound is $2)
- 1 mark (GB) = 0.40 dollars (from given: 1 mark is $0.40)

But part a) was to convert 1 GBP to marks, which we did earlier, getting 5 marks.

But in part b), the market is saying 1 GBP is 6 marks.

Wait, that would mean that the market rate is 6 marks per pound. But according to part a), it should be 5. So the market is saying 1 GBP is worth 6 marks, which is more expensive than 5. So the market is overvaluing the pound.

So, an Englishman can exploit this by buying the pound (which is overpriced at the market) in USD terms. Wait, but what's the correct approach. Let me think in terms of exchange rates.

The exchange rate between GBP and USD is 1 USD = 0.5 GBP (since 1 GBP is $2, so 1 USD is half a GBP). The exchange rate between GBP and mark is either 1 GBP = 5 marks (as computed earlier) or 1 mark = 0.20 GBP (since 5 marks = 1 GBP, so 1 mark is 0.20 GBP).

But the market says 1 GBP = 6 marks. So the exchange rate is 1 GBP = 6 marks.

But according to our calculation, 1 GBP should be 5 marks. So the market is saying 1 GBP is 6, which is more expensive.

So the person can buy the pound in the market (for 6 marks per pound) and then sell it in terms of marks. Wait, but that's not how it works. Because the pound is overpriced. So when you buy the pound in USD, say you have 100 USD, and the market is selling it for 6 marks. So you buy 100 USD, which gets you 100 × 0.5 = 50 GBP. Then, you sell that 50 GBP at the market rate of 6 marks per pound. Wait, no. Wait, 50 GBP is how much in marks? Wait, 50 GBP is equal to 50 × (5 marks) = 250 marks. But the market says 1 GBP is 6 marks. So 50 GBP would be 50 ×6=300 marks. Wait, that's more than 250. So you could sell it for 300 marks, which is 50 marks more than what you bought. So you can make a profit.

Alternatively, the Englishman can buy the pound for 6 marks and then sell it for 5 marks. But that would require the pound to be worth 5 marks, which it isn't. So maybe the correct way is to buy the pound in USD and then sell it in marks.

Wait, let me model this.

If the exchange rate is 1 USD = 0.5 GBP, then 100 USD buys you 50 GBP.

But the market says 1 GBP is 6 marks. So 50 GBP is 50 × 6 = 300 marks.

So you have 300 marks.

Alternatively, if the market is at 6 marks per pound, and you buy 50 GBP for 6 marks per pound, then 50 GBP ×6 marks/GBP = 300 marks.

But then, if you sell it in USD, you get 300 marks. So the profit is 300 marks - but that's in terms of USD? Or in marks. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is: If I have 100 USD, I can buy 100 USD / 0.5 GBP/USD = 200 GBP.

At the market, 1 GBP is 6 marks. So 200 GBP is 200 ×6 = 1200 marks.

Alternatively, if the market were at 5 marks per GBP, 200 GBP would be 1000 marks. So the difference is 200 marks profit. So the Englishman can buy the pound for 6 marks, which is more expensive than the market's 5 marks. So the profit would be 200 marks.

Wait, but that's in terms of marks. So he makes a profit of 200 marks. So he can buy 100 USD, get 200 GBP (because 100 USD buys 200 GBP), and then sell those 200 GBP for 1200 marks. So the profit is 1200 - 1000 (if market were at 5) = 200 marks profit.

So the Englishman can make an arbitrage by buying the pound in the market (for 6 marks) and then selling it in USD, getting more marks than he would have bought it for if the market were at 5. Alternatively, he can buy in terms of USD, convert to GBP, then sell the GBP in the market.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to buy the pound in USD and then sell it in USD again, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The way to do it is to buy the pound in the market (6 marks) and then sell it in USD, getting more marks.

So the answer would be: the Englishman can buy the pound in the market (6 marks) and then sell it in USD for the same amount, but then get more marks than he would have bought it for if the market were at 5. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, another way: the Englishman wants to convert the pound into marks. So if he buys 1 pound for 6 marks, and then sells it in terms of marks, but that wouldn't make sense because the market says it's worth 5 marks. 

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the exchange rates to find how much profit he can make. Let's think in terms of USD.

If he has X USD, he can buy Y pounds, where Y = X / 0.5 (since 1 USD is 0.5 GBP).

Then, he sells those Y pounds in the market at 6 marks per pound. Wait, but that's confusing. Let me model it.

Suppose he has $100.

He can convert $100 into 200 GBP (since 1 USD = 0.5 GBP → 100 USD → 50 GBP → 50 × 2 = 100 GBP? Wait, no. Wait, 1 USD = 0.5 GBP. So $100 USD is 100 ×0.5 =50 GBP.

Now, the market says 1 GBP is 6 marks. So 50 GBP is 50 ×6 =300 marks.

So he can sell 50 GBP for 300 marks.

But what's the value if the market were at 5 marks per GBP? 50 ×5=250 marks. So selling at 6 marks per GBP, he gets 300. So the difference is 50 marks profit.

Wait, that's a profit of 50 marks. So he can make a 50 marks profit by buying 50 GBP for 6 marks, then selling for 300 marks.

So the profit is 300 - 250 =50 marks. So he can make a 50 mark profit.

But the options give different profit amounts. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options given, part b) gives options like:

A: 3 marks, $0.60

B:5 marks, $0.40

C:4 marks, $0.45

Etc.

Wait, the correct answer for part b) would be 5 marks profit, and the exchange rate would be $0.40 per mark. Because when the market is selling the pound at 6 marks, which is more expensive than 5. So the correct option is B:5 marks, $0.40. So the Englishman can make a 5 mark profit by buying the pound at 6 marks and selling it in terms of marks, getting 5 marks more than he would have paid if the market were at 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B:5 marks, $0.40.

The question involves converting British pounds (GBP) to German marks (EUR) and exploiting an arbitrage profit in the foreign exchange market. Here's the analysis:

---

### Part (a): Price of a British pound in terms of German marks  
The problem states that 1 GBP = $2.00 and 1 mark = $0.40. To find the equivalent in marks, divide the GBP value by the exchange rate of marks:  
\[
\text{Price in marks} = \frac{\text{GBP value}}{\text{Mark exchange rate}} = \frac{2.00}{0.40} = 5.00 \, \text{marks}.
\]  
Thus, the price of a British pound in terms of German marks is **5 marks**.  

---

### Part (b): Arbitrage profit in the foreign exchange market  
The market is offering 6 marks per pound, while the calculated price is 5 marks. This indicates that the market is overpriced (6 marks per pound = more expensive than 5 marks per pound). To exploit this arbitrage, the Englishman can:  
1. **Buy the pound at the market price (6 marks per pound)**.  
2. **Sell the pound in terms of marks**.  

If the market price is 6 marks per pound, and the calculated price is 5 marks per pound, the Englishman can make a profit by buying the pound at 6 marks and selling it at 5 marks. The profit per pound is:  
\[
\text{Profit per pound} = 6 - 5 = 1 \, \text{mark}.
\]  
However, the question asks for the arbitrage profit in terms of marks and the exchange rate. From the options, the correct answer is:  
- **5 marks profit**  
- **$0.40 per mark**  

Thus, the Englishman can make an arbitrage profit by buying the pound at 6 marks and selling it in marks, earning 5 marks profit.
