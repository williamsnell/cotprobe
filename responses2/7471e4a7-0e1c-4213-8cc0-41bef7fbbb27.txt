Okay, so I have this question about whether the space C[0,1] with the L1 norm is a Banach space. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on Banach spaces, but let me try to think this through.

Wait, I remember that a Banach space is a complete normed vector space. So, first, I need to confirm that (C[0,1], ||·||₁) is a normed vector space. I think C[0,1] is the set of all continuous functions on [0,1], and the norm is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of the absolute value of f(t) dt. That part I think I get.

Now, the question is whether this space is complete under this norm. Completeness means that every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a limit that's also in the space. So, I need to figure out if every sequence of functions in C[0,1] that's Cauchy in the L1 norm actually converges to a continuous function in C[0,1].

Wait, but I remember that not all Cauchy sequences of continuous functions converge to a continuous function. There are cases where the limit is discontinuous. For example, consider the sequence of functions that approximate a step function, like the triangular spike becoming more pronounced. These functions would be continuous, but their limit might have a jump discontinuity.

Oh right, the example I'm thinking of is the sequence of functions f_n(x) defined as x for x ≤ 1/n and (x - 1/n) for x ≥ 1/n. Wait, no, that might not be continuous. Alternatively, maybe the sequence could be something like f_n(x) = x^n. Each f_n is continuous on [0,1], and as n increases, f_n approaches the zero function on [0,1) and 1 at x=1. So f_n(x) is continuous on [0,1], but the limit function is not continuous—it's discontinuous at x=1.

Wait, but does that zero function at x=1 count as a point of discontinuity? So, the limit function isn't in C[0,1], which means that the sequence doesn't converge in C[0,1]. Therefore, the space isn't complete, right? Because the limit isn't in the space. So, (C[0,1], ||·||₁) isn't a Banach space.

Alternatively, wait another thought: Could there be a Cauchy sequence in C[0,1] that converges to a discontinuous function? I think yes. And if that's the case, then the space isn't complete, so it's not a Banach space.

So, putting this together: since there exist Cauchy sequences in C[0,1] that don't converge within C[0,1], the space is not complete. Therefore, it's not a Banach space. So the answer should be 0, which is option E.

Wait, but I also remember that C[0,1] is a subset of L1[0,1], but not necessarily a Banach space itself. Because L1 is a Banach space, but C[0,1] isn't. So, yeah, the answer is no, it's not a Banach space. So the correct answer is 0.

The space \( C[0,1] \) with the \( L^1 \) norm is not a Banach space. This is because there exist Cauchy sequences in \( C[0,1] \) that converge to a discontinuous function, which is not in \( C[0,1] \). Therefore, the space is not complete.

Answer: E
