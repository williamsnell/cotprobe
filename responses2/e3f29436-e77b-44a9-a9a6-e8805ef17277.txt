Question:

After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 42-year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel. During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?

Options:

A: Advise her to drink more wine to help with the pain
B: Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone
C: Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally
D: Recommend a consultation with a psychiatrist to address her fears of addiction
E: Suggest biofeedback therapy to control pain
F: Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam
G: Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule
H: Administer methadone as an alternative to morphine
I: Increase the dose of morphine to relieve her anxiety
J: Encourage the patient to endure the pain without medication to prevent addiction

Okay, so I have this medical question here about a patient and her morphine use. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the scenario is that a 42-year-old woman had a severe injury to her abdomen and underwent several surgical procedures: resection of a perforated bowel, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur. That's a lot, but I think the main issue here is her pain management after the operation.

She's receiving morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She's awake but not completely alert. She drinks wine once a week, which makes me think she's not on medication for substance use disorder, but she's using alcohol. Wait, but the question is about her addiction to morphine. So, she's worried about becoming addicted. She's drinking wine, which is just a regular alcohol, but she's using it for pain management.

The question asks what the physician should do first. The options are A to J. Let me look at each option.

Option A says to advise her to drink more wine. That might help with pain, but is that the initial action? I don't think so. She's already using wine for drinking, but the question is about managing her morphine. So maybe she's just using it for pain, not seeking medical advice. So A might not be the first step.

Option B suggests maintaining the morphine but administering naloxone periodically. Naloxone is used for opioid overdoses. But she's not sure if she's using it in a way that could lead to that. And she's not a heavy user; she's a moderate to occasional user. So I'm not sure if she needs to be administered at all. Plus, the question is about her initial action, which might be more about her current pain management rather than course management.

Option C: Switch to oral acetaminophen. That's a common first-line pain reliever. But why would the physician suggest that? She's already given morphine. There's probably a concern she's not managing her pain properly without more medication or a different approach. Switching to acetaminophen could be a way to manage her pain if she's not getting better. But I'm not sure if that's the first priority. Maybe she's just not sure if it's the right approach.

Option D: Consult a psychiatrist to address addiction fears. That makes sense because if she's worried about becoming addicted, consulting a professional would address her concerns early. People with substance use disorders often have those worries, and a psychiatrist can provide guidance. Without seeing her, she might not know if she's at risk or if there's another way to treat the pain.

Option E: Suggest biofeedback therapy. Biofeedback is a form of pharmacotherapy that uses brain activity to help manage pain. I think it's an option, but not sure if it's the first step. It's more of a treatment approach, maybe for chronic pain, which she has. So perhaps it's a way to manage her pain without needing to change her medication.

Option F: Switch to intramuscular lorazepam. That's a benzodiazepine, commonly used for pain. I've heard that it can be effective for chronic pain, so maybe that's a good option. But again, is that the first action? She's already receiving morphine, so switching might be a way to manage her pain, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate first step.

Option G: Reassure her chance of addiction is minuscule. That's a good approach. If she's not addicted, she'd be better off managing her pain. But if she's worried, reassurance is crucial. So G seems to be a good initial step.

Option H: Administer methadone. Methadone is used for substance use disorders, specifically for pain management. But she's not on a substance use disorder, and she's a moderate user. Methadone would be for those who have a history of addiction and can't stop, so H doesn't seem right.

Option I: Increase morphine dose. But she's already given morphine, so increasing might not help. It might lead to more severe effects.

Option J: Encourage endurance without medication. This is about patient control. She's not on medication, so that's a possibility. It's a way to manage pain without needing to use morphine.

So the question is, what's the most appropriate initial action. The main concern is her addiction. She's worried she's becoming addicted but has no history of substance use disorder. She's a moderate user and is drinking alcohol.

So the options B and D are about managing her pain. But the question is about her initial action, not about managing her pain. So perhaps the initial action is to address her concerns about addiction.

Option G says to reassure her chance of addiction is minuscule. That's a good first step because she's a patient, so she might be worried. Without knowing, she's more worried about her well-being than her addiction.

Alternatively, J suggests encouraging her to endure pain without medication. That's a positive approach, but maybe not the initial step. The initial step would likely be addressing her concerns about addiction.

So between G and J. The question is about the initial action, making G the correct answer. So the first thing the physician would do is reassure her about her concerning belief.

The correct answer is G: Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule.
