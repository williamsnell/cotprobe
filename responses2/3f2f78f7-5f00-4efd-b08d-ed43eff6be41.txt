Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: DNAase specifically targets bacterial DNA, not viral DNA.
B: The virus doesn't contain any genetic material.
C: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.
D: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor, protecting its DNA.
E: The virus contains both DNA and RNA.
F: The virus uses a DNAase-resistant polymerase for replication.
G: The virus has an outer shell that prevents DNAase from entering.
H: The virus contains a special type of DNA that is resistant to DNAase.
I: The virus contains DNA, but DNAase is only effective in bacterial cells.
J: The virus contains DNA, it is not affected by DNAase.

Okay, so I have this question about DNAase and how it affects bacterial cells versus RNA viruses. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through it.

The question says that DNAase is added to a bacterial cell, and the DNA is hydrolyzed, which makes the cell unable to make any more proteins and eventually dies. But when DNAase is added to RNA viruses, they can continue to produce new proteins. The question is asking why this happens.

I remember that DNAases are enzymes that break down DNA. They're usually found in bacteria because they can digest the DNA in the bacterial genome. But what about RNA viruses? RNA viruses have their own DNA, but it's usually a different structure, like their genome is RNA. So, if you add DNAase to a virus's DNA, which is RNA, it shouldn't be affected because DNAase only acts on DNAâ€”like bacterial DNA.

Looking at the options: 

Option C says the virus contains RNA, it's not affected by DNAase. That makes sense because DNAase specifically targets bacterial DNA. Since RNA viruses have their own DNA, adding DNAase wouldn't impact them. So, the virus's own DNA (which is RNA) would be unaffected, allowing it to produce proteins again. 

Other options: Option A says DNAase targets only bacterial DNA, so it's correct. Option B says viruses don't have DNA, which is wrong because all viruses have genetic material, but it's a different type. Option D suggests the virus encodes its own inhibitor, which is more like a defense mechanism, but the question says they continue producing proteins, so maybe the virus doesn't have the inhibitor. Option E: virus contains DNA, which is true, but why doesn't DNAase affect it? Because DNAase only acts on bacterial DNA. So E suggests the virus has DNA but isn't affected, which aligns with option C. 

Wait, option E says the virus contains DNA, but is that the case? Well, some viruses have DNA, others have RNA. But this question is about RNA viruses. So, option E is basically correct, but the reason is in option C. 

So, the correct answer should be C: The virus contains RNA, it's not affected by DNAase. Because DNAase only acts on bacterial DNA, which the virus doesn't have. So, when DNAase is added, the virus's RNA is safe, allowing them to make proteins.

DNAases are enzymes that break down DNA, and they are typically found in bacteria. RNA viruses, however, have their own DNA, which is typically RNA. When DNAase is added to a virus, since DNAase only targets bacterial DNA, the virus's own RNA is unaffected. This allows RNA viruses to continue producing new proteins, as their DNA (RNA) is not hydrolyzed by DNAase.

**Correct Answer:** C: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.
