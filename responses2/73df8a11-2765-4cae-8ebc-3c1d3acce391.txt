Okay, so I've got this question here about the school year length if they increase it by 5%. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The current number of days in a school year is 180. They're saying the school district is proposing a 5% increase. So I need to calculate 5% of 180 and then add that to the original 180 days to find out the new length.

Hmm, how do I calculate 5% of 180? I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by the number. So 5% is the same as 0.05. So 0.05 times 180. Let me do that math: 180 * 0.05 equals... 9. Oh, right, because 10% of 180 is 18, so 5% is half of that, which is 9.

Okay, so the increase is 9 days. Now I add that to the original 180 days. 180 plus 9 is 189. So the new school year would be 189 days long.

Looking at the options, option G is 189 days. So the answer should be G.

The school year would be 189 days long after a 5% increase.
