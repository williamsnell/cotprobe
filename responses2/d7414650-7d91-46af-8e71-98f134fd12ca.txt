Okay, so I've got this question about bitmap graphics. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is NOT a property of bitmap graphics. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that bitmap graphics use a grid of pixels to create images. Each pixel is a tiny square, and they're arranged in rows and columns. So, the basic structure is a grid. Now, what properties do they have?

Option A: They can support millions of colors. Wait, bitmap doesn't use color channels like RGB. Instead, each pixel has a color from a predefined palette. So, I don't think bitmap can have millions of colors. That's probably not a property.

Option B: Realistic lighting and shading can be done. Oh right, bitmap can use techniques like pixel-based shading, which allows for realistic lighting. So this is a property.

Option C: Bitmaps can be made transparent. Oh, I'm pretty sure that's true. There's a technique called dithering or maybe using a separate layer, but in bitmap graphics, you can make layers transparent. So C is a property.

Option D: Fast hardware exists to move blocks of pixels efficiently. Yes, because bitmap graphics are processed pixel by pixel, and hardware can handle moving entire blocks quickly. So D is a property.

Option E: Bitmap graphics can be created in multiple layers. Definitely true. You can have different layers, each with their own color channels, so E is a property.

Option F: All line segments can be displayed as straight. Wait, no. In bitmap graphics, lines are made up of individual pixels, so when they render lines, they're typically made by connecting adjacent pixels. But if you have a line that spans multiple pixels, it's actually a series of straight lines, but each pixel is a point. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing vector graphics and bitmap. In bitmap, a line is a set of directly connected pixels, so it's just a straight line. So option F is correct. Alternatively, maybe F is a property, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. Bitmaps are made up of pixel data, so lines are made of individual pixels, so the line is a series of straight pixels, making the line appear straight. So F might be a property.

Option G: Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures. Wait, does bitmap handle textures? Textures are usually applied to images, not directly to polygons. So when you fill a polygon with a texture, you have to map the texture onto the polygon's surface. Bitmaps can't handle textures because they're pixel-based. So G is not a property of bitmap graphics; it's a feature of other graphics methods like image-based rendering.

Wait, let me re-examine each option. The question is asking which is NOT a property of bitmap graphics. So the wrong property would be option G.

Wait, option B is realistic lighting and shading possible, which I know bitmap can handle, so B is a property. Option G says polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures. But bitmap doesn't have textures, only pixels. So G is not a property of bitmap graphics. So the incorrect property is option G.

Wait, what about option F? I'm a bit confused. In bitmap graphics, when you draw a line, it's just a series of pixels. So the line is straight. For example, a line from (0,0) to (2,2) would be made of three pixels: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So each line is made of straight pixels, so F is correct. So F is a property.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT a property. So the incorrect statement is option G, because bitmap graphics don't handle textures. So the correct answer is G: it's the property that's not a property of bitmap graphics.

The question asks which option is NOT a property of bitmap graphics. Bitmaps use a grid of pixels and do not inherently support textures. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Bitmaps cannot support millions of colors because they rely on a predefined palette.
- **Option B**: Correct. Bitmaps can handle realistic lighting and shading.
- **Option C**: Correct. Bitmaps can be made transparent using techniques like dithering or layering.
- **Option D**: Correct. Fast hardware exists for efficient pixel manipulation.
- **Option E**: Correct. Bitmaps can be created with multiple layers.
- **Option F**: Correct. Bitmaps can display line segments as straight, though they are made of individual pixels.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Bitmaps do not support textures; they handle pixels only.

The correct answer is **G** because bitmap graphics do not support textures. 

Answer: G
