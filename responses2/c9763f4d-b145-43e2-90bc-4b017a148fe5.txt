The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An employer and employee had an employment contract that contained an "at will" provision allowing either party to terminate the employment upon reasonable notice. One year later, the employer had the employee sign a covenant not to compete for a two-year period after termination. Two years later, the employee quit and went to work for a competitor company. The prior employer sued, asking for a preliminary injunction to enforce the covenant. The employee argued that the covenant was invalid because no consideration passed to her  she could be fired at any time and did not receive anything for signing. The employer argued that it provided her with continued employment when it did not have to do so. Does the employer have a legal right to enforce the covenant?

Options:

A: No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.
B: No, because the employee didn't receive additional compensation for the covenant.
C: Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration.
D: Yes, because the covenant was signed voluntarily by the employee.
E: No, because the "at will" provision in the initial contract negates the enforceability of the covenant.
F: Yes, because the employer has a right to protect its business interests.
G: Yes, because the courts never question the adequacy of consideration in an agreement.
H: Yes, because modification of an existing contract does not require consideration.
I: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original employment contract.
J: No, because the covenant is unreasonable and therefore unenforceable.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this employment law question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a contract with an "at will" provision. That term I remember refers to a contract that can be terminated at any time by either party reasonably. So, the employer and employee signed a contract that allows one to terminate at any time if the other is reasonable. 

One year later, the employer signs a covenant not to compete for two years after termination. Wait, so the covenant is about not competing, meaning the employee can't work for the employer the next two years. But the problem is that the employer's promise to enforce it as a covenant is what's being sued. The employee argues that the covenant wasn't given because she didn't receive any additional compensation. 

The question is whether the employer can enforce this covenant. The options are A to J. The options include things like inadequate consideration, no consideration, etc.

I think about the "at will" clause. This clause means the agreement can be terminated at any time by either party. So, it's not a binding contract if one party breaches it. But here, the problem is the employer is trying to enforce the covenant as a separate contract. 

So, the issue is whether the covenant is enforceable. In contract law, the parties are usually bound by the contract they signed unless the contract is unenforceable. But here, the "at will" clause makes the original contract unenforceable. So, the employer's initial contract is invalid, meaning the covenant isn't part of a valid agreement.

Wait, but the employer is suing because it tried to enforce the covenant. If the contract itself is invalid, then any promises made under it would be unenforceable. So, for example, the employer would have no obligation to enforce the covenant because the contract wasn't valid. 

But wait, the employer's own promise to enforce the covenant as a separate contract might not matter if the original contract is unenforceable. Because the original contract's unenforceability negates the entire promise. 

So, the employer's own promise to enforce the covenant would be ineffective because the contract itself isn't valid. So, the employer can't enforce it. 

Looking at the options, option E says "No, because the 'at will' provision negates the enforceability of the covenant." That makes sense because if the contract is unenforceable due to the "at will" clause, then any promises made under it are also unenforceable.

Wait, but option J says "No, because the covenant is unreasonable and therefore unenforceable." But I don't think the issue here is if the covenant is unreasonable. The main issue is the original contract's enforceability. The "at will" makes the contract unenforceable, which means the covenant is invalid. So E is the correct answer.

The employer cannot enforce the covenant because the initial employment contract contains an "at will" provision, making it unenforceable. This means the covenant, which is a promise to enforce the contract, is also unenforceable as the contract itself is invalid. The "at will" clause negates the enforceability of the contract. 

Answer: E
