Question:

Owner has a property in fee simple absolute. He executes a deed to Friend with the words "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Under common law principles the conveyance to the heirs is not effective. Thus, the deed would result in a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to Owner. That result is due to what common law doctrine?

Options:

A: The doctrine of eminent domain
B: The rule of survivorship
C: The rule of destructibility of contingent remainders
D: The rule in Shelly's case
E: The doctrine of escheat
F: The doctrine of concurrent ownership
G: The doctrine of worthier title
H: The rule of lapse
I: The rule against perpetuities
J: The doctrine of adverse possession

Okay, so I've got this property law question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says the owner has a property in fee simple absolute. He deeds it to a friend with the words "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Normally, that would give the friend a life estate and the owner a reversion. But the problem states that under common law, the deed doesn't work because the reversion isn't effective. So the result is a life estate to the friend with a reversion back to the owner.

The question is asking about the common law doctrine that caused this outcome. The options are A to J.

First, let me recap what I know about common law property rules. One of the key ideas is the rule of survivorship, which says that once a person has owned property for life, they can't sell it anymore. But here, the friend is selling the property, so I guess survivorship is not directly involved.

Another concept is the rule of reversion, which I think says that if the grant gives the grantor a life estate and the grantee a reversion, the reversion can't be effective. But wait, in this case, the reversion is back to the owner, so is that the same as a reversion? Or is it the other way around?

Oh, wait. If the grant is "To Friend for life and then to the heir of Owner," that's a common law conveyance. In common law, if you give a life estate and then a reversion, the reversion is to the grantor. But in this scenario, the reversion goes back to the owner. So, perhaps the grant isn't being made as a reversion because of some other rule.

Wait, but the question states that the reversion is not effective. So the deed doesn't work, meaning the reversion is denied. So the friend ends up with a life estate and the owner gets the reversion.

But how does that happen under common law? Let me think about the possible options.

Option B is the rule of survivorship, which I don't think applies here. Option C is the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. Hmm, the contingent remainder is an estate held until the death of a particular person. If the grant is to give a life estate to Friend and the remainder to the owner, that sounds like the owner has a contingent remainder. But in the question, the reversion is back to the owner, not the owner to the remainder. Wait, noâ€” in this case, the grant is "for life and then to the heirs of Owner." So the friend gets the life estate, and the owner gets the remainder. So the rule of survivorship says that once the life estate passes, the owner can't sell. But here, the reversion is back to the owner, which implies that the owner cannot sell. So perhaps the rule about the reversion not being effective under common law applies.

Wait, another angle: the rule of reversion says that if the grantor receives a life estate and the grantee a reversion, the reversion is invalid. But in this case, the reversion is to the owner, not the grantee. So perhaps the court doesn't have to invalidate the reversion because the grantee is the owner. So under common law, would that mean the reversion doesn't work? So the deed becomes a life estate to the grantee and a reversion (which is to the owner in this case) back to the owner. But I thought the reversion is to the grantee, not the owner. So maybe under common law, a reversion is only effective to the grantee, not to the owner. So in this case, the grantee gets the life estate, and the owner gets the reversion. But the question says the reversion is back to the owner. That's confusing. Maybe I need to think about how the words are phrased.

Wait, the deed says "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." So the grantee is Friend. So the reversion is to the grantee. But the question states that the reversion is back to the owner. That doesn't make sense. Unless I'm misinterpreting the words. Oh wait, perhaps it's "to the heirs of Owner" as in the person's heirs. So the friend gets the life estate, and the heirs of the owner (the owner's descendants) get the reversion. But the question says the reversion is back to the owner. So perhaps that's not the correct way to interpret it. Hmm, maybe the reversion is to the owner's heirs. So the owner can't sell, so the friend gets life and the owner gets the reversion. So that would be a life estate to Friend and a reversion (to Owner's heirs) back to Owner.

Wait, but the question says that the reversion is back to the owner. So that suggests that the owner can't sell. Which would happen if the reversion is to the owner. But under common law, a reversion is to the grantee. So maybe the rule of reversion not being effective could apply here. But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the options again.

Option B is the rule of survivorship, which I don't think applies here because the deed is dealing with a reversion, not a survivorship.

Option C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. Contingent remainders are to be given to the holder of a life estate. If the grantee receives a life estate and the remainder, then the remainder is to the grantee. So in this case, the grantee gets the life estate, and the owner gets the remainder. But here, the reversion is to the owner's heirs, which is a different scenario.

Wait, the question says: the deed is "For life and then to the heirs of Owner." So the grantee is Friend. So the reversion is to Friend's heirs. But the question states that the reversion is back to the owner, which doesn't make sense unless the reversion is to the owner's heirs. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, but given that, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the rule is about the rule against reversion, but I'm not sure.

Option H is the doctrine of lapse. lapse is when a life estate cannot be used for a certain period. But in this case, the reversion is back to the owner, so lapse might not be relevant.

Option F is the doctrine of concurrent ownership. Concurrent ownership is when the grantor and the grantee both own the property at the same time. Not sure how that would come into play here.

Option D is the rule in Shelly's case. Shelly's case is about a reversion not being effective because the grantee's estate cannot pass. But I'm not familiar with the specifics.

Wait, perhaps the rule that applies here is the rule of reversion not being effective, but I'm not certain. Wait, the answer options are the common law doctrine, so perhaps the applicable doctrine is the rule of reversion not being effective, but I'm not sure which option that is.

The options are B to J, so let's see:

Option B: survivorship. Not applicable.

Option C: rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. I'm not sure.

Option H: lapse. Not relevant.

Wait, another thought: The rule of reversion is that a grantee can't transfer a life estate. But in this case, the grantee (Friend) is getting a life estate, and the owner (the owner's heirs) is getting the reversion. So that's a life estate to Friend and a reversion to the owner's heirs, which is the same as Friend having a life estate and being subject to the owner's heirs.

But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, which I think is a misstatement. Or perhaps it's a typo, but assuming that's the case, the reversion is to the owner's heirs. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think again about the possible answer.

If the reversion is back to the owner, then the owner can't sell the property. So the deed becomes a life estate to Friend and the owner's heirs get the reversion.

Wait, but under common law, the rule that would prevent the reversion is the rule of reversion not being effective. Or perhaps the rule of reversion is to give a life estate to the grantee, so the grantee's estate does not give anything to the grantee's heirs beyond what's already there.

Wait, perhaps the rule is the rule of reversion, which says that the grantee cannot transfer a life estate. But in this case, the grantee is getting a life estate, so the reversion is back to the owner. So that's the rule of reversion not being effective. But the question asks which common law doctrine caused the reversion to not be effective.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule of the life estate is that the grantee can't have a reversion, but the grantee is getting a life estate, so the reversion isn't effective. But this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule of the rule is that a life estate automatically gives the grantee a reversion. So if the grantee is getting a life estate, the reversion is automatically given. But the question says that the reversion is back to the owner, so that can't be.

Wait, the question's setup is that the reversion is back to the owner. So perhaps the reversion is not effective. But under common law, I thought that the grantee would get a life estate and the reversion would go to the owner. So the reversion is not effective. Therefore, the deed becomes a life estate to the grantee (Friend) and the owner gets the reversion.

But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, meaning that Friend doesn't have a life estate and the owner gets the reversion. So perhaps the rule is that the grantee's life estate automatically gives the owner the reversion. But that's not correct under common law.

Wait, perhaps the rule is the rule of the life estate, which says that once a life estate passes, the grantee can't have anything, including a reversion. But that doesn't make sense because the grantee is getting a life estate.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option H is the doctrine of lapse, which is about a life estate not lasting beyond a certain period. Not directly related.

Option C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. Wait, the contingent remainder refers to an estate that is to be given to the holder of a life estate. So if the grantee gets a life estate, then the person holding it (the owner of the property) is the one who gets the remainder. So, under common law, is a remainder automatically given to the owner? Yes. So in this case, the grantee (Friend) gets a life estate, and the owner gets the remainder.

But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, which would suggest that the owner would get the remainder, not the grantee. But in the question, it says the reversion is back to the owner. So perhaps the statement in the question is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reversion is to the owner's heirs. So the grantee (Friend) gets a life estate, and the owner's heirs get the reversion. But that's a different scenario than the question says, which says the reversion is back to the owner.

Wait, maybe the answer is option C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. Because if the grantee (Friend) is the life estate holder, then the remaining estate (the remainder) goes to the owner. So, the rule is that contingent remainders are automatically given to the holder of the life estate.

But the question's wording is a bit confusing, so perhaps the reversion is not effective. Wait, but under common law, the reversion is to the grantee (Friend). So the reversion would not be effective if the grantee can't pass it. But in this case, the grantee is getting a life estate, so the reversion is automatically given to the owner. So the reversion is not effective. So the deed becomes a life estate to Friend and a remainder to the owner.

But the question says that the reversion is back to the owner, which would mean that Friend doesn't have a life estate. So perhaps the rule is that the grantee's estate is not subject to the owner's heirs. Or, the rule is that the grantee's life estate automatically gives the owner the reversion.

Wait, another angle: the rule of reversion says that if you give a life estate, the reversion is automatically to the grantee's heirs. So if the grantee is someone else, the reversion is to their heirs. So in this case, the grantee is Friend, so the reversion is to Friend's heirs, and the owner gets the remainder. But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, which would suggest that the owner gets the remainder, not to the heirs.

So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, but assuming it's about the reversion going back to the owner, the underlying reason is the rule that the grantee's life estate takes away the reversion. But that's not a common law doctrine. The common law doctrine here would be the rule that the grantee's estate does not pass any remainder. But I'm not sure if that's an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is the rule of survivorship. I don't think that's relevant here.

Option H is the doctrine of lapse. Not relevant.

Option C is the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. Let me think about that. If the grantee is the life estate holder, then the owner is the one who holds the contingent remainder. So the remainder is automatically given to the owner. So, in this case, the deed becomes a life estate to the grantee and a remainder to the owner. But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, which would imply that the owner has the remainder.

Wait, perhaps under common law, the grantee's life estate automatically gives the owner the remainder. So the reversion is not effective because the grantee can't pass it. So the reversion goes to the owner's heirs, but in the question, the reversion is back to the owner. So perhaps the rule is that the grantee's life estate takes away the reversion.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the question's phrasing is misleading. Maybe the correct answer is the rule of reversion not being effective, but the options don't have that.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the deed's result. The deed says the grantee (Friend) gets a life estate, and the owner gets the remainder. But the question says the reversion is back to the owner. That's confusing. So perhaps the correct answer is that the rule of the life estate is that it automatically gives the owner the remainder. So the reversion is not effective because the grantee can't pass it.

But I'm looking for the common law doctrine that causes this. The rule that would prevent the grantee from passing the reversion is the rule of the life estate.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer should be C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders. Because the grantee (Friend) is the life estate holder. So the owner (the property owner) is the one who holds the contingent remainder. So under common law, the remainder is automatically given to the holder of the life estate. So in this case, Friend is the life estate holder, so the owner gets the remainder. But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, which doesn't make sense unless the reversion is to the owner's heirs.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect in stating the reversion is back to the owner, but I have to go by the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot pass a reversion. So the grantee's estate (Friend) has a reversion, but in this case, the grantee gets a life estate, which would automatically take away the reversion. So the reversion isn't effective, and the owner gets the remainder. But again, the question says the reversion is back to the owner, which would suggest the owner gets the remainder, not the grantee's heirs.

Wait, perhaps the rule is the rule of the life estate. Under that rule, the grantee (Friend) has a life estate, and the owner gets the remainder. So the reversion isn't effective because the grantee can't pass it. So the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot pass a reversion, so the reversion isn't effective. The reversion would go to the owner's heirs.

But the question says the reversion is back to the owner. That's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the answer is the rule of the life estate, but I'm not seeing that option.

Wait, looking at the options again, the correct answer is the rule that prevents the reversion from being effective. The rule of destrustibility of contingent remainders would prevent the grantee from passing the remainder. So the owner (the person holding the remainder) can't pass it to someone else.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the rule of the life estate, but the options don't have that. Let me look back. The options are:

A: Emission

B: Survivorship

C: Destructibility of Contingent Remainders

D: Rule in Shelly's case

E: Lapse

F: Concurrent ownership

G: Worthier title

H: Adverse possession

I: Echeat

J: Adverse possession.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the rule of the rule of the reversion not being effective, but the options don't include that. Or perhaps the rule is the rule of the life estate, which is option B, but it's not in the options.

Wait, the options in the question are A to J, so perhaps I should think another way. The rule that would prevent the reversion from being effective is the rule that a life estate automatically gives the owner the remainder.

Wait, no, that's not the correct rule. The correct rule is the rule of the life estate, which says that the grantee cannot transfer a life estate. Wait, but in this case, the grantee is getting a life estate, which implies that the reversion is not effective.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that the grantee's estate can't pass a reversion, so the reversion isn't effective. But I don't know the option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is the rule of the life estate, which says that the grantee holds a life estate, and thus can't have a reversion. So the reversion isn't effective, and the owner gets the remainder.

But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, which would imply that the owner gets the remainder, not the grantee's heirs.

Wait, perhaps the rule is the rule of the life estate, which says that the grantee can't have a reversion. So the deed becomes a life estate to the grantee and the owner gets the remainder. So the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot pass a reversion, so the reversion is not effective. But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, so perhaps the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot pass a reversion, but that's not the same as the rule of the life estate.

Wait, perhaps the rule is the rule of the life estate, which says that the grantee can't transfer a life estate. But in this case, the grantee does get a life estate, so the reversion is not effective. So the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot transfer a reversion, but that's not a common law doctrine.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the rule of the life estate, which is not an option. So I have to think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is the rule against reversion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the correct answer is likely option C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders.

Because in the case where the grantee is the life estate holder, the owner (the person holding the remainder) is the one who gets the remainder. So, the rule is that the remainder is automatically given to the holder of the life estate.

So in this case, the grantee (Friend) has a life estate, so the owner (the person who owns the property) gets the remainder.

But the question says the reversion is back to the owner. So perhaps the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot pass a reversion, so the reversion is not effective. So the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot pass a reversion.

Wait, but that's not the rule of the life estate.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is the rule of the life estate, which says that the grantee cannot transfer a life estate. But in this case, the grantee does have a life estate, so the reversion is effective.

But the question says the reversion is back to the owner, so perhaps the rule is that the grantee's estate cannot pass a reversion, so the reversion is not effective. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: when the grantee is the life estate holder, the remainder is automatically given to the owner, the person holding the property. So the rule is that the grantee's life estate takes away the reversion. But which option is that?

I think the correct answer is option C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders.

Because if the grantee is the life estate holder, the owner (the one holding the remainder) is the one who gets the remainder. So the rule is that the remainder is automatically given to the holder of the life estate.

So, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The correct answer is **C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders**. 

Here's the reasoning:

- The deed grants a life estate to Friend and a remainder to the owner's heirs. 
- However, under common law, a life estate automatically gives the remainder to the holder of the life estate. 
- Since Friend is the life estate holder, the owner's heirs automatically receive the remainder. 
- Therefore, the reversion (which would have been to the owner's heirs) is automatically given to the owner, making the reversion ineffective. 

Thus, the rule that prevents the reversion from being effective is the rule of the life estate, which is not explicitly listed among the options. However, the closest matching option is **C: the rule of destructibility of contingent remainders**, which correctly identifies the rule preventing the reversion from being effective.

ANSWER: C
