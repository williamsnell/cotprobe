Alright, let's tackle this question about cooperative federalism. Okay, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that federalism is a system where power is divided between a central government and several regional governments, like states. But what does cooperative federalism specifically mean? I think cooperative might imply that both the federal and state levels are working together, rather than competition.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the federal and state governments are working against each other. That sounds like opposition, not cooperation. So probably not A.

Option B states that state and federal governments work on the same issue. That makes sense because cooperative federalism would involve both levels addressing the same problems together.

Option C claims states have complete authority. No, that's the opposite of cooperative. States usually delegate some authority to the federal government, not have all.

Option D says the federal government imposes policies without their consent. That's more like a central authority, not cooperative. It's more like an absolute power thing.

Option E: State governments make decisions without federal involvement. That's still part of federalism, but it's more about state autonomy. So E might be a part, but it's not the best description of cooperative federalism.

Option F: Governments working with businesses. Hmm, not directly related. Cooperative federalism is more about policies and policies, not business involvement.

Option G: Federal control over all policy areas. That's too broad, and I think that's more like a federal system where the federal government has broad authority, not the state.

Option H: Federal and state working independently on different issues. That's more like a_se separate federalism, where each level handles its own issues. But cooperative would mean working together, not separately.

Option I: Executive and legislative branches working together on legislation. That sounds like a form of cooperative federalism, where they collaborate to pass laws.

Option J: Federal granting power to states. That's more like federalism in a sense, but it's not about cooperation. It's more about federal overreach.

Putting it all together, I think the best answer is B and I. But wait, the question is asking for the best characterization. Cooperative federalism is when the federal government and states work together on issues, not against each other. So it's about collaboration, not competition. So B seems correct. Also, option H says they work independently, which is different. So B is the right choice.
