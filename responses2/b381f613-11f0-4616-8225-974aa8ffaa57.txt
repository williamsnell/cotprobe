Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question says that a chemist has a piece of foil that's about 5 × 10^4 atoms thick. An alpha particle needs to come within 10^-12 cm of a nucleus to be deflected. We're supposed to find the probability of this happening, assuming the nuclei aren't directly behind each other. The area of one atom is given as 4 × 10^-16 cm².

Hmm, I remember something about the concept of cross-sections in nuclear physics. Oh right, the probability of an alpha particle being deflected is related to the cross-sectional area and the number of targets (nuclei) the particle passes through.

Wait, the formula for the probability of deflection is P = (number of atoms) × (area per atom) × (targeting factor). But wait, no—because each atom has a certain area, and the path of the alpha particle would cross through many of these atoms. Oh, right! The formula for the probability is P = (N × A) / (π r²), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, another way I've heard it is the "targeting factor." The number of atoms N, the area per nucleus A, and the target thickness t. Maybe the probability is (N × A) divided by the area of a circle with radius r, but wait, the formula I'm recalling is P = (N × A)/ (π R²), where R is the radius of the deflection region. But in this case, the target thickness is given, so maybe it's simpler.

Wait, another approach: the probability is the product of the number of atoms the alpha particle passes through and the cross-sectional area per atom. Oh! Because each atom has an area, and the probability of hitting a particular atom is the area per atom divided by the area the alpha particle would have to pass through to hit it. But maybe I should think in terms of the foil's area.

Wait, wait, another formula I remember is P = (Area of the foil) / (Area of the collision cross-section). But wait, the foil's cross-sectional area is t × W, but here W might be 1 cm², but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (number of atoms in the path) × (targeting area per atom). Because each atom has a certain area, and the probability of hitting any given atom is the area of the atom divided by the area of the circle the alpha particle would pass through. But since the alpha is moving through a foil, the path is a cylinder, and the area of the foil's thickness is t × something.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the probability is (number of atoms in the path) × (area per atom) divided by the area of a circle with radius r, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the target's cross-sectional area.

Wait, perhaps the problem simplifies because the target is a foil. The foil has a thickness t (the 5e4 atoms), and each atom has an area A. So the total area of the foil is t × A.

Wait, but the target area for the alpha particle's path would be the area of the path it takes through the foil. Oh, that's where it gets tricky. The alpha particle's path is a cylinder with a diameter equal to the diameter of the nucleus it's approaching. Wait, but the nuclei are being deflected if the alpha comes within 10^-12 cm of any nucleus. So the alpha particle's path would be such that each nucleus in the foil has a chance of being within this distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the effective area the alpha particle's path would have to pass through to have a chance of hitting any nucleus. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach. The problem says the nuclei are not directly behind each other, so it's a matter of how many nuclei the alpha's path would encounter. Each nucleus has an area A, and the path length is the thickness (t). But the cross-sectional area for a single nucleus is A, and the area the alpha would have to pass through is t × A. Because each nucleus is a flat area (like a disk) with area A, and the path is straight through, so the cross-section for the alpha to hit any nucleus is t × A.

But wait, the probability P is the number of nuclei (N) times the area per nucleus (A) divided by the area where the alpha could pass through to hit any nucleus. Wait, but the area where the alpha could hit is a circle with radius r, where r is the distance such that the hitting occurs within 10^-12 cm. Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the cross-section area for a nucleus is πr², and the target area the alpha particle passes through is t × A, where A is the area of one nucleus. So the probability P would be (number of atoms N) × (A) / (π r²), where r is the radius of the deflection area.

But wait, the question says to assume the area of one atom is 4e-16 cm². So the radius r would be sqrt( (4e-16) / π ). Let me calculate that.

Wait, wait, the cross-section area per nucleus is π r² = A. So r = sqrt(A/π). The problem gives A as 4e-16 cm², so r = sqrt(4e-16 / pi) cm.

Calculating that: sqrt(4e-16) is 2e-8 cm, and sqrt(pi) is about 1.772, so r is approximately 2e-8 / 1.772 ≈ 1.11e-8 cm.

Now, the area where the alpha could pass through to hit a nucleus is a circle with radius r. So the area is π r² = π * (1.11e-8)^2 ≈ π * 1.23e-16 ≈ 3.87e-16 cm².

Wait, wait, but each nucleus has an area A of 4e-16 cm². So for each nucleus, the probability of the alpha hitting it is (cross-sectional area)/(nucleus area) = (pi r²) / A. Which is, for each nucleus, (pi (A/(pi))) ) / A = (A) / A = 1. Wait, that can't be right. Because each nucleus has cross-section pi r², which is (pi (A/(pi))) ) = A. So each nucleus's cross-section is equal to its own area. So the probability for each nucleus to be hit is 1, which doesn't make sense. That can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me reevaluate. The cross-section area for a nucleus is pi r². The area of the nucleus itself is A = pi r². So the cross-section area is equal to the nucleus area. Which would mean that the probability of hitting a nucleus is 1, which can't be right. That doesn't make sense because the foil can't have 100% chance.

Ah, wait, I think I see the mistake. The cross-section area for a nucleus is pi r², but the nucleus itself has a cross-sectional area. But wait, for each nucleus, the cross-section is pi r². So the probability of the alpha particle hitting a particular nucleus is (pi r²) / (cross-sectional area). Wait, but the cross-sectional area is the area of the nucleus, which is pi r². So the probability would be (pi r²) / (pi r²) = 1. Which again is impossible because the foil is made of multiple nuclei.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The cross-section is the area the alpha has to pass through to hit a nucleus. So if the alpha's path is a cylinder of thickness t and radius R, then the area of the cylinder is 2 * pi * R * t. But how does this relate to the nuclei?

No, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of atoms in the path and the probability for each.

The number of atoms N is 5e4. Each atom has area A = 4e-16 cm². The target thickness is t =5e4 atoms thick.

Wait, assuming the foil is a thin layer, but I'm not sure how the thickness relates to the cross-sectional area. Alternatively, the target's cross-section is t (thickness) multiplied by the area per atom. So the area the alpha has to pass through is t × A.

Wait, the area of the path the alpha takes is t times some other area? Or perhaps the area is t × (area per atom). Because the foil is a sheet, the area is t × W, but if W is 1 cm², the area is t × 1 cm².

So the area for the alpha's path is t × A, where t is the thickness (5e4 atoms thick) and A is the area per atom (4e-16 cm²). So the total area is 5e4 * 4e-16 = 2e-11 cm².

Now, the area the alpha must pass through to hit a nucleus is a circle of radius r, where r is the radius of the region where the alpha could come within 10^-12 cm of a nucleus. Wait, but the problem gives the area of one atom as 4e-16 cm². So the radius for each nucleus would be sqrt(A/(pi)) = sqrt(4e-16 / pi) ≈ 1.13e-8 cm.

The cross-sectional area for each nucleus is pi r² = A = 4e-16 cm². So the probability for each nucleus is (cross-sectional area) / (nucleus area) )= 4e-16 / 4e-16 =1. That can't be right. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the probability of the alpha hitting any nucleus in the entire area, but the probability of it passing through a single nucleus. Because the option given is 1 in X, which is the probability of being deflected, not hitting any nucleus.

Ah, that's probably it. So perhaps the question is about the probability that the alpha, passing through the foil, comes within a certain distance of any nucleus. So the probability is the ratio of the area of the region within 10^-12 cm of any nucleus to the total area of the foil.

Alternatively, the probability is the number of nuclei times the area per nucleus (the area around each nucleus within the deflection radius), all divided by the total area of the foil.

Wait, let me model it. The foil's area is t × W, where t =5e4 atoms thick and W is 1 cm² (since it's a piece of foil, its cross-sectional area is 1 cm²). So the area of the foil is 5e4 * 4e-16 cm² (since each atom has area 4e-16 cm²). Let me compute that: 5e4 *4e-16 = 2e-11 cm².

Now, the area of the region within 10^-12 cm of a nucleus. Each nucleus has a circular area with radius 10^-12 cm. So the area of a single such region is π (1e-12)^2 = π *1e-24 cm².

The number of nuclei in the foil is N =5e4. So the total area around nuclei is 5e4 * π *1e-24 = 5e4 * pi * 1e-24 ≈ 1.57e-19 cm².

Wait, that's the area within 10^-12 cm of any nucleus. Now, the total area of the foil is 2e-11 cm². So the probability P is (1.57e-19) / (2e-11) ≈ (1.57e-19) / (2e-11 ) = 7.85e-9. So the probability is about 7.85e-9, which is about 1 in 1.25e8. But looking at the options, the closest is 1 in 6e3 (option J) or 1 in 1e4 (option C, etc.).

Wait, but wait a second. I thought the area per nucleus is 4e-16 cm². Oh, wait, earlier I thought the area per nucleus is 4e-16, but that's the area of the atom. Oh, no, the problem says the area of one atom is 4e-16 cm². So the cross-section for each nucleus is 4e-16 cm². Not the area around it. So perhaps I should compute the area of the region within 10^-12 cm of any nucleus.

Wait, no. The area of the region where the alpha is deflected is a circle around each nucleus with radius 1e-12 cm. So each such area is π r² = π (1e-12)^2 = ~3.14e-24 cm². Multiply by the number of nuclei, which is 5e4. So 5e4 * 3.14e-24 = 1.57e-19 cm². Divide that by the area of the foil: 2e-11 cm².

So probability is 1.57e-19 / 2e-11 ≈ 7.85e-9. Which is 1 in 1.25e8, but none of the options match that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the area of the region within 10^-12 cm of any nucleus isn't simply N * pi * (1e-12)^2. Because the nuclei are spaced closely, the regions might overlap. So perhaps the assumption that the nuclei are spaced far apart and so we can treat the regions as non-overlapping is invalid. But the question states that the nuclei are not directly behind each other, implying that the distance between nuclei is larger than 2 * 1e-12 cm, so the regions don't overlap. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but then the probability is 7.85e-9, which is about 1 in 1.25e8. But the options don't have that. The closest options are 1 in 1250 (F), which is 1e-3, while our P is about 8e-9, which is 1 in 1.25e8. Wait, that's 1 in 125,000,000. Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 1 in 1250, which is 1e-3, or option E: 1 in 5e3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait another approach: perhaps the target is a flat sheet of metal, so the cross-sectional area is the thickness times the area per nucleus? Or maybe the area of the foil is the thickness multiplied by the cross-sectional area of an atom. Wait, maybe I should think of the foil as a flat sheet with thickness t and cross-sectional area 1 cm². The area of the foil is 1 cm² multiplied by t. But the cross-section where the alpha has to pass through is a circle with radius equal to the deflection radius. So the area is pi r² = pi (1e-12)^2 = 3.14e-24 cm².

Number of nuclei in the foil is N = 5e4, so the total area around nuclei is 5e4 * 3.14e-24 = 1.57e-19 cm².

Wait, but the area of the foil is 1 cm² * t. Wait, no: the foil's area is 5e4 atoms thick, each with cross-section 4e-16 cm². So the area is 5e4 * 4e-16 = 2e-11 cm². So the probability is (1.57e-19) / (2e-11) = 7.85e-9. So that's 1 in 1.25e8. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the number of atoms along the path, then multiplied by the area per atom. Let me try that. The number of atoms in the path (the foil's thickness) is N =5e4. Each atom has an area of A=4e-16 cm². So the total area the alpha passes through is N * A =5e4 *4e-16=2e-11 cm².

The area where the alpha comes within 1e-12 cm of any nucleus is a circle with radius 1e-12 cm. So area is pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm².

So the probability is (2e-11) / (3.14e-24) = approx 6.37e12. Which is about 1 in 1.57e-13. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but that can't be right, because probability can't be over 1. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Another approach: The probability that the alpha particle comes within 1e-12 cm of a nucleus is given by the product of the number of atoms in the path and the cross-sectional area per atom, divided by the area of the deflection circle.

Wait, the number of atoms in the path is N =5e4. Each atom has an area of A=4e-16 cm². But the cross-sectional area per atom is the area, so the effective area is N*A. But the problem is that the alpha particle must pass through a region where the nuclei are spaced. So the actual path is determined by the distance between nuclei, perhaps much larger than 1e-12 cm.

Wait, perhaps the probability is (number of atoms) * (targeting area per atom) ) / (deflection area). But wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to model it.

The probability P is given by (number of atoms) × (target area per atom) / (deflection area). Wait, but each nucleus has an area A, and the target path's area is t * ... Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the problem from another angle.

The problem gives that the nucleus area is 4e-16 cm². So the radius is sqrt(4e-16 / pi) ≈ 1.13e-8 cm. The deflection radius is 1e-12 cm.

The area within 1e-12 cm of any nucleus is a circle with radius 1e-12 cm. So area is pi (1e-12)^2 = 3.14e-24 cm².

The number of nuclei in the path is N =5e4. So the total area around nuclei is 5e4 * 3.14e-24 = 1.57e-19 cm².

The area of the foil is t × A, where A is the area of an atom. So t is 5e4 atoms thick, each with area 4e-16 cm². So area of the foil is 5e4 *4e-16 =2e-11 cm².

So the probability is (1.57e-19) / (2e-11) =7.85e-9. So, 1 in 1.25e8. But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of atoms in the path. No, the number of atoms is 5e4. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute (number of atoms) × (targeting area per atom) ) / (deflection area). Wait, that would be (5e4) × (4e-16) ) / (pi (1e-12)^2 ).

Wait, that would be 2e-11 / 3.14e-24 = approx 6.37e12. So 1 in 6e12. That's not among the options.

But wait, perhaps the area of the target is 5e4 * 4e-16 = 2e-11 cm². The deflection area is pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm². So probability is (2e-11) / (3.14e-24) )= approx 6.37e12. So 1 in 6e12. Not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the target as a flat sheet and compute the ratio of the area of the deflection region to the area of the target.

The target's area is t × A =5e4 ×4e-16=2e-11 cm².

The deflection area is a circle with radius 1e-12 cm. Area is pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm².

So probability is (3.14e-24) / (2e-11) )= 1.57e-13. That's way less than 1, so no, that can't be.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the question again.

The question is: A piece of foil is 5e4 atoms thick. Each atom has an area of 4e-16 cm². The alpha particle's deflection radius is 1e-12 cm. What's the probability that the alpha comes within this radius of any nucleus?

I think the correct approach is to compute the probability as (number of atoms) × (targeting area per atom) ) / (deflection area).

Wait, but that would be (5e4) × (4e-16) ) / (pi (1e-12)^2 )

That's 2e-11 / 3.14e-24 = approx 6.37e12. But that's way bigger than 1, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it more carefully.

(5e4) × (4e-16) = 2e-11 cm².

Deflection area = pi (1e-12)^2 = pi * 1e-24 cm² ≈3.14e-24 cm².

So the probability is (2e-11) / (3.14e-24) )= 6.37e12.

That's way more than 1, which can't be. So either this approach is wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the target is a cylindrical piece, but the calculation for the area is different. Alternatively, perhaps the area of the target is the cross-sectional area, which is t × (target area per atom). So the target's area is t × A, where A is the area of each atom.

So the area of the foil is 5e4 ×4e-16 =2e-11 cm².

The deflection area is a circle with radius 1e-12 cm, so area is pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm².

Probability is (3.14e-24) / (2e-11) )=1.57e-13. That's 1 in 6.37e12, which is about 1 in 6e12. But again, this isn't among the options.

Wait, but perhaps the diameter of the nucleus is 2A, which would be 8e-16 cm. So if the distance between nuclei is 8e-16 cm, the deflection radius (1e-12 cm) is much smaller than the distance between nuclei. So in this case, the deflection area would be calculated differently.

Wait, but then the nuclei are so far apart that the regions around them don't overlap. So the probability would be (number of nuclei) × (nucleus area) / (deflection area). But wait, no, because each nucleus has a nucleus area, but the deflection area is a circle.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability as (number of nuclei) × (deflection area) / (target area). But no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, I'm considering the foil as a flat sheet with thickness t. The target's area is t × (target area per atom). The deflection area is a circle with radius r. The probability is (deflection area) / (target area).

Wait, but the target area is t × A, where A is the area of each atom. So the target area is 5e4 ×4e-16 =2e-11 cm².

The deflection area is pi r² = pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm².

Probability is 3.14e-24 /2e-11 =1.57e-13. So 1 in 6.37e12.

But none of the options match that. The closest is option F: 1 in 1250 (1e-3), which is much larger than 1e-13. So perhaps the correct approach is not what I'm thinking.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the probability of the alpha hitting a nucleus, but the probability of the alpha coming within a certain radius of any nucleus. So the cross-sectional area where the alpha could come within 1e-12 cm of any nucleus is a circle of radius 1e-12 cm. The area is pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm². The target's area is the thickness of the foil multiplied by the cross-sectional area of an atom.

Wait, the thickness is 5e4 atoms thick, and each atom has area A =4e-16 cm². So the target area is 5e4 *4e-16 =2e-11 cm².

So the probability is 3.14e-24 /2e-11 =1.57e-13. So 1 in 6.37e12. Again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the target area. Let me think again. The target's area is the thickness t times the area per atom A. So t =5e4 atoms thick, each atom has A=4e-16 cm². So the target area is 5e4 *4e-16 =2e-11 cm².

The deflection area is a circle of radius 1e-12 cm, so area is pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm².

Probability is 3.14e-24 /2e-11 =1.57e-13. So 1 in 6.37e12.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another approach. The foil's area is t × t_target, where t_target is the cross-sectional area per atom. So t_target =4e-16 cm².

So target area is 5e4 *4e-16 =2e-11 cm².

The deflection area is a circle of radius 1e-12 cm, which is pi (1e-12)^2 =3.14e-24 cm².

Probability is deflection area / target area = (3.14e-24) / (2e-11) )=1.57e-13. So 1 in 6.37e12, which is 1 in ~6.37e12.

But the options are:

A: 1 in 7e10

B: 1 in 4e10

C: 1 in 1e10

D: 1 in 5e9

E: 1 in 1.7e8

F: 1 in 1.25e8

G: 1 in 1.5e7

H: 1 in 2e7

I: 1 in 4e6

J: 1 in 1.7e6

K: 1 in 2.5e5

L: 1 in 5e4

M: 1 in 1.25e4

N: 1 in 1.5e3

O: 1 in 2.5e2

P: 1 in 5e1

Q: 1 in 6e1

R: 1 in 1.2e2

S: 1 in 1.5e1

T: 1 in 2e0

U: 1 in 2.5e0

V: 1 in 5e0

W: 1 in 1e1

X: 1 in 2e1

Y: 1 in 5e1

Z: 1 in 1e2.

So the correct answer isn't among the options, which is a problem. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the target's area is the thickness multiplied by the cross-sectional area per atom. So target area t * (A) =5e4 *4e-16 =2e-11 cm².

Deflection area is pi*(1e-12)^2=3.14e-24 cm².

Probability is 3.14e-24 /2e-11=1.57e-13.

Which is 1 in 6.37e12, which is 1 in 6.37 trillion. That's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the target area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the target area is the cross-sectional area of the target, which is the thickness multiplied by the area per atom.

Wait, no, the target's area is the thickness (t) times the cross-sectional area per atom. So t is the length in cm, and the cross-sectional area per atom is A=4e-16 cm².

So target area is t*A =5e4 *4e-16=2e-11 cm².

Deflection area is pi * r^2 = pi*(1e-12)^2=3.14e-24 cm².

Probability is 3.14e-24 /2e-11 =1.57e-13.

Which is 1 in 6.37e12.

Hmm. None of the options match this. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of atoms that come within the deflection radius, and then divide by the number of atoms in the path.

So, each atom has an area A=4e-16 cm². The deflection radius is 1e-12 cm. The number of atoms in the path is N=5e4.

The area of the deflection region is a circle with radius r=1e-12 cm, area pi r²=pi*1e-24 cm².

The probability is (number of atoms in the path) × (deflection area per atom) ) / (target area per atom).

Wait, no. Alternatively, the probability is (number of atoms in the path) × (deflection area) ) / (target area).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (N) × (pi r²) / (t * A).

Wait, perhaps that's the formula. Let me try that.

N=5e4.

r=1e-12 cm.

A=4e-16 cm².

t is the thickness, which is 5e4 atoms thick. Each atom's area is 4e-16 cm², so t*A=5e4 *4e-16=2e-11 cm².

So P= (5e4) * (pi*(1e-12)^2) / (2e-11) )

= (5e4) * (3.14e-24) / (2e-11) )

= (1.57e-19) / (2e-11) )

= 7.85e-9.

So again, the probability is 1 in 1.25e8, which is 1 in 1.25e8.

Looking at the options, option F is 1 in 1.25e8. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I thought earlier that this approach was conflicting. But perhaps this is the correct approach.

Yes, that's the correct approach. The probability is the number of atoms in the path multiplied by the deflection area, divided by the target area. So the calculation is as above, leading to option F.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the probability that an alpha particle comes within a specific deflection radius of a nucleus in a piece of foil. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the target area**: The target area is the product of the foil's thickness and the cross-sectional area of an atom.
   \[
   \text{Target area} = \text{Foil thickness} \times \text{Area per atom} = 5 \times 10^4 \times 4 \times 10^{-16} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{cm}^2.
   \]

2. **Calculate the deflection area**: The area where the alpha particle could be deflected is a circle with radius equal to the deflection radius.
   \[
   \text{Deflection area} = \pi r^2 = \pi (1 \times 10^{-12})^2 = \pi \times 1 \times 10^{-24} \approx 3.14 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2.
   \]

3. **Compute the probability**: The probability is the ratio of the deflection area to the target area.
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Deflection area}}{\text{Target area}} = \frac{3.14 \times 10^{-24}}{2 \times 10^{-11}} = 1.57 \times 10^{-13}.
   \]
   This means the alpha particle has a 1 in 637,000,000,000 chance of hitting a nucleus within the specified radius.

4. **Match with the options**: The correct option corresponds to a probability of 1 in 1.25 × 10⁸, which is option F.
