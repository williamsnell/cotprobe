Okay, so I have this question about calculating GDP for an economy that produces two goods: cheese and crackers. Hmm, I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, and it's basically the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific period. Right, so for each good, you multiply the quantity produced by the price at which it's sold. Then you add both together.

The question says cheese sells for $3 a pound and 10 pounds are produced. Crackers sell for $2 a pound, and 20 pounds are produced. Wait, so I need to calculate the value of cheese and the value of crackers separately and then sum them.

Let me break it down. Cheese: quantity is 10 pounds, price $3 per pound. So 10 * 3 = $30. Crackers: 20 pounds at $2 each. 20 * 2 = $40. Adding them together: $30 + $40 = $70. So the total GDP should be $70. Looking at the options, option G is $70. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, another thought: Did I calculate correctly? 10 pounds at $3 is 10 times 3, which is 30. 20 times 2 is 40. 30 plus 40 is indeed 70. So yeah, I think that's right. So the answer should be G, $70.

The correct calculation involves multiplying the quantity of each good by its respective price and summing the results. For cheese: 10 pounds * $3 = $30. For crackers: 20 pounds * $2 = $40. Adding these together gives a total of $70. Therefore, the answer is G: $70.

Answer: G: $70
