Okay, I have this multiple-choice question to tackle, and I need to carefully think through each part. Let's start by understanding each statement and then evaluate their truthfulness.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and we have options about whether each is true or false. The options are labeled A through J, each combining the truth values of the two statements.

First, let's tackle Statement 1:

**Statement 1**: Suppose ∑|a_i| diverges and ∑ a_i = 2. There is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that ∑ a_i_k = 4.

Hmm. I remember something about Riemann series theorem. The theorem states that for a conditionally convergent series (where the series converges, but the series of absolute values diverges), any real number can be achieved by rearranging the terms. So, in this case, the original series ∑ a_i converges to 2. But wait, the original series has ∑|a_i| diverges, so it's conditionally convergent. By Riemann's theorem, we can rearrange the series to converge to any real number, including 4. So, Statement 1 must be True.

Now, looking at Statement 2:

**Statement 2**: There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X → Y such that f(X) is NOT “closed and bounded”.

Wait, in metric spaces, closed and bounded doesn't always imply compact, but in Euclidean spaces, by Heine-Borel, closed and bounded implies compact. However, in general metric spaces, a set can be closed and bounded without being compact, and thus not necessarily compact. But for the mapping, especially a continuous one, it's possible that f(X) is not closed or not bounded. 

Wait, but if X is closed and bounded in a metric space, then f(X) might not be closed and bounded. For example, consider X being the entire real line with the standard metric. But wait, in the real line, closed and bounded is just intervals [a,b]. If a continuous function maps [a,b] to some other space, say Y. Wait, maybe the function isn't mapping into a compact set.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler example: Let X be the real line, which is closed and unbounded, but wait, no, X should be closed and bounded. So maybe consider X = [0,1], which is closed and bounded. Let f be a continuous function that maps [0,1] to a space where f(X) is not closed and bounded. Wait, but [0,1] is compact, and continuous images of compact sets are compact. So f(X) would be compact, hence closed and bounded in Y. So that doesn't work.

Wait, what if Y is not a metric space? Wait, no, the question specifies metric spaces. So in that case, f(X) must be a compact subset of Y, hence closed and bounded. So Statement 2 says that f(X) is NOT closed and bounded. But according to the above, that's impossible. So Statement 2 must be False.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake here? Let me think again. Suppose Y is not a metric space. Wait, no, the question says metric spaces. So in a metric space, closed and bounded is equivalent to compact (Heine-Borel). So the image of a compact set under a continuous function is compact, hence closed and bounded. Thus, f(X) must be closed and bounded. So Statement 2 is False.

So summarizing: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Looking at the options, option F is True, False. So the correct answer should be F.

The analysis of the two statements leads us to conclude that Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False. Therefore, the correct option is F: True, False.

**Answer: F**
