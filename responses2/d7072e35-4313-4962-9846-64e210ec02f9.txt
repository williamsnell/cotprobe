Okay, so I have this question here about sales tax and how much John Cowan and his family paid. Hmm, let me read it again. 

They spent $6.75, $5.50, $2.35, and $1.95 on meals, all put on one check. So, I think that means they put all those amounts together into a single check. But wait, the problem is asking how much they paid in total, considering the sales tax. Oh right, because the sales tax is 3%, so I need to add that to the total.

Wait, let me break it down. First, I should find the total of the meals before tax. Let's add all those amounts. $6.75 + $5.50 is $12.25. Then $12.25 plus $2.35 would be $14.60. Adding the last $1.95 gives $16.55. So the total before tax is $16.55.

Now, I need to calculate the sales tax on that. Sales tax is 3%, so I can multiply the total by 0.03. Let me do that: 16.55 * 0.03. Hmm, 16 * 0.03 is 0.48, and 0.55 * 0.03 is 0.0165. Adding those together gives 0.4965. So the tax is approximately $0.4965, which I can round to about $0.50 for simplicity.

Adding the tax to the total, the amount paid would be $16.55 + $0.50 = $17.05. So that's the total they paid with the single check.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "how much would they have had to pay if separate checks were issued?" Oh, right, that's when each meal is paid separately. So in that case, there's no tax on each item because each would be a separate transaction. So the total would just be the sum of the individual amounts without tax.

Let me add those again without tax: $6.75 + $5.50 is $12.25. Then $12.25 + $2.35 is $14.60, and adding $1.95 gives $16.55. So without tax, it's $16.55.

Wait, but the question says "if separate checks were issued," so that would imply that the meals are paid separately, no tax on each. So the total would be $16.55. But wait, looking at the options, I see option G is $17.05 and option H is $16.55. So which one is the correct answer for the single check scenario?

The question says "how much did they pay? If separate checks..." So the first part is the amount after tax and combining all into one check. The second part is the amount if each was paid separately, so without tax. So the first answer should be $17.05, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. The initial total is $6.75 + $5.50 + $2.35 + $1.95. Let's compute that again.

6.75 + 5.50 = 12.25.

12.25 + 2.35 = 14.60.

14.60 + 1.95 = 16.55. Yes, that's correct.

Now, tax is 3% of 16.55. Let's calculate:

16.55 * 0.03 = 0.4965. So $0.4965 rounds to $0.50. So total becomes 16.55 + 0.50 = $17.05. So the first answer is $17.05, which is option G.

But wait, the options are a bit confusing. The first option is A: $18.55, B: $17.55, etc. So option G is $17.05.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me re-add the amounts:

$6.75

$5.50 (Total so far: 12.25)

$2.35 (Total: 14.60)

$1.95 (Total: 16.55). Yes, correct.

So the single check amount is $17.05, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option H is 16.55, which is the total without tax. But the question is asking for the total with tax. So when the options are presented, the first part is when it's a single check (so including tax), and the second part is when each is paid separately (no tax), so the amounts are $17.05 and $16.55, respectively.

So the first option (the one for the single check) is G: $17.05, and the second is H: $16.55.

Wait, but the question says: "How much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?"

So the first part is the total with tax and single check, which is $17.05 (G). The second part is the total without tax (16.55), which is H. So looking at the options, the first answer is G, the second is H.

Wait, but the options presented are A to J, in order. So the questions are two parts: the first is with the tax and single check, the second is without tax (separate checks). So in the options, (A:18.55, B:17.55, C:15.05, D:16.75, E:17.25, F:16.95, G:17.05, H:16.55, I:15.55, J:18.05).

Wait, so the first question's answer is G, and the second is H. But the options don't allow me to choose two. Wait, the question says: "how much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?" So the options are the possible answers for each part.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "John Cowan and his family were traveling through a state in which the sales tax was 3%. They spent $6.75, $5.50, $2.35 and $1.95 for their meals, all of which were put on one check. How much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?"

Wait, no, wait. The way it's phrased, the first part is the total with tax (their actual payment with single check), and the second part is the total without tax (if separate checks), but the options are the answer for each scenario.

Wait, perhaps the options are for each part. So the first part (single check) is G, and the second part (separate checks) is H. But in the options, each letter is a possible answer for the first part only.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total. Let me recalculate:

6.75 +5.50 = 12.25

12.25 +2.35 = 14.60

14.60 +1.95 = 16.55 (total before tax).

Tax is 3% of 16.55: 16.55 * 0.03 = 0.4965, which is approximately $0.50.

So total with tax is 16.55 + 0.50 = 17.05. So the amount with a single check is $17.05, which is option G.

The amount without tax is $16.55, which is option H.

So the question's first part is about the single check (so including tax), and the second part is about separate checks (so without tax). But looking at the options, each letter is an option for the first part only. So perhaps the options are the possible answers for each part.

Wait, the question says "how much did they pay? If separate checks..." So the first answer is G (17.05), and the second is H (16.55). But the options don't have H as an option for the first part. So perhaps this is a multi-select question, but no, the options are A to J, each letter being an answer for one part.

Wait, perhaps the options are for the two parts, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just focus on the first part. The question is: How much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?

So the first answer is the amount with tax (17.05), and the second is without tax (16.55). But looking at the options, the first part could be G, and the second part H.

But the options given are A to J, each being a possible answer for each part. Wait, but perhaps in this setup, the first part is the correct answer, and the second part is a separate option, but the options are presented as G and H, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The question is a bit ambiguous. But I think the first part is the amount when they put it on a single check (so including tax, 17.05), and the second part is when each item is paid separately (so no tax, 16.55). So the answers for each part are G and H, respectively.

But looking at the options (A to J), each is a possible answer for each scenario. Wait, perhaps each letter represents the answer for the first part only. So G is the answer to the first part (with tax), H to the second (without), but the options don't include both. So perhaps the correct answer is G, and the second part is H.

Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the question's options are two separate answers, but in the same setup. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Oh wait, the question is structured as: "How much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?" So the first part is the amount with a single check, the second part is without, but the options are just for the first part. So perhaps the options are for the first scenario only.

Wait, no, looking at the options again, each is a possible answer for each part. So the options are:

A: 18.55

B:17.55

C:15.05

D:16.75

E:17.25

F:16.95

G:17.05

H:16.55

I:15.55

J:18.05

So the first part of the question is asking about the single-check amount, which is 17.05 (G). The second part is asking about the scenario with separate checks, which is 16.55 (H).

But in the options, each is a possible answer for either the first or second part. So, the first part is G, the second is H. But the options don't have H as an option for the first part. So the correct answers for each scenario are G and H, respectively. But the options don't allow that; perhaps the options are structured as two answers, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is structured so that each answer is the possible total when using a single check (G) or when using separate checks (H). So the correct answers would be G and H, but in the options, each letter is an option for each scenario.

Wait, perhaps the options are for each scenario. So for the single-check, the correct answer is G, and for the separate checks, it's H. But since the options don't have H as an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are given in a way that each letter is the correct answer for each scenario. So if I have to choose between the options, the first part's answer is G, the second is H.

But in the given options, the letters are independent. So perhaps the first scenario is G, and the second is H.

Wait, perhaps I should just think that the correct answer for the first scenario is G, and the second is H. So the options have G and H as possible answers. But in the options, each letter is a possible answer for each scenario, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the question is actually:

John spent $16.55 total with tax, so the single check was $17.05 (G). And if he paid separately, no tax, so $16.55 (H). But the options are presented as each being an option for each scenario. So the options are:

A: 18.55

B:17.55

C:15.05

D:16.75

E:17.25

F:16.95

G:17.05

H:16.55

I:15.55

J:18.05

So the first part is when they use a single check (G), and the second part is when they use separate checks (H). So the answers are G and H, but in the options, how are they presented? It's unclear. But perhaps each letter in the options is an answer for each part. So for the first part, correct is G; for the second, correct is H. But I'm not sure how the options are set up.

Wait, perhaps the question is a two-part question, but the options are presented as two separate scenarios. But since the options are presented as individual letters, perhaps the correct answer is the first scenario's option (G) and the second scenario's option (H). But in the options, each letter is a possible answer for each scenario.

So perhaps the answer is G and H. But in the options, the letters are separate, so perhaps the correct answers are G and H. However, the options don't have both letters as correct answers, but perhaps the question is only asking about the single-check scenario, so the correct answer is G.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

The first part is the amount they paid with a single check, including tax (17.05). The second part is without tax, so 16.55, which is option H. So the correct answers are G and H, but the options are presented as separate letters. So perhaps the answer is G for the first part and H for the second.

But looking at the options, each letter is an option for each scenario. So the first scenario's answer is G, and the second scenario's is H. But since the options are presented as G and H, perhaps that's the correct approach.

But since the options don't have both G and H as separate options, perhaps the intended answer is G only, as the first part.

Wait, no, the question is asking for two scenarios: when using a single check and when using separate checks. So the options are for each scenario. So perhaps the correct answers are G and H, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the question is only asking for the single-check amount, which is G, and the other part isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just proceed to the calculations again.

Total before tax: 6.75 +5.50 +2.35 +1.95. Let's compute:

6.75 +5.50 = 12.25

12.25 +2.35 = 14.60

14.60 +1.95 = 16.55.

Tax is 3% of 16.55: 16.55 * 0.03 = 0.4965, which is approximately $0.50. So total with tax is $16.55 + $0.50 = $17.05. So the first scenario (single check) is $17.05, which is option G.

The second scenario (separate checks) is $16.55, which is option H.

But the options are presented as single letters, so perhaps the correct answers are G and H. But since the options don't allow for both, perhaps the question only asks for the first part. So the correct answer is G.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for each scenario, and the first part is G, the second is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G, and the question is only asking about the single-check scenario.

Wait, looking back at the question, it's:

"How much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?"

So it's two separate questions. The first part is under the single-check scenario, and the second part is under the separate checks scenario.

In the options, each letter is a possible answer for each scenario. So for the single-check scenario (with tax), the correct answer is G. For the separate scenario (without tax), the correct answer is H.

But in the options, each letter is a possible answer for either scenario. But in this setup, the first scenario's answer is G, and the second is H.

But since the options are presented as separate, perhaps the answers are G and H, but the options don't have both. So perhaps the question is only asking about the single-check scenario, and the other scenario's answer isn't provided as an option. So the correct answer is G.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way: perhaps the question is only asking about the single-check scenario, and thus the correct answer is G. The other scenario's answer is not provided, but it's not necessary for the question's answer.

In any case, I think the correct answer for the single-check scenario is G: $17.05.
</think>

The total amount spent on meals before tax is $16.55. With a 3% sales tax, the total becomes $17.05. 

For the single-check scenario (including tax), the correct answer is G: $17.05.

**Answer: G**
