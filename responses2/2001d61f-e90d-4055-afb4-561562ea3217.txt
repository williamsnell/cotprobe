Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about hearsay exceptions. The question is about whether the housekeeper's testimony is admissible against the mall owner in a case of negligence. 

The scenario is a shopper slipped and fell on a wet spot, suffered injuries, and sued the mall owner for negligence. The housekeeper testified that the shopper was bedridden and couldn't work for a month because of a sprained back. She also mentioned that her back is killing her and it's really painful. 

The mall's counsel moved to strike the housekeeper's testimony. The question is whether this motion should be granted or denied.

First, I remember that hearsay is a statement made to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but it can't be proven by evidence unless it falls under a hearsay exception. The exceptions include things like statement by a witness, statement of a client, statement of a doctor, etc.

So the housekeeper is testifying about the shopper's condition. Let's see what exceptions apply here. 

The shopper testified that her back was worse, and she couldn't work. But that's not directly about the injury. The housekeeper's testimony is about the back condition as a result of the injury. 

Wait, the housekeeper's testimony is about the shopper's condition, which is a personal matter. If she's testifying about the shopper's condition, does that count as hearsay? Hearsay requires the statement to be made for the truth of the matter asserted. But the statement about her own condition is about someone else's condition, not the matter asserted. So I'm not sure if that's hearsay. 

Wait, let's think again. The issue is about whether the shopper's statement to the housekeeper is hearsay. The shopper said she was bedridden because of the sprained back. The mall owner is suing. The housekeeper is testifying about the shopper's condition, not about the injury itself. So the statement made to the housekeeper is about the shopper's condition, not the injury. 

But in this case, the statement is about the shopper's condition, which is a statement of the present state of the person, not the injury. So is that hearsay? Hmm. Because the statement is about the shopper's condition, which could be seen as a statement of the present body condition, not the injury itself. Wait, but the injury is the back issue. So the injury is the cause, and the present condition is the effect. 

Wait, but the hearsay exception would require the statement to be made under a hearsay exception. For example, statement by a witness, statement of a client, statement of a doctor, etc. The shopper testified that she was bedridden. Is that a hearsay exception? Or is that a statement of the present body condition?

Wait, the issue is about the admissibility of the housekeeper's testimony. The housekeeper's testimony is about the shopper's condition. So the statement is about the condition of the person, not the injury itself. So if the statement is about the condition, is that hearsay? Or is it considered a statement of the present body condition, which might be allowed under certain exceptions.

Wait, the rule is that a statement of the present body condition (including a condition of death) is a hearsay exception if it's made under a hearsay exception. But in this case, the statement of the shopper's condition is about the shopper's condition, not the injury. So perhaps it's not hearsay and can be used, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is hearsay because it's about the shopper's condition, which is a personal matter, but it's not the injury. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Another angle: the housekeeper testified about the shopper's condition, which is a statement made specifically about the shopper's state of mind or physical condition. So it's a statement of the present condition of the person, which is allowed under present sense impression or statement for medical purposes. Wait, but the statement was made during a conversation with the shopper, not under a hearsay exception.

Wait, the statement was made during the conversation with the shopper. So the statement is not hearsay because it wasn't made under a hearsay exception. So that would mean that the statement is not hearsay and can be used. But wait, in the question, the housekeeper is testifying about the shopper's condition, which is a personal matter. So is that a hearsay issue?

Wait, the testifying statement is about the shopper's condition, which is a statement of the present physical condition of the person, but that's not the injury itself. So perhaps it's not hearsay because it's a statement of the present condition of the person, not the injury. But I'm a bit confused because the injury is what caused the condition, but the statement is about the condition itself.

So, the question is about whether the housekeeper's testimony is hearsay. If the statement is hearsay, then it's subject to exceptions. But if it's not, then it's not hearsay and can be used.

But wait, the statement was made to the housekeeper, not to the shopper. So the statement is about the shopper's condition. But the court may not consider that a hearsay issue because the statement is about the shopper's condition, not the injury. So perhaps the statement is not hearsay and can be used.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is hearsay because it's about the shopper's condition, which is a personal statement, but the statement is being made about the shopper's condition, which could be a statement of the present body condition. 

Wait, another approach: the statement is about the shopper's condition, which is a statement of the present body condition. The exception for statement of the present body condition is if it's made under a hearsay exception. But in this case, the statement was made under a hearsay exception (the shopper testified about her condition, which is her statement under a hearsay exception). 

Wait, no. The statement is made to the housekeeper, not to the shopper. So the statement is not under a hearsay exception. Therefore, it's not hearsay and can be used, meaning the motion should be granted.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

The statement is made to the housekeeper. The housekeeper's testimony is about the shopper's condition, which is a statement of the present condition of the person. The present condition is a statement of the present body condition. Under the present sense impression exception, statements of the present body condition (including death) are admissible if made under a hearsay exception. But in this case, the statement was made under a hearsay exception (the shopper testified about her condition), but wait, that's the other way around.

Wait, the statement was made by the shopper, so it's under the hearsay exception. But the statement is about the shopper's condition, which is the present condition. So the statement is hearsay because it's being made for the truth of the matter asserted (the shopper's condition). But if the statement was made under a hearsay exception, then it's inadmissible as hearsay. But in this case, the statement is made to the housekeeper, not to the shopper. So the statement is not under a hearsay exception, making it not hearsay. Therefore, the statement is not hearsay and can be used, so the motion should be granted.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me check the options. 

Looking at the options, option F says the statement would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition. Option G says adoptive admission, and H says medical treatment statement.

Wait, the statement is about the shopper's condition, which is the present condition. So the standard exception for present body condition is present sense impression or statement for medical purposes. But the statement was made by the shopper, which is under a hearsay exception. But wait, the statement is not under a hearsay exception because it was made to the housekeeper, not the shopper. So the statement is not hearsay, so it can be admitted.

Wait, no. If the statement is about the shopper's condition, which is a statement of the present condition of the person. So the statement is a statement of the present condition of the person. So under the present sense impression exception, it would be admissible. So the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible, so the motion should be granted.

Wait, but the statement was made to the housekeeper, so is that a hearsay exception? Because it's the housekeeper's testifying about the shopper's condition. So the statement is made to the housekeeper, not to the shopper. Therefore, the statement is not in the form of a hearsay exception. So it's not hearsay, meaning it's admissible.

So the options are:

A: granted, because it's hearsay not within any exception. But I think it's not hearsay, so A is wrong.

B: granted because it's based on subjective self-assessment. That's about the shopper's own testimony, not the statement of the condition.

C: denied because statement is excited utterance. Hmm, excited utterance is when a statement is made under the pressure of a situation that requires it to be believed, like a medical emergency. But in this case, the statement was made under the circumstances of a back issue, which isn't an emergency. So maybe not an excited utterance. So C might not be correct.

D: denied because it's adoptive admission. I'm not sure about that.

E: granted because not related. Not sure.

F: denied because it's a declaration of present condition, admissible as a present sense impression.

Wait, so if the statement is made by the shopper, under a hearsay exception, but the statement is about the shopper's condition, not the injury. So the statement is not hearsay because it's not being made under a hearsay exception. Therefore, it's not hearsay, so the motion should be granted. Thus, option F is saying the statement would be admissible as a declaration of present condition. So the answer would be F.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the housekeeper's testimony about the shopper's condition is admissible against the mall owner. The key issue is whether the statement is hearsay and whether it falls within any recognized exceptions.

1. **Hearsay Exception Consideration**: The statement is about the shopper's condition, which is a personal matter. However, the statement was made to the housekeeper, not to the shopper, so it is not under a hearsay exception. This means the statement is not hearsay and can be admitted.

2. **Admissibility as Present Body Condition**: The statement is a statement of the present condition of the person, which falls under the present sense impression exception. This exception allows statements of the present condition of the person, including death, if made under a hearsay exception. However, in this case, the statement was made by the shopper, not the housekeeper, so the hearsay exception does not apply. The statement is not hearsay, making it admissible regardless of the hearsay exception.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option F**: Correct. The shopper's statement is about the present condition of the person, which is admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition under the present sense impression exception.

Thus, the motion should be granted because the housekeeper's testimony is not hearsay and is admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.
