Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these titration problems. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that 50.0 mL of 0.0025 M HBr is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.0023 M KOH. I need to find the pH of the resulting mixture. Hmm, right, because HBr and KOH are both strong acids and bases, but wait, KOH is a strong base. So when they react, they should neutralize each other.

I remember that strong acid and strong base reactions produce water and a salt. So in this case, HBr is the acid, and KOH is the base. They'll neutralize each other to form water and KBr, which is the potassium bromide. 

Wait, but wait—what's the molarity of each solution? Let me jot down the details. HBr is 0.0025 M, and KOH is 0.0023 M. Each solution is 50 mL. So the moles of HBr and KOH can be calculated. 

Molarity is moles per liter, right? So moles of HBr would be 0.0025 M * 0.05 L = 0.000125 moles. Similarly, KOH has 0.0023 M * 0.05 L = 0.000115 moles. 

Wait, that's 0.000125 moles of HBr and 0.000115 moles of KOH. Since HBr is an acid, it donates H+ ions, and KOH provides OH- ions. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ from HBr would be 0.000125, and OH- from KOH would be 0.000115.

So when they react, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The excess will determine the pH. Let's subtract the moles.

H+ (from HBr) = 0.000125 mol
OH- (from KOH) = 0.000115 mol

So the difference is 0.00001 mol (since 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.00001). 

This excess H+ means we'll have some H+ left in the solution. So the concentration of H+ is 0.00001 mol divided by the total volume after mixing.

The total volume is 50 mL +50 mL = 100 mL which is 0.1 L.

So concentration of H+ = 0.00001 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0001 M. Wait, that's 1e-4 M. 

Wait, wait, wait. So the pH is -log(1e-4) which is 4. But wait, that can't be right because I thought maybe the neutralization would produce some salt. Oh wait, but in this case, HBr is in excess.

Wait, wait, because 0.000125 mol HBr and 0.000115 mol KOH. So HBr is more. So after neutralization, the excess HBr is 0.00001 mol. So HBr is H+ and Br^-.

So the solution is acidic because H+ is in excess. So the pH is less than 7. 

Wait, but wait, the options include 1, 2, 3,4,5, etc. So pH=4, which is option E. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

So, HBr: 0.0025 M *0.05 L = 0.000125 mol. KOH: 0.0023 *0.05 = 0.000115 mol. So HBr has more moles. The reaction is HBr + KOH → KBr + H2O. So the moles after reaction: 

HBr: 0.000125 -0.000115 = 0.00001 mol. 

So total volume is 100 mL. So [H+] = 0.00001 / 0.1 = 0.0001 M. 

pH = -log(0.0001) = 4. So the pH is 4. So the correct answer is option E (4).

To determine the pH of the resulting mixture when 50.0 mL of 0.0025 M HBr is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.0023 M KOH, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the reaction**: HBr (a strong acid) and KOH (a strong base) react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce water (H₂O) and potassium bromide (KBr), which is a neutral salt.

2. **Calculate moles of HBr and KOH**:
   - Moles of HBr = \( 0.0025 \, \text{M} \times 0.0500 \, \text{L} = 0.000125 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Moles of KOH = \( 0.0023 \, \text{M} \times 0.0500 \, \text{L} = 0.000115 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant and excess H⁺**:
   - Since HBr and KOH react in a 1:1 ratio, the KOH is the limiting reactant. The excess moles of H⁺ are:
     \[
     \text{Excess H⁺} = 0.000125 \, \text{mol} - 0.000115 \, \text{mol} = 0.00001 \, \text{mol}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the total volume of the solution**:
   - The total volume is \( 50.0 \, \text{mL} + 50.0 \, \text{mL} = 100.0 \, \text{mL} = 0.100 \, \text{L} \).

5. **Determine the concentration of H⁺**:
   - The concentration of H⁺ is:
     \[
     [\text{H⁺}] = \frac{0.00001 \, \text{mol}}{0.100 \, \text{L}} = 0.0001 \, \text{M}.
     \]

6. **Calculate the pH**:
   - The pH is given by:
     \[
     \text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H⁺}]} = -\log{10^{-4}} = 4.
     \]

Thus, the pH of the resulting mixture is **4**, which corresponds to option E.
