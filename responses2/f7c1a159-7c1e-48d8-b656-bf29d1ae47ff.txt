Okay, so I have this question about whether pure capitalism can adapt to changes in consumer tastes. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that pure capitalism is a theoretical model where there's no government intervention. People own the means of production, and there's no regulation. So, I guess that means the economy operates under the invisible hand, making decisions based on market forces.

The question is about whether it can adjust to changes in consumer tastes. So, consumer tastes change, like people buying more of a particular product or not. If a person's preferences shift, does capitalism adapt? I think the question is about whether the system can respond to these changes.

I recall that in the real world, especially in countries with free markets, companies adjust their production based on what consumers are buying. For example, if a new health trend comes out, a company might change their product line or marketing strategy. That shows that even without government intervention, the economy can adjust.

So, looking at the options:

Option A says it adapts by adjusting production and resource markets. That sounds right because capitalism allows for market-driven decisions, so it should change based on what's in demand.

Option B claims it disregards changes in resource markets. That doesn't make sense because resource markets are part of the economy's structure. If tastes change, resources might shift, but capitalism would still adjust.

Option C says it doesn't adjust. That's the opposite of what I know. If tastes change, the economy should change.

Option D says it's immune. That's definitely not the case because the economy inherently reacts to changes.

So, the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: Pure capitalism adapts to changes in consumer tastes by adjusting production of consumer goods and resource markets.
