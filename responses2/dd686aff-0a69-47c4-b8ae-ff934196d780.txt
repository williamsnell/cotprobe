Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about different cultures and their agricultural practices. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which culture, previously known as temple-mound builders, had their main subsistence based on maize and squash. The options are A to J, each with a different culture.

First, I should probably remember what each of these cultures is known for. Let me think. I'm pretty sure that maize is also called corn. So, the subsistence was primarily on maize and squash.

I remember that the Moundville people are known for having large, flat lands that were used for farming. They were in the Mississippi River area, and their agriculture was very productive. So their subsistence was probably tied to maize and squash. That makes me think Moundville is the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check the other options to make sure. Hohokam is from the Inuit, right? They were farmers, but I think their practices were more related to fishing and hunting, not focused on maize and squash. Folsom is another Inuit community; they were also farmers and might have used similar methods, but again, not maize and squash.

Ancestral Puebloan sounds familiar. I think they were in the Southwest, maybe in the Snake River area. I recall that they were known for their squash and corn. Oh wait, but I'm not sure if the question refers to the main subsistence being maize and squash. Let me think, Ancestral Puebloan was a group of Puebloans, I think their agriculture was more focused on squash and corn. So maybe that's another option. But I'm not sure if they were temple-mound builders.

Alternatively, the Hopewell people are from New England, I think. They were known for their squash, and their farming was very productive. So Hopewell might fit. But wait, I'm not certain if they were temple-mound builders.

Moundville, as I thought earlier, was in the Mississippi Delta. They were known for large, flat lands, and their practices were quite productive for farmers. So their subsistence was probably on maize and squash.

Wait, let's get the details straight. The question specifies "temple-mound builders," which I think refers to the Moundville people. Because temple-mound builders are a term I've heard before, perhaps referring to the Moundville group as temple builders. So looking at the Moundville option, that's one of the choices.

The other options: Ancestral Puebloan might be more about squash and corn, and maybe they were involved in temple or cultural structures, but perhaps not primarily on maize and squash as subsistence. Hopewell was more associated with squash, I think.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is Moundville, which is option G.

The correct answer is G: Moundville. Moundville was known for their large, flat lands and highly productive farming practices, which were primarily based on maize and squash. 

Answer: G
