Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: compute the product (12)(16) in Z_24. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ring theory, but let's think this through. 

First, Z_24 is the ring of integers modulo 24. So, when we multiply 12 and 16 in this ring, it's like taking their product modulo 24. Right, because in modular arithmetic, multiplication wraps around after the modulus.

So, I'll start by multiplying 12 and 16 normally. 12 times 16 is... let me calculate that. 12 times 10 is 120, and 12 times 6 is 72. So, 120 + 72 equals 192. So, 12 * 16 = 192.

Now, I need to find 192 modulo 24. That is, find the remainder when 192 is divided by 24. Let's see, 24 times 8 is 192 exactly. So 192 divided by 24 is 8 with no remainder. Therefore, 192 modulo 24 is 0.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check that. Did I compute the product correctly? 12 *16 is indeed 192. And 192 divided by 24 is exactly 8. So 192 mod 24 is indeed 0. So the result should be 0 in Z_24.

Looking at the options, option F is 0. So that must be the correct answer.

The product (12)(16) in Z_24 is 0, as 12*16=192, and 192 mod 24=0.
