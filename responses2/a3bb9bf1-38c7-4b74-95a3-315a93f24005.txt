Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about gravitational red shift when a photon travels from the sun to the Earth. Hmm, I remember that gravitational red shift has something to do with how light loses energy as it climbs out of a gravitational well. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

I recall that the gravitational red shift formula involves the gravitational potential and the speed of light. Oh right, the formula for the gravitational red shift (z) is something like z = (G*M)/(R*c²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object (like the Sun), R is the radius at which the photon is emitted, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but wait, gravitational red shift usually refers to the shift in wavelength when light is emitted from a strong gravitational field (like a planet) and reaches a region of weaker gravity (like far away). The photon loses energy, so the wavelength stretches (red shift), which means the frequency decreases. Oh, right, the formula gives the shift z, which is the factor by which the wavelength increases. So the observed wavelength is longer than emitted, which is redshift.

So the problem is asking for the magnitude of the gravitational red shift. So I need to compute z = (G*M_sun)/(R_earth*c²). Let me jot down the values I think I need.

The gravitational constant G is approximately 6.674×10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2. The mass of the Sun, M_sun, is about 1.989×10^30 kg. The radius of the Sun, R_sun, is roughly 6.96×10^8 meters. The speed of light, c, is 3×10^8 m/s.

Wait, but wait, when the photon is leaving the Sun, it's at the Sun's surface. So R is the radius of the Sun. So I'll use R_sun in the formula.

So plugging the numbers into the formula:

z = (G * M_sun) / (R_sun * c²)

Calculating step by step.

First, let's compute the numerator: G * M_sun.

G = 6.674e-11
M_sun = 1.989e30
Multiply them: 6.674e-11 * 1.989e30 = ?

Let me compute that. 6.674 * 1.989 is approximately 13.27. Then, 1e-11 * 1e30 is 1e20. So numerator is about 13.27e20 = 1.327e21.

Now the denominator is R_sun * c².

R_sun = 6.96e8 m
c² = (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s²

Multiply R_sun by c²: 6.96e8 * 9e16 = ?

6.96 *9 is approximately 62.64. Then 1e8 * 1e16 is 1e24. So 6.96e8 *9e16 = 62.64e24 = 6.264e25 m³/s².

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because c² is m²/s², multiplying by R_sun (m) gives m³/s². So the denominator is m³/s².

Wait, but the units: numerator is (m³ kg/s²) * kg? Wait no, wait. Wait, the units for G*M_sun are (m³ kg^-1 s^-2) * kg = m³ s^-2.

Denominator is m (R) * (m²/s²) (c²) → m^3/s².

So the units for z are (m^3 s^-2) / (m^3 s^-2) ) → dimensionless, which makes sense.

So back to the calculation. The denominator is 6.96e8 m * (9e16 m²/s²) = 6.96e8 * 9e16 = let's compute that.

6.96 * 9 = approximately 62.64. 62.64e24 (since 1e8 * 1e16=1e24). So 6.264e25.

So numerator is 1.327e21, denominator 6.264e25.

So z ≈ (1.327e21) / (6.264e25) ≈ let's compute 1.327 /6.264 ≈ 0.212. Then 1e21 / 1e25 is 1e-4. So 0.212e-4 → 2.12e-5.

Wait, wait. Let me do that calculation more accurately.

1.327e21 / 6.264e25.

Divide 1.327 by 6.264: 1.327 /6.264 ≈ 0.212.

Multiply by (1e21)/(1e25) → 1e-4.

So 0.212e-4 = 2.12e-5.

Wait, that's 0.0000212. But wait, that's higher than some of the given options. Let me check the options again. The options are in the order of 0.000001 (1e-6) up to 0.0000038 (3.8e-6). Hmm, 2.1e-5 is 0.000021, which is about twice the options.

Wait, did I mess up the calculation? Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator. Let me re-calculate G*M_sun.

G = 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s^-2

M_sun = 1.989e30 kg.

So G*M_sun = 6.674e-11 * 1.989e30.

Let me compute the product:

6.674 * 1.989 ≈ 13.27 (since 6.674 * 2 is about 13.348, so 1.989 is a bit less than 2, so 13.27).

So 13.27e ( -11 +30 ) → 13.27e19 → 1.327e20.

Wait, wait. 1e-11 *1e30 is 1e20. So 6.674e-11 *1.989e30 = (6.674 *1.989) *1e19 → 13.27 *1e19= 1.327e20.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 1e21. No, wait, 1e-11 *1e30 is 1e20, so 13.27 *1e20 is 1.327e21. So that part was correct.

Denominator: R_sun * c².

R_sun =6.96e8 m.

c²= (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So R_sun * c²=6.96e8 *9e16 = (6.96 *9) * 1e24 → 62.64e24 =6.264e25.

So z= (1.327e21) / (6.264e25) = (1.327 /6.264) * 1e-4.

1.327 /6.264 ≈ 0.212.

So 0.212e-4 = 2.12e-5.

Wait, 2.12e-5 is 0.0000212. But the options are all around 0.000001 (1e-6) up to 0.0000038 (3.8e-6). So 2.1e-5 is 0.000021, which is bigger than any of the options. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I confused the gravitational redshift formula. Oh wait, because I'm calculating the gravitational redshift from the Sun to Earth, but sometimes the formula is presented as z = (1/(sqrt(1 - 2GM/(R c²)))) -1. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, another approach: The gravitational redshift formula is z = (1/2) v/c, where v is the escape velocity from the Sun's gravitational field at Earth's position. Alternatively, another way to write it is z = (v_esc^2)/(2 c^2), where v_esc is the escape velocity from the Sun at Earth's distance.

Wait, the escape velocity from the Sun's surface is v_esc = sqrt(2 G M_sun / R_sun). Then, the gravitational redshift z is v_esc²/(2 c²).

So let me compute that.

v_esc = sqrt(2 G M_sun / R_sun )

So v_esc² = 2 G M_sun / R_sun.

So z = (2 G M_sun / R_sun c² ) / 2 → z = (G M_sun) / (R_sun c²). Wait, that's the same as before.

So perhaps I did the calculation correctly, but the result is around 2.1e-5. But the options are all in the order of 1e-6 to 3.8e-6.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Because sometimes gravitational redshift is expressed as z = (G M)/(R c²), but I think that's correct.

Wait, let me re-express the calculation with exact values.

Compute the numerator:

G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

M_sun = 1.9885e30 kg

R_sun = 6.957e8 m

Compute numerator: G * M_sun = 6.67430e-11 * 1.9885e30 = (6.67430 * 1.9885) e( -11 +30 )

6.67430 *1.9885 = approximately 13.27 * 1e19 (since 6.67430 * 2=13.3486, so 13.27 is close to that).

So 13.27e19 = 1.327e20.

Denominator: R_sun * c² = 6.957e8 * (3e8)^2 = 6.957e8 *9e16 = (6.957 *9) e(8+16) = 62.613e24 = 6.2613e25.

So z = 1.327e20 / 6.2613e25.

= (1.327 /6.2613) * 1e(20-25) → approx 0.212 * 1e-5 → 2.12e-6.

Ah! So that's 0.00000212, which is about 2.1e-6.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.0000012 (1.2e-6), option E is 0.0000021, which is 2.1e-6.

Wait, but wait, the actual value of the gravitational redshift is higher than that. Because the Sun's escape velocity is higher, so the redshift should be higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute it with more precise numbers.

Compute G*M_sun:

6.67430e-11 * 1.9885e30 = (6.67430 * 1.9885) * 1e19.

Compute 6.67430 *1.9885.

6.67430 * 1.9885 = let's calculate step by step.

1.9885 = 2 - 0.0115.

6.67430 * 2 = 13.3486

Minus 6.67430 *0.0115.

6.67430 *0.01 =0.066743

6.67430 *0.0015=0.01001145.

So 0.066743 + 0.01001145= 0.07675445.

So 13.3486 - 0.07675445 = 13.2718455.

So 13.2718455e19 = 1.32718455e20.

Denominator: R_sun * c^2 = 6.957e8 m * (9e16 m²/s²) = 6.957e8 *9e16 = 62.613e24 =6.2613e25.

So z= (1.32718455e20)/(6.2613e25)= 1.32718455 /6.2613 * 1e-5.

Compute 1.32718455 divided by 6.2613.

6.2613 × 0.212 = 6.2613 *0.2=1.25226; 6.2613 *0.012=0.0751356 → total about 1.3273956. Which is very close to 1.32718.

So 1.32718455 /6.2613 ≈ 0.212.

So 0.212e-5 is 2.12e-6. Which is 0.00000212.

Which corresponds to option E: 0.0000021.

Wait, option E is 0.0000021, which is 2.1e-6.

But wait, some sources I've read before say that the gravitational redshift from the sun to Earth is about 2.1e-6. So the calculation leads me to that.

Looking back, the options are:

Options:

A: 0.0000015 → 1.5e-6

B: 0.0000055 →5.5e-6

C: 0.0000008 →8e-7

D: 0.0000042 →4.2e-6

E: 0.0000021 →2.1e-6

F: 0.0000025 →2.5e-6

G: 0.0000031 →3.1e-6

H: 0.0000028 →2.8e-6

I: 0.0000038 →3.8e-6

J: 0.0000012 →1.2e-6

So 2.1e-6 is option E.

Wait, but another source I remember (from my notes) says that the gravitational redshift from the Sun to Earth is about 2.1e-6. So that's about 0.0000021, which is option E.

But wait, let me double-check the exact formula. Another way to think about it is using the gravitational potential.

The gravitational redshift is given by z = (2 G M) / (c² R), where R is the distance at which the photon is emitted (Sun's radius) and z is the gravitational redshift (the factor by which wavelength is stretched).

Wait, another formula I've seen is z = (2 G M) / (c² R). Let me try that.

Compute z:

(2 *6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 ) / ( (3e8)^2 *6.957e8 )

Compute numerator: 2 *6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = 2 * (1.327e20) →2.654e20.

Denominator: (9e16) *6.957e8 →9e16 *6.957e8 =62.613e24 =6.2613e25.

So z=2.654e20 /6.2613e25 = (2.654 /6.2613) *1e-5.

2.654 /6.2613 = approx 0.424.

So 0.424e-5=4.24e-6, which is 4.24e-6.

But earlier calculation using z= G M/(R c²) gave 2.12e-6.

Wait, why the discrepancy? Oh, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me clarify.

Wait, in some references, gravitational redshift is defined as z = (1/(sqrt(1 - 2GM/(R c²))) -1) ≈ v_esc²/(2 c²), where v_esc is the escape velocity.

So v_esc = sqrt(2 G M / R )

So gravitational redshift z = v_esc²/(2 c²) = (2 G M / R ) / (2 c²) ) = (G M)/(R c²). Wait, that's the same as before.

So perhaps I made a mistake in using the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula z = (G M_sun)/(R_sun c²) without the 2 in the numerator, but according to the formula, that is correct.

Another approach: Let's compute the gravitational redshift using the formula z = (v_esc²)/(2 c²).

Compute v_esc:

v_esc = sqrt(2 G M / R )

= sqrt( (2 * 6.674e-11 *1.9885e30 ) /6.957e8 )

= sqrt( (2*6.674e-11 *1.9885e30) /6.957e8 )

Calculate numerator inside sqrt:

2 *6.674e-11 *1.9885e30 = 2 *1.327e20 = 2.654e20.

Denominator:6.957e8.

So 2.654e20 /6.957e8 = 3.81e11.

v_esc = sqrt(3.81e11) = approx 6.17e5 m/s.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s.

So v_esc^2 = (6.17e5)^2 = approx 3.81e11 m²/s².

So z = (3.81e11) / (2 * (3e8)^2) ) ?

Wait, wait, z is (v_esc^2)/(2 c^2).

v_esc^2 is 3.81e11.

2 c² is 2*(9e16)=1.8e17.

So z = 3.81e11 / 1.8e17 = approx 2.117e-6.

Which is the same as before, 2.117e-6.

So that's 0.000002117, which is approximately 2.12e-6.

So the correct answer is option E: 0.0000021.

Wait a second! But I just found another source that says the gravitational redshift from the Sun to Earth is about 2.1e-6, which matches this calculation. So the correct answer is option E: 0.0000021.

Wait, but another formula I've read says that the gravitational redshift is z = (v_esc²)/(2 c²). So the same as this.

Wait, in some references, gravitational redshift is defined as z = (1/(sqrt(1 - 2GM/(R c²))) -1) ≈ v_esc²/(2 c²). So same result.

So yes, the correct answer is option E: 0.0000021.
</think>

To calculate the gravitational redshift for light traveling from the Sun to Earth, we use the formula:

\[
z = \frac{G M}{R c^2}
\]

where:
- \( G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \) (gravitational constant),
- \( M = 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Sun),
- \( R = 6.957 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) (radius of the Sun),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator \( G \cdot M \)
\[
G \cdot M = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.9885 \times 10^{30}) = 1.327 \times 10^{20}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator \( R \cdot c^2 \)
\[
R \cdot c^2 = (6.957 \times 10^8) \cdot (9 \times 10^{16}) = 6.2613 \times 10^{25}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( z \)
\[
z = \frac{G \cdot M}{R \cdot c^2} = \frac{1.327 \times 10^{20}}{6.2613 \times 10^{25}} = 2.12 \times 10^{-6}
\]

This gives a gravitational redshift of approximately \( 0.0000021 \), which corresponds to option **E**.

### Additional Verification
To confirm, we can calculate the escape velocity from the Sun's surface:
\[
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}
\]
\[
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.9885 \times 10^{30})}{6.957 \times 10^8}} = \sqrt{3.81 \times 10^{11}} \approx 6.17 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The gravitational redshift is then:
\[
z = \frac{v_{\text{esc}}^2}{2 c^2} = \frac{(6.17 \times 10^5)^2}{2 \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{3.81 \times 10^{11}}{1.8 \times 10^{17}} \approx 2.11 \times 10^{-6}
\]

This confirms the calculation. The correct answer is **option E: 0.0000021**.

ANSWER: E
