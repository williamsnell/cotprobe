Okay, so I've got this question about entropy change in a gas. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that the temperature increases from 100 K to 101 K, and the volume is kept constant. I need to find the change in entropy.

Hmm, entropy change for an ideal gas when temperature changes and volume is constant. Wait, wait. The formula for entropy change is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Since the volume is constant, V2/V1 is 1, so the second term drops out. So only the first term matters.

But wait, what's Cv for a gas? Oh right, Cv is the molar specific heat at constant volume. For monatomic gases, Cv is (3/2) R, and for diatomic, it's (5/2) R. But the question doesn't specify the type of gas, so I'm assuming it's any gas, but the change in entropy depends on the Cv.

Wait, the question doesn't specify the type, so maybe it's assuming it's any gas and the change is general. Alternatively, perhaps it's a monatomic gas. Or maybe the question is more about whether the entropy increases or decreases, but the options are positive, so I think it's about the magnitude.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). Since the temperature is increasing, T2 is bigger than T1, so ln(T2/T1) is positive. But wait, for entropy change, when T increases, the entropy should increase, right?

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recheck the formula. The formula is correct: for constant volume, ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). So if T increases, the entropy increases. Hence, the entropy change is positive, and the options are all positive except for option F, but wait no, looking at the options, option B is 0.075, which is positive.

Wait, but wait, the initial options don't have the units, but the question says 'Joule/mole·K'. So the units are correct.

Wait, but I'm not given the specific Cv. Oh wait, maybe this is assuming that it's a monatomic gas. Because if it's monatomic, Cv is (3/2) R. So R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So (3/2) R is about 12.471 J/(mol·K).

Wait, let's calculate that. So if Cv is (3/2) R, then:

ΔS = n * (3/2 R) * ln(101/100) 

But wait, the question is about the change in entropy when the temperature increases. So the formula is correct.

But wait, the problem is that the question doesn't specify the amount of substance. Oh wait, the question gives options in terms of Joule per mole K. So perhaps the calculation is per mole. So n is 1 mole.

So, let's plug in the numbers. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Cv for monatomic is (3/2)*8.314 ≈ 12.471 J/(mol·K).

ln(101/100) is ln(1.01). Let me calculate that. I remember that ln(1.01) is approximately 0.00995, because ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x^3/3 etc. So x=0.01, so ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995.

So ΔS = 1 * 12.471 * 0.00995 ≈ 12.471 * 0.01 ≈ 0.1247 J/(mol·K). Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 0.225, which is higher, option H is 0.001, which is way too low. Option B is 0.075, which is a bit lower. Option D is 0.125, which is close.

Wait, but wait! If the gas is diatomic, let's see. For diatomic, Cv is (5/2) R. So that would be 8.314 * 2.5 = 20.785 J/(mol·K). Then ΔS would be 20.785 * ln(1.01) ≈ 20.785 * 0.00995 ≈ ~0.206 J/(mol·K). That's more than 0.125 (option D) but less than option I (0.225). But wait, the options don't have 0.206. Wait, but the options don't include any exact match. So perhaps the question assumes a monatomic gas.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the entropy change as the integral of (dQ_rev)/T. For an ideal gas, the entropy change when volume is constant is indeed n Cv ln(T2/T1). So the correct formula is used.

But wait, the options given don't include 0.125 (option D) as a choice. Looking at the options, option I is 0.225 and option H is 0.001. But wait, wait! Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me recheck.

Wait, 12.471 J/(mol·K) multiplied by ln(1.01) (approx 0.00995) equals approximately 0.124 J/(mol·K). But none of the options exactly match that. Looking at the options, option I is 0.225, which is higher. Option B is 0.075, which is lower. Option D is 0.125 (close to 0.124), but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Wait, for entropy change when volume is constant, I think the formula is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). But wait, another possibility arises: is it ΔS = n Cv m (T2 - T1) / T, where m is something? No, that's the formula for specific heat at constant volume. Wait, but entropy is a state function, so the integral would depend on the path, but for a reversible process.

Wait another thought: Since the process is at constant volume, it's a reversible process. So the correct formula is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). So let's calculate again.

n is 1 mole, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Cv for monatomic is (3/2 R) = 12.471 J/(mol·K). ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995.

So 12.471 * 0.00995 ≈ 0.124 J/(mol·K). But looking at the options, option D is 0.125 J/(mol·K). Oh wait, that's very close. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but wait! I think I might have confused the formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the molar entropy change, but in some cases, the molar entropy change is (n Cv ln(T2/T1)), but if it's per mole, that's correct.

Wait, but what about the formula for entropy change when temperature changes and volume is constant? No, that's correct. So for 1 mole, the change is 0.125 J/(mol·K), which is option D.

But wait, looking at the options again, option I is 0.225 J/(mol·K), which is bigger. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for Cv. Let's compute 12.471 J/(mol·K) * ln(1.01).

ln(1.01) is about 0.00995.

So 12.471 * 0.00995 ≈ 0.124 J/(mol·K). Which is approximately 0.125, which is option D.

So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the change in entropy of a gas when the temperature increases from 100 K to 101 K at constant volume, we use the formula for entropy change during a reversible process:

\[
\Delta S = n C_v \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( n \) is the number of moles of the gas.
- \( C_v \) is the molar specific heat at constant volume.
- \( T_2 = 101 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_1 = 100 \, \text{K} \).
- The volume is constant, so the second term in the entropy change formula (related to volume) vanishes.

The problem does not specify the type of gas, so the calculation assumes \( C_v = \frac{3}{2}R \) for a monatomic gas, where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \). Substituting these values:

\[
C_v = \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 = 12.471 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}.
\]

The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{101}{100} = 1.01.
\]

The natural logarithm of this ratio is approximately:

\[
\ln(1.01) \approx 0.00995.
\]

Now, calculate the entropy change:

\[
\Delta S = 12.471 \times 0.00995 \approx 0.124 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest match is **0.125 J/(mol·K)**, which corresponds to option D.
