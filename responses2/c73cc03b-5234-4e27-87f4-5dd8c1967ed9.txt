Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the premium for a furniture policy. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking for the premium for a 15-day policy on furniture valued at $1,500, and the annual premium is $1.25 per $100. The options are from A to J, with various dollar amounts.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The annual premium is $1.25 for every $100, so I need to figure out how much that would be for a 15-day period. Since 15 days is less than a year, the premium should be based on a fraction of the annual rate.

So, the policy is for furniture worth $1,500. I think the premium is calculated per unit value, not per day. Let me break it down.

The annual premium is $1.25 per $100. So, for each $100 of value, the premium is $1.25. So, for $1,500, that would be 15 times $100, right? Because 15 * 100 = 1500. So, if each $100 is $1.25, then 15 * 1.25 = ?

Wait, wait, that's maybe a better approach. Multiply the total value by the premium rate per $100. So, 1500 / 100 = 15. So, the premium is 15 times $1.25. Let me calculate that.

15 * $1.25. Hmm, 10 * 1.25 is $12.50, and 5 * 1.25 is $6.25. Adding those together: 12.50 +6.25 = 18.75. So, the total premium is $18.75.

Looking at the options, option H is $5.00, which is too low. Option I is $12.50. Option J is $22.50, which is higher. Option A is $3.75, B is $1.25, C is $15, D is $18.75, E is $2.44, F is $6.25, G is $0.31, etc.

So, D is $18.75, which matches what I got. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The annual premium is given as $1.25 per $100. So, if the policy is for 15 days, then the premium would be proportionally less than a full year.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the premium is calculated on a daily basis or per unit of value. I think the question is implying that the annual rate applies as a flat rate for the duration of the policy. So, for 15 days, the premium would be based on 15/365 of the annual rate.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the annual rate is given, so the premium is based on the value of the policy multiplied by the annual rate. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the annual rate is usually a rate on the policy, not on the value. So, perhaps the way it's worded is that the annual premium is $1.25 per $100, so for any amount, say, X, the premium would be X/100 * $1.25.

So, for $1500, that's 1500/100 = 15 * $1.25 = $18.75. So, yes, that's correct. So the premium is $18.75, which is option D.

The premium for a 15-day policy on a piece of furniture valued at $1,500 is calculated by determining the annual rate per $100 and applying it to the policy's value. Since the annual premium is $1.25 per $100, for $1,500, this is 15 times $1.25, resulting in $18.75. 

Answer: D
