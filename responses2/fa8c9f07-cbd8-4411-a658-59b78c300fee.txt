Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about personality traits and a specific scale called the Internal-External Control Scale. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what the Internal-External Control Scale measures. From what I remember, this scale assesses a person's tendency to rely on their internal factors (internal control) versus external influences. So, someone with high internal control would be more self-reliant, less influenced by others. Conversely, someone with high external control is more dependent on others.

The question is asking which option characterizes someone who scores high on this scale. The options are A to H, each describing a different trait.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: High internality believes success is determined by external factors like fate or luck. That sounds like external control, not internal. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: High internality is dependent and influenced easily. Again, this suggests dependence and ease in being influenced, which is external control. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: High internality is achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks on skills. That fits because high internal control means relying on own abilities, not external forces. So C looks promising.

Option D: High internality is passive, waits for others to solve problems. That's more external control because someone who's passive is influenced by others' actions or the environment. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: High internality is unsuccessful and lacks ambition. This seems like the opposite—high internal control would be successful and have high ambition, not low. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: High internality feels little influence over outcomes. That's exactly what internal control implies. So F is correct.

Option G: High internality prefers tasks on luck rather than skills. Wait, no, high internal control would mean more skill-based tasks because the person relies on their own skills, not luck. So G might be incorrect.

Option H: High internal control leads to blame others for mistakes. That sounds more like external control, where blame is directed at others rather than their own actions. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: High internal control leads to anxiety from uncontrollable events. Again, this is external control because it's about being influenced by others or external factors. So I is incorrect.

So, reviewing the options, options C and F seem correct. But wait, let me recheck.

Wait, option F says a person is "likely to be unsuccessful and lacking in ambition." That contradicts because internal control would imply success and high ambition. So perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is which option correctly characterizes a high internal control.

Option C: High internality is achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks on skills.

That makes sense because if someone has high internal control, they rely on their own skills (tasks on skills) and are not influenced by others. So yes, they are successful and independent.

Option F says high internal control leads to little influence. That's correct. So which option is correct?

The question is asking which options are correct. So, both C and F might be correct, but looking back at the options:

Looking at the options, each is a single statement. So the question is asking to choose which option correctly describes the trait.

So looking back:

Which of the options correctly describe a high internal control.

Option C says: high internal control is achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks on skills. All these points are in line with high internal control.

Option F says: high internal control leads to little influence over outcomes. Also correct.

So the options are A to H, each as a statement; the question is to pick the correct one.

Wait, actually, the question is a single choice, so only one of the options is correct.

Looking again, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice question in which each option is a single statement. So each option is a possible correct answer, but the question is which one is correct.

So, the correct options are C and F. But wait, looking at the options, the phrasing is 'characterize a person who scores high on the scale'—so which option correctly describes that trait.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's meaning.

Option C: High internal control implies that they are successful, independent, and resistant to influence, which is correct.

Option F: High internal control would lead to neglecting external factors, which is correct.

Wait, but the answer is supposed to be among the options, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about each option's implication.

The Internal-External Control Scale measures how much someone relies on their internal factors versus external ones. High internal control would result in:

- Independent (resistant to influence)
- Successful (high achievement)
- Possessing skills (tasks on skills)
- Less likely to be passive, etc.

So, looking at the options:

Option C: That's all correct. So C is correct.

Option F: That's also correct. So F is correct.

Wait, but the question is a single-choice, so perhaps only one is correct. Wait, maybe I've misread the options.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Looking at the options again:

A: High internality believes success is external. Incorrect.

B: High internality is dependent. Incorrect.

C: High internal leads to success, independent, etc. Correct.

D: Passive, etc. Incorrect.

E: Unsuccessful. Incorrect.

F: Little influence. Correct.

G: Prefer tasks on luck. No, high internal control would prefer tasks on skills.

H: blame others. Incorrect.

I: Anxiety. Incorrect.

So, both C and F are correct. But the options are A to H, each as a single statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me see again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because F is correct as well, but perhaps the question is about a single correct option in the given options.

Wait, no, the question is to select the correct option from A to H. So the correct options are C and F. But the question must have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I've overlooked something.

Wait, the question says which option characterizes a person who scores high on the scale. So all options are statements about that trait.

So, all the options are correct except perhaps one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating F. Option F says, "likely to be unsuccessful and lacking in ambition." That's the opposite of high internal control, which implies high ambition. So F is incorrect.

So, going back to the correct options:

Option C is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the correct answer could be either C or F.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C. Because F is correct as well.
Wait, but the options are presented as separate statements, each as a possible correct answer.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice question, so only one of the options is correct. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, let me think about each statement.

Option C: High internal control implies achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks on skills. All correct.

Option F: High internal control implies little influence, which is correct.

So which of these is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is about the trait of high internal control. So all options except perhaps one are correct. But the options are presented as statements, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each option describes.

The correct trait is high internal control. So, which of the options correctly describes this trait?

Option C says that high internal control leads to being successful, independent, etc. That's correct.

Option F says high internal control would lead to little influence. That's correct as well.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both C and F, but since the options are presented as separate, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating F.

Wait, no. Wait, high internal control implies that they are not influenced by others. So F is correct.

Wait, but the question is a single-choice, so perhaps only one option is correct. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the correct answer is C because F is correct as well, but perhaps the question is about a single trait.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of each option in terms of the scale.

The Internal-External Control Scale assesses how much someone relies on their own (internal) factors. High internal implies less external.

So, the options that describe high internal control would include:

- Independent (resistant to influence): F is correct.

- Successful (achieved): C is correct.

- Possess skills (tasks on skills): C is correct.

So, both F and C are correct. But since the options are presented as single statements, perhaps the answer is C because it's more directly about the trait.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's a direct description of the trait.

Wait, but the question is to select the correct option. So perhaps I should choose the one that best describes the trait.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, as it accurately describes the trait.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct as well.
Wait, but looking at the options, the question is about which of the five answer options correctly describes the trait.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option C says: ... is likely to be achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks on skills.

That fits with high internal control.

Option F says: ... feels little influence over outcomes.

That also fits.

So, both C and F are correct statements, but the options are presented as separate choices.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C because F is correct as well, but perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's a direct description of the trait.

Wait, no, because both C and F are correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C because it's a more general description of the trait.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's a direct description.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.

The Internal-External Control Scale is about how much someone relies on internal factors. So, high internal control implies:

- Independent (resistant to influence)
- Successful (achieved)
- Possessing skills (tasks on skills)
- Less influenced by others.

So option C mentions all these points.

Option F says they are "likely to be unsuccessful and lacking in ambition." That's the opposite, so F is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is C, because it accurately describes high internal control.

Wait, but the options are presented as single statements, so the correct answer is option C.

So, the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

The Internal-External Control Scale measures a person's reliance on internal versus external factors. High internal control implies independence, success, skillfulness, resistance to influence, and neglect of external factors. 

To determine the correct answer:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as high internal control involves internal reliability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it describes dependence, which is external control.
- **Option C**: Correct. High internal control implies achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefers tasks on skills.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it suggests passive waiting, which is external control.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as it describes unsuccessful outcomes, opposite of high internal control.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it describes negative influence, opposite of high internal control.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it prefers tasks on luck, contrary to skill-based outcomes.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as it describes blame, opposite of resistance to influence.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it describes anxiety, opposite of successful outcomes.

The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately describes the traits associated with high internal control.
