Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given elements is a metal. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about the periodic table. Metals are elements that are typically shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and they're usually hard and malleable. They're also usually found in Earth's crust, like in alloys or as elements in the human body.

Looking at the options given:

A: Ne – that's neon. I remember neon is a noble gas. Noble gases are usually unreactive, so they're not metals. They're found in the Earth's crust too, but they're just gases.

B: N – nitrogen. Nitrogen is another noble gas. It's very light, but not reactive as a metal. Plus, it's a colorless gas and exists in various forms.

C: S – sulfur. Sulfur is a non-metal. It's a solid at room temperature and is used in making sulfuric acid. It's a halogen, so not a metal.

D: I – iodine. Iodine is another halogen, which means it's non-metallic. It's a yellow solid and used in biologicals and pharmaceuticals.

E: F – fluorine. Fluorine is a non-metal too, a main group element. It's a yellow gas and has low melting points. Not a metal.

F: Se – selenium. Selenium is a non-metal. It's a yellow solid and has a melting point around 221°C. It's used in electronics and as a component in some pesticides.

G: Ga – gallium. Gallium is a transition metal. Transition metals are a group in the d-block of the periodic table. They're known for their melting points, conductivity, and use in semiconductors. So Ga is definitely a metal.

H: O – oxygen. Oxygen is a non-metal, a diatomic gas. It's used in fuels (like in fuel cells) and in various chemical reactions. It's not a metal.

I: He – helium. Helium is a noble gas and a light gas. It's a monatomic gas and used in balloons and as a coolant. Not a metal.

J: H – hydrogen. Hydrogen is a light gas and a noble gas. It's unique as it's the most abundant element on Earth and is a metalloid, but hydrogen isn't classified as a metal here. It's also found in liquid form in some stars and as a plasma in the Sun.

So, from the options, only gallium (G) is a metal. The others are either non-metals or noble gases.

The correct answer is G: Ga, which is a transition metal and therefore classified as a metal.

Answer: G
