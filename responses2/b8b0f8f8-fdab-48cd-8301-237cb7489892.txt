Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the symbol for antimony. Let me think about what I remember. Antimony is a metal, right? And I think its symbol is something with S in it. Let me see the options.

The options are A to J. Let's list them out quickly. A is Am, which I think is for Argon. B is As, which I believe is Antimony. C is Ab, maybe for Argon or another element. D is Au, which is Gold. E is Fe, that's Iron. F is Ag, which is Silver. G is An, probably Argon again. H is At, which is Argon or another element. I is W, Iodine? Wait, no, Iodine is I. W is actually Wolfram, which is a heavy element. J is Sb, which sounds like antimony.

Wait, wasn't the symbol for antimony "Sb"? So option J is Sb. Let me double-check. Antimony comes from the Greek letter "S". So the symbol starts with S. Then the next letter is 'b'â€”yes, Sb. So the correct symbol is J.

The correct symbol for antimony is **J**, which corresponds to option J.
