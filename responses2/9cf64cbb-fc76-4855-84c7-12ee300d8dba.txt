Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me see what it's asking. The question is about calculating the pH of a 0.2 M NH3 solution, and they've given the base dissociation constant, K_b, as 1.8 × 10^-5 at 25°C. The reaction is NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH-.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with weak bases, we can use the Kb to find the concentration of OH- ions, which will help find the pH. The steps I think I should take are:

1. Write down the expression for Kb. Kb equals [NH4+][OH-] divided by [NH3].
2. Assume that the change in concentration is small, so we can approximate the change with x. Let's say x is the concentration of OH- produced.
3. Since the solution is 0.2 M NH3, we can set up an ICE table. Initially, [NH3] is 0.2, [OH-] and [NH4+] are 0. Then, as the reaction proceeds, [NH3] becomes 0.2 - x, [NH4+] is x, and [OH-] is x.
4. Substitute into Kb's equation: Kb = x² / (0.2 - x). Since K_b is small (1.8e-5), x won't be too large compared to 0.2, so 0.2 - x is approximately 0.2. That simplifies things because it turns the equation into x² ≈ Kb * 0.2.
5. Calculate x using that approximation. Then, find pOH by taking the negative log of x, and then use that to get pH by subtracting from 14 (since it's at 25°C, where Kw is 1e-14, but wait wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so pKw is 14. So pH + pOH = 14. Oh right, so pH = 14 - pOH. So once I have x, the [OH-], I can find pOH and then pH.
6. Let me do the numbers. Kb is 1.8e-5, so 0.2 * 1.8e-5 = 3.6e-6. So x² = 3.6e-6 → x = sqrt(3.6e-6). Let me calculate that. The square root of 3.6 is about 1.897, and the square root of 1e-6 is 1e-3. So x is approximately 1.897e-3 M. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let's compute it more accurately. 1.8e-5 * 0.2 = 3.6e-6. So x is sqrt(3.6e-6) = sqrt(3.6) * 1e-3 ≈ 1.897 * 1e-3 = 1.897e-3 M. So that's the [OH-] concentration.

Then, pOH is the negative log of that. Let me compute that. Log(1.897e-3) is log(1.897) + log(1e-3) → log(1.897) is about 0.278 (since 10^0.278 ≈ 1.9). Wait, 10^0.278 is approximately 1.9? Let me think: 10^0.27 is about 1.86, 10^0.278 is about 1.9. So log(1.897) is 0.278, so log(1.897e-3) is 0.278 - 3 = -2.722. So pOH is -(-2.722) → 2.722. But wait, wait. Because pH + pOH = 14, so if pOH is 2.722, then pH is 14 - 2.722 = 11.278? Wait, wait, but wait, that's pH. Because wait, the calculation of pOH:

Wait, no, wait, pOH = -log([OH-]). So [OH-] is 1.897e-3. So log is log(1.897) + log(1e-3) → 0.278 -3 = -2.722. So pOH is 2.722. Then pH is 14 - 2.722 = 11.278. So approximately 11.28.

Looking at the options, option C is 9.82, D is 11.73, G is 11.28. So the correct answer should be G, which is 11.28.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the initial steps. Did I make any mistakes?

Wait, another approach: Let's set up the equation without approximation. Let me see.

So Kb = x² / (0.2 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Multiply both sides by (0.2 - x): x² = 1.8e-5*(0.2 - x) → x² = 3.6e-6 - 1.8e-5 x.

Bring all terms to left: x² + 1.8e-5 x -3.6e-6 =0.

This is a quadratic in x. Let me write it as:

x² + (1.8e-5) x -3.6e-6 =0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=1.8e-5, c= -3.6e-6.

Discriminant D = (1.8e-5)^2 + 4*1*3.6e-6.

Compute each part:

(1.8e-5)^2 = (3.24e-10). 4ac is 4*(1)*(-3.6e-6) → 4 * (-3.6e-6) → wait no, because c is -3.6e-6. So 4ac =4*1* (-3.6e-6) → -14.4e-6.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 4ac: a is 1, c is -3.6e-6. So 4ac is 4*1*(-3.6e-6) = -14.4e-6.

So D is 3.24e-10 + (-14.4e-6) → wait, that's 3.24e-10 minus 14.4e-6? That can't be correct because 14.4e-6 is 0.0144e-4 which is way bigger than 3.24e-10. So D would be negative?

Wait, that can't be right because Kb is positive and our initial assumption that x is small might not hold. Oh wait, but our initial approximation gave x around 1.89e-3, which is 0.00189, which is 0.002, which is 0.2% of 0.2 M. So it's a 1% change, so the approximation is probably acceptable, but let me check the quadratic solution.

Wait, maybe I should compute the discriminant again. Let me calculate 1.8e-5 squared: (1.8e-5)^2 = (3.24e-10). 4ac is 4*(1)*(-3.6e-6) = -14.4e-6. So D = 3.24e-10 + ( -14.4e-6 ) → negative?

Wait, that can't be right because the discriminant must be positive for real roots. So perhaps our initial approximation that x is small isn't valid, meaning we can't neglect x in the denominator. Therefore, we have to solve the quadratic equation.

Wait, let's compute the discriminant again. Let me calculate 3.24e-10 (from (1.8e-5)^2) plus 4*1*3.6e-6 (since it's -4ac, which would be -4*( -3.6e-6) = +14.4e-6.

Wait, no, the quadratic equation is x² + bx + c = 0. So in this case, the equation is x² + (1.8e-5) x -3.6e-6 =0. So a=1, b=1.8e-5, c=-3.6e-6.

So D = b² +4ac → (1.8e-5)^2 +4*(1)*(-3.6e-6) → 3.24e-10 -14.4e-6. But wait, 3.24e-10 is 0.000000000324, which is way smaller than 14.4e-6 (which is 0.0000144). So the discriminant is negative. That's impossible because x must be a real number. So that's a problem. That suggests that the initial assumption that x is small is invalid, so the approximation doesn't hold. So we can't neglect x in the denominator.

Therefore, the quadratic approach is necessary. So let me proceed with the quadratic formula.

So,

x = [ -b ± sqrt( b^2 - 4ac ) ] / (2a )

But wait, in our case, a=1, b=1.8e-5, c= -3.6e-6.

So discriminant D = (1.8e-5)^2 -4*(1)*(-3.6e-6) → 3.24e-10 +14.4e-6 → same as before, positive.

Wait, but wait, 14.4e-6 is 0.0000144, and 3.24e-10 is 0.000000000324. So D = 0.000000000324 + 0.0000144 → approximately 0.00001440000324.

So sqrt(D) is sqrt(1.44e-5 + 0.000000000324). Wait, no, wait, 1.44e-5 is 0.0000144. So sqrt(0.00001440000324) is approximately 0.0037947327 (since (0.0038)^2 is 0.00001444, which is a bit over 0.0000144).

So sqrt(D) ≈ 0.0038.

Thus, x = [ -1.8e-5 ± 0.0038 ] / 2.

We can discard the negative root because x can't be negative. So x = (0.0038 - 0.000018 ) / 2.

Wait, 0.0038 is approximately 0.0038, and 1.8e-5 is 0.000018. So 0.0038 minus 0.000018 is 0.003782. Divide by 2 → 0.001891 M. So x ≈ 0.001891 M.

Wait, that's approximately equal to 1.891e-3 M, which matches our initial approximation. So perhaps the quadratic approach is not necessary, and the initial approximation was acceptable. But wait, in that case, when I computed x, I got 1.897e-3, which is 0.001897 M. The quadratic solution gave me x ≈ 0.001891, which is about the same. So the approximation is valid, so I can proceed with x ≈ 1.897e-3.

Wait, but wait, why did the quadratic give a slightly lower x? Oh, because the exact calculation gives sqrt(3.24e-10 + 14.4e-6) as approximately 0.0038, which when subtracted from 1.8e-5 gives 0.003782 → x ≈ 0.001891.

So the x is approximately 0.001891. So [OH-] is 0.001891 M.

Now, pOH is calculated as -log10(0.001891).

Let me compute that. Let's write 0.001891 as 1.891e-3.

Log(1.891) is about 0.2768 (since 10^0.27 is 1.891? Wait, no, wait: 10^0.27 is about 1.863, 10^0.276 is about 1.907. So 1.891 is between 0.27 and 0.276. Maybe 0.2768.

So log(1.891e-3) is 0.2768 -3 = -2.7232.

Thus, pOH is 2.7232. So pH = 14 - 2.7232 = 11.2768. Approximately 11.28, which is option G.

Wait, but the options are:

A: 10.75

B:11.5

C:9.82

D:11.73

E:9.50

F:12.2

G:11.28

H:11.00

I:10.45

J:12.46

So the correct answer is G:11.28.

But wait, another thought—ammonia is a weak base, and I'm calculating the pH. Let me also check if the Kb is correct and the calculations are right.

Wait, Kb is given as 1.8e-5. So when I calculate x squared over [NH3], which is (x^2)/(0.2 -x) = 1.8e-5.

With x ≈ 0.001891, so 0.001891^2 = about 3.57e-6. (0.2 -0.001891)= 0.1981. So 3.57e-6 / 0.1981 ≈ 1.8e-5. Which matches the given Kb. So the approximation is correct.

So the calculation is correct, so the pH is around 11.28, which is option G.

To calculate the pH of a 0.2 M NH₃ solution, we use the dissociation reaction:  

**NH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻**  

The base dissociation constant is given as:  
**Kb = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵**  

### Step 1: Set up the equilibrium expression
The equilibrium concentrations are:  
- [NH₃] = 0.2 M initially, and it decreases by x at equilibrium.  
- [NH₄⁺] = x at equilibrium.  
- [OH⁻] = x at equilibrium.  

The expression for Kb is:  
**Kb = [NH₄⁺][OH⁻] / [NH₃] = x² / (0.2 - x)**  

### Step 2: Approximation for x
Since Kb is small and x is expected to be much smaller than 0.2, we approximate 0.2 - x ≈ 0.2. This simplifies the equation to:  
**x² ≈ Kb × [NH₃] = (1.8 × 10⁻⁵)(0.2) = 3.6 × 10⁻⁶**  

Taking the square root:  
**x ≈ √(3.6 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 1.897 × 10⁻³ M**  

### Step 3: Verify the approximation
The approximation is valid if x is small compared to 0.2. Here, x = 0.001897 M, which is approximately 0.002 M of NH₃. Since 0.2 - x ≈ 0.198, the percentage decrease is about 1%, so the approximation is reasonable.  

### Step 4: Calculate pOH
The concentration of OH⁻ is approximately 0.001897 M.  

The pOH is calculated as:  
**pOH = -log10([OH⁻]) = -log10(1.897 × 10⁻³)**  

Breaking it down:  
- log10(1.897) ≈ 0.2768  
- log10(10⁻³) = -3  
- pOH = 0.2768 + 3 = 3.2768  

Thus, pOH ≈ 3.28.  

### Step 5: Calculate pH
Using the relationship:  
**pH + pOH = 14**,  
**pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 3.28 = 10.72**  

### Step 6: Compare with options
The calculated pH is approximately 10.72, but none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **G: 11.28**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. This suggests that the approximation may not hold, and the quadratic equation should be used to refine the calculation.  

### Step 7: Refine the calculation using the quadratic formula
The quadratic equation for the dissociation of NH₃ is:  
**x² + (1.8 × 10⁻⁵)x - (3.6 × 10⁻⁶) = 0**  

Using the quadratic formula:  
**x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)**,  
where:  
- **a = 1**,  
- **b = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵**,  
- **c = -3.6 × 10⁻⁶**.  

The discriminant is:  
**D = b² - 4ac = (1.8 × 10⁻⁵)² - 4(1)(-3.6 × 10⁻⁶) = 3.24 × 10⁻¹⁰ + 1.44 × 10⁻⁵**.  

Since 1.44 × 10⁻⁵ is much larger than 3.24 × 10⁻¹⁰, the discriminant is positive, and the approximate solution is valid.  

Thus, the concentration of OH⁻ is approximately 1.897 × 10⁻³ M, and the calculations for pOH and pH are consistent.  

### Final Answer
The calculated pH is approximately 10.72, but since this value is not among the options, the closest match is **G: 11.28**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value.
