Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. Keri spent 3 hours on her homework, and she spent equal amounts of time on each subject. She spent 1/2 hour on science. The question is, how many subjects did she study? The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 2 to 12.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, she spent a total of 3 hours on homework. She divided this time equally among all the subjects she studied. Now, specifically, she spent half an hour on science. Since she spent equal time on each subject, the time she spent on each subject is the same.

So, if she spent 1/2 hour on science, and that's one of the subjects, then each subject took her 1/2 an hour. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because if she spent equal time on each subject, including science, then all subjects took the same amount of time. So, each subject took 1/2 hour.

Wait, but the question is, how many subjects did she study? So if each subject took 1/2 hour, and the total time is 3 hours, then the number of subjects would be total time divided by time per subject. So 3 hours divided by 0.5 hours per subject.

Let me calculate that. 3 divided by 0.5. Well, 0.5 is the same as 1/2, so dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2. So 3 times 2 is 6. So that's 6 subjects. So the answer should be G, which is 6 subjects.

Wait, but let me check that again because sometimes there's a trick. The problem says she spent 1/2 hour on science, but does that mean that science is one of the subjects? I think it does. So each subject, including science, took 1/2 hour. So if each of the 'x' subjects took 1/2 hour, then the total time is x * (1/2) = 3. Solving for x gives x = 3 / (1/2) = 6. So yes, 6 subjects.

To determine how many subjects Keri studied, we'll use the given information: she spent 3 hours total, with equal time on each subject, and spent 1/2 hour on science. Since all subjects took the same time, we can divide the total time by the time per subject. Each subject took 1/2 hour, so the number of subjects is 3 รท (1/2) = 6. The correct answer is G, 6 subjects.

Answer: G
