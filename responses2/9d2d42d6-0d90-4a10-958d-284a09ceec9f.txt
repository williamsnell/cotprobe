Okay, so I've got this question about government establishing a price floor. Hmm, I remember that a price floor is like setting a minimum price that sellers can charge for a product. But wait, how does that affect the market?

Let me think. When a price floor is set, it's like creating a ceiling on what the seller can charge. So, if the market without the floor has a surplus, the government steps in to prevent that. A surplus is when there's more of the product available than buyers want, right? So if the price is too low, sellers don't make enough to cover the demand.

So, the options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

A: eliminate a surplus. Wait, if the price floor is set above the equilibrium, then the surplus would be eliminated because the price is higher than what buyers are willing to pay, so supply doesn't fall as much. But wait, the question is about the government's reason for setting a price floor. They probably want to protect consumers, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

B: protect consumers from price hikes. That makes sense because price floors are intended to prevent prices from going up above the floor. So consumers pay more, which is better for them.

C: increase government revenue. Well, if the price floor is set higher, the government can collect more revenue from the sellers, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason. It might be a secondary effect.

D: eliminate a shortage. A shortage is when supply exceeds demand. If the price is too high, supply might decrease, but if the floor is set, perhaps the shortage is already reduced. Or maybe the price floor can't eliminate the shortage if the market isn't in equilibrium. Wait, no, the price floor would prevent sellers from charging higher than the floor, so if the price is set above the equilibrium, supply might decrease, reducing the shortage. But I'm not certain if this is the main purpose.

E: help buyers. Again, buyers pay higher, so that's a benefit. But the question is about the government's reason, so maybe B is more important.

F: promote competition among sellers. I don't think so. A price floor can sometimes encourage competition because it gives sellers a minimum, but in the case of a price floor, it might not necessarily promote competition. It depends on the implementation. Also, if the market is naturally competitive, the government may not want to enforce a price floor.

G: help sellers. No, because sellers are usually limited by the price floor. They can't charge more than what the floor sets, so it's more about preventing price increases than helping sellers.

H: control inflation. Setting a price floor doesn't directly control inflation. Inflation is more about price increases that are too volatile, not just a fixed floor.

I: discourage consumption. If the price is too low, it discourages buying. But the main purpose is usually to protect consumers, not discourage consumption.

J: reduce production cost. No, that's about cost minimization, not a policy to set a price floor.

So, the primary reason for a price floor is to protect consumers from price hikes, which is option B. The other options seem to be secondary effects or incorrect purposes.

The correct answer is **B: protect consumers from price hikes**. A price floor is primarily set to prevent sellers from charging above the floor, which helps consumers pay a fairer price. This addresses the need to protect consumers from higher-than-expected prices, making option B the correct choice.

Answer: B
