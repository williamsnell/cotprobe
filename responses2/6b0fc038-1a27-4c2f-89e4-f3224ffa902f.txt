Okay, so I need to answer this question about social development during adolescence. Let me think about what I know. Adolescence is a crucial time for a lot of people. I remember that kids are starting to form their identities and interact with the world around them.

The options are A through J, each describing different aspects of social development. Let me go through each one to see which fits best.

Option A: Lesser focus on self-discovery and role experimentation. I think during adolescence, people are more into figuring out their own identity and trying different roles. So maybe this is correct.

Option B: Increased social isolation and withdrawal. Hmm, I thought that as kids get older, they might feel more connected, but isolation could also happen. Maybe not the best fit.

Option C: More reliance on parents. I don't think this is right because parents are still there, but more so than peers. Adolescents might have more autonomy.

Option D: Decreased interest in establishing an identity. Wait, does identity decrease? I think identity is more significant, so D might not be correct.

Option E: Increased independence from peers. That sounds right. Adolescents are more self-reliant, less dependent on others.

Option F: Heightened parental influence and reduced peer interaction. This makes sense because parents are still around but more so than peers. So F could be a contender.

Option G: Reduced importance of peer acceptance. I'm not sure about this. Maybe it's the opposite because social skills develop more, so maybe G is incorrect.

Option H: Focus on academic success. Probably not, because social skills and relationships are more important.

Option I: Decreased ability to form close relationships. I've heard that as kids get older, they can form more complex relationships, so maybe this is incorrect.

Option J: Increased importance of social skills, less reliance on parents, and more reliance on peers. This seems to fit with what I know because adolescence is about exploring social aspects, and parents are less involved compared to peers.

So putting it together, the main points are that during adolescence, there's more self-discovery and role experimentation, less isolation, more independence, and a shift in how people interact with peers and parents. 

Looking at the options again, option E says increased independence from peers. That's correct because they are more self-reliant. Option J also includes the same idea but adds social skills and less reliance on parents. So J seems to encompass both aspects.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is about tracing social development, so looking for what is happening in terms of social relationships and how they change. I think both E and J are correct in their points but maybe J is a broader statement.

Alternatively, option E is more specific about independence, while J talks about social skills and less reliance on parents. So which is more accurate?

Wait, another angle: during adolescence, the focus shifts from being dependent on peers to being more self-reliant. So both E and J are parts of that. But I think option J is more comprehensive, describing not just independence but also social skills and parent influence.

So the correct answer should be J: increased importance of social skills, less reliance on parents, and more reliance on peers.

The correct answer is J: increased importance of social skills, less reliance on parents, and more reliance on peers. Adolescence marks a significant shift where individuals become more self-reliant, with social skills developing and the influence of peers diminishing. This reflects a change in how social interactions are perceived and practiced.

Answer: J
