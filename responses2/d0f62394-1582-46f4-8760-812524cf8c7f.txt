Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Hobbes' definition of injustice. Hmm, let me think. I remember that John Hobbes was a philosopher, right? He's famous for his work "Leviathan," which discusses the moral philosophy of a society where everyone is bound by contract and has the right to act in accordance with their duties. 

In his work, Hobbes talks about how people should act according to the law, not just their own self-interest. He also talked about the "rule of law." So, if Hobbes is talking about injustice, that's probably related to violating the rules or the law. 

Looking at the options: A is failure to abide by a contract. B is disregard for societal norms. C is acting against others' welfare. D is disobedience to parental authority. E is disobedience to God's law. F is acting against self-interest. G is failure to follow the rule of law. H is failure to respect inherent rights. I is failure to uphold moral duties. J is disobedience to a sovereign.

So, Hobbes didn't emphasize individual self-interest because he believed in the rule of law. So, when someone violates the law, that's an injustice. Let's see, which options say "violation of law"? 

Option G says "failure to follow the rule of law"â€”so that fits. Option I is about moral duties, which I think is a more general concept. Hobbes would argue that actions done in violation of the law are just as wrong as actions that violate human rights. So, the specific term for the law is G. 

Alternatively, option C is acting against others' welfare. That's more about the harm done to others, but Hobbes didn't focus on that as much. Hobbes probably thought that the rule of law itself is the primary standard. 

Wait, another thought: Hobbes didn't talk much about self-interest or self-love. He's more concerned with the state of the individual and how they should act in accordance with the law. So, the answer should be G: failure to follow the rule of law.
