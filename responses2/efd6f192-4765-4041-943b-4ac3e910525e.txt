Okay, so I've got this question about the money supply and banking. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the immediate effect on the money supply when Bank A receives a $1000 deposit from Mr. X and grants a $500 loan to Mr. Y. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll try to break it down.

Wait, the money supply refers to the total amount of money in circulation or in banks' reserves. Right. So when a bank receives a deposit, it's adding that money into the system. But wait, when a bank makes a loan, that money is lent out and doesn't necessarily go directly into the money supply. Oh wait, but that's only part of the picture.

So, when Bank A receives a $1000 deposit, that $1000 becomes part of the monetary base. So the money supply increases by $1000. But then, the bank gives a $500 loan to Mr. Y. Now, where does that $500 go? It's lent out, so that money is in circulation. But wait, the bank's reserves increase by $500 because it's lending $500. So the bank's reserves go up, which means that the money supply would decrease because the $500 is now in the bank's reserves instead of in circulation.

Wait, hold on. No, because the money supply includes all the money that's in circulation and all the reserves banks hold. But when a bank makes a loan, the $500 is no longer in the bank's reserves but is in circulation. So the money supply doesn't decrease because the $500 was part of the money supply before but is now in the reserves. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the money supply includes both the money that's in circulation and the reserves. So when the bank holds $500 as reserves, that's a reduction in the money supply. But the $500 is lent out, so it's in circulation. So the total money supply remains the same. Because the $500 that was in the bank's reserves is now gone, but the $500 that was lent is now in circulation. So the total money supply stays the same.

Wait, but wait. Another perspective: the money supply is the total money in the economy. When a bank receives a deposit of $1000 from Mr. X, that's $1000 added to the money supply. Then, they lend $500. That $500 is no longer in the bank's reserves, so the money supply increases by $500 because the $500 is now in circulation. But wait, the $1000 was received, which was part of the money supply. So the total increases by $500.

Wait, that's what the question is asking. If the bank holds $500 as deposits, making it a seller of money, then the $500 is no longer in the bank's reserves but is in the money supply. So the money supply increases by $500.

Wait, let me clarify. The initial deposit is $1000. That's added to the money supply. Then, the bank lends out $500, so that goes into the money supply again. So the money supply goes up by $500 because the bank's reserves decrease by $500 but the money supply (which includes both the money in circulation and the reserves) remains the same.

Wait, no. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let's think step by step.

1. Bank A receives a deposit of $1000 from Mr. X. This $1000 is added to the money supply. So the money supply increases by $1000.

2. Then, the bank makes a $500 loan to Mr. Y. So the $500 goes into circulation, meaning it's added to the money supply. So the money supply increases by another $500. So total increase would be $1500? But wait, that's not right because the $500 is lent out, so the bank's reserves went down by $500, but the money supply would have increased by $500. So the total money supply is $1000 (from the deposit) plus $500 (from the loan) = $1500? Or is it that the $500 is in the money supply, so the money supply increases by $500.

Alternatively, another way to think: when the bank makes a loan, the money supply increases because the $500 is now in the economy, but the $500 was already part of the money supply when the $1000 was received. So the overall change is that the money supply increases by $500 because the bank's reserves went down by $500, but the money supply (including the $500) remains the same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of it this way. The $1000 is added to the money supply. Then, the $500 is lent out, so it's in the money supply. So the money supply increases by $500 because the $500 is now part of it. So the total increase is $500.

Wait, but the question is about the immediate effect. So when the $1000 is received, that's an addition to the money supply. Then, the $500 is lent out, which is an addition to the money supply as well. So the money supply increases by $500 over the two steps.

Wait, no. Because the $1000 is in the money supply, and the $500 is also in the money supply. So the total increase is $1500? No, that can't be right because the $500 was already in the money supply when the $1000 was received. So the first deposit adds $1000. Then, the $500 loan adds another $500, so the total is $1500. But that doesn't make sense because the $500 is now in the bank's reserves, so the total money supply increases by $500.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the monetary base. The monetary base is the sum of physical currency in circulation plus bank reserves. So when the bank receives $1000, that's added to the monetary base. Then, the $500 loan is lent out, which is taken from the monetary base and goes into the money supply (as it's now in circulation). So the money supply increases by $500 because that $500 is now in the economy.

Wait, so the initial deposit adds $1000 to the monetary base. Then, the $500 loan is taken out of the monetary base (so the monetary base decreases by $500) and is added to the money supply. So overall, the money supply increases by $500.

Wait, but the question is about the immediate effect on the money supply. So the immediate effect is that the $500 is now in the money supply, so the money supply increases by $500.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Because when the bank makes a loan, the $500 that's lent is now in circulation, so the total money supply goes up by $500. But the $1000 that was deposited was also part of the money supply, so the net effect is an increase of $500. Or is it that the $1000 was in the MD, and the $500 is now in the MD as well, so the total MD is up by $500.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the $1000 is in the MD, and the $500 is now in the MD as well, so the MD increases by $500. So the answer is option B: add $500 to the money supply.

But wait, another angle: when a bank makes a loan, it's taking from the monetary base (which is the MD) and adding it to the money supply. So for the MD, the $1000 is part of it. The $500 loan is taken out of the MD, so the MD decreases by $500. But the $500 is added to the money supply, so the money supply increases by $500.

So the immediate effect is that the money supply increases by $500. So the answer is option B.

When Bank A receives a deposit of $1000 from Mr. X, this $1000 is added to the monetary base (the sum of currency in circulation and bank reserves). As a result, the money supply increases by $1000. Subsequently, Bank A grants a $500 loan to Mr. Y, which means the $500 is lent out and is no longer held by the bank as a deposit but is now in circulation. This action increases the money supply by an additional $500, as the $500 is now part of the monetary base. Therefore, the immediate effect on the money supply is an increase of $500.
