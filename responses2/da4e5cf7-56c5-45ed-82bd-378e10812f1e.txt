Okay, so I need to find the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts and express it as a fraction in its simplest form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that cups and quarts are both units of volume, but they're different. I think I should convert them to the same unit to make the ratio easier. I'm pretty sure that 1 quart is equal to 4 cups. Yeah, that sounds right because a quart is a larger unit than a cup. So, since the question is about cups and quarts, I should convert quarts to cups.

So, there are 3 quarts, and each quart is 4 cups, so 3 quarts times 4 cups per quart. Let me calculate that: 3 * 4 = 12 cups. So, 3 quarts equal 12 cups.

Now, the ratio is 2 cups to 3 quarts, which is the same as 2 cups to 12 cups. So, the ratio can be written as 2/12. But wait, that's not in its simplest form yet. I need to simplify this fraction.

To simplify 2/12, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 and 12. The GCD of 2 and 12 is 2 because 2 is the largest number that divides both without a remainder. 

So, I divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2. That gives me 2 divided by 2 equals 1, and 12 divided by 2 equals 6. So, the simplified fraction is 1/6.

Wait, but let's double-check. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me think again. The ratio is 2 cups to 3 quarts. I converted quarts to cups and got 12 cups. So 2:12 becomes 1:6, which as a fraction is 1/6. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, let's see what each option is. Option D is 2/1, which is 2. That's the original ratio before simplifying. Option H is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3. Option B is 3/2, which is 1.5. Option D is 1/6. Let me check if I made a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, another approach: since 1 quart is 4 cups, 3 quarts is 12 cups. So the ratio is 2 cups to 12 cups, which is 2/12. Simplifying that gives 1/6. So the correct ratio as a fraction in simplest form is 1/6, which is option D.

Alternatively, if I consider that quarts and cups are different, but maybe the question expects the ratio to be in terms of the same unit. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the units. Let me see: the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you've chosen." Oh, wait, I should just focus on the problem.

Another thought: maybe I should convert cups to quarts instead. Since 1 quart is 4 cups, then 1 cup is 1/4 quart. So, 2 cups would be 2*(1/4) quarts, which is 0.5 quarts. So, the ratio is 0.5 quarts to 3 quarts. That's 0.5/3, which is the same as (1/2)/3 = 1/(2*3) = 1/6. So same result.

So, yes, the ratio as a fraction is 1/6, which is option D.

The ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts, after converting quarts to cups (3 quarts = 12 cups), becomes 2:12, which simplifies to 1/6. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Answer: D
