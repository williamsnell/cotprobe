Question:

What is a One-to-One Assembler?

Options:

A: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of a machine word into an assembler language program
B: A One-to-One assembler translates two lines of an assembler language program into two machine words during assembly
C: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into multiple machine words
D: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into one machine word during assembly
E: A One-to-One assembler translates each machine word into multiple lines of an assembler language program
F: A One-to-One assembler requires manual intervention for each line of assembly to machine code translation
G: A One-to-One assembler compiles entire assembler language programs into a single executable machine word
H: A One-to-One assembler generates one line of machine code for every two lines of assembler language program
I: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into a corresponding line in a high-level programming language
J: A One-to-One assembler translates multiple lines of an assembler language program into a single machine word

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a One-to-One Assembler. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my assembler and machine code, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what a One-to-One Assembler does. I remember that in assembly languages, the assembler takes a program in assembly and translates it into machine code. But wait, what's the difference between a Two-to-One and a One-to-One assembler?

Oh right, a Two-to-One assembler takes assembly code and generates two machine words per line, right? Like, each instruction in the assembly is turned into two hex bytes or something. But a One-to-One does the opposite. It takes a machine word and turns it into a single line in the assembler, or vice versa?

Wait, no. Wait. Let me think again. Assemblers can be divided into two types: Two-to-One and One-to-One. The Two-to-One takes one machine word and produces two lines of assembler, whereas the One-to-One does the reverse. So the One-to-One assembler would take two lines of assembler and produce one machine word, right?

Looking at the options, option D says: "A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into one machine word during assembly." That makes sense because it's converting two lines into one. So during assembly, each line is processed into a machine word.

Another point: option E says it translates each machine word into multiple lines of assembler. That's opposite of what D says. So E would be a Two-to-One assembler.

So the correct answer should be option D. Let me check the other options to ensure I'm not missing anything.

Option A talks about translating each line into assembler, but that's more like Two-to-One. So A is wrong.

Option B is about translating two lines into two machine words, which again is Two-to-One. So B is incorrect.

Option C says each line is translated into multiple machine words, which is the opposite of One-to-One. So C is the opposite, not D.

Option F says each line requires manual intervention. That's more like a pre-processor, which isn't part of the assembler's normal function. So F is incorrect.

Option G mentions compiling entire programs into a single executable. That's more of a compiler role, not an assembler. So G is incorrect.

Option H states each line produces one machine word, which aligns with D.

Option I says each line in assembler is translated into a machine code line. That would be Two-to-One, so I is incorrect.

Option J says multiple lines become one, which is Two-to-One.

So the only correct answer is D. I think I've got it.

The correct answer is D: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into one machine word during assembly.

Answer: D
