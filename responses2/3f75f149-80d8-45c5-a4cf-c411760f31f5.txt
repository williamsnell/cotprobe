Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the cosets of the subgroup 4Z in 2Z. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that a subgroup H of a group G is a subset such that when you combine any two elements in H, you stay within H, and the same rules apply for inverses. The group here is probably the integers under addition, right? So G is Z, and H is 4Z, which is the set of all multiples of 4. So H = {..., -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ...}.

Now, a coset of H in G is a subset of the form a + H, where a is an element of G. So each coset consists of all elements of G that can be written as a plus an element of H. 

Since H is 4Z, adding any element of H to a will give another element of 4Z if a is a multiple of 4. Wait, but wait, G is 2Z, which includes all even integers. So H is a subgroup of G since 4Z is a subset of 2Z and it's closed under addition and inverses.

So the question is asking for the left cosets of H in G. Since G is 2Z, the elements are all even integers. So the cosets should be of the form a + H, where a is an element of G. But since H is 4Z, a + H will consist of a + 4k for all integers k. 

Wait, but since G is 2Z, a could be any even integer. Let me think: if a is even, say a = 2m, then a + H = 2m + 4k. Hmm, but that's the same as 2(m + 2k) which is still an even integer. So actually, the cosets are determined by the value of a modulo H. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the multiples of 4.

Wait, let me approach it differently. The index of H in G is the number of distinct cosets. Since H = 4Z is a subgroup of G = 2Z, the index is 2 because G/H should have two cosets. Let's see:

If a = 0, then the coset is 0 + H = H = {4k | k ∈ Z}.
If a = 2, then the coset is 2 + H = {2 + 4k | k ∈ Z}.

Wait, so 2 + H is {2, 6, 10, ...} and { -2, -6, -10, ... }, right? But wait, 2 is even but not a multiple of 4. So these are two different cosets. So the cosets are H and 2 + H.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another way to think about this is that 2Z is the set of even integers. H is 4Z, which is the even integers divisible by 4. So when you take cosets, you're essentially partitioning G into subsets where each subset contains elements that are congruent modulo 4. So, the cosets would be the equivalence classes under modulo 4.

In this case, since G is 2Z, and H is 4Z, the cosets of H in G are the even integers that are 0 mod 4 (which is H itself) and those that are 2 mod 4. Because 2Z is the set of all even integers, and 4Z is the set of all multiples of 4. So 0 mod 4 is H, and 2 mod 4 is the other coset.

Wait, but wait. Hmm, let me clarify. When you're considering the cosets of 4Z in 2Z, since 2Z is a bigger group, the cosets will be the elements of G that differ by elements of H. So 0 mod 4 is H, and 2 mod 4 is the other coset. So the cosets are 4Z and 2 + 4Z.

Looking back at the options, option F is 2Z, 4 + 2Z. Wait no, option F is 2Z and 4 + 2Z. Oh wait, but 2Z is actually H. So perhaps F is not correct. Let me check the options:

Looking back:

A: 4Z
B: Z
C: 4Z, 1 + 4Z
D: 2Z
E: Z, 1 + Z
F: 2Z, 4 + 2Z
G: 4Z, 2 + 4Z
H: 2Z, 1 + 2Z, 2 + 2Z
I: 4Z, 2 + 4Z, 6 + 4Z
J: 4Z, 2 + 4Z, 1 + 4Z

Wait, so H is 4Z, which is option A. But wait, no, the question is about the last character of the answer. The options are the cosets, each is a list of cosets, and the answer is the list, and the last letter is the chosen one.

So the correct cosets are 4Z and 2 + 4Z. So which option has that? Let me look. Option G is 4Z, 2 + 4Z. So that's two cosets. So G is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing: if the group is 2Z and the subgroup is 4Z, then the cosets are 4Z and 2Z + 2? Or not. Wait, no, 2Z + 2 is the same as 2Z, because 2Z is closed under addition. So perhaps the cosets are 4Z and 2Z. Wait, no, that can't be right because 2Z is a subgroup of index 2 in 4Z.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The group is G = 2Z, and H = 4Z. So H is a subgroup of G. The index of H in G is 2. So the number of cosets is 2.

Each coset is a set of the form a + H. Since G is 2Z, a is any even integer. But since H is 4Z, adding any element of H to a will give another even integer. If a is congruent to 0 mod 4, then a + H is 4Z. If a is congruent to 2 mod 4, then a + H is 2 + 4Z. So the two cosets are H (0 mod 4) and 2 + H (2 mod 4).

So that means the cosets are 4Z and 2 + 4Z. Now looking at the options, that's option G.

Wait, but the options in the problem are labeled from A to J, with each option being a list of cosets. So the correct answer is the option that lists 4Z and 2 + 4Z. Looking at the options:

Option G: 4Z, 2 + 4Z. That's correct.

Wait, let me check other options. Option F: 2Z, 4 + 2Z. Oh, wait, 2Z is H. So that's the same as option A, but that's not correct. Because 4 + 2Z is the same as 2 mod 4, which is 2 + 4Z. So option F is 2Z and 4 + 2Z, which is 2Z and 4Z + 2, which is the same as 2Z + 2, but that's not a coset. Wait, no, 4 + 2Z is 2 mod 4, which is the same as 2 +4Z.

Wait, no, 4 + 2Z is the same as 2 + 4Z? Because 4 + 2Z is adding 4 to each element of 2Z, which would just be elements that are 2 mod 4. So 4 + 2Z is 2 + 4Z. So option F is 2Z (which is 4Z) and 4 + 2Z (which is 2 + 4Z). So option F is 4Z and 2 + 4Z. So that's exactly what we have. So option F is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct cosets were 4Z and 2 +4Z, which is option G. So why is option F also correct?

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The options are:

A: 4Z
B: Z
C: 4Z, 1 +4Z
D: 2Z
E: Z, 1 + Z
F: 2Z, 4 + 2Z
G: 4Z, 2 +4Z
H: 2Z, 1 +2Z, 2 +2Z
I: 4Z, 2 +4Z,6 +4Z
J:4Z,2 +4Z,1 +4Z

So option F is 2Z and 4 + 2Z. But 2Z is 4Z, because 2Z is { ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ... }, and 4Z is a subset of that. So 2Z is H. So option F is H and 4 + 2Z. But 4 + 2Z is the same as 2 + 4Z, which is a coset. So option F is 4Z and 2 + 4Z, which is correct. So option F is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct answer is G. So which one is right?

Wait, let me double-check. Let's see, since G is 2Z, the cosets of 4Z in G are:

4Z is H. So any coset is a + H, where a is even. But a can be 0 or 2 mod 4.

So the two cosets are 4Z (when a is 0 mod 4) and 2 + 4Z (when a is 2 mod 4). So the cosets are 4Z and 2 +4Z. So correct options are G.

Wait, but option F is 2Z and 4 + 2Z. 2Z is H, as above. 4 + 2Z is 2 +4Z, which is another coset. So option F lists the two cosets as 4Z and 2 +4Z. So that's correct.

Wait, but option G also lists 4Z and 2 + 4Z. So both F and G have the same two cosets. So why are they different options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, the problem is about the cosets of 4Z in 2Z. So the cosets are elements of G = 2Z, and we're taking 4Z as H. So the cosets are:

H = 4Z.

Another coset is 2 + 4Z.

So the cosets are 4Z and 2 +4Z.

So the correct options are either F or G, depending on how the cosets are represented.

Looking at the options:

F: 2Z, 4 + 2Z → which is H and 2 +4Z.

G: 4Z, 2 +4Z → which is H and 2 +4Z.

So both F and G have the same two cosets, so why are they different options? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the index. The index of H in G is 2, so there are exactly two cosets. The two cosets are 4Z and 2 +4Z, which are the only two possible. So the correct answer is either F or G, but I need to see which is presented.

Wait, let me look again:

Option F: 2Z, 4 +2Z → which is H and 2 +4Z.

Option G: 4Z, 2 +4Z → which is H and 2 +4Z.

So both options F and G present the same two cosets. So why are they both offered? Is one of them incorrect?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coset structure. Let me double-check using another approach.

The cosets of H = 4Z in G = 2Z are determined by the equivalence relation a ~ b iff a - b is in H. So a ~ b iff a ≡ b mod 4.

But wait, since 2Z is the group, and H is 4Z, then in 2Z, a ≡ b mod 4 is the same as saying they are in the same coset of H.

Wait, but 2Z has elements { ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, ... }.

So for a = 0 in G, the coset is 0 + H = 0 + 4Z = {0,4,8,...}.

For a = 2 in G, the coset is 2 + H = {2,6,10,...}.

So these are the two distinct cosets. So the two cosets are 4Z and 2 +4Z.

So the correct answer options are F and G. But the options are given as separate choices, so perhaps the correct options are F or G, and I need to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. The options are:

A: 4Z
B: Z
C: 4Z, 1 +4Z
D: 2Z
E: Z, 1 + Z
F: 2Z, 4 + 2Z
G: 4Z, 2 +4Z
H: 2Z, 1 +2Z, 2 +2Z
I: 4Z, 2 +4Z,6 +4Z
J:4Z,2 +4Z,1 +4Z

Wait, so F is 2Z and 4 +2Z. 4 +2Z is the same as 2 +4Z, which is a coset. So F is 4Z and 2 +4Z.

G is 4Z and 2 +4Z. So both F and G have the same two cosets. So why are they listed as separate options? That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about what the cosets look like.

Wait, another approach: For G = 2Z, which is { ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, ... }, and H = 4Z is { ..., -8, -4, 0,4,8,... }.

The cosets are the equivalence classes under the relation a ~ b iff a - b ∈ H. So, for a = 0, the coset is 0 + H = {0,4,8,...}.

For a = 2, the coset is 2 + H = {2,6,10,...}.

These are the only two distinct cosets because if you take any other even number, like 4, it's in H, so 4 + H = H. Similarly, 6 is 2 mod 4, so 6 + H is the same as 2 + H.

So the two cosets are H and 2 + H. So the correct options are F and G.

But the options list F as 2Z and 4 + 2Z, which is H and 2 +4Z. So F is correct.

G is also correct because it lists 4Z and 2 +4Z, which is the same as F's cosets.

Wait, but why are they presented as separate options? Maybe the problem expects me to pick the one that reflects the cosets correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm thinking about cosets. Another thought: perhaps H is a subgroup of G, and the cosets are of the form gH for g in G. So for G = 2Z, the cosets are g + 4Z for g in 2Z.

But 2Z is a subgroup, so for any g in 2Z, g + 4Z is a coset. But in G, which is 2Z, the elements are 0,2,4,6, etc.

So for g=0: 0 +4Z = 4Z.

For g=2: 2 +4Z.

For g=4: 4 +4Z = (4 mod 4=0) → 0 +4Z = 4Z.

For g=6: 6 +4Z = (6 mod 4=2) → 2 +4Z.

So the cosets are 4Z and 2 +4Z. So the only distinct cosets are 4Z and 2 +4Z.

Thus, the correct answer is either F or G, since both list these two cosets.

Wait, but according to the options, F and G both have the same cosets. So how can both be correct? That can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in labeling.

Wait, let me check the options again:

F: 2Z, 4 +2Z → So 2Z is H, and 4 +2Z is 2 +4Z.

G:4Z, 2 +4Z → 4Z and 2 +4Z.

So both F and G are correct, which would be impossible because the options are separate. But I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm miscounting the cosets. Let me think about the index. The index is the number of cosets, which is 2 in this case. So the options should have two cosets each. Both F and G have two cosets, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the way the options are presented. Option F says the cosets are 2Z and 4 +2Z, but 4 +2Z is 2 +4Z, which is another coset. So F is correct.

Option G says the cosets are 4Z and 2 +4Z, which is correct.

Wait, but the problem seems to have a unique correct option. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, another approach: cosets are the equivalence classes where a and b are in the same coset if a -b is in H. So for G = 2Z, and H =4Z, the cosets are the equivalence classes under mod 4.

So in G, the elements are 0,2,4,6, etc. So 0 and 4 are in the same coset (0 + H), and 2 and 6 are in another coset (2 + H).

So the two cosets are H and 2 + H.

Looking at the options, which list these two cosets?

Option F: 2Z and 4 +2Z. 2Z is H, and 4 +2Z is 2 +4Z, which is 2 + H. So F is correct.

Option G: 4Z and 2 +4Z. Which is correct.

So both F and G are correct. But the problem says "the last character of the answer is X", and in the options, each option has the last character as X, Y, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is G, as it is in the options. So I think G is the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is G. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Subgroup and the Group:**
   - The subgroup H is 4Z.
   - The group G is 2Z.

2. **Determine the Cosets:**
   - The cosets of H in G are determined by the elements of G modulo H.
   - Since H is 4Z, the cosets are elements of G that are either 0 mod 4 or 2 mod 4.
   - Thus, the cosets are 4Z (0 mod 4) and 2 + 4Z (2 mod 4).

3. **Match the Cosets to the Options:**
   - Option G lists the cosets as 4Z and 2 + 4Z, which is correct.
