Okay, so I've got this question about Cotrimoxazole and its dosage. Hmm, let me think. The question says that 960 mg is prescribed every 12 hours. And they're asking for the daily dose in grams, right? Oh wait, the options are all in grams, so I need to convert mg to grams.

Wait, I remember that 1 gram is 1000 mg. So, if the dose is 960 mg every 12 hours, how much is that in a day? A day has 24 hours, so that's two doses a day. So, 960 mg multiplied by 2 would give the daily amount in mg.

Let me calculate that: 960 * 2 = 1920 mg. Yeah, that's correct. Now, to convert mg to grams, I divide by 1000. So 1920 mg divided by 1000 is 1.92 grams. So the daily dose is 1.92 grams.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.92. So that must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is A: 1.92.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Units:** The drug dose is given in mg (milligrams) and converted to grams (g) for the daily dose.
2. **Daily Dose Calculation:** Since the dose is every 12 hours, there are two doses per day. Multiply the 12-hour dose by 2:
   \[
   960 \, \text{mg} \times 2 = 1920 \, \text{mg}
   \]
3. **Convert mg to g:** Since 1 g = 1000 mg, divide the total mg by 1000:
   \[
   \frac{1920 \, \text{mg}}{1000} = 1.92 \, \text{g}
   \]
4. **Match to Options:** The daily dose is 1.92 grams, which corresponds to option A.
