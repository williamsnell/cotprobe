Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric dipole fields. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question says: An electric dipole consists of a pair of equal but opposite point charges of magnitude 4.0 nC separated by a distance of 2.0 cm. What is the electric field strength at the midpoint between the charges?

Wait, I remember that an electric dipole has two charges, +q and -q, separated by a distance d. The midpoint is the point exactly halfway between them. But wait, dipole field—wait, I think the field at the midpoint should be zero because the charges are equal and opposite. Oh, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me visualize this. The charges are +q and -q, separated by d. The midpoint is the center point between them. So each charge is at a distance d/2 from the midpoint. Now, the electric field due to each charge at the midpoint would be in opposite directions because one is positive and the other is negative, right? So each would create a field pointing towards each other. But since they're equal in magnitude, wouldn't their fields cancel each other out?

Oh, wait! But wait, I'm trying to recall the formula for the electric field of a dipole. Oh, right, the electric field at the midpoint is zero because the fields from the two charges are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the net field would be zero. So the answer should be zero. That would be option J.

But wait, let me think again. Is there any other way? Maybe I'm mixing things up. I remember that the electric field due to a dipole isn't just the sum of the individual fields because the dipole's own field isn't just the sum. But the question is about the field at the midpoint, not the field produced by the dipole as a whole.

So, the field at the midpoint would indeed be zero because the charges are equal and opposite and the distance from each to the midpoint is the same. So their fields cancel each other. So the correct answer is J, 0.

The electric dipole consists of two point charges, +q and -q, separated by a distance d. The midpoint between the charges is equidistant from both charges, with a distance of d/2 from each. The electric field at the midpoint due to the +q charge points towards it, and the electric field at the midpoint due to the -q charge points away from it. Since the charges are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, their fields at the midpoint are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, resulting in a net electric field of zero.

Thus, the electric field strength at the midpoint is zero.

ANSWER: J
