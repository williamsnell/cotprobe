C: "unacceptable because in this situation, the wife is “vulnerable to undue inﬂuence."""
D: acceptable only if the wife has also been diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence.
E: acceptable as long as he believes couple therapy will benefit the client's progress in dealing with his alcohol problem.
F: unacceptable because the wife should seek her own professional help.
G: "unacceptable because doing so creates a ""conﬂict of interest.”"
H: acceptable only if the wife gives her written consent to participate in the therapy.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Dr. Delbert Dinwoody inviting his wife to participate in couple therapy is acceptable. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that couple therapy is a form of therapy where couples work together to improve their relationship and reduce problems like alcohol dependence. The client and their partner often take turns discussing their issues. But there are some rules or considerations about who can participate.

The question says the client is 35 and in alcohol dependence. He's inviting his wife to join. Now, I think about the legal and ethical aspects here. In most cases, if someone's permission is given, like inviting someone else's spouse, the person inviting (the client's wife in this case) must obtain consent. They need to ask the client for permission and make sure the consent is non-conditional and specific.

Let me look at the options. Option H says it's acceptable only if the wife gives written consent. Option B says it's acceptable if the wife isn't getting mental health services from another professional. Option F suggests she should seek her own help.

Wait, I think the legal requirement is that the partner must have written consent. Otherwise, it could be a conflict of interest. So if the client's wife doesn't consent, there's a problem. But if she does have written consent, that's acceptable.

Looking at the options:

Option H: "acceptable only if the wife gives her written consent." That seems correct because you can't just invite someone without their consent. So the correct answer should be H.

Option B and F don't mention consent, so they might not be correct. Option E talks about the therapist's bias, which is more about the therapist's approach, not the client's consent. Option G mentions confluence of interest, which would be a problem if the partner has a conflict, but consent is the main issue.

Option A is about not being separated or in divorce. That doesn't address consent or conflicts. Option D says the wife needs to be diagnosed with AD, which isn't a legal requirement. So D is not correct.

So the right answer should be H. It's about the necessity of giving consent.

The correct answer is H: acceptable only if the wife gives her written consent to participate in the therapy.

**Answer: H**
