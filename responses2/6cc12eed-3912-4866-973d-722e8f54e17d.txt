Question:

The president of an online music streaming service whose customers pay a fee wants to gather additional information about customers who have joined in the past 12 months. The company plans to send out an e-mail survey to a sample of current customers with a link that gives participants a month of streaming service for free once the survey has been completed. They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region. Which of the following sample plans would produce the most representative sample of its customers?

Options:

A: Choose all of the customers who joined in the last 6 months.
B: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.
C: Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.
D: Choose a random sample of customers who joined in the last 12 months and have streamed at least 100 songs.
E: Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.
F: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the city in which they live, then choose 5 customers from each city.
G: Choose all of the customers who have joined in the last 12 months and have streamed at least 200 songs.
H: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the country in which they live, then choose 5% of the customers from each country.
I: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the genre of music they most frequently listen to, then choose a random sample from each genre.
J: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sample plans for a music streaming service. The goal is to pick the most representative sample of customers. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the company wants to gather additional info on customers who joined in the past 12 months. They'll send out surveys with a free month of streaming once they complete it. They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region, so the sample should reflect different regions to get accurate insights.

Looking at the options:

A: Choose all who joined in the last 6 months. Hmm, that's a smaller sample. It might not be representative of the entire customer base, especially if there are significant changes or new customers in the last 6 months compared to the last 12.

B: From the last 12, classify by state and choose 10 from each. So they're dividing the customer list by state and then taking a sample from each. That sounds like it's ensuring a diverse representation, which is good because different regions might have different music preferences. If they take 10 from each state, it should cover all regions.

C: Choose all from the last month. That's probably not representative because the last 12 months include a lot more activity than just the last month. It's a small sample, so it might miss out on older users or those who joined recently.

D: Random sample with at least 100 songs streamed. This might have high variability because it's a random selection. But it could still include a mix of regions, but maybe not the optimal way to ensure representation.

E: Random sample from the entire last 12 months list. This seems like a good random approach. It should be representative because it's a random selection across all customers, not biased by any region or other factors. However, the problem is that in the last 12 months, there might be a lot of new users, so it's possible that the sample isn't representative of the entire customer base if the initial list isn't comprehensive.

F: Choose 5 from each city. This is another way to ensure representation. If customers vary by city, choosing a proportional number from each city could make the sample more representative. But it depends on how the list is structuredâ€”does each city have a similar number of customers?

G: Choose all with at least 200 songs. Similar to option D, but this is based on the number of songs streamed. It might include a range of users but could still miss some regions if not all regions have that number.

H: 5% from each country. So, if the customers are grouped by country, they take a 5% sample from each. This could be effective if country represents a significant portion of the customer base, but if a country has very few customers, the sample might not capture them well.

I: Choose random samples from genres. This approach could be good if different genres have different streams, but it doesn't involve any geographical or state-based selection. So it might not ensure that all regions are represented.

J: Choose 3% from each state. Similar to B, but 3% instead of 10%. This could still ensure representation across states, which is good because different regions might have varied music preferences.

Now, the key factors are ensuring that the sample is representative of the entire customer base. Since the company knows tastes vary by region, the sample should reflect this.

Option B: Classify by state and choose 10 from each. That ensures that each state is represented, which is good for diversity. But does it ensure equal representation across all regions? Well, if the state's population is similar, then each state's 10 would be similar. But if some states have much higher population, then the sample might not be proportionally representative.

Option J: 3% from each state. That's similar to B, but with 3% instead of 10%. It's still a good approach, but if the state's size is not considered, perhaps it's better to balance it.

Wait, the question is which sample plan would produce the most representative sample. So the best approach is to ensure that each region is represented. Since the company has data on geographical regions (like states or cities), the most effective way is to select a sample that includes participants from each relevant region.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: 10 from each state. This ensures that you're including all regions, which is good. If a state has a smaller population, 10 might not be sufficient. Option J: 3% from each state, which could be better if states vary in population. But the question states that the company wants the sample to be representative of their customers, not just the geographic regions.

Another approach is to ensure that each region is adequately represented in the sample, regardless of size. So, for example, if the company has 10 states, each with about 100,000 customers, choosing 10 from each might be fine. But if one state has 100,000 and another has 1,000,000, 10 from each state would overrepresent the smaller state.

But in the absence of specific data, the best method is to ensure that the sample reflects the diversity of the entire customer base, which is achieved by including participants from all relevant regions.

So, option B: 10 from each state. Alternatively, option J: 3% from each state. Either one ensures that all regions are included. However, the question is about the most representative, so if the sample is taken proportionally, it's better. But without knowing the exact distribution, 3% from each state (J) might balance out the size differences better.

Alternatively, if the company can't know the distribution, then randomly selecting from each region is the safest approach. But perhaps the best way is to select 10 from each state (B) because it's a fixed number, and the company knows that each state's customer base is similar in size.

Wait, but the question says that the company wants to gather data on customers who joined in the past 12 months. So, they might have a list of all customers, but it's possible that some regions have more activity than others. So to get a representative sample of all customers, the company should sample from each relevant region.

So, option B or J. But J is 3% of each state, implying that it's a balanced approach, while B is 10% per state, which might not account for the varying sizes of states.

So, the most representative approach would be to sample from each region (state) proportionally, but without knowing the size of each state's customer base, the safest approach is to select 10 from each state (option B). Alternatively, selecting 3% from each state (option J) would be better if the company assumes that each state's customer base is similar in size.

I'm a bit torn between B and J. Without knowing the distribution, perhaps J is better because it's a fixed percentage. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

The question says that the company wants to gather info on customers who joined in the past 12 months. They have a list of all customers from that time. To ensure the sample is representative of all customers, not just those from a particular state, they need to sample from each relevant region.

So, the best way is to choose 10 from each state (B) or 3% (J). But option J says 3% of each state's customers. So, if the company has a list where each state has a similar number of customers, 3% would be better. However, if some states have more customers than others, 3% might not be sufficient.

But the question doesn't specify any constraints on the sample size or how the customer list is structured. So, the best approach is to ensure that each relevant region is represented, which is achieved by option B or J.

Wait, the question is about the most representative sample. So, the correct approach is to ensure that the sample includes participants from each relevant region. So, the company should sample from each relevant region (state, city, country) to ensure diversity.

Looking back at the options, option J is to classify by state and choose 3% from each. Option B is to classify by state and choose 10 from each. Both ensure that each state (and thus region) is represented.

So, which is better? If the company can't know the distribution of customers across states, then option B ensures that each state is represented, which is good for diversity. But if the company has a list where each state has a similar number of customers, then J would be better.

But the question doesn't provide information about the distribution, so the safest choice is to sample from each state (option B). Alternatively, if the company's list is structured to have similar sizes, then option J would be better.

Wait, but in reality, different regions have different numbers of customers. For example, a state with 1 million people has fewer people than a state with 10 million. So, 10 from each state would be too small if the state is small. So, perhaps the correct approach is to sample a proportional number from each state, which would be option J (3% of each state).

Alternatively, option B is fixed at 10 per state. So, without knowing the exact size of each state, the safest approach is to sample 10 from each state (option B). But if the company's list is structured to have similar numbers of customers per state, then option J would be better.

Wait, the question says, "classify customers by the state in which they live" for option B and "classify by the state in which they live" for option J. So, if the company's list is organized by state, then option J is using that grouping. But without knowing the exact distribution, the best approach is to choose a sample that includes all relevant regions, which is option B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it this way: the company needs to ensure that the sample includes people from every geographical region they have data on. So, the correct approach is to sample from each relevant region, meaning each state.

So, option B is 10 from each state. That would ensure that each state is represented. Option J is 3% from each state, which might be better if the company assumes that each state's customer base is similar in size. But without knowing that, option B is better because it's more flexible and ensures that each state is represented.

So, the correct answer would be option B.
</think>

The correct answer is option B: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state. This approach ensures that the sample includes participants from each relevant region, which is crucial for a representative and diverse sample. While option J (3% from each state) might balance the size differences, it does not account for the varying sizes of different states, making option B a more flexible and safer choice. 

Answer: B
