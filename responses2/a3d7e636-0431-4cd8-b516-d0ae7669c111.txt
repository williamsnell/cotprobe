Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So Mary is a widow and she executed her will on May 15, 1990. She died on August 18, 1990. Her will said to divide her estate equally between her only child, Joan, and the Salvation Army. Hmm, I remember that in property law, when a will divides assets, it's a general rule that the grantor's heirs get a priority, unless there's a test. 

Wait, but in this case, it's a will, so it's a specific transfer. The estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. But then there's the issue of Joan's ownership. From what I recall, the rule is that the grantor's heirs (and those who file a timely petition requesting the devise be avoided) get the priority. Otherwise, the heirs of the grantor or the testator (the one making the will) get the priority.

So, Mary's will didn't mention anything about Joan's ownership. It just said to divide equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. But wait, the problem says she's a widow and executed her first and only will. So I think that when you issue a will, the grantor (Mary) is the owner. So the way to read this is that the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army, but under a general rule of priority.

Wait, but the question is about the actual distribution. So, under the common law, who is entitled to what? The rule is that the grantor's heirs get priority. If Joan is his heir, then she would get the money first. But since Mary didn't file a will for Joan, she could perhaps be considered as the grantor's heir? Or maybe the grantor's will is the only one, so if Joan is the only child, she's her own heir.

Wait, no. The problem says her last of kinds provided that her estate be divided equally between her only child, Joan, and the Salvation Army. So the will is to divide the estate between Joan and the Salvation Army. So the will itself doesn't mention Joan's ownership. So the will is an equitable transfer, but under the general rule that the grantor's heirs get first.

Wait, but Mary is the grantor. So the grantor is Mary. So her heirs (and testator's heirs) would get the money first. But as a widow, she might not have any heirs. So in that case, the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. But wait, the problem is about the actual distribution.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the options again. The options are about how the estate is distributed.

Option G says 100% to Joan. Option B says 50-50. Option D says 100% to Joan if timely petition. But wait, the will didn't mention Joan's ownership, so the general rule would apply. So who gets the priority? If the grantor's heirs are Joan, she gets first. But if she has no heirs, then the grantor (Mary) would have priority.

Wait, but the problem states that the will provided that the estate be divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. So the will itself doesn't state who gets what unless the will says so. So the will is a generic division, but under the general rule, the grantor's heirs get priority.

So in this case, since Mary didn't file a will for Joan, she might not have any heirs. So the grantor (Mary) would get priority over Joan. So the division would be in Joan's name, except if the grantor's heirs get first. Since she didn't file a timely petition for Joan's avoidance, maybe she is considered as the grantor's heirs. Alternatively, if she did file a timely petition, perhaps she gets the full 100%.

Wait, but the options don't include any about the grantor's heirs. Let me think again. The will provided that the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. So the will itself doesn't state Joan's ownership. So under the general rule, the grantor's heirs get first. So if Joan is Mary's heir, she gets 100%, the Salvation Army gets 0%. But then again, if she didn't file a timely petition for Joan's avoidance, maybe she is considered as the grantor's heir, so she gets the full 100%. But the question is about the way the estate is divided.

Wait, the options don't explicitly say that 100% to Joan. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says 100% to Joan if timely petition. Option G says 100% to Joan. Wait, but is it possible that Joan is considered the grantor's heir, so she gets the full 100%?

Alternatively, if Joan is the grantor's child, and the will doesn't mention her, then the division is 50-50 between her and the Salvation Army. But that's option B.

Wait, no. The problem is that the will doesn't mention Joan's ownership. So under the general rule, the grantor's heirs get first. If the grantor has no heirs, then the grantor (Mary) gets the entire estate. But if the grantor is the owner, then without any heir, Mary gets 100%.

But wait, the options don't have an option for 100% to Mary. Let's look: Option G is 100% to Joan. But if the grantor is Mary, and she's the one making the will, and she's the only one, and she didn't file a timely petition, then perhaps she's the owner, so she gets the full 100%. But that's not an option. The options are A to J.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The will provides to divide the estate equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. So the will itself doesn't state who gets what. So under the general rule, the grantor's heirs get priority. So if Joan is the only child, and she is Mary's heir, then she gets 100%, the Salvation Army 0. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options are about what happens when the will is made. So the will is an equitable transfer. So the grantor's heirs get first. If the grantor (Mary) had no heirs, then the entire estate goes to her. But if she did file a timely petition, then the will is avoided, and the heirs get 100%.

In this case, Mary didn't file a timely petition because she died before her inheritance was completed. But the problem says she executed the will on May 15, and then died on August 18. So by the time she died, Mary had not yet completed her will. So perhaps she didn't file a timely petition.

Wait, but the problem is about how the estate was to be divided, not about the will being executed. So the question is about the distribution as per the will, which says to divide equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. So under the general rule, the grantor's heirs get first. But, if the grantor (Mary) is considered as her own heir, she would get the full 100%. But since she didn't file a timely petition, perhaps she's considered as the grantor's heir, so she gets the full 100%.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where the estate is 100% to Joan. The only option that suggests that is G: 100% to Joan. Option D says 100% if timely, but no option for 100% to her.

Wait, perhaps the scenario is that the will didn't state who gets what, so without any heir, the estate is divided equally. So 50% each, but that's option B.

Alternatively, the will is a generic division, so under the general rule, the grantor's heirs get first. But if the grantor (Mary) is the only one, she has no heirs. So the will is a general division, so the grantor (Mary) gets the entire 100%, but I don't see an option for that.

Wait, looking back at the options. Option G says 100% to Joan. Option D says 100% to Joan if timely. But since the will didn't mention Joan, perhaps the answer is that the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army, and Joan has the option to reject her share. So option B says 50-50, with Joan's option.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the general rule again. The rule is that the grantor's heirs get priority. So if Mary is the grantor, and she has no heirs (as she didn't file a timely petition for her heir), then the estate would go to her. But since the will didn't mention Joan, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, no. The will didn't state who gets what, so the division is between Joan and the Salvation Army. So the general rule would apply, but without any heir, the entire estate goes to Mary. But that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the wording of the will. The will says "the only child, Joan, and the Salvation Army." So the division is equal, but the will doesn't state who gets what. So under the general rule, the grantor's heirs (Mary) get first, but since she's the one making the will, and if she didn't file a timely petition (as she died before her will completed), perhaps she is considered as her own heir, so she gets the full 100%.

But again, the options don't have an option for 100% to Joan. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, another approach: The question says the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. But the general rule is that the grantor's heirs get first. So if the grantor (Mary) has no heirs, the division falls through, and the estate goes to her. But since the will doesn't mention Joan, perhaps she isn't considered an heir, so the division is 50-50 between Joan and the Salvation Army, with Joan having the option to reject her share. That would be option B.

Alternatively, if the will didn't mention Joan's ownership, the division is equal between Joan and the Salvation Army, and the testator (Mary) can choose to reject Joan's share. So the option is B.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where the division is 50-50 with Joan's option. Let me look again:

Option B: 50% to Joan and the income from the remaining 50% to the Salvation Army, but Joan has the option to reject her share.

So, if the will was just to divide equally between Joan and the Salvation Army, but under the general rule, the grantor's heirs get first. So if Mary is the grantor and doesn't have any heirs (when she died, she didn't complete her will), then the grantor (Mary) gets the entire estate, but that's not an option. So perhaps the will's wording is the key. Since the will didn't state who gets what, it's a general division of 50% each, but the testator (Mary) can choose who gets it, but she's the one making the will. Wait, but the will is a will, so the testator (Mary) is the one who made the will, so she should have priority unless she didn't file a timely petition.

Wait, but the testator can file a timely petition to avoid the devise. So if she did file a timely petition, she would get 100%, but if not, the division is 50-50. So in this case, she didn't file a timely petition because she died before her will was completed. So the division is 50-50.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B is 50% Joan and 50% Salvation Army, with Joan having the option to reject. So option B.

So the answer is option B. Because, under the general rule, the division is equal, but the testator (Mary) can choose to reject Joan's share.

The question involves determining how the estate will be distributed under Mary's will, which provides equal division between her child, Joan, and the Salvation Army. The key legal principle here is the general rule that the grantor's heirs (and testator) get priority. Mary executed her will on May 15, 1990, and died on August 18, 1990, shortly after, indicating she did not complete her will, so she did not file a timely petition for Joan's avoidance.

Since Mary is the grantor and the only one making the will, she could claim the highest priority if she had heirs. However, she died before her will was completed, so she likely did not have heirs. This means the general rule applies, and the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. Joan has the option to reject her share.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army. This suggests the will's equal division, but it does not account for the priority given to the testator unless a timely petition was filed. Since no timely petition was filed, this is incorrect.
- **Option B:** 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army. This aligns with the general rule and includes Joan's option to reject her share. This is correct.
- **Option C:** 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army. This is the same as Option B and is correct.
- **Option D:** 100% to Joan. This would require the grantor's heirs to get priority, which is not the case here.
- **Option E:** 100% to the Salvation Army. Incorrect, as the division is not solely between Joan and the Salvation Army.
- **Option F:** 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army. This is correct, as explained above.
- **Option G:** 100% to Joan. Incorrect, as the division is not solely Joan's.
- **Option H:** 100% to the Salvation Army. Incorrect.
- **Option I:** 75% to Joan and 25% to the Salvation Army. Incorrect.
- **Option J:** 25% to Joan and 75% to the Salvation Army. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is that the estate is divided equally between Joan and the Salvation Army, with Joan having the option to reject her share. This corresponds to **Option B** and **Option C**. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **Option B** is the most precise, as it explicitly includes Joan's option to reject her share.
