Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons jumping between orbits and emitting red light. Hmm, I remember that when an electron moves between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon whose energy is the difference between those levels.

The question says the electron jumps from n=3 to n=2, emitting red light. I think red light has a lower energy than blue, so higher energy when emitted. But I need to be precise here.

Wait, the options are all different combinations. Let's see, the formula for the energy levels in the Bohr model comes to mind. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (1/n²), but I need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, but the question is about the magnitude of the quantum of energy. Oh wait, the question says "magnitude," so the sign doesn't matter, but when it comes to options, I need to see if they're just presenting the formula correctly.

Wait, the problem is about the energy emission. So the energy emitted (E) would be the initial energy minus the final. Since the electron goes from higher to lower orbit, E = E_initial - E_final, which is negative, but the magnitude is positive.

The formula for the energy difference between levels n and m is E = (13.6 eV)(1/(n²) - 1/(m²)). But since the electron is moving to a lower orbit, it's (13.6)(1/(3^2) - 1/(2^2)) eV. But wait, let me think about the exact formula.

Oh wait, the exact formula I think is E = (13.6 eV) * (1/(n_initial)^2 - 1/(n_final)^2). So for n_initial =3, n_final=2, that becomes 13.6 * (1/9 - 1/4). Let's compute that.

1/9 is approximately 0.1111, 1/4 is 0.25. So 0.1111 - 0.25 is -0.1389. Multiply by 13.6 eV: 13.6 * (-0.1389) ≈ -1.885 eV. But since it's the energy emitted, the energy is positive 1.885 eV.

Wait, but wait, the options have various expressions, including factors like 10^-19 or 10^-18. Oh, the Bohr model uses electron volts, but the options might be in Joules because the given options have 1e-19 or 1e-18.

So perhaps I should convert eV to Joules. Oh, right. 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So 1.885 eV would be 1.885 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me compute that. 1.885 * 1.602 ≈ ~3.022. So about 3.022e-19 J.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: 3.03 × 10^-19 joule × [1/(3²) - 1/(4²)]

Wait, that's a product of the energy factor and the bracket. But why is it multiplied by that? Oh, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, the correct formula is E = (13.6 eV) * (1/(n_i)^2 - 1/(n_f)^2) ), where n_i is higher than n_f.

So 1/(3²) is 1/9, 1/(2²) is 1/4. So the bracketed term is (1/9 - 1/4) = (4 - 9)/36 = (-5)/36 ≈ -0.1389.

But the energy emitted is positive, so the magnitude is 13.6 * 0.1389 eV. Wait, but 0.1389 is the absolute value of the bracket.

Oh wait, maybe the options are just presenting the formula in terms of the difference, but without the eV conversion. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the formula in terms of the given options.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The options include terms like [1/(3²) - 1/(2²)] which is 1/9 - 1/4 = -5/36.

But the problem is about the magnitude. So the correct energy emitted would be 13.6 * (1/4 - 1/9) eV. Because 3² is 9, 2² is 4, so 1/9 - 1/4 is negative, but the magnitude is 1/4 - 1/9.

So the correct expression is 13.6 eV * (1/(2²) - 1/(3²)) ), because the electron is going from higher n to lower, so E = 13.6 (1/4 - 1/9) eV.

But in the options, which one represents this correctly?

Looking at the options:

Option F: 2.18 × 10^-18 × [1/(3²) - 1/(2²)].

Wait, that would be 2.18e-18 J multiplied by (1/9 - 1/4) = negative, so magnitude would be 2.18e-18 * (5/36) ≈ 3.02e-19 J. So that's option F.

Wait, but wait: the energy levels formula is E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So when the electron transitions from higher n to lower n, the energy emitted is E = E_initial - E_final.

E_initial (n=3) = -13.6 /9 eV = -1.511... eV.

E_final (n=2) = -13.6 /4 eV = -3.4 eV.

So the emitted energy is E_initial - E_final = (-1.511) - (-3.4) = 1.889 eV.

So 1.889 eV is approximately 3.023e-19 J.

So the correct expression would be 13.6 (1/(2²) - 1/(3²)) eV, which is 13.6 * (1/4 -1/9) eV.

Which equals (13.6)*(5/36) eV ≈ 1.889 eV.

But the options are in terms of J and some factors.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 2.18 × 10^-18 × [1/(3^2) - 1/(2^2)]

Wait, that would be 2.18e-18 J * (1/9 - 1/4) = 2.18e-18 * (-5/36) → negative, but the magnitude is 2.18e-18 * (5/(36)).

Wait, 5/36 is about 0.1389. 2.18e-18 * 0.1389 = ~3.02e-19 J.

Which is the same as our calculation.

So the correct expression is 2.18e-18 * [1/(2^2) - 1/(3^2)] → but wait, 1/(2^2)-1/(3^2) is positive, so the bracket is correct.

But looking at the options, F is option F: 2.18 × 10^-18 × [1/(3²) - 1/(2²)].

Wait, that would be 2.18e-18 * (1/9 - 1/4) → which is negative, but the magnitude is positive. So the correct expression would have the positive bracket. So option F is 2.18e-18 * (1/9 - 1/4) → which would be negative, but the magnitude is 2.18e-18 * (5/36) → which equals the correct value.

Wait, but perhaps the options are just written in terms of the energy difference without the eV, but the correct expression would have the eV term. But none of the options have that term except, let me check.

Looking at the options again:

A: 1.55e-19

B: 3.03e-19 × (1/9 - 1/16) → because 1/(3²) is 1/9, 1/(4²) is 1/16. Wait, no, if it's (1/(3^2)-1/(4^2)), that's the same as the difference between 1/9 and 1/16. That would be (16-9)/(9*16) = 7/(144) → approx 0.0486. Then 3.03e-19 * 0.0486 ≈ 1.47e-20 J. But our correct value is ~3e-19, so that's much smaller. So option B would not match.

Option C: 1/(2²) - 1/(3²) → which is 1/4 - 1/9 = 5/36, so 0.1389. So the expression is (5/36) → so factor is 0.1389. But then the expression would have units of 1/(n^2), which is 1/4 and 1/9. So that would be 0.1389, so the value is 0.1389 J. But our correct value is 3.02e-19 J. So option C is 0.1389, which is not matching the correct value.

Option D: 2.18e-18 × [1/(2^2) -1/(3^2) ] → same as 2.18e-18 * 5/36 ≈ 3.02e-19 J. So yes, option D's expression would be correct. Because the [1/(2^2) - 1/(3^2)] is positive, the product is positive.

Wait, but the actual correct energy emitted is 13.6 eV × (1/4 - 1/9) = 13.6 * (5/36) eV ≈ (13.6 *5)/36 eV → 68/36 ≈ 1.889 eV → about 3.02e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.18 × 10^-18 × [1/(2²) - 1/(3²)] → which is 2.18e-18 J * 5/36 → 2.18 *5 = 10.9 → 10.9/(36) → approx 0.30278 → 0.30278e-18 → 3.0278e-19 J. So option D's value is approximately 3.0278e-19 J, which matches our calculation.

Looking at option F: 2.18 × 10^-18 × [1/(3²) -1/(2²)] → which is negative. So when we take the absolute value, it would be the same as 3.02e-19 J. So the magnitude would be same as option D, but option D itself is already positive because it's 2.18e-18 multiplied by a positive bracket.

Wait, but all the options are written as expressions. So which option correctly represents the energy emitted.

So option D is 2.18e-18 × (1/4 - 1/9) → which is 2.18e-18 × 5/36 → correct.

Wait, but the correct formula is E = 13.6 eV (1/4 -1/9) → which is 13.6 * 5/36 eV. 13.6 *5 is 68. 68/36 is approx 1.8889 eV → 3.023e-19 J.

Which matches option D. So option D's expression is correct, so the correct answer is option D.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the energy transition of an electron jumping from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 2 \), emitting red light. The energy difference between these levels is given by the formula:

\[
E = E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
\]

The energy emitted (\( E \)) is the difference between the initial and final energy levels:

\[
E = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} = -\frac{13.6}{n_{\text{initial}}^2} - \left(-\frac{13.6}{n_{\text{final}}^2}\right) = 13.6 \left(\frac{1}{n_{\text{final}}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{\text{initial}}^2}\right) \, \text{eV}.
\]

Substituting \( n_{\text{initial}} = 3 \) and \( n_{\text{final}} = 2 \):

\[
E = 13.6 \left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2}\right) = 13.6 \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9}\right).
\]

Simplifying the bracketed term:

\[
\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{9 - 4}{36} = \frac{5}{36}.
\]

Thus:

\[
E = 13.6 \times \frac{5}{36} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting this energy to joules (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E = 13.6 \times \frac{5}{36} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Calculating the numerical value:

\[
E \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A**: \( 1.55 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) — Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.
- **Option B**: \( 3.03 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \times \left(\frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{4^2}\right) \) — Incorrect, as it includes a negative sign, which does not match the magnitude.
- **Option C**: \( 1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \times \left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2}\right) \) — Incorrect, as the coefficient \( 1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \) does not match the energy difference.
- **Option D**: \( 2.18 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \times \left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2}\right) \) — Correct, as it matches the energy difference in the correct form.
- **Option E**: \( 3.03 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) — Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.
- **Option F**: \( 2.18 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \times \left(\frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{2^2}\right) \) — Incorrect, as it includes a negative sign, which does not match the magnitude.
- **Option G**: \( 4.55 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) — Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.
- **Option H**: \( 2.18 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \times \left(\frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{2^2}\right) \) — Incorrect, as it includes a negative sign and the coefficient does not match the energy difference.
- **Option I**: \( 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \) — Incorrect, as it is far too small and does not match the energy difference.

The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately represents the energy difference in the correct form.
