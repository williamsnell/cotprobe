Okay, so I've got this question about Dodd Co.'s available-for-sale debt securities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

So, the question says that at December 31, Dodd has these debt securities with a cost basis of $24,000 and a fair value of $30,000. The income tax rate is 20%. The question is asking what amount of unrealized gain or loss Dodd should recognize in its income statement for this period.

Hmm, I remember that for debt securities, if they're classified as available-for-sale, the company doesn't recognize gains or losses in their income statement. Instead, they're accounted for using the fair value approach. So, the change in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss, but this doesn't affect the income statement directly. Instead, it's part of the equity section because it's a non-trading security.

Wait, so in this case, the fair value is higher than the cost basis. The cost is $24k, the fair value is $30k. So the unrealized gain would be $6k. But since it's an available-for-sale security, this gain isn't recognized in the income statement. Instead, it's part of the equity, like the fair value adjustment, and is reflected in diluted earnings per share as a component of stockholders' equity.

So, looking at the options, the choices are:

A: $3000 loss. No, because the fair value is higher, so it's a gain.

B: $6000 gain. Hmm, but wait. The options have B as $6000 gain. But I thought the amount is $6k, which is $30,000 - $24,000. So B is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because the question is about the amount of the unrealized gain. So $6k is the amount, but the options don't have that as a possible answer. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are A-H, with J being $3000 gain. Oh wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the options. The choices are:

A: $3000 loss.

B: $6000 gain.

C: $12000 gain.

D: $2400 gain.

E: $4800 gain.

F: $2400 loss.

G: $12000 loss.

H: $0

I: $6000 loss.

J: $3000 gain.

Wait, the correct amount is $6,000, but none of the options say that. Hmm. Oh wait, did I make a mistake? Let me think again.

Wait, no. The unrealized gain is $30k - $24k = $6,000. So the gain is $6,000. But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the choices are A to H, and each has a certain amount. So perhaps I've missed something. Oh wait, maybe I misread the question. Did I get the numbers right?

Cost is $24,000; fair value is $30,000. So $30k - $24k is $6k. That's the unrealized gain. But the options don't have $6k. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the question says, "the amount of unrealized gain or loss" that Dodd should recognize in its income statement. But for available-for-sale securities, no gain is recognized in the income statement. Instead, the fair value adjustment is recorded. So the income statement doesn't show the gain, but the adjustment does.

Wait, but the question is asking specifically about the amount in the income statement. Since available-for-sale doesn't have a gain in the income statement, the answer should be zero. But that's not one of the options. Wait, did I miss a point in the question?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the tax implications. The question mentions an income tax rate of 20%. That affects the tax expense, but the income statement itself doesn't show the gain; it's an accounting adjustment. So, the amount recognized on the income statement is zero.

Wait, but the options given don't include the correct amount. So perhaps I made a mistake in my understanding. Another thought: is there a possibility that the question is referring to something else, like the tax effect?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: if the fair value is $30k, and cost is $24k, the gain is $6k, but since it's available-for-sale, the gain isn't recognized in the income statement. So the income statement shows zero. So the question is, what is the amount to recognize? Since the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute the difference again. $30,000 minus $24,000 is $6,000. So that's the gain. But the options don't have $6k. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misread the question. Oh! Wait a moment. Let me look at the numbers again. The question says, "debt securities with a cost basis of $24,000 and a fair value of $30,000." So, the cost is $24,000, fair is $30,000. So the gain is $6,000.

But the options don't have $6,000. The closest is option B, which is $6,000 gain. But I see that option B is $6k gain. So why is that an option? Wait, maybe the question is not about the gain, but the tax effect.

Oh wait, wait. The question asks what amount of unrealized gain or loss should be recognized in the income statement. And for available-for-sale, the answer is zero. So why is that not an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the choices are A to J. Hmm. So perhaps there's a typo in the problem, but assuming the options are correct as given, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. Oh, wait, the question says "unrealized gain or loss". For available-for-sale, the company doesn't recognize it in the income statement. So the answer should be zero. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question has a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider how the gain is treated. Oh wait, perhaps the question refers to the impact on tax. The question says, "unrealized gain or loss" and "income tax rate was 20%".

Wait, no, the question is about the amount to be recognized. So the correct answer should be zero. But the options don't have that. So maybe I've missed something.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, but the options don't have the correct answer. Or perhaps I'm confusing the accounting treatment.

Wait, another option: perhaps the question is about recognizing the gain as a foreign gain or something else, but the question doesn't state that. It says, "available-for-sale debt securities" at December 31.

Wait, so I'm back to the original thought. The correct answer is zero because available-for-sale doesn't recognize gains in the income statement. But the options don't include zero, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, but given that the options don't have the correct answer, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate.

Cost: $24,000.

Fair value: $30,000.

So, difference is $6,000. So gain is $6,000. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the tax effect. The question is about the amount to be recognized in the income statement, which is zero, but perhaps the options have an incorrect answer.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: $3000 loss.

B: $6000 gain.

C: $12000 gain.

D: $2400 gain.

E: $4800 gain.

F: $2400 loss.

G: $12000 loss.

H: $0.

I: $6000 loss.

J: $3000 gain.

So, the correct answer should be $6,000 gain, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is $6,000 gain, but the problem is that the question is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the unrealized gain or loss, but the tax rate is given. But the question is about the amount to recognize in the income statement, so the tax rate is a distractor. Because for available-for-sale, the gain is not recognized, so the tax isn't an issue. So the answer should be zero.

But the options don't have zero. So perhaps the correct answer is zero, but the options don't include it. So the given options might be incorrect. But without the correct option, perhaps the intended answer is zero, but that's not present.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, but given the options, the closest is option B, which is $6k gain. However, the question says the amount to recognize in the income statement, which for available-for-sale is zero. So I'm confused.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the question is a trick question. For available-for-sale, the gain is not recognized in the income statement, so the answer should be zero. So in that case, the correct answer is H: $0. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A-J. So H is the option with $0 gain, which would be correct according to the accounting rules.

But then why is H an option? Because if the question is indeed about the amount to recognize, then H is correct. But the question says, "unrealized gain or loss that Dodd should recognize in its income statement." So, in that case, the answer would be zero. But H is the option with $0. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but the options include H as an option. So perhaps the answer is H, $0 gain. So the correct answer is H.

But wait, the question says, "unrealized gain or loss." So for available-for-sale, the gain isn't recognized, so it's not an income statement item. So the amount is zero. So the question's wording is confusing. So perhaps the correct answer is zero, which is option H.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought available-for-sale doesn't report gains in the income statement. So the answer should be zero. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: maybe the question is about the tax effect. But the question is about the amount to be recognized, not the tax expense. So for the income statement, the answer should be zero because available-for-sale doesn't report gains or losses.

So, in that case, the correct answer is H: $0. But the options don't have H as the correct answer unless I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

H: $0.

So, according to the options, H is correct. But according to the accounting rules, the answer should be zero. So I'm now confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, but considering the options, the correct answer would be H. So perhaps the correct answer is H.
</think>

The question asks about the amount of unrealized gain or loss that Dodd Co. should recognize in its income statement for its available-for-sale debt securities. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding Available-for-Sale Securities**:  
   - Available-for-sale securities are not recognized in the income statement. Instead, their unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the equity section as adjustments to fair value.
   - For these securities, no gain or loss is recognized in the income statement, regardless of the tax rate.

2. **Calculating the Unrealized Gain**:  
   - Cost basis: $24,000  
   - Fair value: $30,000  
   - Unrealized gain: $30,000 - $24,000 = $6,000  

3. **Applying the Question's Context**:  
   - The question specifically asks for the amount to be recognized in the income statement, which is zero for available-for-sale securities.
   - None of the answer options explicitly state $0, but option H ("$0") is present.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - According to the accounting rules, the correct answer should be $0, as no gain is recognized in the income statement for these securities. However, option H is the only correct choice among the provided options.
