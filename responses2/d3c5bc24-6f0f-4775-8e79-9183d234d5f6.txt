Okay, so I need to find the volume of a tetrahedron with three mutually perpendicular edges of lengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. Hmm, I remember that a tetrahedron with mutually perpendicular edges is called a rectangular tetrahedron. I think the formula for the volume of such a shape is (abc)/6, where a, b, c are the lengths of the edges. Wait, let me make sure I got that right. I recall that for a rectangular prism (which is a box), the volume is a*b*c, and if you connect one corner to the opposite corner, you get a tetrahedron, so the volume of the tetrahedron should be a fraction of that.

So, substituting the given lengths into the formula: a=3, b=4, c=5. So, (3*4*5)/6. Let me calculate that. 3*4 is 12, 12*5 is 60. 60 divided by 6 is 10. So the volume should be 10 cm³. Looking at the options, option D is 10 cm³. So I think the correct answer is D.

To find the volume of the tetrahedron with mutually perpendicular edges of lengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular tetrahedron, which is:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{a \times b \times c}{6}
\]

Substituting the given lengths:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{3 \times 4 \times 5}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \ \text{cm}^3
\]

The correct answer is D: 10 cm³.

Answer: D
