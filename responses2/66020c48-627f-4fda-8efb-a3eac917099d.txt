Okay, so I've got this question about a lap winding DC machine, and I need to find the average pitch. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my DC machine basics, but let me think this through.

The question states that the number of conductors is 100 and the number of parallel paths is 10. Oh wait, I remember that the average pitch of a lap winding is related to the number of conductors and the number of parallel paths. 

Wait a second, average pitch usually refers to the distance between two adjacent conductors along the armature. Oh right, in a lap winding, the coils are connected in such a way that each parallel path has a certain number of conductors. The formula might involve the number of conductors per path multiplied by the number of paths. 

Wait, the formula for average pitch in a lap wound DC machine is (number of conductors) divided by the number of parallel paths. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because if you have more parallel paths, each conductor is spaced further apart, so the pitch would be smaller. So if the number of conductors is higher, the average pitch would be lower. 

Let me think again. The average pitch (P) is calculated as the number of conductors (N) divided by the number of parallel paths (A). So P = N / A. So if N is 100 and A is 10, then P would be 100/10 = 10. Oh wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Could it be the other way around? Like N multiplied by something?

Alternatively, I might be confusing with something else. Oh right, another formula for the average pitch in lap windings is: (number of conductors per path) multiplied by (number of parallel paths). No, wait, that doesn't make sense because the pitch would be too large. 

Wait, maybe the average pitch is the number of conductors divided by the number of parallel paths. So, for example, if you have 100 conductors and 10 parallel paths, each path has 10 conductors. But the pitch is how far apart the conductors are in the machine's axial direction. So if the machine has 10 parallel paths, each path has 10 conductors, but each conductor in one path is spaced how much? 

Wait, in a lap winding, each parallel path has conductors arranged in a loop. So the pitch is the distance between a conductor on one path and the next conductor in the same path. But when you have multiple paths, each conductor in one path is spaced a certain way relative to the next conductor in the adjacent path.

Wait, I think the formula is P = (N / A). Let me check the units. If N is 100, A is 10, then P is 10. So that would make the average pitch 10. Looking at the options, option E is 10. So would the answer be E? But wait, I'm not entirely certain because I might have gotten the formula wrong. 

Alternatively, another approach: In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of times the armature is turned, which is the same as the number of conductors per path. So if there are 100 conductors and 10 paths, each path has 10 conductors. But the pitch is the distance between two adjacent conductors. So when you have 10 parallel paths, each conductor is spaced N/(A * something). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. 

Wait, perhaps the average pitch is the number of conductors divided by the number of parallel paths. So 100 / 10 = 10. So the answer should be E: 10.

The average pitch of a lap winding DC machine is calculated using the formula:

\[
P = \frac{N}{A}
\]

where:
- \( N \) is the number of conductors (100),
- \( A \) is the number of parallel paths (10).

Substituting the values:

\[
P = \frac{100}{10} = 10
\]

Thus, the average pitch is 10. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 10**
