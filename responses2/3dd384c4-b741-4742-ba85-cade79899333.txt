Alright, so I've got this question about tractor depreciation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

Mr. Haines bought a tractor for $2,895. The salvage value at the end of 10 years is $495. We're supposed to use the straight-line method to find the depreciation after the first five years. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Okay, straight-line depreciation. I remember that straight-line method is the simplest way to calculate depreciation. The formula, if I recall correctly, is:

Depreciable Cost / Useful Life = Annual Depreciation

Depreciable Cost, I think, is the cost of the asset minus its salvage value. So, first, I'll calculate the depreciable cost.

So, Cost = $2,895.00, Salvage = $495.00. Depreciable Cost = 2895 - 495. Let me compute that.

2895 minus 495. Hmm, 2895 - 400 is 2495, then subtract 95 more: 2495 - 95 = 2400. So, Depreciable Cost is $2,400.

Now, the useful life is 10 years. So the annual depreciation would be 2400 divided by 10. Let's do that division.

2400 / 10 = 240. So, each year, the tractor depreciates by $240. That makes sense because over 10 years, the total depreciation is $2400, which is the depreciable cost, so each year it's 240.

So, after five years, the total depreciation would be 5 times 240. Let me calculate that.

5 * 240 = 1200. So, the total depreciation after five years is $1,200.

Looking at the options, option G is $1,200. So the answer should be G. But wait, did I make a mistake in calculating the Depreciable Cost?

Wait another thought: Depreciable cost is cost minus salvage value. So 2895 minus 495 is indeed 2400. Divided by 10 years, that's 240 per year. Five years would be 5*240=1200. So yes, option G is correct.

To determine the depreciation after the first five years using the straight-line method:

1. **Depreciable Cost**: Subtract the salvage value from the cost.
   - Depreciable Cost = $2,895.00 - $495.00 = $2,400.00.

2. **Annual Depreciation**: Divide the depreciable cost by the useful life.
   - Annual Depreciation = $2,400.00 / 10 years = $240.00 per year.

3. **Total Depreciation for Five Years**: Multiply annual depreciation by five.
   - Total Depreciation = 5 years * $240.00/year = $1,200.00.

The correct answer is **G: $1,200**.

Answer:
G: $1,200
