Options:

A: A fully executory contract is when both parties have completed their performance.
B: A partially executed contract means that both parties have begun but not completed performance.
C: An executory contract is when one party has performed and the other party has not yet begun performance.
D: An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.
E: A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance.
F: A partially executory contract is when one party has begun performance and the other party has completed performance.
G: A fully executed contract exists when neither party has any remaining obligations.
H: A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.
I: A wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party.
J: An executory contract is when both parties have yet to begin performance.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about executory contracts. I'm a bit rusty on contracts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the question asks which of the options is the least correct regarding executory contracts. Let's break down what each option is saying.

First, I need to understand what an executory contract is. From what I remember, executory contracts are a type of contract where the parties are agreed upon conditions or obligations after the fact, even before the performance of the goods or services. So, the obligations are set in stone, not based on whether they've actually been performed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A fully executory contract is when both parties have completed their performance. Wait, that can't be right. If a contract is fully executory, it's because both parties have agreed to perform and no obligations remain. So if both have performed, they don't need to agree on obligations anymore. So A is incorrect because it says both have completed, meaning they don't have obligations, which would make it a fully executory. So A is wrong, but wait, the question is asking which is the least correct. Hmm.

Option B: Partially executed means both have started but not completed. That makes sense. Because if they've started but not completed, there are obligations, so it's not fully done yet. So B is correct.

Option C: An executory contract is when one has performed and the other hasn't. Wait, that doesn't fit. If one has performed and the other hasn't, that's an obligations contract, not executory. Because executory contracts are based on performance, not promises. So C is incorrect.

Option D: An executed contract exists when both have fully performed and no obligations remain. Yes, that's correct. So D is correct.

Option E: Partially executed means at least one has started. That's correct because if neither has started, it's fully executed. So E is correct.

Option F: Partially executory means one has started, the other completed. Wait, no. Partially executory is when one has started and the other hasn't until the performance. Wait, no, no. Let me think again. Partially executory (or partially executed) would mean that one party has started, but hasn't finished yet. So if one has started and the other hasn't yet performed, it's a partially executed contract. So F says a partially executory is when one started and the other completed. That's not correct because if both started, then it's not partial. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about which is the least correct. So which option is incorrect, or incorrect because it's the wrong definition.

Wait, let's clarify each option.

Option A: Fully executory when both have completed. That would imply no obligations, which is correct for an executory contract. So A is correct.

Option B: Partially executed means both have started but not completed. So correct.

Option C: Executory is one has performed and the other hasn't. No, that's obligations, not executory. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Executed when both have fully performed, no obligations. Correct.

Option E: Partially executed means at least one has started. So correct.

Option F: Partially executory is when one has started and the other completed. No, that's not right. Partially executed would mean one has started but hasn't finished yet. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which is the least correct. So the incorrect options are C and F.

Wait, but the options are each separate. The question is asking which is the least correct. So perhaps multiple options are incorrect, but the question is looking for the one that is least correct.

Wait, perhaps I should list each option's validity.

Option A: Correct. Fully executory when both have completed.

Option B: Correct. Partially executed: both started but not completed.

Option C: Incorrect. Because an executory contract is where one has performed and the other hasn't, which is obligations, not executory.

Option D: Correct. Executed when both have fully performed.

Option E: Correct. Partially executed means at least one has started.

Option F: Incorrect. Partially executory is when one has started and the other hasn't yet done. So F says one has completed the other hasn't started. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Correct. A fully executed contract exists when neither has any remaining obligations. So G is correct.

Option H: Partially executed means one has completed and the other has only promised. Wait, no. Partially executed would be one has started and the other hasn't. So H is incorrect because it says one has completed and the other hasn't started. So H is wrong.

Option I: wholly executory is only promises exchanged, no performance. Yes, I think that's correct. So I is correct.

Option J: Execory is when both have yet to begin. No, because if neither has begun, it's fully executed. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so which options are incorrect?

Looking back:

C: Incorrect.

F: Incorrect.

H: Incorrect.

J: Incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about which is the least correct. So perhaps the incorrect options are C, F, H, J.

But the question is phrased as "which of the following is the least correct?" So the incorrect options are the ones that are wrong, and the correct ones are correct. So the least correct would be the one that is wrong.

Wait, but the options are each a statement about the type of contract. So perhaps the incorrect options are C, F, H, J.

But the question is which is the least correct, i.e., which is the wrong statement.

So perhaps the correct answer is C, F, H, J are incorrect, and the correct answer is the least incorrect, or perhaps one is the wrong statement.

Wait, the question is asking which is the least correct. So the incorrect options are:

A: correct.

B: correct.

C: incorrect.

D: correct.

E: correct.

F: incorrect.

G: correct.

H: incorrect.

I: correct.

J: incorrect.

So the options that are incorrect are C, F, H, J.

The question is which of the following is the least correct. So among these, which is the least correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which option is incorrect because it's wrong in its definition.

But the options are each a statement about the type of executory contract.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that some options are wrong in their general definitions.

Wait, let me think again.

An executory contract is when the obligations are set in stone, regardless of whether the performance is done.

So,

- A fully executory contract: yes, both have completed.

- Partially executed: both have started but not completed.

- Executory: one has performed, the other hasn't. So C is incorrect.

- Partially executed: yes, one has started, the other hasn't. So F is incorrect.

- Partially executory: when one has started and the other hasn't yet. So H is incorrect.

- Partially executed: no. So J is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

C) An executory contract is when one party has performed and the other has not yet begun performance. → No, because that's obligations. So this is incorrect.

F) Partially executed contract means one party has started and the other has completed. → No, that's incorrect. Partially executed is when one has started and hasn't completed.

H) Partially executed means one party has completed and the other has only promised. → No, that's incorrect. Partially executed is one has started but hasn't yet.

J) Execory is when both have yet to begin performance. → No, because if neither has started, it's fully executed. So J is incorrect.

So the incorrect options are C, F, H, J.

The question is the least correct. So which one's incorrect is the least correct?

The question is about the least correct, so the option that's the incorrect definition.

Wait, but the question is which is the least correct. So the incorrect statements are C, F, H, J, and the correct ones are A, B, D, E, G, I.

Wait, but the question is to pick which is the least correct. So, the least correct would be the one that is wrong.

But perhaps the question is to identify the incorrect statement, and the least correct is the one that's the opposite.

Wait, but the question is "which is the least correct?" So the least correct option is the one that is incorrect.

But from the options, perhaps the incorrect ones are the ones that are wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as which is the least correct (i.e., wrong) definition.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definitions.

Option C: Executory is when one has performed and the other hasn't. So that's wrong because that's obligations.

So C is incorrect.

Option F: Partially executed means one has started, the other completed. → Incorrect, because partial execution is when one has started but not yet completed.

Option H: Partially executed is when one completed and the other only promised. → Incorrect.

Option J: Execory is when both have yet to begin. → Incorrect.

So the incorrect options are C, F, H, J.

So the question is asking for the least correct. So which is the incorrect option.

Wait, wait, but the question is about which option is incorrect. So the incorrect options are C, F, H, J.

Which of these is incorrect?

The question is the least correct. So the incorrect definitions are C, F, H, J.

But wait, the question is which is the least correct. So perhaps among these, the incorrect definitions are the ones that are wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the incorrect statement, and we need to choose the least correct one.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The question is: which of the following is the least correct?

So, which option is the incorrect one (i.e., the wrong definition of executory contract).

So let's revist each option:

A: Fully executory: both have completed. Correct.

B: Partially executed: both started but not completed. Correct.

C: Executory: one has performed, the other hasn't. Incorrect. So this is wrong.

D: Executed: both fully performed. Correct.

E: Partially executed: at least one started. Correct.

F: Partially executed: one started, the other completed. Incorrect. Because partial is one started and hasn't yet done.

G: Fully executed: neither has any obligations. Correct.

H: Partially executed: one completed, the other only promised. Incorrect.

I: Fully executory: only promises exchanged, no performance. Correct.

J: Execory: both have yet to begin. Incorrect. So if neither has started, it's fully executed.

So the incorrect options are C, F, H, J.

Wait, the question is which is the least correct. So among these, which is the incorrect definition.

But all these are incorrect, so perhaps the question is about which one is the incorrect statement.

Wait, the options are independent; perhaps only one is incorrect.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding each option.

Let me re-express each option in terms of executory.

Option C: An executory contract is when one party has performed and the other hasn’t begun. That would be an obligations contract, not executory. So C is incorrect.

Option F: Partially executed means one started and the other completed. That's not correct. Partially executed would be when one has started but hasn't yet done.

Option H: Partially executed is when one has completed and the other only promises. That's wrong. Partial execution is when one has started but hasn't yet.

Option J: Execory is when both parties have yet to perform. That's incorrect because if neither has performed, it's fully executed.

So all four (C, F, H, J) are incorrect definitions.

So the question is which is the least correct. Since all four options are incorrect, but the question is which is the least correct, which is the incorrect statement? Or perhaps the least correct among the possible options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the incorrect definitions, so the options that are wrong would be the least correct.

So, for example, if I were to imagine the options, the correct ones are A, B, D, E, G, I.

The incorrect ones are C, F, H, J.

So the question is which is the least correct. So the incorrect ones are C, F, H, J.

Wait, but the question is only to select one option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding and looking for only one incorrect option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which option is wrong in terms of how executory contracts are structured.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's wrong, but the question is which is the least correct. So if all four are incorrect, but the question is about which is the least correct, perhaps the incorrect options are the least correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, which is incorrect. Because option F says 'partially executed' when one party has completed and the other has only promised. That's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the opposite: which one is incorrect in terms of executory.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think of it as about the correct definitions.

The correct definitions:

1. Fully executory: both have completed, no obligations.
2. Partially executed: both started but not yet completed.
3. Executory: one has performed, the other hasn't.
4. Partially executed: one has started and hasn't yet completed until the performance.
5. Partially executory: one has started, the other hasn't yet.
6. Execory: neither has started yet, so fully executed.

So, looking back at the options:

Which is incorrect?

C: Executory is when one has performed and hasn't started. So C is wrong.

F: Partially executed is when one has completed and the other has only promised. So F is wrong.

H: Partially executed is when one has completed and the other hasn't started. So H is wrong.

J: Execory is when neither has started. So J is wrong.

So all four are incorrect.

The question is which is the least correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which option is incorrect, and the answer is the one that's incorrect.

Looking at the options, the question asks for the least correct.

The least correct would be the one that is the incorrect statement.

So, which of these options is incorrect?

Let me think about each option:

A: Correct.

B: Correct.

C: Incorrect.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Incorrect.

G: Correct.

H: Incorrect.

I: Correct.

J: Incorrect.

So among these, all except A, B, D, E, G, I are incorrect.

But the question is in multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is the incorrect option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the definition of executory contracts.

Wait, let's look again.

Option C: Executory is when one party has performed and the other hasn't yet begun. So this is incorrect because executory contracts are about obligations, not performance.

So C is wrong.

Option F: Partially executed is when one has started and the other completed. So no, that's incorrect.

Option H: Partially executed is when one completed, the other has only promised. → Incorrect.

Option J: Execory is when neither has started. → Incorrect.

So all four (C, F, H, J) are incorrect.

But the question is which option is the least correct. So if all are incorrect, but the question allows only one, perhaps the least incorrect is the option that's closest to being correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which is the least correct (i.e., incorrect) statement.

But the options are all incorrect. So perhaps the question is about the definitions. For example, option C is wrong because it's set up as an executory contract when it's not. So the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the opposite. For example, if an executory contract is when neither has performed, then option J is correct, and the others are incorrect.

Wait, the options are:

J: Execory is when both have yet to begin performance.

That's correct because if neither has started, it's fully executed.

So J is correct.

So in the options, only options C, F, H are incorrect.

So the question is which is the least correct. So among these, perhaps the incorrect ones are the least correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C because it's the least correct in terms of defining an executory contract.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. I think the correct answer is option C because it's incorrect.

But the question is which of the options is the least correct, so perhaps the incorrect option is option C.

Alternatively, the question is looking for the incorrect option, which is option C.

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct definitions are:

A: Correct.

B: Correct.

C: Incorrect.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Incorrect.

G: Correct.

H: Incorrect.

I: Correct.

J: Incorrect.

So all except A, B, D, E, G, I are incorrect.

But the question is about which option is the least correct, so perhaps option C is the incorrect one.

Wait, but the options are all incorrect. So perhaps the question is looking for the incorrect definition, and the least correct is option C because it's the most opposite of the correct definition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C as it's the least correct because it's the opposite of what executory contracts are.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think I'm overcomplicating this.

So, based on the definitions, the incorrect options are C, F, H, J.

So the question is which is the least correct.

So, perhaps the answer is option C because it's incorrect, making it the least correct.

But the question is about which is the least correct, so perhaps it's the incorrect option that is the least correct.

But wait, I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is option C because it's the one that's opposite.

Alternatively, the least correct is the one that's the opposite of what the question is asking.

But I'm not certain. I'll have to proceed.
</think>

The question asks which statement about executory contracts is incorrect. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Option A**: Correct. Fully executory means both parties have completed, leaving no obligations.
2. **Option B**: Correct. Partially executed means both have started but not yet completed.
3. **Option C**: Incorrect. Executory contracts are about obligations, not performance. It should be the other way around.
4. **Option D**: Correct. Executed means both have fully performed with no obligations.
5. **Option E**: Correct. Partially executed means at least one has started.
6. **Option F**: Incorrect. Partially executed means one has started but not yet completed.
7. **Option G**: Correct. Fully executed means neither has any obligations.
8. **Option H**: Incorrect. Partially executed means one has completed but not started.
9. **Option I**: Correct. Fully executory means only promises have been exchanged.
10. **Option J**: Correct. Execory refers to neither party having started, meaning it's fully executed.

The least correct option is **C**, as it incorrectly describes executory contracts.
