Question:

What does it mean if the heritability index for a particular trait ishigh?

Options:

A: The trait will be the same across all individuals regardless of their environment
B: 90% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to environmental factors
C: The trait is entirely determined by environmental factors and has no genetic basis
D: Heritability index indicates that the trait cannot be passed down from generation to generation
E: Heritability index has no connection with genetic factors
F: 70% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to genetic factors
G: The trait is not influenced by any external factors and is solely determined by genetics
H: Heritability index indicates the degree of modifiability of the trait
I: 50% of the variance found in the scores in the population is due to genetic factors and the other 50% to environmental factors
J: The heritability index for the trait is a fixed value and does not vary across populations

Okay, so I've got this question about heritability indices. Hmm, I remember that heritability refers to the proportion of variation in a particular trait that can be attributed to genetic factors. Let me try to break this down.

The question is asking what it means if the heritability index is high. I need to pick the correct option from A to J.

What do I know about heritability? Oh right, it's a measure of how much of the variation in a trait is due to genetic variance. So if it's high, that means a larger portion of the variation in that trait comes from genetics rather than environment.

Looking at the options:

Option F says 70% of the variance is due to genetics. That lines up with heritability, which is about genetic factors. So F sounds correct.

Option A: The trait is same regardless of environment. No, that's more about constancy, not heritability. Heritability is about variation, not trait constancy.

Option B: 90% environmental. That's the opposite of what I thought. Heritability is genetic, not environmental.

Option C: Entirely environmental. No, because heritability includes genetic variance.

Option D: Heritability doesn't pass traits. That's more about transmission, not about the index itself.

Option E: Indicates the trait can't be passed. Not relevant; heritability is about genetic transmission, not trait "passability".

Option I: 50% each. That's when heritability is half genetic and half environmental. If it's high, beyond 50%, option I would be incorrect.

Option J: Fixed value across populations. That's more about the concept of heritability being a heritable property, not a measure of how much is actually genetic in each case.

So the correct answer should be F: 70% (or whatever percentage is given) of the variance is due to genetics.

The correct answer is **F: 70% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to genetic factors**.

**Explanation**:

Heritability measures the proportion of variation in a trait due to genetic factors. If heritability is high, a larger percentage of the trait's variance is attributed to genetics, indicating that the trait is genetically determined and largely independent of environmental factors. 

- **Option F** is correct as it accurately reflects a high heritability index indicating significant genetic contribution.
- All other options either describe incorrect aspects of heritability (e.g., environmental factors, no genetic basis, no transmission, no genetic contribution, fixed value, or incorrect split of variance) or refer to the wrong definition.
