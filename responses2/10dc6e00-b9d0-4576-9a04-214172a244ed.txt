<think>
Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about a Galilean-type telescope. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. Let's start by remembering what I know about telescopes and their components.

So, the question gives me the refractive powers of the front and back lenses. The front is +10.00 diopters, and the back is -12.50 diopters. I'm supposed to find the separation between the two lenses and the angular magnification when the system is afocal. Wait, wait, what's afocal mean? Oh right, afocal means the telescope is at infinity, so the light rays come parallel to the axis. I remember that for a Gaussian refracting telescope, afocal means it's at infinity, so the image is formed at infinity, which makes the angular magnification negative. Because the formula for angular magnification is - (d)/(f_o), where d is the separation between the lenses, and f_o is the focal length of the objective (front lens) in air. 

Wait, no, maybe I should think again. The angular magnification for a Galilean telescope when it's afocal is given by the formula M = (f_o)/(f_i), but wait, that's for a normal telescope. Oh wait, no, for the afocal telescope, the angular magnification is M = -d/(f_o), where d is the separation. Because when the telescope is afocal, the image is formed at infinity, so the magnification is negative. 

Wait, let's get the formula correct. The angular magnification for a telescope is M = (d)/(f_o) when it's a normal (normal and objective, etc.), but wait, no, actually, for a telescope, the magnification is M = -d/f_o. Because the image is inverted, so negative. So if it's afocal, that means the system is at infinity, so the image is formed at infinity, so M = -d/f_o. Because, for afocal, the image is at infinity, so the magnification is -d/(f_o). 

So, given the front lens is +10 diopters. diopters is 1/d, so the front focal length f_o is 1/10 meters, which is 10 cm. Wait, but the unit here—wait, diopters are per meter. So 10 diopters is 10 m⁻¹, so f_o = 1/(10) meters = 10 cm. Correct. But wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, the front lens is +10.00 diopters. So f_o = 1/(10) meters = 0.1 meters, which is 10 cm. Correct. The back lens is -12.50 diopters. So, its focal length f_b would be 1/(-12.5) meters, which is -80 mm, but wait, wait, let me compute that. 1 / (-12.5) meters is -0.08 meters, which is -8 cm. So f_b is -8 cm.

Wait, but wait. The front lens is a converging lens, and the back is a diverging lens. So for a telescope, the image is formed by the diverging lens. The separation between the lenses is d. So, the separation d is the distance between the front lens and the back lens. So, the formula for the separation when the system is afocal is d = f_o - f_b? Or wait, maybe d is f_o + |f_b|? Let me think. 

Wait, for the afocal telescope, the image is formed at infinity. So, the object is placed at infinity for the objective. The image is formed at infinity by the objective, which is a converging lens. Wait, but the back lens is a diverging lens. Hmm, wait, no—Wait, when the system is afocal, the light rays are parallel (at infinity), so the objective's image must be at infinity, which implies that the image is formed at infinity. That would imply that the objective's focal length is positive, and the image is at infinity. But wait, the objective is a converging lens, so its focal length is positive.

Wait, but the back lens is a diverging lens, so its focal length is negative. So, when the system is afocal, the diverging lens (back lens) must be positioned so that the image formed by it is at infinity. So, the back lens's image is at infinity. So, the back lens must be at a position such that the image is at infinity. So, the image distance for the back lens is infinity, which requires that the object distance is at infinity. But the object is coming from the front lens. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this all wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps for an afocal telescope, the separation between the front and back lenses is equal to the focal length of the front lens. Because when the system is afocal, the back lens is placed at a distance equal to the focal length of the front lens. So, if front is f_o, then the back is at f_o, so the separation is f_o - |f_b|? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The separation d is the distance between the front and back lenses. So, for a telescope, the separation is f_o + f_b (since the back lens is placed such that its focal point is at f_b, but the object is at infinity, so the image is at f_b. Wait, no. For a normal telescope, the object is at infinity, the image is at f_b (for the objective), which is a virtual image. Then, the back lens is placed such that its focal point (f_b) is at the image position. So the separation is f_o + |f_b|. 

Wait, but in our case, the system is afocal. So, the image is at infinity. So the back lens must be placed such that the image is at infinity. But the image is formed by the back lens. So the back lens's image is at infinity. So the object distance for the back lens must be infinity. Because for a lens, if the object is at infinity, the image is at f_b. So, to have the image at infinity, the object must be at f_b, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the afocal condition is when the image is at infinity. So, the back lens's image is at infinity. So, the back lens must be placed such that the image is at its focal point. So, the object must be placed at infinity, which makes the image at f_b. So, to have the image at infinity, the back lens's image must be at infinity, which occurs when what? Hmm, perhaps when the back lens is placed at a distance d from the objective, such that the image from the objective is at the focal length of the back lens.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the conditions. Let me think differently. For a telescope, the angular magnification is M = - d/(f_o) when it's afocal. Because when the system is afocal, the image is at infinity, so the magnification is determined by the separation and the focal lengths.

So, the angular magnification is M = -d/(f_o), where d is the separation between the two lenses. Because the object is at infinity, the image is at infinity, so the magnification is negative because it's inverted.

Wait, but wait, another formula I remember is that for a Gaussian refracting telescope that's afocal, the magnification is M = - (f_o) / (d). So, M = -d/f_o. So, M = -d/(f_o).

In this problem, the front lens is +10 diopters, so f_o = 10 cm (since 10 diopters = 1/0.1 m = 10 cm).

The back lens is -12.50 diopters, so f_b is 1 / (-12.5) meters = -8 cm. So, the separation d is given by M = -d/f_o. But wait, in this case, when the system is afocal, the magnification is M = -d/f_o. But we need to find d. Wait, no, because the problem gives M, but in this case, since it's afocal, M is given by the formula. Wait, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify the approach.

So, given two lenses, front (f_o) and back (f_b), what is the separation d when the system is afocal. The separation d is the distance between the front and back lenses. So, for a telescope, the separation is f_o + f_b (since the back lens is placed such that its focal point is at f_b, and the image is formed at f_b by the back lens). But wait, that's only for a normal telescope. For afocal, when the system is at infinity, the back lens must be positioned such that its image is at infinity, which would require that the back lens's focal length is placed so that the image is formed at infinity. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, for the afocal condition, the image is formed at infinity. So, the back lens must have its image at infinity. So, the object (from the front lens) must be placed at infinity for the front lens. That means the image is at f_b (from the front lens), which is a virtual image. Then, the back lens is placed such that its focal point is at f_b. So, the separation is f_o + |f_b|? So, d = f_o + |f_b|.

Wait, let's compute that. f_o is 10 cm, f_b is -8 cm (so |f_b| is 8 cm). So, d = 10 + 8 = 18 cm. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 2cm, -2

B: 2.5cm, -1.75

C:1cm, -1

D:4cm, -2.5

E:1cm, -2

F:2.5cm, -1

G:3cm, -1.5

H:2cm, -1.25

I:1.5cm, -1.25

J:3.5cm, -1

Wait, none of these is 18 cm. Hmm, so perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach: For a afocal telescope, the separation is f_o - f_b. Since the back lens is diverging (negative), f_b is negative. So, the separation would be f_o - f_b. Let's compute that.

f_o = 10 cm, f_b = -8 cm.

So, separation d = 10 - (-8) = 18 cm. Again, same as before, but that's not in the options. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the angular magnification is different. Oh wait, in the afocal condition, M = -d/f_o. So, M = -d/f_o. So, M is negative, which makes sense because the image is inverted.

So, if the system is afocal, M is -d/f_o. But wait, do I know M? The question doesn't give me the magnification; it's asking for M? Wait, let's read the question again.

The question is asking: What must the separation of the two lenses be if the system is afocal? And the angular magnification.

So, the separation is d, and the magnification M is -d/f_o. But wait, but without knowing M, how can I find d? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is, given the two lens powers, what is the separation for afocal? And what is the magnification.

So, the separation is d = f_o - f_b? Or d = f_o + |f_b|?

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the formula for the magnification in afocal telescopes. The magnification M is negative because the image is inverted, and it's given by M = -d/f_o.

So, M = -d/(f_o) → d = - M * f_o.

But wait, but M is also given by the magnification formula when the system is afocal. Alternatively, perhaps the magnification M is M = -d/f_o.

But wait, without knowing M, perhaps I'm stuck. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the angular magnification; it's asking for both the separation and the magnification. So, perhaps the setup is that the system is afocal, so the separation is d = f_o + |f_b|.

Wait, let's compute that again. f_o is 10 cm, f_b is -8 cm. So, |f_b| is 8 cm. So, d = 10 + 8 = 18 cm. But this isn't an option. Hmm. The options all have smaller separations, like 1cm, 2cm, etc. So perhaps this is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think about the afocal condition differently. When the system is afocal, the image is formed at infinity. So, the object is at infinity, and the image is at infinity on the back lens. So, for the back lens, the object is at infinity, so the image is at f_b. But for the system to be afocal, the image from the back lens is at infinity, which would imply that the image is at f_b, but that would only happen if... wait, no. Maybe the object for the back lens is at f_b, so the image is at infinity.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to calculate the separation. Let me think about the separation between the two lenses. In a Gaussian refracting telescope, the separation d is f_o - f_b. Because for a normal telescope, d = f_o + f_b (since the back lens is placed at the focal point of the objective). But in this case, the system is afocal, which is a different configuration. So, perhaps afocal condition requires the separation to be f_o + |f_b|.

Wait, but let's think of the afocal condition another way. The angular magnification M is given by M = - (d) / (f_o). So, M = -d/f_o.

But wait, in this case, the object is at infinity, so the image is at infinity, which requires that the back lens's image is at infinity. So, the back lens must be placed such that its image is at infinity. So, the object must be placed at infinity for the front lens, which is a converging lens. So, the image is at f_b, which is a virtual image. Then, the back lens is placed at that image position. So, the separation is f_o + |f_b|.

Wait, but f_o is 10 cm, f_b is -8 cm (so |f_b| is 8 cm). So, the separation is 10 +8 =18 cm. But this is not an option. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding afocal condition.

Alternatively, for afocal, the separation d is f_o - f_b. So, f_o is 10, f_b is -8. So, 10 - (-8) =18 again. Still, not in the options.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for angular magnification in afocal. M = -d/f_o. So, M = -d/f_o → d = - M f_o. But without knowing M, this seems unmanageable. But wait, perhaps I can compute M regardless.

Wait, let's compute the power of the two lenses. The front lens has a power of +10 diopters (so f_o = 0.1 m = 10 cm). The back lens is -12.5 diopters, so f_b = -0.08 m = -8 cm.

For afocal, the separation is d = f_o - |f_b| = 10 - 8 = 2 cm. Wait, that's option A and option E. Let me think, why would d be 2 cm? Because maybe for afocal, the separation is f_o - |f_b|.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the formula for angular magnification in afocal. Let's say the separation is d, and the magnification is M = -d/f_o. So, M would be -d/f_o. So, if I could compute M, I could find d. But without knowing M, I can't compute it. Alternatively, perhaps M can be found using the formula for the magnification of a telescope.

Wait, in a normal (non-afocal) telescope, the magnification is M = (d)/(f_o), but with a negative sign because it's inverted. So M = -d/f_o.

But when the telescope is afocal, the image is formed at infinity, so the magnification is M = -d/f_o. But in this case, the magnification is given by M = -d/f_o. So, M = -d/f_o.

Wait, but I don't know M yet. So, perhaps I can relate the two. Let's think: For the afocal system, the separation is d = f_o - f_b. Because when the system is afocal, the back lens is placed at the image position of the front lens. So, the separation is f_o plus the absolute value of the back lens's focal length.

Wait, no. Let me think: The front lens has focal length f_o (positive, converging). The image is at f_b (which is -8 cm, so the image is virtual on the same side as the object for the front lens). So, the back lens is placed at f_b, so the separation is f_o - |f_b|.

Wait, no. Because f_b is negative, so its absolute value is 8 cm. The separation between the front and back is 10 cm - 8 cm = 2 cm. So, d=2 cm. Then, the magnification M would be M = -d/f_o → M = -2/10 = -0.2. So, M is -0.2.

Wait, but the options include (A) 2cm, -2. Hmm, but according to this, M would be -0.2, not -2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the separation for afocal is f_o + f_b, but that would be 10 + (-8) = 2 cm. So, d=2 cm, M= -d/f_o → M= -2/10 = -0.2.

But none of the options have d=2 cm and M=-0.2. Wait, but the option A is 2 cm and M=-2. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think again about the separation.

Wait, in the afocal case, the separation is f_o (front lens) minus |f_b| (back lens). So, d = f_o - |f_b|.

So, f_o is 10 cm, |f_b| is 8 cm. So, d=2 cm.

Then, the magnification M is -d/f_o → M = -(2/10) = -0.2.

So, the separation is 2 cm, and M is -0.2.

Looking at the options, option A is 2 cm, M=-2. Hmm, but our M is -0.2, which is not given. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, perhaps the separation is f_o + f_b, but with f_b negative. Let's compute that: 10 cm + (-8 cm) = 2 cm. So, same result.

Then, M = -d/f_o → M = -(2/10) = -0.2.

So, the options have d=2 cm (option A: 2cm, M=-2), but our M is -0.2. So, that's a problem. Why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the angular magnification in the afocal case. Maybe the formula is M = f_o / |f_b|.

Wait, but that's not the case. Let me think again. In a normal (non-afocal) telescope, the magnification is M = (d)/(f_o), with M negative because it's inverted. So, M = -d/f_o.

But in an afocal telescope, the image is at infinity. So, for the back lens, the image is at infinity, which requires that the object is at infinity for the front lens. So, the separation is d = f_o + |f_b|.

Wait, no. Wait, for the afocal, the image is at infinity, so the back lens must be placed at the image position of the front lens. So, the separation is d = f_o + |f_b|.

Wait, but that would make d = 10 +8 =18 cm, which is not any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the separation d. If the system is afocal, the separation is d = f_o - f_b. Because, for the back lens, the image is at infinity, which implies that the object is at f_b for the front lens. So, the separation is f_o - f_b. Wait, but f_b is negative, so f_o - f_b is f_o + |f_b|.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option A is 2 cm, M=-2. Option D is 4 cm, M=-2.5.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the magnification using the formula M = (d)/(f_o). So, M = (2 cm)/(10 cm) = 0.2. So, M = -0.2, which is negative, but the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular magnification is M = (d)/(f_o), but with a negative sign because it's inverted. So, M = -d/f_o.

So, M = -(2)/10 = -0.2.

But none of the options have M=-0.2. The closest is option A: M=-2.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the separation.

Wait, another approach: For the afocal telescope, the separation is the sum of the front and back focal lengths. So, d = f_o + f_b. Wait, but the back focal length is negative, so d = f_o + (-f_b). So, d = f_o - f_b.

Wait, but let's compute that: f_o = 10 cm, f_b = -8 cm. So, d = 10 - (-8) = 18 cm. Not an option.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the given options. The options have separations in the 1-3 cm range, and M in the -1.25 to -2.5 range.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the separation for the afocal condition as the difference between the front and back focal lengths. So, d = f_o - |f_b|.

So, f_o = 10 cm, |f_b|=8 cm. So, d=2 cm. So, that's option A.

Then, the magnification M would be M = -d/f_o = -(2/10) = -0.2.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the separation is f_o - |f_b|, and the magnification is given by M = -d/f_o. So, M = -2/10 = -0.2.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the afocal condition.

Wait, another thought: For the afocal telescope, the separation is d = f_o - f_b. Wait, no, that would be 10 - (-8) = 18 cm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the angular magnification in afocal is M = f_o / |f_b|. So, 10 / 8 = 1.25. So, M = -1.25.

Wait, but that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula for the angular magnification in the afocal condition.

Wait, the problem says that the system is afocal, which means the image is at infinity. So, the magnification is given by M = -d/f_o.

But if I compute M as M = d/f_o, then it's positive, but since the image is inverted, it's negative.

Wait, perhaps I should not compute the magnification but instead find the separation from the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: d=2 cm, M=-2.

Option D: d=4 cm, M=-2.5.

So, let's see if M = -d/f_o. So, M = -(d)/(10).

So, M = (-d)/10. So, M = -d/10.

So, for option A, d=2 cm. So, M= -2/10 = -0.2. Not matching.

Option D: d=4 cm. M= -4/10= -0.4. Not matching.

So, none of the options match this.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think about the angular magnification in afocal again.

Wait, afocal telescope's angular magnification can be determined using the formula M = (d)/(f_o). But with a negative sign because the image is inverted.

So, M = -d/f_o.

So, M = -(d)/10.

So, for the options:

If M = -2, then d = (2 *10)/2 = 10 cm. But that's not an option.

If M = -2.5, then d = (2.5 *10)/2.5 =10 cm. Not an option.

Hmm, this seems to be getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the separation is d = f_o - |f_b|. So, 10-8=2 cm. So, d=2 cm. So, option A.

Then, the magnification M is M = -d/f_o = -(2)/10= -0.2.

But none of the options have M=-0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute M differently.

Wait, the magnification for afocal is M = (d)/(f_o). So, M = (2)/10=0.2. So, M=-0.2.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula for the magnification in the afocal case. Maybe M = f_o / |f_b|.

So, M = 10 /8=1.25. So, M=-1.25.

Hmm, option G is d=3 cm, M=-1.5.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the magnification using another method.

Wait, the angular magnification M is given by M = (f_o) / |f_b|.

So, M = 10 /8=1.25.

So, M=-1.25.

So, M= -1.25.

Looking at the options, option G is d=3 cm, M=-1.5.

Hmm, not matching. Option H is d=2 cm, M=-1.25.

Ah! Option H: d=2 cm, M=-1.25.

Wait, but I just calculated M=-1.25 using the formula M = f_o / |f_b|.

So, option H has M=-1.25 and d=2 cm.

So, perhaps I should have used that formula.

So, the problem is, perhaps the angular magnification in afocal is M = f_o / |f_b|.

So, M =10 /8=1.25.

So, M=-1.25.

So, the options have option H: d=2 cm, M=-1.25.

So, that's the correct answer.

So, the separation is 2 cm, and the angular magnification is -1.25.

Therefore, the answer is option H.
</think>

The problem involves determining the separation of the two lenses and the angular magnification of a Galilean-type refractive telescope when the system is afocal. Here's the analysis:

1. **Focal_lengths of the lenses**:
   - Front lens: \( f_o = +10 \, \text{diopters} \) implies \( f_o = 0.1 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{cm} \).
   - Back lens: \( f_b = -12.5 \, \text{diopters} \) implies \( f_b = 0.08 \, \text{m} = -8 \, \text{cm} \).

2. **Separation for an Afocal Telescope**:
   - In an afocal telescope, the separation between the lenses is given by \( d = f_o - |f_b| \).
   - Substituting the values: \( d = 10 \, \text{cm} - 8 \, \text{cm} = 2 \, \text{cm} \).

3. **Angular Magnification (M)**:
   - The angular magnification for an afocal telescope is given by \( M = \frac{f_o}{|f_b|} \).
   - Substituting the values: \( M = \frac{10 \, \text{cm}}{8 \, \text{cm}} = 1.25 \).
   - Since the image is inverted, \( M = -1.25 \).

4. **Matching the Options**:
   - Option H provides the separation \( d = 2 \, \text{cm} \) and the angular magnification \( M = -1.25 \), which matches our calculations.

ANSWER: H
