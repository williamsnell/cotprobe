Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutron stars and angular speed. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that a star collapses into a neutron star, and we need to find its angular speed. The key here is probably the conservation of angular momentum because when objects orbit a central point, their angular momentum remains the same unless there are external torques. Since the problem says it's a rigid, solid sphere before and after, I think angular momentum should be conserved.

So, angular momentum (L) is I * ω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity. Angular velocity is 2π divided by the period (T), right? So ω = 2π/T.

The moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)MR². Since the star's radius changes during collapse, but the mass remains the same (assuming the density changes don't affect the mass), I can calculate the initial and final moments and set their products with angular velocities equal.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, the problem states that the star is a uniform, solid sphere both before and after collapse. So the mass M is the same for both cases. That's important.

So initially, the star has radius R_initial = 7e5 km. But wait, I need to convert that into meters because SI units are standard. Let's see, 1 km is 1e3 meters. So 7e5 km is 7e8 meters. Wait, wait, no. 7e5 km is 7 * 1e5 km, which is 7 * 1e5 * 1e3 meters. That's 7e8 meters. Oh wait, no: 1e5 km is 1e5 * 1e3 = 1e8 meters. So 7e5 km is 7e8 meters? Wait, wait, 7e5 km is 7 * 1e5 km, so 7e5 * 1e3 m = 7e8 m. Hmm, yeah.

The initial radius R_initial is 7e8 meters. The final radius R_final is 16 km, which is 16 * 1e3 m = 1.6e4 meters.

The initial angular velocity ω_initial is given as 1/(30 days). Wait, I need to convert that into radians per second. Because 1 day is 86400 seconds, so 30 days is 30 * 86400 = 2,592,000 seconds. So ω_initial is 2π / (30 * 86400) rad/s.

But we can also think in terms of the conservation of angular momentum. So:

I_initial * ω_initial = I_final * ω_final

Because I_initial * ω_initial = I_final * ω_final, so ω_final is (I_initial/I_final) * ω_initial.

But wait, I_initial is (2/5)M R_initial², and I_final is (2/5) M R_final².

So I_initial/I_final = (R_initial/R_final)^2.

So ω_final = (R_initial² / R_final²) * ω_initial.

Wait, that makes sense because if the radius is smaller, the moment of inertia decreases, so the angular velocity increases. So the neutron star would spin much faster than before.

Let me plug in the numbers.

R_initial = 7e8 m
R_final = 1.6e4 m

So R_initial/R_final = (7e8) / (1.6e4) = 7e8 / 1.6e4. Let's compute that.

7e8 / 1.6e4 = (7 / 1.6) * 1e4 = 4.375 * 1e4 = 43750.

So (R_initial/R_final)^2 is (4.375e4)^2 = (4.375)^2 * 1e8. 4.375 squared is about 19.140625. So (4.375e4)^2 = 19.140625e8 = approx 1.914e9.

But wait, actually wait. Wait, R_initial is 7e8, R_final is 1.6e4. So R_initial/R_final = (7e8)/(1.6e4) = 7/(1.6) * 1e4. 7/1.6 is 4.375, so 4.375e4. So (R_initial / R_final) = 4.375e4. Squared, that's (4.375)^2 * (1e4)^2 = approx 19.14 * 1e8 = 1.914e9.

So I_initial/I_final = (4.375e4)^2 = 1.914e9.

So ω_final = 1.914e9 * ω_initial.

But wait, ω_initial is 2π divided by the period. Let me compute ω_initial first.

ω_initial = 2π / (30 days) = 2π / (30 * 86400) s.

30 * 86400 = 2,592,000 seconds.

So ω_initial = 2π / 2.592e6 ≈ (6.2832) / 2.592e6 ≈ approx 2.418e-6 rad/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

30 days = 30 * 86400 = 2,592,000 seconds.

So ω_initial = 2π / 2,592,000.

Let me compute that: 2 * pi is approximately 6.283185307.

6.283185307 / 2,592,000 ≈ 6.283185307 / 2.592e6 ≈ 2.418e-6 rad/s.

So about 2.418e-6 rad/s.

Now, ω_final = (R_initial²/R_final²) * ω_initial = 1.914e9 * 2.418e-6 = let's compute that.

1.914e9 * 2.418e-6 = (1.914 * 2.418) * 1e3.

1.914 * 2.418 ≈ let's compute that.

2 * 2 is 4, 0.914 * 2.418 ≈ approx 2.198. So 4 + 2.198 = 6.198. So about 6.198e3 rad/s.

Wait, but that's a very high value. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1.914e9 is 1,914,000,000. Multiply by 2.418e-6 (which is 0.000002418).

So 1.914e9 * 2.418e-6 = 1.914 * 2.418 * 1e3.

Because 1e9 *1e-6 =1e3.

So 1.914 * 2.418 = let me compute accurately.

2 * 2 is 4. 1.914 * 2.418.

Compute 1.914 * 2 = 3.828.

1.914 * 0.4 = 0.7656.

1.914 *0.018= approx 0.034452.

Adding them: 3.828 + 0.7656 =4.5936 +0.034452=4.628052.

Wait, wait, 1.914 * 2.418 = 4.628.

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly: 2.418 is 2 + 0.4 + 0.018.

1.914 * 2 = 3.828.

1.914 * 0.4 = 0.7656.

1.914 * 0.018: 1.914 * 0.01=0.01914; 1.914 *0.008=0.015312. So total 0.01914 +0.015312=0.034452.

So adding them: 3.828 + 0.7656 =4.5936 +0.034452=4.628052.

So the product is approximately 4.628052.

So 1.914e9 * 2.418e-6 is 4.628e3 rad/s.

Wait, 4.628e3 = 4628 rad/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 4600. Close. So perhaps that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the initial steps.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

Another approach: The initial angular momentum is L_initial = I_initial * ω_initial.

I_initial = (2/5) M R_initial².

Similarly, I_final = (2/5) M R_final².

So ω_final = (I_initial / I_final) * ω_initial.

As (I_initial/I_final) = (R_initial²/R_final²).

So ω_final = (R_initial²/R_final²) * ω_initial.

Wait, yes. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, when the star collapses into a neutron star, the radius decreases, so the moment of inertia decreases, which would cause the angular velocity to increase (if no external torque, which is the case here).

So the neutron star's angular velocity would be higher than the original one.

Let me re-calculate R_initial and R_final.

Wait, R_initial is 7e5 km, which is 7e5 * 1e3 meters = 7e8 meters. R_final is 16 km =1.6e4 meters.

So R_initial is much larger than R_final.

So R_initial/R_final is (7e8)/(1.6e4) = 7e8 /1.6e4 = (7/1.6) * 1e4 = 4.375e4, as before.

Square of that is (4.375e4)^2 = (4.375)^2 * 1e8 = 19.140625e8 =1.914e9.

So ω_final = 1.914e9 * (2π / (30 days)).

Convert 30 days to seconds: 30 * 86400 = 2,592,000 s.

So ω_initial = 2π /2.592e6.

So ω_final = (1.914e9) * (2π / 2.592e6) = (1.914e9 *2π)/(2.592e6).

Compute that:

1.914e9 *2 = 3.828e9.

Divide by 2.592e6: (3.828e9) / 2.592e6 = (3.828 / 2.592) * 1e3.

3.828 /2.592 = approximately 1.48148.

So 1.48148e3 rad/s.

Which is 1481.48 rad/s.

Wait, that's about 1500 rad/s. Looking at the options, E is 1150, H is 1150, D is 1840.

Wait, 1481 is about 1500. Closest to E? No. E is 1150, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the ratio.

Wait, ω_final = (R_initial²/R_final²) * ω_initial.

So, (R_initial/R_final)=7e8 /1.6e4= (7e8)/(1.6e4) = (7/1.6) * 1e4 = 4.375e4.

So squared, it's (4.375e4)^2 = (4.375)^2 * (1e4)^2 = 19.140625 * 1e8 = 1.9140625e9.

So ω_final = 1.914e9 * (2π / (30 * 86400)).

So let me compute 30 * 86400 = 2,592,000.

So 2π = approximately 6.28319.

So 6.28319 / 2,592,000 ≈ let's compute: 6.28319 / 2.592e6.

6.28319 / 2.592e6 = 6.28319 / 2,592,000 ≈ 0.000002418 rad/s.

So ω_final = 1.914e9 * 0.000002418.

Multiplying:

1.914e9 * 2.418e-6 = (1.914 * 2.418) * 1e3.

Compute 1.914 * 2.418: Let's do this accurately.

2 times 1.914 is 3.828.

0.4 times 1.914 is 0.7656.

0.018 times 1.914 is 0.034452.

Adding them: 3.828 + 0.7656 = 4.5936; 4.5936 +0.034452 =4.628052.

So 1.914 * 2.418=4.628052.

Multiply by 1e3: 4.628052e3 rad/s.

Which is approximately 4628 rad/s.

Looking at the options, C is 4600. That's the closest.

Wait, but wait, the options have option C as 4600. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the neutron star's density is 1e14 times that of ordinary solid matter. Wait, am I supposed to consider that the mass remains the same? Because if the star's mass remains the same, then I can proceed as I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, if the initial and final masses are the same, then yes, the moment of inertia depends only on radius. So the calculation I did should be correct.

Another point to check: whether the radius is given in km or meters. The problem says initial radius is 7e5 km, which is 7e8 meters. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_initial/R_final. Let me compute that again.

7e8 / 1.6e4.

7e8 =700,000,000.

1.6e4=16,000.

Dividing 700,000,000 by 16,000. Let me compute that.

700,000,000 / 16,000 = (700,000,000 / 16) / 1000.

700,000,000 divided by 16 is 43,750,000.

Divide by 1000: 43,750.

So R_initial/R_final = 43,750. So squared is (43,750)^2 = (4.375e4)^2 = 19.14e8, as before.

So yes, I think the calculation is correct.

To determine the angular speed of the neutron star, we use the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum \( L \) is given by \( L = I \cdot \omega \), where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. Since the mass remains constant, the moment of inertia for a uniform solid sphere is \( I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \). For the neutron star, the initial and final moments of inertia are:

\[
I_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2}{5} M R_{\text{initial}}^2, \quad I_{\text{final}} = \frac{2}{5} M R_{\text{final}}^2.
\]

The ratio of the moments of inertia is:

\[
\frac{I_{\text{initial}}}{I_{\text{final}}} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{initial}}}{R_{\text{final}}}\right)^2.
\]

The angular velocity is related to the angular momentum by:

\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = \omega_{\text{initial}} \cdot \frac{I_{\text{initial}}}{I_{\text{final}}}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert units
The initial radius is \( R_{\text{initial}} = 7 \times 10^5 \, \text{km} = 7 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \), and the final radius is \( R_{\text{final}} = 16 \, \text{km} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of radii
\[
\frac{R_{\text{initial}}}{R_{\text{final}}} = \frac{7 \times 10^8}{1.6 \times 10^4} = \frac{7}{1.6} \times 10^4 = 4.375 \times 10^4.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the square of the ratio
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{initial}}}{R_{\text{final}}}\right)^2 = (4.375 \times 10^4)^2 = (4.375)^2 \times 10^8 = 19.14 \times 10^8 = 1.914 \times 10^9.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the initial angular velocity
The initial angular velocity is given as:
\[
\omega_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2 \pi}{T}, \quad \text{where } T = 30 \, \text{days} = 30 \times 86400 = 2.592 \times 10^6 \, \text{seconds}.
\]
\[
\omega_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2 \pi}{2.592 \times 10^6} \approx 2.418 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the final angular velocity
Using the conservation of angular momentum:
\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = \omega_{\text{initial}} \cdot \left(\frac{R_{\text{initial}}}{R_{\text{final}}}\right)^2.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = (2.418 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (1.914 \times 10^9).
\]
\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = (2.418 \cdot 1.914) \times 10^3.
\]
\[
\omega_{\text{final}} \approx 4.628 \times 10^3 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The computed angular velocity is approximately \( 4.628 \times 10^3 \, \text{rad/s} \), which is closest to option **C: 4600 rad/s**.

ANSWER: C
