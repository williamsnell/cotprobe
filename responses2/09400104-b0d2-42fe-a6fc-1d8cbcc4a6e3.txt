Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about an electric motor. I'm a bit rusty on my electrical concepts, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question says the motor is rated at 1 horsepower and operates from a 100-V line for one hour. I need to find out the current it requires and the electrical energy expended. The options are A to J, each with different current values and energy in kilowatt-hours.

Hmm, I remember that power is related to voltage, current, and resistance. Oh right, power (P) is equal to voltage (V) multiplied by current (I). So P = V * I.

Wait, but the motor's power isn't given directly. Oh, right! The motor is rated at 1 horsepower. I think I need to convert horsepower to watts because the power formula uses watts. I remember that 1 horsepower is about 746 watts. Let me double-check: yes, 1 hp = 745.7 W. So approximately 746 W.

So the power (P) of the motor is 746 W. The voltage (V) is 100 V. So plugging into P = V * I, rearranged to find I. So I = P / V.

Let me compute that: 746 W divided by 100 V. Let me do 746 ÷ 100. That's 7.46. So the current should be 7.46 A. Wait, looking at the options, option E is 7.46 A, and option J is 8.2 A. Hmm, the calculated 7.46 is closest to option E. But wait, I'm not sure if I made a mistake—maybe the motor is 1 hp, but sometimes I get confused between horsepower and other units. Oh wait, 1 hp is indeed 745.7 W, so 746 is correct.

But wait a second, the question is about the current required, not the power. So I think that's correct. So the current is 7.46 A. Now, what about the energy expended? Energy is power multiplied by time, right? So E = P * t.

The time is given as 1 hour. So 746 W * 1 hour = 746 Wh, which is 0.746 kW-hr since 1 kW is 1000 W, so 746 W * 1 hr = 0.746 kW-hr.

Looking back at the options, option E is 7.46 A and 0.746 kW-hr. So that's our current and energy. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure none are close. Let me go through each option:

Option A: 4.8 A, 0.48. That would be if the power was lower, like maybe 4.8 * 100 = 480 W, which is way below 746. No.

Option B: 9.1 A, 0.91. 9.1 *100 = 910 W, which is way higher than 746. So no.

Option C: 6.5 A, 0.65. 6.5 *100=650 W. Again lower than 746. So no.

Option D: 8.5 A, 0.85. 850 W. Still lower than 746. No.

Option E: 7.46 A, 0.746 kW-hr. We've calculated that.

Option F: 6.2 A, 0.62. 620 W. Lower than 746. Doesn't fit.

Option G:5 A, 0.5. 500 W. No.

Option H:7 A, 0.7. 700 W. No.

Option I:10 A, 1. 1000 W. No.

Option J:8.2 A, 0.82. 820 W. No.

So the only option that matches our calculations is E: 7.46 A and 0.746 kW-hr. But wait, the options don't have an exact match. Oh wait, wait—option E has exactly 7.46 A and 0.746 kw-hr. So that's the correct one.

To determine the current required by the motor and the electrical energy expended, we start by converting the motor's power rating from horsepower to watts. Since 1 horsepower equals approximately 746 watts, the motor's power is 746 W. Using the formula \( P = V \cdot I \), we can solve for current (\( I \)) as follows:

\[
I = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{746 \, \text{W}}{100 \, \text{V}} = 7.46 \, \text{A}.
\]

Next, we calculate the electrical energy expended. Energy (\( E \)) is given by \( E = P \cdot t \), where \( t \) is the time in hours. Here, \( t = 1 \, \text{hr} \), so:

\[
E = 746 \, \text{W} \cdot 1 \, \text{hr} = 746 \, \text{Wh} = 0.746 \, \text{kW-hr}.
\]

Now, we compare these calculations with the provided options:

- **Option E**: \( 7.46 \, \text{A}, 0.746 \, \text{kW-hr} \) matches our calculations exactly.
- All other options do not match the calculated values of current or energy.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: 7.46 A, 0.746 kW-hr**.
