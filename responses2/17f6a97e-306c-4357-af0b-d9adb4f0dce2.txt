Okay, so I'm looking at this question about how many people exercise regularly. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

The question states that current estimates suggest a certain percentage. I remember that regular exercise is a common goal among people, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. 

Option A says more than 90%. That seems high. I've heard that even many people feel they don't exercise enough, so maybe that's not right. 

Option B is less than 10%. That seems too low. If someone thinks less than 10% do it, that would imply that most people don't exercise regularly. But I don't think that's accurate. People probably exercise a bit more than that.

Option C is more than 50%. Hmm, maybe that's the right answer. I've read that a lot of people do regular exercise, especially those who are active or have jobs. But I'm not certain if it's more than 50% or not.

Option D is less than 80%. That's lower than C, so if C is correct, then D is too low.

Option E is exactly 50%. That doesn't make sense because the number is likely to be more than that.

Option F is more than 75%. That's higher than D but lower than C. If I think that a significant proportion does it, maybe F is possible.

Option G is less than 70%. That's lower than F, so F might not be correct.

Option H is less than 25%. That seems too low because even people who don't exercise regularly would have some level of activity or consistency.

Option I is more than 80%. That's a high number, but perhaps if a majority do it, that could be true.

Option J is less than 50%. That's lower than I, so J is not correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think about average. I've heard that around 60-70% of people get regular exercise, but that might vary. But the options don't have 60-70%. So looking back at the options, F is more than 75%, so that would be above 75%. Alternatively, C is more than 50%, which would be a higher percentage.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, which is more than 75%. Or I could be mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe it's more than 50%. Which is higher.

Wait, let me think again. The question says current estimates suggest that. So if I recall, I've heard that a majority of people do regular exercise. So maybe around 60-70%. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the closest is more than 75% (F) or more than 50% (C). Hmm.

Wait, here's another angle. If the majority of people do regular exercise, that's more than 50% (option C). But if the average is around 60%, that's higher than 50%, so C would be correct. Alternatively, if it's around 70%, then F would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the wording. The question says "how many people," so maybe it's the proportion of people. So if more than 50% do it, that's option C. But if the correct answer is more than 75%, that's option F.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to find some sources or examples. I think that while many people do exercise regularly, many also feel that they don't. So perhaps the majority (over 50%) do it, but not all. So C says more than 50%, which would be correct if the actual number is, say, 60% or 70%. But if I'm not sure, perhaps the correct answer is F, more than 75%, as that's the highest option that's possible without a clear majority.

Wait, another approach—what's the most common view? I think that the majority of people do exercise regularly. So maybe the correct answer is more than 50% (C). But wait, perhaps some people don't exercise at all, which would mean the majority is less than 100%. But that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, less than 50%, but that doesn't make sense because many people would exercise regularly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial statement. The question says 'current estimates'. So perhaps the answer is that more than 50% do it, but some say less. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, another thought. Let me consider the options again:

A: More than 90% → unlikely, since most people don't exercise enough.

B: Less than 10% → seems too low.

C: More than 50% → possible.

D: Less than 80% → lower than C.

E: Exactly 50% → not correct.

F: More than 75% → possible.

G: Less than 70% → lower.

H: Less than 25% → too low.

I: More than 80% → possible, but perhaps higher than 75% is more accurate.

J: Less than 50% → no.

So, if the majority is around 60-70%, then options F (more than 75%) or I (more than 80%) are possible, but I think 70% is more likely. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest higher number is F (more than 75%) or I (more than 80%). Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, exactly 50%, but that doesn't seem right as the majority would be higher.

Wait, but I think I've read that around 70% of the population gets regular exercise, so the closest options would be F (more than 75%) or I (more than 80%). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is the correct answer because it's less than 10%, but that seems too low. So the majority would be more than 50%, so options C or F.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess. Since the majority is more than 50%, the answer would be C. But I'm not so sure because I've heard that 60-70% is common. So if the options don't include that, perhaps F is the closest higher option, more than 75%.

Alternatively, perhaps it's I, more than 80%. But I'm not certain. Another approach: think of it as a majority. More than 50% would be the majority, so C is correct. But wait, I'm not sure if the majority is more than 75% or not.

Wait, perhaps looking for a common statistic. I think that in many places, the majority of people get regular exercise. So perhaps the correct answer is that more than 50% do, which would be option C. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, more than 75%. 

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think of it another way. The question asks what the current estimates suggest. So if I were to pick, I might lean towards option I, more than 80%, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct answer is E, less than 50%. No, that doesn't make sense because that would imply that only a small portion exercises regularly.

Wait, another thought: maybe the correct answer is F, more than 75%. Because sometimes people might have varying levels of regularity. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, exactly 50%, but that's not possible because the majority would be higher.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option F, more than 75%. Or perhaps it's C, more than 50%.

Wait, another angle. Let me think about the question again. The question is asking for how many people exercise regularly. So if more than 50% do, that's correct. But if the majority is around 60%, then more than 50% is accurate.

But if the majority is around 70%, then F is accurate as it's more than 75%. So since 70% is close to 75%, F might be the better answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, more than 80%. But I'm not sure if the majority is higher than that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I'll make a decision. Since the majority is more than 50%, options C and F are possible. But I think the correct answer is option F, more than 75%, as that's a higher percentage. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, as in, less than 50%, but that's not correct.

Wait, no, I think I've made a mistake. Let me try to recall. I remember that the majority of people do exercise regularly, but perhaps the exact number isn't a whole number. So if the majority is 50%, but that's not possible because it's a majority. So perhaps the answer is more than 50%, which would be option C. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I, more than 80%. Because sometimes people might have varying levels, but the majority would be over 50%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, less than 50%, but that's not correct.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to make a decision.

The question asks about the percentage of people who exercise regularly. The options are A to J, with C being more than 50% and F being more than 75%. The majority of people do exercise regularly, so the correct answer is likely C, as it represents a higher proportion than 50%. 

Answer: C
