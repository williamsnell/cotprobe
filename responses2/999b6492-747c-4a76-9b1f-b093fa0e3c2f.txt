Okay, so I've got this question here about peace studies in the twentieth century. I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the 20th century. There are eight options from A to H. I need to pick the one that's not correct.

First, I'll try to understand each option.

Option A: Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict. Hmm. I remember that during the Cold War, non-state actors became important, like in the 1970s. So this statement sounds plausible because non-state approaches were part of peace studies then.

Option B: At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was often called 'appeasement studies' and was opposed by critics. That rings a bell. I think during the Cold War, the so-called 'appeasement' approach was the main strategy to prevent conflict, and some scholars opposed it because it was seen as a passive response rather than a constructive one. So this seems correct.

Option C: Peace studies focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare. Wait, I remember that peace studies did move away from just nuclear options. There was a shift towards more comprehensive approaches, considering various forms of conflict and addressing them. So this statement might be incorrect.

Option D: The rise of feminism influenced peace studies in the late 20th century. Yes, feminism had a significant impact. The late 20th century saw more emphasis on women and gender roles in international relations, so that makes sense. So D is correct.

Option E: Development of peace studies included conflict prevention, resolution, and peacekeeping. I think that's accurate. Many studies focused on preventing conflicts, resolving them, and supporting peacekeeping, which ties into various alliances and regional efforts. So E is correct.

Option F: Peace studies weren't affected by Cold War events. That doesn't sound right. The Cold War had a huge influence on how peace studies viewed conflict, especially regarding nuclear issues. So F is incorrect.

Option G: In the 1970s, researchers called for broader remits but were unsuccessful. Yes, I'm pretty sure the 1970s saw calls for more inclusive approaches, and while some started, others didn't make much progress. So G is correct.

Option H: By the end of the 20th century, peace studies became a universal discipline. I remember that during the late 20th century, the field expanded beyond just academic settings. Some became more applied, like in defense and diplomacy. So H might be incorrect because it's not that it's universally accepted; it's more that it's growing and sometimes applied.

Wait, but the question is which statement is not applicable. Let me recheck.

Option C says peace studies focused solely on preventing nuclear warfare. I think that's not true because peace studies did move beyond just nuclear issues. They included issues like arms control, dialogue, and peacekeeping. So C is incorrect.

Now, the options: which is not applicable. So the correct answer is the one that's not applicable.

The question lists options A to H, and the task is to pick the statement that's not applicable.

So let's see:

- A: Correct, because non-state approaches were part of peace studies during the Cold War.

- B: Correct, because during the Cold War, 'appeasement' was opposed.

- C: Incorrect, because peace studies expanded beyond just nuclear.

- D: Correct.

- E: Correct.

- F: Incorrect.

- G: Correct.

- H: Incorrect, because by the end, it's not a universal discipline. It's more applied and diverse.

So the question is which is not applicable. So the incorrect statement is C or F or H.

Wait, the question is which is not applicable. So which of the statements is not applicable to the development of peace studies.

So:

Option C says peace studies focused solely on preventing nuclear warfare. Which is incorrect because peace studies included other areas like peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and dialogue. So C is incorrect, thus is not applicable.

Option F says peace studies weren't affected by Cold War events. That's incorrect because the Cold War was a major influence. So F is incorrect.

Option H says it became a universal discipline. Incorrect because it's not a universal discipline; it's a growing field with application in various areas.

So the question is asking which is not applicable. So all options C, F, H are incorrect. But let's see the question's wording.

The options are statements about what was or was not applicable. So which of these is not applicable.

Wait, the question is which is NOT applicable. So the correct answer is the one that is not applicable. So let me re-examine each.

The question is which statement is not applicable.

If I'm correct:

C is not applicable because peace studies didn't focus only on nuclear warfare.

F is not applicable because the Cold War did affect peace studies.

H is not applicable because it's not a universal discipline.

Wait, but the question is asking which of these statements is NOT applicable.

So perhaps more than one is not applicable. But the options are A through H, each as a statement. So the question is, which statement is not applicable.

Wait, the options are A to H, each a statement. So the question is which is not applicable.

So, for example, if option C is incorrect, then it's not applicable. Because the question is which is not applicable. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check each statement.

Option C: "Peace studies in the twentieth century focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare." Yes, that's not true. There's also peacekeeping, conflict resolution, dialogue, etc.

So C is incorrect, thus not applicable.

Option F: "The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War." That's incorrect because of the influence.

Similarly, H: "By the end of the twentieth century, peace studies had become a universally accepted academic discipline." That's incorrect because it's not a universal discipline; it's more applied.

So all three, C, F, H are incorrect. But the question is selecting which is not applicable. So the possible answers are C, F, H.

But the options are single answers, so perhaps one of them is not applicable. Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with options A-H as possible answers, each being a statement.

The question is what is not applicable. So all options C, F, H are incorrect. But perhaps the question is which is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but the question says which is not applicable. So the correct answer would be the statement that is not applicable, which is C, F, or H.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is incorrect.

Wait, no, all three of C, F, and H are incorrect. So the answer must be among these.

Wait, perhaps looking for which one is correct (applicable) and then identify which is not.

Wait, the question asks which is not applicable. So all the options except the correct ones are incorrect. But the question is giving each as a possible correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option.

Option C: "Peace studies in the twentieth century focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare." Is that correct?

No. Because peace studies didn't focus just on nuclear issues. It included a lot of other areas, like peacekeeping, conflict resolution, dialogue, etc. So C is incorrect.

Option F: "The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War." That's incorrect. The Cold War was a major influence on how peace studies viewed conflict, including issues related to nuclear deterrence and suppression.

Option H: "By the end of the twentieth century, peace studies had become a universally accepted academic discipline." No, it's not. It's more applied and has applications beyond academia, like in defense and diplomacy.

So all three (C, F, H) are statements that are not applicable. But looking back at the options, each is a possible answer, so only one of them is correct.

Wait, but the question is which of the following is not applicable. So the correct answer is the statement that is NOT applicable, which would be any of C, F, H.

Wait, but the multiple-choice question is asking for the statement that is not applicable. So all of these are incorrect, but perhaps the intended answer is one of them. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps looking for the correct answer as the answer.

Wait, the correct answer is the incorrect statement, which options are not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's incorrect.

Wait, but the question is, which statement is not applicable.

So all three are incorrect, but the options are A to H.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as which statement is NOT applicable, so the correct answer is one of the incorrect options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's incorrect.

But wait, the options are the possible answers, so the correct answer is the one that's incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The question is asking which statement is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the 20th century.

So, let's list each statement and assess.

Option A: Correct. During the Cold War, non-state actors were more important, so peace studies looked at that.

Option B: Correct. Apples to apples. 'Appeasement studies' were prevalent, and critics opposed.

Option C: Incorrect. Peace studies included more areas than just nuclear.

Option D: Correct. feminism influenced the field.

Option E: Correct. Many areas, including peacekeeping, were part of studies.

Option F: Incorrect. The Cold War did influence peace studies.

Option G: Correct. The 1970s saw broader remits.

Option H: Incorrect. Peace studies weren't universal; it's more applied.

So, the incorrect statements are C, F, H.

But the question is asking which is not applicable. So all of these are not applicable.

Wait, but that's a problem because the options are single letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps only one is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is not applicable. So the incorrect statements would be the ones that are not applicable.

So the correct answer would be the incorrect statement.

Wait, the question is about which of these is not applicable. So the correct answer is the one that is incorrect.

Wait, but none of the options are correct. Hmm. Maybe I should think about each option.

Another approach: which statements are correct and which are incorrect.

Looking for which statement is not applicable.

Option C: If the twentieth century's peace studies focused solely on nuclear warfare, that's incorrect because peace studies included other areas.

Option F: The events of the Cold War did affect peace studies, so F is incorrect.

Option H: The field was not universally accepted, so H is incorrect.

Thus, the question is which of the given options is not applicable. So any of these three is an option.

But the question is a multiple-choice question, so one of them is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's not applicable.

Wait, but the options are A to H. So the correct answer is C, F, or H.

Wait, but perhaps only one of them is incorrect. Let me read the options again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option's correctness.

Option C: "Peace studies in the twentieth century focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare." I think this is incorrect because peace studies included a lot more than just nuclear issues. So C is not applicable.

Therefore, the answer is C.

To determine which statement is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict." This is correct because non-state approaches were prominent during the Cold War.

- **Option B**: "At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was frequently labelled 'appeasement studies' and was bitterly opposed by critics." This is correct as the so-called "appeasement" strategy was a major focus, and critics opposed it.

- **Option C**: "Peace studies in the twentieth century focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare." This is incorrect because peace studies expanded beyond nuclear issues, encompassing peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and dialogue.

- **Option D**: "The development of peace studies was largely influenced by the rise of feminism in the late twentieth century." This is correct as feminism had a significant impact on the field.

- **Option E**: "Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping." This is correct as these areas were prominent.

- **Option F**: "The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War." This is incorrect because the Cold War had a substantial influence on peace studies.

- **Option G**: "By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts." This is correct as the 1970s saw calls for inclusive approaches.

- **Option H**: "By the end of the twentieth century, peace studies had become a universally accepted academic discipline." This is incorrect because peace studies is not universally accepted but is growing and applied in various contexts.

Among the options, **Option C** and **Option F** are clearly incorrect. However, the question asks for the statement that is not applicable, and since the options are single letters, the intended answer is likely **Option C**, as it directly contradicts the established understanding of peace studies' focus during the twentieth century.

ANSWER: C
