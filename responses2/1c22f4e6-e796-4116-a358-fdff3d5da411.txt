Okay, so I have this problem about work done by a force. Hmm, let's see. The question says that F is a constant unit force parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1). The particle moves along the path (t, t², t³) from t=0 to t=1. I need to find the work done by F on the particle.

Wait, I remember that work done by a force is calculated by the integral of the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector. Oh right, the formula is W = ∫ F · dr from t=0 to t=1.

But wait, since F is a constant vector, I can factor it out of the integral. So W = F · ∫ dr, where dr is the differential displacement along the path.

So first, I need to find the displacement vector dr. Since the particle moves along (t, t², t³), the displacement at any time t would be the derivative of the position with respect to t. The position function is r(t) = (t, t², t³), so dr/dt is (1, 2t, 3t²). Therefore, dr = (1, 2t, 3t²) dt. 

Wait, but for the integral, I can write dr as (dx, dy, dz) which in terms of dt: dx = 1 dt, dy = 2t dt, dz = 3t² dt. Wait, but when integrating dr, it's just (dx, dy, dz), so the integral is ∫ (1, 2t, 3t²) dt from 0 to 1. 

So let's compute that integral. The integral of 1 dt from 0 to 1 is 1. The integral of 2t dt is t² evaluated from 0 to 1, which is 1. The integral of 3t² dt is t³ multiplied by 3, evaluated at 1 and 0. So 3(1³) - 0 = 3. So the total integral is (1, 1, 3).

Wait, wait. No, wait. The integral of dr is the sum of the integrals of each component. So ∫ dr = ∫ (dx, dy, dz) = ( ∫ dx, ∫ dy, ∫ dz ). So that's (1, 1, 3).

But wait, no. Because dr is (dx, dy, dz) = (1 dt, 2t dt, 3t² dt). So integrating each component separately:

∫ dx = ∫ 1 dt from 0 to1 = 1
∫ dy = ∫ 2t dt from 0 to1 → t² evaluated at 1 (which is 1) minus at 0 (0) → 1
∫ dz = ∫3t² dt from 0 to1 → t³ evaluated at 1: 1³=1, so 3(1) - 0 =3.

So ∫ dr from 0 to1 is (1, 1, 3). Because the integral is a vector, right? So the integral of dr is a vector, which is (1,1,3).

Wait, no. Wait, the integral of dr is the displacement vector. So yes, integrating dr gives (1,1,3) as the displacement from t=0 to t=1.

But wait, wait, no. Because dr is the differential displacement, so the integral of dr from 0 to1 is the total displacement. So yes, the displacement is (1,1,3). So the integral ∫ dr from 0 to1 is (1,1,3).

But wait, no. Wait, because dr is (dx, dy, dz), which are each functions of t. So the integral of dr is the integral of each component. So for each component, ∫ from 0 to1 of dx is ∫0→1 1 dt →1. ∫ dy is ∫0→1 2t dt → t² at 1 is 1, so 1. ∫ dz is ∫0→1 3t² dt → t³ is 1, so 3*(1) =3. So the integral of dr is (1,1,3). 

Wait, but wait: no, because the integral of dr is (dx, dy, dz) integrated. So the integral is ( ∫ dx, ∫ dy, ∫ dz ) → (1, 1, 3). So the displacement vector is (1,1,3). 

But when I think about this, the integral of dr from 0 to1 is the total change in position. So the displacement is (1,1,3). So the integral of dr is (1,1,3).

Now, the force F is a constant unit vector parallel to (-1,0,1). So first, I need to find the unit vector in the direction of (-1,0,1).

The vector is (-1,0,1). Its magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 )= sqrt(1+0+1)=sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

Since F is a unit force, the vector F is equal to this unit vector. So F = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

Now, the work done is F · displacement. Because the force is constant, the work is the dot product of F and the displacement vector.

Wait, no. Wait, the displacement vector is (1,1,3). So let me compute the dot product.

F · displacement = [ (-1/sqrt(2)) *1 ] + [0 *1 ] + [ (1/sqrt(2)) *3 ].

So that's (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (3/sqrt(2)).

Adding those together: (-1 +3)/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Wait, that's positive sqrt(2). But looking at the options, option J is sqrt(2). But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the direction matters. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the dot product.

F = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), displacement is (1,1,3).

So F · displacement = ( (-1/sqrt(2)) *1 ) + (0 *1) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) *3 ).

Which is -1/sqrt(2) + 0 + 3/sqrt(2) = ( -1 +3 ) / sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So the work done is sqrt(2). So the answer would be option J: sqrt(2).

To calculate the work done by the constant unit force **F** on a particle moving along the path **r(t) = (t, t², t³)** from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \), we use the formula:

\[
W = \int_{0}^{1} \mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \, dt
\]

### Step 1: Determine the force vector **F**
The force **F** is a unit vector parallel to \( \mathbf{v} = (-1, 0, 1) \). The unit vector in the direction of \( \mathbf{v} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{(-1, 0, 1)}{\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{(-1, 0, 1)}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the force vector is:

\[
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{u} = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Compute the differential displacement \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \)
The position vector is \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t^2, t^3) \). Differentiating with respect to \( t \):

\[
\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \left( \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt} \right) = (1, 2t, 3t^2)
\]

### Step 3: Compute the dot product \( \mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \)
The dot product is:

\[
\mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \cdot (1, 2t, 3t^2)
\]

\[
= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 2t + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 3t^2
\]

\[
= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 + \frac{3t^2}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

\[
= \frac{3t^2 - 1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Step 4: Integrate to find the work done
The work done is:

\[
W = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{3t^2 - 1}{\sqrt{2}} \, dt
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \int_{0}^{1} (3t^2 - 1) \, dt
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ t^3 - t \right]_{0}^{1}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1^3 - 1) - (0^3 - 0) \right]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 = 0
\]

### Final Answer:
The work done by the force is \( 0 \).
