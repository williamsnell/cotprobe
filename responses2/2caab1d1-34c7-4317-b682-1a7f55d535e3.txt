Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Shapiro's claims and longitudinal studies regarding illegal drug use. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's break it down.

The question is asking which statement Shapiro claims is confirmed by longitudinal studies. Shapiro's statement is that surveys indicate certain patterns from older studies. The options are A to J.

I remember from my studies that Shapiro's work was about substance use and its changes over time. He's been a big name in this area, right? Longitudinal studies are those that follow individuals over time, tracking changes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Use of illegal drugs is usually temporary in adolescence. I'm not sure about this. Longitudinal studies might show that it's sometimes short-lived, but I don't recall it being a confirmed statement. Maybe it's more of a general observation rather than a confirmed claim.

Option B: Most individuals experiment but don't continue. That sounds plausible. It suggests a switch from using to not using, which is a common pattern.

Option C: Excessive use is the norm. I don't think that's correct. There might be exceptions, and I don't recall studies showing excessive as the norm.

Option D: Use inevitably diminishes. This seems too strong. I think there are cases where people might use again, especially if they're in recovery or if relapse is possible. So this might not be accurate.

Option E: Those who start using typically stop before addiction. That sounds right. Many people begin using, but they don't stop until they become addicted. So this is a commonly accepted statement.

Option F: Studies show no consistent patterns. I don't think Shapiro supports this. He's known to have documented patterns, including the transition from use to dependency.

Option G: Users transition to legal substances. I'm not sure about this. Shapiro's focus was on illegal drugs, but maybe he did talk about substance use and its effects, which could influence the choice of legal substances. But the option says transition to legal, which might not be his main claim.

Option H: Moderate use is norm. Shapiro did mention that moderate use is common, so this seems correct.

Option I: Those who begin stop until addiction. That's similar to E, but Shapiro's claim is about continuing to diminish, not stopping. So I think E is more accurate.

Option J: Excessive is norm. As I thought earlier, this might not be supported.

Putting it together: Shapiro's statement that surveys show that illegal drugs are usually temporary. Wait, option A says it's usually a temporary phase in adolescence. I don't think that's a confirmed study. Longitudinal studies might show that it's more of a short-term use, but it's not a strict norm for all ages.

Wait, maybe option E is correct. Another thought: in Shapiro's work, it's about the transition from use to addiction. So, individuals who start using drugs typically don't stop until they become addicted. So option E and H are both about the transition from use to dependency.

Shapiro said that most individuals experiment but don't continue until they become addicted. So E says they typically stop before addiction. H says moderate use is norm. Both are correct, but which is the best option.

Looking back at the options, E states that those who begin using typically stop before addiction. That's a common statement in substance use research. Shapiro's work supports that E is correct. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but another thought: what about Shapiro's claim that excessive use is the norm? That's option J. However, I don't think Shapiro's studies confirmed that. His focus was more on the transition from use to addiction, not the overall excessive use being common.

So the correct answer is E and H. But which one is an option? Looking at the options, E is: those who begin using typically do not stop until they become addicted. H is: moderate and/or controlled use is the norm.

I think Shapiro's claim is about the transition, so E is correct. But I'm a bit confused because I've read that Shapiro's main points are about the switch from use to addiction, but I'm not entirely sure which option is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which statement Shapiro claims is confirmed by longitudinal studies.

Option E: Those who begin using typically do not stop until they become addicted. This is correct.

Option H: Moderate and/or controlled use is the norm. This is also a correct statement, but Shapiro's focus was more on the transition from use to dependency, not necessarily that moderate is the norm. So H might not be the best fit.

I think E is correct because Shapiro's work includes that. So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E: "Those who begin using illegal drugs typically do not stop until they become addicted."

**Explanation:**
Shapiro's claim is supported by longitudinal studies, which indicate that individuals who start using illegal drugs typically do not quit until they become addicted. This aligns with option E, which accurately reflects Shapiro's assertion. Other options, such as A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, and J are either incorrect or less directly supported by Shapiro's claims. Therefore, option E is the best choice.
