Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about holidays and their dates. The question is asking which holiday isn't attached to a specific date. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the one that doesn't have a fixed date. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, I'll list out all the holidays and their typical dates. I remember some of these from my childhood, but I should think carefully to make sure I'm correct.

Option A: Thanksgiving. I know this is usually around November 22nd or thereabouts. So that's a specific date.

Option B: Memorial Day. I think this is around May 25th. Yes, definitely a specific date.

Option C: Valentine's Day. This is February 14th. Fixed date, so it's not the answer.

Option D: Independence Day. This is always on the first Sunday in August, which is around July 4th. So it's not fixed.

Option E: New Year's Day. Typically January 1st, but it can be in January or February depending on the year. So this is not a specific date.

Option F: Halloween. This is in October, usually around October 31st. So specific date.

Option G: Easter. This is variable, depending on the date of the Paschal full moon, so it's not a fixed date.

Option H: Christmas. It's on December 25th this year, but also on December 25th last year, so not a specific date.

Option I: Labor Day. This is the first Monday in September, so it varies each year. So it's not fixed.

Option J: St. Patrick's Day. This is on March 17th, which is fixed.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't get any of these wrong. Let me think again. For example, New Year's can be January 1 or January 2, which varies. Similarly, Easter depends on the Paschal full moon. Independence Day is always the same, but New Year's isn't. So the question is about which is not attached to a specific date. 

Looking back, option E is New Year's Day, which isn't fixed because it can be in January or February. The other options all have specific dates. 

Wait, the question is which is not attached to a specific date. So the correct answer would be the one without a fixed date. So among the options, E is the holiday that doesn't have a fixed date. So the correct answer is E: New Year's Day.

The holiday that isn't attached to a specific date is New Year's Day (Option E), as it can occur in January or February depending on the year.

Answer: E
