Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a fair coin is tossed 50 times, and we need to find the upper bound on the probability that the number of heads is either greater than 35 or less than 15 using Chebyshev's Inequality. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember Chebyshev's Inequality is useful for finding probabilities when we don't know the mean and standard deviation, or when the distribution isn't normal. But wait, isn't there a specific formula for Chebyshev's? Let me try to recall. Oh right, the inequality states that for any random variable with finite mean μ and variance σ², the probability that it deviates from μ by more than k standard deviations is at most 1/k². So, mathematically, it's P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k².

But in this problem, we're dealing with a binomial distribution since each coin toss is a Bernoulli trial. So, the number of heads in 50 tosses follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=50 and p=0.5. 

First, I need to calculate the expected value (mean) and variance to find the standard deviation. For a binomial distribution, the mean μ is n*p, and the variance σ² is n*p*(1-p). 

So, μ = 50 * 0.5 = 25. The variance σ² = 50 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 12.5. Therefore, the standard deviation σ is sqrt(12.5) which is approximately 3.5355.

Now, the question is about the probability that the number of heads is either less than 15 or greater than 35. So, we're looking at P(X < 15) + P(X > 35). Since the coin is fair, the distribution is symmetric around 25, so I can think about how far 15 and 35 are from the mean.

Wait, 15 is 10 less than 25 (25-15=10). And 35 is 10 more than 25 (35-25=10). So, each of these is 10 units away from the mean.

Now, I need to find how many standard deviations 10 is. So, 10 divided by σ. σ is about 3.5355, so 10 / 3.5355 is approximately 2.828. Oh, that's roughly 2.83 standard deviations away.

But Chebyshev's Inequality doesn't tell us the exact probability, just an upper bound. The inequality says P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². So, in this case, k is about 2.83. Let's compute 1/(2.83)^2. 

Calculating 2.83 squared: 2.83 * 2.83. Let me compute that. 2 * 2 is 4, 2 * 0.83 is 1.66, 0.83 * 2 is 1.66, and 0.83 * 0.83 is about 0.6889. Wait, that's not the right way to multiply. Let me actually compute 2.83 * 2.83:

(2 + 0.83)^2 = 2² + 2*2*0.83 + (0.83)^2 = 4 + 3.32 + 0.6889 = 8.0089. So, 1/(2.83^2) is approximately 1/8.0089 ≈ 0.1248.

Wait, that's about 0.125. Looking at the options, option C is 0.125. But wait, let me make sure I did the calculations right. So, the standard deviation is sqrt(12.5) ≈ 3.5355. So, 10/3.5355 ≈ 2.828, which is around 2.828. So, (2.828)^2 is approximately 8.000 (exactly 8, I think? Because 2.828 is sqrt(8), because sqrt(8) is about 2.8284. So, (sqrt(8))^2 is 8. So, 1/(sqrt(8))² = 1/8 = 0.125. So, the upper bound would be 0.125. 

But wait, the options include 0.125 as option C. So, the answer should be C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the exact binomial distribution. But Chebyshev's gives an upper bound, so it's the safe choice. So, the upper bound is 12.5%.

The probability that the number of heads in 50 tosses of a fair coin is either greater than 35 or less than 15 can be bounded using Chebyshev's Inequality. The mean (μ) is 25, and the variance (σ²) is 12.5, giving a standard deviation (σ) of approximately 3.5355. The number of heads is 10 units away from the mean on either side, which is about 2.828σ. Using Chebyshev's Inequality, the upper bound is 1/(2.828)² ≈ 0.125.
