Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack selling magazine subscriptions. Let me read it again. Jack sells subscriptions door to door, gets 85 cents commission each sale. Last week, he sold 17 subscriptions. The question is asking what his total commission was, and there are several options to choose from.

Hmm, commission usually means a percentage of the sale price, but in this case, it's a flat 85 cents per subscription. So each sale gives him 85 cents. So to find the total, I just need to multiply the number of subscriptions sold by the commission per subscription.

Let's do the math. 85 cents is the same as $0.85. So 17 subscriptions multiplied by $0.85. Let me calculate that. 

First, 10 subscriptions would be 10 * 0.85 = $8.50. Then 7 subscriptions would be 7 * 0.85. Let's see, 7 times 0.8 is 5.6, and 7 times 0.05 is 0.35. So 5.6 + 0.35 is 5.95. So together, 17 subscriptions would be 8.50 + 5.95, which is $14.45.

Looking at the options, option B is $14.45. That must be the correct answer. Let me double-check: 17 * 0.85. Alternatively, 17 * 0.85 equals 14.45. Yep, that's correct.

The total commission is calculated by multiplying the number of subscriptions sold by the commission rate. 

**Computation:**
17 subscriptions * $0.85 per subscription = $14.45.

**Answer: B: $14.45**
