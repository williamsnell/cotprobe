Okay, so I have this quadratic equation to solve: x squared minus five x plus six equals zero. I remember that quadratic equations can have two solutions, and the quadratic formula is a reliable method to find them. But wait, let me think through each step carefully.

First, the quadratic formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a. Right? So for the equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the values are plugged into this formula.

In this case, the equation is x² -5x +6=0. Comparing to the standard form, a is 1, because the coefficient of x squared is 1. Then b is -5, because the coefficient of x is -5. And c is 6.

So putting these into the quadratic formula: x equals negative (-5) plus or minus the square root of (-5) squared minus four times 1 times 6, over two times 1. Let me compute each part step by step.

Negative of -5 is 5, so that part is positive 5. Then, the discriminant inside the square root: (-5)^2 is 25. Four times a is 4*1=4, and 4*1*6 is 24. So 25 minus 24 is 1. The square root of 1 is just 1.

So now we have x equals 5 plus or minus 1, all over 2. That gives two solutions: one when we add 1 to 5, which is 6, and one when we subtract 1, which is 4. So the solutions are x = 6 and x =4.

Looking at the options, option E is x=1 and x=6. Wait, no, that's not what I got. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me double-check. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, because the quadratic formula gives x = [5 ± sqrt(1)] / 2. So 5 plus 1 is 6, divided by 2 is 3, and 5 minus 1 is 4, divided by 2 is 2. Oh, wait, wait a second. That would give x=3 and x=2. Oh, but in the options, E is x=1 and x=6. Hmm. Did I mess up the signs?

Wait, let's go back. The equation is x² -5x +6=0. So a is 1, b is -5, c is 6.

Quadratic formula: x = [5 ± sqrt(25 -24)] / 2. So sqrt(1) is 1. So x = (5 +1)/2 =6/2=3 and x=(5-1)/2=4/2=2. So the solutions are x=3 and x=2. Looking at the options, option G is x=2.5 and x=-2.4. That doesn't match. Option E is x=1 and x=6—no, that can't be right. Option F is 3 and 4. Wait, wait, no, F is x=3 and x=4. But according to my calculation, x=3 and x=2. Hmm. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, no, because the quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a). So in this case, b is -5, so -b is 5. So that's correct. So 5 plus and minus 1. So when I compute, the two solutions are (5+1)/2=3 and (5-1)/2=2. So the roots are 3 and 2.

Looking at the options, option G is x=2.5 and x=-2.4. That's not matching. Option F is x=3 and x=4. Wait, why would that be? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait, is the equation x² -5x +6=0 correct? Let me recompute the discriminant. b squared is (-5)^2=25. 4ac is 4*1*6=24. So 25-24=1. So sqrt(1)=1. So x=(5 ±1)/2. So 5+1 is 6, divided by 2 is 3. 5-1 is 4, divided by 2 is 2. Thus, x=3 and x=2. So the correct solutions are 3 and 2.

Looking again at the options, none of the options have 3 and 2 except for option F. Wait, option F says x=3 and x=4. Wait, how? Let me check if I did the formula correctly. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-examine the formula.

Quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a). So for this equation, a=1, b=-5, c=6.

So plugging in: x = [-(-5) ± sqrt(25 -24)] / 2. So this is [5 ±1]/2.

So 5+1=6, divided by 2 is 3. 5-1=4, divided by 2 is 2. So two solutions: 3 and 2. So the correct answer options should be option F, which is x=3 and x=4? Wait, no, option F is x=3 and x=4, but that's not matching. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait no, wait, I'm getting x=3 and x=2, so option F is 3 and 4. So perhaps I messed up in the calculation. Let's check the equation again. Wait, another approach: factoring the quadratic.

x²-5x+6 factors into (x-2)(x-3)=0. So the solutions are x=2 and x=3. So the correct roots are 2 and 3, which would match option F if it is x=2 and x=3. But option F says x=3 and x=4. Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me re-calculate the discriminant again. The equation is x² -5x +6=0. So a=1, b=-5, c=6. Discriminant is b² -4ac = (−5)² -4*1*6=25-24=1. So square root is 1. So x=(5±1)/2. That gives (5+1)/2=6/2=3, and (5-1)/2=4/2=2. So x=3 and x=2. Now, looking at the options, I don't see an option with 3 and 2. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: x = -1 and x = 6

B: x = 0 and x = 6

C: x = 1 and x = 2

D: x = 3 and x = 2

E: x = 1 and x = 6

F: x = 3 and x = 4

G: x = 2.5 and x = -2.4

H: x = -2 and x = -3

I: x = 4 and x = 5

So option D is x=3 and x=2. So that should be the correct answer. So why am I confused?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the quadratic formula. Let me double-check the formula. The quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a). So for this equation, a=1, b=-5, c=6.

So -b would be 5. So the numerator is 5 plus or minus the square root of 1. So 5+1=6, 5-1=4. Divided by 2, gives 3 and 2. So correct.

So the correct solution is x=3 and x=2, which is option D. So I think I was confused earlier because I thought the options had F as 3 and 4, but that's not correct. So the correct answer is option D.
</think>

The quadratic equation is x² -5x +6=0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [5 ±1]/2, which gives x=3 and x=2. The correct option is D.
