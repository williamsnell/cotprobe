Okay, so I've got this logic problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to deductive reasoning, so I need to take it slow.

The question says: All students who attend the Peddie School study Latin. Some students who study Latin also study calculus. Then, it tells me that Jerome is a student at the Peddie School. So I need to figure out what can be determined from this information.

Let me jot down the given information:

1. All Peddie School students study Latin. So, if someone is in the Peddie School, they must be studying Latin. That's a universal statement. So, for any x, if x is in the Peddie School, then x studies Latin.
2. Some Latin students also study calculus. So, there exists at least one person who studies both Latin and calculus. This is a particular statement, saying "some" but not necessarily all.
3. Jerome is a student at the Peddie School. So, this means we can apply the first point to him.

Now, let's see what we can deduce about Jerome. Since he's at the Peddie School, from point 1, we know he studies Latin. So that's one fact: he studies Latin. So that would eliminate any option that says he doesn't study Latin. Looking at the options:

Option B: studies Latin — this is possible.
Option D: studies calculus — not sure yet.
Option A: doesn't study calculus — possible, but needs more info.
Option E: studies calculus but not Latin — no, he studies Latin.
Option H: studies neither — no, he studies Latin.

So, from the first point, we can be certain that B is correct. But the question is asking what can be determined. So, perhaps there's more to it.

The second point says some Latin students also study calculus. So, there's at least one student who is both Latin and calculus. But what about others? It doesn't specify how many or which ones, just that some do.

Since we know that all Peddie School students study Latin, and all these students (including Jerome) are Latin students, then for those in the Peddie School, at least some are calculus students. But we don't know if any of them are both. It could be that all of them are, or none are. But the second point says some do. So, at least one, but not necessarily all.

So, for example, if we have a group of students in the Peddie School, maybe only some of them study calculus. We don't know the exact numbers, but we know that for all of them, they study Latin.

Now, considering that, what can we conclude about Jerome? Well, we know he studies Latin. So he's in the set of Latin students. But in the Latin group, some also study calculus. So, it's possible that he does study calculus, but it's not guaranteed. Because "some" can mean just one or more. So, it's possible that only he studies calculus, or maybe more. But from the given info, we can't say for sure.

Wait, but the question is asking "It can therefore be determined that..." So looking at the options, option B says he studies Latin. That's definitely true. So, B is a correct conclusion, and it's the only one that's a certain fact.

But wait, looking again at the options, option D says he studies calculus. But we can't be certain. Because the second point only says that some Latin students study calculus. So, maybe he doesn't. So, can we conclude that he studies calculus? No, because the given information doesn't specify that all Latin students study calculus. It's just some.

So, the only certain conclusion is that he studies Latin. So, that's option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. All Peddie School students study Latin. So any student in the Peddie School, including Jerome, studies Latin. So, no doubt, B is correct.

But wait, looking back at the question, it says "It can therefore be determined that..." Looking at the options, option B is true. So, the correct answer is B.

B: Jerome studies Latin.
