Question:

Explain the types and effects of competition.

Options:

A: Competition is the active demand of two or more organisms for a common vital resource. It can be categorized into Contest competition and Scramble competition.
B: Competition is a cooperative interaction where organisms work together to maximize resource use.
C: Competition only involves physical confrontation.
D: Competition is solely determined by the availability of water resources.
E: Competition is an interaction that only occurs within a species, known as Intraspecific competition.
F: Competition can be categorized into Predation competition and Mutualism competition.
G: Competition is a natural process that always results in the extinction of one species.

Okay, so I've got this question about competition. Hmm. Let me think. I remember that competition is a concept in biology, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to piece it together.

The question is asking about the types and effects of competition. The options are A through G. So I need to identify which option correctly describes competition.

First, I recall that competition can be divided into two main types. One is Contest competition, which I think is when organisms compete for exclusive resources that are very valuable. Like, if you're the only one eating a particular type of food, you might have less of it. The other type is Scramble competition, where organisms compete for resources that are shared. So maybe that's what option A says. It mentions active demand for a common resource and categorizes into Contest and Scramble. Wait, but I think Contest and Scramble are the two main types, so A seems correct for the types.

Now, effects. I'm trying to remember. For Contest competition, it's often about survival—like if you're the only one eating that food, you might not get as much, which can lead to lower fitness. So that affects the population's size. That makes sense because if you're the only one, you might not get enough resources to reproduce.

Scramble competition would be more about resource sharing. So if you're part of a group that shares water, you might have less. That can also affect the population's size because if your share is smaller, you might not contribute as much to the group's resources. So both types affect the populations negatively. That would be the effects part.

Looking at the options, option A covers both types and effects. Let me check the rest to see if they fit.

Option B says competition is a cooperative interaction. Wait, I think that's not right. Co-operation usually happens in mutualism, where two organisms benefit from each other. Competition isn't cooperative; it's the opposite. So B is incorrect.

Option C says competition only involves physical confrontation. No, that's not true. Physical competition is part of it, but there's also vocal competition, where sounds can influence who takes the resource. Also, in some cases, like in plants, they might not fight but compete for space. So C is too narrow.

Option D: Determined by water resources. Well, competition can be a result of limited resources, but it's not the cause. The availability of water would be a factor, but competition itself isn't determined by it. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Intra-specific competition. Wait, intra means within the same species. I remember that species can have both types of competition—like within a species, some might compete for the same resources, like food. But not all. So E says it's only within a species, which is true. But the question is about types and effects, so E is a correct statement about its occurrence but not the cause of it.

Option F: Predation and mutualism. I'm not sure. Predation is a type of competition, but mutualism is a different interaction. So F seems incorrect because F is mixing two different types. Or maybe I'm confusing. Wait, mutualism is a type of interaction where two species benefit from each other. Predation is when one organism kills another. So F isn't correct because it's not about competition but other interactions.

Option G: Extinction due to competition. That sounds correct. Because when resources are limited, organisms can't all survive. That leads to some going extinct. So G is a correct statement, but it's about the result of competition, not the type or effects.

So looking back at the options, the question is asking about the types and effects. So which options address both?

Option A: Types are Contest and Scramble; effects are about reducing population size. That's exactly what the question is asking about.

Option F is incorrect because it's mixing two different types of interactions.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is **A: Competition is the active demand of two or more organisms for a common vital resource. It can be categorized into Contest competition and Scramble competition.**

### Explanation:
- **Contest Competition:** This occurs when organisms compete for exclusive resources, such as food, which are highly valuable. For example, if you're the only one eating a specific type of food, you might not get as much, reducing your fitness.
  
- **Scramble Competition:** This involves competing for shared resources, such as water. If you're part of a group that shares water, your share might be smaller, leading to lower resource use and potentially lower fitness.

- **Effects of Competition:** Both types of competition negatively impact populations by reducing their size. For instance, in Contest competition, the pressure on your food may limit your ability to reproduce, while in Scramble competition, limited water availability could limit your ability to survive or reproduce.

Other options are incorrect because they either mischaracterize the types of competition or confuse them with other interactions like predation or mutualism.
