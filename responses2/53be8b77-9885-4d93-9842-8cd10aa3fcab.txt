Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about chlorine gas reacting most readily with certain substances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking which of the given options is the best candidate for the reaction of chlorine gas. The options are butane, ethylene, acetic acid, toluene, ethanol, propane, ethane, ethanoic acid, and benzene.

Wait, I remember that chloroacids are usually reactive towards alkynes. Like acetic acid is a chloroacetic acid. Oh right, chlorides of acyl halogens react readily with alkynes. So maybe one of these options is an alkyne.

Looking at the options, option G is ethane. Wait, ethane is C2H6, which is an alkane, not an alkyne. Alkynes are H2C=CH2, like ethene? No, wait, ethene is C2H4. Ethyne is C2H2, but that's an alkyne. Wait, what's ethane? C2H6. So none of the options except maybe D: ethanol?

Wait, ethanol is C2H5OH, which is an alkene (since it's CH2CH2OH). But wait, the question is about the reactivity. So what's the reactivity of these things with Cl2.

I think that chlorides of alkynes are more reactive than those of alkanes. So for example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts readily with ethane (C2H6) and ethyne (C2H2), but less so with alkanes like ethane (C2H6) maybe?

Wait, I think if I remember correctly, chlorides of alkynes react more readily than those of alkanes. So ethene (C2H4) reacts less than ethane (C2H6) with chlorides. But wait, the question is about the reactivity of chlorine gas with the substances. So which of these substances reacts best with Cl2.

Wait, maybe acetic acid (option C) reacts with ethane, ethyne, and alkanes. Because it's a chloroacetic acid. So, perhaps, the most reactive is with ethane or ethyne. But wait, ethyne is C2H2. So, maybe ethane (option G) is the best match. Or is it ethyne?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Chloride of acyl halogens (like chloroacetic acid) react with alkenes and alkynes. So the reactivity order is such that alkynes react more readily than alkanes. So, in the given options, which is an alkyne? Let me look:

Options: G is ethane (C2H6, an alkane), D is ethanol (C2H5OH, an alkene), F is propane (C3H8, alkane), E is ethanol, A is butane (C4H10, alkane), B is ethylene (C2H4, alkene), H is ethanoic acid (CH3COOH, which is a chloroacetic acid), I is benzene (C6H6, aromatic).

Wait, so the alkyne would be option G. But wait, the question is about chlorine gas reacting most readily. So which of these would react the most quickly with Cl2.

Wait, chloroacetic acid (option H) would react with ethane, ethyne, and alkanes. So if the question is which is the best candidate, perhaps H is the answer because it's a strong chloroacetic acid, which is a good reagent for alkynes.

Another point: chlorides of alkynes are more reactive than alkane chlorides. So the best choice would be an alkyne. But looking at the options, option G is ethane (C2H6, alkane), so maybe H.

Wait, but H is ethanoic acid, which is CH3COOH. That's a chloroacetic acid. So when Cl2 reacts with H, it would probably react with ethyne (G) as well. So which one reacts more readily? Since ethyne is an alkyne, it's more reactive.

Wait, but the options for the reacting substance are which of the given options. So the reactivity of Cl2 with each is as follows:

- Butane (A) and propane (F): Alkanes, probably less reactive.

- Ethylene (B) and ethane (G): Alkenes, maybe less than alkynes.

- Ethanoic acid (H) and benzene (I): Chloroacetic acid is a strong chloroacetic acid, so it reacts readily with alkynes.

So, the best candidate would be H, ethanoic acid, which is a chloroacetic acid, and reacts with alkynes.

Wait, but wait! Wait, I think I might have mixed up the reactivity. Chloroacetic acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid, so it's more reactive towards alkynes. So, perhaps option H is correct.

Alternatively, Cl2 reacts with ethyne (G) more readily than with alkanes. So ethyne (option G) would be the best candidate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the general reaction of chlorides of acyl halogens. They react with alkynes more readily than alkanes. So for example, ethanoic acid (H) is a chloroacetic acid, so it reacts well with ethyne (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), and alkanes. So the reactivity is highest with alkynes.

So, which of the options is an alkyne? Ethyne (C2H2) is option G. So, the correct answer would be G: ethyne.

Wait, but wait, the question is about chlorine gas reacting most readily with which of the options. So, when chlorine gas reacts with ethyne, it would form HCl (ethyne + Cl2 → ethyl chloride). But if it reacts with ethane, perhaps it forms CH3CH2Cl. Both are possible, but perhaps the reactivity is higher with ethyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reactivity is in the order of alkynes being more reactive than alkanes. So, the correct answer would be option G: ethyne, which is an alkyne and reacts more readily with chlorine gas than alkanes.

So, the answer should be G: ethyne.

To determine which substance chlorine gas (Cl₂) reacts most readily with, we analyze the reactivity of the given options in the context of chloroacids and alkynes. Chlorine gas reacts most readily with compounds containing alkynes, as they are more reactive toward chloroacetic acids. This is due to the strong electrophilic nature of the alkyne's π bond in chloroacetic acids like ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH), which is a chloroacetic acid.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Butane (A)** and **propane (F)**: Both are alkane molecules, which are less reactive towards chloroacetic acids compared to alkynes.
2. **Ethylene (B)** and **propane (F)**: Ethylene is an alkene, which is less reactive than alkynes but more reactive than alkanes.
3. **Ethanol (G)**: Ethanol is an alkene, which is less reactive than alkynes but more reactive than alkanes.
4. **Ethanoic acid (H)**: Ethanoic acid is a chloroacetic acid, a strong electrophile that reacts readily with alkynes (G) and alkane chlorides (A and B). It is the most reactive among the options.
5. **Propane (F)** and **ethane (G)**: Both are alkynes, which are highly reactive towards chloroacetic acids.
6. **Ethaneth (B)** and **propane (F)**: Ethylene (B) is an alkene, which is less reactive than alkynes.
7. **Ethanol (G)** and **ethanoic acid (H)**: Ethyne (G) is an alkyne, which is more reactive than alkanes but less reactive than ethanoic acid (H), which is a chloroacetic acid.
8. **Benzene (I)**: Benzene is an aromatic compound, which is not reactive towards chloroacetic acids.

### Conclusion:
The reactivity of chlorine gas with alkynes is higher than with alkanes, and ethanoic acid (H) is a strong chloroacetic acid that reacts readily with alkynes (G). Therefore, the best candidate for the substance chlorine gas reacts most readily with is **ethyne (G)**.
