Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this Stevenson question. The question is about Stevenson's different uses of language and what "good" refers to. I remember that Stevenson talked a lot about emotion in language. Let me think about his text "Analogies and Personality" maybe? 

Stevenson categorized language uses into nine main types, right? I think they include things like propositional, descriptive, inferential, etc. The question is asking about the emotive meaning of "good." So, "good" has a pleasing effect on the person. That sounds like it's used in a propositional role. Propositional uses are where the word applies to a noun, like "good food." 

Wait, let me double-check. Propositional uses are when the word fits the noun. So in "good food," "good" is describing the noun food. That makes sense because it's about the quality or character of the noun itself. So Stevenson would likely classify it as a propositional use. 

The options given are A to J, each corresponding to a different use. The propositional use is option D. So the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: propositional use.
