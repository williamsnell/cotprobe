Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's give it a shot.

The question is about a particle moving in a uniform electric field. The particle has mass m, charge Q, and velocity V. It travels a distance d. Now, the question asks what happens to the distance when the velocity is doubled and the mass is halved.

Hmm. I remember that in an electric field, the force on a charge is F = Q * E. So the acceleration a of the particle would be F/m, which is (Q E)/m. 

Wait, so the acceleration is (Q E)/m. Now, if the velocity is doubled, that would affect the kinetic energy. But wait, the particle is moving through the electric field, so maybe it's also accelerating under the electric force. Or is it moving in a straight line, perhaps in a projectile motion scenario? Or is it moving in a straight line with constant acceleration?

Wait, wait. Oh, right! In an electric field, if the particle is moving in one direction and the electric field is in that same direction, then the particle will accelerate. But if there's no force opposing it, it would just keep moving with increasing speed. But in this case, the particle is directed toward the electric field, so maybe the field is acting opposite to the direction of motion? Or maybe not. Or perhaps it's moving through a region where the electric field is uniform and in the same direction as the particle's motion. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify direction, so I have to make some assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle is moving through the field, which causes it to accelerate. So, the particle's motion would be in a straight line but with increasing speed. But in that case, the distance traveled might depend on the time it's accelerating.

Wait, but the original velocity is V, and the distance is d. Let's model the motion.

In the original scenario:

The force F = Q E (assuming E is constant and same direction as velocity). So acceleration a = F/m = (Q E)/m.

Now, the particle starts with initial velocity V, and under constant acceleration, the distance traveled is given by the equation:

d = V * t + 0.5 * a * t²

But wait, since the particle is moving in the direction of the electric field, I think perhaps it's moving such that the electric field is opposing, so acceleration is negative. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify direction, so maybe it's better to proceed without getting into signs.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle is moving through the field, which causes it to accelerate. So, the time taken to travel distance d can be found from the equation:

d = V * t + (1/2) a t²

But without knowing time, maybe it's better to think about the velocity as a function of time. The velocity as a function of time is:

v(t) = V + a t

And the distance is the integral from 0 to t of v(t) dt. So integrating:

d = ∫₀^t (V + a t') dt' = V t + (1/2) a t².

But perhaps another approach. Let me think about energy. The work done by the electric field is F*d, which equals the change in kinetic energy. So, work W = F * d = Q E d. The change in kinetic energy is (1/2) m (v² - V²) = Q E d.

Wait, but wait. That would be the case if the particle starts with velocity V and ends at velocity v, so the change is (v² - V²)/2 m = Q E d.

But in our problem, the particle's motion might not end up with a velocity that's different. Alternatively, perhaps the particle is moving in the same direction as the electric field, so the acceleration is in the same direction as V, leading to a net increase in speed.

But I'm not sure about the energy aspect. Maybe that's complicating things. Let's think about the equations again.

In the original case, the force is F = Q E. So acceleration a1 = F/m = (Q E)/m.

The time taken to travel distance d is determined by the equation:

d = V * t + 0.5 * a1 * t².

But without knowing the value of t, maybe I can relate the velocity and time.

Alternatively, the final velocity after distance d is V + a1 t.

But perhaps another approach is to consider that the acceleration a1 is (Q E)/m. So, the acceleration is constant.

Now, the problem says the velocity is doubled and the mass is halved. So, new velocity V' = 2V. New mass m' = m/2.

The new acceleration a2 = (Q E) / (m/2) ) = 2 (Q E)/m. So a2 = 2 a1.

Now, the time taken to travel the same distance d will be different. Let's compute the time in the original case and in the new case.

In the original case:

d = V t + 0.5 a1 t².

In the new case, the same d, but with a2 and new velocity.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the time taken for the same distance. Let me compute the time t1 for the original case and t2 for the new.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the time taken in each scenario and then see how the distance changes.

Alternatively, another approach: in the original scenario, the particle starts at velocity V and ends at velocity V + a1 t. The distance is d = V t + 0.5 a1 t².

In the new scenario, the particle starts at velocity 2V and ends at 2V + a2 t'. The distance is the same, d = 2V t' + 0.5 a2 t'^2.

But the problem doesn't say anything about the final velocity, so perhaps the new time is different. But maybe I can consider the time when the particle has traveled the same distance d, but with the new parameters.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the same movement, but with modified parameters, so maybe the particle is moving in such a way that the distance is maintained as d, but perhaps the time is different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the force.

Wait, the electric field does work on the charge. The work done is W = F * d = Q E d. This work equals the change in kinetic energy.

So, W = (1/2) m (v² - V²) = Q E d.

Wait, so in the original case:

(1/2) m (V² - (V')²) = Q E d.

Wait, but that's if the final velocity is V'. But I'm not certain about the problem statement. It says the particle travels a distance d after being directed towards the field. So, maybe the direction is such that the acceleration is in the same direction as V. So, the final velocity is V + a t, but perhaps the time to reach distance d is the same?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem is about what happens when the velocity is doubled and the mass is halved.

But perhaps the distance d is the same in both cases. So in the original case, the particle travels distance d, then in the new case, it travels a new distance d'.

But to find d', we have to find the time taken in the new scenario and the new distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle's acceleration in the new scenario is doubled, so a2 = 2 a1.

So, in the new case, the acceleration is 2a1.

Let me think about the forces again.

In the original case, F1 = Q E = m a1.

In the new case, F2 = Q E = (m/2) a2.

So, F2 = 2 F1. So, the force is doubled. So, the acceleration a2 is 2 a1.

Wait, but that's not correct because F = ma, so if m is halved, F = (m/2) a2 => a2 = (2 F)/m.

Wait, but F is the same because E is the same. So, F = Q E, so a2 = (2 F)/m. And a1 = F/m.

So, a2 = 2 a1.

So, in the new case, the acceleration is twice as strong as in the original.

Now, what about the time taken to travel the same distance d?

In the original case, time taken is t1. In the new case, time taken is t2.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the same distance is achieved in the same time or not. Oh, wait, in the original case, the distance is d. So, the same d is achieved in new case.

So, new scenario: same d = distance.

In original case:

d = V t1 + 0.5 a1 t1².

In new case:

d = (2V) t2 + 0.5 (2 a1) t2².

Because a2 = 2 a1.

So, d = 2V t2 + (a1 t2²).

Wait, but I can compare the two equations.

In the original case: d = V t1 + 0.5 a1 t1².

In the new case: d = 2 V t2 + 0.5 (2 a1) t2² = 2 V t2 + a1 t2².

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can relate t1 and t2.

Alternatively, perhaps the time in the original case is t1 = t, and in new case t2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy approach.

In the original scenario, the work done is W = F * d = Q E d = (1/2) m (V² - v²), where v is the final velocity. But the problem doesn't specify the final velocity, so I can't be sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy equation.

The work done by the electric field is W = F * d = Q E d. This equals the change in kinetic energy.

So, W = ΔKE = (1/2) m (v² - V²) = Q E d.

Hmmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle is moving in such a way that the distance d is the stopping distance or something, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial velocity is V, the final velocity is V, but the electric field is causing some acceleration, but in the original case, the particle covers a distance d. Then, in the new case, the velocity is doubled, and the mass is halved.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should model the problem as follows.

In the original case:

Force F = Q E.

Acceleration a = F/m = (Q E)/m.

The time taken to travel distance d is given by:

d = V * t + (1/2) a t².

In the new case:

New force F' = Q E (same as before).

New acceleration a' = F' / (m/2) ) = (2 F)/m = 2 a.

So, a' = 2 a.

The time taken to travel distance d in the new case would be t' such that:

d = (2 V) t' + (1/2) a' (t')².

So,

d = 2 V t' + (1/2)(2 a) (t')² → d = 2 V t' + a (t')².

But in the original case, d = V t + 0.5 a t².

Hmm. But without knowing t, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the particle comes to rest? Or maybe it's moving in a way that after the distance d, it stops. But I'm not given any info about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle is moving in the same direction as the electric field, so the acceleration is positive, leading to a longer time to cover the same distance. But that's speculative.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the distance d is the same in both cases. So, perhaps the same time is taken, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, let's compute the ratio d'/d in terms of the new and old parameters.

In the original case:

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

In the new case:

d' = (2 V) t' + 0.5 (2 a) t'².

We can write:

d' = 2 V t' + a t'².

But from the original case:

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

So, I can express V t as d - 0.5 a t².

Substituting into d':

d' = 2 V t' + a t'².

But I'm not seeing an obvious way to relate t and t' without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the time taken is the same, which would make sense if the particle is moving with the same time. But then, in that case:

d = V t + 0.5 a t² = (2 V) t + 0.5 (2 a) t² → d = 2 V t + a t².

But the original case is d = V t + 0.5 a t².

So, if t is the same, then 0.5 a t² could be compared.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should compute a ratio.

Let me compute the ratio of d' to d.

d' = 2 V t' + a (t')².

But d = V t + 0.5 a t².

I need to find how d' relates to d.

But without knowing t and t', maybe I can express d' in terms of d.

Wait, perhaps the acceleration is (Q E)/m, and the new acceleration is twice that.

So, the same distance d is achieved under a higher acceleration. But the initial velocity is doubled. So, let's think about the time taken to reach the final velocity.

In the original case, the velocity after time t is V + a t.

In the new case, it's 2 V + a' t' = 2 V + 2 a t'.

But wait, perhaps the time taken to reach the same distance is the same? Or perhaps the final velocity is the same.

But the problem doesn't state that; it just says that the velocity is doubled and the mass is halved. So perhaps the final velocity isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is the same, but the acceleration is higher, so the time taken is shorter, leading to more distance.

But I'm not making progress. Let's approach it another way.

In the original case, the acceleration is a = Q E / m.

In the new case, a' = 2 a.

So, a' = (Q E)/(m/2) ) = 2 (Q E)/m.

Now, let's think about the time taken to cover the same distance d.

In the original case:

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

In the new case:

d = 2 V t' + 0.5 a' t'² = 2 V t' + 0.5 * 2 a * t'² = 2 V t' + a t'².

But I'm not sure about the relationship between t and t'.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle starts moving with velocity V and ends with velocity 2V, and the same distance is covered.

Wait, but without knowing the final velocity, it's tricky.

Wait, but the original scenario's energy comes into play. Maybe I should think about the work done.

In the original case, the work done by the electric field is W = F1 * d = Q E d.

This work equals the kinetic energy change.

So, W = (1/2) m (v² - V²) = Q E d.

But since the problem doesn't specify the final velocity, I can't use this unless I make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle comes to rest. If it does, then the final velocity would be zero, but that's an assumption I can't make.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy, but without knowing the final velocity, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that the acceleration in the new case is double, and the initial velocity is doubled.

So, the new acceleration is a' = 2 a.

The time taken to reach a certain velocity would be different.

But wait, here's another approach: in the original case, the time to reach velocity V is t = (V - V_initial)/a_initial. But if the particle starts with velocity V, then time to stop would be different.

Wait, perhaps the particle's acceleration is causing it to go from V to some higher speed, but I'm not given that.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the distance is the same, but the acceleration is higher.

Wait, but since the acceleration is higher, the time to cover the same distance would be less. So, the particle would reach a higher velocity faster, but the distance is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle starts moving with velocity V and ends with velocity 2V, and the same distance is covered.

But that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, another approach: the force is F = Q E.

In the original case:

F = m a → a = F/m.

In the new case, F' = F (since E and Q are same), and m' = m/2 → a' = F/(m/2) = 2 F/m = 2a.

So, a' is twice a.

The distance is same, d.

So, using the equation for distance in terms of initial velocity and acceleration:

d = v0 t + 0.5 a t².

In the original case, v0 is V, a is a, and time is t.

In the new case, v0 is 2V, a is 2a, and time is t'.

So,

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

d = 2V t' + a (2a) t'^2 → Wait, I'm not following.

Wait, in the new case, the equation is:

d = (2V) t' + 0.5 (2a) t'^2.

But the original equation is d = V t'_{original} + 0.5 a t'^2_{original}.

But without knowing t' and t'_{original}, it's hard to relate.

Wait, but perhaps the time in the new case is the same as the original time, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio of d' to d in terms of the new and old parameters.

Wait, in the original case:

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

In the new case, the same d is achieved with:

d = 2V t' + 0.5 (2a) t'^2 = 2V t' + a t'^2.

So, perhaps I can set 2V t' + a t'^2 = V t + 0.5 a t².

Hmm. But that's a quadratic equation in t' and t.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of d' over d.

Wait, but this seems too involved without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is the same, so we can write:

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

d = 2V t' + a t'^2.

Now, if I could find t' in terms of t, perhaps I can find the ratio.

But without any relation between t and t', I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the acceleration is doubled, and the initial velocity is doubled, but the distance is the same. So, perhaps the time is adjusted such that the distance doesn't change. But this is speculation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the particle comes to rest, so the final velocity is zero.

In the original case: the time to reach zero velocity would be t = V/(a).

Then, the distance would be d = V t + 0.5 a t² = V*(V/a) + 0.5 a*(V²/a²) = V² / a + V²/(2a) = (3/2)(V²/a).

But I don't know if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle travels the same distance, but with the new parameters. So, the new distance is d', which I need to find.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to realize that the acceleration is doubled, and the initial velocity is doubled. So, the time taken would increase.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the distances can be found by comparing the accelerations and initial velocities.

Because the force is doubled (a' = 2a), and the initial velocity is doubled (v' = 2v), then the time taken would be the same. Or perhaps the time taken would change in such a way that the distance remains the same.

Wait, let's think about the time taken to cover the same distance.

In the original case, the time is t.

In the new case, the time is t' = [ (d)/(2V) ) ] + [ (d)/(a t'^2) ) ]

But without knowing d or t, this is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time taken for the same distance.

Original case:

t = sqrt( (2d)/(a) ) ) = sqrt( 2d/(a) )

New case:

t' = sqrt( (2d)/(a') ) ) = sqrt( 2d/(2a) ) ) = sqrt( d/(a) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ) sqrt( 2d/(a) ) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) t.

So, the time in the new case is (1/sqrt(2)) t.

The initial velocity in the new case is 2V.

So, the distance covered in the new case is:

d' = 2V * t' + 0.5 a' (t')².

Substituting t' = (t)/sqrt(2):

d' = 2V * (t/sqrt(2)) ) + 0.5 * (2a) * (t² / 2 )

Simplify:

d' = (2 V t ) / sqrt(2) ) + (a t² ) / 2 * 2 → 

Wait, let's compute each term:

First term: 2V * t' = 2V * (t / sqrt(2) ) = (2 V t ) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) V t.

Second term: 0.5 * a' * (t')^2 → a' = 2a.

So, 0.5 * 2a * (t² / 2) → (a) * (t²/2) → (a t²)/2.

So,

d' = sqrt(2) V t + (a t²)/2.

But in the original case, d = V t + 0.5 a t².

So, if I factor out V from the first term and a from the second term in d':

d' = sqrt(2) V t + (a t²)/2.

Compare to the original d:

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

So,

d' = V t ( sqrt(2) ) + a t² ( 0.5 ).

But d = V t + 0.5 a t².

So,

d' = sqrt(2) V t + 0.5 a t².

Hmm, but this doesn't directly relate to d. So, unless sqrt(2) V t and 0.5 a t² can be expressed in terms of d, which we don't know.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of d' to d can be found by expressing both in terms of d.

But without knowing how V t and a t² relate, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the ratio of d' to d in terms of the parameters.

Wait, let's see: d' = sqrt(2) V t + 0.5 a t^2.

And d = V t + 0.5 a t^2.

So, if I denote d = V t + 0.5 a t^2,

then,

d' = sqrt(2) V t + 0.5 a t^2.

But I can write this as:

d' = [ sqrt(2) V t + 0.5 a t^2 ] = [ V t + 0.5 a t^2 ] + [ (sqrt(2) - 1) V t ].

But I'm not seeing a clear path here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ratio d'/d is:

[ sqrt(2) V t + 0.5 a t^2 ] / [ V t + 0.5 a t^2 ].

But again, without knowing the values of V t and a t², this isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle comes to rest. Then, the final velocity is zero.

In that case, the time taken to stop would be t_stop = V/(a).

And the distance would be d = V t_stop + 0.5 a t_stop^2 = V (V/a) + 0.5 a (V²/a²) = V²/a + V²/(2a) = (3 V²)/(2a).

But I don't know if the particle stops.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance is the same, but the time is different, leading to a different acceleration.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of work done.

In the original case, the work done is W1 = F1 * d.

In the new case, the work done is W2 = F2 * d.

Since F2 = F1 (because E and Q are same), W2 = W1.

So, the work done is the same.

But the work done is also equal to the change in kinetic energy.

So, (1/2) m V² - (1/2) m (V')² = W = F d.

But without knowing V' (the new velocity), I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the velocity doesn't change, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle comes to rest, so V' =0.

Then, the initial velocity is V, and the final velocity is 0.

In that case, the acceleration a = (0 - V)/t = -V/t.

But this would complicate the equations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the electric field does work on the particle, but the particle's velocity changes.

But without knowing the direction of the velocity change, it's hard to model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle has a certain velocity, and the work done is the same, leading to a new time.

But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the ratio of d' to d in terms of the new and old parameters.

In the original case, the ratio d is proportional to (V t + 0.5 a t²).

In the new case, the ratio is proportional to (2V t' + a t'^2).

But since I don't know how t and t' relate, I can't find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the particle's velocity remains the same, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the acceleration is doubled, and the velocity is doubled, leading to a new time.

Wait, perhaps the particle starts at velocity V and ends at 2V, and the acceleration is doubled.

So, the time taken to reach 2V would be t = (2V - V)/a = V/a.

In this time, the distance covered would be d = V t + 0.5 a t².

Substituting t = V/a:

d = V * (V/a) + 0.5 a (V²/a²) ) = V²/a + 0.5 V²/a = (1.5) V²/a.

But in this case, the acceleration is a.

In the new case, acceleration is 2a, and initial velocity is 2V.

So, the time taken would be t' = (2V - 2V)/ (2a) ), which is zero, so the particle doesn't move. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the particle starts with velocity V, ends with velocity V, and the acceleration is doubled.

Wait, but that wouldn't make sense because the acceleration would be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle comes to rest. So, the particle starts with velocity V, ends with velocity 0, and the acceleration is a.

In this case, the time taken is t = V/a.

The distance covered is d = V t + 0.5 a t².

Substituting t = V/a:

d = V (V/a) + 0.5 a (V²/a²) ) = V²/a + 0.5 V²/a = 1.5 V²/a.

In the new case, acceleration is 2a, initial velocity is 2V.

Time taken to reach 0 velocity would be t = (2V) / (2a) ) = V/a.

Wait, no. The time taken to reach 0 velocity is t = V/a, which is the same as in the original case.

But wait, if the particle starts at 2V and ends at 0, with acceleration 2a, then the time taken would be t' = (0 - 2V)/(2a) ) = (-2V)/(2a) ) = -V/a. Negative time doesn't make sense.

So, that's not possible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the particle starts moving with velocity V, and the acceleration is a, leading to some distance.

But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the original case, the particle covers a distance d while accelerating from V to V (no change), but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle comes to rest, so the velocity change is from V to 0, and the acceleration is a.

In that case, the time taken is t = V/a.

The distance covered is d = V t + 0.5 a t².

Substituting t = V/a:

d = V (V/a) + 0.5 a (V²/a²) ) = V²/a + 0.5 V²/a = 1.5 V²/a.

Now, in the new case, the particle starts with velocity 2V, and the acceleration is 2a. The time taken to reach 0 velocity would be t' = (0 - 2V)/(2a) ) = -V/a, which is negative, so that's not possible. Thus, the particle must have some positive velocity after time t'.

But I'm not given any initial velocity or final velocity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle comes to rest, so the final velocity is zero, and the initial velocity is 2V. Then, the acceleration would be a = (0 - 2V) / t', where t' is the time taken. But that's a negative acceleration, which would mean the particle is decelerating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle starts at velocity 2V, and the acceleration is 2a, leading to a negative velocity after some time, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle doesn't come to rest, but ends with some velocity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle starts at velocity V, and the acceleration is a, and the time taken is t, so the distance is d = V t + 0.5 a t².

In the new case, the acceleration is 2a, and the initial velocity is 2V.

So, the distance is d' = 2V t' + 0.5 (2a) (t')² = 2V t' + a t'^2.

But since, in the original case, the distance is d = V t + 0.5 a t².

We can relate these two equations.

Let me denote the original case's time as t, and the new case's time as t'.

So,

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

d' = 2V t' + a t'^2.

Now, the problem is to find d' in terms of d.

But without any relation between t and t', I can't proceed.

Unless, perhaps, the times are the same.

Assuming t = t', then:

d' = 2V t + a t².

But from the original equation:

d = V t + 0.5 a t².

So,

d' = 2V t + a t².

But 2V t = 2V t.

And a t² = 2(0.5 a t²) = 2d - 2V t.

Wait, because from the original equation, 0.5 a t² = d - V t.

So, a t² = 2d - 2V t.

Substituting into d':

d' = 2V t + (2d - 2V t) ) = 2V t + 2d - 2V t = 2d.

So, the distance in the new case would be 2d.

Wait, that's a possible conclusion.

So, assuming that the times are the same, the distance in the new case is 2d.

But wait, that seems to be a possible conclusion, but I'm not sure if that's the correct assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the times are different, but the ratio can be determined.

But since I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with this conclusion.

So, the answer would be d', which is twice the original distance.

Looking back at the options, option D is 2d.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The problem involves determining how the distance traveled by a charged particle changes when the parameters are modified. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Original Case**:  
   - The particle has an initial velocity \( V \) and an acceleration \( a \).  
   - The distance traveled is given by the equation:  
     \[
     d = V t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
     \]  
     where \( t \) is the time taken.

2. **New Case**:  
   - The initial velocity is doubled: \( 2V \).  
   - The acceleration is doubled: \( 2a \).  
   - The new distance \( d' \) is:  
     \[
     d' = 2V t' + \frac{1}{2} (2a) t'^2 = 2V t' + a t'^2
     \]  

3. **Assumption**:  
   - Assume the time taken in the new case is the same as in the original case, \( t' = t \).  

4. **Substitution**:  
   - Substitute \( t' = t \) into the equation for \( d' \):  
     \[
     d' = 2V t + a t^2
     \]  

5. **Relating to Original Distance**:  
   - From the original equation:  
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = d - V t
     \]  
     Multiply both sides by 2:  
     \[
     a t^2 = 2d - 2V t
     \]  

6. **Substitute \( a t^2 \) into \( d' \)**:  
   - Substitute into \( d' \):  
     \[
     d' = 2V t + (2d - 2V t) = 2V t + 2d - 2V t = 2d
     \]  

7. **Conclusion**:  
   - The new distance \( d' \) is twice the original distance \( d \).  

Thus, the correct answer is **D: 2d**.
