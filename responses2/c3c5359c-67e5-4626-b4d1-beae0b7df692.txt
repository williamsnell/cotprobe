Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about urban development theories. Let me think through what I remember about each of these names and their theories.

The question is asking which theory states that cities grow from a core using several nodes of growth. The options are labeled from A to J, each referring to a different urban planner or theorist.

First, I'll try to recall each theorist's contribution. Starting with Christaller, I remember that he proposed that cities should be located near their centers of demand. So that's about accessibility, not growth from a core.

Ravenstein comes to mind next. I think he talked about the capacity of cities. His theory was about how cities can expand based on their resources and how they relate to the growth of other cities. So that's related to growth but not specifically outward from a core.

Hotelling's Law, I believe, deals with market competition and where businesses should locate to gain the most advantage. It's more about competition and location, not growth from a core.

Hoyt's work? I'm not as sure. Maybe he has something to do with urban planning or transportation. Not the one about growth from a core.

Burgess? I'm not certain, but I think he's associated with the concept of 'zones' influencing urban development. Maybe he developed a model where growth is influenced by proximity to amenities.

Wait, I remember a term called 'Habitat Theory.' It's a model where cities are developed in areas that are not too crowded, so they can sustain growth. This might be referred to by one of these names. I think it's Hotelling's Law that relates to availability and competition, but maybe the habitat theory is by another person.

Oh, wait, the 'Habitat Theory' was actually proposed by Hotelling. So that doesn't fit. Then, maybe the theory of cities growing from a core is another one.

Let me think again. I'm trying to remember each name's main contribution. Von Thünen's theory is about fitting the land and how urban centers are located to minimize access to resources. That's related to accessibility but not specifically outward growth.

Harris and Ullmann, I believe, introduced the concept of the 'H.principle,' which states that cities should be located as close as possible to their resources to maximize growth. That sounds right. So this theory would be about how cities develop outward from a core, as it's about proximity and resource accessibility.

So, the correct answer should be Harris and Ullmann, which is option I. So the first letter is I. The question asks for the last character chosen, which is I.

The correct answer is Harris and Ullmann, as their theory focuses on proximity and resource accessibility for city growth from a core. The last character in the answer is I.

Answer: I
