Okay, so I have this question about disk unit and bit strings. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that a disk unit uses a bit string to track track occupancy, where O is vacant (0) and 1 is occupied. The given hexadecimal value is D4FE2003, and it's a 32-bit segment. I need to find the percentage of occupied tracks to the nearest percent.

Wait, right. So I remember that each track can be either occupied or vacant, represented by 1 and 0 in the bit string. But wait, wait. Oh wait, perhaps I'm thinking about bytes instead of bits. Wait, 32 bits is two bytes, right? Because 32 bits is 4 bytes. Hmm, but each byte is 8 bits. So the 32-bit segment is two bytes.

Wait, but to find the percentage of occupied tracks, I need to count how many bits are 1s because each 1 represents an occupied track. But wait, each track is represented by a bit. So each bit is a track. So a 32-bit segment has 32 tracks. So the number of occupied tracks is the number of 1s in the 32-bit string.

Wait, but wait, the question says it's a 32-bit segment. So 32 bits, each representing a track's state. So the total number of tracks is 32. The percentage occupied is (number of 1s / 32) * 100.

But I have to be careful here. Because each bit is a single track. So the number of occupied tracks is the number of 1s in the 32-bit string.

So first, I need to convert the hexadecimal D4FE2003 into binary to count the number of 1s.

Wait, how to convert each pair of hex digits to binary. Let me break it down. D4FE2003 is 32 bits, so 16 hex digits, each two digits. So:

D4 FE 20 03.

So each pair is: D4, FE, 20, 03.

Let me convert each pair to binary.

D is 13 in hex, so D4 in hex is 13*16 +4 = 212. So binary is 11010100.

FE is 254 in decimal. So binary is 11111110.

20 is 32, so binary is 00100000.

03 is 3, which is 00000011.

Wait, but wait, each pair is two digits. So D4 is two hex digits, which is four bits. Wait, no: each hex digit is four bits, so two hex digits make eight bits. So let me make sure.

Wait, no, each hex digit is four bits. So D4 is two hex digits, 16 and 4. So in binary, D is 1101, and 4 is 0100. So D4 is 11010100 in binary, which is 8 bits.

Similarly, FE is 11111110 (8 bits), 20 is 00100000 (8 bits), and 03 is 00000011 (8 bits). So the entire 32-bit string is 11010100 11111110 00100000 00000011.

Now, let me count the number of 1s in each part.

D4FE2003 in hex is 11010100 (D4) 11111110 (FE) 00100000 (20) 00000011 (03).

Wait, but let me check each pair:

D4: 11010100 → count the 1s: let's see, 1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0 → that's 1,2,3,4,5,6 → six 1s.

FE: 11111110 → each of the first seven bits is 1, so that's seven 1s.

20: 00100000 → only the third bit is 1. So one 1.

03: 00000011 → two 1s.

So adding up the 1s: 6 +7=13, plus 1 is 14, plus 2 is 16. So total 16 1s.

Wait, wait, but 16? Because 16 bits set? So 16 out of 32.

So the percentage is (16/32)*100 = 50%. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 50%, and option E is 25%. So why am I getting 50%? But wait, let me double-check the counts.

Wait, D4 is 11010100 → that's 1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0 → 1,2,3,4,5,6 → 6 ones.

FE is 11111110 → 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0 → 7 ones.

20 is 00100000 → 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0 → 1 one.

03 is 00000011 → 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1 → 2 ones.

Total: 6+7=13, plus 1 is 14, plus 2 is 16. So 16 ones.

So 16/32 is 0.5. 0.5 *100 =50%. So the percentage is 50%. But looking at the options, option D is 50%. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Wait, D4FE2003 is D4 FE 20 03, so each pair is 8 bits. Therefore, 32 bits total.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me check the binary representations again.

Wait, D4 in hex is 212 in decimal. 212 in binary is 11010100 → correct.

FE is 254 → 11111110 → correct.

20 is 32 → 00100000 → correct.

03 is 3 → 00000011 → correct.

So adding up 6+7+1+2 =16. So 16 ones, which is 50% of 32. So the percentage is 50%.

But looking at the options, option D is 50% and option E is 25%. So the answer is D.

The question involves converting a 32-bit hexadecimal string (D4FE2003) into binary to determine the percentage of occupied tracks. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits, so D4FE2003 consists of 8-bit chunks:

- **D4** → 11010100 (6 ones)
- **FE** → 11111110 (7 ones)
- **20** → 00100000 (1 one)
- **03** → 00000011 (2 ones)

Adding these gives a total of 16 ones (occupied tracks) out of 32 bits (tracks). The percentage is (16/32) * 100 = 50%. 

Among the options, the correct answer is **50%**, which corresponds to option D.
