Okay, so I have this question about fluid dynamics, specifically about steady incompressible flow. Hmm, I remember that for incompressible flow, the continuity equation must hold. The continuity equation in two dimensions (assuming v is the only velocity and u is the other) is ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y = 0. So, I need to check each part and see if this condition is satisfied.

The question gives three options, (a), (b), (c), and the options A to H are about which are possible steady incompressible flows.

Let's go through each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): u = kxy + y and v = kxy + x.

First, compute ∂u/∂x. u is kxy + y. So, derivative w.r. to x is k*y (since k and y are constants here). Then, ∂u/∂x = ky.

Next, compute ∂v/∂y. v is kxy + x. Derivative w.r. to y is kx. So, ∂v/∂y = kx.

Now, check if ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y equals zero. So, ky + kx = k(x + y). Unless k is zero, this isn't zero. So, unless k is zero, the flow isn't incompressible. But wait, does the question specify any conditions on k? I think k could be any constant, so the sum is k(x + y). So, unless k is zero, which would make both u and v zero, making it a trivial solution. But assuming k isn't zero, the flow isn't incompressible. So, option (a) is probably not a possible incompressible flow.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should check if the flow is incompressible and also check for other conditions like irrotational (vorticity zero). Oh wait, the question is just about incompressible, not necessarily irrotational. So for (a), the sum is k(x + y), which is not zero unless k is zero. So (a) is not incompressible unless k is zero. So, (a) isn't a solution.

Moving on to part (b): u = x² + y² and v = -2xy.

Compute ∂u/∂x. The derivative of x² is 2x, and y² derivative is zero. So ∂u/∂x = 2x.

∂v/∂y: v is -2xy. Derivative w.r. to y is -2x. So ∂v/∂y = -2x.

Adding them together: 2x + (-2x) = 0. So the sum is zero. That satisfies the continuity equation for incompressible flow. So (b) is incompressible. Also, for irrotational flow, the vorticity ω is ∂v/∂x - ∂u/∂y. Let's compute that. ∂v/∂x is derivative of -2xy with respect to x is -2y. ∂u/∂y is derivative of x² + y² is 2y. So vorticity ω = (-2y) - (2y) = -4y. Which isn't zero. So the flow is irrotational? Wait, no, vorticity is non-zero, so the flow isn't irrotational. But the question only asks about incompressible, so (b) is incompressible.

Alright, so (b) is a possible candidate.

Now part (c): u = xy² + x + y² and v = x(x - y) + 3y³.

Compute ∂u/∂x. Let's see: u is x*y² + x + y². So derivative w.r. to x is y² (from x*y²) plus 1 (derivative of x) plus 0 (since y² is treated as a constant when taking w.r. to x). So ∂u/∂x = y² + 1.

Now, ∂u/∂x = y² + 1.

Now, compute ∂v/∂y. v is x(x - y) + 3y³. Let's expand that: x² - x y + 3 y³. So derivative w.r. to y is (-x) (from x*(-y) term) plus 9 y² (since derivative of 3y³ is 9y²). So ∂v/∂y = -x + 9 y².

Now, check if ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y equals zero. So, (y² + 1) + (-x + 9 y²) = y² + 1 -x + 9 y² = (10 y²) + (1 - x). Unless x is chosen such that x = 10 y² + 1, which isn't generally true, the sum isn't zero. So, ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y isn't zero. Therefore, the flow isn't incompressible. So (c) is not a possible incompressible flow.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I compute v correctly? Let me double-check. v is x(x - y) +3 y³. The expansion is x² - x y + 3 y³. The derivative with respect to y is -x (from the -x y term) and 9 y² (from 3 y³). So yes, ∂v/∂y = -x +9 y². So the sum would be (y²+1) + (-x +9 y²) = 10 y² +1 -x. So unless x=10 y² +1, which isn't generally true, the sum isn't zero. So (c) is not incompressible.

Wait, but wait again. Did I make any mistakes? Like, perhaps I'm missing a term. Let me recompute ∂u/∂x.

u = xy² + x + y². So derivative w.r. to x is the derivative of each term. The first term is x times y², so derivative is y². Second term is x, so derivative is 1. Third term is y², which is constant with respect to x, so derivative is 0. So yes, ∂u/∂x is y² + 1.

What about ∂v/∂y? v is x(x - y) + 3 y³. So v = x² -x y +3 y³. So derivative of x² is 0. derivative of -x y is -x. derivative of 3 y³ is 9 y². So ∂v/∂y is -x +9 y².

So ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y = (y² +1) + (-x +9 y²) = 10 y² +1 -x. So this is not zero unless x is 10 y² +1, which is not the case for all x and y. So (c) isn't incompressible.

Wait, but the question is about possible incompressible flows. So (c) isn't. So the only possible one is (b).

Wait, but let's think again. The question is which options are possible. So which of the three (a), (b), (c) are possible.

Earlier, (a) doesn't satisfy continuity, (b) does, (c) doesn't. So, possible only (b) is incompressible. So the possible functions are (b). But looking at the options, option E is "b", and option H is "a". Wait, option E is "b" and option H is "a". Or wait, looking back:

The options are A to H, with each letter saying a particular option.

Wait, the options are:

A: none
B: a and c
C: a, b, and c
D: c
E: b
F: b and c
G: a and b
H: a
I: all
J: c and d

Wait, no, from the original question, the options are labeled A to J, each with a different combination.

Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote:

Options:

A: none

B: a and c

C: a, b, and c

D: c

E: b

F: b and c

G: a and b

H: a

I: all

J: c and d

Wait, no, that can't be correct. Wait, perhaps I got the options wrong. Let me re-examine the user's question.

Oh, wait, looking back, the user's question is:

The options are:

A: none

B: a and c

C: a, b, and c

D: c

E: b

F: b and c

G: a and b

H: a

I: all

J: c and d

So, the options are (A) none, (B) a and c, etc.

So, if (b) is possible, and (a) and (c) are not, then which of the options is correct?

The question is, which of the functions are possible. So, if only (b) is possible, then the correct option would be E, which is "b". Because option E is "b" only. Wait, no, the options are:

A: none

B: a and c

C: a, b, and c

D: c

E: b

F: b and c

G: a and b

H: a

I: all

J: c and d

So, E says "b", which is correct because (b) is the only possible function.

So, the correct answer is E.

To determine which of the given functions of \( u \) and \( v \) are possible steady incompressible flows, we apply the continuity equation for incompressible flow, which states:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0
\]

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option (a):** \( u = kxy + y \), \( v = kxy + x \)

1. Compute \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = ky
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = kx
   \]

3. Check continuity:
   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = ky + kx = k(x + y)
   \]
   This is not zero unless \( k = 0 \), which would make \( u \) and \( v \) trivial solutions. Therefore, **(a) is not a possible incompressible flow**.

#### **Option (b):** \( u = x^2 + y^2 \), \( v = -2xy \)

1. Compute \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -2x
   \]

3. Check continuity:
   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2x - 2x = 0
   \]
   The flow satisfies the continuity equation. Additionally, the vorticity \( \omega = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \) is:
   \[
   \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = -2y, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 2y
   \]
   \[
   \omega = -2y - 2y = -4y
   \]
   Since \( \omega \neq 0 \), the flow is **irrotational**. However, the question only asks about incompressibility, so **(b) is a possible incompressible flow**.

#### **Option (c):** \( u = xy^2 + x + y^2 \), \( v = x(x - y) + 3y^3 \)

1. Compute \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = y^2 + 1
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \):
   \[
   v = x^2 - xy + 3y^3 \implies \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -x + 9y^2
   \]

3. Check continuity:
   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = (y^2 + 1) + (-x + 9y^2) = 10y^2 + 1 - x
   \]
   This is not zero unless \( x = 10y^2 + 1 \), which is not generally true. Therefore, **(c) is not a possible incompressible flow**.

### Conclusion:
- **(a)** is not possible.
- **(b)** is possible.
- **(c)** is not possible.

The correct option is **E: b**.
