Okay, so I've got this question about entropy and enthalpy changes when a solid melts. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

First, entropy change. Wait, when a solid melts, it goes from a solid to a liquid. I remember that when a substance changes from solid to liquid, it becomes more disordered. Like, solid has a lot of ordered particles, while liquid has more movement and less order. So entropy should increase. So if entropy increases, that's a positive change.

Enthalpy is the heat change at constant pressure. When a solid melts, heat is absorbed. Because melting is a phase change, it's endothermic. So enthalpy change is positive. So enthalpy increases.

Looking at the options, let's see which matches. Option A says positive enthalpy and negative entropy. That's wrong because both are positive. Option B: negative entropy and negative enthalpy. No, both should be positive.

Option C: No entropy change. That's not right. So C is out. Option D: No change in either. No, solid melts do change these.

Option E: Negative enthalpy and no entropy. No, both should be positive. So E is wrong. Option F: Negative entropy and negative enthalpy. No, both are positive.

Option G: Positive entropy and no change in enthalpy. Wait, does melting change the enthalpy much? I think it's a small change, but it's positive. So G says no change in enthalpy, which is wrong because it does change (endothermic).

Option H: Positive entropy and positive enthalpy. That sounds right. So H would be the correct answer.

Option I: Negative entropy and positive enthalpy. No, both can't be wrong. I think the correct one is H.

When a solid melts, it transitions from a solid to a liquid state. This process increases the disorder of the system, leading to a positive entropy change. Additionally, melting is an endothermic process, meaning heat is absorbed from the surroundings. Therefore, the enthalpy change is positive. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice must reflect both a positive entropy change and a positive enthalpy change. Option H matches this description.

Answer: H
