Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why Parfit opposes equality. I remember that Parfit is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, especially in areas like justice and the philosophy of action. He's often discussed in the context of human rights and welfare.

I think equality is a big topic in philosophy. Equality means that everyone should have the same rights and opportunities, right? But Parfit might have a different take. I remember something about his stance on fairness and whether it's possible to achieve it.

Wait, I think Parfit doesn't believe in equality. He might oppose it because he believes that human rights are limited and that no one can be given unlimited rights without infringing on others. Or maybe he thinks that equality is too idealistic and that it's not practical. 

Looking at the options now. Option B says he rejects the idea of equality altogether. That sounds right. He's probably against it. Another thought: maybe he thinks it's not possible or that it's a moral impossibility. 

Option C says he believes equality is not a realistic goal. That seems similar to B. So both B and C are contenders. But wait, I'm trying to remember the exact wording. Parfit's position was that equality is a moral mistake and that it's better to have a society where the majority are better off. 

Another point: I think he believed that equality is not a natural state. People are born with rights, and some have more than others. So he might argue that equality isn't possible without infringing on others' rights. 

So the options are B and C. But looking at the options again:

A: He claims that by giving priority to the needs of the poor, we can increase equality. Hmm, that's about fairness, but I don't think that's his main stance.

B: He rejects the idea of equality altogether. That seems correct.

C: He believes that equality is not a realistic goal. Also correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Which one is more accurate? Maybe Parfit opposed equality because it's impossible. So both B and C are correct. Wait, but the question is asking why he opposes, so perhaps it's more about the impossibility. But the options are singular.

Looking back, the options are:

B: He rejects the idea of equality altogether.

C: He believes that equality is not a realistic goal.

So both options B and C seem correct. But the question is giving me options to choose from A to I, and each is a separate choice. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or C. 

Wait, but wait. Parfit's main work is about justice and human rights. I think I read that he argued against the idea of equality. He believed that equality is a moral mistake, and that it's better to have a society where the majority are better off. So option B is the correct answer. 

But wait, option C says he believes equality is not a realistic goal. So which is more accurate? His main argument was that equality is a moral defect. So he doesn't support equality but rather against it as a goal. So maybe the answer is B.

The correct answer is **B: He rejects the idea of equality altogether.**

Parfit's stance on equality is that it is a moral defect and that no society can achieve true equality without infringing on the rights of others. He argues that equality is not a feasible goal. 

Answer: B
