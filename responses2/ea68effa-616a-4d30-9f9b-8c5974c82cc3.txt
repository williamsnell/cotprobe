Okay, so I need to figure out what the quotient of 1,224 divided by 9 is. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my division, but let's see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that division is the inverse of multiplication. So, if I can figure out what number multiplied by 9 gives me 1,224, that would be the answer. Alternatively, I can use long division to solve it step by step.

Let me try the long division method. So, 9 goes into 12 how many times? Well, 9 times 1 is 9, which is less than 12. 9 times 2 is 18, which is too big. So, it's 1. I write 1 above the division line, multiply 1 by 9, subtract from 12, which leaves 3. Bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32.

Now, how many times does 9 go into 32? Let's see, 9 times 3 is 27, which is less than 32. 9 times 4 is 36, which is too big. So, 3 comes down. Multiply 3 by 9 to get 27, subtract from 32 to get 5. Bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 54.

How many times does 9 go into 54? Well, 9 times 6 is exactly 54. So, 6 comes down. Multiply 6 by 9, subtract, and there's no remainder. 

So putting it all together, the quotient is 136. Let me check that. 9 times 136: 9*100=900, 9*30=270, 9*6=54. Adding those: 900+270=1170, plus 54 is 1224. Yep, that works out.

Looking at the options, option B is 136. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is 136, which is option B.
