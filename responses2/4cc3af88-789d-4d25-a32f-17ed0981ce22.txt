Question:

A department store distributes its overhead based on the direct labor cost. If the overhead for one month was $4,200, and the direct labor cost of the department store was $35,000, find (a) what per-cent overhead is of direct labor and (b) the cost of overhead for thehousewaresdepartment, which has a labor cost of $5,340.

Options:

A: 14%, $747.60
B: 7%, $374.80
C: 20%, $1,068.00
D: 10%, $534.00
E: 8%, $427.20
F: 11%, $587.40
G: 12%, $640.80
H: 9%, $480.60
I: 15%, $801.00
J: 6%, $320.40

Okay, so I've got this problem here about overhead in a department store. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the overhead is distributed based on direct labor cost. So, I remember that overhead allocation typically uses different bases—like direct labor, direct materials, or direct labor hours. In this case, it's direct labor, so the overhead percentage is based on that.

Part (a) asks for the percentage overhead of direct labor. The overhead for the month was $4,200, and the direct labor cost was $35,000. To find the percentage, I think I need to divide the overhead by the direct labor cost and then multiply by 100.

So, let me do that calculation. 4,200 divided by 35,000. Hmm, 4,200 ÷ 35,000. Okay, 35,000 goes into 4,200 how many times? Let me see: 35,000 × 0.12 is 4,200 because 35 × 12 is 420, and adding two zeros makes it 4,200. So, 12%. That means part (a) is 12%.

Wait, let me double-check. 35,000 × 0.12 is 4,200. Yes, that's correct. So part (a) is 12%.

Now part (b) is a bit trickier. It asks for the cost of overhead for a specific department with a labor cost of $5,340. Since overhead is based on direct labor, I think I need to find what percentage of that 12% applies to $5,340.

So, I take the 12% we found earlier and apply it to the $5,340. Let me compute that. 12% of 5,340. So, 5,340 × 0.12. Let's break it down: 5,000 × 0.12 is 600, and 340 × 0.12 is 40.8. Adding those together gives 600 + 40.8 = 640.8. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, I see some have 640.8 as the cost. Let me check the options.

Looking at option C: 20%, $1,068.00. No, that's 20%. Option G says 12%, $640.80. Oh wait, that's exactly what I got. So part (b) is $640.80.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I did the calculation correctly. Another way: 5,340 × 0.12. Let me compute 5,340 × 0.1 is 534, and 5,340 ×0.02 is 106.8. Adding those gives 534 + 106.8 = 640.8. Yes, same result.

So, looking back at the options, option G is 12%, $640.80. So part (b) is G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. The overhead is $4,200 on $35,000 DL. So the percentage is 12%. Then, for the specific department, it's 12% of $5,340, which is $640.80. So the correct answer for part (b) is G.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "the cost of overhead for the homogeneous department." Wait, homogeneous in what sense? Oh, I think I interpreted it right. It's a department with a labor cost of $5,340. So yes, that's the correct approach.

Looking at the options again, the correct answers are A:14%, 747.60; B:7%,374.80; C:20%,1068.00; D:10%,534.00; E:8%,427.2; F:11%,587.4; G:12%,640.8; H:9%,480.6; I:15%,801.0; J:6%,320.4.

So, part (a) is 12%, which matches with option G's 12%. So the correct answer should be option G and part (b) is G. Wait, no, part (b) is a separate question. The first part is (a), the second is (b). So, the options for each (a) and (b) are separate.

So, the first part is (a): 12%, and part (b) is (b): $640.80, which is option G.

But wait, in the options, each letter is a combination of the two problem parts. Wait, the options are single letters, so each option is a pair of percentage and cost. So for example, option G is 12% and $640.80.

So, the correct answer for the problem is (a) 12% and (b) $640.80, which is option G.

Wait, but looking back at the options for the question, each option is a single letter. So each letter represents the combination of (a) and (b). So option G is 12% for (a) and $640.80 for (b). So the correct answer is G.

So the correct answer is option G.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the overhead percentage based on direct labor cost. The overhead for the month is $4,200, and the direct labor cost is $35,000. The overhead percentage is calculated as:

\[
\text{Overhead Percentage} = \left( \frac{4,200}{35,000} \right) \times 100 = 12\%
\]

Next, we apply this overhead percentage to the labor cost of the specific department, which is $5,340:

\[
\text{Overhead Cost} = 5,340 \times 0.12 = 640.80
\]

Thus, for part (a), the overhead percentage is 12%, and for part (b), the cost of overhead for the homogeneous department is $640.80. Looking at the options, this corresponds to option G: 12%, $640.80.
