Okay, so I've got this problem here about factorials and trailing zeros. Let's see. The question is asking for how many positive integers k, the decimal representation of k! ends with exactly 99 zeros. The options are A to J, each representing a number of possible k's.

Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. And since 10 is 2*5, the number of trailing zeros is the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of k!. But I also recall that 2s are more plentiful than 5s in factorials, so the number of trailing zeros is actually determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors.

So, the formula to find the number of trailing zeros in k! is given by:
Z(k) = floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + floor(k/125) + ... until the division results in zero.

We need Z(k) = 99. So we need to find all k where this sum equals 99.

I think the approach is to find the range of k where Z(k) is just below 100, and then see how many k's give exactly 99 zeros.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the lower and upper bounds for k such that Z(k) is 99.

I remember that the number of trailing zeros increases roughly by 1 for every multiple of 5, but sometimes by 2 because of higher powers like 25, 125, etc. So to find the lower and upper bounds, we can set up inequalities.

Let me think: Let's find k where Z(k) =99.

We can approximate. Let's assume that for a given k, the number of 5s is around 99.

So, approximately, k/5 + k/25 + k/125 + ... = 99.

But this series converges to k/4 as an approximation, but maybe I should compute it.

Let me compute Z(k) for some k:

For example, k=475: Let's see.

475/5 =95

475/25=19

475/125=3.8 → floor to 3

475/625=0.76 → 0.

So total is 95+19+3=117, which is more than 99.

Wait, maybe I should work backward.

We need Z(k) =99.

So, let's find the k where Z(k) is 99. Let's try to find the possible k's.

The formula for Z(k) is the sum of floor(k/5^i) for i=1 to m, where 5^m ≤k.

So, to find the range of k where Z(k)=99, we can compute Z(k) for values around where 99 would be.

I think the lower bound is when Z(k) is just below 99, and the upper bound is when Z(k) is just above 99. So, maybe the k's that give exactly 99 are those for which Z(k)=99, and Z(k+1) >99.

So, perhaps I can find the minimal k such that Z(k)=99, and the maximal k such that Z(k)=99.

Wait, let's find the k where Z(k) is 99.

We can model Z(k) as approximately k/4, but let me compute Z(k) for some k.

Let me compute Z(475) as before, it was 117, which is higher than 99. So maybe lower than 475.

Let me try k=445:

445/5 =89

445/25=17.8 →17

445/125=3.56 →3

445/625=0.712 →0.

So Z(445)=89+17+3=109, which is more than 99.

Hmm, lower.

What about k=399:

399/5=79.8 →79

399/25=15.96 →15

399/125=3.192 →3

So Z=79+15+3=97. So 97.

So between 399 and 445, Z(k) goes from 97 to 109.

Wait, but we need Z(k)=99.

Wait, so perhaps the k's that give Z(k)=99 are in the range where Z(k) increases from 97 to 109, so the k's where Z(k) is 99 would be from the first k where Z(k)=99 up to the k where Z(k)=100.

Wait, no, because Z(k) increases as k increases.

Wait, let me think again. Let's find the k where Z(k) is 99. So, we can find the minimal k where Z(k) is 99.

Let me try k=399, which gives Z=97. Then k=400: 400/5=80, 400/25=16, 400/125=3.2 →3, and higher powers give 0. So Z(400)=80+16+3=99.

Ah, so k=400 gives Z=99.

Wait, wait, but what about k=399? Let me recheck.

k=399: 399/5=79.8 →79, 399/25=15.96→15, 399/125=3.192→3. So 79+15+3=97.

So k=400 gives 99.

What about k=401:

401/5=80.2→80

401/25=16.04→16

401/125=3.208→3

401/625=0.641→0.

So Z(401)=80+16+3=99.

Similarly, k=402: same.

k=403: same.

k=404: same.

k=405: 405/5=81, 405/25=16.2→16, 405/125=3.24→3, 405/625=0.648→0. So Z=81+16+3=100.

So for k=400, Z=99. For k=401,402,... up to 404, Z=99. For k=405, Z=100.

So the k's that give exactly 99 zeros are 400,401,402,403,404. That's 5 numbers. So the count is 5.

Wait, but the options are A:20, B:3, C:None, D:4, E:5, F:2, G:7, H:10, I:15, J:1.

So E is 5, so the answer would be E.

Wait, but I should check if there are any other k's where Z(k)=99.

Wait, for k between 400 and 404, Z(k)=99. What about k=405: Z=100. So the range is 400-404 inclusive. How many numbers is that?

From 400 to 404 inclusive is 5 numbers. So that's 5 values of k.

So the answer is E:5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's compute Z(400):

400/5=80, 400/25=16, 400/125=3.2→3, and higher terms zero. 80+16+3=99.

Z(401):

401/5=80.2→80, 401/25=16.04→16, 401/125=3.208→3. So same as 400, 99.

Same for 402,403,404.

Z(405):

405/5=81, 405/25=16.2→16, 405/125=3.24→3. So 81+16+3=100.

So yes, only k=400-404 give exactly 99 zeros.

Thus, the number of such k's is 5, which is option E.
</think>

The number of trailing zeros in k! is determined by the number of 5s in its factors, as 5s are more frequent than 2s. To find k where Z(k) = 99, we look for k where the sum of floor(k/5), floor(k/25), etc., equals 99. 

By testing, we find that k=400 gives Z=99, and k=401,402,403,404 also give Z=99. Thus, there are 5 such k's. 

Answer: E:5
