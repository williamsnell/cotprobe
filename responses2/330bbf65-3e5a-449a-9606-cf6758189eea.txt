Okay, so I've got this problem here about Frank Lee and Steve Barnes being partners. I'm a bit new to partnership accounting, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, and 1/3 of the remaining net income. The other 2/3 goes to Lee. The total profits are $28,269. I need to figure out how much each partner gets. The options are from A to J, with each giving specific amounts.

Hmm. Let's break this down. So, the total profit is $28,269. First, I think I need to subtract the salary from this amount because that's a fixed amount that's given to Barnes regardless of the remaining profit.

Wait, but wait. Since the salary is a fixed amount per week, and the total is for the year, right? Or is this a weekly basis? Oh, wait the question says "weekly salary of $300," but the total profits are $28,269. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the total for the year, so perhaps the $300 is per week and we multiply by the number of weeks in a year. Or is the $300 per week the weekly salary, but the calculation is done on a weekly basis? Hmm, that's a point of confusion.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The question says "Barnes receives a weekly salary of $300, and 1/3 of the remaining net income." So, perhaps the $300 is a weekly salary, but the profits are over a year. So, for the year, the number of weeks is 52. So the total salary would be 52 * 300 = $15,600. But wait, is that the total for the year, or is the $300 a weekly portion? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the $300 is a weekly salary, and the problem is considering the annual salary. So for one week, $300 is earned, but over the year, that's 52 times 300. So total salary for the year would be 52 * 300 = 15,600.

Wait, but the total profit is 28,269. So the first step is to subtract Barnes' salary from the total.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me re-express the problem. So the structure is:

Total Profit = 28,269.

Barnes gets a fixed salary of 300 per week. But does this mean it's a weekly salary, or per year? Because the total profit is given as a year amount, I think the $300 is a weekly salary. So total annual salary for Barnes is 52 * 300 = $15,600.

So first, subtract that from the total profit. So 28,269 - 15,600 = $12,669. That leaves a remaining profit of $12,669.

Now, according to the problem, 1/3 of this remaining income goes to Barnes, and 2/3 goes to Lee. So let me calculate that.

Barnes gets 1/3 of 12,669. Let me compute 12,669 ÷ 3.

3 × 4,223 is 12,669, right? Because 3*4000=12000, 3*223=669, so 12,669. So Barnes gets 4,223.

Wait no, wait. 3 × 4,223 is 12,669. So yes. So Barnes gets 4,223.

Lee gets the remaining 2/3, which is 2 × 4,223 = 8,446.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 4,223 + 8,446 = 12,669, which is correct.

So total to Barnes is 15,600 (salary) + 4,223 (1/3) = 19,823.

And Lee gets 8,446.

Looking at the options, option E is Barnes: $19,823, Lee: $8,446. That's option E.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

So total profit is 28,269.

Barnes gets 300 per week. Since it's a weekly salary, for the year, that's 52 weeks. So 300 *52 = 15,600.

Subtract that from 28,269: 28,269 - 15,600 = 12,669.

Then, 1/3 of 12,669 is 4,223 (as 12,669 /3 = 4,223).

So Barnes gets 15,600 + 4,223 = 19,823.

And Lee gets the remaining 2/3, which is 8,446.

So yes, option E is Barnes: 19,823; Lee: 8,446.

So I think the correct answer is E. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Barnes: $19,823, Lee: $8,446.

Yes, that's exactly what I calculated.

The problem involves determining the distribution of profits between two partners, Frank Lee and Steve Barnes, based on their respective shares of the net income. The total profit for the year is $28,269, with Barnes receiving a weekly salary of $300 and a portion of the remaining profit according to the specified ratios.

1. **Calculate Barnes' weekly salary for the year**:  
   Since the weekly salary is $300, for a year with 52 weeks, the total salary is:  
   \[
   300 \times 52 = 15,600
   \]

2. **Subtract the salary from the total profit**:  
   The remaining profit after subtracting Barnes' salary is:  
   \[
   28,269 - 15,600 = 12,669
   \]

3. **Distribute the remaining profit**:  
   - Barnes receives 1/3 of the remaining $12,669:  
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12,669 = 4,223
     \]  
   - Lee receives 2/3 of the remaining $12,669:  
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 12,669 = 8,446
     \]

4. **Total for each partner**:  
   - Barnes: $15,600 (salary) + $4,223 = $19,823  
   - Lee: $8,446  

5. **Match with the options**:  
   Option E: Barnes: $19,823, Lee: $8,446.

ANSWER: E
