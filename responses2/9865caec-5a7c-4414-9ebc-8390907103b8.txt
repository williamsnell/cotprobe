Okay, so I have this question about bonds and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question says: An 8% bond with 18 years to maturity has a yield of 9%. What is the price of this bond? The options are A to J, and I need to find the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that bond price calculation involves the present value of future cash flows. The bond pays a fixed interest (coupon) each year and returns the face value at maturity. So, the price should be the sum of the present value of all these cash flows.

First, let's figure out what each part is. The bond's coupon rate is 8%, so each annual payment is 8% of the face value. But wait, the face value is usually $100 unless stated otherwise. I think in these problems, it's often assumed to be $100. So each year, the bond gives $8 in interest.

The bond has 18 years to maturity, so there are 18 annual interest payments. The yield is 9%, which is the required rate of return. So, we need to discount each of the 18 $8 payments back to the present and add the $100 payment at the end of 18 years.

Wait, but sometimes bonds are called zero-coupon bonds if they don't pay interest, but here it's an 8% coupon, so it's a regular bond. So, the price is the sum of the present value of the coupon payments plus the present value of the face value.

The formula for the bond price (P) is:

P = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r + F * (1 + r)^-n

Where:
- C is the annual coupon payment (8% of face value)
- r is the yield (9% or 0.09)
- n is the number of years to maturity (18)
- F is the face value (assumed $100)

Let me plug in the numbers. 

First, calculate the coupon payments. C is 8% of $100, so $8 per year.

Then, the present value of the coupon payments is C multiplied by the present value of an ordinary annuity factor. The present value factor for an annuity is [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So, for each coupon payment, we discount it back 18 years at 9% per annum.

Let me calculate the first part: [1 - (1 + 0.09)^-18 ] / 0.09.

Wait, I should compute (1.09)^-18. Let me think, 1.09 to the power of 18 is roughly... Hmm, 1.09^18. I might need to use a calculator for this, but since I don't have one, maybe I can remember approximate values. Alternatively, I can think of it as e^(18 ln(1.09)) approximately, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, using a calculator, but for the sake of this thought process, perhaps I'll proceed.

Wait, maybe I should compute (1.09)^18. Let me think: 1.09^10 is about 2.367, and 1.09^8 is about 1.85, so 1.09^18 = 2.367 * 1.85 ≈ 4.38. So, 1/(1.09^18) is about 0.228. So, 1 - 0.228 = 0.772. Dividing by 0.09: 0.772 / 0.09 ≈ 8.58.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise method. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the present value factor.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity. The present value factor is (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r.

So, r is 9% (0.09), n is18.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

(1 + 0.09)^18.

Let me compute that. Let me think about 1.09^18. Let me use the rule of exponents:

1.09^18 = (1.09)^10 * (1.09)^8.

1.09^10 ≈ 2.36736.

1.09^8 ≈ 1.89829 (since 1.09^2 = 1.1881, ^4= ~1.4116, ^8= ~1.89829).

So, 2.36736 * 1.89829 ≈ 4.510. So, 1.09^18 ≈ 4.503.

Then, (1.09)^-18 ≈ 1/4.503 ≈ 0.222.

So, 1 - 0.222 = 0.778.

Divide by 0.09: 0.778 / 0.09 ≈ 8.644.

Wait, so the present value factor for the coupon payments is approximately 8.644.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 18 years is a long time, so the annuity factor should be higher than 5 or so. Wait, perhaps my approximation is off. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately, perhaps using a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity.

Wait another approach: let's compute (1.09)^18 accurately. Let me compute step by step:

But maybe it's better to use a calculator, but since I can't, I'll proceed with approximate values.

So, the present value of the coupon payments is 8% * 8.644 = approximately 69.152.

Wait, but wait, that would be the sum of the present value of each coupon. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Wait, the formula is:

PV of coupons = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

So, C=8, r=0.09, n=18.

So, (1 + 0.09)^18 = ?

Using logarithms, perhaps, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I can look up the exact value.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator to compute (1.09)^18.

But, since I can't, perhaps I'll accept that the present value of the annuity is roughly 8.644 * 8 = $69.15. So, the annuity part is $69.15.

Wait, but wait—wait, the present value of the coupons is the sum of 8/(1.09) + 8/(1.09)^2 + ... + 8/(1.09)^18.

Which is 8 * [1/(1.09) + 1/(1.09)^2 + ... + 1/(1.09)^18]

That's what I computed as 8 * 8.644 = 69.152.

Yes, that's correct. So the present value of the coupons is $69.15.

Wait, but wait another thing—since the present value is 8.644 * 8, that's correct.

Now, the next part is the present value of the $100 face value at the end of 18 years.

That's 100 / (1.09)^18.

We've calculated (1.09)^18 ≈ 4.503.

So, 100 /4.503 ≈ 22.21.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 4.503 * 22 = 99.066, which is close to 100. So 100 /4.503 ≈ 22.216. Approximately $22.22.

So, the total bond price is 69.15 + 22.22 = 91.37.

Wait, but wait, the answer options don't have 91.37. The closest option is A:91.17, which is a bit lower. Hmm, but I might have made some approximation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the (1.09)^18 calculation.

Let me compute (1.09)^18 more accurately.

We can break it down into:

(1.09)^10 = 2.36736

(1.09)^8 = 1.09^2 = 1.1881; ^4= (1.1881)^2 ≈ 1.4116; ^8 = (1.4116)^2 ≈ 1.992 (but wait, wait: 1.4116 * 1.4116 = let's calculate: 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96, 0.0116*1.4*2= 0.03248, and 0.0116^2 ≈ 0.00013456. So total is approx 1.96 + 0.03248 + 0.00013456 ≈ 1.9926.

So, 1.09^8 ≈ 1.9926.

So, 1.09^18 = 1.09^10 * 1.09^8 ≈ 2.36736 * 1.9926 ≈ let's calculate 2.36736 * 2 = 4.73472, but subtract 2.36736 * 0.0074 (since 1.9926 is 2 - 0.0074).

So 2.36736 *0.0074 = approximately 0.01766. So 4.73472 -0.01766 = 4.71706.

Wait, but wait, that can't be because 2.36736 * 2 is 4.73472, but 1.9926 is less than 2. So, 2.36736 * 1.9926 is about 4.71706. So (1.09)^18 ≈ 4.71706.

Wait, that's a bit less than what I thought earlier. So, (1.09)^18 ≈ 4.717.

So, 1/(1.09)^18 = 1/4.717 ≈ 0.212.

Wait, so 1/(1.09)^18 ≈ 0.212.

Wait, let me check: 4.717 * 0.212 ≈ 1.000, so yes, that's correct.

So, the present value of the face value is 100 * 0.212 = 21.2.

Now, the present value of the coupons is 8.644 * 8 = 69.152.

Wait, but wait: the present value factor for the coupons was 8.644? Let me double-check that.

Wait, the present value factor is [1 - (1.09)^-18]/0.09.

Which is [1 - 0.212 ] / 0.09 = 0.788 / 0.09 ≈ 8.7556.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 1/(1.09)^18 is 0.212, so 1 - 0.212 = 0.788, so 0.788 / 0.09 is approximately 8.7556.

Wait, so the present value of the coupons is 8 * 8.7556 = 69.7248.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8.644 *8=69.152. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (1.09)^-18. Let me re-calculate it.

Wait, (1.09)^18 is approximately 4.717, so (1.09)^-18 is 1/4.717 ≈ 0.212.

So, 1 - 0.212 = 0.788.

Divide by 0.09 → 0.788 /0.09 = 8.7556.

So, the present value of the coupon payments is 8 * 8.7556 = 69.7248.

So, coupons: $69.72.

Face value: $21.2.

Total price: 69.72 +21.2 =90.92.

Hmm, that's approximately $90.92.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:91.17 and option G:95.50.

Wait, but wait, perhaps my calculation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should use more accurate values for (1.09)^18.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the bond price.

Wait, another approach is to use a financial calculator or a formula. But since I don't have that, perhaps I can use a slightly more precise (1.09)^18.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity and the present value of a single sum.

Wait, perhaps I can find a table or another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the present value factor for n=18 and r=9% more accurately.

But perhaps I can use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the bond price formula again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the bond price as:

Price = 8 / 0.09 * [1 - (1.09)^-18 ] + 100 / (1.09)^18.

But wait, that's the same as what I did before. So, the price is 8*(1 - (1.09)^-18)/0.09 + 100/(1.09)^18.

So, if I compute it again accurately, perhaps the price is about $90.92, which is close to $91.17 or $91.37.

Wait, looking again at the options, option A is 91.17, which is close to what I have.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the present value of the coupons again.

Wait, another approach is to compute [1 - (1.09)^-18 ].

(1.09)^-18 = 1/(1.09)^18 ≈ 1/4.717 ≈ 0.2125.

1 - 0.2125=0.7875.

Divide by 0.09: 0.7875 /0.09 = 8.75.

So, 8 *8.75 =69.9999≈70.

Wait, wait, wait. So that's different. Earlier I thought 0.788 /0.09=8.7556, but if I use 0.7875, which is more precise, then 0.7875 /0.09 = 8.75.

So, 8 *8.75=69.9999, which is about $70.

Wait, that's a big difference. So, the present value of coupons is 70, and the present value of the face value is 21.2, so total is 70 +21.2=91.2.

Looking at the options, option A is 91.17 and option G is 95.50. So, 91.2 is closest to option A, which is 91.17.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the (1.09)^-18 calculation.

Let me think again: 1.09^18 is approximately 4.717. So, 1/(1.09)^18=0.2125.

So, 1 - 0.2125=0.7875.

0.7875 /0.09=8.75.

So, 8*8.75=70. So, 70 +21.2=91.2.

So, the price is approximately $91.20, which is closest to option A:91.17.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I should use the present value formula correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the bond price formula again. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a bond price as:

Price = C/(r) * [1- (1+r)^-n ] + F/(1+r)^n.

So, with C=8, r=0.09, n=18.

So that would be 8/0.09 * [1 - (1.09)^-18 ] + 100/(1.09)^18.

Which is the same as what I did earlier.

So, perhaps the correct answer is approximately $91.20, which is close to option A:91.17.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the present value of the coupons.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the formula for the bond price.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the bond price as:

Price = C/(r) * [1 - (1+r)^-n ] + F/(1+r)^n.

So, let's compute each part.

C=8, r=0.09, n=18.

So, 8/0.09=88.8889.

Then, [1 - (1.09)^-18 ]=0.7875.

So, 88.8889 *0.7875=69.9999.

Then, 100/(1.09)^18=21.2.

So, total price=69.9999 +21.2=91.1999, approximately $91.20.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:91.17. So, the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should check with a different approach. Let me compute the price again using a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the bond price:

Price = [C/(r)] * [1 - (1+r)^-n ] + F/(1+r)^n.

But perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the bond price as:

Price = C * [1 - (1+r)^-n ] / r + F/(1+r)^n.

So, let's compute each part.

First part: C * [1 - (1+r)^-n ] / r.

C=8, r=0.09, n=18.

So, (1.09)^18≈4.717.

So, 1 - 4.717^-1 =1 - (1/4.717)=1 -0.2125=0.7875.

Divide by 0.09: 0.7875/0.09=8.75.

Multiply by C=8: 8 *8.75=70.

Second part: F/(1+r)^n.

F=100, r=0.09, n=18.

So, (1.09)^18=4.717.

100 /4.717≈21.2.

So, total price:70 +21.2=91.2.

So, the price is approximately $91.20, which is closest to option A:91.17.

So, the correct answer is option A:91.17.
</think>

To determine the price of an 8% coupon bond with a face value of $100, a yield to maturity (YTM) of 9%, and a maturity of 18 years, we use the bond pricing formula:

\[
\text{Price} = \frac{C}{r} \left[ 1 - \left( 1 + r \right)^{-n} \right] + \frac{F}{\left( 1 + r \right)^n}
\]

Where:
- \( C = 8 \) (annual coupon payment),
- \( r = 0.09 \) (YTM),
- \( n = 18 \) (maturity),
- \( F = 100 \) (face value).

### Step 1: Calculate the present value of the coupon payments
\[
\frac{C}{r} \left[ 1 - \left( 1 + r \right)^{-n} \right] = \frac{8}{0.09} \left[ 1 - (1.09)^{-18} \right]
\]

First, compute \( (1.09)^{18} \approx 4.717 \). Thus, \( (1.09)^{-18} \approx 0.2125 \).

\[
\frac{8}{0.09} \left[ 1 - 0.2125 \right] = \frac{88.8889}{0.09} \times 0.7875 \approx 986.54 \times 0.7875 \approx 775.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the present value of the face value
\[
\frac{F}{(1 + r)^n} = \frac{100}{(1.09)^{18}} \approx \frac{100}{4.717} \approx 21.20
\]

### Step 3: Combine the two parts
\[
\text{Price} = 775.00 + 21.20 = 796.20
\]

### Step 4: Re-evaluate using accurate calculations
Using more precise values, the present value of the coupon payments and the face value yield:

\[
\text{Price} = \frac{8}{0.09} \left[ 1 - (1.09)^{-18} \right] + \frac{100}{(1.09)^{18}}
\]

\[
(1.09)^{18} \approx 4.717 \quad \text{and} \quad (1.09)^{-18} \approx 0.2125
\]

\[
\frac{8}{0.09} \times 0.7875 = 88.8889 \times 0.7875 \approx 69.9999
\]

\[
\frac{100}{4.717} \approx 21.20
\]

\[
\text{Price} \approx 69.9999 + 21.20 = 91.1999 \approx 91.20
\]

### Final Answer
The price of the bond is approximately **$91.20**, which is closest to **Option A: $91.17**.
