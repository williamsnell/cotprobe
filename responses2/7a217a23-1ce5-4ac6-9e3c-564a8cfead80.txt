Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. Let's try to figure it out. The question is asking which element doesn't have a partially filled 4f or 5f orbital. The options are A to D, Eu, Gd, Am, and Cu.

Hmm, I remember that transition metals have partially filled d orbitals. The 4f and 5f orbitals are higher energy levels; they don't get filled until the transition metals like Zn and beyond reach higher atomic numbers.

Wait, the question is about elements that have partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals. So which of these elements have such orbitals.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Eu is Europium. I recall that Eu has an electron configuration that includes 5f electrons. Like, its electron structure is [Kr] 4d^6 5s^1 5p^6 5f^1. So it does have a partially filled 5f orbital.

Option B: Gd is Gadolinium. Its electron configuration is [Kr] 4d^10 5s^1 5p^6 5f^1. So yes, it has a 5f orbital. Wait, but wait, I thought that 5f is filled when the element has more than a certain number of electrons. Like, if the element is in the third period for 4f and fifth for 5f.

Option C: Am is Amphotericium. Am's electron configuration is a bit tricky. I think Am has [Kr] 5s^1 5p^6 5f^1 6d^1, so it has a 5f orbital, but I'm not too sure. Wait, I remember that Am is a lanthanide and has 5f^1, so maybe it has a partially filled 5f.

Wait, but the question is about elements that have partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals. So if an element has 4f or 5f filled, it's included. If it doesn't, it's the exception.

Option D: Cu is Copper. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d^10 4s^1 4p^6. Oh wait, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Copper is in period 4, so 3d and 4s orbitals. Or wait, sometimes 4s fills before 3d. So, [Ar] 3d^10 4s^1. So does Cu have any 4f or 5f orbitals? No, because it's a transition metal in period 4. So it doesn't have 4f or 5f. So if the question is looking for an element that doesn't have such orbitals, then Cu would be the exception.

Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, the exception would be the element that doesn't have any 4f or 5f with any electrons. So, which of these elements doesn't have any 4f or 5f orbitals filled?

Looking back at the options:

Cu is in group 11, period 4. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d^10 4s^1. So 4s is filled but nothing in 4f or 5f. So it doesn't have any 4f or 5f orbitals. So that's the exception.

So the question is which element is the exception. The question is phrased as "all of the following EXCEPT", so which option is not included.

So the answer would be D: Cu.

To determine which element does not have a partially filled 4f or 5f orbital, we analyze the electron configurations of the given options:

- **Option A: Eu (Eurium)**  
  Eu has an electron configuration of [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s¹ 5p⁶ 5f¹. It has a partially filled 5f orbital.

- **Option B: Gd (Gadolinium)**  
  Gd has an electron configuration of [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s¹ 5p⁶ 5f¹. It also has a partially filled 5f orbital.

- **Option C: Am (Amphotericium)**  
  Am has an electron configuration of [Kr] 5s¹ 5p⁶ 5f¹ 6d¹. It has a partially filled 5f orbital.

- **Option D: Cu (Copper)**  
  Cu has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹. It does not have any 4f or 5f orbitals filled, as its electrons occupy 4s rather than 3d or higher orbitals.

The exception is **Cu (Copper)**, as it does not have any partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals. 

Answer: D
