Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Explain briefly the background and applications of BASIC computer language.

Options:

A: BASIC was developed by Microsoft to enhance the Windows operating system.
B: BASIC was created by IBM as a language to program mainframe computers and has limited use today due to its complexity.
C: BASIC stands for "Business Acquisition and System Integration Code" and is used mainly in the corporate finance sector.
D: BASIC is an advanced programming language used mainly for developing complex scientific simulations and models.
E: BASIC is an acronym for "Binary Algorithmic Scientific Instruction Code" and is used primarily in data analysis.
F: BASIC was developed in the 1950s as a language for artificial intelligence research.
G: BASIC is a language developed at Dartmouth College in the 1960s to make the computer more accessible and easy to use. It is widely used in science, business, and engineering due to its simplicity and similarity to English and algebra.
H: BASIC was developed in the 1980s to simplify computer programming.
I: BASIC is a language developed in the late 1970s for the exclusive use in graphical user interface design.
J: BASIC is a language primarily used in the field of arts and literature.

Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the background and applications of the BASIC computer language. Let me start by recalling what I know about BASIC.

BASIC stands for 'Beginning with Assembler.' It was developed in the 1960s, specifically in the late 1960s. I remember it's one of the earliest programming languages, introduced by IBM. The idea was to make programming easier for people who weren't very experienced with computers.

So looking at the options:

Option G says that BASIC was developed at Dartmouth College in the 1960s to make the computer more accessible and easy to use. This makes sense because I think Dartmouth College was involved in the development of such a language. They wanted to make programming less intimidating, which is exactly what BASIC aimed to achieve.

Other options don't fit as well. For example, option F mentions artificial intelligence research, but that's more of a later development. Option D talks about scientific simulations, which I don't think is correct. Option E refers to Binary Algorithmic Scientific Instruction Code, which doesn't match what I remember about BASIC. Options A, B, and C are about Microsoft and IBM, which are more about their products than the language itself. Option I talks about graphical user interface design, which is more related to modern software, not the original BASIC. Option J suggests it's for arts and literature, which is also incorrect. Option B says it's limited because of complexity, which I don't think is accurate; I believe it's widely used in various fields, including science, business, etc.

So the correct answer should be G. It accurately describes the development context and the purpose of BASIC.

The correct answer is G: BASIC was developed at Dartmouth College in the 1960s to make the computer more accessible and easy to use. 

Answer: G
