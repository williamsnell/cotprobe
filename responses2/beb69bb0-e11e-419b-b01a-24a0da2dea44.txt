Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the heat evolved when water freezes under constant pressure and a temperature of -10°C. Oh right, freezing is when water turns into ice, so it's a phase change from liquid to solid. 

The problem gives me some data. I remember from my notes that the heat of fusion (ΔH fus) is the amount of heat absorbed or released when a substance freezes at its freezing point. The formula I think is Q = m * ΔH. But wait, I need to be careful about the sign because heat evolved would be negative since it's released into the surroundings.

The given values are:
- ΔH_273 = -79.7 cal g⁻¹ (I think this is the molar enthalpy of fusion, but I'm not entirely sure about the units. Wait, it's given as per gram, so it's per gram. So per gram of water freezing.)
- (H2O)l = 1.00 cal K⁻¹ g⁻¹. Oh wait, that's the heat capacity at constant pressure for liquid water. And CP(s) is 0.49 cal K⁻¹ g⁻¹. So CP refers to the molar heat capacity, but the units here are per gram, which might mean it's the specific heat capacity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the units. Let's clarify. The standard ΔH for fusion is usually given in cal/g, right? Because it's the amount of heat per gram. So ΔH_fusion = -79.7 cal/g. So when water freezes, it releases that amount of heat per gram.

But wait, the formula for heat is Q = m * ΔH. So m is the mass of water. Oh but wait, since we're looking for the heat per gram, right? Because the given options are per gram. So maybe the answer is just -79.7 cal/g, but wait, looking at the options, option C is -79.7 cal g⁻¹. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem also gives me the specific heat capacities at constant pressure (CP) for liquid and solid states. Oh, right, because when water freezes, it's going through a phase change. So the heat released can also be calculated using the heat capacity change multiplied by the change in temperature.

Wait, but wait, the freezing point is at -10°C. So at freezing, the temperature is at -10. But the standard ΔH for fusion (ΔH_fusion) is given at 0°C. Oh, wait, but the problem is at -10°C. So does that matter? Or is the given ΔH_fusion actually at 0°C, and the freezing occurs at -10°C. Hmm. So perhaps the heat of fusion given is for the process at 0°C, but the actual freezing happens at -10°C. So how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, but I think the question is using ΔH_fusion as the heat per gram for freezing. So the ΔH is -79.7 cal/g. So the heat evolved would be Q = m * (-79.7) cal/g. But wait, the options are given per gram, so that's the answer. But let me make sure.

Wait, the problem says "the heat evolved in the process." So when water freezes, it releases heat. So the sign is negative. The freezing process is exothermic, so heat is evolved. So the heat evolved is negative.

Wait, but the given data might involve the heat capacities at constant pressure. Let me think about that. If I use the heat capacities, I can calculate the heat change using the formula Q = n * CP * ΔT. But wait, n is the number of moles, right? But perhaps since it's per gram, we can use m in grams.

Wait, let me write the formula again. The heat change during a phase change is Q = m * ΔH. Or, since it's a process at constant pressure, maybe it's using the formula Q = m * CP * ΔT. Because when you have a phase change at constant pressure, the heat is Q = m * CP * ΔT.

Wait, but wait, that's assuming the process is happening at constant pressure. Wait, the problem says it's at constant pressure. So for the freezing process, the heat is being released, so it's a phase change at constant pressure. So the formula would be Q = m * (ΔH_fusion). But the options are given per gram, so the answer would be -79.7 cal/g. So option C is -79.7 cal g⁻¹. So that's the answer.

Wait, but why are we given the other data about specific heat capacities? Oh, perhaps to verify the result. Let me see.

If I use the heat capacities, maybe I can get the same answer. So the change in temperature is from -10°C to 0°C, so ΔT is 10 K (since 1°C = 1 K). But wait, the freezing is from liquid to solid, so the temperature change is actually from -10°C to 0°C, a rise in temperature of 10 K. So the heat evolved would be Q = m * CP(solid) * ΔT. But wait, in this case, CP is the specific heat at constant pressure. Wait, but to calculate the heat for a phase change, when you have a process at constant pressure, the heat is Q = n * ΔH_fusion, where n is the number of moles. Alternatively, using the specific heat and the temperature change, Q = m * CP * (ΔT). But wait, that's for when you heat or cool a substance.

Wait, if I use m * CP * ΔT, but for a phase change, I think the formula would be Q = m * (ΔH_fusion). Because during phase change, it's not just a temperature change; it's also the enthalpy change. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. For the freezing process, which is a phase change, the heat Q is calculated using the enthalpy change, which is for per gram. So Q = m * ΔH_fusion. That would give the correct answer.

But why are other data points provided? Because I might have to calculate using the given CP values. Let me see. The question says that H2O(l) = H2O(s). So perhaps for the process, the heat is calculated both as the enthalpy of fusion and via the specific heat.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the heat using two different methods and see which one gives the same answer. Let me try that.

First method: using the given ΔH_fusion per gram. So Q = m * (-79.7 cal/g). Since the options are per gram, the answer would be -79.7 cal/g. But let me check other methods.

Second method: using the specific heat at constant pressure. For a phase change at constant pressure, the heat is Q = m * CP * ΔT. So the change in temperature is from -10°C to 0°C, so ΔT is 10 K. But wait, CP is given as 0.49 cal/(K·g). So Q = m * 0.49 cal/(K·g) * 10 K = m * 4.9 cal/g.

Wait, but that's different from the first method. So why is that?

Ah, because the phase change process isn't just a temperature change. It's a matter of whether the process is at constant pressure or not. So when you're calculating the heat change for a phase transition, you have to consider that it's a process at constant pressure. But how do you relate the heat change to the specific heat?

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think, the process of freezing is at constant pressure. So the heat evolved is Q = m * ΔH_fusion. But wait, the question gives me the specific heat capacities, so perhaps I can compute it another way.

Wait, the heat released when freezing is Q = m * (ΔH_fusion). So using this, Q = m * (-79.7 cal/g) = -79.7 m cal/g.

But in the other approach, using the specific heat, perhaps the heat is calculated as m * CP * (T) where T is the temperature change. Wait, the temperature change is from -10°C to 0°C. So that's +10 K. So m * 0.49 * 10 = m * 4.9 cal/g.

But that gives a different value. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the second method. Because the phase change occurs at constant pressure, but the heat capacity at constant pressure is for the process at constant pressure. So the actual heat change is m * ΔH_fusion.

So the two methods should agree. But they don't. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the application of the formula.

Wait, the problem states that the process is at constant pressure. So for the phase change, the heat Q is calculated using the enthalpy of fusion. So the answer should be -79.7 cal/g. So option C is the correct answer.

But wait, that's conflicting with the other approach. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, no. Because the specific heat at constant pressure is for the process at constant pressure, but to calculate the heat change for a phase change, you have to use the enthalpy change. So the two methods should yield the same answer. Hmm, but why isn't that the case here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.

Let me recap. The heat change for freezing is Q = m * ΔH_fusion.

But ΔH_fusion is the molar enthalpy of fusion. Oh wait, the given ΔH is per gram, not per mole. Because the given ΔH_273 is -79.7 cal/g. So that's per gram, meaning it's the enthalpy change per gram when freezing. However, the specific heat capacities are given in cal/(K·g) which is specific heat.

So when you have a phase change, the heat change can be calculated using Q = m * ΔH_fusion, where ΔH is per gram. Alternatively, using Q = m * C_p * ΔT, but only if the process is done at constant pressure. So for the freezing process, the temperature goes from -10°C to 0°C, so ΔT is 10 K. But wait, for freezing, the process is from liquid to solid, which is a decrease in temperature.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct formula for freezing is Q = m * ΔH_fusion. So the calculation would give Q = m * (-79.7 cal/g) = -79.7 m cal/g. So the answer is option C.

But why does the other method give a different result? Because the second approach uses m * C_p * ΔT, but that's only valid for processes where the temperature changes, but for a phase change, perhaps the process isn't isothermal. Wait, no, when you freeze, the temperature remains constant at 0°C (or -10°C in this case). So for freezing, the temperature doesn't change. So the heat is calculated using the enthalpy change, not through specific heat.

So the correct approach is to use the enthalpy of fusion, which is given as -79.7 cal/g. So the answer is option C: -79.7 cal/g.
</think>

To calculate the heat evolved during the freezing process of water, we use the enthalpy of fusion, ΔH_fusion, which is given as -79.7 cal/g. The heat evolved is calculated using the formula:

\[
Q = m \cdot \Delta H_{\text{fusion}}
\]

where \( Q \) is the heat evolved, \( m \) is the mass of water in grams, and \( \Delta H_{\text{fusion}} \) is the enthalpy of fusion per gram. Since the problem does not specify the mass of water, the answer is expressed per gram, and the result is -79.7 cal/g.

The other data points provided (specific heat capacities of liquid and solid water) are not directly relevant to this calculation because the freezing process occurs at constant pressure, and the heat evolved is determined by the enthalpy of fusion, not the specific heat capacities. 

Thus, the correct answer is:
