Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about European post-Pleistocene foods. I'm a bit rusty on my paleontology, but let me think it through.

The question asks about the "most prominent feature" of the food resource base of post-Pleistocene Europe. The options are A to D: dependence on megafauna, hunting and gathering, dependence on fur-bearing animals, and diversity.

I remember that the Pleistocene period was about 12 million years ago, and Europe experienced a lot of changes, especially the Last Ice Age. Post-Pleistocene refers to the time after that period, so maybe around the present or post-Mesozoan.

I think that after the Last Ice Age, Europe's的食物 sources changed. They probably became more diversified because they had access to more diverse animals. Megafauna are large animals like elephants, deer, and foxes. So option A says dependence on megafauna. But isn't that more of a recent change, like the rise of our ancestors, and maybe not the most prominent feature of the resource base?

Option B is hunting and gathering. That's a broad term, but I recall that in some periods, especially in the Pleistocene, Europe relied a lot on hunting and gathering. But the question is about the most prominent feature, so maybe something more specific like diversity or reliance on specific groups.

Option C is dependence on fur-bearing animals. I'm not too sure about this. I think some animals, maybe, but I'm not certain. I'll put this aside for now.

Option D is diversity. That sounds more accurate. If Europe's food sources became more varied, with different animals, then D would be the right answer. But wait, sometimes the options are a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, I remember that after the Last Ice Age, Europe started to diversify a lot in terms of what they ate. They were more likely to eat a variety of plants, not just the ones from megafauna. So the most prominent feature would be the diversity of their diet. So D would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, some sources say that post-Pleistocene Europe relied more on hunting and gathering because it was a more recent shift, but others might argue that diversity was a more prominent feature. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: megafauna include big predators, but maybe in the post-Pleistocene, the reliance on a diverse diet became more significant. So D is the most prominent feature.

I think I've read that Europe became more diverse after the ice age. So the right answer is D: diversity.

The most prominent feature of the food resource base of post-Pleistocene Europe is its dependence on a diverse diet rather than relying on a limited set of resources. This reflects a shift towards a more varied and balanced food system as the environment allowed for greater ecological diversity.

Answer: D
