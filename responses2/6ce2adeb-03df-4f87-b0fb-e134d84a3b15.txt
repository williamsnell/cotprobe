Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the pH when some NaOH is added to HCl. Both NaOH and HCl are strong electrolytes, so they completely dissociate in solution. 

The problem says we're adding 40 ml of 0.10 M NaOH to 10 ml of 0.45 M HCl. Hmm, I remember that when a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they neutralize each other to form water and a salt. The key is to find out which one is in excess and what the concentration of the resulting solution is.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each. Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L).

For NaOH: 0.10 M * 0.04 L (since 40 ml is 0.04 L) equals 0.004 moles. But wait, NaOH is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of NaOH gives one mole of OH- ions.

For HCl: 0.45 M * 0.01 L (10 ml is 0.01 L) equals 0.0045 moles. HCl is a strong acid; it dissociates completely, giving H+ ions.

Now, when they react, H+ and OH- will combine to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the moles of H+ from HCl are 0.0045, and the moles of OH- from NaOH are 0.004. 

Which is more? Let's see: 0.0045 > 0.004. So there's a excess of H+ ions. The excess moles would be 0.0045 - 0.004 = 0.0005 moles.

Wait, but wait. Oh, because the volumes are different. Oh, right, so I should calculate the total volume. The total volume is 40ml + 10ml = 50ml = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of the excess H+ is 0.0005 moles divided by 0.05 L. That's 0.0005 / 0.05 = 0.01 M, which is 1e-2 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. So, 0.0045 moles HCl and 0.004 moles NaOH. The H+ is 0.0045, OH- is 0.004. So, H+ is in excess by 0.0005 moles. Yes.

So the excess H+ is 0.0005 / 0.05 = 0.01 M. So the pH is the negative log of that. pH = -log(0.01) = 2. So the pH is 2.

Looking at the options, option B is 2. That should be the correct answer.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 40 mL of 0.10 M NaOH and 10 mL of 0.45 M HCl, we start by calculating the moles of each substance:

1. **Moles of NaOH**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.10 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.004 \, \text{moles}.
   \]
   NaOH is a strong base, so it dissociates completely, contributing 0.004 moles of \(\text{OH}^-\).

2. **Moles of HCl**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.45 \, \text{M} \times 0.01 \, \text{L} = 0.0045 \, \text{moles}.
   \]
   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, contributing 0.0045 moles of \(\text{H}^+\).

3. **Reaction between H\(^+\) and \(\text{OH}^-\)**:  
   The reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O} \). Since there are more \(\text{H}^+\) ions than \(\text{OH}^-\), \(\text{H}^+\) is in excess. The excess moles are:  
   \[
   0.0045 \, \text{moles (H}^+) - 0.004 \, \text{moles (OH}^-) = 0.0005 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

4. **Total volume of the solution**:  
   \[
   \text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{ml} + 10 \, \text{ml} = 50 \, \text{ml} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
   \]

5. **Concentration of excess \(\text{H}^+\)**:  
   \[
   [\text{H}^+] = \frac{0.0005 \, \text{moles}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **pH calculation**:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H}^+]} = -\log{0.01} = 2.
   \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is 2, which corresponds to option B.
