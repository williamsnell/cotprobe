Okay, so I have this math problem here: 0.3 multiplied by 427. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that multiplying decimals can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle it.

First, maybe I should break down the numbers to make it easier. Let's see, 0.3 is the same as 3 tenths, right? So 0.3 times 427 is the same as 3 tenths of 427. That might be easier to calculate than trying to multiply 0.3 by 427 directly.

Alternatively, I could do the multiplication as is, but that might involve decimals. Let me try the first approach: 3 tenths of 427. To find a tenth of 427, I can just divide 427 by 10, which gives me 42.7. Then, multiplying that by 3 should give me the answer. So, 42.7 times 3. Let me calculate that: 40 times 3 is 120, and 2.7 times 3 is 8.1. Adding those together, 120 + 8.1 equals 128.1. So that would be 128.1.

Wait, but I should make sure I did that correctly. Maybe I should try the other method to cross-verify. Let's try multiplying 427 by 0.3 directly. So, 427 multiplied by 0.3. Let me write it out:

427
× 0.3
--------

Starting from the right, 7 times 3 is 21, so I write down 1 and carry over 2. Next, 2 times 3 is 6 plus the carried 2 makes 8. Then 4 times 3 is 12. So putting it all together, it's 128.1. Yep, same result.

So the answer is 128.1, which is option A. Looking back at the options, option A is 128.1, so that's the correct choice.
