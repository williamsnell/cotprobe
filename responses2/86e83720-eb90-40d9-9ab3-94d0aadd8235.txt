Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about Dworkin's central arguments in Justice for Hedgehogs. I'm a bit fuzzy on some of the legal theory stuff, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question is asking which statement best describes one of Dworkin's central arguments. The options are A through J, and the last character of the answer must be the letter chosen.

First, I remember that Dworkin is a legal philosopher known for his concept of 'just justice,' which is sometimes referred to as 'Justice for Hedgehogs.' I think he's associated with the idea that the law can influence moral behavior, but in a way that's not purely objective.

Looking at the options:

A: The law is the only guide for ethical behaviour. That sounds more like the modern view, like utilitarianism, where the law is the only thing guiding behavior. But I don't think that's Dworkin's stance.

B: The law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behaviour. Hmm, this seems familiar. Dworkin's argument is that the law imposes ethical values on people. So the law can change their behavior, but it's not the only thing. So this might be correct.

C: Morality plays no role in the concept of law. That would mean the law is purely objective, but I think Dworkin believed that the law is influenced by moral values, not the other way around.

D: Moral arguments operate only in hard cases. I'm not sure about this one. I think Dworkin's focus was more on the influence of law on behavior rather than the type of case, though.

E: Legal principles should not be influenced by moral values. That seems opposite to what Dworkin said; he would think the law reflects moral values, not the other way around.

F: Legal principles should not be influenced by moral values. Wait, that's the opposite of E. I'm not certain.

G: Moral values are both independent and objective. I think Dworkin opposed this, saying the law does influence morality, maybe making it subjective.

H: Law and morality are entirely separate entities with no overlap. No, that doesn't make sense. They're intertwined.

I: Morality is subjective and changes over time. That rings a bell. Dworkin argued that morality isn't fixed; it evolves with the law and societal context.

J: Ethical behaviour is independent of moral values. That's not correct; Dworkin believed the law's effects are tied to morality.

From what I recall, Dworkin's central idea is that the law imposes ethical values on people. So option B says the law dictates what moral values affect their behavior. That seems to fit. But wait, let me think again. Does Dworkin think that the law is more than just a tool? Or does it reflect it?

Alternatively, option I says morality is subjective and changes over time. That's another important point. Dworkin's argument is that the law reflects and changes moral values. So the law is not just a guide but is influenced by them.

Putting it all together, the best fit is option B or I. But wait, the options are separate. Let me check the wording again.

Option B: The law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behaviour. That sounds correct because Dworkin argues that the law's structure is shaped by moral values, influencing people's behavior.

Option I says morality is subjective and changes over time. That's a point about Dworkin's view, but isn't the law's 'influence' on morality a separate statement? Or is that part of it?

Wait, in the question, the options are statements about Dworkin's arguments. So option B is a statement of Dworkin's argument, while option I is a separate point about morality being subjective.

But the question asks which statement best describes one of Dworkin's central arguments. So if the argument is about how the law influences morality, then B is the correct one.

Alternatively, option I is a separate point about morality, which is a part of his argument. So the question is about which statement is correct. So B is about the law's effect on morality, which is his main argument.

Wait, but another thought: I remember that Dworkin's idea is that the law is not just a guide but can be a source of morality. So the law is the source of moral values, making option B correct.

So I think the answer is B.

The correct answer is **B: The law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behaviour.**

Dworkin's argument centers on the idea that the law imposes ethical values onto individuals, shaping their behavior. This aligns with the statement that the law dictates the moral values that influence ethical actions. 

Answer: B
