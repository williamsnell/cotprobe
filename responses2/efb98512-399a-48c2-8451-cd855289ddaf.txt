Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about standing waves. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. The problem says that standing waves are produced by the superposition of two waves, y1 and y2. The given equations are y1 = 15 sin(3πt -5πx) and y2 = 15 sin(3πt +5πx). Wait, no, wait—wait, the way it's written, it's a bit unclear. Let me check again. Oh, the first equation is 15 sin(3πt - 5πx) and the second is 15 sin(3πt +5πx). Wait, no, wait—it says y_1=15 sin (3πt π rule 1pt 5x), and y_2=15 sin(3πt +5x). Oh wait, perhaps the first one is 3π t -5π x and the second is 3π t +5π x? Because the way it's written, the first equation has a rule that's missing. Oh, perhaps the first equation is sin(3π t -5π x) and the second is sin(3π t +5π x). Or maybe it's an error, and the second has a negative x term. I need to clarify.

Wait, perhaps the equations are y₁ =15 sin(3π t −5π x) and y₂ =15 sin(3π t +5π x). Because the way they are written, the first is 3π t with a minus, and the second is a plus. So when you superpose them, you get a standing wave.

So when two waves of the form y₁ = A sin(kx ± ωt) and y₂ = A sin(-kx ± ωt) superpose, the standing wave is formed. Wait, but the way the problem is written, the first equation is 3π t -5π x and the second is 3π t +5π x. So that would be y1 = 15 sin(3π t -5π x) and y2 = 15 sin(3π t +5π x).

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, the second equation is written as 3π t +5x. So perhaps it's 3π t plus 5π x. So y2 =15 sin(3π t +5π x). Hmm.

So when you construct the standing wave, you add y1 and y2. Let me think about what that looks like. Let me denote the two waves as y1 and y2.

y1 = 15 sin(3π t -5π x)
y2 = 15 sin(3π t +5π x)

So the sum y = y1 + y2 = 15 [sin(3π t -5π x) + sin(3π t +5π x)]

I remember that sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]

Let me apply that identity. Let A be (3π t -5π x) and B be (3π t +5π x). Then,

(A + B)/2 = [ (3π t -5π x) + (3π t +5π x) ] /2 = [6π t]/2 = 3π t.

(A - B)/2 = [ (3π t -5π x) - (3π t +5π x) ] /2 = [ -10π x ] /2 = -5π x.

So the sum becomes 15 [ 2 sin(3π t) cos(-5π x) ]

Wait, but since cos is even, cos(-5π x) = cos(5π x). So this simplifies to 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x).

So the standing wave is y = 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x).

In a standing wave, the amplitude varies with position x. The amplitude at any point x is the coefficient of the cosine term; that is, the amplitude is 30 cos(5π x).

Wait, but that's only if the initial configuration is such that the two waves are in phase and out of phase. Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The original y1 and y2 are both sine functions. When you add them, the result is a standing wave, which is a cosine function multiplied by sine of time, so the amplitude varies with x.

So the amplitude at a particular x is given by the amplitude of the standing wave, which is 30 cos(5π x).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the addition. When you have two sine waves, their sum can be written as a product of sine and cosine terms. So the expression I have is correct: y = 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x).

So the amplitude of the standing wave at position x is A(x) = 30 cos(5π x).

But wait, is that correct? Because standing waves are usually formed when two waves of the same amplitude but opposite phase shift (like y1 = A sin(kx + ωt) and y2 = A sin(kx - ωt)) superpose, which leads to a standing wave y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt). So the amplitude is 2A sin(kx), but wait, no, in that case the amplitude (amplitude of the standing wave) is 2A sin(kx), but wait, actually, perhaps I should rederive it.

Wait, let me re-derive the sum of two sinusoids. Let's say y1 = A sin(kx - ωt) and y2 = A sin(kx + ωt). Adding these together: 

y = A sin(kx - ωt) + A sin(kx + ωt) = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt) 

So the amplitude of the standing wave is 2A sin(kx). So in this problem, I have 15 sin(3π t -5π x) and 15 sin(3π t +5π x). So in this case, A is 15, and the terms inside the sine are (3π t ±5π x). 

So the sum is 2*15 sin(3π t) cos(5π x) = 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x). So the amplitude is 30 cos(5π x).

Wait, but is that correct? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the general form of a standing wave, which is y = 2 A sin(kx) cos(ωt). So in our case, the coefficient in front is 30, and the argument is 5π x. So 2 A sin(k x) = 30. So A would be 15, so 2 * 15 sin(kx) = 30 sin(kx). So yes, the amplitude is 30 sin(5π x), but wait, wait. Because in my problem, the amplitude is 15, so 2 *15 =30. So the amplitude is 30 sin(5π x).

Wait, but that's the amplitude of the standing wave. So the amplitude at x is 30 sin(5π x).

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

The problem says to find the amplitude at x=21. So the amplitude is 30 sin(5π *21). Let's compute that.

5π *21 = 105π. So sin(105π).

But sin(n π) is zero when n is integer. 105 is an integer. So sin(105π) = 0. Then the amplitude is 30 * 0 = 0.

Wait, so the amplitude at x=21 is zero. But looking at the options, G is 0. But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, another angle—maybe I was thinking about the standing wave in terms of the equation y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt), but in our problem, the expression is y = 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x). So the amplitude varies with x as 30 cos(5π x) ?

Wait, no, the amplitude isn't the same as the coefficient because the coefficient is multiplied by the cosine term, which depends on x. So, the amplitude of the standing wave at position x is 30 cos(5π x). Wait, no, wait. Because the amplitude is the maximum value of the wave, so the amplitude is the coefficient in front of the cosine term. So in the expression y=30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x), the coefficient before the cosine term is 30. So the maximum amplitude at any x is 30 times cos(5π x). But wait, that can't be, because the cosine function varies between -1 and 1. So the maximum amplitude would be when cos(5π x) is 1, so 30 * 1 =30, and when it's -1, -30, but since amplitude is positive, the maximum is 30.

But wait, that's not possible because the wave is a standing wave with amplitude varying with x, but in my earlier thought, I thought the amplitude was 30 sin(5π x). Now I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identity. Let me go back. The sum of y1 and y2 is:

y1 = 15 sin(3π t -5π x)
y2 = 15 sin(3π t +5π x)

Using the identity sin A + sin B = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 )

A = 3π t -5π x, B=3π t +5π x.

(A + B)/2 = (6π t)/2 =3π t.

(A - B)/2 = (-10π x)/2 = -5π x.

So sin A + sin B = 2 sin(3π t) cos(-5π x) = 2 sin(3π t) cos(5π x), since cos is even.

So the sum is y = 15 * [2 sin(3π t) cos(5π x)] = 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x).

Thus, the amplitude of the standing wave is 30 cos(5π x). Because for any x, the maximum amplitude is 30 times the cosine of 5π x. So at x=21, the amplitude is 30 cos(5π *21).

Wait, 5π *21 = 105 π. So cos(105 π) = cos(π*(105) ) = cos( π*(104 +1)) = cos(104π + π). Since 104 is even, cos(104π) = 1. So 104π + π = 105π. So cos(105π) = cos(π) = -1. So 30 * (-1) = -30. But amplitude can't be negative. So the maximum amplitude is 30, but at x=21, the wave is at a point where the cosine is -1, but the amplitude is the absolute value—wait, no. Wait, the amplitude is the maximum value of |y| at any point. So the amplitude is the coefficient in front of the cosine term, which is 30. Because even though the cosine is negative there, the amplitude is the maximum possible, which is 30. So the amplitude is 30.

Wait, but wait, in the expression y = 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x), the amplitude at x is 30 cos(5π x). So the maximum amplitude is 30, but the amplitude at x=21 is 30 cos(105π ). As I said, 105π is an odd multiple of π. So cos(105π) = cos(π) = -1. So 30 * (-1) = -30. But the amplitude can't be negative. Wait, but in the equation, the amplitude is the coefficient in front of the cosine. So the amplitude is 30, but the actual value of y is 30 sin(3π t) cos(5π x). The maximum value would be when sin(...) and cos(...) are 1, so 30.

Wait, but if the cosine is negative, then the actual amplitude would be 30 * (-1), but that would imply that the wave is at a point where it's moving in the opposite phase. However, the amplitude is the maximum value the wave can reach, regardless of direction. So the amplitude is the coefficient, which is 30. So at x=21, the amplitude is 30, but the actual displacement is -30. But the question asks for the amplitude, which is 30. So the correct answer should be 30, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. When x=21, 5π x=5π *21=105π. Cos(105π) = cos(π) = -1. So cos(105π) is -1. So the amplitude is 30 * (-1) = -30. But amplitude is a positive quantity, so it's 30. So the correct amplitude is 30. So the answer is B:30.

The problem involves standing waves produced by the superposition of two waves:

- \( y_1 = 15 \sin(3\pi t - 5\pi x) \)
- \( y_2 = 15 \sin(3\pi t + 5\pi x) \)

When these two waves are superposed, the resulting standing wave is given by:

\[
y = y_1 + y_2 = 30 \sin(3\pi t) \cos(5\pi x)
\]

The amplitude of the standing wave at a position \( x \) is determined by the coefficient of the cosine term, which is \( 30 \cos(5\pi x) \). The amplitude varies with \( x \), and the question asks for the amplitude at \( x = 21 \).

Substituting \( x = 21 \) into the expression for the amplitude:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = 30 \cos(5\pi \cdot 21)
\]

Simplify \( 5\pi \cdot 21 \):

\[
5\pi \cdot 21 = 105\pi
\]

Since \( \cos(105\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1 \), the amplitude becomes:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = 30 \cdot (-1) = -30
\]

However, amplitude is defined as a positive quantity, so the amplitude at \( x = 21 \) is \( 30 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 30**
