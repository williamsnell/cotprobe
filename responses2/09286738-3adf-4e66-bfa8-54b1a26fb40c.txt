Question:

You drive a beat-up pickup truck along a straight road for $8.4 \mathrm{~km}$ at $70 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$, at which point the truck runs out of gasoline and stops. Over the next $30 \mathrm{~min}$, you walk another $2.0 \mathrm{~km}$ farther along the road to a gasoline station.
What is your overall displacement from the beginning of your drive to your arrival at the station?

Options:

A: 9.4 km
B: 10.0 km
C: 12.0 km
D:  10.4 km
E: 11.4 km
F: 7.4 km
G: 6.4 km
H: 12.4 km
I: 8.4 km
J: 13.4 km

Okay, so I need to figure out the overall displacement from the start to the end point. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes me driving a pickup truck for 8.4 km at 70 km/h, then stopping. Then, I walk another 2.0 km farther along the road to a gasoline station. I need to find the overall displacement, which I think is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the ending point.

Hmm, displacement is a vector quantity, which means it depends on the straight-line distance and direction. So I should consider the start and end points in a straight line.

Wait, let's break it down. First, I drive 8.4 km at 70 km/h. Let me find out how long that took. Time equals distance divided by speed. So 8.4 km divided by 70 km/h. Let's calculate that: 8.4 / 70 is 0.12 hours, which is 7.2 minutes. But maybe I don't need the time here.

Next, I stop and then walk another 2.0 km. So the total path I've covered is 8.4 + 2.0 = 10.4 km. But displacement isn't the same as the total distance traveled because displacement is the straight line from start to end.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the direction. The truck was driving in a straight line, so displacement from start to end is 8.4 km. Because after driving, I didn't change direction. Then I walked another 2 km. So where am I now?

If I'm walking 2 km in the same direction, the total displacement from the start is 8.4 + 2.0 = 10.4 km. But wait, is that correct? Or is the displacement 8.4 km because I started at a point and ended at 8.4 km, then walked further along the same path to 10.4 km.

Wait, no. The problem says I continued driving for 8.4 km, then stopped and walked 2 km. So the starting point is the beginning of the drive. The end point is the point where I walked 2 km away from the pickup truck's stopping point.

Wait, the pickup truck driving part: I think I'm moving in a straight line, so the end point is 8.4 km from the start. Then I walked another 2 km, but that's along the same straight line. So the end point is 10.4 km from the start.

Wait, but that's the total displacement. Because displacement is the straight line from start to end. So if I started at point A, went to B (8.4 km), then walked 2 km to C (so AC is 8.4 + 2 = 10.4 km). So the displacement from A to C is 10.4 km.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-read the problem. The question asks for overall displacement from the beginning of the drive to arrival at the station. So the initial part is driving 8.4 km. Then after stopping, I start walking 2.0 km further. So the total distance I've covered is 8.4 + 2.0 = 10.4 km. But displacement is the straight line distance from start to end. So the end is 8.4 km from the start, and then I walked another 2 km, so end is 10.4 km from start.

So the displacement is 10.4 km. Looking at the options: option D is 10.4 km. So the answer should be D.

The problem involves calculating the overall displacement from the starting point to the final position after driving and walking. Displacement is the straight-line distance from the start to the end, regardless of the path taken. 

1. **Driving Part**: You drive 8.4 km at 70 km/h. The displacement during this part is 8.4 km in a straight line.
2. **Walking Part**: After stopping, you walk an additional 2.0 km in the same direction, continuing to move along the straight path. This adds 2.0 km to your position.

Since both segments are in the same direction, the total displacement is the sum of the distances:  
8.4 km (driving) + 2.0 km (walking) = **10.4 km**.

The options are provided, and the correct answer is **10.4 km**, which corresponds to option **D**.

**Answer: D: 10.4 km**
