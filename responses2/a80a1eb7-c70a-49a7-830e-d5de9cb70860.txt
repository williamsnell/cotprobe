Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about community-based mental health programs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm not too familiar with all the terms, but I remember some basic concepts about prevention and intervention types.

The question is asking about the primary goal of a newly-developed community-based mental health program. The scenario is that the program helps recently released people adjust to life in the community. The options are various types of interventions and prevention strategies.

First, I need to recall the definitions of each term. Let's see:

- **Early intervention**: This is when interventions are administered as quickly as possible, often in the first few weeks or months. It's usually used for conditions that can be addressed quickly, like acute stress or substance abuse.

- **Reactive intervention**: This happens when interventions are given after a person has already started the process. It's more for problems that develop over time, like chronic mental health issues that require time to improve.

- **Quaternary prevention**: Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I think prevention strategies are categorized into primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. Quaternary might be a less common term, perhaps referring to a broad category that includes various prevention strategies beyond the usual ones.

- **Emergency intervention**: This is when immediate help is provided. It's usually for emergencies, like a sudden medical emergency. Not really applicable here since the program is about adjusting, not dealing with immediate crises.

- **Crisis intervention**: This is similar to emergency intervention but might involve more structured approaches. Again, not sure if it's the right fit here.

- **Tertiary prevention**: I'm not sure what tertiary prevention entails. It might be a term I'm not familiar with. Perhaps it's a higher level of prevention, maybe involving community resources or multiple steps.

- **Primary prevention**: This is the general term for interventions aimed at preventing health problems in the first place. It's about early detection and treatment. Examples include education, behavioral interventions, and community programs.

- **Preventive care**: This is more about providing services to prevent problems, like mental health care. It's a broader term that includes interventions and prevention strategies.

Now, the question is about the primary goal of the community-based program. The program is about helping recently released people adjust to community life. That sounds like addressing their immediate transition, which is often a part of prevention.

Wait, but let me think about the types. Early intervention would be applied when someone is seriously ill or needs immediate care. Reactive intervention is for when they've started the process but haven't made full progress. The program described here seems like it's providing support as they transition, which is more about prevention than immediate intervention.

So, the primary goal is to help them adjust, which is part of prevention. Looking at the options, the primary prevention would be the general strategy, which is option G: primary prevention. Early intervention would be a type of prevention applied at the right time, but not the primary goal of the program.

Another angle: tertiary prevention might involve more systemic or long-term strategies, but I'm not certain. The question is about the program's primary goal, so it's more about the immediate support needed.

Therefore, the correct answer should be G: primary prevention.

The primary goal of the community-based mental health program is to help recently released individuals adjust to community life, which aligns with the concept of **primary prevention**. This strategy focuses on early detection and support, preventing health issues before they arise. 

Answer: G
