Okay, so I have this integral to compute: the double integral over the region V of 1/(1 + x + y + z)^3 dx dy dz. The region V is defined as the set of points where x, y, z are all non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds like a simplex in three dimensions. 

First, I need to set up the integral properly. Since all variables are non-negative and their sum is bounded by 1, I can think of the integration as being in the first octant, bounded by the plane x + y + z = 1. 

I remember that for integrating over such regions, it's often useful to switch to a change of variables to simplify the integration. A common approach for integrating over a simplex is to use a substitution where we let u = x, v = y, w = z, but that might not be the most straightforward. Alternatively, I can use a transformation that maps the simplex to a unit cube or another easier region.

Wait, another thought: sometimes it's easier to use substitution to shift the variables so that the sum x + y + z = 1 becomes a simpler boundary. For example, setting u = x + y + z. That might complicate things because then u would range from 0 to 1, but the other variables would have to be expressed in terms of u and maybe another variable. Alternatively, using a substitution like t = x + y + z, and then let u, v, w be the other variables, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe a more straightforward approach is to switch to a coordinate system where one variable is expressed in terms of the others. Let me try that. Let me define variables a, b, c such that x = a, y = b, z = c, but that's same as before. Hmm, maybe it's better to use substitution to shift variables. 

Another idea: Let me substitute u = x, v = y, w = z, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps using a substitution where we let t = x + y + z, but then we still have two variables to deal with. Alternatively, I can use a substitution that splits the variables into two parts. For example, let u = x + y + z, and then v = y and w = z. Then, the Jacobian determinant would be needed to change variables, which might get complicated.

Wait, let me think again. The integral is over x, y, z >=0, x + y + z <=1. So, this is a tetrahedron with vertices at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).

I think a good substitution for this is to use u = x + y + z, v = y, w = z. But that might complicate the limits. Alternatively, using a substitution where I fix the order of integration. Maybe I can express the integral in terms of u, v, w, where u is the sum, and v and w are the other variables. But I think the substitution might get messy. 

Alternatively, I remember that for integrals over simplices, it's often useful to change variables to reduce the number of variables. Let me try to fix the variables step by step. Suppose I integrate with respect to z first. For a given x and y, z ranges from 0 to 1 - x - y. Then, the integral becomes a double integral over x and y, with the inner integral over z from 0 to 1 - x - y.

So, the original integral I can write as:

I = ∫∫∫_{V} (1/(1 + x + y + z)^3) dx dy dz.

Changing the order of integration, I can integrate z first from 0 to 1 - x - y, then y from 0 to 1 - x, and then x from 0 to 1.

So, I = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} ∫_{z=0}^{1 - x - y} [1/(1 + x + y + z)^3] dz dy dx.

Now, let's compute the inner integral ∫ [1/(1 + s)^3] dz, where s = x + y + z. Since s is linear in z, the integral is straightforward.

Let me set s = x + y + z. Then, when z=0, s=x+y, and when z=1 - x - y, s=1. The differential ds = dz, so the integral becomes ∫_{s=x+y}^{1} [1/(1+s)^3] ds.

The integral of 1/(1+s)^3 with respect to s is ∫ (1+s)^-3 ds = (-1/2)(1+s)^-2 + C.

So, evaluating from s = x + y to s=1:

[ -1/(2(1)^2) + 1/(2(x + y)^2) ) ] = (-1/2) + 1/(2(x + y)^2).

So, that gives us:

(1/(2(x + y)^2) - 1/2).

So now, the integral I becomes:

I = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} [ (1/(2(x + y)^2) - 1/2) ] dy dx.

This seems a bit complicated, but let's try to compute it step by step.

Let me factor out the 1/2:

I = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} [1/(x + y)^2 - 1] dy dx.

Now, let's split this into two integrals:

I = (1/2) [ ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx - ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1 dy dx ].

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: ∫∫ 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = x + y. Then, when y=0, u=x; when y=1 - x, u=1. Also, du = dy. So, the inner integral becomes ∫_{u=x}^1 u^{-2} du.

The integral of u^{-2} is -u^{-1} + C. So evaluating from u=x to u=1:

[ -1/1 + 1/x ] = (1/x - 1).

So, the first integral becomes ∫_{x=0}^1 (1/x - 1) dx.

Wait, but hold on. The integral from x=0 to x=1 of (1/x - 1) dx. Hmm, but 1/x is problematic at x=0 because it diverges. That suggests that perhaps my substitution is incorrect, or maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me check. The original integral after substitution is ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx.

Wait, the inner integral is with respect to y, and we set u = x + y. So, when y=0, u=x; y=1 - x, u=1. So, the integral over y is ∫_{u=x}^{1} (1/u^2) du = [ -1/u ] from u=x to 1 = (-1/1) - [ -1/x ] = (-1) + (1/x) = (1/x - 1).

But then the first integral becomes ∫_{x=0}^1 (1/x -1) dx, which is problematic because as x approaches zero, 1/x tends to infinity. That suggests that the integral might not converge, but that's impossible because the original integral is finite.

Wait, this can't be right because the original integral is over a finite region, so it must be finite. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution or the setup.

Wait, let me double-check. The inner integral was over z from 0 to 1 - x - y. So, s = x + y + z varies from x + y to 1. The integral with respect to z becomes ∫_{s=x+y}^{1} [1/(1+s)^3] dz. Since s = x + y + z, and dz is integrated over, but the variable of integration is z, so the substitution is correct. The inner integral in terms of s is correct.

Wait, but maybe when I split the integral into two parts, I made a mistake. Let me see:

I = (1/2) [ ∫∫ 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx - ∫∫ 1 dy dx ].

So, let's compute each part.

First part: ∫∫ 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx.

As before, substitution u = x + y, du = dy. So, inner integral is ∫_{u=x}^1 u^{-2} du = [1/u] from x to 1, which is (1/1 - 1/x) )= (1 - 1/x) = (x - 1)/x.

Wait, no, wait: [1/u] from x to 1 is [1/1 - 1/x] = (1 - 1/x).

Wait, but that would be 1/x -1? No, 1/1 is 1, and 1/x is as it is. So, 1 - (1/x) = (x -1)/x.

Wait, but then the first integral is ∫_{x=0}^1 (x -1)/x dx. Hmm, that's ∫ (1 - 1/x) dx, which from x=0 to x=1. But wait, 1/x diverges as x approaches zero, so this integral would be divergent. That can't be right because the original integral is finite.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again.

Wait, the inner integral is ∫ [1/(1 + x + y + z)^3] dz. Let me make the substitution t = 1 + x + y + z. Then, dt = dz. When z=0, t=1 + x + y; when z=1 - x - y, t=1 + x + y + (1 - x - y) )= 2. So, the inner integral becomes ∫_{t=1 + x + y}^{2} [1/t^3] dt.

The integral of 1/t^3 is [ -1/(2 t^2) ] + C.

So, evaluating from t=1+x+y to t=2:

[ -1/(2*(2)^2) ) + 1/(2*(1 + x + y)^2) ) ] = [ -1/8 + 1/(2*(1 + x + y)^2) ].

So, the inner integral is (1/(2*(1 + x + y)^2 )) - (1/8).

Then, the entire integral I is:

I = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} [ (1/(2*(1 +x + y)^2) ) - (1/8) ] dy dx.

So, that's the correct setup. Now, this integral should be finite because the original integral is over a bounded region.

Let me rewrite this as:

I = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} [1/(1 + x + y)^2 ] dy dx - (1/8) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1 dy dx.

Now, let's split the first integral into two parts:

I = (1/2) [ ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1/(1 + x + y)^2 dy dx ] - (1/8) [ ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1 dy dx ].

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: J = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1/(1 + x + y)^2 dy dx.

Let me perform substitution for the inner integral. Let u = 1 + x + y. Then, du = dy. When y=0, u = 1 + x; y=1 - x, u=2.

So, the inner integral becomes ∫_{u=1+x}^{2} 1/u^2 du = [ -1/u ] evaluated from 1+x to 2.

That's [ -1/2 + 1/(1 + x) ] = (1/(1 + x) - 1/2).

So, J = ∫_{x=0}^1 [ (1/(1 + x) - 1/2) ] dx.

This can be split into two integrals:

J = ∫_{0}^1 1/(1 + x) dx - (1/2) ∫_{0}^1 1 dx.

The first integral is ∫ 1/(1+x) dx = ln(1 + x) + C. Evaluated from 0 to 1: ln(2) - ln(1) = ln(2).

The second integral is (1/2)*(1 - 0) )= 1/2.

So, J = ln(2) - 1/2.

Now, the second part: K = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 - x} 1 dy dx.

The inner integral ∫_{0}^{1 -x} 1 dy = (1 - x).

So, K = ∫_{x=0}^1 (1 - x) dx = ∫ 1 dx - ∫ x dx from 0 to 1.

The first integral is 1, the second is 1/2, so K = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Putting it all together:

I = (1/2)*J - (1/8)*K = (1/2)(ln2 - 1/2) - (1/8)(1/2).

Simplify each term:

(1/2) * ln2 = (1/2) ln2.

(1/2) * (-1/2) = -1/4.

(1/8) * (1/2) = 1/16.

So, I = (1/2 ln2) - 1/4 - 1/16.

Combine the constants:

-1/4 is -4/16, so -4/16 -1/16 = -5/16.

Thus, I = (1/2) ln2 - 5/16.

Now, compute numerical values:

ln2 ≈ 0.6931.

So, (1/2)*0.6931 ≈ 0.3466.

5/16 is 0.3125.

So, I ≈ 0.3466 - 0.3125 = 0.0341.

Looking at the options, E is 0.034 and J is 0.056. But wait, I got approximately 0.0341, which is closer to option E (0.034).

Wait, but let me check the calculations again because sometimes I might make a mistake in substitution.

Wait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution for the inner integral. Let me double-check.

In the original substitution for J, the inner integral after substitution was (1/(1+x) - 1/2).

Wait, when I split J into ln(2) - 1/2.

Then, I = (1/2)(ln 2 - 1/2) - (1/8)(1/2).

Calculations:

(1/2)ln2 ≈ 0.3466.

(1/2)*(-1/2) = -1/4.

(1/8)*(1/2) = 1/16.

So, I ≈ 0.3466 - 0.25 - 0.0625 = 0.3466 - 0.3125 = 0.0341.

Yes, that's correct. So, the integral is approximately 0.034, which is option E (0.034). 

But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I computed the first integral J as ln2 - 1/2, when I then multiplied by 1/2, it's (1/2)(ln2 - 1/2). Then subtracting (1/8)(1/2) which is 1/16.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.5*(0.6931) = 0.34655, and -0.5*(0.5) is -0.25. So, 0.34655 - 0.25 = 0.09655. Then subtract 1/16 (which is 0.0625), so 0.09655 - 0.0625 = 0.03405.

Hmm, 0.03405 is approximately 0.034, which is option E.

Wait, but let me think again. The integral is positive, but earlier when I tried to compute for the first integral, I thought it diverges. But perhaps I made a mistake there. Maybe the integral does converge.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me try to compute J again.

J = ∫_{x=0}^1 [1/(1+x) - 1/2 ] dx.

Integrate term by term:

∫ 1/(1+x) dx = ln(1+x) + C.

So, from 0 to 1: ln2 - ln1 = ln2.

∫ (−1/2) dx from 0 to1 is −1/2 (1 - 0) )= −1/2.

So, J = ln2 − (1/2).

Which is approximately 0.6931 − 0.5 = 0.1931.

Wait, earlier I thought J was ln2 - 0.5, but that's correct.

Then, I = (1/2) J - (1/8) K.

Which is (1/2)(ln2 - 0.5) ) - (1/8)(0.5).

So,

(1/2)(0.6931 - 0.5) = (1/2)(0.1931) = 0.09655.

Then, subtract (1/8)(0.5) = 0.0625.

So, 0.09655 - 0.0625 = 0.03405.

Hmm, that's about 0.034. So, the correct answer would be option E (0.034).

But wait, I think I made an error in the substitution when computing J. Let me check:

Original J is ∫∫ 1/(1 +x + y)^2 dy dx.

After substitution u = x + y, du = dy. So, ∫_{u=x}^{1} [1/u^2 ] du.

The integral of 1/u^2 is -1/u.

So, evaluated from u=x to u=1, it's (-1/1) - (-1/x) )= (-1) + (1/x) )= (1/x - 1).

So, J = ∫_{x=0}^1 (1/x -1) dx.

But this integral is ∫_{x=0}^1 (1/x -1) dx.

Wait, that's problematic, because 1/x is not integrable at x=0.

So, what's wrong here? Because according to the integral, J is divergent, but according to the problem statement, the original integral is finite. So, I must have made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let me re-examine the substitution. Let me try to compute J = ∫∫ 1/(1+x+y)^2 dy dx.

Let me change the order of integration first. Instead of integrating z first, I can integrate y first.

So, I = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} ∫_{z=0}^{1 -x - y} [1/(1 + x + y + z)^3 ] dz dy dx.

Compute the inner integral with respect to z.

Let u = x + y + z.

When z=0, u = x + y.

When z=1 -x - y, u = 1.

So, the inner integral is ∫_{u=x+y}^{1} [1/u^3 ] du.

The integral of 1/u^3 is (-1/2) u^{-2} + C.

So, evaluating from u=x+y to 1:

[ (-1/2)(1)^-2 ) ] - [ (-1/2)(x + y)^-2 ) ] = ( -1/2 ) - ( -1/(2(x + y)^2 ) ) = ( -1/2 + 1/(2(x + y)^2 ) ) = (1/(2(x + y)^2 ) - 1/2 ).

So, the inner integral is (1/(2(x + y)^2 ) - 1/2 ).

Now, the integral I becomes:

I = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} [1/(2(x + y)^2 ) - 1/2 ] dy dx.

Split this into two integrals:

I = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx - (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1 dy dx.

Let me evaluate each part.

First part: A = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx.

Compute the inner integral ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(x + y)^2 dy.

Let u = x + y. du = dy. When y=0, u=x; y=1 -x, u=1.

Integral becomes ∫_{u=x}^{1} 1/u^2 du = [ -1/u ] from x to 1 = ( -1/1 ) - (-1/x ) )= -1 + 1/x = (1/x - 1).

So, A = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 (1/x -1 ) dx.

But as before, this integral is ∫ (1/x -1 ) dx = ln x - x + C. But at x=0, ln x approaches negative infinity. So, this suggests that the integral diverges, which can't be correct because the original integral is finite.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the integral is finite, so perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should compute A directly.

A = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(x + y)^2 dy dx.

Let me compute the inner integral first: ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(x + y)^2 dy.

Let u = x + y. Then, du = dy. When y=0, u=x; y=1 -x, u=1.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=x}^{1} (1/u^2 ) du = [ -1/u ] from x to 1 = (-1/1) - (-1/x ) = (-1) + (1/x) )= (1/x - 1).

So, A = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 (1/x -1 ) dx.

But this integral is ∫ (1/x -1 ) dx = ln x - x + C. Evaluated from x=0 to x=1.

Wait, but ln x approaches negative infinity as x approaches 0. So, the integral is divergent. That implies that the original integral is divergent, but that's not the case because the region V is bounded.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the change of variables from (x, y) to (u, v) where u = x + y and v = x.

Let me try that substitution.

u = x + y.

v = x.

So, x = v.

y = u - v.

Jacobian determinant is |∂(x,y)/∂(u,v)| = 1. So, du dv = dx dy.

The region V is defined by x >=0, y >=0, x + y <=1.

So, in terms of u and v, u >=0, v >=0, and v + (u -v ) <=1 → u <=1.

But u = x + y, and u >=0.

So, the region in u and v is u >=0, v >=0, v <=u <=1.

So, the integral A becomes:

A = (1/2) ∫_{u=0}^1 ∫_{v=0}^{u} (1/(v + (u - v ))^2 ) dv du.

Wait, but v + (u - v ) = u. So, 1/u^2.

So, A = (1/2) ∫_{u=0}^1 ∫_{v=0}^u 1/u^2 dv du.

But the inner integral ∫_{v=0}^u 1/u^2 dv = (1/u^2) * u = 1/u.

So, A = (1/2) ∫_{u=0}^1 (1/u ) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u ) du = ln u + C.

Evaluated from u=0 to u=1, ln1 - ln0 = 0 - (-infty) = infty. So, this suggests that the integral diverges, which can’t be correct because the original integral is finite.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution of variables. Let me try a different approach.

Let me try to compute the integral numerically.

Compute the triple integral over the region x, y, z >=0, x + y + z <=1.

The integrand is 1/(1 + x + y + z)^3.

We can compute this numerically using a triple integral approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the gamma function and change of variables to express the integral in terms of beta functions, which might be easier to evaluate.

But perhaps I should instead proceed to compute the integral numerically.

Let me compute I = ∫∫∫ [1/(1 +x + y + z)^3 ] dx dy dz, where x, y, z >=0 and x + y + z <=1.

We can compute this by changing the order of integration.

Let me compute the inner integral first. The inner integral is over z, from z=0 to z=1 -x -y.

So, I = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} [ ∫_{z=0}^{1 -x -y} [1/(1 +x + y + z)^3 ] dz ] dy dx.

Compute the inner integral with respect to z.

Let me make the substitution u = 1 +x + y + z. Then, du = dz.

When z=0, u=1 +x + y.

When z=1 -x -y, u=2.

So, the inner integral becomes ∫_{u=1 +x + y}^{2} [1/u^3 ] du.

The integral of 1/u^3 is ∫ u^{-3} du = (u^{-2}) / (-2 ) + C.

So, evaluating from u=1+x+y to u=2:

( (2)^{-2} ) / (-2 ) - ( (1+x+y)^{-2} ) / (-2 ) )

= ( (4)^{-1} ) / (-2 ) - ( (1+x+y)^{-2} ) / (-2 )

= (1/4 ) * ( -1/2 ) - (1/(1+x+y)^2 ) * ( -1/2 )

= (-1/8 ) + (1)/(2(1+x+y)^2 )

So, the inner integral is (1/(2(1+x+y)^2 )) - (1/8 ).

Now, the integral I becomes:

I = ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} [ (1/(2(1+x+y)^2 )) - (1/8 ) ] dy dx.

Let me split this into two integrals:

I = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(1+x+y)^2 dy dx - (1/8) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1 dy dx.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: I1 = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(1 +x + y)^2 dy dx.

Compute the inner integral ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1/(1 +x + y)^2 dy.

Let u = 1 + x + y. Then, du = dy. When y=0, u=1 + x; y=1 - x, u=2.

Integral becomes ∫_{u=1+x}^{2} 1/u^2 du = [ -1/u ] from u=1+x to u=2.

= ( -1/2 ) - ( -1/(1+x) ) ) = ( -1/2 ) + (1/(1+x)) ) = (1/(1+x) - 1/2 ).

So, I1 = (1/2) ∫_{x=0}^1 [ (1/(1+x) - 1/2 ) ] dx.

Compute this integral:

I1 = (1/2) [ ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx - ∫ (1/2) dx ].

The first integral is ln(1+x) + C, evaluated from 0 to1: ln2.

The second integral is (1/2)(1 -0 )= 1/2.

So, I1 = (1/2) [ ln2 - 1/2 ].

Now, compute the second part: I2 = (1/8) ∫_{x=0}^1 ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1 dy dx.

The inner integral ∫_{y=0}^{1 -x} 1 dy = (1 -x).

So, I2 = (1/8) ∫_{x=0}^1 (1 -x ) dx.

Compute this integral:

∫ (1 -x ) dx from 0 to1 is [x - (x^2)/2 ] from 0 to1 = (1 - 0.5 ) - (0 -0 ) = 0.5.

So, I2 = (1/8) * 0.5 = 1/16.

Now, putting it all together:

I = I1 - I2 = (1/2)(ln2 - 1/2) - 1/16.

Compute this:

= (1/2) ln2 - (1/2)(1/2) - 1/16.

= (1/2) ln2 - 1/4 - 1/16.

Convert to sixteenths:

= (8/16) ln2 - 4/16 - 1/16.

= (8 ln2 -5 ) /16.

Wait, but earlier I thought I was getting approximately 0.034, which is about (8 ln2 -5)/16 ≈ (8*0.6931 -5)/16 ≈ (5.5448 -5)/16 ≈ 0.5448/16 ≈ 0.034, which matches option E.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I had (1/2) ln2 - 5/16, that's correct. Let me compute this.

(1/2) ln2 ≈ 0.5 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.3466.

5/16 ≈ 0.3125.

So, 0.3466 - 0.3125 ≈ 0.0341.

So, I = (8 ln2 -5 ) /16 ≈ 0.0341, which is option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 0.034, which is option E. So, that's correct.

But wait, let me confirm that this is correct. Because according to the integral, I = (8 ln2 -5 ) /16 ≈ 0.0341.

So, the correct answer is option E, 0.034.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the change of variables. Let me check the substitution again.

I made the substitution u = 1 +x + y + z. Then, u ranges from 1 to 2. The inner integral was correct.

But when I compute the inner integral, I get (1/(2(1+x+y))) - (1/8 ).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying the inner integral.

Wait, the inner integral is (1/(2(1+x+y))) - (1/8).

Wait, when I compute I1 = (1/2) ∫ [ (1/(1+x) - 1/2 ) ] dx.

Wait, ∫ [ (1/(1+x) - 1/2 ) ] dx = ∫1/(1+x) dx - ∫1/2 dx = ln(1+x) - (x/2 ) + C.

So, I1 = (1/2) [ ln(1+x) - (x/2 ) ] evaluated from x=0 to1.

At x=1: ln(2) - (1/2 ).

At x=0: ln(1) -0 =0.

So, I1 = (1/2)( ln2 -1/2 ).

That's correct.

Now, I2 = (1/8) ∫ (1 -x ) dx from0 to1.

Which is (1/8)(1 - 0.5 )= (1/8)(0.5 )=1/16.

So, I = (1/2)(ln2 - 1/2 ) -1/16.

= (1/2) ln2 - 1/4 -1/16.

= (1/2) ln2 - 5/16.

Which is equal to (8 ln2 -5 ) / 16.

So, the correct value is approximately 0.0341.

Thus, the answer is option E, 0.034.

But wait, the initial integral I thought was 0.034, but in the options, let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.05

B: 0.01

C: 0.042

D: 0.02

E: 0.034

So, correct answer is E: 0.034.

But wait, in my calculation, I have I = (8 ln2 -5 ) /16 ≈0.0341.

So, the correct answer is E: 0.034.

But earlier, I thought I had a mistake because the first part was ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx which is ln(1+x). But let me make sure.

Yes, ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from0 to1 is ln2.

So, everything seems correct.

So, the correct answer is E: 0.034.
</think>

We compute the integral over the region \( V \) where \( x, y, z \geq 0 \) and \( x + y + z \leq 1 \). The integrand is \( \frac{1}{(1 + x + y + z)^3} \).

Using the substitution \( u = 1 + x + y + z \), we transform the integral and evaluate it step by step. The integral simplifies to:

\[
I = \frac{8 \ln 2 - 5}{16} \approx 0.0341
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.034**
