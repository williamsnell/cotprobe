Okay, so I need to figure out how to convert Celsius to Kelvin. I remember that the Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, and its zero point is absolute zero, which is equivalent to -273.15°C. But wait, sometimes people use a rounded value of 0°C as 273.15 K. So, the formula is K = °C + 273.15.

The question is about expressing 20°C and -5°C on the Kelvin scale. Let me break this down step by step.

First, starting with 20°C. I'll add 273.15 to this value. So, 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K. Hmm, but wait, sometimes the options are using rounded numbers. Let me check the options. Oh, I see option H is 293K and 278K. Hmm, but wait, 20 + 273 is 293, but 20 + 273.15 would be 293.15. So, that's approximately 293 K, maybe rounded to 293. So, 20°C would be approximately 293 K.

Now the second temperature, -5°C. Adding 273.15 to -5. So, -5 + 273.15 = 268.15 K. Rounded, that's about 268 K. Let me look at the options again. Option H is 293K and 278K. Wait, but that second value is 278, not 268. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no. Let me double-check. 20°C: 20 + 273.15 is 293.15 K. Rounded, 293 K. Correct. The other value, -5°C: -5 + 273.15 = 268.15 K. So, 268 K. So, the two values should be 293 K and 268 K.

Looking at the options, option H is 293K and 278K. Wait, that can’t be right because 268 isn’t 278. Did I run the calculation wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, 20°C is 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K. Which is approximately 293 K.

-5°C: -5 + 273.15 = 268.15 K. So, 268 K.

So, the correct Kelvin values are 293 and 268 K.

Looking back at the options:

Option H: 293 K and 278 K. Hmm, I definitely have 268 for the second one. None of the options have 268 except option H for the second value. Wait, did I miscalculate?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question expects the Kelvin to be calculated without rounding, so 273.15 is added.

So, 20°C is 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K. So, that's 293.15 K. The options don't list this as exact, so perhaps the options are using approximate values.

Looking at the options, option H is 293K and 278K. Wait, 278 is not correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait a second: when converting, is it 273.15 or 273? Because sometimes I've seen the formula written as K = °C + 273, which would be 273, not 273.15. So if that's the case, 20°C would be 293 K (20 + 273 = 293). And -5°C would be -5 + 273 = 268 K. So, the two values are 293 and 268 K.

Looking at the options, option H is 293K and 278K. That's not matching. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 20°C to K: 20 +273.15= 293.15 K. So, 293 K.

-5°C to K: 268.15 K, which is 268 K.

So what's the option? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 310 and 260 → no, that's too high.

B: 280 and 268 → 280 is 280 K, which is 280-273=7°C. So that would be 7°C, not 20. So B is wrong.

C: 273, 248. 20°C would be 293, which is higher than 273. So C is wrong.

D: 303 and 258. 20°C → 293, so D is 303, that's 30°C. So D is wrong.

E: 300 and 250. 20°C→300? No, 20+273=293. So E is wrong.

F: 293 and 268 → 293 is correct for 20°C. 268 is correct for -5°C. So F is 293 K and 268 K.

Wait, but option F is 293 K and 268 K. So that's matching what I calculated. So the correct answer would be F.

But wait, the options are from A to J, and the question is about 20°C and -5°C.

Wait, but when I look at the options:

Option F is 293K and 268K.

So that would be correct. But wait, earlier I thought that the correct calculation was 293 and 268, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 293K and 278K. So I'm confused because according to this, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the options don't have a correct one, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the user wrote the options with the Kelvin values, but maybe the second number is the Celsius value? No, the question is clear: 20°C and -5°C to Kelvin.

So 20°C → 293.15 K, and -5°C → 268.15 K.

So the Kelvin values are 293 K and 268 K.

Looking for the option with 293K and 268K.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: 293 K and 268 K → yes. So the correct answer is F.

But wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Because 20°C is 293.15 K, but option F is 293 K and 268 K. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: do they round the Kelvin temperatures to the nearest degree? For example, 293.15 K would be 293 K. 268.15 K is 268 K.

So the correct Kelvin values are 293 and 268 K.

Looking at the options, option F is 293 K and 268 K. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait, looking back, I see option H is 293 K and 278 K. So why the discrepancy? Because 268 is not 278. So how could I have gotten that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation, and the correct value is 278 K. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, no, 20°C. 20 + 273.15 is 293.15, which is 293 K. So that's correct.

Wait, what if someone uses 273 instead of 273.15? Then 20°C would be 293 K (20+273=293). And -5°C would be 268 K (268). So the options that have 293 and 268 would be correct.

Looking at the options again, F is 293K and 268K. So the correct answer should be F.

But wait, looking at the options, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Some sources say that Kelvin is 273.15 plus Celsius, but perhaps in some cases, they use 273.

In that case, 20°C in Kelvin is 293 K (20+273=293). And -5°C is 268 K (268). So the correct option is F.

So why is option H in the options? Because it's 293 and 278. But 278 is incorrect. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, 20°C: 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K.

-5°C: -5 + 273.15 = 268.15 K.

So, 293.15 K and 268.15 K. But the options don't have that. So the closest option would be F.

But wait, let me see the options again.

Looking at F: 293K and 268K. So that fits. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the user's options are:

A:310K and 260K → no

B:280 and 268 → no

C:273 and 248 → no.

D:303 and 258 → 303 is 303°C, which is 303-273=30°C. So D is wrong.

E:300 and 250 → way too high.

Wait, no, E is 300K and 250K. 300 = 300-273=27°C. So E is 27°C, which is not 20°C. So E is wrong.

F:293K and 268K → correct for 20 and -5.

G:295K and 275K → 295-273=22°C, which is not 20.

H:293 and 278 → 278-273=5°C. So that would imply it's 5°C, but the problem states we need -5°C. So H is wrong.

So the correct answer is F.

To convert temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin, the formula is:

\[
K = °C + 273.15
\]

### Step 1: Convert 20°C to Kelvin
\[
20°C + 273.15 = 293.15 K
\]

### Step 2: Convert -5°C to Kelvin
\[
-5°C + 273.15 = 268.15 K
\]

### Step 3: Match the results to the options
The two values are approximately **293.15 K** and **268.15 K**. Rounding to the nearest whole number, these correspond to **293 K** and **268 K**.

### Step 4: Identify the correct option
Looking at the options provided:

- **F: 293 K and 268 K**

This matches the calculated values.
