Okay, so I have this question here about a manufacturer's profit percentage. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says the manufacturer sells his merchandise at 135% of the cost. I need to find his percent of gain. Hmm, wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Does it mean the selling price is 135% of the cost price or is it the cost including some other factors?

Wait, the way it's phrased is that he sells at 135 percent of the cost. So, if the cost is, say, $100, he sells it for $135. That would mean he made a profit of $35 on the cost of $100. So the profit percentage would be 35% of the cost, right?

But wait, sometimes "gain" refers to profit as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost. So I need to clarify which one the question is asking for.

The question says, "Find his percent of gain." The word "percent of gain" typically refers to the profit as a percentage of the cost. Let me think about this again. If the cost is $100, selling price is $135, then the profit is $35, which is 35% of the cost. So yes, that would make it 35% gain.

Let me check the options again. Option A is 35%, which matches this scenario. So I think the answer should be A.

The manufacturer sells merchandise at 135% of the cost, meaning he sells each item for 1.35 times the cost. The profit is the difference between the selling price and cost. Here, the profit is 0.35 times the cost, which is 35% of the cost. Therefore, the correct answer is 35%, which is option A.
