Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about mixing benzene and isopentane under certain conditions. Hmm, the question says they're mixed at 1.5 atm pressure and 110°F. I need to find the compositions of both the liquid and vapor using Raoult's law.

Wait, so Raoult's law says that the partial vapor pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. Right. So I need to find the mole fractions in the liquid first, then calculate the vapor pressures.

The problem gives me the answer choices, and I need to pick the correct one. So let me think about what Raoult's law tells us.

Raoult's law formula is: 

P_B = x_B * P_B^0

P_P = x_P * P_P^0

But wait, the problem states that it's a mixture of benzene and isopentane. So I need their pure vapor pressures. I remember that benzene has a much higher boiling point, so it's more volatile. Isopentane is probably a less volatile component.

Wait, I think the pure vapor pressures at the given temperature (110°F) are needed. So I need to look up the vapor pressures of benzene and isopentane at 110°F. Alternatively, is that at standard conditions, or at 110°F? Hmm, probably at 110°F because that's the temperature given.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact values, but I'll proceed with the assumption that I can find them. Let me think, benzene's vapor pressure at 110°F is about 85.7 mmHg or something like that. Isopentane's vapor pressure might be higher than benzene, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe higher than benzene, but I'll need to check.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the mole fractions. Let me denote the composition as xB and xP, with xB + xP = 1.

But wait, I'm not given any volume or other data. Oh wait, the problem just gives the pressures and temperature, and asks to use Raoult's law. So perhaps I can find the mole fractions assuming ideal behavior, which is what Raoult's law assumes.

Wait, but Raoult's law is for ideal solutions. If the solution is ideal, then the partial pressures are given by x_i P_i^0, where P_i^0 is the pure component pressure.

Wait, but the problem is about mixing, so maybe it's an ideal solution and we can model it with Raoult's law. So the first step is to find xB and xP.

But wait, the problem doesn't provide any data about the pressures or the amounts. Wait, wait, the problem says the mixture is at 1.5 atm. So perhaps at 110°F, each component's vapor pressure is known; then, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures. 

Let me think: T is 110°F, so P_total = P_B + P_P = 1.5 atm.

So, P_B = xB * P_B^0

P_P = xP * P_P^0

And xB + xP = 1.

So, 1.5 atm = xB * P_B^0 + xP * P_P^0

But without knowing the individual P_B^0 and P_P^0, I can't proceed numerically. Wait, but maybe I can find the ratio of the mole fractions using Raoult's law.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mole fractions of the liquid are determined based on the partial pressures. But without knowing their pure vapor pressures, I can't compute the exact mole fractions. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is considering the ideal solution and assuming that the mole fractions in the vapor are given by the mole fractions in the liquid multiplied by their respective vapor pressures. But without knowing the vapor pressures, I can't directly find the mole fractions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the ideal solution assumption and using the given pressures to find the mole fractions. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the fact that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures, and the mole fractions are determined by their respective contributions.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I don't know where to proceed numerically. This seems tricky. Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the given pressures and the mole fractions from the given options to compute the pure vapor pressures. But that would be the reverse approach.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, the problem says the mixture is at 1.5 atm. So perhaps the total vapor pressure is 1.5 atm. But that would only be the case if the solution is azeotropic, but that's not indicated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is at 110°F and the total pressure is 1.5 atm, and we need to compute the mole fractions in the liquid. Then, using Raoult's law, compute the partial pressures, and then find the mole fractions in the vapor.

Wait, this might be the way to go. So let's outline the steps.

1. Let xB and xP be the mole fractions in the liquid.

2. Then, the total pressure P_total = P_B + P_P = 1.5 atm.

3. P_B = xB * P_B^0

   P_P = xP * P_P^0

   But P_total = P_B + P_P = xB P_B^0 + xP P_P^0 = 1.5 atm

   Also, since xB + xP = 1, xP = 1 - xB.

4. Now, with two equations and two variables (xB and xB^0), but wait, I don't know P_B^0 and P_P^0. So this approach seems stuck unless I can relate the mole fractions somehow.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the liquid is the same as the vapor, meaning xB = yB, xP = yP. But that would imply that the solution is ideal and the vapor is the same as the liquid, which would require that the solution is a non-ideal solution. But that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the given pressure and mole fractions to compute the pure vapor pressures. But that's not possible without more information.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick and the correct answer is none of these, but that's not the case here. Let me look at the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is ideal and so the mole fractions are determined by the ratio of their partial pressures. But without knowing the pure pressures, I can't compute mole fractions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the composition of the vapor. The vapor should have a composition based on the mole fractions in the liquid multiplied by their respective pure vapor pressures.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for an ideal solution, the mole fraction of each component in the vapor is equal to its mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by their respective pure vapor pressures. Wait, no, that's not correct. The mole fraction in the vapor is calculated using the partial pressures.

Wait, no. The mole fraction in the vapor y_i is equal to P_i / P_total.

So y_i = (x_i * P_i^0) / P_total.

So, if I can find y_i, I can compute x_i from y_i, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the equations as follows.

Let xB be the mole fraction of benzene in the liquid. Then xP = 1 - xB.

The partial pressure of benzene is xB * P_B^0.

Similarly, P_P = xP * P_P^0.

The total pressure is 1.5 atm, so:

xB * P_B^0 + xP * P_P^0 = 1.5 atm.

But without knowing P_B^0 and P_P^0, I can't solve numerically. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to realize that the mole fractions are determined by the ratio of their partial pressures, but without knowing the pure pressures, perhaps the problem is expecting a ratio approach, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem states that the mixture is at 1.5 atm and 110°F. I need to find the liquid and vapor compositions using Raoult's law.

Wait, maybe I can find the mole fractions in the vapor based on the given pressures. Let me think.

The vapor pressures of benzene and isopentane at 110°F are given. Let me say, for example, P_B^0 is 85.7 mmHg and P_P^0 is 150 mmHg (just guessing numbers for this example). Wait, but in reality, I should get the exact values, but because I don't have them, I can't proceed numerically. So perhaps this approach is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the vapor composition is determined by the mole fractions in the liquid multiplied by their respective pure vapor pressures, but again, without knowing the pure pressures, I can't compute xB and xP.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the fact that the liquid and vapor have the same composition if it's an ideal solution under certain conditions. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the options provided.

Looking at the options, all of them have xB and xP totaling 1. So for each option, xB plus xP equals 1.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that each option provides the correct y_i, and then compute x_i using Raoult's law. Let's try that.

For example, take option A: xB=0.15, xP=0.85.

Compute y_B = 0.10, y_P=0.85.

But wait, using Raoult's law, y_B = P_B / P_total, which is (0.15 * P_B^0) / 1.5.

Similarly, y_P = (0.85 * P_P^0) / 1.5.

But if I can compute P_B^0 and P_P^0, perhaps I can check.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that the pure vapor pressures of benzene and isopentane at 110°F are different, and the mole fractions in the vapor are determined by these.

But without the exact values, it's difficult.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the liquid, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, perhaps the mole fractions are determined by the ratio of the given pressures.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a clear path here.

Wait, perhaps I should pick an option where the mole fractions in the vapor are consistent with the given pressures.

Let me think of option B: xB=0.10, xP=0.90.

So y_B = (0.10 * P_B^0) / 1.5, and y_P= (0.90 * P_P^0) / 1.5.

If I can imagine that P_B^0 is higher than P_P^0, then the vapor would have more benzene, which would make sense if benzene is more volatile.

Wait, but without knowing the actual pure vapor pressures, this approach is stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the vapor, but I don't have the pure vapor pressures.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of another approach. Suppose that the solution is such that the vapor is richer in the more volatile component. Benzene is more volatile, so the vapor should have more benzene. So in the vapor, y_B should be higher than y_P.

Looking at the options:

Option A: y_B=0.25 < 0.75 → benzene less in vapor → unlikely.

Option B: y_B=0.15 < 0.85 → unlikely.

Option C: y_B=0.10 < 0.90 → unlikely.

Option D: y_B=0.02 < 0.98 → unlikely.

Option E: y_B=0.20 < 0.80 → unlikely.

Option F: y_B=0.60 < 0.40 → unlikely.

Option G: y_B=0.30 < 0.70 → unlikely.

Option H: y_B=0.05 < 0.95 → unlikely.

Option I: y_B=0.02 < 0.98 → unlikely.

Wait, all options have y_B less than their corresponding x. That can't be right. Because benzene is more volatile, in the vapor, y_B should be higher than x_B, which is the same as y_P should be higher than x_P. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between liquid and vapor. Let me clarify: in the liquid, the mole fractions are xB and xP. In the vapor, the mole fraction of each component is yB and yP. Raoult's law gives yB = xB * P_B^0 / P_total, and similarly for yP.

So benzene is more volatile, so its y in the vapor should be higher than x in the liquid. So, for example, if xB is 0.2, then yB should be higher than 0.2.

Now looking at the options:

Option B: yB=0.15, xB=0.10 → 0.15 >0.10 → possible.

Option G: yB=0.30, xB=0.30 → same → possible.

Option I: yB=0.02 < xB=0.05 → Not possible.

Option D: yB=0.02 < xB=0.05 → No.

Option C: yB=0.10 < xB=0.20 → No.

Option F: yB=0.60 > xB=0.05 → possible.

Option A: yB=0.25> xB=0.15 → possible.

So options A, B, F, G have higher y than x, which is correct.

But wait, what about the total pressure? Let's take option A: xB=0.15, xP=0.85.

Compute P_total = xB * P_B^0 + xP * P_P^0.

But without knowing P_B^0 and P_P^0, I can't compute this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the mole fractions in the vapor using the given pressures and then see which option fits.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for the vapor, the mole fraction of benzene is:

yB = (xB * P_B^0) / P_total.

Similarly, yP = (xP * P_P^0) / P_total.

So, for each option, I can compute yB and yP, then see whether they match what the pure vapor pressures would give.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, perhaps I can't proceed numerically. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to assume that the liquid and vapor have the same composition, which would only happen if the solution is ideal and the vapor is the same as the liquid. But that would require that the solution is not mixing, which it is.

Wait, but I don't have the pure pressures, so I can't compute this.

At this point, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Perhaps the problem is using the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the vapor, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, this approach doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I can approach the problem using the ideal solution assumption and the given pressures in the vapor. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can express yB and yP in terms of xB and xP.

yB = (xB * P_B^0) / 1.5 atm.

Similarly, yP = (xP * P_P^0) / 1.5 atm.

But since xP = 1 - xB, I can write:

yB = (xB * P_B^0) / 1.5

yP = ( (1 - xB) * P_P^0 ) / 1.5

Since yB + yP = 1 (the total pressure is 1 atm, but wait, 1.5 atm is the total pressure).

Wait, no: in the problem, the total pressure is 1.5 atm, so yB + yP = 1.5 atm.

Wait, but if I have yB = (xB * P_B^0) / 1.5 and yP = ((1 - xB) * P_P^0) / 1.5, then:

yB + yP = [ xB P_B^0 + (1 - xB) P_P^0 ] / 1.5 = 1.5 atm.

Wait, that would imply:

[ xB P_B^0 + (1 - xB) P_P^0 ] = (1.5 atm) * 1.5 atm → which is 2.25 atm^2. But that's impossible because pressure can't be squared.

Wait, wait, no. The equation is:

[ xB P_B^0 + (1 - xB) P_P^0 ] / 1.5 atm = 1.5 atm.

So,

xB P_B^0 + (1 - xB) P_P^0 = (1.5 atm) * 1.5 atm = 2.25 atm².

So this equation must hold.

Hmm, but without knowing P_B^0 and P_P^0, I can't proceed numerically.

Wait, perhaps I can express this equation in terms of the mole fractions.

Let me denote xB as x, then xP = 1 - x.

Equation becomes:

x * P_B^0 + (1 - x) * P_P^0 = 2.25 atm².

Hmm, but again, without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute x.

Wait, perhaps the problem is giving the mole fractions of the vapor, and I need to find the liquid.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I can't compute the pure vapor pressures.

Another approach: perhaps the question is testing the concept that in the vapor, the mole fractions are determined by the mole fractions in the liquid multiplied by their respective pure vapor pressures divided by the total pressure.

But without the pure vapor pressures, it's impossible to find the mole fractions in the vapor.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Maybe the given pressures are the partial pressures of the liquid, but that's not possible because Raoult's law applies to the partial pressures of the liquid.

Wait, no. Raoult's law is about the partial pressure of the liquid, so the given P_total is the sum of the partial pressures of the liquid.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem as being in an ideal solution, and using the given pressures to find the mole fractions.

Wait, but I'm stuck because without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute the mole fractions.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of the mole fractions in the vapor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the liquid, and then applying Raoult's law to find the vapor.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute the mole fractions in the liquid.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is using Raoult's law and the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the vapor. But without the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute the mole fractions in the liquid.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the correct answer is that the vapor has a composition that's determined by the liquid's mole fractions and their respective pure vapor pressures, which I can't compute numerically.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not one of the choices.

Wait, but all the options must have correct mole fractions, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me try option B: xB=0.10, xP=0.90.

Compute yB = (0.10 * P_B^0) / 1.5, yP = (0.90 * P_P^0) / 1.5.

But if I can assume that the sum of yB and yP equals 1.5 atm, then:

(0.10 * P_B^0 + 0.90 * P_P^0 ) / 1.5 = 1.5 atm.

So,

0.10 * P_B^0 + 0.90 * P_P^0 = (1.5 atm) * 1.5 atm = 2.25 atm².

But without knowing P_B^0 and P_P^0, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pure vapor pressures are given as 85.7 mmHg and 150 mmHg, respectively. Then, let's compute.

So,

yB = (0.10 * 85.7) / 1.5 = (8.57) / 1.5 ≈ 5.71 mmHg.

Wait, but that can't be right because the pressure is in atm, not mmHg.

Wait, I'm getting confused with units here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the given pressures are in atm, as per the problem statement. So 1.5 atm is the total pressure.

So, the partial pressures of benzene and isopentane are in atm.

So, using the given pressures in atm, let's compute the mole fractions in the vapor.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute the mole fractions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the vapor, but without the pure vapor pressures, I can't.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the mole fractions in the liquid, then use Raoult's law to find the vapor.

Wait, but again, without the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute the mole fractions in the liquid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick and the correct answer is none of the options. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the given pressures are the partial pressures. But no, the problem says "atmospheres" for the given pressures. So the total pressure is 1.5 atm, and the partial pressures are in atm.

Therefore, the problem is to find the mole fractions in the vapor using Raoult's law, given the partial pressures and the mole fractions in the liquid.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute the mole fractions in the vapor.

But wait, the problem gives the partial pressures, which are the same as Raoult's law.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is that the vapor has the same composition as the liquid because they're ideal solutions. But that's not possible because benzene is more volatile.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't determine which way the composition shifts.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the vapor, but without the pure vapor pressures, I can't. So perhaps the correct answer is that the vapor has a composition that's determined by the liquid's mole fractions and their respective pure vapor pressures, which I can't compute numerically.

Wait, but then the answer would be that the correct option is none of the above, but the problem states that the options are from A to I. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the vapor is richer in the more volatile component than the liquid, so the mole fractions in the vapor should be higher than those in the liquid. So any option where yB is higher than xB would be correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: xB=0.15, yB=0.25 → yB> xB → possible.

Option B: xB=0.10, yB=0.15 → yB < xB → unlikely.

Option C: xB=0.20, yB=0.10 → yB < xB → unlikely.

Option D: xB=0.05, yB=0.02 → yB < xB → unlikely.

Option E: xB=0.05, yB=0.20 → yB> xB → possible.

Option F: xB=0.09, yB=0.60 → yB> xB → possible.

Option G: xB=0.30, yB=0.70 → yB> xB → possible.

Option H: xB=0.04, yB=0.06 → yB> xB → possible.

Option I: xB=0.02, yB=0.80 → yB> xB → possible.

Wait, so options A, E, F, G, H, I have yB> xB → possible.

But the correct answer depends on which option's yB and yP are consistent with their respective pure vapor pressures.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pure vapor pressures are given as 85.7 mmHg and 150 mmHg, respectively, which I can convert to atm.

Wait, 1 atm = 760 mmHg.

So, 85.7 mmHg = 85.7 / 760 atm ≈ 0.113 atm.

Similarly, 150 mmHg = 150 / 760 atm ≈ 0.197 atm.

Now, using these pure vapor pressures, let's compute the mole fractions in the vapor for each option.

Option A: xB=0.15, xP=0.85.

Compute yB = (0.15 * 0.113) / 1.5 = (0.01695) / 1.5 ≈ 0.0113.

Wait, but this can't be right because 0.0113 is much less than the given yB=0.25 in option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me re-calculate.

85.7 mmHg is approximately 0.113 atm (since 85.7 / 760 = 0.113).

150 mmHg is approximately 0.197 atm.

Now, let's compute yB for option A:

yB = (0.15 * 0.113) / 1.5 = (0.01695) / 1.5 ≈ 0.0113.

But option A says yB=0.25. So this is way off. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: xB=0.10, xP=0.90.

Compute yB = (0.10 * 0.113) / 1.5 = (0.0113) / 1.5 ≈ 0.0075.

But option B says yB=0.15, so way off.

Option C: xB=0.20, xP=0.80.

yB = (0.20 * 0.113) / 1.5 = (0.0226) / 1.5 ≈ 0.015.

But option C says yB=0.10 → off by a factor of about 6.67.

Option D: xB=0.05, xP=0.95.

yB = (0.05 * 0.113) /1.5 = (0.00565) /1.5≈ 0.00376.

But option D says yB=0.02 → off by factor of ~8.4.

Option E: xB=0.05, xP=0.95.

Wait, same as D.

Option F: xB=0.09, xP=0.91.

yB = (0.09 * 0.113) / 1.5 = 0.01017 /1.5 ≈ 0.00678.

But option F says yB=0.6 → off by factor of ~92.

Option G: xB=0.30, xP=0.70.

yB = (0.30 * 0.113) /1.5 = (0.0339) /1.5 ≈ 0.0226.

But option G says yB=0.70 → off by factor of ~30.

Option H: xB=0.04, xP=0.96.

yB = (0.04 * 0.113) /1.5 = 0.00452 /1.5 ≈ 0.00301.

But option H says yB=0.06 → off by 20.

Option I: xB=0.02, xP=0.98.

yB = (0.02 * 0.113) /1.5 = 0.00226 /1.5≈ 0.0015.

But option I says yB=0.80 → off by 53.

Hmm, none of these options have yB higher than xB except option A and E, but they don't. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, 85.7 mmHg is 85.7 / 760 atm → 85.7 / 760 ≈ 0.113 atm.

So, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the vapor, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, it's impossible to compute. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to assume that the pure vapor pressures are equal to the given pressures, but that's not correct as pure vapor pressures are independent of the given pressures.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the options are correct, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to assume that the pure vapor pressures are such that the mole fractions in the vapor are higher than the liquid, which would make all the options except A and E correct.

Wait, but the problem is multiple choice, so I must choose an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try option E again.

Option E: xB=0.05, xP=0.95.

Compute yB = (0.05 * 0.113) /1.5 = (0.00565) /1.5 ≈ 0.00377.

But option E says yB=0.20 → off by about 56.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the given pressures as the partial pressures in the vapor, but that's not possible because Raoult's law gives the partial pressures based on the liquid mole fractions and the pure vapor pressures.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is a trick and the correct answer is that the vapor has the same composition as the liquid, which is not true because benzene is more volatile.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't compute that.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I might have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at option B: yB=0.15, which is higher than xB=0.10. That's possible.

Alternatively, option G: yB=0.70, xB=0.30 → possible.

But without more information, I can't choose between them.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the given pressures to find the mole fractions in the vapor by assuming that the liquid is 50% each. But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the correct answer is that the vapor has a composition that's determined by the liquid's mole fractions and their respective pure vapor pressures, which I can't compute numerically. Therefore, the correct option is not given, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with another approach, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is using the given pressures as the partial pressures in the vapor, but that's not possible. Because Raoult's law gives the partial pressures based on the liquid mole fractions and the pure vapor pressures.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck and need to move on.

The problem involves determining the mole fractions of benzene and isopentane in the liquid and vapor phases using Raoult's law. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Understanding Raoult's Law**: Raoult's law states that the partial pressure of each component in the liquid phase is proportional to its mole fraction and its pure component's vapor pressure. The formula is:
   \[
   P_i = x_i P_i^0
   \]
   where \( P_i \) is the partial pressure, \( x_i \) is the mole fraction in the liquid, and \( P_i^0 \) is the pure component's vapor pressure.

2. **Given Data**: The total pressure in the vapor phase is 1.5 atm. The problem provides the partial pressures in the vapor phase, but without knowing the pure component vapor pressures, it's impossible to calculate the mole fractions in the liquid and vapor phases.

3. **Pure Component Vapor Pressures**: Since the pure component vapor pressures are not provided, we cannot proceed further with the calculations. Without these values, we cannot determine the mole fractions in the liquid and vapor phases.

4. **Conclusion**: The problem cannot be solved definitively because the necessary information (pure component vapor pressures) is missing. Therefore, none of the provided options (A to I) are correct.

ANSWER: None of the options are correct.
