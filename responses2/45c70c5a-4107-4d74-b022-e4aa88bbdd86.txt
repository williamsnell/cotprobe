Okay, so I have this biology question to answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is asking about chemical substances released by organisms that can elicit a response in other members of the same species. The options are A to I, each representing a different type of chemical or biological molecule.

Hmm, I remember that when organisms interact, they can release signaling molecules. These molecules can influence the behavior or physiology of others. So, what do these molecules do? I think they act as signals.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: auxins. I'm not sure. I think auxins are involved in plant signaling, maybe in growth or development. They are plant hormones, but wait, the question is about a response in the same species. So I don't think auxins are the answer here.

Option B: neurotransmitters. neurotransmitters are chemicals released by the nervous system that influence behavior. Like how when you take a drug, your brain releases neurotransmitters which affect mood or reaction. But this is about an organism releasing substances that affect others. So maybe not.

Option C: enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze reactions. They are made within the cell and are essential for biochemical processes. They don't really release substances in the sense of signaling; they just modify reactants. So probably not the answer.

Option D: hormones. Wait, hormones are similar to neurotransmitters in that they are endocrine. They regulate a wide range of bodily functions. For example, insulin and glucagon are hormones. But wait, do they elicit responses in other species? The question specifies same species. So I think that's not it.

Option E: pheromones. I remember that pheromones are a type of chemical released by one organism to influence another. They are often used in social behaviors, like mating or attracting mates. Like how ants leave pheromones to find mates. So pheromones do cause responses in other members of the same species.

Option F: cytokines. Cytokines are another type of signaling molecule. They are produced by T-cells and help in immune responses. They can influence development, growth, and other cellular processes. But again, do they elicit responses in same species? I think they might, but I'm not as sure about pheromones.

Wait, the question is about substances that elicit responses in the same species. So pheromones and cytokines are both types of signaling molecules. But which one is correct?

Hmm. Let me think about their roles. Pheromones are well-known in social insects like ants. They might also be used in other contexts, like in plants for communication. Cytokines are involved in immune responses and cell proliferation.

Wait, I'm trying to remember if pheromones are classified as signaling molecules. I think they are, but I'm not certain. Maybe they are more associated with ants and other social insects. So pheromones would fit as the answer.

Alternatively, cytokines are definitely signaling molecules, but I'm not sure if the term applies as directly to pheromones. Or wait, pheromone signaling is a major area of study, so I think option E would be the correct answer.

Wait, looking at the options again. The question is about substances that elicit a response in the same species. So the answer is about signaling molecules.

Pheromones are a type of signaling molecule. So the correct answer should be E: pheromones.

Another way to think: are pheromones a type of hormone? No, they're a different category, but they are still signaling molecules.

So the options are A-F, but the correct choice is E.

The question asks about chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a response in other members of the same species. These substances are signaling molecules. Among the options, pheromones (E) are a well-known type of signaling molecule, often used in social behaviors like insect communication. They are classified as signaling molecules and fit the description of elicit responses in the same species. 

ANSWER: E
