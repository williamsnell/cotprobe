Question:

Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the cereal box was not in plain sight during the search.
B: denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.
C: granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.
D: granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.
E: denied, because the landlord gave the police permission to enter the apartment.
F: granted, because the police had no proof of the husband's involvement at the time of the search.
G: denied, because the fingerprint evidence was crucial to the investigation.
H: granted, because the police did not have the husband's consent to search his apartment.
I: denied, because the husband was not present during the search of his apartment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is about a police department receiving a call at an evening. A woman reported loud shrieks and screams nearby. The police came in, found a homeowner who was killed, and found a blood-stained baseball bat. They questioned friends and relatives, concluded the husband was a suspect, and then two detectives went to the husband's apartment. The landlord let them in, but they found nothing inside. They searched the apartment, took cereal box prints, and they used those for a fingerprint comparison with the bat. The husband is subpoenaed without being present, and he files a motion to suppress evidence. We need to decide whether the motion is granted or denied, with the options given.

So the question is about the legality of the search and whether the evidence is admissible for the grand jury. I remember that grand juries have different rules than regular court searches.

First, the police did a warrantless search at the husband's apartment. I think that's a key point. I recall that a warrantless search is only allowed if it's for a purpose exceeding what a warrant allows. But in this case, it's a home search. I think in the US, even if it's a home search, if it's for something like a murder, it's considered a warrantless search and might be illegal, but only if it's not necessary for a reasonable public purpose.

Wait, but the husband was the one suspected. So the police had no immediate reason to search him, just because they found a bloodstain. So I'm not sure if that's a good reason. But what about the facts here? The police found the bat and the husband was suspected. So the immediate need is the murder, but the primary intent is the probable cause for the crime. So maybe that's enough to warrant a search. But wait, no—because the home was the primary purpose, so if it's a home, even a warrantless search for a murder is illegal. But wait, the home is the place where the disturbance happened, and the home was the primary purpose. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the home was the place where the disturbance occurred. So the immediate need for the home search is for the disturbance, which is a crime. But is that enough? Well, the home is part of the jurisdiction, so a search there would be necessary for the immediate purpose, which is the disturbance. But in some cases, the home search is required for the immediate purpose, regardless of the crime, unless it's for a specific reason like a public health emergency, which isn't the case here. So maybe the police can justify a warrantless search of the home for the immediate disturbance.

Wait, but the actual problem is that the husband is the suspect. So the immediate need is to find out whether the husband is the suspect. The home was the place of disturbance, so a search there would likely be necessary to check for the suspect. So the home search is necessary for the immediate purpose.

But wait, the next point is about the county's policy on grand juries. I remember that grand juries have a limitation on the types of evidence they can accept. Specifically, I think they can't accept evidence that's evidence of a hearsay or anything that's not admissible through a hearsay exception or requires consent. But the evidence in this case is a fingerprint comparison. Wait, but fingerprint evidence is a hearsay. So the grand jury would have to have an exception for that.

Alternatively, the grand jury's admissibility is subject to the grand jury rules. I recall that the grand jury is not supposed to accept evidence that was obtained through a search of someone else's apartment, unless the circumstances are clear. But if the police used a search and got a crime charge, the grand jury can't consider that evidence. But in this case, the police did a search of the husband's apartment and obtained evidence (the cereal box prints) for a fingerprint comparison. But the home search was already done by the police, not the grand jury.

Wait, the husband is being questioned by the grand jury, not the police. So the grand jury hears the initial evidence, and then hears the evidence from the search. So the initial evidence was the baseball bat. The new evidence is the cereal box prints. But the grand jury's admissibility is about whether the new evidence is admissible, not whether the prior evidence was. Plus, the grand jury requires a clear exception for the evidence obtained through a search. But in this case, the evidence was obtained through a search of the husband's apartment, which is a different situation than a home search.

Wait, but the home is a separate issue. The grand jury hears the initial evidence, then the new evidence. The prior evidence (the bat) was not obtained through a search, so the grand jury has no problem with it. But the new evidence is from the search. So the question is whether the new evidence (the cereal box prints) is admissible because it's from someone else's apartment.

I remember that the grand jury cannot accept evidence that was obtained through a search of someone else's apartment unless it's in the grand jury's interest. But I think the grand jury's immediate purpose is to hear evidence they already have, not to hear evidence obtained through a search. So if the evidence was obtained through a search, the grand jury can't accept it. Wait, but the initial evidence was from the home, so the grand jury could have access to that. But the new evidence is from the husband's apartment, so the initial evidence was already there.

Wait, no. The initial evidence is from the home—so when the grand jury hears it, they don't need to consider the new evidence unless the new evidence violates the grand jury rules. But the new evidence is from the husband's apartment. So the problem is whether the evidence from the husband's apartment search is admissible to the grand jury.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the process. The grand jury hears the initial evidence (the bat) and then hears the new evidence (the cereal box). But the new evidence is obtained through a search of the husband's apartment, which isn't a grand jury hearing. So the initial evidence was from the home, and the grand jury can't use it to accept new evidence. So the question is whether the new evidence is admissible to the grand jury. But the new evidence was obtained through a search, which is a private matter, so the grand jury can't accept it.

Alternatively, the grand jury is only supposed to accept evidence that was obtained legally, without a search. So if the evidence was obtained through a search, it's not admissible to the grand jury. So the evidence from the husband's apartment search is not admissible to the grand jury. Therefore, the grand jury can't use the cereal box prints.

Wait, but the police had a warrantless search, so the initial evidence was from the home. The home search was done by the police, not the grand jury. So the initial evidence is from the home, and the new evidence is from a different place. The grand jury hears the home evidence, then hears the new evidence.

But the new evidence is from the husband's apartment, so the initial evidence was from the home, and the grand jury can't use that new evidence because it's from someone else's apartment, which is a different matter. So the new evidence is not admissible to the grand jury.

Wait, but another angle: the grand jury can't accept evidence from a search unless it's for a purpose that's necessary for the grand jury to consider. But the purpose here is to get the fingerprints. So the new evidence is not admissible.

So if the evidence is not admissible, then the grand jury cannot use it, so the police shouldn't be able to provide the evidence to the grand jury. Thus, the husband's motion to suppress evidence is granted because the evidence is illegally obtained.

Wait, but I thought that the grand jury can't accept evidence obtained through a search of someone else's apartment unless it's in their interest. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the grand jury can't accept evidence from a private search. So the evidence obtained through a search of someone else's apartment is not admissible to the grand jury.

Wait, but in some cases, the grand jury can accept evidence if it's from a private search, but I think the grand jury admissibility requires that the evidence is obtained legally and without a search. So if the evidence was obtained through a search, it's not admissible. So in this case, the new evidence is obtained through the husband's apartment search, which is a private matter, so the evidence cannot be admitted to the grand jury.

Therefore, the police can't provide the evidence to the grand jury. So the motion should be granted (option A). Because the evidence was obtained through a search, which is a private matter, and the grand jury cannot accept evidence from a private search, even if it's for a murder.

Alternatively, perhaps the grand jury can't accept evidence from a home search for a murder, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the home search was necessary for the disturbance, which is a crime, but home searches are allowed for crimes that are immediately necessary, like disturbing the peace. So the initial evidence is from a home search for a crime, so it's allowed. But the new evidence is from a separate search. So the new evidence is from a different place, so it's not a search for a crime, so it's not allowed to the grand jury.

So the grand jury hears the home evidence, and then hears the new evidence. But the new evidence is not admissible, so the only way is to have it suppressed. So the husband's motion should be granted because the evidence was illegally obtained.

Another angle: The police had a warrantless search of the husband's apartment. But the home was the place of disturbance. So the home search is necessary, but the grand jury can't accept evidence from a search of another person's home. So the evidence of the cereal box is from a different place, so it's not admissible to the grand jury. Therefore, the evidence is not admissible, so the motion is granted.

So the correct answer is A: granted, because the cereal box was not in plain sight during the search.
</think>

The police received a call at an evening, reporting loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. They discovered a homeowner bludgeoned to death, with a blood-stained baseball bat found nearby. A subsequent investigation revealed the homeowner was the husband in question. The police conducted a warrantless search of the husband's apartment, which resulted in the suppression of evidence. The husband is later subpoenaed, and his motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison is being considered.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Warrantless Search for the Husband**: The police performed a search of the husband's apartment, but the primary reason for the search was to locate the suspect, not to conduct a home search for a crime. This is problematic because the immediate purpose of the search was to locate the suspect, not to disturb the home. A warrantless home search is generally illegal under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) because it exceeds the public purpose of the home (to prevent a crime). Therefore, the search was deemed unnecessary and illegal, making the evidence legally insufficient.

2. **Grand Jury Admissibility**: The grand jury is not allowed to accept evidence obtained through a search of someone else's home. The evidence of the cereal box prints, obtained through the husband's apartment search, is not admissible to the grand jury because it was obtained for a private matter (searching the husband's home) and not for a crime requiring the grand jury's attention.

3. **Factual Comparison**: The police used the cereal box prints to match the blood-stained bat. This comparison is a hearsay and not admissible under the grand jury's rules because it was obtained through a private search.

### Conclusion:
The evidence of the cereal box prints is not admissible to the grand jury because it was obtained through a search of the husband's apartment, a private matter. Therefore, the police cannot provide the evidence to the grand jury, and the husband's motion should be granted.
