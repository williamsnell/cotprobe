This question refers to the following information.
"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal."
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which historical event inspired the instructions given in the fifth paragraph of Mahatma Gandhi's message. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The fifth paragraph of Gandhi's message is about non-violent resistance, Swaraj, and the Swadeshi program. He mentions not taking foreign cloth and spinning weaves, which are symbolic. These actions reflect a commitment to non-violence and promoting Indian unity.

Now, the options are from 1450–1750 C.E. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Black Death in Europe. That's a global pandemic, but I don't think it directly relates to non-violence or resistance.

Option B: Columbus discovering the New World. That's about exploration, which might be more about discovery than resistance or non-violence.

Option C: Conquering India with rival Muslims. This ties directly to Gandhi's own actions, as he was frommalled in Waltair, India. But the question is about historical developments that inspired his message, not his own actions.

Option D: Absolute monarchies in Europe. While monarchies can influence political structures, I'm not sure if that's directly related to non-violence or resistance.

Option E: Printing press invention. The printing press was a revolutionary tool but not directly about resistance or non-violence.

Option F: Scientific Revolution. This was a broader movement, but it didn't directly inspire resistance specifically. It's more about scientific advancements and the spread of knowledge.

Option G: Importing food from the New World. This relates to global trade and perhaps some forms of resistance, but I'm not certain about the link.

Option H: Protestant Reformation. The Reformation led to more freedom and change, but I don't know if that's directly tied to non-violence.

Option I: African slave trade. This is more about oppression and resistance, but Gandhi was against it, so maybe this could be a hint, but I'm not certain.

Option J: Joint-stock companies. This is a business development, not related to resistance or non-violence.

Wait, the key point is that Gandhi's message emphasizes non-violence and resistance. The actions he's promoting—playing a role in social movements and resisting violence—probably stem from historical events that encourage such behavior. But the options don't directly ask for the actions he took. The question is which historical development he was inspired by.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The message mentions not taking foreign cloth, which is a form of non-violence, and it's about uniting non-violent elements. These actions are more about resistance and non-violence than traditional resistance movements. The events in the options that represent a movement or resistance could be the answer.

Looking back, the message is about non-violent resistance, which is a form of resistance. The events that inspire such movements often involve resistance against oppression, like the Indian independence movement.

The options that represent resistance movements are perhaps the ones that fit. But the options are about historical developments. The events that inspired the message are more about social movements and resistance, which relate to global movements rather than specific events. However, the message is about non-violence, which is a form of resistance.

Wait, perhaps the answer is about freedom movements. For example, the Indian independence movement, which was a form of non-violence and resistance. But the options don't directly point to that.

Looking again, the message mentions not taking foreign cloth, which is about resistance. The underlying motivation is to resist violence and gain independence. The most inspiring historical development would be that which reflects a desire to resist oppression and achieve social unity. The options that represent such movements are probably the ones that inspire the paragraph.

Wait, but the options don't directly relate to specific movements. The question is, which historical event most inspired the paragraph. The paragraph is about non-violence, which is a form of resistance. The inspiration might come from a broader historical event that encourages such resistance, like the freedom of the people.

Alternatively, perhaps the message is inspired by the idea of non-violence, which is a form of resistance that avoids violence. The historical development that most inspired this is freedom of movement and the desire to resist oppression.

But looking at the options, perhaps the most relevant is the importation of crops from the New World, which was a form of resistance against British rule. That's G. Importing food crops from the New World. So, G would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The paragraph is about non-violence, which is a form of resistance. The most inspiring historical development would be one that encourages people to resist, which could be the story of India's liberation under Mahatma Gandhi, which was a form of non-violence.

But the options don't directly ask for that. The options are about historical developments. So the answer is likely G: The importation of food crops from the New World. Because that's about resistance against colonial rule, which was a form of non-violence.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the paragraph mentions "non-violent resistance" and "resolving the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs". That's about uniting non-violent people. The inspiration would come from a historical context where resistance was encouraged, perhaps freedom movements or the push for independence.

Looking at the options, the one that represents a movement that encourages non-violence and resistance is likely the importation of food crops (G), as it's part of a broader resistance against colonial rule. Alternatively, perhaps the message is inspired by the freedom of the people's movements, but the options don't directly align.

Wait, another thought: the message is about non-violence and non-violent resistance, which relates to the freedom of non-violent acts. So perhaps the most inspiring historical development is the freedom of movement and the desire to resist oppression, which ties into freedom of thought and action, perhaps the Indian independence movement.

But among the options, the best fit is G: The importation of food crops from the New World, because it's a form of resistance against colonial rule, which was a form of non-violence.

Therefore, the answer is G.

The historical development most inspired the instructions in the fifth paragraph of Mahatma Gandhi's message is the importation of food crops from the New World. This event reflects a form of resistance against colonial rule and aligns with Gandhi's emphasis on non-violence and uniting non-violent elements. Among the options provided, this is the most fitting answer as it represents a broader historical development that encourages resistance and non-violence.

Answer: G
