Okay, so I've got this question about the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface at perihelion and aphelion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the ratio of the solar radiation flux. So, which one is bigger, the flux at 0.304 AU or 0.456 AU? I remember that radiation flux isn't just about the distance; the brightness probably depends on the inverse square law. Like, the flux decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun. So F = L/(4πd²), where L is the Sun's luminosity.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question is asking about the incident flux or the absorbed flux. Oh wait, the question says "solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface." So, that would be the incident flux, right? Because the absorbed flux would depend on Mercury's albedo, which isn't provided here. So I think it's the incident flux that's being considered here.

So, the flux at perihelion (0.304 AU) will be F_p = L/(4π (0.304)^2) ), and at aphelion, F_a = L/(4π (0.456)^2 ). When you take the ratio F_p / F_a, the L and 4π terms cancel out. So the ratio becomes (1/(0.304)^2) / (1/(0.456)^2 ) = (0.456/0.304)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Because (1/a²) divided by (1/b²) is (b²/a²), so (0.456/0.304)^2. Let me compute that.

First, 0.456 divided by 0.304. Let me calculate that. 0.456 / 0.304. Let me see, 0.304 times 1.5 is 0.456. Oh! Because 0.3*1.5 is 0.45, and 0.004 *1.5 is 0.006. So 0.304 * 1.5 = 0.456. So 0.456/0.304 is 1.5.

Then, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the ratio F_p to F_a is 2.25:1. But 2.25 is 9/4. So the ratio is 9:4.

Looking at the options, option C is 9:4. So the answer should be option C.

The question asks for the ratio of the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface at perihelion (0.304 AU) versus aphelion (0.456 AU). The flux depends on the inverse square of the distance, following the formula \( F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \). Since the Sun's luminosity \( L \) and the constant \( 4\pi \) cancel out, the ratio simplifies to \( \left(\frac{d_{\text{aphelion}}}{d_{\text{perihelion}}}\right)^2 \).

Calculating the ratio:
\[
\frac{d_{\text{aphelion}}}{d_{\text{perihelion}}} = \frac{0.456}{0.304} \approx 1.5
\]
\[
\left(\frac{0.456}{0.304}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the flux at perihelion to aphelion is \( \frac{9}{4} \), or 9:4. Among the given options, this corresponds to **Option C**.
