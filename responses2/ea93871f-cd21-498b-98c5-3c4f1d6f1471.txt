Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about electrical circuits and their types based on their lowest critical frequency. Let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking about the type of network when the lowest critical frequency is due to zero and may be at the origin or near it. The options are various types of circuits like RL, RC, CL, etc., each corresponding to different combinations of resistor, inductor, and capacitor elements.

First, I need to understand what the lowest critical frequency (LCF) represents. From what I remember, critical frequencies are related to the cutoff frequencies of different circuit types. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the output signal's gain starts to roll off. For example, in an RC circuit, the LCF is determined by the resistor and capacitor values.

Wait, the question says the LCF is due to zero and is near the origin. Hmm. The origin in a circuit context probably refers to the zero in the transfer function. Let's think about the transfer functions of each option.

- RL circuit: Transfer function is R/(R+jωL). The poles are at jωL and zeros are at jωL. Wait, no, no, in RL, the impedance is R + jωL. The transfer function is (R)/(R + jωL) which would have a zero at ω=infinite (since denominator is R+jωL, no finite zero). Wait, no, the numerator is R, so no zeros except at ω=0? No, wait, a transfer function generally is V_out/V_in. For RL, the impedance is R + jωL. So the transfer function is R/(R+jωL). The poles are at jωL (which is at high frequencies), and the zeros are at ω=infinite. So the only zero is at DC (ω=0), which is the origin. So if the LCF is near the origin, the transfer function's zero is at DC.

But wait, the LCF is the frequency where the gain starts to drop. For an RL circuit, the gain is R/(R + jωL). The magnitude is 1/sqrt(1 + (ωL/R)^2). The cutoff frequency (where gain is 1/sqrt(2)) is at ω = R/L. So the LCF is at that point.

But the question states that the LCF is due to zero near the origin. Wait, but if the transfer function has a zero at DC (ω=0), then the circuit's response at DC would have a zero. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, a circuit's transfer function H(jω) can have poles and zeros. The zeros determine the frequency response. So, for an RL circuit, the transfer function is R/(R + jωL). The zeros are at ω=infinite. So the zero is at DC (ω=0). So the transfer function H(0) is R/R = 1. So the zero is at DC. Therefore, the LCF for RL is at DC. So for the problem, if the LCF is due to a zero near DC (origin), which is near the origin in terms of frequency, which circuits have a zero at DC?

Wait, the options given include RL, RC, CL, CR, RLC, etc. Let's list each:

A: RL – Transfer function zeros at infinity. So LCF is at infinity, which is high frequency.

B: RC – Transfer function is 1/(1 + jωRC). So zero at infinity. LCF is high frequency.

C: CL – Transfer function is jωC || 1/(R + jωL) → jωC R - jωL R + j²ω² L C → but wait, more accurately, the transfer function is (1) / (R + jωL + jωC). Wait, no, the correct way is: The impedance is R || (1/(jωL)), and the input impedance is (R jωL) / (R + jωL + jωC). Wait, maybe better to write it as Z_in = (R jωL) / (R + jω(L + C)), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, it's better to consider the transfer function as (jωL || R) / (R + jωL + jωC), but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to know that the transfer function will have a zero at the origin because if you plug ω=0 into the impedance expressions, you get the numerator as 0 if the input is a voltage divider.

Wait, for a RC circuit, the transfer function's numerator is the input resistor R, denominator is R + jωR_c. So the zeros would be at ω=0. So the transfer function's zero is at DC. So the LCF for a RC circuit is at DC.

Similarly, for a CL circuit, which is a series RL and RC in parallel? Wait, maybe not. Wait, let me think. CL circuit is a series-inductor and capacitor in series. So the transfer function would be (jωL) / (R + jω(L + 1/(jωC)) ). Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach each transfer function.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to think about the type of network that has a zero at DC. Because the LCF is the point where the gain starts to drop, which is when the magnitude of the transfer function is lower than the DC gain.

So for each option, the presence of a zero at DC would mean that the gain is zero at DC, which is the origin.

Looking at each option:

A: RL – Transfer function H(jω) = R/(R + jωL). Zeros? At ω=infinite. So no zero at DC. So LCF is high frequency.

B: RC – H(jω) = 1/(R + jωC R). So zeros at ω=infinite. So high frequency.

C: CL – Transfer function is (jωL) / (R + jω(L + 1/(jωC)) ). Let's simplify the denominator: R + jω L + j/(Cω) → R + j(ω L - 1/(C ω) ). So the denominator has a term with j(ω L - 1/(C ω) ), which can be written as j( (L/C) ω² - 1 ) / ω. So the denominator is R + j ( (L/C) ω² - 1 ) / ω. So the zeros occur when the numerator is zero. The numerator is jω L, which is zero at ω=0. So yes, the transfer function has a zero at DC. So the LCF is at DC.

D: CR – Transfer function is R/(R + jω C R) = 1/(1 + jω/C R). So zeros at infinity. So high frequency.

E: RCL – I think this is a series RL and parallel RC. So the transfer function would have both numerator and denominator. Let me think: The impedance would be (R + jωL) || (1/(jωC)). So the voltage divider would be (R + jωL) || (1/(jωC)) divided by (R + jωL + 1/(jωC)). Alternatively, perhaps better to compute the transfer function.

Wait, the transfer function for RCL would be (R + jωL) || (1/(jωC)) divided by (R + jωL + 1/(jωC)). Let me compute that.

First, the numerator (impedance) is (R + jωL) * (1/(jωC)) / [ (R + jωL) + (1/(jωC)) ) ]

Because when you have two impedances in parallel, Z = Z1 || Z2 = (Z1 Z2) / (Z1 + Z2).

So numerator Z = (R + jω L) * (1/(jω C)) / [ (R + j ω L) + (1/(j ω C)) )

Denominator of H(jω) is (R + jω L + 1/(j ω C)), which is R + jω L - j/(C ω).

So the denominator of H(jω) is R + j (ω L - 1/(C ω)).

The numerator of H(jω) is (R + j ω L) * (1/(j ω C)).

Let me compute that:

(R + j ω L) * (1/(j ω C)) = [ R/(j ω C) ) + (j ω L)/(j ω C) ) ] = [ -j R/(ω C) + (L / C) ) ].

So H(jω) = [ -j R/(ω C) + L/C ] / [ R + j ( ω L - 1/(C ω) ) ].

Now, to find zeros, set numerator to zero: -j R/(ω C) + L/C = 0 → L/C = j R/(ω C) → ω = j R / L → which is at ω=0 (since j is imaginary) only if R and L are real numbers. So the zero occurs at ω=0. So the transfer function has a zero at DC.

So for RCL, the LCF is at DC, which is near the origin.

Wait, but the question is about the type of network when the LCF is due to a zero near origin. So when the LCF is at DC or near DC, then the type of network is where the transfer function has a zero at DC.

Looking at the options, which ones have a zero at DC?

CL: has a zero at DC.

RCL: as I've just calculated, has a zero at DC.

Wait, but I'm not sure about RCL. Let me think again.

Another approach: The type of network is determined by the circuit's elements. The options are:

- RL: circuit is a resistor and inductor in series. Transfer function has a zero at DC.

- RC: resistor and capacitor in series, transfer function has a zero at infinity.

- CL: inductor and capacitor in parallel, transfer function has a zero at infinity? Or at DC? Wait, earlier I thought CL had a zero at DC.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each circuit's transfer function.

Cl circuit: The transfer function is (jω L) / (R + jω(L + 1/(jω C)) ). Let me compute that.

Wait, denominator: R + jω ( L + 1/(j ω C) ). Let's compute inside: L + (1/(j ω C)).

Since 1/(j ω C) is -j/(ω C), because 1/j = -j.

So denominator becomes R + jω L - j/(ω C).

So the transfer function is (j ω L) / [ R + j ω ( L - 1/(C ω) ) ].

The numerator has a zero when jω L = 0 → ω=0.

So the transfer function has a zero at DC.

So CL has a zero at DC, so its LCF is at DC.

Similarly, RCL: earlier analysis suggests it has a zero at DC.

Wait, but then which option reflects that the LCF is at DC?

The options are A:RL, B:RC, C:CL, D:CR, E:RCL, F:LRC, G:LCR, H:LC, I:CL, J:CLR.

Wait, the options are given as:

Options:

A: RL

B: RC

C: CL

D: CR

E: RCL

F: LRC

G: LCR

H: LC

I:CLR

J: CLR

Wait, no, the options given are:

A: RL

B: RC

C: CL

D: CR

E: RCL

F: LRC

G: LCR

H: LC

I: CLR

J: LCR

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each circuit.

Wait, the options are:

A: RL

B: RC

C: CL

D: CR

E: RCL

F: LRC

G: LCR

H: LC

I: CLR

J: LCR

Wait, let me correct that. So the options are:

A: RL

B: RC

C: CL

D: CR

E: RCL

F: LRC

G: LCR

H: LC

I: CLR

J: LCR

Wait, perhaps my earlier analysis of E (RCL) is incorrect. Let's re-express the transfer function for RCL.

RCL: R in series with a parallel combination of L and C.

So the impedance is:

Z = R + (L || C) = R + [(L)(1/(j ω C)))/(L + 1/(j ω C)) ]

Which simplifies to:

Z = R + [ L/(j ω C) ) / ( L + 1/(j ω C) ) ]

Let me compute that:

Denominator is L + 1/(j ω C) = L + ( -j/(ω C) )

So, Z = R + [ L/(j ω C) ) / ( L - j/(ω C) ) ]

= [ R ( L - j/(ω C) ) + L/(j ω C) ) ] / ( L - j/(ω C) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the transfer function H(jω) = V_in / V_out.

For RCL, the transfer function is H(jω) = (R) / ( R + (jω L) || (1/(jω C)) )

= R / [ R + (jω L) / (jω L + 1/(j ω C )) ]

Simplifying the denominator:

jω L + 1/(j ω C) = j ω L - j/(ω C ) = j [ ω L - 1/(ω C) ]

So the denominator is R + [ j ( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ) ] / [ R ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to invert and compute the magnitude squared.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to see whether the transfer function has a zero at DC.

Wait, the numerator of H(jω) is R, so no zeros. Wait, that can't be right because earlier analysis suggested the transfer function has a zero at DC.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the transfer function calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the transfer function for RCL is (R) / (R + (jω L) || (1/(jω C)) )

Which is R divided by [ R + (jω L) / (jω L + 1/(jω C)) ) ]

Which is R divided by [ (R (jω L + 1/(jω C)) ) + jω L ) / (jω L + 1/(jω C)) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps too confusing. Maybe it's better to look for the zeros.

The transfer function H(jω) = R / [ R + (jω L) || (1/(jω C)) ]

So the denominator is R + (jω L) || (1/(jω C)).

The || operation is equivalent to Z2 || Z1 = (Z1 Z2)/(Z1 + Z2), but in this case, it's (jω L || 1/(jω C)).

So Z1 = jω L, Z2 = 1/(j ω C) = -j/(ω C)

So Z1 || Z2 = (jω L) * (-j/(ω C)) / [ (jω L) + (-j/(ω C)) ]

= [ (j * (-j) ) * ω L * 1/(ω C) ) ] / [ jω L - j/(ω C) ) ]

Simplify numerator: j*(-j) is 1, multiplied by ω L/(ω C) is L/C.

So numerator is L/C.

Denominator: j [ ω L - 1/(ω C) ]

So Z1 || Z2 = ( L/C ) / [ j( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ]

So the denominator of H(jω) is R + (L/C) / [ j( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ]

So H(jω) = R / [ R + (L/C)/( j( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ) ]

= R / [ ( R * j( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ) + (L/C) ) / ( j( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ) ]

= R * [ j ( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ) ] / [ R j ( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ) + L/C ]

The numerator of H(jω) is R j ( ω L - 1/(ω C) )

The denominator of H(jω) is R j ( ω L - 1/(ω C) ) ) + L/C.

So the transfer function's numerator is R j ( ... ), denominator is [ ... ] + L/C.

Wait, perhaps the transfer function's numerator is R j ( ... ), and the denominator includes L/C. The numerator has a j term.

So to find the zeros, set the numerator equal to zero: R j ( ... ) = 0 → j term can't be zero (since j is imaginary), so the numerator has no zeros. So the transfer function H(jω) has no zeros at DC.

Wait, that contradicts what I found earlier. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to think in terms of the poles and zeros. The transfer function H(jω) is R divided by some expression. If the expression in the denominator has a zero, that would mean the transfer function has a zero at that ω.

Wait, earlier in the CL case, the transfer function had a zero at DC.

But in RCL, perhaps it's different. Maybe my earlier analysis was incorrect.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the question again.

The question states that the lowest critical frequency (LCF) is due to zero, and it's near the origin. So the LCF is determined by a zero at DC.

Which circuit has a zero at DC? Looking back:

CL: Transfer function has a zero at DC.

RCL: Let me recheck. If I look at the transfer function of RCL, it has a zero at DC (ω=0) ?

Wait, in the RCL circuit, the transfer function's numerator is R, so no zeros. Wait, that can't be. Hmm. I'm getting confused. Let me try to look for the transfer function of RCL again.

RCL circuit is a series inductor and parallel inductor and capacitor? No, wait. RCL is a series resistor and parallel inductor and capacitor. So the transfer function is Z_in / V_out.

Alternatively, Z_in is (R + jω L) || (1/(jω C)).

So the transfer function H(jω) = (R + jω L) || (1/(jω C)) / ( R + jω L + 1/(jω C) ).

As before, let's compute H(jω) = [ (R + jω L)(1/(jω C)) ) / ( (R + jω L) + (1/(jω C)) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I should write this as H(jω) = [ (R + jω L) * (1/(j ω C)) ) ] / [ (R + jω L) + (1/(j ω C)) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (R + jω L) * (1/(j ω C)) ) = ( R/(j ω C) ) + ( j ω L / (j ω C) ) ) = ( R/(j ω C) ) + ( L/(C) ) )

Denominator: ( R + jω L ) + ( 1/(j ω C) ) ) = R + jω L - j/( ω C )

So the transfer function is [ ( R/(j ω C) ) + ( L/C ) ) ] / [ R + jω L - j/( ω C ) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps to find the zeros, set the numerator to zero:

R/(j ω C) + L/C = 0 → R/(j ω C) = - L/C → multiply both sides by j ω C:

R = - L/C * j ω C → R = - j ω L.

Since L is a positive real number, the right-hand side is imaginary. So R is real, but the left-hand side is real. So the equation can only be true if the right-hand side is real, which only happens when ω is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because when ω =0, the numerator term R/(j*0) is undefined. Hmm, perhaps I'm going wrong here.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the numerator calculation. Let's recompute the numerator:

Numerator is (R + jω L) * (1/(j ω C)) ).

Which is [ R * 1/(j ω C) ) + j ω L * 1/(j ω C) ) ]

= [ R/(j ω C) ) + ( j ω L )/(j ω C ) ) ]

= [ R/(j ω C) ) + ( L/C ) ]

So, R/(j ω C) can be written as (R j) / ( ω C^2 j^2 ) → Wait, perhaps a better approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by j to eliminate the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed differently. Let me consider the transfer function H(jω) for RCL.

H(jω) = ( R + jω L ) || ( 1/(j ω C) ) ) / ( R + jω L + 1/(j ω C) ) )

Which is [ ( R + jω L ) * ( 1/(j ω C) ) ) / ( ( R + jω L ) + 1/(j ω C) ) ] / ( R + jω L + 1/(j ω C) ) )

Wait, that's not right. The || operation is (Z1 Z2)/(Z1 + Z2), so:

H(jω) = ( (R + jω L) * (1/(j ω C)) ) ) / ( (R + jω L) + (1/(j ω C)) ) )

So, numerator: (R + jω L) * (1/(j ω C)) ) → ( R/(j ω C) ) + ( j ω L * 1/(j ω C) ) → R/(j ω C) + L/C.

Denominator: ( R + jω L ) + ( 1/(j ω C) ) → R + jω L - j/(ω C ) → R + j( ω L - 1/(ω C ) )

So,

H(jω) = [ R/(j ω C) + L/C ] / [ R + j( ω L - 1/(ω C ) ) ]

Now, to find the zeros, set the numerator to zero:

R/(j ω C) + L/C = 0.

Multiply both sides by j ω C:

R + L/(C) * j ω C = 0.

Wait, that's R + L j ω = 0.

So, R + L j ω = 0 → L j ω = - R → j ω = - R/(L ) → ω = - R/(L j ) → (since 1/j = -j )

So, ω = ( - R/(L ) ) * ( -j ) = ( R/(L ) ) j.

Which implies that the zeros occur when ω is imaginary. So for RCL, the zeros are at ω = j ( R/(L ) ), which is at DC (since j is imaginary).

Wait, but earlier I thought RCL has a zero at DC, which would make it a type that responds at DC.

So in the options, which ones have a zero at DC.

CL: yes, has zero at DC.

RCL: yes, has zero at DC.

But wait, the question is about the type of network when the LCF is due to a zero near the origin.

So, the network type is RCL or CL.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the options are:

A: RL

B: RC

C: CL

D: CR

E: RCL

F: LRC

G: LCR

H: LC

I: CLR

J: LCR

So, the options are A to I, each representing a different network type.

So, the question is, which network type has a zero at DC.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is option C: CL and option E: RCL.

Wait, but the question states that the LCF is due to a zero near the origin.

So, the network type is one where the LCF comes from a zero near the origin.

Therefore, the correct network is one where the transfer function has a zero at DC, which is the case for CL and RCL.

But wait, perhaps the network is RCL because it's a series RL and parallel RC, making the transfer function have a zero at DC.

So, the correct answer is either C or E.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question states that the type of network is determined by the network's type, and that the LCF is due to a zero near origin.

So, the LCF is due to a zero at DC, so the network type is one where the LCF comes from a zero at DC.

Looking at the options:

Option C: CL: yes, LCF comes from DC.

Option E: RCL: yes, LCF comes from DC.

So both C and E would be correct.

But the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate each network's transfer function.

Let me go back to each network:

1. RL: Transfer function has a zero at DC.

2. RC: Transfer function has a zero at infinity. So LCF is at infinity. So LCF due to DC.

Wait, but RC's LCF is at infinity, which is not near origin. So for RC, it's not due to zero near origin.

3. CL: Transfer function has a zero at DC.

4. CR: Transfer function has a zero at infinity (since it's a resistor in parallel with a capacitor, so the transfer function's zero is at DC when considering the parallel capacitor, but I'm not sure.)

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate each.

Another approach: The type of network is determined by the number of capacitors and inductors. The transfer function's zeros and poles determine the frequency response.

For example:

- RL: series inductor and resistor. Transfer function has a zero at DC.

- RC: series inductor and capacitor? No, it's a resistor in series with a capacitor. So the transfer function has a zero at infinity.

- CL: series inductor and parallel capacitor. So, the transfer function has a zero at DC.

- CR: series capacitor and resistor? No, it's a resistor in series with a capacitor. So the transfer function has a zero at infinity.

- RCL: series resistor and inductor, and parallel inductor and capacitor. So the transfer function has a zero at DC.

- LRC: series inductor and capacitor, and resistor? No, it's a resistor and inductor and capacitor. Wait, maybe it's a series resistor and inductor, and parallel inductor and capacitor. So the transfer function has a zero at DC.

Wait, but the question is which network type has the LCF due to a zero near origin (i.e., at DC).

So, which network has a zero at DC.

CL: yes.

RCL: yes.

But the options are (C) CL and (E) RCL.

So the correct answer would be both C and E. But since the question is multiple-choice, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the RCL analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, the RCL circuit is a series RL (resistor and inductor) and a parallel RC (capacitor and inductor).

So, the transfer function is H(jω) = (R + jω L) || (1/(j ω C)) ) / ( (R + jω L) + (1/(j ω C)) ) )

As before, the numerator is (R + jω L) * (1/(j ω C)) ) → R/(j ω C) + (j ω L)/(j ω C) ) → R/(j ω C) + L/C.

Denominator is ( R + jω L ) + (1/(j ω C) ) → R + jω L - j/(ω C).

Now, to find zeros, set numerator to zero:

R/(j ω C) + L/C = 0 → R/(j ω C) = - L/C → multiply both sides by j ω C:

R = - L/C * j ω C → R = - L j ω.

So R = - j L ω → jω = R/( - L ) → ω = - R/(j L) → which is imaginary, so zero at DC.

Wait, but that suggests that RCL has a zero at DC.

So, the correct answer would be option C: CL and option E: RCL.

But since the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps both are correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: CL.

Wait, but the question states "the type of network is determined by the network's type, and that the LCF is due to a zero near origin."

Wait, but if the LCF is due to a zero near origin, then the network must have a zero at DC.

So, options C and E have zeros at DC.

Thus, the correct answer would include both C and E.

But the options provided are:

C: CL

E: RCL

So, the correct answer would be both C and E. But since the options are given as letters, perhaps the answer is C and E.

But looking back, the options are:

C: CL

E: RCL

So, the correct answer is both C and E.

But in the given question, the options are:

A: RL

B: RC

C: CL

D: CR

E: RCL

F: LRC

G: LCR

H: LC

I: CLR

J: LCR

So, the correct answer is both C and E.

But in the given question, the options are only letters, so perhaps the correct answer is C and E.

But perhaps I should look for the answer in the options, and perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of RCL. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the RCL transfer function does not have a zero at DC. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the type of network based on the number of reactive components.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the network type is determined by the presence of inductors and capacitors. So, the transfer function's zeros and poles determine the frequency response.

In the case of RCL, the transfer function has a zero at DC.

So, the correct answer is C: CL and E: RCL.

But since the options are given in letters, perhaps the correct answer is both C and E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm getting stuck. I think the correct answer is option C: CL.

Wait, because in CL, the LCF is due to a zero at DC.

In RCL, the LCF is also due to a zero at DC.

So, both C and E are correct.

But since the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think that CL is the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think the correct answer is option C: CL.
</think>

The correct answer is **C: CL**. 

**Explanation:**

The question revolves around identifying the network type whose low-common-frequency (LCF) response is due to a zero near the origin (i.e., at DC). The LCF is influenced by the presence of poles and zeros in the transfer function of the network.

1. **RL Circuit (Option A):**  
   The transfer function has a zero at DC. However, it does not have a pole at DC, so this does not satisfy the condition.

2. **RC Circuit (Option B):**  
   The transfer function has a zero at infinity. Therefore, this does not satisfy the condition.

3. **CL Circuit (Option C):**  
   The transfer function of a CL circuit has a zero at DC. This matches the condition, as the LCF is due to a zero near the origin.

4. **CR Circuit (Option D):**  
   The transfer function of a CR circuit has a zero at DC. However, it does not have a pole at DC, so this does not satisfy the condition.

5. **RCL Circuit (Option E):**  
   The transfer function of an RCL circuit also has a zero at DC. This matches the condition, as the LCF is due to a zero near the origin.

6. **LRC Circuit (Option F):**  
   The transfer function of an LRC circuit has a zero at DC. This matches the condition.

7. **LCR Circuit (Option G):**  
   The transfer function of an LCR circuit has a zero at DC. This matches the condition.

8. **Option H: LC Circuit (Option H):**
