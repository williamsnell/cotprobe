Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage of electricity in the US came from fossil fuels as of 2019. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my energy statistics, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that the US is a big energy consumer. I think they're definitely a major user of fossil fuels. Maybe I can recall some percentages I've heard before. Let me think, fossil fuels are the primary energy sources in the US, especially for electricity.

I think the production of electricity in the US is mostly from natural gas, but fossil fuels also play a significant role. I'm trying to remember some numbers. Oh, wait, fossil fuels make up a big chunk. I think around 50% or more. But wait, sometimes I get confused between fossil fuels and other sources like coal, oil, etc.

Wait, fossil fuels include natural gas and oil. So, if fossil fuels are 50-60%, that might be the case. Looking at the options provided, I see option C is 53%, option I is 93%. Hmm, 93% seems too high. Probably not, because the US doesn't rely on that much. So maybe 53% is the correct answer. That's option C.

Alternatively, I can think about recent data. I think in 2019, fossil fuel-based electricity was about 53% of the total. Let me double-check. Oh right, fossil fuels are a major componentâ€”like, about 50-55% of electricity. So 53% fits that range.

Wait another thought: sometimes I mix up the percentages between fossil fuels and other non-renewable sources. But since the question is about fossil fuels, 53% makes sense. Also, I recall that in the US, the fossil fuel use is a significant part, especially for generating electricity and for other uses like transportation. So, 53% seems right.
