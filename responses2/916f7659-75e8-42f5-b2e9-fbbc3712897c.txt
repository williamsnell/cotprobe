Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about calculating the component cost of preferred stock for Lei-Feng, Inc. I remember that preferred stock has a different cost calculation compared to common stock because it doesn't pay dividends, but it's considered a hybrid security. 

The problem gives me some specific numbers. The preferred stock has a par value of $100, and the dividend is $10 per share. The current market price is $96. The marginal tax rate is 40%, but since preferred stock dividends aren't tax-deductible, I don't think that affects the cost here. 

So, the formula for the cost of preferred stock is the annual dividend divided by the current market price. That makes sense because it's similar to how we calculate the cost of equity, but for preferred stock. 

Let me plug in the numbers: $10 divided by $96. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 10 divided by 96 is approximately 0.1041666... That's roughly 10.4167%. 

Looking at the options, option E is 10.4 percent, which is the closest. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The tax rate isn't needed here because, as I thought, preferred stock dividends are not tax-exempt. So, the calculation is straightforward. 

Wait, are there any other factors I might have missed? Like, is the par value a factor in this scenario? No, because preferred stock's cost is based on the dividend and the market price, regardless of the par value. So I think I'm confident with my calculation. 

The options don't have a 10.4167%, but option E is 10.4 percent, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be E.

The cost of preferred stock is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the current market price. Here, the preferred stock has a $10 dividend, the market price is $96, so the cost is 10 / 96 â‰ˆ 10.4167%. The closest option is E) 10.4 percent.

Answer: E
