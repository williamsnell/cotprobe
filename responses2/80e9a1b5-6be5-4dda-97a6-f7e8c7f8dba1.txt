Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the function f(z) that's analytic in the upper half-plane. The conditions given are that f(f(z)) = z, meaning f is its own inverse, and f'(z) = 1/z². I also need to find f(2). Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, since f is analytic and defined on the upper half-plane, and f(f(z)) = z, f must be a linear fractional transformation, or Möbius transformation, because those are the only analytic functions on the upper half-plane that are their own inverses. So f must be of the form f(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d), where a, b, c, d are complex numbers, and ad - bc ≠ 0 to make sure it's invertible.

But wait, f'(z) is given as 1/z². Let me compute the derivative of a general Möbius transformation to see what conditions that imposes. If f(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d), then f’(z) is (a(cz + d) - c(az + b))/(cz + d)^2. Simplifying the numerator: a(cz + d) - c(az + b) = ac z + ad - ac z - bc = ad - bc. So f’(z) = (ad - bc)/(cz + d)^2. 

But according to the problem, f’(z) is 1/z². So (ad - bc)/(cz + d)^2 = 1/z². That means the numerator ad - bc must equal 1, and the denominator (cz + d)^2 must equal z². So (cz + d)^2 = z². Let's expand that: c² z² + 2cd z + d² = z². Comparing coefficients, c² must be 1, 2cd must be 0, and d² must be 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if d² = 0, then d = 0. Then 2cd = 0 would be satisfied regardless. But c² = 1 implies c = ±1. So let's take c = 1 and d = 0. Then (cz + d)^2 = z², so that works. Alternatively, c = -1, d = 0 would also give (cz + d)^2 = z², since (-z)^2 is z². So both c = 1 and c = -1, d=0 are possible.

So ad - bc = 1. Since d=0, this becomes a*0 - b*c = -bc = 1. So bc = -1. So from c = ±1, b must be -1/(c). So if c =1, then b = -1. If c = -1, then b = 1. So the function f(z) can be either (az - 1)/(z + 0) = (az -1)/z or (az +1)/(-z) = -(az +1)/z.

Wait, maybe I should write it as f(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d). So with d=0, f(z) = (az + b)/cz. Since ad - bc = 1, with d=0, it's a*0 - bc = -bc =1, so bc = -1. So possible options:

Case 1: c =1, then b = -1. So f(z) = (az -1)/z.

Case 2: c = -1, then b = 1. So f(z) = (az +1)/(-z) = -(az +1)/z.

So now we have two possibilities for f(z): either (az -1)/z or -(az +1)/z.

But we also know that f(f(z)) = z. Let's check which case satisfies this condition.

Let's compute f(f(z)) for both cases.

Case 1: f(z) = (az -1)/z. Then f(f(z)) = a*(f(z)) -1 / f(z). Let me compute f(f(z)):

f(f(z)) = [a*( (az -1)/z ) -1 ] / [ (az -1)/z ]

Simplify numerator: a*(az -1)/z -1 = [a(az -1) - z]/z = (a² z - a - z)/z = ( (a² -1) z - a ) / z.

Denominator: (az -1)/z.

So f(f(z)) = [ ( (a² -1) z - a ) / z ] / [ (az -1)/z ] = ( (a² -1) z - a ) / (az -1).

Set this equal to z:

( (a² -1) z - a ) / (az -1) = z.

Multiply both sides by (az -1):

( (a² -1) z - a ) = z (az -1 )

Expand the right side: a² z² - z.

So the equation is:

(a² -1) z - a = a² z² - z.

Bring all terms to left:

(a² -1) z - a - a² z² + z = 0.

Combine like terms:

( (a² -1) + 1 ) z - a - a² z² = 0

Simplify:

(a²) z - a - a² z² = 0

Factor:

- a² z² + a² z - a = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

a² z² -a² z + a = 0

We need this to hold for all z, so the coefficients must be zero.

Thus:

a² = 0 (coefficient of z²)
-a² = 0 (coefficient of z)
a = 0 (constant term)

But this leads to a = 0, which is a contradiction because a can't be zero (as denominator would be zero in f(z)). So Case 1 doesn't work.

Case 2: f(z) = -(az +1)/z.

Compute f(f(z)):

Let me write f(z) = -(az +1)/z. Then f(f(z)) = a*(f(z)) +1 / (-f(z)). Wait, no:

Wait f(f(z)) is [f(f(z)) ] = [ -a*(f(z)) -1 ] / [ -f(z) ]

Wait, let me compute step by step.

f(z) = -(az + 1)/z = -a z^{-1} - z^{-1} *1. Hmm, maybe better to compute f(f(z)) as follows:

f(f(z)) = f( -(az +1)/z ) = -a*( ( -(az +1)/z ) +1 ) / ( -(az +1)/z )

Wait, let me compute the numerator: -(az +1)/z. Then f(f(z)) = a*( -(az +1)/z ) +1 / ( -a*( -(az +1)/z ) )

Wait, that might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute f(f(z)) for Case 2.

f(z) = -(az +1)/z.

So f(f(z)) = f( -(az +1)/z ) = - [ a*( -(az +1)/z ) + 1 ] / [ -(az +1)/z ]

Compute numerator inside f: a*(-(az +1)/z) + 1 = -a(az +1)/z + 1.

Let me compute that:

= (-a² z - a)/z +1 = (-a² z -a + z ) / z

So numerator of f(f(z)) is (-a² z -a + z ) / z.

Denominator of f(f(z)) is -(az +1)/z.

So f(f(z)) = [ (-a² z -a + z ) / z ] / [ -(az +1)/z ].

The z denominators cancel out, so:

= ( -a² z -a + z ) / ( - (a z + 1) )

Simplify numerator:

= ( (-a² +1 ) z -a ) / ( -a z -1 )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (-a² +1) z - a

Denominator: -a z -1.

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -(a² -1) z -a

Denominator: -a z -1 = -(a z +1 )

So f(f(z)) = [ - (a² -1) z -a ] / [ - (a z +1) ) ] = [ (a² -1) z + a ] / (a z +1 )

Set f(f(z)) = z:

[ (a² -1) z + a ] / (a z +1 ) = z

Multiply both sides by (a z +1):

(a² -1) z + a = z(a z +1 )

Expand right side:

= a² z² + z

Bring all terms to left:

(a² -1) z + a -a² z² - z = 0

Combine like terms:

( (a² -1) -1 ) z + a -a² z² = 0

= (a² -2 ) z + a -a² z² = 0

Multiply by -1:

a² z² - (a² -2 ) z - a = 0

We need this to hold for all z, so coefficients must be zero:

a² = 0 → a = 0.

But a can't be zero because then f(z) would be undefined. So this case also doesn't work. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the computation. Let me double-check.

Wait, f(f(z)) in Case 2 is:

f(f(z)) = [ (-a² z -a + z ) / z ] / [ -(az +1)/z ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerator's sign.

Wait, f(f(z)) = [ numerator ] / [ denominator ].

Numerator inside f(f(z)) is: a*(f(z)) +1, because f(w) = a w +1 where w = f(z). Wait, no, no, f(w) is -(a w +1)/w. So f(f(z)) = -(a f(z) +1) / f(z).

Wait, maybe I should write it as f(f(z)) = -(a f(z) +1)/f(z).

So f(z) is -(a z +1)/z.

Thus, f(f(z)) = -(a*( -(a z +1)/z ) +1 ) / ( -(a z +1)/z )

Compute numerator:

= - [ ( -a² z -a ) / z + 1 ]

= - [ ( -a² z -a + z ) / z ]

= - [ (-a² z + z -a ) / z ]

= - [ z(-a² +1) -a ] / z

= [ (-a² +1) z + a ] / z

Denominator: -(a z +1)/z

So f(f(z)) = [ (-a² +1) z + a ] / z divided by [ -(a z +1)/z ]

Which is [ (-a² +1) z + a ] / [ - (a z +1) ]

So [ (1 - a²) z + a ] / (-a z -1 )

Set equal to z:

[ (1 - a²) z + a ] / (-a z -1 ) = z

Multiply both sides by (-a z -1):

(1 - a²) z + a = z (-a z -1 )

Expand right side: -a z² - z

Bring all terms to left:

(1 -a²) z +a +a z² + z = 0

Combine like terms:

(a z² ) + ( (1 -a²) +1 ) z + a =0

Simplify:

a z² + (2 -a²) z + a =0

This must hold for all z, so coefficients must be zero:

a = 0 → but a can't be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write the equation again.

From f(f(z)) = z, we have:

(1 -a²) z + a = -a z² - z.

Wait, let me rearrange:

(1 -a²) z + a + a z² + z = 0.

Which is a z² + (1 -a² +1) z + a =0.

So that's a z² + (2 -a²) z + a =0.

Since this must hold for all z, the coefficients must be zero:

a =0 from the z² term, but that's impossible.

Wait, then this suggests that maybe Case 2 is not working either. But that contradicts the problem statement, so perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should not have considered both cases. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the function form. Let's think again.

Wait, going back, f’(z) =1/z², which is given. And f(f(z)) = z.

So f is a Möbius transformation, and we have f’(z) =1/z². Möbius transformations have derivatives of the form (ad - bc)/(cz +d)^2. So we have (ad - bc) =1 and (cz +d)^2 = z², so cz +d = ±z.

So we have two possibilities: cz +d = z or cz +d = -z.

Case 1: cz + d = z → c=1, d=0.

Then, ad - bc =1 → a*0 -b*1 = -b =1 → b= -1.

So f(z) = (a z -1)/z.

Compute f’(z) = (a z -1)’ * z - (a z -1)/z² = (a z -1 +a z)/z²? Wait, no, better to compute f’(z) as (a z -1)’ * z - (a z -1) * (z)’ ) / z².

Wait, f(z) = (a z -1)/z = a - 1/z.

So f’(z) = 0 + 1/z² =1/z². That's correct.

Case 2: cz +d = -z → c=-1, d=0.

Then, ad - bc = a*0 - b*(-1) = b =1 → b=1.

So f(z) = (a z +1)/(-z) = - (a z +1)/z.

Compute f’(z): derivative of -(a z +1)/z is [ -a * z - (-a z -1) ] / z² = [ -a z +a z +1 ] / z² = 1/z². Correct.

So in both cases, f’(z)=1/z².

But earlier, when I tried to impose f(f(z))=z, I got stuck because both cases lead to a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation when I set f(f(z))=z.

Let me try to do that more carefully for Case 1: f(z) = (a z -1)/z.

Compute f(f(z)):

f(z) = (a z -1)/z.

So f(f(z)) = [ a*( (a z -1)/z ) -1 ] / [ (a z -1)/z ]

Simplify numerator:

= [ (a² z -a ) / z - 1 ] = (a² z -a - z ) / z = [ (a² -1) z -a ] / z.

Denominator: (a z -1)/z.

So f(f(z)) = [ (a² -1) z -a ] / z divided by [ (a z -1)/z ] = [ (a² -1) z -a ] / [ (a z -1) ].

Set equal to z:

[ (a² -1) z -a ] / (a z -1 ) = z.

Multiply both sides by (a z -1):

(a² -1) z -a = z (a z -1 )

Expand right side: a² z² -z.

Bring all terms to left:

(a² -1) z -a -a² z² + z =0.

Combine like terms:

- a² z² + (a² -1 +1 ) z - a =0 → -a² z² + a² z -a =0.

Multiply by -1:

a² z² -a² z +a =0.

For this to hold for all z, coefficients must be zero:

a² =0 → a=0, but then f(z)= (-1)/z, which would have f(f(z))= z, but f’(z) would be 1/z², which is correct.

Wait, so f(z)= -1/z.

Let me check: f(z) = -1/z. Then f’(z)=1/z². Also, f(f(z))=f(-1/z) = -1/(-1/z) = z. Yes, that works.

So f(z) = -1/z is a solution. So this is the function.

Wait, then why earlier I was getting a problem with this? Because when I tried to compute f(f(z)) in Case 1, I ended up with a contradiction, but perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, in Case 1, I think I might have miscalculated the numerator when f(f(z)) was computed. Let me check again.

f(z) = (a z -1)/z.

So f(f(z)) = [ a*( (a z -1)/z ) -1 ] / [ (a z -1)/z ]

Compute numerator:

= [ (a² z -a ) / z - 1 ] = [ (a² z -a - z ) / z ] = [ (a² -1) z -a ] / z.

Denominator: (a z -1)/z.

So f(f(z))= [ (a² -1) z -a ] / z * z/(a z -1 ) = [ (a² -1) z -a ] / (a z -1 ).

Set equal to z:

[ (a² -1) z -a ] / (a z -1 ) = z.

Multiply both sides by (a z -1):

(a² -1) z -a = a z² - z.

Bring all terms to left:

(a² -1) z -a -a z² + z =0.

Combine like terms:

(-a² z²) + (a² z + z) + (-a) =0.

Factor:

- a² z² + (a² +1) z -a =0.

Since this must hold for all z, coefficients must be zero:

- a² =0 → a=0.

But then, f(z)= (-1)/z.

Wait, so a=0 is the only possibility here, but then in the expression:

- a² z² + (a² +1) z -a → with a=0, becomes 0 + (0 +1) z -0 = z. Which is correct.

So f(f(z))= z when a=0, and f(z) = -1/z.

Thus, f(z) = -1/z is the function satisfying all given conditions.

So now, the function is f(z) = -1/z.

Wait, but the problem states that f'(z) = 1/z², which is correct because derivative of -1/z is 1/z².

So f(z) = -1/z.

Now, the problem asks for f(4).

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the function definition?

Wait, function f(z) = -1/z, but the upper half-plane is z with Im(z) >0. So what is f(4)? 4 is a real number, Im(4)=0, which is not in the upper half-plane. So perhaps the function is defined on the upper half-plane, but the problem gives f(4) as a possible value, but since 4 is real, perhaps that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the function definition.

Wait, but according to the problem, the function is defined on the upper half-plane, so z must satisfy Im(z) >0. But in the function f(z) = -1/z, z can take any real number except zero, but for Im(z) >0, z is in the upper half-plane. Wait, but 4 is a real number, so z=4 is on the real axis, which is not in the upper half-plane. So perhaps I made a mistake in the function.

Wait, maybe f(z) = 1/z, but then f’(z)= -1/z², which doesn't match the given f’(z)=1/z². So that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the function is f(z) = -z, but f’(z)=-1, which doesn't match. So that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the original problem and see if I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the problem says f is analytic on the upper half-plane, and f’(z) =1/z². So the derivative is 1/z², so f(z) can be written as ∫1/z² dz + C = -1/z + C. So f(z) = -1/z + C. Now, we know that f(f(z))=z, so let's compute f(f(z)).

f(z) = -1/z + C.

f(f(z)) = -1/( -1/z + C ) + C.

Set this equal to z:

-1/( -1/z + C ) + C = z.

Solve for C.

Let me compute the denominator:

-1/z + C = ( -1 + C z ) / z.

So f(f(z)) = -1/( ( -1 + C z ) / z ) + C = -z/( -1 + C z ) + C.

Set this equal to z:

- z/( -1 + C z ) + C = z.

Multiply both sides by (-1 + C z):

- z + C (-1 + C z ) = z (-1 + C z ).

Expand left side:

- z - C + C² z².

Right side:

- z + C² z².

So equation:

- z - C + C² z² = - z + C² z².

Subtract -z from both sides:

- C + C² z² = 0.

So, for all z, C² z² - C =0.

This implies that C²=0 and C=0, but that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps when I multiplied both sides by (-1 + C z), the denominator is non-zero, so that the equation holds.

Wait, perhaps, instead, I should re-express f(f(z)) = z.

We have:

f(f(z)) = -1/( -1/z + C ) + C = -1/( ( -1 + C z )/z ) + C = -z/( -1 + C z ) + C.

Set equal to z:

- z/( -1 + C z ) + C = z.

Multiply both sides by (-1 + C z):

- z + C (-1 + C z ) = z (-1 + C z ).

Expand:

- z - C + C² z² = - z + C² z².

Bring all terms to left:

- z - C + C² z² + z - C² z² =0.

Simplify:

(-z + z) + (-C) + (C² z² - C² z² ) =0 → -C=0 → C=0.

So f(z) = -1/z +0 = -1/z.

So the function is f(z)= -1/z.

Thus, f(4)= -1/4.

Wait, but 4 is a real number, and the upper half-plane is z with Im(z)>0. So 4 is on the real axis, which is not in the upper half-plane. Thus, it's not in the domain of f. Hmm, but the problem says f is defined on the upper half-plane, so maybe z=4 is not in the domain, thus f(4) is not defined.

But the problem gives the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the function. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps the function f(z) = sqrt(z), but that's not analytic on the upper half-plane. Alternatively, perhaps the function is f(z)= -sqrt(z), but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that f(4)= -1/4, even though 4 is not in the domain, as the problem gives the options.

Wait, but according to the problem, the function is defined on the upper half-plane, so z=4 is not in the domain, so f(4) is not defined. Thus, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, but the function f(z)= -1/z is analytic on the upper half-plane, except at z=0, which is not on the upper half-plane. So that function is valid.

Wait, but then f(4) would be -1/4. So the answer is -1/4, which is option B.

Wait, but looking back, in the options given, the choices are A:1, B:-1/2, C:-1/4, D:-1.

So the answer would be C: -1/4.

But earlier, I thought that f(z)= -1/z would satisfy f(f(z))=z, and f’(z)=1/z², but I was confused why in Case 1, when I tried to compute f(f(z)), I ended up with a contradiction, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute f(f(z)) for f(z)= -1/z.

Compute f(z) = -1/z.

Compute f(f(z)) = f(-1/z) = -1/( -1/z ) = z. So f(f(z))=z holds.

So f(z) = -1/z is a solution.

Thus, f(4) = -1/4. So the correct answer is option C: -1/4.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to compute f(f(z)) for Case 2, I also got a contradiction, but now I'm confident that f(z)= -1/z is a correct solution. So I think option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the function is analytic on the upper half-plane, which includes z where Im(z) >0, but 4 is on the real axis, so it's not in the upper half-plane. So perhaps the function is only defined on the upper half-plane, but in that case, z=4 would not be in the domain, so f(4) is undefined. But the problem seems to imply that f(4) is defined, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f(z) = 1/z, but that would have f’(z)= -1/z², which doesn't match. So that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is f(z) = i/z, but then f’(z)= -i/z², which doesn't match.

Wait, but perhaps I should reconsider the function. Since f’(z)=1/z², integrating gives f(z)= -1/z + C.

We found that C=0, so f(z)= -1/z.

Thus, f(4)= -1/4, which is option C.

So I think the correct answer is C: -1/4.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( f(4) \) is \boxed{C}.
</think>

Given the problem, we need to find the function \( f \) that satisfies the following conditions:
1. \( f \) is analytic on the upper half-plane.
2. \( f'(z) = \frac{1}{z^2} \).
3. \( f(f(z)) = z \).

We start by noting that \( f \) must be a Möbius transformation. Given \( f'(z) = \frac{1}{z^2} \), we know that the derivative of a Möbius transformation \( f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d} \) must be of the form \( \frac{ad - bc}{(cz + d)^2} \). This leads us to the condition \( (ad - bc) = 1 \) and \( (cz + d)^2 = z^2 \), implying \( cz + d = \pm z \).

We consider two cases for \( cz + d \):
1. \( cz + d = z \) which gives \( c = 1 \) and \( d = 0 \).
2. \( cz + d = -z \) which gives \( c = -1 \) and \( d = 0 \).

For the first case, we find that \( f(z) = \frac{az - 1}{z} \). Since \( f'(z) = \frac{1}{z^2} \), we determine that \( a = 0 \), leading to \( f(z) = -\frac{1}{z} \).

For the second case, we similarly find that \( f(z) = \frac{az + 1}{-z} \), but this leads to a contradiction when checking \( f(f(z)) = z \).

Thus, the function \( f(z) = -\frac{1}{z} \) satisfies all given conditions. Evaluating this function at \( z = 4 \) gives \( f(4) = -\frac{1}{4} \).

The value of \( f(4) \) is \(\boxed{C}\).
