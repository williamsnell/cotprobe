Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a vibrating system described by the equation u'' + γ u' + u = 0. I'm supposed to find the damping coefficient γ such that the quasi period of the damped motion is 50% greater than the undamped period. Hmm, I remember that for a damped harmonic oscillator, the behavior is governed by the damping ratio and the natural frequency. 

Wait, the equation given looks like the standard form of a damped harmonic oscillator, which is usually written as u'' + 2ζω₀ u' + ω₀² u = 0. So comparing that to the given equation, I can see that γ is twice the damping coefficient ζ. Oh wait, no, wait—wait a second. Let me check again. The given equation has γ u', which would correspond to 2ζω₀ in the standard form. So γ = 2ζω₀. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now. Maybe I should think about the oscillation periods.

The problem says that the quasi period (which I think is the damped period) is 50% greater than the undamped period. So let me recall the formulas for the periods. 

In the undamped case, the angular frequency is ω₀ = sqrt(k/m), so the period T₀ is 2π/ω₀. 

In the damped case, the angular frequency becomes ω = sqrt(ω₀² - γ²/(4)), but wait, no, that's when damping is critical or underdamped. Wait, actually, the damping can be underdamped, overdamped, or critically damped. But since the problem is talking about quasi period, I think it's underdamped, which means γ < 2ω₀. So the damped angular frequency is ω_d = sqrt(ω₀² - (γ/2)^2). 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, another way: the damped equation has a general solution where the angular frequency is ω_d = sqrt(ω₀² - (γ/2)^2). So the damped period T_d is 2π/ω_d.

Wait, no, because the equation is u'' + γ u' + u = 0. So the standard form is u'' + 2ζω₀ u' + ω₀² u = 0. So comparing, 2ζω₀ = γ, so ζ = γ/(2ω₀). And the damped angular frequency ω_d is sqrt(ω₀² - (γ/2)^2). So ω_d = sqrt(ω₀² - (γ/2)^2) = sqrt(ω₀^2 - (gamma^2/4)).

So the undamped period T₀ is 2π/ω₀. The damped period T_d is 2π/(sqrt(ω₀² - (γ²/4))). 

We're told that T_d = 1.5 T₀. So let's set up the equation:

(T_d)/(T₀) = 1.5
=> [2π/(sqrt(ω₀² - (γ^2/4)))] / [2π/ω₀] = 1.5

Simplify that. The 2π cancels out, so:

ω₀ / sqrt(ω₀² - (γ²/4)) ) = 1.5

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(ω₀²) / (ω₀² - (γ²/4)) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

Multiply both sides by denominator:

ω₀² = 2.25 (ω₀² - γ²/4 )

Expand the right side:

ω₀² = 2.25 ω₀² - (2.25 * γ²)/4

Bring all terms to the left:

ω₀² - 2.25 ω₀² + (2.25 γ²)/4 = 0

Combine like terms:

-1.25 ω₀² + (2.25 γ²)/4 = 0

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators:

-5 ω₀² + 2.25 γ² = 0

So 2.25 γ² = 5 ω₀²

=> γ² = (5 ω₀²) / 2.25 

Simplify 5/2.25 = 5/(9/4) )= 5*(4/9) )= 20/9.

So γ² = (20/9) ω₀²

=> γ = ω₀ * sqrt(20/9) )= ω₀ * (2 sqrt(5))/3 )

Wait, but wait, I thought ω₀ was sqrt(k/m), but the problem doesn't give any specific values for k and m. So I think that the correct approach is to express γ in terms of ζ, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of periods. Let me write the ratio T_d / T₀ = 1.5.

Expressed as:

T_d = (2π)/ω_d = 1.5 * (2π)/ω₀ → which simplifies to ω_d = (2π)/(1.5 * 2π/ω₀ ) ) → but wait, perhaps better to go back.

Wait, no. Let's write T_d = 1.5 T₀.

T₀ is 2π/ω₀, T_d is 2π/ω_d.

So:

2π/ω_d = 1.5 * (2π/ω₀ )

Cancel 2π on both sides:

1/ω_d = 1.5/(ω₀ )

→ ω_d = ω₀ / 1.5 = (2/3) ω₀.

But earlier, I wrote that ω_d = sqrt(ω₀² − (γ/2)^2 )

So:

sqrt( ω₀² − (γ/2)^2 ) = (2/3) ω₀.

Square both sides:

ω₀² − (γ²)/4 = (4/9) ω₀².

Bring the terms to the same side:

ω₀² - (4/9) ω₀² = (γ²)/4.

Compute the left side:

(1 -4/9) ω₀² = (5/9) ω₀².

So, (5/9) ω₀² = (γ²)/4.

Multiply both sides by 4:

(20/9) ω₀² = γ².

So γ = ω₀ * sqrt(20/9) ) = (2/3) ω₀ * sqrt(5).

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the damping ratio. Because for underdamped motion, the damping ratio ζ is γ/(2ω₀). 

Wait, let me correct. The damping ratio ζ is γ/(2ω₀). Because the standard form is (damped) equation: u'' + 2ζω₀ u' + ω₀² u = 0. So in our case, the equation is u'' + γ u' + u = 0. So 2ζω₀ = γ → ζ = γ/(2 ω₀).

Wait, so perhaps instead of dealing with ω₀, I can express in terms of ζ.

Given that, the period ratio was 1.5, so let's think in terms of ζ.

We have T_d = T₀ / (2 ζ), or some relation involving ζ.

Wait, I'm trying to find T_d. The damped period is T_d = 2π / ω_d, where ω_d = sqrt(ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ). Alternatively, since 2ζω₀ = γ, ω₀ = γ/(2 ζ). 

Wait, no, wait. ζ is γ/(2ω₀), so ω₀ = γ/(2ζ). Hmm, let's see. So substituting into ω_d:

ω_d = sqrt( ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (γ/(2ζ))² - (γ/2)^2 ) 

Factor out (γ^2/4):

= sqrt( (γ² /4) ( 1/ζ² - 1 ) )

= (γ/2) sqrt( (1 - ζ²)/ ζ² )

= (γ/2) ( sqrt(1 - ζ²) / ζ )

So ω_d = (γ/ (2 ζ)) sqrt(1 - ζ²).

The damped period T_d is 2π / ω_d → 2π / [ (γ (sqrt(1 - ζ²) ) )/( 2 ζ ) ) ] 

Simplify:

T_d = (2π * 2 ζ ) / ( γ sqrt(1 - ζ²) ) ) = (4 π ζ ) / ( γ sqrt(1 - ζ²) )

But we know T_d = 1.5 T₀.

T₀ is 2π/ω₀ = 2π / (γ/(2 ζ )) )= (2π * 2 ζ ) / γ )= (4 π ζ ) / γ.

So, T_d = 1.5 * (4 π ζ / gamma )

Putting it together:

(4 π ζ ) / ( gamma sqrt(1 - ζ²) ) ) = 1.5 * (4 π ζ / gamma )

Simplify both sides. Notice that 4 π ζ / gamma appears on both sides. So assuming that is not zero (which it isn't, as gamma is a positive damping coefficient), we can divide both sides by (4 π ζ / gamma ), which gives:

1/(sqrt(1 - ζ^2)) = 1.5

So, 1.5 = 1/sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - ζ^2 ) = 1/1.5 → 2/3.

So, sqrt(1 - ζ^2 ) = 2/3.

Square both sides: 1 - ζ^2 = 4/9 → ζ² = 1 - 4/9 = 5/9 → ζ = sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 2.236 /3 ≈ 0.745.

So the damping ratio ζ is approximately 0.745.

Now, from ζ, we can find gamma.

We know that ζ = gamma / (2 ω₀ ), but ω₀ is sqrt(k/m), but since we don't have k and m, maybe we can express γ in terms of ζ. Alternatively, in the equation, since the system is defined as u'' + gamma u' + u =0, and we can relate this to the standard form.

Wait, but maybe to find gamma, we can relate it to the damping ratio ζ. Since ζ = gamma/(2ω₀ ), and ω₀ = sqrt(k/m), but without knowing k and m, perhaps we can find gamma in terms of ζ, but without numerical values, we can't proceed. So perhaps another approach.

Wait, another way. Let's remember that for the damped period, the ratio T_d/T_0 is related to ζ. 

The exact formula for the period ratio is T_d = T_0 / (2ζ). Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think: when damping is small (ζ near 0), the period becomes longer, so T_d is larger than T_0. For larger ζ, T_d approaches T_0. So when ζ = 0, T_d would be an imaginary number (like in critically damped), but for small ζ, T_d is longer.

Wait, but for underdamped motion, the ratio is T_d = T_0 * (1/(2ζ)) ? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The exact formula for the damped period is T_d = (2π) / sqrt(ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ). And the natural period T₀ is 2π/ω₀.

The ratio T_d / T₀ is sqrt( (ω₀^2 + (γ/2)^2 ) ) / ω₀ )^{-1}? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, I think the ratio is sqrt( (ω₀^2 + (γ/2)^2 ) ) / ω₀ )^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute T_d / T₀:

T_d/T₀ = [2π/ω_d ] / [2π/ω₀ ] = ω₀ / ω_d.

But ω_d = sqrt( ω₀^2 - (γ/2)^2 ).

So T_d/T₀ = ω₀ / sqrt( ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ) = 1/( sqrt(1 - (γ/(2 ω₀ ))^2 ) )

Wait, because:

ω₀ / sqrt( ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt( 1 - (γ/(2 ω₀ ))^2 )

Because:

sqrt( ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ) = ω₀ * sqrt(1 - (γ/(2 ω₀ ))^2 )

So, 1/( ω₀ * sqrt(1 - (γ/(2 ω₀ ))^2 )) = (1/ω₀ ) * 1 / sqrt(1 - (γ/(2 ω₀ ))^2 ) 

Wait, so ω₀ / sqrt( ... ) = 1/( sqrt(1 - (γ/(2 ω₀ ))^2 ) )

So, T_d/T₀ = 1/( sqrt(1 - (gamma/(2 ω₀ ))^2 ) )

But wait, that's not matching the earlier equation. Let me recheck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for a relationship involving the damping ratio ζ.

Wait, another approach: recall that for a damped harmonic oscillator, the damped period is given by T_d = T_0 / (2 ζ). But I'm not certain about this. Let me check:

The exact formula for the period of an underdamped oscillator is T_d = 2π / sqrt( ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ) ). And the natural period is T₀ = 2π/ω₀.

So T_d = T₀ * (ω₀) / sqrt( ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 ) )

So T_d / T₀ = ω₀ / sqrt(ω₀² - (γ²/4) ) = 1 / sqrt( 1 - (γ²)/(4 ω₀² ) )

But since ζ = γ/(2 ω₀ ), then γ = 2 ζ ω₀.

Substituting γ into the ratio:

T_d / T₀ = 1 / sqrt( 1 - ( (2 ζ ω₀ )^2 )/(4 ω₀² ) )

Simplify the denominator inside the square root:

( (4 ζ² ω₀² ) / (4 ω₀² ) ) = ζ².

So, T_d/T₀ = 1 / sqrt( 1 - ζ² )

We are told that T_d / T₀ = 1.5.

So:

1.5 = 1 / sqrt(1 - ζ² )

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - ζ² ) = 1/1.5 = 2/3.

Square both sides:

1 - ζ² = 4/9 → ζ² = 1 -4/9 =5/9 → ζ = sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745.

So the damping ratio ζ is sqrt(5)/3, which is approximately 0.745.

Now, since ζ = gamma/(2 ω₀ ), then:

gamma = 2 ζ ω₀.

But wait, we don't know omega_0, but the problem doesn't give us any specific values for k and m, which are the spring constant and mass. So is it possible that the problem expects an expression in terms of omega_0? But looking at the answer options, they're all numerical values, so perhaps it's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming a certain relationship.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of the periods is given by (1 + ζ )^(-1) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio can be expressed as 1/(2 sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )).

Wait, because from earlier:

T_d / T₀ = 1 / sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )

Set that equal to 1.5:

1.5 = 1 / sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )

Which gives sqrt(1 - ζ^2 ) = 1/1.5 → 2/3.

As before, so ζ^2 = 1 - (4/9) =5/9 → ζ = sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745.

But then, gamma = 2 ζ ω₀.

Wait, but since we don't have omega_0, perhaps the problem assumes that the natural frequency omega_0 is 1 rad/s, given the options are in terms of gamma, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to express gamma in terms of the given T_d and T_0, but I'm not seeing the direct way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem says the quasi-period is 50% greater than T_0. So T_d = 1.5 T_0.

But from the equation, the ratio of the periods is T_d/T_0 = 1/(2 sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio can be expressed as 1/(2 sqrt(1 - (ζ)^2 )).

Wait, earlier I had:

T_d / T_0 = 1 / sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )

Which led to ζ = sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745.

But perhaps another formula: The quasi-period of the damped system is T_d = T_0 (1/(2 sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )) )? No, perhaps I've confused the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is T_d = T_0 * (1 / (2 sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )) )?

Wait, no, earlier I derived that T_d / T_0 = 1 / sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )

So 1.5 = 1 / sqrt(1 - ζ^2 )

So sqrt(1 - ζ^2 ) = 1/1.5 = 2/3

Squaring gives 1 - ζ^2 = 4/9 → ζ^2 = 5/9 → ζ = sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745.

So from this, I can find gamma.

But gamma is the damping coefficient. So gamma = 2 ζ ω_0.

Wait, but I don't know ω_0. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the natural frequency ω_0 is 1, but that is not indicated in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is that for an underdamped system, the period is T = 2π / sqrt(ω₀² - (γ/2)^2 )

So the ratio T_d / T_0 = [2π / sqrt(ω₀^2 - (γ^2 /4 )) ] / [2π/ω₀ ] = ω₀ / sqrt(ω₀^2 - (γ^2 /4 )) 

Set this equal to 1.5.

So ω₀ / sqrt( ω₀² - (γ^2 /4 )) = 1.5.

Let me square both sides:

(ω₀^2) / ( ω₀² - γ²/4 ) = 2.25.

Multiply denominator:

ω₀^2 = 2.25 ( ω₀^2 - γ²/4 )

Expand the right:

ω₀^2 = 2.25 ω₀^2 - (2.25 * γ² )/4.

Bring all terms to left:

ω₀^2 -2.25 ω₀^2 + (2.25 γ² )/4 =0.

Combine like terms:

-1.25 ω₀^2 + ( 2.25 γ^2 )/4 =0.

Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:

-5 ω₀^2 + 2.25 γ^2 =0.

→ 2.25 γ^2 =5 ω₀^2.

→ γ^2 = (5/2.25 ) ω₀^2.

Simplify 5/2.25 = 5/(9/4 ) =5*(4/9 )=20/9.

So γ^2= (20/9 ) ω₀^2 → γ= (sqrt(20/9 )) ω₀ = (2 sqrt(5))/3 ω₀.

Hmm, but I don't know ω₀. This approach is leading me to a dead end because I can't relate γ to the given options without knowing ω₀.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake and should instead think in terms of the damping ratio ζ. Since ζ is gamma/(2 ω₀ ), and I can express gamma in terms of ω₀ and ζ.

But without knowing ω₀, perhaps I'm stuck. Perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mass and spring constant and assume that the natural frequency is 1 rad/s, but that seems like a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to relate the damping ratio ζ to the ratio of the periods, and then compute gamma from that.

From earlier, we found that ζ = sqrt(5)/3 ≈0.745.

But then, without knowing ω₀, I can't compute gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the ratio of the periods T_d / T_0 = 1.5, and to express it in terms of ζ, and then compute gamma in terms of ζ, but without any other parameters, perhaps the answer is supposed to be in terms of the damping ratio, but given the options, perhaps it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it from the equation of motion.

The equation is u'' + gamma u' + u =0.

The characteristic equation is r² + gamma r +1=0.

The roots are r = [-gamma ± sqrt(gamma² -4 ) ]/2.

So the roots are real when gamma² >4, and complex when gamma² <4.

But for underdamped motion, gamma must be less than 2 (since the discriminant sqrt(gamma^2-4) is imaginary only if gamma^2 <4.

So for the motion to be underdamped, gamma must be less than 2.

So perhaps the problem is intended to find gamma in terms of the damping ratio, but given that, perhaps an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the formula for the quasi-period of the damped oscillator, which is T_d = T0 * (1/(2 sqrt(1 - ζ² )) ).

Wait, that's a formula I might remember. Let me check it:

If T_d is the damped period, and T0 is the undamped period, then T_d = T0 / (2 sqrt(1 - ζ² )).

Wait, but earlier I found that T_d / T0 = 1/sqrt(1 - ζ² ), which is equal to 1/(2 sqrt(1 - ζ² )) only if 2 sqrt(1 - ζ² )=1, which would imply sqrt(1 - ζ² )=0.5, which would require 1 - ζ² = 0.25 → ζ²=0.75 → ζ= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, which is more than the maximum damping ratio possible (which is 1 for critical damping). So that approach can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps another formula. Let me refer to the formula for the quasi-period.

The quasi-period of damped oscillator is given by T_d = T0 / (2 sqrt(1 - ζ² )).

But I'm not confident about this. Let me think again: from earlier, I have T_d / T0 = 1/sqrt(1 - ζ² )

So T_d = T0 / sqrt(1 - ζ² )

Which would imply T_d = T0 * (1/sqrt(1 - ζ² )).

But since the problem states that T_d = 1.5 T0, then:

(1/sqrt(1 - ζ² )) =1.5 → sqrt(1 - ζ² )=1/1.5=2/3 → 1 - ζ²=4/9 → ζ²=5/9 → ζ=√(5)/3≈0.745.

But then, how to find gamma in terms of ζ and ω0.

Wait, because gamma= ζ * 2 ω0.

But I don't know ω0.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the given options match when considering that the natural frequency is 1 rad/s. So let's assume ω0=1.

Then gamma= 2 * √(5)/3 *1 ≈ 2 * 2.236 /3 ≈ 4.472 /3 ≈1.490.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.490.

Hmm, but the options are:

A:1.224

B:1.333

C:1.414

D:1.490

E:1.612

So option D is 1.490, which is very close to 1.49.

But perhaps the assumption that ω0=1 is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is u'' + gamma u' + u=0, and perhaps the natural frequency is omega_0=1.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the problem is intended to find gamma in terms of the given options, without needing to know ω0.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to take the given options and find which one satisfies the condition that the quasi-period is 50% greater than the natural period.

Wait, but without knowing ω0, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the damping coefficient related to the given options through the damping ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct approach is to use the given options and find which gamma satisfies the condition.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to express gamma in terms of the given options, considering that T_d =1.5 T0.

Given that, and that the damping ratio is sqrt(5)/3 ≈0.745, and gamma= 2 * ζ * ω0.

If I assume that ω0=1, then gamma= 2 * 0.745 ≈1.490, which is option D.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the natural frequency is not 1, but the given options are based on the damping ratio and ω0. So perhaps the correct formula is that gamma= sqrt(5) * sqrt( ω0^2 ) /3 * 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think once again: from earlier, we found that ζ= sqrt(5)/3≈0.745.

So, gamma= 2 * ζ * ω0.

If I assume that ω0=1, then gamma= 2 * 0.745=1.490.

Which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the given options match, so the correct answer is D:1.490.

Thus, after this lengthy thinking process, I conclude that the correct value of gamma is approximately 1.490, which corresponds to option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the quasi-period \( T_d \) and the natural period \( T_0 \) of the damped harmonic oscillator. The given equation is \( u'' + \gamma u' + u = 0 \), where \( \gamma \) is the damping coefficient. The quasi-period \( T_d \) is stated to be 50% greater than \( T_0 \), so \( T_d = 1.5 T_0 \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Damped Period Relation**:  
   For an underdamped oscillator, the quasi-period \( T_d \) is related to the natural period \( T_0 \) by:  
   \[
   \frac{T_d}{T_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}}
   \]  
   where \( \zeta \) is the damping ratio, defined as \( \zeta = \frac{\gamma}{2\omega_0} \).

2. **Given Ratio**:  
   We are given \( T_d = 1.5 T_0 \), so:  
   \[
   \frac{T_d}{T_0} = 1.5 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}}
   \]  

3. **Solve for \( \zeta \)**:  
   Taking the reciprocal:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2} = \frac{1}{1.5} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \zeta^2 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}
   \]  
   Solving for \( \zeta^2 \):  
   \[
   \zeta^2 = 1 - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{5}{9}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \zeta = \sqrt{\frac{5}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \approx 0.745
   \]

4. **Relate \( \zeta \) to \( \gamma \)**:  
   Using \( \zeta = \frac{\gamma}{2\omega_0} \), solve for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 2\zeta\omega_0
   \]  

5. **Assume \( \omega_0 = 1 \)**:  
   If we assume \( \omega_0 = 1 \) (since the problem does not provide specific values for mass or spring constant), then:  
   \[
   \gamma = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \cdot 1 = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3} \approx 1.490
   \]

6. **Match with Options**:  
   The value \( \gamma \approx 1.490 \) corresponds to option D.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
