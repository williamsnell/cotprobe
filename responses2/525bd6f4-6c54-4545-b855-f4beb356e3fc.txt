Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 3^(x – 3) + 10 = 19. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit nervous because exponents can be tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I think I need to isolate the exponential part. So, I'll subtract 10 from both sides to get rid of that constant term. Let's do that: 3^(x – 3) = 19 – 10, which simplifies to 9. So now the equation is 3^(x – 3) = 9.

Wait, 9 is a power of 3. Oh right, 3 squared is 9. So maybe I can rewrite 9 as 3². That would make the equation 3^(x – 3) = 3². Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So x – 3 must equal 2.

Now, solving for x, I just add 3 to both sides: x = 2 + 3, which is 5. So x equals 5. Let me check the options. Looking back, option H is 5. That should be the answer.

The equation is solved by isolating the exponential term. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 3^(x – 3) = 9. Recognizing that 9 is 3 squared, we set the exponents equal: x – 3 = 2. Solving for x gives x = 5. 

Answer: H
