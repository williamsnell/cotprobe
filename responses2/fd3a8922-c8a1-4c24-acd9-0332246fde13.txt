Question:

A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because, she says, "I'm burning up." Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use. Physical examination discloses a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. An expected physical finding will be which of the following?

Options:

A: Decreased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
B: Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
C: Increased intensity of S1
D: Decreased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
E: Positive JVP (rise in jugular venous pulse) with expiration
F: No change in the intensity of the murmur with breathing changes
G: Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
H: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
I: Negative Kussmaul sign (no rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
J: Decreased intensity of S1

Okay, so I'm looking at this medical question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a 19-year-old woman presenting with a burning in her chest. She mentions she's burning up, so that's probably a palpable issue. The medical history is significant for IV drug use, so she's been taking some medications for a while. 

The physical exam shows a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. Systolic murmur usually comes from the heart muscle, right? Systolic is the pressure wave, which can be quite loud. The precordium is a part of the heart, probably related to the Echocardiogram. 

Now, the question is asking about the expected physical findingâ€”what's the expected change in the intensity of the murmur based on her breathing changes. The options are A to J. 

I remember that during the exam, especially in an ECG or echocardiogram, certain signs or changes can indicate her condition. The Kussmaul sign is something I've heard about. Wait, Kussmaul's sign is when the jugular venous pulse increases with inspiration, which can be an early sign of certain heart issues, like aorto-chemically induced contractions. So that's a positive sign for a heart condition.

Looking at the options, option G says "Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)." That sounds like a possible answer. But wait, the question is about the expected physical finding when she has a heart murmur. So maybe the murmur is a reflection of her condition, and the Kussmaul is an additional finding.

Another point to consider: the burrus sign is when the heart murmur increases with inspiration, but that's more about the shape of the murmur. However, the question is about the intensity of the murmur, not its shape.

So, if she has a heart murmur, and during the exam, the intensity is changing with breathing, what's the expected result? If it's related to the Kussmaul, the intensity would increase with inspiration. But the question is about the expected physical finding after her burn-up, which is high in intensity.

Wait, the question is about the expected change in the intensity. So if her heart murmur is expected to be more intense when she breathes more deeply, like during deep inspiration, that would correspond with option H: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration. 

But wait, another thought. I remember that a burning up might be a sign of a condition like aorto-chemicase-induced contractions. The Kussmaul sign is when the jugular venous pulse increases with inspiration, which is a sign of a heart condition. However, that's a separate finding from the heart murmur.

So, if the patient has a heart murmur, which is an early sign of a heart issue, perhaps the Kussmaul is an independent finding. But the question is about the expected physical finding when she is presenting. So during the exam, if she has a heart murmur, the expected change in intensity when she breathes deeply is that the intensity increases with deep inspiration. That would be option H.

But wait, another consideration: the Kussmaul sign is more about the jugular venous pulse. So when that's positive, the intensity of the heart murmur might increase. But the question is about the expected physical finding. So during the exam, the Kussmaul would be a finding, but the question is asking about the intensity change based on breathing.

Alternatively, if the patient has a heart murmur, and during the exam, the intensity is expected to increase with inspiration (deep breathing), that would be option H. But I'm a bit confused because the Kussmaul is a separate finding.

Alternatively, if the patient's heart murmur is due to a condition that causes the intensity to rise with inspiration, that would be an independent finding. But the question is about the expected physical finding after her burn-up. So perhaps the expected change is that the intensity increases with deep inspiration, leading to an increased intensity. 

Wait, another point: the question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer must end with a letter. 

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: Decreased intensity with deep inspir

B: Increased with forced expiration

C: Increased S1

D: Decreased with forced expiration

E: Positive JVP with expiration

F: No change

G: Positive Kussmaul with inspiration

H: Increased with deep inspir

J: Decreased in JVP with expiration.

So, the question is about expected physical changes. The Kussmaul is about the jugular venous pulse, not the heart murmur. The heart murmur's intensity could increase with inspiration because it's a reflecting of the heart's condition. 

But the question is about the expected physical finding. So during the exam, if the patient's heart murmur is found, and the intensity is expected to increase when she breathes deeply (deep inspiration), that would be option H. 

Alternatively, if it's a Kussmaul, that would be a separate finding. But the question is about the expected physical finding that would occur in the exam.

So the correct answer would be H: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration.

The patient is a 19-year-old woman presenting with a burning in her chest, likely due to a high-intensity heart murmur. The medical history includes significant intravenous drug use. The physical exam reveals a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. 

The question asks for the expected physical finding based on her breathing changes. The Kussmaul sign involves an increase in the jugular venous pulse with inspiration, which could be a separate finding from the heart murmur. However, the question focuses on the expected physical change in the intensity of the heart murmur. 

The expected change in the intensity of the heart murmur is an increase with deep inspiration, as this reflects the heart's condition.
