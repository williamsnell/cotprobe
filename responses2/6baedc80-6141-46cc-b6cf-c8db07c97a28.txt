During her testimony, the victim recounted the incident and described how the defendant savagely beat her with a baseball bat. She was not asked by the prosecution whether she made any statements during the attack. After the victim was excused and left the witness stand, the prosecution called another witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this. "Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's proffered testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a statement of then existing condition.
B: inadmissible, because it is a statement of opinion rather than fact.

D: inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused.
E: admissible as a present sense impression.
F: inadmissible because the witness was not present during the attack.

I: admissible as a statement against interest.

Answer:

Okay, let me try to work through this case. The question is about hearsay and admissibility of statements under various exceptions. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the scenario is a defendant on trial for attempted murder. The prosecution called the victim, and she explained that the defendant beat her with a baseball bat. The victim wasn't directly questioned about this, and when she left, the prosecution called another witness. This new witness says that when the attack stopped, she screamed, "I'm dying." The defendant's attorney objects, and the witness is asked whether their testimony is admissible.

I remember that hearsay is when someone makes an out-of-court statement and it's not admitted as evidence unless there's an exception. The exceptions include things like statement of fact, statement of opinion, statement of condition, excited utterance, and statement against interest.

Looking at the witness's testimony: They're saying she screamed in fear, "I'm dying." That's a statement of the present condition. So, a statement of fact. Wait, but is that correct? Because the victim was just being described, not making a statement. So maybe she wasn't making a statement but rather the sound of her screaming.

Wait, no, she was describing the event, but the actual statement is the scream. So the statement is about the scream, which is a present condition. So the statement is fact. So that's a statement of fact.

But wait, the defense of the statement of fact is that it's made under oath and is offered to show that the statement can be true. But in this case, the defendant's attorney is objecting when the witness testifies. So the witness's testimony isn't about the defendant's making the statement but about the victim's screaming. So the witness's statement is not under oath; they're just stating the event. So that's a statement of present condition, but not under oath.

Wait, but in the scenario, the victim was called by the prosecution to testify but wasn't questioned. So the prosecution didn't get an opportunity to testify about what happened. The witness is now testifying about what happened, but they're not under oath. So the statement isn't an oath statement.

Now, can a statement be made as a present sense impression? Or is it a statement of the fact? I think a statement of the fact would require that it's under oath. So if the statement is not under oath, can it be made as a present sense impression?

Wait, the present sense impression exception is when the statement is made at a time when the witness wasn't present, and the statement is an excited utterance. So in this case, the witness is excused, which might mean they were present but not asked. Or no, the problem says the victim was called but not questioned. So she was present but not called by the witness. Wait, no, the prosecution called her, but she wasn't asked by the witness. So the witness didn't have the opportunity to speak about her statements.

Wait, but the witness is now testifying. So perhaps the witness is excused and not present to testify, but the witness is testifying about the event that happened when the defendant was present.

Wait, the initial situation: the defendant is on trial. The prosecution called the victim. The victim's testimony was that the defendant beat her with a bat, and she was not questioned. Then, after excused, the witness testifies. The witness says she was screaming and that she died.

So the witness is testifying about her own statement, not about her testimony. So her statement is about the event, not an out-of-court statement. So is she making a statement of the present condition?

I think so, because she's describing the event as it occurred. So the statement is a present sense impression. But wait, the present sense impression exception applies when the statement is made during an excused excused excused (i.e., when the witness is excused and not present) and it's a statement of the present condition.

Wait, but in this scenario, the witness is excused, so they weren't present when the attack happened. Oh wait no, the defendant's attorney objects when the witness testifies. So perhaps the witness is not present during the attack but is excused, but they're testifying about the attack. 

Alternatively, the statement is made by the victim during her testimony, but she wasn't questioned, so her statement was made at her own testimony, but the witness is testifying about it.

Let me think about the exception for excited utterance. The excited utterance exception applies when the statement is made during an excused excused excused situation, which is when the witness is not present, and the statement is an excited utterance. But here, the witness is excused but not present. So their statement would not be an excited utterance.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap: The defense is considering whether the statement is admissible. The question is whether the statement is a statement of fact, statement of opinion, etc.

The key here is whether the statement was made under oath. The witness is testifying about what happened. If the statement was made under oath, then it's inadmissible unless it's an exception. But the statement isn't under oath; the witness is just testifying about the events. So the statement is a fact statement.

But the fact statement requires that it's under oath. If it's not, then it's not admissible as a statement of fact unless it meets another exception.

Wait, but in some cases, the statement can be made as a statement of the present condition. So the statement is about the present condition (scream), and the statement is made by the victim. Since the victim isn't under oath, but she's testifying about the present condition, then it's a statement of the present condition. But under what exception?

Wait, the present sense impression exception is used when the statement is made during an excused excused excused situation (so the witness isn't present) and the statement is an excited utterance. But in this case, the statement isn't an excited utterance. An excited utterance is when the statement is made during an excused excused excused situation and the statement is an excited utterance of the defendant. 

Wait, but the statement in question is not an excited utterance, it's a scream, which is an out-of-court statement. So the statement is about the present condition. So that would make it a statement of the present condition, but unless there's an exception, that's not admissible.

Wait, but in some cases, when a statement is made about the present condition and it's not under oath, it can be admissible as a statement of the present condition, but that's not an exception. Alternatively, the present sense impression exception is when the statement is made during an excused excused excused situation and is an excited utterance. 

Wait, but in this case, the statement is made by the victim during her testimony, but the witness is testifying about it. So it's a present sense impression. But that's only possible if the statement is made during an excused excused excused situation. But the witness is excused, so they're not present. So the statement is made by the victim, who was present (since the prosecution called her, but she wasn't asked by the witness), during her testimony. So her statement is made during a situation where she wasn't questioned, but the witness is testifying about her statement.

In this scenario, the statement is a present sense impression, but only if the statement was made during an excused excused excused situation, which isn't the case here. Because the witness is excused but not present, so the statement is made at the witness's testimony, not at an excused excused situation.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. The statement is made by the victim during her testimony, but the witness is testifying about that statement. So the statement is a present sense impression only if the statement was made during an excused excused excused situation. But in this case, the witness is excused and not present. So the statement isn't an excited utterance but is a statement of present condition.

Wait, but in that case, the statement would be a statement of the present condition, but is it under oath? If the victim wasn't under oath when she testified, then the statement isn't admissible unless there's another exception.

Wait, another thought: the defendant's attorney is objecting to the witness's statement. The witness is testifying about the statement, but that statement was made by the victim, not the defendant. So the witness is testifying about a statement that's not under oath, but the statement is a present sense impression.

Wait, but the present sense impression exception requires that the statement was made during an excused excused excused situation, which isn't the case here. Because the witness is excused but not present. So the statement is not an excited utterance, so the present sense impression exception doesn't apply.

Wait, but the present sense impression exception is also about being excused. The statement being made during an excused situation (even if the witness is excused) doesn't necessarily make it a present sense impression. It's the situation where the statement is made during an excused excused situation that matters. If the statement is made during an excused situation but not the witness is excused, it's not an excited utterance.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options.

The options given are:

H: admissible as a statement against interest.

Wait, no, statement against interest is when the statement is made for a reason other than to show that the defendant acted inadulately. So if the victim's statement is about something she didn't do, that's a statement against interest. But in this case, the statement is about the victim's screaming, which was a result of the attack, not an act of violence. So I think it's a statement of fact, not an statement against interest.

Option B says inadmissible because it's a statement of opinion rather than fact. But the statement is a fact; the victim was screaming, so it's a statement of fact, not an opinion. So B is incorrect.

Option A: admissible as statement of then existing condition. That's a statement of the present condition, which is allowed if made under oath. But the statement isn't under oath, so A is inadmissible unless there's an exception.

Option C: inadmissible because she didn't make the statement under oath. That's correct because the statement is about the screaming, not the attack. So the statement isn't under oath, so it can't be admissible under that exception.

Option D: inadmissible because she was not questioned about the statement. But the defendant's attorney is objecting. So the witness is testifying about the statement. So D is about the witness, not the statement.

Option E: excited utterance. No, because it's not an excited utterance.

Option F: inadmissible because the witness wasn't present. But the witness was testifying about the event, not about the testimony. The witness was excused, so they weren't present, but that's a different issue. The statement was made by the victim, so E is about the statement, not the witness.

Option G: excited utterance. No, same as E.

Option I: statement against interest. No, because the statement is about the victim's scream, which is a result of the attack, not an act.

So the only correct reasoning is that the statement was made by the victim and is a present sense impression, but since the statement wasn't made under oath, it's inadmissible under that exception. Alternatively, if it's a statement of the present condition, but not under oath, it's not admissible unless another exception applies.

Wait, but the present sense impression exception requires the statement to be made during an excused excused excused situation. In this case, the witness is excused but not present. So their statement is made during the attack, but it's not during an excused situation. So the statement isn't an excited utterance.

Thus, the correct answer would be that the statement is admissible as a statement of the present condition but only if it's under oath. Since it's not under oath, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but then looking back at the options, the correct reasoning is that the statement was made under oath, making it inadmissible. But in this case, it wasn't under oath. So the correct answer is that it's inadmissible as a statement of fact and not under oath, so the statement is inadmissible.

Wait, but the question is about whether the statement is admissible. The statement is a present sense impression, which is an exception under the present sense impression exception only if made during an excused excused excused situation. Here, the witness is excused but not present, so the statement isn't made during such a situation. Hence, the statement is not admissible under that exception.

So the correct answer is that the statement is inadmissible because the witness's testimony was made under oath, but no, that's not the case. Wait, the witness is testifying about the statement, which was made by the victim under no oath.

Wait, but the statement is made by the victim, who wasn't under oath when she testified. So unless there's another exception, the statement is not admissible.

Alternatively, the statement can be made as a statement of the present condition without being under oath, but I think that's not allowed. 

Wait, no, the statement of present condition can be made without being under oath, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Statement of fact: if made under oath, you can't use it unless it's an exception. But if it's made under no oath but is a present sense impression, then it's inadmissible because the statement of fact requires being under oath.

Wait, but the present sense impression exception requires that the statement is made during an excused excused excused situation, which is when the witness is not present. So in this case, since the witness is excused and not present, the statement isn't made during an excused situation. Therefore, the statement isn't admissible as a present sense impression and is thus inadmissible.

Wait, but the present sense impression exception is a separate exception. So in this case, the statement cannot be used as a present sense impression because the statement was made when the witness was not present. So the statement is inadmissible.

Therefore, the correct answer is H: inadmissible as a statement not within any recognized exception.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. The situation is that the victim testified that when she stopped, she screamed and died. The witness is testifying about that, but not under oath. The statement is a present sense impression only if made under an excited situation.

Wait, the statement is made by the victim, not the defendant. The defendant's attorney is objecting. So the witness is testifying about a statement that was made by the victim, not the defendant. So the statement is not under oath. So the statement is a present sense impression, but the statement can only be made when the statement was made during an excused excused excused situation, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the statement is not admissible.

So the correct answer is H: inadmissible as a statement not within any recognized exception.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says "inadmissible as a statement not within any recognized exception." That would be correct because the statement is a present sense impression, but it's not made during an excused situation. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The defendant is on trial for attempted murder, and the victim testified about the defendant's attack, which resulted in screams and screams. The witness, upon objection by the defendant's attorney, testifies about the victim's screaming. The key issue is whether the witness's testimony is admissible.

The statement in question is a present sense impression, which requires the statement to be made during an excused excused excused situation (i.e., when the witness is not present). In this case, the witness is excused but not present, so the statement is not made during such a situation. Therefore, the present sense impression exception does not apply, and the statement is inadmissible as a statement of the present condition.

The statement is not under oath, which means it cannot be admissible as a statement of fact unless it is within an exception. Since the statement is not made under oath and does not meet the excused excused excused situation requirement, it is inadmissible.

The correct answer is:

**H: inadmissible as a statement not within any recognized exception.**

ANSWER: H
