Question:

What is meant by "fractional reserve" banking?

Options:

A: Fractional reserve banking is the practice where banks lend out a portion of their deposits while keeping a fraction in the form of gold reserves.
B: Fractional reserve banking permits banks to keep a varying reserve ratio depending on the size of the deposit.
C: Fractional reserve banking is when banks are required to keep 100% of their deposits in cash.
D: Fractional reserve banking means that banks keep all of their deposits in cash.
E: Fractional reserve banking refers to the practice of banks lending out all their deposits.
F: Fractional reserve banking is a system where banks are required to keep only a fraction of their deposits in liquid form and can invest the remainder in government bonds only.
G: Fractional reserve banking means that banks keep less than 100% of their deposits in cash, placing the rest in income-earning investments.
H: Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend out exactly 50% of their deposits and requires them to hold the other 50% in reserve.
I: Fractional reserve banking mandates that banks hold a fixed reserve of 20% of their deposits and are free to use the rest without restrictions.
J: Fractional reserve banking is the system in which banks are allowed to issue loans equal to the amount of deposits they have, without maintaining any reserves.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about fractional reserve banking. Hmm. I remember from my economics class that fractional reserve banking is a concept related to how banks handle their deposits. Let me try to recall the details.

Fractional reserve banking refers to a system where banks keep a fraction of their deposits as reserves and lend out the rest. So, the idea is that banks can't keep all their money in the bank, right? They have to keep some in reserve to meet their liabilities. This allows the banks to create money through the process of fractional reserve banking, where the money that people deposit gets lent out, which then can be deposited into other banks, and so on. 

Looking at the options, option A says that fractional reserve banking is where banks lend out a portion of their deposits while keeping a fraction in gold reserves. Wait, does that mean they're keeping some in reserve (like cash or government bonds?) Or is it where they keep a fraction and lend the rest? I think the key is that they keep a fraction in reserve, so they don't keep all of their deposits. So option A is correct in that they keep a portion, not all. 

Option B says the reserve ratio can vary. But fractional reserve banking doesn't permit varying; it's fixed. So B is incorrect. 

Option C: They must keep 100% in cash. No, that's the opposite of fractional reserve. That's the fully deposited-reserve banking. So C is wrong.

Option D: Keep all in cash. That's the opposite of fractional. Definitely wrong.

Option E: Lend all their deposits. No, that's the opposite again. So E is wrong.

Option F: Keep only a fraction in liquid form and invest the rest in government bonds. Wait, but fractional reserve doesn't necessarily require keeping only a portion. It's about keeping a fraction, but they can choose where to keep itâ€”like keeping it in cash or in bonds. So F might not be the correct definition. Or maybe it's a more general term, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Keep less than 100% in cash. That sounds right. The key is that they keep less than 100%, so the rest is lent out. So G is a correct description.

Option H: Lend exactly 50%, which sounds too specific. The reserve rate can vary, but it's a percentage, not 50%. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Have a fixed 20% reserve. Again, it's a percentage, not a fixed amount. So I is wrong.

Option J: Allow lending equal to deposits. That's the opposite of fractional. So J is wrong.

So the correct options are A and G. But wait, let me check the phrasing again. Fractional reserve banking is where banks keep less than 100% of deposits as reserves, so they lend out the rest. So option G says "means that banks keep less than 100% of their deposits in cash, placing the rest in income-earning investments." Yes, that's exactly what fractional reserve is. So G is correct.

Wait, but option F says that they keep only a fraction and invest the rest in bonds. The definition of fractional reserve doesn't require keeping only a portion; it's just that they must keep some, but the rest can be deposited or used for other purposes. So F is a more general term. Or maybe the definition of fractional reserve includes keeping some in reserves, but it's not required to keep only a fraction. 

So, in the options, fractional reserve banking allows banks to keep less than 100% in cash, which they can use for both lending and other purposes. So option G is correct because it states that they keep less than 100% in cash and the rest in investments. 

Therefore, the correct answer is either A or G. Wait, let me re-examine the options again. 

Option A says they keep a portion in gold reserves, which is a specific type of liquid asset. But fractional reserve doesn't have to be in gold; it could be cash or in bonds. So option G is more accurate because it's about keeping less than 100% in cash, but the rest can be in various investments, not necessarily only government bonds. So option G is a better description of fractional reserve than option A. Because option A says the reserve is in gold, which is a specific type of liquid asset, whereas fractional reserve doesn't specify that. Fractional reserve can be held in cash or other forms. 

So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: "Fractional reserve banking means that banks keep less than 100% of their deposits in cash, placing the rest in income-earning investments."

### Explanation:
Fractional reserve banking is a banking system where banks keep a portion of their deposits as reserves and lend out the rest. This allows the money that people deposit into the banking system to be lent out, which can then be deposited into other banks, thereby creating money through the process of fractional reserve banking. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because it specifies that banks keep a portion in gold reserves, which is not required by the concept of fractional reserve banking. 
- **Option G** accurately describes the essence of fractional reserve banking, where banks keep less than 100% of their deposits in cash and use the rest for lending or other purposes, such as income-earning investments.
- Other options either describe incorrect mechanisms (e.g., B, C, D, E, H, I, J) or are too specific or incorrect in their wording.
