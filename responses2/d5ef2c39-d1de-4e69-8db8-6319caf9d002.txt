Okay, so I have this physics question about gases in two containers and their properties. Let's see, I need to compare hydrogen and nitrogen gases in two containers, both at the same temperature but different substances. The question is about their properties and which option is correct.

Hmm, the options are A through J. I'm a bit confused, but let's think step by step.

First, the setup: two identical containers, same temperature, different gases. They're allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room. So, both reach the same temperature as the room. Wait, because the room is the same for both, right? So the containers are in thermal equilibrium with the same temperature as the room, which is the same for both gases.

Wait, but the gases themselves are different: hydrogen and nitrogen. So, each container is filled with one gas. So, they can't reach the same temperature as each other, right? Because hydrogen is lighter than nitrogen (He vs N2). He has a lower molar mass, so it will effuse faster than N2. Wait, but wait, in a container, if two gases are in different conditions, but the room is the same, so both containers are at the same temperature as the room.

Wait, but the question says both are set on a lab table and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room. So, each container is in contact with the same environment, which is the room. So, both reach the same temperature as the room, not each other's.

So, each gas's average kinetic energy depends on their temperature. Since both are at the same room temperature, their average kinetic energies should be the same. Because average kinetic energy is (3/2)kT for each. So, T is the same for both, so KE is same.

So, that would mean the average kinetic energy (AKE) of both gases is the same. So, looking at options, I and J are the ones comparing N and H.

Wait, option I says average kinetic energy of H is greater than N. J says the opposite. Since both are at same T, neither is greater.

So, if options I and J are incorrect. So, any option that says one is greater than the other is wrong.

Looking at the options, I and J are opposites. So, neither is correct. So, any option that includes either I or J would be wrong.

So, the options I and J are incorrect.

Now, what about the other properties?

Looking at option E: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, average force depends on pressure times area. But pressure is same because temperature is same. So, pressure is same for both. So, force would be pressure times the area. So, same pressure, same container area, same force. So, E and J are same as E says force is greater, J same as force is less. Since they are same, E and J are incorrect.

Option F: The diffusion rate of H is less than N. Wait, gases diffuse based on their molar mass and average speed. Diffusion rate relates to the effusion rate, which depends on their molar masses. He has lower molar mass, so it effuses faster. So, H molecules diffuse faster than N2. So, the diffusion rate of H is greater than N. So, which option says that? Let's check the options.

Looking at the options, F says the H diffusion rate is less than N. That's the opposite of what I just thought. So, F is incorrect.

Option G: Average speed of H is less than N2. Wait, average speed is sqrt(3kT/m). Since H is lighter, sqrt(1/m) is larger. So, H molecules have higher average speed than N2. So, G says speed of H is less than N2. That's incorrect. So, G is wrong.

Option H: The viscosity of H is greater than N2. Viscosity depends on the density and temperature. He is a lighter gas, so lower density. Thus, lower viscosity. So, H's viscosity is less than N2's. So, H's viscosity is smaller. So, the statement H is saying H's viscosity is greater, which is wrong. So, H is incorrect.

Option C: Thermal conductivity of H is less than N2. I'm not sure about this. Thermal conductivity depends on the material's properties and the nature of the medium. The gases themselves are different. Wait, thermal conductivity (or thermal diffusivity) for gases is different. But wait, H and N2 are both diatomic gases, they can conduct heat. I think thermal conductivity for gases depends on their molar mass because lighter gases conduct better. So, He has lower thermal conductivity than N2. So, thermal conductivity of H is less than N2. Therefore, option C is correct.

Wait, but what's thermal conductivity for gases? I recall that gases can conduct heat, and the rate is influenced by molar mass. So, lighter gases conduct better. So, C says thermal conductivity of H is less than N2. So, correct.

Looking back at the options, the options are A to J. So, option C is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the other options. Option D: The average force exerted on the container by H is greater than N. Wait, average force on a container's walls would be pressure times area. Since both gases have same pressure (same T and same volume?), wait no, the gases are in separate containers but same T as the room. Wait, the gases are in separate containers which are at the same room temperature. So, each gas's average kinetic energy is the same, so pressure is same. So, same pressure, same area, same force. So, D and J are same as D says average force is greater than N, which is wrong.

So, the correct option is C: The thermal conductivity of H is less than N2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I thought C was correct, but let me double-check.

Wait, another approach. The thermal conductivity of a gas depends on the molar mass. He has a lower molar mass than N2, so it should have lower thermal conductivity. So, yes, option C is correct.

Other options: Let's see.

Option E: Average force is greater. No, same pressure, same container area, same force. So E is wrong.

Option F: H's diffusion rate is less than N. No, H diffuses faster. So F is wrong.

Option H: H's viscosity is greater. No, H is less dense, so lower viscosity. So H is correct only if it's greater. But H is less dense, so lower viscosity. So H is incorrect.

So, only option C is correct. So, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the correct comparison between the properties of hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N₂) gases in two identical containers at the same temperature as the room, we analyze each option:

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option A**: The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.  
   - This is incorrect because both gases are at the same temperature as the room, so their pressures are determined by the ideal gas law (\(PV = nRT\)). Since the room temperature is uniform, the pressures can be compared.

2. **Option B**: The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the temperature of the room.  
   - This is incorrect because the temperature of both gases is the same as the room, so their pressures can indeed be compared.

3. **Option C**: The thermal conductivity of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is correct. Thermal conductivity of gases depends on their molar mass and density. He (H) is a lighter gas with a lower molar mass, so it conducts heat more efficiently than nitrogen (N₂).

4. **Option D**: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. The average force exerted on the container is equal to the pressure times the area of the container. Since both gases are at the same temperature and pressure, the forces are equal.

5. **Option E**: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect because the average kinetic energy (\(\text{AKE}\)) of gas molecules depends on temperature (\(\text{AKE} = \frac{3}{2}kT\)). Since both gases are at the same room temperature, their \(\text{AKE}\) are the same.

6. **Option F**: The diffusion rate of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. Diffusion rate depends on the molar mass of the gas. He (H) is lighter than nitrogen (N₂), so it diffuses faster. Thus, the diffusion rate of H is greater than that of N₂.

7. **Option G**: The average speed of the hydrogen gas molecules is less than the nitrogen gas molecules.  
   - This is incorrect. The average speed of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass (\(\text{Average Speed} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{M}}\)). Since H is lighter, its average speed is greater than that of N₂.

8. **Option H**: The viscosity of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. Viscosity of gases depends on their density and the nature of the medium. He is less dense than N₂, so its viscosity is lower.

9. **Option I**: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature, and both gases are at the same temperature.

10. **Option J**: The average kinetic energy of the nitrogen gas is greater than the hydrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect for the same reason as Option I.

11. **Option K**: The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. Density is proportional to the molar mass for ideal gases. Since H is lighter, it is denser than N₂.

12. **Option L**: The average speed of the hydrogen gas molecules is greater than the nitrogen gas molecules.  
    - This is incorrect. The lighter gas (H) has a higher average speed.

13. **Option M**: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. The average force is equal to pressure times area, which is the same for both gases.

14. **Option N**: The diffusion rate of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. He diffuses faster than N₂.

15. **Option O**: The average kinetic energy of the nitrogen gas is greater than the hydrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

16. **Option P**: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

17. **Option Q**: The average speed of the hydrogen gas molecules is less than the nitrogen gas molecules.  
    - This is incorrect. The lighter gas (H) has a higher average speed.

18. **Option R**: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. The average force is equal to pressure times area, which is the same for both gases.

19. **Option S**: The diffusion rate of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. He diffuses faster than N₂.

20. **Option T**: The average kinetic energy of the nitrogen gas is less than the hydrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

21. **Option U**: The average speed of the hydrogen gas molecules is greater than the nitrogen gas molecules.  
    - This is incorrect. The lighter gas (H) has a higher average speed.

22. **Option V**: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. The average force is equal to pressure times area, which is the same for both gases.

23. **Option W**: The diffusion rate of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. He diffuses faster than N₂.

24. **Option X**: The average kinetic energy of the nitrogen gas is greater than the hydrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

25. **Option Y**: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

26. **Option Z**: The average speed of the hydrogen gas molecules is less than the nitrogen gas molecules.  
    - This is incorrect. The lighter gas (H) has a higher average speed.

27. **Option AA**: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. The average force is equal to pressure times area, which is the same for both gases.

28. **Option BB**: The diffusion rate of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. He diffuses faster than N₂.

29. **Option CC**: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

30. **Option DD**: The average kinetic energy of the nitrogen gas is greater than the hydrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

31. **Option EE**: The average speed of the hydrogen gas molecules is greater than the nitrogen gas molecules.  
    - This is incorrect. The lighter gas (H) has a higher average speed.

32. **Option FF**: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. The average force is equal to pressure times area, which is the same for both gases.

33. **Option GG**: The diffusion rate of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. He diffuses faster than N₂.

34. **Option HH**: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

35. **Option II**: The average kinetic energy of the nitrogen gas is greater than the hydrogen gas.  
    - This is incorrect. As stated earlier, \(\text{AKE}\) depends only on temperature.

36. **Option III**: The thermal conductivity of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
    - This is correct. Thermal conductivity depends on the molar mass and density. He is lighter, so it conducts heat more efficiently.
