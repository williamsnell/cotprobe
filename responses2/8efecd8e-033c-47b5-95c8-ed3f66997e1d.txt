Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

There is general consensus among paleoanthropologists that anatomically modern humans:

Options:

A: migrated out of Africa into Southwest Asia between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago and then spread into Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas.
B: evolved in Asia between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, and then migrated into Africa, Europe, Australia, and the Americas.
C: migrated out of Asia into Africa between 200,000 and 150,000 years ago and then spread into Europe, Australia, and the Americas.
D: evolved in Africa between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, and then migrated into Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas.
E: migrated out of Africa into Asia between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago and then spread into Europe, Australia, and the Americas.
F: migrated out of Africa into western Europe between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and then spread into Asia, Australia, and the Americas.
G: evolved independently in Africa, Europe, and Asia between 200,000 and 150,000 years ago and then migrated into Australia and the Americas.
H: evolved in Europe between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago and then migrated into Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas.
I: migrated out of Africa into North America between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago and then spread into Europe, Asia, and Australia.
J: evolved independently and simultaneously in Africa, Europe, and Asia and then migrated into Australia and the Americas.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this paleoanthropology question. Let's read it carefully. The question is about the last character of the response, which is the letter chosen. The options are A to J. The question is about anatomically modern humans and their evolutionary history.

So, the options are about when humans migrated into different areas and when they evolved. I remember that modern humans evolved around 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. People from Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia all contributed to this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Migration out of Africa into SW Asia, then spread to Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. That sounds right because I think the migration into South Asia happened around 150,000 or so, and then expanded into other areas around 100,000 years ago.

Option B: Evolved in Asia 100,000-50k, then migrated into Africa, Europe, etc. Wait, that's the opposite of what I remember. I think the migration into Africa happened much later, maybe around 150k? Because there are studies showing that humans in Africa (like in the present-day) evolved around 100k to 50k years ago, and then they started moving into other areas.

Option C: Migrated out of Asia into Africa between 200k and 150k, then spread into Europe, etc. No, that doesn't make sense because I don't think the migration from Asia to Africa happened that late. The migration into Africa was much earlier, like 100k years ago.

Option D: Evolved in Africa, then migrated into Europe, Asia, etc. But the question is about the last character of the response. The question is about anatomically modern humans, so their last character would be the letter corresponding to the correct answer.

Wait, the question is asking for the last character of the answer. So, the options are letters, but the user is asking for the letter to choose for the answer. So, the answer is one of the letters A-J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, the options are A to J, each is a letter, but the question is about the last character of the answer. So, the correct option's letter is the last character of the answer. So, the answer is the letter corresponding to the correct statement.

Wait, the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, after selecting the correct option (which is letter X), the answer is X.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is a multiple-choice with options A-J, each being a letter. The correct answer is one of these letters. So, the user's task is to select the correct letter as the last character of the answer. So, the correct answer is the letter that corresponds to the correct statement.

So, the question is asking which statement is correct about the anatomically modern humans.

So, I need to figure out which option is correct.

Option A: Migration out of Africa into SW Asia (like, say, 150k years ago), and then spread into Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. That sounds right.

Option B: Evolved in Asia 100-50k, then migrated into Africa. That doesn't fit because the migration into Africa was much earlier, around 150k years ago.

Option E: Migrated out of Africa into Asia (100-50k), then spread into Europe, etc. That also seems correct, but I think the migration into Asia was more recent.

Wait, I think I should recall the timeline. The modern humans evolved around 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. They then spread into Europe, Asia, Australia, and parts of North America. One of the big migrations by humans was from Africa into the Americas around 100k to 50k years ago. Another was moving into Asia, which happened around the same time or earlier.

Wait, another point: the question is about the last character of the answer. So the correct answer is the letter corresponding to the correct option, which is the answer letter.

Now, let's think about the correct statement. The correct one is that humans evolved between 100k and 50k years ago, then migrated into Asia, Europe, etc. Looking at the options, which of these fit.

Looking at Option E: "migrated out of Africa into Asia between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago and then spread into Europe, Australia, and the Americas." That sounds correct. Because the migration into Asia happened around that time, and then they spread.

But wait, another option says, Option E: Migrated out of Africa into Asia (100k-50k) and then spread into Europe, Australia, and the Americas. That seems correct.

Wait, another option is H: evolved in Europe between 150k and 100k years ago, then migrated into Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. But that's the opposite; the modern humans evolved after the migration into Africa, not before.

So the correct answer should be option E: migrating out of Africa into Asia around 100-50k, then to Europe, Australia, etc.

Looking back, the question is about the last character of the answer. So, the correct letter is E's letter, which is 'E'. So, the answer is E.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the evolutionary timeline of modern humans. They evolved between 100,000 to 50,000 years ago and then migrated into various regions. Among the options, Option E correctly describes this timeline: humans migrated out of Africa into Asia between the specified time and then spread into Europe, Australia, and the Americas. 

Answer: E
