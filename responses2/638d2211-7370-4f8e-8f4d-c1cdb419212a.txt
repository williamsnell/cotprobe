Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about two statements related to different metrics and models. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question has two statements. Statement 1 says that the BLEU metric uses precision, while the ROGUE metric uses recall. I remember that BLEU stands for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy. From what I recall, BLEU is a metric used to evaluate how well a model's outputs match the ground truth. I think it's based on the number of common words in all the models' outputs. Wait, but I'm not sure if it uses precision or recall. Let me think. Oh right, I think that's correct because precision is about how many correct positives you have, and recall is about how many actual positives you capture. But I'm a bit hazy on the details here. Maybe I should double-check. I think that BLEU primarily uses precision, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another metric. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. I think the ROGUE metric was introduced by Mathieu et al., and I believe it's a modified version of BLEU. Wait, no, ROGUE stands for Repeated Operator of Unsupervised Grammars Evaluation. So, perhaps I'm mixing up the uses. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Oh, I think that the original BLEU doesn't use precision and recall. Wait, no, I think that's the case for another metric. Oh wait, wait! I'm getting confused. Let's try to find a better way. Maybe I should think about the definitions. Precision is the ratio of correctly identified positive items to the total number of items identified as positive. Recall is the ratio of correctly identified positive items to the total number of actual positive items. So, if both metrics were based on these, then statement 1 is correct. But wait, if both use similar methods, but I'm not sure if they're the same. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct in stating that BLEU uses precision and ROGUE uses recall. Hmm, perhaps I should move on to statement 2 and see if that gives me any clues.

Statement 2 says that Hidden Markov Models were frequently used to model English sentences. Hmm, I'm not very familiar with HMAs, but I recall that HMMs are a type of probabilistic model often used in speech recognition, especially for speech synthesis. Wait, but do they model English sentences? Well, I think HMAs are more about capturing the structure of sequences, like in speech, but for written English, maybe other models are more common. I'm not sure. I think that HMAs are more about modeling the transitions between words, but I'm not certain if they're commonly used for modeling entire sentences. Alternatively, perhaps HMAs are used in some models for language modeling. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should proceed to the answer options and see which fit.

Now, looking at the answer options, which are labeled A to J. The question is asking whether each statement is "mostly true", "mostly false", or if it's "Cannot be determined" or "False, True", etc. 

First, let's tackle statement 1: Does BLEU use precision and ROGUE use recall? I'm not entirely sure about this. I think that the ROGUE metric uses a different approach, perhaps considering more than just the top-k matches, which might involve some kind of scoring and then computing the average. But I'm not clear on whether it uses precision and recall. Alternatively, perhaps both use similar methods but with different parameters. Or maybe one is a variation of the other. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps both use a different metric. Wait, I'm not certain, but I think the question is trying to trick me. I think statement 1 is incorrect. Because I believe that both BLEU and ROGUE are based on the number of matches, but perhaps they use a different approach. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up. Wait, I think that the ROGUE metric is based on a different scoring function than BLEU. So statement 1 is incorrect because ROGUE uses a different metric than BLEU. So statement 1 is false.

Then statement 2: does HMMs model English sentences frequently? I'm not sure. I think HMAs are more about capturing word transitions, but for modeling full sentences, perhaps other models like RNNs (like LSTM) are more commonly used. Or maybe not. Alternatively, I think that HMAs are more common for speech processing than for written language modeling. So the statement would be false because I don't think HMAs are frequently used for modeling English sentences. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps HMAs are more used in other contexts, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. Examples: HMAs are used in speech recognition for phone recognition, right? So for speech, yes. But for written English, perhaps other models are more prevalent. I'm not certain, but I think statement 2 is false because HMAs are not commonly used for modeling English sentences.

But now I'm confused because my initial thought is that statement 1 is incorrect, statement 2 is incorrect. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the first option for statement 1 is "False", and statement 2 is "False". So the combination would be F, F. But let me verify again.

Wait, perhaps statement 1 is correct. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think again. The question says statement 1: BLEU uses precision, ROGUE uses recall. Does that mean that for the same evaluation, both metrics use similar methods but different aspects. But I'm not sure which metric uses which. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct because both metrics use a similar approach but with different parameters. Wait, no, I'm not confident. I think that the original question may have statement 1 correct or incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to say that both use similar methods but in different ways. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think that the question may have statement 1 correct. Because I've read that the ROGUE metric is a modification of the BLEU metric, but I'm not sure if it uses the same underlying principles. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect in stating that both use a specific method (precision and recall). I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps statement 1 is correct. Let's suppose statement 1 is correct. Then statement 2: Does HMAs model sentences often? I think it's more common in speech processing. So statement 2 is false.

If statement 1 is correct and statement 2 is false, then the answer would be F, F. Let me look at the options. Option F is True, True. Option H is False, False. Option G is False, True. So if statement 1 is correct and statement 2 is incorrect, the answer would be F, F, which is option H? Wait, no. Wait, the options are labeled A to J, not H. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Mostly True, Mostly False

B: Mostly False, Mostly True

C: False, True

D: False, Cannot be determined

E: Cannot be determined, False

F: True, True

G: Cannot be determined, True

H: False, False

I: True, Cannot be determined

J: True, False

Wait, so if both statements are false, the answer is H. But earlier I thought statement 1 might be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about statement 1. Let me think again. The question says statement 1 is correct or incorrect.

Statement 1: BLEU uses precision, ROGUE uses recall.

If both use similar methods but with different parameters, maybe the statement is correct. Like, both use a similar metric but have different aspects (like, ROGUE is more data-efficient or something). So statement 1 is correct.

Then, statement 2: HMAs are used to model English sentences frequently.

I think HMAs are more about modeling word transitions, but not sentences as a whole. So statement 2 is false.

So if statement 1 is correct (True) and statement 2 is false (False), the combination is True, False, which is option J.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement 1 was incorrect. So if I'm now reasoning statement 1 as correct, the answer would be J.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: True, True.

Alternatively, perhaps statement 1 is correct. Let me think again about the definitions.

Wait, I think that the original BLEU uses precision and recall is incorrect. I think that both use similar metrics but with different parameters. For example, precision and recall are different aspects of a retrieval process. So statement 1 is correct. So the first part is True.

Then statement 2: HMAs are frequently used to model English sentences. I think HMAs are not used for that. So statement 2 is False. So the answer would be J: True, False.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of another approach. Let me try to recall if there's any information I can find.

Upon reflection, I'm not certain about statement 1's correctness. I think the question is trying to test knowledge about the metrics. So, perhaps statement 1 is correct because both metrics use similar aspects of evaluation, but with different parameters. Or perhaps statement 1 is incorrect because the question uses "uses" which implies that the metric uses one method and the other uses the other. For example, perhaps both use a different scoring function but in a similar way.

Alternatively, perhaps both metrics are based on the same underlying principles but with different parameters. So statement 1 is correct. Then, statement 2: HMAs are not commonly used for modeling entire sentences, so it's false.

If that's the case, the answer would be True, False, which is option J.

Alternatively, maybe statement 1 is incorrect. If the question is correct, then perhaps statement 1 is correct, and statement 2 is incorrect.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that HMAs are not commonly used for modeling entire sentences but are more for speech. So statement 2 is false.

But let me think about the options again. For statement 1, if the question is correct, then it would be True. Statement 2 is false.

So the options:

If statement 1 is True and statement 2 is False, the correct answer would be J: True, False.

Alternatively, if statement 1 is incorrect, then both statements are false. So the correct answer would be F: True, True.

But I'm not certain about statement 1. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and statement 1 is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is J: True, False.

But I'm a bit uncertain. Wait, perhaps I should think about the examples. For example, in the context of natural language processing, which metric is used more often. I think that BLEU does use precision, and ROGUE uses recall. Or is that incorrect? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps statement 1's correctness depends on the definition. If both metrics use the same evaluation framework but with different aspects (like, one using a different scoring function), then statement 1 is correct. But I think that's not the case. So perhaps statement 1 is incorrect.

So, if statement 1 is incorrect, then both statements are false. So the correct answer would be F: True, True.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the BLEU metric uses a different method than ROGUE, so statement 1 is incorrect. So both statements are false.

So the correct answer would be F: True, True.

But I'm still a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should go with what I think is correct.

Wait, I think that both the BLEU and ROGUE metrics are based on the same evaluation framework but with different scoring functions. So statement 1 is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer would be J: True, False.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and statement 1 is incorrect.

Wait, another angle: Maybe statement 1 is incorrect because both use the same evaluation framework but with different parameters. So statement 1 is true.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll proceed to make a decision based on the options. If statement 1 is correct, then the answer is J. If not, F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that statement 1 is incorrect, and statement 2 is correct. But I don't think HMAs are frequently used for modeling sentences.

So I think statement 1 is correct, and statement 2 is false. So the answer is J.

Wait, but the question is about whether the statements are "mostly" true, etc. So if statement 1 is correct (True) and statement 2 is false (False), then the combination is True, False, which is option J.
</think>

The question presents two statements about metrics and models and asks whether they are mostly true, mostly false, or if they cannot be determined.

1. **Statement 1**: "The BLEU metric uses precision, while the ROGUE metric uses recall."  
   - After considering the definitions of BLEU and ROGUE, it is concluded that both metrics are based on the same evaluation framework but with different parameters. Therefore, Statement 1 is **correct** (True).

2. **Statement 2**: "Hidden Markov Models were frequently used to model English sentences."  
   - Hidden Markov Models are more commonly used for speech processing than for modeling entire sentences in written English. Thus, Statement 2 is **incorrect** (False).

Given the analysis, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. The correct answer is **J: True, False**.
