Okay, so I've got this question about the maximum efficiency of a steam engine. Hmm, I remember that the efficiency of a heat engine, like a steam engine, is related to the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs. Oh right, there's the Carnot efficiency formula, which I think is the theoretical maximum efficiency.

Wait, the formula is something like (1 - Tc/Th), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir. But wait, the temperatures need to be in Kelvin, right? Because Celsius to Kelvin is adding 273.15.

So the input steam is 175°C. To convert that to Kelvin, I add 273.15. Let me calculate that. 175 + 273.15 would be 448.15 K. The exhaust is 75°C, so that's 75 + 273.15 = 348.15 K.

Wait, but wait. Oh no, wait, the Carnot efficiency is (1 - Tc / Th). So here, Tc is the cold reservoir, which is 75°C. Oh wait, wait a second, no, the input is the hot, the exhaust is the cold. So the formula is (1 - Tc/Th). So in this case, it's (1 - 348.15 / 448.15).

Let me compute that. 348.15 divided by 448.15. Hmm, approximately, 348/448 is about 0.7765. So 1 minus that is about 0.2235, or 22.35% efficiency.

Looking at the options, option G is 22.3%, which matches. So the maximum efficiency here is around 22.3%, so the answer should be G.

The maximum efficiency of a steam engine is determined by the Carnot efficiency formula: 

\[
\text{Efficiency} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}
\]

where \( T_c \) is the temperature of the cold reservoir and \( T_h \) is the temperature of the hot reservoir, both in Kelvin. 

1. Convert the given temperatures to Kelvin:
   - Input steam (hot reservoir): \( 175^\circ C + 273.15 = 448.15 \, \text{K} \)
   - Exhaust temperature (cold reservoir): \( 75^\circ C + 273.15 = 348.15 \, \text{K} \)

2. Plug these values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = 1 - \frac{348.15}{448.15} \approx 1 - 0.7765 = 0.2235
   \]

3. Convert to a percentage: \( 0.2235 \times 100 \approx 22.35\% \).

The closest option to this value is **22.3%**, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
