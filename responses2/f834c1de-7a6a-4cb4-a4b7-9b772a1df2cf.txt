Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about taxi miles. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question says that taxi cabs in a metropolitan area are driven an average of 75,000 miles per year with a standard deviation of 12,000 miles. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. And I have to assume a normal distribution.

Hmm, right. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since it's given that the cab has been driven over 80k miles, I only consider cases where the miles are above 80k. So I think I need to find the probability that the miles are less than 100k given that they're more than 80k.

Wait, but actually, wait. The question is asking for the probability that it's less than 100k, given it's over 80k. So P(X < 100k | X > 80k). So yes, that's a conditional probability.

To solve this, I should calculate the Z-scores for 80k and 100k, and then find the area under the normal curve between those two Z-scores. Wait, no. Wait, the standard approach is to find the probability between the two thresholds. But let's think step by step.

First, compute the Z-score for 80k. The formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ. So for 80k, X is 80,000. μ is 75,000, σ is 12,000. So Z = (80,000 -75,000)/12,000 = 5,000 /12,000 = 5/12 ≈ 0.4167.

Similarly, for 100k, the Z would be (100,000 -75,000)/12,000 = 25,000 /12,000 ≈ 2.0833.

Now, I need to find P(X <100k | X>80k). Wait, but conditional probability. So the probability that X is less than 100k given that it's more than 80k. Alternatively, the probability that X is between 80k and 100k, divided by the probability that X is greater than 80k. Because P(A|B) is P(A and B) / P(B), but in this case, A is X <100k and B is X>80k. So P(A and B) is P(80k < X <100k). So the numerator is the probability that X is between 80k and 100k, and the denominator is the probability that X>80k.

So I need to find the area under the normal curve from 80k to 100k, divided by the area to the right of 80k.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the probabilities and then compute the ratio.

Let me compute the Z-scores first.

For 80k: Z1 = (80,000 -75,000)/12,000 = 5,000/12,000 = 0.4167.

Wait, wait, that's 5/12, which is approximately 0.4167.

For 100k: Z2 = (25,000)/12,000 = 2.0833.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is between 0.4167 and 2.0833.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the area from Z1 to Z2. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the standard normal distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the probabilities for each Z and then compute the ratio.

Wait, another approach: think in terms of the proportion.

So, the probability that X is less than 100k, given that it's greater than 80k.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as P(80k < X <100k) / P(X>80k).

Wait, but since 80k is the lower bound, maybe I can compute both probabilities.

Let me look up the Z-scores and their corresponding probabilities.

First, Z1 is about 0.4167. Let me find the area to the left of Z1. Using a Z-table or calculator.

Looking up Z=0.4167: the area to the left is, say, 0.6615 (since I think 0.4167 is between 0.41 and 0.42. Alternatively, a precise calculation is better. But maybe I can remember that for Z=0.41, the area is about 0.6591, and for Z=0.42, it's 0.6628. So 0.4167 is closer to 0.42, so perhaps 0.6615.

Similarly, for Z2=2.0833: looking that up, the area to the left is about 0.9812. Because I remember that for Z=2, the area is about 0.9772, and for Z=2.08, it's 0.9811. So for Z=2.0833, it's 0.9812.

So, the area between Z1 and Z2 is 0.9812 - 0.6615 = 0.3197.

The denominator is P(X>80k). So since Z1 is 0.4167, the area to the right is 1 - 0.6615 = 0.3385.

So now, the conditional probability is 0.3197 / 0.3385 ≈ 0.945.

Wait, but wait, that's roughly 0.945, which is about 0.95. But looking at the options, I don't see 0.95. The options are A:0.72, B:0.45, C:0.66, D:0.80, E:0.94, F:0.06, G:0.20, H:0.34, I:0.50, J:0.86.

Wait, so 0.945 would round to 0.95, but there's no 0.95 option. The closest option is E:0.94, which is 0.94, which is pretty close. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the Z-scores and the areas.

Z1 is 0.4167. So the area to the left is the probability of being less than that Z. Using a Z-table, for Z=0.41, it's about 0.6591, and for Z=0.42, it's 0.6618. So 0.4167 is 0.4167 - 0.41 = 0.0067 above 0.41. The difference between 0.41 and 0.42 is 0.01, and the area increases from 0.6591 to 0.6618. So 0.0027 per 0.01 Z. So 0.0067 * 0.27 ≈ 0.0018. So 0.6591 + 0.0018 ≈ 0.6609. So approximately 0.6609.

Similarly, Z2=2.0833. Let me find the area to the left. I remember that Z=2.08: area is about 0.9811, and Z=2.09: 0.9813. So 2.0833 is just a bit above 2.08. So the area is about 0.9812.

So the area between Z1 and Z2 is 0.9812 - 0.6609 = 0.3203.

Denominator is 1 - 0.6609 = 0.3391.

So 0.3203 / 0.3391 ≈ 0.948.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.95, but the options don't have 0.95. So the closest is E, 0.94. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making an error in calculations. Let me think again.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use the standard normal distribution's table more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the area between 0.4167 and 2.0833.

Wait, but I'm getting 0.948, which is about 0.95, but none of the options are 0.95. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should compute it using the standard normal distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the conditional probability as:

P(X < 100,000 | X >80,000) = P(80k < X <100k) / P(X>80k).

Wait, because X>80k is the denominator.

We know that P(X>80k) is the area to the right of Z1, which is 1 - 0.6609 = 0.3391.

And P(80k <X <100k) is 0.9812 - 0.6609 = 0.3203.

So 0.3203 / 0.3391 ≈ 0.948, which is approximately 0.95, but the options don't have that. The closest is E:0.94.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I used the correct Z-values. Let me recalculate.

Wait, another approach: maybe instead of computing both Z-scores, I can compute the difference in probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact area.

Wait, let me compute the Z1 and Z2 more accurately.

For Z1=0.4167, using a calculator or more precise method, let's say it's 0.6615. Because 0.4167 is approximately 0.4167, and perhaps using a calculator, the area is 0.6615.

For Z2=2.0833, let's see, the area is 0.9812.

So the area between Z1 and Z2 is 0.9812 - 0.6615 = 0.3197.

The denominator is 1 - 0.6615 = 0.3385.

So 0.3197 / 0.3385 ≈ 0.945.

Hmm, which is approximately 0.95, but again, the option E is 0.94, and perhaps I should check if the options have that.

Wait, but the options don't include 0.95. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the distribution is not standard normal, so maybe I need to use a different approach.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the miles per year are normally distributed. So X ~ N(75000, 12000²). So for X, the mean is 75k, standard deviation 12k.

We need P(X <100k | X>80k).

Which is the same as P(80k <X <100k) / P(X>80k).

So, let's compute the denominator first.

P(X>80k) is the area to the right of Z1=0.4167. Area is 1 - 0.6615 = 0.3385.

Now, the numerator is the area between Z1 and Z2, which is 0.9812 - 0.6615 = 0.3197.

So 0.3197 / 0.3385 ≈ 0.945.

Wait, that's approximately 0.945, so 0.945, which is about 94.5%. But the options don't have 0.95. The closest is E: 0.94. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact area between Z1 and Z2.

Wait, Z1 is 0.4167, and Z2 is 2.0833.

Using a calculator or precise table, let me compute the area between these two Z-values.

The area to the left of Z2 is 0.9812, and the area to the left of Z1 is 0.6615. So the area between Z1 and Z2 is 0.3197.

The area to the right of Z1 is 0.3385.

So 0.3197 /0.3385 = approximately 0.945.

Hmm, but that's 0.945, which is roughly 0.95, but the options don't have 0.95. So the closest is E:0.94.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong area for Z1. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should find the exact Z1. Let me calculate it accurately.

Z1 = (80,000 -75,000)/12,000 =5,000 /12,000 = 5/12 =0.416666667.

Looking up Z=0.4167, the area to the left is approximately 0.6615. So 1 - 0.6615 =0.3385 for the denominator.

The area between Z1 and Z2 is 0.9812 -0.6615 =0.3197.

So 0.3197 /0.3385 ≈ 0.945.

So 0.945 is approximately 0.95, but the options don't have that. So the closest is 0.94 (option E).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 0.945 is closer to 0.95, but perhaps the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem another way. Let me compute the probability that X is greater than 80k and less than 100k, divided by the probability that X is greater than 80k.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the probabilities with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the difference in Z-scores and the standard normal distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the standard normal distribution table more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for conditional probability.

Wait, perhaps better yet, I can compute the exact values.

But time is limited, so let me make a decision.

The correct answer, according to my calculations, is approximately 0.945, which is closest to 0.95. But the options don't have 0.95.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A:0.72

B:0.45

C:0.66

D:0.80

E:0.94

F:0.06

G:0.20

H:0.34

I:0.50

J:0.86

So the closest is E:0.94.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator for more precise Z-scores.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the standard error.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the probability using the Z-scores.

Wait, another approach: perhaps compute the probability that Z is between 0.4167 and 2.0833.

Which is P(0.4167 < Z <2.0833) = Φ(2.0833) - Φ(0.4167).

Φ(2.0833) is approximately 0.9812, and Φ(0.4167) is approximately 0.6615.

So the difference is 0.9812 -0.6615=0.3197.

Denominator is 1 - Φ(0.4167) =1 -0.6615=0.3385.

So 0.3197 / 0.3385 ≈0.945.

Hmm, 0.945 is approximately 0.95, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest is E:0.94.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Z-score calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact Z-scores and get the exact area.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area between two Z-scores. The area is Φ(Z2) - Φ(Z1) - [1 - Φ(Z1)].

Wait, but that's the same as Φ(Z2) - Φ(Z1) -1 + Φ(Z1) → Φ(Z2) -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just select the closest option, which is E:0.94.

So I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the conditional probability \( P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) \). This is given by:

\[
P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) = \frac{P(80,000 < X < 100,000)}{P(X > 80,000)}
\]

First, compute the Z-scores for 80,000 and 100,000:

\[
Z_{80,000} = \frac{80,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \frac{5,000}{12,000} \approx 0.4167
\]
\[
Z_{100,000} = \frac{100,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \frac{25,000}{12,000} \approx 2.0833
\]

Next, find the probabilities using the standard normal distribution:

\[
P(Z < 0.4167) \approx 0.6615
\]
\[
P(Z < 2.0833) \approx 0.9812
\]

Calculate the probabilities for the intervals:

\[
P(0.4167 < Z < 2.0833) = P(Z < 2.0833) - P(Z < 0.4167) = 0.9812 - 0.6615 = 0.3197
\]

\[
P(X > 80,000) = 1 - P(Z < 0.4167) = 1 - 0.6615 = 0.3385
\]

Finally, compute the conditional probability:

\[
P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) = \frac{0.3197}{0.3385} \approx 0.945
\]

The closest option to 0.945 is **E: 0.94**.
