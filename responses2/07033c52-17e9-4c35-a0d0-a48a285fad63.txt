Okay, so I've got this problem here: a store manager orders 81 shirts. Each shipping box holds 9 shirts. The question is asking how many shipping boxes are needed for all the shirts ordered. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 9 to 12.

Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, but I'll try to break it down. 

First, the total number of shirts is 81. Each box can carry 9 shirts. So, I need to figure out how many groups of 9 shirts can be made from 81 shirts. That makes sense because each group would require one box.

So, to find out how many boxes are needed, I can divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts per box. That is, 81 divided by 9. Let me do that calculation: 81 รท 9 equals 9. So, does that mean 9 boxes are needed?

Wait, let me make sure. If I have 9 boxes and each holds 9 shirts, 9 times 9 is 81. Yep, that adds up exactly. So, 9 boxes are needed without any leftovers.

Looking at the options, option A is 9. That seems correct. But just to double-check, what if I thought about it differently? Let's see: if each box holds 9, then 9 boxes hold 81, which is exactly the number ordered. So, that's correct.

I don't see any other option that would make sense. If I thought about using fewer boxes, say 8, then 8 times 9 is 72, which is less than 81, so that wouldn't be enough. 9 is the exact number needed. 

So, the answer should be 9. That's option A.

The number of shipping boxes needed is calculated by dividing the total shirts (81) by shirts per box (9), resulting in 9 boxes.
