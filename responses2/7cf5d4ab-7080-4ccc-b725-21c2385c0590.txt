Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about policy costs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question gives me four policies with different details. Each policy has a principal amount, a premium rate, a term in years, and the premium per $100. I need to calculate the total premium for each policy and then match the options provided.

Let me list out the details again to make sure I don't mix anything up.

Policy 1:
- Principal: $9,000
- Premium rate: $0.28 per $100
- Term: 1 year

Policy 2:
- Principal: $52,000
- Premium rate: $0.35 per $100
- Term: 3 years

Policy 3:
- Principal: $28,000
- Premium rate: $0.42 per $100
- Term: 1 year

Wait, actually, the term for Policy 3 is 1 year, but looking back, maybe I need to check that. Oh, the question says Policy 3 is 1 year, so that's straightforward.

Now, to calculate the total premium for each policy, I'll use the formula: (Principal amount / $100) * Premium rate. That gives the total premium.

Let me compute each one.

Policy 1:
Principal $9,000. Premium rate $0.28 per $100.
So, 9000 / 100 = 90. Multiply by 0.28: 90 * 0.28 = $25.20.

Policy 2:
Principal $52,000. Premium rate $0.35 per $100.
52,000 / 100 = 520. Multiply by 0.35: 520 * 0.35. Let me calculate that: 500*0.35=175, 20*0.35=7, so 175+7=182. So total is $182.00.

Policy 3:
Principal $28,000. Premium rate $0.42 per $100.
28,000 / 100 = 280. Multiply by 0.42: 280 * 0.42. Hmm, 200*0.42=84, 80*0.42=33.6. So 84 +33.6=117.6. So $117.60.

Wait, but looking at the options, I should check which one matches these numbers. Let me see the options again.

Looking at option A, Policy 1 is $52,000, which doesn't match what I calculated. Similarly, option E shows Policy 1 as $52,000, which is incorrect. Option F shows Policy 1 as $28,000, which isn't right either.

Wait, looking at the options, option F: Policy 1 is $28,000, which is correct for Policy 3's principal, but for Policy 1 it's $28,000 which is incorrect. Wait, no, let me see each option.

Option A says Policy 1 is $52,000, which is wrong. Option E: Policy 1 is $52,000, which is same as A. Option F: Policy 1 is $28,000, but that's incorrect because Policy 1's principal is $9,000, so Option F is wrong for Policy 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Policy 3. Let me recheck. Policy 3: $28,000. 28,000 /100 =280. 280 * 0.42. Let me compute 280 *0.4 =112, and 280 *0.02=5.6. So 112 +5.6=117.6. Yes, that's correct.

Looking through the options, let me see which options have the correct figures. 

Option A: Policy 1 is $52,000 (wrong), Policy 2 is $182 (correct), Policy 3 is $28 (wrong). So A is wrong.

Option B: Policy 1 is $28,000 (wrong), etc. No.

Option C: Policy 1 is $28 (wrong), Policy 2 is $491 (no, 520*0.95=494, but 520*0.35 is 182, so 182 would be Policy 2. So C's Policy 2 is wrong.

Option D: Policy 1 is $25.20 (correct), Policy 2 is $182 (correct?), Wait, wait. Let me check: Policy 2's calculation. 52,000/100=520. 520 *0.35=182. So Policy 2 is $182.00. Option D says Policy 2 is $182.00, correct. Option D's Policy 3 is $117.60, correct. But look at Policy 1: Option D: $25.20, which is correct. So D's policies are correct except Policy 3's description? Wait, no. Wait, let me reevaluate.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says Policy 1: $25.20, Policy 2: $182.00, Policy 3: $117.60.

Wait, but Policy 3's principal is $28,000, so 28,000 /100=280 *0.42=117.60. So Option D's Policy 3 is correct. So Option D has all correct figures.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me check each option.

Option A: Policy 1 is $52,000 (wrong), Policy 2 is $182 (correct), Policy 3 is $28 (wrong).

Option B: Policy 1 is $28,000 (wrong), Policy 2 is $546 (wrong, from 520 *0.35=182), Policy3 is $117.6 (correct).

Option C: Policy1 is $28 (wrong), Policy2 is $491.00 (wrong, should be 182), Policy3 is $117.00 (wrong, 117.6).

Option D: Policy1:25.20 (correct), Policy2:182 (correct), Policy3:117.60 (correct). So D is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, Option D's Policy 3 is $117.60, which is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options. Option E: Policy1 is $52,000 (wrong), Policy2 is $182 (correct), Policy3 is $117.60 (correct). So E's Policy 1 is wrong, but others correct.

Wait, but the correct figures are Policy1:25.20, Policy2:182, Policy3:117.60. So which option has these?

Looking at the options:

Option D: 25.20, 182, 117.60. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is D. Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Policy1:52, Policy2:182, Policy3:28

B: Policy1:28, Policy2:546, Policy3:117.6

C: Policy1:28, Policy2:491, Policy3:117

D: Policy1:25.20, Policy2:182, Policy3:117.60

E: Policy1:52, Policy2:182, Policy3:117.60

So D is correct because it matches all three figures.

The correct answer is D. 

To calculate the total premium for each policy:

- **Policy 1**: $9,000 principal, $0.28 per $100.  
  Calculation: (9000 / 100) * 0.28 = $25.20.

- **Policy 2**: $52,000 principal, $0.35 per $100.  
  Calculation: (52000 / 100) * 0.35 = $182.00.

- **Policy 3**: $28,000 principal, $0.42 per $100.  
  Calculation: (28000 / 100) * 0.42 = $117.60.

Option D matches these calculations exactly. 

**ANSWER: D**
