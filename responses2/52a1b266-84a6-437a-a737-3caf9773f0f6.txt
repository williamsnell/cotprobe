Okay, I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let's see what the question says. So, there's a landlord who owns a vacant warehouse. They lease it to a tenant for five years with a renewable option. The lease has some specific terms. The tenant agrees to assume full responsibility for repairs and indemnify the landlord for any loss from the premises.

On May 1, they lease the warehouse. On May 2, the landlord delivers it to the tenant. Then, an employee (a tenant) is working in the warehouse. The employee moves some equipment into the building. When this happens, a section of the ceiling collapses and falls on the employee. At the lease signing, only the landlord knew about the defect. The landlord didn't do anything about it when they delivered the property. The employee then sues the landlord for damages.

The question is: why would the employee win against the landlord? The options are A to J.

I need to think about the lease terms here. The lease says the tenant assumes full responsibility for repairs and indemnifies the landlord. But the landlord didn't repair it upon delivery. So, does that mean the landlord is liable? Or does the tenant have a duty to fix the defect?

Wait, under lease terms, the landlord is responsible for delivering the goods. But the lease doesn't specify that the landlord is responsible for repairs. It's about the tenant's responsibility. Because the landlord didn't repair it, the tenant is still responsible.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Landlord's duty of care can't be shifted to tenant by lease. That sounds correct. Because the lease doesn't provide the landlord with any duty beyond delivering the goods. The tenant's duty would be implied because they own the premises.

Option B: Tenant is responsible for injuries once possession is transferred. But the landlord didn't deliver yet. Once they deliver, the landlord is responsible for repairs. But in this case, the landlord didn't fix it. So the tenant is still liable.

Option C: Tenant can't waive implied warranty. The lease doesn't mention any such terms. So the landlord wouldn't be liable for the defect, so the tenant isn't protected.

Option D: Landlord is absolved once the lease is signed. But the landlord didn't fix it. So it's not absolved. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Landlord failed to repair, but that's not the issue. The landlord was to deliver, but not to fix. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Covenants against public policy. The lease doesn't say anything about that; it's about responsibilities, not about protecting others.

Option G: Tenant's employee not protected. But the landlord didn't repair the defect, so the tenant's duty to fix it makes them liable. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Landlord is strictly liable. But the landlord didn't do anything. So H is wrong.

Option I: Landlord's duty can be shifted. The lease doesn't require the landlord to repair, so I is correct.

Option J: Tenant's acknowledgment absolves landlord. But the landlord didn't repair, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is between A and I.

Wait, the question is about why the employee wins. If the landlord's duty cannot be transferred, then A is correct. If the landlord is not liable because they didn't repair, then I is correct.

But which is it? Let's see. The lease says the tenant assumes all repairs and indemnifies. But the landlord didn't do anything. So the tenant is still responsible.

Option A says the landlord's duty can't be shifted to tenant by lease. That's correct because the lease doesn't say anything about the landlord's duty to repair. So the landlord is still liable.

Option I says the landlord's duty can be shifted through lease. No, because the lease doesn't provide any such duty.

So the right answer is A and I. But the options are separate, so which is the correct reason.

The question is about why the employee wins. If the landlord's duty can't be shifted, then the landlord is still liable, and the tenant isn't protected. So if the landlord isn't liable, the employee can sue.

So the correct answer is A: landlord's duty of care can't be shifted to tenant by lease.

Wait, but the landlord didn't fix the defect. So the tenant is still responsible. So the lease doesn't require the landlord to fix it, so the landlord is still liable.

So the employee can sue because the landlord's duty can't be shifted. So the answer is A.

The correct answer is A: "Landlord's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to a tenant by the lease." The lease only requires the tenant to assume all responsibilities and indemnify the landlord for any losses. Since the landlord did not repair the defect upon delivery, the tenant remains responsible. Therefore, the landlord's duty cannot be shifted, and the employee can prevail.

Answer: A
