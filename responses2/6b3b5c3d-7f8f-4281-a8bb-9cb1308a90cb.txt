Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about options trading. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a European call option. Let me read it again.

So, the call option has a strike price of $50 and a maturity of one month. It trades for $5. Now, the question is asking what the put premium would be for identical strike price and time to expiration, given the same one-month risk-free rate and the spot price of the underlying is $52.

Wait, the options are about the put premium. I remember that there's a principle called put-call parity that relates the prices of call and put options. Let me recall the formula. Put-call parity says that the put price plus the call price equals the spot price plus the present value of the strike price minus the interest cost of borrowing. Or wait, the exact formula is put = call + S - strike * e^(-rt). Oh wait, no, the formula is put = call + S - strike + PV of strike - PV of strike? No, wait. Let me get it right.

The put-call parity formula is: Call + PV(Strike) = Put + S. No, wait, the correct formula is Put = Call - S + PV(Strike). Or maybe it's put + call = spot + strike * e^(-rt). I think I'm getting confused. Let me write down the correct equation.

The correct put-call parity is: Put = Call - S + Ke^(-rT). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as Put = Call + S - Ke^(-rT). Oh wait, no, I think the correct formula is Put = Call + S - Ke^(-rT). Or is it Put = Call + S - PV(Strike)? Because PV(Strike) is Ke^(-rT). So the formula would be Put = Call + S - PV(Strike). 

But let me double-check. From what I remember, the put-call parity is: C + K e^{-rT} = P + S. So rearranged, P = C + K e^{-rT} - S. So that's the formula. So the put price equals the call price plus the present value of the strike minus the spot price.

So in this problem, the call is currently $5. The strike is $50, time to expiration is one month, risk-free rate is 2%, spot is $52. We need to find the put price.

Wait, but the question is about identical strike and time. So the put has the same strike (50) and same time (1 month). So their prices depend on the same parameters.

Let me plug in the numbers. So K = 50, r=0.02, T=1/12 (since one month is 1/12 of a year), S=52, C=5.

So the present value of the strike is K e^{-rT} = 50 * e^(-0.02*(1/12)).

Let me compute that. 0.02*(1/12) is about 0.001666... So e^-0.001666 is approximately 1 - 0.001666 + (0.001666²)/2 ≈ 0.998333. So 50 * 0.998333 ≈ 49.91665.

So PV(Strike) ≈ 49.91665.

Now, the formula: P = C + PV(Strike) - S = 5 + 49.91665 -52.

Wait, 5 + 49.91665 is 54.91665. Subtract 52 gives 2.91665, which is approximately $2.92. So the put price would be about $2.92.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.92. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm assuming that the correct formula is Put = Call + S - PV(Strike). But wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Let me think of the parity formula again.

The correct formula is Put = C + S - PV(Strike). So in this case, C is $5, S is $52, PV(Strike) is approximately 49.91665.

So 5 +52 =57. 57 -49.91665 =7.08335? No, wait, no, the formula is Put = C + S - PV(Strike). So 5 +52 =57. 57 -49.91665 =7.08335. That can't be right because that would make the put price higher, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C = P + S - Ke^{-rT}. So rearranged, P = C - S + Ke^{-rT}.

Wait, then in this case, P =5 -52 +49.91665 = (5 +49.91665) -52 = 54.91665 -52= 2.91665, which is about $2.92. So that matches the earlier calculation.

So the correct answer is A: 2.92.

To determine the price of the put premium with identical strike price and time until expiration, we use the put-call parity formula:

\[
P = C + K e^{-rT} - S
\]

### Given Values:
- Call price (\(C\)) = \$5
- Strike price (\(K\)) = \$50
- Time to expiration (\(T\)) = 1 month = \(1/12\) year
- Risk-free rate (\(r\)) = 2% = 0.02
- Spot price (\(S\)) = \$52

### Step 1: Calculate \(K e^{-rT}\)
\[
K e^{-rT} = 50 \cdot e^{-0.02 \cdot (1/12)}
\]
\[
0.02 \cdot (1/12) = 0.0016667
\]
\[
e^{-0.0016667} \approx 0.998333
\]
\[
K e^{-rT} \approx 50 \cdot 0.998333 = 49.91665
\]

### Step 2: Apply the Put-Call Parity Formula
\[
P = C + K e^{-rT} - S
\]
\[
P = 5 + 49.91665 - 52
\]
\[
P = 54.91665 - 52 = 2.91665
\]

### Final Result:
The put premium is approximately **\$2.92**, which corresponds to option **A**.
