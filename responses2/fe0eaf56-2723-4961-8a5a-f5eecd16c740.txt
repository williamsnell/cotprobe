Alright, I'm trying to figure out how old Guru Nanak was when he started preaching the message of the divine Name. Let's see, I remember that Guru Nanak was a famous Indian Brahmin who lived a long time ago. I think he was born around 1600, but I'm not exactly sure. 

Wait, I've heard he was born in the early 16th century. So if he was born in, say, 1574, then subtracting some years for his first sermon might bring him down to his early 40s. Let me think about the options provided. The choices are 40, 55, 35, 33, 52, 50, 25, 30, 45, 20. So let's break it down.

If he was born in 1574, subtracting 1574 from 1614 (since 1614 is roughly when he started speaking) would give 40. So 1614 minus 1574 is 40. That makes his age when he started preaching about 40. Looking at the options, 40 is option A. But wait, I seem to remember that he started spelling out the Name of the Great God at a younger age. Maybe he was around 30 or so.

Wait, another angle: I think he was 40 when he started speaking. But some sources say he was 30. Let me think about the exact years. I believe he was born in 1589. So 1589 + 40 is 1629. But if he started speaking in 1629, that would make him 40 when he began. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if he was 30, maybe born in 1619, which would make him 30 in 1649. But that seems too recent.

Alternatively, some sources say he was born in 1597, so 1597 plus 17 is 1614, which would make him 17 when he started. That doesn't fit the options. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the exact years. Another thought: I've read that he was 40 when he started, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe 35 or 45. 

Wait, I think I've heard that he was 40 when he began. So the correct answer would be option A:40. But another possibility is that the question is referring to the time after his death, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for when he started speaking in a particular context, like his famous sermons. 

I'm a bit confused because I'm not exactly certain about the exact age. But the most common answer I've heard is 40, so I'll go with that.

The correct answer is A:40.
