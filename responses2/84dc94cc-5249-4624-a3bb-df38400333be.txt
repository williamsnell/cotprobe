Question:

A defendant was arrested and prosecuted for the crime of false pretenses. At trial, the defendant testified that she prophesied the victim's imminent death. The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?

Options:

A: A juror was overheard discussing the details of the case outside the courtroom during the trial.
B: A juror admitted to having a personal financial interest in the outcome of the case.
C: A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.
D: A juror admitted to having made a decision about the verdict before the trial began.
E: Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.
F: A juror stated that she didn't believe in the concept of false pretenses, and therefore thought the defendant was not guilty from the start.
G: A juror confessed to having previously known the defendant but did not disclose this during jury selection.
H: A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.
I: A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically about false pretenses. I need to figure out which option would best give a new trial for the defendant. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the defendant's evidence in a trial. She testified that she prophesied her victim's death, but she admitted she told the victim she could save him if he gave a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief in a ritual. After the ritual, she returned the handkerchief but it was filled with waste. She was convicted of false pretenses and moved for a new trial, offering affidavits from jurors.

The goal is to find which affidavit would best provide the defendant's best basis for a new trial. The options are A to H.

False pretenses law in Canada typically requires that the defendant show that the person they falsely accuse was innocent. The elements usually include proving that the defendant was aware of the false statement and that the defendant's actions or words contributed to the belief that the person was innocent.

So, for a new trial, the defendant needs strong evidence that she was aware of the false statement and that her actions (like giving the money) led to the defendant believing the person was innocent.

Looking at the options:

A: A juror during the trial discussed the case outside. This could show the juror was in the know, but maybe not enough? Or perhaps they corroborated another point.

B: Juror admitted to having a financial interest. That's interesting. If a juror knows the defendant is guilty, that could be a key point. Because the defendant was convicted, but maybe the juror's interest could show she's guilty, making the evidence against her stronger.

C: Juror had animosity during deliberations. That's a negative point, not helpful for a new trial. If a juror is animistic, it would support the prosecution, not the defense.

D: Juror made a decision before trial. If the decision was made before the trial, it's a bit confusing. If the decision was made outside the trial, it might show a bias. But the decision's validity could be an issue if the trial was improper.

E: Juror fell asleep during closing argument. That's a serious issue for trial. If the juror was asleep, their testimony might be unreliable. But the question is about a new trial, which is about the evidence against the defendant, not the reliability of the evidence themselves.

F: Juror said she didn't believe in false pretenses. That's a strong endorsement. If the juror knows the defendant is guilty, that would make the evidence stronger against her.

G: Juror previously knew but didn't disclose during selection. If the juror knew but didn't say during selection, it's a lack of evidence, which is a defense. But if they were involved in the case, maybe they can say something in a different way.

H: Juror misunderstood the court's instructions. This is a defense because it shows the juror was under stress or in an inconsistent state during the trial, which undermines their reliability.

I: Juror read a newspaper article implicating the defendant. That's a strong cross-examination point. If the article supports her guilt, the evidence against her would be stronger.

So, the options that are strong bases for a new trial are B, F, I, and perhaps I.

But wait, F says the juror didn't believe in false pretenses. If she made that declaration, that would add strong evidence that she is guilty. That's a solid defense.

Option I says a juror read an article implicating the defendant. That would provide direct evidence of guilt, which would help in a trial against her.

Now, looking at the options for which would best give the defendant's best basis for a new trial:

- Option F gives a definite answer about guilt, which would strengthen the evidence against her.
- Option I also gives direct evidence of guilt, but it's about reading an article. If the article supports her guilt, it's a valid point.

But which is better? If a juror is telling the truth in their testimony, they would say they don't believe in false pretenses. Alternatively, if they read an article implicating them, that would also be a valid point.

Wait, but in the context of a new trial, the best evidence would be direct. So if the defendant knows the defendant is guilty and the defense is offering her a chance to expose that, the strongest evidence would be a declaration that she doesn't believe in false pretenses. So F would be a good option.

Alternatively, if the defendant can show that the person she accused is innocent, but that's a stretch. The best way is to have a declaration of guilt.

But looking at the options, F is about her not believing in the concept. That's a strong point because if she doesn't believe in false pretenses, that would make her more likely guilty, and the evidence would be stronger against her.

So the correct answer would be F.

The question revolves around providing the defendant's best basis for a new trial after being convicted of false pretenses. The key is to identify evidence that would strengthen the case against her, making her more likely guilty and the evidence against her stronger.

- **Option A**: While mentioning discussions outside the trial, it's unclear if it's sufficient.
- **Option B**: A juror admitting financial interest strengthens the case, showing guilt.
- **Option C**: Negative animosity against the defendant is a defense, not a basis for a new trial.
- **Option D**: Decisions before trial might not be reliable, but it doesn't directly address guilt.
- **Option E**: Falling asleep during closing arguments undermines reliability, not credibility.
- **Option F**: A juror declaring she doesn't believe in false pretenses directly supports guilt, making her more likely guilty.
- **Option G**: Not disclosure during selection is not a valid defense.
- **Option H**: Misunderstanding court instructions is a defense.
- **Option I**: Reading an article implicating guilt provides direct evidence, which is strong.

The strongest evidence for a new trial is a declaration of guilt, as in **Option F**, which directly supports the defendant's guilt.

ANSWER: F
