Okay, so I've got this question about Jefferson's Clothing and their current ratio. Let me think through this step by step. The question gives me current assets, current liabilities, and capital. I need to find the current ratio.

Wait, what's the current ratio? Oh right, it's calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. That's a quick measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations.

So looking at the numbers: current assets are $150,000, and current liabilities are $50,000. So I just need to divide 150k by 50k. Let me calculate that. 150,000 divided by 50,000 equals 3. So the current ratio is 3.

Now, checking the options provided. Option H is 3. So the answer should be H.

The current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. Jefferson's Clothing has $150,000 in current assets and $50,000 in current liabilities. 

Calculation: \( \frac{150,000}{50,000} = 3 \).

The correct answer is H: 3.

Answer: H
