Okay, so I've got this question about calculating real GDP using price indices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me two years: 1929 and 1933. The money NNP (which I remember stands for National Income and Possities, or GDP) and the price index for 1929 is $96 billion and 100, and for 1933, it's $48 billion with an index of 75. 

The question has two parts, a and b. 

Part a) asks for the real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as a base. So I think that means I need to adjust the 1933 GDP to 1929's prices. The formula for real GDP is something like Real GDP = Nominal GDP * (Base year price index / Current year price index). Wait, is that right? Because when using a base year, you adjust using the price index of that base year.

So, in this case, for part a, the base year is 1929. So I take the 1933 GDP, which is $48 billion, and divide it by the 1929 index (100), then multiply by 100 again? Wait, that would leave it the same because 100 divided by 100 is 1. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait another thought: Maybe the formula is real GDP = (nominal GDP * base year index) / current year index. Oh wait, no, I'm mixing up. Let me think again. 

The correct formula for real GDP when adjusting from current year to base year is:

Real GDP = (Nominal GDP * Base year's price index) / Current year's price index.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, noâ€”no, wait. The base year's price index is 100, so the current year's price index is, say, 75. So to get real GDP for 1933 in 1929 terms, I would calculate: (1933 NNP) * (1929 index / 1933 index). Because 1929 is the base, so you're scaling up to match that year's prices.

So, for part a: 1933 NNP is $48 billion. The 1929 index is 100, and the 1933 index is 75. So the calculation would be 48 * (100 /75). Let me compute that. 100 divided by 75 is 1.333... So 48 * 1.333 is about 64. So the real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as base is $64 billion. So the first number is 64.

Wait, but wait, part a is real in 1933 using 1929 as base. So yes, in this case, that's correct because the base year is 1929, so the real value would be higher if the current year's prices are higher than the base.

Wait, another way to think: the price index in 1933 is 75. So each dollar in 1933 is worth 75 / 100 = 0.75 of 1929 dollars. So to get real 1933 GDP in 1929 terms, you multiply by 1/0.75 = 1.333... So 48 * 1.333 = 64. So part a is 64.

Part b asks for the real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as a base. So now the base is 1933, and the current year is 1929. So we need to calculate: (1929 NNP) * (1933 index / 1929 index). Because 1933 is the base, so the 1929 NNP would have to be adjusted to 1933 prices.

So 1929 NNP is $96. The 1933 index is 75, and 1929 index is 100. So 96 * (75/100) = 96 * 0.75 = 72. So the real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as base is $72. 

So the two answers are 64 and 72. Looking at the options, option A is $64 and $72. So the answer is option A.

To calculate the real NNP using the given price indices:

### Part a) Real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as a base:
The formula to adjust for the base year is:
\[
\text{Real NNP} = \text{Nominal NNP} \times \frac{\text{Base year price index}}{\text{Current year price index}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Real NNP}_{1933} = 48 \times \frac{100}{75} = 48 \times 1.333 \approx 64
\]
Thus, the real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as a base is **$64**.

### Part b) Real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as a base:
The formula to adjust for the current year is:
\[
\text{Real NNP} = \text{Nominal NNP} \times \frac{\text{Current year price index}}{\text{Base year price index}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Real NNP}_{1929} = 96 \times \frac{75}{100} = 96 \times 0.75 = 72
\]
Thus, the real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as a base is **$72**.

### Final Answer:
The two real NNP values are **$64** (1933, 1929 base) and **$72** (1929, 1933 base).
