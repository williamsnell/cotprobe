Okay, so I have this physics problem here about air drag on a flying squirrel. Let me try to think through it.

The question is asking about the amount of air drag on the squirrel when it's dropping vertically at terminal velocity. The options are from A to J, each making a claim about how the drag varies with different factors.

First, I remember that when an object is moving at its terminal velocity, it's moving at a constant speed. At terminal velocity, the forces acting on the object are balanced. So the drag force equals the weight of the object. The weight is given as 0.8 N.

Terminal velocity is when the gravitational force (weight) equals the drag force plus any other forces like air resistance. Oh wait, but for objects moving through air, the drag force usually depends on the cross-sectional area, speed squared, and air density. The formula is something like F_d = 0.5 * rho * vÂ² * Cd * A, where rho is air density, v is velocity, Cd is drag coefficient, and A is area.

But wait, in this case, the squirrel is dropping vertically at terminal velocity. So the velocity is constant. But the drag force depends on the speed. If the speed is constant, then the drag force remains the same because v is not changing. So at terminal velocity, the drag is equal to the weight, which is 0.8 N.

Let me look at the options. Option C says the drag is 0.8 N, which matches what I thought. So the amount of air drag is 0.8 N. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but what about factors like air pressure or other variables? For example, if the squirrel's size or weight changes, it might affect the drag. But the question states it's a 0.8-N squirrel, so their mass and size are fixed. So regardless of other factors, the drag would be 0.8 N.

Other options: A says it depends on wind speed. No, because if the wind speed is constant (terminal velocity), then drag is constant. B says greater than 0.8 N, which can't be right because at terminal velocity, drag equals weight. C is correct. D says depends on temperature. Well, temperature affects air density. If the squirrel's body changes (like if it's in colder air), the drag might change. But the question is about the drag based on the factors given, without assuming any changes. So the drag is 0.8 N, so C is the answer regardless of any other variables.

The problem involves determining the air drag force on an 0.8-N flying squirrel dropping vertically at terminal velocity. At terminal velocity, the drag force equals the weight of the object because the forces are balanced. The drag force depends on factors like air density, cross-sectional area, velocity, and drag coefficient, but these can vary based on environmental conditions or the object's properties (e.g., size, weight). However, the question specifies a 0.8-N weight, so the drag force is fixed at 0.8 N regardless of other variables. 

**Analysis of options:**
- **A:** Incorrect. Air drag depends on speed, not just speed.
- **B:** Incorrect. Drag equals weight at terminal velocity, not greater.
- **C:** Correct. Drag force equals weight (0.8 N) at terminal velocity.
- **D:** Incorrect. Drag does not depend on temperature in this context.
- **E:** Incorrect. Drag depends on the object's size and shape, not orientation.
- **F:** Incorrect. Drag does not depend on height.
- **G:** Incorrect. Drag depends on velocity, not height.
- **H:** Incorrect. Drag depends on air pressure, not other factors.
- **I:** Incorrect. Drag depends on the object's size, not its size.
- **J:** Incorrect. Drag depends on the object's weight, not weight itself.

The correct answer is **C: 0.8 N**.

Answer: C
