Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, Roslyn has 20 boxes. Some of these boxes contain pencils, some contain pens, and some contain neither. I need to find out how many boxes have both pens and pencils. Hmm, sounds like a problem where I can use some set theory principles, maybe a Venn diagram approach.

Alright, let's break down the information. First, there are 20 boxes in total. Out of these, 13 boxes have pencils, 9 have pens, and 3 have neither. Wait, so the boxes that have neither pens nor pencils are 3. That means what's left (20-3=17) have at least pens or pencils or both. Oh wait, no—wait, the boxes that have neither are 3, so the ones that have either pens or pencils or both would be 20-3=17 boxes.

So, the boxes that have pens or pencils, or both, are 17. Now, the number of boxes with pens is 9, and the number with pencils is 13. Wait, but if I add 9 and 13, that's 22. But since there are only 17 boxes that have pens or pencils, that means there's an overlap. Because 22 is more than 17, the overlap would be 22-17=5. So, 5 boxes must contain both pens and pencils. That makes sense.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. So, the total boxes are 20. Subtract the 3 that have neither, giving 17. These 17 have at least pens or pencils. So, the number with pens is 9, and with pencils is 13. So, if I add those two, I get 22, but since there's only 17 boxes in this category, the overlapping must account for the extra. So, 22-17=5. So, 5 boxes contain both pens and pencils. So, the answer should be 5, which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way is using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. Here, A is pens, B is pencils. So, |A ∪ B| is 17. |A| is 9, |B| is 13. So, 17 = 9 +13 - |A ∩ B|. That's 17 =22 - x, so x=5. Yep, same result. So, 5 boxes have both pens and pencils.

To find the number of boxes containing both pens and pencils, we apply the inclusion-exclusion principle. With 20 boxes in total, 3 have neither, leaving 17 with pens or pencils or both. Using |Pens ∪ Pencils| = |Pens| + |Pencils| - |Pens ∩ Pencils|, we have 17 = 9 + 13 - x. Solving gives x = 5.

Answer: H: 5
