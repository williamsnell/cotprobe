Okay, so I need to find the limit of (n!)^(1/n) divided by n as n approaches infinity. Hmm, I remember that factorials grow very rapidly, so maybe I can use Stirling's approximation here. Let me think about Stirling's formula. It says that n! is approximately sqrt(2πn) * (n/e)^n. 

So, if I take the (n)th root of n!, that would be (sqrt(2πn))^(1/n) multiplied by (n/e). Then, I divide that by n. Let me write that out step by step.

Stirling's approximation gives us:
n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) * (n/e)^n

Taking the nth root:
(n!)^(1/n) ≈ [sqrt(2πn)]^(1/n) * (n/e)

Now, dividing by n:
(n!)^(1/n)/n ≈ [sqrt(2πn)]^(1/n) * (n/e) / n

Simplify the terms:
The sqrt(2πn) is (2πn)^(1/2), and when we take the nth root of that, it becomes (2πn)^(1/(2n)).

So, the expression becomes:
(2πn)^(1/(2n)) * (1/e) * (1/n^(n-1))

Wait, perhaps I should re-express it differently. Let me rewrite (n/e)^n as e^{-n} * n^n. Then, taking the nth root would give e^{-1} * n. But wait, Stirling's formula is an approximation, so maybe it's better to proceed with the approximation.

Going back, let's compute (n!)^(1/n) ≈ (n/e)^{1} * (2πn)^{1/(2n)}. Because (n/e)^n to the 1/n is (n/e).

So, (n!)^(1/n)/n ≈ (n/e) * (2πn)^{1/(2n)} / n.

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving (1/e) * (2πn)^{1/(2n)}.

Now, consider the term (2πn)^{1/(2n)}. As n approaches infinity, what's the limit of (2πn)^{1/(2n)}? Let's think about whether this term approaches 1 or 0 or e^{-something}.

Let me take the logarithm of (2πn)^{1/(2n)}. That would be (1/(2n)) * ln(2πn) = [ln(2πn)]/(2n). As n tends to infinity, the denominator grows much faster than the numerator. So the logarithm approaches zero, which implies that (2πn)^{1/(2n)} approaches e^0 = 1.

So, (n!)^(1/n)/n ≈ (1/e) * 1 = 1/e as n becomes large.

1/e is approximately 0.367879441...

Looking at the options, option D is 0.367879441, which matches. So the limit is 1/e.

The limit of \((n!)^{1/n}/n\) as \(n\) approaches infinity can be determined using Stirling's approximation, which states that \(n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n} \cdot (n/e)^n\). Taking the nth root and dividing by \(n\), the dominant term simplifies to \(1/e\), as the other terms tend to 1. Thus, the limit is approximately \(0.367879441\).

Answer: D
