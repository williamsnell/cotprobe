Question:

A previously healthy 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department in August 1 hour after the onset of headache, dizziness, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5째C (103.1째F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Administer an epinephrine injection
B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula
C: Perform a lumbar puncture
D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath
E: Apply cold compresses to the forehead
F: Obtain a CT scan of the head
G: Administer a dose of ibuprofen
H: Administer intravenous fluids
I: Administer sodium chloride tablets
J: Administer a glucose injection

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what's going on here. The question is about a young boy who's had an emergency, and I have to choose the right next step in his management. Let me read through the details again.

So, the boy is a 15-year-old healthy boy who's been to the emergency department in August. His symptoms started during a first-hour football practice in full uniform. So, he was probably feeling a bit tired or unwell right then. His symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and an episode of vomiting. He also told the doctor he felt weak and faint but didn't lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. He was diaphoretic, which I think is when someone's breath is dry and sharp, and they don't notice breathing. He's not oriented to person, place, or time, which makes me think he's not oriented. His temperature is 39.5째C, which is quite high, but it's not a fever because the normal is like 37-39째C. His pulse is 120/min, which is pretty fast, respiratory rate 40/min, which is also a bit high but not feverish. Blood pressure is 90/65 mmHg, which is a bit high but normal, I think.

Looking at the options:

A: Administer epinephrine. Epinephrine is like painkillers, but the boy is not oriented, so he might not be in pain. Moreover, he's not having a headache, so epinephrine might be less likely.

B: Oxygen via a nasal cannula. Vomiting is a common symptom for oxygen deprivation. The boy vomited after drinking water, so he didn't get enough oxygen. So maybe he's just not oriented. Nasal cannula would help oxygenate, but he already vomited, so perhaps just oxygenation isn't the issue here.

C: Performing a lumbar puncture. That's for checking internal structures, like the brain. But he's not oriented, so maybe it's not necessary. Or maybe he's oriented but just not oriented enough, so a lumbar puncture might not be needed.

D: Ice bath. If he's not oriented, maybe the ice is to cool him down without causing dizziness. But the question is about the next step, and he's already diaphoretic. So maybe he's too weak to do that.

E: Cold compresses. The forehead is a common place for colds. He's not oriented, so maybe a cold would help. But the symptoms are more about oxygen and possibly just not being oriented.

F: CT scan. That would be for evaluating the brain, but he's not oriented, so perhaps not needed. Also, the boy's symptoms are more about oxygen and weakness, not brain function.

G: Ibuprofen. That's an NSAID, but again, he's not oriented, so he might not need it. Also, the boy is not showing signs of pain, so it might not be needed.

H: IV fluids. Maybe he's not oriented, so IV fluids can't help with that. But he's already diaphoretic, so maybe not.

I: Sodium chloride. That's just for hydration. Not the next step.

J: Glucose injection. That's for diabetes, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

So the most likely options are B and E.

But the boy is diaphoretic, which indicates dry breath. Vomiting is a sign of oxygen deprivation. So without oxygen, he might just be not oriented. So oxygen isn't the issue. So the next step would be to provide oxygen, which is B: oxygen via nasal cannula. So the answer should be B.

The boy is a 15-year-old with symptoms of weakness and vomiting, which are common in oriented but unoriented patients. His symptoms are likely due to oxygen deprivation, and the boy is not oriented to time. The most appropriate next step is to provide oxygen to facilitate oxygen deprivation. The correct answer is:

**B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula**
