Okay, so I have this problem here where a point (x, y, z) is randomly selected within a cube defined by -1 ≤ x ≤ 1, -1 ≤ y ≤ 1, and -1 ≤ z ≤ 1. I need to find the probability that x² + y² + z² ≤ 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability is usually the ratio of the favorable volume to the total volume. So I need to find the volume of the region where x² + y² + z² ≤ 1 and divide it by the volume of the cube.

The cube has sides of length 2, from -1 to 1 in each dimension. So the total volume is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. That's straightforward.

Now, the region where x² + y² + z² ≤ 1 is a sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin. Wait, the equation x² + y² + z² ≤ 1 is a sphere of radius 1. But since the cube extends from -1 to 1 in all axes, the sphere is entirely contained within the cube. So the favorable volume is the volume of the sphere.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Substituting r=1, the volume is (4/3)π. 

But wait, the question is about the probability, so I take the sphere's volume and divide by the cube's volume. So probability = (4π/3) / 8. Let me compute that: (4π/3) divided by 8 is (4π)/(3*8) = (π)/(6). That would be π/6, which is option I.

Wait, but hold on. I remember that when dealing with probability in three dimensions, sometimes the regions can be tricky. But in this case, the sphere is entirely within the cube, so the favorable volume is indeed the sphere's volume.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the sphere is entirely within the cube. Since each coordinate goes from -1 to 1, and the sphere has radius 1, the maximum distance from the origin is 1, so yes, the sphere is entirely inside the cube. So the favorable volume is (4/3)π, and the total volume is 8.

So the probability is (4π/3)/8 = π/6. That would be option I.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is π/6. So that's the answer.

The probability is calculated as the volume of the sphere (where x² + y² + z² ≤ 1) divided by the volume of the cube (from -1 to 1 in all dimensions). The sphere's volume is (4/3)π, and the cube's volume is 8. Thus, the probability is (4π/3)/8 = π/6.
