Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Carruthers' views on our duties to animals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that there's a legal framework called the Animal Rights Code (ARC) that addresses animal rights and duties. I think Carruthers is a legal expert, possibly from the Australian legal community, so his views would align with Australian legislation.

The question asks about the duties as per Carruthers. The options are A to J, each with different descriptions. Let me recall what I know about the ARC.

The ARC has several sections. One of the key sections is the "Right to Life" section, which outlines what the right to life entails. It says that animals have an absolute right to life, health, and well-being. But wait, I think there's also a duty to take care of the animals, which might be a bit different.

Wait, no, I think the ARC doesn't necessarily say that we have to take care of animals. Instead, it says that the right to life is absolute. So, the duty is to protect their rights, but not to take over their lives. So, that would be an absolute duty, right?

Looking at the options, B says "absolute and fundamental." That sounds right because the ARC's "Right to Life" is a fundamental principle, and it's absolute in the sense that it's an inherent right, not something we have to do in a way that's conditional or fluctuating.

Other options: A is about being conditional, but I think that's not the case. C is direct, which isn't accurate because direct duties usually involve action, but the ARC's duty is more about rights. D and E don't fit. F says direct and basic, which aligns with absolute. G is perfect, which might not apply. H is primary but not imperative, which I'm not sure about. I and J don't fit.

So the correct answer should be B: absolute and fundamental.
