Okay, so I've got this question here asking which expression represents the phrase "3 fewer than a number, p." Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what the phrase means. "3 fewer than a number, p" sounds like we're starting with some number p and then subtracting 3 from it. So, if p is, say, 5, then 3 fewer than 5 would be 2. That makes sense because 5 minus 3 is 2.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one to see which fits. The options are A through J, and each is an expression involving p. The key here is knowing the correct mathematical operation based on the wording.

Option A is p%3. That's probably modulus, which gives the remainder after division. But the question is about subtracting 3, not modulus. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B is p + 3. That would mean adding 3 to p, which is the opposite of what the phrase says. So B is adding, not subtracting.

Option C is 3^p. That's an exponent, meaning 3 raised to the power of p. Like if p is 2, it's 9. But the phrase is about subtracting 3, not exponentiating. So C is out.

Option D is p - 3. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. Subtract 3 from p. So D seems correct.

Option E is 3/p. That's division, so 3 divided by p. Not what we need here. So E is not it.

Option F is p^3. Again, that's exponentiation, like p cubed. Not a subtraction of 3, so F is not the right choice.

Option G is p*3. That's multiplication, like 3 times p. Not related to subtracting 3.

Option H is 3*p. Same as G, multiplication. So H is out.

Option I is 3 - p. Wait, that's subtracting p from 3. But the phrase says "3 fewer than a number, p," which is p minus 3, not 3 minus p. So I is the reverse of what we need. So I's not correct.

Option J is p/3. That's division, like p divided by 3. Not what we need. So J is not the right choice.

Wait, but I thought D was correct. So I should double-check. The phrase is 3 fewer than p. So mathematically, it's p minus 3, which is D. So yes, D is the correct option.

The phrase "3 fewer than a number, p" translates to subtracting 3 from p, which is represented by p - 3. 

Answer: D: p-3
