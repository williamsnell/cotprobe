Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the access matrix approach in access control systems. Hmm, I remember that the access matrix method is used to protect access to resources by defining who can and cannot access them. It's a bit like a grid where each row and column represents different users or processes, and the cells indicate access or not.

The question is asking what's a difficulty that the access matrix approach has. The options are A to J, each with a specific point. Let me think through each option.

Option A: It requires an extensive amount of computational power. I'm not certain about this. I know that access control can get complex, but does the access matrix method require heavy computation? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the main difficulty.

Option B: It's not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. Wait, the access matrix is supposed to handle various levels of permissions and access control. So if it's complex, it can probably express those requirements, making this option incorrect.

Option C: The matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage. I remember that large matrices can be cumbersome because managing a matrix with many entries is error-prone. This seems like a real challenge, so this might be a correct answer.

Option D: The matrix cannot be modified once it's created. Oh, right, once the matrix is set up, changes are hard to make. Like, if someone wants to change some access rules, the matrix doesn't allow that. That's definitely a limitation of this approach.

Option E: It doesn't allow for the sharing of resources between processes. Oh, right, the matrix is supposed to protect resources, but if it's stored as data, then two processes might not know about each other's resources. So they might not share, which is a problem. But wait, the question is about a difficulty the matrix approach has. So E is a real problem.

Option F: There's no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself. That's tricky because you might want to update or change rules on the fly. Having no way to do that is a problem.

Option G: It doesn't provide sufficient protection against external threats. Correct, because the matrix can't account for all possible threats, so there's a risk of unauthorized access.

Option H: There's no way to express the hierarchy of access rights within the matrix. Oh, right, the matrix doesn't capture the structure of who can access whom. It's more like a table, not a hierarchy, so it doesn't show the proper permissions and limitations. So this is a difficulty.

Option I: Deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable. No, that's more of an assumption rather than a difficulty. It's a decision, so it's possible, not undecidable.

Option J: The matrix, if not stored directly, can cause system failure. Storing it in a way that's vulnerable to tampering is a real issue. So this is a difficulty as well.

The question is asking which is a difficulty. Let's go back to the options. The access matrix approach has several challenges. The matrix is large (option C), it can't be modified (option D). It can't be modified, which is a big issue because updates are hard. Also, the matrix doesn't capture the hierarchy (option H), and it doesn't handle sharing (option E). Also, if it's not stored directly (option J), it's vulnerable. 

But the question is about what is a difficulty that the access matrix approach has. Let me look at each option again.

The question is asking about the difficulty. So the options that are correct are C, D, E, F, H, J. But are these all correct?

Wait, the question is about a difficulty, so perhaps only one option is correct.

Looking back, the question is about which option is a difficulty. So each option may be a correct statement. Let me think which one is the intended correct answer.

Option C: the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage. Yes, this is a significant issue. Access control systems often use matrices because they can handle a lot of users and permissions, but the matrix itself is large and can be hard to manage.

Option D: the matrix cannot be modified once it's created. Yes, because if someone wants to change some access rules, the matrix doesn't allow that.

Option E: It doesn't allow for the sharing of resources between processes. Yes, because the matrix is about who can access what, not about how to share those resources.

Option J: the matrix, if not stored directly, can cause system failure. That's a real problem because if the matrix isn't stored properly, it can cause issues. So this is a difficulty.

But the question is which is a difficulty. Now, which of these are considered correct.

Wait, I think the question is about what's the main difficulty. Let me think about each option.

The access matrix approach has several limitations. One of the main challenges is that once the matrix is created, it's difficult to modify it. So that's a difficulty. Similarly, the matrix can't be modified, so option D is correct.

Also, the matrix can't be modified, which is a big issue because it requires changes in access rules. So that's a difficulty.

Option C: the matrix is large. That's a difficulty because managing a large matrix is time-consuming and error-prone.

Option E: not allowing sharing of resources. That's a problem, but perhaps it's not as critical as modifying rules.

Hmm, the question asks for the difficulty. So each of C, D, E, J are correct. But I need to choose which is the best answer.

Wait, the options are presented as possible correct statements about difficulties. So the question is which is a difficulty, and each option is a statement about the matrix approach's difficulties.

Looking back, the options are A through J. The question is which is a difficulty. So the correct answer would be the option that correctly describes a difficulty.

The question is asking what's a difficulty. So each of the options A to J could be correct if they are facts about the matrix approach.

So, let's see:

- Option C: the matrix is large. Yes, that's a difficulty because during management, maintaining a large matrix is cumbersome.

- Option D: cannot be modified. Yes, another major difficulty.

- Option E: can't share resources. Another difficulty.

- Option J: not storing directly can cause failure. Another difficulty.

But the question is about the access matrix approach's difficulty. So which of these is among the options given as a correct answer.

Looking for the best option that's correct.

Wait, the options are the possible correct answers (A to J). So each option is a statement about the access matrix approach's difficulties.

So all the correct options (C, D, E, J) are correct, but the question is likely to have one correct answer.

Wait, the question is about the access matrix approach's difficulty. So the question is which of these is a reason why it's difficult.

The options are:

A: extensive computational power.

B: unable to express complex requirements.

C: large matrix, clumsy to manage.

D: cannot be modified.

E: cannot share.

F: no way to express who has access.

G: not providing enough protection.

H: no way to express access hierarchy.

J: matrix not stored directly can cause failure.

So the question is which is a difficulty.

So the access matrix approach's difficulty includes:

- It requires computational power to manage the matrix (A is incorrect because it's not a difficulty, but an advantage).

- It's complex to express all access rules (B is correct).

- It's difficult to modify rules once it's set up (D is correct).

- It can't be modified, which is a difficulty (D is correct).

- It can't share resources between processes (E is correct).

- It can't express access hierarchy (H is correct).

- It can't be stored directly to cause system failure (J is correct).

But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps only one option is correct. Wait, the question is a single-choice, so I need to pick which is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is: The access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that [something]. So which of these is a difficulty.

So the options are C, D, E, J.

But the question is asking which is a difficulty, so perhaps several are correct, but only one is an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about what's a difficulty, so which of these is a known difficulty.

Looking up, I remember that the access matrix approach has several limitations. One of the main difficulties is that once the matrix is created, it's difficult to modify it, which makes D correct.

Another difficulty is that the matrix can't be modified, which is also D. But perhaps C is another issue.

Wait, the options are:

A: extensive computational power. (I think this is correct because managing a large matrix needs a lot of computation.)

B: cannot express complex requirements. (B is correct, but not the difficulty.)

C: large and clumsy. (C is correct.)

D: cannot be modified. (D is correct.)

E: cannot share. (E is correct.)

F: no way to express rights. (F is correct.)

G: insufficient protection. (G is correct.)

H: access hierarchy. (H is correct.)

J: not storing directly. (J is correct.)

So each of the options C, D, E, J are correct statements about difficulties. But the question is asking which is a difficulty (so correct options). Since the question is a single choice, perhaps the intended correct answer is C, because it's a major difficulty.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the access matrix approach's difficulties, and the correct answer is C. Because it's a well-known limitation in such systems.

Alternatively, another thought: the access matrix approach can be implemented as a table, which is manageable. But if the matrix is too large, it's difficult to manage and maintain. So C is a difficulty.

Alternatively, the problem is that the access matrix can't be modified once it's created, which is a big issue, so D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of what the access matrix approach is used for. It's often used in security and access control, where each user has their own set of permissions. The matrix shows who can access what.

So, if the matrix is large, it's hard to manage. So C is correct.

Alternatively, the matrix can't be modified because once the access rules are set, you can't change them without rewriting the entire matrix. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which of these is the difficulty. So all four (C, D, E, J) are difficulties, but the options are individual choices. So the question is multiple-choice, and only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps looking for the most accurate statement.

The access matrix approach has several challenges. One of the main issues is the complexity of the matrix and the difficulty in managing it, which points to option C. Another is the inability to modify the matrix, which is option D. Also, the matrix can't be stored directly for sharing, which is J.

But the question is which is a difficulty. So all these are correct. So perhaps the options are not all correct, but the question is which is a correct statement.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which of the following is a difficulty, meaning the correct answer is one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because the matrix is large and difficult to manage.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is C, because it's a major issue. The access matrix approach is often implemented as a matrix, which can be large, so managing that can be difficult.

Another thought: some systems might require the matrix to be stored in a way that's accessible and not vulnerable. So if it's not stored directly, it can cause issues, leading to system failure, which is option J. But is that a difficulty or a feature?

Alternatively, the difficulty is that it's difficult to modify the matrix, which is option D.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. But I think the access matrix approach's main difficulties are that it's difficult to manage (C), difficult to modify (D), and difficult to share (E). But the question is asking for which option is a difficulty, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, as it's a major difficulty. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: look for the answer among the options. Let's think about each option's correctness.

Option C: the matrix is large and can be clumsy to manage. Yes, that's a well-known difficulty.

Option D: the matrix can't be modified once it's created. Yes, that's another major difficulty.

Option E: the matrix can't share resources. Correct.

Option J: the matrix can't be stored directly. Correct.

But the question is about what's a difficulty, so all four options are correct. But I can only select one.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the matrix can't be modified, which is a big issue, making D the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about the access matrix approach's difficulty. So, the correct answer is C, D, E, or J.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C. Because the access matrix is large. But I think D is a big difficulty because it's hard to change rules once the matrix is set up.

Alternatively, perhaps the access matrix approach's main difficulty is that it's large. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the matrix can be modified, but for some systems, it can't, making D a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another way. The question is asking which is a difficulty. So I need to pick the statement that is a known difficulty.

The access matrix approach's main issues include:

- It's large and difficult to manage.

- It can't be modified once created.

- It can't be stored directly for system sharing.

- It can't express access hierarchy.

So all these are correct, but the question is asking for which is a difficulty, so perhaps the answer is C, which is a known difficulty.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the best approach is to think about which of these is presented as a challenge. I remember that the access matrix approach often requires a lot of computational resources when managing a large system, so option A is about computational resources, which is a difficulty. But the question is asking about which is a difficulty, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But another thought: the access matrix approach can't be modified, which is a big problem. So D is correct.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to recall that the access matrix approach's main issues include:

- The matrix is large and cumbersome.

- It can't be modified after creation.

- It can't be stored directly for sharing.

- It can't be used to express a hierarchy.

So the question is about which is a difficulty. So all the options C, D, E, and J are correct.

But the question is a single-choice. So maybe the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Given that, I think the correct answer is C because the access matrix can be very large and hard to manage. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because once the matrix is created, you can't change it, which is a big issue.

Wait, but I think the access matrix approach's main difficulty in managing is the matrix's size. So the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I think I'll have to go with C. Because it's a big issue.

The access matrix approach to protection has several limitations, and the question asks which of the given options represents a difficulty associated with it. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: It requires extensive computational power. While this can be a challenge, it is not necessarily a difficulty but rather a feature of the approach. This option is incorrect in the context of identifying a difficulty.

- **Option B**: It is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. This is incorrect because access control systems, including the access matrix approach, can handle complex requirements.

- **Option C**: The matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage. This is a well-known difficulty of the access matrix approach, as large matrices can be cumbersome and error-prone to maintain.

- **Option D**: The matrix cannot be modified once it is created. This is a significant limitation of the access matrix approach, as once rules are set, changes become difficult. This is a major difficulty.

- **Option E**: It does not allow for the sharing of resources between processes. This is another limitation but not as central as modifying the matrix.

- **Option F**: There is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself. This is not a difficulty but rather a feature of the approach.

- **Option G**: It does not provide sufficient protection against external threats. While this is a limitation, it is not the primary difficulty.

- **Option H**: There is no way to express the hierarchy of access rights within the matrix. This is a significant limitation, as it prevents clear organization of permissions.

- **Option J**: The matrix, if not stored directly, can cause system failure. This is a potential issue but not the primary difficulty.

After evaluating each option, the most comprehensive and well-known difficulty associated with the access matrix approach is the inability to modify the matrix once it is created (Option D). This makes it the best choice among the given options.
