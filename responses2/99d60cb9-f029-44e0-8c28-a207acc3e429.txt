Okay, so I've got this question about GDP and the GDP deflator. Hmm, I remember that real GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in a given year, adjusted for inflation. Oh wait, the formula is something like real GDP equals nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think. Oh right, I think it's real GDP equals nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator, but then multiplied by 100 or something? Or wait, no, maybe it's nominal GDP divided by the deflator. 

Wait, the formula is real GDP = nominal GDP / (GDP deflator / 100). Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. The GDP deflator is a measure of the general level of prices of all new, domestically produced goods and services. It's calculated as (nominal GDP / real GDP) * 100. So if I rearrange that, real GDP = nominal GDP * (GDP deflator / 100). Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the GDP deflator is: GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100. So if I solve for Real GDP, I can rearrange this equation. Let's see:

GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100

So, to solve for Real GDP, I can rearrange this.

Real GDP = (Nominal GDP * 100) / GDP deflator.

Wait, let me write it out step by step.

Starting with:

GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100

I want to solve for Real GDP, so I'll multiply both sides by Real GDP:

GDP deflator * Real GDP = 100 * Nominal GDP

Then divide both sides by GDP deflator:

Real GDP = (100 * Nominal GDP) / GDP deflator

Wait, but wait, that would be Real GDP equals (Nominal GDP multiplied by 100) divided by the GDP deflator. But wait, that doesn't make much sense because if the deflator is higher, real GDP would be lower, but let's plug in the numbers given.

In this question, the nominal GDP is $6000, and the GDP deflator is 200. So plugging in:

Real GDP = (6000 * 100) / 200.

Wait, 6000 times 100 is 600000. Divided by 200 gives 3000. So Real GDP is $3000.

Looking at the options, option G is $30, which is $3000 divided by 100. Wait, oh wait, because the options are in dollars without the comma, so $3000 would be option G, but $30 is option G, but wait, the calculations I did give $3000, which is $3000, so the correct option is G? Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options again:

A: $4,000
B: $6,000
C: $12,000 
D: $2,000
E: $1,200 
F: $1,500
G: $30 
H: $1,800
I: $2,400
J: $3,000 

Wait, I calculated $3000, but the options don't have 3000. Oh wait, no. Wait, the options have options labeled with numbers, but the actual value is the numbers written without the comma. Wait, no, the question says real GDP equals what. So 3000 dollars would be $3000. Looking at the options, option J is $3,000, which is written as 3000. So the correct answer would be option J.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Because 6000 divided by 200 is 30, but that's nominal GDP divided by deflator. Wait, no, the formula is real GDP = nominal GDP / (GDP deflator / 100). Wait, let me do the calculation again.

Alternatively, sometimes the GDP deflator is given as the base year's price level. So perhaps the correct formula is real GDP = nominal GDP * (base year's price level / current year's price level). The base year's price level would be 100, and current year's is 200. So real GDP = 6000 * (100/200) = 6000 * 0.5 = 3000. So yeah, that's $3000. But wait, the options don't have $3000; the closest is J, which is $3,000. So the correct answer would be option J.

To calculate real GDP, use the formula:

\[
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP Deflator}} \times 100
\]

Plugging in the given values:

\[
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{6000}{200} \times 100 = 30 \times 100 = 3000
\]

However, the options provided do not include $3,000. Instead, option J corresponds to $3,000. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
