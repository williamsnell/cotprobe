Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about correlation and its implications. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there's a correlation of r = 0.9 between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs. Then, the options are A to J, each making a different conclusion. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that a correlation coefficient, r, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The value ranges from -1 to 1. A positive r means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase. A value of 1 would indicate a perfect positive correlation, and 0 would indicate no correlation.

So, in this case, r is 0.9, which is a strong positive correlation. That suggests that as the number of study hours per day increases, students tend to have higher GPAs. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.

Now, looking at the options. Option H says that 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours. Wait, that doesn't sound quite right. I think the coefficient of determination is r squared, which represents the proportion of variance explained by the model. So, for r=0.9, r squared is 0.81, which is 81%. So that's 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours. So option H is wrong because it says 90% when it's actually 81%.

Option A says 90% of the variation in study hours can be explained by GPAs. That doesn't make sense because variation in study hours is not being explained by GPAs. It's the other way around. So A is incorrect.

Option B claims that if a student studies less, their GPA will always decrease. Correlation doesn't imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other. So B is a possible conclusion but it's not necessarily true. It's a possible statement, but the question asks for a reasonable conclusion. So maybe that's a possible answer, but it's not the best option.

Option C says 90% of students who study receive high grades. Again, correlation doesn't mean causation. It just shows that as study hours increase, GPAs tend to increase. So this isn't a valid conclusion. It's a possible statement but not supported by the data.

Option D says 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours. Wait, that's the same as option H's incorrect statement. So D is incorrect because it's the same as H, which is wrong.

Option E states the correlation is not significant. But a correlation of 0.9 is very strong. It's well above the typical significance thresholds (like 0.05 or 0.10). So E is incorrect.

Option F says 81% of students who study receive high grades. Similar reasoning as C. No, it's a possible statement but not supported by the data.

Option G suggests that 90% of students who study a lot get low grades. Again, that's a possible statement but incorrect because it's mixing causation with correlation.

Option I says if a student studies more, their GPA will always increase. That's a strong statement. It's possible, but again, correlation doesn't mean causation. It could be that study hours are a factor, but other variables might influence the outcome. So I's possible, but not necessarily true.

Option J says 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. That's similar to C and G. It's a possible statement, but it's incorrect because it's not supported by the data.

So, reviewing the options, the only true conclusion is H, which is incorrect. The correct statement about the correlation is that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours, which is option H. But wait, option H says 90%—no, wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, option H says 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained. Oh wait, no—option H: "90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours." That's incorrect because the coefficient of determination is r squared, which is 0.81, so 81% of GPAs vary due to study hours. So H is wrong.

Wait, wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.

The correlation coefficient, r, is 0.9. So the coefficient of determination is r² = 0.81. So 81% of GPAs can be explained by study hours. So the correct statement is that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours. Looking at the options, that would be option H? Let me check the options again.

Option H: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day. Oh wait, no—this is the other way around. So if H says 90% of GPAs can be explained by study hours, that's incorrect because the correct value is 81%. So H is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Let me look again at each option.

Option H: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours. No, the correct is 81%, so H is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list the correct implications.

r = 0.9 → r² = 0.81 → 81% of the variation in one variable is explained by the other.

But in the context of the options, which variable is explained by which?

Wait, the question is about the relationship between study hours and GPAs. So the general statement is that the variation in one is explained by the other. So for example, variation in study hours explains 81% of the variation in GPAs, or variation in GPAs explains 81% of the variation in study hours? Wait, the coefficient of determination is the square of r, and it doesn't matter which variable you're looking at because it's symmetric. So the proportion of variance in one variable explained by the other is r squared.

So, for our case, 0.81, so 81% of the variation in, say, study hours is explained by GPAs, or 81% of the variation in GPAs is explained by study hours.

Looking at the options:

Option H: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours. So 90% of GPAs variation is explained by study hours. That's 81% is correct, so option H is incorrect.

Wait no, because 0.81 is 81%, so the correct statement is that 81% of the variation in one variable is explained by the other.

So, in the options, which option correctly states that 81% of variation in GPAs is explained by study hours?

Let me go through each option.

Option A: 90% of study hours can be explained by GPAs. No, because it's the other way around.

Option B: If a student studies less, their GPA will always decrease. No, correlation doesn't imply causation.

Option C: 90% of students who study receive high grades. Again, correlation doesn't imply the cause.

Option D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours. Yes, that's correct. So option D is correct.

Wait, but option D says 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours—so that's correct. So for instance, 81% of the variation in GPAs is explained by variation in study hours. So option D is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The options go as:

D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.

So that's correct.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The correlation coefficient \( r = 0.9 \) indicates a strong positive relationship between study hours and GPAs. The coefficient of determination \( r^2 = 0.81 \), meaning 81% of the variation in one variable can be explained by the other. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It reverses the relationship and misrepresents the correlation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Correlation does not imply causation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It misrepresents the relationship between study hours and GPAs.
- **Option D**: Correct. It accurately states that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. A correlation does not imply significance.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It misrepresents the relationship.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. It misrepresents the relationship.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It reverses the relationship and misrepresents the percentage.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It misrepresents the relationship.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. It misrepresents the relationship.

The correct conclusion is **D**, as it accurately reflects the explained variation in GPAs by study hours.
