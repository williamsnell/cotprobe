Okay, so I've got this question about earnings per share. Hmm, I remember that EPS is a measure of a company's profitability. Let me think. The question says VelcoCorporation shows a profit to common shareholders of $5,250. And they have 1,250 shares outstanding. I need to find the EPS.

Wait, earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income by the number of shares. So the formula should be EPS = Net Income / Shares. Right. So Net income here is $5,250. Shares are 1,250.

Let me do the math. 5,250 divided by 1,250. Hmm, what's that equal? Let me see. 1,250 goes into 5,250 how many times. I know that 1,250 times 4 is 5,000. So 5,250 minus 5,000 is 250. So 250 left. 1,250 goes into 250 0.2 times because 1,250 * 0.2 is 250. So 4 + 0.2 = 4.2. So the EPS is $4.20.

Looking at the options: A is $6.00, B $4.00, C $5.25, D $5.00, E $2.50, F $3.50, G $4.50, H $3.00, I $7.00, J $4.20. Oh, J is $4.20. So the correct answer should be option J.

The correct answer is found by dividing the net income of $5,250 by the number of shares outstanding, 1,250. This calculation yields $4.20 per share. 

Answer: J: $4.20
