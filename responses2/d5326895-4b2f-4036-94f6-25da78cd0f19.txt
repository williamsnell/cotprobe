Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is asking about what the MSD is in the decimal number system. Hmm, I remember that MSD stands for the most significant digit. Wait, what's that exactly? The most significant digit is the first digit when you write the number from left to right. Like, in 123, the MSD is 1. So the options are about where it is located.

Looking at the options: A is first two digits from right, which would be the last two digits. B is the median, which is the middle value. C is first digit from right, the least significant. D is first digit from left, which is definitely MSD. E is mode, which is the most frequent digit. F is last digit from left, which is LSD. G is mean, average. H is middle digit, so not MSD. I is first two from left, which is MSD and the next digit.

So the correct answer should be D: First digit from left to right. I think that makes sense because MSD is the first digit when you read the number from left to right.
