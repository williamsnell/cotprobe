Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the electrolysis of molten magnesium bromide. Hmm, electrolysis—right, that's the process where electricity is used to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. I remember that when you electrolyse a solution, you're breaking it down into its components.

The question is asking about what products are formed. The options are a bunch of combinations of ions. I think I should think about what happens during electrolysis. For electrolysis, the anode is where oxidation happens, and the cathode is where reduction occurs. 

Wait, magnesium metal and bromine are in the molten solution. So in the electrolyte, the ions are Mg²+ and Br⁻. Now, when you apply an electric current, the oppositely charged species will move.

So, at the cathode (reduction), we look for the species that gets reduced. Which ions get reduced? Mg²+ is reduced to Mg metal, and Br⁻ is reduced to Br₂. So, at the cathode, Mg²+ goes to Mg, and Br₂ is formed. 

At the anode (oxidation), the species that gets oxidized is the one with the higher oxidation state. So, in MgBr₂, the Mg²+ is Mg in +2 oxidation state, and Br⁻ is -1. When oxidized, Mg²+ will lose electrons to become Mg (0). Br⁻ is more likely to be oxidized to Br₂ because oxidation is losing electrons. So at the anode, Br⁻ is oxidized to Br₂.

Wait, so putting it together. At cathode: Mg²+ → Mg, and at anode: Br⁻ → Br₂. So what's the electrolysis outcome? It produces Mg metal at the cathode and Br₂ at the anode. 

Looking at the options, option D says Mg at cathode and Br₂ at anode. So that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check the options. Option D is: D: magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode. Yep, that matches what I thought.

The electrolysis of molten magnesium bromide involves breaking the solution into its constituent ions and species. Magnesium bromide dissociates into Mg²⁺ and Br⁻ ions. During electrolysis, the anode undergoes oxidation, where the species with the higher oxidation state (Mg²⁺) is oxidized to Mg metal. The cathode undergoes reduction, where Br⁻ is reduced to Br₂ gas. Therefore, the products are magnesium metal at the cathode and bromine gas at the anode. 

The correct answer is:

**D: magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode**

Answer: D
