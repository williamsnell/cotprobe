Question:

A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been "squatters" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?

Options:

A: Call her previous physician to obtain more history
B: Order a chest x-ray
C: Order a test for HIV antibody
D: Repeat the PPD skin test

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the scenario is a 3-year-old white girl comes to the office after having a 5-TU PPD skin test done as part of a routine screening for a homeless shelter. The parents are shocked because both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They were born in this country, and their daughter has always been healthy. They've been squatters before, now in a shelter, and have not had much medical care in the past two years. The question is about the appropriate next step for the parent.

The possible answers are A through J, but the options given are A to D.

The question is about interpreting a PPD skin test result. I remember that the PPD test is used to detect lichen sclerosus, which is a fungal infection. So, the 5-TU (Typical Uncontrolled Urea) indicates it's a significant infection.

The exam shows 10 mm of induration. That's pretty high. Usually, if the induration is too deep, a medical professional would recommend further testing. But in this case, the parents are shocked and maybe think their child might have a fungal infection, which could be serious.

The parents' previous tests were nonreactive, which is concerning if there's a possible infection. However, a single test might not be enough unless it's a high-risk case.

Looking at the options:

A: Call previous physician for more history. That might help, but if the PPD is positive, maybe the parent doesn't need more info. But if the infection is a concern, the parent might want to see a specialist.

B: Order chest X-ray. That would check for other issues like heart problems, kidney issues, etc. But for a child with PPD, the PPD test is specific and might lead to a positive result, so a chest X-ray could rule out other problems.

C: Order HIV test. The PPD test is about lichen sclerosus; HIV isn't typically the reason for that. Unless the infection was due to HIV, but I don't think that's the case here.

D: Repeat PPD. Well, if the first test was positive, maybe a repeat is unnecessary. But the parents are shocked, so perhaps they don't want to miss any signs.

Wait, but the PPD test was 5-TU, which is a high grade. That's a significant finding. So the PPD is positive, which suggests it's a serious infection. So maybe the parent should get a follow-up. But why would they be shocked? It's concerning, so perhaps they want to have further evaluation to confirm and address the issue.

So, what's the best step? The parents are shocked because both their tests were nonreactive, and the child's PPD was positive. They might think the child has a serious infection, but they are concerned about the child's health. They probably don't want to recommend further tests unless necessary.

So, the options are:

A: Call previous physician. Maybe if the PPD is positive, they don't need the parent's info. But the parent might want to get more details on their own.

B: X-ray. This would help rule out other conditions, but since the PPD is positive, maybe they just need to see if there are other issues.

C: HIV test. Unlikely, but possible if the infection was HIV. But since PPD is high, it's more likely lichen sclerosus.

D: Repeat PPD. Unnecessary if positive, but maybe the parent wants to make sure.

But wait, the PPD test was 5-TU. So, if it's positive, the parent might not need further tests. But the parents are shocked, so maybe they don't want to rule other possibilities and instead want to have a follow-up. If the PPD is positive, perhaps they should get a repeat or a more thorough evaluation.

Alternatively, if the PPD is positive, a follow-up is needed. However, the question is, which is the most appropriate step. So, maybe the PPD is positive, so they should order another test. But why would they be shocked? Because their own tests were nonreactive, but the child's is positive.

Wait, but the question is about the most appropriate step for the parent. So, perhaps the parent doesn't know about the child yet, so they have to get another test. So the correct answer would be D: Repeat the PPD skin test. Because the first test was positive, the parent might want to confirm.

Alternatively, if the PPD is positive, the parent may not need to do anything else, but if they don't know, then they might need to. So the parent is shocked, perhaps because they thought it wasn't serious, but the PPD is positive.

So the step would be to order another PPD test because the first one was positive. So the answer is D.

The 5-TU PPD skin test result is significant, indicating lichen sclerosus, which is a fungal infection. The parent is shocked by this finding, as their own skin tests were nonreactive, and the child's test is positive. While a PPD positive result would typically warrant further evaluation, the parent is concerned about the child's health and may not want to rule out other issues. 

Considering the options, the most appropriate step is to repeat the PPD skin test to confirm the infection. This ensures the parent can assess the child's health and address any potential issues.
