Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Oh right, it's about a grain of sand falling and converting gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. The question is asking for the height it must fall from to have the same kinetic energy as a quantum of visible light with a certain frequency.

Hmm. I remember that the energy of a quantum (or photon) is given by E = h*f, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency. Oh wait, right, visible light has frequencies in the visible spectrum, so this one is 5e14 seconds^-1. That's a really high frequency, which makes sense because visible light is around 4e14 Hz to 7e14 Hz.

Wait, so first I need to calculate the energy of that photon. Let me jot that down. h is Planck's constant. I think h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. And frequency f is 5e14 Hz. So E = h*f. Let me compute that.

Calculating E: 6.626e-34 J·s * 5e14 s^-1. Let's see, 6.626 *5 is about 33.13, then the exponents: 1e-34 * 1e14 = 1e-20. So E is 33.13e-20 J. Wait, that's 3.313e-19 J. Hmm, wait no, 33.13e-20 is 3.313e-19, right. So E is approximately 3.313e-19 J.

But wait, maybe I should use more precise numbers. Let me think: 6.626e-34 multiplied by 5e14. 6.626 *5 is 33.13. So yes, 33.13e-20, which is 3.313e-19 J. So the photon's energy is about 3.313e-19 J.

Now, the grain of sand has a mass of 1e-5 grams. Oh wait, grams to kilograms. So 1e-5 grams is 1e-8 kg. Because 1 kg is 1e3 grams, so 1e-5 grams is 1e-5/1e3 = 1e-8 kg.

The kinetic energy of the sand is equal to the photon's energy. So KE = (1/2) m v^2. But wait, the sand is falling from rest, so its initial velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is (1/2) m * v^2, but wait, that's for velocity. Alternatively, since it's starting from rest, the KE will be (1/2) m h, where h is the height it falls? Wait, no, the gravitational potential energy is mgh. Oh, right, because when an object falls a height h, the potential energy decreases by mgh, and that converts into kinetic energy.

So the kinetic energy gained is mgh. So we can set that equal to the photon's energy.

So mgh = E_photon.

Solving for h: h = E_photon / (m g).

Wait, but what's g? That's the acceleration due to gravity. I think it's approximately 9.8 m/s².

Wait, so let's plug in the numbers.

m is 1e-8 kg, E_photon is 3.313e-19 J. g is 9.8 m/s².

So h = (3.313e-19 J) / (1e-8 kg * 9.8 m/s² )

Calculating denominator: 1e-8 *9.8 = 9.8e-8.

So h = 3.313e-19 / 9.8e-8.

Let me compute that. 3.313e-19 divided by 9.8e-8.

So 3.313e-19 / 9.8e-8 = (3.313 /9.8) * 1e-11.

3.313 /9.8 ≈ 0.338. So 0.338 * 1e-11 m.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. Let's compute 3.313 / 9.8.

3.313 /9.8: 9.8 is about 10, so 3.313/10=0.3313. But since 9.8 is slightly less than 10, it'll be a bit higher. Let me do exact division.

9.8 × 0.338 is about 3.3124. Oh, wait, 9.8 * 0.338 = let's compute 0.338 *10 is 3.38, minus 0.2*0.338=0.2756, wait no, perhaps a better approach.

Wait, let me compute 3.313 divided by 9.8.

Let me write it as 3.313 ÷ 9.8.

3.313 /9.8 = ?

We can think of it as (3.313) * (1/9.8) ≈ 3.313 * 0.1020408.

Because 1/9.8 ≈ 0.1020408.

3.313 * 0.1020408 ≈ Let's compute:

3 * 0.1020408 = 0.3061224

0.313 * 0.1020408 ≈ 0.03200 approximately.

So total about 0.3061224 + 0.03200 ≈ 0.3381224.

So approximately 0.3381.

So h ≈ 0.3381e-11 meters, which is 3.381e-12 meters.

Wait, wait. Wait, 3.381e-12 meters is 3.381e-10 cm, because 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 1e-12 m is 1e-10 cm.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm. So 1e-12 meters is (1e-12) * (100 cm/m) )= 1e-10 cm.

So h is approximately 3.381e-10 cm.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.38e-10 cm.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check all the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Because 1e-12 meters is 0.0000000001 meters, which is 1e-10 cm, since 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 m =100 cm.

Wait, no. Let me think: 1 m is 100 cm. So 1 cm is 1e-2 m.

Wait, so 1e-12 meters is 1e-12 m = (1e-12 m) / (1e-2 m/cm) )= 1e-10 cm.

So if h is 3.38e-12 m, that's 3.38e-10 cm.

Which is option E: 3.38 × 10^-10 cm.

But wait, let me re-examine the initial calculation.

Wait, mass of sand is 10^-5 grams. Oh, wait: 1 gram is 1e-3 kg, so 10^-5 grams is 1e-5 * 1e-3 kg = 1e-8 kg. So that's correct.

Energy of photon: h*f. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. f=5e14. So 6.626e-34 *5e14 = 3.313e-20? Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, 6.626e-34 *5e14 = 6.626 *5 is 33.13, and exponents 1e-34 *1e14 = 1e-20. So 33.13e-20 is 3.313e-19 J, that's correct.

So then, E = m g h.

h= E/(m g) = 3.313e-19 / (1e-8 *9.8 )

Calculating denominator: 1e-8 *9.8 =9.8e-8.

So 3.313e-19 /9.8e-8 = (3.313 /9.8) * 1e-11.

As earlier, 3.313 /9.8 is approximately 0.338.

So 0.338e-11 m is 3.38e-12 m.

Which is 3.38e-10 cm.

That matches option E:3.38e-10 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A:4.2e-10

B:7.5e-10

C:2.5e-10

D:8e-11

E:3.38e-10

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait. Another thing: energy of a photon is E= h f. Are there any other factors I should consider? Like relativistic effects or something else? The problem states it's the kinetic energy, so I think we're okay with using mgh.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the gravitational potential energy, but since the mass is so small and the height is so small, it's probably negligible. So E_gravity = mgh.

Wait, also, perhaps using the kinetic energy as (1/2) m v², but since it's falling from rest, v² = 2gh. So mgh = (1/2) m (2gh) → which brings us back to mgh= mgh, so no, same as before.

So I think the calculation is correct.

To determine the height a grain of sand must fall from to have a kinetic energy equal to the energy of a quantum of visible light with a frequency of \( f = 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}^{-1} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the energy of the photon**:  
   The energy of a photon is given by \( E = h f \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant and \( f = 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}^{-1} \) is the frequency.  
   \[
   E = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (5 \times 10^{14}) = 3.313 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Convert the mass of the grain of sand**:  
   The mass of the grain is \( m = 10^{-5} \, \text{g} \), which is equivalent to \( m = 10^{-8} \, \text{kg} \).

3. **Set up the energy equation**:  
   The kinetic energy gained by the sand is equal to its gravitational potential energy, \( m g h \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity.  
   \[
   m g h = E.
   \]

4. **Solve for height \( h \)**:  
   Rearranging for \( h \):  
   \[
   h = \frac{E}{m g}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   h = \frac{3.313 \times 10^{-19}}{(10^{-8}) \times 9.8}.
   \]  
   Simplify the denominator:  
   \[
   m g = 10^{-8} \times 9.8 = 9.8 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]  
   Now calculate \( h \):  
   \[
   h = \frac{3.313 \times 10^{-19}}{9.8 \times 10^{-8}} = \frac{3.313}{9.8} \times 10^{-11}.
   \]  
   Perform the division:  
   \[
   \frac{3.313}{9.8} \approx 0.338.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   h \approx 0.338 \times 10^{-11} = 3.38 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Convert height to centimeters**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm} \), \( 1 \, \text{m} = 10^2 \, \text{cm} \). Therefore:  
   \[
   h = 3.38 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} = 3.38 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{cm}.
   \]

6. **Compare with options**:  
   The calculated height \( 3.38 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{cm} \) matches option **E**.
