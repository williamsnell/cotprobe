Okay, so I have this question about Jack's commission. Let me try to figure it out. The question says he gets a 5% commission on all sales, and his sales for the week are $1,200. I need to find out how much he earns in commission.

Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember how they work. So, a 5% commission means he gets 5% of $1,200. To calculate that, I should multiply 1,200 by 5% or 0.05.

Wait, let me write that down. 5% as a decimal is 0.05. So, I multiply 1,200 by 0.05. Let's do the math. 1,200 times 0.05. Oh wait, 0.05 is the same as 5 per 100, so 1% of 1,200 is 12, right? Because 1% is 12, so 5% is 12 multiplied by 5. 12 times 5 is 60. So, 60.

Let me double-check that. Alternatively, 1,200 divided by 20 is 60 because 20% of 1,200 is 240, so 10% is 120, 5% is half of that, which is 60. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A is $60, which matches what I calculated. Let me quickly glance through the other options to make sure none of them match. B is $12, which is 1%, not 5%. C is $120, that's 10% of 1,200. D is $50, which is 4.166...%. E is $30, that's 2.5%. F is $5, which is 0.416...%. G is $150, which would be 12.5% of 1,200. H is $240, which is 20%, and I is $300, which is 25%. J is $600, which is 50%, so that's way too high. So, the only correct answer is A, $60.
