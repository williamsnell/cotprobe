Question:

Show how two clocks, one at the origin and the other a dis-tance d from the origin, may be synchronized.

Options:

A: The other clock should be pre-set to the current time, assuming instantaneous signal travel time from the origin
B: The other clock should be synchronized using sound waves instead of light
C: The other clock should be pre-set to the current time minus d/c
D: The other clock should be pre-set so that it reads 12:00 o'clock plus d/c
E: The other clock should be pre-set so that it reads d/c past the time on the origin clock
F: The other clock should be pre-set to exactly 12:00 o'clock
G: The other clock should be pre-set to an arbitrary time unrelated to the origin clock and distance d
H: The other clock should be pre-set so that it reads the current time minus the time it takes light to travel distance d

Okay, so I have this question about how to synchronize two clocks, one at the origin and another at a distance d away. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Wait, when you want to keep two clocks in sync, especially when one is at a distance away, you need to send a signal that the other clock should be ahead or behind. Oh right, because light takes time to travel. So if the origin clock is running slow, the other clock needs to be set ahead so that when the signal arrives, the origin clock can catch up.

So the options are about how to calculate that offset. Let me look at the choices.

Option A says the other clock should be pre-set to current time, assuming instantaneous signal. That doesn't make sense because signals take time. So A is probably wrong.

Option B suggests using sound waves instead of light. Well, sound travels much slower than light, so that's not going to work unless d is really small. But the question probably expects a method based on light, so B might not be the best choice.

Option C: pre-set to current time minus d/c. Wait, c is the speed of light. So d divided by c gives the time it takes light to travel distance d. So if the origin clock is behind, the other clock should be set to current time minus that time. That makes sense because the signal takes t = d/c time to reach the origin. So if the origin time is T, the other clock must be ahead by t to catch up. So the other clock's time would be T - t.

Option D says pre-set to 12:00 plus d/c. That doesn't seem right. Plus time, not minus. Because the origin time is behind, so the other clock should be set back.

Option E: pre-set so it reads d/c past the origin time. That's the same as option C, phrased differently. So E is the same as C.

Option F: pre-set to 12:00, which doesn't make sense because it's arbitrary. Not useful.

Option G: arbitrary. Not useful for synchronization.

Option H: pre-set to current time minus d/c. That's the same as option C and E.

So, the correct formula is T_other = T_origin - (d/c). Because the origin is behind, the other clock's time is earlier when the signal arrives.

So looking at the choices, both E and H are the same, but in the options, they're presented as separate options. Wait, looking back, option E says "pre-set so that it reads d/c past the time on origin", which is T_origin + (d/c), which would mean the other clock is ahead. That's not right. But option H says "pre-set so that it reads the current time minus the time it takes light to travel distance d." So that's T_origin - (d/c). So both H and E are correct in their phrasing, but H is more precise.

So the correct answer should be H. But wait, looking back, the other option is E: "pre-set so that it reads d/c past the time on the origin clock." So that would be T_origin + (d/c), which would make the other clock ahead. But that's the opposite of what we need. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but the question is about pre-setting the other clock. How do you calculate the difference? The correct formula is T_other = T_origin - (d/c). So when the origin clock is at T, the other clock should be set to T - (d/c). So that would be option E or H.

Wait, looking at the options again, option H is "pre-set so that it reads the current time minus the time it takes light to travel distance d." Which is exactly T_origin - (d/c), which is correct. So H is correct, but E is T_origin + (d/c), which would be wrong.

So the correct answer is E? No, because it's opposite. Because if the origin is behind, the other should be ahead. So the correct formula is minus.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of time of arrival. The other clock's time is the origin time minus the time light takes to reach it. Because if light takes t time to reach, then the origin clock was at T, but the other clock was ahead by t, so when light arrives, the origin would have advanced by t, so the other clock's time is T - t.

So H says pre-set so that it reads the current time minus the time it takes light to travel d. So yes, that's correct.

So the options are:

H: correct formula.

E: opposite.

So the correct answer would be E if it's the other way, but I think H is correct.

To synchronize two clocks, one at the origin and the other at a distance \(d\) from the origin, the other clock should be pre-set to the current time minus the time it takes for light to travel distance \(d\). This ensures that when the signal from the origin clock reaches the other clock, the origin clock can catch up, thus maintaining synchronization.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A:** Incorrect. Assuming instantaneous signal travel time is invalid.
- **B:** Incorrect. Sound waves are too slow for this purpose.
- **C and E:** Both state that the other clock should be pre-set to the origin time minus \(d/c\). This is correct.
- **D:** Incorrect. Adding time does not correct the lag.
- **F:** Incorrect. Arbitrary time pre-set is not useful.
- **G:** Incorrect. Arbitrary time is unrelated.
- **H:** Correct phrasing, as it accurately describes the formula \(T_{\text{other}} = T_{\text{origin}} - (d/c)\).

### Conclusion:
Both **C** and **E** are correct, but **E** is phrased less precisely. However, since **H** provides a more accurate and precise formula, it is the best choice.
