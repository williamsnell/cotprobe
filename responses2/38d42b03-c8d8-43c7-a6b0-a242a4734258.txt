Okay, so I've got this question here about prime factors and factors of a number. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that a number's prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. I need to figure out which of the options A to H must be a factor of this number. 

First, I remember that the prime factors are the building blocks of a number. So, the number itself is the product of these primes. That means the number is 2 * 5 * 7 * 13 * 31. Let me calculate that in my head. 2*5 is 10, multiplied by 7 is 70, times 13 is 910, and times 31 would be 28210. So the number is 28,210.

Now, the options are A through H. Each is a different number. I need to check which of these must be a factor of 28,210. 

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 10. 10 is 2*5. Since both 2 and 5 are prime factors, their product must divide the number. So 10 is definitely a factor. So A is a possible answer.

Option B: 25. That's 5 squared. Wait, but our prime factors only include 5 once. So 5^2 is not a factor. So B is not a factor.

Option C: 6. 6 is 2*3. Oh wait, our number doesn't have 3 as a prime factor. So 3 isn't included, so 6 can't be a factor. So C isn't the answer.

Option D: 8. That's 2^3. Looking back, the number has 2^1 (since it's 2*5*...). So 8 (2^3) is higher than what we have. So 8 isn't a factor. So D is out.

Option E: 15. 15 is 3*5. The prime factors don't include 3, so 15 isn't a factor. So E is not correct.

Option F: 30. That's 2*3*5. Again, we don't have 3 in the prime factors, so 30 isn't a factor. So F is not correct.

Option G: 20. 20 is 2^2 *5. Our number has 2^1, so 2^2 isn't available. So 20 isn't a factor. So G isn't correct.

Option H:4. That's 2^2. Our number has 2^1, so 2^2 isn't present. So 4 isn't a factor. So H is not correct.

So after evaluating all the options, only option A (10) is a factor of the number. The other options either have primes that are not part of the number's factors or are higher powers of existing primes that aren't present.

The prime factors of the number are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31, meaning the number is 28210. We check each option:

- **A: 10** (2*5) is a factor because both primes are present.
- **B: 25** (5²) is not a factor as 5 appears only once.
- **C: 6** (2*3) lacks 3, not a factor.
- **D: 8** (2³) requires 2³, which isn't available.
- **E: 15** (3*5) lacks 3, not a factor.
- **F: 30** (2*3*5) lacks 3.
- **G: 20** (2²*5) needs 2², unavailable.
- **H: 4** (2²) requires 2², unavailable.

Only **A: 10** is a factor.

Answer: A
