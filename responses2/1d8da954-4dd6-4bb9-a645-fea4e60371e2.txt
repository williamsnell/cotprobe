Okay, so I have this question about calculating the finance charge on an installment plan. Let me see how to approach this. 

The question says the stereo has a cash price of $895. There's an option for a cash down payment and then monthly installments. The down payment is 15%, so I need to find out how much that is first. 

So, 15% of $895 is 0.15 * 895. Let me calculate that. 0.15 * 800 is 120, and 0.15 *95 is 14.25. So total down payment is 120 +14.25 = $134.25. 

That means the amount to be financed is the cash price minus the down payment. So, 895 - 134.25 equals 760.75. Okay, so the amount financed is $760.75.

Now, the installment plan has 30 monthly payments of $29.42 each. I need to find the total amount paid over the 30 months. Let me multiply 29.42 by 30. 29.42 * 30. Hmm, 29 *30 is 870, and 0.42*30 is 12.60. So total is 870 +12.60 = $882.60.

So the total installment cost is $882.60. But wait, the original price after down payment was $760.75. Oh wait, no, that's the amount you paid in installments. But the cash price is $895. So the finance charge is the difference between the installment cost and the amount financed. 

Wait, the amount financed is $760.75, and total installment is $882.60. So finance charge is 882.60 minus 760.75. Let me calculate that. 882.60 -760.75. Let's see: 760 + 122.60 is 882.60, so 760.75 is 760 +0.75. So subtracting: 882.60 -760.75 = (882.60 -760) - 0.75 = 122.60 -0.75 = 121.85. 

Wait, that seems like the finance charge is $121.85. Looking at the options, option E is $121.85. So the answer should be E.

The finance charge is calculated by subtracting the amount financed from the total installment cost. The amount financed is $760.75, and the total installment cost is $882.60. Subtracting these gives a finance charge of $121.85.
