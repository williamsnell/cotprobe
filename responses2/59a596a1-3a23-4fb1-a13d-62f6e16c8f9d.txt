Question:

After a wife found out about her husband's infidelity, she decided to have him killed. The defendant approached a hit man to solicit his assistance in carrying out the planned murder. Although the wife believed that he was a hit man, he was, in fact, an undercover agent. The wife told the undercovr agent she would pay him $20,000 if he accepted the job and an additional $20,000 after the killing was completed. Upon hearing the wife's proposal, the undercover agent told the wife he would kill her husband. However, the undercover agent secretly intended not to go through with the plan, and he merely feigned agreement because he wished to trap the wife. The wife told the undercover agent that she would deliver the first payment the next day. However, before making the initial payment, the wife learned that the hit man was really an undercover agent. Fearful that she might be prosecuted for planning her husband's murder, the wife contacted the police and renounced her participation in the criminal endeavor. The defendant will most likely be found

Okay, so I've got this criminal law question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly.

The question involves a case where a wife wanted to kill her husband but approached a hit man. The hit man is an undercover agent. The scenario is a bit tricky, so I'll need to go through each part carefully.

First, the wife tells the undercover agent she's willing to pay $20k if he accepts the job and another $20k after the killing is done. That sounds like a plan. The agent, on the other hand, secretly intends not to go through with it because he's worried about being prosecuted for planning her husband's murder. So, he feigns agreement anyway. The wife then contacts the police to renounce her part of the plan.

Now, the question is about what the defendant is found guilty of. The options are from A to J, each making a claim about whether he's guilty of solicitation, conspiracy, or attempted murder.

So, let's think about the elements of each crime in question.

1. **Solicitation of Employees (SAS)**: This involves obtaining employment by convincing an employee to work for you. The requirement is that you obtain employment by offering good work, making reasonable demands, and making a reasonable offer. Also, you need to obtain the offer, keep it, and you must keep it for a period.

2. **Conspiracy to Commute (CCC)**: This occurs when someone or something consents to another person committing a crime and is acting in concert with them to commit the crime together, with intent to have the result of the crime occur, but not knowing that they are consents to it.

3. **Attempted Murder (AP)**: This is when someone commits murder with a plan to kill, have the killing committed, but they don't have the intent to kill.

The woman approached the hit man, who is an undercover agent. The hit man said he'd kill her husband. But he feigns agreement because he's worried about prosecution. Then, the wife renounced her involvement because she feared being prosecuted.

So, the key here is the nature of the offer. She approached the agent, who is an undercover agent. She's offering to hire him. The important part is whether she made the offer in a way that counts as SAS.

SAS requires that the offer be made with the intent to keep it, and that the employer (in this case, the agent) works for the employer. But here, the offer is made in a way that's being conspired with her. Wait, the wife's perspectiveâ€”their agreement.

Wait, the main point in this case is that the offer was made with the expectation that the employer (he) would keep it. So, the offer was made with the intent to keep it. So, that would satisfy SAS.

But wait, the woman had the opportunity to pay $20k if he agreed. So, she could have accepted or rejected. But the agent was feigning agreement and kept the offer. But the woman renounced. So, she didn't accept.

Now, in the SAS requirement, you must obtain the offer. So, she made the offer. Then, the agent keeps it, works for the agent, and keeps it for a certain period. But, in this case, she renounced her participation. She didn't accept it.

So, does renouncing the offer count as not having solicited the employment? Or does she still have the offer.

Wait, the woman approached the agent, who is an undercover agent. So, the offer was made by her to work for the agent. The agent is a hit man, but he's an undercover agent, so perhaps that's a different category. But the main point is the offer was made for SAS.

But the key is that she was in the position of trying to get the offer. So, she approached him, who is an undercover agent. The offer was made with the intent to keep it, so that's SAS.

But she renounced her participation. So, she didn't accept the offer. Does that mean she couldn't have solicited the employment because she didn't even try to get it? Or does the fact that she renounced imply she didn't actually make the offer?

Hmm. It's a bit tricky. Let me think of the elements. To obtain SAS, you must obtain the offer, keep it, and keep it for a period. So, if she approached the agent, and the agent offered her the position, then she was soliciting. But she didn't accept. So, perhaps she didn't actually have the offer because she didn't accept it.

Wait, but the hit man is an undercover agent. So, the woman approached the agent, who is an undercover agent. So, she was trying to get the offer, but she also renounced. So, perhaps she didn't actually obtain the offer because she's renouncing.

Wait, but in the scenario, she told the agent she would pay for the first payment the next day. So, she might have accepted the offer, but the agent feigning the agreement. So, the agent didn't keep the offer. But the woman renounced her participation, meaning she didn't accept.

But in the SAS, you must obtain the offer. So, if she obtained the offer, she must keep it. She didn't accept it because she left. So, perhaps she didn't actually get the offer because she didn't accept it. But wait, she approached the agent, who is a potential employee.

Wait, perhaps the point is that the offer was made, but she didn't accept it, so she didn't get the offer, and thus she didn't satisfy SAS. Alternatively, she approached the agent, and the agent would offer to hire her, so she's soliciting the position, but she didn't actually accept it.

But in this case, the hit man was an undercover agent. So, perhaps the offer was made by her to work for the agent, who is an undercover agent. So, the offer is made, but she doesn't accept it because she leaves. So, she didn't obtain the offer, because she didn't accept it.

But wait, the SAS requires that you obtain the offer by making an offer, keeping it, and keeping it for some time. So, if she approached the agent, who is an undercover agent, making the offer, then she must have kept it and obtained it.

But she didn't accept it, so perhaps she didn't actually obtain the offer. Because she didn't take the offer. So, she didn't solicit. So, she maybe didn't obtain the offer, so she didn't have SAS.

But wait, in the scenario, she approached the agent, who is an undercover agent. So, the offer is made, but she didn't accept it. So, is this a case of not having SAS because she didn't accept the offer?

Alternatively, the fact that she renounced her participation might mean she didn't even try to obtain the offer.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option E is "not guilty due to renouncing her participation." So, if she didn't accept, she didn't have SAS. But wait, she approached the agent, who is an undercover agent. So, the offer was made, but she didn't accept it, which might suggest she didn't have SAS.

But wait, she also had the opportunity to pay. So, she might have accepted the offer, but then renounced.

Wait, but the fact that she renounced implies she didn't accept. So, she didn't have SAS because she didn't even approach the offer. No, she approached, but she didn't accept. So, perhaps she didn't have SAS. But wait, SAS requires that you obtain the offer. So, if she approached the agent, who is a potential employee, and the agent would offer her the position, then she is soliciting. But she didn't accept because she left, so she didn't obtain the offer. Therefore, SAS is not satisfied.

But in the scenario, the woman told the agent she'd pay $20k if he agreed, but the agent feigning agreement. So, the woman approached, got the offer, but didn't accept. So, perhaps she didn't actually obtain the offer because she couldn't keep it. Or she kept it but didn't accept.

Wait, the SAS requires that you obtain the offer, keep it, and keep it for a certain time. So, if she approached the agent, and kept the offer, she must have kept it for some time. But if she didn't accept, she didn't keep it. So, she wouldn't have SAS because she didn't keep the offer. Alternatively, if she approached, kept the offer, and then left, she couldn't have obtained it because she didn't accept it.

So, in this case, she approached the agent, kept the offer, and then decided to renounce. So, she didn't accept. So, she didn't have SAS.

But wait, the hit man is an undercover agent. So, perhaps the offer is considered SAS even if it's made by a regular employee because it's a legitimate offer. But the woman approached the agent, who is an undercover agent. So, she is trying to get an offer from an agent who's already working. So, does that count as SAS?

Alternatively, maybe the hit man is just an undercover agent, but the agent is an employee because she's a regular employee. So, the offer is from a regular employee to an undercover agent. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Wait, the question is about the woman and the hit man. The hit man is an undercover agent. So, perhaps the woman approached that agent, who is now an employee. So, that's a regular employee offering to work for an agent who's an employee. But that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the scenario is that the woman approached the hit man, who is an undercover agent, so she's making the offer to an undercover agent. So, the offer is made by a regular employee to an undercover agent. But in any case, in terms of SAS, the key is whether you obtained the offer. So, she approached, kept it, so she obtained it. But she didn't accept, so she didn't keep it for the period. So, she only kept the offer but didn't keep it for the time. So, she didn't actually get SAS because she didn't accept.

Wait, but SAS requires that you obtain the offer, keep it, and keep it for a certain time. So, if she approached, kept it, and then decided to leave, she hasn't kept it for the time. So, she didn't have SAS.

So, the woman didn't have SAS because she didn't accept the offer.

But after she renounced, does that mean she didn't have SAS at all?

Wait, the woman approached the agent, kept the offer, and then renounced. So, she approached, kept the offer, but then left. So, she didn't accept the offer, so she didn't have SAS.

So, the defendant would be found not guilty of SAS.

Now, looking at the options, option E says "not guilty due to renouncing her participation." So, that would match if she didn't accept the offer.

But wait, the hit man is an undercover agent, who's an employee. So, perhaps the offer is considered SAS even if the employer is an agent. Hmm, maybe not. Because the offer is made to an employee, not an agent. So, maybe SAS doesn't apply here.

Wait, but the woman's approach was to the agent, who is an employee (he's an undercover agent). So, the offer is made to an employee, so that's SAS. But she didn't accept. So, she didn't have SAS.

So, the defendant is not guilty of SAS.

But the options don't have an option for SAS. The options are about solicitation and conspiracy.

Wait, but the woman approached the agent, who is an undercover agent, to get the position. So, she's soliciting. But she didn't accept. So, she didn't have SAS.

So, the defense is that she didn't solicit, because she didn't accept.

But the question is about what the defendant will be found guilty of.

So, the options include: A: not guilty of either SAS or conspiracy. B: lack of intent. C: attempted murder. D: SAS and conspiracy. E: not guilty due to renouncing participation.

So, if she didn't accept, she didn't have SAS. So, she would be found not guilty of SAS. She might have had conspiracy, but that's another matter.

Wait, but the hit man was an undercover agent. So, perhaps the hit man and the agent are both involved in SAS.

Wait, the hit man is an undercover agent. So, the woman approached him, who is an agent. So, that's SAS. She approached, kept the offer, and kept it for some time. So, she obtained SAS. But she didn't accept it. So, she only kept the offer but didn't keep it for the time required. So, she didn't have SAS.

So, the defense is that she didn't accept, so she didn't have SAS. Therefore, she wouldn't be found guilty of SAS.

But looking at the options, option E is "not guilty due to renouncing her participation." So, that would be the case if she didn't accept the offer.

But wait, the hit man is an undercover agent. So, perhaps the woman approached him, and the hit man is an agent, so the offer was made to an agent. So, would that count as SAS?

Because SAS requires that you obtain the offer by making an offer, keeping it, and keeping it for a time. So, if the offer was made to an agent (like an undercover agent), the woman approached, kept, and kept it for a time. So, that would count as SAS.

So, she approached, kept the offer, and kept it for a time. So, she obtained SAS.

But she renounced, so she didn't accept. So, she didn't actually keep the offer for the time. So, she didn't have SAS.

Wait, but she approached, kept the offer, and then left. So, she kept the offer, but didn't keep it for the required time. So, she only obtained SAS because she kept the offer, but didn't have it for the time.

So, the defense would be that she didn't accept the offer, so she didn't have SAS.

But the options don't have an option E that matches this scenario, except option E is "not guilty due to renouncing her participation." So, that would be correct if she didn't accept.

Wait, but the hit man is an undercover agent. So, maybe the woman approached an agent, but the agent is an employee. So, perhaps she approached an employee to get the position, so it's SAS. But she didn't accept. So, she didn't have SAS.

So, the defendant is not guilty of SAS.

But the options are about the defendant's guilt. So, the options are:

A: not guilty of either SAS or conspiracy.

B: not guilty due to lack of intent.

C: guilty of attempted murder and SAS.

D: guilty of SAS and conspiracy.

E: not guilty due to renouncing participation.

So, the correct answer would be E. Because she renounced, she didn't accept the offer, so she didn't have SAS.

Alternatively, perhaps she approached, kept the offer, and then left, so she didn't have SAS. So, the answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the hit man is an undercover agent. So, perhaps the offer was made to an agent, which is SAS. But she didn't accept. So, she didn't have SAS.

So, the answer is E.

Another angle: The hit man was an undercover agent. So, the woman approached him, who is an agent, to get the position. So, she's making the offer to an agent. So, SAS applies because she approached, kept the offer, and kept it for a time. So, she obtained SAS. But she renounced, so she didn't accept. Therefore, she didn't have SAS.

So, she's not guilty of SAS. But she may have been guilty of conspiracy, perhaps. But the question is about the options given.

Looking back, the options don't have an option E that says she's not guilty due to SAS. Wait, option E is "not guilty due to renouncing her participation." So, that would apply if she didn't accept the offer, which would lead her to not have SAS. So, she's not guilty of SAS.

But the options don't have an option E that matches this scenario, except option E is "not guilty due to renouncing her participation." So, that's the correct answer.

But wait, the hit man is an undercover agent. So, maybe the offer was made to an agent, which is SAS. But she didn't accept, so she didn't have SAS. So, the defense is E.

Alternatively, maybe she approached the agent, kept the offer, and then left, so she didn't have SAS. So, the answer is E.

So, I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

The case involves a woman who approached an undercover agent (hit man) to secure her husband's murder. The agent offered the woman a commission if she agreed, and she renounced her participation after the killing. The woman didn't accept the offer, which counts as renouncing participation. SAS requires obtaining the offer, keeping it, and keeping it for a certain period. The woman approached the agent, kept the offer, and left, so she didn't have SAS. 

Since she renounced her participation, she wasn't guilty of SAS. The other elements, such as conspiracy to commit murder, weren't directly implicated. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: E
