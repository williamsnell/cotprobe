Okay, so I have this linear algebra problem here. The question says: Let I ≠ A ≠ -I, where I is the identity matrix and A is a real 2x2 matrix. If A equals its inverse, A = A⁻¹, then what is the trace of A? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. For a 2x2 matrix, if A is [[a, b], [c, d]], then the trace is a + d.

The condition given is A = A⁻¹. I also recall that for a matrix A, if A is invertible, then A⁻¹ is the inverse matrix, and their product is the identity matrix. So, A * A⁻¹ = I. But in this case, since A is its own inverse, A * A must be I. So A squared is the identity matrix.

Wait, so A squared equals I, which is the identity matrix. That gives me the equation A² = I. But A is a 2x2 real matrix. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what such matrices look like. I think they might be rotation matrices or something else.

Another property is that the trace of A is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. Since A squared is I, the eigenvalues of A must satisfy λ² = 1 because when you square the matrix, the eigenvalues get squared. So the eigenvalues must be either 1 or -1.

But wait, since A is not the identity matrix (A ≠ I) and not the negative of the identity matrix (A ≠ -I), it can't have all eigenvalues as 1 or all as -1. Because if all eigenvalues are 1, then A would be I, which is not allowed. Similarly, if all eigenvalues are -1, then A would be -I, which is also not allowed here.

So the eigenvalues must be a mix of 1 and -1. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the possible combinations are one 1 and one -1. So the trace, which is the sum of eigenvalues, would be 1 + (-1) = 0. So the trace is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Suppose A is a rotation matrix. For example, a rotation by 180 degrees would have eigenvalues -1 and -1, but that would make A = -I, which isn't allowed here. Alternatively, a rotation by 90 degrees has eigenvalues i and -i, but those are complex, and since A is a real matrix, that wouldn't work either. Hmm, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a permutation matrix, like swapping two basis vectors. Like [[0,1],[1,0]], which is a 2x2 matrix with trace 0 as well. Its square would be the identity matrix. So that's another example where the trace is zero.

Another approach: Let's consider the trace formula. Tr(A) is the sum of the eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, their sum is zero. Therefore, the trace must be zero.

So the answer should be option B: 0.

The condition A = A⁻¹ implies A² = I. The eigenvalues of A must satisfy λ² = 1, so they can be 1 or -1. Since A is neither I nor -I, the eigenvalues must be a mix of 1 and -1, yielding a trace of 0. Thus, the correct answer is **B: 0**.

Answer: B
