Question:

A boy found a bicycle lock for which the combination was unknown. The correct combination is a four-digit number, $d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4$, where $d_i, i=1,2,3,4$, is selected from $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$, and 8 . How many different lock combinations are possible with such a lock?

Options:

A: 32768
B: 8192
C: 2048
D: 1000
E: 7000
F: 256
G:  4096
H: 16384
I: 1024
J: 512

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bicycle lock with a four-digit combination. The digits can be any number from 1 to 8, right? And the question is asking how many different combinations are possible. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, each digit in the combination is chosen from 1 to 8. So for each position — like d1, d2, d3, d4 — there are 8 possible choices. Oh wait, but wait, wait a minute. Wait, the problem says the digits are selected from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So that's 8 options. So for each of the four positions, there are 8 choices.

Now, since the combination is four digits, and each digit is independent, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of choices for each position. So it's 8 * 8 * 8 * 8. Let me calculate that. 8^4.

Wait, 8 squared is 64, and 8 cubed is 512, so 8^4 is 8 * 512. Let me compute that: 512 * 8. 500*8 is 4000, and 12*8 is 96. So 4096. So the total number of combinations is 4096.

Looking at the options, option C is 2048, which is half of 4096. Option G is 4096. So the correct answer should be G: 4096.

The correct combination is a four-digit number where each digit can be one of 8 possible values (1-8). Since each digit is independent, the total number of combinations is 8^4 = 4096.

Answer: G: 4096
