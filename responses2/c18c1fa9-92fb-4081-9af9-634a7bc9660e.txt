Okay, so I've got this question about illumination from a lamp. Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking, what is the illumination 5 feet from a 75 candlepower lamp? The options are A through J, each with different foot-candle values. Hmm, I think I remember something about illumination from a point source being related to the power of the source and the distance.

Wait, the formula for illumination (I) is I = P / d², right? Where P is the power in candlepower and d is the distance in feet. So I should plug in the numbers here.

The lamp is 75 candlepower, and the distance is 5 feet. Let me calculate 75 divided by 5 squared. 5 squared is 25, so 75 divided by 25 is 3. Oh, so the illumination would be 3 foot-candles. Looking at the options, option G is 3 foot-candles. So the answer should be G.

The illumination at a point is calculated using the formula I = P / d², where P is the power and d is the distance. For a 75 candlepower lamp at 5 feet, the illumination is 75 / (5²) = 3 foot-candles. The correct answer is G: 3 foot-candles.

Answer: G
