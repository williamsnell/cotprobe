Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about Papadaki's arguments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the specific content, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Papadakis argues about sexual objectification. The options are A to D. I remember that sexual objectification refers to the idea that people are reduced to objects in their sexual relationships, like how we're reduced to biological objects. But I'm not exactly sure about the details.

Option A says sexual objectification is not always wrong. That sounds familiar. I think Papadakis might have argued that it's not inherently wrong, but maybe it's socially constructed. Like, it's a way people communicate about their sexual experiences, but they don't necessarily have to be reduced to objects. So this could be correct.

Option B claims it's the total reduction. I'm not sure about this. Reduction might mean taking away everything, but I think objectification is more about being reduced to a particular form rather than being entirely removed. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C suggests that it can't be explained in Kantian terms. Hmm, I'm not too clear on that. I remember that Kant talked about moral and ethical categories, but I'm not certain how sexual objectification fits into that. Maybe it's not something he'd argue against? Or perhaps he said it's acceptable. I'm not sure, so I'll hold that thought.

Option D says it's about denial of humanity. Well, objectification is often tied to self-perception, which affects how we see ourselves. But I think the main point is more about the social and cultural context rather than a complete denial of humanity. So D might not be the right choice.

Putting it together, I think A is the correct answer. Papadakis probably argues that sexual objectification isn't inherently wrong but is a social construct. So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. Papadakis argues that sexual objectification is not always wrong, emphasizing its social construct rather than inherent wrongfulness.
