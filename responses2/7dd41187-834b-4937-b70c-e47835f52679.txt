Okay, so I've got this question about sonar and ocean depths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The sonar device emits waves at 40,000 cycles per second. The velocities are 1100 ft/s in air and 4200 ft/s in water. The device is fixed at the ocean bottom, emits a signal, and the echo comes back after 0.8 seconds. I need to find the depth of the ocean. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that the frequency of the wave doesn't change when it goes from air to water. Sonar works based on the time it takes for the sound to go down and back. So the frequency in air and water should be the same as the emitted frequency, which is 40,000 cycles/s. Wait, but wait, the options vary, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, no. Sonar works such that the emitted frequency is the same for both media. So the frequency in air should be 40,000 cycles/s, same as in water. So options C, H, etc., with 40,000 are possible. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, A, D, E, G, F, H have 40,000 in air and water. Others have different.

So, the device emits the wave, goes down, reflects, and comes back. The time taken is the round trip time. So the total path length is twice the depth, right? Because the sound goes down to the ocean floor and back up.

Wait, the time given is 0.8 seconds. So the total distance the sound travels is speed multiplied by time. But wait, the speed of sound in air is 1100 ft/s. Wait, but wait, isn't the speed of sound in water higher? So the actual depth is based on the speed in the medium the sound travels through.

Wait, no. Let me think again: the sonar device is in the water, so the sound is traveling in water. Because the device is fixed at the ship's bottom, so the sound is going into the water, travels down, hits the ocean floor, reflects, and comes back up. So the total path is 2d, where d is the depth.

So the total distance the sound travels is 2d. The speed is the speed in the medium, which is water here, since the device is submerged. So time is 0.8 sec.

So, 2d = speed_in_water * time.

But wait, wait. Wait, the velocity given is 4200 ft/s in water. So that's correct.

So, 2d = 4200 ft/s * 0.8 s = 3360 ft.

So depth d is 3360 / 2 = 1680 ft.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one has depth 1680 ft.

Looking at the options:

A: 1650 ft

B: 1750 ft

C: 1700 ft

D: 1760 ft

E: 1600

F: 1600

G: 1680 ft

H: 1720

I: 1620

J:1700

So G's depth is 1680, which matches.

But wait, the options for G have 40000 in air and water. So that's consistent with what I thought earlier.

Wait, but let me double-check the frequency. The device emits waves at 40,000 cycles/s. So the frequency in air and water remains the same. So the correct frequency is 40,000. So any option with 40,000 in air and water is correct.

But looking at the options, G says 40,000 in both. So that's correct. Let me see what other options have same frequency.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Oh wait, no, the time is 0.8 s, which is the round trip. So the total distance is 4200 * 0.8 = 3360 ft. So d is 1680 ft. So that's correct. So the depth is 1680 ft.

But wait, look at the options:

Looking again, option G says the ocean depth is 1680 ft. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because sound in water is faster than in air, the time for the sound to go down, hit the floor, and come back is less than for a sound in air. Because in air, the same distance would take longer. So the time here is 0.8 s, which is the time for the round trip in water. So the depth is indeed 1680 ft.

So the correct answer should be G. But wait, let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option G says:

Frequency in air: 40,000 cycles/s,

Wavelength in air: 2.75 × 10^-2 ft,

Wavelength in water: 10.50 × 10^-2 ft,

Depth: 1680 ft.

Yes, that's what I thought.

Wait, but wait, let me re-verify the wavelength calculations. Because the question also asks for the wavelength in air and in water.

So, for air, the wavelength is speed divided by frequency. So in air, the speed is 1100 ft/s. Frequency is 40,000 cycles/s.

So wavelength_air = 1100 / 40000. Let's compute that.

1100 / 40,000 = 0.0275 ft. Which is 2.75 × 10^-2 ft. So that matches option G.

In water, the wavelength is 4200 / 40000. Let's compute that.

4200 / 40,000 = 0.105 ft. Which is 1.05 × 10^-1 ft, but option G says 10.50 × 10^-2 ft, which is the same as 0.105 ft. So that matches.

So the correct option is G.

The question involves determining the frequency, wavelengths, and ocean depth using sonar principles. The sonar device emits waves at a frequency of 40,000 cycles/s, and the velocities of sound in air and water are 1100 ft/s and 4200 ft/s, respectively. The device emits a signal that takes 0.8 seconds to return after reflecting off the ocean bed. The total distance traveled by the sound is twice the ocean depth.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Depth Calculation**:
   - Total distance traveled by sound: \( 2d = v_{\text{water}} \cdot t \)
   - \( d = \frac{v_{\text{water}} \cdot t}{2} = \frac{4200 \cdot 0.8}{2} = 1680 \, \text{ft} \)

2. **Frequency in Air and Water**:
   - The frequency in air and water is the same as the emitted frequency: \( 40,000 \, \text{cycles/s} \).

3. **Wavelength in Air**:
   - Wavelength in air: \( \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{v_{\text{air}}}{f} = \frac{1100}{40000} = 0.0275 \, \text{ft} = 2.75 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft} \).

4. **Wavelength in Water**:
   - Wavelength in water: \( \lambda_{\text{water}} = \frac{v_{\text{water}}}{f} = \frac{4200}{40000} = 0.105 \, \text{ft} = 1.05 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{ft} = 10.50 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft} \).

### Matching with Options:
- The correct frequency in air and water is \( 40,000 \, \text{cycles/s} \), which matches options A, D, E, G, F, H.
- The correct depth is \( 1680 \, \text{ft} \), which matches option G.
- The wavelength in air is \( 2.75 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft} \) and in water is \( 10.50 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft} \), which matches option G.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **G**, as it satisfies all the given conditions.
