Okay, so I have this question about somatosensation and I need to figure out which option isn't a basic sense. Let me start by recalling what I know about somatosensation. Somatosensation is the process of detecting and responding to stimuli related to the body's temperature, pain, and heat. The basic sensations involve things like touch, heat, pain, cold, and sometimes even taste, but wait, is taste considered a part of somatosensation?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up somatosensation and olfactory senses. Oh right, somatosensation is primarily about the body's own temperature. The basic sensations are touch, heat, pain, cold, and maybe even pain as a response to heat. But what about taste? I think taste is an olfactory sense, not somatosensation. So if the question is asking which of the options is not a basic somatosensation, then taste (F) is not part of it because it's an example of the olfactory sense. So the options given are A to G, and one of them isn't part of the basic somatosensation. 

Looking at the options: A is itch, which is a skin reaction to environmental touch. B is balance, which doesn't sound right. C is heat, which is definitely part of somatosensation. D is touch, which is a basic touch sensation. E is pain, which is a somatosensation response. F is taste, which is not part of somatosensation. G is cold, another basic touch.

Wait, but some sources might categorize touch as part of somatosensation. So the question is asking which is NOT basic. If the options include taste, then the answer would be F. So the correct answer is F, taste.

Answer: F
