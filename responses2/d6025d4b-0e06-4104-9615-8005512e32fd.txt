Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about collisions, which I remember from my mechanics class. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: A particle of mass m and velocity u1 makes a head-on collision with another particle of mass 2m that's initially at rest. The coefficient of restitution is set so that the loss of total kinetic energy is maximum. We need to find the velocities v1 and v2 after the collision.

Hmm, right. So, I think I need to use the equations for collision. Since it's a head-on collision, both velocities are along the same line, so I don't have to worry about vectors.

The coefficient of restitution, e, is given by (v2 - v1)/(u1 - u2). But wait, since the second particle is initially at rest, u2 is zero. So e = (v2 - v1)/u1.

But wait, in this case, we have to make the loss of kinetic energy maximum. Kinetic energy loss is when the collision is perfectly inelastic, possibly? Or maybe it's maximum when the relative velocity is such that the collision is maximally elastic or inelastic. Wait, no, the loss of KE is maximum when the collision is perfectly inelastic because that's when they stick together, but wait, in that case, the coefficient of restitution would be zero because they don't rebound. Oh wait, no, in perfectly inelastic collision, they are moving together, so e is zero. But here, we want maximum loss of KE, which would possibly mean maximum e, but e can't be more than 1.

Wait, but maximum loss of KE for a given collision could occur at a particular e. Let's think.

The loss of kinetic energy is (initial KE) - (final KE). So KE_initial = ½ m u1² + ½ (2m)(0)^2 = ½ m u1². KE_final = ½ m v1² + ½ (2m) v2². So loss is ½ m u1² - (½ m v1² + ½ (2m) v2²) = ½ m (u1² - v1² - 2 v2²).

We want to maximize this loss, which is equivalent to minimizing the final KE. So we need to find the condition where KE_final is as small as possible, which would happen when the particles stick together, e=0. But wait, that's a perfectly inelastic collision. So in that case, e=0, and the final velocity is (m u1 + 2m * 0)/(m + 2m) = u1/3. So v1 = u1/3, v2 = u1/3.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the coefficient of restitution is such that the loss of KE is maximum. So perhaps the maximum loss occurs when the collision is perfectly inelastic? Because that would be when the KE loss is maximum.

Alternatively, maybe it's when the collision is elastic, but that would mean maximum KE, which isn't what we want. So no, here, the maximum KE loss would occur when the collision is perfectly inelastic, leading to e=0.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Another approach: Let me think about the relation between e and the velocities.

The collision equations are:

m u1 + 2m * 0 = m v1 + 2m v2 → equation (1): u1 = v1 + 2 v2.

And the coefficient of restitution e is (v2 - v1)/(u1 - 0) → e = (v2 - v1)/u1.

In our case, since we want to maximize the loss of KE, perhaps we should maximize the e.

Wait, but if e is maximum (e=1), then that's a perfectly elastic collision. But in that case, the KE would be conserved, meaning the loss would be zero. So that can't be the case. So maybe the question isn't about maximum e but about maximizing the KE loss, which would require e as high as possible, but not 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum loss of KE occurs when the particles stick together (e=0), but that leads to no KE loss. Wait, that would result in no loss, which is not what the question is asking.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the scenario. The problem says that the coefficient of restitution is such that the loss of total kinetic energy is maximum. So perhaps the condition is such that the collision is inelastic, leading to maximum possible loss.

Wait, but let me think about the possible options. The options for v1 are given, and one of them is u1/3. Which would be the case for perfectly inelastic collision.

Wait, but what if the collision is elastic? Then the loss of KE would be zero. So maximum loss can't be achieved in an elastic collision. So, perhaps the maximum loss occurs in a perfectly inelastic collision, where e=0, leading to v1 = u1/3.

But wait, in that case, the velocity v1 is u1/3, which is option B. But wait, that's option B in the list: B is 1/3 u1.

Wait, but the problem says that the coefficient of restitution is such that the loss is maximum. So perhaps that's when e=1, but wait, if e=1, then it's a perfectly elastic collision, which would mean KE is conserved, so loss is zero, which can't be maximum.

Hmm. There's a contradiction here. Let's approach this methodically.

First, write the two equations:

Equation 1: m u1 = m v1 + 2 m v2 → simplifying, u1 = v1 + 2 v2.

Equation 2: The coefficient of restitution e is (v2 - v1)/(u1) → e = (v2 - v1)/u1.

We need to maximize the loss of KE, which is ½ m u1² - (½ m v1² + ½ (2m) v2²) = ½ m (u1² - v1² - 2 v2²).

To maximize this, we can take it as a function of v1 and v2, with the constraints.

But perhaps more directly, we can consider that when e is maximum, but in the context of maximum loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum loss occurs when the collision is perfectly inelastic (e=0), so v1 = v2 = u1/3, as earlier. So v1 would be u1/3.

Wait, but let's think: in that case, the velocity v1 is u1/3, which is option B. But wait, that's option B in the list: B is 1/3 u1.

But wait, option D is 2/5 u1, which is another possibility. Hmm.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the case when the collision is perfectly inelastic. That would be when the particles stick together. So, e is zero.

But wait, what's the loss of KE when they stick together?

As I calculated earlier, the final velocity is (u1 +0)/(1+2) = u1/3. So v1 = v2 = u1/3.

So KE before collision: ½ m u1².

KE after collision: ½ m (u1/3)^2 * 2 → because each has that velocity.

So KE after = 2 * [½ m (u1/3)^2 ] → m (u1²/9) * (2/2) → wait, 2*(½ m (u1^2/9)) = m (u1^2)/9.

So KE loss is ½ m u1² - m u1²/9 = (9/18 - 2/18) m u1² = 7/18 m u1².

But wait, is this the maximum possible loss? Or is there a case where the loss is larger?

Alternatively, perhaps when e=1, the collision is perfectly elastic, which would result in maximum KE. So the loss would be zero. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about when the collision is elastic versus inelastic.

In an elastic collision, KE is conserved. So the loss of KE is zero.

In an inelastic collision (e=0), the KE is maximum loss.

Wait, but if e=1, it's perfectly elastic, so KE is conserved, so the loss is zero.

Wait, so maximum loss of KE would occur when the collision is inelastic (e ≤1), but to get maximum KE loss, e should be as large as possible, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about maximum possible KE loss (so not e=1) but about maximum possible loss given that the coefficient of restitution is chosen to maximize it.

Wait, but how does e relate to the loss of KE. Let me think about the maximum possible loss.

The KE loss is (1/2) m u1² - (1/2 m v1² + m v2²).

We can express this as (1/2 m)(u1² - v1² - 2 v2²).

We can also express v1 and v2 in terms of e.

From equation 1: u1 = v1 + 2 v2 → v1 = u1 - 2 v2.

Substituting into the KE loss equation:

(1/2 m)(u1² - (u1 - 2 v2)^2 - 2 v2^2 )

Expanding (u1 - 2 v2)^2: u1² -4 u1 v2 +4 v2².

So:

u1^2 - (u1² -4 u1 v2 +4 v2²) - 2 v2^2 = u1^2 - u1² +4 u1 v2 -4 v2² -2 v2² → simplifies to 4 u1 v2 -6 v2^2.

So KE loss becomes (1/2 m)(4 u1 v2 -6 v2²) = m u1 v2 - 3 m v2^2.

We can factor this as m v2 (u1 - 3 v2).

But we also have the equation from e:

e = (v2 - v1)/u1.

But v1 = u1 -2 v2, so e = (v2 - (u1 -2 v2))/u1 = (v2 -u1 + 2 v2)/u1 = (3 v2 -u1)/u1 → so e = (3 v2 - u1)/ u1 → rearranged, 3 v2 = e u1 + u1 → v2 = (e +1)(u1)/3.

Wait, that's an important relation: v2 = (e +1) u1 /3.

Now, substituting v2 into the KE loss expression:

KE loss = m v2 (u1 -3 v2) → substituting v2 = (e +1) u1 /3:

→ m * [(e+1) u1/3] * [u1 -3*( (e+1) u1/3 ) ].

Simplify the second term:

u1 -3 * ( (e+1) u1/3 ) = u1 - (e+1) u1 = u1 (1 - e -1) = u1 (-e).

So KE loss becomes m * (e+1) u1/3 * (-e u1) → [ m (e+1) (-e) u1^2 ] / 3.

Which is KE loss = - m e (e +1) u1² / 3.

Wait, but KE loss should be positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations, because the substitution might have flipped signs.

Wait, wait, in the KE loss expression, we have m v2 (u1 - 3 v2). Let me recompute that.

v2 = (e +1) u1/3.

u1 -3 v2 = u1 -3 * (e+1) u1/3 = u1 - (e+1) u1 = u1 (1 - e -1 ) = -e u1.

So the product v2 (u1 -3v2 ) becomes (e+1) u1/3 * (-e u1) = - e (e +1) u1² /3.

So since KE loss is positive, it's the absolute value: m times this product. But wait, in the calculation, we have:

KE loss = 1/2 m [u1² - v1² -2v2² ] = m u1 v2 - 3 m v2^2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the KE loss in terms of e.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express KE loss as a function of e and find its maximum.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to express the KE loss in terms of e.

So, from earlier, KE loss is (1/2 m) [4 u1 v2 - 6 v2² ].

But also, from equation (from e), v2 = (e +1) u1 /3. So substituting:

4 u1 v2 = 4 u1 * (e+1) u1/3 = (4/3) u1² (e+1).

6 v2² = 6 * [ (e+1)^2 u1^2 /9 ] = (6/9) (e+1)^2 u1^2 = (2/3) (e+1)^2 u1^2.

So,

4 u1 v2 -6 v2^2 = (4/3) (e+1) u1² - (2/3)(e+1)^2 u1^2.

Factor out (2/3) u1²:

= (2/3) u1² [ 2 (e+1) - (e+1)^2 ].

So the KE loss is (1/2 m) times that:

(1/2 m) * (2/3) u1² [ 2 (e+1) - (e+1)^2 ]

Simplify (1/2 * 2/3) to 1/3:

KE loss = (1/3) m u1² [ 2 (e+1) - (e+1)^2 ].

Factor (e+1):

= (1/3) m u1² (e+1) [ 2 - (e+1) ].

So,

KE loss = (1/3) m u1² (e+1) (2 - e -1 ) → which simplifies to (1/3) m u1² (e+1)(1 - e).

So,

KE loss = (1/3) m u1² (1 - e^2 ) → because (e+1)(1 -e) = 1 -e².

Wait, that makes sense because 1 - e² is the standard form. So the KE loss is (1/3) m u1² (1 - e² ).

Wait, that's a neat result. So the loss of KE depends on e, and it's (1/3) m u1² (1 - e² ).

But wait, this can't be correct, because when e=1, the loss is zero, which matches. When e=0, loss is (1/3) m u1^2 (1 - 0) = (1/3) m u1^2.

Wait, but earlier, when e=0, which is perfectly inelastic, the loss was 7/18 m u1^2, which is about 0.388 m u1^2. But according to this formula, it should be (1/3) m u1^2, which is about 0.333 m u1².

Wait, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, let me double-check.

I had:

KE loss = (1/3) m u1² (1 - e^2 ).

But let me re-express the earlier steps.

We had:

KE loss = (1/3) m u1² [ (e+1)(1 - e) ].

Which is (e+1)(1 - e) = 1 - e^2.

So, yes, KE loss = (1/3) m u1² (1 - e² ).

But wait, earlier calculation when e=0 gave (1/3) m u1^2, but when e=0, the actual KE loss was 7/18 m u1^2, which is about 0.388 m u1², which is larger than (1/3) m u1^2. So something's wrong here.

Ah, something's wrong because when e=0, the KE loss should be maximum, but according to this formula, it's (1/3) m u1^2. But earlier calculation suggests a higher value.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the velocity v2 is (e+1) u1/3 when e=0.

Wait, let's re-examine that.

From e = (v2 - v1)/u1.

And equation 1: u1 = v1 + 2 v2.

So, solving for v1: v1 = u1 - 2 v2.

Substituting into e: e = (v2 - (u1 - 2 v2 )) / u1 → e = (v2 - u1 + 2 v2 ) / u1 → e = (3 v2 - u1 ) / u1.

So 3 v2 = e u1 + u1 → 3 v2 = (e+1) u1 → v2 = (e+1) u1 /3.

Which is correct.

So for e=0: v2 = (0+1) u1/3 = u1/3.

That's correct, as in that case, the particles stick.

But earlier, when e=0, the KE loss should be maximum. Let's compute the actual KE loss in that case.

v1 = u1 -2*(u1/3) → u1 - (2u1/3) = u1/3.

v2 = u1/3.

So KE after: ½ m (u1/3)^2 * 2 → m (u1^2/9) * 2/2 → m u1²/9.

Initial KE: ½ m u1².

So loss is ½ m u1² - m u1²/9 = (9/18 - 2/18) m u1² = 7/18 m u1² → approximately 0.388 m u1².

But according to KE loss formula (1/3) m u1² (1 - e² ), when e=0,

(1/3) * m u1² * (1 -0) = (1/3) m u1² → approximately 0.333 m u1².

Which is less than the actual loss.

So the formula I found must be wrong. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back to the KE loss expression.

We had KE loss = (1/2 m) [u1² -v1² -2 v2^2 ].

Expressed as:

(1/2 m) [u1² - (v1² + 2 v2^2) ].

But from equation 1, v1 = u1 - 2 v2.

So substituting into v1²: (u1 -2 v2 )^2 = u1^2 -4 u1 v2 +4 v2^2.

So,

v1² + 2 v2^2 = (u1^2 -4 u1 v2 +4 v2^2 ) + 2 v2^2 = u1^2 -4 u1 v2 +6 v2^2.

So,

u1^2 - (v1^2 +2 v2^2) = u1^2 - (u1^2 -4 u1 v2 +6 v2^2 ) = 4 u1 v2 -6 v2^2.

So,

KE loss = (1/2 m) (4 u1 v2 -6 v2^2 ) = 2 m u1 v2 -3 m v2^2.

But from e equation, v2 = (e +1) u1/3.

So, substitute v2 into the expression.

v2 = (e +1) u1/3.

So,

4 u1 v2 =4 u1 * (e+1) u1/3 = 4/3 (e+1) u1^2.

6 v2^2 =6 * [ (e+1)^2 u1^2 /9 ] = 6/9 (e+1)^2 u1^2 = 2/3 (e+1)^2 u1^2.

So,

4 u1 v2 -6 v2^2 = [4/3 (e+1) - 2/3 (e+1)^2 ] u1^2.

Factor out (e+1) and (1/3):

= (e+1) [4 - 2 (e+1) ] * (1/3) u1^2.

Simplify the bracket:

4 - 2(e +1) =4 -2e -2= 2-2e.

So,

= (e+1)(2-2e) * (1/3) u1^2.

Factor further:

= 2 (e+1)(1-e) * (1/3) u1^2.

Which is:

= (2/3) (e+1)(1-e) u1^2.

But this is the same as the KE loss expression I derived earlier.

So, KE loss is (2/3) (e+1)(1-e) u1^2.

Wait, but earlier, when e=0, this gives KE loss as (2/3)(1)(1) u1^2 = 2/3 u1^2, which is larger than what I found earlier (7/18 m u1² ≈ 0.388 m u1²).

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation of the actual loss.

Let me recompute the actual loss when e=0.

v1 = u1/3.

v2 = u1/3.

So, KE after: ½ m (u1/3)^2 * 2 → ½ m (u1²/9) * 2 = m u1² /9.

Initial KE: ½ m u1².

So, loss is (1/2 m u1²) - (m u1² /9) = (9/18 m u1² – 2/18 m u1²) = 7/18 m u1² ≈ 0.388 m u1².

But according to the formula, when e=0,

KE loss = (2/3)(e+1)(1-e) u1^2.

Plugging e=0: (2/3)(1)(1) → 2/3 ≈ 0.666 m u1².

So, this formula gives a KE loss of 0.666 m u1², which is larger than the actual loss of 0.388 m u1².

So this suggests that the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation of the formula.

Wait, perhaps what I should have is the KE loss expressed as (e+1)(1-e) * (1/3) m u1^2, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's re-derive the formula.

We have:

v2 = (e +1) u1 /3.

Substituting into the loss expression:

KE loss = (1/2 m) [4 u1 v2 -6 v2^2 ].

Which is:

(1/2 m) [4 u1 (e+1) u1/3 -6 (e+1)^2 u1^2 /9 ].

So:

= (1/2 m) [ (4(e+1) u1^2 ) /3 - (6 (e+1)^2 u1^2 ) /9 ].

Simplify the terms:

= (1/2 m) [ (4(e+1) u1^2 )/3 - (2 (e+1)^2 u1^2 )/3 ].

Factor out (2 (e+1) u1^2 )/3:

= (1/2 m) [ (2(e+1) u1^2 /3) (2 - (e+1) ) ) ].

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me just compute each term separately.

First term: (4 (e+1) u1^2 ) /3.

Second term: (6 (e+1)^2 u1^2 ) /9 = (2 (e+1)^2 u1^2 ) /3.

So,

KE loss = (1/2 m) [ (4(e+1) u1^2 - 2 (e+1)^2 u1^2 ) /3 ].

Factor:

= (1/2 m) [ (2 (e+1) u1^2 ) (2 - (e+1) ) /3 ].

Wait, that's getting too messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take a step back.

Wait, perhaps the KE loss formula I found earlier, which was (1/3) m u1^2 (1 - e^2 ), is incorrect. Because when e=0, that gives KE loss of (1/3) m u1^2, which is larger than the actual loss of 7/18 m u1^2.

Which suggests that perhaps the formula is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let's consider the initial and final velocities.

Let me denote v1 and v2 as the final velocities after the collision.

From the equations:

1. u1 = v1 + 2 v2.

2. e = (v2 - v1)/u1 → v2 = v1 + e u1.

Substituting into equation 1:

u1 = v1 + 2 (v1 + e u1 ) → u1 = v1 + 2v1 + 2 e u1 → u1 = 3 v1 + 2 e u1.

Rearranged:

3 v1 = u1 (1 - 2 e )

→ v1 = u1 (1 - 2 e ) /3.

Then, v2 = v1 + e u1 = u1 (1 - 2 e ) /3 + e u1.

→ v2 = [ (1 - 2 e ) + 3 e ] u1 /3.

→ v2 = (1 + e ) u1 /3.

So now, we have expressions for v1 and v2 in terms of e.

Now, the loss of kinetic energy is:

ΔKE = (1/2) m u1² - (1/2) m v1² - (1/2) m v2².

We can compute each term.

First, (1/2) m u1².

Second, (1/2) m v1² = (1/2) m [ u1² (1 - 2 e )^2 /9 ].

Third, (1/2) m v2² = (1/2) m [ u1² (1 + e )^2 /9 ].

So,

ΔKE = (1/2) m u1² - (1/2 m u1²) [ (1 - 2 e )^2 /9 + (1 + e )^2 /9 ].

Factor (1/2) m u1²:

= (1/2) m u1² [ 1 - ( (1 - 2 e )^2 + (1 + e )^2 ) /9 ].

Compute the term in the brackets:

= 1 - [ (1 - 4 e +4 e² ) + (1 + 2 e + e² ) ] /9.

Sum the numerators:

(1 -4 e +4 e² ) + (1 + 2 e + e² ) = 2 - 2 e +5 e².

So,

= 1 - (2 - 2 e +5 e² ) /9.

= 1 - [ (2 -2 e +5 e² ) /9 ].

= [9 - (2 -2 e +5 e² ) ] /9.

= [ 7 +2 e -5 e² ] /9.

So,

ΔKE = (1/2) m u1² * (7 +2 e -5 e² ) /9.

= (7 +2 e -5 e² )/(18 ) * m u1².

But wait, the problem states that the loss is maximum. So, to find the value of e that maximizes ΔKE, we can take the derivative of ΔKE with respect to e and set it to zero.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to find the maximum.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this approach is correct, because the problem states that the loss is maximum when the collision is such that the velocity after the collision has a certain value. So perhaps I need to find the values of v1 and v2 that maximize the KE loss.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to approach this problem by considering possible values of e (coefficients) and seeing which option gives maximum KE loss.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made an error in the KE loss formula.

Wait, the correct KE loss formula is:

ΔKE = (1/2) m u1² (1 - e² ), which I think is correct because when e=0, ΔKE= (1/2) m u1², and when e=1, ΔKE=0.

Wait, but earlier calculation when e=0, the actual ΔKE was 7/18 m u1², which is larger than (1/2) m u1².

Which suggests that my formula is incorrect.

Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Another approach: let's compute the KE loss for each option and see which one is maximum.

Let's consider the options given for v1 and v2.

The options given are:

A: v1 = 1/3 u1, v2 =1/3 u1.

B: v1=1/3 u1, v2=2/3 u1.

C: v1=1/3 u1, v2=0.

D: v1=1/3 u1, v2=-1/3 u1.

E: v1=1/4 u1, v2=0.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the KE loss for each option.

Let me compute the KE loss for each option.

Option A:

v1 = (1/3) u1.

v2 = (1/3) u1.

As before, KE after: ½ m (u1/3)^2 *2 = m u1²/9.

KE loss: ½ m u1² - m u1²/9 = 7/18 m u1² ≈ 0.388 m u1².

Option B:

v1 = (1/3) u1.

v2 = (2/3) u1.

So, KE after: ½ m (2/3 u1)^2 *2 = ½ m (4/9 u1²) *2 = ½ m *8/9 u1² = 4/9 m u1².

Wait, no: ½ m (2/3 u1)^2 *2 → ½ m (4/9 u1²) *2 → (1/2 m * 4/9 u1² ) *2 = (2/9 m u1² ) *2 = 4/9 m u1².

KE after: 4/9 m u1².

KE loss: ½ m u1² -4/9 m u1².

Compute ½ m u1² = 4.5/9 m u1².

So,

4.5/9 -4/9 =0.5/9 m u1² = (1/18) m u1^2 ≈0.0556 m u1².

So, option B's KE loss is 1/18 m u1², which is much less than option A's 7/18 m u1².

Option C:

v1 = (1/3) u1.

v2 =0.

So, KE after: ½ m (0)^2 =0.

KE loss: ½ m u1² -0 =1/2 m u1² = 0.5 m u1².

Which is larger than option A's 0.388 m u1².

Option D:

v1 = (1/3) u1.

v2 = -1/3 u1.

So, KE after: ½ m (- (1/3) u1 )^2 *2 → ½ m (1/9 u1² ) *2 → ½ * 1/9 *2 m u1² → (1/9) m u1^2.

KE loss: ½ m u1^2 - (1/9) m u1^2 → (9/18 - 2/18) m u1² → 7/18 m u1^2 ≈0.388 m u1^2.

So, option D's KE loss is 7/18 m u1², same as option A.

Option E:

v1 = (1/4) u1.

v2 =0.

So, KE after: ½ m (0)^2 =0.

KE loss: ½ m u1^2.

Which is larger than option A's 7/18 m u1^2.

So, which option gives the maximum KE loss?

Option A and E both have KE loss of 7/18 m u1².

Option C and D have lower KE losses.

So, the maximum KE loss is 7/18 m u1², which occurs when either e=0 and v2=(1/3) u1 or e=1 and v2=(1/3) u1.

Wait, but when e=1, v2 = (1+1) u1/3 =2 u1/3. Which is option B's case.

Wait, no, when e=1, v2 = (1+1) u1/3 =2 u1/3, which is option B.

But in option A, v2 is (1/3) u1, and e=0.

So, which options give the same KE loss of 7/18 m u1^2.

So, option A and option B both have KE loss of 7/18 m u1^2.

Wait, no, option A's KE loss is 7/18, option B's is 1/18.

So, option A and E have max KE loss.

But maybe I made a mistake in option B's KE calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate option B.

Option B: v1 = (1/3) u1.

v2 = (2/3) u1.

So, KE after: ½ m ( (2/3 u1) )^2 * 2 → ½ m (4/9 u1² ) *2 → ½ m *8/9 u1² → 4/9 m u1².

KE after is 4/9 m u1².

KE loss is ½ m u1² (1) -4/9 m u1² → (9/18 - 8/18) m u1² → 1/18 m u1².

So, option B's KE loss is 1/18 m u1².

Which is much smaller than options A and E.

So, maximum KE loss is 7/18 m u1², achieved in options A and E.

So, the answer should be either option A or E.

But the options are:

A: v1=1/3 u1, v2=1/3 u1.

E: v1=1/4 u1, v2=0.

So, which one gives maximum KE loss.

Wait, option A: v2=1/3 u1.

Option E: v2=0.

But when e=0, v2=(1+0) u1/3 =1/3 u1.

Which is option A.

So, the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but wait, when e=0, v2=1/3 u1.

When e=1, v2=2/3 u1.

So, option A is when e=0, which gives v2=1/3 u1, and option E is when e=1, which gives v2=2/3 u1.

Wait, but the question says: which velocities are there?

The question is: which velocities are there that result in maximum KE loss?

The options are given as possible combinations.

So, the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but in option A, v1=1/3 u1, v2=1/3 u1.

Which would imply e=0, since v2=(1+0) u1/3 =1/3 u1.

So, yes, option A is when e=0.

Option E is when e=1, v2=2/3 u1.

So, both A and E give max KE loss of 7/18 m u1².

But the options are separate. So, the correct answer must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps the question is which velocities are the correct ones for maximum KE loss.

So, the correct answer is either A or E.

But looking back, the options are given as A, B, C, D, E.

So, the correct answer is either A or E.

But let me re-examine the energy loss for both options.

Option A:

v1 = (1/3) u1.

v2 = (1/3) u1.

KE after: ½ m (1/3 u1)^2 *2 = ½ m (1/9 u1²) *2 → (1/9) m u1².

KE loss: ½ m u1² -1/9 m u1^2 → (9/18 - 2/18) m u1² → 7/18 m u1^2.

Option E:

v1 = (1/4) u1.

v2=0.

KE after: 0.

KE loss: ½ m u1².

Which is more than 7/18 m u1^2.

So, option E's KE loss is larger.

So, the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option D and B have lower losses.

Yes, so the maximum KE loss is achieved in option E.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when e=0, the KE loss is 7/18, and when e=1, it's 0.

So, the maximum KE loss is 7/18.

So, the correct answer is option E.

But wait, looking back, the problem is in the velocities, and the options are what the velocities would be for maximum KE loss.

So, the correct answer is option E.

Thus, the answer is option E.
</think>

The correct answer is **E**. This is because when \( v_1 = \frac{1}{4} u_1 \) and \( v_2 = 0 \), the kinetic energy loss is maximized at \( \frac{7}{18} m u_1^2 \). This occurs when the collision coefficient \( e = 0 \), as \( v_2 = \frac{1}{3} u_1 \) in this case.
