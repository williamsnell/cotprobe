Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says that we have 3.00 moles of perfect gas atoms. The molar heat capacity at constant pressure, Cp,m, is given as (5/2) R. We're changing the state from 25°C and 1.00 atm to 125°C and 5.00 atm. The question is about calculating the entropy change (ΔS) for the system and then determining the sign of ΔS.

Hmm, I remember that entropy change can be calculated using the formula ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1), where T is temperature in Kelvin and P is pressure. Wait, or was it the other way around? I think the formula depends on whether the process is at constant pressure (so using Cp) or volume (using Cv). Since in this problem, Cp is given, I think we should use the Cp formula.

Wait, but wait: for entropy change, when the process is at constant pressure, ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Wait, no, I think that's not right. Because when a process occurs at constant pressure, the heat transfer is q = n Cp,m ΔT, and the entropy change is q_rev / T. So the entropy change for the system when pressure is constant would be ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Or maybe I'm mixing up the signs. Alternatively, another approach is to think about the integral of dQ_rev / T. 

Wait, I think the correct formula is ΔS = n Cp,m ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Because when pressure is constant, the system absorbs heat, and the entropy increases. Let me double-check the formula.

Alternatively, another approach: when the process occurs at constant pressure, the change in entropy is ΔS = n Cp,m ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Because at constant pressure, the heat is q_p = n Cp,m ΔT. And the entropy change is q_rev / T = (n Cp,m ΔT)/T. But we also know that for ideal gases, ΔS can be expressed as S = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1), but that's when volume is changing. Alternatively, when pressure is changing, perhaps the formula becomes using Cp.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The entropy change for any process is given by the integral of (dQ_rev)/T. For an ideal gas, the heat at constant pressure is dQ = n Cp dT, so the entropy change is ∫ (n Cp dT)/T from T1 to T2. That would be n Cp ln(T2/T1). But wait, that's only at constant pressure. But when pressure changes, like in this problem, the process is not at constant pressure. So that formula would not apply directly.

Wait no, perhaps I'm confusing the case when the process is only at constant pressure versus when it's at constant volume. Because in problems where the process is at constant pressure, you use the formula with Cp, but in those where it's at constant volume, you use Cv.

Wait, maybe the correct general formula for entropy change is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1) or something like that. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for entropy change when the gas expands or contracts, considering pressure and temperature.

Wait, another approach: When a gas undergoes a process from initial state (T1, P1) to final state (T2, P2), the entropy change can be calculated using ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). But since for ideal gases, V is proportional to T and P, perhaps we can write V2/V1 = (P1 T2)/(P2 T1). Let me see.

Alternatively, using the formula for entropy change when pressure and temperature change:

ΔS = n Cp,m ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Wait, I think that's the formula. Because when P changes, you have to account for that in the entropy. Let me see. Let me recall that for entropy, the formula when pressure changes is ΔS = n Cv,m ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). But since V = nRT/P, perhaps we can relate V2/V1 to T and P.

Hmm, perhaps an alternative way is to use the formula that for any process, ΔS = n Cp,m ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Let's think about the units to make sure. Cp has units of J/(mol·K), R is J/(mol·K). So when you multiply by ln(T2/T1), you get a dimensionless term, and the other term is ln(P2/P1), which is dimensionless as well. So the units work out.

So the formula would be ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Because when P increases, the pressure term would be negative, which would affect the entropy.

So in this problem, let me plug in the numbers.

Given:
n = 3.00 mol
Cp,m = (5/2) R
T1 = 25°C = 298.15 K (since 25 + 273.15)
T2 = 125°C = 125 + 273.15 = 398.15 K
P1 = 1.00 atm
P2 = 5.00 atm

Wait, but the problem says "state of 3.00 mol perfect gas atoms", but the molar heat capacity is given as (5/2) R. So that's okay, no problem.

So now, compute ΔS as:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Plugging in the numbers:

n = 3.00
Cp = (5/2) R
R is 8.314 J/(mol·K)
T2/T1 = 398.15 / 298.15 ≈ 1.3366 (approx 1.337)
P2/P1 =5.00 / 1.00 =5.00

So:

ΔS = 3 * (5/2 * R) * ln(1.337) - 3 * R * ln(5.00)

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: 3 * (5/2 R) * ln(1.337)
= (15/2 R) * ln(1.337)

Compute ln(1.337): let's approximate. I know ln(1.333) is about 0.2877, because e^0.2877 ≈1.333. Hmm, let me check: 0.2877 * 1.333 = approximately 0.385. Not quite 1.337, but close. So perhaps ln(1.337) is about 0.291.

Wait, another approach: Using a calculator, ln(1.337) is approximately 0.291.

So first term: (15/2) * R * 0.291

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), so 15/2 is 7.5.

7.5 * 8.314 = let's compute that. 8 *7.5 is 60, 0.314 *7.5 is 2.355. So 60 + 2.355=62.355.

Multiply by 0.291: 62.355 * 0.291 ≈ Let's compute 62 *0.291 = 17.922, and 0.355*0.291≈0.103. So total ≈17.922+0.103=18.025 J/K.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 7.5 *8.314 = 7.5 *8=60, 7.5*0.314=2.355 → total 62.355 J/(mol·K) * (1/2) is 31.1775 J/(mol·K) × ln(1.337).

Wait, no, no, sorry, the first term is (15/2) R ln(1.337) = (7.5 R) * ln(1.337). So 7.5 * 8.314 = 62.355 (R value). Multiply by ln(1.337) ≈ 0.291 → 62.355 * 0.291 ≈ 18.094 J/(mol·K) * ln term → Wait, units? Because R is in J/(mol·K), so 7.5 R is 7.5 *8.314 J/(mol·K) = approx 62.355 J/(mol·K). Multiply by ln term (unitless) → 62.355 J/(mol·K) * 0.291 → J/(mol) → because 62.355 J/(mol·K) * K = J/mol.

So 62.355 *0.291 = let's compute:

62 * 0.291 = let's compute 60*0.291=17.46, 2*0.291=0.582 → total 18.042.

0.355 *0.291: 0.3 *0.291=0.0873, 0.05*0.291=0.01455, 0.005*0.291=0.001455 → sum 0.0873+0.01455=0.10185 +0.001455=0.1033. So total is 18.042 +0.1033=18.145 J/(mol).

So the first term is 18.145 J/(mol).

Second term: 3 * R * ln(5)

ln(5) is about 1.609.

So 3 *8.314 *1.609 → let's compute:

8.314 *3 =24.942.

24.942 *1.609 ≈ Let's compute 24 *1.609 =38.616. 0.942 *1.609 → approx 1.517. So total approx 38.616 +1.517=40.133 J/(mol).

So now, the second term is -40.133 J/(mol).

So ΔS = 18.145 J/(mol) -40.133 J/(mol) = -21.988 J/(mol).

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Because the problem says 3.00 mol of gas atoms. Oh, wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, the gas is diatomic or monoatomic? Wait, no, the question says "perfect gas atoms", which implies monoatomic. But for a monoatomic gas, Cp,m is (5/2) R, which is correct. So our initial approach is correct.

Wait, so according to this calculation, ΔS is approximately -22 J/(mol). So the total entropy change is negative, which would imply a decrease in entropy.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Because the entropy change formula for a process where both pressure and temperature change is given by ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1).

Wait, but wait, another thing: when a gas expands, its volume increases, which increases entropy. But if the pressure increases, which means the gas is compressed, that could also affect entropy. So the formula should account for both.

Hmm, another approach: entropy change when the system undergoes a process from state 1 to state 2.

But perhaps when the process is at constant pressure, the formula is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). Let me make sure.

Wait, using the formula for entropy change when pressure changes, but considering the system's process.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ideal gas equation. Let's think about the process: 25°C and 1.00 atm to 125°C and 5.00 atm.

Wait, the process isn't necessarily at constant pressure, so that formula might not apply. Wait, but wait—the formula I used earlier is for a process where both T and P change. So perhaps the formula is correct.

Wait, but in the example I did earlier, the first term was 18.145 J/(mol) and the second term was -40.133 J/(mol), so the total ΔS is about -22 J/(mol). So that's negative, indicating a decrease in entropy.

Wait, but why is the entropy change negative? Because when the pressure increases and the temperature increases, but the amount of substance is the same, the system's entropy is decreasing. Which makes sense because the gas is being compressed more than the temperature increase compensates for it.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about a simpler case: if you go from a low pressure to a high pressure and temperature, what happens to the entropy?

Suppose you have N moles of an ideal gas. At higher pressure and higher temperature, the volume is lower (since PV = NRT → V = NRT/P). So the volume is lower. Because entropy depends on the volume, lower volume would lower entropy. But in this case, the amount of gas is the same. So the system's entropy change should be negative, which matches our calculation.

So, the ΔS is negative, which implies that the system's entropy decreases when going from lower pressure (1 atm) to higher pressure (5 atm), and higher temperature (125°C) to 25°C. So the system's entropy decreases.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are A to J. The options are all positive or negative.

So, our calculation gave about -22 J/(mol·K). So which option is that? Let's look.

The options are:

A: 25.7 J K⁻¹

B:15.3 J K⁻¹

C:10.5 J K⁻¹

D:33.4 J K⁻¹

E: -30.7 J K⁻¹

F:-45 J K⁻¹

G:-60 J K⁻¹

H:-22.1 J K⁻¹

I:5.8 J K⁻¹

J: -17.9 J K⁻¹

So option H is -22.1, which is very close to our calculation of about -22.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any miscalculations in the math?

Let me recompute the terms more accurately.

First term: 3 * (5/2 R) * ln(1.337)

3 * (5/2 R) = (15/2) R = 7.5 R.

7.5 R =7.5 *8.314 = let's calculate:

7 *8.314 =58.198, 0.5 *8.314=4.157 → sum is 62.355 J/(mol·K).

Multiply by ln(1.337) = approx 0.2909.

So 62.355 * 0.2909.

Let me compute 62 * 0.2909: 62 * 0.29 = 17.98, 62 *0.0009=0.0558 → sum is 18.0358.

Now 0.355 *0.2909:

0.3 *0.2909=0.08727

0.05 *0.2909=0.014545

0.005 *0.2909=0.0014545

Summing: 0.08727 +0.014545=0.101815 + 0.0014545=0.10327.

So total 18.0358 +0.10327=18.139 J/(mol).

Second term: 3 * R * ln(5) → 3*8.314 *1.609.

Compute 3 *8.314: 24.942.

Multiply by 1.609: Let's compute 24.942 *1.609.

24 *1.609 =38.616.

0.942 *1.609: Let's compute 0.9 *1.609=1.4481; 0.04 *1.609=0.06436; 0.002 *1.609=0.003218.

Sum all: 1.4481 +0.06436=1.51246 +0.003218=1.515678.

So 24.942 *1.609=38.616 +1.515678=40.131678 J/(mol).

So the second term is -40.131678 J/(mol).

Therefore, ΔS =18.139 -40.131678 = -22.0 J/mol.

So the correct answer is option H: -22.1 J K⁻¹.

Wait, but let me think again about the formula used. Because the way the question is framed, maybe the process is at constant pressure, but no, the problem says it's a change from 1 atm to 5 atm. So it's a process where both pressure and temperature change. So the formula I used should be correct.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should consider the number of moles. Oh wait, no, the problem states 3.00 mol. So the formula is correct.

So the answer is option H: -22.1 J K⁻¹.

But wait, I just thought of a possible mistake: when using the formula for entropy change when both pressure and temperature change, perhaps the formula should be ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1). So that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: the change in entropy can be calculated using the equation ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Since V = nRT/P, V2/V1 = (P1 T2)/(P2 T1). So substituting:

ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln( (P1 T2)/(P2 T1) ) 

Which can be written as:

ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R [ ln(P1) + ln(T2) - ln(P2) - ln(T1) ) ]

Which is:

ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R [ ln(P1) - ln(P2) + ln(T2) - ln(T1) ) ]

But since Cv is (5/2) R, but wait, no. Wait, Cv is specific to the gas. But for a monatomic gas, Cv,m = (3/2) R.

Wait, but in this problem, the Cp is (5/2) R. So for a monatomic gas, Cp = Cv + R → which would make Cv = (3/2) R, and indeed (5/2 R) = (3/2 R) + R → yes, correct.

So for a monatomic gas, Cv = (3/2) R. So perhaps I can substitute Cv into the formula.

So substituting Cv = (3/2) R, into the equation:

ΔS = n (3/2 R) ln(T2/T1) + n R [ ln(P2) - ln(P1) + ln(T2) - ln(T1) ) ]

Wait, because the V2/V1 is (P1 T2)/(P2 T1), so ln(V2/V1) = ln(P1) + ln(T2) - ln(P2) - ln(T1).

So then, the equation becomes:

ΔS = n (3/2 R) ln(T2/T1) + n R [ ln(P1) + ln(T2) - ln(P2) - ln(T1) ].

Let me compute each term.

n = 3.00
R =8.314
T2=398.15 K, T1=298.15 K
P2=5.00 atm, P1=1.00 atm.

Compute each term:

First term: n (3/2 R) ln(T2/T1) =3*(3/2 R)*ln(1.337) = (9/2 R) *0.291.

Wait, but earlier calculation was 3*(5/2 R) ln(T2/T1) → because we used 5/2 R. Hmm, but in this approach, the Cv is 3/2 R, so the first term would be 3*(3/2 R) ln(T2/T1) = (9/2 R) ln(T2/T1).

Wait, so let me redo the calculation with this approach.

First term:

3 * (3/2 R) * ln(1.337) → 3 * (1.5 R) * 0.291 → 3 * 1.5 =4.5 → 4.5 R *0.291 → 4.5 *4.5 is 20.25? No, wait, R is 8.314. So 4.5 *8.314 = let me compute:

4 *8.314 =33.256 → 0.5 *8.314=4.157 → sum 33.256+4.157=37.413.

Multiply by 0.291: 37.413 *0.291.

Let me compute 37 *0.291 → 37*0.2=7.4, 37*0.09=3.33, 37*0.001=0.037 → sum 7.4+3.33=10.73 +0.037=10.767.

Then 0.413 *0.291: 0.4 *0.291=0.1164, 0.013 *0.291=0.003783 → sum 0.1164+0.003783=0.120183.

So 37.413 *0.291 =10.767 +0.120183=10.887183 J/(mol).

Second term:

3 * R * ln(5) → 3 *8.314 *1.609 → let's compute:

3 *8.314 =24.942 → 24.942 *1.609 → let's compute 24 *1.609=38.616, 0.942*1.609=1.515678 → sum 38.616 +1.515678=40.131678 J/(mol).

So the first term is 10.887183 J/(mol), the second term is -40.131678 J/(mol).

So ΔS =10.887183 -40.131678 = -29.2445 J/(mol).

Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. Hmm.

This suggests that perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I used the wrong Cp.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔS = n Cp (ln T) - n R (ln P). Because in this approach, the Cp is (5/2 R) and the ln P term is negative.

Wait, let me think again. The correct formula when both T and P change is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1).

Wait, but when I use the formula for a process where both T and P change, I should use this formula. So in the first approach, I used the formula correctly. But in the second approach, perhaps I used the wrong formula, leading to a different result.

Wait, but if I stick to the correct formula, then let's recalculate.

n =3.00

Cp = (5/2) R = (5/2)*8.314=20.785 J/(mol·K).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because Cp,m is (5/2) R for a monatomic gas. So for one mole, Cp is (5/2) R.

So the first term: 3 * (5/2 R) * ln(T2/T1) → 3 * (5/2 *8.314) *0.291.

Wait, let me compute 5/2 *8.314 → 2.5 *8.314=20.785.

Multiply by 3: 20.785 *3 =62.355 J/(mol·K).

Multiply by ln(1.337) =0.291 → 62.355 *0.291 = let me compute: 62 *0.291=18.042, 0.355 *0.291=0.1033 → total 18.145 J/(mol).

Second term: 3 * R * ln(5) → 3*8.314 *1.609.

3 *8.314=24.942.

24.942 *1.609 = let's compute:

24 *1.609=38.616.

0.942 *1.609= 1.516.

So 38.616 +1.516=40.132 J/(mol).

So ΔS =18.145 -40.132= -21.987 J/(mol) → approximately -22 J/(mol).

So the correct answer is about -22 J/(mol), which matches option H: -22.1 J/K.

Wait, but let me check the formula again. Another approach: the entropy change when the system goes from state 1 to state 2 can be given by ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1).

Yes, that's correct. So in this case, our calculation is correct, and the answer is option H.
</think>

To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the process, we use the formula for entropy change when both temperature and pressure change:

\[
\Delta S = n C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - n R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- \( n = 3.00 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( C_p = \frac{5}{2} R \) (specific heat at constant pressure for a monatomic gas)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)
- \( T_1 = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 125^\circ \text{C} = 398.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_1 = 1.00 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_2 = 5.00 \, \text{atm} \)

### Step 2: Compute the temperature term
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{398.15}{298.15} \approx 1.337
\]
\[
\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = \ln(1.337) \approx 0.291
\]

### Step 3: Compute the pressure term
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{5.00}{1.00} = 5.00
\]
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \ln(5.00) \approx 1.609
\]

### Step 4: Compute the entropy change
\[
\Delta S = n C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - n R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

#### Step 4.1: Temperature contribution
\[
n C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = 3.00 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{2} \cdot 8.314\right) \cdot 0.291
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2} \cdot 8.314 = 20.785 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]
\[
3.00 \cdot 20.785 = 62.355 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]
\[
62.355 \cdot 0.291 \approx 18.145 \, \text{J/(mol)}
\]

#### Step 4.2: Pressure contribution
\[
n R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = 3.00 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 1.609
\]
\[
3.00 \cdot 8.314 = 24.942 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]
\[
24.942 \cdot 1.609 \approx 40.132 \, \text{J/(mol)}
\]

#### Step 4.3: Net entropy change
\[
\Delta S = 18.145 - 40.132 \approx -21.987 \, \text{J/(mol)}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest value to \(-21.987 \, \text{J/(mol)}\) is \(-22.1 \, \text{J/K}\), which corresponds to **Option H**.

ANSWER: H
