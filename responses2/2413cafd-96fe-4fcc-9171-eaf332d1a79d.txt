Alright, so I've got this question about philosophical arguments, specifically focusing on property rights and the theories involved. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about what Wellman argues when he says that insisting on unlimited property rights commits one to a certain value. The options are various theories, and I need to pick the correct one. 

First, I should recall what each of these theories generally entails. Wellman is a philosopher I'm familiar with, maybe from the Free Market Theorem of Value or something like that. But I don't remember exactly. Let me think.

The options are A through J. The key ones here are about property rights, so I'm thinking about theories that deal with rights and their implications.

Option A: Anarchy. Hmm, anarchy is a state of maximum disorder. I'm not sure how property rights relate to that. Maybe if everyone has equal rights, but I don't think unlimited property rights necessarily lead to anarchy. Anarchy might involve more free market principles, not necessarily rights.

Option B: Deontological theory. That's about moral laws based on duties and ethical obligations, rather than consequences. Wellman's argument might be more about rights and rights versus obligations, so maybe this isn't it.

Option C: Libertarianism. Libertarianism is the belief that individuals have the power to decide their own rights. So, if property rights are unlimited, that could imply that individuals can freely decide what they want to own. That sounds possible, as it's a foundational belief in libertarianism.

Option D: Communitarianism. This is about collective rights and duties, where society as a whole has certain responsibilities. Unlimited property rights might not fit here because it's more about the individual's rights rather than collective responsibilities.

Option E: Socialism. Socialism is a broader theory where state power is redistributed among the classes. I'm not sure how that ties into unlimited property rights. Maybe if property rights are unlimited, it limits the state's power, but I'm not certain if that's what Wellman argues.

Option F: Egalitarianism. That's about equality among the rich. If property rights are unlimited, perhaps it leads to more inequality, but I don't know if that's what Wellman's argument is about.

Option G: Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness. unlimited property rights could lead to a more equitable society, but I'm not sure if that's the focus of Wellman's argument.

Option H: Consequentialism. This is about the outcomes of actions. But again, I'm not certain how that would tie into property rights.

Option I: Capitalism. Wellman is an advocate for free markets, so maybe he's against capitalism, but I don't know if that's directly about property rights.

Option J: Authoritarianism. That's a form of government where power is concentrated in a single individual or group, often at the expense of others. Unlimited property rights might lead to authoritarianism, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

So, putting it together. Wellman's argument is probably about the implications of unlimited property rights. libertarianism suggests that individuals have free choice over their rights, which aligns with unlimited property rights. I think he might argue that unlimited rights commit to certain values, perhaps a form of individual freedom where everyone can own what they want, which is the basis of libertarianism.

Wait, but another thought: Wellman might be talking about the ethical implications. Unlimited property rights could lead to a society where everyone is free to own what they want, which is a libertarian approach. If that's the case, then option C (libertarianism) would be the answer.

The correct answer is C: libertarianism. Wellman's argument likely stems from the idea that unlimited property rights imply individual freedom to own what they want, aligning with the foundational principles of libertarianism. libertarianism posits that individuals have the power to decide their rights, which is consistent with unlimited property rights.

Answer: C
