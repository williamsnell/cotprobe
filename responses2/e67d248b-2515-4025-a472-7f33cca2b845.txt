Question:

A ball of mass is attached to a string connected to the ceiling, forming a pendulum. When the string is raised to an angle of 50 degrees below the horizontal (the ceiling) and released, the ball swings back and forth with a period of 0.4 s. Which of the following changes to the pendulum would decrease the period of the pendulum?

Options:

A: Releasing the string from a higher point
B: Increasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released
C: Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released
D: Decreasing the mass of the ball
E: Increasing the length of the string
F: Releasing the ball from a lower point
G: Decreasing the length of the string
H: Increasing the mass of the ball
I: Decreasing the gravity acting on the ball

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a pendulum. Hmm, I remember that pendulums have something to do with periods and stuff. Let me think. The question is about changing certain aspects of a pendulum and seeing which change would decrease its period. 

The problem says that a ball is attached to a string and swings as a pendulum. The period given is 0.4 seconds. The options are various changes to the setup, and I need to pick which one would make the period smaller. 

Wait, the period of a pendulum formula I remember is T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Oh right, so the period depends on the square root of the length divided by gravity. So any change that reduces the length or increases gravity would decrease the period, I think. That makes sense because if you make the pendulum shorter, it swings faster, so the period goes down. Or if gravity is stronger, like on the moon, the pendulum would swing faster too, so the period is shorter.

Now, let's look at the options. The options are A to I, each describing a change.

Option A: Releasing the string from a higher point. Wait, no, when you release a pendulum, the initial angle doesn't affect the period. The period depends on the length and gravity. So the starting point (like higher point) doesn't change the period. So A wouldn't decrease the period.

Option B: Increasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released. Oh, wait, the angle affects the amplitude. But the period formula I used doesn't depend on the angle, right? Because the formula assumes small angles, where the pendulum motion is approximately simple harmonic. If the angle is larger, the period actually increases a bit, but I think the main formula is based on small angles. So this change would probably not decrease the period because the period doesn't depend on the angle beyond the small-angle approximation. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C: Decreasing the angle of the string. Similar to B, but this time the angle is smaller. Again, for small angles, the period doesn't depend on angle, but for larger angles, the period is a bit longer. But the main point is that the period isn't affected by the angle. So decreasing the angle wouldn't decrease the period. So C probably isn't the answer.

Option D: Decreasing the mass of the ball. Wait, the formula I used doesn't involve mass. So mass doesn't affect the period. So D would not change the period. So D is not the right choice.

Option E: Increasing the length of the string. Oh, since T is proportional to the square root of L, if L increases, T increases. So increasing L would make the period longer, so this wouldn't help; E isn't correct.

Option F: Releasing the ball from a lower point. Wait, no, the initial release point (angle) doesn't affect the period. So F would not decrease the period. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Decreasing the length of the string. That would make T smaller because T is proportional to the square root of L. So G would decrease the period. So G is a candidate.

Option H: Increasing the mass of the ball. As I thought before, mass doesn't affect the period. So H would remain the same. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: Decreasing the gravity acting on the ball. Wait, if gravity is lower, the period would increase because the pendulum is affected by g. So if g decreases (like on the moon where g is smaller), the ball takes more time to swing back and forth, so I think the period would increase. So I wouldn't decrease the period, but make it longer. So I's not the right answer.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer would be G: Decreasing the length of the string. Because reducing L would make the period smaller. Wait, wait, the initial period is 0.4 s. If we decrease L, the period would get even smaller. So yes, G would help decrease the period.

The period of a pendulum is given by the formula \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \), where \( L \) is the length of the string and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. The period does not depend on the mass of the ball or the amplitude of the swing (as long as the amplitude is small). 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Releasing the string from a higher point does not affect the period, as it depends only on \( L \) and \( g \).  
- **B**: Increasing the angle from the horizontal does not change the period, as the formula assumes small angles.  
- **C**: Decreasing the angle from the horizontal similarly does not affect the period.  
- **D**: Decreasing the mass of the ball does not impact the period, as it is independent of mass.  
- **E**: Increasing the length of the string increases the period, so this does not decrease it.  
- **F**: Releasing the ball from a lower point does not change the period.  
- **G**: Decreasing the length of the string reduces the period, as the period is proportional to \( \sqrt{L} \).  
- **H**: Increasing the mass of the ball does not affect the period.  
- **I**: Decreasing the gravity acting on the ball increases the period, so this does not decrease it.  

The correct answer is **G: Decreasing the length of the string**, as it directly reduces the period.
