B: (num MOD 3) = 1
C: (num DIV 2) = 1
D: (num MOD 1) = 0
E: (num MOD 2) = 1
F: (num MOD 2 ) = 0
G: (num DIV 2) = 0
H: (num MOD 0) = 1

Okay, so I have this programming question in front of me. Let's read it carefully. The problem is about a code fragment that's supposed to display "odd" if the positive number num is odd. The code currently has a comment saying "IF (MISSING CONDITION) DISPLAY 'odd'". My task is to figure out which option replaces that condition so that the code works correctly.

The options given are A through H. I need to figure out which condition correctly checks if num is odd and displays "odd". Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall the properties of odd and even numbers. An odd number is any integer that isn't divisible by 2. So, if num is odd, then when you divide it by 2, the remainder should be 1. In programming terms, this is often checked using the modulus operator. The modulus operator gives the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, num % 2 should be 1 for odd numbers.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: (num MOD 1) = 1. Hmm, any number MOD 1 is 0 because 1 divides into any integer exactly. So this condition will always be false, regardless of the value of num. So this doesn't make sense. It won't check if num is odd.

Option B: (num MOD 3) = 1. That's checking if num leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. But that's only true for numbers like 1,4,7, etc. It doesn't determine if the number is odd. For example, 2 is even and (2 mod 3) is 2, not 1. So this isn't correct.

Option C: (num DIV 2) = 1. Dividing by 2 gives 1 when num is 2. But this would also be true for 4,6, etc., which are even. Wait, no, when num is 2, num DIV 2 is 1. But for 3, it's 1 as well because 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, so integer division would be 1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When num is 3, num DIV 2 is 1 because 3//2 is 1. For num=4, 4//2 is 2. Wait, no, wait! 4 divided by 2 is 2, integer division. So, num DIV 2 equals 1 would only be true for numbers between 2 (inclusive) and 3 (exclusive). So if num is 2, it's true; if it's 3, it's false. So this condition only works for num=2, not for all odd numbers. So this is not the correct condition.

Option D: (num MOD 1) = 0. Wait, similar to option A. Any number mod 1 is 0. So this condition will always be false. So this can't be correct.

Option E: (num MOD 2) = 1. This is exactly what I thought earlier. It checks if the remainder is 1 when divided by 2, which happens precisely when num is odd. So this seems correct.

Option F: (num MOD 2) = 0. That's the opposite. It checks if the remainder is 0, which is true for even numbers. So this condition will display "odd" only for even numbers, which is the opposite of what we want.

Option G: (num DIV 2) = 0. This is checking if the integer division by 2 is 0, which would imply that num is less than 2. So for num=0 and 1, this is true. But for numbers like 2,3,4, this is false. So this condition doesn't detect odd numbers correctly.

Option H: (num MOD 0) = 1. Wait, division by zero is undefined, so MOD 0 is not a valid operation. So this condition is invalid and will cause an error. So this can't be used.

So, the only correct condition is option E: (num MOD 2) = 1. This will display "odd" when num is odd and "even" when it's even. So in the code, when the condition is met, it will display "odd".

The correct condition to check if a number is odd is `num MOD 2 == 1`. This evaluates to `true` for odd numbers and `false` for even numbers, which is exactly what is needed.
