Okay, so I've got this question about gas behavior and molar volume. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that a gas is at 250 K and 15 atm, and its molar volume is 12% smaller than what's calculated from the perfect gas law. I need to find the molar volume from that.

Wait, I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So the molar volume would be V = RT/P. The ideal molar volume would be RT/P, but this gas's V is 12% smaller. Oh right, percentage change in volume means the actual volume is less than the ideal case.

Let me think about how to calculate the actual molar volume. If the calculated (ideal) molar volume is V_ideal, and the real volume is 12% smaller, then V_real = V_ideal × (1 - 0.12) which is 0.88 * V_ideal.

Wait, no. Wait, 12% smaller than the ideal would mean 88% of the ideal. So V_real = 0.88 * V_ideal.

But wait, no. Wait. No, wait, that’s not right. Because if the ideal molar volume is V_ideal, and the real volume is 12% smaller, then V_real = V_ideal × (1 - 0.12) = 0.88 V_ideal.

But wait, that would make the real V smaller. Let me make sure.

Yes, correct. So, the real molar volume is 88% of the ideal. So if I calculate V_ideal as RT/P, then the real V is 0.88 * (RT/P).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Oh no, wait. No, no. Oh, wait a second. The question says the real molar volume is 12% smaller than the calculated (ideal) molar volume. So the ideal molar volume is taken as the base. So V_real = V_ideal * (1 - 0.12) = 0.88 V_ideal.

So if I calculate V_ideal as (RT)/P, then V_real is 0.88 * (RT/P).

Wait, but the question is asking for the molar volume, which is the real V. So the molar volume is 0.88 * (RT/P). But wait, the question says the given data is a molar volume that's 12% smaller. So the real molar volume is lower.

Wait, but the question is asking for the molar volume of the gas. So I need to compute V_real, which is 12% smaller than V_ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as V_real = V_ideal * (1 - 0.12) = 0.88 V_ideal.

So to find V_real, I need to compute 0.88 * (RT/P).

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the units. The problem gives P as 15 atm, T as 250 K. Let me calculate V_ideal first.

Wait, RT is in what units? Because R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), so R*T would be in L·atm/(mol).

So V_ideal would be (RT)/P.

So R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). T is 250 K.

So RT = 0.0821 * 250 = 20.525 L·atm/mol.

Divide that by P, which is 15 atm.

So V_ideal = 20.525 / 15 = approximately 1.3683 L/mol.

But wait, the question says the real molar volume is 12% smaller. So 12% of 1.3683 is 0.130. So 1.3683 - 0.130 = 1.2383 L/mol. Or wait, no. Wait, 12% smaller would be 88% of the ideal. So 0.88 * 1.3683.

Let me compute that: 1.3683 * 0.88.

Calculating:

1.3683 * 0.8 = 1.09464

1.3683 * 0.08 = 0.109464

Adding: 1.09464 + 0.109464 = 1.204104 L/mol.

Wait, but wait, the question gives the options in dm³ (dm³ is liters, since 1 m³ is 1000 L, but wait, no, 1000 cm³ is 1 L, so 1 dm³ is 1 liter. So dm³ is liters. So the options are in dm³/mol.

So the real molar volume is approximately 1.2041 L/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.2 dm³/mol, which is 1.2 L/mol. That's close to 1.204, but let me see the exact calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the V_ideal.

Wait, RT is 0.0821 * 250 = 20.525 L·atm/mol.

V_ideal = 20.525 / 15 = 1.368333... L/mol.

12% of that is 0.13683333... So 12% of 1.3683 is 0.164199999, wait no, 0.12 * 1.3683.

Wait, no, wait. 12% of 1.3683 is (0.12) * 1.3683.

0.12 * 1.3683 = 0.164196. So the 12% reduction is 0.164196 L/mol.

So the real molar volume is 1.3683 - 0.164196 = 1.204104 L/mol.

So about 1.204 L/mol.

Looking at the options, which one is 1.2 (option A). But wait, the options given are A: 1.2, B:1.35, C:2, D:0.8, etc.

Wait, but the options are in dm³/mol, which is same as liters. So the correct value is approximately 1.204, so the closest option is A:1.2 dm³/mol.

But wait, the problem says the molar volume is 12% smaller than the calculated (ideal) molar volume. So that would be 0.88 * V_ideal.

Ah, but wait wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. If the real value is 12% smaller than the ideal, then V_real = V_ideal * (1 - 0.12) = 0.88 * V_ideal.

So 0.88 * 1.368333 = ?

Let me compute that precisely.

1.368333 * 0.88:

1.368333 * 0.8 = 1.0946664

1.368333 * 0.08 = 0.10946664

Adding: 1.0946664 + 0.10946664 = 1.20413304 L/mol.

So approximately 1.2041 L/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:1.2.

So the answer should be A.

But wait, the options include F:1.0, which is even smaller, and G:0.6, which is even smaller. So why isn't F the answer?

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of V_ideal.

Wait, let me double-check the ideal molar volume.

V_ideal = RT/P.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T is 250 K.

So RT = 0.0821 * 250 = 20.525 L·atm/mol.

P =15 atm.

So V_ideal = 20.525 / 15 = 1.368333... L/mol.

Yes, that's correct.

So 12% smaller is 1.204..., which is closest to 1.2. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but the options are presented as A:1.2, B:1.35, etc. So the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the molar volume of the gas using the ideal gas law: 

\[
V_{\text{ideal}} = \frac{RT}{P}
\]

Given:
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)
- \( T = 250 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P = 15 \, \text{atm} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
V_{\text{ideal}} = \frac{0.0821 \times 250}{15} = \frac{20.525}{15} = 1.3683 \, \text{L/mol}
\]

The problem states that the molar volume of the gas is 12% smaller than the calculated (ideal) molar volume. To find the real molar volume, we calculate 88% of the ideal molar volume:

\[
V_{\text{real}} = V_{\text{ideal}} \times (1 - 0.12) = 1.3683 \times 0.88
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
1.3683 \times 0.88 = 1.2041 \, \text{L/mol}
\]

The closest value to \( 1.2041 \, \text{L/mol} \) among the given options is \( 1.2 \, \text{dm}^3/\text{mol} \) (option A).

Thus, the correct answer is:
