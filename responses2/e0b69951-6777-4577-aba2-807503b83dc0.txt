Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of water. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says: How many calories of heat must be added to 3.0 liters of water to raise the temperature from 20°C to 80°C? The options are A to J, with varying numbers.

Hmm, I remember that calculating heat involves the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the heat energy, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. 

Wait, but the mass here is given in liters. Oh right, since water is about 1 kg per liter, 3 liters would be 3 kg. That seems straightforward.

The specific heat capacity of water... I think it's around 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. But wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because 1 calorie is the amount needed to raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius. But wait, sometimes I get confused with kilocalories. Oh wait, yes, 1 kilocalorie (kcal) is 1000 calories. So, for water, it's about 1 calorie per gram per degree, but sometimes people say 1 cal/g°C.

So, m is 3 kg, which is 3000 grams. The change in temperature ΔT is 80°C minus 20°C, which is 60°C.

Putting it into the formula: Q = 3000 g * 1 cal/(g·°C) * 60 °C. Let me compute that. 3000 *60 is 180,000. So Q is 180,000 calories. But wait, the options are in Kcal. Oh right, because 1 Kcal is 1000 calories. So 180,000 calories is 180 Kcal. Looking at the options, D is 180 Kcal.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because sometimes specific heat capacities can be a bit different. Let me think. Oh, wait, I think I got the formula right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because the specific heat capacity of water is about 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. So for 3 kg, which is 3000 grams, yes, 3000 * 60 = 180,000 calories, which is 180 Kcal.

But wait, another thing comes to mind. Oh wait, sometimes heat calculations are done in kilojoules, but here the question is using calories, so we don't need to convert units. So 180,000 calories is 180 Kcal, which is option D.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the numbers. Mass is 3 liters. Since 1 liter of water is about 1 kg (or 1000 grams), 3 liters is 3000 grams. ΔT is 60 degrees. So 3000 * 60 = 180,000 calories. 180,000 divided by 1000 is 180 Kcal. So D is the correct option.

To determine how many calories of heat must be added to raise the temperature of 3.0 liters of water from 20°C to 80°C, we use the formula for heat energy:

\[
Q = mc\Delta T
\]

Where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the water in grams.
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of water, approximately \( 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \).
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature, \( 80°C - 20°C = 60°C \).

Since 1 liter of water is approximately 1 kg (or 1000 grams), 3.0 liters of water corresponds to 3000 grams. Substituting the values:

\[
Q = 3000 \, \text{g} \times 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \times 60 \, \text{°C} = 180,000 \, \text{calories}
\]

Since 1 kilocalorie (kcal) equals 1000 calories, the heat energy is:

\[
Q = 180,000 \, \text{calories} = 180 \, \text{kcal}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 180 Kcal**
