The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
You are the United States,
you are the future invader
of the native America that has Indian blood,
that still prays to Jesus Christ and still speaks Spanish.
. . .
you are Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar.
You think that life is fire,
that progress is eruption,
that wherever you shoot
you hit the future.
No.
. . .
But our America, that has had poets
since the ancient times of Netzahualcoyotl,
. . .
that consulted the stars, that knew Atlantis
whose resounding name comes to us from Plato,
that since the remote times of its life
has lived on light, on fire, on perfume, on love,
America of the great Montezuma, of the Inca,
the fragrant America of Christopher Columbus,
Catholic America, Spanish America,
the America in which noble Cuauhtémoc said:
"I'm not in a bed of roses", that America
that trembles in hurricanes and lives on love,
it lives, you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul.
And it dreams. And it loves, and it vibrates, and it is the daughter of the sun.
Be careful. Viva Spanish America!
There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion.
Roosevelt, one would have to be, through God himself,
the-fearful rifleman and strong hunter,
to manage to grab us in your iron claws.
And, although you count on everything, you lack one thing: God!
—Adapted from "To Roosevelt" by Ruben Dario, 1904

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what event might have prompted the poet Ruben Dario to write this piece about Spanish America. I remember that Ruben Dario was an American poet and his work is known for its strong, patriotic tone. The passage he wrote talks about the future of his country, emphasizing fire as a symbol of life and progress, and mentioning various regions that contribute to the country's heritage.

Looking at the options provided, each relates to different U.S. events. Let me go through each one and see which ones align with the themes in his poem.

Option A: U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution. I know that the Haitian Revolution was a pivotal event in U.S. history, leading to the U.S. taking control of the country. However, the poem talks about Spanish America and its future, which is more about the broader U.S. influence in Latin America, not specifically the Haitian Revolution.

Option B: U.S. involvement in Panama’s independence. Panama was an independent country, but U.S. involvement in its independence would be part of U.S. foreign policy, which is a different area. The poem's focus is on the future of Spanish America, so this might not directly tie in.

Option C: The U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution. The Mexican Revolution was a key moment in U.S. history, leading to the US obtaining much of Central America. The poem discusses Spanish America's future, which could include the impact of the Mexican Revolution, especially since the US might have been involved in its aftermath.

Option D: The embargo of Cuba after Castro’s revolution. Cuba's embargo was part of the Cold War, affecting U.S. relations with Cuba. However, the poem mentions the "annexation of Texas by the U.S." So this might not be the direct cause of the poem's themes, which are more about the broader U.S. influence in Latin America.

Option E: The annexation of Texas by the U.S. This was a direct U.S. event. annexing Texas would have had a significant impact on the US's westward expansion, which includes areas like the South and the Caribbean. This could have contributed to the national pride and the sense of expansion that Ruben Dario's poem reflects.

Option F: The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram. That was a significant U.S.-Soviet conversation about the Cold War, which had implications for the US's strategic interests. However, it's more about international relations and Cold War politics, which might not directly lead to the themes in the poem.

Option G: The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram. As I thought, this is more about WWII and Cold War relations. It's a U.S. event, but not directly related to the themes of the poem.

Option H: The Louisiana Purchase. This was a major U.S. event in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, involving the purchase of Louisiana from France. The Louisiana Purchase was significant for the U.S. in expanding its westward boundaries and gaining access to new territories, including the Caribbean, which would have contributed to the country's pride and the sense of expansion that Ruben Dario's poem mentions.

Now, looking back at the poem, it mentions the "great Montezuma" and "Inca," which are regions that were part of Spanish colonial history. The poem talks about the country's heritage and its evolution, which could be influenced by the U.S.'s influence in Latin America, both through direct involvement in revolutions and through the acquisition of new territories.

So, considering all options, the most likely events that influenced the themes in Ruben Dario's poem are either U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution (C) or the annexation of Texas by the U.S. (E), or the Louisiana Purchase (H).

Wait, the Louisiana Purchase was part of U.S. history and was significant in expanding the nation's westward expansion. The poem mentions "the America in which noble Cuauhtémoc said: 'I'm not in a bed of roses'." Cuauhtémoc is a historical figure associated with the Aztec civilization, a civilization that was prominent in the Americas. If the U.S. annexed Texas, it might have contributed to a sense of national pride and expansion, which aligns with the themes in the poem.

Alternatively, the Mexican Revolution and the U.S. involvement in its aftermath (option C) could have influenced the country's identity and the sense of heritage that Ruben Dario's poem describes.

But the Louisiana Purchase is a direct U.S. policy decision, not a political event per se, but more about the economic and geopolitical impact of the purchase. The poem might be influenced by the U.S. expansion beyond the immediate Spanish influence, which could include the Louisiana Purchase.

However, the question is about what event could have "prompted" the poet to write. The poem is about the future of Spanish America, which is a region that was traditionally part of Spanish colonies. The U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution might have led to the country's growing awareness of its historical roots, which could have influenced the themes.

Alternatively, the U.S. annexation of Texas (option E) was a direct U.S. event that combined with the country's expansion, which would have contributed to the sense of national identity and pride, which the poem reflects.

Wait, but the Louisiana Purchase is part of U.S. history and is a significant event, but the poem mentions the "annexation of Texas" as a prompt. So, perhaps the event that directly prompted the poet is the annexation of Texas by the U.S. (option E), as the poem refers to the country's future being influenced by the U.S. in its regions.

Alternatively, the Mexican Revolution (option C) and the U.S. involvement in its aftermath (option D) might have led to the country's recognition of its history and the importance of its regions, which would have influenced the themes in the poem.

But the poem's focus is on the "great Montezuma" and the "Inca," which are parts of Spanish colonial history. So, the U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution could have led to the country's expansion and the sense of pride that Ruben Dario's poem conveys.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The poem talks about the future of Spanish America and its heritage. The U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution would lead to the U.S. gaining control of Central America, which would have contributed to the country's influence and the sense of pride. The poet's piece might have been influenced by the U.S. expansion and its impact on regional history.

So, the options that align with the themes in the poem are likely the events that contributed to the nation's expansion and regional identity. Among the options, the U.S. annexation of Texas (E) and the U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution (C) are both U.S. events that could have influenced the nation's history and thus its themes.

But looking back, the question is asking which event "prompted" the composition. The prompt would be the event that was directly causing the country to be influenced by its history. The "annexation of Texas" is a direct U.S. event that would have influenced the nation's expansion and thus its national identity, which the poem describes.

Alternatively, the Mexican Revolution and U.S. involvement in it (C and D) might have led to the country's recognition of its history and the importance of its regions, which the poem reflects.

Wait, but the options given are A to H, and the correct answer is likely to be either E or H.

Wait, reviewing the options, the correct answer is E: The annexation of Texas by the U.S. Because the poem mentions the "great Montezuma" and "Inca," which are parts of the colonial history. However, the most direct event that influenced the themes in the poem is the annexation of Texas. The annexation would have contributed to the country's expansion and thus the sense of national pride, which the poem reflects through mentioning the "future of Spanish America."

Alternatively, the U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution (C) led to the country's expansion beyond its original colonies, which would have influenced the country's identity and the sense of history it carries. 

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the poem's structure. The poem talks about the "great" Montezuma, which is a term from the Aztec civilization, and mentions love and the future, which are themes linked to the country's heritage and expansion. The U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution (C) and the U.S. annexation of Texas (E) both relate to the U.S. influence in the region, which would have contributed to the country's pride and the recognition of its historical roots.

In the context of the poem, the events that would have prompted the poet to write about the future of Spanish America would be those that influenced the nation's sense of history and expansion. The U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution and the U.S. annexation of Texas are both significant events that would have led to the country's growth and the sense of pride it carries.

But looking up Ruben Dario's poem, it's known for its strong, patriotic tone, focusing on the future. The poem's themes align with the U.S. involvement in the expansion of its regions, both through direct involvement (e.g., the Mexican Revolution) and through the annexation of territories. The key event that would have directly caused the country to be seen as a region of history and influence is the U.S. annexation of Texas (E), as it's a direct and significant U.S. event that contributed to the nation's development and identity.

Alternatively, the U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution (C) and the subsequent expansion through the acquisition of land (like the Louisiana Purchase) would have influenced the country's sense of pride and regional history. However, the Louisiana Purchase is more of a geopolitical event that's part of U.S. history, whereas the Mexican Revolution's immediate impact on the U.S. and its expansion beyond its original colonies would have been more direct.

Wait, but the question is about what event "prompted" the composition. The prompt would be the event that caused the country to be influenced by its history. So, the most direct event that led to the country's growth and the recognition of its regional history would be the U.S. annexation of Texas (E), as it marked a significant U.S. expansion and contributed to the country's national pride and the sense of history it carries.

Alternatively, the U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution (C) and the U.S. expansion through the acquisition of land (option H) would have also influenced the country's identity. But the options given don't include all that. So, from the given options, the most likely answer is E: The annexation of Texas by the U.S. (E).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the poem again. The poem says, "the future of Spanish America," which is a region that has been influenced by U.S. involvement. The U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution (option C) and the subsequent expansion through the U.S. acquiring land (option H) would have led to the country's national identity and pride.

But the options don't include all of these. So, looking back, the options are:

A: Haitian Revolution

B: Panama's independence

C: U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution

D: Cuban embargo

E: U.S. annexation of Texas

F: Zimmerman Telegram

G: discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram

H: Louisiana Purchase

So, the correct answer is likely either E or H, depending on which U.S. event influenced the themes the most.

The U.S. annexation of Texas (E) is a direct U.S. event that would have led to the country's expansion, thus contributing to its national pride and the sense of history it carries. The Louisiana Purchase (H) is a U.S. economic event that is part of its history, but it's not a political event.

The "annexation of Texas" (E) is a key U.S. event that would have influenced the country's identity and the sense of pride, which the poem describes. Therefore, E is likely the correct answer.

The question asks which event might have prompted the poet Ruben Dario to compose his piece about the future of Spanish America. The poem reflects on the future and the country's heritage, emphasizing the importance of historical and regional influence. Among the given options, the U.S. annexation of Texas (E) stands out as a direct U.S. event that would have contributed to the country's national pride and the sense of history it carries. This event would have influenced the nation's identity, aligning with the themes of the poem.
