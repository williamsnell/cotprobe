Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about equivalent expressions. I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which pair of expressions are equivalent. There are seven options, A through G. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Let me start by recalling what equivalent expressions mean. They are expressions that have the same value regardless of the variable's value. So, for example, if two expressions simplify to the same thing, they're equivalent.

Looking at option A: 2x + 2x and 2x². Hmm, 2x + 2x is 4x, right? Because you're adding two terms with the same variable. But 2x² is a squared term. Unless x is 1 or 0, these two won't be equal. For example, if x is 2, 2x + 2x is 8, and 2x² is 8, but wait, x is 2. Wait, 2*(2)^2 is 2*4=8. Oh, so for x=2, both are 8. What about x=1? 2(1) + 2(1) = 4, and 2(1)^2=2. So 4 vs 2. Not equal. So A isn't always equal. Therefore, A is not an equivalent pair.

Option B: x + x + x + x and x⁴. The left side is 4x. The right side is x raised to the 4th power. For x=2, 4x is 8, and x⁴ is 16, which are not equal. So B can't be equivalent.

Option C: 3x + 5x and 15x. Let's compute 3x +5x. That's 8x. Wait, but option C says it's 15x. That can't be right. So C is incorrect.

Option D: 4(2x —6) and 8x —24. Let's expand the left side. 4 times (2x) is 8x, 4 times (-6) is -24. So it becomes 8x -24, which matches the right side. So D is equivalent. Wait, is that correct? Let's double-check. 4*(2x-6)=4*2x +4*(-6)=8x-24. Yes, that's correct. So D is equivalent.

Option E: 3x +3x +3x and 3x³. Let's compute the left side: 3x+3x=6x, plus 3x is 9x. The right side is 3x cubed, which is 3x*x*x=3x²x=3x²? Wait, no. x³ is x multiplied by itself three times. So 3x³ is 3 times x cubed, which is 3x^3. So 9x vs 3x^3. Are they the same? Only if x is 0 or 3, but in general, they're not. For example, x=1. 9*1=9, 3*(1)^3=3. Not equal. So E isn't equivalent.

Option F:7(2x) and 9x. Let's compute the left side: 7 times 2x is 14x. The right side is 9x. For these to be equal, 14x must equal 9x. Which is only true if x=0. So they are only equal when x is zero, which is a specific case. So generally, they aren't the same, so F isn't equivalent.

Option G: x +x +x +x +x and x^5. Let's compute the left side: 5x. The right side is x to the fifth power. For x=1, both are 1. For x=2, 5x=10, x^5=32. So they are not equal in general. So G isn't equivalent.

Wait, but let me review each step. Option D: 4*(2x-6) expanding to 8x-24 is correct. So D is an equivalent pair. Oh, but wait, the options are A to G, so the correct answer is D. But looking back, I'm seeing that option D is option D? Let me check the options again.

The options are A to G. So D is the fourth option. So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Option A:** 2x + 2x = 4x, while 2x² is a squared term. These are not equivalent since they yield different values for most x.
  
- **Option B:** x + x + x + x = 4x; x⁴ is a fourth power. These are not equivalent as they don't yield the same value for most x.

- **Option C:** 3x + 5x = 8x, but the option states 15x. This is incorrect.

- **Option D:** Expanding 4(2x – 6) gives 8x – 24, which matches the second expression. Thus, they are equivalent.

- **Option E:** 3x + 3x + 3x = 9x; 3x³ is a cubic term. These are not equivalent as they yield different values for most x.

- **Option F:** 7(2x) = 14x; 9x are not equivalent since they only match at x=0.

- **Option G:** x + x + x + x + x = 5x; x⁵ is a fifth power. These are not equivalent as they differ for most x.

**Answer:** D
