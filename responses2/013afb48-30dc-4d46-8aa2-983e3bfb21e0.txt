Okay, so I've got this question about taxes and how a poll tax is regressive. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see, the poll tax is $2 per head. The question is asking how this is a regressive tax, and there are five options to choose from.

First, I need to remember what a regressive tax is. I think a regressive tax is one where the tax rate increases as the income increases. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh right, a regressive tax is when the burden falls on the lower-income individuals more than the higher-income ones. So, the tax rate is higher on the lower bracket and lower on the higher bracket. 

So, if the tax is $2 per head, how does that fit into this? Let me think about each option.

Option A: Everyone pays the same amount, regardless of income. That can't be right because if the tax is per person, higher income people would pay more. So this would make it progressive, not regressive.

Option B: $2 is a lower percentage of a poor man's income than a rich man's. Wait, so the tax rate is lower for the poor. That would mean that the rich are paying a higher percentage, which fits the definition of a regressive tax. So B seems correct.

Option C: The tax increases as the income decreases. Wait, higher income would mean more tax. But if the tax is fixed per person, like $2, then higher income doesn't directly cause the tax to increase. For example, a rich person's income is higher, but they pay the same $2 as a poor person. So this option is incorrect.

Option D: The tax is progressive. Well, that's the opposite of what we want. A progressive tax increases the tax rate as income increases. So if the tax is fixed per person, it's not progressive, so D is wrong.

Option E: The tax is proportional. Proportional taxes are based on a percentage of income, like 10% on all income. So this would be a regressive tax only if the percentage is higher for lower incomes. But here, the tax is fixed, so it's more like a flat tax. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Rich people are exempt from the tax. No, that's the opposite. The question says it's a poll tax of $2 per head. If it's a fixed tax regardless of income, then rich people would still pay $2, regardless of their income. So F is incorrect.

Option G: $2 would be a higher percentage of a poor man's income than a rich man's. Wait, that's the opposite of what B says. So if the tax is $2 per person, a poor person pays 2/(poor's income) and a rich person pays 2/(rich's income). Since a poor person's income is lower, 2 divided by a smaller number is a higher percentage. So B says $2 is lower than the rich's, which would be true. G seems correct, but I thought B was correct.

Wait, but the question is which option explains that it's regressive. So B says that $2 is a lower percentage for the poor. That's correct. So B and G are both correct on different points. But wait, the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine the options.

Option B: The tax is a lower percentage of a poor man's income than a rich man's. That's correct, because the same $2 is a bigger percentage for the poor.

Option G: $2 would be a higher percentage of a poor man's income than a rich man's. That's also correct. Wait, no, that can't happen because as the income goes up, the percentage goes down. So for a rich person, their income is higher, so 2 divided by a larger number is a smaller percentage. So G is the opposite of B. So if someone's income is higher, their percentage is lower.

Wait, let me take some numbers. Suppose a poor person's income is $100, a rich person's is $10,000.

Poor person's tax rate: 2/100 = 2%.
Rich person: 2/10,000 = 0.2%.
So yes, the poor pay a higher percentage. Which matches option B and G.

Wait, but the question is which is the correct answer as per the question. The question is, the poll tax is $2 per head, and how it's regressive.

So the correct reasoning is that the tax rate is lower for the poor, making it regressive. So option B is correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, option B says "$2 is a lower percentage of a poor man's income than a rich man's." That's correct. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but the options are A to E, with F and others. Let me make sure I'm not confusing any options.

Wait, the question is which option explains that it's a regressive tax. So the correct answer is B.

The poll tax of $2 per head is a regressive tax because it results in a lower percentage of income being taxed for the poor compared to the rich. This means the tax burden falls disproportionately on those with lower incomes. 

To determine the correct answer, we evaluate each option:

- **Option A:** Incorrect. A regressive tax would not require everyone to pay the same amount; instead, the tax rate increases with income.
- **Option B:** Correct. The tax rate ($2) is lower for the poor, as their income is smaller, making their percentage taxed higher.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. A fixed tax of $2 does not increase with lower incomes; it remains the same regardless of income.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. A progressive tax increases the tax rate as income rises, which is not the case here.
- **Option E:** Incorrect. A proportional tax is based on a percentage of income, not a fixed amount.
- **Option F:** Incorrect. Exemption is the opposite of the scenario described.
- **Option G:** Incorrect. The opposite of B is true; the tax rate is lower for the rich.
- **Option H:** Incorrect. A fixed tax is not a proportional rate.
- **Option I:** Incorrect. It's not mentioned in the options.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as it accurately describes the regressive nature of the poll tax.
