Okay, so I've got this percentage question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The question is asking, "What percent of .65% is .42%?" Hmm, I need to find out what percentage .42% is of .65%. 

Wait, percentages can sometimes be tricky. I remember that to find what percentage one number is of another, you divide the two and then multiply by 100. So, the formula should be (part / whole) * 100. 

In this case, the part is .42% and the whole is .65%. So, substituting into the formula, it would be (.42% / .65%) * 100. Let me compute that step by step.

First, let's handle the division: .42 divided by .65. Hmm, 0.42 divided by 0.65. Let me do that division. 0.42 ÷ 0.65. Well, 0.65 goes into 0.42 how many times? Let's think. 0.65 times 0.66 would be 0.429, which is a bit more than 0.42. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. 

Alternatively, I can convert these percentages into decimals. So, 0.42% is 0.0042 and 0.65% is 0.0065. So the division becomes 0.0042 / 0.0065. Let me compute that. 

Wait, perhaps a better way is to multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals. So, (42 / 65) * 100. Oh wait, that's the same as 42 divided by 65, then multiplied by 100. 

Let me compute 42 ÷ 65. Let's see, 65 goes into 42 zero times. So, 0. Then 65 into 420 (adding a decimal and two zeros). 65*6=390, which is less than 420. 65*6.4=416 (since 65*0.4=26, 65*6=390; 690+26=716? Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. 

Wait, 65 times 6 is 390. 420 minus 390 is 30. Bring down a zero: 300. 65 goes into 300 four times (65*4=260). 300-260=40. Bring down another zero: 400. 65 goes into 400 six times (65*6=390). 400-390=10. Bring down another zero: 100. 65 goes into 100 once (65*1=65), remainder 35. Bring down another zero: 350. 65*5=325. 350-325=25. Bring down another zero: 250. 65*3=195. 250-195=55. Bring down another zero: 550. 65*8=520. 550-520=30. Now, we see a remainder of 30, which we've seen before, so the pattern will repeat.

So, putting it all together: 42 ÷ 65 = 0.64615384615... and so on. So, about 0.64615384615. 

Now, multiply that by 100 to get the percentage: 0.64615384615 * 100 = 64.615384615... percent, which is approximately 64.615%. 

Looking at the options, I see option I is 64.6%. So the answer should be I. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 

Alternatively, maybe another approach. Let's think in terms of fractions. 0.42 / 0.65 is the same as 42/65, because both numerator and denominator are multiplied by 100. So, 42 divided by 65. Hmm, I think that's correct. 

Wait, maybe cross-multiplying to check. If 0.42 is x% of 0.65, then:

x% = (0.42 / 0.65) * 100 = (42/65)*100. Which, as before, is approximately 64.6%. So that's correct. 

So the answer is I: 64.6%.

The question asks what percent of 0.65% is 0.42%. Using the formula (part / whole) * 100, we calculate (0.42 / 0.65) * 100 ≈ 64.6%. 

Answer: I
