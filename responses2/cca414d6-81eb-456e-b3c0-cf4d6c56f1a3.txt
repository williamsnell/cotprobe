The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers."
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
Which of the following explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must "avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity"?

Options:

A: Disunity might lead to the failure of political unions within the African continent.
B: African nations will not achieve independence without unity.
C: Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.
D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.
E: The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about why Kwame Nkrumah felt that Africa must avoid dangers due to disunity. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question gives some information. It talks about an idea that Africa should form a political union to avoid the dangers of disunity. The idea is that unity would project more effectively and be seen as an example to the world, which probably means bigger nations wouldn't react negatively. 

The options are:

A: Disunity might lead to the failure of political unions within Africa.
B: African nations won't achieve independence without unity.
C: Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.
D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.
E: The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.

Let me break down each option. 

Starting with option A: If disunity leads to the failure of political unions, then this might explain why the union is important. So, failing unions could cause the country to fail, so union is a way to ensure they stay together. That makes sense.

Option B: Without unity, they wouldn't be independent. That's about the necessity of unity. So, this aligns with the idea that unity is necessary for independence.

Option C: Disunity led to disarray. Hmm, the question says the union stands as an example to a divided world. If disarray comes from disunity, maybe that's a reason, but the question is why they must avoid dangers. So perhaps option C isn't the main reason.

Option D: The world sees power through size and influence. That could be a factor, but the question is about the necessity of avoiding dangers, not necessarily the cause of unity. Plus, the question is more about what Nkrumah feels as a reason, not the explanation.

Option E: They've had civil wars before. Not necessarily why they must form a union. It's possible, but the question is about why disunity is a problem, not about past events.

The main point from the text is that creating a political union would project African personality and be seen as an example, making the world respect it. So the necessity to unite is about avoiding the negative aspects of disunity, like regional conflicts and issues that could lead to tension.

Looking back at the question, it's about why Nkrumah feels that avoiding dangers requires unity. So the options that relate to disunity or necessity of unity are candidates.

Option A says disunity fails unions, which would cause Africa to fail. Option B says without unity, independence is impossible. Both A and B seem relevant.

Wait, the question is about why Nkrumah feels that avoiding dangers is a callous disregard towards independence. So he likely feels that the world is more concerned about size and influence than about the unity needed to avoid tensions and maintain stability.

So, what does each option mean:

Option B: Without unity, African nations can't be independent. So unity is necessary for their independence.

Option A: If they don't unify, unions fail, leading to failure.

But the question is about the necessity of avoid dangers. So perhaps the key is that without unity, they face internal conflicts, leading to dangers. So the problem with disunity is that it leads to internal tensions. Hence, the necessity to unite is to avoid such dangers.

Wait, the question is phrased as "why must Africa avoid dangers due to disunity." So the feeling is that unity is needed to prevent these dangers. So, perhaps the correct answer is B or A.

But looking at the options, the question is about why Nkrumah feels this necessity arises.

The text says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh, wait, the question is phrased as a question, and the options are about why the union is necessary, so the question is pointing towards the idea that unity is necessary to avoid the dangers inherent in disunity.

So the correct reasoning is that without unity, they'll face internal conflicts and dangers. Hence, they must unite.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: Without unity, they can't achieve independence. So unity is necessary.

Option A: If disunity leads to failure of unions, which is a danger. So union is necessary to prevent failure.

Wait, both A and B seem plausible. The question is about why Nkrumah feels that they must avoid dangers due to disunity, which suggests that the necessity is about preventing internal conflicts.

So, the answer would be B: African nations won't achieve independence without unity.

Alternatively, if it's about the dangers of disunity leading to internal conflicts, then A would be the reason.

Wait, the question is, why must they avoid dangers. So the main point is the necessity of unity to prevent internal issues, which are dangers.

So, the correct answer would be B. Because without unity, they can't achieve independence, thus facing internal division and dangers.

Alternatively, disarray comes from disunity (C), but the question is about why Nkrumah feels that they must avoid dangers due to disunity. So the answer is to avoid the dangers of disunity, which may come from internal conflicts.

So I think the correct answer is B: African nations won't achieve independence without unity.

The question asks why Kwame Nkrumah feels that disunity is a problem for Africa, necessitating a political union. The analysis of the options reveals the following:

- **Option A** suggests that disunity leads to the failure of political unions, which would cause Africa to fail. This ties into the necessity of unity to prevent such failures.
- **Option B** highlights that without unity, African nations cannot achieve independence, emphasizing the importance of unity to avoid internal tensions and dangers.
- **Option C** claims disarray results from disunity, but the question focuses on the necessity of unity, not the origin of disarray.
- **Option D** refers to the world's view of power as size and influence, which is less directly relevant to the question.
- **Option E** mentions past civil wars, which are not the primary reason for disunity.

The text emphasizes the necessity of unity to avoid internal conflicts and dangers, making **Option B** the most suitable answer.
