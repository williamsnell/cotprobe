Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it. It says that x and y are inversely proportional. Hmm, inversely proportional. I remember that means when one goes up, the other goes down in such a way that their product is a constant. So, mathematically, that would be x * y = k, where k is some constant. Yeah, that sounds right.

The problem also states that when the sum of x and y is 42, x is twice y. Oh, okay, so x + y = 42, and x = 2y. I need to find the value of y when x is -8. Right.

Let me break this down step by step. First, since x and y are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. So, x * y = k. I can find k using the given condition when x + y = 42 and x = 2y.

So, substituting x = 2y into x + y = 42. That gives 2y + y = 3y = 42. So, y = 14. Then x is twice that, so x = 28. So, when x is 28 and y is 14, their product is 28*14 = 392. So, k is 392.

Now, the question asks for y when x is -8. Using the same inverse proportionality, x * y = 392. So, substituting x = -8, we have (-8) * y = 392. To find y, I can divide both sides by -8. So, y = 392 / (-8). Let me calculate that: 392 divided by 8 is 49, so 49 times -1 is -49. So, y is -49 when x is -8.

Wait, let me double-check. So, x = -8, y = -49. Sum is -8 + (-49) = -57. Wait, but the problem states that when x + y is 42, x is twice y. Did I make a mistake there?

Wait no, because I used the condition when x + y is 42 and x = 2y to find k. So, that's correct. So, the constant k is 392. Then, when x is -8, y is 392 / (-8) = -49. That seems right.

Looking at the options, option F is -49. So, the answer should be F.

The numbers x and y are inversely proportional, meaning their product is a constant \( k \). Given \( x + y = 42 \) and \( x = 2y \), substituting \( x = 2y \) into \( x + y = 42 \) gives \( 3y = 42 \), so \( y = 14 \) and \( x = 28 \). Thus, \( k = x \times y = 28 \times 14 = 392 \). When \( x = -8 \), \( y = \frac{392}{-8} = -49 \).

Answer: F: -49
