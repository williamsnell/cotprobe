Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Poynting vector and energy density. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned in class. The Poynting vector, S, is the average power per unit area, right? And for a plane wave in free space, I think the Poynting vector is related to the electric and magnetic fields. Oh wait, but the question gives me the value of S directly as 5 watts/m². So I don't have to calculate that, I just take it.

Now, the question asks for the average energy density. I remember that energy density, which I think is called the Poynting vector in some contexts, but maybe it's different. Wait, no, the Poynting vector is specifically about the power per area. So the energy density would be a different measure. Oh wait, right! The energy density u is the energy stored per unit volume. And for electromagnetic waves, the energy density is related to the Poynting vector.

Wait, wait, the Poynting vector has units of power per area, which is energy per volume. So the energy density u is the same as the Poynting vector S. Or is it? No, wait, it's the same as S in terms of units, but I think actually, for a plane wave, the energy density is equal to (S)/c, where c is the speed of light. Because energy depends on the fields and their speed. Or maybe it's another relation. Let me think.

I think the energy density u is given by (S^2)/(c ε₀) or something like that, but wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I recall that for an electromagnetic wave, the energy density is u = (E²)/(2ε₀) or u = (B²)/(2μ₀), but another formula I've come across is u = (S)/(c). Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, another approach. The Poynting vector S is equal to the dot product of E and H. And the energy density is u = (1/2)ε₀ E². But I also know that H = (1/ε₀) E (since in a vacuum, the wave's fields are related by E = c H). So substituting H into S: S = E · H = E · (1/ε₀ E) = E²/(ε₀). Oh wait, but that would make S equal to E squared over epsilon zero. Then, the energy density u is (1/2) ε₀ E². So if S is E²/(ε₀), then E²= S ε₀, so u = (1/2) ε₀ (S ε₀) ) = (S²)/(2ε₀). Hmm, but that's not matching the earlier thought. 

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again. For a plane wave in vacuum, the intensity (which is the Poynting vector) is given by S = (1/2) ε₀ E² = (1/2) c B². Also, the energy density u is (1/2) ε₀ E² = (1/2) c B². So wait, then they're equal. So u = S²/(2ε₀) would not make sense because S is E²/(ε₀). So, if u = (S²)/(2ε₀), that would imply u = ( (E²/ε₀)^2 )/(2 ε₀ ) ) = E^4/( 2 ε₀^3 ), which doesn't sound right. That can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formulas. Let me think about it another way. The Poynting vector S is the energy flux, so the energy density u should be related to the Poynting vector. Oh wait, maybe the energy density is equal to S divided by c. Because since S is power per area (energy per volume), so u = S / c. Let's see: if S is 5 W/m², then u would be 5 / c. But what is c? The speed of light is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So 5 / (3e8) is 5/(3e8) ≈ 1.666e-8 W/m²·s.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the units straight. 1 W/m² is 1 J/(m²·s). So the energy density u is in J/m³. So, 5 W/m² is 5 J/(m²·s). Then, S/c would have units (J/(m²·s)) / (m/s) ) = (J/(m²·s)) * (s/m) ) = J/(m^3 ), which is correct for energy density.

So S/c = (5) / (3e8) ) → 5/(3e8) ≈ 1.666e-8 J/m³. Now, but wait, the options in the problem are in terms of ergs per cubic meter. I remember that 1 joule is 10^7 ergs. Because 1 J = 10^7 erg. So, 1.666e-8 J/m³ = 1.666e-8 * 1e7 erg/m³ = 1.666e-1 erg/m³, which is about 0.1666 erg/m³.

Wait, but none of the options seem to match that. Let me look again at the options. The options are:

A: 1/2 erg/m^3 → 0.5
B: 1/3 → ~0.333
C: 1/8 → 0.125
D: 3/6 → 0.5
E: 1/5 → 0.2
F: 1/4 → 0.25
G: 2/4 → 0.5
H: 3/4 → 0.75
I: 1/6 → ~0.1666
J: 2/6 → ~0.3333.

Wait, option I is 1/6, which is about 0.1666, which is what I calculated (1.666e-1 is 0.1666). So that's option I. So the correct answer would be option I. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.

Another approach: The energy density u is given by u = S²/(2ε₀ c), because I believe u = (S²)/(2ε₀ c). Wait, no, earlier I thought u = S/c. Let me try to derive this.

The Poynting vector S is equal to E × H. For a plane wave, H = E/(c ε₀ ), so S = E × (E/(c ε₀ )) ) = E²/(c ε₀ ). So S = E²/(c ε₀ ). 

The energy density u is (1/2 ε₀) E². So substituting E² from S: E² = c ε₀ S. Then u = (1/2 ε₀) (c ε₀ S) ) = (c ε₀ S) / (2 ε₀ ) ) = c S / 2. So u = (c S)/2. Wait, that would make u = (3e8 m/s * 5 W/m²) / 2 → (1.5e9)/(2) → 7.5e8 J/m³, which is 7.5e8 * 1e-7 erg/m³ → 750 erg/m³. But that's way higher than the options provided, so that can't be right. So my earlier approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for u. Let me think again. I think another formula is that u = (1/2) ε₀ E². So u = (1/2) ε₀ (c H )², since E = c H. So substituting H:

u = (1/2) ε₀ (c H )² = (1/2) ε₀ c² H². 

But another way, since in a plane wave, E and H are related. So H = E/(c ε₀ ) → H² = E²/(c² ε₀² ). So substituting into u:

u = (1/2) ε₀ c² (E²/(c² ε₀² )) ) = (1/2) ( ε₀ c² E² )/(c² ε₀² ) ) → (1/2) E²/( ε₀ ). Which makes u = (E²)/(2 ε₀ ), which is the same as earlier. So that doesn't help because I'm back to where I was before.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the energy density in terms of the Poynting vector and the speed of light. Wait, if S is the power per unit area, then the energy density u is S multiplied by the time it takes for the energy to pass through a unit area. The time would be the distance divided by the speed of light. Wait, no, perhaps u = S * (1/c), because S is power per area, so (power is energy per time), so u would be (power per area) multiplied by (time per unit area) to get energy per volume.

Wait, let me think: S is (Power) / (Area) → S has units W/m² = J/(m² s). Energy density u is J/m³. So, to get from J/m² s to J/m³, you multiply by s/m, because (J/(m² s)) * (s/m) )= J/m³. So, u = S * (1/c), because c is in m/s, so 1/c has units s/m.

Well, that would make u = (5) / (3e8) = 5/(3e8) → approximately 1.666e-8 J/m³. Converting to ergs, since 1 J = 1e7 erg, so 1.666e-8 * 1e7 = 0.1666 erg/m³. So that's 1/6, which is option I. So the correct answer is I. But wait, the initial formula I thought about using S/c gave this result, so perhaps the correct formula is u = S/(c).

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the Poynting vector is the energy flux, and for a plane wave, the energy density is u = S²/(2 ε₀ c) → but that would give a different result. Let me compute that. If S is 5, then S squared is 25. Divided by (2 * ε₀ * c), which is 2 * 8.85e-12 F/m * 3e8 m/s → 2 * 8.85e-12 * 3e8 = approx 5.31e-3. So 25 / (5.31e-3 ) → approx 46800, which is 4.68e4. That doesn't make sense—so perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The Poynting vector S is the energy flux (energy per area per time). The energy density u is the energy per volume (so, in time, u would be S in the direction of propagation multiplied by the volume, but perhaps more accurately, for a wave moving in the z-direction, u = S * (1/c) because the wave's energy propagates at c, so the energy per volume is S (power per area) multiplied by the time it takes to pass through a unit area (t=1/c). So u = S/(c).

So, 5 W/m² → 5/(3e8) → approximately 1.666e-8 J/m³ → 1.666e-1 erg/m³ (since 1 J=1e7 erg). So 1.666e-1 erg/m³ is approximately 1/6 erg/m³, which is option I.

So the correct answer should be option I, which is 1/6 erg/m³. Looking at the options, option I is (1/6) erg/m³.

To determine the average energy density of a plane wave with a Poynting vector \( S = 5 \, \text{W/m}^2 \), we use the relationship between the Poynting vector and the energy density. The Poynting vector represents the energy flux, and the energy density \( u \) is related by \( u = \frac{S}{c} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( u \)
Substitute \( S = 5 \, \text{W/m}^2 \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
\[
u = \frac{S}{c} = \frac{5}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.666 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{J/m}^3
\]

### Step 2: Convert \( u \) to ergs per cubic meter
Since \( 1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{erg} \), convert \( 1.666 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{J/m}^3 \) to ergs:
\[
u = 1.666 \times 10^{-8} \times 10^7 = 0.1666 \, \text{erg/m}^3
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The calculated value \( 0.1666 \, \text{erg/m}^3 \) corresponds to \( \frac{1}{6} \, \text{erg/m}^3 \), which matches option **I**.
