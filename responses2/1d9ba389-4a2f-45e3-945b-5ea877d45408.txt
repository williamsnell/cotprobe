Okay, so I've got this question about factors that account for individual differences in problem-solving. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking what factors cause these differences. I remember from school that there are a lot of variables that influence someone's ability to solve problems. I think it's important to consider various aspects like biology, environment, personality, and maybe even environment and personality somehow.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A is age and gender. Well, I know that older people might have more experience, but does that directly affect problem-solving? Maybe, but it's just one aspect. Option B is birth order and marital status. That makes me think about genetics, especially the idea of genetics affecting things like IQ and problem-solving. But again, it's a subset.

Option C is sleep patterns and dietary habits. Sleep is definitely crucial for many cognitive functions, including problem-solving. Also, a balanced diet supports brain health, which could help in problem-solving. So this seems like a good candidate.

Option D talks about astrological sign, language, proficiency, motivation, personality, intelligence, background knowledge, and application. That's a broad category. It includes personality traits, which are pretty common in explaining differences. So D is a comprehensive option that covers a lot of bases.

Option E is social media and television habits. I know that social media can affect personality, maybe even interfere with problem-solving. But I'm not sure this is a primary factor or if it's a factor at all. It might be more of a secondary effect.

Option F is physical strength. That's a tough one because very strong people might have other factors that compensate. But it's definitely a factor that can influence problem-solving.

Option G is motivation and personality, intelligence, background, etc. This seems very broad. It includes personality, which is a big driver. So G would encompass many aspects but is a general category.

Option H is motivation and personality, etc. Wait, isn't that the same as G? Maybe. So H is more about the underlying personality and factors that influence it.

Option I is height and weight. I don't think this is a significant factor. These are more biological, but they're not as directly linked to problem-solving as other factors.

Option J is handwriting and artistic ability. That doesn't make much sense. These are probably unrelated.

So, now I'm trying to decide between the options D, G, and H. H combines motivation and personality, which includes factors like personality, intelligence, background, etc. D is a broader category, including both personality and other traits like motivation. So which one is better?

I remember that factors like intelligence, motivation, and personality are often discussed in the context of problem-solving. They influence how someone approaches challenges and their willingness to engage with them. So H covers these aspects comprehensively.

Option D, while broad, includes personality, which is a big part of why some people are better at problem-solving. But D doesn't mention motivation or intelligence, which are also big drivers. H includes all those elements, making it a more complete answer.

So the best answer would be H: motivation and personality, intelligence, background knowledge, memory, and application of knowledge. That seems to encapsulate a lot of factors that contribute to problem-solving differences.

The correct answer is H: motivation and personality, intelligence, background knowledge, memory, and application of knowledge. These factors are central to explaining individual differences in problem-solving abilities, encompassing both personality traits and cognitive skills.

Answer: H
