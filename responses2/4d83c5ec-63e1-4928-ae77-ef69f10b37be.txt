Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a singer presenting his three-premise argument in addition to appealing to the case of the drowning child because... The options are A to J. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through step by step.

First, I should probably understand what each option is saying. Let me read them again.

Option A: He argues that moral claims can only be justified through logical reasoning and real-life examples. Hmm, that seems a bit too vague. I'm not sure about this one.

Option B: He believes abstract arguments are more likely to convince one to act. Well, abstract arguments are about theories or general principles, not specific cases. But the question is about appealing to a specific case, the drowning child. So maybe B is not the right answer.

Option C: He believes that using both abstract and emotional appeals provides a balanced perspective. So, using both types of arguments. That makes sense because sometimes emotional appeals can counter abstract ones, leading to a balanced view. I'm leaning towards this.

Option D: He wants to appeal to the reader's reason and not just pull at the reader's heartstrings. This is about reasoning, but the question is about combining arguments, not just using reason. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: He wants to show that moral obligations can arise from both rational argument and emotional response. That sounds like he's combining both types of reasoning. So E could be a possibility.

Option F: He believes arguments are a more efficient way to appeal to one's emotions. I'm not entirely sure. Using arguments might be more effective for emotions, but the question is why he's doing this extra appeal.

Option G: He believes the case of the drowning child will make his argument more relatable. Relatable is about making the case personal, which would tie into emotional appeals. So G is about making the case relatable for reasons of relevance.

Option H: He argues that our emotional reactions have no bearing on which moral claims are true. Wait, that's saying that emotions don't affect morality. But that seems contradictory because if an action is wrong in reality, emotions would play a role. So H seems incorrect.

Option I: He aims to appeal to both the logical and emotional aspects of the reader's mind. That makes sense because the singer is presenting multiple types of arguments. So I's a contender.

Option J: He thinks that a combination of argument and emotion is more effective than either alone. This is similar to I, but phrased differently. So J is also a possible answer.

The question is why he presents the three-premise argument alongside the emotional appeal. So the reasoning is likely about combining different types of arguments for a balanced perspective.

Wait, let's think about the premise. The case of the drowning child is an emotional appeal, right? So the singer is trying to not just appeal to the child's emotions but also use logical or factual arguments. So why would he do that? Because an emotional appeal alone might not be enough, and a logical one might be too. So combining them would make a balanced argument.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says using both abstract and emotional. That sounds right because abstract arguments provide structure, while emotional appeals add depth.

Option J says a combination of argument and emotion is more effective than either alone. So that's also a point in favor of J.

Wait, but the question says, "in addition to appealing to the case of the drowning child." So he's adding the emotional appeal, but perhaps in doing so, he's also using other types of arguments. So perhaps the answer is that he uses both abstract and emotional.

Wait, but the question is why he's doing that. The options are what he believes is the reason. Let's see what each option says.

Option C: he believes that using both abstract and emotional provides a balanced perspective. So, he's not just appealing to the child's emotions, but also uses abstract arguments to support his point.

Option J: he thinks that a combination of argument and emotion is more effective than either alone. So he's combining the emotional appeal with other arguments.

So both C and J are possible, but the phrasing is a bit different. The question is, why does he do this? So perhaps the underlying idea is that using both types of reasoning (abstract and emotional) provides a more balanced and effective argument.

Alternatively, option C focuses on using both types, abstract and emotional. Option J is about combining the emotional approach with other arguments.

Wait, but the question says he presents three-premise arguments in addition to appealing to the case of the drowning child. So he's using the emotional appeal and adding more arguments to it. So the reason would be that combining emotional with logical or factual arguments.

So, looking at the options, C says using both abstract and emotional. Does that fit? Or J is about combining with emotion and other arguments.

Wait, the options are:

C: using both abstract and emotional
J: combination of argument and emotion

But the question is about why he presents these two: the three-premise argument and the emotional appeal. So perhaps he's using more than one type. So the reason would be that using both types of arguments (abstract and emotional) provides a better perspective.

So option C says he believes that abstract arguments are more likely, but the question is about his choice. So the correct answer is C or J.

Wait, but the three-premise argument is part of his presentation. So perhaps he's using a three premise argument, which is a form of logical reasoning, in addition to the emotional appeal.

So, in that case, the best answer would be C: he believes that using both abstract and emotional provides a balanced perspective.

Alternatively, why does he do that? It's probably to combine both types of reasoning (logical and emotional) to make an effective argument.

So, between C and J, I think C is more about using both types. J is about combining with emotion and possibly other arguments. Hmm.

Alternatively, I should think about what each option says.

Option C: Using both abstract and emotional. So the singer is using abstract reasoning (like a three premise argument) and emotional appeals.

Option J: a combination of argument and emotion is more effective than either alone. So the combination is better than each alone. So perhaps the singer is using both emotional and other types.

So, the question is why he does this. The three premises are about his own argument, and the emotional appeal is about the case of the drowning child.

Wait, the question says he presents his three-premise argument in addition to appealing to the case of the drowning child.

So perhaps he is presenting both types: the three premises (which are more logical or factual) and the emotional appeal. So the reason is that using both provides a balanced perspective.

Looking back, option C is about using both types. So the correct answer would be C or J.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of another approach.

The question is about why the singer presents these two methods. He is using two different types of reasoning: logical (three premises) and emotional. So the answer would be that he believes using both types of arguments provides a balanced perspective.

So option C says that. So the answer is C.

Wait, but J says a combination is more effective than either alone. So the reason is that the combination is better. So J's reasoning is that when you combine emotional and other arguments, it's more effective.

So which is the underlying reason? The question is about the reason he presents them.

Option C: he believes that using both abstract and emotional provides a balanced perspective.

Option J: he thinks a combination of argument and emotion is more effective.

So, the singer is presenting both types, perhaps because he wants to cover more bases, including emotional aspects.

But the question's wording: in addition to appealing to the case, why would he do that.

So, the answer is that he combines both types of reasoning to get a more comprehensive argument.

Looking at the options, J says a combination is more effective than either alone. That's the point.

Wait, but option C says "using both abstract and emotional," which may not be quite accurate because option C is about abstract and emotional. But option J is about a combination, which might be the same as adding emotional to other arguments.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The question is about why he presents both an emotional appeal and a three-premise argument. So the reason is that combining both types makes the argument more effective.

So the answer is that he uses both abstract and emotional reasoning, which is option C, because he believes that abstract arguments can provide structure, and emotional appeals can add depth. So together, they provide a balanced perspective.

Alternatively, option J says a combination is more effective than either alone. So that's about the effect of combining, not about the method.

Wait, option J is phrased as "he thinks that a combination of argument and emotion is more effective than either alone." So that's about the effectiveness, not the method.

So, the underlying reason would be that using both types of reasoning (abstract and emotional) leads to a more balanced and effective argument.

So, the correct answer is C.

The question asks why the singer presents his three-premise argument in addition to appealing to the case of the drowning child. The analysis evaluates the options to determine the best fit:

- **Option A**: While moral claims can be justified through reasoning, this option is too vague and does not address the specific method of combining abstract and emotional arguments.
  
- **Option B**: Abstract arguments are more likely to convince, but this option focuses on abstract reasoning and does not explain the combination with emotional appeals.

- **Option C**: This option suggests that using both abstract and emotional arguments provides a balanced perspective. This aligns with the idea that combining these two types of reasoning (structure and depth) enhances the argument's effectiveness.

- **Option D**: appealing to reason alone contradicts the question's focus on combining emotional and logical elements.

- **Option E**: This option ties emotional reactions to moral claims, which is not the primary focus of the question.

- **Option F**: While efficient, this option does not explain the combination of arguments with emotional appeals.

- **Option G**: Relatability is a benefit of emotional appeals, but this option does not address the combination method.

- **Option H**: This contradicts the idea that emotions do not affect morality, which is irrelevant to the question.

- **Option I**: This emphasizes reasoning and emotions together, which is the correct approach to a balanced argument.

- **Option J**: This emphasizes the effectiveness of combination over individual arguments, but it does not explain the method of combination.

The best answer is **C**, as it highlights the use of both abstract and emotional reasoning to provide a balanced perspective, which directly addresses the question's focus on combining emotional appeals with logical arguments.
