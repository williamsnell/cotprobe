Okay, so I've got this question here about an electrical circuit, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see. The question is about finding the current in a circuit with inductive and resistive components. 

Alright, the coil has an inductive reactance of 60 ohms and a resistance of 25 ohms, connected to a 130-volt line. Wait, a-C line, so it's an alternating current source. Oh right, in AC circuits, the voltage is in phase with the current, but since this is inductive, the current lags behind the voltage. But wait, the question just asks for the current, regardless of phase. So I don't need to worry about the phase shift, just the impedance.

Impedance in AC circuits is the total opposition to current, and it's calculated using Ohm's Law but for AC. The formula is impedance (Z) equals the square root of (R squared plus X squared), where R is resistance and X is reactance. Oh wait, but wait, inductive reactance is inductive, so it's X_L. So that's correct.

So the coil has R = 25 ohms and X_L = 60 ohms. So Z = sqrt(25² + 60²). Let me calculate that. 25 squared is 625, 60 squared is 3600. Adding them gives 4225. The square root of 4225 is... let's see. 65 times 65 is 4225. So Z is 65 ohms.

Now, the voltage is 130 volts. Oh, wait, wait! Wait a second, because sometimes in AC circuits, the voltage is phasor to current, but voltage and current are in phase if the load is resistive. If the load is inductive, the current lags, but the voltage across the load leads the current by 90 degrees. So the power factor is zero for an inductive load. But the question just asks for the current, regardless of phase. So the current is calculated using the phasor current, which is V divided by Z.

So current I = V / Z = 130 V / 65 ohms. Let's compute that. 130 divided by 65 is 2. So the current is 2 amperes. Looking at the options, that's option F: 2.0 amp.

Wait, wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Oh, the question says "the a-c line of 130 volts." Does that mean the voltage across the circuit? Yes, I think so. So the formula I used is correct.

To determine the current in the circuit, we first calculate the impedance \( Z \) using the formula:

\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_L^2}
\]

where \( R = 25 \, \Omega \) (resistance) and \( X_L = 60 \, \Omega \) (inductive reactance). Substituting the values:

\[
Z = \sqrt{25^2 + 60^2} = \sqrt{625 + 3600} = \sqrt{4225} = 65 \, \Omega
\]

Next, we use Ohm's Law to find the current \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{V}{Z}
\]

The voltage \( V \) is given as \( 130 \, \text{V} \), so:

\[
I = \frac{130}{65} = 2 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, the current through the circuit is \( 2.0 \, \text{A} \), which corresponds to option F.
