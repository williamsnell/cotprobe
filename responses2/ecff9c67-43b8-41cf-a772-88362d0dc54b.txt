Question:

A women's action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men's club to admit women to membership. The women's group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men's club was subject to the state's anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women's group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men's club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor's office building, carrying signs that read, "The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don't vote for him. " The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney's office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor's official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney's suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. "The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because

Options:

A: the women's group lacks standing.
B: the women's group has not exhausted all other legal remedies.
C: the federal court does not have jurisdiction over state laws.
D: the men's club is not a public entity.
E: the women's group did not obtain the mayor's permission for picketing.
F: the picketing does not violate the city ordinances.
G: the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.
H: there is no case or controversy.
I: the case lacks adequate ripeness.
J: the picketing was peaceful and did not cause any disturbance.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about a legal case involving a women's action group and their attempt to get into the mayor's office. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: The women's group wanted to join the men's club but couldn't get in. They started a lawsuit in federal court to prove the men's club wasn't under the anti-discrimination law. They tried to picket the mayor and district attorney multiple times. The key points are that they pickedet the mayor and district attorney's offices, and the women's group tried to get permission from the mayor to do so.

Looking at the city ordinances, section 201 says they can't picket inside or next to city hall unless the mayor's permission is given. Section 202 allows picketting before or about someone's residence, but the city can't prevent meetings or assemblies on their premises. The federal court is considering a declaratory judgment to determine if the men's club is under the law.

The question is why the federal court might avoid a declaratory judgment. The options are A to J.

Let's go through each option:

A: The women's group lacks standing. Standing means they have a valid case. They have to prove the men's club isn't under the law. But they successfully started a lawsuit to show the club isn't under the anti-discrimination law. So they have standing. So A is wrong.

B: The group hasn't exhausted all legal remedies. Well, they did apply for permission, but maybe they didn't file all the required documents. However, the federal court is asking for a declaratory judgment, not a ruling on whether the procedure was followed. So perhaps the issue is more about whether the case was properly initiated, not about remaining without a remedy. So B might not be the main reason.

C: The court doesn't have jurisdiction over state laws. But federal courts have jurisdiction over state laws. So C is probably not correct.

D: The men's club isn't a public entity. Wait, the options say "the men's club is not a public entity." But in the question, the group is trying to get into the men's club, which is a public place. So if the group were trying to get in, they'd have to be a public entity because they were trying to join a public club. So if the men's club is a public entity, the women's group's attempt to join it is invalid because you can't join a public club if you're trying to join it. So D would make senseâ€”because D says the men's club isn't a public entity, which would mean the group couldn't have gotten in. So the court would likely say they lack standing because they can't join a public club if they are trying to join it. So D is a possible correct answer.

E: The women's group didn't get permission. But they did file applications for permission and state the purpose, etc. So they did get permission. So E is incorrect.

F: The picketing didn't violate the city laws. Wait, the city laws say they can't picket on city hall or near it. So if they did picket the mayor and district attorney's offices, that's adjacent to city hall, so they're violating section 201. So F would be incorrect because the violation occurred, so the court would find it unlawful.

G: The relief sought is essentially advisory. A declaratory judgment is for a specific purpose. If the city's laws were violated, the court would likely find out and order the law to change. So G is incorrect.

H: No case or controversy. Well, this is a known case. I remember a similar situation where the women's group was blocked by the city, and the court ruled against them. So H is incorrect.

I: The case is lacking adequate ripeness. A ripeness issue arises when there's insufficient evidence to prove the case. But in this case, the group successfully applied for permission and the lawsuit was started. So I is incorrect.

J: The picketing was peaceful. But the question says it was held peacefully, but that doesn't mean it didn't cause disturbance. The key point is whether they violated the city laws, not the nature of the picketing.

So the options left are A, B, D, F, etc. The correct answer is D: the men's club is not a public entity.

Wait, but wait. The question is about why the court would avoid a declaratory judgment. The women's group is trying to join the men's club, which is a public entity. So they can't join a public club if they are trying to join it. Therefore, the lack of standing is because they can't join a public club if they are attempting to join it. So the court would say they lack standing because the men's club is a public entity. So D is correct.

Alternatively, if the group was trying to get in, they would need to be a public entity, so they can't, so they lack standing. So the court would say they lack standing, which is option A. But wait, option A says women's group lacks standing, but if they can't join a public club, that also means they lack standing because they are trying to join a public club. So do they have standing? Standing is about proving the case, not about being a member of a public entity. So standing is about the case's merits, not the entity they're trying to join.

Wait, standing is about proving that you have the right to join the club. The fact that it's a public entity doesn't affect standing, unless the group's intent is to join it. But the group is trying to get in, so they can't. Therefore, the lack of standing is about the case's success in proving the case, not the entity they're attempting to join. So the correct reason is that the court doesn't have jurisdiction over state laws, but that's not an option. Wait, no. The question is why the court avoids a decision, so why would they fail to find the case valid.

Wait, the options are whether the court avoids a decision. The options are A to J. So the correct reason is that the group has the right to join a public club, making them unable to join it. So the lack of standing is about whether the case can be brought. But the options don't mention standing as a reason. Let me look again.

Looking at the options, option D is about the club not being a public entity. So the key issue is whether the group can join a public club, which is about the entity, not the case's merits. So that's why the court would avoid a decision. So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The women's group attempted to join a public club, but the city's laws prevented them from doing so. The key issue for the court is whether they lack standing because they can't join a public club if they are attempting to join it. The group's unsuccessful application for permission from the mayor and their inability to obtain it are valid grounds for lack of standing. This is because they failed to prove the case's success, and the facts do not exclude them from standing to join a public entity.
