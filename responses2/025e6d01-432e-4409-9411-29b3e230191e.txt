Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about vapor pressure of a mixture. Hmm, let me think. The question says that solvents A and B form an ideal solution. At room temperature, A has a vapor pressure of 345 torr and B has 213 torr. I need to find the vapor pressure of a mixture where the mole fraction of A is 0.285.

Wait, I remember that for ideal solutions, Raoult's Law applies. Oh right, Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of each component in the solution is equal to its mole fraction in the solution multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. So the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each component.

So, the formula should be P_total = X_A * P_A^0 + X_B * P_B^0. Since the mole fractions add up to 1, X_B is 1 - X_A. Oh wait, X_A is given as 0.285, so X_B would be 1 - 0.285 = 0.715.

Plugging the numbers in: P_A = X_A * 345 = 0.285 * 345. Let me calculate that. 0.285 * 300 is 85.5, and 0.285 *45 is 12.825, so total is 98.325 torr. Then P_B is 0.715 * 213. Let me compute that. 0.7 * 213 is 149.1, and 0.015 *213 is 3.195, so adding gives 152.295 torr.

Adding both partial pressures: 98.325 + 152.295 is approximately 250.62 torr. Looking at the options, I see E is 251, which is closest. So the answer should be E.

To determine the vapor pressure of a mixture where the mole fraction of solvent A is 0.285, we use Raoult's Law. The total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of A and B, calculated as:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = X_A \cdot P_A^0 + X_B \cdot P_B^0
\]

Given:
- \( P_A^0 = 345 \, \text{torr} \)
- \( P_B^0 = 213 \, \text{torr} \)
- \( X_A = 0.285 \)
- \( X_B = 1 - X_A = 0.715 \)

Calculating each component:
- \( P_A = X_A \cdot P_A^0 = 0.285 \cdot 345 = 98.325 \, \text{torr} \)
- \( P_B = X_B \cdot P_B^0 = 0.715 \cdot 213 = 152.295 \, \text{torr} \)

Adding the partial pressures:
\[
P_{\text{total}} = 98.325 + 152.295 = 250.62 \, \text{torr}
\]

The closest option to this value is **251 torr**.
