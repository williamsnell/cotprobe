Question:

Clare manages a piano store. Her utility function is given by Utility = w - 100, where w is the total of all monetary payments to her and 100 represents the monetary equivalent of the disutility of exerting effort to run the store. Her next best alternative to managing the store gives her zero utility. The store's revenue depends on random factors, with an equal chance of being $1,000 or $400. If shareholders offered to share half of the store's revenue with her, what would her expected utility be?

Options:

A: 300
B: 225
C: 100
D: 450
E: 350
F: 250
G: 150
H: 200
I: 500
J: 400

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem about Clare and her piano store. Let me read through the question again and break it down step by step. 

So, Clare's utility function is given as Utility = w - 100, where w is the total of all monetary payments to her. The store's revenue depends on random factors, either $1,000 or $400, each with equal chance. She gets half of the revenue back from shareholders. We need to find her expected utility.

Hmm, let's think about what each component means. Her utility is utility = w - 100. That means her utility depends on how much she pays for the store. If she gets less money, her utility could be lower. But wait, she gets half of the revenue. So, the revenue she gets is either half of $1,000 or half of $400. 

Wait, half of $1,000 is $500, and half of $400 is $200. So her payments (w) would be either $500 or $200, each with a 50% chance. 

But the question is about her utility, which is w minus 100. So for each scenario, her utility would be:

If revenue is $1,000, then w = $500. So utility is 500 -100=400.
If revenue is $400, then w = $200. So utility is 200 -100=100.

But wait, the problem says the store's revenue depends on these random factors. Wait, no, the store's revenue is either $1,000 or $400, each with 50% chance. Then, she gets half of that revenue. So, she pays w = revenue /2 â†’ so each revenue outcome leads to a different w.

But how does that affect her utility? Because her utility is based on the amount she pays. So for each scenario, her w is 500 or 200, so utility is 400 or 100, as I calculated.

Now, the problem says shareholders offer to share half of the store's revenue with her. So, the revenue she receives is half of the store's revenue, which aligns with what I thought. So she gets half, and that's her payment.

So, the expected utility would be the average of the two possible utilities. Because each scenario is equally likely (50% chance each), the expected utility is (400 + 100)/2 = 250.

Wait, but the options include 250 as option F. So the answer should be F:250.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let's go through again.

Case 1: Revenue is $1,000. She gets half, which is $500. Her payment w is $500. Utility is 500 -100=400.

Case 2: Revenue is $400. She gets half, which is $200. Her payment w is $200. Utility is 200 -100=100.

Each case has a 50% chance. So expected utility is (400 +100)/2 = 250. So yes, the expected utility is 250.

Wait, but the problem says the store's revenue is either $1,000 or $400, each with equal chance. So that's right. So the answer is F:250.

The problem involves Clare's utility function, which depends on the revenue she receives. She gets half of the store's revenue, and the revenue itself is either $1,000 or $400, each with a 50% chance.

1. **Revenue and Payment**:
   - If revenue is $1,000, Clare pays $500.
   - If revenue is $400, Clare pays $200.

2. **Utility Calculation**:
   - For $500 payment: Utility = 500 - 100 = 400.
   - For $200 payment: Utility = 200 - 100 = 100.

3. **Expected Utility**:
   - Since each scenario is equally likely, the expected utility is the average of the two utilities.
   - Expected Utility = (400 + 100) / 2 = 250.

Thus, Clare's expected utility is **250**.

**Answer:** F:250
