Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat: if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not? During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, "Logan is the friend of the white man." I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out which option matches the answer to this question based on Logan's Address. Let me start by reading the address again to understand the context.

The address is about Logan, an Indian leader who was a vocal advocate for peace and freedom. He was killed in a battle in 1779, which led to the US becoming a free country. Logan strongly supported the rights of his Indian compatriots but was opposed to white settlers. He called for revenge against those who killed him and his family.

The question is asking which Indian policy a sympathetic reader would support. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different policy related to Indian affairs in the early US.

I'll go through each option and see if it aligns with Logan's stance.

Option A: Exterminating all Indians. I don't think Logan was pro-terminator. His main concern was for his own safety, not the elimination of all Indians. But in the early US, this was a significant issue. However, Logan's policies were often more about self-protection than outright elimination. So maybe A is not the strongest choice.

Option B: Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways. Logan was against white settlers. His policies were more about strength and self-defense. He was against inducing Indian resistance, so B might not be his main policy.

Option C: Completely integrating Indians into American society. Logan opposed integration. He was against mixing the Indian and white populations. He preferred to keep them separate, especially regarding his own family. So C might not be the right choice.

Option D: Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico. I don't know if Logan supported migration. He was more about self-defense and self-respect. I don't recall him supporting migration as part of his policies.

Option E: Creating a separate state for Indians. Logan's policies were more about self-defense and resistance rather than creating new states. So E seems unrelated.

Option F: Placing Indians in internment camps. Logan's point was that people like him should be taken care of, but he wasn't promoting such conditions. He was opposed to harsher conditions and the use of torture. So F might not be his choice.

Option G: Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty. Logan definitely supported the idea of respecting Indian sovereignty and their rights. He was a proponent of self-defense and self-insulation, not against their rights. But it's possible he did support some form of respect. So G could be a contender.

Option H: Providing Indians with financial compensation for land taken by white settlers. This sounds like a form of land reform. Logan did support such policies, but I'm not sure if he was promoting this as a form of compensation or as a way to protect his own rights. From the address, I don't see much mention of financial compensation. His main focus was on self-protection and the rights of his own compatriots.

Option I: Ignoring Indian affairs and leaving them to their own devices. His policies were against ignoring Indian issues. He was more pro-Indian than against them. So I think this is not the answer.

Option J: Encouraging Indians to assimilate into white society. I don't think Logan was pro-assimilation. His stance was against mixing the two groups. So J is probably wrong.

So the options left are G and H. I'm trying to recall Logan's main policies. He was a strong advocate for his own safety, not for the general treatment of Indians. He opposed the introduction of white settlers and their policies. His main focus was on his own rights and the protection of his family. He wasn't promoting any form of state creation or financial compensation. He was against the use of violence and the introduction of new states or conditions that would harm the Indian community.

So Logan's policies were more about self-protection and respect. So, G is about respecting Indian territory, which aligns with his stance. H is about compensation, which he didn't support. So the answer should be G.

The sympathetic reader of Logan's Address would likely support the Indian policy that aligns with his stance of respecting Indian territory and sovereignty. Logan was a proponent of self-protection and the protection of his own rights, not necessarily of the Indian community as a whole. Therefore, the correct answer is G: Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty.

Answer: G
