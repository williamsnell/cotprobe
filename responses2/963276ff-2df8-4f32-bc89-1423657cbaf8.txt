Question:

Alex needs to borrow $\$10,\!000$ from the bank. The bank gives him two options. 1. A ten-year loan with an annual interest rate of $10\%$ compounded quarterly, with the condition that at the end of 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes. The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of the ten years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance. 2. A ten-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of $12\%$, with just one lump-sum payment at the end of the ten years. Find the positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes. Round your answer to the nearest dollar.

Okay, so Alex needs to borrow $10,000, and there are two loan options. I need to figure out which one he'll end up paying more and by how much. Let's take it step by step.

First, let me parse the two options.

Option 1 is a 10-year loan with 10% annual interest, compounded quarterly. But there's a condition: after 5 years, he has to make a payment of half of what he owes then. The remaining half will continue to accrue interest for another 5 years, and then he pays off the remaining balance.

Option 2 is a simple interest loan of 12% annually. He just pays one lump sum at the end of 10 years.

I need to compute the total amount Alex has to pay under each option and find the positive difference between them.

Let me start with Option 1.

Option 1: Compounded quarterly, 10% annual interest, and payment after 5 years.

First, since it's compounded quarterly, the interest rate per quarter is 10%/4 = 2.5% per quarter. There are 4 quarters in a year.

So, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- P is the principal amount ($10,000)
- r is the annual interest rate (10% or 0.10)
- n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (4)
- t is the time in years (5 years for the first part)

Wait, but in this case, Alex has to make a payment after 5 years. So, I think the way to calculate this is to compute the amount owed after 5 years, then pay half, and the other half continues for another 5 years.

Let me break it down.

First, compute the amount owed after 5 years without any payment.

A = 10,000*(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5)

Compute that:

0.10/4 = 0.025

4*5 = 20

So, A = 10,000*(1.025)^20

I need to calculate (1.025)^20. Hmm. Let me recall that (1.025)^20 is approximately... I think it's around 1.6386? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, I can compute it step by step or use a calculator. Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

But for the sake of this thought process, let's suppose (1.025)^20 ≈ 1.638616.

So, A ≈ 10,000 * 1.638616 ≈ $16,386.16

So, after 5 years, Alex owes approximately $16,386.16.

Then he has to pay half of that, which is 16,386.16 / 2 = $8,193.08

The remaining $8,193.08 continues to accrue interest for another 5 years.

So, we need to compute this remaining amount for 5 more years.

Compute the interest on $8,193.08 at 10% compounded quarterly for 5 years.

Again, n = 4, r = 0.10, t = 5.

But wait, the formula is the same as before: A = P*(1 + r/n)^(nt)

So, A = 8,193.08*(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5)

We already know that (1.025)^20 ≈1.638616, so:

A = 8,193.08 * 1.638616 ≈ ?

Let me compute 8,193.08 * 1.638616.

Wait, 8,193.08 * 1.638616.

Let me approximate:

8,193 * 1.6386 ≈ ?

I can compute 8,000 * 1.6386 = 13,108.8

193 * 1.6386 ≈ 193 * 1.6 = approx 308.8, plus 193 * 0.0386≈7.43, so total ~308.8 +7.43=316.23

So, total: 13,108.8 + 316.23 = approx 13,425.03

So, approximately $13,425.03 is the amount owed after 10 years.

Then, Alex has to pay this amount. So, total payment under Option 1 is:

First payment: $8,193.08

Second payment: $13,425.03

Total: 8,193.08 + 13,425.03 ≈ 21,618.11

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation for the 5-year part after the first payment.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula.

So, the amount owed after 5 years: 10,000*(1.025)^20 = 10,000*(1.638616415) ≈16,386.16

Half of that is 8,193.08. So, the remaining principal is 8,193.08, which will accumulate interest for 5 more years.

Compute the amount after 5 years on 8,193.08:

A = 8,193.08*(1.025)^20

But wait, (1.025)^20 is the same as before, which is approximately 1.638616.

So, 8,193.08 * 1.638616 ≈8,193.08 * 1.638616.

Let me compute 8,193.08 * 1.638616:

First, 8,193.08 * 1.6 = 13,108.928

Then, 8,193.08 * 0.038616 ≈ let's compute 8,193.08 * 0.03 = 245.7924, 8,193.08 * 0.008616 ≈ approx 8,193.08 * 0.008 = 65.5446, and 8,193.08 * 0.000616 ≈approx 5.05.

Adding them up: 245.7924 + 65.5446 = 311.337 +5.05≈316.387

So total is 13,108.928 + 316.387 ≈13,425.315

So, approximately $13,425.32

Thus, the total payment is 8,193.08 +13,425.32 = 21,618.40

So approximately $21,618.40 under Option 1.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me make sure.

Wait, the first payment is $8,193.08, which is half of $16,386.16, correct.

Then, the remaining $8,193.08 is paid as principal, then for the next 5 years, it's compounded at 10% quarterly.

Thus, using the same formula again, A = 8,193.08*(1.025)^20 = 16,386.16 / 2 * 1.025^20 = 8,193.08 * 1.638616 ≈13,425.315, as before.

So total is 8,193.08 +13,425.315≈21,618.395, which we can round to $21,618.40.

Wait, but wait, let me check my calculation again. Because 8,193.08 added to 13,425.32 gives 21,618.40.

So, Option 1 total: $21,618.40

Option 2: Simple interest at 12% over 10 years.

Simple interest formula is A = P(1 + rt)

So, P = 10,000, r = 0.12, t =10

So, A = 10,000*(1 + 0.12*10) = 10,000*(1 +1.2) =10,000*2.2=22,000.

So, Option 2 total: $22,000

Wait, so the total amounts are $21,618.40 under Option 1 and $22,000 under Option 2.

The positive difference would be 22,000 -21,618.40= 381.60 dollars.

Rounded to the nearest dollar, that's $382.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A:381

B:383

C:384

D:382

E:16400

So, the positive difference is 382, which is option D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when dealing with interest, especially simple interest, it's easy to make a mistake.

Option 2:

Principal: $10,000

Rate: 12% per annum

Time:10 years

Simple interest: I = P*r*t =10,000 *0.12 *10= 12,000.

So total amount is 10,000 +12,000=22,000. Correct.

Option 1:

As above, total is approx $21,618.40.

Difference: 22,000 -21,618.40=381.60, which rounds to 382.

But the options include D:382, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but I had a thought—maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the first 5 years. Let me just double-check.

Compute Option 1:

After 5 years, amount owed is 10,000*(1.025)^20.

(1.025)^20: Let me compute it more accurately.

We can use the formula (1 + r)^n, where r=0.025, n=20.

Alternatively, I can compute using the rule of 72 or use logarithms, but perhaps it's better to remember that (1.025)^20 is approximately 1.6386164. So, 10,000 *1.6386164=16,386.164.

So, half is 8,193.082. Then, the remaining 8,193.082 is compounded for another 5 years.

Again, (1.025)^20 is 1.6386164, so 8,193.082 *1.6386164 ≈8,193.082 *1.6386164.

Let me compute 8,193.082 *1.6386164.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 8,193.082 *1.6386164.

Alternatively, I can compute it as 8,193.082 *1.6386164 ≈8,193.082 *1.6386.

Compute 8,193.082 *1.6386.

Let me approximate:

8,193.082 *1.6 = 13,108.9312

8,193.082 *0.0386 ≈ 316.3. So total is 13,108.9312 +316.3≈13,425.2312

So, approximately $13,425.23.

Thus, total payment is 8,193.082 +13,425.23 ≈21,618.31.

So, $21,618.31.

So the difference is 22,000 -21,618.31=381.69, which is about 382.

So, the answer is D:382.

Wait, but let me check Option 1 again because I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the first payment.

Wait, after 5 years, Alex has to pay half of what he owes, which is 16,386.16 / 2 =8,193.08.

The remaining 8,193.08 is then compounded for another 5 years.

Again, (1.025)^20=1.6386164, so 8,193.08 *1.6386164 ≈13,425.31.

So, 8,193.08 +13,425.31=21,618.39.

So the total is $21,618.39.

So, the difference between 21,618.39 and 22,000 is 381.61, which is approximately 382.

So, the answer is D.
