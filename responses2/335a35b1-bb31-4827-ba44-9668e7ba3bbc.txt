Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cancer cells grown in culture and how they compare to normal cells in culture. Let's try to break it down.

The question is asking which statement is true about cancer cells compared to normal cells. The options are A through J. I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: Do not have the ability to metastasize. Metastasis is when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body. I know that cancer cells do undergo apoptosis, which can lead to metastasis, so this might not be correct.

Option B: Divide an indefinite number of times. Oh wait, normal cells typically divide a limited number of times before they die or stop dividing. Cancer cells, though, can divide much more frequently because they can undergo mitosis even in the absence of a proper environment. So, this might not be true either.

Option C: Undergo programmed cell death. No, both cancer and normal cells undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) when necessary. So this can't be the correct answer.

Option D: Can grow without a nutrient supply. I think that's a key difference. Without the right nutrients, normal cells can't grow. I recall that stem cells require a lot of nutrients to divide, but cancer cells might have different requirements, but wait, can they even grow without nutrients? I'm not sure. I think in some cases, cancer cells might not be able to survive without nutrients, but maybe not all. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option E: Do not require oxygen to survive. I'm pretty sure that normal cells, including normal cancer cells, require oxygen because they need to grow and divide. Without oxygen, they die. So this might be incorrect.

Option F: Proliferate to the same cell density. Wait, in normal culture, cells might grow to a certain density, and perhaps cancer cells do the same, but I'm not certain. I think both can reach the same density, so this might not be unique to cancer cells.

Option G: Are able to repair DNA damage efficiently. Both cancer and normal cells can repair DNA damage, right? So this can't be the answer.

Option H: Are not susceptible to mutations. I'm not sure. I think some cancer cells might have mutations, but not all. Or maybe normal cells are less susceptible. However, the question is about what's true about cancer cells compared to normal cells. So if both can be susceptible, then H might not be correct.

Option I: Require a surface for attachment in order to grow. I remember that for cells to grow, especially those that need to attach to a surface (like some cancer cell lines), they need a specific attachment site. So yes, this seems to be a true statement. But wait, the question is about the last option, which is about cancer cells compared to normal cells. So if normal cells also require an attachment site, then this would be true for both. But the question is which option is a characteristic of cancer cells in comparison to normal ones.

Wait, let me think again. So the question is, what's similar about cancer cells to normal cells. For example, both can divide, both can grow without much, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Option D: Can grow without a nutrient supply. I think that in normal conditions, cancer cells require certain nutrients to survive and grow. Without them, they die. So this would mean normal cells don't grow without nutrients, which is correct. But do cancer cells require more, or can they survive without? I'm not exactly sure, but I think cancer cells can't survive without nutrients. So this might not be accurate for normal cells. Or wait, maybe they do? I'm a bit stuck here.

Option E: Do not require oxygen. Both, as far as I know, require oxygen. So if both cells require oxygen, then E would not be a correct statement about cancer cells compared to normal ones. Because the question is about what's true for cancer cells in comparison to normal ones. If both do require oxygen, then the statement D is incorrect for normal cells, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is which is similar to normal cells. For example, options about their ability to divide, proliferation, etc.

Another angle: the question is about the last character of the response, so the correct answer is in the options, and the user says the answer must end with the letter they chose. So perhaps I can focus on the correct statement.

Wait, the question is "similar to normal cells." So what is true about cancer cells compared to normal cells.

Option B: Divide an indefinite number of times. I think normal cells can't divide indefinitely. They have a limited cell cycle. Cancer cells can divide rapidly, so they can divide many times. So this might be the correct answer.

Option D: Can grow without a nutrient supply. I think this is incorrect for normal cells because they need nutrients. But cancer cells might not require them, but I'm not certain. Or, wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Maybe both cancer and normal cells require nutrients. So if D is correct for normal cells, but not for cancer, then the answer is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because normal cells don't divide forever, whereas cancer cells can. So B is a correct statement about cancer cells compared to normal cells.

Wait, another thought: the question is about "similar to normal cells." So for example, both can proliferate to the same density. I think both can. So F is correct.

But I'm trying to find what is similar. The question is about what is true about cancer cells compared to normal cells. So, for example, do normal cells divide indefinitely? No. Do cancer cells divide indefinitely? Yes. So statement B is correct.

Option E: Do not require oxygen. That's incorrect because both do. So E is not correct.

Option A: Do they have the ability to metastasize? No, as I thought earlier. So A is incorrect.

Option G: Can repair DNA damage. Both can, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Susceptibility to mutations. I'm not sure. Both can have mutations, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Require a surface for attachment. I think cancer cells require a surface, but so do normal cells. So this statement is correct for both but not the answer because the question is about what is similar to normal cells.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true for cancer cells compared to normal. So which option is a characteristic of cancer cells that isn't true for normal cells.

Option D: Can grow without a nutrient supply. I think both require nutrients. So D is incorrect for normal cells, but correct for cancer? Or perhaps not. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: proliferate to the same cell density. Both can reach the same density, so F is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what's similar to normal cells. So which statement is true for cancer cells compared to normal cells. For example, both can divide many times, so statement B is correct.

So the answer is B: divide an indefinite number of times.

To determine which statement is true about cancer cells grown in culture compared to normal cells, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Cancer cells can undergo apoptosis, which can lead to metastasization. Therefore, they do not have the ability to metastasize, making this statement incorrect.
- **Option B**: Normal cells typically divide a limited number of times before they die, while cancer cells can divide indefinitely, leading to the indefinite division of cancer cells. This statement is correct.
- **Option C**: Both cancer and normal cells undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) when necessary. Thus, this statement is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Normal cells require specific nutrients to survive and divide, but this is not the case for cancer cells, which can divide without relying on nutrients. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
- **Option E**: Both cancer and normal cells require oxygen to grow. Thus, this statement is incorrect.
- **Option F**: Both normal and cancer cells can reach the same cell density. This statement is correct.
- **Option G**: Both cancer and normal cells can repair DNA damage efficiently. Thus, this statement is incorrect.
- **Option H**: Both cancer and normal cells are susceptible to mutations. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
- **Option I**: Both cancer and normal cells require a surface for attachment to grow. This statement is correct.
- **Option J**: Both cancer and normal cells do not display contact inhibition. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

The question asks for what is true about cancer cells compared to normal cells. The most accurate statement is **Option B**, as cancer cells can divide indefinitely, unlike normal cells.

**Answer: B**
