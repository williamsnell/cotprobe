Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the density of blood by mixing two liquids. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that drops of blood are placed in a mixture of xylene and bromobenzene. Xylene has a density of 0.867 g/cm³, and bromobenzene is 1.497 g/cm³. They're mixing them in a way that the drops don't rise or sink, meaning it's a homogeneous mixture. The mixture is made up of 72% xylene and 28% bromobenzene by volume. The question is asking for the density of the blood.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix two liquids, the density of the mixture isn't just the average of the two densities. Instead, it's a weighted average based on their volumes. Because density is mass over volume, each component's contribution depends on its volume in the mixture.

So, the formula would be something like (mass of xylene + mass of bromobenzene) divided by (total volume of the mixture). 

But wait, since they're given by volume percentages, I can assume that the volumes of xylene and bromobenzene are 72% and 28% respectively. But wait, density is mass over volume, so I need to find the mass of each component based on their volume.

Wait, but density is mass/volume. So for each component, mass would be density multiplied by volume. Since they're in a mixture by volume percentages, I can assume that the volumes are additive, but the mass isn't because they're different densities.

So, for each component:

Moles? Wait, no, since we're dealing with volumes, maybe it's simpler to consider mass fractions based on volume. So, for xylene, the mass is density_xylene * (0.72 V), and for bromobenzene, it's density_bromobenzene * (0.28 V). But wait, the volumes are the same for both, so the mass fractions would be (density * volume percentage) for each.

But wait, actually, when mixing, each component's mass is (density * volume fraction). So the total mass would be (0.72 * 0.867 g/cm³) + (0.28 * 1.497 g/cm³) for the mass.

And the total volume is 1 (since 72% + 28% is 100%)—so the total volume is 100% of a unit, say 1 cm³. Wait, no, that's not correct because volume percentages don't directly translate to volume fractions. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of mass fractions.

Wait, no, actually, the correct approach is to take the mass of each component, add them up, then divide by the total volume (which is the sum of their volumes, assuming they're in the same container).

Wait, but each volume is a part of the mixture, so for example, if the mixture is 72% xylene by volume, then 72% of the total volume is xylene, and 28% is bromobenzene.

But since density is mass per volume, the mass of xylene is 0.72 V * 0.867, and bromobenzene is 0.28 V * 1.497. Wait, but the V is the same for each, so when adding, the V would cancel out, because:

Density = (mass1 + mass2) / (volume1 + volume2)

But since (volume1 + volume2) is the total volume, which is 1, in this case.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say the total volume is V. Then, the volume of xylene is 0.72 V, and bromobenzene is 0.28 V. The mass of xylene is 0.72 V * 0.867 g/cm³, and bromobenzene is 0.28 V * 1.497 g/cm³. 

So the total mass is (0.72*0.867 + 0.28*1.497) * V, and the total volume is V.

So the density is (0.72 * 0.867 + 0.28 * 1.497) * V / V = 0.72 * 0.867 + 0.28 *1.497.

Ah, so the V cancels out, making the density simply the sum of each component's (volume fraction) density multiplied by their respective densities.

So I can compute each term:

0.72 * 0.867 = Let's compute that.

0.72 * 0.867: Let's compute 72 * 867, but since it's 0.72*0.867, that's 0.72 * 0.867. Let me compute 72 * 867 = 72 * 800 = 57,600, 72*67=4,824. So 57,600 + 4,824 = 62,424. Then, since 0.72 * 0.867 is 0.62424.

Wait, no, 0.72 is 72/100, 0.867 is 867/1000. So 72 * 867 = 72 * 800 = 57,600; 72 *67=4,824. So 57,600 +4,824 = 62,424. Now, the product is 62,424 / (100 * 1000) = 62,424 / 1e5 = 0.62424.

So that's 0.62424 g (since 0.72 * 0.867 = 0.62424).

Next term: 0.28 *1.497. Let's compute 0.28 *1.497.

1.497 * 0.28: 1 *0.28 = 0.28, 0.497 *0.28= 0.13916. So 0.28 + 0.13916 = 0.41916.

So the total density is 0.62424 +0.41916 = 1.0434 g/cm³.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.0434 g/cm³. That's the answer.

To determine the density of the blood mixture, we calculate the weighted average of the densities of xylene and bromobenzene based on their volume percentages in the mixture. The formula for the total density is:

\[
\text{Density} = \left( \text{Volume fraction of xylene} \times \text{Density of xylene} \right) + \left( \text{Volume fraction of bromobenzene} \times \text{Density of bromobenzene} \right)
\]

Substituting the given values:

- Volume fraction of xylene = 0.72, Density of xylene = 0.867 g/cm³
- Volume fraction of bromobenzene = 0.28, Density of bromobenzene = 1.497 g/cm³

First, calculate the contribution of xylene:

\[
0.72 \times 0.867 = 0.62424 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

Next, calculate the contribution of bromobenzene:

\[
0.28 \times 1.497 = 0.41916 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

Add these contributions together to find the total density:

\[
0.62424 + 0.41916 = 1.0434 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

Thus, the density of the blood mixture is **1.0434 g/cm³**, which corresponds to option **F**.
