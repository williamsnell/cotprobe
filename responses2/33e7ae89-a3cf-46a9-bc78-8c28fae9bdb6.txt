Okay, so I've got this question about transduction and galactose metabolism. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about a gal^+ / gal^- cell produced by an abortive transduction. So, transduction is when a cell takes up a foreign DNA molecule, right? And in this case, it's an abortive transduction, which probably means that the cell didn't fully take in the foreign DNA, so the cell isn't fully functional. 

The cell in question is gal^+ / gal^-, which I think refers to the GAL4 and GAL5 systems. GAL4 is the active sigma factor, and GAL5 is the repressor. When GAL4 is active, the cell uses lactose as a carbon source. But wait, the question is about galactose, not lactose. Oh wait, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, no—wait, in the context of transduction, I think the cell is using lactose when the foreign DNA is present. Because the host cell's GAL4 is active when it's taking up lactose. But if the cell is producing a GAL^+ / gal^- cell, perhaps it's using galactose as the carbon source instead. So, the colonies would be using galactose.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the systems. The GAL4 system is for lactose utilization. So, when a transduction occurs, the cell takes up a foreign DNA, which has a promoter that's compatible with the host's GAL4 system. So, the host's GAL4 is active in the presence of lactose, and the host's GAL5 represses the expression of the foreign genes. So, the host cell would produce a gal^+ / gal^- cell, which is the GAL system for the foreign DNA. But wait, the foreign DNA might be a big piece of lactose, then. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the transduction is happening because the cell has taken up a foreign DNA insert. But it's aborted, so it's not fully functional. So the cell might be using the host's own factors. So, the host's GAL4 is active because the foreign DNA has a compatible promoter. So the host's GAL4 is active, which uses lactose. Or wait, maybe the foreign DNA has a different carbon source. Because the question is about using galactose as the carbon source.

Wait, perhaps the host is using galactose as the carbon source. Oh, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In a typical transduction, the cell takes up a foreign DNA that has a promoter compatible with the host's GAL system. So, the host's GAL4 is active, which uses lactose as the carbon source. But if the cell is using galactose instead, perhaps the foreign DNA is providing galactose as the source. Or maybe the host is using galactose, and the foreign DNA is providing the carbon source.

Wait, the question says the cell is gal^+ / gal^- produced by an abortive transduction. It's in a medium where galactose is the sole carbon source. So the problem is, when the cell is in a medium with galactose as the only carbon source, will it grow?

So, we have a cell that's a GAL^+ / gal^- cell. I think in the context of transduction, the cell uses the foreign DNA as a carbon source. So, if the foreign DNA has galactose, then the host's GAL system would use that as the carbon source. Wait, but the cell is using the foreign DNA, which is a piece of lactose, then. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the foreign DNA is a big piece of lactose. So, when the cell takes it up, it's using lactose, and the host's GAL4 is active, which uses lactose as the carbon source. But the question is about using galactose as the carbon source. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the host cell isn't using lactose, but instead galactose. So, perhaps the host is taking up a foreign DNA that has a promoter compatible with the host's GAL system but uses galactose. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the foreign DNA is a piece of galactose. So the host's GAL4 is active, using galactose as the carbon source.

But wait, the cell is gal^+ / gal^- produced by transduction. So, if the foreign DNA has a galactose source, then the host's GAL system would use it. So the cell would be using galactose, and it's in a medium where the only carbon source is galactose. So the cell would be using it and would grow.

But how about the cell's own metabolism? The cell's own GAL system is a GAL^+ / gal^- system. So, if the cell is using galactose as the carbon source, it would have its own GAL system. But if the cell's own GAL is not functional (because it's an abortive transduction), that might affect growth. Wait, transduction creates a new gal system, so maybe the host cell's own GAL system is not working.

Wait, but the question is about the resulting colony's ability to use galactose. So, in the medium, the only carbon is galactose. The cell is expecting galactose to be the carbon source, so if the host can use it, it would grow.

But wait, the cell in question is a GAL^+ / gal^- system. So, if it's using galactose, it's expecting that the host's system can utilize it. So, if the media has only galactose, and the cell is using its own system (the GAL^+ / gal^- system), but the system's own expression depends on the presence of a compatible promoter. But if the host's own GAL system is not functional (because of the transduction), then it can't use it, or it can't express its own genes.

Alternatively, perhaps the host's own GAL system is functional, but the cell is producing a new system (the foreign DNA-derived system) which uses galactose. But the question is about the colony's own ability to utilize galactose.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to break it down.

The cell is a gal^+ / gal^- cell, but it's produced by an abortive transduction. So, in the transduction, the host cell takes up foreign DNA which has a compatible promoter. The host's GAL4 is active in the presence of the foreign DNA, or the foreign DNA has a compatible carbon source.

Wait, I think in this case, the foreign DNA is a big piece of lactose. So, when the host takes it up, the host's GAL4 is active (because lactose is present) and uses lactose as the carbon source. But the question is about using galactose as the carbon source.

Wait, perhaps the foreign DNA is a big piece of galactose. So when the host takes it up, it's using galactose, and the host's GAL system can use it. But then, the question is about the cell's own ability to use galactose. So, the cell is using the foreign DNA as a carbon source. The host's GAL system is using it. But if the host's own GAL system is not working due to transduction, then the cell can't express its own system, but perhaps it's using the foreign DNA's system.

Wait, perhaps the host's GAL system is not working because of the transduction. So, the cell's own GAL system is not functional. So, if the cell is using the foreign DNA as a carbon source, but the host's own system is not working, then perhaps the cell can't utilize the foreign DNA's system.

But the question is about the cell's ability to use galactose. So, perhaps the cell is using the host's own system, but it's not functional. Or, perhaps the cell is using the foreign DNA's system, which uses galactose.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what's happening in the cell's own metabolism. If the cell is using the foreign DNA as a carbon source, and the host's own GAL system is not functional, but the foreign DNA's system is.

But the question is about whether the colony will grow when galactose is the sole carbon source. So, the host's own system is not working; but the foreign DNA's system is using galactose.

But the question is about the cell's ability to use galactose. So, the cell is using the foreign DNA as a carbon source but not using its own system. So, perhaps the cell is not utilizing the foreign DNA's system, but it's using the host's system. But if the host's system is inactive, the cell can't use it.

Wait, perhaps the cell's own GAL system is gal^+ / gal^- and is active when it's using the host's system. But if the host's system is not working, the cell can't use it. So, the cell would not be utilizing the foreign DNA's system, and the media has galactose, but the cell's own system is not functioning.

But wait, the question is about whether the cell would grow in a medium where galactose is the sole carbon source. So, in such a medium, the cell's ability to use galactose would depend on whether its own GAL system is functional.

Alternatively, maybe the cell is using the foreign DNA as a carbon source, but the host's own system is not active. So, the cell can't use the foreign DNA's system, but it's using the host's.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the systems. The host's GAL^+ / gal^- system is the foreign DNA's system, which uses the foreign DNA as a carbon source. If the host's system is not active (because of the transduction), then the cell can't use the foreign DNA's system. But the question is about the cell's own GAL system.

Wait, perhaps the host's GAL system is not working, but the cell is using the foreign DNA as a carbon source, and the host's own system is not functional. So, the cell could be using the foreign DNA as a carbon source, but not using its own system.

But the question is about whether the colony grows in a medium where galactose is the sole carbon source. So, the cell would need to utilize galactose. If the host's own system is not working, but the cell is using the foreign DNA's system, then maybe the cell can't utilize the foreign DNA's system, but the media has galactose.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The cell is using the foreign DNA as a carbon source. The host's GAL system is not functioning (as it's an abortive transduction), so the cell can't use it. But the foreign DNA's system uses galactose. So, the cell can't use the foreign DNA's system because the host's system is not working, but the media has galactose.

Wait, but the media has galactose as the sole carbon source, and the cells are using the foreign DNA. So, the cell would need to use the foreign DNA's system to get galactose. But if the host's system is inactive, the cell can't use it. So, the cell can't utilize the media's galactose.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell's own system is functional, but the media has galactose, so the cell can grow.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what the question is asking. It says, "Will it grow in a medium in which galactose is the sole carbon source?" So, in such a medium, would the colony grow.

If the host's own GAL system is functional (because the transduction wasn't aborted), then the cell would use the media's galactose, grow, and use it. But if the transduction was aborted, then the host's system is not working. So, the cell can't use the media's galactose because it can't express the host's system.

Wait, but what if the cell is using the foreign DNA's system, which uses galactose? Then, the cell's own system (the foreign one) is functioning, and uses galactose, so the cell can grow. But the question is about the cell's ability to use galactose—so the media has galactose, and the cell is using it via its own system.

Wait, but if the cell's system is not functional, then it can't use it. So, if the host's system is not working, the cell can't use the media's galactose. But the media has galactose, so the ability to use it depends on the system's activity.

But the question is about whether the colony grows in the medium. So, if the cell's system is not functional, it can't grow because it can't express its system to use the galactose. Alternatively, if the cell is using the foreign DNA's system, which uses galactose, but the host's system is inactive, the cell can't express the foreign DNA's system, so it can't grow.

Wait, but the cell is a GAL^+ / gal^- system. So, if it's using the foreign DNA, which is a piece of galactose, then the cell's own GAL system must be functional. Because for the foreign DNA to be expressed, the host's system must be active.

Wait, perhaps the host's system is not active because of the transduction. So, the cell's own system (the foreign DNA-derived system) can't be expressed, so the cell can't use the foreign DNA's system. So, the cell can't use galactose because it can't express the system that uses it.

In that case, the media has galactose, but the cell can't use it because it's not functioning. So, the cell wouldn't grow.

But wait, the media has galactose as the only carbon source. So, if the cell is using the foreign DNA's system, and the host's system isn't active, then the cell can't use the media's galactose.

Alternatively, perhaps the host's system is working, but the cell has a different GAL system. Wait, no, the cell is a gal^+ / gal^- system. 

Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the process again. When a transduction occurs, the cell takes up a foreign DNA that matches the host's GAL system. So, the host's GAL4 is active when the foreign DNA is present. So, the host's system (the foreign DNA's) would use the foreign DNA as a carbon source.

But in our case, the media has galactose. So, the host's system would use the foreign DNA, which isn't galactose. Wait, that can't be right. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the foreign DNA and the carbon source.

Wait, maybe the foreign DNA is a big piece of lactose. So, when the cell takes it up, it uses lactose as the carbon source. But the question is about using galactose. Hmm, perhaps the media has galactose, but the host's system is not functioning. So, the cell can't use the media's galactose because the system is not active.

But wait, the cell is a GAL^+ / gal^- system, which would require the host's system to be active. So, if the host's system isn't active, the cell can't use the media's galactose.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell's own system is gal^+ / gal^-, and it's using the foreign DNA as a carbon source, so it would use the foreign DNA's system, which uses the foreign DNA as the carbon source. But the host's system isn't working, so the cell can't use the media's galactose.

Wait, but the media has galactose. So, the cell could be using the host's system (if active) to use galactose, but if the system is inactive, it can't.

Alternatively, if the cell is using the foreign DNA's system, which uses galactose, but the host's system is not working, the cell can't express the foreign DNA's system because it depends on the host's system's activity.

So, the cell would not be able to use the media's galactose.

Wait, but that depends on whether the media's carbon source (galactose) is compatible with the host's system.

Alternatively, perhaps the host's system is not functional because of the transduction, so it can't process the media's carbon source.

But the media has galactose as the only carbon source. So, if the cell's system is working, it can use it. But if the system is not working, it can't.

Wait, the question is about whether the colony will grow. So, if the cell's system is not working, it can't grow.

But wait, the media has galactose, but the cell's system isn't active, so it can't use it. So, the cell can't grow.

Looking at the options, option E says: "The colony grows to an unusually large size before ceasing growth." That would happen if the media's carbon source is sufficient, but the system isn't working, so it stops growing.

Alternatively, if the cell's system is working, it would grow, else not.

Wait, but the media has galactose. If the cell's system is working, it can grow and use it. If not, it can't.

Wait, but the question is whether the cell would grow in the media. So, if the cell's system is not working, they can't grow. If it's working, they can.

But the media's carbon source is galactose, but only if the cell's system can process it.

Wait, another possibility: the host's system is gal^+ / gal^-, which requires lactose. So, if the media has galactose, the host's system would use it, and the cell would grow. But if the transduction is aborted, the host's system isn't functioning, so the cell can't use galactose, so it doesn't grow.

So, the media has galactose. If the host's system is working, the cell would grow and use the galactose. But since the transduction is aborted, the host's system isn't working, so the cell can't use the media's galactose.

So, in this case, the cell wouldn't grow because the media's carbon source isn't being processed by its system.

Looking back at the options, option B is "The resulting colony is minute." That would happen if the system isn't functioning, and the cell can't grow. But if the system is functioning, the cell would grow.

Wait, but if the media has galactose and the cell's system is functioning, then the cell would grow and use the media's carbon source.

But wait, the media has galactose as the only carbon source. So, if the cell's system (the foreign DNA's) is functioning, it would use the media's galactose. If the system is not functioning, it can't.

So, if the transduction is successful, the cell's system is functioning, and it can use the media's galactose, leading to growth.

But the question is about the cell's ability to use the media's carbon source. So, if the media has galactose and the cell's system is functional, it can grow. If not, it can't.

But what determines the system's functionality?

The host's system (the foreign DNA's) must be functional. If the transduction is successful, then the host's system is active. So, the cell's system would be active, using the foreign DNA as the carbon source. If the media has galactose, but the host's system isn't active, the cell can't use the media's galactose.

Wait, but the media has galactose, which is the carbon source. So, if the cell's system is active, it can use the media's galactose. But if the system isn't active, it can't.

So, the question is, in the media where galactose is the only carbon source, will the cell grow?

If the cell's system is active, yes, it will. If not, no, it won't.

But whether the system is active depends on the transduction's success.

Wait, the question says that this cell is produced by an abortive transduction. So, the transduction is unsuccessful. So, the host's system is not working, meaning the cell's system (the foreign DNA's) isn't functioning either.

So, in the media where galactose is the only carbon source, the cell's system isn't functioning. Therefore, the cell can't use the media's galactose.

So, the cell can't grow.

Looking at the options, option E says: "The colony grows to an unusually large size before ceasing growth." That would happen if the media has enough carbon and the system is working, but the system isn't working, so it ceases growing.

Alternatively, option E is about the cell not growing because the system isn't active.

So, the correct answer is option E.
</think>

The question examines whether a cell produced by an abortive transduction will grow in a medium with galactose as the sole carbon source. To answer this, we analyze the role of the host's GAL system and the system's dependency on the host's function.

1. **Transduction and System Function**:  
   - Transduction involves the cell taking up foreign DNA, which must be compatible with the host's GAL system.  
   - If the transduction is successful, the host's GAL system becomes functional. However, if the transduction is aborted, the host's GAL system remains inactive, and the cell's system (the foreign DNA-derived system) cannot express its own GAL genes.

2. ** media and Carbon Source**:  
   - The media contains galactose as the sole carbon source. For the cell to grow, it must express its own GAL genes to utilize the carbon source.
   - Since the transduction is abortive, the host's GAL system is inactive, and the cell's system (the foreign DNA-derived system) also cannot express its own GAL genes. This means the cell cannot utilize the media's galactose.

3. **Outcome**:  
   - As the cell's system is inactive, it cannot grow in the media containing galactose. Therefore, the colony will not grow.

4. **Answer Selection**:  
   - Among the options provided, **E** ("The colony grows to an unusually large size before ceasing growth") does not apply. Instead, the correct answer is that the colony does not grow because the system is inactive.
