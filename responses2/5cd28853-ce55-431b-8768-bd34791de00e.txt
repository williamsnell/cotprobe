Okay, I have to answer this question. Let's see, the question is about two statements about image databases and their sizes. Statement 1 says that ImageNet has images of various resolutions. Statement 2 says Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet. I need to figure out if each statement is true or false and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I'll break down each statement.

Statement 1: ImageNet has images of various resolutions. I remember that ImageNet is a large database of visual objects used in machine learning research. I think it's often used as a benchmark for image classification tasks. Oh wait, no, I think ImageNet doesn't have images of various resolutions. Instead, it's typically divided into different subsets like ImageNet-v2, which has images of various sizes. Or maybe the original ImageNet has images of a specific resolution. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, I'm pretty sure that ImageNet itself is a collection of images, but not necessarily all of different resolutions. Maybe the question is referring to the fact that different subsets of ImageNet have varying resolutions. For example, the original ImageNet might have images of a standard resolution, but perhaps there are subsets like ImageNet 64x64, 128x128, etc., which are of various sizes. So Statement 1 is saying ImageNet has images of various resolutions, which might be true because there are different subsets with different resolutions. So I'll tentatively say Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet. I'm not as sure on this one. I know that Caltech-101 is a larger database than ImageNet. Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, I think. And I believe ImageNet has around 14 million images, but it's split into different subsets. Wait, no, wait. Actually, ImageNet is a subset of Caltech-101. Or is it the other way around? Let me clarify. Caltech-101 is a larger database that includes ImageNet as one of its subsets. So if Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet, that would mean Caltech-101 has more than ImageNet's 14 million images. But wait, I think ImageNet is a subset of Caltech-101, but the exact numbers might differ. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me try to recall: Caltech-101 is 10,000 images, I think. Wait, no, Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, but the total for all subsets might be much larger. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. I think Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, but the total number of images in the largest subset (like Caltech-101) is 10,000. And ImageNet is a subset of Caltech-101, so maybe Caltech-101 has more images than the sum of all ImageNet subsets. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet as a whole. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to find some authoritative information.

Wait, I recall that Caltech-101 contains more images than the original ImageNet. I think the original ImageNet had about 14 million images, split into 1000 subsets. Caltech-101, on the other hand, has 10,000 images. Or wait, Caltech-101 is 10,000 images, but I think the total number of images in all subsets of Caltech-101 is much larger. Or perhaps the total number of images in Caltech-101 is larger than that of ImageNet. So if the question is whether Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet as a whole, that would be true. Because if Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, and ImageNet has 14 million, then Caltech-101 has fewer. But wait, that can't be right because I think Caltech-101 is a larger database. Alternatively, maybe the total number of images in Caltech-101 is larger than in ImageNet. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it another way.

Wait, I think Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, but ImageNet has 14 million, so Caltech-101 has fewer. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the total number of images in Caltech-101 is much larger than ImageNet. Wait, I'm not confident about this part. Maybe I should think about the exact numbers. Let me recall: Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, but the total number of images in all subsets (including ImageNet) is much larger. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me try to find some references.

Wait, I found that Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, and the original ImageNet has 14 million images. So in that case, ImageNet has more images. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the total number of images in Caltech-101 is 10,000, but the total from all subsets is more than 14 million, making Caltech-101 have more. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Caltech-101 is the one with more images. Wait, perhaps I should think of it another way. The question says, "Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet." If ImageNet has 14 million, and Caltech-101 has 10,000, then Caltech-101 has fewer. So that statement would be false. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: ImageNet is a subset of Caltech-101, but the total number of images in Caltech-101 is larger than in ImageNet. So if ImageNet has 14 million, Caltech-101 has 10,000. So that would make Caltech-101 have fewer. So Statement 2 would be false. But that contradicts what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps Caltech-101 has 100,000 images, and ImageNet has 14 million. Then Caltech-101 would have fewer, making Statement 2 false.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just proceed with what I think is correct. Let's assume that Statement 1 is True because ImageNet has various resolutions. Statement 2: Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet. If I think that Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, and ImageNet has 14 million, then Caltech-101 has fewer. So Statement 2 would be False. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the numbers. Let me try to think if there are any sources that say Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that Caltech-101 contains more images than the entire ImageNet database. Since ImageNet is a subset of Caltech-101, but perhaps in terms of the total number of images, Caltech-101 has more. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if it's a subset, it should have fewer. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using 'has more' in a different way, like including all subsets or something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to make a decision based on what I know. I think Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet. No, wait, actually, I think ImageNet has more images. Because if you look at the numbers: Caltech-101 has 10,000 images, but the total across all ImageNet subsets is around 14 million. So ImageNet has more, making Statement 2 false.

So summarizing:

Statement 1: True (ImageNet has various resolutions).

Statement 2: False (Caltech-101 has fewer images than ImageNet).

So the options are:

A: False, False → both false.

B: True, False → statement 1 true, 2 false.

C: True, True → both true.

D: False, True → no, both are false.

So the correct answer is B: True, False.

Wait, let me double-check. Statement 1 is correct because ImageNet has various resolutions. Statement 2 is incorrect because Caltech-101 doesn't have more than ImageNet; ImageNet has more.
</think>

The correct answer is B: True, False.

**Explanation:**

- **Statement 1**: True. ImageNet has images of various resolutions, as it includes subsets with different image sizes.
- **Statement 2**: False. Caltech-101 has fewer images than ImageNet, as it is a subset of ImageNet which contains around 14 million images, while Caltech-101 has 10,000 images.

Thus, the correct option is B.
