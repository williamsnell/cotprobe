Okay, so I've got this quadratic equation to solve: 6x² -7x -20 = 0. Hmm, I remember there's something called the quadratic formula that can help me here. Let me try to recall how that works. The formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over 2a. Right, so a is the coefficient of x squared, which is 6 in this case. B is the coefficient of x, which is -7, and c is the constant term, which is -20.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I'm getting the signs right. So, the equation is 6x² -7x -20. So, a=6, b=-7, c=-20. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard form is ax² + bx + c. So, in this case, the equation is 6x² minus 7x minus 20. So, 6x² is like a=6, b is the coefficient of x, which is -7, because it's minus 7x. And c is -20.

So, applying the formula, x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a). Let's plug in the values.

So, let's compute each part step by step. First, calculate -b. Since b is -7, -b would be -(-7) which is 7. So, the numerator starts with 7.

Now, the discriminant part is b squared minus 4ac. So, b squared is (-7)^2, which is 49. Then, 4ac is 4 times 6 times (-20). Let's compute that. 4 *6 is 24, times (-20) is -480. So, the discriminant is 49 - (-480), which is 49 + 480, which equals 529. Oh, that's a perfect square, right? Because 23 squared is 529. So, sqrt(529) is 23.

So, putting it all together, x = [7 ± 23]/(2*6). Let's compute the denominator first: 2*6 is 12. So, the denominator is 12.

So, now, the two possible solutions are:

1. (7 + 23)/12 = 30/12. Let's simplify that. Both are divisible by 6. 30 divided by 6 is 5, 12 divided by 6 is 2. So, 5/2.

2. (7 - 23)/12 = (-16)/12. Simplify that. Both are divisible by 4. -16/4 is -4, 12/4 is 3. So, -4/3.

So, the solutions are 5/2 and -4/3. Now I need to check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option H is 5/2, -4/3. So, that's matching what I got. Let me double-check the options given.

Wait, the options are:

A: 5/2, 4/3

B: -5/3, 4/2

C:5/3, -4/2

D:2, -10

E:4, -5

F:-5/2, 4/3

G:-5/6, 4/5

H:5/2, -4/3

I:5,4

J:5,-4

So, option H matches exactly. So the correct answer is H.

The quadratic equation 6x² -7x -20 = 0 is solved using the quadratic formula. Here, a = 6, b = -7, c = -20. Plugging into the formula, x = [7 ± sqrt(529)] / 12, which simplifies to 5/2 and -4/3. The correct option is H.

Answer: H
