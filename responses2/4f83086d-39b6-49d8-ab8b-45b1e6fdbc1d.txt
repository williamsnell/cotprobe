Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the H+ concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution. The question gives the Ka value as 1 × 10^-10. Hmm, I remember that phenol is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. 

Wait, the formula for a weak acid is usually HA dissociating into H+ and A-. The general equation is HA ⇌ H+ + A-. The Ka expression is [H+][A-]/[HA]. Since it's a weak acid, [H+] is small compared to the initial concentration, so I think the approximation where [HA] ≈ C - [H+] isn't valid here because Ka is very small. Oh wait no, wait. The problem is that at 1 M concentration, the Ka is 1e-10, which is pretty small, but maybe the approximation won't hold. Or maybe it does, because sometimes when the initial concentration is high, the approximation is good. Let me think.

So, for a weak acid, if the concentration is C, and Ka is much smaller than 1, the degree of dissociation α is small. The formula for α is sqrt(Ka / C). Let me compute that. Here, C is 1.0 M, Ka is 1e-10. So sqrt(1e-10 / 1) = sqrt(1e-10) = 1e-5. So α is 1e-5. 

Wait, so that means about 0.01% dissociation. So the concentration of H+ should be around α * C. Because if HA dissociates into H+ and A-, then [H+] is approximately α*C. So that would be 1e-5 * 1.0 M = 1e-5 M. So the H+ concentration is 1e-5 M. Looking at the options, option E is 1e-5 M. So the answer should be E.

But wait, wait a second. Another approach: the exact expression. The initial concentration is 1.0 M. Let's model the dissociation.

Let the initial concentration of HA be 1.0 M. Let x be the amount that dissociates. So, [H+] = x, [A-] = x, [HA] = 1 - x.

Ka = (x^2) / (1 - x) = 1e-10.

Since x is small (1e-5), 1-x ≈ 1. So x^2 ≈ 1e-10 → x ≈ 1e-5. So yes, same result. So H+ is 1e-5.

So the correct answer should be option E. I should check the options again. The options are given from A to J. E is 1e-5. So the answer is E.

To determine the H⁺ concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution, we use the dissociation equilibrium of a weak acid:

\[
\text{HA} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}
\]

For a weak acid, the degree of dissociation (\(\alpha\)) is given by:

\[
\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{K_a}{C}}
\]

Here, \(C = 1.0 \, \text{M}\) and \(K_a = 1 \times 10^{-10}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{1 \times 10^{-10}}{1.0}} = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-10}} = 1 \times 10^{-5}
\]

The concentration of \(\text{H}^+\) is approximately:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = \alpha \cdot C = (1 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 1.0 = 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the H⁺ concentration in the solution is \(1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option E.
