Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Baxter's view on environmental problems. Hmm, I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is asking what Baxter thinks is the first and foremost step toward solving environmental problems. The options are A through J. The options all seem to be about environmental issues, but I need to think about what Baxter would consider as the primary action.

First, Baxter is a climate scientist, I think, because the question mentions his view. His theories often focus on balancing ecosystems and preventing pollution. So, I should look for the option that reflects his stance.

The question says Baxter's view on the first step. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: "the introduction of new species to balance the ecosystem." That sounds like a positive action, introducing new life to fix issues. Maybe, but Baxter might be focusing on the solution rather than introducing new species, especially if that's not practical or the best approach.

Option B: "maintaining current levels of pollution." Well, that doesn't sound like a major step. Maintaining pollution levels might be more of a control measure rather than the first step towards a solution.

Option C: "an overall maximally clean environment." Maximally clean could be a broad term, but I'm not sure if that's what Baxter would prioritize. He might be more concerned about specific actions to fix issues rather than just having the best possible environment.

Option D: "the total elimination of harmful species." That seems like a strong statement. If all harmful species are eliminated, that would be a comprehensive approach. But I'm not sure if that's what Baxter would focus on as the first step. Maybe he would think about specific actions rather than eliminating everything.

Option E: "some maximal state of pollution." Maximal pollution doesn't seem right. It's probably a misstatement, and it doesn't convey a clear action.

Option F: "the eradication of all pollution." Eradicating all pollution sounds like a drastic and possibly impractical step. It's more of a long-term goal.

Option G: "an environment free from human interference." That sounds a bit vague. Humans have various issues, so being free from interference might not be the first priority.

Option H: "a state of pollution that supports human health and well-being." This is about managing pollution to be beneficial for humans. Maybe that's a middle ground but not the first step.

Option I: "some optimal state of pollution." Optimal might imply a balance, which could be a step towards a solution.

Option J: "the preservation of all living species." That's a strong statement, focusing on the balance of ecosystems. This seems like a central theme in environmental management.

So, considering Baxter's work, he's likely concerned with solutions that balance ecosystems and prevent pollution. Option J suggests preserving all living species, which is a key principle in environmental conservation. Therefore, J seems like the correct answer.

The correct answer is J: the preservation of all living species. Baxter's view likely emphasizes balancing ecosystems and preventing pollution, with the preservation of all living species being a central principle in his approach to environmental solutions.

Answer: J
