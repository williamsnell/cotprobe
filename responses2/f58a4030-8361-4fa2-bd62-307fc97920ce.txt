Okay, so I've got this biology question about proving that a new species of bioluminescent worm is actually itself and not some contaminating bacteria. Hmm, I need to figure this out. 

First, what's bioluminescence? Oh right, it's the process where an organism emits light. So the worm is giving off light, probably using a chemical substance as a source of light. Now, the question is about showing that this light isn't from some other bacteria. 

The options are A through E. Let's think about each one. 

Option A: Place the worm in a dark environment. Well, if the worm emits light, maybe it's because it uses a chemical source. If it's in a dark place, the light from the source would escape, so the worm would emit more light. But wait, I'm not sure if that's enough to prove it's the worm. Maybe it's a start, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Measure the light intensity over time. Oh, that sounds promising. By measuring how light the worm emits over time, we can determine if it's consistent with its own production. If it's from bacteria, then the emission would vary and maybe be less consistent. But wait, how would we measure that accurately? Also, would it be feasible without knowing the source?

Option C: Feed the worm with different food. Hmm, not directly related. Unless the source of light is due to the food, but the question is about whether it's the worm, not some other source. So maybe not this one.

Option D: Place the light-producing substance in growth media. Oh wait, the worm produces the light through a certain chemical. If we put that chemical in growth media, maybe it grows normally. But the problem is, the question is about showing it's the worm, not some other source. Unless the other option (B) is more direct.

Option E: Perform a chemical analysis. That could show the source, but maybe not directly. If the source is a bacterial extract, the chemical analysis might show it's a specific type of bacteria.

Wait, the question is about the worm itself. So, perhaps looking for an environmental change. If the worm is the source, then putting it in a dark environment might let it emit more light. But if it's contaminated, maybe the light emission would be different. But how do we know it's the worm or a different source?

Wait, if the worm emits light because it uses a certain chemical, and that chemical is present in the environment, then any presence of that chemical would indicate it's the worm. But how do you confirm that it's the same chemical? Maybe through some kind of trace analysis.

Alternatively, if you can't trace the source, you might look for other signs. Like, if the worm's light is too strong, maybe because it's producing more of the chemical. But that's not conclusive.

Another thought: If you feed the worm with different foods, maybe other organisms have different light sources. But again, that's about the source, not whether it's the worm.

Wait, another approach: if the worm is the source, then the light it emits could be detected by its own characteristics. But that's more about the worm's own light rather than the environment.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to test for the source of light. If the source is from bacteria, perhaps the amount or intensity of the emitted light would vary. So, putting the worm in a dark environment might not help because the light from the source would escape. Unless the source is different.

Wait, no. The source is the chemical that emits light. So, if the source is the same for both the worm and the bacteria, then the light would be the same. But if the source is from bacteria, then the bacteria's chemical would produce light, which the worm doesn't. So, perhaps if the worm is the only source, its light would be more consistent and stronger.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe a better method is to isolate the source of light. Like, if you take the worm and put it into a growth medium with some other organisms, and see if it can grow on its own. If it can't, maybe it's the only one capable of producing that light.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Option B says to measure the light intensity over time. That would involve tracking the light output as it changes. If the source is from bacteria, perhaps the light intensity would vary more or be weaker, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the source is something the worm produces, then it would be consistent.

Option D is about feeding the substance into growth media. If the substance is the source, then the bacteria would grow, while the worm would not. But that's more about testing the source, not about proving it's the worm itself.

Wait, another thought: The question is about proving the worm is the source. So, perhaps the best way is to see if the worm emits light when placed in a dark environment. If it can't, then the light must come from somewhere else. But if it can, perhaps that's a clue.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option again.

The correct method to prove that the species is the worm and not another source would be to demonstrate that its light emission is consistent only with itself. So, perhaps measuring light emission over time (option B) would show it's the same as the source.

Alternatively, using a method like exposing to high temperatures (option E) would test for other factors, but not the source itself.

Wait, another approach: If the source of light is a bacterial extract, then any presence of that extract would indicate the source. So, if you separate the bacterial material from the worm and test it, you could identify the source.

But looking at the options, option D doesn't do this. It's about putting the source into growth media. So if the source is the bacteria, the worm would not be able to grow on it.

Wait, but I think the best option is B: measure light over time. Because if the source is the same, the light would be consistent. But if the source is from bacteria, the light would vary more, perhaps. Or if the source is present, the light would be higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it this way: if the source of light is from bacteria, then the emission would vary in a way that the worm doesn't produce. So, if you measure how much light the worm emits over time, it would be more consistent (if the source is the same) or vary more (if it's from bacteria).

But without knowing the source, you can't tell. However, each option is a possible method.

Option D: Putting the source into growth media would allow the bacteria to grow, but the worm wouldn't. So, if the source is present, the bacteria would grow, but the worm wouldn't. So, you can distinguish the source from the bacteria in this way.

But the question is about proving the worm is the source. So, if you can show that the source is the same, then the worm is the source.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, as it would directly show whether the source is the same as the worm.

So, the correct approach would be to measure the light intensity emitted by the worm over time. If the source is the same, the intensity would be consistent. If it's from bacteria, the intensity would vary, perhaps.

Wait, but the question is about proving the worm is the source. So if you can show that the light the worm emits is more consistent than that from other sources, then it's the worm.

Alternatively, the source method (option D) would show whether the source is the same as the worm. If the source is the same, the bacteria won't grow, but the worm will. So, option D would show that the source is indeed the same as the worm.

But the question isn't about testing the source but about proving the worm is the source.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: if the worm emits light because it's using a certain chemical, any presence of that chemical in the environment would indicate it's the source. So, if you take the worm and put it in a growth medium without any other organisms, and let it grow. If it can't, maybe it's the only one capable of producing that light.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the best options are B and D. 

The question is, which option would you choose to prove it's the worm.

I think the best way is to measure the light over time. Because if the source is from bacteria, the light would vary more, so if it's the same, it would be a consistent signal.

Alternatively, option D would help in identifying the source, but you need to know that the source is the same as the worm.

Wait, but the question is about proving the worm is the source. So, perhaps the best approach is to see if the light is consistent with the worm's own production.

So, if you put the worm in a dark environment and it emits light, but if it's contaminated, maybe the light isn't as strong or varied. Alternatively, if the light is consistent, that suggests it's the worm.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if you take the worm and feed it with a known bacterial extract, you can see if it can grow on that. If it can, then the source is bacteria, so the worm isn't the source. But that's about identifying the source, not proving the worm is the source.

So, I think the correct answer is B: measure the light intensity over time.

To determine whether a newly discovered bioluminescent worm is the species itself and not a contaminating bacteria, it is essential to use a method that directly demonstrates the source of the light emitted by the worm. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A: Place the worm in a dark environment**  
  While placing the worm in a dark environment could allow it to emit light from its chemical source, this approach does not conclusively prove the worm is the source. The light emitted could be consistent with the worm's production, but it would also depend on the source's characteristics.

- **Option B: Measure the light intensity emitted by the worm over time**  
  This method directly tests whether the worm's light emission is consistent and consistent with its own production. If the worm is the source, its light intensity over time would likely be more consistent and stronger than that of a contaminating bacteria. This approach provides a clear and reliable way to distinguish the worm's light from other sources.

- **Option C: Feed the worm with different food sources**  
  This option is not directly related to identifying the source of light. It would more likely indicate the presence of different bacterial strains but does not address whether the worm is the source itself.

- **Option D: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or physically examine it under a microscope**  
  This would test whether the worm can grow in the presence of the source, which could help identify the source. However, it does not directly prove that the worm is the source.

- **Option E: Perform a chemical analysis of the light-producing substance**  
  This method could identify the source of light, but it does not specifically prove whether the worm is the source.

The most effective method to prove that the worm is the species itself is **Option B**, as it directly tests the consistency and intensity of the worm's light emission over time, making it the most reliable choice for identifying the source.

**ANSWER: B**
