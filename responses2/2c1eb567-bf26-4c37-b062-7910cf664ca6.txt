Okay, so I've got this question about group theory, and I need to figure out the identity element in a specific group. The group G is given as {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10. The options are letters from A to J, each representing a different number. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that in a group, the identity element is the one that, when you perform the group operation with any element of the group, you get that element itself. So, for every element a in G, a * e (mod 10) should equal a. Or wait, no, I think it's a * e = e * a = a. But in this case, since the group operation is multiplication modulo 10, e must be the element such that multiplying any element by e gives that element. So, e must be 1, because 1 is the multiplicative identity. But wait, in the group G, all elements are 2,4,6,8. None of these are 1. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong group. The group G is {2,4,6,8} under multiplication modulo 10. Let me check what happens when I multiply each element by another element in G and then mod 10. Maybe I can find the identity element by seeing which element, when multiplied by any other element, gives that element back.

Let's see:

Take element 2. Let's compute 2 * 2 mod10: 4. 2 *4 mod10: 8. 2*6=12 mod10=2. 2*8=16 mod10=6. So, 2*2=4, which is in the group. But that's not the identity because 2*2â‰ 2. So 2 isn't the identity.

Next, try element 4: 4*4=16 mod10=6. Not 4. So 4 can't be identity either.

How about 6: 6*6=36 mod10=6. Wait, so 6*6=6. That suggests 6 might be the identity. But let me check if this holds for all elements.

Let me compute 6 *2 mod10. 12 mod10=2. 6*4=24 mod10=4. 6*6=36 mod10=6. 6*8=48 mod10=8. So, 6 seems to act as the identity because multiplying any element by 6 gives back itself. That's correct.

Wait a second, but I thought the identity element is 1, but in this group, none of the elements are 1. So maybe I made a mistake earlier thinking about 1 as the identity. Oh wait, no, in the group G, the operation is multiplication modulo 10. So, 1 isn't in the group, so it can't be the identity. Therefore, the identity element in G is 6.

Looking back at the options, let's check the choices. The options are A:9, B:7, C:8, D:1, E:4, F:3, G:2, H:10, I:6, J:5.

So, option I is 6. That must be the correct answer.

The identity element in the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10 is the element that, when multiplied by any other element in the group, yields that element itself. By checking each element, we find that 6 satisfies this condition because multiplying 6 by any element in G results in the same element. Therefore, the identity element is 6.
