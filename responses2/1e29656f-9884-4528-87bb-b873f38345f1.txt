Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
C: admissible as non-hearsay.
D: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
E: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
F: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
G: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
H: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
I: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this pedestrian's statement is inadmissible or not. Let's go through the facts.

The man and woman were involved in a car accident where the man abruptly switched lanes without signaling. The woman then hit the man's car into the median. After the accident, the drivers emerged, and a pedestrian, who's obviously emotional and upset from observing the accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?"

The question is about whether this statement is admissible. The options are A through I. I remember there are several hearsay exceptions, like the present sense impression, spontaneous statement, and excited utterance.

Wait, the statement is from a pedestrian, so it's not the defendant's voice or anything like that. It's a statement made by someone else. But since it's a statement made by a third party, is it hearsay? Well, the defendant's own statements are not hearsay, but a statement by someone else is hearsay unless it's admissible as non-hearsay.

So, the key issue here is whether this statement is admissible. The statement is emotional and upset because they saw an accident. But does that make it admissible?

I think the present sense impression exception allows a statement made under the influence of music, speech, or other stimuli. If the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, maybe that's a trigger. Alternatively, if the pedestrian was near the scene and heard the accident's sound, that could be a present sense impression.

Alternatively, the spontaneous statement exception allows a person to speak directly to the defendant. But in this case, the pedestrian is not present at trial, so they can't speak directly. But they made a statement while present. Wait, but the pedestrian is not identified, so they can't testify as a witness. So the statement is from a third party, so it's hearsay unless it's admissible.

Wait, but the pedestrian is not present at trial, so they can't testify. So the statement is not admissible as a hearsay unless it's admissible for other reasons.

Alternatively, the excited utterance exception is for statements made under stress or excitement. If the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident, perhaps they were in a hurry or excited, making their statement an excited utterance. Alternatively, if the pedestrian was near the scene and the accident happened, they were in a position of stress.

Hmm. Or maybe the excited utterance exception allows a person making a statement under intense stress. But in this case, the pedestrian's statement is emotional and upset. So if the pedestrian was in a position of stress, then yes, it would be admissible under excited utterance.

Wait, but the excited utterance exception requires that the statement is made under stress or excitement. So if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident, perhaps that's a trigger. Or if they were outside and heard the accident's sound, they might have been under stress.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is not admissible because it's a statement made by someone who wasn't present, but that doesn't help much.

Wait, the options are:

A: Admissible only if the bystander wasn't involved. But the bystander was in the accident. So A is incorrect because the bystander was involved.

B: Admissible under excited utterance.

C: Admissible as non-hearsay. Well, is it hearsay? Unless it's non-hearsay, which would require it being a fact rather than an opinion or statement. So this is a statement, so it's hearsay unless it's admissible as non-hearsay. So C is not correct unless it's non-hearsay. But the pedestrian's statement is emotional and not factual, so it's hearsay. So C is out.

D: Admissible even though it's hearsay. That would be the case if it's admissible under a hearsay exception.

E: Admissible under the present sense impression exception. That would require a stimulus like music, speech, or a sound that made the person excited.

I: Admissible under spontaneous statement.

Wait, spontaneous statement allows a person to speak directly to the defendant. But in this case, the pedestrian is not present at trial, so they can't speak. So spontaneous statement isn't applicable. Unless the statement was made while the pedestrian was present.

Wait, the statement is made while the pedestrian was present (after the accident). So maybe the pedestrian could have spoken, but since they are not identified and not present at trial, they can't testify. So the statement is a hearsay from a third party, unless it's admissible as non-hearsay or through an exception.

Alternatively, if the pedestrian was in a position of stress, their statement would be admissible under excited utterance.

So, the key is whether the statement is admissible as a fact. If the statement is made under stress or excitement, then it's excited utterance. The excited utterance exception requires that the utterance was made under stress. So, if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident, perhaps that's a trigger. Alternatively, if the pedestrian was in a position of stress, like being in a hurry, then their statement would qualify.

Wait, the statement is emotional and upset. So if the pedestrian was in a position of stress, then yes. If they were just talking in a moment of calm, maybe not. But if they were in a car and heard the accident, perhaps that's a trigger for stress. 

Alternatively, perhaps the statement was made under stress, so excited utterance applies.

So, the statement is a statement made under stress or excitement. Therefore, it's admissible under excited utterance. So option B would be correct.

Alternatively, the statement is admissible under the present sense impression exception if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, which would trigger the excited utterance.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is made after the accident, so maybe he was in the car and heard the accident's sound, which would be a present sense impression. But I'm not sure if the sound is a sensory trigger. Alternatively, if he was in a hurry, he might have been under stress.

Alternatively, the excited utterance exception would apply if the statement was made under intense stress. So if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident, perhaps that's a situation of stress. So B would be correct.

Another thought: the pedestrian's statement is an emotional statement. If they were in a position of stress, then excited utterance applies. But if they were just speaking in a calm moment, then it's not admissible. So the question is, was the pedestrian in a position of stress.

The question says the pedestrian ran up to the man. It's unclear if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound. But perhaps the pedestrian was in a car, and the accident happened because of the car's movement, making them in a position of stress.

So, perhaps the statement was made under stress (excited utterance), making option B correct.

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible only if the bystander wasn't involved. No, because bystander was involved.

B: Admissible under excited utterance. Possibly.

C: Admissible as non-hearsay. No, because it's a statement.

D: Admissible even if hearsay. But since it's a statement, it's hearsay. So D is incorrect.

E: Admissible under present sense impression. If the pedestrian heard the accident's sound, that's a present sense impression.

Wait, the pedestrian was a bystander, so in a car, and the accident was in the car. So perhaps the pedestrian was in a car, and the car's movement made him feel excited. So that's a present sense impression.

So option E is correct as well.

Wait, but is a pedestrian's statement under stress considered a present sense impression? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Ah, wait, the present sense impression exception applies when the statement is made under the influence of a sound or a stimulus, such as music, speech, or a natural sound. If the pedestrian was near the scene and heard the accident's sound, that might be a present sense impression. But in this case, the pedestrian ran up to the man after the accident, so perhaps the pedestrian was in the car and heard the accident's sound, making them under the influence of that sound (present sense impression).

Alternatively, if the pedestrian was outside and heard the accident, maybe they were in a car and then the accident happened nearby, so that would be a present sense impression.

So both B and E could apply. But I'm not sure which is correct.

Wait, another angle: the pedestrian's statement is emotional and upset. If the statement is emotional, is it admissible? The answer is yes, but only if it's a fact or hearsay. However, the statement is not a fact, so it's hearsay.

So, the only way to make it admissible is through an exception. Either excited utterance, present sense impression, spontaneous statement, or non-hearsay.

Option B: excited utterance. Option E: present sense impression.

Which is more applicable here?

Well, the pedestrian was in a car and ran up after the accident. So if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, that would be a present sense impression.

Alternatively, if the pedestrian was outside and heard the accident, maybe he was in a car, but that's not specified.

So the safest way is to consider the most likely scenario. Given that the pedestrian ran up after the accident, it's possible they were in the car and heard the accident's sound, making it a present sense impression.

So, looking at the options, E would be correct.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement was made while they were in the car. So, is the statement made under the influence of the accident's sound? Or was the pedestrian in the car, and the accident happened nearby, making the sound a trigger for their excitement.

In that case, option E is correct. Or option B.

Wait, another thought: the pedestrian's statement was made while they were in the car. If the accident happened in the car, perhaps the pedestrian was in a position of stress or excitement. So, the statement would be under stress, making it excited utterance.

So which is right: excited utterance or present sense impression.

Wait, present sense impression requires a sensory trigger. If the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, that's a present sense impression. But if the pedestrian was outside and heard the accident's sound, that's a present sense impression. But if the pedestrian was in the car and the accident happened nearby, that's a present sense impression.

Alternatively, if the pedestrian was in the car and heard the accident's sound, that's a present sense impression. Or if they were in a car and the accident was happening, causing them to feel excited.

So, in either case, the statement would be admissible under either excited utterance (if stress) or present sense impression (if the sound was a trigger).

But the options don't combine them. So perhaps the answer is that the statement is admissible under excited utterance (option B) or present sense impression (option E).

Wait, but the pedestrian was not present at the time of the statement. So they couldn't speak, but their statement is about what they felt. So the statement is from a third party, so it's hearsay unless admissible.

Wait, but the statement is emotional, so it's not a fact. So it's hearsay. So, the only way to make it admissible is through an exception.

So, if the statement is made under stress (excited utterance), then option B is correct. If it's made under the influence of a sound (present sense impression), option E is correct.

But which applies here?

The pedestrian was a bystander, so while the accident happened, the pedestrian was in a car. If the accident was happening nearby, the pedestrian might have felt the car's movement (like a car moving onto the road) as a stressor, making their statement an excited utterance.

So, B is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B: admissible under excited utterance.

Option E: admissible under present sense impression.

So, both could be correct, but the question is which one is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception.

So, which is more applicable here?

Well, the statement is made while the pedestrian was in the car and heard the accident's sound. If the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, that's a present sense impression. But it could also be that the pedestrian was under the stress of the car's movement, making it an excited utterance.

So, perhaps both are valid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the statement is emotional and upset. That's a specific fact. So if it can be proven that the pedestrian was under stress, then excited utterance applies. Since the pedestrian was a bystander and ran up after the accident, it's possible that they were under the stress of the situation.

So, the statement would be admissible under excited utterance. So option B is correct.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is emotional, but it's not a fact. So the excited utterance exception requires that the statement is made under stress, not just that it's emotional.

So, perhaps the answer is B: admissible under excited utterance.

Alternatively, another thought: the pedestrian was a bystander and ran up after the accident. If the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, that's a present sense impression. So, option E is correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

The options for admissibility are:

A: Admissible only if the bystander wasn't involved. No, because they were involved.

B: Admissible under excited utterance. Possibly.

C: Admissible as non-hearsay. No, because it's a statement.

D: Admissible even if hearsay. But since it's a statement, it's hearsay. So D is incorrect.

E: Admissible under present sense impression. Possibly.

F: Admissible under excited utterance? No, I think F is incorrect because the statement isn't admissible under excited utterance if the exception isn't applicable.

Wait, the excited utterance exception requires that the statement was made under stress. So, if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, that might be a present sense impression.

Alternatively, if the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident, perhaps that's a trigger for stress.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: admissible under present sense impression.

Because the statement is made while the pedestrian was in the car and heard the accident's sound. So, the pedestrian was in a car, and the accident happened nearby, which made them feel excited. So, the statement would be a present sense impression.

Thus, option E would be correct.

Alternatively, if the pedestrian was outside and heard the accident, that's a present sense impression. But the question doesn't specify.

Wait, but the pedestrian ran up after the accident. Perhaps the pedestrian was in the car when the accident happened, and the accident was happening nearby. So, the pedestrian was in the car, heard the accident's sound, which made them under the influence of that sound (present sense impression).

So, E would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that since the pedestrian was not present at the time making the statement, they couldn't testify, but their statement is admissible as a hearsay exception if it's admissible.

Wait, the pedestrian's statement is emotional and upset. Let me think if that's a fact. If the pedestrian is emotional and upset, then their statement is not a fact but an opinion. But wait, the pedestrian's statement is about their feelings, which is not factual. So the statement is hearsay.

So, for the statement to be admissible, it must be admissible under an exception. So the correct option must be B, E, or another.

Wait, another thought: the pedestrian was a bystander and ran up after the accident. If the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, that's a present sense impression. Alternatively, if they were outside and heard the accident, that's a present sense impression. So E is correct.

Alternatively, if the statement was made under the influence of a noise (like the accident's sound), that's a present sense impression. So E would apply.

So, the correct answer is E: admissible under the present sense impression exception.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the pedestrian's emotional statement could be hearsay, but if it's admissible under present sense impression, that would make option E correct.

Alternatively, the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception because the pedestrian was in a position of stress.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: admissible under excited utterance.

But I'm not entirely confident. I'll have to make a decision.
</think>

The pedestrian's statement is emotional and upset, making it a hearsay unless admissibility is proven through an exception. The statement is made while the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, which could trigger a present sense impression if the sound was a sensory trigger. Present sense impression requires a sensory trigger, such as a sound, to make a statement admissible. Since the pedestrian was in a car and heard the accident's sound, it is plausible that the statement was made under the influence of that sound, making it admissible under the present sense impression exception. 

Additionally, the statement could be admissible under the excited utterance exception if the pedestrian was in a position of stress, such as being in a hurry or under the stress of the situation. However, the evidence provided (the pedestrian being in the car and hearing the accident) suggests that the present sense impression is more likely applicable. 

Given the options, the most appropriate answer is:

**E: admissible under the present sense impression exception.**
