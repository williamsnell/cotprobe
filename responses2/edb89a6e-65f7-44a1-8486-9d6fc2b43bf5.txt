Question:

A school board of a large school district is proposing a new dress code for students. Some students feel that this dress code unfairly targets female students. To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?

Options:

A: There is no alternative hypothesis proposed for this test.
B: The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.
C: The shapes of the population distributions are not known.
D: The z-test is not designed for proportions.
E: The sample sizes are too small.
F: The sample sizes are different.
G: The sample wasn't randomly selected.
H: The students who oppose the dress code don't represent the entire population.
I: The sample sizes are too large.
J: The proportions of male and female are not equal.

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I need to figure out why a two-proportion z-test isn't appropriate in this scenario. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a school board wanting to test if there's a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to a new dress code. They did a poll with 60 males and 70 females. 66 female students opposed, and 50 males opposed. So, the problem is why a two-proportion z-test isn't suitable here.

I remember that the two-proportion z-test is used to compare two population proportions. It's appropriate when certain conditions are met, like the sample sizes being large enough, and the number of successes and failures in each group being sufficiently large. 

Looking at the options, let's see which applies. The options mention the number of successes and failures, sample sizes, and other factors.

So, the two groups here are male and female students. The number of successes (opposed) and failures (not opposed) for each group matters. For a z-test to be valid, each should have at least 10 successes and 10 failures. Let's check:

For females: 66 opposed (successes), 70 total. So 66 >=10, 4 (70-66)=4 >=10? Wait, 4 is less than 10. Oh wait no, 4 is less than 10. So wait, that's a problem. 

Wait, no, the wording is "number of successes and failures are not all large enough." So, for each group, both the number of successes and failures should be large enough (like >=10 each). 

So, for females: 66 opposed (successes) and 4 not opposed (failures). 4 is less than 10. So that's a problem. Similarly for males: 50 opposed (successes), 10 not opposed (failures). 10 is the minimum for the failure count. Wait, no, wait. Wait, failure is the other way: for males, 70-50=20 opposed, wait no, 70 total, 50 opposed, so 20 opposed? Wait wait, no, wait: 70 total, 50 opposed. So 70-50=20 female students opposed? Wait wait, no, wait, no, waitâ€”wait, the question says 66 females opposed. So for males, 70-50=20 opposed. So for males, successes are 50, failures 20. For females, successes 66, failures 4.

Wait, but for the two-proportion test, both groups need to have enough successes and failures. I think the rule is that each group needs at least 10 successes and 10 failures. So, if either group doesn't meet that, the test isn't appropriate.

In this case, females have 66 successes and 4 failures. So, 4 is less than 10. That's a problem. So the two-proportion test wouldn't work because one group doesn't meet the required minimums for both successes and failures.

Looking at the options, which one says that. Option B: "The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough." That sounds right.

Option A says there's no alternative hypothesis. That's about the test's purpose, not about test applicability. So not the issue here.

Other options: Option F says the sample sizes are different, but that doesn't directly explain why the test isn't appropriate. Similarly, option E says sample sizes are too large, but in this case, the sample sizes are 60 and 70, which are not too large, but the issue is the number of successes and failures.

Option G says the sample wasn't randomly selected. I don't think that's the issue. The question says they randomly selected so that's not it.

Option I says sample sizes are too large. Again, 60 and 70 are reasonable, so that's not the problem.

Option J: proportions are not equal. The issue isn't about proportions being different, but the number of successes.

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The two-proportion z-test is not appropriate because one group (females) has insufficient successes and failures (4 and 66, respectively), violating the requirement for both to be at least 10. 

Answer: B
