Okay, so I've got this question about nonlinear resistors and their voltage-current (V-I) relations. Hmm, let me see. The question says the relationship is ϱ(t) = (1/2)i²(t). Wait, ϱ is voltage, right? So voltage equals half the current squared. 

The question is whether this resistor is voltage-controlled or current-controlled. Oh wait, I remember that voltage-controlled and current-controlled depend on how the output (voltage or current) relates to the input currents or voltages.

So, in a resistor, normally, the voltage across it is V = iR, where R is the resistance, a constant. But here, it's nonlinear and given by V = (1/2)i². Oh wait, because 1/2 is a constant factor. So V is proportional to the square of the current.

Wait, so when the current increases, the voltage also increases, but not linearly. It's a quadratic relationship. So if the current is i(t), the voltage is (1/2)i², which depends on the square of the current. Therefore, the voltage is controlled by the current. Because the output (voltage) is determined by the input (current) in this way.

Wait, but wait, what does V-I relationship imply about control? Control can be voltage controlled (V is the control signal) or current controlled (I is the control signal). So if the resistor's voltage depends on the square of the current, then the voltage is controlled by the current. Because the current is varying, and the voltage is a function of it.

So the resistor is current-controlled because the output voltage depends on the square of the current. Or wait, the voltage depends on the square of the current, so the control is through the current. So the output voltage is controlled by the current. So the resistor is controlled by the current.

Looking at the options:

A: Controlled by square root of current. No, because V is proportional to I², so sqrt(V) would be proportional to I, so the control would be through voltage, not current.

B: Current-controlled. Yes, because the output is a function of current.

C: Both. No, because V is controlled by I, not both.

D: Depends on frequency. No, because the question is about control mechanism, not frequency.

E: Square of voltage. No, the voltage is proportional to current squared, not voltage squared.

F: Voltage controlled. No, because it's current-controlled.

G: Inverse of current. No, voltage is proportional to I squared, so inverse would be proportional to I inverse squared.

H: Inverse. No, same as above.

I: Square of voltage. No, because V is proportional to I squared.

J: Not controlled. No, because it's controlled.

So the correct answer should be B: The resistor is current controlled.

The voltage across a nonlinear resistor is given by the relationship \( \var�\!(t) = \frac{1}{2} i^2(t) \), where \( \var�\! \) is the voltage and \( i \) is the current. This indicates that the voltage across the resistor is proportional to the square of the current flowing through it. Since the output voltage depends on the current, the resistor is controlled by the current.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by the square root of the current.
- **B**: Correct. The resistor is controlled by the current because the voltage depends on the square of the current.
- **C**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by both voltage and current.
- **D**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by frequency.
- **E**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by the square of the voltage.
- **F**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by the voltage.
- **G**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by the inverse of the current.
- **H**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by the inverse of the current.
- **I**: Incorrect. The resistor is not controlled by the square of the voltage.
- **J**: Incorrect. The resistor is controlled by the current.

The correct answer is **B**.
