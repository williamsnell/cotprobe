Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following governmental report.
Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.
—Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651
Which of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?

Options:

A: The development of a welfare system to support those in need
B: The increase in population during the seventeenth century leading to more workers in the field
C: The discovery of new trade routes that brought in more food
D: The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century
E: The introduction of new crops from the New World during the Columbian Exchange
F: The implementation of a universal basic income
G: The elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century
H: The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work
I: A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the causes of hunger in Normandy in 1651. The question is asking which of the given options would be the most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned in the report. Let me read through the report again to understand the context.

The report talks about 450 sick people who couldn't relieve themselves. Out of those, 200 died one by one, which is a lot. But the remaining 250 still had to be fed, each getting very little bread. So the issue is that these 250 can't survive without food, but the poor aren't getting enough. The inhabitants are hunting mice, which are staple food. They can't eat roots that the animals can't digest, so they have to find other ways to get food. But they don't find enough, so they become weak and can't survive.

The report also mentions that the parish priest, Boult, has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest were on food made from chopped straw and rotted earth. So their food was poor, but others, like animals' bodies, were roasted at the presbytery fire. So there's another source of food for those who couldn't get enough.

Now, the question is about the cause of the hunger. The options are various solutions to this problem. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Development of a welfare system. That would support those in need, which sounds like a good start. But it's just one piece of the puzzle. Without a welfare system, the poor might not get the basic necessities.

Option B: Increase in population during the seventeenth century. The report mentions that more workers were in the field because they're wandering between Rheims and Rhétel. The population was growing, which might mean more food production but also more people to deal with hunger. However, the report also says that the number of people who couldn't find food is 250, so increasing population might not directly address it unless it's enough to reduce the per-person issue.

Option C: Discovery of new trade routes. This would bring in more food. If they can trade with distant lands, they might get more crops or better-farmers to help them. This could reduce hunger because more people would have access to sufficient food.

Option D: Elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution. The agricultural revolution changed farming practices, making it possible for more people to work and produce more food. This would likely help reduce hunger by increasing food availability and productivity.

Option E: Introduction of new crops from the New World. New crops might help in growing more food, but the report doesn't mention that, so I'm not sure about this one. It's possible, but perhaps not the most direct cause.

Option F: Implementation of a universal basic income. This would give people more money, but it's not clear from the report whether this was the case. The report doesn't discuss this, so maybe it's not the best fit.

Option G: Elimination of the Black Plague. The report doesn't mention this, so I can't assume it's a factor here.

Option H: Creation of a strong putting-out system. This system would pay workers for their labor. If people were paid, maybe they'd work more to produce more food, but the report doesn't indicate such a system was in place.

Option I: Declining population leading to better food yields. If fewer people lived, maybe each person could have more food. But the report says the population was growing, so this might not be the case.

So, the options that are directly related to the report's context are A, C, D, and I. But I need to think about which would be most responsible.

The report mentions that the poor couldn't find enough food. The issue is that they weren't getting enough to eat, so the solutions are either providing more food (like option C and D) or supporting them (A). The question is which is the best responsible.

Option D is about the agricultural revolution. That would allow more people to work and produce more food, which directly addresses the issue of insufficient food that the poor couldn't get. The report says that in the early 17th century, a lot of the poor couldn't find food because they couldn't farm properly. So D would address the problem.

Option C is about trade routes. If they could trade, that would bring in more food. But the report doesn't mention that the economy was expanding. It's possible, but perhaps the agricultural revolution was the key.

Between C and D, D seems more directly tied to the report's context, as the report talks about the population growth and the need for more food production. So I think D is the answer.

The question asks which option would most effectively address the hunger problem described in the report. The report highlights that 250 people couldn't find enough food, likely due to poor farming practices and limited access to food sources. 

- **Option A** focuses on a welfare system, which supports those in need but doesn't directly address the root cause of hunger.
- **Option B** suggests an increase in population, which could lead to more food production but doesn't directly solve the issue.
- **Option C** involves new trade routes, which could bring in more food, but the report doesn't indicate expansion in trade.
- **Option D** refers to the agricultural revolution, which transformed farming practices, allowing more people to work and produce more food. This directly addresses the problem by improving food availability.
- **Option I** involves a putting-out system, which would pay workers for labor but isn't mentioned in the context of the report.

Given the report's focus on population growth and poor farming practices, **Option D** (elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution) is the most responsible for ending hunger.

**Answer: D**
