The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Wherever I go—the street, the shop, the house, or the steamboat—I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they are yet unable to conceive of the Negro as possessing any rights at all. Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'
"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate."
—Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a passage from the Federalist papers, specifically Federalist #15, and I need to figure out which development contributed to the sentiment expressed there. Let me read through the passage again to make sure I understand the context.

The passage is talking about the idea that whites have natural rights to the blacks, even though the relations between masters and slaves have been changed by the Civil War. It mentions that when freedmen are freed, the people say things like 'the niggers will catch hell.' The reasoning is that the whites view blacks as their property, even though the internal relations have been affected.

Federalist #15 is the 15th paragraph of the 15th pamphlet in the Federalist series, written by James Madison. The paragraph is about the natural rights of the blacks to the whites and the reasons for their perception that they deserve the same rights regardless of the internal changes.

So, the question is asking which event in history contributed to this sentiment. The options include various forms of conflict and colonization between the US and Europe.

Let me think about the context. The passage mentions that the Whites esteem the blacks as property. They think the blacks have a natural right, even if the internal structures have been disrupted. So, the sentiment is about the Whites thinking that the blacks have a natural status, not tied to their individual or family history.

Looking at the options:

A: Dutch traders forced ships to extend tribute. That's probably not related. Tributes are about foreign or colonial claims, not about the natural rights of the blacks.

B: Russian explorers in the Pacific Northwest. That's about expansion and westward invasions, not directly tied to the natural rights of the blacks.

C: Portugal imposing trade restrictions. That could be about economic impact, but perhaps more about foreign rights than internal relations.

D: Spain denying access to the Mississippi River. That's about a natural resource, but again, not about the internal relations between the races.

E: Italy's mercenaries seizing control of the Mississippi. That's about controlling a key resource, not about the natural rights of the blacks.

F: Great Britain refusing to evacuate Forts in the Lakes. That's about fortifications, which is more of a defense issue, not about property rights.

G: French and Spanish skirmishes on the frontier with settlers. This sounds like the French and Spanish colonies fighting with American settlers. That's a form of conflict that would create a sense of inequality, as the French and Spanish might be considered superior. This could contribute to the feeling that the Whites (or the blacks) have a right to the land, as it creates a hostile environment, making the blacks feel threatened and thus deserving of more rights.

H: British support for Indian tribes in raids. That's about local conflicts, perhaps, but it's more about local autonomy and resistance.

I: French aiding Indian tribes in raids on New England. This is about controlling the frontier region, creating an environment where the white settlers might feel threatened.

J: Spanish taking Florida from the US. That's a territorial claim, which might stem from internal conflicts but perhaps not the direct cause of the natural rights sentiment described.

So, the key here is that the sentiment is about Whites believing the blacks have independent rights. This would happen when there's conflict between races, creating tensions and creating a hostile environment. The French and Spanish skirmishes (G) and raids (I) on frontier areas would create such tension, leading to a feeling that the blacks are in a position to take advantage of the Whites, which reinforces the idea that the Whites have the right to the land.

Looking at the options, G and I both seem relevant. But the passage in the question is about the development contributing to the sentiment, not about the causes of the sentiment. So which option is the best fit?

The passage mentions that the Whites see blacks as their property, regardless of internal relations. The context of the passage is about the sentiments towards the natural rights of the blacks, which is about the Whites' perception that the blacks have a right to the land. This is likely due to historical conflicts, such as skirmishes and raids, which create a hostile environment.

In the Federalist #15, the sentiment is about the Whites' view that the blacks have property rights. This is because the passages state that the Whites believe the blacks are yet unable to conceive of rights, implying that they have a natural status. This is due to conflicts that create a hostile environment, like the ones mentioned in G and I.

Looking at the options, both G and I are events that create such hostile relations. But the question is which development contributed to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15. So the sentiment is about the Whites' belief that the blacks have property rights, which is a result of the nature of the conflicts.

So, perhaps the key is the idea that the Whites, because of such conflicts, feel that the blacks have the right to the land. So, the events that create this hostile environment (G and I) contribute to the sentiment.

The question is about which specific development contributed. So, I think the answer is either G or I, but looking at the options, the correct answer is G: French and Spanish forces engaged in skirmishes with American settlers on the western frontier.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought G and I are both relevant, but the options are separate. Let's see the options again:

The options are:

G: French and Spanish forces engaged in skirmishes with American settlers on the western frontier.
I: French forces supported American Indians in conducting raids on New England.

Wait, but the passage is about the Whites' belief that the blacks have property rights. The situation in G is about the French and Spanish fighting with settlers, which could make the settlers feel threatened. This in turn makes the Whites think the blacks have rights, because they are in a hostile environment. So this would contribute to the sentiment.

In contrast, I is about the French aiding Indian tribes, which might also create tension, but it's about local conflicts.

So the correct answer should be G. But wait, the passage is about the Whites' perception of the blacks as property, regardless of internal relations. So the events in G and I (and H) would contribute to this perception.

Looking again, Federalist #15 is about the Whites thinking the blacks have property. The passage says that the Whites believe the blacks are still unable to conceive of rights, indicating that they have the status.

The events that create this sense are the forms of conflict that make the Whites feel that the blacks are in a position to exploit the land, thus having the right.

So the correct answer is either G or I. But in the options, G is about French and Spanish, I is about French aiding Indian tribes.

Wait, the passage in question refers to the increased tensions between the Whites and the blacks because of internal changes. The passage doesn't mention the Indian tribes' situation, but the French and Spanish skirmishes (G) would create such tensions, making the Whites think the blacks have rights.

So I think G is the correct answer.
</think>

The question asks which development contributed to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, which highlights the Whites' belief that the blacks have property rights, even though internal relations have been altered. The sentiment arises from tensions created by conflicts between races, such as skirmishes and raids, which foster hostile environments. These events make the Whites feel threatened, thereby believing the blacks have rights.

Analyzing the options, the events that create such hostile relations are:

- **G:** French and Spanish forces engaged in skirmishes with American settlers on the western frontier.
- **I:** French forces supported American Indians in conducting raids on New England.

Both G and I create tension, but the passage specifically refers to the broader context of internal racial tensions, which leads to the Whites' perception of the blacks having property rights. Therefore, the correct answer is **G**.

**Answer: G**
