Okay, I'm trying to figure out the antecedent of the given conditional proposition. Let's see, the question is about logic, specifically about conditional statements. 

So, the proposition is: The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it. Hmm. I remember that in logic, a conditional statement is usually structured as "If P, then Q." But sometimes it's phrased differently. 

Wait, the phrase "only if" is key here. I think "only if" translates to "if and only if," but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. The structure is "P only if Q and R." So, the antecedent (the 'if' part) would be P, which would be "the university raises tuition." But wait, wait, no—wait, no—no, the way the statement is phrased says it's raising tuition only if two conditions are met. So the main antecedent is the raising of tuition. Wait no, no, wait. Let's break it down.

The sentence is: The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board recommends it. So, this is like a "only if" situation. So in logic terms, it's P only if Q and R, which is P → (Q ∧ R). So the antecedent of the main conditional is P, which is "the university raises tuition." But wait, the question is about the antecedent of the given conditional proposition. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition, which may be the original statement or a part of it.

Wait, the original statement is the entire conditional: "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board recommends it." So that's equivalent to (T only if G and B), which is T → (G ∧ B), where T is "the university raises tuition," G is "the governor approves," and B is "the board recommends."

In logic, this is a conditional statement. The antecedent in this statement is T, because the proposition is T → (G ∧ B). But wait, the question is about the antecedent of the original conditional. Wait, no—the question says "Identify the antecedent of the following conditional proposition." The conditional proposition given is the one in the question, so in that case, the antecedent is the "only if" part. Wait, no, the antecedent is the part before the implication. No, wait, in a conditional statement "If P, then Q," P is the antecedent, Q is the consequent.

Wait, the structure is P → Q. So in the given statement, it's T → (G ∧ B). So the antecedent (P) is "the university raises tuition." So if the question is asking for the antecedent of the given proposition, then it's T. But the options don't have T as an option. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

A: The board of trustees does not recommend it.
B: The governor approves of it.
C: The board of trustees recommends it.
D: The governor disapproves of it and the board of trustees does not recommend it.
E: The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.
F: The university does not raise tuition.
G: Both the governor and the board of trustees do not approve of it.
H: The university raises tuition.
I: The governor disapproves of it.
J: The governor approves of it or the board of trustees recommends it.

Wait, the options don't include "the university raises tuition." So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, wait no—the question is about identifying the antecedent of the following conditional proposition. So the main antecedent in the given statement is "the university raises tuition." But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm looking at the antecedent of the entire implication, which would be the entire left side of the 'only if' clause.

Wait, let me think again. The given statement is: The university raises tuition only if ( governor approves and board recommends ). So this can be written in logic as T → (G ∧ B). So the antecedent is T, but the question is about the antecedent of the proposition, which is the entire implication. Wait, no—the question is asking for the antecedent of the proposition, which in this case is T, but since the options don't have T, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the original conditional proposition is a different structure. Maybe the way it's phrased is that the university raises tuition is a result of the conditions being met. Maybe I should parse the entire statement into a standard conditional form.

Another approach: The conditional statement is of the form "P only if Q and R." So "only if" translates to "if, then." So "P only if Q and R" is equivalent to P → (Q ∧ R). Alternatively, "only if" is sometimes expressed as "the only way P is true is if Q and R are true." So that would mean P can only be true if Q and R are true. So for the antecedent, I think the antecedent is the "only if" part. Wait no, the antecedent is the part before the implication. The structure is T → (G ∧ B), so the antecedent is T, because in P → Q, P is the antecedent. So the antecedent of the main implication is "the university raises tuition."

But the options don't have "the university raises tuition." Let me look again.

Option H says, "The university raises tuition." Oh, so that's option H. So the antecedent is T, and in the options, option H is the same as T. So the answer would be H. But wait, the options are presented as possible antecedents of the given proposition. Let me check all the options.

Wait, the question is to find the antecedent of the given conditional proposition. The given proposition is: "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it."

Wait, another way to parse this: "If the university raises tuition, then the governor approves and the board of trustees recommends it." So the antecedent here is "the university raises tuition."

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the antecedent is the 'only if' part. Wait, in logic, the 'only if' is a way of saying that Q and R are necessary for P. So the antecedent is P, and the consequent is Q and R.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the entire structure. The given statement is: P only if Q and R. So, P is the only if part. So the antecedent is P, and the consequent is Q and R. But the question is about the antecedent of the given proposition. So the given proposition is a single implication where the antecedent is P.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the antecedent of the proposition, which in this case is T, but since the options don't have T, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the original conditional proposition is a different structure.

Wait, another approach: The given statement can be rephrased as "The university raises tuition if and only if the governor approves and the board recommends it." Because "only if" is equivalent to "if and only if" when both conditions are required. So the statement is P ↔ (Q ∧ R). So in that case, the antecedent is P, but the question is about the antecedent of a different structure.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The original statement is a conditional: "P only if Q and R." Which is P → (Q ∧ R). So the antecedent here is P. So if the question is looking for the antecedent of the given proposition, which is in the form P → (Q ∧ R), then the antecedent is P.

But the options don't have "the university raises tuition." So perhaps the question is asking for the antecedent of the entire implication, which is the entire 'only if' part. Wait, no, the antecedent is the entire 'only if' clause. So the antecedent is "both the governor approves and the board recommends it." But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the way I'm parsing the sentence is incorrect. Let me try again. The sentence is: "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." So the structure is P only if Q ∧ R. So P is "the university raises tuition." So the antecedent is P, which is the university raising tuition. But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the entire 'only if' part as the antecedent. But that doesn't make sense. Let me think: Maybe the antecedent is the part of the statement that comes before 'only if'. No, wait, the structure is 'only if', so the antecedent is the condition. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is being asked in a way that the antecedent of the given proposition is the part before 'only if,' but that's not correct. Because in the structure 'P only if Q and R,' P is the antecedent, and Q and R are the consequent.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the antecedent of the entire conditional, which in this case is "the university raises tuition." So the antecedent is T. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again, especially since the user provided some options that are about the conditions themselves.

Wait, the options are about the parts that are conditions. For example, option C is "The board of trustees recommends it." Option B is the governor approves. Option G is both disapprove.

Wait, the original statement is that the university raises tuition only if both the governor approves and the board recommends it. So, the 'only if' part is the two conditions. So the antecedent of the implication is the 'only if' part. Wait, but that's not correct because the implication's antecedent is P, which is the university raising tuition. The only if part is just a condition for P.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the antecedent of the entire implication. The implication is "P only if Q and R." So P is the antecedent, Q and R are the consequence. So the antecedent is P, but in the options, I don't see P.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the antecedent of the given conditional, which is the entire 'only if' part. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the contrapositive. The original statement can be written as T → (G ∧ B). The contrapositive is ~ (G ∧ B) → ~T. But that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps the antecedent of the given statement is the entire 'only if' part. Let me read the options again. Option C says the board of trustees recommends it. If I think about the statement, the two conditions ( governor approves and board recommends) are necessary for the university to raise tuition. So the university only raises tuition if both conditions are met. So the antecedent of the implication is "the university raises tuition."

But the options don't include that. Hmm, perhaps the question is looking for the part that is a necessary condition. So the answer would be the conjunction of the two, but that's not an option either. 

Wait, another approach: If the question is about the antecedent of the given proposition, which is the 'only if' part. But the only if part in the given statement is "both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." So the antecedent of the implication is "both the governor approves and the board of trustees recommends it." But that's not an option.

Wait, the given options don't include that. The closest options are C and G. Option C is "The board of trustees recommends it," and G is "Both the governor and the board of trustees do not approve of it."

Option C is the second part of the 'only if' condition. So perhaps the antecedent of the 'only if' clause is the conjunction of the two conditions. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is about the antecedent of the entire implication. The implication is T → (G ∧ B), so the antecedent is T, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is confused, but looking at the options, the correct one would be the statement that forms the 'only if' condition, which is the conjunction of G and B. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the structure. Maybe the structure is that the university raises tuition only if the conditions are met, which are the two statements. So the antecedent is the entire 'only if' part. But that's not right. The antecedent in the implication is the university raising tuition.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the conjunction of G and B. But that's not an option. Let me check all the options:

Option C: The board of trustees recommends it. That's part of the 'only if' condition.

Option G: Both the governor and the board of trustees do not approve of it. That's the negation of the 'only if' condition.

Wait, wait. The original statement is "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." So the 'only if' part is "both the governor approves and the board of trustees recommends it." So the antecedent of the implication is "the university raises tuition." But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is asking about the contrapositive or something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the antecedent of the entire implication. The implication is T → (G ∧ B). The antecedent is T. But since none of the options have T, perhaps the question is actually about the 'only if' condition, which is the conjunction of G and B. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: The question is about the antecedent of the given proposition. The given proposition is T → (G ∧ B). So the antecedent is T, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is looking for the part that is the necessary condition, which is the conjunction of G and B. But that's not an option either. 

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is the second part of the 'only if' condition. That is, the board of trustees recommends it. So, if the university raises tuition only if the board of trustees recommends it, then the antecedent is the university raising tuition, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the 'only if' part requires both conditions. So, the antecedent is the university raising it, but perhaps the question is about the necessary conditions, which are both G and B.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the conjunction of G and B. That is, the university only raises tuition if both the governor and the board approve. But that's not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: Identify the antecedent of the following conditional proposition: The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.

So the given proposition is: T only if (G and B). Which is T → (G ∧ B). So the antecedent is T. But the options don't have T. So perhaps the question is about the antecedent of the entire implication, which is T, but in the options, the only one that includes T is option H. But wait, option H says the university raises tuition, which is T. So that's the antecedent.

So the correct answer should be H. Because the antecedent is T, which is option H.
</think>

The antecedent of the given conditional proposition is "the university raises tuition," which corresponds to option H.

ANSWER: H
