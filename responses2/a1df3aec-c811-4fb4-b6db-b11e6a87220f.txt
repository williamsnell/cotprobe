Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the thermodynamics concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says a chemist expands an ideal gas against a constant external pressure of 700 mmHg. The volume changes from 50 liters to 150 liters, and 1.55 Kcal of heat is absorbed. We need to find the internal energy change, ΔU.

Hmm, right, internal energy change relates to the first law of thermodynamics. The first law is ΔU = q + w, where q is the heat added to the system and w is the work done on the system. Wait, wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about the sign conventions here. Because when the system does work, it's considered negative work. Let me get this straight.

Wait, another point: The system expands, meaning it's doing work on the surroundings. So the work done by the system (w) is negative because the system is losing energy as it expands. Or wait, no, I think the formula is ΔU = q + w, where w is work done by the system. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, let me think again. The first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is work done on the system. So when the system does work (expands), that work is negative because the system is losing energy. So I need to calculate the work done on the system, which in this case would be the work done by the system (since the system is doing work).

So what's the formula for work in expansion under constant pressure? Oh right, the work done by the system when expanding against a constant external pressure is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign.

Wait, the formula is: For expansion, the work done by the system is negative. So if the system expands (ΔV positive), the work (w) is negative because the system is losing energy as it expands. So the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but let's make sure. I think the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Because when the system expands (ΔV positive), the work is negative. Oh yes, that makes sense because the system is doing work on the surroundings, which is why the work is negative.

So given that, the work done by the system is negative. So when the system does work, it's losing energy, so the work is negative. So in this case, the system expands, so the work is negative.

So let's compute the work. The process is expansion, so the work done by the system is negative.

But wait, wait, we have to calculate the work using the given pressure and change in volume.

Wait, the pressure given is 700 mmHg. I need to convert that into atmospheres since the given value is in liters-atm. Because the problem states that 24.217 cal = 1 liter-atm. So I need to convert 700 mmHg to atm.

I remember that atmospheric pressure is about 760 mmHg. So 700 mmHg is 700 / 760 atm. Let me compute that. 700 divided by 760. Let me do it: 700 ÷ 760 = approx 0.92105 atm. So 700 mmHg is about 0.921 atm.

The volume change is from 50 to 150 liters. So ΔV is 150 -50 = 100 liters. So ΔV is +100 L.

Now, the work done by the system (w) is -P_ext * ΔV. So plugging in the numbers:

w = - (0.921 atm) * (100 L) = -92.1 L·atm.

But wait, the question gives the conversion that 24.217 cal = 1 L·atm. So how does that help? Because the work is in L·atm, and we need to convert it to calories.

Since 1 L·atm is 24.217 cal, so the work in cal would be (92.1 L·atm) * 24.217 cal/L·atm.

Wait, since the work is negative, the value is - (92.1 * 24.217) cal.

Let me compute that:

92.1 * 24.217. Let me do this step by step.

24.217 *90 is 2179.53, 24.217 *2.1 is about 50.8557. So adding together: 2179.53 +50.8557 ≈ 2230.386 cal.

Wait, but because it's negative, w = -2230.386 cal.

Wait, but wait, wait, no. Because the work is done by the system, so q is positive (heat is absorbed), so the work is negative because the system is losing energy. So the formula for ΔU is q + w. Since q is positive (heat is absorbed), and w is negative (work done by system), the overall ΔU would be q - |w|.

Wait, but let's get the signs right. Let me make it clear.

The system absorbs heat, so q is positive. The work done by the system is negative. So the first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So in this case, the system is doing work, so w is negative. So ΔU = q - |w|.

So substituting the numbers:

q is 1.55 Kcal, which is positive.

w (work done by system) is -92.1 L·atm, which is equal to - (92.1 * 24.217) cal = -2230.387 cal. But wait, wait, no. Wait, what's the relationship between work in L·atm and calories.

The problem states that 24.217 cal equals 1 L·atm. So 1 L·atm is 24.217 cal. So 92.1 L·atm is 92.1 * 24.217 cal. So 92.1 *24.217 = let's compute.

Let me compute 92 *24.217 = 92 *24 is 2208, 92 *0.217 is about 20. So about 2228. Then 0.1 *24.217 is about 2.4217. So 2228 + 2.4217 ≈ 2230.42 cal. So 92.1 L·atm is 2230.42 cal, so w is -2230.42 cal.

Now, the first law is ΔU = q + w, where q is positive, w is negative.

So ΔU = 1.55 Kcal + (-2230.42 cal) → but wait, wait a minute! Units are in Kcal and cal. So I need to convert q to cal to match the units.

Wait, because 1 Kcal is 1000 cal. So 1.55 Kcal is 1550 cal.

So q = 1550 cal.

So ΔU = 1550 cal + (-2230.42 cal) → 1550 - 2230.42 = -680.42 cal.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Because the work done by the system is negative, so in the formula ΔU = q + w, and w is -2230.42 cal. So 1550 + (-2230.42) = -680.42 cal.

So ΔU is -680.42 cal. But looking at the options, there's an option J, which is -0.50 Kcal. Wait, but I'm getting -680 cal.

Wait, wait, but the options are in Kcal. So I need to convert the ΔU to Kcal.

ΔU = -680.42 cal → divide by 1000 to get Kcal: -0.68042 Kcal. So about -0.68 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option E is -0.50 Kcal, and option I is -0.68 Kcal.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I get the sign correct for the work?

Wait, the system is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings. So from the system's perspective, the work done by the system is negative. Because the system loses energy as it does work.

So in the formula, ΔU = q + w. If the system loses energy (work done on the system is negative), so in this case, w is negative. So q is positive, w is negative.

So let's recompute.

q = 1.55 Kcal = 1550 cal.

w = - (700 mmHg * 100 L) * (24.217 cal / 1 L·atm) ) → because 700 mmHg is 0.921 atm.

w = - (0.921 atm * 100 L) * 24.217 cal/(L·atm) )

Wait, 0.921 * 100 is 92.1 L·atm.

Multiply by 24.217 cal/(L·atm) → 92.1 *24.217 = 2230.42 cal. So w = -2230.42 cal.

So ΔU = 1550 cal + (-2230.42 cal) → 1550 -2230.42 = -680.42 cal.

Convert -680.42 cal to Kcal: divide by 1000 → -0.68042 Kcal, approximately -0.68 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option E is -0.50 Kcal, option I is -0.68 Kcal.

So the correct answer would be option E or I. Wait, but I got -0.68042, so approximately -0.68 Kcal. So option I is -0.68 Kcal.

But wait, wait another moment. Did I get the sign right? Because sometimes the sign can be tricky.

Wait, let me think again about the sign for the work.

The system does work, so the work done by the system is negative. So in the formula, w is negative. So ΔU = q + w. So q is positive, w is negative.

So 1550 - 2230.42 = -680.42 cal. Which is -0.680 Kcal.

This matches option I, which is -0.68 Kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option E is -0.50 Kcal.

Option I is -0.68 Kcal.

So the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but sometimes, depending on how the formula is presented, the sign could have flipped. Did I mix up q and w?

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the work as the system does work.

Work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So P_ext is 700 mmHg, which is 0.921 atm. ΔV is 100 L (since from 50 to 150 is +100 L). So w = - (0.921 atm) * (100 L) → w = -92.1 L·atm.

Convert this to cal: 92.1 L·atm * 24.217 cal/(L·atm) = 2230.42 cal. Wait, so w is -2230.42 cal.

So the first law is ΔU = q + w. q is positive 1.55 Kcal.

So ΔU = 1550 -2230.42 = -680.42 cal → ≈-0.68 Kcal.

So option I is correct.

To determine the internal energy change (ΔU) for the system, we use the first law of thermodynamics: 

\[
\Delta U = q + w
\]

Here, \( q \) is the heat absorbed by the system, and \( w \) is the work done on the system. The problem states that the system absorbs 1.55 Kcal of heat, so \( q = 1.55 \, \text{Kcal} \). The work done by the system is calculated as:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

The external pressure is \( P_{\text{ext}} = 700 \, \text{mmHg} \), which converts to \( 0.921 \, \text{atm} \) (since \( 700 \, \text{mmHg} / 760 \, \text{mmHg/atm} = 0.921 \, \text{atm} \)). The volume change is \( \Delta V = 150 \, \text{L} - 50 \, \text{L} = 100 \, \text{L} \). Substituting these values:

\[
w = -(0.921 \, \text{atm}) \cdot (100 \, \text{L}) = -92.1 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

To convert \( w \) to calories, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{L·atm} = 24.217 \, \text{cal} \):

\[
w = -92.1 \, \text{L·atm} \cdot 24.217 \, \text{cal/L·atm} = -2230.42 \, \text{cal}
\]

Now, substituting \( q \) and \( w \) into the first law:

\[
\Delta U = q + w = 1550 \, \text{cal} + (-2230.42 \, \text{cal}) = -680.42 \, \text{cal}
\]

Finally, converting \( \Delta U \) to kilocalories (Kcal):

\[
\Delta U = \frac{-680.42 \, \text{cal}}{1000} = -0.68 \, \text{Kcal}
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is **Option I: -0.68 Kcal**.
