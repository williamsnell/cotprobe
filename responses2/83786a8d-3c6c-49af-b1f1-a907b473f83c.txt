Question:

A circus operates in a rural part of the county. It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the "big top" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb. If the parents assert a claim against the adjuster to recover damages for infliction of emotional distress, they will

Options:

A: not recover, because the adjuster's actions were part of his job duties.
B: recover, because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment.
C: not recover, because the parents took the advice of a neighbor and consulted an attorney.
D: not recover, because the parents did not suffer emotional distress that was severe.
E: not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company.
F: recover, because the adjuster provided false information to the parents.
G: not recover, because the adjuster's actions did not directly cause the boy's injury.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a situation involving a circus and an emotional distress claim. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A 10-year-old boy was injured after an aerial bomb exploded, causing serious injury. The parents of the boy were threatening to file a claim against the circus adjuster because the adjuster's actions were part of the job duties. The parents were initially being warned by the adjuster, who then started harassing them. They ended up consulting a lawyer, who settled for $250,000. The question is whether the parents can recover damages for emotional distress.

I know that emotional distress (ED) is a serious civil issue. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specific law here. Let me think about the legal definitions. Emotional distress is generally considered a "substantial distress" that constitutes a violation of contract law. So, if the circus took the boy's injury as part of their job, then unless the adjusting agent was negligent, the parents might be able to claim.

Wait, but wait—the adjusting agent was the circus adjuster. So he was providing the service, and the injury was a result of that service. The parents were being warned, and then harassment. The adjuster's false information to the parents was a part of their job duties. So the adjuster should be held liable.

But there's a key point here. The adjusting agent was being warned, and the parents were being harassied and eventually got a lawyer. But the main issue is whether the adjuster's actions were part of their job. In contract law, a service provider is liable for the injury caused if the injury was a result of their employment. So, the adjuster should be liable because he was the one providing the service.

However, the question is whether the parents can recover for emotional distress. Emotional distress is a separate issue from negligence. If the adjuster was negligent in causing the injury, then emotional distress isn't an issue. But if the injury was a result of their job, then the adjuster is liable regardless of negligence.

Wait, but the adjuster was being warned and then harassied. That doesn't automatically make him negligent. Negligence requires that the adjusting agent was in a position of professional responsibility and that their actions were unreasonable. So, the adjuster was performing his job duties as an adjuster, which includes providing the service. If the injury was a result of that service, even if he was negligent, he's still liable.

But the parents were being harassed and eventually got a lawyer. The initial action was being warned, which isn't necessarily negligent. So the adjuster's actions were part of his job duties, which would make him liable for the injury, regardless of whether he was negligent.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is whether the parents can recover for emotional distress. So, even if the adjuster was negligent, the injury was a result of his job, so he's liable for the injury regardless of negligence. So the parents can claim for the injury, but whether they can claim for emotional distress is a different matter.

Emotional distress is a separate aspect. So if the adjuster was negligent, he might have been at fault for the injury, but emotional distress isn't automatically recoverable. So, the parents might not be able to recover for emotional distress unless the adjuster's negligence was intentional or due to reckless disregard.

In this case, the adjusting agent (c circus) was being warned and then harassied. There's no indication that he was negligent in causing the injury. So, the adjusting agent should be liable for the injury, but not necessarily for emotional distress.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. The question says that the adjusting agent was aware the children weren't claiming, but that the applicable civil code doesn't provide for recovery in such a situation. The parents tried to negotiate a settlement but the adjuster kept telling them they wouldn't get anything. So, the parents were initially dismissed or at least threatened.

But the question is about whether they can claim for emotional distress. So, emotional distress is a separate issue from negligence. So, the court would likely find the adjusting agent liable for the injury because it was his job, but not necessarily for emotional distress. So, the parents might not be able to recover for that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me recap. The key point is whether the adjusting agent is liable for emotional distress. If the injury was a result of his job, then he's liable for the injury regardless of negligence. But emotional distress is a separate issue. The question is whether the parents can recover for emotional distress. So, if the adjusting agent was negligent, he might not be liable for emotional distress. If he wasn't negligent, he's liable, but he might not be liable for emotional distress.

In this case, the adjusting agent was being warned and then harassied. There's no indication that he was negligent. So, he's liable for the injury, but unless he was negligent, he might not be liable for emotional distress.

Wait, but the adjusting agent was being warned and then harassied. That doesn't mean that he was negligent. Because, even if the adjusting agent was being told something and then being harassied, that's not negligence. Negligence requires that the adjusting agent was in a position of professional responsibility and that their conduct was unreasonable. So, the adjusting agent was performing his job duties as a circus adjuster, so if he was negligent in causing the injury, he's liable for the injury but not necessarily emotional distress.

But the problem is, the adjusting agent might have been negligent in the actual injury, but the question is about emotional distress. So, emotional distress is a separate issue. The parents might not be able to recover for emotional distress if the adjusting agent was negligent. But the parents tried to negotiate a settlement, but the adjusting agent kept threatening them.

But the question is about whether the parents can assert a claim against the adjusting agent for emotional distress. So, the adjusting agent's actions were part of his job, so he should be liable for the injury, but the emotional distress question is whether he was negligent.

Wait, but the adjusting agent was being warned. I think the key here is that the adjusting agent was performing his job duties, so he's liable. But whether he was negligent in causing the emotional distress is another matter. Without any indication of negligence, he's liable for the injury but not necessarily for emotional distress.

So, the parents might not be able to recover for emotional distress, unless the adjusting agent was negligent in causing it. But since the question says that the parents were being warned and then harassment, it implies that the adjusting agent was aware of the children’s lack of claim and thus was being told that the children were not claiming. But the question states that the parents had retained a lawyer. 

Wait, but the question is whether the parents can recover for emotional distress regardless. So, if the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury, then emotional distress isn't a separate issue. But the question doesn't say that the adjusting agent was negligent. It says that the adjusting agent was aware of the children's lack of claim but the applicable civil code doesn't provide for recovery in such a situation. So, the parents tried to negotiate but the adjusting agent kept telling them they wouldn't get anything. So, perhaps the adjusting agent's actions were not negligent, but just part of his job duties.

In that case, the adjusting agent is liable for the injury, but not necessarily for emotional distress. So, unless the adjuster was negligent, the parents can't claim for emotional distress.

Wait, but emotional distress is a separate issue. So, the adjusting agent is liable for the injury, but not necessarily for emotional distress, but the question is whether the parents can recover for emotional distress.

So, looking at the options:

Option F: "recover, because the adjuster provided false information to the parents."

Wait, that would be about false information. If the adjusting agent was being told something (like the children weren't claiming) but then was being warned and then harassied, that's not about false information. So, maybe option F is incorrect.

Another option is option G: "not recover, because the parents took the advice of a neighbor and consulted an attorney." But the parents did get a lawyer, so that's not it.

Option B: "recover, because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment." But that's about the nature of the charges, not necessarily about the liability for the injury.

Option E: "not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company." So, the parents were awarded a settlement, but that's for the injury, not emotional distress. So, unless the adjuster was negligent in causing the emotional distress, the parents can't recover for it.

Option A: "not recover, because the adjuster's actions were part of his job duties." But that's not correct because even if the adjusting agent was part of his job, he might still be liable if the injury was a result of his duty.

So, the key point is whether the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury. If he was negligent, he's liable for the injury regardless of emotional distress, but not for the emotional distress itself. 

Wait, but in this scenario, the adjusting agent was being warned, and then being harassied. That doesn't necessarily mean he was negligent. Negligence requires he was in a position of professional responsibility and his conduct was unreasonable. So, if he was performing his job duties, he's liable for the injury, but not necessarily for emotional distress unless he was negligent.

So, the question is about whether he was negligent. The question states that the adjusting agent was aware that the children were not claiming, but the applicable code doesn't provide for recovery. So, the parents tried to negotiate, but the adjusting agent kept threatening them. So, perhaps the adjusting agent was aware of the children’s lack of claim and thus was being told that the children were not claiming. But in that scenario, perhaps he was negligent in causing the injury.

Wait, but that's a different issue. So, if the adjusting agent was aware of the children's lack of claim and thus was being told that the children were not claiming, that could imply that he was in a position of professional duty to provide the service, and perhaps was negligent in causing the injury. But I'm not sure. 

But the question is whether the parents can recover emotional distress. So, if the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury, he's not liable for emotional distress. But if he wasn't negligent, then he's liable for the injury but not necessarily for emotional distress.

Wait, but the adjusting agent was being warned, and then being harassied. So, maybe the adjusting agent was negligent because he was being told something and then being interrupted. But I don't know if that's the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the answer options again. The parents can recover for the injury if the adjusting agent was negligent, but not for emotional distress unless he was negligent. Since the question says the adjusting agent's actions were part of his job duties, he's liable for the injury, but not necessarily for emotional distress.

So, if the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury, he's not liable for emotional distress. But the question doesn't say anything about him being negligent, only that the adjusting agent was being warned and then harassied. I think that indicates that the adjusting agent was aware of the children's lack of claim and was being told that the children were not claiming. But I don't think that necessarily makes him negligent.

Wait, but if the adjusting agent was aware of the children's lack of claim, perhaps he was in a position of professional duty, and thus, if he was negligent in causing the injury, he's liable for the injury. But the question doesn't indicate whether he was negligent.

Alternatively, the adjusting agent was being warned, which might imply he was in a position of professional duty and thus could have been negligent. So, perhaps the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury, making him liable for the injury but not for emotional distress.

But the question is about emotional distress, not negligence. So, unless the adjusting agent was negligent, he's not liable for emotional distress. So, the parents cannot recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was negligent.

Wait, but the options are about whether the parents can recover, not about whether the adjusting agent was negligent. So, the adjusting agent's actions were part of his job, so he's liable for the injury, but not necessarily for emotional distress unless he was negligent.

So, the parents can't recover for emotional distress unless the adjusting agent was negligent, but the question says that the applicable code doesn't provide for recovery in such a situation. So, the parents tried to negotiate a settlement, but the adjusting agent kept threatening them, which might indicate that the adjusting agent was negligent.

Wait, but the question doesn't state that the adjusting agent was negligent. The issue is whether the parents can recover for emotional distress. So, even if the adjusting agent was negligent, they can't recover for emotional distress. So, the answer would be that they can't recover because the adjusting agent was negligent. But the question is whether the adjusting agent was negligent. The question states that the adjusting agent was aware of the children's lack of claim, but that doesn't make him negligent. He was being warned and then harassied, but that doesn't mean he was negligent. So, perhaps the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury, making him liable for the injury but not for emotional distress.

But the question is whether the parents can recover for emotional distress. If the adjusting agent was negligent, no. If he wasn't negligent, yes. But without knowing, we have to answer based on the facts.

So, the parents were being warned, which might not be negligence, and then being harassied. So, the adjusting agent was performing his job duties, so he's liable for the injury, but not necessarily for emotional distress unless he was negligent. Since the question doesn't state that the adjusting agent was negligent, the parents cannot recover for emotional distress.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says not recover because his actions were part of his job. That's correct in terms of liability for the injury. But emotional distress is a separate issue. So, even if he was negligent, he's not liable for emotional distress unless he was negligent.

So, going back, the adjusting agent's actions were part of his job, so he's liable for the injury. But unless he was negligent, he's not liable for emotional distress. Since the question doesn't state that he was negligent, the answer is that the parents can't recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was negligent. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option F: "recover, because the adjuster provided false information to the parents."

But that's about false information. If the adjusting agent was being told something (like the children weren't claiming) but then was being warned and then harassied, that's not about false information. So, option F doesn't fit.

Option G: "not recover, because the parents took the advice of a neighbor and consulted an attorney."

But the parents did get a lawyer, so that's not it.

Option B: "recover, because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment."

But that's about the nature of the charges, not the liability.

Option E: "not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company."

So, the parents got a settlement for the injury, not for emotional distress. So, unless the adjusting agent was negligent in causing emotional distress, they can't recover. Since the question doesn't say the adjusting agent was negligent, the answer is that they can't recover for emotional distress.

Wait, but the adjusting agent was being warned and then being harassied. If that's part of his job duties, then he's liable for the injury but not necessarily for emotional distress unless he was negligent. So, the parents can't claim for emotional distress. So, the answer should be that they can't recover because the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury.

But the options don't give that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Not recover because part of job duties.

B: Recover because actions were harassment.

C: Not recover because parents took advice from neighbor and got an attorney.

D: Not recover because parents didn't suffer severe emotional distress.

E: Not recover because parents received a 250k settlement.

F: Recover because provided false info.

G: Not recover because parents took neighbor's advice and got attorney.

H: Not recover because parents didn't suffer severe emotional distress.

Wait, the question is about emotional distress. So, the parents can't recover for that unless the adjusting agent was negligent. But the question doesn't say that he was negligent. So, unless he was negligent, he's not liable for emotional distress.

But looking at the options, option E says parents eventually received a $250k settlement. That's for the injury, not emotional distress. So, unless the adjusting agent was negligent, they can't claim for emotional distress.

So, the correct answer would be that the parents cannot recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury. But since the options don't include that, perhaps option E refers to the injury, not emotional distress.

Wait, but the question specifically asks whether the parents can recover for emotional distress. So, the only way they can is if the adjusting agent was negligent in causing emotional distress. If the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury, they can't claim for emotional distress.

But the question doesn't provide evidence that the adjusting agent was negligent. The question states that the adjusting agent was aware of the children’s lack of claim, but that doesn't make him negligent. He was being told something (like no claim) and then being interrupted. So, perhaps the adjusting agent was negligent because he was being told something and then interrupted, making him negligent in causing the injury.

If that's the case, then the adjusting agent isn't liable for emotional distress. But the question doesn't specify that the adjusting agent was negligent. So, perhaps the correct answer is that they can't recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent's actions were not necessarily negligent. But I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents can't claim for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury. But the question doesn't state that he was negligent. So, the answer would be that the parents can't recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent's actions were part of his job duties, thus he's liable for the injury but not for emotional distress unless he was negligent.

Wait, but in that case, the parents can't claim for emotional distress because the adjusting agent wasn't negligent. So, the correct answer is that the parents cannot recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was not negligent in causing it. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options, option E says the parents received a $250,000 settlement. That's for the injury. So, the parents can't recover for emotional distress unless the adjusting agent was negligent in causing it. So, if the adjusting agent was negligent, they can't claim. If not, they can.

But the question doesn't provide any indication that the adjusting agent was negligent. So, the answer is that the parents can't claim for emotional distress because the adjusting agent wasn't negligent.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is E: parents received a $250,000 settlement. Because that's for the injury, not emotional distress. So, the parents can't claim for emotional distress because it wasn't awarded. So, the answer is E.

Wait, but the question is about emotional distress, so the parents can't claim unless the adjusting agent was negligent. Since the adjusting agent was being told something and then interrupted, that doesn't imply he was negligent. So, the adjusting agent was performing his job duties, so he's liable for the injury but not for emotional distress unless he was negligent.

But since the question doesn't state that he was negligent, the answer is that the parents can't recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent's actions were part of his job duties, making him liable for the injury but not for emotional distress unless he was negligent.

But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents can't recover because the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the injury. But the question doesn't state that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents can't recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was not negligent. But the options don't have that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of the correct answer based on the options and the reasoning.

The parents were injured because the adjusting agent was providing the service. So, the adjusting agent is liable for the injury. But unless he was negligent, he's not liable for emotional distress. The question doesn't say he was negligent. So, the parents can't claim for emotional distress.

Looking at the options, the only option that says parents can't recover is option E: parents received a $250,000 settlement. Because that's for the injury, not emotional distress. So, the answer is E.

Wait, but option E is about the injury, not emotional distress. So, the parents can't recover for emotional distress because it wasn't awarded. So, the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because I'm considering the options. So, the parents can't recover for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was not negligent in causing it, but he was performing his job duties. So, the answer is E.

Wait, but the question is about emotional distress. So, the parents can't recover because the adjusting agent was negligent in causing the emotional distress, but the question doesn't indicate that. So, the correct answer is that the parents can't claim for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was not negligent.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is E: parents received a $250,000 settlement. Because that's for the injury, not emotional distress.

Wait, but the question is about emotional distress, not the injury. So, the answer should be that the parents can't claim for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was not negligent. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: parents recovered because adjuster provided false info. But that's about false info, not about the injury.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is E: parents received a $250,000 settlement. Because that's for the injury, not emotional distress. So, the parents can't claim for emotional distress.
</think>

The parents can't claim for emotional distress because the adjusting agent was not negligent in causing the injury. The adjusting agent was performing his job duties, making him liable for the injury but not for emotional distress unless he was negligent. Since the question doesn't indicate negligence, the parents cannot recover for emotional distress.

ANSWER: E
