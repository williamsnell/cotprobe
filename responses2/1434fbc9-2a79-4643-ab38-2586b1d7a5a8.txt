Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking which function tends to decline the most with age. The options are A through J. Let me go through each one and think about their typical decline as people age.

Starting with option A: Physical strength. I know that as people age, they generally get less active, so strength might decline. But I'm not sure if that's the most significant decline.

Option B: Ability to learn new languages. I've heard that with age, people tend to forget old languages faster. That makes sense because the brain is getting a bit older, and the brain's capacity for new learning slows down. So this might decline a lot.

Option C: Ability to process information rapidly. Processing speed usually decreases with age. I remember that as you get older, you might take longer to process information, especially complex tasks. So this also seems like a possible answer.

Option D: Attention span. This is a big one. My parents used to be super attentive, but as I grew up, my attention span decreased. I think this decline is more pronounced and might be one of the top choices.

Option E: Taste and smell sensitivity. I don't think sensitivity to taste or smell changes much with age. People's tastes and smells remain relatively stable, so this might not decline much.

Option F: Ability to multitask. I've heard that people tend to multitask less as they age. They might focus more on a single task. So this could be another choice.

Option G: Crystallized intelligence. I'm not sure how this changes with age. Crystallized intelligence refers to knowledge and expertise you've acquired through life, so maybe it stays relatively constant. Unless there's a learning curve, but I don't think it declines a lot.

Option H: Implicit memory. I think implicit memory, like learned behaviors or emotions, doesn't change as much with age. It's more about how we've learned things rather than a decline.

Option I: Short-term memory. I think short-term memory does get a bit smaller with age, but it's not as significant as attention or processing speed decline. So maybe this isn't the top choice.

Option J: Visual acuity. I don't think visual acuity changes much as you age. It's more about vision, which isn't changing that rapidly.

Now, putting it all together. The options that are likely to decline a lot are learning abilities, processing speed, attention, and multitasking. Among these, attention span is a big one. I remember reading that as people get older, their attention span decreases because they get more tired or their minds are less efficient at processing information. So I think D: Attention span is the answer they're looking for.

The function that tends to decline the most with age is **D: Attention span**. As people age, their attention span decreases, often due to fatigue and reduced cognitive efficiency. 

Answer: D
