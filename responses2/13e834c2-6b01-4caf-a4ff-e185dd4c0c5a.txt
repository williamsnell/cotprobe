Okay, so I've got this problem about Quinones Bros. They've been in business for four years, and I need to find the annual rate of growth of their earnings after four years. The earnings are given as the square root of (10t² + t + 236) in thousands of dollars. I'm supposed to find the percentage growth rate after four years.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. So, the earnings after t years are E(t) = sqrt(10t² + t + 236). I need to find the growth rate from year 3 to year 4. Wait, because the question is about the annual rate of growth after four years. Oh wait, maybe it's the growth from year 4 to year 5, but no, the question says "after four years." Oh wait, no, perhaps it's the growth rate in the fourth year, but that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the growth rate over the four-year period, which would be from year 3 to year 4. Alternatively, wait, perhaps the question is to find the growth rate in the fourth year, which would be based on the previous year's earnings. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

The question is: What was the annual rate of growth of earnings after four years? As a percentage, what was the rate of growth of the earnings after four years?

Wait, that wording seems a bit confusing. Oh, perhaps it's asking for the growth rate in the fourth year, which would be based on the earnings from year 3 to year 4. So, it's the growth rate from t=3 to t=4. Alternatively, maybe they're asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years. Hmm, but the question says "annual rate of growth of earnings after four years." So, perhaps it's the growth rate at the end of year 4, relative to some base. Or maybe it's the growth rate between the end of year 3 and year 4, which would be the average annual growth rate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the growth rate in the fourth year, which would be the rate of change at the end of year 4. So, E(4) - E(3) divided by E(3), multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. Or maybe we need to calculate the growth rate from year 3 to year 4 as the average annual growth rate. Wait, but the problem says "annual rate of growth," which implies it's an annualized rate. So, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the growth rate from year 3 to 4 as an annualized rate, so that the growth over the four-year period is represented as a single annual rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the growth rate from year 3 to year 4, which is the same as the growth rate in the fourth year, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about how to compute the growth rate between two consecutive years.

First, I'll compute E(3) and E(4). Since the earnings are given by E(t) = sqrt(10t² + t + 236), let's calculate each.

E(3) = sqrt(10*(3)^2 +3 +236) = sqrt(90 +3 +236) = sqrt(329) ≈ 18.14 thousand dollars.

E(4) = sqrt(10*(4)^2 +4 +236) = sqrt(160 +4 +236) = sqrt(400) = 20.00 thousand dollars.

So, the earnings at the end of year 3 were approximately 18.14 thousand, and at the end of year 4, they are 20.00 thousand.

The growth over the four-year period would be from year 3 to 4. So, the growth factor is E(4)/E(3) = 20/18.14 ≈ 1.1037.

The growth rate is (1.1037 - 1) * 100 ≈ 10.37% over the four-year period. But the question is asking for the annual rate of growth after four years. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps it's the growth rate at the end of the fourth year, relative to the initial earnings. But the problem says "after four years," which could mean the end of the fourth year, which would be E(4) compared to E(0). But that doesn't make sense because, without knowing E(0), it's hard to compute. Alternatively, maybe it's the growth rate during the fourth year, which would be based on the earnings from year 3 to 4.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to compute the growth rate from year 3 to 4, which is 10.37%, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the growth rate during the fourth year, which is the rate at the end of year 4 relative to the end of year 3. So the growth rate would be (E(4) - E(3))/E(3) *100.

So, let's compute that:

E(4) = 20, E(3)=18.14

(20-18.14)/18.14 = 1.86/18.14 ≈ 0.1025 → 10.25% growth over four years. So the annualized growth rate would be the 4th root of (1.1025) minus 1, but that's probably not necessary. Alternatively, for the four-year period, the growth is 10.25%, so the annual growth rate would be (1.1025)^(1/4) -1.

Let me compute that: 1.1025 to the power of 1/4. Let's take the natural log: ln(1.1025)= approx 0.0998. Divided by 4 gives about 0.02495. Exponentiating gives e^0.02495 ≈ 1.02525. So the annual growth rate is 2.525%, approximately 2.53%, which is about 2.5%. Looking back at the options, option B is 2.50%, which is 2.5%. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the company's earnings growth rate as a percentage after four years, meaning the rate at the end of the fourth year compared to the start. But without knowing E(0), that's not possible. So I think the correct approach is to calculate the growth from the end of year 3 to 4, which is the four-year period.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's the growth rate in the fourth year, which would be based on the earnings at the end of the fourth year, relative to the end of the third year. So that's the same as I calculated, 10.25% over four years, but the annualized growth rate would be (1.1025)^(1/4) -1, which is about 2.53%, so 2.5%. Looking at the options, option B is 2.50%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years. Let me compute that: the earnings from year 0 to 4. But since we don't know E(0), that's impossible. So the correct approach is to compute the growth rate from the end of year 3 to 4. So, the answer would be approximately 2.53%, so option B (2.50%). Alternatively, perhaps I should compute E(4) and E(0), but without E(0), it's impossible. So the correct calculation is the growth rate from 3 to 4, which is 10.25% over four years. The annual growth rate would be the fourth root of 1.1025 minus 1. Let me compute that accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the growth rate from t=0 to t=4. But since E(0) is not given, I can't compute it. So the only feasible approach is to compute the growth from year 3 to 4.

Let me recheck the calculations:

E(3) = sqrt(10*(9) +3 +236) = sqrt(90 +3 +236)=sqrt(329)≈18.14

E(4)=sqrt(160 +4 +236)=sqrt(400)=20.

So E(4)/E(3) =20/18.14≈1.1037. So the growth is 10.37% over four years.

But the question is about the annual rate of growth after four years. Wait, perhaps it's the growth rate at the end of the fourth year, which is (E(4)-E(3))/E(3) *100. So that's (20-18.14)/18.14 *100 = (1.86)/18.14 *100 ≈10.25%.

Wait, but that's the growth over four years, not an annualized rate. The question is asking for the annual rate of growth after four years. Hmm, perhaps they're considering the growth rate in the fourth year, which is the rate from year 3 to 4, which is 10.25%, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the growth rate at the end of the fourth year relative to the beginning. But since E(0) isn't known, that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says "annual rate of growth of earnings after four years." So, perhaps it's the growth rate in the fourth year, which would be the difference between E(4) and E(3) divided by E(3). So, it's (20-18.14)/18.14 ≈10.25%. But 10.25% is approximately 10%, but looking at the options, the closest is 2.5% (option B). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 10% would be way higher than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the E(3) and E(4):

E(3)=sqrt(10*(3)^2 +3 +236) = sqrt(90 +3 +236)=sqrt(329). Let me compute sqrt(329) exactly. 18^2 is 324, 19^2 is 361. So 18.14 squared: 18*18=324, 0.14^2 is about 0.0196, and the cross terms 2*18*0.14=5.04. So (18 + 0.14)^2 = 324 +5.04 +0.0196 ≈ 329.0596. So sqrt(329) is approximately 18.14.

So E(3)=18.14, E(4)=20. So the growth from 3 to 4 is 20-18.14=1.86. So 1.86/18.14 is approximately 0.1025, which is 10.25%. So the annualized rate would be 10.25^(1/4) -1.

Calculating 10.25 to the 1/4. Let's take natural logs. ln(10.25)= approx 2.323. Divide by 4: 0.5808. Exponentiating e^0.5808≈1.784. So 1.784-1=0.784, which is 78.4%. Wait, that can't be right because that's a higher percentage than any of the options. So perhaps I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute 1.1025^(1/4). Let me compute 1.1025 once. The fourth root of 1.1025 is approximately 1.025 (since (1.025)^4 ≈1.103). So the annualized growth rate would be about 2.5%. So option B. So that's how that works.

Wait, but the question is about the annual rate after four years. Maybe the question is asking for the annualized growth rate from the end of year 3 to 4, which is 10.25% over four years. The annualized rate is the fourth root of (1 + growth over four years). So 1.1025^(1/4) -1 ≈1.025 -1=0.025=2.5%. So the answer is 2.5%, which is option B.

To determine the annual rate of growth of earnings after four years, we calculate the earnings at the end of year 3 (E(3)) and year 4 (E(4)) using the given formula:

\[
E(t) = \sqrt{10t^2 + t + 236}
\]

1. **Calculate E(3):**
   \[
   E(3) = \sqrt{10(3)^2 + 3 + 236} = \sqrt{90 + 3 + 236} = \sqrt{329} \approx 18.14 \text{ thousand dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate E(4):**
   \[
   E(4) = \sqrt{10(4)^2 + 4 + 236} = \sqrt{160 + 4 + 236} = \sqrt{400} = 20.00 \text{ thousand dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the growth rate over the four-year period:**
   The earnings grow from 18.14 thousand to 20.00 thousand over four years, resulting in a growth factor of:
   \[
   \frac{20}{18.14} \approx 1.1037
   \]
   The growth rate over the four-year period is:
   \[
   (1.1037 - 1) \times 100 \approx 10.37\%
   \]

4. **Calculate the annualized growth rate:**
   To find the annualized growth rate, we take the fourth root of the growth factor (1.1037) and subtract 1:
   \[
   \left(1.1037\right)^{1/4} - 1 \approx 1.025 - 1 = 0.025 \text{ or } 2.5\%
   \]

Thus, the annual rate of growth of earnings after four years is **2.50%**, which corresponds to option **B**.
