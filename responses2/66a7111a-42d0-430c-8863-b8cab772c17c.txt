Okay, so I have this question about the boundary between the United States and Mexico, and I need to figure out what it's an example of. The options are various types of boundaries, so I need to think about each one.

First, the question mentions the Rio Grande. I know the Rio Grande flows through Mexico and connects to the United States. It's a major river that acts as a natural boundary between the two countries. Wait, but the options include things like forest, desert, man-made canals, etc.

Let me go through each option step by step. 

Option A: Forest boundary. The Rio Grande isn't a forest. It's a river, so this doesn't fit.

Option B: Desert boundary. No, it's a river, not an desert. So B is out.

Option C: Artificial boundary. The Rio Grande is natural; it's formed by the Earth's geological activity, like sediment and erosion. So artificial boundaries are made by humans, not natural features. So C is not it.

Option D: Man-made canal. The Rio Grande is a river, not a canal. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Continental divide. A continental divide is a line that runs north-south through countries, separating the eastern part of a continent from the western part. The Rio Grande is a major waterway, but I think it's more about dividing landmasses, not just a divide between two countries. Plus, the question is about a boundary between the two states, which is a river, not a divide between two continents.

Option F: Mountain range. The Rio Grande is a river, so F is not right.

Option G: Natural boundary. This one sounds promising. The Rio Grande is a natural barrier that separates Mexico from the United States. It's formed by the river's natural course, not by human intervention. So G seems to fit.

Option H: Water divider. A water divider is a line that uses water to separate two areas, like a dam or a river. The Rio Grande is a river, not a divider. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Ocean boundary. The Rio Grande isn't an ocean. It's a body of water in the Atlantic Ocean, but it's not an ocean boundary in the sense that it splits two parts of the ocean. So I is not the right answer.

Putting it all together, the Rio Grande is an example of a natural boundary. So the correct answer should be G.

The Rio Grande is an example of a natural boundary between the United States and Mexico. 

Answer: G
