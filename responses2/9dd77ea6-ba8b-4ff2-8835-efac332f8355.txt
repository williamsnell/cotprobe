Okay, so I have this question about amino acids and their ionic forms based on pH. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me two pH values: 4-9, and then asks about 12 and 2. The options are A to H, each with different predictions about the predominant ionic form. The options also mention whether certain forms can or cannot predominate.

I remember that amino acids, especially the ones involved here, are in their zwitterionic form when the pH is around 6-7. For example, in the case of lysine, the structure is H2NCH2CH9COOH, but when it's zwitterionic, it has two positive charges. Wait, no, wait: zwitterionic forms usually have two or three ionizable groups. Like lysine is H2NCH2CH9COOH, but in zwitterionic form, it's H2NCH2CH9COO^- H+ ? Or wait, when it's in a zwitterionic state, the molecule has two acidic groups. So, for lysine, the zwitterion would have the carboxylate and amine groups as the two charged parts. So, in this case, the molecule would have a positive charge at pH 6 and negative at pH 8.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let's clarify: the pH at which a molecule has a zwitterionic form is determined by the pKa values of the functional groups. For lysine, the carboxyl group has a pKa around 2.3, and the amino group around 9.6. So, when pH is between 2.3 and 9.6, the molecule has both the carboxylate and amino groups as protonated. So it's a zwitterion. That's correct.

So, when the pH is below the pKa of the carboxyl group (pKa about 2.3), then the carboxyl group is deprotonated, so the amino group is protonated. So the molecule would have a positive charge (since the amino group is positive). At pH above 9.6, the amino group is deprotonated, the carboxyl is protonated, so the molecule has a negative charge.

So, in the question, the first part is about pH 4-9. Let's see: the options are about 12 and 2.

At pH 12, which is way above the pKa of the carboxyl group (2.3). So, in that case, the carboxyl group is protonated (so it's a positive charge), and the amino group is deprotonated (so negative). So the molecule would have a negative charge.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. The molecule isn't in the ionized form. Wait, no, the question is about the predominant ionic form. So, when the molecule is in solution, depending on pH, it can exist as either an ion or as a zwitterion. Or, more accurately, the molecule can be protonated or deprotonated, but the predominant form depends on the pH.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. For the neutral molecule, when it's in solution, it can lose or gain a proton, becoming either positively or negatively charged. The predominant form depends on where the pH is relative to the pKa of the acidic groups.

So, when the pH is higher than the pKa of a group, that group is protonated, giving a higher charge. So, for lysine, in its zwitterionic form, the amino group is positive, and the carboxyl is negative. So, the molecule has a net charge of (positive) minus (negative) which is overall negative.

Wait, but the question is about the predominant ionic form. So, for example, at high pH (like 12), the molecule would have the amino group deprotonated and the carboxyl group protonated, leading to a net negative charge.

So, the molecule would be in the zwitterionic form with a negative charge (H2NCHZCO2^- ). But wait, the question states the options are about the predominant form. So, the options may refer to whether the molecule is in a charged form or the neutral zwitterion.

Wait, the options are about whether H2NCHZCO2H (zwitterionic, positive) or H2NCHZCO2^- (zwitterionic, negative) exists more. So, for pH greater than the pKa of the carboxyl group (like 12), the molecule would be in a state where the carboxyl group is positive and the amino is negative. So, the molecule's charge would be (positive + negative). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The molecule has two acidic groups. At high pH, the carboxyl group (pKa 2.3) is protonated, so it has a positive charge. The amino group (pKa 9.6) is deprotonated, so it has a negative charge. So, the overall charge would be (positive) + (negative) = net negative. So the molecule is in a zwitterionic form with a negative charge.

But the options are about which ionic form is predominant. So, the molecule would have a net negative charge when in zwitterionic form, but the question is about whether it's H2NCHZCO2H (positive) or H2NCHZCO2^- (negative) as the predominant form.

Wait, but wait—the neutral molecule can't really change form to be in a particular charge. So, when the pH is high, the molecule is in a zwitterionic form, but the charge is negative. So, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

Wait, but the first part of the question is at pH 12. So the options are about whether the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^- or H2NCHZCO2H.

Wait, but the molecule can't be both. Hmm. Maybe the options are not about the molecule being protonated or deprotonated, but about the form it takes as it's in a particular charge. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the question is about whether the molecule is in a charged form or the neutral zwitterion.

So, for pH 12, the molecule is in a zwitterionic state with a negative charge. So, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

But wait, the options say at pH 12, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant, which is the protonated zwitterion. So that would be incorrect. So the correct form for pH 12 is H2NCHZCO2^-.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are about whether H2NCHZCO2H or H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

Wait, the options also say whether the molecule can predominate in the neutral form, or prefers a particular charge. So, I'm a bit confused about the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: At pH 12, H^+_3HCHZCO_2H predominates. That's the neutral molecule with a positive charge, which doesn't make sense. Because at high pH, it's protonated.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Wait, the options are about whether the predominant form is the protonated (H2NCHZCO2 H) or deprotonated (H2NCHZCO2^-), or if the neutral form can be predominant.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as: "At pH = 12, H_2NCHZCO_2H predominates. At pH =2, H_2NCHZCO_2H predominates. H_2NCHZCO_2^- can sometimes predominate."

Wait, but at pH 12, the molecule would be protonated (positive charge), so H2NCHZCO2 H would be predominant. At pH 2, the molecule would be deprotonated (negative), so H2NCHZCO2^- would be predominant. But some options say that H2NCHZCO2^- can sometimes predominate.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the options are about whether the predominant form is the neutral zwitterion or the charged form.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about which form (charged or neutral) is more prevalent. So, for each pH, the predominant form is either H2NCHZCO2H (protonated) or H2NCHZCO2^- (deprotonated).

So, for pH 12:

At pH 12, which is above the pKa of the carboxyl (2.3), the carboxyl group is protonated, so the molecule is protonated (H2NCHZCO2 H) and the amino group is deprotonated (H2NCHZCO2^-). So the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2 H.

At pH 2, the amino group is deprotonated (since its pKa is 9.6), so the molecule is deprotonated (H2NCHZCO2^-). So the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

But wait, the options are a bit more complex. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option A: At pH 12, H_2NCHZCO_2H predominates. At pH 2, H_2NCHZCO_2H predominates. H_2NCHZCO_2^- can sometimes predominate.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because at pH 12, the molecule should be protonated (so H2NCHZCO2 H is the predominant form. So option A's first part is correct, but the second part says at pH 2, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant. But at pH 2, the molecule is deprotonated (H2NCHZCO2^-), so H2NCHZCO2H would be the neutral form, which is the conjugate base. So, the neutral form (H2NCHZCO2^-) would be predominant.

Wait, but the options don't all match that. Let me look for each option's predictions.

Option B: At pH 12, H2NCHZCO2H predominates. At pH 2, H+3HCHZCO2H predominates. H2NCHZCO2^- can always predominate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach is to recall that the predominant form at any pH is the one with the highest charge. So, for each pH:

At pH 4-9: the molecule's zwitterionic form is predominant with both groups charged.

At pH 12: carboxyl group is protonated, amino group deprotonated, so the molecule has a negative charge. So, the predominant form is the neutral one, which is H2NCHZCO2^-.

At pH 2: amino group is deprotonated, so the molecule is in the zwitterionic form with a negative charge. So, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

Wait, but wait, no, the neutral zwitterion is H2NCHZCO2^- and the protons are in the molecule as H2NCHZCO2 H.

So, the neutral form is the H2NCHZCO2^- ion, which is H+ in the solution.

At pH 12, the molecule is protonated, so the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2 H.

At pH 2, the molecule is deprotonated, so predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

So, looking at the options, which one matches this.

Looking at options, which ones state that at pH 12, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2 H, and at pH 2, it's H2NCHZCO2^-.

Which option is that? Let me check.

Option A: At pH=12: H_2NCHZCO2H, at pH=2: H_2NCHZCO2H. But at pH=2, the predominant form should be H_2NCHZCO2^-.

Option B: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H. At pH=2, H+3HCHZCO2H. So, the second part is the protonated form, which would be the neutral form, not the deprotonated. So, B is incorrect.

Option C: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H. At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. Both are protonated. But at pH 2, the predominant form should be H2NCHZCO2^-.

Option D: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- (neutral form). But the second part says H2NCHZCO2H, which is the protonated form. So D's second part is wrong.

Option E: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. But at pH=2, it should be deprotonated.

Option F: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. So, the first part is correct, the second is wrong.

Option G: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2H. At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2^- (so, the neutral form). So, the first part is correct, the second is correct. But the third part says H2NCHZCO2H can always predominate. But at pH=2, it should be deprotonated, so the neutral form (H2NCHZCO2^-) is predominant. So, G's third part is incorrect.

Option H: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2H. At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2^- (neutral form). So, first part correct, second part correct. Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can never predominate. But at pH=2, the neutral form is predominant. So, H is incorrect.

Option I: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2^- (neutral, but would that be correct?), wait no. At pH=12, the molecule is protonated, so the neutral form (H2NCHZCO2^-) is the predominant form. Wait, but the first part of option I says H2NCHZCO2^- which is the neutral form. So that's correct.

At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2^- (so, the neutral form). So, this would be correct for both pH's.

But option I says at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant. But wait, that's the neutral form, so the correct answer for pH=2 would be the neutral form.

But in the options, option I says both at pH=12 and 2, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant. Wait, that would be correct for pH=12 but not for pH=2. Because at pH=2, the molecule is deprotonated (H2NCHZCO2^-).

So, option I is H2NCHZCO2^- at 12, and H2NCHZCO2^- at 2. But that's not correct for pH=2.

Wait, which of the options is correct for both pH 4-9 and pH 12 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think of this with another approach.

For pH 4-9, the molecule is in a zwitterionic form: H2NCHZCO2^- (neutral) and H2NCHZCO2 H (protonated). So, the predominant form is neutral (H2NCHZCO2^-).

But wait, the question is about the predominant form at pH 4-9, but perhaps some options don't match that.

Wait, no, the question's options are about which form is predominant at each pH.

So, for pH 12, the molecule is protonated (H2NCHZCO2 H) and the neutral form isn't the dominant. So, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2 H.

For pH 2, the molecule is deprotonated (H2NCHZCO2^-) and the neutral form is predominant.

So, looking for which option says that at pH 12, H2NCHZCO2 H is predominant, and at pH 2, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. But at pH=2, the predominant should be H2NCHZCO2^-. So A is incorrect.

Option B: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H; at pH=2, H+3HCHZCO2H. So, at pH=2, the predominant form is protonated (H2NCHZCO2H), but that's when the solution is H+3, but the molecule would be deprotonated. So B is incorrect.

Option C: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. But at pH=2, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

Option D: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- (the neutral form is predominant). At pH=2, the molecule is deprotonated, so the neutral form (H2NCHZCO2^-) is predominant. So this option's statements about pH 2 are correct.

But what about pH 12: the option D says at pH 12, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant. That's correct because at pH 12, the molecule is protonated, so the neutral form is predominant.

So, for pH 4-9, the molecule is in a zwitterionic form, so the predominant form is neutral (H2NCHZCO2^-). At pH=12, the molecule is protonated, so H2NCHZCO2 H is predominant.

At pH=2, the molecule is deprotonated, so H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

So, looking for an option that states for pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant, and for pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. (Both are protonated) → Incorrect, because at pH=2, it's deprotonated.

Option B: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H; at pH=2, H+3HCHZCO2H → (protonated), which is wrong at pH=2.

Option C: Both are protonated → No.

Option D: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- → (correct for both).

Option E: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. → No, because at pH=2, the neutral form is predominant.

Option F: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. → At pH=2, it's the protonated form, which is wrong.

Option G: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- → (correct for pH=2), but incorrect for pH=12.

Option H: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- → (correct for both), but the third part says H2NCHZCO2H can never predominate. Wait, but at pH=2, it's deprotonated, so it's the neutral form. So, the third part is incorrect.

So, looking for the option that correctly states that at pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant, and at pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

Looking through the options:

Option D says at pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant. (Incorrect, because at pH=12, it's protonated.)

Option B says at pH=2, the protonated form. (Incorrect.)

Option D is not correct. So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read each one carefully.

Option A: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant. H2NCHZCO2H is the neutral molecule. So, at pH=12, the molecule is protonated, so H2NCHZCO2 H is the predominant form. At pH=2, the molecule is deprotonated, so the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

So, option A's first part is correct, second part is correct. But the third part is wrong.

Option B: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2H; At pH=2: H+3HCHZCO2H. So, at pH=2, the protonated form is predominant. But that's incorrect because at pH=2, the molecule is deprotonated.

Option C: Both parts are H2NCHZCO2H → incorrect.

Option D: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2^- → correct for both. But the third part says H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. At pH=2, the neutral form is predominant, so the third part is incorrect.

Option E: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2H. → At pH=2, it's the protonated form, which is incorrect.

Option F: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2H. → At pH=2, it's the protonated form, which is incorrect.

Option G: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2H; At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct for both. Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. But at pH=12, the molecule is protonated. So, the third part is incorrect.

Option H: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2: H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. But at pH=2, it's deprotonated, so H2NCHZCO2H is the protonated form. So, the third part is incorrect.

Wait, so which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the options.

Let me think about each option in terms of whether the statements about the predominant forms are correct.

Option A: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant. (Correct, because at pH=12, it's protonated.) At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant. (Incorrect, because at pH=2, it's deprotonated.)

So, option A is incorrect.

Option B: At pH=12: H2NCHZCO2H; At pH=2: H+3HCHZCO2H. → At pH=2, it's protonated (H+3H), but at pH=2, it's deprotonated.

So, option B is incorrect.

Option C: Both parts are H2NCHZCO2H → Incorrect.

Option D: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. So, D's first and second parts are correct.

Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. At pH=2, the neutral form is predominant, so this part is incorrect.

So, D is partially correct but the third part is wrong.

Option E: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. → At pH=2, it's correct (neutral form). At pH=12, incorrect.

Option F: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2H. → At pH=2, it's incorrect.

Option G: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2H; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct for both. Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate → At pH=12, the molecule is protonated, so the neutral form is predominant. So, third part is incorrect.

Option H: At pH=12, H2NCHZCO2^-; At pH=2, H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate → At pH=2, the molecule is deprotonated, so H2NCHZCO2H is predominant. So, third part is incorrect.

Wait, so none of the options are entirely correct. But that's impossible. So, perhaps I'm missing some key point.

Wait a moment, perhaps the options are not about the same pH's.

Wait, the options describe what happens at two pH values: 4-9 and 12.

So, for each option, when the pH is 4-9, what is the predominant form, and when the pH is 12, what is the predominant form.

So, let's check each option.

Option A: At 12: H2NCHZCO2H; At 2: H2NCHZCO2H. → Both are protonated. So, correct only for pH=12. At pH=2, it's the neutral form, so incorrect.

Option B: At 12: H2NCHZCO2H; At 2: H+3HCHZCO2H. → At 2, it's protonated (H+3H), but it's deprotonated, so incorrect.

Option C: At 12: H2NCHZCO2H; At 2: H2NCHZCO2H. → Both are protonated. At 2, it's neutral. Incorrect.

Option D: At 12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At 2: H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. At 12, the molecule is protonated (H2NCHZCO2H is the neutral form). So, D's third part is incorrect.

Option E: At 12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At 2: H2NCHZCO2H. → At 2, it's correct, but at 12, it's wrong.

Option F: At 12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At 2: H2NCHZCO2H. → At 2, it's wrong.

Option G: At 12: H2NCHZCO2H; At 2: H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. At 12, the molecule is protonated. At 2, it's deprotonated. Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. At 12, it's the neutral form, so third part incorrect.

Option H: At 12: H2NCHZCO2^-; At 2: H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. Third part: H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. At 2, it's deprotonated, so H2NCHZCO2H is predominant. So, third part is incorrect.

Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the confusion is elsewhere. Let me think again.

At pH 12, the molecule is protonated, so the neutral form (H2NCHZCO2^-) is predominant. At pH 2, the molecule is deprotonated, so the neutral form (H2NCHZCO2^-) is predominant.

So, the correct descriptions are:

At pH 12: H2NCHZCO2 H (protonated) is predominant? No. At pH 12, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

At pH 2: H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

Looking for an option that says at pH 12, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant, and at pH 2, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant.

But no option does that. Hmm. Let me read the options again.

Wait, option G says at pH 12, H2NCHZCO2H is predominant; at pH 2, H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. So, option G is correct for both pH's. But its third part says H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. That is incorrect, because at pH 2, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^-.

So, the third part is incorrect for option G.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is option D? No. Wait, option D says at pH 12, H2NCHZCO2^- is predominant; at pH 2, H2NCHZCO2^- → Correct. But the third part says H2NCHZCO2H can't predominate. That's incorrect because at pH 12, the predominant form is neutral.

So, perhaps the correct option is option G. Because the first and second parts are correct. But the third part is incorrect. But the question is about the correct statements, not the third part.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is elsewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct options are G, because both first and second parts are correct, and the third part is incorrect, but the question is about the correct statements about the predominant forms.

But I'm supposed to choose the option that correctly describes the statements about the predominant forms.

So, given that, perhaps option G is incorrect because the third part is wrong, but the first and second parts are correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the correct statements about the predominant forms, regardless of the third part.

So, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each option in terms of whether it correctly describes the predominant forms at each pH.

Option A: At 12, H2NCHZCO2H (correct), At 2, H2NCHZCO2H (incorrect).

Option B: At 12, H2NCHZCO2H (correct), At 2, H2NCHZCO2H (incorrect).

Option C: At 12, H2NCHZCO2H (correct), At 2, H2NCHZCO2H (incorrect).

Option D: At 12, H2NCHZCO2^- (correct), At 2, H2NCHZCO2^- (correct).

Option E: At 12, H2NCHZCO2^- (correct), At 2, H2NCHZCO2H (incorrect).

Option F: Same as E.

Option G: At 12, H2NCHZCO2H (correct), At 2, H2NCHZCO2^- (correct).

Option H: Same as G.

So, in this analysis, the correct options are D and G, because at their respective pH's, the predominant forms are correct. But their third parts are incorrect.

But the question is about which option correctly describes the statements about the predominant forms, regardless of the third part being incorrect.

So, perhaps the intended correct option is D, but that's incorrect because at pH 12, the third part is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is elsewhere. Let me think.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in considering the options.

Wait, perhaps for option G, the first part is correct, the second part is correct, but the third part is incorrect.

But the question is asking about the statements about the predominant forms, so as long as the first and second parts are correct, the third part doesn't matter.

So, in that case, option G is correct because at pH 12, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2H (neutral form, which is correct), and at pH 2, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2^- (neutral form, correct). But the third part is about the protonated form, which is incorrect in both cases.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps some of them have correct statements about the predominant forms.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is G, because it correctly states that at pH 12, the predominant form is H2NCHZCO2H (neutral form), and at pH 2, it is H2NCHZCO2^- (neutral form). So, the first two parts are correct, and the third part is incorrect, but the question is about the statements, so the correctness is based on the first and second parts.

So, the correct option is G.

So, the answer is option G.
</think>

The correct answer is **G**. Here's the reasoning:

At pH 12, the molecule is protonated (H₂NCHZCO₂H is the neutral form), and the predominant form is the neutral form (H₂NCHZCO₂⁻). At pH 2, the molecule is deprotonated (H₂NCHZCO₂⁻ is the neutral form), and the predominant form is the neutral form (H₂NCHZCO₂⁻). However, the third part of option G states that the protonated form (H₂NCHZCO₂H) can't predominate, which is incorrect at both pHs. Thus, option G correctly describes the predominant forms at both pHs, despite the incorrect third part.

ANSWER: G
