Okay, so I've got this question about the angular resolution of telescopes. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the theoretical limit for telescopes with diameters of 100 mm, 1 m, and 5 m, using a wavelength of 550 nm. The options are A to J, each giving different values for each diameter.

Wait, I remember the formula for the minimum angular resolution, which is the diffraction limit. Oh right, it's called the Rayleigh criterion. The formula is θ ≈ 1.22 λ / D, where θ is the angular resolution in radians, λ is the wavelength, and D is the diameter of the telescope's objective. Oh wait, sometimes it's approximated as 1.22, but I think it's actually 1.22 or sometimes just 1.2 or 2.4? Wait, no, I think 1.22 is the standard factor from the He-Ne laser experiments. So yeah, the formula is θ ≈ 1.22 * (wavelength in vacuum) / diameter.

So the problem gives λ as 550 nm, which is 550e-9 meters. Let me compute this for each diameter.

First, for D = 100 mm. Wait, wait, the diameter is given in mm, but the wavelength is in meters. I need to convert units. 100 mm is 0.1 meters. So θ = 1.22 * (550e-9) / 0.1.

Let me compute that. 550e-9 is 5.5e-7 meters. 1.22 * 5.5e-7 = 6.71e-7. Then divide by 0.1, which is 1e-1. So 6.71e-7 / 1e-1 = 6.71e-6 radians. So for D=100mm, θ is 6.71e-6 rad.

Next, D = 1 m. 1 m is 1.0e-3 meters. So 1.22 * 550e-9 / (1e-3). Let's calculate 550e-9 is 5.5e-7. 1.22 * 5.5e-7 = 6.71e-7. Divided by 1e-3 is 6.71e-4 radians. Wait, 6.71e-4 is 6.71 × 10^-4, which is 0.000671 rad. But looking at the options, let me check each option.

Wait, looking at the options provided, I see option B has D=100mm as 6.71e-6, 1m as 6.71e-7, and 5m as 1.34e-7. Wait, but according to my calculation, 1m would be 6.71e-4, which is 6.71 × 10^-4 rad, but the options for 1m are 6.71e-7. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the unit conversion. Let me double-check. The diameter in D is 100 mm, which is 0.1 meters. So the formula is θ = (1.22 * 550e-9) / D. So 1.22 * 550e-9 = 671e-9. So 671e-9 / 0.1 = 671e-8 = 6.71e-6 rad. That's correct for 100mm.

For 1m, D is 1.0 meters. So 671e-9 / 1.0 = 671e-9 = 6.71e-7 rad. Now I see, so 1m gives θ=6.71e-7 rad. But wait, the options for D=1m are 6.71e-7. Oh wait, looking at the options, option B says for D=1m it's 6.71e-7, but for D=5m, it's 1.34e-7.

Wait, but according to the calculation, for D=5m, D=5 meters, so θ=1.22 * 550e-9 / (5e-3). Let's calculate that. 550e-9 is 5.5e-7. 1.22 * 5.5e-7 is 6.71e-7. Divided by 5e-3 (0.005) is 6.71e-7 / 5e-3 = 1.342e-4, which is 1.34e-4. Wait, but the options say D=5m is 1.34e-7. That's a big discrepancy. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units for the diameter. Let me check the diameter again. D=5m is 5,000 mm. Oh wait, no, 5m is 5000 mm. So for D=100 mm, 0.1 m, D=1m, 1 m, D=5m, 5 m.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation for D=5m. So let's recalculate:

For D=5 m, D is 5 meters. So 1.22 * 550e-9 m / 5 m = (1.22 * 550e-9) /5.

1.22 * 550e-9 = 671e-9. Divide by 5, gives 134.2e-9, which is 1.342e-7 radians. Oh wait, so the option for D=5m is 1.34e-7, which matches this. So earlier I thought option B says 1.34e-7, but according to the calculation, it's 1.34e-7. So that seems correct.

So let's map out all the values.

For D=100 mm (0.1 m):

θ = 1.22 * 550e-9 / 0.1 = (1.22 * 550e-9) / 0.1 = 671e-9 / 0.1 = 6.71e-6 rad.

For D=1 m:

θ=1.22 *550e-9 /1 = 671e-9 /1 = 6.71e-7 rad.

Wait, but in the options, option B says D=1m is 6.71e-7. That's correct.

For D=5 m:

θ=1.22 *550e-9 /5 = (1.22 *550e-9) is 671e-9, divided by 5 is 134.2e-9, which is 1.34e-7 rad.

So the calculated values are for each diameter:

100 mm: 6.71e-6 rad

1 m: 6.71e-7 rad

5 m: 1.34e-7 rad.

Looking at the options, option B matches:

A: 5.71e-6, 5.71e-7, 0.134e-7 → No.

B: 6.71e-6,6.71e-7,1.34e-7 → Yes.

Wait, but the options for B are:

B: 6.71e-6 for 100mm, 6.71e-7 for 1m, 1.34e-7 for 5m.

Which is exactly what I got. So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, let me check the options again. Looking at the options, each option has three values, for the three diameters. So the first option (A) is for 100mm: 5.71e-6, 1m:5.71e-7, 5m:0.134e-7. Hmm, but 0.134e-7 is 1.34e-8, which is way too small. So I think the correct answer is option B.

To determine the theoretical limit on angular resolution for telescopes with objective diameters of 100 mm, 1 m, and 5 m, using a wavelength of 550 nm, the Rayleigh criterion formula is applied:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{1.22 \cdot \lambda}{D}
\]

where:
- \(\theta\) is the angular resolution in radians,
- \(\lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\),
- \(D\) is the diameter of the telescope's objective in meters.

### Calculations:
1. **For \(D = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m}\):**
   \[
   \theta = \frac{1.22 \cdot 550 \times 10^{-9}}{0.1} = \frac{671 \times 10^{-9}}{0.1} = 6.71 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{rad}.
   \]

2. **For \(D = 1 \, \text{m}\):**
   \[
   \theta = \frac{1.22 \cdot 550 \times 10^{-9}}{1} = \frac{671 \times 10^{-9}}{1} = 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad}.
   \]

3. **For \(D = 5 \, \text{m}\):**
   \[
   \theta = \frac{1.22 \cdot 550 \times 10^{-9}}{5} = \frac{671 \times 10^{-9}}{5} = 1.34 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option B** provides:
  - \(D = 100 \, \text{mm}\): \(6.71 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{rad}\),
  - \(D = 1 \, \text{m}\): \(6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad}\),
  - \(D = 5 \, \text{m}\): \(1.34 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad}\).

This matches the calculated values exactly.
