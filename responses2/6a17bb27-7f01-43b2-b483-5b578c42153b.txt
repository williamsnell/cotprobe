Okay, so I've got this question about thermal expansion. Let me try to think it through. The question is about an iron pipe's length change when heated from 0°C to 100°C. The pipe is 200 feet long at 0°C, and I need to find how much it increases when heated. The coefficient of linear expansion is given as alpha equals 10 times 10 to the sixth power per degree Celsius. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the formulas, but I remember that the change in length due to thermal expansion is calculated using Delta L equals alpha multiplied by the original length (L) multiplied by the change in temperature (Delta T). So the formula is ΔL = α * L * ΔT.

Let me write that down. So, ΔL = α * L * (T2 - T1), where T1 is the initial temperature and T2 is the final. The initial temperature is 0°C, and heating it to 100°C, so ΔT is 100 - 0 = 100°C.

Now, plugging in the values. The original length L is 200 ft, alpha is 10 × 10^6 per °C. So, let me calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate alpha: 10 x 10^6 is 10,000,000 per degree. Then, multiply by L: 10,000,000 * 200. Let's see, 10 million times 200 is 2,000,000,000. Then multiply by ΔT, which is 100. So 2,000,000,000 * 100 = 200,000,000,000.

Wait, but wait a second, that seems really large. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, that's correct. Because each degree of expansion leads to a big number. Because the coefficient is 10^6, which is a huge number.

Wait, but the answer options are in feet. Let me think about the units. The coefficient is per degree Celsius, so 10^6 per degree. So 10^6 = 1e6. So 1e6 * 200 = 2e8, then multiplied by 100 gives 2e10? Wait, no, 10e6 is 10^7? No, wait: 10 million is 10^7? Wait no, 10 million is 10^7? Wait 10 million is 10^7? Wait 1e6 is million. So 10 million is 1e7. So 1e7 * 200 is 2e9, then multiply by 100, which is 2e11? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 0.1 to 0.5 ft range.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo this.

Wait, alpha is 10^6 per degree. Oh, wait no! Wait, the coefficient is 10 x 10^6, which is 10 million per degree. So 1e7? Because 10 x 1e6 is 1e7. Oh right, so 1e7 per degree.

So calculations:

ΔL = 1e7 * 200 * 100.

Wait, 1e7 is 10 million. 10 million * 200 is 2e9 (2 billion). Then multiplied by 100 gives 2e11. Wait, that's way too big. That's 200 billion feet. Which is impossible because the options are in 0.1 to 0.5 ft. So I must have messed up the numbers. 

Wait, wait. Let me check the units again. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the coefficient is 10 x 10^6. Oh wait, 10 x 10^6 is 1e7, which is correct. But wait, wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Wait, no. The formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused the coefficient's unit. Wait, the coefficient is 10 x 10^6 per degree Celsius. Oh, wait, 10^6 is million. So 10 million per degree. So, 1e7 per degree. So that's correct.

But if the calculations don't match the options, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the value of alpha is 12 x 10^6? Because I remember that for iron, the linear expansion coefficient is around 12 x 10^-6 per degree Celsius. Wait, wait, no, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 10 x 10^6 is 1e7. Oh wait, 10^6 is million. So 1e7 is 10 million. So 10 million is correct.

But according to that, the calculation gives 2e11 ft, which is way too large. So perhaps the given alpha is incorrect. Or perhaps I have a misinterpretation of the question.

Wait, the problem statement says "alpha = 10 x 10^6 per degree Celsius." So that's 1e7.

Wait, but wait, let me check the formula again. The change in length is alpha * L * delta T. So 1e7 * 200 * 100.

Wait, 1e7 is 10^7. So 10^7 * 200 = 2e9, then multiplied by 100 is 2e11.

Wait, that's 200 billion feet. That's impossible, because 1 foot is 12 inches, which is 0.3048 meters. But the options are in feet, so 200 billion feet is way too big. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the exponent. Oh, wait, perhaps alpha is 12 x 10^-6, which is a more reasonable value for iron.

Wait, if alpha is 12e-6 per degree, then let's recalculate.

So alpha=12e-6. Then, 12e-6 * 200 * 100 = 12e-6 * 20000 = 12 * 20000 * 1e-6.

Wait, 20000 is 2e4, so 12 * 2e4 = 2.4e5. 2.4e5 * 1e-6 is 2.4e-1, which is 0.24 ft. Hmm, that's 0.24 feet. Looking at the options, E is 0.20, and I is 0.10. 0.24 is not exactly any of these, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the given value is 12 x10^6? No, that's way too high. Or perhaps it's 12 x 10^5? Because 1e5 is a big number too.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. The formula for linear expansion is delta L = alpha * L * delta T. Where alpha is the coefficient per degree.

So, let's think again. The problem states that alpha is 10 x 10^6 per degree, which is 1e7 per degree. Let me compute delta L again.

delta L = 1e7 * 200 ft * 100 °C.

So 1e7 times 200 is 2e9. Multiply by 100: 2e11 ft. That's 200 billion feet.

Which is way beyond any of the options, so I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, wait, the question says the pipe is 200 ft at 0°C. So 200 is the original length, correct.

Wait, perhaps the given alpha is 12e-6, which is 12 x 10^-6. Let's calculate that.

12e-6 is 0.000012 per degree.

So delta L = 0.000012 * 200 * 100.

0.000012 * 200 is 0.0024. Multiply by 100: 0.24 ft.

Hmm, 0.24 ft is approximately 0.20 ft (option E). But why is the option E 0.20 and my calculation gives 0.24 ft?

Wait, but perhaps I should check the value again.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, 10 x 10^6 is 1e7, correct.

So, 1e7 * 200 = 2e9.

2e9 * 100 = 2e11 ft.

That's 200,000,000,000 feet, which is way too large, but none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the given alpha is 12e-6, because 12x10^-6 is 0.000012, which is a more reasonable value for iron's linear expansion coefficient.

If alpha is 1.2e-5, that's 0.000012, which is 1.2e-5 per degree. Because 0.000012 is 1.2e-5.

Wait, let me try that. Alpha = 1.2e-5 per degree.

So delta L = 1.2e-5 * 200 ft * 100 °C.

1.2e-5 * 200 is 0.0024.

Multiply by 100: 0.24 ft.

So 0.24 ft, which is approximately 0.20 ft. So that would match option E: 0.20 ft.

Wait, but the question says alpha is 10 x 10^6. So that would make the delta L 200 billion feet, which is impossible. So perhaps the given alpha is 12e-6.

But the question says 10e6.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, 10 x 10^6 is 1e7, correct.

Wait, perhaps the given value is 12e-6? Because then delta L is 0.24 ft, which is near option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the given alpha as 10e6, but that would lead to an unreasonably large delta L, but maybe the options are incorrect or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for alpha. Let me think.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute the numbers again.

Wait, the change in length is delta L = alpha * L * delta T.

So, L = 200 ft.

alpha = 10e6 per degree C.

Wait, 10e6 is 10,000,000.

So 10,000,000 * 200 = 2,000,000,000.

Multiply by 100: 200,000,000,000.

That's 2e11 feet. So that's way too much. So none of the options fit. But the options don't include 2e11.

Wait, but perhaps the question is presented differently. Oh wait, perhaps the given alpha is 12e-6, which I believe is a more reasonable value for iron's alpha. Let's recalculate with that.

alpha = 12e-6.

delta L = 12e-6 * 200 * 100.

Compute that: 12e-6 is 0.000012.

0.000012 * 200 = 0.0024.

Multiply by 100: 0.24 ft.

So that's 0.24 ft, which is approximately 0.20 ft (option E). So that would be the correct answer if the alpha is 12e-6.

But the question says alpha is 10e6. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I misread it. Alternatively, perhaps the given alpha is 12e6, but no, that would make the change even larger.

Wait, another thought: 10e6 per degree is 1e7. But perhaps the question's coefficient is 12e-6, which I think is correct.

Hmmm. But the question says 10e6. So perhaps I should proceed with that value, but that leads to an impossible delta L. Or maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 10e6 is 10,000,000 per degree.

So delta L = 10,000,000 * 200 ft * 100.

Wait, 10,000,000 * 200 = 2,000,000,000.

Multiply by 100: 200,000,000,000 ft. That's 200 billion. That's way too big, but the options are in the 0.1 - 0.5 ft range. So that's impossible. So maybe the question's alpha is 12e-6 instead of 1e7.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed and see what the answer would be if the correct alpha is 1.2e-5.

Wait, 1.2e-5 is 0.000012 per degree.

So delta L = 0.000012 * 200 * 100.

0.000012 * 200 = 0.0024.

Multiply by 100: 0.24 ft, which is 24 inches or 2 feet 0.4 inches.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.20 ft, which is 2.4 inches. But 0.24 is closer to 0.20. So perhaps the intended answer is 0.20 ft. So the given alpha might be 12e-6, which is 0.000012, instead of 1e7.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended 12e-6. But the problem states 10e6.

Hmm. So perhaps I should proceed with the given alpha. But that would give an impossible answer. Or maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 10e6 is 10,000,000 per degree.

Multiply by 200 ft: 10,000,000 * 200 = 2,000,000,000.

Multiply by 100: 200,000,000,000 ft.

That's 2e11 ft. Which is 200 billion feet. That's way more than any of the options.

So perhaps the given alpha is 12e-6. So let me proceed with that.

12e-6 is 0.000012 per degree.

So delta L = 0.000012 * 200 * 100.

Compute 0.000012 * 200 = 0.0024.

Multiply by 100: 0.24 ft.

So the increase is 0.24 feet, which is approximately 0.20. So the answer would be option E: 0.20 ft.

But the question says the coefficient is 10e6. So perhaps the correct answer based on the given data is none of the options, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended value is 12e-6, which would give option E. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the linear expansion coefficient as (alpha), which is given in ft per foot per degree. Or perhaps I should think about the units more carefully.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. The change in length is in feet, so the calculation holds.

Wait, perhaps the given alpha is in a different unit. Let me double-check.

Wait, 10 x 10^6 is 1e7. So 1e7 per degree.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units. The coefficient is per degree Celsius, so the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. Suppose the given alpha is 12e-6.

So 12e-6 * 200 ft * 100 °C.

12e-6 * 200 = 0.0024.

0.0024 * 100 = 0.24 ft.

Which is 0.24 ft, so approximately 0.20 ft. So that's option E.

But the question gives alpha as 1e7, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the units. Oh! Wait, perhaps the given alpha is in the inverse of per degree, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the units are given incorrectly. For instance, if the coefficient is 12e-6 per degree, then the calculation would be correct.

But the question states alpha is 10e6. So perhaps the intended answer is 0.20 ft. So I'll proceed with that.

To calculate the change in length (ΔL) of the iron pipe due to thermal expansion, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:
- **α** is the linear expansion coefficient, given as \(10 \times 10^6\) per degree Celsius.
- **L** is the original length of the pipe, 200 ft.
- **ΔT** is the change in temperature, \(100 - 0 = 100\) °C.

### Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula
\[
\Delta L = (10 \times 10^6) \cdot 200 \cdot 100
\]

### Step 2: Perform the calculations
1. Multiply \(10 \times 10^6\) by 200:
   \[
   10 \times 10^6 \cdot 200 = 2 \times 10^9
   \]
2. Multiply the result by 100:
   \[
   2 \times 10^9 \cdot 100 = 2 \times 10^{11}
   \]

This gives an increase in length of \(2 \times 10^{11}\) ft, which is far beyond the options provided. This suggests a potential issue with the given value of α.

### Step 3: Adjust for a more reasonable α
Assuming the correct α is \(12 \times 10^{-6}\) per degree Celsius (a commonly used value for iron), recalculate:

\[
\Delta L = (12 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 200 \cdot 100
\]

1. Multiply \(12 \times 10^{-6}\) by 200:
   \[
   12 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 200 = 0.0024
   \]
2. Multiply the result by 100:
   \[
   0.0024 \cdot 100 = 0.24 \, \text{ft}
   \]

The closest option to this result is **E) 0.20 ft**.
