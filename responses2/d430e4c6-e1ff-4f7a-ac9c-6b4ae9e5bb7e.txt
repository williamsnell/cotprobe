Okay, so I have this question about finding the bandwidth of a frequency modulated (FM) signal. The question gives me the signal equation: v(t) = 10 cos(2 × 10^7 π t + 20 cos1000 π t). Hmm, I remember that the general form of an FM signal is something like v(t) = A cos( ω_c t + 2β cos(ω_m t) ), where β is the modulation index. 

Wait, so the modulating frequency is ω_m, which should relate to the frequency of the carrier. But in the given equation, the argument inside the cosine for the modulating part is 20 cos(1000 π t). Let me parse this.

The general form is 2β cos(ω_m t). So in the given v(t), the argument is 20 cos(1000 π t). So 2β must be 20. So β is 10. Because 2β = 20 → β=10.

The carrier frequency ω_c is 2 × 10^7 π t. So the carrier frequency f_c is (2 ×10^7 π)/ (2π) ) = 10^7 /1 → wait, no, wait: f_c is (2 ×10^7 π) divided by 2π, right? Because ω_c is 2 π f_c. So ω_c = 2 ×10^7 π → f_c = (2 ×10^7 π) / (2 π) )= 10^7 Hz. Wait, 10^7 Hz is 10 MHz. So the carrier is at 10 MHz.

The modulating frequency is given by ω_m = 1000 π → f_m = (1000 π) / (2π) )= 500 Hz. So the modulating frequency is 500 Hz.

The bandwidth for an FM signal is given by the difference between the highest and lowest frequency components in the modulated signal. Wait, but for AM and FM, the bandwidth is determined by the modulation index. Hmm, wait: in AM, the bandwidth is 2×β f_m, but for FM, it's approximately the same. Or is it different for AM and FM? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think the formula for bandwidth is β times the modulating frequency. So in this case, since β is 10 and f_m is 500 Hz, the bandwidth should be 10 * 500 = 5000 Hz, which is 5 kHz. But wait, none of the options seem to match 5 kHz. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A:10 kHz, B:15, C:11, D:21, E:500 Hz, F:40 kHz, G:20500 Hz, H:30 kHz, I:10500 Hz, J:8 kHz.

Hmm, none of these are 5 kHz. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula for bandwidth in FM. Oh wait, no, the bandwidth for AM is 2β fm, and for FM, it's about the same. But wait, no, the exact formula for FM bandwidth is a bit different. Let me think. Oh wait, the maximum deviation is β f_m. For AM, the modulation is a constant, so the maximum is just the carrier plus the modulation. But for FM, the maximum frequency deviation is β times the modulating frequency. So the maximum frequency is f_c + β f_m, and the minimum is f_c - β f_m. So the bandwidth is (f_c + β f_m) - (f_c - β f_m) )= 2 β f_m. So same as AM.

Wait, but that would mean the bandwidth is 10 *500=5000 Hz which is 5 kHz. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the modulating signal inside the cosine is 20 cos(1000π t). So the argument is 20 cos(1000 π t). So that's inside the argument of the main cosine. So the general form is 2β cos(ω_m t). So 2β must equal 20, so β=10. So that's correct.

The carrier is 2 ×10^7 π t → so 2π f_c = 2e7 π → f_c = 1e7 Hz = 10 MHz. So that's correct.

The modulating frequency is 1000 π t → f_m = (1000 π) / (2π) )= 500 Hz. So that's correct.

So the bandwidth is 2β f_m → 2*10*500=10,000 Hz → 10 kHz. Wait, 10,000 Hz is 10 kHz. So the bandwidth is 10 kHz. But looking at the options, option A is 10 kHz. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I initially thought the formula would give a different result. So perhaps I was right the first time, and the answer is 10 kHz.

But wait, the options include 20500 Hz (G), which is 20.5 kHz. Hmm, why would that be possible? Or maybe I made a mistake in calculating the maximum and minimum frequencies.

Wait, another approach: the maximum frequency in the modulated signal is f_c + β f_m. The minimum is f_c - β f_m. The difference between these is 2 β f_m. So the bandwidth is 2 β f_m.

So 2*10*500=10,000 Hz (10kHz). That's option A.

So why is option G 20500 Hz? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Could it be that the problem is using β as 5 instead of 10? Let's see.

Wait, the given modulating signal is 20 cos(1000π t). So inside the cosine: 2β cos(ω_m t) = 20 cos(1000π t). So 2β = 20 → β=10. That's correct.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the total deviation, which is β f_m. That would be 10*500=5000 Hz, which is 5 kHz. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options don't have 5 kHz. So perhaps I'm mistaken. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the bandwidth but something else.

Wait another angle: perhaps the question is about the modulation index, which is 10. Then the formula for bandwidth is approximately 2 β f_m, which is 10,000 Hz, so 10 kHz. So the correct answer is A.

But looking again: sometimes, the bandwidth for FM is approximated as 2β f_m, which is correct. So 10,000 Hz is 10 kHz. So option A is correct.

Wait, but the given options don't include 10 kHz except for option A. So the answer should be option A:10 kHz.

The problem involves determining the bandwidth of a frequency modulated (FM) signal given by \( v(t) = 10 \cos(2 \times 10^7 \pi t + 20 \cos(1000 \pi t)) \). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **General Form of FM Signal**: The general form of an FM signal is \( v(t) = A \cos(\omega_c t + 2\beta \cos(\omega_m t)) \), where:
   - \( \omega_c = 2\pi f_c \) is the carrier frequency.
   - \( \beta \) is the modulation index.
   - \( \omega_m = 2\pi f_m \) is the modulating frequency.

2. **Extracting Parameters**:
   - The carrier frequency \( f_c \) is derived from \( \omega_c = 2 \times 10^7 \pi \), so \( f_c = 10^7 \, \text{Hz} = 10 \, \text{MHz} \).
   - The modulating frequency \( f_m \) is derived from \( \omega_m = 1000 \pi \), so \( f_m = 500 \, \text{Hz} \).
   - The modulation index \( \beta \) is determined from \( 2\beta = 20 \), so \( \beta = 10 \).

3. **Bandwidth of FM Signal**: The bandwidth of an FM signal is given by \( \text{Bandwidth} = 2\beta f_m \). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Bandwidth} = 2 \times 10 \times 500 = 10,000 \, \text{Hz} = 10 \, \text{kHz}.
   \]

4. **Option Analysis**: Among the given options, \( 10 \, \text{kHz} \) corresponds to option **A**.

### Conclusion:
The bandwidth of the given FM signal is \( 10 \, \text{kHz} \), making the correct answer **A**.
