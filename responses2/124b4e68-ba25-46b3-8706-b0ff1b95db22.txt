Okay, so I've got this question about the second law of thermodynamics. Hmm, I remember that the second law is all about entropy and the direction in which heat flows. Let me think. The law says that heat tends to move from a hotter object to a cooler one, right? But wait, it's not always possible; there must be some condition there.

The options are about what heat doesn't flow from. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says heat doesn't flow from hot to cold without external energy. Wait, that's the opposite of what the second law says. The law says it does flow, so A is incorrect because it's the opposite of what's happening.

Option B says heat doesn't flow from cold to hot ever. No, that's not right either. The second law allows heat to flow from cold to hot, but it's not perpetual, so it's not "ever" happening. So B is incorrect. It's the opposite.

Option C: hot to cold without internal energy. Oh wait, that's not correct. The second law requires internal energy to drive the heat transfer. Without internal energy, it's not possible. So C is wrong.

Option D: cold to hot without a change in state. No, wait. The second law is about heat moving from hot to cold. But does it allow for heat to move from cold to hot without a change in state? I think that's not the case. Heat transfer direction depends on temperature, not the state. So D is incorrect. The second law doesn't prevent that, it just says it's not spontaneous in certain cases.

Option E: hot to cold without a change in temperature. Wait, that's not right. The second law requires a temperature difference to drive the heat transfer. Without a change in temperature, it's not possible. So E is incorrect.

Option F: hot to cold without a change in state. Hmm, I'm not sure. The second law doesn't specify much about state changes. The direction depends on temperature, not state. So F is incorrect.

Option G: cold to hot without internal pressure. Wait, internal pressure — I'm not sure. The second law doesn't mention pressure, so maybe this is about something else. Alternatively, maybe it's assuming pressure is involved, but I'm not certain. I think this is related to the first law, but not the second. So G is unclear, maybe incorrect.

Option H: cold to hot without a change in temperature. No, the second law says it's not possible without a temperature difference. So H is incorrect.

Option I: hot to cold ever. No, the second law says it's not possible to go from hot to cold without some external energy. So I is incorrect.

Option J: cold to hot without external energy. Wait, that's the opposite of what the second law says. The law says heat flows from hot to cold, not the other way. So J is incorrect because it suggests heat moves from cold to hot without external energy, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but I'm confused. Let me think again. The second law states that heat flows spontaneously from a higher temperature to lower. So which option says that heat doesn't flow in that direction? Let's see:

Looking back, the question is which is the opposite direction that heat doesn't flow. So the question is asking: which statement is the opposite of the second law. The second law says heat flows from hot to cold. So the law doesn't allow heat to flow from cold to hot.

So the question is asking which statement the law tells us heat doesn't do. So what's option B? Option B says heat doesn't flow from cold to hot ever. Since the second law says that heat can flow from cold to hot (it just can't do it spontaneously), then option B is correct. It's saying that it doesn't ever flow, which is a stronger statement than the second law. So the option that the law doesn't allow is the correct answer.

Wait, let me check the options again:

The question is: "The second law of thermodynamics tells us that heat doesn’t flow from..." So it's asking what is not allowed.

So which of the options is a statement that the second law prohibits.

So looking for a statement that the second law says heat can't do.

Option B says heat doesn't flow from cold to hot ever. The second law says heat can flow from cold to hot, but it's not perpetual. So the second law doesn't say it never does, but that it can't do it continuously. So option B is correct because it says heat doesn't flow that way ever.

Option J says cold to hot without external energy. That's opposite of what the second law says. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B.
</think>

The second law of thermodynamics states that heat flows spontaneously from a hotter object to a cooler one, but it explicitly prohibits heat from flowing from a cooler object to a hotter one, even if there is no external energy source. Among the given options, the statement "heat doesn’t flow from cold to hot ever" aligns with the second law, as it explicitly prohibits this direction of heat flow. 

Option B correctly captures this restriction. The other options either describe scenarios that are not permitted by the second law or misrepresent the law's implications.
