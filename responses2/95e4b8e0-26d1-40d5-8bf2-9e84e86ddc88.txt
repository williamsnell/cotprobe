C: Yes, because it's a spontaneous statement
D: No, because the statement was made under duress
E: Yes, because it's a recorded statement
F: No, because the statement was not made under oath

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Officer Friendly's testimony is admissible in this case. Let me think through this step by step.

So, Justin's estate is suing Polly for wrongful death, and they're using Officer Friendly as a witness. Officer Friendly interviewed Polly right after the event. Polly testified that she was cleaning her pistol and when it shot Justin, she was negligent. 

The question is whether this testimony is admissible. I remember that there are several rules about statement admissibility in criminal law. Let's break this down.

First, I'm remembering that statements made during the course of a criminal case can sometimes be admissible if they meet certain standards. Specifically, the statement must be made under oath, or at least must not be untruthful to the extent that it's relevant.

Wait, so in this case, Officer Friendly is an interviewee. He's directly interviewing Polly. Polly is testifying, so the dialogue is between two individuals. But does that change anything? I think the key here is the content of the statement, not who is telling it.

Polly said she shot Justin and was negligent. So she called out her mistake. But was she being truthful? No, it's about negligence. So the statement's content is about her own actions and the failure of her action.

Now, can such a statement be admitted as admissions? I remember that a statement must be made under oath, or it must be an excited utterance, or a recorded statement. But in this case, was Officer Friendly in a situation where he was under oath?

Looking back, the fact that he's an interviewee doesn't automatically make him under oath. He just interviewed someone. So if he's not under oath, but his statement is of the facts, then it's not an admission. So I think this would not qualify as an admissible statement because it's not under oath and it's not a recorded statement or an excited utterance.

Wait, but let me think again. The statement was made during an interview, not a deposition. So maybe it's an excited utterance. But I'm not entirely sure about that. I think excited utterance requires that the statement was made in a moment of excitement or shock, which doesn't apply here. Because the statement was about an event that happened just before the event, not necessarily in an excited state.

Another point is that the statement's content is about her actions and the outcome. It's not about a statement made under oath regarding a specific event. So if the statement is not made under oath, it's not admissible as an admission. 

So looking at the options, option G says "Yes, because it's an excited utterance." But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, option C is "Yes, because it's a spontaneous statement." Hmm, spontaneous statements might be allowed under certain circumstances, but I think they can be used if they're made under oath or in a situation of extreme excitement, which isn't met here.

Wait, but what about the fact that it was made during an interview. Does that make it a recorded statement? No, because recording requires a recording device, which wasn't mentioned here. So it's not a recorded statement.

Another angle: is the statement from the interviewee (Officer Friendly) considered a deposition? No, a deposition is a statement made by the declarant under oath. Here, the declarant is Polly, so that's not the case. Officer Friendly is just an interviewee, not a deposition.

So, if the statement is not an admission (i.e., not under oath), not a recorded statement, and not an excited utterance, then the testimony wouldn't be admissible. So looking at the options, which ones don't fit?

Option I says "No, hearsay without an exception." Well, except for the fact that it's a statement of fact (not a question), but that's not the only exception. So if the statement meets the criteria for being an admission, it would be admissible. But if it's not, then it's hearsay without an exception.

So the question is whether the statement qualifies as an admission. If it's a spontaneous statement but not under oath, then it's not admitted. But if it's an excited utterance, which I think it isn't, then it's allowed.

But wait, the test for excited utterance is that the statement was made in a situation of extreme excitement, like a moment of shock or panic. In this case, the event that happened was Justin's death, which is a serious event, but Officer Friendly was just interviewing. So he didn't feel any excitement at the time. So he didn't make an excited utterance.

Therefore, the statement isn't an excited utterance. So it doesn't fall under that exception. So the testimony wouldn't be admissible as an admission. 

So the statement isn't an admission, so it's hearsay without an exception. So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another rule is that if the statement is made by a witness called after the event, but whether that's a different issue. But in this case, the statement is being made by Officer Friendly, who was an interviewee. So the rule about being called after the event doesn't apply here because the statement is being made during the interview, not being a deposition.

So the only thing that matters is whether the statement is an admission (under oath, excited utterance, or recorded), which it's not. So the testimony isn't admissible, making the statement hearsay without an exception.

So looking back at the options, option I says "No, hearsay without an exception." So the correct answer is I.

Officer Friendly's testimony is not admissible because the statement made by Officer Friendly is not under oath, nor is it an excited utterance, nor is it a recorded statement. The statement is a statement of fact made during an interview, not a deposition, and it is not made under a situation of excitement. Therefore, it is hearsay without an exception. 

Answer: I: No, hearsay without an exception.
