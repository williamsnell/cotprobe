Okay, so I've got this real estate tax problem here. Let me see what I need to do. Hmm, the question says Ms. Finer owns two houses in a town where the tax rate is $43.72 per $1000. The market values are $17,000 and $25,000. The houses are assessed at 75% of their market values. I need to find out the total real estate tax she pays.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I think I need to calculate the assessed value of each house. Assessment is based on the market value, so I'll take each house's market value and multiply it by 75%. 

So for the first house, which is $17,000, the assessed value would be 75% of that. Let me calculate that. 75% is the same as 0.75, so 17,000 * 0.75. Let me see, 17,000 * 0.75. Well, 10,000 * 0.75 is 7,500, and 7,000 * 0.75 is 5,250. So adding them together gives 12,750. So the first house's assessed value is $12,750.

Wait, but the tax rate is $43.72 per $1000. So I need to find out how much tax that is. So for $12,750, how many thousands is that? 12,750 divided by 1000 is 12.75. Then multiply that by the tax rate: 12.75 * 43.72.

Hmm, let me compute that. Let's see, 12 * 43.72 is 524.64. Then 0.75 *43.72. 0.7 times 43.72 is approximately 30.604, and 0.05 is 2.186. So 30.604 +2.186 = 32.79. Adding that to 524.64 gives 557.43. So the tax from the first house is $557.43.

Wait, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 12,750 * 43.72 / 1000. So 12,750 divided by 1000 is 12.75. 12.75 *43.72.

Let me calculate 12 *43.72 is 524.64. 0.75 *43.72 is 32.79. So 524.64 +32.79 = 557.43. So that's correct. So the first house is $557.43 in tax.

Now the second house is $25,000 in market value. Assessing that at 75%: 25,000 * 0.75 is 18,750. Then, how much tax is that? Again using the rate of 43.72 per 1000.

18,750 divided by 1000 is 18.75. 18.75 *43.72. Let me calculate that. 18 *43.72 is 786.96. 0.75 *43.72 is 32.79. So adding them gives 786.96 +32.79 = 819.75. So the tax on the second house is $819.75.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I might have made an error here. Because I think the initial approach is correct, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 18,750 *43.72 /1000. Let's see: 18,750 *43.72 = let me compute that.

Alternatively, another way to calculate the tax is to take each house's assessed value, multiply by the tax rate per $1000, and sum them.

So for the first house: 12,750 divided by 1000 is 12.75. Multiply by 43.72. Hmm, that's 12.75 *43.72.

Let me compute that more accurately:

43.72 *12 = 524.64.

43.72 *0.75 = let's compute 43.72 *0.75.

43.72 *0.7 = 30.604.

43.72 *0.05 = 2.186.

Adding them gives 30.604 + 2.186 = 32.79.

So 524.64 +32.79 = 557.43. So that's correct.

Now the second house: 18,750 /1000 = 18.75. 18.75 *43.72.

43.72 *18 = let's compute:

43.72 *10 = 437.20.

43.72 *8 = 349.76.

Adding gives 437.20 +349.76 = 786.96.

Now 0.75 *43.72: 43.72 *0.7=30.604; 43.72 *0.05=2.186. So 30.604 +2.186=32.79.

Adding that to 786.96: 786.96 +32.79 = 819.75.

So the second house's tax is $819.75.

Now, add both taxes: 557.43 +819.75.

Let me add them: 557 +819 is 1376, and 0.43 +0.75 is 1.18. So total is 1376 +1.18 = $1,377.18.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is $1,377.18. So that's the sum of both taxes.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might miscalculate something.

Wait, 557.43 +819.75.

557 +819 = 1376.

0.43 +0.75 = 1.18.

So total is 1376 +1.18 = 1377.18. So option H is $1,377.18.

So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in assessing the houses. The market values are $17,000 and $25,000. The assessment rate is 75%, so for each house, multiply by 0.75.

Yes, 17k *0.75 is 12.75 *1000.

Similarly, 25k *0.75 is 18.75 *1000. That's correct.

Then, each is taxed at 43.72 per $1000.

Hmm, 12.75 *43.72 = 557.43, and 18.75 *43.72 = 819.75. Sum is 1377.18. So option H is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is $1,377.18, which matches. So the correct answer is option H.

The assessed value of each house is calculated by multiplying the market value by 75%. For the first house ($17,000 market value), the assessed value is $12,750. For the second house ($25,000 market value), it is $18,750. The tax is calculated by multiplying each assessed value by the tax rate ($43.72 per $1000).

1. First house: $12,750 * (43.72 / 1000) = $557.43  
2. Second house: $18,750 * (43.72 / 1000) = $819.75  

Adding both taxes: $557.43 + $819.75 = $1,377.18.  

The correct answer is option H: $1,377.18.  

Answer: H
