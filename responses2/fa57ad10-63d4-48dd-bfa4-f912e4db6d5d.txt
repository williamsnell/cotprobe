Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an airplane's groundspeed in a crosswind. Let me see what I can remember from my classes. The question is about vector addition because the plane's airspeed and wind speed are perpendicular, right?

Alright, the plane's nose is pointing north, which I assume means its velocity is directed north. The airspeed is 40 km/h. But there's a crosswind coming from the east, which is perpendicular to the north-south direction. The wind speed is 30 km/h. Wait, so the wind is blowing perpendicular to the plane's direction. Oh, right, crosswind would be from the direction opposite to where the wind is coming from. So if the wind is from the east, it's pushing the plane to the west, adding to the groundspeed's westward component.

Hmm, so the plane's velocity relative to the air is north at 40 km/h. But the wind is pushing it west at 30 km/h. So the ground speed is the vector sum of these two. I think I can model this with the Pythagorean theorem because the two components are perpendicular. So groundspeed would be the square root of (40^2 + 30^2) km/h.

Calculating that: 40 squared is 1600, 30 squared is 900. Adding them gives 2500. The square root of 2500 is 50. So the groundspeed should be 50 km/h. Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. The problem says the plane is pointed north with an airspeed of 40 km/h. Crosswind is perpendicular, so the wind adds a westward component of 30 km/h. So the ground speed is the magnitude of the vector sum of these two. Since they are perpendicular, the formula is correct. So 40 and 30, so 50. Yep, that makes sense.

To determine the groundspeed of the airplane, we consider the vector addition of the plane's airspeed and the crosswind. The plane's airspeed is 40 km/h north, and the crosswind adds a westward component of 30 km/h. Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
\text{Groundspeed} = \sqrt{(40 \, \text{km/h})^2 + (30 \, \text{km/h})^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50 \, \text{km/h}.
\]

Thus, the groundspeed is 50 km/h, corresponding to option C.
