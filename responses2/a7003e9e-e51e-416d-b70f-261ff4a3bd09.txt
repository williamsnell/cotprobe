Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the credit rating of retail businesses. The question is asking for the last character of the correct answer, which is the source of information. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. It's asking for the last character of the correct answer, which is a source of information on the credit rating of retail businesses. The options are A to J, each with different entities or organizations.

I remember that credit ratings for businesses often come from organizations that evaluate creditworthiness. So, what organizations do that? Let me think about each option.

Option A: Equifax, Inc. I believe Equifax is involved in credit information on consumers. They provide credit reports, but I'm not sure if they're a direct source for business credit ratings.

Option B: The National Retail Federation. Wait, the National Retail Federation is more about retail business associations, not specifically credit ratings. They might be involved in licensing retail services, but I don't think they're the main source for credit info.

Option C: The Small Business Administration. I know SBA is the government agency that helps small businesses. They might provide information on business credit, but is that the main source for retail businesses specifically?

Option D: The local chamber of commerce. The chamber of commerce in a city or state probably handles local business credit information. But this is more regional or local, so maybe it's not the primary source for all retail businesses.

Option E: Moody's Corporation. Moody's is a well-known credit rating organization. They provide credit ratings for businesses, so this could be a candidate.

Option F: The United States Department of Commerce. That's more about trade regulations and consumer protection, I think. Not directly related to credit ratings for businesses.

Option G: The Retail Merchants Association. That sounds like a business organization focused on retail, so maybe they have some information on credit.

Option H: Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. Dun & Bradstreet is a credit rating agency. They provide credit ratings, so this could be another option.

Option I: The Better Business Bureau. The BBB is the main consumer protection agency. They provide info on business credit issues and ratings, so this is a possibility.

Option J: The United States Retail Credit Association. That sounds like a credit rating organization for retail businesses.

Wait, the question is about the last character of the correct answer. So I need to figure out what the correct answer is first.

The question is about information on the credit rating of retail businesses. So possible sources are credit rating agencies, government agencies, business associations, or consumer protection bodies.

Option E (Moody's) and I (BBB) are credit rating agencies. Option J is an association. So, the BBB is a consumer protection body, but I think they also provide credit ratings. So both E and I are possible.

Wait, but the question is about information on the credit rating. If E is a credit rating agency, then they would provide such information. Similarly, the BBB has a rating, but is it a credit rating agency? Or is it a consumer protection body that administers credit ratings?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Moody's is a credit rating agency. They provide credit ratings, so that would fit. The Better Business Bureau is a consumer protection agency, but they also provide credit ratings for consumers. So both E and I could be correct.

Wait, but the question is about the credit rating of retail businesses. Both E and I are credit rating agencies. So which one is the correct answer?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E (Moody's) because they are an established credit rating agency. Or maybe the answer is I (BBB), as they have a direct focus on consumer protection, including credit ratings.

Wait, I'm mixing up the roles. Let me think again. The question is about retail businesses' credit ratings. So, the correct source could be either E or I, but I'm not sure which one.

Wait, the Retail Merchants Association (G) is a business organization, so maybe they handle local credit info. The Retail Credit Association (J) might be similar.

Alternatively, the answer could be E or I, but the question is about the last character of the correct option. So I need to figure out which option is correct.

Wait, I think I remember that the credit rating agencies are E and I, but the question is looking for one. Maybe the answer is E (Moody's). Alternatively, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the Retail Merchants Association (G) is a business association, so perhaps they have information on retail businesses. But I'm not sure if that's a standard source for credit ratings.

Alternatively, the Retail Credit Association (J) is a credit rating organization for retail businesses.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall a fact: the BBB is the main consumer protection agency, which administers credit ratings. So they provide credit ratings for consumers, including retail businesses. So J is a possible answer.

Alternatively, the credit rating agencies (E and I) are more specialized. So, I'm a bit torn between E and J.

Wait, maybe the answer is E (Moody's). Because they are a well-known credit rating agency, and the question is about information on credit ratings. Alternatively, if the question is about business credit, then perhaps they are part of that.

Wait, another approach: the options are letters, and the question is about the last character of the correct answer. So, if the correct answer is E (Moody's), then the last character is 's' (since E is "Moody's," the last letter is 's'). Similarly, J is "United States Retail Credit Association," last letter 's'.

Wait, the correct answer is either E or I or J? Let me think again. The BBB is a consumer protection body. They provide credit ratings for consumers. So, if the question is about retail businesses' credit ratings, the BBB would be the source. So J is the answer.

Alternatively, E and I are credit rating agencies, but the question says "information on the credit rating of retail businesses," which suggests they're specific to retail. So perhaps E or I are better.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I recall that the BBB is the main consumer protection agency, so their rating services are used by consumers. Retail businesses might also use the BBB for credit information, but is that considered credit rating? Or is it more about consumer protection?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look for another angle. Another thought: the U.S. Department of Commerce (F) is involved in trade and consumer protection, but their main role is trade, not credit.

The Retail Merchants Association (G) is a business organization, so they might have local credit info. The United States Retail Credit Association (J) is an organization that provides credit ratings for retail businesses.

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the correct answer. Let's see:

Options:
A: Equifax, Inc. → no last character relevant.
B: National Retail Federation → no
C: Small Business Administration → no
D: Local chamber → no
E: Moody's → last letter 's'
F: US D.O.C → no
G: Retail Merchants → no
H: Dun & Bradstreet → no
I: BBB → last letter 's'
J: Retail Credit Assn → last letter 's'

So all E, I, J have 's' as the last character. So the correct options are E, I, J.

But the question is about the last character of the correct answer. So if the correct answer is one of them, the last character is 's'.

Wait, but the question is about information on the credit rating of retail businesses. So the correct answer should be an organization that provides credit ratings for retail.

So E is a credit rating agency, I is a consumer protection body that administers credit ratings. So both E and I are correct.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the BBB because it's the consumer protection body, but I'm not sure if they are the primary source for credit ratings for retail businesses.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each option is known for.

- Equifax (A) is a credit report provider, so it's more about consumers' credit info.
- National Retail Federation (B) is a business organization, so maybe for retail associations.
- SBA (C) is about small businesses, possibly applicable to retail.
- Local chamber (D) is a business association, but perhaps not specific to retail.
- SBA is about small businesses, but the question is about retail.
- Retail Merchants Association (G) is a business association, so maybe for retail.
- D & B (H) is a credit rating agency, but I think it's more about consumers.
- BBB (I) is consumer protection body, administers credit ratings.
- Retail Credit Assn (J) is a credit rating organization for retail businesses.
- D.O.C (F) is trade and consumer protection.
- Dun & Bradstreet (H) is a credit rating agency.

So, the question is about credit ratings for retail businesses. So the correct sources could be E (Moody's), I (BBB), or J (Retail Credit Assn).

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the correct answer. So all E, I, J are correct, but the last character of each is 's' (E: 'Moody's', I: 'BBB', J: 'R Retail Credit Association').

So the answer options are E, I, J. But the question is about the CR of retail businesses. So which of these is a credit rating agency?

- E is a credit rating agency.
- I is a consumer protection body but administers credit ratings.
- J is a credit rating organization for retail businesses.

So J is a credit rating organization for retail businesses. Therefore, J is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the answer could be E (Moody's), a well-known credit rating agency.

Wait, but the question is about information on the credit rating of retail businesses. So if the answer is E, it's a credit rating agency, but the question is about retail businesses, so perhaps E is more relevant.

Alternatively, the answer is I (the BBB) because it's a consumer protection body, but the question is about credit ratings for retail businesses.

This is getting confusing. Let me try to recall that the BBB is the consumer protection body, but they also provide credit ratings. So I think in this case, the correct answer is E (Moody's) because they're a credit rating agency, which directly provides credit ratings.

Alternatively, the answer is J (the Retail Credit Association) because they are the credit rating organizations for retail businesses.

Wait, another approach: the question asks for the last character of the correct answer. So, all E, I, J have 's' as the last character. So any of these would be correct if only one of them is the actual answer.

But the question is about the credit rating of retail businesses, so which of these is the correct source.

I think the correct answer is J (United States Retail Credit Association) because that's a credit rating organization specifically for retail businesses. Alternatively, I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I think I'll have to go with the most straightforward answer. The credit rating agencies are E and I, but I think the Retail Credit Association is the direct credit rating organization for retail businesses.

Alternatively, given that the question is about retail businesses, the answer is J.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

Another thought: the Retail Merchants Association (G) is a business association, so maybe they have some information on retail. But I'm not sure if that's the primary source.

The Retail Credit Association (J) is an organization that provides credit ratings for retail businesses. So J would be the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is J, and the last character is 's'.
</think>

The correct answer is J: the United States Retail Credit Association. This association provides credit ratings for retail businesses, and its last character is 's'.

Answer: J
