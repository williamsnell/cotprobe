Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about calculating the yearly salaries and weekly amounts for four people—Y, W, U, and S. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, let's list down the details of each person:

- **Y**: Pays $380 semi-monthly. Semi-monthly means every six months, so that's 2 times a year. So each pay period is $380, and there are two of them per year. So Y's annual salary is 380 * 2 = $760. Wait, but let me double-check. If semi-monthly is every six months, then each year has two payments. So yes, 380 * 2 = 760. So Y's annual salary is $760. Now, the weekly salary: since there are 52 weeks in a year, Y gets paid twice a year, so their weekly salary is 760 / 52. Let me calculate that: 760 divided by 52. Hmm, 52 times 14 is 728, which leaves 32. 32/52 is about 0.615. So approximately 14.615. Rounding to two decimal places, that's $14.61 per week. But wait, looking at the options, I see option I has Y as $3800 yearly and $170.38 weekly. Wait, that can't be right because 3800 /52 is 73.07 per week? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait Y's semi-monthly is $380, so annual is 380 * 2 = 760. So the annual salary is $760. But the options for Y in option I have it as $3800, which is 5 times that. So I must be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the question. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says Y is paid $380 semi-monthly. So each pay period is $380, and since there are two periods a year, that's 380 * 2 = 760 per year. But the options don't match that. For example, option I has Y's annual salary as $3800, which would require 3800 /52 = 73.07 per week, which doesn't make sense if they're semi-monthly. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is that Y is paid $380 every other month. So in a year, that's two payments, so $380 * 2 = $760. So Y's annual salary is $760, not $3800. But looking at the options, the only one with Y's annual salary as $760 is option I and perhaps other options have that. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option I says Y's annual salary is $3800, which is incorrect. Option H says Y's annual is $91200, which is way too high. Option J, for example, says Y's annual is $9840, which is even higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is that Y is paid $380 every month, not every two. Let me read the question again. "Y is paid $380 semi-monthly." That means every six months, so two payments a year. So yes, 380 * 2 = 760. But now, looking at the options, for each person, their options vary. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each option.

Looking at option G, for example, Y's annual is $7980. So 7980 /52 = 153.46 per week, which doesn't match any of the others. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should calculate each person's annual salary based on their payment frequency.

Let me go through each person one by one.

**Y:**
- Semi-monthly: every 6 months. So two payments a year.
- Each payment: $380. So annual salary: 380 * 2 = $760.
- Weekly salary: 760 /52 = 14.615, which is approximately $14.62 per week. But looking at the options, option I has Y's annual salary as $3800 and $170.38 weekly, which doesn't align. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting semi-monthly. Alternatively, maybe the question means that Y is paid $380 every two months, which is the same as semi-monthly, so that's 2 times a year. So 760, as before.

Wait, but none of the options have Y's annual salary as 760. So perhaps I'm missing a key part. Let me check W's data.

**W:**
- $55 per day, works 4 days a week. So weekly pay is 55 *4= 220. So W is paid $220 per week. Their annual salary is 220 * 52 = 11,440. But looking at the options, W's options are varied. Option G says W's annual is $11020, but 11020 /52 is about 212 per week, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should calculate all annual salaries and then see which option fits.

Let me proceed with each person.

**Y:**
- Semi-monthly: 2 payments. 380 *2=760.
- Weekly: 760 /52=14.615≈14.62. Not matching any options except for perhaps if the question is different. But none of the options for Y have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the annual salary. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 every two months, which is semi-monthly. So 380 * 2 = 760. So Y's annual salary is 760. So in the options, the only one that comes close is option I, which says 3800, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the question is that Y is paid $380 per month. But the question says semi-monthly, which is every two months. So no, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 semi-monthly, but perhaps the 380 is per month? No, the wording says semi-monthly. So perhaps I'm correct in thinking that Y's annual salary is $760.

But looking at the options, the only one with an annual salary that's a multiple of 100 is option G, which says Y's annual salary is $7980. But 7980 divided by 52 is about 153.46 per week, which is not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should think that Y is paid $380 every other month, which would be two payments a year, so 760. So, perhaps the options are wrong, but I have to proceed.

But looking at the options, the correct Y's annual salary as per the question is 760, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 every two months, which is semi-monthly, so that's 2 times a year. So 380 *2=760.

But the options don't have Y's annual as 760. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the other options and see if any match.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute all the annual salaries and then see which option matches all four.

Let's try for each person.

**Y:**
- Semi-monthly: $380. So 380 *2=760.

**W:**
- $55 per day, 4 days a week: 55 *4=220 per week.
- Annual: 220 *52=11,440.

**U:**
- $480 per month. So annual is 480*12=5760.

**S:**
- Bi-weekly salary of $515. So bi-weekly is every two weeks, so how many bi-weekly periods are in a year? 52 /2=26. So 515 *26= 515*26.

Let me calculate 515 *26: 500*26=13,000; 15*26=390. So total is 13,000+390=13,390. So S's annual salary is $13,390.

Now, let's see the options to see which one matches these numbers.

Looking at option F: U's annual is $5760 and weekly is $11.07.

Option A: Y's is $9,500. Not matching 760. So no.

Option H: Y's is $9,1200, which is 91200, which is way higher than 760.

Option G: Y's is $7980. Hmm, 7980.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Y's calculation. Let's see: if Y is paid $380 semi-monthly, but perhaps that's per month. So 380 *12=4,560. But then that's annual. Alternatively, if it's semi-monthly, that's two payments per year, so 380*2=760. So the correct annual is 760.

But looking at the options, none have Y's annual as 760. So perhaps I'm wrong in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 per month. Then, Y's annual salary is 380*12=4560. But option G says Y's annual is $7980, which is higher. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 every two months (semi-monthly), so 380 *2=760. Then Y's annual is 760. So none of the options have Y's annual as 760. So perhaps the question has a mistake, but I have to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should check all options and see if any align. Let's list the calculated annual salaries and weekly salaries for each option.

Let's take option G:

- Y: $7980 annual, $153.46 weekly.

So 7980 /52 = 153.46 per week.

If that's correct, then Y's semi-monthly would be 153.46 *2=306.92 per month. But the question says Y is paid $380 semi-monthly. So 306.92 is not 380. So option G isn't correct.

Option F:

- Y: $9,120 yearly, $175.38 weekly. So 9120/52=175.38. 175.38 *2=350.76 per month. So Y is paid $350.76 semi-monthly, but the question says $380. So option F is incorrect.

Option J: Y's annual is 9840, which is 9840/52=189.23 per week. So 189.23*2=378.46 per month. Not 380.

Option I: Y's annual is 3800, which is 3800/52=73.07 per week. 73.07*2=146.14, which is close to the $14.61 mentioned in option I, but that's a different amount. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 every two weeks (bi-weekly). So that's $380 per two weeks. So to get annual, multiply by 26 (since 52 weeks /2 =26). 380*26=9,880. But option H says Y's annual is 91200, which is higher.

Hmm, not matching. So perhaps I'm wrong in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 per month. So 380 *12=4560. So annual is 4560. But none of the options have that. So perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question meant that Y is paid $380 per month, but the question says semi-monthly. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 every two weeks, which is bi-weekly. So annual is 380*26=9,880. Looking at the options, option H says Y's annual is 91200, which is way higher. So no match.

Wait, perhaps the question is that Y is paid $380 every month, which would be 380*12=4560, but that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck each person's calculations.

**Y:**
- Semi-monthly: $380. Since there are two payments per year, that's 380 *2 =760.

**W:**
- $55 per day, 4 days a week: 55 *4=220 per week.
- Annual: 220 *52=11,440.

**U:**
- $480 per month. Annual: 480 *12=5,760.

**S:**
- Bi-weekly salary of $515. So 515 *26 (since 26 bi-weekly periods in a year) = 515 *26=13,390.

Now, let's look for any option that has these values.

Looking at option G:

- Y: $7980 annual, $153.46 weekly. That doesn't match our calculations because 7980/52=153.46, which is correct, but Y's semi-monthly would be 153.46 *2=306.92, which is not $380.

Option F:

- Y: $9,120 annual, which is higher than 760. So incorrect.

Option J:

- Y's annual is 9840, which is higher than our 760.

Option H:

- Y's annual is 91200, which is way higher.

Option I:

- Y's annual is 3800, which is 73.07 weekly. But Y's semi-monthly should be 146.14, which would be $382.28 if rounded to the nearest cent. So option I's Y is $3800, which is incorrect.

Option A:

- Y: $9500, which is incorrect.

Option B:

- Y: $5200, incorrect.

Option C:

- Y: $8400, which is incorrect.

Option D:

- Y: $3800, incorrect.

Option E:

- Y: $760, which matches our 760 calculation. But the weekly salary in option E is $14.61, which is correct for 760/52=14.615. But let's check if the other options' weekly salaries make sense.

Option E:

- W: $5500 annual, so weekly is 5500/52=105.769, which is approximately $105.77.

But the question says W is paid $55 per day, so 55*4=220 weekly. So option E's weekly is $105.77, which is wrong. So option E is incorrect.

Option F:

- W's weekly is $11,440 /52=220, which is correct.

Option G:

- W's annual is $11,020, which is incorrect.

Option H:

- W's annual is $11,440, which is higher than our 11,440.

Option I:

- W's annual is $38,000, which is higher.

Option J:

- W's annual is $9,120, which is incorrect.

Option K:

- W's annual is $114400, which is way higher.
