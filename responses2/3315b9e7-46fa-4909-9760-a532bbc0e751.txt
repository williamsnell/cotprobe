Question:

How does Stevenson respond to the objection that his theory does not account for the kind of goodness that is objective and is known a priori?

E: He claims that the objection is irrelevant to his theory.
F: He claims that such a property is subjective, not objective.
G: He claims that the objection is based on a misunderstanding.
H: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.
I: He does not respond to the objection.
J: He claims that his theory does account for this kind of goodness.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Stevenson and his theory on goodness. Let me try to break it down. 

The question asks how Stevenson responds to an objection that his theory doesn't account for the kind of goodness that's objective and known a priori. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should remember what Stevenson's theory was about. From what I remember, Stevenson's moral philosophy was primarily about the theory of human nature. He believed that humans are moral because they have certain biological and psychological traits. He rejected the idea of a moral universe and instead thought about different moral systems, like humanism, naturalism, and others.

Now, the objection here is that Stevenson's theory doesn't account for objective goodness. Objective goodness means something that's good in reality and can be evaluated objectively, without personal feelings. For example, things like justice or beauty are objective goodness.

I think Stevenson's theory might not cover all types of objective goodness. Because he was trying to find moral systems that are good in their own right, not just the subjective ones. So if someone objects that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, Stevenson would need to respond in a way that either acknowledges this or provides a better explanation.

Looking at the options:

A: He claims he doesn't understand such a property. That seems a bit off because Stevenson did understand some properties of humans. Maybe he thought he didn't know, but I don't think that's the right answer.

B: He claims his theory is still in the process of development. That's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the exact response people give. I think Stevenson was pretty advanced, maybe he had some ideas but perhaps didn't fully develop them yet.

C: None of the above. Hmm, not sure. I'll keep this in mind.

D: He claims to have proven that such a property does not exist. That doesn't make much sense because he was looking for properties that are objectively good.

E: His theory is irrelevant to the objection. I'm not sure. The objection is about his theory not accounting for objective goodness. If he's offering an explanation, maybe E isn't correct.

F: He claims such a property is subjective. I don't think that's right either because his focus was on objective goodness, not subjective ones.

G: He claims the objection is based on misunderstanding. Maybe Stevenson thought the objection isn't relevant. Maybe he thought the objection is wrong because he believed objective goodness is known a priori.

H: He offers an account of such a property. Oh, that sounds plausible. Stevenson might have proposed a theory that addresses objective goodness.

I: He doesn't respond. I don't think so, because he's trying to address the objection.

J: He claims his theory does account for this. That seems to directly answer the objection. He's saying his theory does address the issue.

Wait, so if the objection is that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, then Stevenson would have a theory that does address that. So option J says he claims his theory does do that. So J is the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. Because I'm a bit fuzzy on Stevenson's actual stance. Alternatively, perhaps Stevenson's theory was more about systems rather than properties. He might have thought that objective goodness isn't a property of people but rather a system of values. So if the objection is about objective goodness (a property), Stevenson would have offered a different kind of theory, not necessarily that his theory accounts for it.

Alternatively, perhaps Stevenson didn't accept objective goodness as a property. Maybe he believed only subjective goodness is good. So when the objection is that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, he would say that his theory doesn't address it, and perhaps that his theory does account for something else.

Wait, but the question says he doesn't account for the kind of goodness that's objective and known a priori. Option J says he does account for that. So if Stevenson's theory does include such a property, then J is correct.

Alternatively, maybe Stevenson's theory was more about the "good" that is objective, which is known a priori. So he didn't consider that, so he must have offered a different explanation, perhaps one that's outside his system.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about what each option suggests.

The correct answer is J if Stevenson accepts that his theory does account for this kind of goodness. But another angle is that Stevenson's theory might not have addressed objective goodness. So he would have a different answer, like H.

Wait, but the question is about how Stevenson responds. If the objection is that his theory doesn't account for objective goodness, Stevenson would respond by offering his own account, which would be J.

Alternatively, if he didn't account for it, then he would offer his own theory, hence J.

So given that, the correct answer should be J: He claims his theory does account for this kind of goodness.

The question asks how Stevenson responds to an objection that his theory does not account for objective goodness, which is known a priori. Stevenson's theory focused on moral systems rather than objective goodness. Given this, Stevenson would respond by offering his own account of such goodness, making option J correct.

**Answer: J**
