Question:

Find the variance of the random variable X + b where X has variance,VarX and b is a constant.

Options:

B: E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2
C: 2VarX + b
D: VarX - b^2
E: VarX + 2bVarX
F: VarX + bE(X)
G: b^2
H: VarX + b^2
I: 2bVarX + b^2
J: VarX

Okay, so I have this question about finding the variance of a random variable X plus some constant b. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you add a constant to a random variable, it doesn't change the variance. Because variance measures the spread, not the location, so shifting everything by a constant should leave it the same.

Wait, but I should double-check this. Let me recall the formula. Variance is Var(X + b). Since Var(X + c) = Var(X) for any constant c, right? Because adding a constant shifts the distribution but doesn't affect the spread. So the variance should just be the same as Var(X).

Looking at the options, option J is just VarX. That seems correct. Let me make sure none of the other options make sense. Option A has 2bE(X), which doesn't look right. Option B is for variance of a sample, like (sum of squares minus average squared) over n-1, but that's not variance in general. Option C is 2VarX + b, which doesn't fit. Option D looks like the formula for variance of sum of two variables, but in this case, it's just adding a constant. So Var(aX + b) would involve a^2 VarX, but here a is 1, so that's just VarX. But wait, option D is E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2, which is VarX. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, option D is E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2, which is VarX, but the question is about Var(X + b). So that's not the same. So option D is for Var(X), but the question is about Var(X + b). So option D is incorrect.

Option E is VarX + 2bVarX, which would be VarX multiplied by (1 + 2b), which doesn't make sense. Unless VarX is zero, but that's not necessarily the case. Option F is VarX + bE(X). That doesn't seem right because adding a constant shouldn't affect the variance. Option G is b squared, which is unrelated. Option H is VarX + b squared. Again, adding a constant doesn't change the variance, so this is wrong. Option I is 2bVarX + b squared. Again, adding a constant doesn't change the variance. Option J is just VarX, which aligns with what I thought earlier.

So the correct answer must be J.
</think>

The variance of a random variable \( X + b \) where \( X \) has variance \( \text{Var}(X) \) and \( b \) is a constant is simply \( \text{Var}(X) \), since adding a constant does not affect the variance. 

Analyzing the options, only option J matches this result. 

Answer: J
