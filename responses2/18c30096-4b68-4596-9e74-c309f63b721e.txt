Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question. Let me read it again.

The question is about when children start using rehearsal, elaboration, and organization as memory strategies. It asks what the last character of the answer should be. The options are from A to J, each representing a time range.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that early childhood is when kids develop various memory strategies. I think the key here is to recall the timeline of when these strategies become more prominent.

So, the options are:

A: 18-20
B: 5-7
C: 13-15
D: 10-12
E: 3-4
F: 11-12
G:7-8
H:9-10
I:2-3
J:15-17

I'm trying to remember when exactly these strategies start. I think the basic memory techniques like chunking and vowel associations begin around when kids are about 5 to 7 years old. Then as they get older, elaboration and rehearsal are used more.

Wait, elaboration is more about expanding on information, like connecting it to other things. Rehearsal is about recalling information, so maybe that's a bit later. But I think the primary strategies like rehearsal and elaboration become prominent around the late teens or early twenties.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. I remember that in the early 2000s, there was a lot of research on how kids develop these strategies. I think the stages are a bit different. For example, in the first years, they use simple strategies like reciting facts, but as they get older, elaboration and organization become more important.

I think elaboration starts when kids are around 6 to 10 years old. And when they start organizing their thoughts, that might be around 10 to 12. So perhaps the use of all three strategies (rehearsal, elaboration, organization) happens around that time.

Looking at the options, option D is 10-12, which seems to fit that. But wait, option J is 15-17. I'm a bit confused because some sources say that these strategies become more prominent as kids get older, maybe around 13-15 or 10-12.

Wait, I found a source once that said that the use of elaboration and organization as memory strategies becomes more prominent around 10-12 years of age. So, for example, a study might have shown that by 5 to 7, kids start using these strategies, but elaboration peaks around 10-12. So the question is about when they use all three.

So the answer should be the middle option, which is D:10 to 12. Alternatively, option F is 11-12, which is a subset of D. But the question is about the last character of the answer. So if the correct range is 10-12, the last letter would be '2'. But let me check the options again.

Wait, no. The answer options are letter ranges, but the options are letter A to J, each being a description, not a number. So the correct letter would be D:10-12. So the last character is '2', but wait the question says the last character of the answer must be the letter chosen. So the letter is D, which ends with '2' as the last character.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. So the correct answer is the letter that corresponds to the correct time range. So if the correct time is 10-12, the letter is D. So the answer is D, whose last character is '2'. So the answer is D and the last letter is 2.

Alternatively, maybe the time is 13-15, which is option C. Let me think about when elaboration and organization become more prominent.

I remember that elaboration (expanding on information) is a strategy that might start around when kids are 8 years old. And organization, like using cues or mental models, might begin around 10-12. So perhaps the use of these three strategies together is around 10-12. So the correct answer is D:10-12, whose last letter is '2'.

Wait, but I've also heard that the use of elaboration and organization becomes prominent in second and third grade. So maybe 10-12 is correct.

So the answer should be D:10-12, and the last character is 2. But the question says the last character of the answer must be the letter chosen. So the letter is D, which ends with '2' as the last character.

The correct answer is D: 10 to 12. This corresponds to the time when children begin to use rehearsal, elaboration, and organization as memory strategies. The last character of this option is '2'. 

Answer: D
