Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangle where the length is 3x inches and the width is x + 5 inches. The key thing is that the area and the perimeter of this rectangle are equal. I need to find the value of x from the given options. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So in this case, the area would be 3x multiplied by (x + 5). Let me write that down: Area = 3x*(x + 5). 

Next, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So for this rectangle, the perimeter would be 2*(3x) + 2*(x + 5). Let me simplify that: 2*3x is 6x, and 2*(x +5) is 2x +10. So the perimeter becomes 6x + 2x +10, which simplifies to 8x +10.

Now, according to the problem, the area and perimeter are equal. So I can set the two expressions equal to each other: 3x*(x +5) = 8x +10.

Let me write that equation out: 3x(x +5) = 8x +10. I need to solve for x. Let me expand the left side first. 3x times x is 3x², and 3x times 5 is 15x. So the equation becomes 3x² +15x = 8x +10.

Now, I'll bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 8x and 10 from both sides. So, 3x² +15x -8x -10 = 0. Simplify the like terms: 15x minus 8x is 7x. So the equation becomes 3x² +7x -10 = 0.

Hmm, now I have a quadratic equation: 3x² +7x -10 =0. I need to solve this quadratic for x. I can try factoring, but I'm not sure if this factors nicely. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to (3)*(-10) = -30 and add up to 7. 

Looking for factors of -30 that add up to 7. Let's think: 10 and -3: 10*(-3)= -30, and 10 + (-3)=7. Yes, that works. So I can rewrite the middle term using these numbers.

So the equation becomes 3x² +10x -3x -10 =0. Group these terms: (3x² +10x) + (-3x -10)=0. Factor each group: x(3x +10) -1(3x +10)=0. So now, I can factor out the common term (3x +10), giving (x -1)(3x +10)=0.

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions: x -1 =0 → x=1, and 3x +10=0 → x= -10/3.

But since x is a length in the context of inches, it must be positive. So x can't be negative. Therefore, x=1 is the valid solution.

Wait, but let me check the options given. Looking back, option F is 1, so that should be the answer. However, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me plug x=1 back into the original expressions. The length is 3x=3*1=3 inches. The width is x+5=1+5=6 inches. The area is 3*6=18 square inches. The perimeter is 2*(3+6)=2*9=18 inches. Yep, both area and perimeter are 18, so it checks out.

Alternatively, just to be thorough, let me check one of the other options to ensure I didn't overlook something. For example, option B is 5/2, which is 2.5. Let's see if that works.

If x=2.5, then the length is 3*(2.5)=7.5 inches, and the width is 2.5+5=7.5 inches. So it's a square in this case. The area would be 7.5*7.5=56.25 square inches. The perimeter is 2*(7.5 +7.5)=2*15=30 inches. 56.25 is not equal to 30, so that's not a solution. So x=2.5 is incorrect.

Another option, say, option D: x=3. Let's see, length is 3*3=9, width is 3+5=8. Area is 9*8=72, perimeter is 2*(9+8)=2*17=34. Not equal. So D is out.

Option E: x=3/2, which is 1.5. Then the length is 3*(1.5)=4.5, width is 1.5+5=6.5. Area is 4.5*6.5=29.25, perimeter is 2*(4.5+6.5)=2*11=22. Not equal. So E is incorrect.

Option H: x=4, length is 12, width is 9. Area is 12*9=108. Perimeter is 2*(12+9)=2*21=42. Not equal.

Option I: x=5, length is 15, width is 10. Area is 150, perimeter is 50. Not equal.

Option J: x=2, length is 6, width is7. Area is42, perimeter is26. Not equal.

So the only correct answer among the options is x=1, which is option F.

The problem involves a rectangle with length \(3x\) inches and width \(x + 5\) inches, where the area equals the perimeter. Setting up the equations, area \(= 3x(x + 5)\) and perimeter \(= 8x + 10\), leads to \(3x^2 + 15x = 8x + 10\). Simplifying gives \(3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0\). Factoring yields \((x - 1)(3x + 10) = 0\), giving \(x = 1\) as the valid solution.

**Answer:** F: 1
