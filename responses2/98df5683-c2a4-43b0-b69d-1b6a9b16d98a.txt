Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which country invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015. The options are China, India, Chile, the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, Australia, South Africa, and Brazil. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should probably remember what each country's situation was in 2015 regarding renewable energy. I'm a bit rusty, so I'll try to think through each one.

Starting with China. I recall that China is a big renewable energy leader, especially in solar and wind. They've been promoting the use of renewable energy for a long time, and I think they've had significant investments. Maybe around 30% of their GDP? Or perhaps more? I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers, so I might have to think more.

India, on the other hand, I'm less certain. I think India is a big renewable energy nation, but I'm not sure how much they've invested in 2015. They might have some solar and wind projects, but I'm not certain if their share was as large as China's.

Chile has been a renewable energy hub. I remember reading that they've been investing a lot in solar and wind. But I'm not sure about the exact percentage. Maybe around 20-30%? Not sure.

The United States is known for a lot of renewable energy projects. They've been investing a lot in wind and solar. I think they've increased their share significantly, maybe more than 30%? I'm not certain though. I'm trying to remember if they had a large share in 2015.

Looking at Japan, I don't think they've made a lot of wind or solar installations in 2015. They might have had some, but I'm not sure if that's a large portion of their GDP.

Canada, Germany, Australia, South Africa, and Brazil have larger economies, but I'm not sure about their specific investments in renewable energy in 2015. I think Canada might have had some, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think China was the top in renewable energy, but I'm not sure if it was 30% or higher. Also, I need to compare all of them. Let me think again.

China's renewable energy investment in 2015: I think it was around 30-35% of GDP. That's a significant portion. India's investment might have been higher, maybe around 25-30%. Chile had about 20-30%. The US's share was higher, perhaps 40-50%. 

Wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Let me try to think of the actual numbers. I remember that in 2015, the United States had increased its share of renewable energy. They had 40% of their energy from solar and wind, which might mean higher than China.

So, in 2015, the U.S. had the largest investment in renewable energy. That would mean the correct answer is D: United States.

The correct answer is D: United States.
