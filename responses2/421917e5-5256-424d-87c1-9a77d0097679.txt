Okay, so I've got this question about impedance in a circuit. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that 100∠0° V causes a current of 7.07 + j7.07 A. I need to find the impedance from the given options.

Wait, impedance is calculated using Z = V / I. Oh right, because impedance is the ratio of voltage to current. So I'll need to compute that.

The voltage is given as 100∠0° V. That means the magnitude is 100 volts and the angle is 0°, so the vector is 100 along the real axis on the complex plane. So in complex form, that's 100 + j0.

The current is 7.07 + j7.07 A. That's a complex number. Let me think about its magnitude. The magnitude is sqrt(7.07² +7.07²). Since 7.07 is approximately sqrt(50), because 7^2 is 49, 7.07 is sqrt(50). So each term is sqrt(50), adding them squared would be 50 +50 =100, so square root is 10. So the current's magnitude is 10 A.

Wait, another way: 7.07 is approximately 10/sqrt(2), since sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 10/1.414 is about 7.07. So yes, each component is 10/sqrt(2), so when squared and added, it's 2*( (100)/2 ) = 100. So sqrt(100) is 10. So the current is 10 A at 45 degrees, since both the real and imaginary parts are positive. So the current can be written as 10∠45°, which is 10*(cos45 + j sin45) or 10*(sqrt(2)/2 + j sqrt(2)/2 ) → but in complex form, 10*(0.707 + 0.707j) ≈ 7.07 + 7.07j A.

Now, the impedance Z is V divided by I. So Z = (100 + 0j) / (7.07 +7.07 j).

Wait, another way to compute this is to divide 100 by 10, which gives 10. Because V is 100 V, and I is 10 A. So the magnitude of Z is 10 ohms.

But since the current is at 45 degrees (because both 7.07 are equal), and the voltage is along the real axis, the angle of Z will be the negative of the current's angle. Because V is along real and I is at 45 degrees, so the phase shift is 45 degrees. So Z has a magnitude of 10, and angle -45 degrees.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. If current is 7.07 + j7.07, that's 10∠45°. So current I = 10∠45°, V=100∠0°.

So Z = V / I = (100 /10) ∠ (0° -45°) = 10∠-45°. 

What's 10∠-45° in rectangular form? The real part is 10*cos(-45°), which is 10*(sqrt(2)/2) ≈ 7.07. The imaginary part is 10*sin(-45°) which is -7.07.

So Z is 7.07 - j7.07. Looking at the options, H is 7.07 - j7.07. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but let me check each option again.

Option H: 7.07 - j7.07 → which is Z = 7.07 - 7.07j.

Option B is 10 - j35, which would have a magnitude of sqrt(10^2 +35^2)=sqrt(100+1225)=sqrt(1325)=approx 36.4. So no, that's not our case.

Option J is 10 - j7, which is a much smaller magnitude. Option E is 7.07 +j7.07, which is the current, so that would be the impedance of the current, but impedance is V/I, not current. So E is the current, not the impedance.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine the impedance \( Z \) of the circuit, we use the formula \( Z = \frac{V}{I} \), where \( V \) is the voltage and \( I \) is the current. 

The voltage is given as \( 100\angle 0^\circ \, \text{V} \), which corresponds to a complex number \( 100 + 0j \, \text{V} \). The current is given as \( 7.07 + j7.07 \, \text{A} \), which can be expressed in polar form as \( 10\angle 45^\circ \, \text{A} \). 

The magnitude of \( Z \) is calculated as:
\[
|Z| = \frac{|V|}{|I|} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \, \Omega.
\]

The phase angle of \( Z \) is the negative of the phase angle of \( I \), because \( V \) is along the real axis and \( I \) is at \( 45^\circ \). Thus, the phase angle of \( Z \) is \( -45^\circ \). Converting this to rectangular form:
\[
Z = 10\cos(-45^\circ) + j10\sin(-45^\circ) = 7.07 - j7.07 \, \Omega.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is \( 7.07 - j7.07 \, \Omega \), which corresponds to option H.
