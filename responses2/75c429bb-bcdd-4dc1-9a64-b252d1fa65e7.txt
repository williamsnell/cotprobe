Okay, so I've got this problem here about selecting 3 students from a class of 20 to form a study group. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. 

Alright, the question is asking about the number of ways to choose 3 students. So this sounds like a combination problem because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter. Like, if I pick student A, B, C, that's the same as picking B, A, C. So combinations are the way to go.

The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)!). In this case, n is 20 because there are 20 students, and k is 3 because we're selecting 3 people.

So plugging in the numbers, it's 20! divided by (3! times 17!). Wait, 20 factorial is a huge number, but when I compute it, a lot of the terms will cancel out. Let me try to simplify that.

20! is 20 × 19 × 18 × 17! So when I divide by 17!, those terms cancel out. That leaves me with (20 × 19 × 18) divided by (3!). 

What's 3!? That's 3 × 2 × 1, which is 6.

So now I have (20 × 19 × 18) / 6. Let's compute that step by step.

First, 20 multiplied by 19 is 380. Then, 380 multiplied by 18. Let me see, 380 × 18: 380 × 10 is 3800, 380 ×8 is 3040. So 3800 + 3040 = 6840.

Now, divide 6840 by 6. 6 × 1140 = 6840, so that's 1140.

So the number of ways is 1140. Looking back at the options, option B is 1140. So the answer should be B.

To determine the number of ways to select 3 students from a class of 20, we use combinations since the order of selection doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:

n choose k = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

Here, n = 20 and k = 3, so:

20! / (3! * 17!) = (20 × 19 × 18) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 1140.

The correct answer is B: 1140.

Answer: B
