Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says to simplify the expression (k - 3)/2 plus 3k + 1 plus (3k + 1)/2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I should probably write down the entire expression to see it clearly. It's (k - 3)/2 + 3k + 1 + (3k +1)/2. So let's write that out:

[(k - 3)/2] + [3k + 1] + [(3k +1)/2]

I think the first thing I should do is combine the terms that have the same denominator. Here, the first and third terms both have a denominator of 2. So maybe I can add those together first.

Let me combine (k - 3)/2 and (3k +1)/2. To do that, I add the numerators:

(k - 3) + (3k +1) all over 2.

So that's (k -3 + 3k +1) / 2. Let me simplify the numerator:

k + 3k = 4k, and -3 +1 is -2. So that gives 4k -2 over 2. Wait, 4k/2 is 2k, and -2/2 is -1. So that's 2k -1.

Wait, wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check that. (k - 3) + (3k +1) = k +3k =4k; -3 +1= -2. So yes, (4k -2)/2 is 2k -1. Okay, so the first and third terms combined give 2k -1.

Now, the second term is 3k +1. So the entire expression becomes (2k -1) + (3k +1). Let me add those together.

2k +3k is 5k, and -1 +1 is 0. So that leaves 5k. 

Wait, but let me check if I did that right. So (2k -1) plus (3k +1) is 2k +3k =5k, and -1 +1 =0. So yes, it's 5k.

Hmm, but wait another thought. Did I correctly combine the terms? Let me go back through the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, group the terms with denominator 2:

[(k -3)/2 + (3k +1)/2] + 3k +1.

Combine the numerators: (k -3 +3k +1) = (k +3k) =4k, (-3 +1)= -2. So (4k -2)/2 = 2k -1.

Then, add 3k +1: 2k -1 +3k +1.

2k +3k is 5k, and -1 +1 is 0, so 5k. Okay, so the simplified expression is 5k.

Looking back at the options, option C is 5k +1, option I is 2k +2, etc. So 5k is option C. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in combining the terms. Alternatively, maybe I should combine all terms before adding.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should combine all the fractions first. Let me try that.

The expression is (k -3)/2 +3k +1 + (3k +1)/2.

I can rewrite the whole expression as:

[(k -3)/2] + [(3k +1)/2] +3k +1.

Now, combining the two fractions:

[(k -3) + (3k +1)] /2 = (k -3 +3k +1)/2 = (4k -2)/2 = 2k -1.

So, adding that to 3k +1: 2k -1 +3k +1 =5k +0=5k.

So same answer. So the simplified expression is 5k, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recheck. Maybe I should check the arithmetic again.

Wait, (k -3) + (3k +1) =k +3k =4k, -3 +1= -2. So numerator is 4k-2. Divide by 2: (4k-2)/2 = 2k -1.

Then adding 3k +1: 2k -1 +3k +1.

2k +3k =5k; -1 +1=0. So 5k. So yes, that seems correct.

So the correct answer is option C:5k.

The expression simplifies to 5k, so the correct answer is C: 5k.
