Alright, so I've got this question about inventory insurance for Harrison's Bookstore. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Okay, let's read the question again.

The store has an estimated inventory value of $500,000. They want to insure 70% of that. The insurance company charges $0.50 per $100 of coverage. I need to find out the annual premium they'll pay.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should calculate 70% of $500,000 to find out how much they're insuring. Let me do that math. 70% of 500k is 70 * 500,000 divided by 100. Wait, 70% is the same as 0.7, so 0.7 * 500,000 = 350,000. So they're insuring $350,000 worth of inventory.

Next, the insurance rate is $0.50 per $100. So I need to figure out how much they're paying per $100 of coverage. Since they're covering $350,000, I can find out how many $100 units are in that. 

Wait, 350,000 divided by 100 is 3,500. So there are 3,500 units of $100 each in the insured amount. But the insurance rate is $0.50 per $100, so each $100 unit costs $0.50. So the total premium would be 3,500 * $0.50.

Let me calculate that. 3,500 * 0.5 is 1,750. So the annual premium is $1,750. Looking at the options, option C is $1,750. So the answer should be C.

The annual premium Harrison's Bookstore will pay is calculated as follows:

1. **Determine the insured value**: 70% of $500,000 = $350,000.
2. **Calculate the number of $100 units**: $350,000 / $100 = 3,500 units.
3. **Compute the premium**: 3,500 units * $0.50/unit = $1,750.

The correct answer is **C: $1,750**.
