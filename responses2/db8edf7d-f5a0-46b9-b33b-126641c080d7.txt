Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about nitrous acid, HNO2, which has a pKa of 3.3. They've given a solution where the pH is 4.2. I need to figure out what the concentration of the conjugate acid and base pair tells us. The options are A through I, each comparing [HNO2], [NO2-], and [H2NO2+], which I think is H+ and NO2^- maybe? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh, wait, H2NO2+ sounds like hydronium ion, H3O+? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's H+ and H2NO2+? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the acid dissociation.

So, nitrous acid is a weak acid. When it dissociates, it produces H+ and NO2^- as the conjugate base. So the dissociation can be written as:

HNO2 ↔ H+ + NO2^-

The pKa is 3.3, which means that at pH 3.3, the acid is half dissociated. Since the pH of the solution is 4.2, which is higher than the pKa, the solution is more basic than the pKa suggests. So the acid isn't fully dissociated; some molecules remain undissociated, and some dissociate into H+ and NO2^-.

In a solution, the concentration of the acid (HNO2) and its conjugate base (NO2^-) will be in a certain ratio determined by the pH and the pKa. I remember that the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates pH, pKa, and the ratio of [base]/[acid]. The equation is:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

Wait, but wait, in the equation, the base is the conjugate base, and the acid is the cation. Let me make sure I have the equation right. So the Henderson equation is:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Where A^- is the conjugate base, and HA is the acid. So in this case, [A^-] is NO2^- and [HA] is HNO2.

The given pKa is 3.3, and the pH is 4.2. Let me plug those into the equation.

4.2 = 3.3 + log([NO2^-]/[HNO2])

Subtracting 3.3 from both sides gives 0.9 = log([NO2^-]/[HNO2])

To solve for the ratio, I can take 10^0.9. Let me calculate that. 10^0.9 is approximately 7.94. So [NO2^-]/[HNO2] ≈ 7.94.

This means that the concentration of NO2^- is about 8 times higher than HNO2. So [NO2^-] > [HNO2], which would mean the acid (HNO2) is in a higher concentration than its conjugate base (NO2^-).

Wait, but the options are about the relationship between [HNO2], [H2NO2+], and [NO2^-]. Wait, what's H2NO2+? Oh, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be H+ and NO2^-, or maybe H2O2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the notation is off. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the acid and its conjugate base, and the options are comparing [HNO2] and [H2NO2+], which might not be standard notation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the acid dissociation, so H+ is a proton, so perhaps [H2NO2+] isn't the correct term. Alternatively, perhaps H2NO2+ is a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogen peroxide-related term, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps this is a different species, like the conjugate acid of H2O2, which is H2O2+ (hydrogen peroxide ion). So H2O2+ would be the conjugate acid of H2O2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are comparing [H2NO2+] and [HNO2] in the context of H+ and NO2^-.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the acid (HNO2) and its conjugate base (NO2^-), but some of them are written as [H2NO2+] and [HNO2]. Hmm, perhaps the correct terms are H2NO2+ and NO2^-.

Wait, let me think. The dissociation of HNO2 is:

HNO2 ↔ H+ + NO2^-.

The [H+] would relate to the dissociation. The presence of H+ would mean that [H+] is higher than pKa, which is 3.3.

So, the solution's pH is 4.2, which is higher than pKa (so it's basic), so [H+] is greater than 10^-3.3 (since pH is 4.2, [H+] is 10^-4.2 ≈ 6.31e-5 M).

So, the concentration of H+ is about 6.3e-5 M. The H+ comes from both the dissociation of HNO2 and the autoionization of water.

But in solution, the main source of H+ is from HNO2 dissociation. So, the concentration of H+ is influenced by both the acid dissociation and water's contribution.

But back to the question. The options are about the relative concentrations of HNO2, NO2^-, and H2NO2+.

Wait, perhaps the options are comparing [HNO2] and [H2NO2+] or [H2NO2+], but I think I'm getting confused about the correct species here.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about the acid and its conjugate base in the acid-base pair. So, the acid is HNO2, and the base is NO2^-.

So the options are about the relative concentrations of HNO2 and NO2^-.

So, from the calculation earlier, [NO2^-] is about 7.94 times [HNO2]. So [NO2^-] is greater than [HNO2]. So, the correct statement would be that [NO2^-] > [HNO2], which is option F.

Looking at the options:

Option F is [NO2-] = [HNO2], which isn't correct.

Wait, no. Wait, in the calculation, [NO2^-] is about 8 times [HNO2], so [NO2^-] is greater.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: [NO2^-] = [HNO2] → No, because [NO2^-] is higher.

Option D: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2] → H2NO2+ is probably not a standard way to write it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's H+ and H2O2 or another species. Alternatively, perhaps the options are about [H+], [HNO2], and [NO2^-], but I need to look again.

Wait, the problem says, "the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair found in solution." The conjugate acid and base pairs are HNO2 and NO2^-.

The options are comparing [HNO2] and [NO2^-]. So, if [NO2^-] is larger than [HNO2], then option F is [NO2^-] = [HNO2], which is false. So which option says that [NO2^-] is greater than [HNO2]?

Option F is [NO2^-] = [HNO2], which is not correct. So, looking at the options:

A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-] → No, because [NO2^-] is higher.

B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-] → Hmm, what's H2NO2+? Maybe it's a typo and should be H+?

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about the acid (HNO2) and its conjugate base (NO2^-), but the options are phrased as the acid being more than the conjugate base. So, option F is [NO2^-] = [HNO2], which is incorrect. So which option is correct?

Wait, let's look again at the options.

Option A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-]. No, because [NO2^-] is higher.

Option B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-]. If this is H2O2+, which is the conjugate acid of H2O2. Not sure how this relates to the given data.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me think about the species given.

The solution has pH 4.2, pKa 3.3. So, the solution is basic. Therefore, the majority is the conjugate base, which is NO2^-.

Since pKa is lower than pH, the acid is dissociated; so [HNO2] is less than [NO2^-].

So, [HNO2] is less than [NO2^-], meaning [NO2^-] > [HNO2], which would make option F or another option incorrect.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: [NO2^-] = [HNO2] → No.

Option G: [HNO2] > [H2NO2+] → Hmm, if the options are about [H2NO2+] and [HNO2], I'm not sure what that is. Alternatively, perhaps the given options are about the acid and its conjugate base, and the H2NO2+ is a different species.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about the concentration of H2NO2+ (like a hydrogen peroxide or another species) and HNO2.

Wait, perhaps H2NO2+ is a species formed from HNO2 and water. Let me think, in the acid dissociation, HNO2 → H+ + NO2^-.

But the presence of water would also contribute H+ ions. So, the solution's H+ comes from both the dissociation of HNO2 and the autoionization of water.

But perhaps in the options, H2NO2+ is a typo, and it should be H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about the concentration of the acid (HNO2) and the conjugate base (NO2^-), but the options are comparing HNO2 and H2NO2+.

Wait, perhaps H2NO2+ is something else. Let me think: H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid of HNO2, because H2NO2+ is HNO2 + H+.

Ah, right! So, the conjugate acid of HNO2 is H2NO2+.

So, the acid is HNO2, and the conjugate acid is H2NO2+.

So, based on that, the options are about the concentrations of HNO2, H2NO2+, and NO2^-.

Wait, but the question states that the solution has a pH of 4.2, pKa 3.3. So the species in question are HNO2 and its conjugate base NO2^-.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair. So, in that case, the pair is HNO2 (acid) and NO2^- (base), and the conjugate acid is H2NO2+.

So, the options are about the concentrations of HNO2 and H2NO2+ as compared to each other and to NO2^-.

Wait, but the options given are about HNO2 and NO2^-.

Wait, let me read the options again:

Options' descriptions:

A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-] → No, because NO2^- is higher.

B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-] → H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid of HNO2. So in the acid-base system, the acid (HNO2) is lower in concentration than the conjugate base (NO2^-). So, [HNO2] < [NO2^-]. So, [H2NO2+] would be higher than [HNO2]?

Wait, no. Because H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid of HNO2. So the acid (HNO2) is lower than the conjugate base (NO2^-). So, [HNO2] < [NO2^-], which also implies that [H2NO2+] > [HNO2] because it's the conjugate acid.

Wait, perhaps the options are comparing [H2NO2+] to other species.

Wait, but according to the options, option G is [HNO2] > [H2NO2+], which would be false because HNO2 is the acid, and the conjugate acid is H2NO2+ which is higher. So, [H2NO2+] > [HNO2].

So, if [H2NO2+] is higher than [HNO2], then option G would say that, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the concentrations of the conjugate acid/base pair, which are HNO2 and NO2^-.

So, the options are:

A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-] → No.

B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-] → H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid, which in an acid-base pair is higher in concentration than its conjugate base (NO2^-). So, [H2NO2+] is greater than [NO2^-]. So, B's statement is [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-], which would be false.

Wait, but wait, the options give the concentration of H2NO2+ compared to NO2^-.

But H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid of HNO2. So, in the acid-base pair, the acid (HNO2) is lower in concentration than the conjugate base (NO2^-). So [HNO2] < [NO2^-].

So, if [H2NO2+] is the conjugate acid, then [H2NO2+] > [HNO2], because it's a stronger acid than HNO2.

So, if [H2NO2+] is the conjugate acid, then its concentration is higher than [HNO2].

Which option is that? Looking at the options:

Looking back, the options are about the concentrations of HNO2 and NO2^-.

Wait, perhaps the options are not about the acid and its conjugate base pair, but about the acid and its conjugate acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me reevaluate.

The problem is about the solution's pH, which is 4.2, a bit higher than pKa 3.3, so more basic. So, the solution is dominated by the conjugate base (NO2^-).

The options are about the concentrations of the acid (HNO2) and the conjugate base (NO2^-).

So, the main point is that [NO2^-] > [HNO2], so in the options:

Which option states that [NO2^-] is greater than [HNO2]?

Looking at the options:

A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-] → No.

B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-] → Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the H2NO2+ and HNO2. No, because the question is about the conjugate acid/base pair, which is HNO2 and NO2^-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the notation. Let me think again.

The conjugate acid of HNO2 is H2NO2+ (since HNO2 + H+ → H2NO2+).

So, the acid HNO2 has a lower concentration than its conjugate base (NO2^-). So, [HNO2] < [NO2^-]. Which would make option F: [NO2^-] = [HNO2] → false.

Now, the options are about the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair.

Wait, perhaps the options are comparing [H2NO2+] and [HNO2], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about the concentration of H2NO2+ (the conjugate acid) compared to HNO2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option G: [HNO2] > [H2NO2+] → since H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid, it's higher. So this is correct.

Option D: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2] → which is correct.

Wait, none of the options directly state that [H2NO2+] is greater than [HNO2]. Let me check the options:

Looking at the options:

G: [HNO2] > [H2NO2+], which would be incorrect because H2NO2+ is a stronger acid and thus has higher concentration.

So, which option is correct?

Another approach: The pH is 4.2, pKa 3.3.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

(4.2 -3.3) = 0.9 = log([A^-]/[HA]).

10^0.9 ≈ 7.94 → [A^-] ≈7.94 [HA].

So, [NO2^-] ≈7.94 [HNO2], which means [NO2^-] is about 8 times higher than [HNO2]. So, [NO2^-] > [HNO2].

Which option states that? Looking at the options:

A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-] → No.

B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-] → H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid. So, [H2NO2+] > [HNO2], but [H2NO2+] compared to [NO2^-]?

Wait, but [H2NO2+] is a higher concentration than [HNO2], but we don't know how it compares to [NO2^-].

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of H2NO2+ and HNO2. But the question is about the conjugate acid/base pair, which are HNO2 and NO2^-.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the concentration of the conjugate acid (H2NO2+) compared to the conjugate base (NO2^-). But that's not what the question says.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair. So, the pair is HNO2 and NO2^-.

So, in terms of their concentrations, in solution, [HNO2] and [NO2^-].

So, their concentrations are determined by the pH and pKa. The calculation I did earlier says [NO2^-] is about 8 times [HNO2], so [NO2^-] > [HNO2].

So, looking at the options, which one states that [NO2^-] > [HNO2]?

Looking again:

Option F: [NO2^-] = [HNO2] → No.

No option directly states [NO2^-] > [HNO2]. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base, but using H2NO2+ as a species.

So, the options are about HNO2 and H2NO2+.

Wait, if H2NO2+ (the conjugate acid of HNO2) is higher in concentration than HNO2, then which option says that?

Looking at the options:

G: [HNO2] > [H2NO2+] → No, because it's the conjugate acid which is higher.

D: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2] → Yes, correct.

But the options also have option F, which is [NO2^-] = [HNO2], which is not correct.

So, which option is correct? Option D: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2], which would be correct.

Wait, but the options may also be about [H2NO2+] and [HNO2]. So, perhaps I should think of the options as comparing the concentrations of the acid (HNO2) and the conjugate acid (H2NO2+) and the conjugate base (NO2^-).

But the question is specifically about the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair; perhaps the pair is HNO2 and NO2^-.

Wait, but the options are comparing HNO2 and H2NO2+, or H2NO2+ with NO2^-.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the question is about the concentration of H2NO2+ and HNO2. So, the option is about [H2NO2+] compared to [HNO2].

So, if [H2NO2+] is higher than [HNO2], then the correct option would be D: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2].

But wait, I thought earlier that [H2NO2+] is the conjugate acid, which is higher than the acid (HNO2). So, [H2NO2+] > [HNO2], which makes option D correct.

But looking back, the options are:

A: [HNO2] > [NO2^-]
B: [H2NO2+] < [NO2^-]
C: [H2NO2+] < [HNO2]
D: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2]
E: [H2NO2+] > [NO2^-]
F: [NO2^-] = [HNO2]
G: [HNO2] > [H2NO2+]

So, if [H2NO2+] is the conjugate acid, which is higher in concentration than the acid (HNO2), then option D is correct.

So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that [NO2^-] is higher than [HNO2], which would make option F incorrect. But the options are about the concentrations of H2NO2+ and HNO2, so option D states that [H2NO2+] is greater than [HNO2], which is correct.

So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that [H2NO2+] is the conjugate acid, which is higher. So, [H2NO2+] is higher than [HNO2], so option D is correct.

So, the answer is option D.

Wait, but why is option F incorrect? Let me think.

Option F: [NO2^-] = [HNO2], which is false. Because, as calculated, [NO2^-] is approximately 7.94 times [HNO2], so [NO2^-] is higher.

So, option F is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is option D: [H2NO2+] > [HNO2].

So, I think that's the correct choice.
</think>

The problem involves analyzing the concentrations of species in solution based on the given pH and pKa values. The relevant species are HNO₂ (acids) and NO₂⁻ (conjugate base). The pH of the solution is 4.2, and the pKa of HNO₂ is 3.3. Since pH > pKa, the solution is basic, and the majority of the species in solution are the conjugate base, NO₂⁻.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
4.2 - 3.3 = 0.9 = \log \left( \frac{[NO₂^-]}{[HNO₂]} \right)
\]

\[
10^{0.9} \approx 7.94 = \frac{[NO₂^-]}{[HNO₂]}
\]

Thus, \([NO₂^-] \approx 7.94 \cdot [HNO₂]\), meaning the concentration of NO₂⁻ is approximately 8 times that of HNO₂. This indicates that \([NO₂^-] > [HNO₂]\).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: [HNO₂] > [NO₂⁻]**
   - Incorrect. Since \([NO₂^-] > [HNO₂]\), this option is false.

2. **Option B: [H₂NO₂+] < [NO₂⁻]**
   - Incorrect. \([H₂NO₂+]\) is the conjugate acid of HNO₂ and is higher in concentration than HNO₂. Since \([H₂NO₂+] > [HNO₂]\), this option is false.

3. **Option C: [H₂NO₂+] < [HNO₂]**
   - Incorrect. As explained, \([H₂NO₂+] > [HNO₂]\), so this option is false.

4. **Option D: [H₂NO₂+] > [HNO₂]**
   - Correct. \([H₂NO₂+]\) is the conjugate acid of HNO₂ and is higher in concentration than HNO₂.

5. **Option E: [H₂NO₂+] > [NO₂⁻]**
   - Incorrect. Since \([NO₂^-] > [HNO₂]\), this option is false.

6. **Option F: [NO₂⁻] = [HNO₂]**
   - Incorrect. Since \([NO₂^-] \approx 7.94 \cdot [HNO₂]\), this option is false.

7. **Option G: [HNO₂] > [H₂NO₂+]**
   - Incorrect. Since \([H₂NO₂+] > [HNO₂]\), this option is false.

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **D: [H₂NO₂+] > [HNO₂]**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the concentrations of H₂NO₂+ (the conjugate acid of HNO₂) and HNO₂.

ANSWER: D
