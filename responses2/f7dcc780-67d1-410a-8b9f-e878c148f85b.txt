Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about a meter stick moving at a significant speed and the time it takes for it to pass an observer in the observer's frame. Hmm, right, I remember that when objects are moving at a high speed relative to an observer, length contraction comes into play.

Wait, the problem says the stick is moving at 0.8c. I think the speed of light is a big factor here. Oh right, the Lorentz contraction. So the stick's length in the observer's frame is shorter than its proper length. The proper length is the length measured in the stick's rest frame, which is 1 meter here. But since the stick is moving, in the observer's frame, the length is contracted.

So the formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (1m), and v is 0.8c. Let me compute that. First, v squared is (0.8c)^2 = 0.64c². So 1 - 0.64 is 0.36. The square root of 0.36 is 0.6. Oh wait wait, no, wait: 0.64 is (0.8)^2, so 1 - 0.64 is 0.36. The square root of 0.36 is 0.6. So the contracted length L is 1m * 0.6 = 0.6 meters.

Wait, but wait, what's the question again? Oh, it's asking about the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer. Oh, right, so in the observer's frame, the stick is moving, so the time is the length of the stick (as measured in that frame) divided by its speed. Because the distance is length, and speed is distance over time, so time is distance divided by speed.

So time t = L / v. L is 0.6 meters and v is 0.8c. But wait, the units: meters per second. Let's compute that. Let me think about the units. 0.6 meters divided by 0.8c. Oh, but what's the value of c? 3e8 m/s. So 0.6 / (0.8 * 3e8) = (0.6 /0.8) / 3e8. 0.6/0.8 is 0.75. So 0.75 / (3e8) = 0.25e-8 seconds. Because 0.75 divided by 3 is 0.25. So 0.25e-8 seconds is 2.5e-9 seconds, which is 2.5 nanoseconds.

Wait, but the options are all in nanoseconds. Let me check my calculations again. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the length contraction part. Let me double-check. The proper length is 1m. v is 0.8c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.8)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.64) = 1/sqrt(0.36) = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So length is L = L0 * gamma? Wait no, no, I think I got that wrong earlier. Wait length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as L0 / gamma. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma. So yes, L = L0 / gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma for v=0.8c. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.8)^2)) = 1/sqrt(1-0.64) = 1/sqrt(0.36) = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667. So L = 1m * 0.6 = 0.6 m. That seems correct.

Now, time taken is 0.6 m / (0.8c). Let's plug in numbers. 0.6 m divided by (0.8 * 3e8 m/s). 0.6 / (2.4e8) = 0.25e-8 s, which is 2.5e-9 s, which is 2.5 nanoseconds.

Looking at the options, option G is 3.0 ns, option H is 2.5 ns. So my calculation gives 2.5 ns. So the answer is H.

Wait, but wait another thing. Am I considering the time correctly? The stick is moving past the observer. So the stick is moving, and the time it takes for the whole stick to pass is the length of the stick in the observer's frame divided by its speed. So yes, that's correct. So the time should be t = L / v. And that's 2.5 ns.

So the correct answer is option H.

To determine the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer in the observer's frame, we use the concept of length contraction and the formula for time in the observer's frame.

1. **Length Contraction**: The proper length of the meter stick is \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \). In the observer's frame, the length of the stick is contracted due to its high speed (\( v = 0.8c \)). The formula for the contracted length is:
   \[
   L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.8c \), we find:
   \[
   L = 1 \, \text{m} \cdot \sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2} = 1 \, \text{m} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.64} = 1 \, \text{m} \cdot \sqrt{0.36} = 1 \, \text{m} \cdot 0.6 = 0.6 \, \text{m}.
   \]

2. **Time for the Stick to Pass**: In the observer's frame, the time it takes for the entire stick to pass is the contracted length divided by the speed of the stick:
   \[
   t = \frac{L}{v}.
   \]
   Substituting \( L = 0.6 \, \text{m} \) and \( v = 0.8c \), we calculate:
   \[
   t = \frac{0.6 \, \text{m}}{0.8 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} = \frac{0.6}{2.4 \times 10^8} = 0.25 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s} = 2.5 \, \text{ns}.
   \]

3. **Matching the Answer**: The calculation yields \( t = 2.5 \, \text{ns} \), which corresponds to option H.
