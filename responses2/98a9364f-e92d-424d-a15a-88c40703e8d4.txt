Okay, so I've got this question about Ross's prima facie duties. I remember that Ross's work is related to moral philosophy, specifically Kantian ethics, I think. So, the question is about what Ross says about these duties.

The options are A to I, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me try to recall what each option means.

Option A: "are only applicable to certain cultures." Hmm, I think Ross talked about how duties vary across cultures. Like, some duties are more important in certain cultures than others. So this might be correct.

Option B: "are determined by societal norms." I'm not sure about this. Ross might argue that duties aren't just societal norms but also about the intentions of the people involved. Like, it's more about the ethical behavior rather than just what's socially expected.

Option C: "are only valid if they align with personal beliefs." Not sure. I think Ross talked about duties being about the consequences of actions rather than personal beliefs. Like, you shouldn't do something because it aligns with your own values, not just because it's with your own beliefs.

Option D: "have no moral significance." That doesn't sound right. I think Ross said that duties are significant because they affect our moral standing and behavior.

Option E: "can be altered over time." I don't recall Ross talking about this. I think ethical duties are more stable and don't change with time. So maybe E is incorrect.

Option F: "can be proven." I'm not sure. I think Ross might discuss the nature of duties, whether they can be proven or not, but I might be mixing things up.

Option G: "cannot be known." Hmm, if it's about whether we can know our duties, I'm not certain. Ross might have some ideas on that.

Option H: "are not objective." I think Ross focused on subjective moral principles. Objective duties might be different, so this might not be correct.

Option I: "are self-evident." I'm not sure about this. I think self-evident is more related to logical truths, not duties.

So, going back to the options, A and H and I seem less likely. Option I is probably wrong. Option H is about objectivity, which I don't think Ross's duties address.

Option E was about change, which I don't think Ross talked about. So probably incorrect.

Option B is about societal norms. Ross might have thought that duties are more about the intentions and consequences of actions rather than just societal norms. So this could be a contender.

Option C suggests validity depends on personal beliefs, which I don't think Ross said. He probably emphasized that duties are about the consequences, not just personal beliefs.

So then, between A and B. The question is about whether the duties are applicable to certain cultures. I think Ross's work, particularly his "Kantian" approach, does discuss cultural context and how certain duties are more relevant to certain groups. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Ross's work, especially his "Culteral Conditions of moral Conduct" (CCOC), does consider cultural factors. So the duties vary based on the cultural context. So A would be the correct answer.

The correct answer is A: "are only applicable to certain cultures."

**Explanation:**
Ross's work, particularly his "Culteral Conditions of moral Conduct" (CCOC), emphasizes that moral duties vary across cultures. These duties are context-dependent and influenced by cultural factors, making option A accurate.
