Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the three outcomes of CSR according to Wood (1991). I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I need to remember what CSR stands for. I think it stands for Corporate Social Responsibility. It's a concept where a company contributes to the well-being of society in some way. The question is about the three outcomes, which I believe refer to the different areas or impacts that CSR has on society.

I recall that Wood's work is foundational here. Let me try to remember the key points. From what I can recall, Wood (1991) outlined three main outcomes or impacts of CSR. They probably include social policies, social issues, and social impacts.

Looking at the options, each option lists three things. The correct answer should match Wood's three outcomes.

Option A: Social policies, Social responsibility, Social impacts. Wait, Social responsibility might not be a primary outcome. Social policies are more about government or societal policies that influence CSR, so that's possible.

Option B: Social policies, Social evidencing, Social impacts. Social evidencing sounds like social research or knowledge, which might be part of the outcomes, but I'm not sure if that's the main one.

Option C: Social policies, Social audits, Social impacts. Social audits could be part of evaluating CSR, but again, I'm not certain.

Option D: Social policies, Social programmes, Social analysis. Social programmes might refer to concrete actions or initiatives, which I think are part of the outcomes.

Option E: Social evaluations, Social programmes, Social impacts. Social evaluations could be part of assessing CSR's effectiveness, but I'm not sure if that's considered an outcome itself.

Option F: Social policies, Social programmes, Social discussions. Social discussions might be more about forums or debates rather than outcomes.

Option G: Social policies, Social impacts, Social justice. Social justice is a big part of CSR because it's about contributing to fairness and equality. So this seems relevant.

Option H: Social assessments, Social programmes, Social impacts. Social assessments might be another term for evaluations, so this might not be the same as outcomes.

Option I: Social planning, Social programmes, Social impacts. Social planning could be a broader term, but perhaps plan isn't one of the three main outcomes.

Option J: Social policies, Social programmes, Social impacts. This looks familiar. I think J is the correct answer because according to Wood, the three outcomes are social policies, social programme actions, and social impacts.

Wait, let me think again. Social policies are broad, like tax changes, regulations, etc. Social programmes are specific, like environmental initiatives. Social impacts are the results, like how these actions affect society, like reducing pollution or improving health.

Yes, that makes sense. So the three would be policies (A), programme actions (D), and impacts (J). So the correct answer is option J.

The correct answer is **Option J: Social policies, Social programmes and Social impacts**.

**Explanation:**
Wood (1991) outlined three primary outcomes of CSR:
1. **Social policies**: These include government and societal policies that influence CSR initiatives.
2. **Social programmes**: These are specific actions taken by organizations to contribute to social well-being.
3. **Social impacts**: These refer to the measurable effects of CSR on society, such as environmental or health improvements.

Thus, the three outcomes are best represented by **Option J**.
