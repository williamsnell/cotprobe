Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about economics terms, specifically NNP, GNP, and capital consumption. Hmm, I remember some definitions, but I need to make sure.

The question says that the last character of the response must be the letter I choose. So whatever I answer, the last letter has to be 'I'. Let me read the question again.

The problem states: When capital consumption in an economy equals $500,000, and the GNP is $2,050,000, what is the NNP?

Wait, capital consumption... I think that's the term for what's called "private consumption" or maybe "private final consumption." Oh right, capital consumption refers to the value of goods and services that are consumed by the final users, excluding intermediate goods. But wait, maybe that's the same as NNP? Or is it different.

Wait, no. I think NNP stands for Net National Product. And GNP is Gross National Product. Oh right! NNP is GNP minus capital consumption. So, NNP = GNP - capital consumption.

Wait, but I should double-check. So, GNP is the total value of all goods and services produced by the country's residents during a specific period, regardless of when the goods are produced. NNP, or Net National Product, is the total value of all goods and services produced by a country's residents during a specific period, minus the value of all intermediate goods and services used in the production.

Wait, but sometimes capital consumption is also referred to as intermediate consumption. So, wait, maybe capital consumption is the value of intermediate goods, so NNP is GNP minus that. Alternatively, sometimes NNP is GNP minus taxes, which is another definition I've heard before.

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact definitions. GNP is the total value of all goods and services produced by a nation. NNP is the total value of goods and services that a country's residents own and produce. So, NNP is GNP minus the value of intermediate goods and services used in the production of goods and services owned by the country's residents. Wait, but is capital consumption synonymous with that?

Alternatively, capital consumption refers to the value of final goods and services consumed by the final users, which is the same as NNP. So, NNP = GNP - capital consumption.

But wait, another perspective. I think that in some definitions, NNP is equal to GNP minus intermediate consumption (i.e., the value of goods that are used in the production process but not owned by the final users). So, if that's the case, then NNP = GNP - intermediate consumption.

But wait, when I think of NNP, is it the same as the value of goods and services that are used by the final users? So perhaps NNP is the same as GNP minus intermediate consumption. But wait, another way to think is that NNP is equal to GNP minus taxes and other non-direct spending.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. GNP is the total value of goods and services produced by the country's residents, without considering taxes or the government. NNP is the value of goods and services that a country's residents own and are producing. So, NNP equals GNP minus the value of intermediate goods and services.

But maybe another approach. I think that in some definitions, NNP is equal to GNP minus the value of all goods and services that are purchased by intermediate users (like the private final consumers). So, perhaps NNP is the same as GNP minus capital consumption.

Wait, the question states that capital consumption is $500,000, and GNP is $2,050,000. So, if NNP is GNP minus capital consumption, that would be 2,050,000 minus 500,000, which is 1,550,000. But wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option E is $1,550,000. But wait, another possibility is that NNP is equal to GNP minus taxes, or perhaps other factors. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering "capital consumption" as the value of intermediate consumption.

Wait, to clarify, let's think about the definitions more precisely. Capital consumption refers to the value of goods and services that are used in the production of other goods and services, but these are not owned by the final users. So, NNP is GNP minus capital consumption.

So, NNP = GNP - (Capital Consumption). Here, Capital Consumption is $500,000. GNP is $2,050,000.

So, NNP = 2,050,000 - 500,000 = 1,550,000. Which is option E.

But wait, looking back at the options, option E is $1,550,000. So that would be the answer. But wait, the options also include some other numbers. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 2,100,000

B: 1,950,000

C: 1,500,000

D: 2,500,000

E: 1,550,000

F: 2,550,000

G: 1,450,000

H: 1,750,000

I: 2,000,000

J: 1,600,000

So, the correct answer would be E, $1,550,000.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: sometimes, the term "capital consumption" refers to the value of goods and services that are consumed by the private final consumers (like the people in the country). So, perhaps NNP is calculated as GNP minus that value.

But that's the same as what I thought earlier. So, if GNP is 2,050,000 and capital consumption is 500,000, then NNP is 1,550,000, which is E.

But wait, another possibility is that NNP is calculated as GNP minus taxes. But the question doesn't mention taxes. Hmm.

Wait, I think the answer is E. So the correct option is E.
</think>

The question asks for the NNP given that capital consumption is $500,000 and GNP is $2,050,000. NNP is calculated as GNP minus capital consumption. 

Calculating:
\[ \text{NNP} = \text{GNP} - \text{Capital Consumption} \]
\[ \text{NNP} = \$2,050,000 - \$500,000 = \$1,550,000 \]

Checking the options, the correct answer is E: $1,550,000.

Answer: E
