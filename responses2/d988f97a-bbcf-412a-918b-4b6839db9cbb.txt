Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a group of students were invited to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). The ability to taste PTC is an inherited trait, and tasting (T) is dominant to not tasting (t). So, the dominant trait is taste, and the recessive is not. The students are 798 in total, and 60.4% of them are tasters. So, part a is about finding the allelic frequency of T and t, and part b is about determining how many students are TT, Tt, and tt.

Alright, starting with part a. Allelic frequency refers to the frequency (percentage) of a particular allele in the population. Since T is dominant, the frequency of T would be higher than the frequency of t. The total number of students is 798, and 60.4% are tasters. So, the number of tasters is 60.4% of 798. Let me calculate that.

60.4% of 798 is 0.604 * 798. Let me compute that. 0.6 * 798 is 478.8, and 0.004 *798 is about 3.192. Adding those gives 478.8 +3.192 = 481.992, so approximately 482 students are tasters.

But wait, since the total is 798, the number of non-tasters would be 798 - 482. So, 798-482 = 316 non-tasters. 

Now, the total number of alleles each person has is two. So, the total alleles are 798 * 2 = 1596.

The number of T alleles would be (number of tasters)*2 + (number of non-tasters)*0. Wait, no: each taster has at least one T allele. Since T is dominant, each non-taster has two t alleles.

So, the number of T alleles = (number of tasters * 2) + (number of non-tasters * 0). Because the non-tasters don't have T alleles.

So, number of T alleles = 482 * 2 = 964. Then, the frequency of T would be 964 / 1596.

Let me calculate that. 964 divided by 1596. Hmm, let's see. Let me compute 964 ÷ 1596.

Well, 1596 ÷ 2 is 798, so 964 is 798 * 1.217 roughly. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the exact division.

Let me compute 964 ÷ 1596.

Let's see: Both are even, so divide numerator and denominator by 2: 482 / 798.

Hmm, 482 and 798. Do they have any common factors? Let's see. 798 ÷ 482 is about 1.65. 482 ÷ 2=241, which is a prime number. Let me check if 241 divides 798. 241 *3 is 723, 241 *3.3 is about 795.3, so 241*3.31 ≈ 798. So 798=241*3.31. Hmm, 241 is a prime, so 482/798 = 241/399. So, the frequency of T is 241/399.

Wait, 241/399 is approximately 0.604, which is 60.4%. That makes sense because 60.4% of the students are tasters. So, the frequency of T is 60.4%, and t is 39.6% (because 100% -60.4% =39.6%).

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check because the question asks for the allelic frequency, which is the proportion of the gene pool. So, the frequency of T is the proportion of T alleles in the entire population, which is 964/1596. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, another way: the frequency of T is also equal to the square root of the frequency of the phenotype that is expressed. Wait, but that's for a completely dominant condition. Since T is dominant, the frequency of T is sqrt(p) where p is the frequency of the dominant phenotype. Let me see, but I think that approach might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute p as the frequency of the dominant trait.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Hardy-Weinberg equation. For a completely dominant trait, the genotype frequencies are:

p^2 (TT), 2pq (Tt), q^2 (tt)

But wait, in this scenario, the dominant trait (taster) is expressed when at least one T is present. So, the frequency of the dominant phenotype (T) would be p^2 + 2pq, where p is the frequency of T, and q is the frequency of t.

Wait, but p is the frequency of T alleles, which is 0.604. So, q is 0.396. The frequency of the dominant phenotype (T) is p^2 + 2pq. Let's plug in the numbers.

p = 0.604

So, p^2 = (0.604)^2 = 0.364816

2pq = 2 * 0.604 * 0.396 = 2 * 0.238184 = 0.476368

So, total for T phenotype is 0.364816 + 0.476368 = 0.841184, which is about 84.1184%. But wait, the question says that 60.4% are tasters. That doesn't match. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem says that 60.4% are tasters, so the frequency of the dominant phenotype (T) is 60.4%. So, in that case, perhaps using the formula for when the dominant phenotype is at 60.4%, so p^2 + 2pq = 0.604.

But we also know that p + q =1. So, q = 1 - p.

So, let's substitute q =1-p into the equation.

p^2 + 2p(1-p) = 0.604

p^2 + 2p - 2p^2 =0.604

-p^2 + 2p = 0.604

Multiply both sides by -1:

p^2 - 2p = -0.604

p^2 -2p +0.604=0

So, quadratic equation: p^2 -2p +0.604=0

Solving: p = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4*1*0.604) ] / 2

Compute sqrt(4 - 2.416) = sqrt(1.584) ≈1.258.

So, p = [2 ±1.258]/2.

We have two solutions:

(2 +1.258)/2 = 3.258/2 =1.629, which can't be because p can't be >1.

(2-1.258)/2= 0.742/2=0.371.

So, p=0.371, q=0.629.

So, the frequency of T is 37.1%, and t is 62.9%. Which matches option A, which says T is 37.1% and t is 62.9%.

Wait, but wait, that's different from the initial calculation I did earlier. So, what's going on here?

Ah, I think in the initial approach, I was probably thinking about the number of T alleles, but perhaps that's not the right approach if the question is about the frequency of the phenotype. So, perhaps using the Hardy-Weinberg approach is the correct way.

So, the correct answer would be p=0.371, q=0.629.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, earlier I thought that 60.4% are tasters, which is the same as the frequency of the phenotype. So, using the Hardy-Weinberg formula correctly should give us the correct p and q.

So, the correct answer is option A: frequency of T is 37.1%, t is 62.9%.

Wait, but looking back, I think in part a, the question says to calculate the allelic frequency of T and t. So, in that case, the correct answer is option A.

Now, part b: How many students are TT, Tt, tt?

In the Hardy-Weinberg model, the genotype frequencies are p², 2pq, q².

Given p=0.371, q=0.629.

So, TT = p² = (0.371)^2 = 0.137641.

Tt =2pq= 2*(0.371)*(0.629) = 2*(0.234359)=0.468718.

tt= q²=0.629^2=0.395641.

Now, the total number of students is 798. So, the number of each genotype is:

TT: 0.137641 *798 ≈ 798 *0.137641.

Hmm, let me compute that.

0.137641 *798.

Well, 0.1 *798=79.8, 0.03*798=23.94, 0.007641*798≈5.95.

Adding: 79.8 +23.94=103.74; 103.74 +5.95≈109.69. So about 109.7, which rounds to 110. But looking at the options, option A says 109 TT, 373 Tt, 316 tt.

Wait, let me compute exact numbers.

Option A: TT = 0.137641 *798.

Compute 0.137641 *798.

798 *0.1 =79.8; 798 *0.03=23.94; 798*0.007641 ≈5.95.

Adding 79.8 +23.94 =103.74; 103.74 +5.95=109.69.

So approximately 109.69. So 109 or 110 students. The option A has 109 TT. So that's correct.

Tt: 0.468718 *798.

Compute 798 *0.468718.

Hmm, 798 *0.4 = 319.2; 798 *0.06=47.88; 798 *0.008718≈6.93.

So, 319.2 +47.88 =367.08; 367.08 +6.93=374.01. So about 374. So, option A says 373, which is close.

tt: 0.395641 *798.

Compute:

798 *0.3=239.4; 798 *0.09=71.82; 798 *0.005641≈4.49.

So 239.4 +71.82=311.22; 311.22 +4.49=315.71. So about 316. Option A says tt is 316, which matches.

So, option A is correct.

Looking back at the options, option A's description is: Number of students with TT is 109, Tt is 373, tt is 316.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by determining the allelic frequency of T and t. The total number of taster students is 60.4% of 798, which is approximately 482 students. The remaining 316 students are non-tasters. Since the T allele is dominant, the frequency of T alleles is calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of T alleles} = 482 \times 2 = 964
\]

The total number of alleles in the population is:

\[
798 \times 2 = 1596
\]

Thus, the frequency of T alleles is:

\[
\text{Frequency of T} = \frac{964}{1596} \approx 0.604 \quad \text{(60.4%)}
\]

The frequency of t alleles is:

\[
\text{Frequency of t} = 1 - 0.604 = 0.396 \quad \text{(39.6%)}
\]

Next, we use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine the genotype frequencies. The equation is:

\[
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
\]

where \( p \) is the frequency of T (0.371) and \( q \) is the frequency of t (0.629). The genotype frequencies are:

- \( \text{TT} = p^2 = (0.371)^2 \approx 0.137641 \)
- \( \text{Tt} = 2pq = 2 \times 0.371 \times 0.629 \approx 0.468718 \)
- \( \text{tt} = q^2 = (0.629)^2 \approx 0.395641 \)

The total number of students is 798, so the number of each genotype is:

- \( \text{TT} = 0.137641 \times 798 \approx 109.69 \approx 109 \)
- \( \text{Tt} = 0.468718 \times 798 \approx 374.01 \approx 373 \)
- \( \text{tt} = 0.395641 \times 798 \approx 315.71 \approx 316 \)

Thus, the correct answer matches **Option A**, which states:

- Frequency of T: 37.1% (matches \( 0.371 \))
- Frequency of t: 62.9% (matches \( 0.629 \))
- Number of students with TT: 109
- Number of students with Tt: 373
- Number of students with tt: 316
