Okay, so I've got this series to evaluate: the sum from k equals 1 to infinity of [(-1)^(k-1) divided by k] multiplied by another sum from n equals 0 to infinity of 1 divided by (k times 2^n plus 1). Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's write it out to get a clearer picture. The series is:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] * Sum_{n=0}^∞ [ 1 / (k 2^n + 1) ]

So, this is a double sum. The outer sum is over k from 1 to infinity, and the inner sum is over n from 0 to infinity. 

I remember that sometimes you can swap the order of summation if the series converges absolutely or conditionally. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Let me think. Since the terms involve (-1)^(k-1)/k, that's an alternating series, which is conditionally convergent. The inner sum is over n, which is a positive term series. I wonder if the inner sum converges or diverges. For each fixed k, as n increases, 2^n grows exponentially, so each term 1/(k 2^n +1) behaves like 1/(k 2^n). So the inner sum converges for each k because it's a geometric series. 

So the inner sum converges, and the outer sum also converges because the alternating series converges. So maybe there's a way to switch the order of summation. Let me try that.

If I swap the sums, the expression becomes:

Sum_{n=0}^∞ Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] * [ 1 / (k 2^n + 1) ]

So now we have a double sum: sum over n, then sum over k. I wonder if this is easier to handle. Maybe I can compute the inner sum first for each n and then see if the outer sum simplifies.

Let me fix n and compute the inner sum S(n) = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] * [ 1 / (k 2^n + 1) ]

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe it's better to look for a pattern or a known series. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it or find a closed-form expression.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can use the fact that 1/(k 2^n +1) can be expressed as an integral. Because 1/(a + b) = ∫_{0}^{1} t^{a + b -1} dt. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Alternatively, 1/(k 2^n +1) can be written as ∫_{0}^{1} t^{k 2^n} dt? Let me check: ∫ t^{k 2^n} dt from 0 to 1 is [1/(k 2^n +1)] t^{k 2^n +1} from 0 to1, which gives 1/(k 2^n +1). Yes, that works. So 1/(k 2^n +1) = ∫_{0}^{1} t^{k 2^n} dt.

So substituting that into S(n):

S(n) = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] * ∫_{0}^{1} t^{k 2^n} dt.

Now, perhaps I can interchange the sum and the integral (if convergence allows). So:

S(n) = ∫_{0}^{1} [ Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] t^{k 2^n} ] dt.

The Sum inside is Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] t^{k 2^n}.

Hmm, that's similar to the expansion of ln(1 + x), which is Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] x^k, for |x| <=1, x != 1.

Looking at our sum, each term is t^{k 2^n} instead of t^k. So if I let x = t^{2^n}, then the sum becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^(k-1) / k ] x^k. That's exactly the expansion for ln(1 + x).

So substituting, S(n) = ∫_{0}^{1} ln(1 + t^{2^n}) dt.

So now, S(n) = ∫_{0}^{1} ln(1 + t^{2^n}) dt.

So now, the original double sum is Sum_{n=0}^∞ S(n) = Sum_{n=0}^∞ ∫_{0}^{1} ln(1 + t^{2^n}) dt.

Since the sum and integral can be interchanged (due to uniform convergence or dominated convergence), we can write this as the integral of the sum of ln(1 + t^{2^n}) over n from 0 to infinity.

So now, the problem reduces to evaluating the integral from 0 to 1 of the sum_{n=0}^∞ ln(1 + t^{2^n}) dt.

Hmm, that sum inside the integral looks like it's a telescoping series or something. Let me consider the sum:

Sum_{n=0}^∞ ln(1 + t^{2^n}).

I remember that for x in (0,1), the infinite product ∏_{n=0}^∞ (1 + x^{2^n}) = 1/(1 - x). So the sum of logs is the log of the product, so ln(1/(1 - x)) = -ln(1 -x). So if x is between 0 and 1, the sum of ln(1 +x^{2^n}) from n=0 to infinity is -ln(1 -x). Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

ln(1 + x) + ln(1 + x^2) + ln(1 + x^4) + ... = ln( (1+x)(1+x²)(1+x⁴)... )

And the product (1+x)(1+x²)(1+x⁴)... is equal to 1/(1 -x) for |x| <1.

So the sum is ln(1/(1 -x)) = -ln(1 -x).

Therefore, the sum inside the integral is -ln(1 - t). So:

Integral_{0}^{1} [ -ln(1 - t) ] dt = - ∫_{0}^{1} ln(1 - t) dt.

Wait, wait, because the sum is equal to -ln(1 - t), right? So:

Sum_{n=0}^∞ ln(1 + t^{2^n}) = -ln(1 - t).

So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{1} [ -ln(1 - t) ] dt, but wait, the negative sign is from the sum. So let me clarify:

Sum = -ln(1 - t), so the integral is ∫_{0}^{1} -ln(1 - t) dt.

So the integral of -ln(1 - t) from 0 to 1. Hmm, I need to compute this.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 1 - t. Then when t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0. du = -dt, so dt = -du.

So the integral becomes:

∫_{u=1}^{u=0} -ln(u) (-du) = ∫_{0}^{1} -ln(u) du.

Wait, no. Let me double-check substitution:

Sum = -ln(1 - t). The integral is ∫_{0}^{1} (-ln(1 - t)) dt.

Wait, no, wait. The sum is Sum = -ln(1 - t). So the integral is ∫_{0}^{1} (-ln(1 - t)) dt.

So that's equal to ∫_{0}^{1} -ln(1 - t) dt.

Let me compute this integral.

Let me set u = 1 - t. Then du = -dt. So when t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫_{u=1}^{u=0} -ln(u) (-du) = ∫_{0}^{1} -ln(u) du.

Wait, no, because substituting, we have:

Original integral ∫_{0}^{1} (-ln(1 - t)) dt.

Let u = 1 - t, so t = 1 - u.

dt = -du.

When t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0.

So:

∫_{t=0}^{t=1} (-ln(u)) (-du) [since dt = -du]

= ∫_{u=1}^{u=0} (-ln(u)) (-du) = ∫_{u=1}^{u=0} ln(u) du.

But integrating from 1 to 0 is the same as negative the integral from 0 to 1. So:

= - ∫_{0}^{1} ln(u) du.

The integral of ln(u) du is u ln(u) - u. Evaluating from 0 to 1.

At u=1: 1*ln(1) -1 = 0 -1 = -1.

At u approaches 0+: u ln u approaches 0 (since u approaches 0 and ln u approaches -infty, but u approaches zero faster). So 0*(something) - 0 = 0.

So ∫_{0}^{1} ln(u) du = (-1) - 0 = -1.

Thus, the integral becomes:

- (-1) ) = 1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me retrace.

We had:

Sum_{n=0}^∞ ln(1 + t^{2^n}) = -ln(1 - t).

So the integral is ∫_{0}^{1} (-ln(1 - t)) dt.

We set u = 1 - t, so the integral becomes ∫_{1}^{0} -ln(u) (-du).

Which is ∫_{1}^{0} ln(u) du.

Which is equal to -∫_{0}^{1} ln(u) du.

And ∫_{0}^{1} ln(u) du is equal to [u ln u - u] from 0 to 1.

At u=1: 1*0 -1 = -1.

At u approaching 0: u approaches 0, ln u approaches -infty, but u ln u approaches 0 (using L’Hospital's Rule: lim u ln u = lim (ln u)/ (1/u) = lim (1/u)/(-1/u²) = lim (-u) = 0).

So ∫_{0}^{1} ln(u) du = (-1) - 0 = -1.

So our integral becomes -(-1) = 1.

Wait, wait, let me clarify again. 

The integral of (-ln(1 - t)) dt from 0 to 1: let me compute it directly.

Let me compute I = ∫_{0}^{1} -ln(1 - t) dt.

Let me make substitution: let s = 1 - t, then ds = -dt. When t=0, s=1; t=1, s=0.

So I = ∫_{s=1}^{s=0} -ln(s) (-ds) = ∫_{1}^{0} ln(s) ds = -∫_{0}^{1} ln(s) ds.

We know that ∫_{0}^{1} ln(s) ds = -1.

So I = -(-1) = 1.

So the integral is 1.

Wait, but the sum inside is Sum_{n=0}^∞ ln(1 + t^{2^n}) = -ln(1 - t), right? So the integral becomes 1.

So the entire original double sum reduces to 1.

So the value of the series is 1.

Looking back at the options, option E is 1.0.

But wait, let me double-check the steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the sum inside the integral was Sum_{n=0}^∞ ln(1 + t^{2^n}) = -ln(1 - t). That's correct because the product of (1 + t^{2^0})(1 + t^{2^1})(1 + t^{2^2})... equals 1/(1 - t), so the sum of logs is ln(1/(1 - t)) = -ln(1 - t). So that's correct.

Then the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{1} (-ln(1 - t)) dt, which we computed as 1.

So yes, the entire series equals 1. So the answer is E: 1.0.
