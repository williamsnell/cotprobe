Okay, I need to figure out what a value-added tax is. Let me think about what I remember from my economics class. I remember that taxes can be classified in different ways, like增值税 in Germany or something similar.

So, value-added tax (VAT) is a tax levied on the value added at each stage of production and distribution. That means when a product is sold, the tax is calculated based on the value added to it in each transaction. I think it's calculated on the difference between the selling price and the price at which the product was produced.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: A tax applicable only to raw materials. No, I think VAT is applied to the entire value of goods, not just raw materials. Like, if a company makes something, they have to pay tax on the whole product, not just the materials used.

Option B: A tax imposed exclusively on luxury items. That doesn't sound right. VAT is a broad tax applied to all goods, not just luxury.

Option C: A tax deducted from the total sales revenue of a company. Hmm, VAT is collected by the company as part of their sales, but it's not taken away entirely. It's a percentage of the total sales, so it's deducted from the company's income, but not subtracted from the sales price.

Option D: A progressive tax levied on the profits of a corporation. No, that's not what I remember. Progressive taxes are based on income levels, like the top 10% pays more than the bottom 10%. VAT is a flat tax on the value added, regardless of the company's profits.

Option E: A tax levied on the final selling price of a product. No, that's more like a sales tax, which is a percentage of the final price. Value-added tax is calculated on the value added in each stage, not just the final price.

Option F: A sales tax that is applied uniformly on all products at a single stage. No, that's probably something else, like a common retail tax, but I don't think it's called sales tax. Sales tax is usually per product, not uniform on all.

Option G: A tax only levied on imported goods to encourage domestic production. That's like something like the Tariff on Exports, but that's a specific export duty. VAT isn't tied to that; it's a tax on the value added.

Option H: A flat-rate tax imposed on individual income. No, that's income tax. VAT is a percentage tax on the value added.

Option I: A tax collected at each stage of production based on the value added. Yes, that sounds exactly right. Each time a product is produced, the company adds the value, and the VAT is collected based on that. So it's calculated at each stage.

Option J: A tax imposed on the total value of a product. That's the total value, but I think that's more like a flat tax per product, not a per-unit tax based on value.

So the correct answer should be option I: a tax collected at each stage based on the value added.

The correct answer is **I: A tax collected at each stage of production based on the value added**.
