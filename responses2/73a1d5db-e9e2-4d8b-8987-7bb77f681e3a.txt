Okay, so I have this question about planar graphs and triangle-free graphs. Hmm, I need to find the maximum number of edges in such a graph with 30 vertices. Let me think about planar graphs first. Oh right, planar graphs have certain properties, like Euler's formula. Euler's formula says that for a connected planar graph, the number of vertices minus edges plus faces equals 2. So V - E + F = 2. 

Wait, but triangle-free graphs... Oh right, triangle-free means no three edges form a triangle. So every face is at least a quadrilateral, maybe. I remember there's a theorem related to that. Oh yes, maybe it's something about the number of edges in terms of the number of vertices when the graph is triangle-free.

Wait, another thought: For a planar graph, the maximum number of edges without any triangles. Or is that the case? Wait, planar graphs can have triangles, but when they're triangle-free, they might have fewer edges. So how does that affect the edge count?

Wait, I think there's a formula for the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph. Let me try to recall. Oh right, I think it's derived from Euler's formula and the fact that each face must have at least four edges. Because if the graph is triangle-free, any face can't have three edges. So each face contributes at least four edges.

Wait, but in planar graphs, each edge is shared by two faces. So if I have F faces, each face contributes at least four edges, but each edge is counted twice. So 2E >= 4F → E >= 2F. But I'm trying to find an upper bound on E for a triangle-free planar graph. Maybe I should think about the planar graph without the triangle condition first.

Wait, the maximum number of edges for a planar graph without any restriction (like being triangle-free) is given by 3V - 6, right? Because planar graphs can't have more than that. But when you add the condition of being triangle-free, the maximum number of edges decreases.

Wait, maybe there's a better approach. Let's think about the average degree of a vertex in a triangle-free planar graph. Since every face has at least four edges, each edge belongs to two faces. Also, in a planar graph, the sum of the degrees of all faces (each face contributes its number of edges) is equal to twice the number of edges. So 4F <= 2E → 2F <= E. But since E = 3V -6 for a maximal planar graph, but that's when every face is a triangle. So if the graph is triangle-free, that upper bound might be lower.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for a formula. Oh wait, I remember that for a triangle-free planar graph, the maximum number of edges is given by E ≤ 2V - 4. Is that right? Because for example, a convex polygon (a cycle) with V vertices has E = V edges. But if you add edges without forming triangles, maybe it's more than V but not 2V - 4?

Wait, let me think again. For a triangle-free planar graph, each face must have at least four edges. So, using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2. Also, since each face has at least four edges, 2E >= 4F → E >= 2F. Substituting into Euler's, V - E + F =2 → V - E + (E/2) <= 2 → V - E/2 <= 2 → E >= 2V -4. So E >= 2V -4. But that's the minimum. Wait, no, that's not right because for the triangle-free condition, I think the maximum edge count is 2V-4. So for V=30, 2*30 -4 =56, which is option H. But wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, another thought: For planar graphs without any triangles, the maximum edge count is 2V -4. But wait, can that be right? Let's test it for a small V. For V=3, a triangle is not allowed. So the maximum edges would be 2. Using the formula: 2*3-4=2. Correct. For V=4, a square is allowed, E=4. The formula gives 4, which is correct. For V=5, a convex pentagon is 5 edges, but maybe adding a diagonal gives E=6, but it's not triangle-free. Wait, no, that's allowed because the pentagon plus a diagonal creates a 5-edge graph without triangles. Wait, but 2V-4 for V=5 is 6, so that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another approach: Using the formula E ≤ 2V -4 for triangle-free planar graphs. So for V=30, the maximum edges would be 2*30 -4=56. So option H is 56. But wait, I thought the formula was E ≤ 2V -4, so 56 is the maximum. So the answer should be H. But wait, looking back at the options, H is 56. But wait, the options are A to J: A is 69, B is 60, C=63, D=84, E=45, F=90, G=50, H=56, I=75, J=48.

So the maximum number of edges is 56? But that seems low. Wait, but for a triangle-free planar graph, the maximum edges are 2V-4. For V=30, that's 56. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, wait, I think that's correct. But I'm a bit confused because I thought that in a planar graph, triangle-free, the maximum edges are 2V-4, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, another angle: For a planar graph, the maximum number of edges is 3V -6 for a general planar graph (allowing triangles). So when you have a triangle-free condition, each face must have at least four edges. So using the formula E <= (4F)/2 = 2F → but from Euler's, F = E - V + 2. So substituting, E <= 2(E - V +2) → E <= 2E - 2V +4 → 0 <= E - 2V +4 → E <= 2V -4. So yes, that's correct. So for V=30, that's 56.

Wait, but what about the options given? Let me check. The options are A:69, B:60, C:63, D:84, E:45, F:90, G:50, H:56, I:75, J:48.

So option H is 56, which is the answer. But wait, I also remember that in a planar graph, the maximum edges without a triangle is given by 2V-4. So yes, 56 edges. But wait, let me think of an example. For a convex polygon of 30 vertices, that's 30 edges, but if you add 56-30=26 edges without forming any triangles, is that possible?

Wait, for a convex polygon, adding a diagonal would create a triangle. So to avoid triangles, perhaps each new edge added is a diagonal that doesn't cross any existing edges and doesn't form a triangle with any two existing edges. But adding edges to a polygon without triangles is similar to building a maximal planar graph without triangles, but wait, a maximal planar graph with 30 vertices would have 3*30 -6 =84 edges, but that's for a planar graph allowing triangles. But in this case, the graph is triangle-free, so it's less than that. So 2V-4 is 56, which is less than 84. So that makes sense.

So the maximum number of edges is 56. Looking back at the options, option H is 56. So the answer should be H.
</think>

The maximum number of edges in a simple triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices is determined by the formula E ≤ 2V -4, where V is the number of vertices. For V=30, this gives E=56. This corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
