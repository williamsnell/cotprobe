Okay, so I have this polynomial problem. Let me read it again. The polynomial is x³ - A x + 15, and it has three real roots. Two of these roots sum to 5. I need to find |A|. The options are from A to J, with numbers 18 to 26.0, in steps of 1.0.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that for a cubic equation, there's Vieta's formulas that relate the roots to the coefficients. So, suppose the roots are r, s, and t. Then, according to Vieta's:

Sum of roots: r + s + t = 0 (since the coefficient of x² is 0). Wait, the given polynomial is x³ - A x + 15, so the x² term is missing, which means the coefficient is zero. So yes, the sum r + s + t = 0.

Sum of the products two at a time: rs + rt + st = -A. Because Vieta's says that for x³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of roots is -b, and the sum of products two at a time is c, and sum of products three at a time is -d. But in our case, the equation is x³ - A x + 15, so b is 0. So, r + s + t = 0, rs + rt + st = -A, and rst = -15.

Wait, but the problem states that two of the roots sum to 5. Let's say r + s = 5. Then, the third root t must be -5 because r + s + t = 0. So t = -5.

So now, the sum of products two at a time is rs + rt + st. Let's compute that. rs + r*(-5) + s*(-5) = rs -5(r + s). Since r + s =5, this becomes rs -5*5 = rs -25. And according to Vieta, this equals -A. So:

rs -25 = -A → A = 25 - rs.

But I don't know rs yet. I know that rst = -15. Since t is -5, substituting gives r*s*(-5) = -15 → r s = 3.

Oh, because r*s*(-5) = -15 → r s = (-15)/(-5) = 3. So rs is 3.

So going back to A: A = 25 - rs = 25 -3 = 22. So |A| is 22.0. Looking at the options, option C is 22.0.

Wait, let me double-check. If two roots add up to 5, and the product of all three is -15, with t being -5, then rs is 3. So rs + rt + st = 3 + (-5)(5) = 3 -25 = -22. Which equals -A → A is 22. So yes, |A| is 22.
</think>

The polynomial is \(x^3 - Ax + 15\) with three real roots. Let the roots be \(r\), \(s\), and \(t\). According to Vieta's formulas:

1. \(r + s + t = 0\),
2. \(rs + rt + st = -A\),
3. \(rst = -15\).

Given that two roots sum to 5, say \(r + s = 5\), then \(t = -5\). Substituting into the product of roots:

\[
rst = r s (-5) = -15 \implies r s = 3.
\]

Now, calculate \(rs + rt + st\):

\[
rs -5r -5s = rs -5(r + s) = 3 - 25 = -22.
\]

From Vieta's formula, this equals \(-A\), so \(A = 22\). Thus, \(|A| = 22.0\).
