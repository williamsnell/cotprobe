Okay, I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The function is f(x) = a x^6 - b x^4 + x - 1, and we know that f(2) equals 5. The question is asking for f(-2). Hmm, I remember that when dealing with even-powered functions, some terms might behave differently. Let me think about how f(2) and f(-2) relate.

So, f(x) has terms with x^6 and x^4, which are even exponents. Those should be the same whether x is positive or negative. For example, x^6 is (âˆ’x)^6, because negative times negative any even power is positive. Same with x^4. But the x term is odd-powered, so it will change sign when x is replaced by -x. The constant term, like -1, is the same whether x is positive or negative.

Let me write down f(-x) to see the pattern. 

f(-x) = a*(-x)^6 - b*(-x)^4 + (-x) -1. 

Simplify each term:
- (-x)^6 is x^6 because the exponent is even.
- (-x)^4 is x^4.
So f(-x) becomes a x^6 - b x^4 - x -1.

Wait, but f(x) is a x^6 - b x^4 + x -1. So when I compare f(-x) and f(x), the first two terms are the same, but the next two terms are negatives of each other. Specifically, the x term in f(-x) is -x, whereas in f(x) it's +x. The constant term is -1 in both.

So f(-x) can be written as [a x^6 - b x^4 - 1] - x. 

Now, let me think about f(2) and f(-2). Let's compute them step by step. We know f(2) is 5, so let's write that out.

f(2) = a*(2)^6 - b*(2)^4 + 2 - 1 = 5.

Compute 2^6: 64, 2^4 is 16. So:

a*64 - b*16 + 2 - 1 = 5.

Simplify: 64a - 16b + 1 =5.

So 64a -16b =4. I can divide both sides by 16 to make it simpler: 4a - b = 0.25. Hmm, maybe I'll keep it as 64a -16b =4 for now.

But wait, I don't know the values of a and b. Since the question is only asking for f(-2), maybe there's a way to express f(-2) in terms of f(2) without knowing a and b. Let me compute f(-2).

f(-2) = a*(-2)^6 - b*(-2)^4 + (-2) -1.

Again, (-2)^6 is 64, (-2)^4 is 16. So:

64a -16b -2 -1 = f(-2).

Which simplifies to 64a -16b -3.

But from earlier, I found that 64a -16b is equal to 4. So substituting that into f(-2):

4 -3 =1.

So f(-2) is 1. Looking at the options, option B is 1. So the answer should be B.

The function f(x) is evaluated at x=2 and x=-2. For even-powered terms (x^6 and x^4), f(-x) equals f(x) because (-x)^6 = x^6 and (-x)^4 = x^4. The odd-powered term (x) changes sign when x is replaced by -x. Thus, f(-2) = (64a - 16b) - 2 - 1. From f(2) = 5, we have 64a - 16b = 4. Substituting this, f(-2) = 4 - 3 = 1.

Answer: B
