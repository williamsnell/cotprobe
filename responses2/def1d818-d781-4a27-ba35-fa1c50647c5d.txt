Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is likely to live the longest. All other things being equal, which person would have the longest life? Let's go through each option one by one.

First, the options are A to J. Let me list them again to make sure I don't miss any:

A: Black woman
B: Hispanic man
C: White woman
D: Asian man
E: White man
F: Native American man
G: Hispanic woman
H: Native American woman
I: Black man
J: Asian woman

I think I should consider factors that can affect lifespan. Age is a big factor, but all options are adults, so they all have a life span. But maybe some have different lifespans based on their background.

Black women (A) have a long history of discrimination. They're often underrepresented in the workforce and might have lower birth rates, but they don't necessarily live longer. They might have different health issues, but generally, their lifespan isn't longer than other groups.

Hispanics (B) have faced similar issues, with discrimination and in some cases, higher rates of death. However, their average lifespan is usually similar to others, but maybe slightly lower. Not sure.

White women (C) are more diverse and might have a longer life because they're part of a larger population with a wider range of health risks. But I'm not certain if they live longer than others.

Asian men (D) have faced discrimination, especially in some areas. They might have lower birth rates or other health issues, but their average lifespan is usually longer than others.

White men (E) are the majority, so their lifespan is longer than those who are underrepresented. So E is more likely to live longer.

Native American men (F) are a minority. They might have higher rates of disease and lower birth rates. So their lifespan is shorter.

Hispanic women (G) are affected by discrimination and may have lower birth rates, but their lifespan is similar to others.

White women (C) are in a more diverse population, so maybe they live longer on average.

Asian women (J) have faced discrimination in some areas, but their lifespan is longer than others.

Black men (I) have faced discrimination, so their average lifespan is shorter.

So putting it all together:

E: White man is the most common and likely to live the longest.

The white man (E) is the most likely to live the longest due to being a more diverse and underrepresented group.

Answer: E
