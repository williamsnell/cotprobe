Question:

A homeowner resides downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She has sued both the owner of the facility and the supplier of a solvent used at the facility. She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?

Options:

A: No, because the solvent supplier should have taken precautions to prevent spills.
B: No, because the solvent supplier is directly responsible for the contamination.
C: Yes, because the solvent supplier can't be held accountable for the negligence of the facility owner.
D: Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.
E: Yes, because the negligence of the facility owner is the primary cause of contamination.
F: No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.
G: Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.
H: Yes, because the homeowner does not have substantial proof of contamination.
I: No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.
J: No, because the solvent supplier and the facility owner are both responsible for the contamination, regardless of the amount each contributed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it carefully.

The homeowner is suing two entities related to a metal fabrication facility. She's saying that contaminants, mostly the solvent, were released into the ground and are still migrating there. The contaminants are damaging her soil, groundwater, and well. She's claiming negligence at the facility owner level and the supplier level.

The solvent supplier is arguing for summary judgment, saying that if there's contamination, the facility owner and supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts. Also, there's no evidence that they acted in concert. 

I need to determine whether the court should grant summary judgment to the supplier or not. The options are A to J, and I have to pick one.

Hmm. So, summary judgment is when the judge concludes there's no merit to the claim being brought. The supplier is arguing that their liability is indeterminate because they can't prove any direct fault, and the owner can't be held accountable either.

In tort law, when two parties are jointly and severally liable, each is responsible for the entirety of the injury. But in this case, I think the key here is about causation. Causation requires that the harm was directly caused by each party's actions. If the contamination is caused by both the facility owner and the solvent supplier, each can be held responsible.

But wait, in this scenario, the solvent supplier's employees are spilling some solvent onto the ground. If that spill is the main cause, then the owner might be partially liable. But the supplier is saying that without any evidence of their own negligence, their responsibility is indeterminate.

Wait, the question says the solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the contamination is from both, but no evidence of their actions being in concert. So the supplier is saying that each contributed indeterminately, so neither can be held liable for their own part, only the whole.

But what about the owner's negligence? If the owner is partially negligent, then the owner could be partially liable. But the supplier's argument is that both contributed equally, but without evidence of their joint responsibility.

Wait, in a joint and severally liable situation, each party is responsible for the entirety of the injury. But in this case, the contamination is caused by both the owner and the supplier. So the owner's negligence would lead to a partial liability from them, and the supplier's negligence would lead to a partial liability from them as well.

But wait, the supplier is arguing that each contributed indeterminate amounts, meaning they can't prove any of their own negligence. So perhaps they can't be held liable for their own actions, but the owner can be held liable for their own actions.

Wait, but the question says the supplier is arguing that their liability is indeterminate. So maybe the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is not liable for their own actions.

Wait, but the facility owner is also a party. So if the contamination is caused by both, then each is responsible. So the owner can be partially liable, and the supplier is partially liable as well.

But the supplier is asserting that their liability is indeterminate because each contributed equally, but I'm not sure how that applies. Alternatively, perhaps the owner's negligence makes their part of the contamination, and the supplier's negligence is separate, making their part also liable.

Wait, maybe the situation is that both the owner and the supplier are directly responsible for the contamination. So the owner could be partially liable if they did something wrong, and the supplier could be partially liable if they did something wrong.

But the supplier is arguing that their own actions are not directly responsible because their contribution is indeterminate. So perhaps the owner's negligence is the main cause, and the supplier's is not directly responsible, but their actions are part of the contamination.

Wait, but the supplier is saying that if the contamination is from both, then each is indeterminate. So perhaps the owner's negligence is the main cause, and the supplier's is not directly responsible, but they're both part of the overall cause.

Wait, but the question is about the summary judgment motion. The question is whether the court should grant or deny summary judgment.

In summary, the main issue is whether each party is jointly and severally liable for the contamination. If the contamination is caused by both the owner and the supplier, then both are jointly and severally liable.

But the supplier is arguing that each contributed indeterminate amounts, so they can't be held solely or jointly. Wait, but if the owner's negligence is the main cause, then the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also liable for their own actions. But the supplier is saying that their actions are not directly responsible because their contribution is indeterminate.

Alternatively, perhaps the owner's negligence and the supplier's negligence are each directly responsible for the contamination, so each is partially liable. 

Wait, perhaps the issue is causation. If the contamination is caused by both, then each has a duty to prevent that. So the owner could be partially liable, and the supplier could also be partially liable. 

But the question is about the summary judgment motion. The summary judgment motion is granted when the evidence is insufficient to show any liability beyond what's already known.

If the contamination is caused by both, the court might find that each is jointly and severally liable, so the supplier can't be held liable for their own actions because the owner's negligence is the main cause. But the supplier is trying to say that because they can't prove their own negligence, they can't be held liable for any of their actions, only the whole.

Wait, but the owner's negligent act would lead to a partial liability from them. The supplier's negligence would lead to a partial liability from them as well. However, the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their own actions. So if the owner's negligence is the main cause, the owner is partially liable, but the supplier is not responsible for their own actions because their contribution is indeterminate.

Wait, noâ€”wait. If the contamination is caused by both parties, each is responsible for their part. So, the owner's negligence is the primary cause, leading to their liability, and the supplier's negligence is another cause, leading to their liability. So the owner is partially liable, the supplier is also partially liable. But the supplier is arguing that their own actions are not directly responsible because they can't prove any of their own negligence. So maybe the supplier isn't liable for their own actions, only the whole.

Wait, but the owner's negligence would be part of the contamination. So the owner is responsible for their actions, and the supplier is responsible for their actions. So the question is whether the supplier can be held responsible for their actions. If the owner's negligence is the main cause, then the owner is responsible, and the supplier's negligence is a separate cause but also contributes.

But the supplier is saying that their own actions are not directly responsible because they can't prove any liability. So perhaps the supplier isn't liable for their own actions, but their actions are part of the contamination.

Wait, but in a joint and severally liable situation, each is responsible for the entire contamination. So if the contamination is caused by both, both are jointly and severally liable. So each is responsible for the entire amount, but their individual liability would be less than the whole.

But the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their own actions. So if their actions are part of the contamination, then the supplier is liable for their actions. But the supplier is arguing that their actions are not directly responsible, only that their fault is indeterminate.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that the owner's actions are the main cause of the contamination, so the owner is partially liable, and the supplier's actions are a separate cause but not directly responsible for their own actions.

So the question is whether the court should grant summary judgment. If the contamination is caused by both, the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also partially liable. But the supplier is arguing that their liability is indeterminate, so they can't be held liable for their own actions.

Wait, but if the contamination is caused by both, the owner can be partially liable, and the supplier can be partially liable. So the owner's negligence and the supplier's negligence are both parts of the same cause. So each is jointly and severally liable for the contamination. Thus, the owner is liable for their actions, and the supplier is liable for their actions as well.

But the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions. So if their actions are part of the contamination, then yes. But the supplier is saying their actions are not directly responsible because they can't prove any liability.

Wait, no. The question says the supplier moved for summary judgment, which is that if any contamination happened, each can't be held liable for their own actions. So perhaps the owner's negligence is the primary cause, making their responsibility the main issue, and the supplier's is not directly responsible.

But the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions. If the contamination is caused by both, then the supplier's actions are a part of the contamination. So their liability would be for their actions, but the question is whether they can be held liable for their own actions.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the contamination is caused by both, so the owner is responsible for their actions, and the supplier is responsible for their actions as well. So the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also liable for their actions. But the supplier is arguing that they can't prove their own actions' fault, so they can't be held liable for their actions.

Wait, but if the owner is partially liable and the supplier is also liable for their actions, then the supplier is responsible for their actions. So if the owner's negligence is the main cause, then the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also liable for their actions.

Wait, but the question is about whether the summary judgment motion should be granted. Summary judgment would be granted if there's no merit to the claim.

In this case, since the owner's actions (negligence) are the main cause, the owner is partially liable, and the supplier's negligence is a separate cause that also leads to contamination. So each has a share of the liability.

So the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions. If the contamination is entirely caused by both, then each is responsible for their respective actions. So the supplier is liable for their actions.

But the supplier is arguing that because they can't prove their own actions' fault, they can't be held liable for their actions, only the whole.

Wait, perhaps when the contamination is caused by multiple parties, each of them is responsible for their part. So each is liable for their actions. But the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions. If the contamination is caused by both, each's actions are part of the contamination, so each is responsible for their actions. Thus, the owner is partially liable, the supplier is also liable for their actions. The question is whether the supplier's actions are directly responsible.

Wait, but the question is whether the court should grant summary judgment to the supplier. Summary judgment would be granted if the evidence is insufficient to show that the plaintiff is liable beyond what is known.

In this case, if the contamination is caused by both, then both are jointly and severally liable. So the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also liable for their actions. But the supplier is arguing that they can't prove their own actions' fault, so they can't be held liable for their actions. However, as part of the overall liability, they are responsible for their actions.

Wait, maybe the issue is whether the supplier's actions are directly responsible. If the owner's negligence is the main cause, then the owner is responsible for their actions. The supplier's actions are a separate cause but also contribute. So the supplier is responsible for their actions, even if they can't prove their own fault.

So, in that case, the supplier is responsible for their actions, so summary judgment would not be granted because the supplier's actions are directly liable.

Wait, but the options are about whether the summary judgment motion is granted or not.

Looking at the options:

A: No because supplier should have taken precautions. (Not sure if that's relevant.)

B: No because supplier is directly responsible. (Possibly.)

C: Yes because supplier can't be held. (If their actions aren't responsible.)

D: Yes, allocating damages. (If each is responsible for their parts.)

E: Yes, because owner's cause is primary. (If owner is responsible.)

F: No because supplier is vicariously liable. (Not sure.)

G: Yes, because no evidence of concurrent actions. (The owner's negligence is primary.)

H: Yes, because owner's cause is primary. (Same as G.)

J: No because both are responsible for contamination regardless of how much each contributed.

Wait, the question is about whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions. If the owner's actions are the main cause, then the owner is liable for their actions, and the supplier is also liable for their actions. But the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions, i.e., whether they can be held responsible for their actions, regardless of the owner's negligence.

So, if the owner's negligence is the main cause, then the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also liable for their actions. However, the supplier is arguing that their actions are not directly responsible, but they are part of the contamination.

Wait, but the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions. If their actions are part of the contamination, then yes, but they can't prove their fault, so maybe they can't be held liable for their actions.

But in the scenario, the owner's negligence and the supplier's actions are both part of the contamination. So the owner is responsible for their actions, and the supplier is responsible for their actions.

The supplier is trying to say that because their actions are not directly responsible, they can't be held liable for their actions. But as part of the larger contamination, their actions are still responsible.

Wait, but the question is about whether the court should grant summary judgment. If the contamination is caused by both, then each is liable for their parts. So the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also liable for their actions. So the court should grant summary judgment because the supplier is responsible for their actions.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the contamination is entirely caused by the owner and the supplier, then each is jointly and severally liable. So the owner is partially liable, and the supplier is also liable for their actions. So the supplier can be held liable for their actions.

But the question is whether the supplier can be held liable for their actions. If the owner's negligence is the main cause, then the owner is liable for their actions, and the supplier is also liable for their actions.

So the answer would be that the supplier is responsible for their actions, so summary judgment should be granted because the supplier can be held liable for their actions.

Looking at the options, option E says "Yes, because the owner's cause is the primary cause of contamination." Wait, no, that's not correct. The owner's actions are the main cause, so the owner is responsible, and the supplier is as well.

Wait, but the question is about whether the supplier is liable for their actions. If the owner's actions are the main cause, then the owner is liable for their actions, and the supplier is also liable for their actions.

So, the supplier is liable for their actions, so the court should grant summary judgment because the supplier is responsible for their actions. Therefore, the answer is E.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option E: Yes, because the owner's cause is the primary cause of contamination.

Wait, noâ€”that's saying that the owner's actions are the main cause, so the owner is liable for their actions, and the supplier is liable for their actions as well. So the supplier is liable for their actions, so summary judgment should be granted because the supplier can be held liable for their actions.

Wait, but the question is whether the court should grant summary judgment. If the owner's actions are the main cause, then the owner is liable for their actions, and the supplier is liable for their actions. So the supplier is responsible for their actions, so summary judgment should be granted because the supplier can be held liable for their actions.

Looking at the options:

Looking at option E: Yes, because owner's cause is primary. But no, this would mean that the owner is liable, and the supplier is also liable for their actions. So the supplier's actions are directly liable, so summary judgment should be granted.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible answer options.

The correct choice is E: Yes, because the owner's cause is the primary cause of contamination.

Wait, no. The owner's cause is the primary cause, but the supplier's actions are part of the contamination. So the supplier is liable for their actions, so the court should grant summary judgment because the supplier can be held liable for their actions.

Wait, but the options:

Looking at the options, the correct answer is E? Or is it another option?

Wait, the options are, for example, option H: Yes, because the owner's cause is primary.

Wait, the question is whether the summary judgment motion is granted. If the owner is responsible for their actions, and the supplier is responsible for their actions, then the court should grant summary judgment because the supplier is liable for their actions.

So looking at the options:

Option E: Yes, because the owner's cause is the primary cause of contamination.

Wait, but no, that would mean that the owner is responsible, and the supplier is also responsible for their actions. So the supplier is liable for their actions, so summary judgment should be granted.

Alternatively, option H says yes because owner's cause is primary.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E. Let me think again.

In the scenario, the owner's negligence is the main cause of contamination. So the owner is liable for their actions. The supplier's actions are a part of the contamination, so the supplier is also liable for their actions. 

So the court should grant summary judgment because the supplier is responsible for their actions, making option E the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: Yes, because the owner's cause is the primary cause of contamination.**

**Explanation:**

The homeowner is suing both the metal fabrication facility and a solvent supplier, claiming contamination from contaminants released into the ground and from the rooftop tank. The solvent supplier argues that their actions are not directly responsible because there is no evidence of their negligence contributing to the contamination, and the owner's negligence is the primary cause.

In this case, the contamination is caused by both the owner's actions and the solvent supplier's actions. The owner is responsible for their actions, and the solvent supplier is also responsible for their actions as part of the contamination. Therefore, the solvent supplier is directly liable for their actions, and the owner is liable for their actions. The court should grant summary judgment because the solvent supplier is responsible for their actions, and the owner is also responsible for their actions, but the solvent supplier's actions are directly responsible.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: Yes, because the owner's cause is the primary cause of contamination.**
