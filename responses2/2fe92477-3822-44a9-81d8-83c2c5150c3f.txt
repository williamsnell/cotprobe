Question:

When an adult mouse or bird is castrated, its sexual behavior virtually disappears. Compare the effects of castration of highly developed primates with the less developed animals.

Options:

A: In higher primates such as man, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced.
B: In primates, castration after sexual maturity reduces aggression but has no effect on sexual behavior.
C: Primates show a temporary decline in sexual behavior post-castration, but it fully recovers within weeks.
D: Castration in primates results in complete loss of sexual behavior
E: Castration in primates has no effect on their sexual behavior at any stage of development.
F: Castration of primates leads to an increase in sexual behavior due to hormonal imbalances.
G: Castration affects the ability to perform sexual acts in all animals
H: Primates can't learn sexual behavior through experience
I: Castration of primates causes a permanent shift to non-sexual social behavior patterns.
J: In higher primates, castration before puberty prevents the development of sexual behavior entirely.

Okay, so I have this question about why adults mice and birds stop having sexual behavior after being castrated. And I need to compare that to primates, especially comparing high and less developed ones. Hmm.

Let me think. I remember that when animals are castrated, their sexual behavior changes. Like in mice, for example, when a female is castrated, the male stops engaging. But wait, I'm not sure. Oh wait, maybe it's more about physiological changes. Like, the male's behavior is altered because his behavior is influenced by the female's behavior. So if the female is removed, the male doesn't know the rules anymore.

Now, primates, especially the higher ones like man, but also other species. I think in primates, when males are castrated, their behavior changes. For example, they might stop looking for females or stop expressing need for dominance. But I'm not certain. Do they have any specific behavior effects?

Wait, the question is about the effects of castration on sexual behavior. So in the case of primates, I thought that when males are castrated, they might lose their ability to perform the sexual act. Or maybe it's more about their behavior. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that in higher primates, like man, castration doesn't affect their ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is mature. So if the male is sexually mature, maybe he can still perform the act. But wait, isn't that the opposite of what happens in other animals? Like, does it affect their ability to perform the act? Or does it just stop them from engaging?

Wait, in mice, when the female is castrated, the males stop engaging. So maybe in primates, when a male is castrated, he stops engaging. But I'm not sure. Also, option A says "provided the male is sexually mature." Do mature males still engage in sexual behavior? Or does matureness affect their ability to form bonds?

Alternatively, option B says in primates, castration after sexual maturity reduces aggression but has no effect on sexual behavior. Hmm, that might be about aggression. Does the act of castration affect their sexual behavior? Or not.

Option D says it causes complete loss of sexual behavior. If that's the case, then in primates, when males are castrated, they can't engage in the sexual act. But wait, I thought that some primates, like the male moths, can still perform the sexual act after being castrated. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought. I've heard that in primates, when a male is castrated, he may stop performing the sexual act. Like, after the castration, he can't engage in the act anymore. But does that require the male to be sexually mature? Because if he's still in the mating season, maybe he can still do it but just doesn't perform the act as much.

Alternatively, maybe castration affects their behavior beyond just the act. So in mice, when a female is castrated, the male stops engaging. But in primates, maybe the male can't perform the act regardless of the situation.

Looking back at the options, let's see.

Option E: Castration has no effect. But I think that's not right because I remember that in some primates, like the male moths, they can still perform the sexual act after being castrated, just not engage as much.

Option D says complete loss. So in higher primates, does castration eliminate sexual behavior? I'm not sure. Do they even have the ability to perform the act in the first place? Or do they still do it but just can't show it?

Option H says primates can't learn through experience. That doesn't make sense because humans learned a lot through experience, and they changed a lot.

Option I says castration causes a shift to non-sexual social behavior. That seems like it's more about humans, but maybe applies to other animals too.

Option J: In higher primates, castration before puberty prevents the development of sexual behavior. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Maybe during puberty, they start including the act.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about what I know. When a male is castrated, he can't engage in the sexual act. But for some animals, maybe the act is still possible but weaker. Like in mice, the male doesn't engage, but in humans, maybe the act still happens but not as much. Or perhaps the act doesn't happen at all in some species.

Wait, another thought: I think in some primates, the act of castrating can lead to the loss of the ability to perform the sexual act. So in higher primates, when a male is castrated, they can't engage anymore. So option A says that. But option D says it causes complete loss. So which is it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall specific examples. For example, in some species of mice, when the female is castrated, the males stop engaging. In humans, I'm not sure if it's the same. But maybe in humans, the act doesn't happen because the behavior is altered. But in primates, after being castrated, the males stop performing the act.

So looking at the options:

Option A: In higher primates, male can't perform the act, provided the male is mature.

Option D: Complete loss.

So if in higher primates, the male can't engage, then option A would be correct. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe in higher primates, the act can still be performed but is less frequent.

Wait, wait. Let me think about specific examples. Suppose in a study, when male moths were castrated, they couldn't perform the sexual act. So if the male is sexually mature, he can't engage. So that would support option A. But I'm not sure if mature males can still perform the act without the castration.

Wait, option A says "provided the male is sexually mature and experienced." So maybe the experience is that if he's mature, he can't engage.

Alternatively, maybe in some primates, the act is no longer possible. So the correct statement is that in higher primates, after castration, the male can't engage, so the answer would be A.

But another thought: I'm pretty sure that in higher primates, when a male is castrated, he can't perform the sexual act. So that would support option A.

Wait, but looking at option E: "Castration in primates has no effect on their sexual behavior at any stage of development." That sounds incorrect because I've heard that when males are castrated, their sexual behavior changes. So option E is probably incorrect.

So considering the options, the correct one should be that in higher primates, castration causes the loss of sexual behavior. So option A says that. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but what about option D? Does castration in primates cause their sexual behavior to completely disappear, or just reduce aggression, or neither?

Option B says in primates, castration reduces aggression but doesn't affect sexual behavior. So that's about aggression, not sexual behavior. So that's not the case. Because when a male is castrated, does his behavior change regarding aggression? Or is he still aggressive but less so.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Castration affects the behavior but doesn't necessarily eliminate the sexual act. So option A says that in higher primates, it doesn't affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is mature.

Wait, maybe in higher primates, the act can still be performed, but more subtly or less actively, so the male doesn't engage as much. So that would mean the act doesn't disappear, only the frequency and intensity.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, option A says 'provided the male is sexually mature and experienced.' So perhaps in these cases, the male is still able to engage the act, but perhaps more slowly or less effectively. So the act doesn't completely disappear.

So this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to find which option is correct.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option A. Because I've read that in higher primates, when a male is castrated, he can't perform the sexual act. So option A is correct because it states that in higher primates like man, the act of castration does not affect the ability to perform it, provided the male is mature and experienced.

Another angle: option D says it causes loss of sexual behavior. If that's the case, then option D would be correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me think about what each option says.

Option A: In higher primates, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced.

So, if a male is mature and experienced, he can't engage the act. But if he's not experienced, he can still engage but perhaps with less activity.

Wait, but the statement says 'provided the male is sexually mature and experienced.' So mature and experienced would mean that he can't engage.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe experience is not necessary. So perhaps option D is correct if the act is eliminated entirely.

Alternatively, option D says 'castration in primates results in complete loss of sexual behavior.' So if that's the case, then in higher primates, the male can't engage. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: Which of these options is correct based on my knowledge.

I recall that in higher primates, when a male is castrated, he can't engage in the sexual act. So that's option A. So the correct answer is A.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the effects of castration on the sexual behavior of primates and mice. When a male is castrated, his sexual behavior changes. In mice, the male stops engaging in the sexual act. In primates, this change is more profound. 

Option A states that in higher primates, such as man, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced. This aligns with the understanding that mature males in primates cannot engage in the sexual act after being castrated. 

Option D claims that castration results in complete loss of sexual behavior. While this might apply to some primates, such as the male moths, it does not apply universally. Other primates, like the male moths, can still perform the sexual act but at a reduced intensity.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer is:

ANSWER: A
