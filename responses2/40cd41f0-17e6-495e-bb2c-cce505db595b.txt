Okay, so I've got this question about passive personality jurisdiction. Hmm, I remember that passive personality is a legal concept related to crimes involving intimate or very close relationships, like domestic violence. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question is asking what defines the jurisdiction under passive personality jurisdiction. The options are A through J, each tying it to different factors. Let me think through each option.

Option A: Jurisdiction based on the country where the legal person was registered. I think registration is more about legal status, not jurisdiction.

Option B: Based on nationality. Nationality might influence, but I thought it's more about the specific individual's nationality, not the jurisdiction.

Option C: Relationship between the victim and the offender. Oh, that's a key point. Passive personality involves the relationship, so this seems relevant.

Option D: Country of the victims. That doesn't make sense because jurisdiction would be about who's liable, not who's the victim.

Option E: Severity of the offence. Severity affects the legal consequences, but not the jurisdiction.

Option F: Country of residence of the offender. That's the place where the person lives, which could influence jurisdiction.

Option G: International law applicable. International law might cover some aspects, but I'm not sure if that's the primary factor.

Option H: Based on the country of residence of the offender. Similar to F, but phrased differently.

Option I: Where the offence was committed. That's about the circumstances of the crime, not the jurisdiction.

Option J: Nationality of the witness. That's about evidence, not the jurisdiction itself.

So, the crux is about the relationship between the victim and the offender. Passive personality jurisdiction specifically applies to crimes involving close relationships, where the jurisdiction is based on the relationship between the parties involved. So the correct answer should be either C or F.

Wait, the question is about the jurisdiction, which is the legal system or jurisdiction. So it's about the relationship, not the nationality. Oh, but option C says it's based on the relationship between the victim and the offender. So that's correct.

I think the answer is C.
