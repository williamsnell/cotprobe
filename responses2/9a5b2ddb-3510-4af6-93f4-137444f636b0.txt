Question:

A woman leased a condo from the owner for a period of one year. After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?

Options:

A: After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.
B: Because the woman had indicated her intention to stay by remodeling the kitchen, the owner cannot revoke the option to purchase.
C: Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.
D: Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.
E: Because the woman had started using the condo as her own by remodeling it, this signified her acceptance of the purchase option.
F: Because the woman had lived in the condo for more than half the lease period, she has the right to purchase the property.
G: Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.
H: Because the owner had given written option to purchase the condo, the owner cannot revoke it unilaterally.
I: Because the woman had spent a significant amount on remodeling the kitchen, she had vested interest in the property thus forming an enforceable contract.
J: Because the woman had received written approval from the owner for remodeling, this constituted as acceptance of the purchase option.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about contracts, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, a woman leased a condo for a year. After six months, the owner gave her an option to buy the condo for $100k before the lease ends. She spent $10k to remodel the kitchen. A month before the lease ends, the owner told her he was revoking the option. Then, a week later, she wrote a notice of acceptance, but the owner said he refused. Now, she's suing for breach of contract. The question is, what's her strongest argument that the contract is enforceable?

The options are A to J, each with different reasons. I need to think through each possibility.

First, I remember that contracts can be options. So, the woman initially had a right to buy the condo. The owner gave her an option, which is a contract option. But the key here is whether she can revocate that option.

In some cases, if the option is not revocation is possible, it could be enforceable. Let me think about the reasons why the option might be unrevocable.

Option A says that because the owner knew she was relying on the offer to her detriment, the option contract resulted. I'm not sure about that. If the owner knew she was using the option, it might create a duty to refuse to revoke it, but I'm not sure if that's a valid reasoning. 

Option B says she offered to stay because of the kitchen remodel. But does the fact that she remodelled the kitchen make the option unrevocable? Or does that just mean she's not using the option, but the option itself is still valid? I think the fact that she's using it doesn't automatically make the option unrevocable. It depends on whether she's in a binding position to refuse to revoke it.

Option C states that the owner was a merchant and the option was irrevocable for three months. I recall that if the contract is an option, the option period is typically determined by the terms of the lease. If the original lease had a period, the option period would be, say, three months. But the question doesn't specify that. The owner just said he was going to revoke the option. If it's a revocable option, unrevocation is allowed. But if it's irrevocable, then the owner can't revoke. The question is, when you give an option, is it irrevocable?

Wait, I think in many jurisdictions, an option contract is irrevocable for the duration of the lease. So if the lease was for a year, the option would also last a year. But in this case, after six months, the owner gave her an option, but then the owner says he's going to revoke it. So if the option is irrevocable, the revocation is illegal. So that would be a strong argument, making the option contract unenforceable. But the question is about her strongest argument.

Option D says the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance. She remodelled the kitchen, so maybe she was in a position to refuse the revocation. Alternatively, maybe the action of remodeling made her not want to accept the revocation. But I'm not sure if the fact that she's done the kitchen remodel makes the option unrevocable. It might just mean she's not using it, but the option itself is still valid.

Option E says she started using it, so it's acceptance. But I thought that was confusing. If someone remodels the property to their liking, they might be using the option. So the fact that she did that doesn't necessarily mean they're accepting the option. The option is a right to buy, and she's using it by remodeling. So that's not a valid argument.

Option F says she lived in the condo for more than half the lease, so she has the right to buy. I remember that in some states, if someone stays for a majority of the lease, they can buy the property, which would make the contract enforceable. But I'm not sure if that's the case for options. Or maybe it's a general right of passage. So if the owner's option is a right to buy, and she stayed for more than half the time, maybe she's in a position to accept it. But I'm not certain if that's how it works. I think in some cases, if the option is unrevocable, then she can accept it. But if it's a revocable option, she might still be able to accept it, but the revocation would be unenforceable.

Option G says she had a vested interest by remodeling, so she formed an enforceable contract. I'm not too sure about that. Vested interests are when someone has the legal right to make the contract. But I think the main issue here is revocation. If the option is unrevocable, then her revocation would be unenforceable. So that would make the contract enforceable. So if she's already in a position to refuse, then the option is unenforceable, so she can't breach.

Option H says the owner couldn't revoke it unilaterally. I remember that in some jurisdictions, you can't revoke an option unless you make the owner comply with the revocation. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Like, maybe you can't just revoke it without the owner's consent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the revocation is allowed if the option is unrevocable.

Option I says she had a significant amount spent remodeling, so she had a vested interest. But again, that's about the right of passage, not necessarily about revocation. But if the option is unrevocable, that creates a contract.

Option J says she had written approval, so that's acceptance. But if she was in a position to refuse, then she didn't accept, so the revocation was effective.

Now, the question is about the strongest argument that the contract is enforceable. The woman's strongest argument would be that the option is unrevocable. Because if it's unrevocable, then the revocation was a breach. But the options are about her reasoning for that.

Looking again, option G says because she had a vested interest, she formed an enforceable contract. I think that's a reason. She has a vested right to accept the option. But wait, the option is for purchase, and she's using it by remodeling. So maybe she has the right to accept it, but the revocation would be unenforceable. So she can't breach.

Option D says the owner's offer invited a return promise. If she's in a position to refuse the revocation, then the revocation is a breach. So that's a possible reason.

Option E: if she was using it, that doesn't mean she's accepting it. So E is not a valid argument.

Option G: If she had a vested interest, then she can't be forced to accept or refuse. So this would make the contract enforceable. So G and H are related.

Option F: For some states, staying for half the lease gives the right to buy. So if the owner's option is a right to buy, and she stayed for more than half, then she's in a position to accept. So F is a possible argument.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the right of passage. If the owner gave her an option to buy, and she stayed for more than half the lease, does she have the right to accept, making the contract enforceable? I think that's correct. So F is a valid reason.

But the question is about the strongest argument. So let's think about which is more correct.

Option G says she had a vested interest. Option F says she had the right to buy because she lived in for more than half.

Wait, the right of passage is when the person stays for more than half the lease. So she stayed for more than half, so F is correct. But is the ownership's option a valid contract even if she stays for more than half? Or is it that the option is unrevocable, making it enforceable, regardless of her stay?

I think the option is unrevocable, so it's a contract regardless of her stay. So F and G are both correct reasons.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest argument that the contract was formed. So which is more compelling.

If the option is unrevocable, then she can't breach, so that makes G a strong argument. Alternatively, if F is correct, but the owner can't revoke it unilaterally, then H is a reason. But I'm not sure about H.

Another angle: In some states, if the option is unrevocable, then the owner's revocation of the option is a breach. So the woman's argument is that the revocation was a breach. So the strongest argument would be that the option is unrevocable, making the revocation not allowed.

So looking at the options, which one states that the option is unrevocable? Let me check the options again.

Option G: Because the woman had a vested interest in the property, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.

Option H: Because the owner couldn't revoke it unilaterally.

So the ownership's not being able to revoke without the owner's consent would make the revocation illegal. Or, the option's unrevocability would mean that the revocation is ineffective.

So if the option is unrevocable, then H is a reason. But the woman's strongest argument might be that the option is unrevocable, making her not allowed to revoke it.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option G: The option is unrevocable because the owner was a merchant. So if the contract was an option, and the option is unrevocable, then the revocation is not allowed. So G is a possible reason.

Option H: The owner couldn't revoke it unilaterally. So the woman's argument is that the owner couldn't do it, so the revocation was a breach. So H is a possible reason.

But the question is about the strongest argument. So between G and H.

If the owner gave an option, and it was unrevocable, then H is a reason. Alternatively, if she had a vested right, then G is a reason.

I think the strongest argument is that the option is unrevocable. So the woman's strongest reason is G or H.

Wait, the question is about the woman's strongest. So which is more correct.

Another angle: The option was given, but the owner's revocation is a breach. So her strongest argument is that the revocation is a breach because the option is unrevocable.

So looking at the options, which one states that the option is unrevocable.

Alternatively, if she stayed for more than half, that's F, which is correct.

But the question is about her argument. She may argue that the option is unrevocable, making her not allowed to revoke, so G is correct.

Wait, but I think that the right of passage is not necessarily tied to the option being unrevocable. It's a separate matter. So if she stayed for more than half, that's a right of passage, making her an owner of the property. But if the option is unrevocable, then the owner's revocation of the option is a breach. So the strongest argument is that the option is unrevocable.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. In some jurisdictions, the option's unrevocability would mean that the owner can't revoke it, so the revocation is a breach.

So the woman's strongest argument would be that the option is unrevocable, making her not allowed to revoke it. So that would be option G.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach is to think about the answer options. Which one is correct?

I think the correct reasoning is that the option was unrevocable because the owner was a merchant, so the option is unrevocable for a certain period. So, the woman's strongest argument is option G, because if the option is unrevocable, the owner's revocation is illegal.

Alternatively, if the option was unrevocable, then the woman can't breach it. So her argument is that the revocation was a breach because the option is unrevocable. So that's option G.

Alternatively, if she had a right to accept, then the revocation would be ineffective. So that's option F.

But the question is about the strongest argument. I think the correct answer is option G because the option being unrevocable makes the revocation a breach.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Another way: The initial contract is an option. If the option is unrevocable, then the revocation is a breach. So the woman's strongest argument is that the option is unrevocable, so the revocation is a breach. So that would be option G.

Or, if she had a right of passage, then she's in a position to accept, but the option's revocation would still be a breach. So option F is also correct.

But the question is about the woman's strongest argument. She's the one initiating the suit, so she's the one presenting her case. The strongest argument would be the best reason to prove her case.

In some states, a right of passage is enforceable even if the option is unrevocable. So she might argue that she has a right of passage because she stayed for more than half, making F a valid reason.

But I'm not certain. Another thought: If the option is unrevocable, the owner can't revoke it unilaterally, so the revocation is a breach. So the woman's strongest argument is that the option is unrevocable, making the revocation illegal.

Wait, the answer options are G and H.

Option G: Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.

Option H: Because the owner had given written option to purchase, the owner cannot revoke it unilaterally.

So which is correct? I think the owner's ability to revoke the option unilaterally is a common reason for revocation being illegal. But is that accurate?

I recall that in some states, you can't revoke an option unilaterally unless the owner makes the revocation effective. So the option's unrevocability is the key.

So perhaps the correct answer is that the option is unrevocable, making the revocation a breach. Therefore, the strongest argument is that the option is unrevocable.

Looking at the options, that would be either G or H.

Another point: If the option is unrevocable, then the revocation is illegal. So option G is a reason.

If the owner can't revoke it unilaterally, that's a reason, which is option H.

But I'm not sure which is the strongest.

Wait, I think that if the option is unrevocable, then the woman's argument is correct because she can't breach. So the strongest argument would be that the option is unrevocable.

So I think that's option G.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach is to remember that in some states, a right of passage (staying for more than half the lease) is sufficient, but the option's unrevocability is a separate issue.

So, the correct answer would be G or H.

Wait, I think the correct answer is G because the owner's revocation of the option is a breach because the option is unrevocable. So the woman's strongest argument is that the option is unrevocable.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option H is correct because the owner couldn't revoke the option unilaterally, which would make it a breach. So her argument is that the owner couldn't do that, so the revocation was a breach.

But I'm getting stuck. Another way: the right of passage is not the same as the option being unrevocable. So if the option is unrevocable, the woman can't breach it, so that's a strong reason. So if option G is about the option being unrevocable, then that's the strongest.

So the answer is G.
</think>

The question revolves around determining the strongest argument for the woman's case that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner. The key issue is whether the owner's option to purchase the condo was unrevocable, as this would make her breach of contract a valid claim.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Suggests the option is unrevocable due to the owner knowing the woman relied on it. However, this reasoning is weak because reliance does not inherently make an option unrevocable.
   
2. **Option B**: Concludes that the owner's offer invited a return promise. This is incorrect because the owner's option is a contract option, not a return promise.

3. **Option C**: Argues the option was irrevocable for three months. This is incorrect because the option period is typically determined by the lease, not the option's irrevocability.

4. **Option D**: States that the woman had a vested interest in the property. This is not a valid argument because a vested interest is a right of passage, not a contract option.

5. **Option E**: Claims the woman had written approval. This is incorrect because the owner's revocation is a breach, not an acceptance.

6. **Option F**: Argues the woman had lived in the condo for more than half the lease, giving her a right to buy. This is correct because a majority of time in a lease typically grants a right of passage to the owner.

7. **Option G**: Argues the owner's option was unrevocable. This is strong because an unrevocable contract option makes the owner's revocation a breach of contract. The woman's strongest argument is that the option was unrevocable, making her not allowed to breach it.

8. **Option H**: Argues the owner couldn't revoke the option unilaterally. This is correct but less compelling than Option G because it focuses on the owner's inability to revoke, which is a valid reason for the revocation being illegal.

### Conclusion:
The woman's strongest argument is that the owner's option to buy the condo was unrevocable, making the revocation a breach of contract. This is best captured by **Option G**.
