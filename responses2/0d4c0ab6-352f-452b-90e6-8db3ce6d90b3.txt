Question:

Characterize and differentiate capital widening from capi-tal deepening.

Options:

A: Capital widening is when more workers are provided with capital goods to increase their productivity, while capital deepening is when each worker is provided with a greater amount of capital goods to be more productive.
B: Capital widening refers to the increase in technology to boost productivity, while capital deepening is the investment in human capital to improve worker efficiency.
C: Capital widening is the practice of reducing capital investment to focus on labor-intensive production, while capital deepening involves increasing automation and capital intensity.
D: Capital widening is when more capital goods are provided to the same number of workers, while capital deepening is when the number of workers is increased without changing the amount of capital goods.
E: Capital widening occurs when the same amount of capital is spread over a larger workforce, leading to a potential decrease in productivity, while capital deepening is when additional capital is used to upgrade existing workers' tools and machinery.
F: Capital widening and capital deepening both refer to the addition of more capital goods to increase productivity.
G: Capital widening is when each worker is provided with a greater amount of capital goods to be more productive, while capital deepening is when more workers are provided with capital goods to increase their productivity.
H: Capital widening is the process of diversifying investments across different sectors to reduce risk, while capital deepening is the concentration of investments within a particular sector to increase specialization.
I: Capital widening is the expansion of capital to new geographic regions, while capital deepening is the enhancement of capital within existing production facilities.
J: Capital widening is when the overall investment in the economy increases without regard to the labor force, while capital deepening is when investment is focused on innovation rather than on increasing the capital per worker.

Okay, so I have this question about capital widening and capital deepening. I'm a bit confused about what each term means, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that capital terms are a bit tricky, especially for someone just starting out. Let me try to recall what I know. Capital refers to physical assets used by a business, like machinery, technology, or even human capital (like employees). So, both widening and deepening relate to how capital is managed in an economy.

The question is asking me to characterize and differentiate between the two terms. Let me read the options again. The options are A to J, each giving a different description of these concepts.

I think I need to remember the exact definitions. From what I recall, capital deepening is when an economy invests more in capital goods. Like, each worker gets a bigger piece of the capital tools. So, it's about increasing the amount of capital per worker. That would mean more investment per person, same sector, same technologies maybe? So, capital deepening is about expanding the capital stock.

On the other hand, capital widening might involve investing in different sectors or types of capital. For example, expanding technology or using new technologies in different industries. This doesn't necessarily increase the same workers' capital but spreads out the investment across different areas. So, it's about diversification or spread rather than concentration.

Let me look at the options:

Option A says widening is giving more workers capital, deepening is each worker gets more capital. Wait, that seems the opposite. Deepening would mean each worker has more capital. But I thought deepening is more about increasing per capita investment. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: Widen refers to technology, deepening to human capital. That doesn't sound right. I don't think technology is part of capital deepening. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Widen is reducing investment, deepening is automation. No, that doesn't fit. I don't think that's accurate. C seems incorrect.

Option D: Widen is same workers getting more capital, deepening is more workers with less. That seems to align with what I thought. So D might be correct.

Option E: Widen is same capital spread over more workers, deepening is investing in tools. Hmm, E says widening is same capital over larger workforce. That's actually more like capital deepening. Because if the capital is being spread, each worker has less, which is deepening. So E's description of widening is wrong, and deepening is correct. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Both terms mean adding capital. So F is incorrect because they are different concepts.

Option G: Widen is more capital per worker, deepening is more workers with less. That's opposite of what I thought. Wait, G says "capital per worker" for widening, which would mean capital is given to more workers. So G is correct. Wait, no, G says widening is when more capital is given to the same workers. So G's description of widening is correct, but deepening is when more workers get less capital. So G's description of deepening is wrong. So G isn't correct.

Option H: Widen is expanding across sectors, deepening is more investment in one sector. That sounds like the opposite of what I remember. H's description of deepening is correct about concentration, but deepening is supposed to be investing in more capital per worker, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Widen is capital expansion to new regions, deepening is enhancing within existing facilities. That's similar to what I thought earlier. So I's description is correct.

Option J: Widen is overall investment without labor, deepening is focus on innovation. So J is mixing up concepts. Deepening is about investment, not just innovation, so J's description is wrong.

So, looking back, I think options D, E, and I are candidates. Wait, let me clarify:

- Option D: Widen is same workers with more capital (so capital per worker is higher). Deepening is more capital per worker? Or is it each worker getting more? No, wait, in D, Widen is same workers, deepening is more workers. Wait, no, D says Widen is same workers with more capital (capital per worker increases). Deepening is each worker getting more capital. That's opposite of what I thought. Wait, no, I thought deepening is when each worker has more capital, so D is incorrect. Oh wait, that's a mistake on my part. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recap. Capital deepening is when you increase investment in capital goods, leading to higher per-person investment. So, each worker has more capital (capital per worker increases). So, in D, Widen is same workers with more capital (capital per worker up), deepening is each worker gets more capital, which would be D's description for deepening as each worker has more. So D's description is correct for both? Wait, no, D says Widen is when more workers are provided with capital. Wait, no, D says:

"D: Capital widening is when more capital goods are provided to the same number of workers, while capital deepening is when the number of workers is increased without changing the amount of capital goods."

Wait, that can't be right because deepening is more about capital per worker. So D is incorrect because deepening is more about per worker.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

The correct definitions, as I remember:

Capital deepening involves an economy expanding its capital stock. This could be through investments in machinery, technology, or other capital goods. It's about increasing the amount of capital available to each worker. So capital deepening is about expanding the capital per worker.

Capital widening isn't a standard term I've heard, but perhaps it refers to investing in different sectors or technologies. So it's about expanding the scope of capital investment, not necessarily per worker. So capital widening could involve different types of capital or investments in new industries.

So looking at the options again.

Option D: Widen is same workers with more capital, deepening is each worker more capital. That's opposite to what I thought. So D is incorrect.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the options are:

Looking for options that say:

Widen: same workers, more capital (capital per worker).

Deepening: each worker has more capital.

So let me check each option.

Option D: Widen same workers, deepening each gets more.

That's opposite of what I thought. So D is incorrect.

Option I: Widen is capital expansion to new regions, deepening is enhancing within facilities. So I's description aligns with what I thought. So I is correct.

Option G: Widen is capital per worker, deepening is more workers. No, G says 'capital per worker' for widening, which would be incorrect because deepening is about more per workers.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it this way: Capital deepening is when the economy invests more in physical capital. So for each worker, the amount of capital they have increases. So capital per worker increases. So, in deepening, it's capital per worker that goes up.

Capital widening is when the economy is expanding its capital stock in various ways, not necessarily per worker. So perhaps it's about investing in different areas or expanding the scope.

Looking at the options again:

Option I: Widen is capital expansion to new regions, deepening is enhancing within facilities. So I's description is correct.

Option J: says both are investment in economy. No, J is mixing investment and focus on capital per worker.

Option H: Widen is expanding sectors, deepening is focusing on concentration. No, H's deepening is more about concentration.

Option E: Widen is same workers with more investment (capital per worker up). Deepening is investment in tools, which is more of an investment in human capital. So E's description is wrong because deepening would be about human capital.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to pick the correct options.

Based on my earlier analysis, the correct terms are:

- Capital deepening: increase in capital per worker.

- Capital widening: expansion of capital investment across different sectors.

So, looking for options that say:

Widen: same workers, more capital (capital per worker)

Deepening: each worker gets more capital.

Looking through the options:

Option I: Widen is capital expansion to new regions (so capital per worker increases, same workers), and deepening is enhancing within facilities, so capital per worker increases as well. So I's description aligns with this.

Option D: Widen is same workers, deepening is each worker more. That's opposite of what I thought. So D's description is wrong.

Option I: Correct.

Option G: Widen is capital per worker, which is correct. But deepening is more workers, which is wrong. So G is incorrect.

So only option I correctly describes capital widening and deepening.

Wait, what about option D? Let me read it again.

Option D: Widen is more capital goods to same workers (capital per worker increases). Deepening is each worker more capital. That's the opposite of what I thought. So D is wrong.

So the correct option is I. So the answer should be I.

To differentiate between capital widening and capital deepening:

- **Capital deepening** involves an expansion of the economy's capital stock, typically through investments in machinery, technology, or other capital goods. This leads to an increase in the capital per worker, meaning each worker has access to more capital. This is often described as investing more in existing capital goods.

- **Capital widening**, on the other hand, refers to the expansion of capital investment across different sectors or types of capital goods. It does not focus on increasing the capital per worker but rather on diversifying where capital is invested.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. Widen is not about more workers with capital; it is about capital per worker. Deepening is not about increasing per capita investment.
- **B**: Incorrect. Capital deepening is not about technology; it is about capital investment.
- **C**: Incorrect. Widen is not about reducing investment; it is about expanding the capital stock.
- **D**: Incorrect. Widen is not about capital per worker; it is about capital per worker. Deepening is not about increasing per capita investment.
- **E**: Incorrect. Widen is not about capital per worker; it is about increasing capital per worker. Deepening is not about investment in human capital.
- **F**: Incorrect. Both terms do not refer to the addition of capital.
- **G**: Incorrect. Widen is not about capital per worker; it is about capital per worker. Deepening is not about increasing the number of workers.
- **H**: Incorrect. Widen is not about expanding sectors; it is about increasing capital per worker. Deepening is not about enhancing within a sector.
- **I**: Correct. Widen is capital expansion to new regions (capital per worker increases), and deepening is enhancing within facilities (capital per worker increases).
- **J**: Incorrect. Both terms do not refer to investment in the economy.

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **I**, as it accurately describes capital widening and deepening.

**ANSWER: I**
