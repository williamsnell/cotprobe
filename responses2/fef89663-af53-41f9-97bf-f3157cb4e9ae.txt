Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about a psychological phenomenon. The question is asking which term describes like-minded groups taking more extreme positions than the individuals in the group. The options include terms like group polarization, deindividuation, group escalation, conformity pressure, groupthink, shared identity effect, etc.

Hmm. Let's break it down. The term refers to a situation where people who are similar are more likely to take extreme positions. So like, imagine a group of people who all share a common interest, say, all interested in politics. If they all agree, they might all decide to vote more strongly in the election, leading to polarization. That's probably group polarization.

Group polarization is when a group splits into two opposing groups, leading to extreme positions. That makes sense because if the group is cohesive, they would tend to agree and perhaps not take extreme positions. So their extreme positions would mean the group becomes divided, hence polarization.

Looking at the options, option A is group polarization. Option J is collective bias. I think collective bias refers to a group's tendency to have a shared opinion even when they should be opposing. Like, some groups might form a consensus even when they shouldn't, leading to polarization. Wait, so group polarization is when the group as a whole takes extreme positions, while collective bias is a form of polarization where the group's collective opinion is the same as the individual's.

Wait, another angle: groupthink is when the group makes irrational decisions based on group dynamics. But the question is about extreme positions, so groupthink might not be the correct term here.

Option E is group escape. That's when individuals feel more secure in a group, but I don't think that's related.

Option J, collective bias, might be a form of groupthink. Or maybe not, because collective bias is a type of polarization. Alternatively, group polarization is a specific case of collective bias.

Wait, let me think again. Group polarization is when the group as a whole becomes more extreme, leading to more division. That's exactly what the question describes. So the phenomenon is group polarization.

Looking at the options, option A is group polarization. So the correct answer should be A.

The phenomenon described is known as group polarization, where like-minded individuals within a group tend to take more extreme positions, leading to increased group division. This corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
