Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a helium-neon laser emission. Hmm, I remember that in lasers like He-Ne, the energy transitions between different energy levels produce the light we see. The question is about the pumping energy required. Wait, what's pumping energy again? Oh right, it's the energy input needed to excite atoms from a lower energy state to a higher one. So the energy required would be the difference between the two levels.

The problem says that the transition from 3s to 2p emits at 632.8 nm. But wait, the question gives the energy of the 2p level as 15.2e-19 J. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

No, wait, the 2p level's energy is given as 15.2 ×10^-19 J. So I think the setup is that the 2p level is already at that energy, and the 3s level must have a higher energy because the transition emits the laser light. So the pumping energy would be the energy difference between 3s and 2p.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The pumping energy is done on the atoms to get them to higher energy levels. So to calculate the pumping energy, I need the energy of the 3s state minus the 2p state. Because the transition from 3s to 2p emits the laser, which means 3s is higher in energy than 2p. So the required energy is (E3s - E2p).

But wait, the given energy of 2p is 15.2e-19 J. So E2p =15.2e-19 J. Then I need E3s.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the energy of 3s. Oh wait, but the emission wavelength is 632.8 nm. That's the wavelength of the laser light, which is emitted when the 3s→2p transition happens. So the energy of the emitted photon (and thus the energy difference between 3s and 2p) can be found using the formula E= hc/λ.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "transition from the 3s to the 2p neon level gives emission of wavelength 632.8 nm." So the energy of the 3s→2p transition is E_photon = hc/(λ). But the question wants the pumping energy. So the pumping is the energy required to get the atoms from the ground state (or whatever lower state) to 3s. But wait, the 2p level is already at 15.2e-19 J. So perhaps the 3s is at a higher energy level, which is what the pumping is for.

Wait, but the given 2p energy is 15.2e-19 J, which is part of the setup. So I think the energy of 3s is higher. So to find the pumping energy, I need to find E3s - E2p.

But wait, the problem says the 2p level has energy equal to 15.2e-19 J. So E2p =15.2e-19 J. So the energy difference is E3s - 15.2e-19 J.

So I need to compute E3s. But how? Because the problem gives me the wavelength of the emitted photon, which is from 3s to 2p.

Wait, yes. So E_photon = hc/λ. So E_photon = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (632.8e-9 m). I can compute that.

Once I have that, I can find E3s by adding it to E2p. Because E3s = E2p + E_photon.

Wait, but wait, the energy of the 3s level is higher than the 2p because the transition emits the photon. So E3s is E2p + E_photon.

So the pumping energy is E_photon. Because the atoms are being pumped from the lower state to the higher state, and the energy provided is the photon's energy. So the pumping energy is the energy of the emitted photon.

Wait, but the question gives the 2p energy as 15.2e-19 J. So the energy of the 3s is higher than that. So the difference is the photon's energy.

But then the pumping energy is equal to the energy required to get the atoms to the higher state, which is the energy of the photon. So the answer would be E_photon, which is hc/λ.

So let's compute that.

Calculating E_photon:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 632.8e-9 m (since 1 nm is 1e-9 m)

E = (6.626e-34) * (3e8) / (632.8e-9)
First, compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Denominator: 632.8e-9 m = 6.328e-7 m

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = ?

Let me compute that.

Divide 1.9878e-25 by 6.328e-7.

1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 ≈ (1.9878 / 6.328) * 1e-18.

Compute 1.9878 /6.328 ≈ approximately 0.315. So E≈0.315e-18 J = 3.15e-19 J.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately.

1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = (1.9878 /6.328) * 1e-25+7 = (approx 0.315) * 1e-18 → 3.15e-19 J.

So E_photon ≈3.15e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.12e-19 J. Close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me do precise calculation.

Compute 632.8e-9 m in meters: 632.8e-9 = 6.328e-7 m.

So E= (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / 6.328e-7.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 6.328e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = (1.9878 /6.328) ) *1e-25 +7 → 1e-18.

Compute 1.9878/6.328:

6.328 × 0.315 = 6.328 * 0.3 = 1.8984, 6.328 *0.015 = 0.09492. So 1.8984 +0.09492=1.99332. So approximately 0.315. But wait, 1.9878 is a bit less than 1.99332. So 0.315 is a bit over. Let's compute 1.9878 /6.328.

Compute 1.9878 ÷6.328.

6.328 × 0.315 → as above, it's 1.99332. The numerator is 1.9878, which is 0.00552 less than that. So 0.315 - (0.00552 /6.328) → 0.00552 /6.328 ≈0.000873. So 0.315 -0.000873= 0.314127.

So approximately 0.31413.

So E≈0.31413e-18 J → 3.1413e-19 J.

Hmm, that's about 3.14e-19 J. Looking at the options, option A is 3.12e-19 J. So that's quite close. But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: The 2p level's energy is given as 15.2e-19 J. The question says the pumping energy is the energy required to get the 3s to 2p transition. So the 3s must have higher energy. So the pumping energy is the energy of the transition, which is the emitted photon's energy.

So the pumping energy is E_photon = hc/λ.

Which is approximately 3.14e-19 J, but let's compute it more accurately.

Compute h*c / lambda:

h =6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

λ=632.8e-9 m → 6.328e-7 m

Compute hc = (6.626e-34)(3e8) = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, E_photon = 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = (1.9878 /6.328) * 1e-18.

1.9878 /6.328 ≈0.314.

So E_photon ≈0.314e-18 J → 3.14e-19 J.

But the options: option A is 3.12e-19 J. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.9878e-25 /6.328e-7.

Compute 1.9878 /6.328.

Let me compute this division step by step.

Divide 1.9878 by 6.328.

Let me compute 1.9878 ÷6.328.

6.328 × 0.314 = ?

6.328 × 0.3 = 1.8984.

6.328 ×0.014 = 0.088592.

Adding them, 1.8984 +0.088592 = 1.986992. Which is very close to 1.9878.

So 6.328 ×0.314=1.986992.

The target is 1.9878. The difference is 1.9878 -1.986992=0.000808.

So the additional decimal is needed. 0.000808 /6.328 → approximately 0.0001276.

So total is 0.314 +0.0001276=0.3141276.

So 0.3141276e-18 J → 3.141276e-19 J.

Which is approximately 3.14e-19 J. So in the options, the closest is option A:3.12e-19 J.

But wait, none of the options is exactly 3.14. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, the given 2p energy is 15.2e-19 J. So E2p is 15.2e-19 J. E3s is E2p + E_photon.

Wait, but if the transition is from 3s to 2p, the 3s is higher. So the energy of 3s is E_photon + E2p.

So E3s = E_photon + 15.2e-19 J.

But the problem is asking for the pumping energy, which is the energy required to get atoms to 3s. So the energy needed is E3s - E2p = E_photon.

Which is 3.14e-19 J.

But the options don't have 3.14e-19 J. The closest is option A:3.12e-19.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy of 3s correctly.

Wait, another way: the energy required to pump the atom from 2p to 3s is the 3s - 2p energy difference. So it's the same as the emitted photon's energy.

So the pumping energy is 3.14e-19 J. But the options don't have that.

Wait, are any of the options matching? Let me look again.

Options:

A:3.12e-19

B:21.5e-19

C:18.32e-19

D:19.5e-19

E:15.2e-19

F:22.7e-19

G:20.32e-19

H:16.4e-19

I:17.2e-19

J:12.1e-19

Wait, the correct answer would be 3.14e-19, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the energy with more precise numbers.

Compute h*c/(lambda):

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)

c = 299792458 m/s

Wait, but for precise calculation, perhaps I should use more accurate constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses approximate values.

Wait, in the problem, the wavelength is given as 632.8 nm. So 632.8e-9 meters.

Compute h*c:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 632.8e-9 m:

1.9878e-25 /6.328e-7 = (1.9878 /6.328) * 1e-18.

Compute 1.9878 divided by 6.328.

Using a calculator: 6.328 × 0.314 = 1.986992.

So 1.9878 /6.328 = 0.3141276.

So E_photon = 0.3141276e-18 J, which is 3.141276e-19 J.

So approximately 3.14e-19 J. So the nearest option is A:3.12e-19 J.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy of the 3s level and the energy of the 2p is given, so the energy pumped is the difference.

Wait, another approach: The energy for the transition is the difference between 3s and 2p. So the pumping energy is that difference.

Yes, but the problem says the energy of 2p is 15.2e-19 J. So the 3s must be higher by that same amount.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, another thought: the given 2p energy is 15.2e-19 J. So E2p is 15.2e-19 J. So if the 3s energy is E_photon + E2p, then E3s - E2p is E_photon.

But in the problem, the energy of the 2p is given, but the question is about the pumping energy, which is E_photon.

So the correct answer is approximately 3.14e-19 J, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the options are rounded. Looking at the options, option A is 3.12e-19, which is 3.12e-19 J. So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To determine the pumping energy required for the transition from the 3s level to the 2p level in a helium-neon laser, we use the relationship between the energy of the emitted photon and the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of the emitted photon is given by:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 632.8 \, \text{nm} = 632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength of the emitted light).

### Step 1: Compute \( E_{\text{photon}} \)
First, calculate the numerator \( hc \):
\[
hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Next, divide by the wavelength \( \lambda \):
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{632.8 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.9878}{632.8} \times 10^{-18}.
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\frac{1.9878}{632.8} \approx 0.00031413.
\]

Thus:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} \approx 0.00031413 \times 10^{-18} = 3.1413 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Match with the options
The computed value of \( E_{\text{photon}} \) is approximately \( 3.14 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Among the given options:
- Option A: \( 3.12 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option B: \( 21.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option C: \( 18.32 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option D: \( 19.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option E: \( 15.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option F: \( 22.7 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option G: \( 20.32 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option H: \( 16.4 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option I: \( 17.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \),
- Option J: \( 12.1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

The closest match to \( 3.14 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) is **Option A: \( 3.12 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)**.

### Final Answer
ANSWER: A
