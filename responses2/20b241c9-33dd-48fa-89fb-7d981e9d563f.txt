Okay, so I've got this integral problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because integrals can sometimes trip me up. Let me see what the question is. It's asking for the definite integral from -3 to 1 of (7x² + x +1) dx. The options are all numbers, but they look like decimal numbers, which makes me think they're approximations since 7x² +x +1 is a polynomial that would integrate to a polynomial, but the options don't have an 'x'. Hmm, maybe it's a typo? Oh wait, no, perhaps they're giving the numerical values of the definite integral. Let me focus on the math part first.

I remember that integrating a polynomial term by term is straightforward. So for the integral from a to b of (7x² +x +1) dx, I can integrate each term separately. The integral of x² is (1/3)x³, the integral of x is (1/2)x², and the integral of 1 is x. So putting it all together, the indefinite integral would be (7*(1/3)x³) + (1/2 x²) + x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. But since this is a definite integral, the constants will cancel out.

Wait, let me write that out properly. The integral ∫ (7x² + x +1) dx from -3 to 1 is [7*(1/3)x³ + (1/2)x² + x] evaluated from x = -3 to x=1.

Let me compute each part step by step. Let me calculate the antiderivative at x=1 first:

At x=1:
7*(1/3)*(1)^3 = 7*(1/3) = 7/3 ≈ 2.333
(1/2)*(1)^2 = 1/2 = 0.5
x = 1
So adding those up: 7/3 + 0.5 + 1. Let me convert everything to thirds to add easily.

7/3 is approximately 2.333, 0.5 is 1.5/3, and 1 is 3/3. So adding them: 7/3 + (1.5/3) + (3/3) = (7 + 1.5 + 3)/3 = (11.5)/3 ≈ 3.8333.

Wait, actually, 7/3 is 2.333..., 0.5 is 0.5, and 1 is 1. So adding them: 2.333 + 0.5 = 2.833, plus 1 is 3.833.

Now, at x = -3:

Calculating each term:

7*(1/3)*(-3)^3. Let me compute (-3)^3, which is -27. So 7*(1/3)*(-27) = 7*(-9) = -63.

Next term: (1/2)*(-3)^2. (-3)^2 is 9. So (1/2)*9 = 4.5.

Third term: x = -3.

So adding them up: -63 + 4.5 + (-3) = -63 + 4.5 = -58.5, plus (-3) is -61.5.

Wait, but the definite integral is the upper value minus the lower value. So F(1) - F(-3) = (3.8333) - (-61.5) = 3.8333 + 61.5 = 65.3333.

Wait, but wait a second, 3.8333 plus 61.5 would be 65.3333. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't mix up any signs.

At x=1:

7x² = 7*(1) =7. Integral term is (7/3)x³. So (7/3)(1) =7/3 ≈ 2.333.

x term: (1/2)x² = (1/2)(1) =0.5.

x term: x=1.

Sum: 2.333 + 0.5 +1 = 3.8333.

At x=-3:

x³ is (-3)^3=-27. So 7*(1/3)*(-27) =7*(-9)= -63.

(1/2)x²: x² is 9, so (1/2)*9 =4.5.

x term: x=-3.

Sum: -63 +4.5 -3 = (-63 -3) +4.5 =-66 +4.5= -61.5.

So F(1) - F(-3) is 3.8333 - (-61.5) =3.8333 +61.5=65.3333. Which is 65.333.

Looking at the options, option H is 65.333. So I think the correct answer is H.

The integral of \(7x^2 + x + 1\) from -3 to 1 is computed by finding the antiderivative and evaluating it at the bounds. The antiderivative is \(\frac{7}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x\). Evaluating at 1 gives approximately 3.833, and at -3 gives approximately -61.5. Subtracting, the definite integral is approximately 65.333.

Answer: H
