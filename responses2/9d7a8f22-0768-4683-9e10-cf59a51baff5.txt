Question:

Draw one card at random from a standard deck of cards. The sample space $S$ is the collection of the 52 cards. Assume that the probability set function assigns $1 / 52$ to each of the 52 outcomes. Let
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\{x: x \text { is a jack, queen, or king }\}, \\
B & =\{x: x \text { is a } 9,10, \text { or jack and } x \text { is red }\}, \\
C & =\{x: x \text { is a club }\}, \\
D & =\{x: x \text { is a diamond, a heart, or a spade }\} .
\end{aligned}
$$

C: $\frac{13}{52}$
D: $\frac{15}{52}$
E: $\frac{10}{52}$
F: $\frac{7}{52}$
G: $\frac{11}{52}$
H: $\frac{9}{52}$
I: $\frac{8}{52}$
J: $\frac{16}{52}$

Okay, so I need to find the probability P(A) where event A is defined as all the jacks, queens, and kings in a standard deck. Let me think about this step by step.

First, a standard deck has 52 cards. Each suit has 13 cards: numbers 2 through 10, and then the face cards which are jack, queen, king. There are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.

So, for event A, we're looking at all the jack, queen, and king cards. Since each suit has one jack, one queen, and one king, each of these ranks has four cards in the deck (one for each suit). So, the number of jacks is 4, queens is 4, and kings is 4. So that's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cards in total.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says to count all jacks, queens, and kings. So, yeah, 12 cards. So the size of event A is 12.

Since each card has an equal probability of being drawn, the probability P(A) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So that's 12/52.

Looking at the options, option B is 12/52. So the answer should be B.

To find the probability \( P(A) \), we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes for event \( A \) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

- Event \( A \): All jacks, queens, and kings.
- Each suit has 13 cards (2 through 10, jack, queen, king), and there are 4 suits.
- Number of jacks, queens, and kings: \( 3 \text{ ranks} \times 4 \text{ suits} = 12 \text{ cards} \).
- Total number of cards in the deck: \( 52 \).

Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{12}{52} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

**ANSWER: B**
