Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about three particles on an x-axis. Particle 1 has a charge of +q, particle 2 has 4q, and they're separated by a distance L, which is 9 cm. We need to find the x-coordinate of particle 3 such that it doesn't move when released. 

Hmm, right. So when you release particle 3, it should feel a net force of zero because otherwise, it would start moving. That means the forces from particles 1 and 2 on particle 3 must balance each other out. So the gravitational forces or electric forces from 1 and 2 must cancel each other.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "particle 3 is to be located such that the three particles remain in place when released." Oh, so they're all fixed, and when released, they stay in place. So their net force must be zero. However, I think because they're point charges, the electric force is what matters here. So the sum of the electric forces acting on particle 3 must be zero.

So particle 3 is located at some point along the x-axis. Let's say its position is x. Particle 1 is at 0 cm (assuming that's where particle 1 is), and particle 2 is at 9 cm (since L is 9 cm).

So let me visualize this. The setup is a straight line with three points. Assume particle 1 is at x=0, particle 2 at x=9 cm. Particle 3 is at x= ?, which we need to find.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't specify whether particle 3 is between the two charges or on the same side as one of them. Oh, but in the options, the possible x coordinates range from about 0 to 18 cm. Let's think about where particle 3 can be placed such that the forces cancel.

Let me denote the charge of particle 3 as q3. But wait, the problem doesn't give the type of charge. Oh, wait, the problem says "particle 3 of charge q3" but doesn't specify. Hmm, wait, no, wait no—wait, the problem says particle 1 is +q, particle 2 is +4q, so particle 3 is q3. But the question is about the x-coordinate. Wait, but for the forces to cancel, the charges' signs must matter.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether particle 3 is positive or negative. Oh wait, wait, wait, the problem says "particle 3 of charge q3". Oh, but the problem has particle 1 as +q and particle 2 as +4q. Wait, no, the initial charges are +q and +4q, but what about particle 3? The problem doesn't specify, so I think I might have misunderstood. Wait, looking back: Oh, wait, the problem says "particle 3 is to be located such that the three particles remain in place when released." So the setup is that particle 3 is under the influence of particles 1 and 2. But since particle 3 is being held in place when released, the net force on it must be zero.

Wait, but for this to happen, the electric forces from 1 and 2 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the force from 1 on 3 must balance the force from 2 on 3.

But wait, if particle 3 is between 1 and 2, then the forces would be in opposite directions. If it's on the same side as particle 1, then the force from particle 2 would be in the opposite direction to particle 1's force.

Wait, but let me think about the positions. Let's say the positions are as follows: particle 1 is at x=0, particle 2 at x=9 cm. So the distance between them is 9 cm. Let’s say particle 3 is located at x = d cm. So the distance from particle 1 to particle 3 is |d - 0| = d cm. The distance from particle 2 to particle 3 is |d - 9| cm.

The electric force on particle 3 due to particle 1 would be F1 = k * q * q3 / d², and the force due to particle 2 would be F2 = k * 4q * q3 / (d-9)² (but the sign depends on the direction).

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the force from particle 1 on particle 3 is F1 = k q q3 / d². But since particle 1 is positive, and if particle 3 is positive (assuming q3 positive), then the force would be repulsive. Similarly, particle 2 is positive, so if particle 3 is positive, the force from 2 would be repulsive, pushing in the same direction as the force from 1. So in this case, if particle 3 is between particles 1 and 2, the forces would both be pushing particle 3 away, so the net force would be the sum of two repulsive forces. But if the net force is zero, then that's only possible if the two forces are in opposite directions. So if particle 3 is placed on the side of particle 1, then the force from 2 would be in the opposite direction of 1's force. But wait, no wait, if particle 3 is on the same side as 1 (x < 9 cm), then the distance from 2 to 3 is 9 - d. So if d is less than 9, then the distance from 2 to 3 is positive, but the direction of the force from 2 would be towards particle 2, i.e., to the right (assuming particle 3 is on the left of 2). So in that case, the forces would be in opposite directions. So F1 would be acting to the right (or left, depending on the sign of q3), and F2 would be acting to the left (assuming particle 3 is to the left of 2). So their directions would be opposite. So if particle 3 is placed between 1 and 2 (d between 0 and 9 cm), then F1 and F2 would be in opposite directions. 

Wait, but the problem is that the net force must be zero. So the forces from 1 and 2 must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So the equation would be F1 = F2, but considering their directions.

But wait, if the forces are in opposite directions, then F1 = -F2. Which would mean that F1 = k q q3 / d² = - k *4q q3 / ( (9-d)^2 ). The negative sign indicates that the forces are in opposite directions, so F1 = - (4 q q3 / ( (9-d)^2 )) * 4q? No, wait, no, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The force from 1 on 3 is F1 = k * q * q3 / d², acting in the direction away from 1 (since both are positive), so along the positive x-direction. The force from 2 on 3 is F2 = k *4q * q3 / ( (9-d)^2 ), and since particle 3 is at position d, which is less than 9 (assuming d is between 0 and 9), then (9 - d) is positive. So the force from 2 on 3 would be directed towards particle 2, which is to the left (negative x-direction). So F2 is negative.

So for the net force to be zero, F1 (positive) must equal the magnitude of F2 (positive), but in opposite directions. So F1 = - F2.

So:

k q q3 / d² = - (k *4q * q3) / ( (9 - d)^2 )

Wait, but wait, let me plug in the signs. Since F1 is positive (force from 1 to 3 is right), and F2 is negative (force from 2 on 3 is left), so F1 = - F2.

So:

k q q3 / d² = - (k *4q * q3) / ( (9 - d)^2 )

Wait, but this would imply that both sides are positive. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the forces are in opposite directions, so the equation would be F1 = - F2.

So:

k q q3 / d² = - (k *4q * q3) / ( (9 - d)^2 )

Wait, but both forces are in opposite directions. So F1 is to the right, F2 is to the left. So for the net force to be zero, F1 + F2 = 0 → F1 = - F2.

So:

k q q3 / d² = - (k *4q * q3) / ( (9 - d)^2 )

But wait, the equation has to account for the direction. Let me write the magnitudes:

|F1| = |F2| → (k q q3 / d² ) = (k *4q * q3 ) / ( (9 - d)^2 )

We can cancel k q q3 from both sides (assuming q3 isn't zero, which it can't be because it's a particle and has charge). So:

1 / d² = 4 / (9 - d)^2

Take square roots on both sides:

1/d = 2/(9 - d)

Multiply both sides by d (9 - d):

(9 -d) = 2 d

9 = 3 d → d = 3 cm.

Hmm, so particle 3 is placed at 3 cm from the origin (x=3 cm). So the position is 3 cm. Looking at the options, option G is 18 cm, option D is 12 cm, etc. Wait, 3 cm is not among the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should have considered the scenario where particle 3 is on the other side of particle 1. Let me think again. Let me imagine particle 3 is to the left of particle 1 (d < 0). So the distance from particle 1 is |d|, and from particle 2, it's |d -9| = 9 - d (since d is negative, so 9 - d is positive). 

In that case, the forces would be in the same direction. Because, particle 3 is to the left of particle 1, so the force from 1 on 3 is to the left, and the force from 2 on 3 is to the right. Wait, no. Wait, when particle 3 is to the left of both particles 1 and 2, then the distance from 1 is d (negative, but distance is positive). The distance from 2 is (d -9), but since d is negative, that's (negative -9) = negative. Wait, no: the distance is always positive. So if particle 3 is at x= -d, then the distance from 1 to 3 is (-d -0) = -d (but distance is positive, so it's d). The distance from 2 to 3 is ( -d - 9) = -(d +9) → but the distance is | -d -9 | = (d +9) cm.

So, in this scenario, F1 is to the left, F2 is to the right. So the forces are in opposite directions. So the net force would be F1 (left) + F2 (right). We need this to be zero.

So F1 = F2.

Wait, but F1 is the magnitude, and F2 is the magnitude as well. But their directions are opposite, so their signs are opposite. So:

F1 = k q q3 / d² (to the left)

F2 = k *4q * q3 / ( (d +9) )² (to the right)

So net force F1 + F2 = 0 → F1 = F2

So:

k q q3 / d² = k *4q * q3 / ( (d +9)^2 )

Again, cancel k q q3 → 1/d² = 4/(d+9)^2

So (d +9)^2 = 4 d² → take square roots.

d +9 = 2 d → 9 = d → d =9 cm.

Wait, that can't be right because if d is 9, then particle 3 is at x=9 cm, which is where particle 2 is. So the forces from 1 and 2 on 3 would be zero because d=9, so the distance from 1 is 9, so F1 is k q q3 /9², and the distance from 2 is zero, so F2 is infinite, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Another approach: perhaps the forces from 1 and 2 must be in the same direction. So if particle 3 is to the right of both particles, then F1 and F2 are both to the right. So net force zero would require F1 = F2.

Wait, but then particle 3 is at x = d >9 cm. So distance from 1 is d, from 2 is (d-9).

So F1 = k q q3 / d² (to the right)

F2 = k *4q * q3 / (d-9)^2 (to the right)

Net force: F1 + F2 = 0 → F1 = - F2, but both are to the right (positive), so their signs would add. So:

k q q3 /d² = - (k *4 q q3 ) / (d-9)^2

But q3 is positive? Or negative? Wait, because if particle 3 is to the right of both, then the forces are both repulsive towards the right. So the net force is to the right. So for the net force to be zero, we'd need F1 and F2 to cancel each other. But since both are in the same direction, they can't cancel. So this scenario (particle 3 to the right of both) won't work.

So, only the first scenario (particle 3 between 1 and 2) makes sense. But earlier when I calculated, I got d =3 cm. But that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are: A)9, B)7.5, C)4.5, D)12, E)0, F)15, G)18, H)1.5, I)3.0.

Wait, option I is 3 cm. Oh, right, but I thought I was getting 3 cm, but it's not an option. Wait, but wait, the options include 3 cm as option I. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, let me go back to the setup.

Wait, when I considered particle 3 between 1 and 2 (d between 0 and 9), the equation led to d=3. So particle 3 is at x=3 cm. But let me think again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me verify.

Alternative approach: Let me write the force equation. The net force on particle 3 is the sum of the forces from 1 and 2. We want this sum to be zero.

So F1 + F2 = 0.

F1 is the force due to 1 on 3.

F2 is the force due to 2 on 3.

Assuming all are positive charges, the force from 1 on 3 is to the right (since 3 is to the right of 1). The force from 2 on 3 is to the left (since 3 is to the left of 2). So F1 is positive (right), F2 is negative (left). So F1 + F2 = 0 → F1 = -F2.

So:

k q q3 / d² = - (k *4 q q3 ) / ( (9 - d)^2 )

Wait, but the left-hand side (F1) is positive, and the right-hand side is negative (due to the negative sign). So this would mean that the equation would require a negative force, which would mean that F1 and F2 are in opposite directions. So F1 is positive, F2 is negative, so their sum is zero.

Wait, but when I did the earlier calculation, I ended up with d=3 cm, which is option I. But according to the options, 3 cm is option I. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, the options don't include 3 cm as an option, wait no, option I is 3. So perhaps the correct answer is option I.

But wait, wait the options are labeled A to J. Oh, wait, the options are given as:

A:9 cm

B:7.5

C:4.5

D:12

E:0

F:15

G:18

H:1.5

I:3.0

J:6

So the options include option I (3.0 cm), which is 3 cm. So according to my earlier calculation, the correct x-coordinate for particle 3 is 3 cm, which is option I. But wait, wait, but I thought about the scenario where particle 3 is on the same side as particle 1, but in that case, the forces would add, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: what if particle 3 is placed on the same side as particle 2 (x>9 cm). Let me think. So then, F1 is to the right, F2 is also to the right. So the net force would be F1 + F2 = 0 → F1 = -F2, which can't happen because both are in the same direction. So that scenario isn't possible. Hence, the only possibility is when particle 3 is in the middle between 1 and 2, leading to d=3 cm.

But wait, perhaps I should have considered another factor. Because in the equation, I had k q q3 / d² = - (4k q q3 ) / ( (9-d)^2 )

Wait, but that would imply that (1/d²) = (-4)/( (9-d)^2 )

But the left-hand side is positive, and the right-hand side is negative (because of the minus sign). So that equation can't hold. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the equation.

Alternative approach: Let's consider the forces from particles 1 and 2 on particle 3. The net force must be zero.

So the equation is:

F1 + F2 = 0 → F1 = -F2

But considering the directions, F1 is to the right (positive x-direction), and F2 is to the left (negative x-direction). So F1 = - F2 → F1 = + F2's magnitude.

So,

k q q3 / d² = (4 k q q3) / ( (9 -d)^2 )

Canceling k q q3 from both sides, we get:

1/d² = 4/( (9-d)^2 )

Take square roots:

1/d = 2/(9-d)

Multiply both sides by d(9-d):

(9-d) = 2 d → 9 =3d →d=3 cm.

So particle 3 is at x=3 cm, which is option I.

But wait, when I look at the options, I see that option I is 3 cm, which would be the correct answer. But earlier, I thought that the options did not include 3 cm. However, the user has listed the options in a way that option I is 3 cm. So the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps I should have considered particle 3 being on the opposite side of particle 1 (x <0). Let me try that scenario.

If particle 3 is at x = -d, then the distance from 1 is d, and from 2 is (d +9).

So F1 is to the left (negative x), F2 is to the right (positive x). So F1 + F2 = 0 → F1 = -F2.

So,

( k q q3 ) / d² = - ( k *4q * q3 ) / ( (d +9 )² )

Again, the left side is positive, the right is negative. So how can the equation hold? It would require that (1/d²) = - (4/ (d+9)^2 )

Which implies that (d+9)^2 = -4 d², which is impossible because left is positive, right is negative. So this scenario is impossible.

So the only possible solution is when particle 3 is between 1 and 2, at x=3 cm. So, the answer is option I, which is 3.0 cm.
</think>

To determine the x-coordinate of particle 3 such that the net force on it is zero, we analyze the forces acting on it due to particles 1 and 2. The charges of particles 1 and 2 are +q and +4q, respectively. The distance between particles 1 and 2 is 9 cm.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Forces Acting on Particle 3**:
   - The force from particle 1 on particle 3 acts in the **positive x-direction** (to the right).
   - The force from particle 2 on particle 3 acts in the **negative x-direction** (to the left).

2. **Equilibrium Condition**:
   To have a net force of zero, the magnitudes of the forces from particles 1 and 2 must be equal and opposite. Thus:
   \[
   \frac{k \, q \, q_3}{d^2} = \frac{k \, 4q \, q_3}{(9 - d)^2}
   \]
   Here, \(d\) is the distance from particle 1 to particle 3, and \(9 - d\) is the distance from particle 2 to particle 3.

3. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   Canceling \(k \, q \, q_3\) from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{4}{(9 - d)^2}
   \]
   Taking square roots:
   \[
   \frac{1}{d} = \frac{2}{9 - d}
   \]
   Cross-multiplying:
   \[
   9 - d = 2d
   \]
   Solving for \(d\):
   \[
   d = 3 \, \text{cm}
   \]

4. **Verification**:
   - If particle 3 is placed at \(x = 3 \, \text{cm}\), the force from particle 1 on particle 3 is to the right, and the force from particle 2 on particle 3 is to the right as well. These forces are in the same direction, so they cannot cancel each other out. This suggests that the equilibrium condition is not satisfied in this scenario.
   - Revisiting the equilibrium condition, it becomes clear that the forces must act in opposite directions. Therefore, particle 3 must be placed between particles 1 and 2 (i.e., \(0 < d < 9 \, \text{cm}\)) for the forces to cancel each other out.

5. **Correct Scenario**:
   - When particle 3 is placed between particles 1 and 2 (i.e., \(0 < d < 9 \, \text{cm}\)), the force from particle 1 on particle 3 is to the right, and the force from particle 2 on particle 3 is to the left. These forces are in opposite directions, allowing the net force to be zero.
   - Solving the equilibrium condition again confirms that \(d = 3 \, \text{cm}\) satisfies the condition. This places particle 3 at \(x = 3 \, \text{cm}\), which is consistent with the options provided.

### Conclusion:
The correct x-coordinate of particle 3 is **3.0 cm**, which corresponds to **option I**.

ANSWER: I
