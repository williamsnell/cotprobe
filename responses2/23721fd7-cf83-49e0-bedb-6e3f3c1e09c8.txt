Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about calculating the cost of lumber at a certain price. The given price is $140 per 1,000 board feet. I need to find the charge for 300 pieces of lumber. Each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long. The options are A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I think I need to find the total board feet of lumber and then determine the cost based on the rate.

Wait, right. Board feet are a measure of volume, so I should calculate the volume of each piece and then multiply by the number of pieces. Let me jot down the details.

Each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long. I need to convert all measurements to the same unit to calculate the volume. The price is per 1,000 board feet, so using inches might complicate things, but maybe I can convert everything to feet.

Wait, 1 inch is 1/12 of a foot. So 2 inches is 2/12 = 1/6 feet, and 6 inches is 6/12 = 1/2 foot. The length is already given in feet, so 12 feet.

Now, the volume for one piece is length x width x thickness. So, (1/2 ft) * (1/6 ft) * (12 ft). Multiply these together: (1/2)*(1/6)=1/12, then 1/12 *12=1. So each piece is 1 board foot. Wait, that seems right because 1 inch x 1 inch = 1 square inch, times 12 inches is 12, but since each dimension is divided by 12, maybe it's better to think in terms of cubic feet.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the units. Each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long. Let's convert all to feet.

Thickness: 2 inches = 2/12 = 1/6 ft
Width: 6 inches = 6/12 = 1/2 ft
Length: 12 ft.

So the volume is (1/6) * (1/2) * 12. Let's calculate that. (1/6)*(1/2)=1/12. 1/12 *12=1. So each piece is 1 board foot. That's a key point.

So 300 pieces would be 300 board feet. But wait, the price is $140 per 1,000 board feet. So for 300 board feet, I need to find what portion of $140 that represents.

So the cost is (300 / 1000) * 140. Let me compute that: 300/1000 is 0.3, so 0.3 *140 = 42. So $42? But wait, that doesn't match any of the options given. The options are much higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, I think I messed up the unit conversion. Let me go back. Maybe I shouldn't have converted the inches to feet. Let me try another approach.

The volume for one piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, 12 feet long. Wait, but 12 feet is 144 inches. Let me think in inches.

So, the dimensions in inches are:
- Thickness: 2"
- Width: 6"
- Length: 12 feet = 144 inches (because 12 *12=144 inches)
Wait, no, 12 feet is 12 *12=144 inches? Wait, no, wait. 1 foot is 12 inches, so 12 feet is 12 *12 = 144 inches? No, wait, no. 12 feet is 12 * 12 inches? No, 12 feet is 12 * 12 inches? No, wait, 12 feet is 12 *12 inches? No, wait, 12 feet is 12 * 12 inches? No, 12 feet is 12 feet, which is 12 *12 inches? No, 1 foot is 12 inches, so 12 feet is 12 *12 inches? No, no: 1 foot is 12 inches, so 12 feet is 12 *12 inches? No, no, wait, 12 feet is 12 *12 inches. No, that's 144 inches. Oh, okay.

So for each piece, the volume is 2 inches *6 inches *12 feet (converted to inches). Wait, that could be a problem because the units are inconsistent. So perhaps I should convert everything to inches or to feet.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the volume in cubic feet, since the price is per board foot.

Let me try that approach. So, each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, 12 feet long.

Convert inches to feet: 2 inches = 2/12 = 1/6 ft, 6 inches = 6/12 = 1/2 ft.

So the dimensions are (1/6 ft) x (1/2 ft) x (12 ft).

Volume of one piece is (1/6) * (1/2) *12 = (1/12) *12 = 1 cubic foot. So each piece is 1 board foot, same as before.

So 300 pieces would be 300 board feet. Then, the cost is (300 / 1000) *140 = 42, which doesn't match any option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the options start at $336, $504, etc. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I converted the inches wrong. Let me check the units again. Wait, perhaps the problem asks for board feet, but maybe the volume is cubic feet, not in inches.

Wait, no, because 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, 12 feet long. So perhaps I should calculate the volume in cubic feet correctly.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me try this again.

Each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long.

So in feet:

2 inches = 2/12 = 1/6 ft.

6 inches = 6/12 = 1/2 ft.

Length is 12 feet.

Volume is (1/6) * (1/2) *12 = (1/12)*12=1 cubic foot per piece. So 300 pieces would be 300 board feet.

So 300 /1000 *140 = 42. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake in the problem interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the cost is per board foot, but my calculation is wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate the volume correctly in cubic feet. Let's try.

Each piece: 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, 12 feet long.

Convert inches to feet:

2 in = 2/12 = 1/6 ft.

6 in = 6/12 = 1/2 ft.

Length is 12 ft.

So volume is (1/6) * (1/2) *12.

Let me compute that:

(1/6) * (1/2) = 1/12. Then 1/12 *12=1. So each piece is 1 board foot. 300 pieces: 300 board feet.

So 300 / 1000 = 0.3. 0.3 * 140 = 42. But that's way below the options. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the price is per cubic foot, but that doesn't make sense because the question says per 1000 board feet. So 140 per 1000 board feet.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the dimensions. Wait, maybe 12 feet is the length but the other dimensions are in inches. So perhaps I should calculate in inches and then convert to board feet.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the volume in cubic inches, then convert to board feet.

Let me try this alternative approach.

Each piece is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, 12 feet long.

12 feet is 144 inches.

So, the volume is 2 *6 *144 = 2*6=12 *144= 1728 cubic inches.

Now, since 1 board foot is 12 inches (length) x 12 inches (width) x 1 inch (thickness). So 1 board foot is 12*12*1=144 cubic inches.

So, 1728 cubic inches /144 cubic inches per board foot = 12 board feet per piece.

So each piece is 12 board feet. Multiply by 300 pieces: 300 *12 = 3600 board feet.

Now, the cost is 3600 /1000 *140 = 3.6 *140 = 504.

Wait, 3600 /1000 is 3.6, multiplied by 140 gives 504. Which is option C.

Ah, so I must have made a mistake earlier by not correctly calculating the volume in cubic inches and then converting to board feet. I think that's the correct approach now.
</think>

To determine the cost of 300 pieces of lumber, each with dimensions 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long, we calculate the volume in cubic inches and then convert to board feet.

1. **Convert dimensions to inches:**
   - Thickness: 2 in
   - Width: 6 in
   - Length: 12 ft = 144 in

2. **Calculate volume in cubic inches:**
   \( 2 \, \text{in} \times 6 \, \text{in} \times 144 \, \text{in} = 1728 \, \text{in}^3 \)

3. **Convert to board feet:**
   - 1 board foot = \( 12 \, \text{in} \times 12 \, \text{in} \times 1 \, \text{in} = 144 \, \text{in}^3 \)
   - Volume in board feet: \( 1728 \, \text{in}^3 / 144 \, \text{in}^3/\text{board foot} = 12 \, \text{board feet per piece} \)

4. **Total board feet for 300 pieces:**
   \( 300 \, \text{pieces} \times 12 \, \text{board feet/piece} = 3600 \, \text{board feet} \)

5. **Calculate cost:**
   - Cost per 1000 board feet: $140
   - Cost for 3600 board feet: \( (3600 / 1000) \times 140 = 3.6 \times 140 = \$504 \)

**Answer: C: $504**
