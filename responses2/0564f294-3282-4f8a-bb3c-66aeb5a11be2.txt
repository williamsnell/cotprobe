Okay, so I've got this question about the Moon's rotation and how it relates to Earth's days. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that the Moon always shows the same face to Earth. I remember that this is called a synchronous rotation. Oh wait, right, when an object spins once for every rotation around its own axis, it's synchronous. So for the Moon, that means it rotates once every time it completes an orbit around Earth.

But wait, Earth's rotation is a day, right? So if the Moon's rotation matches Earth's orbital period, that would mean it takes the same time to spin once as it takes to orbit Earth. So if Earth takes about 365 days to orbit, the Moon would spin once every year. That's a year.

Looking at the options, let me see what each one says. Option F is "year." So if the Moon's rotation matches Earth's orbital period, that's once per year. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says, "the fact that the Moon always shows its same face to Earth is evidence that the Moon rotates about its axis about once per..." So the period is the same as Earth's orbit, which is a year. So yes, the correct option is F: year.

The correct answer is F: year. The Moon's synchronous rotation means it spins once for every orbit around Earth, which takes a year. 

Answer: F
