Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about terminal velocity of a parachutist. Hmm, okay, I need to calculate his terminal velocity based on the given data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me the parachutist's weight, which is 175 lb. Wait, that's weight, right? So I probably need to convert that to mass to use in the equation for terminal velocity. Oh right, mass is weight divided by gravity. So I should look up the standard gravity value. I think standard gravity is around 32.174 ft/s², but maybe the problem expects a simpler value, like 32 ft/s². I'll go with 32 ft/s² for now.

Next, the projected frontal area is 2 ft². The drag coefficient is 0.80 based on that. I remember the formula for terminal velocity is when the forces are balanced, so the drag force equals the weight. The drag force is calculated by (1/2) * rho * A * Cd * v². The weight is mass times gravity, which is m * g.

So, putting it together, when terminal velocity is reached, we have:

m * g = (1/2) * rho * A * Cd * v²

I need to solve for v. Rearranging the equation, v² = (2 * m * g) / (rho * A * Cd)

Wait, but I don't have rho yet. rho is the air density at the given temperature. The problem gives the air temperature as 70°F. I need to find the air density at 70°F. Let me look at the table provided.

Looking at the table, for temperature 70°F, the density (rho) is given as 2.33 slugs/ft³. Wait, slugs per cubic foot. Oh, right, because 1 slug is a unit of mass equal to 32.174 lbm. So, the units should match. I'll keep that in mind.

So, let me note down the known variables:

m (mass) = weight / g = 175 lbm / 32.174 ft/s² ≈ 5.436 lbm

A (frontal area) = 2 ft²

Cd = 0.80

g = 32.174 ft/s² (I'll use 32 for simplicity; 0.80 * 175 * 32 = 4480, but perhaps 32 is more straightforward.)

Wait, but wait, let's compute it more accurately. 175 lbm * 32.174 ft/s² is about 175*32.174 = let's see, 175 *30 is 5250, 175*2.174 is about 380. So total is 5630 lb·ft/s². So mass is 5630 /32.174 ≈ let me calculate that: 5630 ÷32.174 ≈ 175. So I think I might have confused the units earlier, but maybe I should proceed.

Wait, another approach: since the problem provides rho for each temp, perhaps I should use that. The density is 2.33 slugs/ft³ at 70°F. So the density is 2.33 slugs/ft³.

Wait, no, let me calculate the mass again. The parachutist's weight is 175 lbm. So mass m = 175 lbm.

So back to the formula for terminal velocity:

v_t = sqrt( (2 * m * g) / (rho * A * Cd) )

Plugging in the numbers:

m = 175 lbm

g = 32.174 ft/s²

rho = 2.33 slugs/ft³

A = 2 ft²

Cd = 0.80

So compute numerator: 2 * 175 * 32.174.

Let me compute that:

2 * 175 = 350.

350 *32.174 = 350 *30 = 10500, 350*2.174=760.9; total 10500 +760.9= 11260.9.

Denominator: rho * A * Cd = 2.33 * 2 * 0.8 = 2.33 *1.6 = Let me compute 2 *1.6 is 3.2, plus 0.33*1.6=0.528. So 3.2 +0.528=3.728.

So denominator is 3.728 [slug·ft²/s²] ?

Wait, unit-wise, slugs are lbm/s², so slugs * ft²/s² would be lbm ft²/s²? I'm a bit confused about units, but maybe I can proceed numerically.

So v_t^2 = 11260.9 / 3.728 ≈ Let's compute that.

Dividing 11260.9 by 3.728: 3.728 * 3000=11184, which is close to 11260.9. So 3000 *3.728=11184. So 11260.9 -11184=76.9. So 76.9 ÷3.728≈20.57.

So v_t² ≈ 3000 +20.57 ≈3020.57.

So v_t ≈sqrt(3020.57) ≈ 55 ft/s.

Wait, that's about 55 feet per second. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 3.728 * 3000 is 11,184, correct. 11,260.9 -11,184=76.9. 76.9 /3.728= approx 20.57. So 3020.57. Square root of 3020 is about 55 (55²=3025, so yes, approx 55 ft/s.

But wait, the options don't have 55. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for the denominator.

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator: 2.33 * 2 * 0.8 = 2.33 *1.6.

2.33 *1.6: 2 *1.6=3.2; 0.33 *1.6=0.528. So 3.2 +0.528=3.728. That's correct.

Numerator: 2 *175 *32.174. 175 *2=350; 350 *32.174. Let me compute that accurately.

32.174 *350: 350 *30=10,500; 350 *2.174= 350 *2=700, 350 *0.174=60.9. So 700+60.9=760.9. So 10,500 +760.9=11,260.9.

So 11,260.9 /3.728. Let me compute this division more accurately.

3.728 *3000 = 11,184.

Subtracting from 11,260.9: 11,260.9 -11,184 = 76.9.

Now, 76.9 /3.728 = ?

Calculating 3.728 ×20 =74.56. Remaining:76.9-74.56=2.34.

So, 20.23 approximately (since 3.728 ×20.23=74.56 + (0.23 *3.728)≈0.857, so total≈75.417, which is close to 76.9. So that's 20.23.

So total v_t²=3000 +20.23=3020.23.

Thus, v_t= sqrt(3020.23) ≈55 ft/s.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B:220, D:250, etc. None of them is 55. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value for g. Let me check, 32.174 ft/s² is accurate, but perhaps using 32 ft/s² would make a difference.

Let me try using g=32 ft/s².

So numerator:2 *175 *32= 2*175=350, 350 *32=11200.

Denominator: rho*A*Cd=2.33 *2 *0.8= same as before, 3.728.

v_t^2=11200 /3.728= compute that.

3.728 *3000=11184. So 11200-11184=16.

16 /3.728= approx 4.286. So v_t²=3000 +4.286=3004.286.

sqrt(3004.286)= approximately 54.8, about 55 ft/s again. So same result.

Hmm, but the options start at 200. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the density in slugs per cubic foot. Oh wait, I used 2.33 slugs/ft³, which is correct. So perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Wait, another thing: when you're calculating for terminal velocity, the formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 * rho * Cd * m ) / (rho * A * Cd) )? No, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me recall the correct formula.

The correct formula for terminal velocity is when the drag force equals the weight. So:

m * g = (1/2) * rho * A * Cd * v_t²

So solving for v_t:

v_t = sqrt( (2 m g) / (rho A Cd) )

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused mass and weight. Oh, no, the weight is (m * g), so that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't include 55. So perhaps I made an error in using rho or in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the average density, but in this case, the air density is given at 70°F. So the density is correct as 2.33 slugs/ft³.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the dynamic pressure in the drag equation, which is (1/2) rho v² A. So, perhaps the correct formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 m g) / (rho A Cd) ), yes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: rho=2.33 slugs/ft³, A=2 ft², Cd=0.8.

So 2.33 * 2 *0.8 = 2.33 *1.6 = 3.728.

Numerator: 2 *175 *32 = 2 *175=350, 350 *32=11200.

So v²= 11200 / 3.728. Let's compute 11200 ÷3.728.

Hmm, 3.728 × 3000 =11184.

So 11200 -11184=16.

16 ÷3.728 ≈4.286.

So 3000 +4.286≈3004.286.

So v= sqrt(3004.286)≈54.8 ft/s, approximately 55 ft/s.

But the options don't have 55. The closest is 220, 250, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. What if I used the wrong formula, like v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m) / (A) )? No, that would be incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given rho is in slugs per cubic foot, but I should convert it to pounds per cubic foot? No, wait, the formula uses slugs. Because 1 slug = 32.174 lbm. So, 2.33 slugs/ft³ is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert the units of density. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the formula for v_t is correct in terms of units, but perhaps I should have used pounds per square foot for pressure. Wait, no, the formula is in terms of rho in slugs per cubic foot, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the formula correctly but perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but let's see if I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct g. Let me check g again. 32.174 ft/s² is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses rho in pounds per cubic foot instead of slugs. Wait, slugs are 32.174 lbm per lb·s². Hmm, no, I think I did the correct conversion.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given rho is in pounds per square foot, but that's pressure. No, in the drag equation, rho is in mass per volume.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with rho in lbm/ft³ instead of slugs. Let me see.

Wait, if I convert rho from slugs/ft³ to lbm/ft³. Since 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, then 2.33 slugs/ft³ = 2.33 *32.174 lbm/ft³ ≈ 2.33 *32 ≈ 74.56 lbm/ft³.

But that's not correct because to convert slugs to lbm, you multiply by 32.174. So, 2.33 slugs/ft³ = 2.33 * 32.174 lbm/ft³ ≈ 74.56 lbm/ft³.

Wait, but I don't know if that's correct. Let me think. Oh wait, no, because rho in the drag equation is in lbm/ft³. So if the given rho is in slugs/ft³, I should convert it to lbm/ft³.

So, rho = 2.33 slugs/ft³. Since 1 slug = 32.174 lbm,

rho (lbm/ft³) = 2.33 * 32.174 ≈74.6 lbm/ft³.

Wait, but that's a huge difference. So if I had used rho as 74.6 lbm/ft³, and the previous calculation, let me see.

But wait, if I do that, then the denominator becomes rho * A * Cd =74.6 * 2 *0.8= 74.6 *1.6≈119.36.

Numerator is 2 * m * g =2 *175 *32.174= same 11200 (since 175 *32.174=11260.9, times 2 is 22521.8).

Wait, wait, no, 2 *175 is 350. 350 *32.174=11260.9. So numerator is 11260.9.

Denominator with rho =74.6: 74.6 *2 *0.8=74.6 *1.6=119.36.

So v² =11260.9 /119.36 ≈ 94.73.

So v ≈ sqrt(94.73)≈9.73 ft/s. That's way too low.

So that can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in units. Therefore, I should stick with rho in slugs/ft³, which is 2.33 slugs/ft³.

But then, how come the answer isn't one of the options.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive.

The force due to gravity is m g, which must be balanced by the drag force (which is (1/2) rho v² A Cd).

So:

m g = (1/2) rho v² A Cd

=> v² = (2 m g) / (rho A Cd)

=> v = sqrt( (2 m g) / (rho A Cd) )

I think that's correct.

Wait, but then, let me compute the denominator again. If I used rho=2.33 slugs/ft³ and Cd=0.8, and A=2 ft², then:

Denominator: (2.33 slugs/ft³) * (2 ft²) * (0.8) = 2.33 * 2 * 0.8 = 3.728.

Yes, correct.

So, numerator is 2 * 175 lbm *32.174 ft/s².

Compute that: 175 *32.174=5630.5. Multiply by 2: 11261. So numerator is 11261.

Denominator is 3.728.

So v²=11261 /3.728≈3000.

v= sqrt(3000)= approx 54.77 ft/s.

Hmm, but the options start at 200. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use g=32 ft/s², not 32.174. Let me recalculate with g=32.

So numerator: 2 *175 lbm *32 ft/s² =2 *175=350. 350 *32=11200.

Denominator: rho=2.33 slugs/ft³, A=2, Cd=0.8.

So 2.33 *2 *0.8=3.728.

v²=11200 /3.728= 3000 (approx).

v= sqrt(3000)= approx54.77 ft/s.

Same result.

But options don't have 54.77. So perhaps the problem is wrong, or I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the dynamic pressure in the drag equation. Wait, the correct formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m) / (A) ) / sqrt(g) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think again. The correct formula for terminal velocity is:

v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m) / (A) ) * sqrt(g) )

Wait, no, that's not correct because it's dimensionally inconsistent. Let me think in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps I should make rho in lbm/ft³, which would be 2.33 *32.174 ≈74.6 lbm/ft³.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, but that led to a much lower velocity.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the slugs correctly.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong rho. Let me check the rho given, which is 2.33 slugs per cubic foot.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I should use the air density at 70°F, which is 2.33 slugs/ft³. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the formula correctly but use the correct units.

Wait, let me compute v² again more accurately.

Numerator: 2 *175 *32.174= 350 *32.174.

350 *32=11200, 350 *0.174=60.9. So total 11260.9.

Denominator: rho=2.33, A=2, Cd=0.8. So 2.33 *2 *0.8=3.728.

v²=11260.9 /3.728. Let me compute that exactly.

3.728 ×3000=11184.

Subtract:11260.9 -11184=76.9.

76.9 ÷3.728= let me compute this division.

3.728 ×20=74.56.

76.9 -74.56=2.34.

So 2.34 ÷3.728≈0.628.

So total:3000 +20 +0.628=3020.628.

v²≈3020.628, so v= sqrt(3020.628)= approximately 54.96 ft/s.

Still about 55 ft/s.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should be v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) / sqrt(g) ). No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) multiplied by sqrt(g). Wait, no, I think that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a square root. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) / sqrt(g) ). No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used rho in lbm per cubic foot.

Wait, perhaps I should convert rho from slugs to lbm.

Earlier, I tried that and got a much higher rho, but that led to a much lower velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should use rho in lbm per cubic foot. Let me try that.

1 slug = 32.174 lbm.

So, rho =2.33 slugs/ft³=2.33 *32.174 lbm/ft³≈74.6 lbm/ft³.

Using this rho in the formula, let's compute v_t.

So,

v_t² = (2 m g) / (rho A Cd)

m=175 lbm, g=32.174 ft/s², rho=74.6 lbm/ft³, A=2 ft², Cd=0.8.

So, numerator:2 *175 *32.174= 350 *32.174=11260.9.

Denominator:74.6 *2 *0.8=74.6 *1.6=119.36.

So, v_t²=11260.9 /119.36≈94.73.

v_t =sqrt(94.73)=9.73 ft/s.

Still much lower than any of the options.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use a different formula, or I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for terminal velocity. Oh, right, the correct formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m) / (A) ) ) * sqrt(g) / sqrt(g) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m) / (A) ) * sqrt(g) )

Wait, no, that would have units inconsistent. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula without considering the g. Wait, no, I think I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of the force of gravity and the drag force.

But I'm getting stuck with the calculations, so perhaps I can try to compute the options and see which one matches.

So, let me compute for each option what the terminal velocity would be, and see if any match the given calculations.

Wait, but that's going to take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the answer for the given options.

Wait, let's take option B:220 ft/s.

Compute v_t²= (2 m g) / (rho A Cd) )

m=175 lbm, g=32.174 ft/s², rho=2.33 slugs/ft³, A=2 ft², Cd=0.8.

So,

v_t²= (2 *175 *32.174) / (2.33 *2 *0.8 )

= (11260.9) / (3.728 )

≈3020.

v_t≈54.96 ft/s.

So option B's v_t is 220 ft/s, but that's much higher than my calculated 55 ft/s. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with g in ft/s², and without converting rho to lbm/ft³.

Wait, let me recompute v_t² without converting rho.

v_t² = (2 * m * g) / (rho * A * Cd )

m=175 lbm, g=32.174 ft/s², rho=2.33 slugs/ft³, A=2 ft², Cd=0.8.

So,

v_t² = (2 *175 *32.174 ) / (2.33 *2 *0.8 )

= (11260.9) / (3.728 )

≈3020.

v_t≈sqrt(3020)≈54.96 ft/s.

So option B:220 ft/s.

So the correct answer is not among the options. So perhaps the problem is wrong, or I made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula without considering the g. Wait, no, I think I'm correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. Let me think again.

The correct formula for terminal velocity is v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m) / (A) ) * sqrt(g) ) / sqrt(g) )? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) * sqrt(g) ) / sqrt(g) )? No, that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) * sqrt(g) ) / sqrt(g) )? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) * sqrt(g) ) / sqrt(g) )? No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me double-check.

The correct formula for terminal velocity is:

v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) * sqrt(g) )

No, that's not correct. Let me think in terms of the correct formula.

The correct formula is:

v_t = sqrt( (2 rho Cd m ) / (A) ) ) * sqrt(g) ) / sqrt(g) )? No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and say that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but given the options, perhaps I should assume that the correct answer is option B:220 ft/s, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use a different approach, such as considering the projected area, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the projected area is A*cos(theta), but the problem doesn't mention any angle, so I don't think that's relevant.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B:220 ft/s.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the correct answer is about 55 ft/s, which is not among the options. So perhaps, the options are wrong, or I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value for option B and see what g would be.

If v_t=220 ft/s, then v_t²=48400 ft²/s².

So,

v_t²= (2 *175 *g) / (2.33 *2 *0.8 )

48400 = (350 *g) / (3.728 )

Multiply both sides by 3.728:

350 *g =48400 *3.728

Compute 48400 *3.728:

Well, 48,400 *3 =145,200.

48,400 *0.728=?

Compute 48,400 *0.7=33,880.

48,400 *0.028=1,355.2.

So total for 0.728 is 33,880 +1,355.2=35,235.2.

Total is 145,200 +35,235.2=180,435.2.

So,

350 * g =180,435.2

g =180,435.2 /350 ≈515.52 ft/s².

But the standard gravity is about 32.174 ft/s². So this would imply an extremely high g. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, that's correct. So, my conclusion is that the correct answer is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem is wrong or I made a mistake.

Wait, but perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B:220 ft/s, given that it's the highest, but I don't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B, but I don't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

Wait, but given that I'm confident that the correct answer is 55 ft/s, which is not among the options, perhaps the problem is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to choose option B:220 ft/s, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't see it. So, perhaps I should proceed to think that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to choose option B:220 ft/s.

Wait, but that's assuming that the correct answer is 220 ft/s, which I don't think is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is 54.96 ft/s, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is wrong.

The correct terminal velocity calculation leads to approximately 55 ft/s, which is not among the provided options. Therefore, based on the given options, none of them match the correct answer. 

ANSWER: None of the options match the correct answer.
