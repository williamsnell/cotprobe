Question:

In an action for malpractice, a plaintiff sued a doctor, claiming that the latter failed to properly diagnose his emphysema condition. The plaintiff contends that he went to the doctor for a medical examination after experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath. However, the doctor found no evidence of the disease and advised him that he was probably suffering from indigestion. Thereafter, the plaintiff was examined by another doctor who discovered that the plaintiff in fact was suffering from a chronic case of emphysema. At trial, the plaintiff calls the other doctor as his first witness. The other doctor proposes to testify the x-rays of the plaintiff's lungs showed that his respiratory organs were marked by distension, which was characteristic of emphysema. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the testimony should be

Options:

A: admitted, because a doctor is properly qualified as an expert in medical matters.
B: admitted, because the other doctor followed accepted medical practice in arriving at his opinion.
C: excluded, because his opinion is based upon facts not in evidence.
D: excluded, because the x-rays are the best evidence to show the distension of the plaintiff's lungs.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer here. I remember this is about malpractice law, specifically about whether a witness's testimony can be admitted. Let me think about what I know from my studies.

The scenario is about a plaintiff suing a doctor for malpractice. The plaintiff went to the doctor because he had chest pains and shortness of breath. The first doctor didn't properly diagnose him and suggested he might have indigestion. Then the plaintiff was examined by another doctor who correctly identified him as having emphysema. The other doctor is now the first witness.

The issue is whether the x-ray testimony, which showed distension in the lungs, can be admitted. The options are about whether it's admitted or excluded.

I remember something about the rule of fact versus the rule of law in evidence. The rule of fact is about what the facts are, while the rule of law is about what the evidence shows. I'm not sure if the rule of law applies here.

Wait, the doctor's opinion is based on facts not in evidence. The other doctor saw that the plaintiff had emphysema and told him it was due to indigestion. But the x-ray showed the lungs were distension. So the first doctor's opinion is based on his own diagnosis, which wasn't supported by evidence. But the second doctor's opinion is based on the x-rays, which are evidence.

So the question is whether the second doctor's opinion is admissible. I think the rule is that the opinion must be supported by evidence. If the x-rays are the best evidence, then the opinion is supported.

Wait, but I'm confused. Do medical opinions count as evidence? I thought most evidence must be supported by facts, unless it's a hearsay. But here, the opinion is an expert opinion, not hearsay because it's about the doctor's judgment.

So the other doctor's testimony should be admitted because the x-rays are evidence that the plaintiff had emphysema. The correct rule is that the opinion is supported by evidence. So the answer would be C: excluded because opinion is based on not-evidence.

Alternatively, the first doctor's opinion is not supported by evidence, so it's not admitted. The second doctor's is supported by the x-rays, so it's allowed.

So the correct answer should be C: excluded, because the opinion is based on facts not in evidence.

The correct answer is C: excluded, because the x-rays are the best evidence to show the distension of the plaintiff's lungs. 

**Explanation:** The other doctor's testimony is based on the x-rays, which are evidence showing the plaintiff's condition. Since the doctor's opinion is supported by evidence, it is admissible. Therefore, the testimony should be admitted.

Answer: C
