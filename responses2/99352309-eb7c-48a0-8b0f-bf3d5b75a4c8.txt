Okay, so I've got this problem here about cost functions and averages. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the total cost of producing x cameras is given by C(x) = 2 + x³. They're asking for two things: the average cost when 10 cameras are made, and the marginal cost at that quantity of 10. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's start with the average cost. I remember that average cost is total cost divided by the number of units produced. So the formula for average cost should be AC(x) = C(x) / x. Since x is 10 here, let's plug that in.

So C(10) is 2 + (10)^3. 10 cubed is 1000, so 2 + 1000 is 1002. Then average cost is 1002 divided by 10, which is 100.2 dollars per unit. Wait, but none of the options have 100.2. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option F says average cost is $100/unit. That's close. So maybe that's the right answer. Alternatively, another way to calculate average cost is to see if the formula rounds or if I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, no, 1002/10 is 100.2, which is 100.20, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the question expects an approximate value. Option F is $100, which is probably the intended choice.

Now for the marginal cost. Marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function with respect to x, evaluated at x=10. So first, I find the derivative C'(x) of C(x) = 2 + x³. The derivative of x³ is 3x², so C'(x) = 3x².

Now, plugging in x=10: C'(10) = 3*(10)^2. 10 squared is 100, so 3*100 is 300. So the marginal cost at 10 units is $300.

Looking at the options, option F says average cost is $100, and marginal cost is $300. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option F.

Wait, let me double-check. For average cost: C(x) = 2 + x³ → C(10)= 1002 → 1002/10=100.2, but the options don't have that. So maybe the question expects an approximate value, so 100 is acceptable. Marginal cost is 300, which is option F's numbers.

The total cost function is given by \( C(x) = 2 + x^3 \). To find the average cost when 10 cameras are made, we calculate:

\[
AC(10) = \frac{C(10)}{10} = \frac{2 + (10)^3}{10} = \frac{1002}{10} = 100.2
\]

Since none of the options exactly match this value, the closest approximation is $100/unit.

Next, the marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function:

\[
C'(x) = 3x^2
\]

Evaluating at \( x = 10 \):

\[
C'(10) = 3(10)^2 = 300
\]

Thus, the marginal cost is $300. The correct option is:

**F: Average Cost: $100/unit, Marginal Cost: $300**

Answer: F
