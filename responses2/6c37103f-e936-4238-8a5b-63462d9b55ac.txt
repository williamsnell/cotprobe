Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about two fruit flies that are heterozygous for genes in one allele pair. They're bred together and have 200 offspring. There are two parts: (a) about how many will have the dominant phenotype, and (b) determining which are homozygous dominant and which are heterozygous.

Hmm, so first, let's break down what heterozygous means. If a gene has two alleles, and it's heterozygous, the genotype would be Aa for a dominant allele A and a recessive allele a. So when these flies are crossed, each parent is Aa.

When two parents are crossed, the offspring's genotype depends on the combination of alleles each parent contributes. For a single gene with two alleles, each parent can give either A or a, and since each parent is Aa, the possible gametes are A and a, each at 50% chance.

So the F1 generation (the first generation of offspring) from two Aa parents would have four possible combinations when considering both parents. The possible genotypes would be AA, Aa, Aa, and aa. Wait, no, that's when both parents are Aa. Let me think again: each parent can give A or a, so the possible combinations are AA (from AA), Aa (from Aa and aa), and aa (from aa). No, wait, actually, each parent contributes one allele, so the possible gametes are A and a. So the F1 generation will have 25% AA (A from each parent), 50% Aa (A and a), and 25% aa. 

So when you look at the phenotypes, the dominant (A) would be expressed, and the recessive (a) not. So, in the F1 generation, the number of dominant phenotypes would be 3/4 of the offspring, and recessive 1/4. But wait, the question says there are 200 offspring. So if it's a one-allele pair, like say a gene for fruit fly eye color, let's say A is dominant for one trait and a for another. Or maybe a flower color? But the question is about dominant phenotype, so maybe it's whether the fly is red (dominant) or white (recessive) or something like that.

So part (a): about how many would have the dominant phenotype. Well, 75% of 200 would be dominant. Because in the F1 generation, 75% would be AA (dominant), and 25% aa (recessive). So 75% of 200 is 150. So (a) is 150.

Now part (b): How do you determine if some are homozygous dominant and some are heterozygous? Because sometimes you can't tell from the phenotype alone. So the options given include various methods like self cross, complementation test, inbreeding, etc.

Wait, what's the method to distinguish between homozygous dominant (AA) and heterozygous (Aa) when you have the F2 generation? Because in the first generation, if they're both Aa, you have a 3:1 ratio in F1, but wait no—wait, maybe I'm mixing up generations. Let me think about the F2 generation. Let me step back.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The question says that the two fruit flies are heterozygous for genes of one allelic pair. So each is Aa. When they're bred together, the F1 generation (the first generation) would be a dihybrid cross, but wait, no—each parent is Aa for one gene, so F1 would be for that gene. So the F1 would be 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa. But the question is about the offspring from the original parents, which is F1, I think, but that's 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa. Or wait, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation, but the parents are F1, so their offspring would be F2.

Wait, the question says: two fruit flies (heterozygous) are bred together, so they produce F1. Then, the F1 have 200 offspring. So the cross is between two F1 individuals. Wait, no— wait, the two parents are both Aa. When they produce F1, that's the first generation. Then, F1 parents are crossed to produce F2. So the F2 generation is the 200 offspring in the question.

Ah, I see. So the initial cross is between two Aa parents. The F1 (which are the parents of the question's offspring) are Aa and Aa. Then, the F1s are crossed to produce F2. So the F2 generation would be the 200.

So in the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are AA (25%), Aa (50%), and aa (25%). But wait, wait: if the F1 is Aa, then F2 would be the result of selfing Aa individuals.

So for Aa x Aa cross, the F2 genotypes would be 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa. So the percentage of each phenotype would be 75% dominant (AA and Aa) and 25% recessive (aa).

So for part (a), about 150 would have the dominant phenotype (since 75% of 200 is 150), and 50 would be aa (recessive).

Now, the question is, how do you determine which are homozygous dominant (AA) and which are heterozygous (Aa) when you have the F2 generation.

So the options are:

A: 100, complementation test

B: 200, self cross

C: 175, self cross

D: 150, reciprocal cross

E: 50, test cross

Wait, no. The options for the answers are (a) and (b). The question asks about the answer choices, which are options A to J, each with a number and a method. So the answer for the question is (a) 150, (b) ... and the options for the answer are A to J, each with a number and a method.

So the correct answer would be (a) 150, and (b) depends on the method. The options for (b) are listed in the answer, but the given options A to J don't list the second part. So the question is, which option (a) and (b) is correct.

Wait, the question is asking the answer. So the answer is (a) 150, and (b) a way to distinguish between AA and Aa.

What's the method for distinguishing between Aa and AA in the F2 generation?

Well, one method is the test cross. If you test the F2 with an individual that is homozygous recessive, you can see the resulting ratios. For example, if you have a test cross with a recessive individual, the offspring would be 3:1 (dominant: recessive) if the parent is Aa, but wait no. Wait, if you have an F2 individual (say, AA) and you cross with a recessive (aa), the F2's would have 50% Aa and 50% aa. But for the question, perhaps the test cross is with a recessive allele.

Wait, another method is the selfing method. If the F2 individuals are selfed, the offspring would produce 50% Aa and 50% aa. So in a selfing of F2, we can see the ratio of Aa to aa.

Alternatively, the cross would be of F2 with a recessive individual. If the F2 is Aa, their offspring would be 3:1 (Aa: aa). If they're AA, their offspring would be 50% Aa and 50% AA, but wait no—selfing AA would produce only AA. Hmm, wait. Let me think.

Wait, if you self AA: all offspring are AA. So if you test AA with aa, the F2 would be AA (100%) and aa (0%). But for F2 that's not useful.

Alternatively, if you cross F2 (Aa) with a recessive (aa), the expected ratio would be 1:1 (Aa : aa). Because in F2, the Aa individuals would have 50% Aa and 50% aa. So the test cross with aa would give 50% Aa and 50% aa.

Wait, but in the question, the initial cross is between two Aa's, producing F1 (which are Aa and Aa) and then F2 from F1. So the F2 would have the 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa.

So when you perform a test cross with a recessive individual (say, aa), the F2 would produce 50% Aa (from the Aa parents) and 50% aa (from the AA and aa parents). Wait, but for the F2, each individual can be AA, Aa, or aa. So when you cross F2 (25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa) with aa, the offspring would be:

AA x aa → all Aa (since AA can only give A)
Aa x aa → 50% Aa and 50% aa.
aa x aa → all aa.

So the ratios would be:

Number of Aa offspring: (50% F2 AA * 100% Aa) + (50% F2 Aa * 100% Aa) + (25% F2 aa * 50% Aa) → but wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expected counts.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expected ratio.

In a test cross (testing F2 with aa), the expected phenotypic ratio would be:

For each F2 individual, when crossed with aa.

So for each F2 genotype:

- AA x aa: all offspring are Aa. So 100% Aa.
- Aa x aa: 50% Aa (since Aa is heterozygous and aa is recessive, so 50% Aa and 50% aa).
- aa x aa: 100% aa.

So the total offspring would be:

From AA x aa: 100% Aa
From Aa x aa: 50% Aa
From aa x aa: 100% aa

So the overall ratio of Aa to aa would be:

(Aa from AA*aa: 100% Aa) + (Aa from Aa*aa:50% Aa) → 150% Aa, and 100% aa.

Wait no, that's not correct. Because each F2 individual is crossed with aa. So let's think in terms of the number of each genotype:

For F2:

- 25% are AA → each AA x aa produces 100% Aa.
- 50% Aa → each Aa x aa produces 50% Aa and 50% aa.
- 25% aa → each aa x aa produces 100% aa.

So the number of offspring that are Aa would be:

From AA: 25% → 100% of their offspring are Aa → 25% * 200 = 50 offspring.
From Aa: 50% → each contributes 50% Aa → 50% * 200 = 100 → 50% of 100 is 50 offspring.
From aa: 25% → 100% aa → 25% *200 = 50.

So Aa: 50 +50 = 100, aa:50 → 100 Aa and 50 aa.

Wait, but that's 150 total Aa and 50 aa? No, because the total is 200.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate.

The F2 has 200 offspring.

For each F2 genotype:

AA (25%): each gives 100% Aa → 25% of 200 * 100% Aa = 50 Aa.

Aa (50%): each gives 50% Aa and 50% aa → 50% of 200 is 100. So for each Aa individual, 50% Aa, 50% aa. So 100 Aa and 100 aa.

Wait, no: 50% of 100 Aa (from Aa x aa) → 50 Aa and 50 aa.

Wait, no, let me think in terms of percentages.

Each AA (25%) produces 100% Aa. So 25% of 200 is 50. So 50 Aa.

Each Aa (50%) produces 50% Aa. So 50% of 100 is 50. So 50 Aa and 50 aa.

Each aa (25%) produces 100% aa. So 25% of 200 is 50 → 50 aa.

So total Aa: 50 (from AA) +50 (from Aa) = 100.

Total aa: 50 (from aa) → 50.

So in the test cross, the offspring would be 100 Aa and 50 aa.

So in the F2 generation, when you test (cross with aa) you'll get 100 Aa and 50 aa. So you can determine which are Aa and which are aa by looking at the proportion of Aa and aa. So if you have more Aa than aa, you know that some are Aa and some are aa.

But wait, the question is about the method to establish which are which. So the options include 'test cross' as E. So E would be correct for part (b).

Wait, but the options for the answer for (a) is 150, and for (b) are the options. The options given are options A to J, each with a number and a method. The correct answer is (a) 150 and (b) test cross.

Looking back at the options:

E: 50, test cross → No, because (a) is 150.

Wait, the options are:

A: 100, complementation test

B:200, self cross

C:175, self cross

D:150, reciprocal cross

E:50, test cross

F:125, back cross

G:150, inbreeding

H:75, pedigree analysis

I:150, test cross

J:100, back cross

So, answer (a) is 150, which is option D or I.

For (b), E says 50, which would not fit. Because in the test cross, you get 100 Aa and 50 aa. So the method would be test cross.

But wait, the options for part (b) are:

A: 100, complementation test

B:200, self cross

C:175, self cross

D:150, reciprocal cross

E:50, test cross

F:125, back cross

G:150, inbreeding

H:75, pedigree analysis

I:150, test cross

J:100, back cross

So the correct part (b) is test cross.

Looking at the options, option E is 50, test cross. That's not matching.

Wait, no. The question is, which is it? So the correct answer has (a) 150 and (b) test cross.

But looking at the options, option E is 50, test cross. So none of the options have 150 and test cross. Hmm.

Wait, the options are presented as 'the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.' So the answer is (a) 150, and (b) test cross.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is '150, test cross'. So the correct choice is option I.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 100, complementation test

B:200, self cross

C:175, self cross

D:150, reciprocal cross

E:50, test cross

F:125, back cross

G:150, inbreeding

H:75, pedigree analysis

I:150, test cross

J:100, back cross.

So the correct option for (a) is 150, and for (b) test cross, which is option I.

So the correct answer is option I: 150, test cross.
</think>

The question involves two parts: (a) determining the number of offspring with the dominant phenotype, and (b) establishing which offspring are homozygous dominant (Aa) and which are homozygous recessive (AA) in a cross of two heterozygous parents (Aa x Aa) to produce F2 offspring. 

### Part (a)
The F2 generation is derived from the selfing of F1 offspring (Aa x Aa). In this cross, the possible genotypes for F2 are:
- AA (25%): dominant phenotype.
- Aa (50%): dominant phenotype.
- aa (25%): recessive phenotype.

Since 75% of the F2 offspring exhibit the dominant phenotype, 75% of 200 offspring equals 150 offspring with the dominant phenotype. Thus, (a) is 150.

### Part (b)
To distinguish between Aa and AA in the F2 generation, a **test cross** is performed. The F2 individuals are crossed with a recessive individual (aa). The expected phenotypic ratio in this test cross is 3:1 (dominant: recessive). This allows the researcher to determine which offspring are homozygous dominant (Aa) and which are homozygous recessive (aa).

### Correct Answer
The correct answer combines (a) 150 and (b) test cross, which corresponds to **option I**.
