Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the smallest positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let me break it down step by step.

The problem states:
- When divided by 2, the remainder is 1.
- When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.
- When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.
- When divided by 5, the remainder is 4.

Hmm, so each time, the remainder is one less than the divisor. Like, 2-1=1, 3-1=2, etc. So, in each case, the number is one less than a multiple of the respective divisor. That makes me think that the number we're looking for is one less than a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5.

So, let's think about that. If I add 1 to the number, that should be a multiple of all these divisors. So, the number is 1 less than a number that is divisible by 2,3,4,5. So, the number N = x - 1, where x is a common multiple of 2,3,4,5.

What's the least common multiple (LCM) of 2,3,4,5? Let me calculate that.

Breaking them down:
- 2 is prime.
- 3 is prime.
- 4 is 2².
- 5 is prime.

The LCM is the product of the highest power of each prime present. So, that's 2² * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60. So, the LCM is 60.

Therefore, the smallest x that's a multiple of all is 60. So, N = 60 - 1 = 59.

Wait, but I should check the options. The options are A:59, B:49, C:29, D:89, E:39, F:99, G:69, H:119, I:79, J:109.

So, 59 is one of the options, which is option A. But wait, let me make sure that 59 fits all the conditions.

Checking each condition:
- 59 divided by 2: 2*29=58, remainder 1. Good.
- 59 divided by 3: 3*19=57, remainder 2. Good.
- 59 divided by 4: 4*14=56, remainder 3. Good.
- 59 divided by 5: 5*11=55, remainder 4. Perfect.

So, yes, 59 satisfies all the conditions. Since 59 is the smallest number that meets these criteria, that's the answer.

The smallest positive integer that meets all the given conditions is 59.

Answer: A:59
