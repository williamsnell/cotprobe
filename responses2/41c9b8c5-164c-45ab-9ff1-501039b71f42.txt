Okay, so I have this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: In a group of students, about 36 percent could roll their tongues, a trait determined by a dominant gene. The other 64 percent aren't tongue rollers. I need to calculate the frequencies of the gene R for tongue rolling and its recessive allele r for non-rolling. The options given are A through J, each with different R and r frequencies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when dealing with allele frequencies and dominance, it's all about understanding the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't say anything about random mating or any other evolutionary forces, so I think we can proceed under that assumption.

Let me think: The tongue-rolling trait is dominant, so the frequency of the dominant allele (R) will be higher than the recessive (r). Because in a dominant-recessive relationship, those with at least one dominant allele will show the dominant trait.

The initial numbers are 36% R and 64% r. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the 36% is the percentage of students who are tongue-rolling, and 64% are non. So the actual allele frequencies would be calculated based on how these percentages relate to the genotype frequencies.

Wait, but the dominant R allows both RR (homozygous dominant) and Rr (heterozygous) students to roll their tongue. The non-rolling are rr. So the 36% are the sum of the proportion of RR and Rr students.

So let me think about the genotypes. Let me define:

- Let p be the frequency of R, so p = frequency of R allele.
- Let q be the frequency of r, so q = frequency of r allele.

Since it's a diploid organism, each individual has two alleles. The genotype frequencies are determined by p² (RR), 2pq (Rr), and q² (rr).

But the problem states that the tongue rolling is dominant, so the percentage of people who roll (36%) includes both RR and Rr. The non-rolling (64%) are only rr.

So, from the data:

Number rolling (RR + Rr) = 36% = (p² + 2pq) * 100% 
Number not rolling = 64% = (q²) * 100%

Wait, no, because the total is 100%, so 36% is RR + Rr, and 64% is rr.

So, we can write equations based on the sum of the probabilities.

Wait, but let's think in terms of allele frequencies. Because the number rolling is (p² + 2pq), which equals 0.36. Because 36% are rolling, which includes both homozygous and heterozygous.

And the non-rolling is q² = 0.64.

Ah, wait! Because the non-rolling (rr) is just q² of the population. Because, in a diploid organism, the probability of having rr is q². So, q² equals 0.64.

So, let's compute q first.

q² = 0.64 → q = sqrt(0.64) → q = 0.8

So, q = 0.8. Then, since p + q = 1 (because allele frequencies sum to 1), p = 1 - q = 0.2.

Wait, wait. So, p is 0.2, meaning the frequency of the R allele is 0.2. And the r allele is q = 0.8.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because if q is 0.8, then the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.8, which would mean R is 0.2.

But wait, let me double-check the initial calculation. Because 36% being the rolling students is RR + Rr, which is p² + 2pq. So if p is 0.2, then p² is 0.04, and 2pq is 2 *0.2 *0.8= 0.32. Sum is 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36, which matches the given 36%. So that's correct.

So, the frequencies are p = 0.2 (R) and q = 0.8 (r). Wait, but wait, remember that in the question, the dominant trait (rolling) is determined by R. So, the R allele is the dominant one, so the recessive allele is r.

So the options are looking for frequencies of R and r. So R is 0.2, r is 0.8.

Wait, looking at the options:

Looking for R = 0.2 and r =0.8.

Let me check all options.

Option D: R=0.18, r=0.82 → sum 1, but 0.18^2 is 0.0324, 2*0.18*0.82 is about 0.296. 0.0324 + 0.296 is 0.3284, which is less than 0.36. So that's not correct.

Option J: R=0.8, r=0.2 → sum 1. 0.8^2 is 0.64, 2*0.8*0.2= 0.32. So 0.64+0.32=0.96, which is 96%. So the rolling frequency is 96%? But the question says 36%. So that's not correct.

Wait, wait. I thought q²=0.64, so q=0.8, and p=0.2. So option H says R=0.64, r=0.36. That would make q² = 0.64^2 = 0.4096, which is more than the given 0.64, so that's wrong.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

The question states that 36% are rolling. The non-rolling are 64%. But these non-rolling are those who are homozygous recessive (rr), which is q². So q² = 0.64 → q=0.8. Then p = 0.2. So the frequency of R is 0.2, r is 0.8.

So the correct option is D: R=0.18, r=0.82? No, wait, D's R is 0.18 and r is 0.82. Sum is 1, but the R frequency would be 0.18, which is lower than expected. Because p should be 0.2.

Wait, perhaps I got the question wrong. Let me read it again.

The question says that the other 64% are non-rolling. So that 64% are rr, which is q². So q=0.8. So p is 0.2.

So the R allele's frequency is 0.2. So looking for R=0.2 and r=0.8.

Looking through the options:

Option H: R=0.64, r=0.36. So R²=0.4096, which is 40.96%, not 36%. So no.

Option E: R=0.2, r=0.8. Oh wait, option E is R=0.2, r=0.8. So that's exactly what I need.

Wait, let me see. Option E says R=0.2, r=0.8. So that's p=0.2, q=0.8. That fits with q²=0.64, which is the non-rolling students. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So, the question says about 36% can roll, which includes both RR and Rr. So q²=0.64, so q=0.8, p=0.2. So the R allele is 0.2, the r is 0.8. So the correct option is E.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is R=0.2, r=0.8. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing something. Because if the frequency of R is 0.2, then the frequencies are R=0.2, r=0.8. So the answer should correspond to option E.

But let me check the other options to make sure.

Option D: R=0.18, r=0.82. Sum is 1, but R is 0.18, which is less than 0.2, which we think is correct.

Option H: R=0.64, r=0.36. Wait, q² would be 0.36, but the question says q² is 0.64. So H is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should think in terms of the number of rolling students.

Wait, the rolling students are RR and Rr. So the frequency of rolling is p² + 2pq = 0.36.

And the frequency of non-rolling is q² =0.64.

So if q² is 0.64, then q=0.8, p=0.2.

So the R allele's frequency is 0.2, r is 0.8.

So the correct option would be E: R=0.2, r=0.8.

But why is option D present? Let me check option D again: R=0.18, r=0.82 → q² = 0.82²= 0.6724, which is more than 0.64. So that's not correct.

Wait, no, I think I confused p and q. Wait, earlier, I thought q is the frequency of r, which is the recessive allele. So when q²=0.64, q=0.8, so the R allele is p=0.2. So the correct answer is E.

To solve the problem, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The students are categorized as tongue-rolling (RR or Rr) and non-rolling (rr). The given frequencies are:

- 36% of students are tongue-rolling (RR + Rr).
- 64% of students are non-rolling (rr).

Since the non-rolling students are homozygous recessive (rr), the frequency of the recessive allele (r) is calculated as follows:

\[
q^2 = 0.64 \implies q = \sqrt{0.64} = 0.8
\]

The frequency of the dominant allele (R) is:

\[
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
\]

Thus, the frequencies are:
- \( p = 0.2 \) (frequency of R),
- \( q = 0.8 \) (frequency of r).

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A**: \( p = 0.5, q = 0.5 \) → Incorrect, as \( q^2 = 0.25 \neq 0.64 \).
- **Option B**: \( p = 0.7, q = 0.3 \) → Incorrect, as \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.49 + 0.42 = 0.91 \neq 0.36 \).
- **Option C**: \( p = 0.4, q = 0.6 \) → Incorrect, as \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.16 + 0.48 = 0.64 \), but \( q^2 = 0.36 \neq 0.64 \).
- **Option D**: \( p = 0.18, q = 0.82 \) → Incorrect, as \( q^2 = 0.6724 \neq 0.64 \).
- **Option E**: \( p = 0.2, q = 0.8 \) → Correct, as \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \) and \( q^2 = 0.64 \).
- **Option F**: \( p = 0.6, q = 0.4 \) → Incorrect, as \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84 \neq 0.36 \).
- **Option G**: \( p = 0.3, q = 0.7 \) → Incorrect, as \( q^2 = 0.49 \neq 0.64 \).
- **Option H**: \( p = 0.64, q = 0.36 \) → Incorrect, as \( q^2 = 0.1296 \neq 0.64 \).
- **Option I**: \( p = 0.36, q = 0.64 \) → Incorrect, as \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.1296 + 0.4608 = 0.5904 \neq 0.36 \).
- **Option J**: \( p = 0.8, q = 0.2 \) → Incorrect, as \( q^2 = 0.04 \neq 0.64 \).

The correct answer is **Option E**, where \( p = 0.2 \) and \( q = 0.8 \).
