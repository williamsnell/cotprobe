Okay, so I've got this question about the temperature of Sirius. I remember that stars have blackbody spectra, and the peak wavelength is related to the temperature. Oh right, there's Wien's Law involved here. 

The question says that Sirius has a lambda_max of 260 nm. Wien's Law formula is lambda_max multiplied by the temperature T equals 2.898 × 10^-3 meters·kelvin. Wait, yeah, the equation is lambda_max * T = 2.898e-3 m·K. 

So to find the temperature, I need to rearrange the formula. That would be T = (2.898e-3 m·K) / lambda_max. 

But wait, lambda_max is given in nanometers. Oh, right, I have to convert that to meters. 260 nm is 260 × 10^-9 meters. 

Let me plug in the numbers. So 2.898e-3 divided by 260e-9. Let's compute that. 

Wait, let's calculate 2.898e-3 divided by 260e-9. Hmm, 2.898e-3 is 0.002898. 260e-9 is 2.6e-7. So 0.002898 / 2.6e-7 equals about 1.114e5 Kelvin. Oh wait, that's 111,400 K. 

Looking at the options, option D is 11,000 K, which is about ten times lower. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. 

Wait, 260 nm is 260e-9 meters. So 2.898e-3 divided by 260e-9 is (2.898 / 260) * 1e6. Because 1e-3 divided by 1e-9 is 1e6. 

So 2.898 / 260 is roughly 0.011146. Multiply by 1e6 gives 11,146 K. So approximately 11,000 K. That's option D. 

Wait, but I thought Sirius is hotter. Oh wait, no, I think I'm confusing Sirius with another star. Oh wait, no, I think I'm correct. Sirius is actually a bit cooler than the Sun. The Sun's peak is around 500 nm, I think. Wait, no, the Sun's peak is about 500 nm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Sun's temperature is about 5800 K. Let me think again.

Wait, no, let me get the numbers right. The Sun's max wavelength is about 500 nm. Because the Sun's peak is around 500 nm. So if Sirius's lambda_max is 260 nm, which is longer than the Sun's. That means Sirius is cooler than the Sun. So if the Sun is around 5800 K, Sirius would be cooler. So according to the calculation, 11,000 K. That makes sense. So the options say D is 11,000 K.

Looking at other options: A is 8500, which is hotter, B is 15,000 (hotter), C is 9500 (hotter) and D is 11,000. So the correct answer is D.

To estimate the surface temperature of Sirius, we use Wien's Law, which states:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \cdot T = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}
\]

Here, the peak wavelength of Sirius is given as \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = 260 \, \text{nm} \). First, convert \( 260 \, \text{nm} \) to meters:

\[
260 \, \text{nm} = 260 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 2.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Next, rearrange the formula to solve for temperature \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}}{\lambda_{\text{max}}}.
\]

Substitute \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = 2.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \):

\[
T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{2.898}{2.6} \times 10^{4} \, \text{K}.
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{2.898}{2.6} \approx 1.114.
\]

Thus:

\[
T \approx 1.114 \times 10^{4} \, \text{K} = 11,000 \, \text{K}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is **D: 11,000 K**. Sirius is indeed cooler than the Sun, which has a peak wavelength of approximately 500 nm.
