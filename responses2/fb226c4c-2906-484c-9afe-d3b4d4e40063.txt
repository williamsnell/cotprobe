Question:

The number pattern follows a skip-counting rule. 5, 20, 35, 50, 65... Which number pattern follows the same rule?

Options:

A: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...
B: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...
C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about number patterns, and I need to figure out which option follows the same skip-counting rule as the given pattern. Let me think through this step by step.

The given pattern is 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, and so on. I remember that skip-counting usually means counting by a certain number each time. So looking at the numbers, each subsequent number increases by a fixed amount. Let me check the differences between the numbers.

5 to 20: That's an increase of 15.
20 to 35: That's an increase of 15 again.
35 to 50: Another 15.
50 to 65: Again, 15.

So the pattern is adding 15 each time. That makes sense. So each term is the previous term plus 15. So the rule is "add 15."

Now, I need to look at all the options to see which one also follows the same rule.

Option A: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...
Let's find the differences here.
13 to 18: 5.
18 to 23: 5 again.
23 to 28: 5.
28 to 33: 5.
So this pattern is adding 5 each time. That's a different increment, not 15. So A isn't matching the given pattern.

Option B: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...
The differences here are:
5 to 20: 15.
20 to 25: 5.
25 to 30: 5.
30 to 35: 5.
Wait, the first difference is 15, but the rest are 5. That breaks the skip-counting rule because it's not consistent. So B is incorrect.

Option C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...
Let me calculate the differences.
12 to 27: 15.
27 to 42: 15.
42 to 57: 15.
57 to 72: 15.
Oh, this one is adding 15 each time, just like the original pattern. So C follows the same rule.

Wait a second, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check option B again. Oh wait, in B, the first step after 5 is 20, which is +15, but then it's +5 each time. So the pattern isn't consistent. So B is out.

So the correct answer should be option C, because it also skips by 15 each time.

The pattern given increments by 15 each time. Checking the options, option C increments by 15 consistently. 

Answer: C
