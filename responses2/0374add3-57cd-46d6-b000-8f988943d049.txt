Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. It says an object starts from rest and is given an acceleration of 16 feet per second squared for 3 seconds. The question is asking for its speed at the end of those 3 seconds. The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 80 down to 16.

Hmm, right. I remember that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Since the object starts from rest, its initial velocity is zero. Acceleration is the change in velocity over time. So if I use the formula for velocity when acceleration is constant, which is v = u + at. Here, u is the initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time.

Plugging in the values, u is 0 because it starts from rest. The acceleration a is 16 ft/s². The time t is 3 seconds. So, v = 0 + (16)(3). Let me compute that: 16 times 3 is 48. So the final velocity should be 48 ft/s. 

Looking at the options, option A is 48 ft per sec. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculation. 

Wait, acceleration is 16 ft/s², over 3 seconds. So 16 * 3 is definitely 48. And since the initial velocity is zero, no problem there. So yeah, it's 48 ft/s. So the answer must be option A.

The object starts from rest, so its initial velocity is 0. Using the formula \( v = u + at \), where \( u = 0 \), \( a = 16 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), and \( t = 3 \, \text{s} \), we find \( v = 0 + (16 \times 3) = 48 \, \text{ft/s} \). 

Answer: A
