Okay, so I've got this problem about mineral settling in water. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that a zincmineral slurry has ore particles and water with a volumetric ratio of 1:3. Volumetric ratio is the ratio of volumes, right? So for every 1 part ore, there's 3 parts water. But wait, I'm not sure if that affects the terminal velocity directly, but maybe it's for determining the concentration or something else. Well, maybe not for this part.

The mineral particles have a specific gravity (sp. gr.) of 3.8 and the ore particles have a sp. gr. of 2.6. The ratio of zinc to ore is 0.2. Oh, so the mineral is 0.2 times the ore's specific gravity? Or wait, the ratio could be zinc over ore. So the ratio is (zinc sp. gr.) / (ore sp. gr.) = 0.2. So that would be (3.8)/(2.6) = 1.4615. But wait, the ratio is given as 0.2, which is 0.2 times, meaning (zinc)/(ore) = 0.2. So that gives us zinc's sp. gr. as 0.2 times the ore's, so that's 0.2 * 2.6 = 0.52. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the given mineral's sp. gr. is 3.8, which is much higher. Maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (zinc sp. gr.) / (ore sp. gr.) = 0.2. So 3.8 / 2.6 = approx 1.4615. But the ratio given is 0.2, so maybe I've got it inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (ore sp. gr.) / (zinc sp. gr.) = 0.2, so ore is 0.2 times the zinc. So ore sp. gr. = 0.2 * 3.8 = 0.76. But that doesn't make sense because ore's sp. gr. is 2.6, which is higher than 0.76. So I think I might have gotten it wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased as the volumetric ratio of zinc to ore is 0.2. So the mineral is 0.2 times the ore. So the mineral's volume fraction is 0.2. Or perhaps it's the concentration. Wait, probably the ratio is (zinc mineral volume) / (ore volume) = 0.2. So the mineral particles are 20% volume of the ore in the slurry.

But I'm not sure if that affects the terminal velocity directly. Maybe it's more about the concentration of mineral in the slurry, but the question specifically asks for terminal velocity of the particles. So perhaps that part isn't directly needed for computing the terminal velocity. So maybe I can focus on the settling velocity formula.

The terminal velocity is determined by the settling velocity under gravity. I remember that the terminal velocity is given by the formula:

v = (2/9) * (ρ_water - ρ_mineral) * g * (D^2) / (μ * A) * (1 - (ρ_o / ρ_water))

Wait, but maybe I should think of the equation for settling velocity. Alternatively, the formula for terminal velocity when considering viscous settling is:

v = ( (2 * g * (ρ_water - ρ) * D^2) / (9 * μ * rho_water)) ) * (1 - (rho_o / rho_water)) )

Wait, no, that's the formula for terminal velocity when considering the settling velocity under gravity. Alternatively, another approach is to use the Stokes' equation, which for a sphere in a fluid under gravity gives:

v = (2/9) * r² * g * (ρ_water - ρ) / (mu * rho_water) * (1 - (rho_o / rho_water))

But I might have to adjust for the case where the particle is denser or not, but perhaps in this case, the mineral is less dense than water, so it's settling.

Wait, the mineral's specific gravity is 3.8, which is higher than water's (1.0), so it will sink. The ore has a lower specific gravity, 2.6, which is less dense than water.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step. Let's think about the parameters.

Given:
- Volumetric ratio of ore to water: 1:3. So the ore is 1 part, water is 3 parts. So the slurry is 1/(1+3) ore and 3/(1+3) = 0.75 water by volume.

But wait, the problem says the mineral particles are 0.007 in diameter. So the particle size is 0.007 inches. I need to find the terminal velocity of the mineral, so I probably need to calculate the density of the mineral, which is given as 3.8.

Wait, the specific gravity (sp. gr.) is the ratio of the mineral's density to water's density. So mineral density is 3.8 * 1000 kg/m³ = 3800 kg/m³.

Water's density is 1000 kg/m³.

The ore's specific gravity is 2.6, so ore density is 2600 kg/m³.

The sphere's radius is 0.007 inches. To convert that to meters, since we're likely dealing with SI units, let me calculate that. 1 inch is 0.0254 meters. So 0.007 inches is 0.007 * 0.0254 = 0.0001778 meters.

So radius r = 0.0001778 m.

The gravitational acceleration g is 9.81 m/s².

The viscosity of water is given as 8.1e-4 lb/ft-s. Wait, but in SI units, viscosity is typically measured in Pa·s. Because 1 lb/ft-s is approximately 1.4888 Pa·s. So 8.1e-4 lb/ft-s * 1.4888 Pa·s / lb/ft-s = 8.1e-4 * 1.4888 ≈ 1.22e-3 Pa·s.

Wait, let me double-check that. 1 lb/ft-s equals approximately 1.4888 Pa·s. So 8.1e-4 lb/ft-s is (8.1e-4) * 1.4888 Pa·s. So 8.1e-4 * 1.4888 ≈ 8.1 * 1.4888e-4 = 12.2e-4 = 1.22e-3 Pa·s. Yes.

So μ is 1.22e-3 Pa·s.

Now, the formula for terminal velocity under gravity is:

v = ( (2/9) * (ρ_water - ρ_mineral) * r^2 * g ) / ( μ * rho_water ) * (1 - (rho_o / rho_water) )

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the terms. I think the formula when considering the case where the particle is denser than the fluid (which it is, since mineral is 3.8), the settling velocity can be obtained using Stokes' formula.

Stokes' formula is: v = ( (2/9) * r^2 * g * (ρ_water - ρ) ) / ( μ * rho_water )

But wait, this is for very large particles, but maybe it's applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I should use the settling velocity formula for a spherical particle in a fluid.

The general formula for the terminal velocity when considering the settling velocity under gravity (assuming no drag force except for viscous) is:

v = ( (2/9) * (ρ_water - ρ) * r^2 * g ) / ( μ * rho_water ) * (1 - (rho_o / rho_water) )

Wait, or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is derived from the balance of forces. The forces acting on the particle are gravity, buoyancy, drag, and possibly the terminal velocity when the net force is zero.

The equation is: 

ρ_water * g * (4/3 π r^3) - (ρ_ore * g * (4/3 π r^3)) - (1/6) ρ_water * (4/3 π r^3) * (v^2 / μ) ) = 0

But this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, the terminal velocity can be calculated using the formula:

v = ( (2/9) * r^2 * g * (ρ_water - ρ) ) / ( μ * rho_water ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water) )

Wait, but maybe the term (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water)) is the ratio of the densities. So for the mineral, since it's denser than water, the ratio would be (ρ_water - ρ) / (ρ_water) * (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water)).

Wait, no. Let me think about the formula. The formula for settling velocity is often written as:

v = ( (2 * g * (ρ_water - ρ) * r^2 ) / (9 * μ * rho_water) ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water) )

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to look up the correct formula.

Wait, I remember that the correct formula for terminal velocity (v) in gravity settling is:

v = ( (2/9) * (ρ_water - ρ) * r^2 * g ) / ( μ * rho_water ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water) )

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing it up. Let me think again. The correct formula, I think, is:

v = ( (2 * (ρ_water - ρ) * r^2 * g ) / (9 * μ * rho_water) ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / rho_water) )

Wait, perhaps another approach: when a particle is settling in a fluid, the terminal velocity can be found by setting the net force to zero. The forces acting on the particle are:

1. Gravitational force: F_g = (4/3 π r³) * (ρ_water - ρ) * g

2. Buoyant force: F_b = (4/3 π r³) * (ρ_water - ρ_ore) * g

3. Drag force: F_d = (1/2) * C_d * ρ_water * A * v^2 

But when the particle is in terminal velocity, F_g - F_b - F_d = 0.

So:

(4/3 π r³ (ρ_water - ρ) g) - (4/3 π r³ (ρ_water - ρ_ore) g) ) - (1/2) C_d ρ_water (π r²) v² = 0.

Simplify:

(4/3 π r³ g) [ (ρ_water - ρ) - (ρ_water - ρ_ore) ] - (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v² = 0

Simplify the terms inside the brackets:

(ρ_water - ρ) - (ρ_water - ρ_ore) = -ρ + ρ_ore = (ρ_ore - ρ_water)

So:

(4/3 π r^3 g) (ρ_ore - ρ_water) ) - (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v² = 0.

Rearranging:

(4/3 π r^3 g) (ρ_ore - ρ_water) ) = (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v².

Divide both sides by π r²:

(4/(3) r g (ρ_ore - ρ_water) ) = (1/2) C_d ρ_water v².

Multiply both sides by 2:

(8/(3) r g (ρ_ore - ρ_water) ) = C_d ρ_water v².

But I'm not sure about the value of C_d. For a sphere in Stokes flow, C_d is 24/Re, but wait no, that's for Re << 1. Alternatively, for a sphere in a fluid, the drag on a sphere is given by Stokes' law when Re << 1, which is F_d = 6 π μ r v. So perhaps in this case, we can assume that the flow is such that Re is small, so C_d = 24? Or perhaps it's 36 for some other case. Wait, no, for Stokes' law (Re << 1), the drag coefficient is 6 π μ r v / (ρ_water π r²) ) = 6 μ v/(ρ_water r). So then, I think for Re << 1, C_d = 6 π μ r / (0.5 ρ_water π r²) ) * v = (6 μ v)/(0.5 ρ_water r) ) → C_d = (12 μ v)/(ρ_water r).

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again.

Wait, according to Stokes' formula, the drag force is F_d = 6 π μ r v. So, for a sphere moving at velocity v, the drag force is F_d = η * (speed) * 6 π r.

So, F_d = 6 π η r v.

But in our case, the equation is F_d = (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v².

So equating the two:

6 π η r v = 0.5 C_d ρ_water π r² v².

Simplify:

6 η r v = 0.5 C_d ρ_water r² v².

Divide both sides by v:

6 η r = 0.5 C_d ρ_water r² v.

Multiply both sides by 2:

12 η r = C_d ρ_water r² v.

Divide both sides by r²:

12 η/(r) = C_d ρ_water v.

So,

v = (12 η)/(C_d ρ_water r )

But I think this is for the case where Re << 1, which would be true for small particles. Alternatively, if Re is not that small, the formula might not hold. But in this problem, perhaps we can treat the sphere as a Stokes' sphere, so Re << 1, and thus C_d = 6 π μ / (ρ_water π r ) = (6 μ)/(ρ_water r).

Wait, let's compute C_d using Stokes' formula.

Stokes' formula says F_d = 6 π μ r v.

But the formula for drag force is also F_d = (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v².

So:

6 π μ r v = (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v².

Simplify:

6 μ r = (1/2) C_d ρ_water r^2 v.

Multiply both sides by 2:

12 μ r = C_d ρ_water r² v.

Divide both sides by ρ_water r²:

12 μ r / (ρ_water r²) ) = C_d v → (12 μ)/(ρ_water r ) = C_d v.

So, v = (12 μ)/(C_d ρ_water r).

But for Stokes' law (Re << 1), C_d = 6 π μ / (ρ_water π r ) → C_d = (6 μ)/(ρ_water r).

Wait, let me substitute that in:

v = (12 μ ) / ( (6 μ )/(ρ_water r) * ρ_water r ) )

Simplify denominator:

(6 μ / (ρ_water r )) * ρ_water r = 6 μ.

So, v = 12 μ / (6 μ ) ) = 2.

Wait, that can't be right. I'm getting v=2, which would be in m/s, but that doesn't make sense with the given data. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me try again.

From Stokes' law for F_d = 6 π μ r v.

Set equal to F_d from F = (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v².

So,

6 π μ r v = (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v².

Cancel terms:

6 π μ r v = (1/2) C_d ρ_water π r² v².

Divide both sides by π r v:

6 μ = (1/2) C_d ρ_water r v.

Multiply both sides by 2:

12 μ = C_d ρ_water r v.

So,

v = 12 μ / (C_d ρ_water r )

Now, for a sphere moving at velocity v in a fluid, the viscosity is given, but since we're using Stokes' law, we can assume Re << 1, so C_d = 6 π μ/(ρ_water π r) ) → C_d = (6 μ)/(ρ_water r).

Substituting back into v:

v = 12 μ / ( (6 μ )/(ρ_water r) * ρ_water r )

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

(6 μ)/(ρ_water r) ) * ρ_water r = 6 μ.

So,

v = 12 μ / (6 μ ) ) = 2 m/s.

Wait, but that can't be right because the given mineral's specific gravity is 3.8, which is more dense than water. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should instead consider the ratio (ρ_water - ρ) / (ρ_water) = (1 - (ρ/ρ_water)) = (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water)).

Wait, another approach: the formula for the terminal velocity without considering the flow is v = ( (2/9) (ρ_water - ρ) r^2 g ) / ( μ rho_water ) ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water) )

Wait, that might be the formula. Let me try that.

So,

v = (2/9) * ( (ρ_water - ρ) / ρ_water ) ) * r^2 * g / μ * (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water) )

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula.

Alternatively, I can look for the standard formula for settling velocity under gravity (without considering the flow regime). I think the correct formula is:

v = ( (2/9) ) * ( (ρ_water - ρ) ) * r^2 * g / ( μ * rho_water ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / ρ_water) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

v = ( (2/9) ) * ( (ρ_water - ρ) ) * r^2 * g / ( μ ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / rho_water) )

Wait, but the units would have to be correct. Let me check the units.

rho_water is in kg/m^3. r in meters. g in m/s². mu in Pa·s. Wait, 1 Pa·s = 1 kg/(m·s). So perhaps in the formula, the units will all work out.

But perhaps the correct formula is:

v = ( (2/9) ( (ρ_water - ρ) / rho_water ) ) r^2 g / mu ) * (1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) )

Wait, but perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, after some research, the correct formula for terminal velocity under gravity is:

v = ( (2/9) ) * ( (ρ_water - ρ) ) * r² * g / ( μ * rho_water ) * (1 - (ρ_ore / rho_water) )

Wait, but I'm not confident about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

v = ( (2/9) (ρ_water - ρ) r^2 g ) / ( μ rho_water ) (1 - (ρ_ore / rho_water) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from the textbook.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

v = ( (2/9) (ρ_water - ρ) ) * r^2 * g / ( μ * rho_water ) ) * ( 1 - (ρ_ore / rho_water) )

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the density of the mineral. The mineral's specific gravity is 3.8, so its density is 3.8 * 1000 kg/m³=3800 kg/m³.

So, rho_water is 1000 kg/m³, rho_mineral is 3800 kg/m³. So rho_water - rho_mineral is -2200 kg/m³. But in the formula, we take the absolute value? Or perhaps the sign is not important, because we are looking for the magnitude of velocity.

Wait, no. Because the formula for settling velocity is derived from the balance of forces, including the fact that the velocity is positive. So perhaps the formula is:

v = ( (2/9) (rho_water - rho) r^2 g ) / ( mu rho_water ) ) * (1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) )

So, plugging in the numbers.

rho_water = 1000 kg/m³.

rho_ore is 2600 kg/m³.

So, (rho_water - rho_ore) = -1600 kg/m³.

But the formula may take the absolute value, or just the magnitude. But in this case, the minor is less dense, so the formula's (rho_water - rho_ore) is negative, but in the formula, let's see.

In the formula, it's (rho_water - rho), so that would be -2200 kg/m³. So that would be negative. But velocity can't be negative. So perhaps I should take the absolute value, or perhaps the formula is designed to work with the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should think the formula as:

v = ( (2/9) (rho_water - rho) r^2 g ) / ( mu rho_water ) ) * (1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) )

So, let's compute each part.

First, (rho_water - rho_ore) = 1000 - 2600 = -1600 kg/m³.

But the formula uses (rho_water - rho), which is negative. So the velocity would be negative, which doesn't make sense because velocity is a vector. So perhaps the formula is correct, and the negative sign indicates that the mineral is denser than water, which it is, so the velocity is in the positive direction, which is downward. So, perhaps the formula is correct.

But perhaps I should compute the absolute value. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation and see if the answer makes sense.

So, rho_water - rho_ore = -1600 kg/m³.

Wait, but in the formula, it's (rho_water - rho), which is negative, but the formula gives a negative velocity, which would be downward, but we're looking for upward. So perhaps the formula should take the absolute value or perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

v = ( (2/9) (rho_water - rho) r^2 g ) / ( mu rho_water ) ) * (1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) )

But since (rho_water - rho_ore) is negative, and (rho_water - rho) is negative, then (rho_water - rho_ore) is - (rho_water - rho), so (rho_water - rho) = - (rho_water - rho_ore).

So, let me substitute that into the formula.

So,

v = ( (2/9) ( - (rho_water - rho_ore) ) r^2 g ) / ( mu rho_water ) ) * (1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) )

Which simplifies to:

v = ( (2/9) ( - (rho_water - rho_ore) ) r^2 g ) / ( mu rho_water ) ) * (1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) )

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

rho_water = 1000 kg/m³.

rho_ore = 2600 kg/m³.

So, rho_water - rho_ore = -1600 kg/m³.

rho_water - rho = rho_water - 3.8 * 1000 = 1000 - 3800 = -2800 kg/m³.

Wait, wait no. The mineral's density is 3.8 * 1000 = 3800 kg/m³. So, rho_water - rho = 1000 - 3800 = -2800 kg/m³.

So, (rho_water - rho) = -2800 kg/m³.

But in the formula, it's (rho_water - rho) which is negative.

So, v = ( (2/9) ( -2800 ) r^2 g ) / ( mu * 1000 ) ) * (1 - (2600 / 1000) )

Wait, but 1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) is 1 - (2600/1000) = 1 - 2.6 = -1.6.

So,

v = ( (2/9) * (-2800) * r^2 * g ) / ( mu * 1000 ) ) * (-1.6 )

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but let's compute each part.

But perhaps I'm making a mistake with the formula. Let me think again.

The correct formula for the terminal velocity is:

v = ( (2 g (rho_water - rho)) r^2 ) / (9 mu rho_water ) ) * (1 - (rho_ore / rho_water) )

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers.

Compute each component:

g = 9.81 m/s².

r² = (0.0075 m)^2 = 0.00005625 m².

rho_water = 1000 kg/m³.

rho_ore = 2600 kg/m³.

mu = 8.1 x 10^-4 Pa·s.

Wait, but let me double-check the viscosity of water at 20°C. The viscosity of water (at 20°C) is approximately 1.004 x 10^-3 Pa·s.

Wait, I think I may be getting the viscosity wrong. Let me look up the viscosity of water.

At 20°C, the viscosity of water is approximately 1.004 x 10^-3 Pa·s.

But perhaps I should use a more accurate value, but for the sake of time, let's proceed with that.

So, mu = 1.004e-3 Pa·s.

Now, compute each part:

(2 * g * (rho_water - rho) * r^2 ) / (9 * mu * rho_water )

Then multiply by (1 - rho_ore / rho_water )

So let's compute step by step.

First, compute (2 * g * (rho_water - rho) * r^2 ):

rho_water - rho = 1000 - 3800 = -2800 kg/m³.

r^2 = (0.0075 m)^2 = 0.00005625 m².

So,

2 * 9.81 m/s² * (-2800 kg/m³) * 0.00005625 m²

Let me compute this step by step.

2 * 9.81 = 19.62.

19.62 * (-2800) = -54, 19.62 * 2800 = 54, 19.62 * 2800 = 54, 19.62 * 2800 = 54, 19.62 * 2800 = 54, 19.62 * 2800 = 54.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute 19.62 * 2800:

19.62 * 2800 = 19.62 * 28 * 100 = (553.56) * 100 = 55,356.

So, 19.62 * (-2800) = -54,136.8.

So now, multiply by r²: 0.00005625.

So,

-54,136.8 * 0.00005625 = ?

Let's compute that:

0.00005625 = 5.625e-5.

So,

-54,136.8 * 5.625e-5 = ?

Compute 54,136.8 * 5.625e-5:

54,136.8 * 5.625e-5 = (54,136.8 * 5.625) * 1e-5.

54,136.8 * 5.625 = ?

Well, let me compute 54,136.8 * 5 = 270,684.

54,136.8 * 0.625 = ?

0.625 is 5/8.

54,136.8 * 5 = 270,684.

So 54,136.8 * (5/8) = 270,684 / 8 = 33,835.5.

So, total is 270,684 + 33,835.5 = 304,519.5.

So,

54,136.8 * 5.625 = 304,519.5.

Multiply by 1e-5:

304,519.5 * 1e-5 = 30.45195.

So, the first part is -30.45195 (unit? Let me think about the units).

Wait, but let me make sure about the units:

The term (2 * g * (rho_water - rho) * r²) has units:

g (m/s²) * (kg/m³) * (m)^2 = (m/s²) * (kg/m³) * m² = (m/s²) * (kg/m³) * m² = (m/s²) * (kg/m) * m = (m/s²) * (kg/m) * m.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck in the unit analysis. Let's proceed with the numbers.

So, the first part is -30.45195.

Now, divide this by (9 * mu * rho_water).

mu = 1.004e-3 Pa·s.

rho_water = 1e3 kg/m³.

9 * mu = 9 * 1.004e-3 = 9.036e-3.

9 * mu * rho_water = 9.036e-3 * 1e3 = 9.036.

So,

(2 * g * (rho_water - rho) * r^2 ) / (9 * mu * rho_water ) = (-30.45195) / (9.036) ≈ -3.366.

Then, multiply by (1 - rho_ore / rho_water):

rho_ore / rho_water = 2600 / 1000 = 2.6.

1 - 2.6 = -1.6.

So,

-3.366 * (-1.6) = 5.3856.

So, the velocity is approximately 5.3856 m/s.

But wait, that seems too high because the mineral is less dense than water. So, the velocity should be upward, but 5 m/s is a significant velocity. Let me check if I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula without the (1 - rho_ore / rho_water) term. Because in the formula, when I have (1 - rho_ore / rho_water), it's because the terminal velocity depends on the ratio of the densities. So, perhaps the formula is:

v = ( (2/9) (rho_water - rho) r^2 g ) / ( mu rho_water (1 - rho_ore / rho_water) )

Wait, but that would change the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct as I used, and the velocity is indeed 5.3856 m/s.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula is for the terminal velocity, which is the velocity at which the mineral neither rises nor falls. So, when the mineral is denser than water, the terminal velocity is upward, which means that the mineral is settling upward with a velocity of 5.3856 m/s. But that seems high. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, the formula I used gives velocity in m/s. So, 5.3856 m/s is a reasonable number, but perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula without the (1 - rho_ore / rho_water) term. Because when I have (1 - rho_ore / rho_water), it's because the terminal velocity depends on the ratio of the densities. So, perhaps the formula is correct as I used, and the velocity is indeed 5.3856 m/s.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the value again, more carefully.

First, compute the numerator:

2 * 9.81 * (1000 - 3800) * (0.0075)^2

= 2 * 9.81 * (-2800) * 0.00005625

= 2 * 9.81 * (-2800) * 0.00005625

Compute step by step.

2 * 9.81 = 19.62.

19.62 * (-2800) = -54,136.

-54,136 * 0.00005625 = ?

0.00005625 = 5.625e-5.

-54,136 * 5.625e-5 = ?

Multiply 54,136 by 5.625e-5:

54,136 * 5.625e-5 = 54,136 * 5.625 / 1e5.

54,136 * 5 = 270,680.

54,136 * 0.625 = 34,460.

So, 270,680 + 34,460 = 305,140.

305,140 / 1e5 = 3.0514.

But since it's negative, it's -3.0514.

So, the numerator is -3.0514.

Denominator is 9 * mu * rho_water.

mu = 1.004e-3 Pa·s.

rho_water = 1e3 kg/m³.

9 * 1.004e-3 * 1e3 = 9 * 1.004e-3 * 1e3 = 9 * 1.004e0 = 9 * 10.04 = 90.36.

Wait, no, let me compute 9 * 1.004e-3 * 1e3.

9 * 1.004e-3 = 9.036e-3.

Then, 9.036e-3 * 1e3 = 9.036e0 = 9.036.

So, denominator is 9.036.

So, velocity v = (-3.0514) / 9.036 = approximately -0.3378 m/s.

Wait, but that can't be right because I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity using the formula:

v = ( (2 * g * (rho_water - rho) * r^2 ) ) / (9 * mu * rho_water * (1 - rho_ore / rho_water) )

I think that's more accurate.

So, let me recompute with this.

Compute numerator: 2 * 9.81 * (1000 - 3800) * (0.0075)^2

= 2 * 9.81 * (-2800) * 0.00005625

= 2 * 9.81 * (-2800) * 0.00005625

First, 2 * 9.81 = 19.62.

19.62 * (-2800) = -54,136.

Now, multiply by 0.00005625.

-54,136 * 0.00005625 = ?

0.00005625 = 5.625e-5.

-54,136 * 5.625e-5.

Compute 54,136 * 5.625e-5 = ?

Well, 54,136 * 5.625e-5 = (54,136 * 5.625) / 1e5.

54,136 * 5.625 = ?

Well, 54,136 * 5 = 270,680.

54,136 * 0.625 = 34,460.

So, total is 270,680 + 34,460 = 305,140.

305,140 / 1e5 = 3.0514.

So, -54,136 * 5.625e-5 = -3.0514.

So, numerator is -3.0514.

Denominator: 9 * mu * rho_water * (1 - rho_ore / rho_water)

mu = 1.004e-3.

rho_water = 1e3 kg/m³.

1 - rho_ore / rho_water = 1 - 2600/1000 = 1 - 2.6 = -1.6.

So, denominator = 9 * 1.004e-3 * 1e3 * (-1.6).

Compute 9 * 1.004e-3 = 9.036e-3.

Multiply by 1e3: 9.036e-3 * 1e3 = 9.036.

Multiply by -1.6: 9.036 * (-1.6) = -14.4576.

So, denominator is -14.4576.

Now, v = numerator / denominator = (-3.0514) / (-14.4576) = 0.211 m/s.

Hmm, that makes more sense. So, the terminal velocity is approximately 0.211 m/s upward.

Wait, that's a much more reasonable number. Let me check the calculations again.

So, denominator:

9 * mu * rho_water * (1 - rho_ore / rho_water)

mu = 1.004e-3.

rho_water = 1e3.

(1 - rho_ore/rho_water) = 1 - 2.6 = -1.6.

So,

9 * 1.004e-3 * 1e3 * (-1.6) = 9 * 1.004e-3 * 1e3 = 9 * 1.004e-3 * 1e3 = 9 * 1.004e0 = 9 * 10.04 = 90.36.

Wait, no, 1.004e-3 * 1e3 is 1.004e0 = 1.004.

So, 9 * 1.004 = 9.036.

Multiply by -1.6: 9.036 * (-1.6) = -14.4576.

So, denominator is -14.4576.

Numerator:

(2 * 9.81 * (1000 - 3800) * (0.0075)^2 )

= 2 * 9.81 * (-2800) * 0.00005625.

Compute 0.00005625 = 5.625e-5.

So,

2 * 9.81 = 19.62.

19.62 * (-2800) = -54,136.

-54,136 * 5.625e-5 = -3.0514.

So, numerator is -3.0514.

Denominator is -14.4576.

So, velocity v = (-3.0514) / (-14.4576) ≈ 0.211 m/s.

So, the terminal velocity is approximately 0.211 m/s upward.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the mineral is less dense than water, so it's settling upward at a steady rate of about 0.21 m/s.

So, that's the calculation. I think that makes sense. I think I made a mistake earlier in the formula, but after recomputing, I arrived at a reasonable answer.

**Final Answer**
The terminal velocity of the mineral is \boxed{0.211 \, \text{m/s}}.
</think>

To determine the terminal velocity of a mineral in water, we use the formula for terminal velocity:

\[ v = \frac{(2 \cdot g \cdot (\rho_{\text{water}} - \rho_{\text{mineral}}) \cdot r^2)}{9 \cdot \mu \cdot \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot (1 - \frac{\rho_{\text{mineral}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}})} \]

Given values:
- \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
- \( \rho_{\text{mineral}} = 3800 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
- \( \mu = 1.004 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Pa·s} \)
- \( r = 7.5 \, \text{mm} = 0.0075 \, \text{m} \)
