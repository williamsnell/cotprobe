Question:

A stack of 7 pennies has a height of 1 centimeter. Nick has a stack of pennies with a height of 4 centimeters. Which equation can be used to find the number of pennies, n, in Nick’s stack of pennies?

Options:

A: n = 4 ÷ 7
B: n = 4 + 7
C: n = 7^4
D: n =7÷4
E: n = 4^7
F: n =7–4
G: n =7+4
H: n = 4 - 7
I: n =7×4

Okay, so I've got this problem here about stacking pennies. Let's see, the question says that a stack of 7 pennies is 1 centimeter tall. Nick has a stack that's 4 centimeters high, and we need to find out how many pennies, n, are in his stack. The options are given from A to I, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the problem mentions that 7 pennies equal 1 cm. So that's a rate. It's like 7 pennies per 1 cm. So the height of the stack is directly proportional to the number of pennies. In other words, the more pennies you have, the taller the stack.

So, if 7 pennies are 1 cm, then each penny contributes 1/7 cm to the total height. So the formula should relate the number of pennies (n) to the height (h) by multiplying n by the height per penny. That would be h = n * (1/7). Or rearranged, n = h * 7.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If 7 pennies make 1 cm, then each penny is 1/7 cm tall. So for n pennies, the height would be (n) * (1/7 cm) = n/7 cm. So if I have h cm, then h = n/7, which means n = 7 * h.

Yes, that makes sense. So the equation is n equals 7 multiplied by the height in centimeters. In this case, Nick's stack is 4 cm tall. So plugging in 4 cm, n = 7 * 4 = 28 pennies. So the equation is n = 7 multiplied by the height.

Looking at the options, let's see what each option says:

A: n = 4 ÷ 7 → That would give a smaller number, like 0.57, which can't be right because 4 cm is more than 1 cm but less than 7 cm. Wait, no, wait. If in the problem, 7 pennies are 1 cm, then each penny is 1/7 cm. So for 4 cm, the number of pennies is 4 ÷ (1/7) = 4 *7 =28. So option A is n=4/7, which is 0.57, way too small. So A is wrong.

B: n=4+7 → 11, that's way higher than 28. So B is incorrect.

C: n=7^4 → 7*7*7*7= 2401, which is way too big. So C is out.

D: n=7 ÷4 → 1.75. That's even smaller than A and way too low.

E: n=4^7 → 16384, which is way too big.

F: n=7–4 → 3. That's still way too low.

G: n=7+4 →11. Same as B.

H: n=4-7 →-3. Negative number of pennies doesn't make sense, so H is wrong.

I: n=7×4 →28. That's exactly what we calculated earlier. So I is correct.

So the correct equation is n=7×4, which is option I.

The height of the stack is directly proportional to the number of pennies. Since 7 pennies equal 1 cm, each penny contributes \( \frac{1}{7} \) cm. Therefore, the number of pennies \( n \) in a stack of height \( h \) cm is given by \( n = 7h \). For Nick's stack at 4 cm, \( n = 7 \times 4 = 28 \). The correct equation is \( n = 7 \times 4 \).
