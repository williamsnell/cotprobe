Okay, so I have this question about a biome and I need to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. The question is: The biome contains plants whose roots cannot go deep due to the presence of a permafrost. Hmm, I remember permafrost is a type of ice layer that's found in cold regions. 

Wait, permafrost is usually found in regions like the Arctic or the regions around them. So plants that can't go deep must be in areas where the soil is thin and the plants can't get enough water to grow deep into the soil. That sounds like the Tundra biome. I think the Tundra is characterized by cold temperatures, low humidity, and very low temperatures. The soil there is often very thin, so plants can't get deep enough into the soil to grow roots. 

Let me think about the options again. Savanna uses grasses and meadows, so the roots can go deep, right? So A is probably not it. The Taiga is the temperate rainforest, which is more forested and has more lush growth, so I don't think the roots can't go deep there. Tundra definitely fits because of the low temperatures and thin soil. The other options like Grassland, which is more grassy and not deep-rooted, and others like Dry steppe (desert), which is low in water but have more layers, but no, the question says the roots can't go deep, so that's only Tundra. 

So the answer should be C: Tundra.

The biome in question is where plants have roots that cannot go deep due to the presence of permafrost. This is characteristic of the Tundra biome, which is characterized by cold, low-temperature conditions and very thin, low-humidity soil. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Tundra
