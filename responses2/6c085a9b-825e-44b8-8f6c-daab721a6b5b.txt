Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the output voltage V_ab(t) given some relationships in the Laplace domain. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that v(t) is equal to 10e^(-4t) multiplied by the unit step function u(t). So, v(t) is 10e^(-4t) for t ≥ 0 and zero otherwise. I remember that the Laplace transform of e^(-at)u(t) is 1/(s+a), right? So the Laplace transform V(s) of v(t) would be 10/(s+4). That's correct.

Now, V_ab(s) is given by the expression [3V(s) + 3s + 27] divided by (s² +6s +8). Let me write that out: V_ab(s) = [3V(s) + 3s +27] / (s² +6s +8). Wait, wait, no: the numerator is 3V(s) + 3s + 27. So, substituting V(s)=10/(s+4), let's compute numerator and denominator.

So first, calculate numerator: 3V(s) is 3*(10)/(s+4) = 30/(s+4). Then plus 3s +27. So altogether, numerator is 30/(s+4) + 3s +27. The denominator is s² +6s+8. 

Wait, maybe I can combine the numerator terms. Let's see, to combine 30/(s+4) with 3s +27, perhaps it's easier to have a common denominator. Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by (s+4) to simplify.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed step by step. Let me compute the numerator first. So, 3V(s) is 30/(s+4), and adding 3s +27. Let's write the numerator as a single fraction. So, 30/(s+4) + (3s +27) = [30 + (3s+27)(s+4)] / (s+4). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the (3s +27) term doesn't have a denominator. Hmm, perhaps I should just keep the numerator as it is and proceed.

Wait, let me think again. The expression is [3V(s) + 3s + 27]/(s² +6s +8). So substituting V(s) gives numerator: 3*(10/(s+4)) +3s +27. So, that's 30/(s+4) +3s +27. Let me combine them into a single fraction. To do that, I'll find a common denominator, which is (s+4).

So, 30/(s+4) + 3s +27 can be written as [30 + (3s +27)(s+4)]/(s+4). Wait, no, that's not right because 3s +27 doesn't have a denominator. Oh wait, perhaps I should just treat 30/(s+4) as is and add 3s +27 as terms. Let me compute each term:

3V(s) = 3*(10)/(s+4) = 30/(s+4).

3s +27 is just 3s +27.

So the numerator becomes (30)/(s+4) +3s +27.

Hmm, to combine these terms, perhaps it's easier to write everything over (s+4). So 3s +27 is equal to (3s +27)(s+4)/(s+4). Let me compute that:

(3s +27)(s+4) = 3s(s) + 3s*4 + 27s +27*4 = 3s² +12s +27s +108 = 3s² +39s +108.

So the numerator becomes (30 + 3s² +39s +108) / (s+4) = (3s² +39s +138)/(s+4).

So the entire V_ab(s) is [ (3s² +39s +138)/(s+4) ] / (s² +6s +8). Hmm, that's (3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+4)(s² +6s +8) ].

Wait, maybe I can factor the denominator. Let's factor s² +6s +8. Hmm, s² +6s +8 factors into (s+2)(s+4). Oh, so denominator is (s+4)(s+2)(s+4) or (s+4)^2 (s+2). So the denominator is (s+4)^2 (s+2).

Now, the numerator is 3s² +39s +138. Let me factor out a 3; that gives 3(s² +13s +46). Hmm, but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's perform partial fraction decomposition.

Wait, the overall expression is V_ab(s) = (3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+4)^2 (s+2) ) ].

We can express this as (A)/(s+4) + (B)/(s+4)^2 + (C)/(s+2). Then, find A, B, C.

So, let me set up the equation:

3s² +39s +138 = A (s+4)(s+2) + B (s+2) + C (s+4)^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. When you have a denominator like (s+4)^2 (s+2), the partial fraction decomposition will be:

V_ab(s) = A/(s+4) + B/(s+4)^2 + C/(s+2).

Multiply both sides by (s+4)^2 (s+2) to get:

3s² +39s +138 = A (s+4)(s+2) + B (s+2) + C (s+4)^2.

Now, expand the right side:

A (s^2 +6s +8) + B (s +2) + C (s^2 +8s +16).

So, grouping terms:

A s^2 +6A s +8A + B s +2B + C s^2 +8C s +16C.

Combine like terms:

(A + C) s² + (6A + B +8C) s + (8A +2B +16C).

This must equal the numerator 3s² +39s +138. So we can set up equations for each coefficient.

So:

1) A + C = 3. (Coefficient of s²)
2) 6A + B +8C =39. (Coefficient of s)
3) 8A +2B +16C =138. (Constant term)

Hmm, let's solve this system of equations.

From equation 1: C =3 -A.

Substitute into equation 2 and 3.

Equation 2: 6A + B +8*(3 -A) =39.

6A + B +24 -8A =39

(-2A) + B +24 =39 → -2A + B =15 → B = 2A +15. (Equation 2a)

Equation 3: 8A +2B +16*(3 -A) =138.

8A +2B +48 -16A =138.

Combine terms: (8A -16A) +2B +48 =138 → (-8A) +2B =90 → Divide both sides by 2: -4A + B =45. (Equation 3a)

Now, substitute B from equation 2a into equation 3a.

Equation 3a: -4A + (2A +15) =45.

-4A +2A +15 =45 → -2A +15=45 → -2A=30 → A= -15.

Now, A is -15. So from equation 1: C=3 - (-15) =18.

From equation 2a: B=2*(-15)+15 = -30 +15 =-15.

So A=-15, B=-15, C=18.

So, V_ab(s) = (-15)/(s+4) + (-15)/(s+4)^2 + 18/(s+2).

Now, we can take the inverse Laplace transform term by term.

Each term corresponds to certain functions.

Laplace transform pairs:

1/(s+a) → e^(-at) u(t),
1/(s+a)^2 → t e^(-at) u(t),
1/(s+a) → e^(-at) u(t).

So,

-15/(s+4) → -15 e^(-4t) u(t),
-15/(s+4)^2 → -15 t e^(-4t) u(t),
18/(s+2) → 18 e^(-2t) u(t).

So combining these, V_ab(t) is:

-15 e^(-4t) -15 t e^(-4t) +18 e^(-2t).

Wait, but wait a second. The original expression for V_ab(s) after partial fraction decomposition was:

V_ab(s) = [3s² +39s +138] / [ (s+4)^2 (s+2) ]

But when we decomposed, we got A=-15, B=-15, C=18.

Wait, let me check if I made any calculation mistakes. Because when I substitute A into equation 3a, let me recheck:

Equation 3a: -4A + B =45.

A is -15, so -4*(-15) =60. So 60 + B =45 → B= -15. That's correct.

So the expression is correct. So the inverse Laplace is correct.

So, V_ab(t) = -15 e^{-4t} -15 t e^{-4t} + 18 e^{-2t}.

Looking at the options, let me see which one matches.

Option A: -15te^-4t -15e^-4t + 18e^-2t → this is same as what I have. So A is -15t e^-4t -15 e^-4t +18 e^-2t.

Wait, but wait looking again: I have -15t e^{-4t} -15 e^{-4t} +18 e^{-2t}.

So that's option A.

Wait, but I thought option A was in the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: -15te^-4t -15e^-4t +18e^-2t

Yes, that's option A.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the problem statement, the expression for V_ab(s) is [3V(s) +3s +27]/(s² +6s +8). So, when I expanded that, I got V_ab(s) = (-15)/(s+4) + (-15)/(s+4)^2 +18/(s+2). So my inverse transform is correct.

Therefore, the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we start by finding the Laplace transform \( V(s) \) of \( v(t) = 10e^{-4t}u(t) \). Using the Laplace transform property for exponential functions, we have:

\[
V(s) = \frac{10}{s + 4}.
\]

Next, we substitute \( V(s) \) into the given expression for \( V_{ab}(s) \):

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3V(s) + 3s + 27}{s^2 + 6s + 8}.
\]

Substituting \( V(s) = \frac{10}{s + 4} \) into the numerator:

\[
3V(s) = 3 \cdot \frac{10}{s + 4} = \frac{30}{s + 4}.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
3V(s) + 3s + 27 = \frac{30}{s + 4} + 3s + 27.
\]

To combine the terms, we express everything over a common denominator of \( s + 4 \):

\[
\frac{30}{s + 4} + 3s + 27 = \frac{30 + (3s + 27)(s + 4)}{s + 4}.
\]

Expanding \( (3s + 27)(s + 4) \):

\[
(3s + 27)(s + 4) = 3s^2 + 12s + 27s + 108 = 3s^2 + 39s + 108.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
30 + 3s^2 + 39s + 108 = 3s^2 + 39s + 138.
\]

The entire expression for \( V_{ab}(s) \) is:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3s^2 + 39s + 138}{(s + 4)^2(s + 2)}.
\]

To find \( V_{ab}(t) \), we perform partial fraction decomposition:

\[
\frac{3s^2 + 39s + 138}{(s + 4)^2(s + 2)} = \frac{A}{s + 4} + \frac{B}{(s + 4)^2} + \frac{C}{s + 2}.
\]

Multiplying through by the denominator and equating coefficients, we solve for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \):

1. \( A + C = 3 \),
2. \( 6A + B + 8C = 39 \),
3. \( 8A + 2B + 16C = 138 \).

Solving these equations, we find:

\[
A = -15, \quad B = -15, \quad C = 18.
\]

Thus, the partial fractions are:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{-15}{s + 4} + \frac{-15}{(s + 4)^2} + \frac{18}{s + 2}.
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

1. \( \frac{-15}{s + 4} \) corresponds to \( -15e^{-4t}u(t) \),
2. \( \frac{-15}{(s + 4)^2} \) corresponds to \( -15te^{-4t}u(t) \),
3. \( \frac{18}{s + 2} \) corresponds to \( 18e^{-2t}u(t) \).

Combining these, the output voltage is:

\[
V_{ab}(t) = -15e^{-4t} - 15te^{-4t} + 18e^{-2t}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**A: \( V_{ab}(t) = -15te^{-4t} - 15e^{-4t} + 18e^{-2t} \)**.
