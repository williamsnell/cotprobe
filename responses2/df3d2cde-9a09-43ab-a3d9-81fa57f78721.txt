Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the balance of payments deficit. Let me think through each option carefully. 

The question is asking what a balance of payments deficit means. I remember that the balance of payments is a record of all the country's money movements. There are two sides: what the country receives (outflows) and what it sends (inflows). 

A balance of payments deficit occurs when the country's outflows exceed its inflows. So, that means the country has more money coming into it from abroad than it's sending back. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: "taken in more money than it has sent abroad." This sounds correct because if the country is taking in more, it's outflowing more than inflow. So the balance would be negative, hence a deficit.

Option B: "Decreased its national income." That doesn't seem right. A balance of payments deficit doesn't directly affect national income. National income is more about GDP and economic output.

Option C: "Reduced its national debt." A deficit doesn't necessarily mean the country is reducing debt. It could mean the debt is growing or it's facing more liabilities. For example, if the debt is high and the deficit is growing, the country might have to pay more to pay off debt, leading to an increase in debt or potentially negative cash flows.

Option D: "Exported and imported goods at an equal rate." If exports and imports are equal, there's no current account deficit or surplus. So this would mean no deficit, but a balance of payments is zero. So this is not a deficit.

Option E: "Lowered its official reserve position." An increase in official reserves would mean the country is running a deficit because it's holding onto more money. So lowering reserves would mean the country is running a surplus. Wait, but that's about the central bank's reserves, not the balance of payments itself. So E isn't directly related.

Option F: "Increased its national income." No, that doesn't make sense. National income is related to GDP, but the balance of payments is a different metric. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "Increased its official reserve position." This would mean the country is running a deficit because more reserves mean it's holding onto more money (outflows). So G is the opposite of a deficit.

Option H: "Exports more than it has imported." This is the same as saying the country is running a current account surplus. Because exports minus imports equals the current account balance. So H is not a deficit.

Option I: "Imported more than it has exported." That's the opposite of H. So this would be a current account deficit. So I is not correct.

Option J: "Increased its national debt." A balance of payments deficit doesn't directly affect the national debt. It could mean that the country is accumulating debt if the current account is a deficit and other factors like trade balances. But national debt is a separate measure. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is A. The country is taking in more money than it's sending abroad, leading to a balance of payments deficit.

The balance of payments deficit occurs when a country's outflow of money exceeds its inflow, resulting in a negative balance. This is best described by Option A: "taken in more money than it has sent abroad." 

Answer: A
