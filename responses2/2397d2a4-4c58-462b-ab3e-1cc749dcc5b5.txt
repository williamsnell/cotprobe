Okay, so I'm looking at this question about Rawls's theory. Hmm, I remember that Rawls was a philosopher, specifically a philosopher of society, and he wrote a book called "On the Structure of Definitely Ordered Societies." I think he was interested in how people should be organized and what rights should be given them.

The question is about what information an occupant has in Rawls's original position. The options are A to D, with D being none of the above. Let me think about the key points from his work.

I recall that Rawls talked about the concept of a "just state" and the idea that society should be arranged in a way that is governed by certain principles of justice. He discussed different rights and obligations that should be established. 

Wait, one of the main ideas in his theory is about the principle of justice in society. He believed that a just state should have certain essential rights that everyone must have, regardless of their background. For example, everyone should have the right to a free will, freedom from interference, and all rights to some end. 

I'm trying to remember if he talked about knowledge of abilities. Oh right! He discussed the concept of "human rights" and how individuals should have certain rights. He also talked about the "contribution of the individual" and the "state of the person." 

Wait, there's something about the nature of knowledge. I think he believed that every person has knowledge of their own abilities, but he didn't specifically say whether it's knowledge of abilities or just social status. He might have talked about individual rights and the ability to know one's own worth. 

Looking at the options: A says knowledge of being talent compared to others. B is about social status. C is about abilities like intelligence, strength. D says none of the above.

I'm trying to remember if the key point was about individual knowledge of abilities, not about social status. Rawls might have discussed that everyone should know their own abilities, not just social status. So maybe the answer is C: knowledge of abilities.

Wait, another angle. The "contribution of the individual" is a big concept in his theory. He talked about how each person's contribution should be recognized. So perhaps this relates to knowing abilities because knowing your own abilities allows you to contribute effectively. 

But the question is about what information is available. So if someone is an occupant, like a worker or a citizen, they have to know their abilities. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to contribute effectively. So in Rawls's position, occupants would have the knowledge of their own abilities, which includes intelligence, strength, etc. 

So the answer would be C: knowledge of one's abilities, such as intelligence, strength, etc. That makes sense because he's concerned with individual rights and the basis for their rights.

The correct answer is C: knowledge of one's abilities, such as intelligence, strength, etc.
