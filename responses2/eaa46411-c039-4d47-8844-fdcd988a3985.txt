Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric and magnetic fields. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. The question states that a test charge q is moving with velocity v = (i_x + i_y) m/s, and it experiences no force in a region with electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic flux density B is given as (i_x - 2i_z) Wb/m². I need to find the electric field E.

Wait, right. So when a charged particle moves in an electric and magnetic field without any force, the Lorentz force must be zero. The Lorentz force equation is F = q(E + v × B). Since the force is zero, we can write 0 = q(E + v × B). Since q isn't zero, we can divide both sides by q, so E + v × B = 0. That means E = -v × B.

Oh yeah, that's the key equation. So I need to compute the cross product of v and B and then take the negative of that to get E.

Let me write down the velocity v and B. v is (i_x + i_y) m/s, so in vector form, v = v_x i + v_y j + v_z k. Since v has i_x and i_y, v_z is zero. So v = (1, 1, 0).

B is given as (i_x - 2i_z), so B = B_x i + B_y j + B_z k. Here, B_x is 1, B_z is -2, and B_y is zero. So B = (1, 0, -2).

Wait, let's make sure about the components. v is (i_x + i_y), so v = 1 i + 1 j + 0 k. B is (i_x - 2i_z), so B = 1 i + 0 j + (-2) k.

Now, I need to compute the cross product v × B. The cross product of two vectors a = (a_x i + a_y j + a_z k) and b = (b_x i + b_y j + b_z k) is given by:

a × b = (a_y b_z - a_z b_y)i - (a_x b_z - a_z b_x)j + (a_x b_y - a_y b_x)k.

So let's apply that to v × B.

Given v = (1,1,0) and B=(1,0,-2).

Let me plug into the formula:

v × B = (v_y B_z - v_z B_y) i - (v_x B_z - v_z B_x) j + (v_x B_y - v_y B_x) k.

Since v_z is zero and B_y is zero, let's compute each component.

i component: v_y * B_z - v_z * B_y = (1)(-2) - 0*0 = -2.

j component: -(v_x B_z - v_z B_x) = -(1*(-2) - 0*1) = -(-2) = 2.

k component: v_x B_y - v_y B_x = 1*0 - 1*1 = -1.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the j term. Oh wait, it's -(v_x B_z - v_z B_x). So v_x is 1, B_z is -2, v_z is 0, B_x is 1. So (1*(-2) - 0*1) = (-2), then negative of that is +2. So the j component is 2.

So v × B is (-2 i + 2 j - 1 k). 

But wait, I thought the cross product formula for the i component is (a_y b_z - a_z b_y). So in this case, a_y is 1, b_z is -2; a_z is 0, b_y is 0. So 1*(-2) - 0*0 = -2. Correct.

So v × B = (-2, 2, -1). So in vector form, -2i + 2j -1k.

But wait, that's the result of v × B. So the equation E = -v × B would be:

E = - ( -2i + 2j -1k ) = 2i - 2j +1k.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Because E = - (v × B).

So if v × B is (-2, 2, -1), then E is - (v × B) = (2, -2, 1).

So E has components (2, -2, 1). But the options are given in terms of i_x, i_y, etc.

So E would be (2i_x - 2i_y + i_z) volts/m. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option D is (2ix - 2iy + iz) volts/m. So that's option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have messed up the signs.

Wait, let me recompute v × B. Let me write v as (1,1,0) and B as (1,0,-2).

The cross product is determinant:

i | j | k
1 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | -2

So expanding:

i*(1*(-2) - 0*0) - j*(1*(-2) - 0*1) + k*(1*0 - 1*1).

That's i*(-2) - j*(-2) + k*(-1).

So i component is -2, j component is +2, k component is -1.

So v × B is (-2i + 2j -1k). So E = -v × B would be +2i -2j +1k. Which is (2i_x - 2i_y +i_z) volts/m. So yes, option D is that.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is (2ix - 2i_y +i_z) volts/m, which matches. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The cross product is v × B, which is (-2, 2, -1). So -v × B is (2, -2, 1), which is (2i_x - 2i_y + i_z).

Wait, that's correct, so E is (2i_x - 2i_y + i_z) volts/m. So option D is the answer.

To determine the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \), we use the fact that the Lorentz force is zero when the test charge moves in the region of electric and magnetic fields. This implies \( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = 0 \), or equivalently, \( \mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \).

### Step 1: Define the vectors
The velocity of the test charge is \( \mathbf{v} = v_x \mathbf{i} + v_y \mathbf{j} + v_z \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{i}_x + \mathbf{i}_y \), so \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 0) \).

The magnetic flux density is \( \mathbf{B} = B_x \mathbf{i} + B_y \mathbf{j} + B_z \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{i}_x - 2\mathbf{i}_z \), so \( \mathbf{B} = (1, 0, -2) \).

### Step 2: Compute the cross product \( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \)
Using the formula for the cross product:
\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
v_x & v_y & v_z \\
B_x & B_y & B_z
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Substitute \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{B} = (1, 0, -2) \):
\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{i}(v_y B_z - v_z B_y) - \mathbf{j}(v_x B_z - v_z B_x) + \mathbf{k}(v_x B_y - v_y B_x)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(1 \cdot (-2) - 0 \cdot 0) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot (-2) - 0 \cdot 1) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot 1)
\]
\[
= -2\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j} - \mathbf{k}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \mathbf{E} \)
Since \( \mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \):
\[
\mathbf{E} = -(-2\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j} - \mathbf{k}) = 2\mathbf{i} - 2\mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The electric field is \( \mathbf{E} = 2\mathbf{i}_x - 2\mathbf{i}_y + \mathbf{i}_z \), which corresponds to **option D**.
