Question:

As punishment for bad behavior during recess, Mrs. Busywork asked her class to multiply 10 by $\frac{1}{3}$ five times. John, however, notices that it is possible to multiply 10 by a single fraction and still get the same answer as the other students. What is this single fraction?

Options:

A: \frac{1}{243}
B: \frac{1}{2}
C: \frac{1}{729}
D: \frac{1}{100}
E: \frac{1}{3}
F: \frac{1}{27}
G: \frac{1}{68}
H: \frac{1}{64}
I: \frac{1}{125}
J: \frac{1}{81}

Alright, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about multiplying 10 by 1/3 five times, and John notices that instead of multiplying 10 by 1/3 each time, he can multiply 10 by a single fraction and get the same result. I need to find what that single fraction is. The options are given from A to J, all fractions with different denominators.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down. When you multiply a number by a fraction, each multiplication is a scaling. So, multiplying by 1/3 each time is the same as multiplying by (1/3)^5, right? Because each time you're multiplying by 1/3, and you're doing it five times. So, 10 multiplied by (1/3) five times is the same as 10 * (1/3)^5.

Wait, let me think again. No, actually, each multiplication is of 10 by 1/3, so the first step is 10 * (1/3) = 10/3. Then multiply that by 1/3 again: (10/3) * (1/3) = 10/9. And so on, five times in total. So, the result after five multiplications would be 10 * (1/3)^5, which is 10 divided by 3^5. 

Calculating 3^5: 3 *3 is 9, 9*3 is 27, 27*3 is 81, and 81*3 is 243. So, 3^5 is 243. Therefore, 10 divided by 243 is 10/243. So, the product is 10/243.

John, instead of doing five multiplications, multiplies 10 by a single fraction. That fraction must be 1/243 because 10 * (1/243) equals 10/243, which is the same as multiplying by (1/3)^5. So, the single fraction is 1/243. Looking at the options, option A is 1/243. So the answer should be option A.

The correct answer is **A: \frac{1}{243}** because multiplying 10 by (1/3) five times is equivalent to multiplying by (1/3)^5 = 1/243.

Answer: A
