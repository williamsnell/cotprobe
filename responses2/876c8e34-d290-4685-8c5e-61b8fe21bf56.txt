Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says: Members of the economy wish to hold money balances equal to 5 weeks of expenditure, and all income is spent. They want to know the desired level of money balances when aggregate income is $1,600 billion per annum. The options are A through J, with various amounts.

Hmm, I remember that the concept of money demand is usually discussed in the context of the quantity theory of money and the monetary neutrality of money. But let me think about the basic formula. The quantity equation is something like:

M × V = P × Y

But wait, in the context of money demand, people hold money equal to the transaction demand. But sometimes, we consider the demand for money as being tied to the income multiplied by the velocity of money. Oh right, the formula for the demand for money is M = k × Y, where k is the velocity of money and Y is the income. But wait, sometimes it's phrased as money supply equals income multiplied by velocity, so M = P × V × Y? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the relationship between money supply (M) and the velocity of money (V) is V = Y/P × M. Wait, no, I think the standard equation is M × V = P × Y, which comes from the quantity theory. But V is the velocity of money, so if V is constant (which it is in the short run because people hold money equal to transactions, and velocity doesn't change much when the economy is growing), then M would be equal to (P × Y)/V. But I'm not sure if that's right.

Wait, no, the quantity equation is M × V = P × Y. If V is constant, then M = (P × Y)/V. But when V is considered constant, M is directly proportional to P × Y. However, in the money demand equation, it's often written as M = k × Y, where k is the amount of money needed per transaction, which is 1/V. So if V is the velocity, then k = 1/V. So M = (1/V) × Y.

But in the problem, it says that members want to hold money equal to 5 weeks of expenditure. So the desired money balance is 5 weeks multiplied by the average transaction size. Let me think in terms of units. Expenditure is dollars, and weeks. So 5 weeks is 5/52 of a year. Wait, but the income is in billions per annum, so maybe I should convert that.

Wait, the question says aggregate income is $1,600 billion per annum. So the desired money balance is 5 weeks multiplied by the average weekly expenditure. But since the income is spent entirely, the total expenditure is equal to the total income. So perhaps I should find the nominal money supply needed to cover 5 weeks of spending.

Wait, but the problem states that all income is spent. So total income is equal to total spending. So the total expenditure is $1,600 billion. So in terms of weeks, 5 weeks is 5/52 of a year. So the desired money supply should be the total expenditure multiplied by the number of weeks they wish to hold.

Wait, no. Wait, if I want to hold 5 weeks worth of money, that's 5 * (Y / 52) because Y is the annual income. Because 1 year is 52 weeks, so 1 week is Y/52. So 5 weeks is 5Y/52. So the desired money balance is M = 5Y/52.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If you have Y per year, the weekly expenditure is Y/52. So 5 weeks would be 5*(Y/52) = (5Y)/52. So M = 5Y/52. So substituting Y as 1,600 billion, M = (5 * 1,600) / 52.

Let me calculate that. 5 times 1,600 is 8,000. Then 8,000 divided by 52. Let's see, 52*150 is 7,800. So 52*153 is 7,800 + (52*3)= 7,800+156=7,956. Then 8,000-7,956 is 44. So 44/52 is approximately 0.846. So 153 plus 0.846 is about 153.846.

Looking at the options, option A is $153,846 billion. So that's the answer.

Another way to think about it: If the desired money supply is equal to the real money demand, which is the nominal money demand, then M = Y * k, where k is the velocity. But wait, wait, in the quantity equation, M * V = P * Y. So if V is constant, then M = (P * Y)/V. But in the money demand equation, it's M = k * Y, where k is 1/V. So yes, M = (1/V) * Y. But in this case, since all income is spent, and we're not told about the velocity, perhaps the velocity is considered constant, so M = (1/V) * Y. But without knowing V, we can't compute exact numbers, but the problem states that all income is spent. 

Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. Since the problem states that the desired money balance is 5 weeks of expenditure. Another way: 5 weeks times the average weekly expenditure. Since Y is the annual income, 5 weeks is Y/52 *5. So M = (5/52) * Y. So substituting Y=1,600 billion, M = (5 * 1600)/52 = 8000/52 = approximately 153.846 billion. So the answer is A.

To determine the desired level of money balances, we start by noting that the members wish to hold money equal to 5 weeks of expenditure. Since the total annual income is $1,600 billion, we can calculate the weekly expenditure as:

\[
\text{Weekly expenditure} = \frac{\text{Annual income}}{52} = \frac{1600}{52} \approx 30.77 \text{ billion dollars}.
\]

Thus, 5 weeks of expenditure would be:

\[
\text{Desired money balance} = 5 \times 30.77 \approx 153.85 \text{ billion dollars}.
\]

This matches option A, which is $153,846 billion.
