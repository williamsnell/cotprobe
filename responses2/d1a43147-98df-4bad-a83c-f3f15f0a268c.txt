Okay, so I've got this question about Booth's 1901 study on poverty in London. I'm a bit rusty on my historical data, but I'll try to think this through. Let me start by recalling what I know about Booth's work. 

Booth, I think, was a statistician, right? His studies were probably part of the larger work on social indicators, like income and unemployment. I remember that in the 19th century, the UK had a high rate of poverty. So, Booth's study must have been one of the early ones to measure this.

Wait, were there other studies before him? Oh yeah, there's the 1895 report by the Office for National Statistics, but that might be more of a foundational document. Booth's work specifically looked at the percentage of the population living in poverty. I think he used data from the 1890 census.

Oh right, the 1890 census in London found that a significant portion of the population was living below the poverty line. I think Booth's 1901 study probably built on that. I remember reading somewhere that he found the percentage to be around 27.5%. 

Looking at the options provided, D is 27.50%. That seems like the one. But wait, I should double-check. Another possibility is Booth's work might have been slightly different. Was it the 1900 or 1901 study? Oh, the question says 1901, so I think that's correct.

Alternatively, I'm trying to remember if I saw any other percentages close to this. No, I don't think there's another option that's around 27.5%. So based on Booth's 1901 study, the correct answer should be D: 27.50%.
