Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to express the number (6,400,000 divided by 400) in scientific notation. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on scientific notation, but I remember it's a way to write numbers as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. So, the general form is a × 10^b, where 1 ≤ a < 10.

First, I should probably compute the division part: 6,400,000 divided by 400. Let me do that. Calculating 6.4 million divided by 400. Wait, 6,400,000 is the same as 6.4 x 10^6. And 400 is 4 x 10^2. So dividing 6.4e6 by 4e2.

Dividing the coefficients: 6.4 / 4 = 1.6. Then the exponents: 10^6 / 10^2 = 10^(6-2) = 10^4. So the result is 1.6 × 10^4. 

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 6.4 million divided by 400. Another way to think about it: 6,400,000 / 400. Well, 400 goes into 6,000,000 15,000 times (since 400 * 15,000 = 6,000,000). But wait, the 400 is 400, and we're dealing with 6,400,000, which is 400 more. So 400 *15,000=6,000,000. So 6,000,000 /400 = 15,000. Then the remaining 400 is 400/400 =1. So total is 15,000 + 1 =15,001. So 15,001 is the result. But in scientific notation, that's 1.5001e4, which is approximately 1.5e4. But looking at the answer options, I don't see 1.5e4. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, maybe I should have done it in another way. Let's calculate 6,400,000 ÷ 400. Let's divide both numerator and denominator by 100 to make it easier. 6,400,000 ÷ 100 is 64,000. 400 ÷100 is 4. So now, it's 64,000 ÷4. 64,000 divided by 4 is 16,000. Oh wait, that's 16,000. Which is 1.6 ×10^4. Because 16 ×10^3 is 1.6 ×10^4. So that's 1.6e4.

Wait, so that matches with the calculation I did earlier. So the answer should be 1.6 ×10^4.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.6 ×10^4. So that's the correct one. Let me make sure none of the other options match this. Option A is 6.4e4, which is way larger. 6.4e4 is 64,000, but our result is 16,000. So no. Option B is 4e4, which is 40,000. No. Option C is 6.4e3, which is 6400. No. Option D is 4e6, which is way too big. Option E is 1.6e5, which is 160,000. No. Option F is 1.6e6, which is 1,600,000. No. Option G is 4e5, which is 400,000. No. Option H is 1.6e3, which is 1600. No. Option I is 1.6e4, which is 16,000. Yes, that's correct. Option J is 6.4e5, which is 640,000. No.

So the correct answer is I: 1.6 ×10^4.
