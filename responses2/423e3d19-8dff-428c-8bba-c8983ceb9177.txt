Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the 'Lotus principle'. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with it, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about international law and the various principles that govern disputes between nations.

The question is asking what the 'Lotus principle' refers to. The options are labeled from A to J, each claiming a different principle. I remember that the Lotus principle is sometimes referred to as the 'Constitutional Law of the States' or something along those lines. It's a concept that has been discussed in the context of international law and how countries handle their internal affairs when interacting with each other.

Option A says customary law is superior to treaty law. I'm not sure about this. I think treaty law is more commonly used, but I'm not certain if that's the Lotus principle.

Option B suggests that States can intervene in other nations' internal affairs if they're national security. That sounds familiar. I've heard this referred to as the 'Constitutional Law of the States' or sometimes as the 'Lotus principle.' It's a principle that states that a country can, to the extent it can, govern its own internal affairs as per its own constitution or laws, unless it's restricted by international law.

Option C claims States can apply their own domestic laws in disputes. Wait, that doesn't sound quite right. I thought the Lotus principle was more about the ability of a state to limit or restrict the use of international laws, perhaps.

Option D states international law governs relations between states, not individuals. This sounds more like the principle of international law. Maybe that's the Uniform Law Principle, but I'm not sure.

Option E is about unlimited jurisdiction over citizens. That doesn't make sense. Jurisdiction is usually limited, and it's not about unlimited.

Option F says States can ignore international law as long as they don't infringe others' sovereignty. Hmm, not sure about this one. I think the Lotus principle might allow a state to respect its own sovereignty even if international law says otherwise, but I'm not certain.

Option G mentions that restrictions on independence can't be presumed, or that prohibitions are allowed. I'm not certain about this either. It might relate to the concept that a state can't assert its sovereignty beyond what's prohibited by international law, which is similar to the Lotus principle.

Option H says customary law is derived from state practice and opinion juris. I'm not sure how this connects directly to the Lotus principle. Maybe it's more about the basis of laws, but I don't see the connection.

Option I suggests customary law is from the combination of state practice and opini ons. That seems related to the Uniform Law Principle, but again, not the Lotus principle.

Option J is about states choosing the court to handle disputes. That doesn't quite fit the lotus principle, which is more about legal principles rather than court selection.

So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards option B or G. The Lotus principle is about States being able to rule their own internal affairs under their own laws unless restricted by international law. Option B says States can intervene if it's national security, which aligns with that idea. Option G also touches on a similar point about exceptions to international law. Hmm, but which one is the correct definition.

Wait, I think I've read that the Lotus principle refers to the principle that States are not bound by international law unless it's prohibited by their own constitution. So, a state can limit the use of international law, which is the Lotus principle. So, in this case, the principle would allow states to have their own laws, which would include limiting or restricting international law.

Looking at the options, option B is about interning state intervention for national security, which is a specific application of the principle, but the Lotus principle is more about the general rule that states can have their own laws unless restricted by their own laws. So perhaps the best fit is option B or G.

Wait, the Lotus principle might be a more general concept. The Uniform Law Principle (ULP), which I think is another term for the Lotus principle, states that states' laws of sovereignty are derived from their own practice and opinions, not from international law. So, states can't assert sovereignty beyond what's allowed by their own laws. But I'm not certain if that's exactly the same as the Lotus principle.

Alternatively, the Lotus principle refers to the idea that states can have their own laws, including respecting their own internal security unless otherwise prohibited. So, option B says States can intervene in other states' internal affairs if national security is a concern. That seems to fit the idea that a state can have its own sovereignty, which is part of the Lotus principle.

Another point: the Lotus principle is sometimes called the "Constitutional Law of the States," which is a part of international law. But I'm not entirely sure. 

Looking back, the correct answer is probably option B because it's a direct statement of the Lotus principle. The Lotus principle is that States can assert their own sovereignty and internal affairs unless restricted by international law.

The correct answer is **B: The so-called Lotus principle is that States have the right to intervene in the internal affairs of other States if it concerns their national security.**

**Explanation:** The 'Lotus principle' refers to the principle that states can assert their own sovereignty and internal affairs unless restricted by international law. It emphasizes the state's ability to govern its own internal matters as per its own constitution or laws, without being bound by international law. Option B directly encapsulates this principle, highlighting the state's right to intervene in internal affairs for national security, which aligns with the Lotus principle.
