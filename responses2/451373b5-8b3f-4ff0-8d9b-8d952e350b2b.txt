Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the volume of oxygen needed to burn butane. Hmm, let me think. The question says that 1000 cubic feet of butane is going to burn according to a given equation. The equation is 2 C4H10 + 13 O2 → 8 CO2 + 10 H2O. I need to find out how much oxygen is required.

Wait, the question is about volume. Oh, right, but the ideal gas law applies here, but wait, I think in gas stoichiometry, the volumes are proportional because the gases are at the same temperature and pressure. So the volume ratio should be the same as the mole ratio.

The equation is balanced, so let's see, the mole ratio of butane to oxygen. Butane is C4H10, so the coefficient is 2. Oxygen's coefficient is 13. So for every 2 moles of C4H10, 13 moles of O2 are needed.

But wait, the given is 1000 cubic feet of butane, which is a volume. So I need to find how much oxygen in terms of volume is required. So the volume ratio would be (13 O2) / (2 C4H10) = 13/2. So for each 2 cubic feet of C4H10, you need 13 cubic feet of O2.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the question is asking for the volume of oxygen needed to burn 1000 cubic feet of butane. So it's a volume to volume ratio. So the moles would be in the same ratio as the volumes. So, for each 2 ft³ of butane, 13 ft³ of O2 is needed.

So 1000 ft³ / 2 = 500 times the moles needed. So 500 * 13 = 6500. So the oxygen needed is 6500 cubic feet. Looking at the options, option B is 6500. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way: the equation is 2 butane + 13 O2 → products. So 2 moles butane requires 13 moles O2. So the ratio is 13/2 = 6.5 for oxygen per butane. So 1000 * 6.5 = 6500. Yes, that's correct.

To calculate the volume of oxygen required to completely burn 1000 cubic feet of butane gas, we use the balanced chemical equation:

\[
2\, \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} + 13\, \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 8\, \text{CO}_2 + 10\, \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the equation, the mole ratio of butane to oxygen is \( \frac{2}{13} \). Since the volumes are proportional under the same conditions, the volume ratio is also \( \frac{2}{13} \).

For 1000 cubic feet of butane:
\[
\text{Volume of O}_2 = 1000 \times \frac{13}{2} = 6500 \, \text{cubic feet}.
\]

Thus, the volume of oxygen needed is **6500 cubic feet**.
