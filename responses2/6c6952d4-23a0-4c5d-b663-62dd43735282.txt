Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a shunt motor's mechanical efficiency. Let me go through it step by step.

So the question gives me a shunt motor with armature and field resistances of 0.055 Ω and 32 Ω, respectively. We need to find the counter emf, copper losses, and efficiency. The motor is running at 1400 RPM, and the longitudinal pull on a 6-inch diameter pulley is 57 lbs. The line voltmeter reads 105 V and the ammeter 35 A.

First, I think about what each part means. The shunt motor has a field and armature resistance. The field resistance is 32Ω, and the armature resistance is 0.055Ω. The counter emf is the induced voltage in the armature when current flows, which is important for calculating the actual torque.

Wait, but the field resistance is usually low, so maybe that's part of the shunt configuration. So in a shunt motor, the armature and field currents are split between the armature and the field circuits.

Now, the longitudinal pull is given as 57 pounds. I remember that the pull is related to the torque. The formula for longitudinal pull is P = K * (Ia - If), where K is the constant of proportionality, Ia is the armature current, and If is the field current. Wait, no, I think the formula is P = K * (Ia - If) * (Rf) / (Rf + Ra), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I think P = K * (Ia - If) * (Rf) / (Rf + Ra). Hmm, but maybe I should think again.

Wait, no. I recall that the longitudinal pull (P) is given by P = K * (Ia - If) * Rf, where K is the constant that relates to the torque, and Rf is the field resistance. Oh wait, maybe K is (E_mf / Rf), because E_mf is the back EMF when no current is drawn. So, K = E_mf / Rf.

So, the formula would be P = (E_mf / Rf) * (Ia - If) * Rf → simplifies to P = E_mf (Ia - If). Wait that can't be right because E_mf is constant when the field changes, but I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no. The longitudinal pull is given by P = K * (Ia - If) * Rf. Since K is E_mf / Rf, substituting gives P = (E_mf / Rf) * (Ia - If) * Rf → which simplifies to P = E_mf (Ia - If). So that makes sense. So, P = E_mf (Ia - If).

But wait, the E_mf is the back EMF when there's no current flowing through the field. So, when the motor is running, it's drawing current, so the back EMF is less than E_mf. So, the difference (Ia - If) is actually (Ia) times something.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the given data. The longitudinal pull is 57 lbs. So, P = 57 lb. I need to find Ia and If.

Given that the line voltage (V) is 105 V and the line current (I) is 35 A, the armature resistance (Ra) is 0.055Ω. So, armature current Ia = (V - Ie) / Ra. Wait, Ie is the armature current when there's no voltage applied. Wait no, the line voltage is V = Ia Ra + Ie Ra, because both Ia and Ie flow through Ra.

Wait, no, the armature resistance Ra is in series with the armature circuits. So the armature current Ia is the current through Ra. The line voltage V is equal to the armature's voltage plus the voltage drop in the armature. So, V = Ia Ra + Ie Ra, where Ie is the current in the field circuit. So, V = Ra (Ia + Ie). But Ie is the current through the field, which is E_mf / Rf, since E_mf is the back EMF when Ie is zero. So, E_mf = Ie Rf.

So, E_mf = Ie * Rf. But Ie is E_mf / Rf. So, E_mf = (E_mf / Rf) * Rf → which is correct.

Now, from the line equations:

V = Ra (Ia + Ie) → 105 V = 0.055 (Ia + Ie) → Ia + Ie = 105 / 0.055 ≈ 1909.09 A.

But that's a huge number. Wait, that can't be right because Ie is the field current, which would be E_mf / Rf. So, perhaps Ie is small compared to Ia.

Wait, but let's think about the problem. The motor is running at 1400 rpm; maybe it's a field-test scenario, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the data given is that the longitudinal pull is 57 lbs, and the line settings are V=105V, I=35A. So, Ia is the armature current, which is Ia = (V - Ie Ra) / Ra? No, wait, V is the terminal voltage, so V = Ia Ra + Ie Ra. So, V = Ra (Ia + Ie). So, Ia + Ie = V / Ra. That's correct.

But 105 divided by 0.055 is approximately 1909.09 A. That's a huge current, which would make the armature current very high. But in a motor, armature current is not typically in such a high range. Maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me double-check the values.

Wait, the armature and field resistances are 0.055 and 32Ω, respectively. Line voltage is 105V, line current is 35A.

V = Ia Ra + Ie Ra → Ia + Ie = V / Ra = 105 / 0.055 ≈ 1909.09 A. That's way too high. That can't be right unless the motor is designed for high current, but in reality, armature current depends on feeders, so perhaps this is a typo or I'm not considering something.

Wait, maybe the line current is 35A, but that would require Ie = 35A, because Ie is the current through the field when no armature current flows. So, if Ie = 35A, then E_mf = Ie Rf = 35 * 32 = 1120 V. That's impossible because the armature can't have that voltage. So, that can't be correct.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing a crucial point. Maybe the line current is 35A, but that would mean Ie = 35A. Then E_mf = 35 * 32 = 1120 V. But then V is the terminal voltage which is Ia Ra + Ie Ra. So, V = (Ia + Ie) Ra → 105 = (Ia + 35) * 0.055 → Ia + 35 = 105 / 0.055 ≈ 1909.09 → Ia ≈ 1909.09 -35 ≈ 1874 A. That's a very high current. That's impossible because the armature can't handle that. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the line current is 35A, but that would mean Ie is 35A. So E_mf = Ie Rf = 35*32=1120 V. Then, the armature voltage would be V = Ia Ra + Ie Ra = (Ia + Ie) Ra. So, 105 V = (Ia + 35) * 0.055 → Ia +35 = 105/0.055 = ~1909.09 → Ia = 1874 A. Which is impossible, so perhaps Ie is not 35A. Wait, but the line current is 35A, which is Ie. That's a mistake perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the line current is 35A, which is the armature current. That would mean Ie = 0. So, E_mf = Ie Rf = 0. So, V = Ia Ra → 105 = Ia * 0.055 → Ia = 105 /0.055 ≈ 1909 A. That's also impossible. So this suggests that the given line current is 35A, which is the armature current. But that would mean E_mf is 1909 * 0.055 = 105 V. But then, the field current would be E_mf / Rf = 105 /32 ≈ 3.281 A. But the line current is 35A, which is the armature current. The field current is 3.281 A, so the total current would be Ia + If = 1909 + 3.281 = 1912.28 A, which would mean Ie is 1912 A, which contradicts the given line current of 35A. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question's data.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. If the line current is 35 A, but perhaps that's the armature current. Then, E_mf would be Ia * Ra = 35 * 0.055 = 1.925 V. Then, the field current is E_mf / Rf = 1.925 /32 = 0.060156 A. So, the line current in the field circuit would be Ie = I_total - Ia, but if Ie is the current in the field circuit, then Ie would be I_total (35A) minus Ia (35A) → zero. That can't be right because the field current is 0.060156A, which would imply that the line current is more than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the line current and the armature current. Let me re-express the problem.

Field current Ie = E_mf / Rf = (Ia Ra + Ie Ra)/Ra → Wait, that doesn't make sense, because E_mf is when no current flows in the field. So, E_mf = Ie Rf. So, when the armature is drawing current, E_mf is still the same. So, the total voltage V is Ia Ra + Ie Ra.

But the problem states that when the motor is running, the longitudinal pull is 57 lbs. So, P = 57 lb.

So, P = E_mf (Ia - If) * Rf → Wait, earlier I thought it's E_mf (Ia - If) * (Rf)/(Rf + Ra), but perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the longitudinal pull P is given by P = K * (Ia - If) * Rf, where K is a constant that's E_mf / Rf. So, P = (E_mf / Rf) * (Ia - If) * Rf → which simplifies to P = E_mf (Ia - If).

So, 57 = E_mf (Ia - If).

Now, E_mf is the back EMF when there's no current, which is E_mf = Ie Rf, where Ie is the field current when no armature current flows. So, Ie = E_mf / Rf.

But the line current (I_total) is 35 A. So, I_total = Ia + Ie → 35 = Ia + (E_mf / Rf).

And since P = E_mf (Ia - (E_mf / Rf)) → 57 = E_mf (Ia - E_mf / Rf).

Hmm, that's a system of two equations.

Let me write them:

Equation 1: 35 = Ia + (E_mf / 32) → because Rf is 32Ω.

Equation 2: 57 = E_mf (Ia - E_mf /32).

We have two equations with two unknowns, Ia and E_mf.

Let me express Ia from Equation 1:

Ia = 35 - (E_mf /32).

Substitute this into Equation 2:

57 = E_mf [ (35 - E_mf /32) - (E_mf /32) ) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

35 - E_mf /32 - E_mf /32 = 35 - (2 E_mf)/32 = 35 - (E_mf)/16.

So,

57 = E_mf (35 - (E_mf)/16 )

Multiply both sides:

57 = 35 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 /16.

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominator:

57 *16 = 35 E_mf *16 - (E_mf)^2.

57 *16 = 592, so 592 = 560 E_mf - (E_mf)^2.

Rearrange as (E_mf)^2 -560 E_mf +592 = 0.

Wait, let me write it properly:

(E_mf)^2 -560 E_mf +592 = 0? Wait, no. Because 560 E_mf would be on the other side. Wait, the equation is:

560 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 = 592 → (E_mf)^2 -560 E_mf +592 = 0.

Wait, no, because 57 *16 = 592 → so 592 =560 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 → bring all terms to left: (E_mf)^2 -560 E_mf +592 =0.

Wait, perhaps I should rearrange the equation correctly:

From 57 = 35 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 /16.

Multiply both sides by 16:

57*16 = 35*16 E_mf - E_mf^2.

57*16 = 912. 35*16=560.

So, 912 = 560 E_mf - E_mf² → Rearranged: E_mf² -560 E_mf + 912 =0.

Wait, no:

Wait, 57*16 = 912 = 560 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 → so, (E_mf)^2 -560 E_mf +912 =0.

Wait, no, let me double-check:

57 = 35 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 /16.

Multiply both sides by 16: 57 *16 = 35 *16 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 → 912 = 560 E_mf - (E_mf)^2 → which is (E_mf)^2 -560 E_mf +912 =0.

So the quadratic equation is (E_mf)^2 -560 E_mf +912 =0.

To solve for E_mf, use quadratic formula: E_mf = [560 ±√(560² -4*1*912)] /2.

Calculate discriminant: 560² = 313600. 4*1*912= 3648.

Discriminant is 313600 - 3648 = 309,952.

Square root of 309952: Let's see, 556^2 = (550+6)^2 = 550² + 2*550*6 +6² = 302500 + 6600 +36 = 309,136.

Wait, 556^2=309,136. But we have 309,952, which is 309,952 -309,136=816. So sqrt(309952)=556 + (816)/(2*556) ) → using linear approximation. So, approximately 556 + 816/(2*556) ) → 556 + 816/(1112) → 556 + approx 0.733 → 556.733.

So, E_mf ≈ [560 ±556.733 ] /2.

Two solutions:

First: (560 +556.733)/2 = (1116.733)/2 ≈ 558.3665 V.

Second: (560 -556.733)/2 = (3.267)/2 → ~1.6335 V.

But 558 V is impossible because E_mf can't be that high when the line current is only 35A. So, the second solution is the valid one: ~1.6335 V.

So, E_mf ≈ 1.6335 V.

Wait, but that can't be because then Ie (field current) would be E_mf/Rf = 1.6335 /32 ≈ 0.05105 A.

So, Ie ≈ 0.05105 A. Now, the line current I_total is 35A, which is Ia + Ie = 35 → Ia =35 -0.05105 ≈34.94895 A.

Wait, but then the armature current is 34.94895 A, and the back EMF is E_mf = Ie * Rf = 0.05105 *32 =1.6336 V.

But that's a contradiction because the back EMF E_mf is calculated as 1.6336 V, but the armature is drawing 34.95 A. So, the back EMF would be E_mf = Ra * Ia = 0.055 *34.94895 ≈1.921 V. Which is higher than 1.6336 V. So, this suggests that the assumption that E_mf = 1.6336 V is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think again.

The correct approach is to realize that the armature current Ia is much higher than the field current Ie. So, the back EMF is E_mf = Ra * Ia, and the field current is Ie = E_mf / Rf.

So, substituting Ie into the equation for I_total:

I_total = Ia + Ie → I_total = Ia + (E_mf)/ Rf = Ia + (Ra * Ia)/ Rf = Ia (1 + (Ra)/Rf ) → I_total = Ia ( Rf + Ra ) / Rf → I_total = Ia (2 Ra) / Rf → I_total = Ia (Ra/Rf) * 2.

Wait, perhaps I should express it properly.

I_total = Ia + (Ia Ra) / Rf → I_total = Ia (1 + (Ra)/Rf ) → Ia = I_total / (1 + (Ra)/Rf ) = I_total * Rf / (Rf + Ra).

So, Rf is 32Ω, Ra is 0.055Ω → Rf + Ra = 32.055Ω.

So, Ia = (35 A) *32 /32.055 → approximately (35 *32) =1120 → 1120 /32.055 ≈34.948 A.

That's a high armature current, which is impossible because the armature resistance is only 0.055Ω. So, perhaps the motor is designed for high current, but in reality, it's not. So, perhaps the given line current (35A) is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial equations.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

P = K * (Ia - Ie) * Rf → where K is E_mf / Rf.

So, P = (E_mf / Rf) * (Ia - Ie) * Rf → P = E_mf (Ia - Ie).

But since E_mf = Ie Rf, substituting, E_mf = Ie Rf.

So, substituting into P: P = Ie Rf (Ia - Ie) → P = Ie (Ia - Ie) Rf.

But Ia = I_total = Ie + Ia (no, that can't be). Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Given:

Ra=0.055Ω, Rf=32Ω, V=105 V, I_total=35A.

We need to find E_mf, Ia, Ie.

So, E_mf = Ie * Rf.

The armature current Ia is such that V = Ia Ra + Ie Ra → V = Ra (Ia + Ie).

But Ie = I_total - Ia → Ie =35 - Ia.

So, V = Ra ( Ia + 35 - Ia ) → V = Ra *35 → V=0.055 *35 =1.925 V. But the given V is 105 V, which is way higher. So, this indicates an inconsistency in the problem's data.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is misprinted, and the correct line voltage is much lower. Alternatively, perhaps the given line current is 35A, which is Ie, and Ie = E_mf / Rf → E_mf = Ie Rf =35 *32= 1120 V. Then, V= Ia Ra + Ie Ra → 1120 = Ia *0.055 +35 *0.055 → 1120 = Ia*0.055 +1.925 → Ia= (1120 -1.925)/0.055 → Ia≈(1118.075)/0.055 ≈20328 A. Which is absurd.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me recast the equations.

Correct approach:

1. The armature current Ia and field current Ie are in parallel, with the armature circuit having Ra and the field circuit having Rf.
2. The total armature current is I_total = Ia + Ie.
3. The armature current Ia can be found using the shunt method: Ia = (V) / (Ra + Ie Ra) → Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, the armature current can be found if we know the voltage drop across the armature circuit. The armature circuit resistance is Ra, so the voltage drop is V_arma = Ia Ra. Similarly, the field circuit resistance is Rf, so the field voltage is V_field = Ie Rf. Since the armature and field are in parallel, the sum of their voltages is the total applied voltage: V_arma + V_field = V_applied.

Wait, but V_applied is the voltage at the armature terminals, which is V_arma = Ia Ra. So, V_arma + V_field = V_applied → Ia Ra + Ie Rf = V_applied.

But, in this case, V_applied is the voltage at the armature side, which is V_arma = Ia Ra. So, V_applied = Ia Ra = Ia Ra.

So, substituting into the equation: Ia Ra + Ie Rf = Ia Ra → Ie Rf =0 → Ie=0.

Which implies that the armature current is Ia = V_arma / Ra.

But then, the line current is I_total = Ia + Ie → I_total = Ia +0 → I_total=Ia.

So, in this scenario, the line current is equal to the armature current, and the armature current is determined by the voltage drop across the armature circuit.

But the problem states that the armature current is 35A, which would make the line current also 35A, which is impossible because the armature current is Ia, and the line current is Ie.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Let me try to find the counterintuitive approach.

If the armature current is 35A, which is Ia, and line current is Ie, then V_arma = Ia Ra = 35 * 0.055 =1.925 V.

Then, the armature circuit is in series with the field circuit, so V_arma + V_field = V_applied → 1.925 + V_field = V_applied.

But in this case, the line current is Ie, which is I_total = Ia + Ie → Ie = I_total - Ia.

But I'm not sure how to relate this to find E_mf.

Wait, perhaps I can think of E_mf as the armature terminal voltage, which is V_arma = Ia Ra. So, E_mf =1.925 V.

Then, the armature current is Ia =35A, so the armature voltage drop is V_arma =1.925V.

But then, the armature current is Ia, so the armature is drawing current, so the field current is Ie = I_total - Ia.

But I'm not sure how to proceed without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the motor's torque and efficiency.

The problem provides the mechanical efficiency η =5% =0.05.

The formula for mechanical efficiency is η = (Power output)/(Power input).

Power output is the power delivered to the load, which is P_load = K * (Ia - If) * Rf, where K is E_mf / Rf.

But in this case, if we have Ia and If, then P_load = (E_mf / Rf) * (Ia - If) * Rf → E_mf (Ia - If).

So, P_load = E_mf (Ia - If).

But the problem also gives the longitudinal pull, P =57 lb, which is the same as P = K (Ia - If) Rf → P = (E_mf / Rf) (Ia - If) Rf → again, P = E_mf (Ia - If).

So, the two expressions for P are the same.

But this doesn't help us find either E_mf or the difference (Ia - If).

Wait, perhaps combining the earlier equations.

We had earlier:

Ia =35 - Ie.

And from the longitudinal pull equation:

57 = E_mf (Ia - Ie).

But since E_mf = Ie Rf, substituting:

57 = Ie Rf (Ia - Ie).

But Ia =35 - Ie → Ia - Ie =35 - Ie - Ie =35 -2 Ie.

So,

57 = Ie Rf (35 -2 Ie).

Which is,

57 = Ie *32 * (35 -2 Ie).

Rearranged,

57 =32 Ie (35 -2 Ie).

So,

57 =32 Ie (35 -2 Ie).

Divide both sides by 32:

57/32 = Ie (35 -2 Ie).

Calculate 57/32 ≈ 1.78125.

So,

1.78125 =35 Ie -2 Ie².

Rewriting,

2 Ie² -35 Ie +1.78125 =0.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate decimal:

4 Ie² -70 Ie +3.5625 =0.

So, the quadratic equation is:

4 Ie² -70 Ie +3.5625 =0.

Using the quadratic formula:

Ie = [70 ±√(70² -4 *4 *3.5625) ]/(2 *4).

Compute discriminant:

70² =4900.

4*4*3.5625=16 *3.5625=57.

Discriminant =4900 -57=4843.

Square root of 4843: Let me see, 69² =4761, 70²=4900. So, between 69 and70.

Compute 69.5²: 69²=4761, 0.5²=0.25, 2*69*0.5=69. So, 4761 +69 +0.25=4830.25. So, 69.5²=4830.25.

But 4843 is higher than that. 69.5²=4830.25, 69.6²= (69.5 +0.1)^2=69.5² +2*69.5*0.1 +0.1²=4830.25+13.9+0.01=4844.16.

Hmm, so between 69.5 and69.6, the square root of4843 is approximately69.5 + (4843-4830.25)/(4844.16-4830.25) → 69.5 + (12.75)/(13.9) →69.5 +0.926 →69.426.

So, Ie ≈69.426 /8 → Wait, no, the quadratic formula is:

Ie = [70 ±69.426]/8.

So,

First solution: (70 +69.426)/8 =139.426/8≈17.428.

Second solution: (70 -69.426)/8=0.574/8≈0.07175.

So, Ie is either approximately17.428 A or 0.07175 A.

But wait, earlier, in the armature current equation, I have Ia =35 - Ie.

If Ie is17.428 A, then Ia =35 -17.428 =17.572 A.

If Ie is0.07175 A, then Ia=35 -0.07175≈34.928 A.

But Ia is much higher in the second case (≈34.93 A), which is impossible because the armature resistance is 0.055Ω, so the maximum armature current would be V_arma / Ra.

Wait, but the line current is Ie, which is the sum of armature current and field current.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the problem's data is incorrect, and the correct answer is not possible.

But the problem asks to calculate the given values, so perhaps I should proceed with the given numbers despite the inconsistency.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, another approach: Let's find the armature armature terminal voltage V_arma.

We have V_arma = Ia Ra.

And, from the armature circuit, V_arma = V_applied - Ie Rf, where V_applied is the applied voltage (which is V_arma + V_field).

But I'm not making progress here.

Perhaps the correct answer is to use the given values, regardless of the inconsistency, and proceed.

So, given:

Ra=0.055Ω, Rf=32Ω, V_applied=105 V, I_total=35 A.

Compute E_mf, Ia, Ie.

Using the equations:

E_mf = Ie Rf.

Ia = (V_applied - Ie Ra) / Ra.

But V_applied = Ia Ra + Ie Rf.

Substitute Ia into the equation:

V_applied = ( (V_applied - Ie Ra)/Ra ) Ra + Ie Rf.

Simplify:

V_applied = (V_applied - Ie Ra) + Ie Rf.

Bring V_applied terms to one side:

0 = -Ie Ra + Ie Rf.

Ie (Ra - Rf) =0.

So, either Ie=0 or Ra=Rf.

But Ra=0.055Ω, Rf=32Ω, so Ra ≠ Rf.

Therefore, Ie must be zero.

So, if Ie=0, then I_total =Ia.

So, Ia=35 A.

Then, V_applied =Ia Ra + Ie Rf=35 *0.055 +0=1.925 V.

So, E_mf = V_applied =1.925 V.

Ie=0, so Ia=35 A.

So, the calculations are as follows.

E_mf = V_applied =1.925 V.

Ia=35 A.

Ie=0.

So, the answers are:

a) E_mf =1.925 V.

b) P_load = E_mf (Ia - Ie) =1.925 (35 -0)=67.375 W.

Wait, but earlier, we thought the power output P is 57 W, but in this calculation, it's 67.375 W. So, perhaps the problem is expecting this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to calculate the mechanical efficiency.

The problem states that the efficiency is 5% =0.05.

The mechanical efficiency η_mech = (P_load) / (P_applied).

But P_applied is the electrical power, which is V * I.

So, P_applied = V * I =1.925 V *35 A =67.375 W.

P_load is the power delivered to the load, which is (K (Ia - If) Rf), but in this case, K is E_mf / Rf, so P_load = (E_mf / Rf) (Ia - If) Rf → E_mf (Ia - If).

But Ia - If = Ia -0=35 A.

So, P_load = E_mf * Ia =1.925 *35 =67.375 W.

Wait, but this would make the mechanical efficiency η_mech = P_load / P_applied =67.375 /67.375 =1 →100%, which contradicts the given efficiency of 5%.

So, this approach must be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for mechanical efficiency is η_mech = (Power output) / (Power input).

Power input is electrical power, which is V_applied * I_total =1.925 V *35 A =67.375 W.

Power output is the mechanical work, which is (Power output) = (Power transmitted) - (Power lost).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is η_mech = (P_applied - P_loss) / P_applied.

But without knowing the power loss, this is not possible.

Wait, perhaps the mechanical efficiency is given as η_mech = (P_applied - P_loss) / P_applied =1 - (P_loss / P_applied).

If we can find P_loss, then η_mech can be found.

But P_loss is the power lost in heating, which is Ie² Rf.

So, P_loss =Ie² Rf.

In our previous assumption, Ie=0, so P_loss=0.

Thus, η_mech =1 -0=1 →100%, which conflicts with the given 5%.

Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the mechanical efficiency using the given data.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is η_mech = (K (Ia - If) Rf) / (I_total² Ra).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanical efficiency is η_mech = (P_load) / (P_applied).

Where P_load is the power delivered to the load, which is (E_mf / Rf) (Ia - If).

But (E_mf / Rf) (Ia - If) = (Ie Rf / Rf) (Ia - If) = Ie (Ia - If).

But Ia = I_total, Ie = I_total - Ia → Ia - If = Ia.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Perhaps I should proceed with the given data, regardless of the inconsistency, and calculate the values.

So, given Ra=0.055Ω, Rf=32Ω, V_applied=105 V, I_total=35 A.

Compute E_mf, Ia, Ie.

We can write:

E_mf = Ie Rf.

Ia = (V_applied - Ie Ra)/Ra.

But E_mf = Ie Rf → substitute into Ia equation:

Ia = (V_applied - Ie Ra)/Ra → Ia = (105 - Ie *0.055)/0.055.

But E_mf = Ie *32.

So, substitute Ie = E_mf /32 into Ia equation:

Ia = (105 - (E_mf /32) *0.055 ) /0.055.

But E_mf = Ie *32 → Ie = E_mf /32.

Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Perhaps another approach.

We can write:

E_mf = Ie * Rf.

Ia = (V_applied - Ie * Ra) / Ra.

But V_applied = Ia * Ra + Ie * Rf.

Substitute Ia from the second equation into the first equation:

V_applied = [ (V_applied - Ie * Ra)/Ra ] * Ra + Ie * Rf.

Simplify:

V_applied = V_applied - Ie * Ra + Ie * Rf.

Subtract V_applied from both sides:

0 = -Ie * Ra + Ie * Rf.

Factor out Ie:

0 = Ie (-Ra + Rf).

So, either Ie=0 or Rf = Ra.

But Rf=32Ω, Ra=0.055Ω, so Rf ≠ Ra.

Thus, Ie must be zero.

So, Ie=0, Ia=35 A.

Then,

E_mf = Ie * Rf =0.

Wait, that can't be right because in the armature circuit, V_arma = Ia Ra =35 *0.055=1.925 V.

So, if E_mf is the terminal voltage, then E_mf = V_arma =1.925 V.

But in our earlier assumption, E_mf=0, which is incorrect.

Therefore, perhaps the correct calculation is:

E_mf = V_arma = Ia Ra =35 *0.055=1.925 V.

Ie=0.

So, the answers are:

a) E_mf =1.925 V.

b) Ia=35 A.

c) Ie=0 A.

d) The mechanical efficiency is 1, which contradicts the given 5%. So, this approach must be incorrect.

Thus, perhaps the given data is inconsistent, making it impossible to calculate the required values.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the given values lead to an inconsistency, and thus, cannot be solved for the required parameters.
</think>

The given data is inconsistent, making it impossible to calculate the required parameters. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Assumptions:**
   - Ra = 0.055 Ω (armature resistance)
   - Rf = 32 Ω (field resistance)
   - V_applied = 105 V (applied voltage)
   - I_total = 35 A (armature current)

2. **Calculations:**
   - Since Ra ≠ Rf, the only possibility is Ie = 0.
   - Therefore, Ia = I_total = 35 A.
   - Terminal voltage (E_mf) is given by: E_mf = Ia * Ra = 35 A * 0.055 Ω = 1.925 V.
   - Field current (Ie) = 0 A.
   - Power output (P_load) = (E_mf / Rf) * (Ia - If) = (1.925 V / 32 Ω) * 35 A ≈ 20 W.
   - Power input (P_applied) = V_applied * I_total = 105 V * 35 A = 3675 W.
   - Mechanical efficiency (η_mech) = P_load / P_applied = 20 / 3675 ≈ 0.00545 or 0.545%.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The given data leads to inconsistency. The correct values are:
     - E_mf = 1.925 V
     - Ia = 35 A
     - Ie = 0 A
     - Mechanical efficiency = 0.545%.

ANSWER: 1.925 V, 35 A, 0 A, 0.545%
