Alright, so I have this question about Mrs. Bracken's filing status and the number of exemptions she's allowed. Let me try to break it down.

First, the question states that Mrs. Bracken is a widow who has a home for herself, her dependent father, and her two children. I know that widows are considered a qualifying widow in some tax situations, especially if they have children, because they can claim certain exemptions.

For part (a), the options are about her filing status. The options include things like Single, Married Filing Jointly, etc. I remember that widows who have children are often married and file jointly, or they might file separately. But since the question specifies a widow, I think a qualifying widow status makes sense here. Qualifying widows are allowed to claim certain exemptions, like the dependent child exemption and the dependent parent exemption if applicable.

Moving to part (b), the number of exemptions. Exemptions are either qualifying or non-qualifying. The dependent parent exemption is a qualifying exemption, but it's for a qualifying widow, I think. The dependent child exemption is a non-qualifying exemption, which is allowed for widows regardless of their filing status. So, how many does she get?

She has her dependent father and her two children. So, the dependent parent exemption is one. For children, there are two, each claiming a dependent child exemption. That's two more. So that's three exemptions total.

Wait, but I should also consider if she's married. If she's married, she can file jointly, but that doesn't change the number of exemptions. She's a widow, so the qualifying widow status applies, but the number of exemptions is based on her dependents, which are two children and her dependent father. The dependent parent exemption is one, and the two children each have their own dependent child exemption. So that's three exemptions in total.

Looking at the options, option B says Qualifying widow(er), three exemptions. That seems to fit because a widow has the dependent parent exemption (one) and two dependent children (each with their own exemption). So that's three total.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Are the dependent parent and dependent child exemptions both allowed for widows? Yes, I think so. The dependent parent exemption applies to widows, and the dependent child exemption is a non-qualifying exemption for widows as well.

So the answer should be option B: Qualifying widow(er), three exemptions.

The correct answer is B: Qualifying widow(er), three exemptions. 

- Mrs. Bracken, being a widow with children, qualifies as a qualifying widow. She is allowed to claim the dependent parent exemption (one) and each of her two dependent children as dependent child exemptions (two), totaling three exemptions. 

Answer: B
