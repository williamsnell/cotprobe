Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about economics. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is: "Suppose real GDP increases. We can conclude without a doubt that..." and then there are several options provided.

First, I need to understand what real GDP is. Real GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given period of time, measured in current dollars. It's adjusted for inflation, so it reflects the actual quantity of goods produced. So if real GDP increases, that means the economy is producing more stuff, right?

Now, the question is asking which conclusion we can definitively make about the situation when real GDP increases. Let's look at each option.

Option A: The average wage is higher. Hmm, real GDP growth doesn't necessarily mean higher wages. It could be due to increased production without wage increases, or maybe higher productivity. So without more context, we can't say for sure that wages have gone up just because GDP is growing. So A might not be correct.

Option B: The national debt is lower. No, that's not related. National debt is a separate issue. The economy's growth doesn't directly affect the national debt. So B is out.

Option C: Production is higher. Well, real GDP is the measure of total production, so if real GDP increases, production must have gone up. That makes sense. So C seems correct.

Option D: Prices are higher. That's about inflation. Real GDP growth can happen without prices rising. For example, if there's inflation, prices go up, but GDP growth could still happen. So without knowing about the price level, we can't say prices are higher. So D is not necessarily true.

Option E: Employment is higher. Again, GDP growth could be due to more production without more people employed. So unless there are other factors, employment might not increase. So E isn't guaranteed.

Option F: The stock market is higher. The stock market is related to corporate earnings and investor sentiment, which can be tied to economic growth, but it's not the same as real GDP growth. So F isn't necessarily true.

Option G: The trade deficit is lower. The trade deficit is about exports vs imports. GDP growth doesn't directly relate to this. So G is not correct.

Option H: Inflation is lower. Like I mentioned earlier, real GDP growth doesn't mean lower prices. Inflation can occur alongside GDP growth, so H isn't necessarily true.

Option I: Interest rates are higher. Higher interest rates can cause inflation or lower GDP growth. So unless we have more information, we can't conclude interest rates have gone up just because GDP is growing. So I isn't correct.

Option J: Not sure if this is an option. Let me check. Oh, the options go up to J, but the last option is J, but in this case, the listed options go up to G and H, I think. Wait, the options are A to I, so J isn't listed. So if I don't see it, maybe I missed it.

Wait, the options are up to H, I think. So back to the options. So the only one that seems certain is C. Production is higher because real GDP measures the total production.

Wait, but I need to make sure. Could there be a situation where real GDP increases but production is lower? Like, maybe companies are hiring more workers or workers are leaving or something. No, real GDP is the total value of production, so if it increases, production, which is the total output, would have to increase. So yes, production must be higher.

So the correct answer must be C. I should select option C.

The correct answer is C: production is higher. 

Here's the reasoning:

- Real GDP increases indicate that the total value of goods and services produced has risen.
- Real GDP growth is a measure of total production, so any increase in real GDP suggests that production has increased.
- Other options either relate to unrelated economic concepts (e.g., wages, debt, inflation, interest rates) or are not necessarily tied to GDP growth.

ANSWER: C
