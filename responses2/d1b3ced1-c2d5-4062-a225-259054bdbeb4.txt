Question:

A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder
B: Social anxiety disorder
C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder
D: Adjustment disorder
E: Post-traumatic stress disorder
F: Hypothyroidism
G: Panic disorder
H: Agoraphobia
I: Specific phobia
J: Acute stress disorder

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient's medical history and the possible diagnosis. Let me try to walk through it step by step.

First, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 2-week history of anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. She was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot three weeks ago. She's cooperative but anxious, glancing quickly when a loud noise is heard. She uses levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and an over-the-counter inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80, which is a bit high, and her pulse is 100/min, which is a normal resting pulse, so maybe not high. The exam shows dry skin and hair, which is a bit odd but maybe a sign of something else.

Her Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm³, which is a bit low because normal is usually around 10-20, but she's 12k, so maybe something like infection or inflammation. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 5.0 μU/mL. Wait, I remember that normal TSH levels for adults are about 0.4-3.5 μU/mL. So 5 is quite high, which might indicate hypothyroidism. But the question already states she takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, so maybe she's on it.

The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is a fast, irregular heartbeat. Sinus tachycardia often points to sinusitis, but sometimes it can be due to thyroid issues. Hypothyroidism can cause sinus hyperactivity because it affects the heart's function. So I'm thinking maybe she's hypothyroidism, but let's check other clues.

Her blood pressure is elevated, which is concerning. High blood pressure can be a sign of various conditions, including thyroid issues, but it's also a sign of hypertension. Her pulse is normal, so it's not high. Her heart rate is normal, so it's not too fast or slow.

Looking at the options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder. This is a mental health condition, not directly related to the physical exam. But her anxiety is a symptom, not the diagnosis.

B: Social anxiety disorder. Again, related to mental health, not physical exam findings. So probably not.

C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. This involves obsessions and compulsions, which aren't mentioned here.

D: Adjustment disorder. Also a mental health condition, not physical exam findings.

E: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This would affect the physical and mental state post trauma, but the question doesn't mention trauma, so maybe not.

F: Hypothyroidism. The TSH is high, which is a direct sign.

G: Panic disorder. Panic disorder involves fear of loud noises, which she's showing. But she also has anxiety, which is part of generalized anxiety. She's cooperative, so maybe panic disorder is more about behavior than actual anxiety.

H: Agoraphobia. This is fear of being in a situation where you might lose control, but she's cooperative. So less likely.

I: Specific phobia. Similar to agoraphobia; she's cooperative, so probably not.

J: Acute stress disorder. This is a mental health condition, so not directly the diagnosis here.

So the most likely is F: Hypothyroidism. Her TSH is high, which points to that. The ECG showing sinus issues could tie in, but the high TSH is the key.

The patient presents with a history of anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as a robbery incident. Her physical exam findings include dry skin, which is unusual. The Leukocyte count is elevated (12,000/mm³), and the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is high (5.0 μU/mL), indicating possible hypothyroidism. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is typically associated with hypothyroidism. While other conditions like social anxiety or agoraphobia could involve anxiety, the high TSH and elevated blood pressure are more consistent with hypothyroidism. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is F: Hypothyroidism.

Answer: F
