Okay, so I have this question about choosing between aluminum and copper alloy fins based on economy considerations. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, I need to understand the data provided. The question says that the cost of aluminum is twice that of copper. So, if something is cheaper, it's likely to be cheaper in larger quantities.

Next, the materials are compared based on two factors: conductivity and cost. Conductivity is measured in kCal per minute-hour degree Celsius. Wait, let's parse that correctly. Oh, right, conductivity here is how well the material conducts heat. Higher conductivity means better heat transfer. So, aluminum has a lower conductivity than copper. Aluminum is 78, copper is 190. So copper is better at conducting heat.

Wait, that's a bit counterintuitive because in many applications, aluminum is used for its thermal properties. Like in air conditioning systems. But then, the cost consideration is that aluminum is twice as expensive as copper. So, even though copper is better at conducting, the cost could be a factor.

The question is about the fins. Fins are attached to surfaces and help increase heat transfer. So, if we have to choose between two materials for fins, we need to think about which one is more efficient in terms of heat transfer and which is cheaper.

Wait, but the question says "using either aluminum or copper as the fin material." So, which one is better for each application, and which is cheaper.

The options suggest which is used for which applications. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Copper for core, aluminum as decorative. So the core is copper, which has better conductivity. But is the cost a factor? Since aluminum is more expensive, maybe in terms of cost, copper is cheaper. But maybe the fin's conductivity is lower, so less heat transfer. Hmm, but the question is about economy, so maybe the cost of the fin matters more than the conductivity? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the optimal choice depends on both factors.

Option B: Aluminum for low temp, copper for high temp. That makes sense because aluminum is better at high temperatures and copper at low. If the application requires high temp, aluminum is better. But again, the cost is a factor. Since aluminum is twice as expensive, maybe if the application requires high temp, copper is used even though it's less conductive. Because maybe the cost is a significant factor.

Option C: Just copper. Well, if the application requires a lower cost, maybe copper would be cheaper, but if you need high conductivity, copper isn't the best. So perhaps a composite or a mixture is needed.

Option D: Use aluminum but increase its thickness to match copper. That would make the aluminum equivalent in both conductivity and cost. Because if you double the thickness, you double the volume, so twice the mass. But since aluminum costs twice as much as copper, doubling the thickness would mean the cost remains the same as copper. So, for example, if copper is 100 kg, aluminum would be 200 kg. If you double the aluminum's thickness, 200 kg * 2 thickness = 400 kg. But copper has 100 kg. So 400 kg aluminum versus 100 kg copper. The cost would be 400 * 2 = 800, copper is 100. So 800 is more than 100, so that's not a good idea. Hmm, maybe that's not the optimal approach.

Option E: Composite material. That makes sense if you need materials with both conductivity and cost considerations. A composite might offer both, maybe at a better cost than pure materials. For example, using a mixture of both. So that could balance the cost and conductivity.

Option F: Equal amounts. That would be a mix, but I'm not sure if that's optimal. Maybe a 50-50 mix, but if you need better conductivity, perhaps more copper.

Option G: Copper with aluminum coating. That would have higher conductivity because aluminum is a better conductor than copper. But the cost would depend on the cost of the coating. If the coating is expensive, maybe it's not worth it. Also, the cost of the aluminum coating may be lower than the cost of adding more aluminum to copper. So, perhaps the cost is a consideration here.

Option H: Alternating layers. That might mean a material that's a mix of both, allowing for better conductivity but not necessarily more expensive. This sounds like a composite material, which I think is option E.

Option I: Neither alloy. That's probably not the case because both have their uses.

Option J: Use aluminum. But considering cost, if it's more expensive, maybe not.

So the question is about using either, so the answer is likely a composite or a mixture of the two materials.

Looking again at the options, E is a composite, which is a good option. But let me think more carefully.

The cost of aluminum is twice that of copper. So, if you make a composite, you might get a cost-effective material. For example, if you make 50% aluminum and 50% copper, the cost would be (0.5*2 + 0.5*1) per unit volume. Wait, 0.5 * cost of aluminum is 0.5 * 2 = 1, plus 0.5 * 1 = 0.5. So total is 1.5. So the composite's cost is 1.5 times the cost of copper. But if the composite is cheaper than either material, that's better.

Another way: if you use a mix, the cost per unit volume is (0.5 * 2) + (0.5 *1) = 1.5. So the cost is 1.5 times copper, but 1.5 times less than aluminum (which is 2). So the composite is more cost-effective than either. Because 1.5 is cheaper than 2, which is cheaper than 1. So, the composite would be better.

So, option E: a composite that blends both materials.

But wait, another option is that the composite is made by using more of the cheaper material. For example, if the composite uses a higher proportion of copper, which is cheaper, but perhaps it's not better. Wait, but the composite would have a cost that's a weighted average. For a 50-50 mix, as I calculated, it's 1.5, which is cheaper than copper (1) but more expensive than aluminum (2). So the composite is a better deal than either.

So the optimal choice is a composite, which is option E.

Wait, looking back at the options, E is "a composite material that blends both aluminium and copper alloys." So that would be the correct answer.

The question involves selecting between aluminum and copper alloy fins based on cost and thermal conductivity, with aluminum being twice as expensive as copper. Conductivity is measured in kCal per minute-hour degree Celsius, with copper offering better heat transfer (190 kCal) compared to aluminum (78 kCal). The goal is to determine the most cost-effective and thermally efficient option.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Copper for the core, aluminum decorative. Copper's lower conductivity is advantageous, but the cost factor (aluminum is twice as expensive) could outweigh the savings from higher temperature handling. This might not be optimal.
2. **Option B**: Aluminum for low-temperature applications, copper for high-temperature. This aligns with the materials' strengths, but the cost disparity could make high-temperature applications less economical.
3. **Option C**: Just copper. While copper is more conductive, the cost of copper might make it less economical compared to a composite material.
4. **Option D**: Aluminum with increased thickness to match copper's performance. Doubling aluminum's thickness would maintain its cost but could lead to lower overall thermal conductivity, making it less efficient.
5. **Option E**: A composite material blending both alloys. This is a balanced approach, leveraging the strengths of both materials and the cost efficiency of a composite. The composite's cost is a weighted average of both materials, making it the most economical choice.
6. **Option F**: Equal amounts of both alloys. While equal amounts could balance costs and conductivities, a composite is generally more efficient.
7. **Option G**: Copper with aluminum coating. While aluminum is a better conductor, the cost of a coating may offset its benefits, making the composite more economical.
8. **Option H**: Alternating layers. This could be a composite material, but it might not offer the same efficiency as a well-blended composite.
9. **Option I**: Neither alloy. This is unlikely as both materials have their specific uses.
10. **Option J**: Use aluminum. However, aluminum is too costly compared to copper, making it impractical.

### Conclusion:
The optimal choice is a composite material (Option E) as it balances cost and thermal efficiency, leveraging the strengths of both aluminum and copper while addressing the cost disparity.
