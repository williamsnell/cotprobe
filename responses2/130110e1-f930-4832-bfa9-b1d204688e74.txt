Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry can get a bit tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding out how many liters of phosphine (PH3) gas can be made from 30 grams of calcium using the given reactions. They provided some molecular weights: calcium (Ca) is 40 g/mol, and phosphine (PH3) is 34 g/mol.

Wait, the reactions given are:
1. 3Ca + 2P → Ca3P2
2. Ca3P2 + 6HCl → 2PH3 + 3CaCl2

And the options are various liters of PH3 at STP. Oh right, STP is Standard Temperature and Pressure, which is 0°C and 1 atm, and at this condition, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.

So the steps I need to take are probably:

1. Determine the moles of calcium given.
2. Figure out how much Ca3P2 is produced from the calcium.
3. Then, see how much phosphine is made from Ca3P2.
4. Convert the moles of phosphine to liters using the 22.4 L/mol value.

Let's start with the first step: moles of calcium.

Given 30 grams of Ca. Molecular weight is 40 g/mol, so moles = mass / molar mass. So 30 /40 = 0.75 moles of Ca.

But the first reaction is 3Ca + 2P → Ca3P2.

Wait, so this is a mole ratio. The question is, how much Ca3P2 is produced when 0.75 moles of Ca reacts? The stoichiometric ratio here is 3 Ca → 1 Ca3P2.

So, the moles of Ca3P2 produced would be (0.75 mol Ca) * (1 mol Ca3P2 / 3 mol Ca) ) = 0.25 mol Ca3P2.

Wait, because the stoichiometric coefficients are 3:1. So for every 3 moles of Ca, 1 mole of Ca3P2 is produced.

So, the Ca is 0.75 moles, so Ca3P2 is 0.75 /3 = 0.25 moles.

Now, the second reaction: Ca3P2 + 6HCl → 2PH3 + 3CaCl2.

We need to find out how much Ca3P2 is consumed to produce how much PH3.

The stoichiometric ratio here is 1 mole Ca3P2 → 2 moles PH3.

So, 0.25 moles Ca3P2 will produce 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 moles of PH3.

Wait, let's make sure. So for every mole of Ca3P2, you get two moles of PH3. So 0.25 *2 = 0.5 mol.

Now, we have 0.5 moles of PH3. But wait, the question is about liters at STP. So each mole is 22.4 L.

So, 0.5 * 22.4 = 11.2 liters.

Wait, but let me check if I missed anything. The first reaction produces Ca3P2, which is then consumed in the second reaction. So all the Ca3P2 from the first reaction would be used up, right? Or is there any excess?

Wait, the question says "how many liters of PH3 gas could be made from 30 g of calcium". So I think the idea is that all the calcium is consumed, so the Ca3P2 produced is used up in making PH3. So yes, 0.25 mol Ca3P2 → 0.5 mol PH3.

Wait, the options are: A is 11.2, which would be the answer if I'm right.

But wait, let me think again. Another possibility is that the calcium isn't the limiting reagent. Are there any other reactants? The problem says "use of the following sequence of reactions", but only mentions Ca and HCl. So I assume Ca is the only reactant besides HCl.

So, the Ca is the limiting reagent, determined by the other reactants being in excess. But the problem states 30 g Ca, but no info about P or HCl. But in the first reaction, the Ca is the limiting factor.

So all the Ca is used up, and the Ca3P2 is fully consumed in the second step.

So 0.5 mol PH3 → 0.5 *22.4=11.2 L. Looking at the options, option A is 11.2 l.

Wait, but looking at the options: option A is 11.2, so that's the answer.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations.

30g Ca: 30/40 = 0.75 moles.

Reaction 1: 3Ca → 1 Ca3P2. So 0.75 /3 = 0.25 Ca3P2.

Reaction 2: Ca3P2 +6 HCl → 2 PH3 +3 CaCl2.

So 1 mole Ca3P2 → 2 moles PH3. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 moles PH3.

At STP, 0.5 *22.4=11.2 L. So option A.

To determine how many liters of phosphine (PH₃) gas could be made from 30 g of calcium (Ca) at STP, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of Ca**:  
   The molecular weight of Ca is 40 g/mol.  
   Moles of Ca = \( \frac{30 \, \text{g}}{40 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.75 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of Ca₃P₂ produced**:  
   From the first reaction, \( 3 \, \text{Ca} \rightarrow \text{Ca₃P₂} \), the stoichiometric ratio is \( 3 \, \text{mol Ca} \rightarrow 1 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂} \).  
   Moles of Ca₃P₂ produced = \( 0.75 \, \text{mol Ca} \times \frac{1 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂}}{3 \, \text{mol Ca}} = 0.25 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂} \).

3. **Determine moles of PH₃ produced**:  
   From the second reaction, \( \text{Ca₃P₂} + 6 \, \text{HCl} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{PH₃} + 3 \, \text{CaCl₂} \), the stoichiometric ratio is \( 1 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{mol PH₃} \).  
   Moles of PH₃ produced = \( 0.25 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂} \times \frac{2 \, \text{mol PH₃}}{1 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂}} = 0.5 \, \text{mol PH₃} \).

4. **Convert moles of PH₃ to liters at STP**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.  
   Volume of PH₃ = \( 0.5 \, \text{mol} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 11.2 \, \text{L} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **11.2 liters**.
