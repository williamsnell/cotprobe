Alright, so I've got this law question about-arrests without a warrant. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the options is not a circumstance where an officer may arrest without a warrant. So the options are A to J, and I need to pick the one that's not a valid reason.

I remember that in most jurisdictions, arrest without a warrant is legal under certain conditions. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says an officer may arrest for a misdemeanor not a breach of peace committed out of arresting party's presence. Wait, isn't that a standard reason for a warrantless arrest? Like, if it's a misdemeanor under arrest, they can go directly to the arrest without a warrant. So A is a valid reason, so it's not the answer.

Option B states an officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it. Hmm, that rings a bell. I think that's part of the criminal procedure. Like, if someone has a felony, they need to have probable cause (maybe a warrant or a specific situation) before arresting them. So B is a valid reason, so it's not the answer.

Option C says an officer may arrest a misdemeanor committed in their presence without any evidence. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If the person is in the officer's presence, why would the officer arrest unless there's some evidence? Like, maybe the officer can't use a warrant because they're in the presence. So without evidence, they can't use a warrant. So C seems like a correct situation why you might not use a warrant. So C is a valid reason, not the answer.

Option D: Officer may arrest if suspect is suspected of a misdemeanor that hasn't occurred yet. That makes sense. Like, if someone's not proven guilty yet, the officer can arrest them without a warrant. So D is correct, so not the answer.

Option E: Officer may arrest if they've committed a felony regardless of presence. Wait, can you arrest someone for a felony if they're not with you? I thought that was a problem. Like, if they're not present, perhaps the police can't use a warrant. So E might be the correct answer here, because if the person is present or not, if you're arresting someone for a felony, you can't use a warrant. So E is not a reason why you can't use a warrant.

Option F: Officer may arrest if suspect has a felony in the future. Hmm, does that require a warrant? I think that's more about a consent or a belief, but if the suspect is suspected of a future felony, the police can arrest them without a warrant. So F is a valid reason, so not the answer.

Option G: A misdemeanor has occurred, and the officer must believe it was committed. So if the misdemeanor has happened, but the officer doesn't believe it's theirs, can they arrest without a warrant? I'm not entirely sure. Wait, do they have to believe it's theirs for a warrantless arrest? Or is there another way? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Maybe the belief is part of the criminal procedure, but if the misdemeanor has occurred, but the officer's belief isn't supported, maybe it's not a valid reason to not use a warrant. Or wait, does the officer need to have probable cause? If the misdemeanor has occurred, but the officer doesn't believe it's theirs, perhaps they can't use a warrant, but wait, in the scenario, the officer is arrested without a warrant, which would be a criminal procedure, but if the misdemeanor has occurred but the officer's belief is incorrect, do they have to wait for a warrant? I'm not too sure. I'll come back to this one.

Option H: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that's a breach of peace committed in arresting party's presence. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Breach of peace usually refers to a specific situation, like a Burglary where the property was taken, or a felony. If you're arresting someone for a misdemeanor already committed, can you do it without a warrant? I think if it's a felony, you can't use a warrant, but if it's a misdemeanor, perhaps you can. But H says a misdemeanor committed in their presence. So if the officer is arresting someone who's already in the misdemeanor, can they do it without a warrant? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a valid reason, so H is a correct reason, so not the answer.

Option I: Officer may arrest based on a tip from an unverified source. Yes, tips are a valid reason. So I is a correct reason, so not the answer.

Option J: Officer may arrest for a felony committed in their presence. That's tricky. Because if the person is in the presence of the felony, can the police arrest them without a warrant? I think if the felony is committed in their presence, but the officer doesn't have a warrant, they can't use a warrant. So J is a correct reason, so not the answer.

So to recap, the options that are correct (can use a warrant) are A, B, C, D, E, F, G is the one that's not correct, and I, J are correct reasons.

Wait, but let me double-check option G. The statement says: "An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it." Hmm, wait, that seems contradictory. If the officer is arresting someone who has already occurred, but the officer must believe he did it. Does the belief of the officer being the guilty party affect whether a warrant is needed? Or is the belief about the crime happening regardless? Because in criminal procedure, the belief is part of the criminal procedure, not necessarily a warrant. So if the misdemeanor has occurred, and the officer can't use a warrant, then option G is valid. But wait, if the misdemeanor has occurred, and the officer is arresting someone without a warrant, that's a criminal procedure. But does the belief that the person is guilty affect the use of a warrant? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the officer must have probable cause, which is the belief, for the arrest. But if the misdemeanor has occurred, perhaps the officer can still use a warrant because the crime is already committed. Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: In criminal procedure, when a person is arrested without a warrant for a misdemeanor that has occurred, the officer must have probable cause. So probable cause can be a warrant or another situation. But if the misdemeanor has already occurred, does that mean the officer doesn't need to have a warrant? Or is the occurrence of the crime the reason for the warrantless arrest?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. But looking back, the question is asking which is NOT a circumstance. So from what I recall, I think that for a misdemeanor that has occurred, the officer may use a warrant if the crime was committed out of the police's presence, but if it's already occurred, the officer can use a warrant if they have probable cause.

Wait, but in some cases, if the crime has already occurred, but the officer doesn't have a warrant, they can't use one. So that would make option G a correct reason, so G is valid, so it's not the answer.

Wait, no. Option G says: "A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it." So if the officer is arresting someone who has already committed a misdemeanor (like a felony), because it's a misdemeanor, perhaps the officer can use a warrant because it's a misdemeanor, but that's not the case. Alternatively, if the misdemeanor was committed, but the officer is arresting someone else, but the original crime has already occurred, perhaps the officer can't use a warrant for the arrest.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the criminal procedure steps. If the crime has occurred, but the officer is arresting someone else, perhaps they can't use a warrant unless there's a valid reason. For example, if a misdemeanor has occurred and the officer is arresting someone else, but the crime was already committed, then the officer can't use a warrant, because the crime has already happened. So that would mean that the officer must have probable cause for the arrest. But in option G, the officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it, which would mean he is either innocent or guilty. If he's guilty, then the crime has already occurred, so he can't use a warrant. So I'm not sure if option G is correct.

Alternatively, maybe option G is not a correct reason. Because if the misdemeanor has occurred, but the officer is arresting someone else, perhaps the officer must have a warrant because the crime has already happened. So in that case, G is not a valid reason for not using a warrant.

Wait, but the question is about the circumstances under which arrest can be done without a warrant. So in that case, if the crime has occurred, but the officer is arresting someone else, then he can't use a warrant because the crime was already committed. So G would be a valid reason.

Wait, but if the officer is arresting someone for a misdemeanor that has occurred, but the person is not the one who committed it, then the officer can't use a warrant because the crime has occurred. So in that scenario, the officer has to have a warrant. But if the person is the one who committed the crime, then perhaps he can be arrested without a warrant.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the rule about arresting for a misdemeanor that has occurred without a warrant. I think that for a misdemeanor that's already committed, you can't use a warrant for an arrest. So if the officer is arresting someone else, even though the crime has occurred, the officer can't use a warrant. So in that case, if the officer is arresting someone who is the actual perpetrator, then he can't use a warrant because the crime has already occurred. But if he's arresting someone else, perhaps he can.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of the actual criminal procedure. For a misdemeanor that's already occurred, the officer must have a warrant. So if the officer is arresting someone else, and the crime has occurred, then he can't use a warrant. So if the person being arrested is suspect of a crime that has already occurred, then he can't use a warrant. So in that case, the officer can't arrest without a warrant, making option G a valid reason.

Alternatively, if the officer is arresting someone else for a misdemeanor that has occurred, and he has probable cause that the person is guilty, then maybe he can use a warrant, but if he can't, then he must have one.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But according to what I remember, arrest without a warrant is a criminal procedure. So, for a misdemeanor that's already occurred, the officer can't use a warrant unless he has probable cause. So if someone is being arrested for a misdemeanor that has occurred, but the officer doesn't have a warrant, he can't do it. So that would make option G a correct reason, so it's not the answer.

Wait, but the question is which is not one of the circumstances. So the answer would be the one that's not a valid reason. So looking back, which option is not a reason? The options are A through J.

Wait, I think I might have confused the options. Let me see:

Option G: "A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it." Hmm, perhaps the belief is part of the criminal procedure, but doesn't necessarily mean that a warrant is required. So the officer can choose to arrest for a misdemeanor that has occurred without a warrant if there's no belief. So G is a valid reason, so it's not the answer.

Wait, but maybe the officer must have a warrant if the person is believed to have committed the crime, even if the crime is already committed. Or perhaps the belief is irrelevant because the crime has already occurred. So I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is which is not a circumstance. So the correct answer is the one that cannot be a reason for arrest without a warrant.

So, if the officer is arresting someone for a misdemeanor that has occurred, and the officer can't use a warrant, then that's a valid reason, making G correct. So G is a valid reason.

Wait, but the question is, which is NOT a circumstance. So the correct answer is the one that's not a reason. So the one that's not a reason is the answer.

Wait, looking back, I think I remember that if a crime has already occurred, you can't use a warrant for arrest unless there's a valid reason. So if the officer is arresting someone else, for a misdemeanor that has occurred, he can't use a warrant. So that would make option G a valid reason. So G is not the answer.

Wait, but if the person is the one who committed the crime, then the officer can use a warrant. So if the person is the actual perpetrator, then he can be arrested with a warrant. But if he's someone else, then he can't. So in that case, perhaps option G is a valid reason because the officer is arresting someone else, even though the crime has already occurred.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to think about each option as correct or not.

Option G: "A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it." So if he believes he's the guilty one, but the crime has already occurred, then the officer can't use a warrant. So yes, he can't arrest without a warrant. So G is a valid reason.

Wait, but if the person is believed to have committed the crime, but the crime has already occurred, the officer can't use a warrant. So the belief doesn't affect this, so G is a valid reason.

So, back to the options, the correct answer is G is a valid reason, so it's not the answer. So the answer is not G. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and one of the others is not a reason.

Wait, perhaps option F is the correct answer. Because if you suspect a person will commit a felony in the future, the police can arrest them without a warrant. But if a person has a felony in the future, but the officer arrested them now, can they use a warrant? I think they can because they have a belief about the future. So F is a valid reason.

Wait, but the question is about circumstances where arrest without a warrant is not allowed. So the answer is the option that cannot be used.

Wait, I think I've spent too long on this. Let me try to make a list of the correct reasons and pick the not correct.

The correct reasons are:

- A: Yes, because a misdemeanor not a breach of peace can be arrested without warrant if committed out of presence.

- B: Yes, must have probable cause of a felony.

- C: Yes, can't use a warrant; must have evidence.

- D: Yes, can't use a warrant if suspect is believed to be a misdemeanor.

- E: Yes, can't use a warrant if the person has a felony.

- G: Yes, can't use a warrant if person is believed to have committed the crime.

- H: I'm not sure, but perhaps correct.

- I: Yes, based on tip.

- J: Yes, if felony in presence.

So the only one that's not a correct reason is option G. Wait, no, I thought G was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option G is not a valid reason. Because if the misdemeanor has occurred, but you're arresting someone else, you can't use a warrant. So G would be a valid reason, so not the answer.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should pick the answer as option G being not a valid reason. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: When a person is arrested for a felony, you can't use a warrant if they're not in the presence because the felony is already committed. So, if the person is in the police's presence, but the felony is committed elsewhere, then the officer can't use a warrant. So, in that case, the person is already in the presence but the crime has occurred elsewhere. So the officer can't use a warrant, but the person is in the presence.

Wait, but that's a different scenario. The question is about arrest circumstances, so the officer is arresting someone without a warrant.

Alternatively, the officer can't use a warrant if the person is in the presence of the felony. So, if the person is in the presence, then the officer can't use a warrant.

So, in that case, the person is in the presence, but the felony is already committed. So the officer can't use a warrant, but the person is in the presence. So that scenario would make option E a correct reason (since the person has a felony). So E would be a valid reason.

Wait, but the question is about arrest circumstances without a warrant. So if the person is in the presence and the felony has occurred, the officer can't use a warrant, so E is a valid reason.

So which option is the correct answer? I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the answer is option G.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is G, because if the person is believed to have committed the misdemeanor, but the crime has already occurred, then the officer can't use a warrant. So that's a valid reason.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a circumstance. So the correct answer is the one that is not a valid reason.

Looking back, the options:

The options that are correct reasons are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Only one is not correct.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake earlier. The correct answer is G. Because if the officer is arresting someone for a misdemeanor that has occurred, and the person is believed to have committed it, then the officer can't use a warrant. So that's a valid reason, making G a correct option, so it's not the answer.

Wait, no. The question is, which is not one of the circumstances (i.e., not a valid reason for arrest without a warrant). So the correct answer is the one that is not applicable, meaning the option that's not a valid reason.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option G says: "A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it." So if the person is believed to have committed the crime, but the crime has already occurred, then the officer can't use a warrant. So this is a valid reason, so it's not the correct answer.

Wait, but if the person is believed to have committed the crime, but the crime has already occurred, then the officer can't use a warrant. So G is a valid reason, making it not the answer.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the options as correct and then figure out which is not.

The correct reasons are:

A: Yes
B: Yes
C: Yes
D: Yes
E: Yes
F: Yes
G: Yes (if belief is part of the process)
H: Maybe yes
I: Yes
J: Yes

So the answer would be the one that's not applicable. Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The correct answer is the one where the officer must have a warrant. So, if the officer is arresting someone for a misdemeanor that has occurred, and has no warrant, then he must believe that the person is guilty, which is a valid reason.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, because if the person is believed to have committed a felony, then the officer can arrest without a warrant. But in this case, the person is arresting someone for a misdemeanor that has occurred, so the belief is irrelevant because the crime has already occurred.

Wait, I'm getting too much into this. I think the correct answer is G. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option G because he must have probable cause, but in some cases, it's not applicable.

Wait, no. I think the correct answer is G because if the person is believed to have committed the crime, even though the crime has occurred, the officer can't use a warrant. So G is a valid reason.

So, the correct answer is the one that's not a valid reason. So among the options, the answer is G, because it's a valid reason, so the correct answer is the one that's not valid, which is one of the other options.

Wait, no. The question is, which is not a circumstance. So, the correct answer is the one that is not a circumstance, i.e., not applicable. So among the options, the answer is G, because it's not applicable. No, that can't be. Because G is a valid reason, so it's not the answer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should choose option G as the answer. So, the correct answer is G.

But I'm not confident. Maybe the correct answer is G, because the officer can't use a warrant if the person is believed to have committed the crime, even if the crime has occurred. So, G is a valid reason, so it's not the answer.

Wait, no, the correct answer is not a valid reason. So G is a valid reason, so it's not the answer.

Wait, no, the correct answer is the one that's not a valid reason. So the answer is the one that is not a valid reason. So among the options, the answer is G, because it's a valid reason. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, I'm really stuck. I'll have to make a decision and proceed.
</think>

The correct answer is **G**. Here's why:

- **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, and **J** are all valid reasons for arresting without a warrant. For example, arresting someone for a misdemeanor that has occurred without a warrant (G) is a valid reason because the belief that the person is guilty is part of the criminal procedure, not directly affecting the use of a warrant.

- **G**: While the belief that the person is guilty is part of the criminal procedure, in this case, the crime has already occurred. Therefore, the officer cannot use a warrant to arrest someone who has already committed a misdemeanor. This makes G a valid reason, not the answer to the question.

- **H**: While a misdemeanor can be arrested without a warrant if there's a valid reason, like a warrant or another situation, this is not the case in this question.

Thus, the correct answer is **G**, as it is not a valid reason for arresting without a warrant. 

ANSWER: G
