Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about conjugation between bacteria and how it causes a sex change. Hmm, I remember that bacteria can conjugate, which is a process where DNA from one bacterium transfers to another. But wait, in this case, it's a male and a female bacterium that conjugate, and the result is the female becomes a male. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact mechanism here.

I recall that conjugation involves the transfer of plasmids or genetic material. Oh, right, the F factor is involved. The F factor is the regulatory element that controls the expression of genes in the bacteria. So, when bacteria conjugate, they exchange plasmids. But wait, in this case, the result is the female becoming male. So, how does that happen?

I think that when bacteria conjugate, they exchange plasmids. The male bacterium would have the plasmid and the male F factor. The female would have the plasmid and the female F factor. But wait, the F factor is usually for regulating the bacteria. So, when the male F factor is received, does that allow the female to change her own sex?

Oh! Because the F factor is a sex determinant. When bacteria conjugate, they exchange plasmids and the F factor. If a bacteria has a male F factor, it becomes a male. If it has a female F factor, it becomes a female. That's right, because F factor determines the sex.

So, in this scenario, the female bacterium would have the F factor from the male. Let me look at the options. Option H says the F factor is received. Option G is about receiving a sex chromosome, which I think is more about chromosome number changes.

Another thought: after conjugation, the receiving bacterium (the female) would probably gain an F factor. So, the process is that the male F factor is transferred to the female. So, the female becomes male.

Looking at the options, H says the F factor is received. But wait, the female is the one that becomes male. So, the F factor comes from the male. So the female's F factor is now male's, making her a male. So the correct reason is that she received an F factor.

So, the answer should be H: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving a sex chromosome.

Wait, but wait another thought: another possibility is that the F factor is a sex determinant. So, if a bacterium has a male F factor, it becomes male. If it has a female, it becomes female. So, the F factor is the key. So, the female (originally female) gains an F factor (male), thus becoming male.

Looking at the options, option H is exactly that: she receives a sex chromosome, but perhaps more accurately, she receives an F factor. Oh, but the options are labeled H, G, etc.

Wait, option H is: "the female bacterium becomes a male by receiving a sex chromosome." Hmm, that might not be the correct reasoning. Because the sex is determined by the F factor, not the chromosome. So perhaps the correct answer is H: receiving a sex chromosome, but that's not the right mechanism. So maybe the correct option is H is about F factor.

Wait, another angle: the F factor is a regulator. So when the male gives it, the female becomes male. So the effect is that she gains the F factor, so her sex is determined by that. So, the process is that she gets an F factor from the male, making her male.

Looking at the options, option H says the female receives a sex chromosome, which isn't correct. Option G would be about a sex chromosome, but that's not right. So the correct answer is either H or J. But I think H is about the F factor.

Wait, another way: the F factor is a sex indicator. So when the female bacterium receives the F factor, its sex is determined. So the correct option is H: receives a sex chromosome? Or J: receives multiple F factors?

Wait, no, the F factor is only one. So the process is that the female's F factor is replaced by the male's, making her a male. So the correct reasoning is that she receives an F factor (from male) making her male.

Looking at the options, option H says she receives a sex chromosome. That's not correct. Option J says she receives multiple F factors. No, because F factors are single copies. So the correct reason is she gets an F factor.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says she gets an F factor. Let me recheck the options.

The options are:

A: incorporates male g.m into genome.
B: divides and produces male offspring.
C: undergoes mutation.
D: receives a F factor.
E: exposed to environmental condition.
F: exchange plasmids.
G: receive sex chromosome.
H: receive a sex chromosome.
Wait, no, the options are:

Wait, looking at the user's question, the options are:

A: female becomes male by incorporating male g.m into genome.

H: receives a sex chromosome.

Wait, no, the options are:

A: Involves male g.m.

B: divides into male.

C: mutation.

D: F factor.

E: environment.

F: exchange plasmids.

G: receive sex chromosome.

H: receive F factor.

Wait, no, the options are:

Wait, looking again:

Wait the initial question lists options A to J, but the user pasted the options as:

A: The female becomes a male by incorporating male genetic material into its own genome.

B: The female becomes a male by dividing and producing a male offspring.

C: The female becomes a male by undergoing a mutation in its own DNA.

D: The female becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor.

E: The female becomes a male by exposure to a particular environmental condition.

F: The female becomes a male by exchanging plasmids with the male.

G: The female becomes a male by receiving a sex chromosome.

H: The female becomes a male by receiving a male chromosome.

Wait, no, looking again, the options are:

A: Involves male g.m

B: female becomes male by dividing into male.

C: mutation

D: receives F factor.

E: environmental condition.

F: exchange plasmids.

G: receive sex chromosome.

H: receive a male chromosome.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the user's options might have been a typo. Because in the list, I think the correct options are:

Looking again:

The user wrote:

Options:

A: The female becomes a male by incorporating male genetic material into its own genome.
B: The female becomes a male by dividing and producing a male offspring.
C: The female becomes a male by undergoing a mutation in its own DNA.
D: The female becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor.
E: The female becomes a male by exposure to a particular environmental condition.
F: The female becomes a male by exchanging plasmids with the male bacterium.
G: The female becomes a male by receiving a sex chromosome.
H: The female becomes a male by receiving a male chromosome.
I: The female becomes a male by conjugating with a male bacterium.
J: The female becomes a male by receiving multiple copies of the F factor.

Wait, the user's options are labeled A to J. But the initial question says the options are:

A: female becomes male by incorporating male g.m into own genome.

B: female becomes male by dividing into male.

C: mutation.

D: receives F factor.

E: environmental.

F: exchange plasmids.

G: receive sex chromosome.

H: receive male chromosome.

I: conjugate with male.

J: multiple F factors.

Ah, I see. So in that case, the correct answer is option H: receives a sex chromosome.

Wait, no, no. Because the F factor determines sex. So the female becomes male because she receives the F factor from the male. So, the correct option is D: receives one copy of F factor.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is "The female becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor." That makes sense.

Wait, but looking back, in the options given in the problem, the user lists the options as follows (from the original question):

The options are:

A: incorporating male g.m.

B: dividing into male.

C: mutation.

D: receiving F factor.

E: exposure to environment.

F: exchange plasmids.

G: receive sex chromosome.

H: receive male chromosome.

I: conjugate with male.

J: multiple F factors.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait another point: the F factor is a sex determinant. So when a female receives an F factor from the male, she becomes male. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm also thinking about the process. Conjugation involves the exchange of plasmids. But the F factor is a determinant of sex, not the plasmid.

So, after conjugation, the female's F factor is now the same as the male's, making her a male.

So the effect is that she gains the F factor, so her sex is determined by that. Hence, the process is that she receives an F factor from the male, making her male.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is D: receives one F factor.

So the answer is D.

The question involves understanding how conjugation between a male and female bacterium results in the female becoming a male. Conjugation involves the transfer of genetic material, specifically plasmids, between bacteria. However, the key factor determining the sex change is the sex determinant, which is the F factor.

The F factor is a regulatory element that controls the expression of genes in a bacterium, determining whether it is male (F factor) or female (F factor). When a bacterium conjugates, it receives the F factor from the other bacterium. If the receiving bacterium was a female and now receives the F factor from the male, it becomes a male.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Incorporating male genetic material into its genome does not directly cause sex change.
- **B**: Incorrect. Division into a male offspring is unrelated to sex change.
- **C**: Incorrect. Mutation is not the cause of sex change in conjugation.
- **D**: Correct. Receiving one copy of the F factor causes the female to become male.
- **E**: Incorrect. Exposure to environmental conditions is unrelated to conjugation or sex change.
- **F**: Incorrect. Exchange of plasmids is part of conjugation but does not directly explain sex change.
- **G**: Incorrect. Recieving a sex chromosome is not involved in conjugation.
- **H**: Incorrect. The term "receive a sex chromosome" is inaccurate; the F factor is the determining factor.
- **I**: Incorrect. Conjugating with a male bacterium is not the mechanism here.
- **J**: Incorrect. Receiving multiple F factors is not the case.

The correct answer is **D**, as receiving one copy of the F factor determines the sex change.
