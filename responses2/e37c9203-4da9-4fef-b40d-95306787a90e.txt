Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about springs and work done stretching them. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what I remember.

The problem says: A spring of force constant k is stretched a certain distance. It takes twice as much work to stretch a second spring by half this distance. We need to find the force constant of the second spring.

Wait, force constant... oh right, that's the spring constant, usually denoted by k. So the first spring has a spring constant k, and the second one has some other force constant, let's call it k2.

The first part says the first spring is stretched by a certain distance, let's call that x. The second spring is stretched by x/2. And the work done to stretch the second spring is twice that of the first. I think work done on a spring is given by the formula (1/2)k x². So the work done is proportional to the square of the displacement.

Wait, but in this case, the second spring is stretched half the distance, but the work is twice as much. Let me write down the equations.

Work done on first spring, W1 = (1/2) k (x)^2.

Work done on second spring, W2 = (1/2) k2 (x/2)^2.

The problem says W2 = 2 * W1.

So substituting the expressions:

(1/2)k2 (x²/4) = 2 * (1/2)k x².

Simplify this. The (1/2) on both sides cancels out, so:

k2 (x²/4) = 2 * k x².

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:

k2 x² = 8 k x².

Wait, then we can cancel x² from both sides since x isn't zero.

So k2 = 8k.

Wait, so the second spring has a force constant of 8k. Looking at the options, option A is 8k.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might be mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, another approach: the work done is proportional to the square of the displacement. So if the displacement is halved, the work should be (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the original. But in this case, the work is twice as much. So that makes sense because if the displacement is halved, and the work is proportional to (1/2)^2, but in our problem, W2 is 2 times W1. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me go back. The equation I set up was W2 = 2*W1.

So W1 = (1/2)k x².

W2 = (1/2)k2 (x/2)^2 = (1/2)k2 (x²/4) = (k2 x²)/8.

Set that equal to 2 W1: (k2 x²)/8 = 2*( (k x²)/2 ) => (k2 x²)/8 = k x².

Multiply both sides by 8: k2 x² = 8 k x².

Divide both sides by x²: k2 = 8k. So the second spring has a force of constant 8k, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another approach: the potential energy stored in a spring is (1/2)k x². So the work done in stretching is the change in potential energy.

So if the first spring is stretched x, work W1 is (1/2)k x².

The second spring is stretched x/2, so work W2 is (1/2)k2 (x/2)² = (1/2)k2 (x²/4) = k2 x² /8.

Given W2 = 2 W1.

Therefore, (k2 x²)/8 = 2*( (1/2)k x² ) → (k2 x²)/8 = k x².

Multiply both sides by 8: k2 x² = 8 k x² → k2 =8k.

So that's the same result. So the second spring has a force constant of 8k, which is option A. Looking at the options, option A is 8k. So the answer should be A.

The problem involves comparing the work done in stretching two springs and determining the force constant of the second spring. The work done on a spring is given by \( W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \), where \( k \) is the force constant and \( x \) is the displacement. 

For the first spring with force constant \( k \), the work done is \( W_1 = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \). For the second spring, which is stretched by \( \frac{x}{2} \), the work done is \( W_2 = \frac{1}{2} k_2 \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} k_2 \frac{x^2}{4} = \frac{k_2 x^2}{8} \).

According to the problem, \( W_2 = 2 W_1 \). Substituting the expressions for \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \):

\[
\frac{k_2 x^2}{8} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{k_2 x^2}{8} = k x^2
\]

Multiply both sides by 8:

\[
k_2 x^2 = 8 k x^2
\]

Divide both sides by \( x^2 \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):

\[
k_2 = 8k
\]

Thus, the force constant of the second spring is \( 8k \), which corresponds to option **A**.
