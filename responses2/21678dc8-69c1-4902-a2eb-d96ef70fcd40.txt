Question:

Geologists on a plane are attempting to locate the exact position of the iron reserves in a region by measuring the variation of g in the area, since a large mass of iron will exert an appreciable additional gravitational attraction on a body in the vicinity. They hover above selected spots and observe the movement of a mass suspended from a light spring. If the system has a natural period of 2 s, and the smallest movement of the mass which can be detected is 10^-6 m, what is the minimum change in g which they can observe?

Options:

A: 9.87 ×10^-6 m/s^2
B: 6.28 ×10^-6 m/s^2
C: 7.54 ×10^-6 m/s^2
D: 11.00 ×10^-6 m/s^2
E: 2.50 ×10^-6 m/s^2
F: 8.88 ×10^-6 m/s^2
G: 4.93 ×10^-6 m/s^2
H: 3.14 ×10^-6 m/s^2
I: 5.00 ×10^-6 m/s^2

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about geologists trying to find the exact position of iron reserves. The question is about measuring the change in gravitational acceleration, g. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when you have a mass suspended by a spring, the variation in g affects the period of oscillation. 

The problem says that the system has a natural period of 2 seconds. So, the period T is given as 2 s. I think the formula relating period to g is something like T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. But wait, maybe I should think about how the change in g would affect the period. 

If the actual g is slightly different, the period would change as well. So, the change in g would affect the period. The question is asking for the minimum change in g that can be observed. The smallest movement detected is 1e-6 meters. So, delta x (delta x being the movement) is 1e-6 m. 

I think I need to relate the change in g to the change in the period. The sensitivity of the measuring instrument here is based on the smallest movement in the spring's position, which relates to the spring's change in length. Wait, another approach: the period of a mass-spring system is P = 2π√(m/k). If g changes, that would change k, since the spring constant k is proportional to the force per unit length, which depends on g (since F = m g, so k = F/x, where x is the extension). So, if g changes by delta g, k changes by (delta g)/(g) times the original k. 

Wait, let me think. The spring constant k is given by Hooke's law, F = k x. The force here is the weight of the mass, so F = m g. So, k = m g / x. If there's a change in g, delta g, then the new k' = m (g + delta g) / x. The change in k is (delta g / g) * (m g / x) ) = (delta g / g) * k. So, delta k = (delta g) * (k / g). 

But how does this affect the period? The period T = 2π√(m/(k')). Let me express this in terms of T0, where T0 is the period with the original k. 

So, T0 = 2π√(m/k0), and T = 2π√(m/k') = 2π√(m/(k0 (1 + (delta g)/g )) ) ). So, T = T0 * sqrt(1/(1 + (delta g)/g )) ). 

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can approximate this for small delta g. Since the change in g is small, delta g << g, so (delta g)/g is a small number, let's say x. Then, 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x, using the Taylor expansion. So, T ≈ T0 (1 - x/2). 

Wait, wait, better to express T as T = T0 * sqrt( (1 - x) ), where x = (delta g)/g. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the binomial approximation for the square root. Let me think again. 

We can write T = T0 * sqrt( 1/(1 + x) ), which is T0 * (1 - x/2 - x^2/8 ... ), but since x is small, higher powers can be neglected. So, T ≈ T0 (1 - x/2 ). 

But wait, the problem is about finding the change in g, which is delta g. The period change is delta T = T - T0. So, delta T ≈ T0 ( - x/2 ). But wait, actually, the change in g is delta g = x * g. So, delta g = x * g. 

Wait, perhaps another approach. The natural period is 2 seconds. The change in g will cause a change in T. Let me try to find the relationship between delta g and delta T. 

Wait, the change in g would cause the natural period to change. The question is about the minimum change in g that can be observed. So, the smallest movement in the spring (delta x) is 1e-6 m. I think this is the extension of the spring, so the change in length is delta x. So, delta x = 1e-6 m. 

In the spring system, Hooke's law says F = k x. So, F = m g (initially), and F + delta F = m (g + delta g) = m g (1 + delta g). The change in force is delta F = m delta g. The change in spring force is delta F = k delta x. 

So, delta F = k delta x. But delta F is m delta g. So, m delta g = k delta x. Therefore, delta g = (k delta x)/m. 

Wait, but I don't know the mass m. Hmm, so perhaps I can relate this to the period. Because the original period is given as 2 seconds, which relates to k and m. 

The original system: T0 = 2 s, so T0 = 2π√(m/(k0)), where k0 is the original spring constant. So, T0^2 = (4 π^2 m)/(k0 ), so solving for k0 gives k0 = (4 π^2 m)/(T0^2 ). 

Wait, let's plug in T0 = 2 s: 

k0 = (4 π² m) / (2^2) ) = (4 π² m) /4 = π² m. 

So, k0 = π² m. 

Ok, going back to delta g expression: delta g = (k delta x)/m. 

But since k = π² m, substituting into the equation gives delta g = ( π² m * delta x ) / m = π² delta x. 

Wait, that's a big simplification. So, delta g = π² delta x. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me compute delta g again. 

delta F = m delta g. 

delta F is also k delta x. So, m delta g = k delta x. 

But k is pi squared m, from earlier. So, m delta g = (pi^2 m) delta x. 

Divide both sides by m: delta g = pi² delta x. 

So, delta x is 1e-6 m. So, delta g = pi^2 * 1e-6. 

Calculating pi squared: pi is approx 3.1416, so pi squared is about 9.8696. 

So, delta g ≈ 9.8696e-6 m/s². 

Looking at the options, option A is 9.87e-6. So that would be the answer. 

But wait, another thing: the natural period T0 is 2 seconds. The frequency f is 1/T0 = 0.5 Hz. The period of the system is T = 2pi / sqrt(k/m) ), which is the same as T = 2pi f.

But in this case, the change in g affects the period, but the question is about the change in g that can be detected. I think this aligns with the earlier calculation, since the natural period is 2 seconds, so any change in g would cause a change in the period, and the smallest movement (delta x) would cause a minimal delta g. 

So, yes, option A is 9.87e-6, which is the closest approximation to pi squared times 1e-6.

To determine the minimum change in gravitational acceleration \( \Delta g \) that the geologists can observe, we start by relating the change in \( g \) to the change in the spring's extension. The spring constant \( k \) is proportional to the gravitational acceleration \( g \), as \( F = m g = k x \). The natural period of the system is given as \( T_0 = 2 \, \text{s} \), and the smallest movement in the spring's extension is \( \Delta x = 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \).

Using the relationship \( \Delta F = k \Delta x \), where \( \Delta F = m \Delta g \), we find:

\[
\Delta g = \frac{k \Delta x}{m}.
\]

From the natural period \( T_0 = 2 \, \text{s} \), we know:

\[
T_0 = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \pi^2 m.
\]

Substituting \( k = \pi^2 m \) into the expression for \( \Delta g \):

\[
\Delta g = \frac{\pi^2 m \cdot \Delta x}{m} = \pi^2 \cdot \Delta x.
\]

Using \( \Delta x = 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) and \( \pi^2 \approx 9.8696 \):

\[
\Delta g \approx 9.8696 \cdot 10^{-6} \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

This value is closest to option A: \( 9.87 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
