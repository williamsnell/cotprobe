Okay, so I've got this question here about Ropinirole and dosing. Hmm. Let me try to figure it out. 

The question says a person is prescribed Ropinirole 1.5 mg divided into three doses. I need to find out how many micrograms each dose is. The options are A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. 

Wait, I remember that mg stands for milligrams and micrograms are a smaller measure. Oh right, 1 milligram is 1000 micrograms. So I need to convert milligrams to micrograms. 

The total dose is 1.5 mg. So each dose is 1.5 mg divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 1.5 divided by 3 is 0.5 mg. But wait, the question asks for micrograms, not milligrams. Oh right, so I have to convert milligrams to micrograms. 

So 0.5 mg is equal to how many micrograms? Since 1 mg is 1000 micrograms, 0.5 mg would be 0.5 * 1000 = 500 micrograms. Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh no, wait, because 0.5 mg is 500 micrograms. Wait, no, wait another way. 1 mg is 1000 micrograms, so 0.5 mg is 500 micrograms. But wait, the options are given, so option G is 50, which would be 50 micrograms. That doesn't match. Alternatively, could I have made a mistake?

Wait, no, wait again. Oh! Wait, wait. Wait, the question is about Ropinirole being 1.5 mg. So each dose is 1.5 divided by 3, which is 0.5 mg. To convert 0.5 mg to micrograms, I multiply by 1000. So 0.5 * 1000 = 500 micrograms. So each dose is 500 micrograms. Looking at the options, option D is 500, but that would be 500 micrograms, which is 0.5 mg. Oh wait, no, wait. No, 500 micrograms is 0.5 mg. So the correct answer is 500 micrograms. So looking at the options, option D is 500. But wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me make sure.

Wait, another way: 1 mg = 1000 micrograms. So 0.5 mg is 500 micrograms. So each dose is 500 micrograms. So the correct answer is option D: 500. But wait, the options are A:5, B:5000, C:0.05, D:500, E:50000, F:0.005, G:50, H:500000, I:500000, J:0.5.

Wait, so D is 500. But wait, 500 micrograms is 0.5 mg, which is correct. So the correct answer is 500 micrograms. So the answer is D.
</think>

The correct answer is D: 500 micrograms. 

**Explanation:**

1. **Convert milligrams to micrograms:** 1 mg = 1000 micrograms.
2. **Calculate the dose:** 1.5 mg divided by 3 doses equals 0.5 mg per dose.
3. **Convert 0.5 mg to micrograms:** 0.5 mg Ã— 1000 micrograms/mg = 500 micrograms per dose.

Thus, each dose is 500 micrograms.

Answer: D
