Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me see what it says. Two whole numbers have a least common multiple of 60. Each number is less than or equal to 12. Their greatest common factor is 2. I need to find the two numbers from the given options.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step. First, I remember that for two numbers, the product of their LCM and GCF is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, if I call the two numbers a and b, then:

LCM(a, b) * GCF(a, b) = a * b

In this case, LCM is 60 and GCF is 2. So plugging in, I get:

60 * 2 = a * b  
120 = a * b

So the product of the two numbers must be 120. Also, each number is ≤12, and their GCF is 2. That means they don't have any common factors apart from 2. So they are both even numbers, but not multiples of any higher number.

Let me list all the possible pairs of numbers ≤12 where their product is 120. Since both numbers are even, let me list the even numbers up to 12: 2,4,6,8,10,12.

Now, I need two numbers from this list whose product is 120.

Let me see:

2 * 60 = 120 → 60 is too big, since both must be ≤12.
4 * 30 = 120 → 30 is too big.
6 * 20 = 120 → 20 too big.
8 * 15 = 120 → 15 too big.
10 * 12 = 120 → Both are ≤12, 10 and 12. Oh, that's a possibility.

Wait, 10 and 12: their product is 120. Let me check if their GCF is 2.

GCF of 10 and 12: factors of 10 are 1,2,5,10; factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. Common factors are 1 and 2, so GCF is 2. Perfect.

Are there any other pairs? Let's check.

12 * 10 we've already considered. What about 6 and 20? 20 is too big. 8 and 15? 15 is too big. 12 and 10 is the only pair I can think of where both are ≤12.

Wait, are there any other pairs? Let me think. The product is 120, so the other possible pairs could be:

5 and 24 → no.
3 and 40 → no.
5, 24 is too big.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Let me list all possible factor pairs of 120 where both numbers are ≤12 and even.

Possible factors: 2,4,6,8,10,12.

Looking for pairs:

2 × 60 → 60 too big.
4 × 30 → too big.
6 × 20 → too big.
8 × 15 → 15 is too big.
10 × 12 → both are ≤12.

So yes, 10 and 12 is the only possible pair.

But wait, let me check the options given. The options are:

A:5 and 12 → product 60, but GCF(5,12)=1. So no.
B:12 and 15 → 15 is over 12, so no.
C:6 and 12 → product 72, which is less than 120. So no.
D:4 and 8 → product 32, which is less than 120. No.
E:3 and 9 → GCF 3. So no.
F:8 and 10 → product 80. Not 120. So no.
G:6 and 10 → product 60. Not 120.
H:2 and 10 → product 20. No.
I:2 and 6 → product 12. No.
J:10 and 12 → product 120, and GCF 2. Yes.

So the correct answer is J:10 and 12.

The two numbers must have a product of 120, be ≤12, and have a GCF of 2. The only pair that fits is 10 and 12. 

Answer: J:10 and 12
