Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer that has factors of 16, 15, and 12. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when finding a common multiple, especially the least common multiple (LCM), it's the smallest number that all the given numbers can divide into without leaving a remainder. So, I should calculate the LCM of 16, 15, and 12.

Wait, how do I find the LCM? I think it involves breaking each number into its prime factors and then taking the highest power of each prime that appears. Let me try that.

Let's factor each number:
- 16 is 2^4 because 2*2*2*2=16.
- 15 is 3 * 5.
- 12 is 2^2 * 3^1.

So, the primes involved are 2, 3, and 5. Now, I need the highest power for each:
- For 2, the highest power is 2^4 from 16.
- For 3, the highest power is 3^1 (since both 15 and 12 have 3^1).
- For 5, it's 5^1.

So, the LCM would be 2^4 * 3^1 * 5^1. Let me calculate that:
2^4 is 16, 3 is 3, 5 is 5. Multiply them together: 16 * 3 = 48; 48 *5 = 240. So the LCM is 240.

Looking at the options, option A is 240. So that's the smallest positive integer that has 16, 15, and 12 as factors. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Oh wait, 240 divided by 16 is 15, which is okay. 240 divided by 15 is 16, correct. And 240 divided by 12 is 20, which is also fine. So, yes, 240 is the right answer.

The smallest positive integer with factors 16, 15, and 12 is 240.
