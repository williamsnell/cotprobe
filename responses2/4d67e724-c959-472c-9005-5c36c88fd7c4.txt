Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's start by carefully reading each option and understanding the concepts involved.

The question is about relations in set theory. I remember that a relation can be reflexive, symmetric, transitive, etc. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: "Empty relation _ is not reflexive." Hmm, an empty relation means there are no ordered pairs. Reflexive requires that every element is related to itself. So if the relation is empty, then for all a in the set A, (a,a) is not in the relation. So the empty relation isn't reflexive. Therefore, A is saying that it's not reflexive, which seems correct. So A is a true statement.

Option B: "Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B= {1,2,3} is 64." Wait, the number of relations is 2^(|A| * |B|). Let's compute that. |A| is 3, |B| is 3. So 3*3=9. 2^9 is 512. 64 is way smaller than that. So B is false.

Option C: "Symmetric and anti-symmetric are positive of each other." Wait, anti-symmetry is the opposite of symmetry. If a relation is symmetric, it's not anti-symmetric unless it's empty. So their positivity is contradictory. So C is false.

Option D: "Empty relation is reflexive." Wait, no. Empty relation can't be reflexive because for every element a in A, (a,a) isn't in the empty relation. So D is false.

Option E: "Symmetric and anti-symmetric are negative of each other." Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Symmetric is one property, anti-symmetric is another. They aren't negatives. So E is false.

Option F: "Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1,2} is 64." Let me calculate. |A|=3, |B|=2. So 3*2=6. 2^6 is 64. So F is true. Wait, that's different from A. So F is a true statement.

Wait, but then there's another option, G and H. Let's see.

Option G: "Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation." Wait, partial-ordering is a set with reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive relations. Equivalence relations have symmetry and transitivity, but not necessarily antisymmetry (unless it's trivial). So G is false.

Option H: "Every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation." Partial-ordering has reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity. Equivalence relations need reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. So partial-ordering is a weaker condition, but not necessarily an equivalence. So H is false.

Option I: "Number of relations from A to B, where |A|=3, |B|=2, is 32." Wait, earlier I thought it's 64. Let's recalculate. 3*2=6. 2^6=64. So I's statement is 32, which is incorrect. So I is false.

Option J: "Properties of a relation being symmetric and anti-symmetric are negative of each other." Symmetric is about (a,b) implies (b,a), and anti-symmetric is about (a,b) and (b,a) implies a=b. These are not negative properties, but opposites in a way. So J is false.

So reviewing all options:

A is true because the empty relation isn't reflexive.

F is also true because 2^(9) is 512, but the option says 64. Wait, wait. Wait, B is |A|=3, |B|=3, so 3*3=9, 2^9=512. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought F was correct. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the option says number of relations is 64, which is 2^6, so B's answer is 64, which is 2^6, but 3*3=9. So that would be 2^9=512, not 64. So F is wrong. So the correct statements are A and F? But wait, the options are letters A to J, each is a statement.

Wait, let me recheck each statement.

Looking back, the options are:

A: False, as empty is not reflexive.

B: False, 64 is wrong.

C: False.

D: False.

E: False.

F: Let's recheck. A is {x,y,z}, B is {1,2}.

Number of relations: 2^(3*2) = 2^6 = 64. So F says it's 64, which is correct. So F is a true statement.

G: False.

H: False.

I: 2^6=64, so I says 32, which is wrong.

J: False.

Wait, but earlier I thought F was correct, and A is also correct.

Wait, but the options are each a statement, so only one of them can be correct.

Wait, wait, looking again. The options are A to J, and each is a statement. So maybe I need to consider which options are correct.

Wait, let me list all correct statements:

A: True.

F: True.

Wait, but let me reevaluate each statement.

A: Empty relation is not reflexive. Correct.

F: Number of relations... 3*2=6, 2^6=64. So F is correct.

Wait, but wait, the options are separate. The question says "Which of the following statements is true?" So only one option is correct. So which of the options is correct? Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused because maybe I made a mistake in evaluating F.

Wait, B is |A|=3, |B|=3. So 3x3=9. 2^9=512. So statement F is saying 64, which is 2^6. So F is incorrect.

Ah, I see. So F is false because 2^6 is 64, but 3x3=9, so 2^9=512. So F's statement is wrong. Only A is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought F was correct, but after rechecking, it's wrong.

Wait, but let me re-look at the options:

Which statements are correct?

A: False? Because the statement says "empty relation _ is not reflexive." The blank is empty, so the relation is empty, but it's not reflexive because (a,a) is not present for any a in A. So A is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each is a statement. So which of them is correct? So the correct statements are A and F?

Wait, no, because F is incorrect. So only A is correct.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the question is "Which of the following statements is true?" So only one option is correct.

So the correct statements are A and F? No, wait, F is incorrect as per earlier calculation.

Wait, no, because F says that the number of relations is 64. Which is correct only if |A| and |B| are 3 and 2, respectively.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Let me go through each option again.

A: "Empty relation is not reflexive." → Correct, because empty relation has no elements, so it can't be reflexive.

B: Number of relations from A={x,y,z} to B={1,2,3} is 64. → |A|=3, |B|=3. So 3*3=9. 2^9=512. → B's statement is 64, which is wrong.

C: Symmetric and anti-symmetric are positive of each other. → No, because symmetric and anti-symmetric are opposites. So C is false.

D: Empty relation is reflexive. → No, because for every element a in A, (a,a) is not in the empty relation. So D is false.

E: Symmetric and anti-symmetric are negative of each other. → No, they are opposites, not negatives. So E is false.

F: Number of relations from A={x,y,z} to B={1,2} is 64. → |A|=3, |B|=2. 3*2=6, 2^6=64. Correct. So F is true.

G: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering. → No, because equivalence requires symmetric and transitive, but not necessarily antisymmetric. So G is false.

H: Every partial-ordering is an equivalence. → No, partial-ordering has reflexive, antisym, transitive. Equivalence has reflexive, symmetric, transitive. So H is false.

I: Number of relations from A to B is 32. → 3*2=6, 2^6=64. So I's statement is 32, which is wrong.

J: Symmetric and anti-symmetric are negative of each other. → No, they are opposites. So J is false.

So the correct statements are A and F. But the options are A to J, each is a statement, and the question is which is true. So the correct options are A and F?

Wait, no, in the options, each option is a statement. So which of the statements A-F is correct. So looking at the options, both A and F are correct statements.

But wait, looking back, the options are A to H, and each is a separate option. So the answer would be which statements are correct.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each is a statement, and the user is to select which is true.

Wait, the user's question says "Which of the following statements is true?"

So the correct answer is both A and F. But wait, looking back, no. Wait, let me recheck the options. Are the options each a separate statement?

Wait, the options given are:

A: ... etc.

So the user is to choose from these eight options, each option is a statement. So the correct ones are A, F, and others? But looking, I only found A and F to be correct.

Wait, but the user's question says "which of the following statements is true?" So which statement is correct. So the possible correct options are either A, F, or both. But looking, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating F. Let me double-check.

Option F says: "Number of relations from A to B is 64." A is {x, y, z}, B is {1, 2}. So the number of elements in A is 3, in B is 2. So the number of possible ordered pairs is 3*2=6. So the number of relations is 2^6=64. So F is correct.

Wait, so both A and F are correct statements.

But the options are labeled A to J, each is a separate statement. So the correct answer would be both A and F, but in the multiple-choice options, the user is to select one option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in the original problem, the options are A to J, each a statement, and the user should select which is true. So if both A and F are correct, but looking, perhaps the correct options are A and F.

Wait, but looking back, the problem's options are listed as A to J, each a statement, and the user is to select which is true. So the correct options would be A and F.

But in the initial problem, the options are presented as separate statements, but the user is to select which is true. Wait, the question says "which of the following statements is true?" So the correct options are A and F. But in reality, in the original problem, the options are A to J, each being a statement, and you have to choose which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct options are A and F. But let me check the options again.

Wait, the problem says, "Which of the following statements is true?" So the correct options are A, F, and possibly others.

Wait, but wait, looking back, is F correct?

Wait, the problem statement for F is: "Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2, 3), is 64."

Wait, |A| is 3, |B| is 3. So the number of ordered pairs is 3*3=9. So the number of relations is 2^9=512. So F's statement is 64, which is wrong.

Wait, so F is incorrect. So the only correct statement is A.

Wait, but I thought A is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment.

Wait, let me reevaluate A. A: "Empty relation is not reflexive." The empty relation has no elements. So for a relation to be reflexive, every (a, a) must be present. But in the empty relation, for all a in A, (a,a) is not present. So the empty relation is not reflexive. So A is correct.

Wait, but the initial thought process for F was incorrect because 2^9=512, not 64.

So correct statements are A and F? No, F is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought F was correct. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. So F is incorrect. So the only correct statement is A.

Wait, but wait, I've been confused. Let me recheck.

Option F: "Number of relations from A to B is 64." |A|=3, |B|=3. So 3*3=9 → 2^9=512. So F says 64, which is wrong.

So correct statements are A and F? No, because F is wrong.

Wait, but looking again, I think I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me reevaluate each statement.

Option A: Correct.

Option B: 2^9=512≠64. So incorrect.

Option C: Symmetric and anti-symmetric are positive of each other. No, they are opposites. So incorrect.

Option D: Empty relation is reflexive. No, because (a,a) is not present. So incorrect.

Option E: Symmetric and anti-symmetric are negative of each other. No, they are opposites. So incorrect.

Option F: 2^9=512≠64. So incorrect.

Option G: Equivalence is a partial order. No, equivalence has symmetry and transitivity, not antisymmetry. So incorrect.

Option H: Partial order is equivalence. No, same reasoning. So incorrect.

Option I: 2^9=512≠32. So incorrect.

Option J: Symmetric and anti-symmetric are negatives. No, opposites. So incorrect.

So the only correct statement is A. So the answer is A.

The correct answer is **A**. The empty relation is not reflexive because it lacks all ordered pairs (a, a) for every element a in the set.
