Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 2,816 multiplied by 7. Hmm, I need to figure out what that equals. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, maybe I should break it down to make it easier. I know that 2,000 times 7 is 14,000. Then, 800 times 7 is 5,600. Wait, no, 800 times 7 is actually 5,600. Then 16 times 7 is 112. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 16 times 7 is 112. So adding all those together: 14,000 plus 5,600 is 19,600, plus 112 gives me 19,712. Let me double-check that.

Wait, maybe I should add 2,000 * 7 = 14,000. Then 800 *7=5,600. So 14,000 +5,600 is 19,600. Then 16 *7 is 112. Adding 112 to 19,600 gives 19,712. That seems right. So the product is 19,712. 

Looking back at the options, option F is 19,712. So the answer should be F. Let me see if I did everything correctly. Oh, wait another way: 2,816 *7. Let me do it step by step. 

2,816 Ã—7: 

Let me multiply 2,816 by 7. 

6 *7 is 42, write down 2, carryover 4. 
1*7 is 7 plus 4 is 11, write 1, carryover 1. 
8*7 is 56 plus 1 is 57, write 7, carryover 5. 
2*7 is 14 plus 5 is 19. 

So writing it out: 19,712. Yep, that's the same result. So the correct answer is option F.

The correct answer is **F: 19,712**.
