Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the fugacity of carbon dioxide using the reduced Berthelot equation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The given equation is z = [(PV)/(RT)] = 1 + [9/(128)] * [ (PT_c) / (P_c T) ] * [1 - 6*(T_c²)/(T²) ]. I need to find the fugacity, but wait, actually, the reduced equation gives z as fugacity over pressure, right? Because I remember the equation is F = z P, where F is fugacity and P is pressure. Or wait, maybe F is the fugacity, so z is F/P. So I should calculate z first and then multiply by P to get F.

Wait, let me confirm. The equation is given as z = (PV)/(RT), which is z = F/P. So yes, z is F/P. So the fugacity F is z times P.

So the steps are: compute z using the given values, then multiply P (which is 50 atm) by z to get F.

The variables given are T_c=304.3 K, P_c=73.0 atm. The current temperature is 150°C, which is 150 + 273.15 = 423.15 K. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait, wait. Wait, no, 150°C is 150 + 273.15? No, wait, 0°C is 273.15 K. So 150°C is 150 +273.15 = 423.15 K? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 100°C is 373.15 K, so 150 is 423.15 K. Yes. Correct.

Wait, the pressure given is P = 50 atm. P_c is 73 atm. So the first term is (P)/(P_c) = 50/73.

The second part is (T_c²)/(T²). But T is 423.15 K. So I'll compute (304.3)^2 / (423.15)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each part step by step.

Let me compute all the numbers.

First, compute the first factor in the z equation: [ (PT_c) / (P_c T) ].

Wait, that's (P * T_c) / (P_c * T). So substituting the values:

P is 50 atm, P_c is 73 atm, T_c is 304.3 K, T is 423.15 K.

So (50 * 304.3) / (73 * 423.15) = ?

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 50 * 304.3 = 15,215.

Denominator: 73 * 423.15.

Compute 73 * 400 = 29,200. 73 * 23.15 = let's see, 73*20=1460, 73*3.15=230.95. So 1460 +230.95=1690.95. So denominator is 29,200 + 1,690.95 = 30,890.95.

So (15,215)/(30,890.95) = approx 0.4928.

Wait, let me compute that. 15,215 ÷30,890.95. Let me see, 30,890.95 * 0.5 = 15,445.475. So 0.5 is a bit more than 15,215. So 0.4928.

So the first factor is 0.4928.

Then the second term is [1 - 6*( (T_c^2) / (T^2) ) ].

Compute (T_c)^2 = (304.3)^2. Let me compute that.

304.3^2: 300^2=90,000. 4.3^2=18.49. 2*(300)*(4.3)=2580. So 90,000 + 2580 + 18.49 = 92,600 approx. Wait, wait, no: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So a=300, b=4.3. So 300²=90,000, 2*300*4.3=2580, and 4.3²=18.49. So total is 90,000 +2580=92,580 +18.49=92,598.49 K².

Similarly, T^2 is (423.15)^2.

423^2 is 178,929. Let's compute 423.15^2. Let me approximate.

Well, 420^2=176,400. 3^2=9. 2*420*3=2520. So (420+3.15)^2 = 420² + 2*420*3.15 + 3.15².

420²=176,400. 2*420*3.15= 2*420=840 *3.15= 840*3=2520, 840*0.15=126. So 2520+126=2646. So 176,400 +2646= 179,046. Then add 3.15²=9.9225. So total is 179,046 + 9.9225=179,055.9225.

So (T_c^2)/(T^2) is (92,598.49)/(179,055.9225) ≈ 0.515.

So 6 times that is 3.09.

So the second part of the equation is 1 - 3.09 = -2.09.

So putting together the two factors:

[9/(128)] * [0.4928] * (-2.09).

Compute [9/(128)] first. 9 ÷ 128 is approximately 0.0703125.

Multiply by 0.4928: 0.0703125 * 0.4928 ≈ 0.03468.

Multiply by (-2.09): 0.03468 * (-2.09) ≈ -0.0723.

So the entire equation: 1 + (-0.0723) = 0.9277.

So z = 0.9277.

Now, F = z * P.

P is 50 atm, so F = 0.9277 *50 = approx 46.385 atm.

Looking at the options, option C is 50 atm, option G is 46.4 atm. Oh, so our calculation gives about 46.385, which rounds to 46.4 atm. So the answer should be option C, but wait, wait. Wait, wait, the options are:

Looking back, the options are:

A:60.5
B:37.8
C:50
D:73
E:88.1
F:25.6
G:46.4
H:304.3
I:55.2

Wait, so 46.4 is option G. So the answer should be G.

To calculate the fugacity of carbon dioxide at 150°C (423.15 K) and 50 atm pressure using the reduced Berthelot equation:

The equation is:

\[
z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \left( \frac{PT_c}{P_cT} \right) \left[ 1 - 6 \left( \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right) \right]
\]

### Step 1: Compute the first factor \(\frac{PT_c}{P_cT}\)
Substitute \(P = 50 \, \text{atm}\), \(P_c = 73.0 \, \text{atm}\), \(T_c = 304.3 \, \text{K}\), and \(T = 423.15 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{PT_c}{P_cT} = \frac{50 \times 304.3}{73.0 \times 423.15} = \frac{15,215}{30,890.95} \approx 0.4928
\]

### Step 2: Compute the second factor \(\left[ 1 - 6 \left( \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right) \right]\)
First, calculate \(T_c^2\) and \(T^2\):

\[
T_c^2 = 304.3^2 \approx 92,598.49 \, \text{K}^2, \quad T^2 = 423.15^2 \approx 179,055.92 \, \text{K}^2
\]

\[
\frac{T_c^2}{T^2} = \frac{92,598.49}{179,055.92} \approx 0.515
\]

\[
6 \left( \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right) = 6 \times 0.515 = 3.09
\]

\[
\left[ 1 - 6 \left( \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right) \right] = 1 - 3.09 = -2.09
\]

### Step 3: Combine the factors to compute \(z\)
Substitute into the equation:

\[
z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \times 0.4928 \times (-2.09)
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{9}{128}\):

\[
\frac{9}{128} \approx 0.0703125
\]

Next, multiply by \(0.4928\):

\[
0.0703125 \times 0.4928 \approx 0.03468
\]

Then, multiply by \(-2.09\):

\[
0.03468 \times (-2.09) \approx -0.0723
\]

Finally, add to 1:

\[
z = 1 - 0.0723 = 0.9277
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the fugacity \(F\)
The fugacity \(F\) is related to \(z\) by \(F = zP\). Substitute \(z = 0.9277\) and \(P = 50 \, \text{atm}\):

\[
F = 0.9277 \times 50 = 46.385 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The calculated fugacity is approximately \(46.4 \, \text{atm}\), which corresponds to option **G**.
