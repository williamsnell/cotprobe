Question:

A 51-year-old man comes to the office because of a 6-month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating; he also has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss during this period. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?

Options:

A: Parotid
B: Retropharyngeal
C: Subclavian
D: Submental
E: Supraclavicular
F: Popliteal
G: Inferior deep cervical
H: Preauricular
I: Axillary
J: Inguinal

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a patient who has a lump on his tongue that's interfering with his speech and eating. He's 51, had weight loss, smoked 1 pack daily, and had six 12-oz beer bottles on weekends. His vital signs are normal. The physical exam shows squamous cell carcinoma on the tongue apex. The question is about which lymph node to evaluate first for metastasis.

Hmm, I remember that lymph nodes in the context of cancer are usually checked in the lymph nodes surrounding the tumor. But wait, the tumor here is on the tongue. So the next step is probably to look for nearby lymph nodes that are connected to the tumor. 

The options given are various lymph nodes from different parts of the body. Let me think about where the parotid gland is. Oh right, the parotid is above the tongue, and the apex of the tongue is near it. So if there's a tumors on the tongue, that would relate to the parotid area. 

Wait, but during physical exam, they found the mass on the tongue. The parotid is above the tongue, so if that's the case, the mass is in the parotid's vicinity. So evaluating the parotid would be the first step because that's where the tumor is. But wait, sometimes the tumor might spread to other nodes nearby, not necessarily the same as the tumor's location. Or is it?

Wait, another thought: The question is about evaluating the lymph nodes first. The standard approach is to look for the tumor's location first and then the nodes nearby. So if the tumor is in the parotid, then the parotid is the first node to evaluate. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the answer options don't include the parotid as a choice. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is Parotid, B Retropharyngeal, C Subclavian, D Submental, E Supraclavicular, F Popliteal, G Inferior deep cervical, H Preauricular, I Axillary, J Inguinal.

So option A is the parotid. But I thought the tumor is on the tongue, so the parotid is probably the first node to be checked. But wait, I remember that sometimes the tumor's location can be a distant node that's connected. For example, if the tumor is in the parotid, the node itself would be the first to be examined. But in some cases, if the tumor is elsewhere, it might be distant, but in this case, the mass is on the tongue, which is near the parotid.

Alternatively, perhaps the tumor is in the parotid, and the lymph nodes are the ones that would be evaluated first. So the answer would be option A: Parotid. But wait, the question is about which node to evaluate first for metastasis. So the first step would be to see if the tumor is in that node. If it is, then that's the first candidate. So parotid is the first.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes, the node where the tumor is located is the first node to be examined. So if the tumor is in the parotid, the parotid node is the first to be evaluated. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that sometimes the tumor might not be in the same location as the lymph node. No, wait, the lymph nodes are surrounding the tumor. So the tumor is in the node, so the node is the first to be examined.

So the correct answer should be option A: Parotid.

The patient's mass on the tongue, which is near the parotid gland, suggests that the parotid is the first node to be evaluated for metastasis. Since the tumor is located in the parotid area, the parotid is the first lymph node to be examined. 

Answer: A
