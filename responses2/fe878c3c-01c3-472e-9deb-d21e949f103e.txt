Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about corporate laws, specifically about directors' removal from their positions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is about the articles of incorporation. It says, "In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, the directors of a corporation elected for a specified term..." So, the key here is that the articles don't have any provisions against the removal of directors, which means the directors have some rights.

I remember that in corporate law, directors have certain rights. One of them is the right to be removed from office. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions and the votes needed to remove them.

Looking at the options, each one gives a different reason why directors might be removed. Let's go through each one.

Option A: "Can be removed from office at a meeting of the shareholders, but only with a two-thirds majority vote." I think that's about the shareholders' votes. If the directors are elected by the shareholders, then shareholders can remove directors if they get a majority. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Option B: "Can be removed at a shareholder meeting, but only if they fail to attend three consecutive meetings without a reason." That sounds familiar. I think there's a rule that directors can be removed by shareholders if they don't attend three meetings in a row. So it's not just a vote but attendance is a factor. But does this apply when there's no provision in the articles? Because the question says without a provision, so I guess this is a general rule applicable regardless of the articles.

Option C: "Cannot be removed prior to term expiration." Wait, that seems incorrect. I remember that directors are usually allowed to be removed before their term ends. Like, they can be taken out early. So if there's no provision, that shouldn't be the case.

Option D: "Only by the board of directors." No, I don't think so. Directors are elected by the shareholders, so they have the right to be removed regardless of who they're replaced by. The board might have its own rules, but directors can be taken out without that.

Option E: "Can be removed at a meeting with or without cause." Hmm. I'm not sure about cause. I thought that directors can be removed by shareholders, but whether there's a cause or not might vary. The wording here is a bit ambiguous.

Option F: "Only by a decree in a shareholder action." That seems specific and not the general rule. The general rule is about votes and attendance.

Option G: "Only by a unanimous vote." No, that doesn't sound right. A majority vote should suffice, not a unanimous one.

Option H: "At a meeting, but only for cause and after an opportunity." I'm not sure about that. I thought directors could be removed without a cause, but maybe in some cases, especially if shareholders think it's necessary, a cause is required.

Option I: "Only for cause." That's similar to option H, but again, I'm not certain.

Option J: "Only if a replacement was identified." That seems too restrictive. I don't think directors can only be removed if a replacement is found; they have the right to be removed otherwise.

Wait, I should think about the general corporate law rules. Under the Articles of Incorporation, directors have the right to be removed. But when there's no provision, they have some rights. 

I remember that in a corporate setting, directors' removal is possible under the Articles, but under common law, it's a specific rule. But since the question is about articles of incorporation, I need to consider those.

In the absence of a provision, directors can be removed if certain conditions are met. I think they can be removed by shareholders either by a two-thirds majority vote or by failing to attend three meetings. That would make option B correct. It says they can be removed at a shareholder meeting, but only if they fail to attend three consecutive meetings without a reason.

Wait, looking at option B, it specifically says "a meeting of the shareholders" and "only if they fail to attend three consecutive meetings without a reasonable excuse." That aligns with what I remember. So option B would be correct.

Let me check the other options again. Option C says directors can't be removed before term ends, which isn't correct because directors usually can be removed before their term ends. So option C is wrong.

Option H says directors can be removed "only for cause and after an opportunity to be heard." I don't think that's the case. The right to be removed is generally not tied to cause unless there's a specific situation, like if the business is in immediate danger.

So the correct answer is option B.

The correct answer is option B. Directors can be removed from office at a meeting of the shareholders under the absence of a provision, provided they fail to attend three consecutive meetings without a reasonable excuse. This rule is based on the general corporate law requirements that directors have the right to be removed without a specific cause, as long as shareholders have a majority vote or provide a reason for absence. Other options either violate the absence of a provision or misstate the conditions for directors' removal.
