Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about legal rights. The question is asking what the Butler is pointing out as the right that only anyone has. The options are A to J, each corresponding to different rights. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through.

Wait, Butler's quote? I remember he said something about the right of the individual, maybe related to their freedom. Let me try to recall. I think he talked about the principle of personal rights. Oh right, he mentioned that everyone has the right to be themselves and not forced to conform to societal expectations. So that's about individual freedom.

Looking at the options: A is justice, which is about fairness, not a personal right. B is security, related to protecting others, not rights. C is liberty, which is the free will to not be governed by others. D is freedom of speech, which is a right but I think it's more for individuals, not the entire society. E is life, which doesn't make much sense as a legal right. F is education, maybe for personal development but not a legal right. G is property, which relates to ownership, not rights. H is equality, which is about being treated the same as others, not the right to be themselves. I is happiness, which is a subjective feeling, not a legal right. J is health, which again is subjective.

Wait, but Butler's quote was something about the individual having the right to be themselves, which is freedom. So the correct answer should be C: liberty. Because liberty means the right to be free from the control of others, right? So the only thing anyone has a right to is liberty. That makes sense.

So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: liberty. Butler's quote emphasizes the individual's right to be free from societal constraints, which is best captured by the concept of liberty.

Answer: C
