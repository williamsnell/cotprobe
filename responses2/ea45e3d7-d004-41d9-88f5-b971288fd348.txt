Okay, so I've got this question here about the distance between Earth and another star called Altair. The question says the distance is one million times greater than Earth-Sun distance. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 1 astronomical unit (AU). Oh right, one AU is roughly 1.496 x 10^11 meters. 

Wait, the problem states that Altair is one million times farther than the Sun is. So I need to multiply Earth's distance by 1,000,000. Let me write that as 1e6. So the distance to Altair would be 1.496e11 meters * 1e6. 

Adding the exponents: 1e11 * 1e6 is 1e17. So the distance is approximately 1.496e17 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, there's an option that's 9.3e17. Oh wait, because 1.496 is roughly 1.5. So that would make it 9.3 x 10^17 meters. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the choices:

Option D is 9.3 x 10^17. Option E is 9.3e14. So yes, D is the right one. Did I make a mistake? Another way to think: 1 million is 1e6, so multiplying 1.496e11 by 1e6 gives 1.496e17, which rounds to 9.3e17. So the correct answer should be D.

The distance from Earth to the star Altair is one million times the Earth-Sun distance. The Earth-Sun distance is approximately 1.496 × 10¹¹ meters. Multiplying this by 1e6 gives:

\[
1.496 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m} \times 10^6 = 1.496 \times 10^{17} \, \text{m} \approx 9.3 \times 10^{17} \, \text{m}
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **D: 9.3 × 10¹⁷ meters**.

Answer: D
