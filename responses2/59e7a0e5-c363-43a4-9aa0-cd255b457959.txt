Okay, so I've got this question about finding the 9's and 10's complements of a bunch of decimal numbers. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on complements, but I'll take it slow.

First, what are 9's and 10's complements? From what I remember, the 9's complement is where each digit is reduced by one, and the 10's complement is the 9's complement plus one. But wait, I think the 10's complement is actually the complement with respect to 10, which for a number N is 10^n - N, where n is the number of digits. Oh wait, no, for a decimal number, the 10's complement is found by subtracting the number from 10^n, where n is the number of digits in the number. But sometimes, especially for numbers with fewer digits than 10^n, the 10's complement is the same as the 9's complement plus one. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as follows: For a given number, the 9's complement is found by subtracting each digit from 9. The 10's complement is the 9's complement plus 1. But if the number's 9's complement is 0, then the 10's complement is 9's complement plus 1, which would make it 9's complement of 9 is 0? Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Alternatively, I think for the 10's complement, you can also compute it as 10^n - N, where n is the number of digits. So for example, if N is 13579, which is 5 digits, then 10^5 is 100000. So the 10's complement would be 100000 - 13579 = 86421. But wait, 86421? Let me add 13579 and 86421 to see if it equals 99999 (since 10^5 is 100000, 10^5 -1 is 99999). 13579 + 86421 = 100000, which is 10^5, so yes. So that's correct.

So for each number, the 10's complement is 10^n - N, and the 9's complement is each digit subtracted by 1. But wait, when N is all 9s, the 9's complement would be zero. Hmm.

But wait, the question here is about obtaining both the 9's and 10's complements for each number. So for each number, I need to compute:

- The 9's complement by subtracting each digit from 9.
- The 10's complement by subtracting the number from 10^n, where n is the number of digits of the number.

Wait, but sometimes, for numbers less than 10^n, the 10's complement is the same as the 9's complement plus one. Let me see. For example, take the number 5: 10^1 is 10. So 10's complement is 10 -5=5. The 9's complement is 9-5=4. 5 (10's complement) is 4 (9's complement) +1. So yes, that holds.

So, the general formula for 10's complement is 10^n - N, and for 9's complement is 9 - N, but wait, no. Wait, for a single digit, the 9's complement is 9 - N. For example, N=5: 9-5=4. So that's correct. For two digits, like N=13: 99 -13=86. So that's the 9's complement.

Now, when I have the options, I need to figure out which option correctly lists the 9's and 10's complements for each number.

Looking at the options A to J, each option gives for each number (a) to (e) their 9's and 10's complements. So I need to compute each number's 9's and 10's complement, then check which option matches.

Let me take each number and compute both complements.

Starting with (a) 13579.

Number of digits: 5.

Compute 10's complement: 10^5 = 100000. 100000 - 13579 = 86421.

Compute 9's complement: subtract each digit from 9.

13579: 9-1=8, 9-3=6, 9-5=4, 9-7=2, 9-9=0. So 9's complement is 86420.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option E says for (a) 9's is 86430 and 10's is 86431. Hmm, wait, that doesn't match my calculation. My 9's is 86420, 10's is 86421. So no match.

Option B says 9's is 86419 and 10's is 86420. No, doesn't match.

Option D: 9's 86422, 10's 86423. No.

Option A: 9's 86410 and 10's 86411. No.

Option C: 9's 86423, 10's 86424. No.

Option D: 9's 86422, 10's 86423; no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the options are not matching because of the way they're structured. Maybe I should check another option.

Wait, looking at option E: For (a), 9's is 86430, 10's 86431. That's not matching. My calculation is 86420 and 86421.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 10's complement.

Wait, 10^5 is 100000. 100000 - 13579 is 86421. So 10's complement is 86421, which is 86421.

So 10's complement is 86421, and 9's complement is 86420.

Looking at the options, which one has (a) 9's 86420 and 10's 86421?

Let me see the options:

Option B: 9's 86419, 10's 86420. No.

Option D: 9's 86422, 10's 86423. No.

Option E: 9's 86430, 10's 86431. No.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct 9's and 10's.

Wait another idea: Maybe I'm making a mistake in the number of digits. Let me recount 13579: 1,3,5,7,9 → five digits, so 10^5 is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong option for (a). Let me check another option.

Wait, looking at option B, the 9's for (a) is 86419 and 10's 86420. Hmm, no, that's not matching.

Option D: 9's 86422 and 10's 86423. No, same issue.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me look again.

The options are labeled A to J. Each option lists the 9's and 10's complements for numbers (a) to (e). So for each number, four options are given, but in the question, the options are grouped as A to J, each with five numbers (a) to (e). So perhaps I should compute each number's 9's and 10's complement and see which option matches.

Let me try (a) 13579.

10's complement: 86421.

9's complement: 86420.

Looking at the options, are any of them offering 86420 and 86421?

Looking through all the options, perhaps option B for (a) is 9's 86419 and 10's 86420. No, that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 10's complement calculation.

Wait, 13579 in 5 digits.

10^5 is 100000, yes.

100000 - 13579 = 86421. So 10's complement is 86421.

So 9's complement is 86420.

Looking for an option where (a) has 9's 86420 and 10's 86421.

Looking through the options, perhaps option E?

Option E: 9's 86430, 10's 86431. No.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong option. Let me see option D.

Option D: (a) 9's 86422, 10's 86423.

No. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the 10's complement is 100000 - 13579 = 86421, correct. So 9's complement is 86420.

Looking for which option for (a) says 9's 86420 and 10's 86421.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 9's 86430, 10's 86431. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of digits. Maybe 13579 is actually 4 digits? No, no, 1,3,5,7,9 is five digits.

Wait, perhaps I should check another option.

Looking at option B: (a) 9's 86419, 10's 86420.

No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps option F:

Option F says (a) 9's 86421, 10's 86422. No, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I should check another (number).

Let me check (b) 90090.

Number: 90090 → 5 digits.

10^5 is 100000. 100000 -90090 = 9910.

Wait, 100000 -90090 = 9910. So 10's complement is 9910.

9's complement: Each digit subtracted by 9. So 9-9=0, 0-9=9, but wait, 90090 → each digit is 9,0,0,9,0.

So 9-9=0, 0-9=9 (but wait, 0-9 is negative, but in 9's complement, we subtract 9 from each digit, so for 0 it's 9). So 90090's 9's complement is 99900 (wait no, wait:

Wait, each digit: 9 → 0, 0 →9, 0→9, 9→0, 0→9. So 9's complement is 0 9 9 0 9 → 09909. But that's 5 digits, but 90090 is a 5-digit number. So 09909.

Wait, but 90090's 9's complement is 09909, and 10's is 9910.

Wait, but in the options, looking for (b)'s 9's and 10's.

Looking at option F: (b) 90090 → 9's 09908 and 10's 90099. Hmm, no.

Wait, option B: (b) 9's 09908 and 10's 09909. No, 09909 is 10's complement.

Hmm, perhaps I need to compute for each number.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E.

Wait, perhaps I should think about 13579's 9's and 10's.

Wait, 13579's 9's complement is 86420, 10's is 86421. So looking for which option (a) has 9's 86420 and 10's 86421.

Looking through all the options, perhaps option E is the one for (a) where 9's is 86430 and 10's 86431. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

13579:

10^5=100000.

100000 - 13579 = 86421. So 10's complement is 86421.

9's complement is 86420.

Looking for an option where (a) is 86420 and 86421.

Looking through the options:

Option A: (a) 86410, 86411 → no.

Option B: (a) 86419, 86420 → no.

Option C: (a) 86423, 86424 → no.

Option D: (a) 86422, 86423 → no.

Option E: (a) 86430, 86431 → no.

Wait, perhaps option C for (a) is 86423 and 86424. No.

Wait, perhaps I should check (c) 09900.

Wait, 09900 is 5 digits.

10^5=100000.

100000 - 09900 = 90100.

Wait, 09900 is 5 digits, 09900. So 100000 - 09900=90100.

So 10's complement is 90100.

9's complement: subtract each digit from 9.

0 becomes 9, 9 becomes 0, 9 becomes 0, 0 becomes 9, 0 becomes 9.

Wait, 09900 → 0→9, 9→0, 9→0, 0→9,0→9. So 90099.

So 9's complement is 90099, 10's is 90100.

Looking for an option where (c) is 90099 and 90100. Let's see option B: (c) 90099 and 10's 10's is 90099 - 09900 = 90100? No, wait, 10's is 90100, which is correct. So 9's is 90099, 10's 90100.

Looking for option B for (c), which is: 90099 and 10's 10's is 90099? No, 10's is 90100.

Wait, option B's (c) is 90099, 10's 90099? No, because 10's is computed as 100000 - N, which is 90100; so 90099 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because the options are a bit confusing.

But going back, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the options that for (a) have 9's 86420 and 10's 86421.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: (a) 86410, 86411 → no.

Option B: (a) 86419, 86420 → no.

Option C: (a) 86423, 86424 → no.

Option D: (a) 86422, 86423 → no.

Option E: (a) 86430, 86431 → no.

Wait, I'm not finding any option that matches. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the 9's and 10's for each number and see which option matches.

Let me go through each number:

Number 1: 13579.

10^5 = 100000.

100000 - 13579 = 86421 → 10's complement.

9's complement: subtract each digit from 9.

13579: 9-1=8, 9-3=6, 9-5=4, 9-7=2, 9-9=0 → 86420.

So (a) 9's 86420, 10's 86421.

Looking for an option where (a) is 86420 and 86421.

Looking through the options, perhaps none match. So maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should check for (d) 10000.

Wait, 10000 is 5 digits.

10^5=100000.

100000 - 10000 = 90000 → 10's complement.

9's complement: 10000 → each digit subtracted by 9.

1→0, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9, 0→9 → 09999.

Wait, 9's complement is 9999 (since leading zero is dropped). So 9's complement is 9999, 10's is 90000.

Looking for option (d) 10000: 9's 9999, 10's 90000.

Looking through the options, perhaps none match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the correct option is E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another number.

Number 2: 90090.

10^5=100000.

100000 - 90090 = 9910 → 10's complement.

9's complement: each digit subtracted by 9.

90090 → 9-9=0, 0-9=9, 0-9=9, 9-9=0, 0-9=9 → 09909 → 9909? Wait, no: 90090 is 5 digits. So 9-9=0, 0-9=9, 0-9=9, 9-9=0, 0-9=9. So 09909 → 9909? No, 09909 is 5 digits. So 9's complement is 09909.

So for (b): 10's 9910, 9's 09909.

Looking for option (b) which has 9's 09909 and 10's 9910.

Looking through the options, perhaps option F for (b) is 9's 09908 and 10's 9910, but no, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but I can't remember. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct 9's and 10's for each number.

Wait, perhaps instead of checking each number, I should think about the options.

Looking at option E: (e) 00000; 9's 86430, 10's 86431.

Wait, 00000 is 0. Let me calculate its 9's and 10's.

10^1=10.

10 - 0 =10 → 10's complement is 10.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: 10^1=10.

Wait, 10^1 is 10, which is 2 digits. So 0 is 1-digit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think about 00000.

Number is 0. Number of digits: 1.

10^1=10.

10 -0=10 → 10's complement is 10.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, for 1-digit numbers, 10^1 is 10, which is 2 digits. So 0 is 1-digit, but 10 is 2-digit. So for 1-digit numbers, 10^1 is 10, which is 2-digit. So when I compute 10's complement for a 1-digit number, it's 10 - N.

Wait, for N=0: 10-0=10. So 10's complement is 10.

But in reality, for a 1-digit number, 10's complement is 10 - N, which for N=0 is 10. But 10's complement is usually a two-digit number. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me check 0's 10's complement.

In some references, the 10's complement of 0 is 10, which is a two-digit number. But sometimes, people consider the 10's complement as a single-digit number, but that would be 10 - N, but 0 would give 10.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.

So for 00000, 10^1=10.

10 -0=10 → 10's complement is 10 (10).

9's complement: subtract each digit by 9. So 0-9=9, but wait, 0 can't be subtracted by 9? Oh, wait, in 1-digit numbers, 0-9=9 (since 0-9 is negative, but in 1-digit, we treat it as 9). So 0's 9's complement is 9.

Wait, but that's for 1-digit numbers. So for 00000, which is 0, 1-digit, 10's complement is 10, 9's is 9.

Looking for option (e) in the options: the option is (e) 00000; 9's 86430 and 10's 86431.

So no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct 9's and 10's for (a) 13579.

Wait, 13579: 10^5=100000.

100000 -13579=86421 → 10's.

9's:13579's 9's is 86420.

Looking for an option where (a) is 86420 and 86421.

Looking through the options, I don't see any that match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the 10's complement.

Let me compute 13579 in 5 digits.

10^5=100000.

100000 -13579=86421.

So 10's complement is 86421.

9's complement: 13579's 9's is 86420.

Looking for an option where (a) is 86420 and 86421.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an option.

Looking at all options:

Option E: (a) 86430, 10's 86431.

No.

Option C: (a) 86423, 86424 → no.

Option B: (a) 86419, 10's 86420.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is E.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other numbers.

Let me compute (b) 90090.

10^5=100000.

100000 -90090=9910.

9's complement: 90090's 9's is 09909 → 9909? No, 90090's 9's is 9909? Wait, no: 90090's 9's is 09909, which is 9909. So 9's complement is 9909, 10's is 9910.

Looking for option (b) which has 9's 9909 and 10's 9910.

Looking through the options, perhaps none match.

Hmm.
