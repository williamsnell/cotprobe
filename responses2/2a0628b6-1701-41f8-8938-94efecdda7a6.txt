Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about ethics and the theories presented here. The question is asking what kind of consequentialist theory Dershowitz thinks can justify terrorism in certain extreme cases. The options are A to J, each a different ethical theory.

First, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Consequentialism is a big one. There are different types of consequentialist theories, like deontological, rule-based hedonism, act-based deontology, etc.

Option A is deontological ethics. That's about the rightness of actions based on their moral duties rather than outcomes. So like, if you commit a certain act, you're doing it for the right reasons.

Option B is rule-based hedonism. I think this is more about following rules to maximize happiness, but it's a bit vague. It might not account for the worst possible outcomes, just the ones that fit the rules.

Option C is act-based deontology. That's similar to deontological, but it's more about the acts themselves. Like, if you act in a certain way, it's right because of the nature of the act.

Option D is egoistic hedonism. This seems to focus on self-interest. You act because it's good for your own happiness, ignoring the consequences, especially in extreme cases.

Option E is moral relativism. That's the view that morality isn't absolute or universal. What's right in one context might be wrong in another.

Option F is act utilitarianism. This is about maximizing the overall utility or happiness. If an act leads to the greatest good for the greatest harm, it's right. So if terrorism leads to a lot of suffering, it's justifiable.

Option G is rule utilitarianism. This is similar to F but applies the utilitarian principle to rules. So if a rule leads to the greatest happiness, it's right.

Option H is rule egoism. I'm not too clear on this. I think it's a bit of a mix, perhaps combining rule-based considerations with an egoistic view. Like, you act according to the rules you're bound by, but you're also motivated by your own good.

Option I is virtue ethics. This is about character and moral behavior, not just actions. So even if you act incorrectly, your character matters.

Option J is act-based hedonism. Wait, that's similar to option D. It's about actions being right because they maximize happiness, regardless of consequences beyond the immediate. So similar to D, which is egoistic.

So the question is about Dershowitz's theory. I'm trying to remember what Dershowitz's stance is. I think he's known for ideas related to act utilitarianism. He's a key figure in Utilitarianism, especially in the context of applying it to justice and ethics.

Wait, but let me think. I recall that Dershowitz has written about different utilitarian approaches, including act utilitarianism. He's been critical of certain types of consequentialist approaches, perhaps because they focus too much on outcomes without considering the worst-case scenarios, which he thinks are the real issues in real-world situations.

So the question is asking, what kind of consequentialist theory does Dershowitz think is justified for terrorism in extreme cases. If it's act utilitarianism, then it's about maximizing overall happiness, leading to the worst possible outcomes as justified, even if those outcomes are severe.

Looking back, option F is act utilitarianism, and option J is act-based hedonism, which is similar but perhaps more about the motivations. Wait, option J is act-based hedonism, but I think that's more about the consequences for the consequences. Maybe I got that wrong.

Alternatively, option F is act utilitarianism, which directly states that the act is right if it maximizes overall good. So terrorism, if it leads to the greatest possible suffering, would be justified under act utilitarianism.

But wait, I think Dershowitz might not accept act utilitarianism because it's too focused on the consequences and not considering the worst-case scenarios as justifiable. He might prefer something more about the rightness of the act itself, which is what act-based deontological would offer, but that's not an option here.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is act-based hedonism. Let me think again: rule utilitarianism (G) would maximize the overall happiness, which includes the worst outcomes. So if Dershowitz thinks that, option F would be the answer.

Alternatively, if Dershowitz's theory isn't utilitarian but more deontological or rule-based, but I'm not sure. From what I remember, Dershowitz is known for his work on utilitarianism. He has written about the limitations of consequentialist theories, especially in real-world scenarios, and his arguments often center around applying utilitarianism to justice and morality.

So the answer is probably F: act utilitarianism, which would be option F. Because option J is act-based hedonism, which is more about the consequences than the act itself, but I'm not sure if that's the same as act utilitarianism. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, because I think Dershowitz would lean towards a utilitarian approach that focuses on the overall outcome.

The question asks which consequentialist theory Dershowitz favors for justifying terrorism in extreme cases. Dershowitz is known for his work on utilitarianism, particularly in critiquing its application to real-world scenarios. He argues against certain consequentialist approaches, such as rule-based hedonism, and emphasizes the importance of applying ethical theories like act utilitarianism to justice and morality.

Option F, act utilitarianism, aligns with Dershowitz's stance, as it focuses on maximizing overall happiness, including the worst-case scenarios, making it a justification for such actions.

Answer: F
