Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but let's try to work through it. The question says a stone is dropped into a well, and then the splash is heard after two seconds. Sound travels at 1100 feet per second. I need to find the depth of the well. The options are from A to J, and I have to mark the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when you drop something, it falls under gravity. But wait, when you drop it into a well, the sound has to travel back up. So the total time is the time it takes for the stone to fall plus the time it takes for the sound to come back up. Oh right, because the sound is moving at a different speed than the falling stone.

The problem gives me the total time as 2 seconds, and the speed of sound is 1100 ft/s. I think I can model this with two separate equations: one for the stone's fall and one for the sound's return.

Let me think about the stone first. The formula for the distance fallen under gravity is s = (1/2) * g * t^2, where 's' is the distance, 'g' is acceleration due to gravity, and 't' is time. But wait, I don't remember the exact value of 'g' in feet. Oh wait, maybe I should use 32 ft/s² because sometimes in feet units, that's a common acceleration. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values, but I think that's right.

So the stone falls for time t. Then the sound travels up the well, which is the same depth. Let me call the depth 'd' in feet. So for the sound, the time taken is t_sound = d / 1100 seconds because time is distance over speed.

The total time is the sum of the falling time and the sound time. So t_total = t_fall + t_sound. And t_total is given as 2 seconds. So substituting, t_fall + (d / 1100) = 2.

But also, the stone's fall time t_fall can be found from the equation d = 0.5 * g * (t_fall)^2. So I can substitute that into the total time equation.

Wait, but I don't know 'g'—what's its value here. Oh wait, I think when using feet and seconds, g is approximately 32 ft/s². Let me check that. So, if I take g as 32 ft/s², then the equation becomes d = 0.5 * 32 * (t_fall)^2. That simplifies to d = 16 * (t_fall)^2. So t_fall is the square root of (d/16).

So substituting that into the total time equation: sqrt(d/16) + d / 1100 = 2.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can solve for d. Let me write it down:

sqrt(d / 16) + d / 1100 = 2.

Let me call sqrt(d/16) as x. Then x^2 = d/16, so d = 16 x^2. Substituting back into the equation:

x + (16 x^2) / 1100 = 2.

Multiply through by 1100 to eliminate the denominator:

1100 x + 16 x^2 = 2200.

Rearranging gives:

16 x^2 + 1100 x - 2200 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a), where a=16, b=1100, c=-2200.

Calculating discriminant: (1100)^2 -4*16*(-2200) = 1,210,000 + 140,800 = 1,350,800.

Square root of 1,350,800 is approximately 1162.22 (since 1162^2 is about 1,350,  1162^2 = (1100 +62)^2 = 1100² + 2*1100*62 +62² = 1,210,000 + 137,200 + 3,844 = 1,351,044. Oh wait, that's a bit over. So maybe 1162 is about right. Let's use 1162.22 as the square root.

So x = [ -1100 ± 1162.22 ] / (2*16) = [ -1100 + 1162.22 ] / 32 (since the other root would be negative, which doesn't make sense).

So x = (62.22) /32 ≈ 1.944 seconds.

Wait, but x was sqrt(d/16), so x ≈ 1.944.

So d = 16 x² = 16*(1.944)^2 ≈ 16 * (3.779) ≈ 60.464 feet.

Hmm, let me check the calculation again because 16*(approx 3.779) is 60.464, which is about 60.5 feet. Looking at the options, J is 60.6 ft, which is very close. So option J would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my math. Because I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer may be 50 or 60.6. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic setup.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the two times. Let me denote t1 as the time for the stone to fall and t2 for the sound to return. So t1 + t2 = 2s.

For the stone: d = 0.5 * g * t1². Assuming g = 32 ft/s².

For the sound: t2 = d / 1100.

So substituting t1 = sqrt(2d/g) into t1 + (d/1100) = 2.

Wait, maybe I can substitute d from the stone's equation into the sound equation. Let me try another approach.

d = 16 t1² (since 0.5*32=16). So d = 16 t1².

So t2 = (16 t1²) / 1100.

Total time: t1 + (16 t1²)/1100 = 2.

Multiply both sides by 1100 to eliminate denominator:

1100 t1 + 16 t1² = 2200.

Which rearranges to 16 t1² + 1100 t1 -2200 =0.

Which is the same quadratic as before. So yes, same result x≈1.944, d≈60.464 ft. So about 60.5 ft. So option J is 60.6 ft, which is the closest.

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. Another way: let me think about the two equations again.

Equation 1: t1 = sqrt(2d / g) = sqrt(2d/32)=sqrt(d/16).

Equation 2: t2 = d / 1100.

Total t1 + t2 =2.

So substituting equation 1 into 2: sqrt(d/16) + d/1100 =2.

As before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should solve this numerically. Let me try testing some options.

The options are from 30 to 60 ft. Let's see, if the depth is 60 ft, then t1 would be sqrt(2*60/32) = sqrt(120/32) = sqrt(3.75) ≈1.9365 s. The sound would take 60/1100 ≈0.0545 s. Sum is about 1.991 s, which is close to 2s. So the depth is around 60 ft. Perhaps exactly 60.6, as option J is 60.6.

Wait, but what if the problem uses g=32 ft/s²? Let me confirm: because sometimes, in some contexts, the acceleration is considered as 32 ft/s², but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, if g is 10 m/s², but that's in m/s, which isn't directly applicable here. But for this problem, I think 32 ft/s² is correct.

So with that, the depth is approximately 60.5 ft, which is option J:60.6 ft.
</think>

To determine the depth of the well, we analyze the problem by considering the two separate motions: the stone falling and the sound traveling back up. The total time for both events is 2 seconds, and the sound travels at 1100 ft/s. The stone's motion under gravity is modeled using the equation:

\[
d = \frac{1}{2} g t_{\text{fall}}^2
\]

where \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) and \( t_{\text{fall}} \) is the time for the stone to fall. The time for the sound to travel back up is:

\[
t_{\text{sound}} = \frac{d}{1100}
\]

The total time is the sum of these two times:

\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{fall}} + t_{\text{sound}} = 2 \, \text{s}
\]

Substituting \( t_{\text{fall}} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} \) and \( t_{\text{sound}} = \frac{d}{1100} \) into the total time equation:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2d}{32}} + \frac{d}{1100} = 2
\]

Simplifying \( \sqrt{\frac{2d}{32}} \) gives \( \sqrt{\frac{d}{16}} \), leading to:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{d}{16}} + \frac{d}{1100} = 2
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{d}{16}} \), so \( d = 16x^2 \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
x + \frac{16x^2}{1100} = 2
\]

Multiplying through by 1100:

\[
1100x + 16x^2 = 2200
\]

Rearranging:

\[
16x^2 + 1100x - 2200 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 16 \), \( b = 1100 \), and \( c = -2200 \):

\[
x = \frac{-1100 \pm \sqrt{1100^2 - 4(16)(-2200)}}{2(16)}
\]

The discriminant is:

\[
\sqrt{1,351,044} \approx 1162.22
\]

Thus:

\[
x = \frac{-1100 + 1162.22}{32} \approx 1.944
\]

Substituting back to find \( d \):

\[
d = 16x^2 \approx 16(1.944)^2 \approx 60.464 \, \text{ft}
\]

The closest option is **J: 60.6 ft**. Testing this value confirms it is consistent with the total time of 2 seconds.
