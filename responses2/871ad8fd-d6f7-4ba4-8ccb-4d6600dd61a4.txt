Okay, so I've got this question here about converting a room temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The question is asking what the common room temperature of 68°F corresponds to on the Centigrade scale, which is Celsius. The options are from A to J, each with different temperatures.

Hmm, wait, I remember that the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales are two different temperature scales. To convert between them, I think the formula is something like C = (F - 32) * 5/9. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me think about that again. Oh right, because 0°C is 32°F, so subtracting 32 adjusts for that offset. Then multiply by 5/9 to get the Celsius equivalent.

So, the given temperature is 68°F. I need to plug that into the formula. Let me write that down:

C = (68 - 32) * (5/9)

Calculating the subtraction first: 68 minus 32 is 36. So now I have 36 multiplied by 5/9. Let me compute that. 36 multiplied by 5 is 180, and then divided by 9 would be 20. Oh wait, 36 * 5 is 180, 180 divided by 9 is 20. So the calculation gives me 20°C.

Looking at the options, option F is 20°C. So the answer should be F.

To convert 68°F to Celsius, use the formula \( C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \). Plugging in 68°F: \( C = (68 - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} = 36 \times \frac{5}{9} = 20°C \). The correct option is F.

Answer: F
