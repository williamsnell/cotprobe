Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about John Dalton and the percentage of hydrogen in water. He found that water is 12.5% hydrogen by weight. The problem says to assume that each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms for every three oxygen atoms. And each hydrogen atom is 1 amu. We need to find the atomic weight of oxygen.

Hmm, I remember that atomic weight is like the mass of an atom in atomic mass units (amu). So for each element, the atomic weight is the average weight of its isotopes, but in this case, it's probably a simple calculation.

So, let's think about the composition of water. Water is H2O. So each molecule has 2 H atoms and 1 O atom.

The percentage by weight of hydrogen is 12.5%. That means in 100 grams of water, 12.5 grams are hydrogen, and the rest (87.5 grams) are oxygen.

But wait, the problem says to assume a ratio of 2 H atoms to 3 O atoms. So the ratio is 2:3.

So, let's model this. For every molecule, there are 2 H and 3 O.

The formula of water is H2O, so the formula unit is H2O.

So, the molecular weight of H2O is (2*1) + (16) = 2 + 16 = 18 amu.

But wait, the problem is not directly about the molecular weight. It's about the percentage. So the percentage of hydrogen by weight is 12.5%.

So, to find the atomic weight of oxygen using this ratio.

Let me set this up.

Assume that the ratio of H to O is 2:3 by atoms. So, in a certain mass, the mass of H would be 2 parts, and O would be 3 parts, making 5 parts total.

But wait, the actual composition is 2 H and 1 O per molecule. So per mole, H2O is 18 amu.

But for the percentage, it's 12.5%. Let's think in terms of mass.

Mass of H in H2O is 2 H atoms. Each H is 1 amu, so 2 amu.

Mass of O is 16 amu.

So the percentage of H is (2 amu) / (18 amu) * 100% = (1/9)*100% ≈ 11.11%.

But wait, the problem says that the percentage is 12.5%. Hmm. That suggests that the ratio is different.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Because under the assumption of 2:3 ratio, the calculated H percentage is around 11.1%, but the problem states it's 12.5%. So perhaps the problem isn't assuming the 2:3 ratio, but that's what the question gives. Oh, wait, no, the question says to assume that water contains 2 H atoms for every 3 O atoms. So that's the ratio to use.

Wait, but wait a minute. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me re-express it.

Let me consider the formula of water. Each water molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So in terms of mass per mole: 2*1 = 2 amu for H, and 16 amu for O. So total per mole is 18 amu.

The mass of H in the molecule is 2 amu, so the percentage of H is (2/18) * 100 = 11.11%. But the problem says that the percentage is 12.5%. So that suggests that the ratio is different. Or perhaps the problem is using a different assumption.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Maybe it's about the ratio of H to O in terms of the number of moles, but let's try another approach.

Let me denote the number of H atoms as 2x and O as 3x, where x is a multiplier. So the number of H is 2x, O is 3x.

The molecular weight of H2O is (2x)*1 + 3x*16 = 2x + 48x = 50x amu.

The mass of H in the molecule is 2x * 1 = 2x amu.

The percentage of H is (2x / (50x)) * 100% = (2/50)*100 = 4%.

Wait, but the problem states 12.5%, which is much higher. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the ratio is 2 H atoms to 3 O atoms, but maybe that's the ratio of the entire mass, not the atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't using the actual ratio of atoms but the ratio of the masses. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says: Assume that water contains two hydrogen atoms for every three oxygen atoms. So that implies that the mass of H is 2 parts and O is 3 parts, but perhaps the ratio of the masses is 2:3, considering the atomic weights.

Wait, but that might be the case. Let me model it.

Let me denote the mass ratio as H:O = 2:3.

But each H is 1 amu, each O is u amu (u is what we're trying to find).

The mass of each H is 1 amu, each O is u amu.

So the ratio of mass of H to O is (2 * 1) : (3 * u) = 2 : 3u.

But according to the problem, the ratio is 2:3. So 2 : 3u = 2 : 3.

Wait, no. Because the problem states that the ratio of H atoms to O atoms is 2:3, but the ratio of their masses is 2:3 as well.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says, per this assumption, H2O has 2 H and 3 O atoms. So for each molecule, 2 H and 3 O.

So in terms of masses, H is 2 * 1 = 2 amu, O is 3 * u amu. So the ratio H:O mass is 2:3u.

According to the problem, the percentage of H is 12.5%. So looking back, the mass of H in the sample is 2 amu, and the mass of O is 3u amu.

So the total mass of H2O in 50u amu? Wait, no, the H mass is 2 and O is 3u.

Wait, no, let me correct: the mass of H is 2 amu, mass of O is 3u amu. So the total mass is (2 + 3u) amu.

The percentage of H is (2 / (2 + 3u)) *100 = 12.5%.

Ah, that makes more sense. So solving for u.

So, 2 / (2 + 3u) = 0.125.

So, 2 = 0.125 * (2 + 3u)

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the denominator: 16 = 2 + 3u.

Subtract 2: 14 = 3u → u = 14/3 ≈ 4.666... amu.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.67 amu. So that would be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. So, if O is approx 4.67 amu, then H is 2 amu, and O is 3 * 4.67 =14.01 amu. So the mass ratio is 2 :14.01 → which is approximately 2:14.01. So H is 2/(2+14.01) ≈ 2/16.01 ≈ 12.49%, which rounds to 12.5%, which matches the problem's data. So that's correct.

So the atomic weight of oxygen is approximately 4.67 amu.

To determine the atomic weight of oxygen, we use the given data that water contains 2 hydrogen atoms for every 3 oxygen atoms and that water is 12.5% hydrogen by weight.

1. **Assume the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms**: The problem states a ratio of 2:3 for hydrogen to oxygen atoms. For every 2 hydrogen atoms, there are 3 oxygen atoms.

2. **Calculate the mass of hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio**:
   - Each hydrogen atom weighs 1 amu, so 2 hydrogen atoms weigh \(2 \, \text{amu}\).
   - Each oxygen atom weighs \(u \, \text{amu}\), so 3 oxygen atoms weigh \(3u \, \text{amu}\).

3. **Set up the equation for the percentage of hydrogen**:
   - The percentage of hydrogen by weight is given by:
     \[
     \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Hydrogen}}{\text{Total Mass of Water}} \right) \times 100 = 12.5\%
     \]
   - Substituting the masses:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2 + 3u} \times 100 = 12.5
     \]

4. **Solve for \(u\)**:
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2 + 3u} = 0.125
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by \(2 + 3u\):
     \[
     2 = 0.125(2 + 3u)
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the denominator:
     \[
     16 = 2 + 3u
     \]
   - Subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     14 = 3u
     \]
   - Divide by 3:
     \[
     u = \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67 \, \text{amu}
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: The atomic weight of oxygen is approximately \(4.67 \, \text{amu}\).
