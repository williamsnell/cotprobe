On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor "is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. " Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?

Okay, so I've got this question about legal principles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The scenario is about a debtor who owed a creditor $750. The statute of limitations was set on July 1, meaning the debt couldn't be repaid until after that date. But in August, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party. They talk to mutual friends and say that the debtor is a "deadbeat" who weiches on his debts. That makes me think the debtor is trying to shed light on his past behavior, maybe trying to avoid paying.

Then the debtor approaches the creditor and orally agrees to pay $750 on September 1. But he refuses to pay as promised. The question is whether the creditor can recover the debt, and what would provide the strongest grounds that the oral promise was unenforceable.

I need to recall the key legal principles involved here. Let's go through each option.

First, the statute of limitations. The debt was barred by that on July 1. So any payment after that date is subject to the statute. But the debtor tried to pay on September 1, which is after the statute. However, the statute of frauds might come into play. Wait, the statute of frauds usually refers to the statute of limitations in contracts. The statute of frauds says that a promise must be made in good faith and in the absence of mutual consideration, it's unenforceable.

Wait, but the statute of frauds is about contracts, not the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations is about the statute of frauds. So if the statute of frauds was in effect, a promise made without mutual consideration is unenforceable.

In this case, the debtor tried to make an oral promise on September 1. The mutual friends told him it was a deadbeat, but the creditor didn't respond. The debtor's statement was hearsay, I think. Hearsay is hearsay, so the creditor can't rely on it to prove the debt.

But if that's the case, the question is about the strength of the grounds. One of the options is about the statute of frauds. So perhaps the issue is about whether the promise was made in good faith.

Wait, the statute of frauds requires mutual consideration. The promise here was made on September 1, and the creditor didn't agree to pay as promised. The mutual friends told him it's a deadbeat and that he's owed money. But the creditor didn't agree.

Wait, but the mutual friends are the ones telling the debtor. So the debtor made the promise to the creditor, not the friends. So the friends were not in the business of paying the debt. So their statement is hearsay.

So the creditor can't use the friends' statement to prove the debt. So the problem is whether the promise was made in good faith.

Wait, but the statute of frauds is about whether the promise was made in good faith. The statute of frauds applies to contracts where mutual consideration is required. If the promise was not made in good faith, then it's unenforceable. But since the promise was on September 1, and the creditor didn't agree, the promise doesn't have mutual consideration. So that's a violation of the statute of frauds. Which would be option B.

Alternatively, the statute of frauds would apply to the situation. So the answer might be B. But wait, the statute of frauds is about contracts, not about the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations is separate. So if the creditor sues, the issue is whether the promise was made in good faith.

Wait, but the statute of frauds doesn't apply to the statute of limitations. So the statute of frauds is about whether the promise was in the best interests of the parties. But the statute of limitations is about whether the payment is due. 

Wait, but the statute of frauds is about contracts. If the debtor made a promise (a contract) and then the creditor refused to enforce it, then the creditor would have to look at whether that promise was made in good faith. 

But the statute of frauds is about whether the promise was made in good faith. So if the promise was made without mutual consideration, it's unenforceable.

In this case, the promise was made by the debtor to the creditor, not to the friends. So the mutual consideration isn't mutual. So the promise wasn't made in good faith, so the statute of frauds applies. Therefore, the answer would be option B.

Alternatively, what about the other options?

Option A: It was not supported by new consideration. Here, the debtor made the promise. The mutual friends told him it's a deadbeat. But the creditor didn't agree. So, the promise was not made in good faith. So A is not correct.

Option C: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations. The debt was barred on July 1, so it's eligible for payment only after that. But the debtor tried to pay on September 1. So if the creditor can enforce the statute of frauds, that would mean that the promise is unenforceable, so the debt can't be recovered. But the question is about what provides the strongest grounds that the promise is unenforceable. So perhaps the statute of frauds is the issue.

Option D: There was no mutuality of obligation. The debtor and creditor are the parties here. The promise is from debtor to creditor. The statement was made by the debtor. The creditor didn't agree. But the creditor's failure to agree doesn't necessarily mean that the obligation was mutual. Wait, no, mutual obligation is when both parties agree to a certain amount. Here, the creditor didn't agree to pay as promised. So no, the obligation wasn't mutual. So D is not correct because the promise was not mutual.

Wait, but the prohibition on the statute of frauds is about the promise being made in good faith, which would make it unenforceable. So in this case, the friends didn't agree, so the promise wasn't in good faith, so the statute of frauds applies. So the strongest grounds would be option B: violation of the statute of frauds.

So the correct answer would be B.

The question revolves around whether the creditor can recover the $750 debt by the debtor, given that the debt was barred by the statute of limitations on July 1. On August 1, the debtor attempted to orally agree to pay the debt on September 1, but refused to comply. The key legal principles to consider are the statute of frauds and the requirement for mutual consideration.

1. **Statute of Frauds**: This requires mutual consideration for a promise to be enforceable. The promise was made by the debtor to the creditor, not to the mutual friends who informed him of the debtor's situation. Since the promise lacked mutual consideration, it violates the statute of frauds, making it unenforceable. This would provide the strongest grounds for the creditor to recover the debt.

2. **Mutual Obligation**: The promise was from the debtor to the creditor, not the other way around. The creditor's failure to agree to pay as promised does not negate the mutual obligation between the debtor and the creditor. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

3. **New Consideration**: The debtor did not provide mutual consideration for the promise. Thus, option A is incorrect.

4. **Barred by Statute of Limitations**: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations, but the issue is whether the promise was unenforceable, not whether the debt could still be recovered. Therefore, option C is not the strongest grounds.

The strongest grounds for the creditor's claim are the violation of the statute of frauds due to the lack of mutual consideration in the promise. 

ANSWER: B
