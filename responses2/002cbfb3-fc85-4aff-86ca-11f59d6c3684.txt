Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have three equations involving a, b, and c. They are all positive numbers, which probably helps because I don't have to worry about negative values messing things up. The equations are:

a² / b = 1  
b² / c = 2  
c² / a = 3  

And I need to find the value of a, and the options are given from A to J. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I see that each equation involves a squared term divided by another variable. Maybe if I can express each variable in terms of another, I can substitute them into each other. Let's start by solving each equation for one variable in terms of another.

From the first equation: a² / b = 1. So I can rearrange that to find b. Multiply both sides by b: a² = b. So b equals a squared. So b = a².

Now the second equation: b² / c = 2. I can substitute the value of b from the first equation here. So b is a², so (a²)² / c = 2. That simplifies to a^4 / c = 2. Then, solving for c: c = a^4 / 2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. If (a²)^2 is a^4, and that equals 2c, then yes, c = a^4 / 2. So c is a^4 divided by 2.

Now the third equation: c² / a = 3. Let's substitute c here. Since c = a^4 / 2, then c squared is (a^4 / 2)^2, which is a^8 / 4. So (a^8 / 4) / a = 3. Simplify that: a^8 / (4a) = 3. Which is a^7 / 4 = 3.

Wait, because a^8 divided by a is a^7. So a^7 /4 =3. Then, multiply both sides by 4: a^7 = 12. So a = (12)^(1/7).

Hmm, let me check the options. Option B is 7^(1/6), option D is 12^(1/7), and option I is 7^(1/12). Wait, so a is 12 raised to the 1/7 power, which is option D. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Wait, let me go through each step again.

First equation: a²/b =1 → b =a².

Second equation: b²/c =2 → (a²)^2 /c =2 → a^4 /c =2 → c= a^4 /2.

Third equation: c² /a=3 → (a^4/2)^2 /a =3 → (a^8)/(4a) =3 → a^7 /4 =3 → a^7=12 → a=12^(1/7).

So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D: 12^(1/7).

But wait, let me consider if I might have made a mistake in substituting. Let me verify by plugging back into the original equations.

If a=12^(1/7), then b= a²= (12^(1/7))^2 =12^(2/7).

c= a^4 /2 = (12^(1/7))^4 /2 =12^(4/7)/2.

Now let's check the third equation: c² /a= 3.

c squared is (12^(4/7)/2)^2 =12^(8/7)/4.

Divide by a: (12^(8/7)/4) / (12^(1/7)) =12^(8/7 -1/7)/4 =12^(7/7)/4=12/4=3. Yep, that works.

So all the equations are satisfied, so a is indeed 12^(1/7), which is option D.

The equations are solved by expressing each variable in terms of the others:

1. From \( a^2 / b = 1 \), we get \( b = a^2 \).
2. Substituting \( b = a^2 \) into \( b^2 / c = 2 \), we get \( c = a^4 / 2 \).
3. Substituting \( c = a^4 / 2 \) into \( c^2 / a = 3 \), we get \( a^7 = 12 \), so \( a = 12^{1/7} \).

Verification confirms that all equations are satisfied with \( a = 12^{1/7} \).

Answer: D
