Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about vertical integration. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about what happens when a firm merges or acquires another. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that vertical integration is a business strategy where a company owns or controls a whole range of products or services from its production, distribution, and sale chains. So, it's about controlling all stages of production.

Looking at the options:

A: Towards the consumer. Hmm, that sounds more like product differentiation or marketing. Vertical integration isn't about targeting the consumer; it's about controlling the supply chain.

B: With a competitor. Oh, wait, that's usually part of horizontal integration. When a company buys a competitor, they're merging, and that's horizontal. So B is incorrect.

C: At the same stage of the supply chain. Vertical integration implies moving through multiple stages, not staying at the same point. So C is probably not right.

D: In a different country. Vertical integration doesn't mean moving to a different country; it's about same-stage operations. So D is incorrect.

E: Towards the manufacturer. That's part of vertical integration, right? Because if a company has a manufacturer, they're likely controlling the production chain. So E could be correct.

F: Towards the source of supply. That's related to how you get products. For example, a company might source raw materials from different sources. Vertical integration would mean controlling the entire supply chain, including sourcing, so maybe F is part of it.

Wait, but F says "towards the source of supply," which is the raw material, so that's more about sourcing. Vertical integration is about having the entire chain, not just sourcing. So F might not be the right answer.

G: In another industry. No, that's part of horizontal or vertical integration? Wait, no. Vertical integration is about controlling the same industry's supply chain. So G is incorrect.

H: At a different stage of the supply chain. No, that's part of vertical integration. It's about moving through multiple stages, not being at a different stage.

I: Towards the supplier of raw materials. That's part of the supply chain, but again, vertical integration isn't just about moving through stages; it's about controlling the entire chain.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. Vertical integration is when a company takes over another entire company in the same industry, controlling all the stages from production to distribution. So the stages should all be in the same supply chain.

Looking back, A is consumer, B is horizontal (buying another), C same stage—no, that's not vertical. D is different country—no. E is towards the manufacturer, which is part. F is source, that's more about sourcing. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "merges or acquires another." So vertical integration could be either buying (horizontal) or selling (vertical). The question is about the forward direction, which for vertical integration is selling another company's entire supply chain. So the result is moving towards the manufacturer, which is E. Alternatively, if it's buying, then it's moving towards a competitor, which is B, but that's horizontal, not vertical.

So the correct answer should be E: Towards the manufacturer. Because vertical integration would involve acquiring a company that's a whole bunch of operations in the same industry, moving from the manufacturer to the consumer. So the merged company would be located in the same supply chain, but the direction is towards the manufacturer.

Vertical integration involves a company acquiring or controlling another entire company within the same industry, thereby controlling the entire supply chain. This strategy allows a business to move from the manufacturer towards the consumer. 

- **A: Towards the consumer** — Incorrect, as vertical integration refers to controlling the supply chain, not targeting the consumer.
- **B: With a competitor** — Incorrect, as this involves horizontal integration (merging with another company).
- **C: At the same stage of the supply chain** — Incorrect, as vertical integration involves moving through multiple stages.
- **D: In a different country** — Incorrect, as vertical integration focuses on the same industry.
- **E: Towards the manufacturer** — Correct, as vertical integration involves acquiring a company located at the manufacturing stage.
- **F: Towards the source of supply** — Incorrect, as this pertains to sourcing, not the entire supply chain.
- **G: In another industry** — Incorrect, as vertical integration is within the same industry.
- **H: At a different stage of the supply chain** — Incorrect, as vertical integration involves multiple stages.
- **I: Towards the supplier of raw materials** — Incorrect, as this is part of the supply chain but not vertical integration.

The correct answer is **E: Towards the manufacturer**.

Answer: E
