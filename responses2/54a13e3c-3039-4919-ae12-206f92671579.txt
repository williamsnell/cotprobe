Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a rhombus FGHJ. The diagonals intersect at K. They gave me that the measure of angle FJH is 82 degrees, and I need to find the measure of angle KHJ. Hmm, let's see.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals split each other into two equal parts and form four right triangles inside the rhombus. That might help.

Wait, the angle given is FJH. Let me visualize the rhombus. So, points F, G, H, J. The angle at point FJH. Hmm, point J is one vertex, so FJH is the angle at J. So, in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, the angle FJH is at vertex J, which is one of the corners.

In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is 82 degrees, the adjacent angle would be 98 degrees, because 180 - 82 = 98. But wait, maybe I should draw it out to be precise.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the diagonals. When diagonals intersect at K, they create four triangles. Each triangle has right angles at K, because the diagonals are perpendicular. So, each triangle is a right-angled triangle.

Looking at angle FJH. Let's consider triangle FJK. Since K is the intersection point, FJ is a side of the rhombus, and JK is half of the diagonal from J. Wait, no, actually, FJ would be a side, but the angle at J is between sides FJ and HJ. Since the diagonals bisect the angles, the angle FJH is half of the angle at J.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The angle FJH is at vertex J. So, in the rhombus, the angle at J is between sides FJ and JH. Since the diagonals bisect each angle, the angle between FJ and the diagonal would be half of angle FJH. Wait, no, perhaps I should use triangle properties.

Alternatively, since the diagonals intersect at K, and the diagonals are perpendicular, the triangles formed are right triangles. So, angle FJH is in triangle FJH. Wait, no, in the rhombus FGHJ, the sides are FG, GH, HJ, and JF. So, the angle FJH is at point J, between sides FJ and HJ.

The diagonals intersect at K, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, in triangle FJH, K is a point where the diagonals meet, so when the diagonals cross, they form four congruent right triangles.

Wait, maybe I should think about the properties of the rhombus. The diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, in rhombus FGHJ, the diagonals are FH and GJ. They intersect at K, so they form four right triangles: FKG, KGH, KJH, and KJF.

Given that angle FJH is 82 degrees. Let's think about triangle FJH. Wait, maybe I should think about the angles formed by the diagonals.

Wait, in the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, the angle at J, which is FJH, is being bisected by the diagonal JH. Wait, no, the diagonal JH is one of the diagonals, so maybe it's the other diagonal, GJ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the point J. The angle at J is FJH, which is 82 degrees. Since the diagonals bisect the angles, each of the two angles at J would be half of 82? No, wait, that's not correct because the angle at J is between two sides. Let me clarify.

The angle FJH is between FJ and HJ. So, the angle is at J. So, the diagonal JH is one of the diagonals, and the other diagonal is FH. The diagonals intersect at K, so K is the midpoint of both diagonals.

In this case, the angle at J (FJH) is 82 degrees. Since the diagonals bisect the angles, each of the two angles formed at J by the diagonals would be half of 82. So, each of those angles would be 41 degrees.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, when the diagonals cross, they create four congruent right triangles. Wait, no, the triangles are not congruent unless the rhombus is a square, which it isn't because the angle is 82 degrees, not 90. So, the triangles formed are congruent in pairs.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the properties of the rhombus. Each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors.

Wait, perhaps another approach. In a rhombus, the diagonals split the angles into two equal parts. So, if angle FJH is 82 degrees, which is at vertex J, then each of the angles formed by the diagonal JH would be 82/2 = 41 degrees.

Wait, but in triangle FJK, which is one of the four right-angled triangles formed by the diagonals, the angle at J would be 41 degrees. Then, the other angle at J in triangle JKH would also be 41 degrees, since the diagonals bisect the angles.

Wait, but the angle we're looking for is angle KHJ. Let's think about triangle KHJ. The angle at K, between points K, H, J.

Wait, no, in the rhombus, point K is where diagonals intersect, so in triangle KHJ, the angle at K is the angle between sides KJ and KH. But since K is the midpoint, KJ and KH are both half the lengths of the diagonals, but we're looking for the angle itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that the angle we need, angle KHJ, is part of the right triangles formed by the diagonals. Since the diagonals intersect at K at right angles, and the angle at J is 82 degrees, perhaps the angle we're looking for is 90 - 41 = 49 degrees.

Wait, let me think again. The angle FJH is 82 degrees at point J. The diagonal JH divides this angle into two equal parts, each of 41 degrees. So, in triangle FJK, the angle at J is 41 degrees. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the angle between JH and the other diagonal (FH) would be 90 degrees. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the triangle FJH. The angle at J is 82 degrees, and the diagonal JH splits it into two angles of 41 degrees each. Then, looking at triangle FJH, which is a triangle with sides FJ, JH, and FH. Wait, but FJ is a side of the rhombus, so all sides are equal. So, FJ = FG = GH = HJ.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so FJ is a side, so FJ = FG = GH = HJ. So, triangle FJH would have two sides equal: FJ and HJ, each of length equal to the side of the rhombus. So, triangle FJH is isoceles with FJ = HJ, and angle at J is 82 degrees. Therefore, the base angles at F and H would be equal.

Wait, but the angle at J is 82, so the other two angles in triangle FJH would be (180 - 82)/2 = 49 degrees each. So, angles at F and H in triangle FJH are 49 degrees each.

But how does that help with angle KHJ? Hmm, maybe I should think about the triangles around point K.

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the four triangles formed are right-angled. So, in triangle FJH, the angle at J is 82 degrees, but in reality, the angle at J in the rhombus is split into two by the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angles at each vertex. Let's denote the angles at each vertex. Let's say angle F is 82 degrees, but wait, no, that's the angle at J. Wait, in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is 82, the adjacent angle is 180 - 82 = 98.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the given angle is one of the angles in the rhombus or just the angle at J.

Wait, the problem states that the diagonals intersect at K, and angle FJH is 82. So, point J is a vertex, and angle FJH is the angle at J between FJ and HJ. So, this angle is 82 degrees.

Since the diagonals bisect this angle, each of the two angles at J (FJH and JH... wait, no. Let me clarify: angle FJH is the angle between sides FJ and HJ at point J. So, the diagonal JH splits this angle into two equal parts. So, each of these parts would be 82/2 = 41 degrees.

So, in triangle FJH, the angle at J is 41 degrees, and the other two angles are at F and H. Since FJH is a triangle with sides FJ, JH, and FH, but since FJ = HJ (as all sides of the rhombus are equal), triangle FJH is an isosceles triangle with FJ = HJ, and base FH.

Wait, but in the rhombus, all sides are equal, so FJ = HJ, and JH is a side. So, triangle FJH is isoceles with two equal sides.

But wait, JH is a side of the rhombus, so FJH is a triangle with two sides equal to the sides of the rhombus, and the base JH.

Wait, no, in triangle FJH, JH is one side, FJ is another, and FH is the base. So, sides FJ and HJ are equal because they're sides of the rhombus. So, in triangle FJH, sides FJ and HJ are equal, making it an isosceles triangle with base FH and equal sides FJ and HJ.

Therefore, the base angles at F and H are equal. The angle at J is 41 degrees, so each of the other two angles (at F and H) is (180 - 41)/2 = 69.5 degrees. Hmm, but I'm not sure how this helps with finding angle KHJ.

Wait, perhaps looking at triangle KHJ. Point K is the intersection of the diagonals. In the rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so each diagonal is cut into two equal parts. So, K divides both diagonals into two equal lengths.

In triangle KHJ, which is part of the rhombus, the sides would be KJ, KH, and HJ. Wait, but KJ is half of diagonal JH, and KH is half of diagonal FH.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the properties of the rhombus's diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, each diagonal is split into two equal parts by the other.

So, when the two diagonals intersect at K, they form four right triangles: FKG, KGH, KJH, and KJF. Each of these has a right angle at K.

So, in triangle KJH, which is one of these right triangles, the sides are KJ, KH, and JH. JH is a side of the rhombus, let's say length 'a'. KJ is half of diagonal JH, so KJ = a/2.

Wait, but I don't know the lengths, so perhaps I should think about the angles.

Wait, in triangle KJH, the angle at K is 90 degrees, since the diagonals are perpendicular. The angle at J is 41 degrees, as per the earlier calculation (since angle FJH is 82, which is split into 41 and 41 by the diagonal). So, in triangle KJH, angle at J is 41 degrees, angle at K is 90 degrees, so the remaining angle at H must be 180 - 90 - 41 = 49 degrees.

Wait, but angle KHJ is at point H, between points K, H, J. So, in triangle KJH, the angle at H is angle KHJ. So, that would be 49 degrees.

Looking at the options, 49 is option E. So, the answer should be E: 49.

The diagonals of rhombus FGHJ intersect at K. Angle FJH is 82 degrees, which is split by the diagonal JH into two equal angles of 41 degrees each. In the right triangle KHJ, angle at J is 41 degrees, and angle at K is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle KHJ is 180 - 90 - 41 = 49 degrees.

Answer: E: 49
