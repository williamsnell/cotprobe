Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin. The options are given as A through J, and I have to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin is given by the formula sqrt(x² + y²). So, I need to minimize this distance for all points (x, y) that lie on the curve xy = 8. Since the square root function is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is the same as minimizing x² + y². That might be easier to work with.

Now, the curve is given by xy = 8. I can express y in terms of x: y = 8/x. Then, substituting that into the distance formula, I get the distance squared as x² + (8/x)². Let me write that down: D² = x² + (64)/(x²). So, I can consider D² as a function of x, let's call it f(x) = x² + 64/x².

To find the minimum distance, I need to find the minimum value of f(x). Since f(x) is a function of x, I can take its derivative with respect to x and set it to zero to find critical points.

Calculating f'(x), the derivative of x² is 2x, and the derivative of 64/x² is 64*(-2)/x³ = -128/x³. So, f'(x) = 2x - 128/x³.

Setting f'(x) equal to zero: 2x - 128/x³ = 0. Let me solve this equation.

Bring the second term to the other side: 2x = 128/x³. Multiply both sides by x³: 2x * x³ = 128 → 2x⁴ = 128. Divide both sides by 2: x⁴ = 64. Take the fourth root: x = sqrt(64^(1/4)). Wait, 64 is 2^6, so 64^(1/4) is 2^(6*(1/4)) = 2^(3/2) = sqrt(8). So x = sqrt(8) or x = -sqrt(8). But since we're dealing with real distances, and the original function xy=8 is symmetric in x and y, both positive and negative x might give the same distance. Let me just consider x positive for simplicity, so x = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2).

Now, substitute x = 2*sqrt(2) back into y = 8/x. So, y = 8/(2*sqrt(2)) = 4/sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(2). So both x and y are 2*sqrt(2).

Now, compute the distance from (2*sqrt(2), 2*sqrt(2)) to the origin. The distance is sqrt( (2√2)^2 + (2√2)^2 ). Calculating each term: (2√2)^2 is (4 * 2) = 8. So 8 + 8 = 16. The square root of 16 is 4. So the distance is 4.

Looking at the options, option A is 4. So the answer should be A.

The shortest distance from the curve \( xy = 8 \) to the origin is found by minimizing the distance function \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) for points on the curve. Substituting \( y = 8/x \) into the distance formula gives \( \sqrt{x^2 + (64/x^2)} \). To minimize this, we set the derivative \( f'(x) = 2x - 128/x^3 \) to zero, leading to \( x^4 = 64 \) and \( x = \sqrt{8} \). Substituting back, \( y = 2\sqrt{2} \), and the distance is \( \sqrt{(2\sqrt{2})^2 + (2\sqrt{2})^2} = 4 \). Thus, the answer is **A: 4**.
