Okay, I have this math problem to solve: 4/7 plus 2/7. Hmm, I think I remember that when adding fractions, if the denominators are the same, you just add the numerators. So, both fractions here have a denominator of 7, which is good because it means I can just add the numerators together.

So, 4 plus 2 is 6. Therefore, the sum should be 6/7. Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches 6/7. Let's go through the options.

Option A is 2/7, which is too small. The numerators are way off. Option B is 6/7, which matches what I calculated. Option C is 14/28, which seems like it could be simplified to 7/14, but that's not the same as 6/7. Option D is 6/14, which simplifies further to 3/7. So that's also not right. Option E is 1/2, which is different. Option F is 8/14, which is 4/7. No, because 4+2 is 6, not 8. Option G is 7/14, which is 0.5, or 1/2, which is not the same as 6/7. Option H is 10 over 7. Wait, 10/7 is more than 1, which doesn't make sense because adding two fractions less than 1 should give a fraction less than 2 but possibly more or less based on the numerators. 10/7 is about 1.428, but 6/7 is about 0.857. So H is not correct. Option I is 8 over 49, which is way too small. Option J is 4 over 14, which simplifies to 2/7.

So the only correct option is B: 6 over 7. I think that's right. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Adding 4/7 and 2/7, same denominator. 4+2=6, so 6/7. Yep, that's correct. I don't think any of the other options match. So the answer must be B.

The correct answer is B: 6 over 7.
