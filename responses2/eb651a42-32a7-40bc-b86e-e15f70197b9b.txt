Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me think about how to approach it. The question is, "What is the probability of throwing a 'six' with a single die?" The options are labeled A to I, and each option is a fraction. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcome is rolling a six. And the total possible outcomes are all the possible numbers a die can show.

A standard die has six faces, right? Each face has a number from 1 to 6. So, the total possible outcomes are 6. Now, the favorable outcome is just one: landing on a six. So, the probability should be 1 divided by 6.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/6. I think that's the right answer. Let me double-check. If I have a die, each number has an equal chance. So, the chance of any specific number, like six, is 1 out of 6. That makes sense, so the probability is 1/6.

The probability of rolling a six on a single die is 1/6, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
