Okay, so I've got this linear programming problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. The question is to maximize 3x + y, and there are some constraints given. The constraints are:

1. -x + y <= 1
2. 2x + y <= 4
3. x >= 0 and y >= 0.

Hmm, I remember that linear programming problems are about finding the maximum or minimum value of a linear function (like 3x + y) subject to certain linear constraints. The feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied, and the maximum or minimum will occur at one of the vertices of this region.

So, first, I need to plot these constraints to find the feasible region. Then, identify all the corner points (vertices) of this region. After that, evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum value.

Let me start by rewriting each inequality in a form that's easier to graph.

Starting with the first constraint: -x + y <= 1. Let me rearrange it to y. Adding x to both sides gives y <= x + 1. So this is a straight line with a slope of 1 and y-intercept at 1.

Second constraint: 2x + y <= 4. Rearranged, y <= -2x +4. So this line has a slope of -2 and y-intercept at 4.

And the non-negativity constraints: x >=0 and y >=0, so we're only considering the first quadrant.

Now, I need to find the feasible region. That's where all constraints are satisfied. So, I need to find the intersection points of these lines to determine the vertices.

Let me find the intercepts for each line.

For the first line (y = x +1):
- When x=0, y=1. So point (0,1).
- When y=0, 0 = x +1 → x = -1. But x can't be negative, so this point is not in the feasible region (since x must be >=0). So, the only relevant point here is (0,1).

For the second line (y = -2x +4):
- When x=0, y=4. So point (0,4).
- When y=0, 0 = -2x +4 → 2x=4 → x=2. So point (2,0).

Now, the feasible region is bounded by the lines y = x +1, y = -2x +4, and the axes. I need to find the intersection point of these two lines to find the corner.

To find where y = x +1 and y = -2x +4 meet, set them equal:

x +1 = -2x +4 → 3x = 3 → x=1. Then, y = 1 +1 = 2. So the intersection point is (1,2).

So, the feasible region's vertices are the points where these lines intersect each other and the axes. Let's list all possible vertices:

1. (0,1) from the first constraint's y-intercept.
2. (0,4) from the second constraint's y-intercept.
3. (1,2) from the intersection of the two lines.
4. (2,0) from the second constraint's x-intercept.

Wait, but I'm not sure if (0,4) is part of the feasible region. Let me check each constraint at (0,4):

- Constraint 1: -0 +4 =4 <=1? No, 4 is not <=1. So (0,4) is not in the feasible region. So I can't include that point.

So the feasible region's vertices are (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0).

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure. The feasible region is where all constraints are satisfied. So, the feasible region is bounded by the lines y = x +1 and y = -2x +4, and the axes.

So, the points that are vertices are:

- The intersection of y = x +1 and y = -2x +4: (1,2).
- The intersection of y = x +1 and y=0 (the x-axis? No, that's y=x+1 =0 → x=-1, which is not in the feasible region, so the x-axis line is y=0, and the feasible region on the x-axis is from (0,0) up to where y= x+1 and y=0 cross. Wait, no. Since y =x +1 intersects y=0 at x=-1 which is outside the feasible region (x>=0), so along the x-axis, the feasible region is from (0,0) up to where the other constraints cross.

Wait no, maybe I'm confusing. Let me approach this differently.

The feasible region is determined by all constraints. So, the constraints are:

1. y <= x+1
2. y <= -2x +4
3. x >=0
4. y >=0.

So, to find the feasible region, I can sketch these lines and see where all the inequalities are satisfied.

The lines are:

- y = x +1: passes through (0,1) and (1,2), etc.
- y = -2x +4: passes through (0,4) and (2,0).

Now, because x >=0 and y >=0, we're in the first quadrant.

The point (0,0) is part of all the constraints, but let's see if it's in the feasible region.

At (0,0):

1. y <= x+1 → 0 <=0+1 → 0<=1: yes.
2. y <= -2x +4 → 0 <=4: yes.
3. x >=0: yes.
4. y >=0: yes.

So (0,0) is a feasible point. But wait, is there a line or other constraint that would make it not feasible? Let me see.

Wait, what if I consider the intersection points of the constraints with each other. We've already got (1,2) as the intersection of the two lines. (0,1) is another point where the first constraint meets the y-axis.

Wait, but is (0,1) part of the feasible region? Let's check all constraints.

At (0,1):

1. y <= x+1 → 1 <=0+1 → 1<=1: yes.
2. y <= -2x +4 → 1 <=4: yes.
3. x >=0: yes.
4. y >=0: yes.

So (0,1) is a feasible point.

Now, the other constraint intersections:

- The second constraint (y = -2x +4) meets y=0 at x=2, so (2,0) is a feasible point.
- The first constraint (y =x +1) meets y=0 at x=-1, which is not feasible.

So the feasible region's vertices are:

1. (0,0): Where all constraints intersect at the origin.
2. (0,1): The intersection of the first constraint and the y-axis.
3. (1,2): The intersection of the two lines.
4. (2,0): The intersection of the second constraint and the x-axis.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. So the feasible region is bounded by all the lines and the axes.

So, the feasible region's vertices are the points where the boundaries meet each other and the axes.

So, the boundaries are:

- y = x +1 (from the first constraint)
- y = -2x +4 (second constraint)
- x=0 (y-axis)
- y=0 (x-axis)

The feasible region is where all these are true.

So, the feasible region is a polygon whose vertices are the points where these lines intersect each other or the axes.

So, let's find all the points where these lines intersect each other:

1. Intersection of y =x +1 and y=-2x +4: (1,2).
2. Intersection of y =x +1 and x=0: at (0,1).
3. Intersection of y =x +1 and y=0: but that's at x=-1, which is not in the feasible region because x >=0.
4. Intersection of y =-2x +4 and x=0: (0,4). But does this point satisfy all constraints?
   - y = -2(0) +4=4. So (0,4).
   Check constraints:
   1. y <= x +1 →4 <=0+1? No. So this point is not feasible.
5. Intersection of y =-2x +4 and y=0: (2,0).
   Check constraints:
   y=0 <= x+1 →0<=2+1=3: yes.
   y=0 <= -2x +4 →0 <=-4 +4=0: yes. So (2,0) is feasible.
6. Intersection of y =x +1 and y=0: x=-1, which isn't in the feasible region.
7. Intersection of x=0 and y=0: (0,0). Check all constraints:
   1. y <=x+1 →0<=0+1: yes.
   2. y <=-2x+4 →0<=4: yes.
   So (0,0) is a feasible point.

Wait, but wait, what about the line y =x +1 and the line y= -2x +4. The feasible region is bounded by these two lines and the axes.

So, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at:

(0,0) → because all constraints allow it.

(0,1) → because y =x+1 intersects the y-axis there.

(1,2) → intersection of the two lines.

(2,0) → intersection of y=-2x +4 with x-axis.

Now, I need to check if all these points are indeed vertices of the feasible region.

Wait, but (0,0) is also a vertex because the constraints don't exclude it. So the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,0).

Wait, but that would make sense. Now, I need to evaluate the objective function 3x + y at each of these points to find the maximum.

Let me list all the vertices:

1. (0,0): 3*0 +0 =0.
2. (0,1): 0 +1 =1.
3. (1,2): 3*1 +2 =5.
4. (2,0): 3*2 +0 =6.

So the maximum value is 6 at (2,0). Wait, but wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, but wait, the objective function is 3x + y. So (2,0) gives 6, which would be higher than (1,2) which is 5. So the maximum is at (2,0), with value 6.

But wait, let me think again. The feasible region is bounded by the lines, but is (2,0) the only point where the maximum occurs? Or are there other points?

Wait, but according to the feasible region, these are the four vertices. So the maximum of 3x + y is 6 at (2,0). So the optimal solution is (2,0).

Looking at the options, option J is [2, 2], which doesn't match. The correct option isn't listed, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options given are:

A: [1, 2]
B: [0, 1]
C: [1, 1]
D: [4, 0]
E: [3, 0]
F: [2, 0]
G: [0, 2]
H: [0,4]
I: [2,2]
J: [1,3]

So, option F is [2,0], which is the (2,0) point I found. So the correct answer should be F: [2,0].

Wait, but wait the options also include [1,2], which is point C, which gives 3*1+2=5. But 6 is higher than 5, so the correct maximum would be at (2,0).

So, the optimal solution is x=2, y=0. So the correct answer is F: [2,0].

To solve the linear programming problem, we need to maximize the objective function \( 3x + y \) subject to the constraints:

1. \( -x + y \leq 1 \)
2. \( 2x + y \leq 4 \)
3. \( x \geq 0 \)
4. \( y \geq 0 \)

### Step 1: Identify the feasible region
The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We rewrite the inequalities to graph them:

1. \( y \leq x + 1 \) (a line with slope 1 and y-intercept 1)
2. \( y \leq -2x + 4 \) (a line with slope -2 and y-intercept 4)
3. \( x \geq 0 \)
4. \( y \geq 0 \)

### Step 2: Find the vertices of the feasible region
The vertices are the intersection points of the lines and the axes:

1. Intersection of \( y = x + 1 \) and \( y = -2x + 4 \): Solve \( x + 1 = -2x + 4 \) → \( 3x = 3 \) → \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \). Point: \( (1, 2) \).
2. Intersection of \( y = x + 1 \) and \( x = 0 \): \( y = 1 \). Point: \( (0, 1) \).
3. Intersection of \( y = -2x + 4 \) and \( x = 0 \): \( y = 4 \). Point: \( (0, 4) \).
4. Intersection of \( y = -2x + 4 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( x = 2 \). Point: \( (2, 0) \).

However, \( (0, 4) \) is not feasible because it does not satisfy \( y \leq x + 1 \) (since \( 4 > 1 \)). Thus, the feasible vertices are:

1. \( (0, 0) \) (origin where all constraints intersect)
2. \( (0, 1) \) (intersection of \( y = x + 1 \) and \( x = 0 \))
3. \( (1, 2) \) (intersection of \( y = x + 1 \) and \( y = -2x + 4 \))
4. \( (2, 0) \) (intersection of \( y = -2x + 4 \) and \( x = 0 \))

### Step 3: Evaluate the objective function at each vertex
- At \( (0, 0) \): \( 3(0) + 0 = 0 \)
- At \( (0, 1) \): \( 3(0) + 1 = 1 \)
- At \( (1, 2) \): \( 3(1) + 2 = 5 \)
- At \( (2, 0) \): \( 3(2) + 0 = 6 \)

The maximum value of \( 3x + y \) is **6** at \( (2, 0) \).

### Final Answer
The optimal solution is \( [2, 0] \), which corresponds to option **F**.
