Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:

Options:

A: would remain preserved in the memories of the remaining species.
B: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.
C: would evolve into a different form or essence.
D: would be destroyed only if the species was eliminated by unnatural causes.
E: would be absorbed by another species.
F: would transform into the essence of another existing species.
G: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.
H: would exist as long as there are traces or remnants of the species left in the world.
I: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.
J: would likewise be destroyed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Aristotle's philosophy. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. 

The first part says that Aristotle believes the essence or form of things isn't just about individuals in the world but also about the individuals themselves. Wait, no, actually, I think I remember something about the difference between being individual and being universal. So, Aristotle might be saying that the essence or form isn't just about the individual but also about the essence that defines each individual. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you choose." Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

So the question is about what makes things be what they are, their essence. Aristotle says that the essence doesn't exist apart from individuals in the world. So that's confusing. Normally, I think things like people have essence or qualities like being human. But if the question says that the essence doesn't exist apart from individuals, then maybe it's saying that the essence isn't something that's separate from the individuals. So, perhaps the essence is part of the individual.

Wait, the question says that if all members of a species were destroyed, what would happen to their essence. So, if the essence isn't a separate entity, then without individuals, the essence can't exist. So when a species is destroyed, perhaps the individuals no longer exist, and therefore their essence also can't exist.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.

Wait, the wording says 'there were no essence or form originally'—so if there's no original essence, then destroying the species would mean no original form to destroy. That makes sense. So the essence was part of the individuals, which are now gone. So without the essence, the species can't exist anymore. So the destruction would eliminate the essence, but the question is about their 'essence'—so the original essence was part of each individual. So when the species is destroyed, the individuals are gone, so their essence (which were part of them) would be gone too. So the species can't exist anymore. So option B says that it wouldn't be destroyed because there's no original essence. That seems right.

Other options: Option A says the essence remains in memories of remaining species. But if the species is destroyed, there are no individuals, so the memory wouldn't exist. So A is incorrect. Option C says they would evolve into a different form, but I think the essence is the form, not evolution. So C is wrong. Option D: would be destroyed if eliminated by unnatural causes. That's not what the question says. The question doesn't mention unnatural causes; it's about the essence not existing apart from individuals. So D is making an assumption about the world, which the question isn't addressing. Option E: would be absorbed by another species. I don't think that's what Aristotle says. Absorption might be another concept, but I don't think that's the case here. Option F: transform into the essence of another species. That's not what the question states. The question is about the essence existing or not. Option G: would be destroyed only if there were no one around. That doesn't make sense because without the individuals, the essence can't exist. So G is incorrect. Option H: would exist in another realm. No, that's Platonism, which I don't think is relevant here. Option I: as with Plato's Forms. No, I don't think that's what the question is about. Option J: would be destroyed. That's what I thought earlier, but I need to make sure. So in J, the species would be destroyed if the individuals are gone. So the correct answer is B and J. 

Wait, the question is about what makes things be what they are—the essence. So if the species is destroyed, the individuals are gone, so their essence (the form) can't exist. Therefore, the species can't exist anymore. So the answer is B and J. But the options are separate. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are A to J. The question is about what would happen if all the members are destroyed. So the correct answer is B and J. But looking at the options, option B says that the essence would not be destroyed because there's no original form. So that's correct. Option J says they would be destroyed, which is the opposite. So J is incorrect. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, the options are single choices. So the question is, which answer is correct? So the possible correct answers are B and J. But in the options, only one can be chosen.

Wait, the question states that the last character of the response must be the letter chosen. So the correct option is either B or J.

Wait, the question is asking what makes things be what they are—in this case, their essence, which is tied to individuals. So when the species is destroyed, there are no individuals left, so the essence (which were part of them) can't exist. So they wouldn't be destroyed because the essence was there. So option B says the essence would not be destroyed because there was no original form. So the species would survive because their essence (which is the form) was there. So B is correct. Option J says they would be destroyed, which is the opposite. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. If the species is destroyed, the individuals are gone. The essence, which were part of the individuals, would also be gone because the individuals are gone. So the essence (the form) can't exist. So the species isn't going to exist anymore. But option B says "would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed." So the destruction caused by losing the species would eliminate the original form. So without the form, the species can't exist. So the answer is B.

But another option, J, says the species would be destroyed. So if the world is considering that without the individuals, the essence can't exist, then the species can't exist. So J is saying that the species would be destroyed, so it's the opposite. So B and J are both correct, but in the options, only one is chosen. Since the options are provided as separate letters, I think the correct answer is B. But wait, J is the opposite, so it's incorrect. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option B says that the essence would not be destroyed because there was no original form. So in the species' destruction, the original form (the essence) is gone. So the species can't exist anymore. So B is correct.

So the answer is B.

The question concerns Aristotle's view that the essence or form of things is not separate from individuals, as individuals define their essence. If all members of a species are destroyed, the individuals (and thus their essence) would also be gone. This means the species cannot exist anymore. Among the options, B correctly states that the essence would not be destroyed because there was no original form to destroy. J is incorrect because it suggests the species would be destroyed, which contradicts the reasoning. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Answer: B
