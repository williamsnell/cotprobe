Alright, so I've got this logic problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about translating the sentence "José introduces Wilma to Kevin" into predicate logic. The options are A through E, each with different predicate expressions.

First, I need to break down the sentence. The main components are José, Wilma, and Kevin. José is introducing Wilma to Kevin. So, the main idea is that José is the initiator of introducing Wilma to Kevin.

The given predicate is Ixyz, which I think stands for "x introduces y to z." So, the function takes three arguments: the person who introduces (x), the person being introduced (y), and the person to whom they are introduced (z).

Now, let's translate the sentence. The subject is Wilma, the object of introduction is Kevin, and the one doing the introduction is José. So, in terms of the predicate, José is x, Wilma is y, and Kevin is z. So, the predicate would be Ijwk, because x is José (j), y is Wilma (w), and z is Kevin (k).

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the order right. The predicate is Ixyz, which is x introduces y to z. So, for José (j) introducing Wilma (w) to Kevin (k), the expression would be Ijwk. That makes sense because x is j, y is w, z is k.

Looking at the options, D is Ijwk, which matches what I just thought. Let me look at the other options to be sure. Option A is Ijkw. Wait, that would mean José introduces Wilma (w) to Kevin (k), but the second part is Kevin. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh wait, no, because Ijkw would be José introduces Wilma to Kevin, right? Wait—no, that's the same as Ijwk. Because in Ijkw, x is j, y is w, z is k. So Ijkw is the same as Ijwk, so both A and D could be considered. Wait that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the order. The predicate is Ixyz, where x is the one introducing, y is the person being introduced, z is the one to whom. So for José introducing Wilma to Kevin, it's Ijwk, because x is j, y is w, z is k. So D is correct.

Let me look at the options again. Option A is Ijkw. That would be x=j, y=k, z=w. So that translates to José introduces Kevin to Wilma. But the original sentence says Wilma is being introduced to Kevin. So A would be incorrect because it's the reverse.

Option B is Iwkj. That's x=w, y=k, z=j. So Wilma introduces Kevin to José. Not the opposite.

Option C is Iwjk. x=w, y=j, z=k. So Wilma introduces José to Kevin. Again, not matching.

Option E is Ikjw. That's x=k, y=j, z=w. So Kevin introduces José to Wilma. Nope, that's not what's happening.

So the correct one is D: Ijwk. Because the person introducing is José (j), Wilma is the one being introduced (w), and Kevin is the one to whom he is introduced (k). So the correct answer is D.

The correct translation of the sentence is "José introduces Wilma to Kevin," which corresponds to the predicate Ijwk. This is because the subject is Wilma, the object is Kevin, and José is the one introducing. 

Answer: D: Ijwk
