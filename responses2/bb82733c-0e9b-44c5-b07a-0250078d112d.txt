Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution in terms of power. Let's see, I need to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking what power was granted to the states by the Articles of Confederation but not by the Constitution. The options are A through I. I remember that the Constitution has the power to tax, but the Articles of Confederation don't. So, I think the key here is to compare the powers of both systems.

The Articles of Confederation were a system established before the Constitution. I recall that the Articles granted Congress the power to tax, but each state still had to pay its fair share. So, states couldn't tax citizens directly; they had to pay their fair share. This wasn't the case under the Constitution, which had the power to tax directly. So, the power of direct taxation from the Constitution isn't in the Articles.

Looking at the options, option H is the power to tax citizens directly. That seems to fit because the Constitution does have that, whereas the Articles don't. Let me make sure the other options make sense. Option A is about enforcing national laws. Both systems probably enforce laws, but the Constitution has more authority. Option B is about amendments, but both systems can amend. Option C is foreign relations, which both systems might have some influence on, but the question is about the specific power. Option D is coin money, but that's probably handled differently. Option E is about declaring war, which is more of a federal power. Option F is appealing to Congress, which is part of the federal system, so probably not unique to either. Option G is regulating interstate commerce, which the Constitution does have. Option I is about representation in Congress, which both do, but not the specific power we're looking for. Option J isn't even an option here. 

So, the correct answer should be H: The power to tax citizens directly. This is because the Constitution explicitly grants that power, while the Articles don't. So, the states don't have that power under the Articles of Confederation, but the Constitution does.

The correct answer is H: The power to tax citizens directly. The Constitution grants this power, whereas the Articles of Confederation do not.

Answer: H
