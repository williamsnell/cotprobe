Okay, so I have this calculus problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that p(x) is the product of f(x) and g(x), so p(x) = f(x) * g(x). They give me some values at x=2: f(2)=3, f’(2)=-4, g(2)=1, and g’(2)=6. I need to find p’(2).

Hmm, I remember that when you have a product of two functions, you need to use the product rule for differentiation. The product rule says that the derivative of p(x) is f’(x) times g(x) plus f(x) times g’(x). So p’(x) = f’(x)g(x) + f(x)g’(x).

Right, so to find p’(2), I plug in x=2 into that equation. Let me write down the values I have:

f(2) = 3,
f’(2) = -4,
g(2) = 1,
g’(2) = 6.

So substituting into the product rule formula:
p’(2) = f’(2)*g(2) + f(2)*g’(2)
= (-4)*1 + 3*6
= (-4) + 18
= 14.

Wait, so p’(2) equals 14. Let me check if I did that right. Yeah, (-4)*1 is -4, and 3*6 is 18. Adding them together gives 14. So the correct answer should be 14. Looking at the options, E is 14. So I think E is the right choice.

To find \( p'(2) \) where \( p(x) = f(x)g(x) \), we use the product rule:

\[
p'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
\]

Substituting \( x = 2 \) and the given values:

\[
p'(2) = f'(2)g(2) + f(2)g'(2) = (-4)(1) + (3)(6) = -4 + 18 = 14
\]

The correct answer is \( \boxed{E} \).
