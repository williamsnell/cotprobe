Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the heat required to raise the temperature of water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: What's the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gallon of water (which is 3.78 liters) from 10°C to 80°C. The options are A to J, all Kcal values.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. I remember something about specific heat capacity. Oh right, the formula is Q = m * c * ΔT. Where Q is the heat, m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

But wait, what's the specific heat capacity of water? Oh yeah, I think it's around 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. Or maybe around 1 kcal/kg°C? Because I might have mixed that up. Let me think. Calorific values are often given per kilogram. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 calorie per gram is higher than per kilogram because a gram is smaller. Oh, but specific heat capacity—water's specific heat is about 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. Or perhaps 1 kcal/kg. Wait, no, wait. So I think 1 calorie per gram is about 1 kcal/kg. Because 1 kg is 1000g, so 1 cal/g = 1000 cal/kg. Or wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify.

The specific heat capacity (c) for water is approximately 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius (1 cal/g°C). Alternatively, since 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, 1 kcal/kg would be 1000 cal/g. Hmm, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, 1 cal is equal to about 4.184 joules, right? And 1 calorie per gram per degree is a lot. But perhaps it's better to use the correct values.

Wait, I think the specific heat of water is about 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. So c = 1 cal/(g·°C). Or perhaps 1 kcal/(kg·°C) since 1 kcal is 1000 cal. So 1 cal/g°C is 1 cal/(g°C) = 1000 cal/(kg°C). So, let's go with that.

So, first, I need to find the mass of the water. The question says it's one gallon, which is 3.78 liters. Wait, but wait, what's the density of water? Right, density of water is about 1 kg per liter. So 3.78 liters would be 3.78 kg. Because 1 liter is 1 kg for water.

So mass (m) = 3.78 kg.

The temperature change (ΔT) is 80°C minus 10°C, which is 70°C.

Now, using Q = m * c * ΔT.

So plug in the numbers.

c = 1 cal/(g°C) which is 1000 cal/(kg°C).

Wait, so wait: If c is 1 cal/(g°C), then for 3.78 kg, that's 3.78 * 1000 = 3780 cal/(°C) ?

Wait, no, that can't be right because 1 cal per gram per degree would mean that for 3.78 kg (3780 grams), the heat capacity would be 3780 cal/°C.

But wait, let me think again. Because 1 cal is 4.184 J, but perhaps I don't need to convert units here. Let me proceed.

So, Q = m * c * ΔT.

m = 3.78 kg.

c is 1 cal/(g°C) = 1000 cal/(kg°C).

ΔT = 70°C.

So, Q = 3.78 kg * 1000 cal/(kg·°C) *70°C.

The kg cancels out, so 3.78 * 1000 *70.

3.78 * 70 is let's see: 3 *70=210, 0.78 *70=54.6 → 210+54.6=264.6.

Multiply by 1000: 264.6 * 1000 = 264600 cal.

Wait, but the question asks for Kcal. Because 1 Kcal is 1000 cal.

So 264600 cal = 264.6 Kcal.

Looking at the options: 

Option F is 180, G is 265, H is 330, etc. So 264.6 is closest to 265 Kcal. So the answer would be option G.

Wait, but wait, another way: Maybe I made a mistake in the specific heat capacity. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think I misremembered. The specific heat capacity of water is actually about 1.000 (cal/g°C). Or wait, perhaps it's 1 cal/(g·°C), as I thought before. So 1 cal per gram per degree Celsius.

Wait, but sometimes the specific heat capacity is given as 1 cal/(g°C). So yes, 1 cal/g°C, which is 1000 cal/kg°C.

Wait, but I've seen some values where it's 1 kcal/(kg°C), which is 1000 cal/(kg°C). So that's the same as 1000 cal/(kg·°C).

Wait, in any case, the calculation above leads to about 265 Kcal, which is option G.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, sometimes in these problems, the specific heat is considered as 1 kcal/(kg·°C). So let me recalculate with that.

Because if c is 1 kcal/(kg·°C), then the calculation is:

Q = 3.78 kg * 1 kcal/(kg·°C) *70°C.

So 3.78 *70 = 264.6, which is 264.6 Kcal. So that's option G, 265 Kcal.

So the correct answer is G.

To calculate the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one gallon of water (3.78 liters) from 10°C to 80°C, we use the formula:

\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]

### Step 1: Determine the mass of the water
The density of water is approximately **1 kg/L**, so 3.78 liters corresponds to **3.78 kg** of water.

### Step 2: Calculate the temperature change
The temperature change is:

\[
\Delta T = 80^\circ \text{C} - 10^\circ \text{C} = 70^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 3: Use the specific heat capacity of water
The specific heat capacity of water is approximately **1 kcal/(kg·°C)**. Thus, the formula becomes:

\[
Q = 3.78 \, \text{kg} \cdot 1 \, \text{kcal/(kg·°C)} \cdot 70 \, ^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
\[
Q = 3.78 \cdot 70 = 264.6 \, \text{kcal}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the options
The calculated value of **264.6 kcal** is closest to **265 kcal**, which corresponds to option **G**.
