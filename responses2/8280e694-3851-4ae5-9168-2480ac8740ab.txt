Okay, so I've got this problem about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that when light is shone on a metal, electrons are ejected. The energy needed to get them out is the ionization energy. Oh right, the question here is about krypton, and the wavelength is 58.4 nm. The speed of the electrons after ejection is given as 1.59e6 m/s. I think I need to calculate the ionization energy using the energy of the photon and the kinetic energy of the electrons.

Wait, the formula for photoelectric effect is something like the energy of the photon equals the work function (ionization energy) plus the kinetic energy of the electrons. Oh right, E_photon = phi + KE_electron. So, to find phi, the ionization energy, I subtract the kinetic energy from the photon's energy.

First, I need to find the energy of the photon. The wavelength is given as 58.4 nm. I remember that the energy of a photon is E = hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. But wait, the units here are in nm. I should convert that to meters because the SI units for energy would be joules. Oh right, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters. So lambda is 58.4e-9 meters.

Planck's constant, h, is 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3.0e8 m/s. So plugging in, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (58.4e-9). Let me compute that. The numerator is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 58.4e-9. So 1.9878e-25 / 5.84e-8 = approximately 3.41e-18 J. Hmm, but that's in joules. I think I should convert that to electron volts because the options are in eV.

Oh wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert, divide the energy in joules by 1.602e-19. So 3.41e-18 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 21.3 eV.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 3.41e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (3.41 / 0.1602) eV. Wait, 3.41 divided by 0.1602. Let me calculate that: 3.41 / 0.1602 ≈ 21.3 eV. Hmm, because 0.16 * 21 is 3.36, so 21.3 would give 3.4116...

Wait, but wait, 58.4 nm is in the ultraviolet range. I think the ionization energy of krypton might be higher than that of aluminum, which is about 57.8 eV. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Let me think about the ionization energies of other elements. Aluminum is around 58 eV, so krypton is higher. Oh, because as you go across a period, ionization energies increase. So for krypton, the ionization energy should be higher than that of aluminum.

Wait, when I calculated this photon energy, I got about 21 eV. But the options don't have exactly 21. The options are given as something like 10, 15, 16, 18, 20, etc.

Wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. The photon energy is E = (hc)/lambda. Let's compute it again.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

lambda is 58.4 nm =58.4e-9 m. So E= (1.9878e-25) / (58.4e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 5.84e-8 = approx 3.41e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 3.41e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.41 / 0.1602 → since 1e-18 /1e-19 is 10, so 3.41 * 10 / 0.1602 → wait no, 3.41e-18 / 1.602e-19 is (3.41 /0.1602) *1e (because 1e-18 /1e-19 is 10^1=10). So 3.41 /0.1602 is about 21.3, multiplied by 10 gives 213 eV? Wait that can't be right because that would be way higher than any of the options. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me compute (6.626e-34)(3e8) = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 58.4e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 58.4e-9.

Wait, 58.4e-9 is 5.84e-8 m.

So 1.9878e-25 /5.84e-8 = (1.9878 /5.84) * 1e-17.

1.9878 /5.84 is about 0.341. So 0.341e-17 = 3.41e-18 J.

So that's the same result as before. Then converting to eV, 3.41e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (3.41 / 0.1602) *10^ ( -18 +19 ) → 3.41 /0.1602 = approx 21.3 → 21.3 *10 = 213 eV? Wait no, because 3.41e-18 /1.602e-19 J/eV = (3.41e-18) / (1.602e-19) = (3.41 / 1.602) * (1e-18 /1e-19) → 3.41/1.602 is about 2.13, multiplied by 10 gives 21.3 eV.

Wait, but that can't be right because my earlier thought that krypton's ionization energy is higher than that of aluminum. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check the ionization energy of krypton.

Wait, I think the ionization energy of krypton is around 108.5 eV. Oh wait, so my calculation gives 21 eV, which is much lower than that. That can't be right. So what's wrong here?

Wait, wait a second. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Oh no! The formula is E_photon = phi + KE. So, phi = E_photon - KE.

Wait, but if E_photon is 21 eV and the KE is 1.59e6 m/s, which is 1.59e6 m/s. Wait, let me compute that speed in terms of energy.

KE = (1/2) m v^2. So m is the mass of an electron, which is 9.109e-31 kg.

v = 1.59e6 m/s.

So, KE = 0.5 * 9.109e-31 kg * (1.59e6)^2.

Let me compute that:

(1.59e6)^2 = about (1.59)^2 *1e12 = 2.5281e12.

Multiply by 0.5: 1.264e12.

Multiply by 9.109e-31: 1.264e12 *9.109e-31 = (1.264 *9.109) *1e-19.

1.264 *9.109 ≈ 11.534.

So 11.534e-19 J. Convert to eV: 11.534e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈7.2 eV.

Wait, so the kinetic energy is about 7.2 eV. Then the photon energy must be higher than that. But I calculated the photon energy as 21 eV. Hmm, so 21 eV is higher than 7.2 eV, so that makes sense.

But then, the ionization energy would be 21 eV minus 7.2 eV? Wait, no, because the formula is E_photon = phi + KE. So phi = E_photon - KE. So 21 eV -7.2 eV =13.8 eV. So about 14 eV, which is option C. That seems to fit.

Wait, but why did I get 21 eV when I computed the photon energy? Because 58.4 nm has a photon energy of 21 eV. But wait, wait, wait! Oh, wait a minute. I think I must have messed up the calculation of the photon energy. Let me recheck.

Wait, the calculation again: h c /lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c =3e8 m/s.

lambda =58.4e-9 m.

So hc =6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by lambda: 1.9878e-25 /58.4e-9 = (1.9878 /58.4) *1e-16 → wait, 1e-25 /1e-9 = 1e-16.

Wait, 1.9878 divided by 58.4 is approximately 0.0341. So 0.0341 *1e-16 → 3.41e-18 J. So that's correct.

Convert to eV: 3.41e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (3.41 /0.1602) *10 → 21.3 *10 =213 eV. Wait, no! Because 1e-18 divided by 1e-19 is 10, so 3.41e-18 /1.602e-19 = (3.41/0.1602) * (1e-18 /1e-19) )= (21.3) *10 → 213 eV.

Wait, no, because 3.41e-18 /1.602e-19 = (3.41 / 1.602) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) → 3.41/1.602 is about 2.13, and 1e-18/1e-19 =10. So 2.13 *10=21.3 eV. Oh! So the photon energy is 21.3 eV. But wait, earlier I thought that would make the ionization energy about 21 eV, but the options don't have that. The options are A:10; B:20; C:14 etc.

Hmm. So according to this, phi would be 21.3 eV, but that's not an option. So I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the wavelength. Wait, 58.4 nm is 58.4 angstroms. That's in the ultraviolet range, but krypton's ionization energy is higher than that of aluminum, which is around 58 eV. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: use the correct formula. The correct formula is E_photon = phi + KE. So phi = E_photon - KE.

But the photon energy is 21 eV. The kinetic energy is about 7.2 eV. So 21 eV -7.2 eV =13.8 eV. So about 14 eV. So option C.

But wait, earlier I thought my calculation of the photon energy was 21 eV because of a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 58.4 nm is 58.4e-9 m. So when I compute E = hc / lambda.

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8.

So 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 58.4e-9 m:

1.9878e-25 / 58.4e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 5.84e-8 = (1.9878/5.84) * 1e-17.

1.9878 /5.84 ≈ 0.341. So 0.341e-17→ 3.41e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 3.41e-18 /1.602e-19 = approx 21.3 eV.

So that's correct. So E_photon is 21.3 eV. Then, the KE is 7.2 eV. So phi is 21.3 -7.2 = 14.1 eV.

So the correct ionization energy is approximately 14 eV, which is option C.

To calculate the ionization energy of krypton, we use the photoelectric effect equation:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \phi + KE_{\text{electron}}
\]

where \( E_{\text{photon}} \) is the energy of the photon, \( \phi \) is the ionization energy, and \( KE_{\text{electron}} \) is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. Rearranging for \( \phi \):

\[
\phi = E_{\text{photon}} - KE_{\text{electron}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy of the photon
The energy of a photon is given by:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 58.4 \, \text{nm} = 58.4 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength).

Substituting the values:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{58.4 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
\]

Now divide by the wavelength:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{58.4 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.41 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{3.41 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = 21.3 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the kinetic energy of the electron
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:

\[
KE_{\text{electron}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

where:
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of an electron),
- \( v = 1.59 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) (velocity of the electron).

Substitute the values:

\[
KE_{\text{electron}} = \frac{1}{2} (9.109 \times 10^{-31})(1.59 \times 10^6)^2
\]

First, calculate \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = (1.59 \times 10^6)^2 = 2.5281 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now calculate \( KE_{\text{electron}} \):

\[
KE_{\text{electron}} = \frac{1}{2} (9.109 \times 10^{-31})(2.5281 \times 10^{12}) = 7.2 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the ionization energy of krypton
Using the photoelectric effect equation:

\[
\phi = E_{\text{photon}} - KE_{\text{electron}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\phi = 21.3 \, \text{eV} - 7.2 \, \text{eV} = 14.1 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Final Answer:
The ionization energy of krypton is approximately **14 eV**, which corresponds to option **C**.
