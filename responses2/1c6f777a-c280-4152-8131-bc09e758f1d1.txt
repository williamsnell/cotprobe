Okay, so I need to find the probability of getting four of a kind in a poker hand. Hmm, let's see. I remember that poker hands involve combinations, so I should probably use combinations to calculate this.

First, the total number of possible 5-card hands from a 52-card deck. I think that's calculated using combinations, specifically 52 choose 5. Let me write that down: total = C(52,5). I can calculate that later.

Now, for four of a kind. I need to choose four cards of the same value and one card of a different value. Let's break it into steps.

Step 1: Choose the value for the four of a kind. There are 13 possible values (like Ace, 2, ..., King). So, 13 choices here.

Step 2: Choose the four suits for this value. Since there are four suits, we need to choose 4 out of 4, which is C(4,4) = 1. So, no choice here; all four suits are already chosen.

Step 3: Now, choose the fifth card, which has to be a different value. There are 12 remaining values (since we already used one). For each of these, we need to choose one suit. So, 12 choices for the value, and for each, 4 suits available. So, that's 12 * 4 = 48 options.

Putting this all together, the number of four of a kinds is 13 (for the four) multiplied by 1 (for the suits) multiplied by 12 (for the fifth card's value) multiplied by 4 (for the suits). So, total favorable outcomes = 13 * 1 * 12 * 4.

Wait, let me calculate that: 13 * 12 is 156, times 4 is 624. So, 624 possible four of a kinds.

Now, the total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5). Let me compute that. C(52,5) is (52*51*50*49*48)/(5*4*3*2*1). Let me compute that step by step.

Calculating the numerator: 52 * 51 = 2652; 2652 *50=132600; 132600 *49=6497400; 6497400 *48=311,875,200.

Denominator: 5*4=20; 20*3=60; 60*2=120; 120*1=120. So, 311,875,200 / 120. Let me compute that: 311,875,200 divided by 120. 311,875,200 ÷ 120 = 2,598,960. So, total possible hands are 2,598,960.

So, the probability is (624) / (2,598,960). Let me compute this division. Hmm.

Calculating 624 / 2,598,960. Let me see: 2,598,960 divided by 624. Well, 624 * 4150 = 2,598,960. Wait, no, wait, 624 × 4150 is more than that. Let me do it step by step.

Divide numerator and denominator by 48 to simplify. 624 ÷48=13; 2,598,960 ÷48=54,145. So, 13 / 54,145. Hmm, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, 624 / 2,598,960 equals approximately 0.000240096. Wait, let me compute 624 ÷ 2,598,960.

Well, 2,598,960 ÷ 624 = let me compute 2,598,960 ÷624. I can approximate: 624 * 4150=2,598,960? Let me check: 624 * 4000=2,496,000. 624 * 150=93,600. So, 2,496,000 +93,600=2,589,600. Hmm, but 2,598,960 is higher. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute 624 / 2,598,960.

Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 12: 624 ÷12=52; 2,598,960 ÷12=216,580. So, 52 / 216,580. Hmm, still not so helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I'll just compute 624 / 2,598,960. Let me compute 624 ÷ 2,598,960. Well, 624 ÷2,598,960 = 0.000240096. So approximately 0.0002401.

Looking at the options, the choices are in the 0.00003 to 0.00036 range. Wait, 0.00024 is approximately 0.000240, which is close to 0.00024. But none of the options exactly match 0.000240. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A: 0.00012
B: 0.00009
C: 0.00015
D: 0.00006
E: 0.00018
F: 0.00024
G: 0.00048
H: 0.00003
I: 0.00036
J: 0.00030

Wait, option F is 0.00024. So that would be approximately 0.00024. But wait, I calculated 0.000240 approximately. So option F is 0.00024, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. 624 divided by 2,598,960. Let me compute this as: 624 / 2,598,960.

Divide numerator and denominator by 24: 624 ÷24=26; 2,598,960 ÷24=108,290. So, 26 / 108,290 ≈ 0.000240096. Hmm, so about 0.0002401.

Looking back at the options, the closest is F: 0.00024. But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the number of four of a kinds. Wait, 13 choices for the value, 1 way to choose the suits, 12 choices for the fifth value, 4 suits. 13 * 12 *4 = 624. That seems correct.

Wait, but in the options, is 0.00024 an option? Yes, it's option F. So, the correct answer should be F: 0.00024.

The probability of four of a kind is calculated by considering the number of ways to choose the four-of-a-kind cards and the fifth card. The number of four-of-a-kind hands is 13 * 12 * 4 = 624. The total number of possible 5-card hands is C(52,5) = 2,598,960. The probability is 624 / 2,598,960 ≈ 0.00024, which corresponds to option F.

F: 0.00024
