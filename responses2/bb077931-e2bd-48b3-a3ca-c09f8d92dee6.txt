Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Purusa-Sukta"
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Okay, so I have this question about the caste system and the options given. I'm a bit rusty on my Vedic studies, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option would best contradict the argument that the caste system imposes rigid roles on society, especially from 600 BCE to 600 CE. The argument is about how the caste system restricts economic and social roles, so the question is looking for something that shows the opposite—something that supports the caste system's rigid nature.

Looking at the options:

A: The Bhagavad Gita says one's duty is determined by their caste. Hmm, I remember the Gita has teachings about self-realization and the role of caste. It might support the idea that caste dictates their path, so this might contradict the argument that the caste system imposes rigid roles.

B: Brahmins were given the highest status because they were priests. That definitely supports rigid roles. They were the ones who dictated the caste hierarchy, so this contradicts the argument.

C: Ancient texts describe Sudras as servants. I'm not sure. Sudras were women, right? The Sudra people were mentioned in the context of their social roles, but the text doesn't specifically say they were servants. They were a middle class, and their role was more about service in certain ways, maybe not just servitude. So this might contradict the idea that they were rigid roles.

D: The Rig Veda shows the caste system as divine. The Veda does describe the caste system, emphasizing their importance. So this does support the rigid roles, so it's not the answer.

E: The Ramayana is an epic by a prince, but that's more about literature and doesn't directly relate to the caste system. So probably not the answer.

F: For Kshatriya (Mukhi), better than righteous battle. This seems more about individual morality and struggle, not social roles. Doesn't directly contradict the caste system.

G: The Mahabarata is a text by a man, not an epic by a prince. So this doesn't fit.

H: The four divisions of society, created by Krishna, are about reality and nature, not caste. So this doesn't directly relate.

I: Shiva is both creator, preserver, and destroyer. That's more about his role as the Sun God, not the caste system.

J: The Manusmriti (Siddhartha Upanishad) describes caste. It's a text that's often credited with establishing the caste system as a divine order. So this would support the rigid roles, not contradict.

So the options that contradict the argument are A, B, and C. But which is the best? The question asks for the one that best contradicts the argument.

The argument is that the caste system imposes rigid roles. So which option shows a different outcome?

Option A suggests that the Gita affects duty, which could imply that the caste system dictates their roles, so the opposite would be that they don't, meaning the argument is wrong.

Option B says Brahmins are highest, which supports rigid roles.

Option C says Sudras are servants, which might not fit, as Sudras are a middle class, not servants.

Option A's statement would indicate that the caste system doesn't impose rigid roles, which would contradict the argument. So if the argument is that the system imposes rigid roles, A would be the best contradictory choice.

The question asks which option best contradicts the argument that the caste system imposes rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE. The argument suggests that the caste system rigidly dictates roles. The best contradictory option would be one that shows the opposite, indicating the system doesn't impose rigid roles.

- **A**: The Bhagavad Gita's teachings could imply that caste affects duty, contradicting the rigid roles.
- **B**: Brahmins being highest status supports rigid roles.
- **C**: Sudras being servants might not fit, as they were middle class.
- **D**: The Veda's depiction of caste hierarchy supports rigid roles.
- **E**: Ramayana being by a prince is irrelevant.
- **F**: The epic's focus on morality doesn't contradict.
- **G**: The Veda's mention of the caste system supports rigid roles.
- **H**: The epic by a man isn't related.
- **I**: Shiva's roles don't relate to caste.
- **J**: The Manusmriti describes caste, supporting rigid roles.

The best contradiction is **A**, as it suggests the caste system doesn't rigidly dictate roles, challenging the argument.

**Answer: A**
