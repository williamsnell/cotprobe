Okay, so I'm trying to figure out who wrote the lyrics for Frank Sinatra's anthem 'My Way'. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I know that 'My Way' is a classic rock song and it's part of Frank Sinatra's collection of country rock hits. The question is asking about the lyricist, not the artist, so I'm looking for the person who originally wrote the music, not just the artist's name.

I remember that Frank Sinatra was a jazz musician and also known for his country rock work. The song 'My Way' is a big hit, so it must have been covered by others. I've heard that it was covered by Johnny Cash, but wait, wasn't that the cover by the other members of the Sinatra Quartet? Let me recall: the original song was written by Johnny Cash, and then the group covered it in the 80s. 

Wait, another thought. I'm a bit confused. The question is about who wrote the lyrics, so it's Johnny Cash. Alternatively, I think the cover was by the group, but the original song was written by him. So I think the correct answer is B: Johnny Cash. 

But wait, I recall that the cover was by the group, but the original song's lyrics were written by Johnny Cash. So the correct answer should be B. Let me confirm: Frank Sinatra wrote the song, and it's covered by the group, but the lyrics belong to Johnny Cash. So yes, the person is Johnny Cash.
