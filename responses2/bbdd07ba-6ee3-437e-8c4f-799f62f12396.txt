Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric dipole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is an electric dipole consisting of two equal but opposite point charges. Each has a magnitude of 4.0 nC. Oh wait, nC is nano coulombs, right? So 1 nC is 1e-9 C. But wait, I don't think that's directly relevant here, but I should keep that in mind.

The distance between the two charges is 2.0 cm. Oh, right, I should probably convert that to meters because the electric field is in V/m. So 2 cm is 0.02 meters.

The question is about the electric field strength at the midpoint between the charges. Wait, but wait a second. In an electric dipole, the charges are separated, and the midpoint is exactly between them. So what would the electric field be there?

I remember that electric fields from point charges add vectorially. So if both charges are +4nC and -4nC, then each has their own electric field at the midpoint.

Wait, but wait—electric field is a vector. So for the positive charge, its field would point away from it, and the negative charge's field would point toward it. But since they're both at the same point, the midpoint, the directions would be opposite.

So the positive charge is at one end, the negative at the other. So the midpoint is exactly halfway between them. Let me imagine the dipole as one end positive and the other negative, and the midpoint is in the middle.

So the positive charge is +4nC, the negative is -4nC. The midpoint is equidistant from both. So the distance from each charge to the midpoint is 0.01 meters (since 2 cm is 0.02 m, so half is 0.01 m).

The electric field from each charge at the midpoint would be E = k * |q| / r². But wait, for the positive and negative charges, the directions are opposite.

So the positive charge would produce a field pointing away from it, which is towards the right if the positive is on the left. The negative charge produces a field pointing towards it, which is to the left. So each of their fields at the midpoint is in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait, since both are the same magnitude, their fields at the midpoint would be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So when you add them, they would cancel each other out.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the dipole is a pair of point charges, so the electric field at the midpoint is the vector sum of the fields from each charge.

So, positive charge +4nC at left, negative at right. Midpoint is halfway. The positive charge creates a field E1 to the right (away from positive), and the negative charge creates a field E2 to the left (towards negative). So E1 and E2 are in opposite directions.

But wait, the magnitude of each E is the same. So E1 = k*(4e-9)/ (0.01)^2, and E2 is same. But E1 is to the right, E2 to the left. So when you add them vectorially, E1 + E2 would be (E1 - E2), but since they're equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, their sum is zero.

Wait, that's correct? Because E1 is to the right, E2 is to the left. So when you add E1 (right) and E2 (left), they are in opposite directions. But since they have the same magnitude, the net field is zero. So the electric field strength at the midpoint is zero.

So the answer should be D: 0.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, is the midpoint the point where the dipole's center is? Yes, because the midpoint is equidistant from both charges. So yes, the fields from each charge cancel each other, leading to a net electric field of zero at that point.

To determine the electric field strength at the midpoint between the two charges in an electric dipole, we start by noting the following:

- The magnitude of each charge is \( q = 4.0 \, \text{nC} = 4.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C} \).
- The distance between the charges is \( d = 2.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.02 \, \text{m} \).
- The midpoint is equidistant from both charges, so the distance from each charge to the midpoint is \( r = 0.01 \, \text{m} \).

The electric field due to a point charge is given by:
\[
E = k \cdot \frac{|q|}{r^2}
\]
where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is the Coulomb constant.

For the positive charge (\(+4.0 \, \text{nC}\)) at the left end, the electric field at the midpoint is:
\[
E_1 = k \cdot \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-9}}{(0.01)^2}
\]

For the negative charge (\(-4.0 \, \text{nC}\)) at the right end, the electric field at the midpoint is:
\[
E_2 = k \cdot \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-9}}{(0.01)^2}
\]

Since the positive charge produces a field pointing away from itself (to the right) and the negative charge produces a field pointing toward itself (to the left), these fields are in opposite directions. However, their magnitudes are equal, so they cancel each other out:
\[
E_{\text{net}} = E_1 - E_2 = 0
\]

Thus, the net electric field at the midpoint is zero.
