Okay, so I've got this question about overfitting and two statements. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, I remember that overfitting is when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. So, if the model is too complex, it might overfit. But what factors influence this?

Statement 1 says, "Overfitting is more likely when the set of training data is small." Hmm, I think the size of the training data has a big impact. More data can help the model learn better, but maybe with more data, it's less prone to overfitting because there's more information to generalize from. Wait, no, actually, if the data is small, the model might not have enough examples to learn the underlying pattern, making it more prone to overfitting. So Statement 1 seems correct. 

Now Statement 2: "Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small." Hypothesis space refers to the set of all possible functions the model can choose from. A small hypothesis space means the model has fewer options. If the model is forced to choose from a limited set, it might not have enough flexibility to learn the true pattern, especially if the true pattern is more complex. That makes sense too. So Statement 2 also seems correct. 

Wait, but I should double-check. I recall that overfitting isn't just about the size of the data or the size of the hypothesis space, but perhaps about both. Like, if the data is small but the hypothesis space is big, that might still lead to overfitting. Or maybe it's the other way around. 

Alternatively, maybe the size of the data affects how much the model can learn. So when data is small, the model might not have enough examples to learn the true pattern, leading to overfitting. And a small hypothesis space would constrain the model's capacity, making it more likely to overfit. So both statements are correct. 

Looking at the options, I see option B is True, True. Are there any other considerations? Like, are there cases where one statement might not hold? I can't think of a scenario where one statement is definitely wrong. Both make sense, so B should be the correct answer.

The statements about overfitting are both correct. Statement 1 relates to the size of the training data, and Statement 2 relates to the hypothesis space. 

Answer: B: True, True
