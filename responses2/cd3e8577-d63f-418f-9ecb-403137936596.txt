Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about fiscal policy and how it can help with a recession. Let me think through what I know about fiscal policy.

First, I remember that fiscal policy involves the government's decisions regarding spending and taxation. It's one of the key tools used by central banks and governments to manage the economy. There are two main approaches: contractionary and expansionary.

A recession is a period of economic decline, often marked by reduced demand for goods and services, high unemployment, and rising interest rates. To address this, the government might want to stimulate the economy, which would require expansionary fiscal policy. This typically involves increasing government spending or decreasing taxes to boost demand.

Looking at the options:

A: increase spending and taxes. That would reduce overall demand because you're both increasing and decreasing taxes—more spending, less revenue, which might not be the best approach for expansion.

B: reduce spending and increase taxes. This seems like a contractionary policy because it's cutting back on spending and raising taxes, which would reduce demand. Not good for a recession.

C: increase taxes without changing spending. This could prevent the economy from overheating. For instance, if the government increases taxes, it can save money, which might help prevent inflation or too high of a budget deficit.

D: maintain current levels. This doesn't address the underlying cause of the recession and is more about maintaining the status quo rather than solving the problem.

E: reduce spending and increase taxes. Like B, this would reduce demand, which is bad for a recession.

F: reduce taxes without changing spending. This could stimulate the economy because taxes are a major component of the budget. Lowering taxes would mean more money comes out of the wallet, which could increase spending and demand.

G: increase spending and reduce taxes. Both actions would help boost demand. More spending and lower taxes would increase overall demand, which is expansionary.

H: decrease spending and increase taxes. This is similar to E and B; it reduces demand.

I: increase spending without changing tax levels. This could boost demand but doesn't address the tax revenue. If taxes aren't changed, the government's revenue might not support public spending, which could be a problem.

J: reduce spending without changing taxes. This would reduce demand, which isn't helpful for a recession.

Now, thinking about contractionary vs. expansionary. A recession is a decline, so to fix that, expansionary policy is needed. Expansionary would increase spending or cut taxes.

So the options are A, G, F, H, and I. Looking for which ones fit expansionary.

Option G is increase spending and reduce taxes. That's expansionary because both actions increase demand. Option F is reduce taxes and keep spending same, which could also be expansionary. But wait, if taxes are reduced, people have more disposable income, which can stimulate spending. So F could be another correct answer. Similarly, H is the opposite of G; H is decreasing spending and increasing taxes, which would reduce demand, not helpful.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The question is about the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession. So the correct policy should stimulate the economy, which means increasing demand.

Option G is both increasing spending and reducing taxes. That's a positive approach, as both would increase demand.

Option F is reducing taxes and keeping spending same. That could also be expansionary, as more people have income, leading to more spending. So F is also a correct answer.

Wait, but in reality, how do these policies work? Reducing taxes without changing spending (F) would increase disposable income, leading to increased spending and economic growth. That's a contractionary policy? Or is it expansionary?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Contractionary policies are those that reduce demand, like cutting spending or increasing taxes. Expansionary policies are those that increase demand, like increasing spending or cutting taxes.

So, F is reducing taxes (which is a contractionary measure) and keeping spending same. That would reduce demand, which is bad for a recession.

Wait, but Option G is increasing spending (expansionary) and reducing taxes (which is also contractionary but by reducing taxes, you're effectively increasing the government's budget, which could help if you have enough revenue).

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about how fiscal policy works.

In a recession, the government needs to increase demand to stimulate the economy. So, the appropriate measures would include either increasing government spending (like building infrastructure, increasing welfare programs) or decreasing taxes (so people have more cash to spend). Both of these actions would lead to increased demand.

Looking at the options, G is increase spending and reduce taxes. That's expansionary, which is the right choice. Option F is decrease taxes but keep spending same, which is a contractionary approach. So F would not help a recession.

Option H is decrease spending and increase taxes. That's contractionary because spending is going down, which would reduce demand, and taxes are going up, which reduces government revenue—so that's bad.

Option I is increase spending without changing taxes. That's expansionary, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy. Both G and I are expansionary. That's confusing.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Option G: increase spending and reduce taxes. Both are expansionary, so this would help.

Option I: increase spending without changing taxes. That's also expansionary.

Wait, so both G and I are expansionary. But the question is which is the appropriate choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G, because it's a standard approach.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake. Let me think about each option's impact.

The question is about "remedy" a recession. The main goal is to stimulate the economy.

Option G: Increase Government Spending and Reduce Taxes. Both increase demand. So that's a contractionary policy? Or is it expansionary?

Wait, no. No—no, no. Government spending increases and tax reduction both cause net increase in demand. So it's an expansionary policy. So that's the right approach.

Option H: Decrease Government Spending and Increase Taxes. That would reduce demand, which is bad.

So the correct answer is G or H. But H is contractionary. So the appropriate one is G.

Wait, but H is also an option. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the question is about the appropriate fiscal policy. I remember that the key is to increase demand.

So, expansionary policy is to increase spending or reduce taxes.

So options G and I are expansionary.

Wait, but in reality, increasing spending can be costly, but it's a direct way to boost demand. Reducing taxes is a more direct way because it allows people to spend more.

So, the correct answer is G. Because it's both expansionary.

Wait, but the options only provide G and H as possible. Let me check the question again.

The options are A to J. The question is which is correct.

So, for instance, the answer is G: increase government spending and reduce taxes.

Wait, but in the options, option G is "increase government spending and reduce taxes." So that's correct.

Alternatively, option H is "decrease government spending and increase taxes." That's the opposite of G.

Wait, but that's not as helpful. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the correct answer is G. I think I've seen that before.

So the correct answer is G.

To address a recession, the appropriate fiscal policy involves stimulating the economy by increasing demand. This can be achieved through expansionary measures such as increasing government spending or reducing taxes. 

- **Option G**: Increase government spending and reduce taxes. This approach increases demand by boosting spending and lowering taxes, which allows people to spend more, thereby stimulating economic activity.  
- **Option H**: Decrease government spending and increase taxes. This is a contractionary policy, which reduces demand and is not suitable for a recession.

Given that the question asks for the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession, the correct choice is **G**, as it aligns with expansionary fiscal policy goals.

Answer: G
