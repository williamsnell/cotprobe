Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Corvino's reading of Aquinas. Hmm, I remember Aquinas was a medieval philosopher who talked a lot about human nature and the role of the mind. So, Corvino is a religious figure known for his work in religious texts. I think Corvino's interpretation focuses on moral and ethical issues.

The question is about what kind of sexual acts are unnatural according to Corvino's reading. The options are A to J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: performed outside of marriage. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe Aquinas discussed marriage as a natural part of human nature, so if these acts are outside, they might be unnatural. But I'm not certain.

Option B: non-consensual. That sounds a bit too direct. Maybe Aquinas would see consensual or non-consensual acts differently. But Corvino's reading might not focus on consensual vs. unnatural, just that they're unnatural.

Option C: practiced among adolescents. I'm not certain about the context. Maybe Young人们's sexual activities are unnatural, but I'm not sure if that's a direct reading Corvino would take.

Option D: not leading to emotional fulfillment. Aquinas talked a lot about the consequences of actions, so if these acts are not leading to emotional satisfaction, that could be considered unnatural.

Option E: not accepted by societal norms. Maybe these acts aren't what societal norms accept, making them unnatural.

Option F: deliberately pro-creative. I don't think that's what Corvino's focus was. He was more about morality and the mind.

Option G: involving multiple partners. I'm not sure. Maybe more partners are unnatural, but again, Corvino's reading might not focus on that.

Option H: uncommonly practiced among adults. Maybe adults are more prone to unnatural behaviors, but I'm not certain.

Option I: deliberately non-procreative. This seems to fit because Corvino would likely see non-procreative behaviors as unnatural, as in Aquinas' view on human nature.

Option J: not endorsed by religious institutions. I'm not sure how that would relate. Maybe the religious view would accept or reject these acts, but Corvino's focus might be more on the moral implications.

Putting it all together, the question is about what makes an act unnatural in Aquinas' view. Non-procreative acts (I) would align with that. So the answer should be I.

The correct answer is **I: deliberately non-procreative**. This choice aligns with Corvino's interpretation of naturalism in Aquinas, where non-procreative, unintended behaviors are considered unnatural. 

Answer: I
