Okay, so I have this equation here: 8y equals 56. Hmm, I need to find the value of y. Alright, let's think about how to solve this. I remember that to solve for y, I should isolate it on one side of the equation. Since 8 is multiplied by y, I can do the opposite operation, which is division, to get y by itself.

So, if I divide both sides of the equation by 8, that should help. Let me write that down: 8y/8 = 56/8. Simplifying the left side, the 8s cancel out, leaving just y. On the right side, 56 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 8 times 7 is 56, right? Because 8 times 5 is 40, plus 8 times 2 is 16, which adds up to 56. So 56 divided by 8 is 7.

Wait, let me double-check. If I multiply 8 by 7, I get 56. Yep, that's correct. So y must be 7. Looking at the options, option H is 7. So the answer should be H.

The equation is 8y = 56. To solve for y, divide both sides by 8: y = 56/8 = 7. The correct answer is H.

Answer: H
