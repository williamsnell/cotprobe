Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cross-cultural studies on facial expressions. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly lists six recognized expressions across various cultures. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that facial expressions are universal, so each expression should be recognized regardless of the culture. I'm trying to recall what each of these options includes.

Looking at the options, each provides six expressions. The question asks for the correct list, so I need to find which set of six is commonly recognized.

Option A: Happiness, sadness, desire, repulsion, fear, and surprise. Wait, "desire" isn't one I think people universally recognize. I'm not sure about desire, but I think people do recognize desire in some cultures, but is it considered a standard expression across all cultures? I'm not too sure. Maybe it's not the best choice.

Option B: Joy, sorrow, fear, rage, astonishment, and repugnance. Joy and repugnance seem familiar. Joy is a universal expression. Repugnance is more of a psychological term, not a physical expression. So, maybe this is incorrect because repugnance isn't a recognized expression in all cultures.

Option C: Happiness, sadness, anger, loathing, lust, and surprise. Wait, I know that most cultures recognize "lust" as a positive expression, but is "loathing" (an intense dislike) a common expression? I'm not so sure. Also, is "lust" a typical expression? Maybe not all cultures see it the same way. So this might not be correct.

Option D: Elation, melancholy, panic, ire, stupefaction, and detestation. Elation is good, but are these all recognized in every culture? Stupification and detestation are a bit strange. I'm not sure about these expressions. Maybe these are not commonly used in all cultures.

Option E: Glee, gloom, terror, outrage, amazement, and abhorrence. Glee is definitely a positive expression, and it's widely recognized in many cultures. Torrify is a negative expression, and abhorrence is a strong dislike. However, I'm not certain about the others. For example, "gloom" is more of a somber view, but I think some cultures do express gloom. "Torrows" maybe? Wait, I'm not sure about the others. I think this might be correct but I'm not 100% certain.

Option F: Happiness, sadness, fright, anger, shock, and revulsion. Wait, "fright" is a common expression, but "fear" is also a universal. However, "angry" and "shock" are definitely recognized. "Revulsion" is a strong emotion, but I'm not sure if it's commonly used. I'm a bit unsure about revulsion here. Also, "shock" is a bit abstract; is that a standard expression? Maybe not.

Option G: Happiness, sadness, indifference, fright, surprise, and dislike. Indifference is a bit vague, but maybe some cultures express it. "Fright" and "surprise" are okay. Also, "dislike" is a positive expression as well. This seems plausible because all these terms are familiar across many cultures.

Option H: Delight, despair, dread, fury, wonder, and aversion. Delight is a positive feeling, and it's universal. Despair is a negative feeling. dread is a negative expression, fury is a strong emotion. Wonder is a positive, and aversion is a strong dislike. So, all these are common across cultures. This seems like a strong candidate.

Wait, let me think again. Let's go through each option's expressions.

Option A: "desire" — maybe not universally recognized. Also, I'm not sure about "desire" being a standard expression. I think "happiness" is common, but desire might not be. So A might not be the best.

Option B: "repugnance" — I'm not sure if that's a standard expression. Also, "rage" is a common expression, so perhaps this is a less likely option.

Option C: "loathing" — not sure if that's widely used. Also, "lust" is a positive expression, but not sure about all cultures.

Option D: "detestation" — not a standard term I recall. Also, "stupification" and "detestation" — not sure about these.

Option E: "glee" — yes. "Torrows" is a term for glee. "Torrows" is a type of glee, but is this a common expression? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option F: "revulsion" — not a commonly used word, but maybe.

Option G: "indifference" — not sure. "fright" is fine, "shock" is a bit abstract. 

Option H: All these terms are common. Delight, despair, dread, fury, wonder, aversion. So, this seems to include a range of expressions across various cultures.

Option I: "stupulate" — not in the options. I'm looking for the six expressions.

Wait, the correct answer is probably H because it includes expressions that are widely recognized. But I need to confirm.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question is which list includes the six expressions that are correct.

Another approach: some of these expressions are universally recognized, others may not be. For example, "fear" is a universal expression, but "desire" is more cultural-specific. So, which options include terms that are commonly used.

Looking at option H: Delight, which is universal. Despair is a negative; perhaps not as common as others. dread is a negative expression. fury is a strong emotion. wonder is a positive feeling. aversion is a strong dislike.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these. Let me think about each option:

Option E: Glee (yes), gloom (yes), terror (yes), outrage (yes), amazement (yes), abhorrence (yes). Glee is a positive expression. Is "gloom" a common expression? Maybe, as it relates to sadness but is more about the overall feeling of sadness.

But the question is about the six that are recognized. So, option E includes gloom, terror, outrage, etc. But are all the expressions in E recognized in every culture? For example, is "glee" a term that is not universal? I'm not sure. For example, in some cultures, glee might not be a term.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option:

Option H: Delight, which is a positive and universal. Despair is a negative, but whether it's recognized as a positive? I think in some cultures, people express their emotions, but maybe not as universally as others. But the question is about which list is correct. So, "despair" is not a standard term. So, perhaps this is not the right answer.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option G: Happiness, sadness, indifference, fright, surprise, and dislike. Indifference is a term that some cultures use, but others might not. "Fright" is definitely a positive expression. "Surprise" is a positive. "Dislike" is a positive. So, perhaps this is correct.

Option E: Glee, which is specific, is a positive. "Gloom" is a general expression of sadness, which is universal. "Terror" (fear), "urge," "amazement," "abhorrence" — I'm not entirely sure about all these.

Wait, another approach: some of these are more about the emotion than the expression. For example, "fear" is a universal expression, but "desire" is more tied to culture.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is H. Because in many cultures, we have expressions like "glee" (exaggerated happiness), which is a positive expression. "Gloom" is a general expression for sadness. "Terror" is fear. "Rage" is a strong emotion. "Wonder" is a positive feeling, and "aversion" is a strong dislike.

Wait, but some options include "despair" which I'm not sure is universally recognized. Maybe the correct answer is H because it includes terms that are common across cultures.

Alternatively, another thought: some of these expressions may be more of a psychological term. For example, "despair" is a negative expression, but in some cultures, it is expressed as "despair" in a negative way. However, I think people do recognize and use it.

Wait, but looking back, another way to approach this is to think about which of these are actually commonly used.

H: Delight, which is good. Despair, which is a negative expression. dread, which is a negative. fury, which is a strong emotion. wonder, which is positive. aversion, which is strong dislike. So all of these are positive, negative, or strong emotions.

Looking at the other options:

Option E: Glee is a positive. Torrows (glee) is a form of glee. But are there terms like "despair" in E? No. So E doesn't have "despair" and thus perhaps is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option H.

The question asks for the correct list of six facial expressions recognized by people across every culture. After analyzing each option, the key is to identify expressions that are universally recognized. 

- **Option A** includes "desire," which is less universally recognized compared to other expressions.
- **Option B** includes "repugnance," which is not a standard expression in all cultures.
- **Option C** includes "loathing" and "lust," which may not be recognized in every culture.
- **Option D** includes "stupification" and "detestation," which are not standard terms.
- **Option E** includes "glee," "gloom," "terror," "urge," "amazement," and "abhorrence." While these are common expressions, "despair" is not included.
- **Option G** includes "indifference," "fright," "surprise," and "dislike," but "indifference" is less commonly used.
- **Option H** includes "delight," "despair," "dread," "fury," "wonder," and "aversion." These are all widely recognized expressions across cultures.

Given that **Option H** includes a range of well-known and universally recognized expressions, it is the correct answer.
