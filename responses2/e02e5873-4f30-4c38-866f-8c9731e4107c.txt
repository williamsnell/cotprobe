Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about silicate minerals. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that the basic unit of silicates is the Si^4+ ion, which consists of an Si^4+ ion and four O^2- ions. I remember that in silicate structures, silicon is often in a positive charge because it's commonly found in things like quartz and some other minerals. 

So, the question is about the electronic configurations of Si^4+ and O^2-. I think I need to figure out their electron configurations, which would be how the electrons are arranged around the nucleus. I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me try to recall.

Starting with Si^4+. Silicon normally has an atomic number of 14. So its neutral atom has 14 electrons. But when it loses four electrons to become Si^4+, it would have 14 - 4 = 10 electrons. 

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The neutral silicon has 14 electrons. So, the configuration would be [Ne] 3s² 3p². Because neutral silicon has 4p^3 or something? Wait, no. Wait, the electron configuration for silicon is [Ne] 3s² 3p². So when it loses four electrons, it becomes Si^4+ with 10 electrons left. So the configuration would be [Ne], because 10 electrons is the same as the Ne atom. So the configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p^6? Or wait, no. Wait, when you lose electrons, you lose them from the outermost shell first. Oh wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. The neutral silicon is 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p². So when it loses four electrons to become Si^4+, it would lose two from the 4p and two from 3p? Wait, no. Because 4p is lower in energy than 3p. So in neutral silicon, the electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p². When it loses four electrons, it'll lose the 4p electrons first (each 4p electron is -1 charge, but more accurately, each 4p is in a lower energy level than 3p). So 4p has two electrons, so losing those four (two from 4p and two from 3p?), wait no. Wait, the neutral silicon has 14 electrons. 14 = 2 + 8 + 4 (from 3s² 3p²). So if it loses four electrons, it becomes 10. So 10 electrons would be 2 in 4p and 8 in 3s² 3p²? Wait, no. Wait, the 3p is 2 electrons. So 3p² is two electrons. So when you lose four electrons, you can't lose two from 3p because that only gives 10 - 2 = 8, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. For Si^4+:

Silicon has atomic number 14. So the neutral silicon atom has 14 electrons. The electron configuration is [Ne] 3s² 3p². So when it loses four electrons to become Si^4+, it will lose the 4p electrons first. Each 4p electron is one unit, so losing two from 4p and two from 3p? Wait, no, because 4p has two electrons, so leaving 10 electrons would be 2 in 4p (so 4p²) and 8 in 3s² 3p²? No, wait, 3s² is 2, 3p² is another 2. So 3s² 3p² is 4 electrons. Losing four would mean losing 2 from 3p and 2 from 4p. So the configuration would be 3s² 3p^0? That can't be right. Wait, no, because 3p is higher in energy than 4p, so in the neutral atom, 4p is filled before 3p. When you lose electrons, you lose from higher energy levels first. So when you lose four electrons, you lose two from 4p and two from 3p. Wait, but 3p can't give two electrons because it's only two. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the neutral silicon ion. Let me write the electron configuration for Si^4+.

Neutral Si: [Ne] 3s² 3p². So 14 electrons. Losing four, we have 10. So the configuration is [Ne] 3s² 3p^0? Because 10 is equal to the [Ne] which is 10 electrons. No, wait, [Ne] is 10. So 3s² would be 2, 3p² is another 2. So 4 electrons. So adding that, the total is 10? Wait, no. I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration for Si^4+ is [Ne], which is 10 electrons. So the configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p^6? Or 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s^0 3p^6? Because after losing four electrons, the 4p and 3p would be gone. No, that doesn't make sense.

No, wait, that would imply losing two from 4p, but why would that happen? Because 4p is a higher energy level than 3p, so when you lose electrons, you lose from higher energy levels first. So for Si^4+:

Neutral Si: 14 electrons → [Ne] 3s² 3p².

So when it loses four electrons, it becomes Si^4+ with 10 electrons. So 10 = [Ne]? No, [Ne] is 10, but 10 is less than 14. Wait, no, [Ne] is 10 electrons, so if the neutral silicon has 14, then Si^4+ would have 10. So how?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the electron configuration of Si^4+ in terms of the noble gas configuration. Because Si is in group 14. So, the group 14 elements have four valence electrons. So in a neutral atom, they have 4 valence electrons, so their electron configuration would be [Ar] 3d^0 4s^0 4p^4? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Carbon is group 14, but group 14 is the same as group 6, but no. Wait, group 14 is silicon, germanium, etc. So group 14 has four valence electrons. So in a neutral atom, silicon would have 4 electrons in 4p. So the configuration would be [Ar] 3d^0 4s^0 4p^4. 

When it becomes Si^4+, it loses four electrons, removing the 4p electrons. So it would lose the two 4p electrons (to get to 4p^0) and the two 3p electrons? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: in the neutral state, the electron configuration is [Ar] 3d^10 4s^2 4p^3. No, maybe that's not right. I think I need a better approach.

Alternative approach: the neutral silicon has 14 electrons. The configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p². So when it loses four electrons, it goes from 14 to 10. The electrons are lost from the highest energy level first. So the 4p electrons (2 electrons) are lost first, then 3p (2), then lower levels. So after losing four, the 4p and 3p would have 0 and 0 electrons? No, because 4p has 2, so if you lose two, 4p becomes 0. 3p has 2, so losing two would make 3p 0.

Wait, that can't be. Because 14 - 4 = 10. So 10 electrons. So if 4p is 2, and 3p is 2, that would be 4 electrons. So we must have lost 6 electrons (4p^2 and 3p^2), but wait that's 4 electrons. So where's the other 6? That can't happen. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the electron configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just look up the electron configuration for Si^4+ and O^2-.

Wait, I think I remember that in the ionization stages, the valence electrons come first. So for Si^4+, it's losing four electrons. The neutral atom is [Ne] 3s² 3p². So when losing four, you remove the 4p (2) and 3p (2) electrons, leaving 3s², but wait 3s is higher in energy than 3p. No, wait, no. Wait, in the neutral atom, the 4p is filled before 3p. So losing electrons from 4p first (then 3p), but to lose four electrons, they would be lost from the 4p and 3p.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Another approach: silicon's atomic number is 14. Losing four electrons gives 10. The configuration would be [Ne], which is 10 electrons. So the electron configuration for Si^4+ is 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p^6? No, because that would be 2+2+6+2+6=18, which is more than 10. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing with neutral silicon. Let me think about neutral silicon. So, the neutral silicon has 14 electrons, so:

1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p². That's 2 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 2 =14. So when it loses four electrons, it goes from 14 to 10. So the configuration would be 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p^6? Because 2+2+6+2+6=18? No, wait that can't be. Oh wait, no. Wait, 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p^6 is 1+1+6+1+6 = 15? That's 15, but I thought we need 10.

I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to think about the electron configuration step by step.

Silicon neutral: 14 electrons.

Electron configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p².

So, to get Si^4+ (charge +4), it loses four electrons. So, the four electrons would be the two from the 4p and two from the 3p? Because 4p is higher in energy than 3p, so electrons are lost first from 4p.

So, if you lose two from 4p: 3p² becomes 3p^0.

And lose two from 3p: 3s² remains, and 3p^0.

Wait, but that would leave 10 electrons.

Wait, 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p^0, which totals 2+2+6+2 =12 electrons. But that's only 12. Wait, no. Oh wait, 1s² is 2, 2s² 2p^6 is 8, 3s² is 2. So 2+8+2=12. Oh, but the neutral silicon has 14. So that's 12, which is less than 14; I'm making a mistake here.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of losing four electrons. So, the neutral silicon has 14 electrons. Losing four leaves 10. So, what's 10 in terms of electrons?

Let me think about the noble gas configuration. So, 10 is the same as [Ne], which is 2 + 8 = 10. So, the configuration would be [Ne], which is 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s^0 3p^0. Wait, but that can't be right because 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s^0 3p^0 would have 10 electrons, but that would mean the 3s and 3p have 0 electrons. But that's only 10, so that's correct.

Wait, but in reality, how does silicon lose four electrons? Well, perhaps, the four electrons are taken from the 4p and 3p. So, removing two from each. So, 3p² becomes 3p^0, and 4p² becomes 4p^0. So, the configuration would be 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s² 3p^0 4p^0 → but wait, that's 2+2+6+2 =12 electrons, which is not 14. I'm getting stuck.

Wait a second. Perhaps I should think about the valence electrons. Silicon's valence electrons are in 3p and 4p. When it loses electrons, it loses from higher energy levels first. So, in the neutral state, the 4p electrons are filled (two electrons), so when it loses four electrons, it would lose both 4p and both 3p. So, 3p² → 3p^0, and 4p^2 →4p^0. So, the configuration would be 1s² 2s² 2p^6 3s^0 3p^0 4p^0. But that can't be right because that only has 10 electrons. Wait, but that's the same as [Ne], so that must be correct. So, Si^4+ has the same configuration as neon, which is 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

Wait, but wait, I thought 3p and 4p contribute to the configuration. But if I lose all four electrons from 4p and 3p, then the 3p and 4p would have no electrons, making the configuration 1s² 2s² 2p^6, which is 10 electrons. So, that makes sense.

So, Si^4+ → [Ne], configuration 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

Now, looking at O^2-. Oxygen normally has an atomic number of 8. Its neutral configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴. So when it gains two electrons to become O^2-, it gains two from the next available higher energy level, which is 2p. So, O^2- has 8 +2 =10 electrons. So the configuration would be 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

Wait, but wait, oxygen normally has 2p^4 in the neutral state. So, adding two electrons makes it 2p^6. So O^2- → 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

So, the O^2- configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

Wait, but wait, someone told me that O^2- is 1s² 2s² 2p^6. But another thought: perhaps oxygen in its +2 oxidation state has a different configuration. But I think, no, it's the same as in neutral oxygen because oxygen's valence depends on the number of electrons it can hold. So, O^2- has 8 +2 =10 electrons. Its configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

So, putting it all together:

Si^4+ → 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

O^2- → 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. The options given are for Si^4+ and O^2-. Looking at the options, option A is:

A: Si^4+ : 1s²2s²2p^6, O^2- :1s²2s²2p^6.

Yes, that matches our conclusion. So the correct answer should be option A.
</think>

The question involves determining the electronic configurations of silicon in the +4 oxidation state (Si^4+) and oxygen in the -2 oxidation state (O^2-).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Silicon in the +4 oxidation state (Si^4+):**
   - Neutral silicon has an atomic number of 14, with an electron configuration of [Ne] 3s² 3p².
   - When silicon loses four electrons to become Si^4+, it removes the 4p electrons first (2 electrons) and then the 3p electrons (2 electrons). This leaves the configuration as [Ne], which is 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

2. **Oxygen in the -2 oxidation state (O^2-):**
   - Neutral oxygen has an atomic number of 8, with an electron configuration of [He] 2s² 2p⁴.
   - When oxygen gains two electrons to become O^2-, it adds them to the 2p orbital (2 electrons). This gives the configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶.

3. **Matching the options:**
   - Both Si^4+ and O^2- have the same electronic configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p^6.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **option A**, as it accurately describes the electronic configurations of Si^4+ and O^2-.
