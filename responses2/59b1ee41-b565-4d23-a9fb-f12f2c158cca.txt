Okay, so I have this problem here where a teacher wants to invest $30,000 into an account that compounds annually with an interest rate of 1.8%. I need to figure out how much money will be in the account after 6 years. Hmm, alright, let me think about the formula I remember for compound interest.

Wait, the formula is A = P(1 + r)^t, right? Where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time in years. Let me make sure I have that right. Yeah, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers: P is $30,000, r is 1.8%, and t is 6 years. Let me convert the rate to a decimal because the formula uses a decimal. 1.8% is 0.018. So now, the formula becomes A = 30000 * (1 + 0.018)^6.

Let me calculate the part inside the parentheses first. 1 + 0.018 is 1.018. Now, I need to raise 1.018 to the 6th power. I might need a calculator for this, but since I'm just thinking, I'll try to compute it step by step.

Calculating 1.018^6... Let's break it down:

First, 1.018 squared is (1.018)*(1.018). Doing the multiplication: 1 * 1.018 is 1.018, and 0.018 * 1.018 is about 0.018324. Adding those gives 1.018 + 0.018324 = 1.036324. So 1.018^2 ≈ 1.036324.

Now, that squared again to get to the 4th power: (1.036324)^2. Let's compute that. 1.036324 * 1.036324. Let me approximate:

1.036324 * 1.036324 ≈ 1.074717 (I remember this from previous calculations, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately).

Wait, maybe I should do a more precise calculation step. Let's compute 1.036324 * 1.036324:

1.036324 × 1.036324:

First, 1 × 1.036324 = 1.036324
Then, 0.036324 × 1.036324. Let's compute each part.

0.036324 * 1 = 0.036324
0.036324 * 0.036324 ≈ 0.001320 (approx)
Adding those, 0.036324 + 0.001320 ≈ 0.037644.

So total is 1.036324 + 0.037644 = 1.073968. So approximately 1.073968.

Wait, but that's the 4th power. Now, we need to multiply this by 1.018 again to get the 6th power (since 2^3 is 8, but we're going up to 6). Wait, no, wait: 1.018^6 = (1.018^2)^3. So, 1.036324 cubed.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of another approach. Maybe just use a calculator function here.

Alternatively, I can use the formula step by step. Let me compute 1.018^6 using a more systematic approach.

1.018^1 = 1.018

1.018^2 = 1.018 * 1.018 = approx 1.036324

1.018^3 = 1.036324 * 1.018. Let me compute that.

1.036324 * 1.018:

1.036324 * 1 = 1.036324

1.036324 * 0.018 = 0.018653832

Adding these together: 1.036324 + 0.018653832 = 1.054977832

So 1.018^3 ≈ 1.054977832

1.018^4 = 1.054977832 * 1.018.

Let's compute that:

1.054977832 * 1 = 1.054977832

1.054977832 * 0.018 = 0.018989598776

Adding them: 1.054977832 + 0.018989598776 ≈ 1.073967430776

So 1.018^4 ≈ 1.07396743

1.018^5 = 1.07396743 * 1.018.

1.07396743 * 1 = 1.07396743

1.07396743 * 0.018 = 0.01933141374

Adding: 1.07396743 + 0.01933141374 ≈ 1.093298844

So 1.018^5 ≈ 1.093298844

1.018^6 = 1.093298844 * 1.018.

Compute that:

1.093298844 * 1 = 1.093298844

1.093298844 * 0.018 = 0.0196793792

Adding: 1.093298844 + 0.0196793792 ≈ 1.112978223

So 1.018^6 ≈ 1.112978223.

Now, plug this back into the formula: A = 30000 * 1.112978223.

Multiplying 30000 by 1.112978223.

30000 * 1 = 30000

30000 * 0.112978223 ≈ 30000 * 0.112978 ≈ 3,389.34

So total A ≈ 30000 + 3,389.34 = 33,389.34.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure of the calculations because I think that 1.018^6 is approximately 1.112978, which when multiplied by 30,000 gives 30,000 * 1.112978 = 30,000 + (30,000 * 0.112978).

30,000 * 0.112978 = 30,000 * 0.112978 ≈ 3,389.34.

So the total would be 30,000 + 3,389.34 = 33,389.34.

But let me cross-check using a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula as A = 30000*(1.018)^6.

I think another way to compute this is to use the formula step by step.

Alternatively, using the formula in another way:

Compute the exponent step by step:

We have:

After 1 year: 30000 * 1.018 = 30,000 * 1.018 = 30,540.

After 2 years: 30,540 * 1.018 = let me compute that.

30,540 * 1.018.

30,540 * 1 = 30,540

30,540 * 0.018: 30,540 * 0.018 = 549.72.

So total is 30,540 + 549.72 = 31,089.72.

After 3 years: 31,089.72 * 1.018.

31,089.72 * 1 = 31,089.72

31,089.72 * 0.018 = approx 559.615.

Adding: 31,089.72 + 559.615 = 31,649.335.

After 4 years: 31,649.335 * 1.018.

31,649.335 * 1 = 31,649.335

31,649.335 * 0.018: 31,649.335 * 0.018 = approx 569.688.

Total: 31,649.335 + 569.688 = 32,219.023.

After 5 years: 32,219.023 * 1.018.

32,219.023 * 1 = 32,219.023

32,219.023 * 0.018: 32,219.023 * 0.018 = approx 580.122.

Adding: 32,219.023 + 580.122 = 32,799.145.

After 6 years: 32,799.145 * 1.018.

32,799.145 * 1 = 32,799.145

32,799.145 * 0.018: 32,799.145 * 0.018 = approximately 589.784.

Adding: 32,799.145 + 589.784 = 33,388.929.

So approximately $33,388.93.

Looking at the options provided:

A: 37000.00

B: 36000.00

C: 33850.00

D: 31000.00

E: 34567.89

F: 32700.00

G: 30180.00

H: 33389.35

I: 35000.00

J: 32000.00

So option H is 33,389.35. Our calculation gave approximately 33,388.93, which rounds to $33,389.35, so option H.
