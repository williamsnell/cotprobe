Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question about errors caused by human mistakes. The question is asking which type of error is mainly due to human errors. The options are A: gross error, B: instrumental error, and C: systematic error.

First, I'll try to remember what each of these terms means. Gross error, or gross mistakes, are errors that happen without any real intention. I think this is when someone makes a mistake by accident. For example, if someone drops their pencil or reads a scale incorrectly.

Then there's systematic error, which I believe is a consistent and repeatable error. This occurs due to a flaw in the instrument or setup. Like if a ruler isn't properly calibrated, every measurement you take would be off in the same direction. So, a systematic error would be a recurring issue affecting multiple measurements.

Instrumental error specifically refers to errors that happen because the instrument isn't working correctly. This could be due to faulty parts in the device. For instance, if the odometer in a vehicle isn't properly calibrated, every distance read would be incorrect.

So, the question is about errors caused by human mistakes. That would be gross error. Because human errors are mistakes that happen without knowing what's wrong, like misreading a scale or making a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me think again. The question says "errors mainly caused by human mistakes." So, it's not about the instrument's fault. Instrumental errors are specific to the device, not human. So, the answer should be A: gross error.

The errors primarily caused by human mistakes are gross errors.
