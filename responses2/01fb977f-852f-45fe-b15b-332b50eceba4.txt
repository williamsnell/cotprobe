Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diving bell. Hmm, diving bells, right. I remember they're used to control the depth they're submerged in by changing the volume of air space inside. But wait, the question is about the volume when lowered to a certain depth. Let me think.

The problem says the diving bell has an initial air space of 3.0 m³ on the deck. We need to find the volume when it's lowered to 50 meters. The mean density of sea water is given as 1.025 g/cm³, and the temperature is the same as on the surface, so I think we can ignore any temperature-related expansion or contraction. That's probably because the temperature doesn't change, so the density change comes purely from the change in volume due to pressure.

Wait, yeah, the pressure changes with depth. So the pressure inside and outside the bell will be different because of the water's density and the depth. Since the bell is a flexible container, the pressure inside and outside must balance each other. So the pressure inside must equal the pressure outside.

I remember the formula for pressure underwater. Oh right, it's P = density * g * h. But wait, I should make sure the units are consistent. The density is given in g/cm³, and the height is 50 meters. Let me convert that into the right units.

Density, rho, is 1.025 g/cm³. Let's convert that to kg/m³ because pressure is in Pascals or Pascals per meter squared. Oh wait, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³, right? Because 1 g is 0.001 kg and 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³ * (1e-6 m³) → 1000e-6 = 1 kg/m³? Wait, no, wait: 1 g is 0.001 kg, and 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 1 g/cm³ = (0.001 kg) / (1e-6 m³) ) = 1000 kg/m³. Oh, right, so 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. 1 g is 1e-3 kg, 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 1 g/cm³ is (1e-3 kg) / (1e-6 m³) ) = 1e3 kg/m³ → 1000 kg/m³. So yes, 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³.

The density of seawater is about 1025 kg/m³, but I think in the problem, they've given it as 1.025 g/cm³, which is the same. So that's correct.

Now, the height h is 50 m, so rho * g * h would give the pressure difference. But wait, the formula is P = rho * g * h. So the pressure at the depth is rho * g * h. But the pressure inside the bell is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the depth, right? Or perhaps the pressure inside is the same as the outside? Wait, the outside is atmospheric pressure, and the inside is higher because of the water pressure. But wait, the diving bell is designed so that the pressure inside is maintained, right? Or wait, the bell is submerged, so the pressure inside must be equal to the pressure outside to keep the air tight. So the pressure inside is atmospheric pressure plus the pressure from the water depth.

Wait, no, I think the pressure inside the bell (and the surrounding water) must be the same. So the pressure inside is P = P_atm + rho_water * g * h. But in this problem, perhaps the external pressure is atmospheric, and the internal pressure is higher by rho_water * g * h. So the volume inside would decrease, because pressure is higher inside but the bell is flexible.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's think again. The outside of the bell is the water, so the pressure outside is atmospheric. The inside is the air in the bell, which is at a higher pressure due to the water. So the pressure inside the bell is atmospheric pressure plus the pressure from the water. So, P_inside = P_atm + rho_water * g * h.

But because the bell is flexible, the volume of air will change to keep the pressure inside equal to the pressure outside. Wait, no, the pressure inside is higher, so the volume would decrease. Because when you pressurize a gas, if the volume is allowed to expand, the pressure decreases. So if the pressure inside increases, the volume must decrease.

Wait, no, when you have a gas in a container, if the pressure increases, the volume decreases. So in this case, the pressure inside the bell is higher than the outside (since the water pressure is high). So the volume of the air inside would decrease upon lowering the depth. So the initial volume is 3.0 m³, and when lowered, it's less.

So we can model this as an isothermal situation (temperature same on surface and inside), so we can use the ideal gas law: P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

Wait, but wait, the temperature is same, so yes, ideal gas law applies. So P1 V1 = P2 V2.

What's P1? P1 is the pressure outside, which is atmospheric. P2 is the pressure inside the bell, which is atmospheric plus the pressure from the water at 50 m. So P2 = P_atm + rho_water * g * h.

Wait, but when the bell is at the surface, the pressure inside is atmospheric, because there's no water. So when you lower it to 50 m, the pressure inside increases.

So let me write the equation:

P1 * V1 = P2 * V2

But P1 is atmospheric pressure (let's assume it's the same as outside), so P1 = P_atm. Then, P2 = P_atm + rho_water * g * h.

So substituting:

P_atm * V1 = (P_atm + rho_water * g * h) * V2.

We can solve for V2: V2 = (P_atm * V1) / (P_atm + rho_water * g * h )

But wait, wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the pressure inside the bell being equal to the pressure outside plus the water pressure. But no, the outside is just atmospheric. So the inside is higher by rho_water * g * h.

Wait, but perhaps the pressure in the bell is atmospheric plus the pressure from the water. So P_inside = P_atm + rho_water * g * h.

But the outside is P_atm, so the pressure inside is higher. So the volume inside, V2, must be less than V1 because pressure is higher.

So the equation in the ideal gas law is:

P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

But P1 is atmospheric, and P2 is atmospheric + rho_water * g * h.

So let's compute P2.

rho_water is 1025 kg/m³ (since 1 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³?), wait no. Wait, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. Because 1 cm³ is (0.01 m)^3 = 1e-6 m³. So 1 g/cm³ = (1 g) / (1 cm³) = (0.001 kg) / (1e-6 m³) = 1000 kg/m³.

So rho_water is 1025 kg/m³.

So P2 = 101325 Pa (atmospheric pressure) + (1025 kg/m³) * (9.8 m/s²) * (50 m)

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute rho_water * g * h:

1025 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 50 m = 1025 * 9.8 * 50

Let me compute 1025 * 50 = 51,250. Then 51,250 * 9.8.

Hmm, 51,250 * 10 is 512,500. Subtract 51,250 * 0.2 → 10,250, so 512500-10250=502,250.

Wait, 51,250 * 9.8 = 502250 (let me double-check: 51,250 *9=461,250; 51,250 *0.8=41,000 → 461,250 +41,000=502,250).

So rho_water*g*h = 502,250 Pa.

So P2 = 101325 Pa + 502250 Pa = 603,575 Pa.

Wait, wait, 101325 + 502250 is 603,575 Pa.

So now, the ideal gas law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

We have:

V2 = (P1 V1 ) / P2 → (101325 Pa * 3.0 m³) / 603575 Pa

Compute that:

101325 * 3 = 303,975.

Divide by 603575: 303975 / 603575 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that division. Let me see:

Approximately, 303975 ÷ 603575 ≈ 0.5037.

Wait, 603575 * 0.5 = 301,787.5. 303,975 is 2,187.5 more. So 2,187.5 / 603575 ≈ 0.0036. So 0.5 + 0.0036 ≈ 0.5036.

So V2 ≈ 0.5036 m³.

Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 2.5 m³, which is 2.5. But wait, wait, wait, that can't be because 0.5 is way less than 1. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the units or the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, the pressure inside is P1 = P_atm (101325 Pa) plus (rho_water * g * h). So rho_water is 1025 kg/m³, correct? So 1025 * 9.8 * 50.

Wait, 1025 *50 =51,250. 51,250 *9.8=502,250 Pa. So P2 = 101,325 + 502,250 = 603,575 Pa. Yes, that's correct.

But wait, the initial volume is 3.0 m³ at P=101325 Pa. After lowering, the pressure is 603,575 Pa. So V2 = (101325 *3) /603575 → 303975 / 603575 ≈ 0.5036 m³.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 2.5 m³. But wait, that's way higher. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, wait wait, no. Because when you lower the depth, the pressure increases, so the volume of the air should decrease, not increase. Because when pressure increases, the volume decreases. So 0.5 m³ would make sense, but the options don't have that. The options are all much larger.

Wait, I think I see a mistake. Oh wait, the problem says the diving bell has an air space of 3.0 m³ when on deck. So that's the initial volume. When you lower to 50 meters, the pressure increases, so the volume of air should decrease. So 0.5 m³ is correct, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Is the pressure inside the bell equal to atmospheric pressure plus the pressure from the water? Or is it the other way around? Because the outside is atmospheric, so the pressure inside must be greater than atmospheric, so the bell is compressed, so the volume decreases, which is right.

But the calculation gave a volume of 0.5 m³, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pressure inside correctly. Let me re-calculate rho_water * g * h. Wait, 1025 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 50 m.

Do the math again: 1025 * 50 = 51,250. 51,250 *9.8 = 502,250 Pa. So that part is correct.

But wait, wait. The initial volume is 3.0 m³, so P_initial V_initial = P_final V_final.

Wait, but wait, the pressure inside is P_initial = P_atm, because when in the air, the pressure inside is atmospheric. Wait no, no—because when you're on the surface, the air is at atmospheric pressure, but when you go underwater, the pressure increases. So the pressure inside the bell (the air) is higher than atmospheric. So the volume must decrease.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the volume is about 0.5 m³, but that's not an option. But the options are much larger than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the problem.

Wait maybe the density is given as 1.025 g/cm³, which is 1025 kg/m³. Let me double-check that. Because 1 kg is 1000 grams, and 1 m³ is 100 cm ×100 cm ×100 cm → 1,000,000 cm³. So 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the pressure inside the bell is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure from the water. So P2 = P_atm + rho_water g h.

Wait, but the initial pressure is P1, which is just P_atm. So the equation is P1 V1 = P2 V2.

Wait, so V2 = (P1 V1) / P2 = (101325 * 3) / (101325 + 502250) → which is (303975) / 603575 → approximately 0.5036 m³. So V2 ≈ 0.5036 m³. Which is 0.5 m³, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the density of water is different. Wait, the question says take the mean density of sea water as 1.025 g/cm³. Wait, is that correct? Because I thought the density is about 1000 kg/m³. But let me think: 1.025 g/cm³ is 1025 kg/m³, which is correct. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the closest is option G which is 2.5 m³. But 0.5 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait a second, maybe I inverted the pressures. Let me think again. The pressure inside the bell is higher than atmospheric, so the volume should be less. So V2 is less than V1. But the calculation says 0.5 m³, which is less than 3. So why isn't an option for that?

Wait the options are:

A:0.8 m³

B:2.0

C:2.8

D:3.5

E:4.0

F:1.2

G:2.5

H:0.5

I:1.0

J:1.5

Wait, option H is 0.5 m³. So if the calculation gives approximately 0.5036, which is close to 0.5, but no option exactly matches. H is 0.5, but perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the pressure due to the water as the only factor. That is, the pressure inside is just atmospheric plus the pressure from the water, but perhaps the air is not compressed. Wait, no, the air is the gas that's being compressed. So the pressure inside is higher than atmospheric, so the volume is lower. So the correct calculation leads to approximately 0.5 m³.

But since that's not one of the options, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read the problem again.

The diving bell has an air space of 3.0 m³ on the deck. We need to find the volume when lowered to 50 m. The density is 1.025 g/cm³. Temperature is same.

Wait, perhaps the density is 1.025 kg/m³? Because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 1.025 g/cm³ would be 1025 kg/m³.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the pressure calculation.

Wait, the pressure from the water is rho * g * h. So 1025 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 50 m.

Let me compute that:

1025 * 9.8 = 10045. So 10045 *50=502,250 Pa.

So P2 is 101325 + 502250 = 603,575 Pa.

So V2 = (101325 * 3 ) / 603575.

Which is 303,975 / 603,575 ≈ 0.5036 m³.

So that's approximately 0.5, but the options don't include that. The closest is option H (0.5), but perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Another possibility is that perhaps the pressure is P2 = P_atm + rho_water * g * h * (V1/V2) ), but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the situation as an isothermal process, but perhaps I should have considered that the pressure inside is (atmospheric + pressure from water), but perhaps the volume inside is inversely proportional to the pressure inside. Wait, but I think that was done correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should change the volume so that the pressure inside is the same as the external pressure. But no, the external pressure is atmospheric, so the pressure inside is higher, hence the volume is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the pressure due to the water. Let's compute the pressure due to the water at 50m: 1.025 g/cm³ * 9.8 m/s² *50 m = 1.025 *9.8 *50 = 1.025 *490 = 501.25 Pa. So the pressure inside is 101325 + 501.25 = 101826.25 Pa.

So the pressure inside is about 101826.25 Pa. The initial pressure is 101325 Pa. So the ratio P1 / P2 is (101325 / 101826.25) ≈ 0.995.

Since P1 * V1 = P2 * V2 → V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2) → V2 = 3.0 * (101325 / 101826.25) → 3.0 * 0.995 ≈ 2.985 m³.

Which is approximately 3.0 m³. But that's not an option either. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the density of the water is different. Wait, the problem says to take the mean density of sea water as 1.025 g/cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the pressure due to the water as the only factor, but that's not correct. The initial pressure is atmospheric, and the pressure inside the bell is atmospheric plus the pressure from the water.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for pressure in a fluid, and then find the volume based on that pressure. But perhaps I should think of it as the pressure inside is atmospheric plus the pressure from the water, so pressure inside is higher, volume is lower. So the correct calculation leads to about 0.5 m³, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the pressure due to the water only. Let me compute that.

P_inside_water = rho_water * g * h = 1025 kg/m³ *9.8 m/s² *50 m = 502,250 Pa.

Wait, but the initial pressure is still atmospheric. So P_initial = 101,325 Pa.

So, the pressure ratio is P_initial / P_inside_water = 101325 /502250 ≈ 0.202.

So, V2 = V1 * (P_initial / P_inside_water) ) → 3.0 * 0.202 = 0.606 m³.

Hmm, that's about 0.6 m³, which is between options F (1.2) and G (2.5). Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait another approach: perhaps the pressure due to the water is calculated again, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of rho_water * g * h.

Wait, let me compute 1025 *50=51,250. 51,250 *9.8=502,250 Pa. So that is correct.

So, maybe the problem is intended to be solved with a different approach. Maybe instead of using the ideal gas law, we can model it as hydrostatic pressure. But that's not correct because the pressure inside the bell is higher than outside, so the volume must decrease.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with the formula for compressible gas, but I think the formula for pressure and volume at constant temperature is the same as the ideal gas law.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with the following approach: the pressure inside the bell is atmospheric plus the pressure from the water. So P2 = P_atm + rho_water * g * h.

But perhaps the initial pressure is not atmospheric. No, the initial pressure is atmospheric, because the air in the bell is just the air inside, and the pressure from the water is the only additional pressure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the pressure increase as caused by the water, but the initial pressure is atmospheric. So the pressure inside is atmospheric plus the increase. So the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure.

So, P2 = P_atm + rho_water * g * h.

V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2) → because when P increases, volume decreases.

So, P1 =101325 Pa, P2=101325 +502250=603575 Pa.

V2 = 3.0 * (101325 / 603575 ) → 3.0 * 0.168 → 0.504 m³.

So again, V2≈0.504 m³, which is 0.5 m³. So the answer would be option H (0.5 m³). But why is that an option?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used P1 * V1 = P2 * V2, but assuming that the pressure inside is atmospheric, but that's not correct because the pressure inside the bell is higher. So perhaps the initial pressure is P_atm, and the pressure inside is P_atm + rho_water * g * h. So that is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute it as follows:

P2 = P1 + rho_water * g * h = 101325 Pa + 502250 Pa = 603575 Pa.

Then, V2 = (P1 * V1) / P2 = (101325 * 3) / 603575.

So 303975 / 603575 = 0.5036 m³. So approximately 0.5 m³.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is option G (2.5 m³), but that's not correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is intended to consider the pressure inside as the same as the external pressure, but that's not correct because the pressure inside is higher. So the volume should decrease.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the pressure in the bell as atmospheric, but that's not correct because the pressure increases with depth.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is intended to have the pressure increase by the same factor as the volume decreases. But I don't see how that would work.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem in terms of the pressure increase. So, if the pressure inside is twice the external pressure, the volume would be half. But perhaps that's what is happening here.

Wait, but in this case, the pressure inside is 603,575 Pa, and the external pressure is 101,325 Pa. The ratio is 603,575 / 101,325 ≈ 5.96. So the pressure is about 6 times higher. So the volume should be about 1/6 of the original, which is about 0.5 m³.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the answer options except for option H (0.5 m³). So perhaps the intended answer is H. But in that case, the problem is correct, and the answer is H.

Wait, but I'm getting a volume of 0.5 m³, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the pressure inside is the same as the external pressure. But that would only be the case if the pressure increase is zero, which isn't the case. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the pressure from the water is rho_water * g * h, and that the pressure inside is equal to atmospheric pressure plus that, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula for isothermal compression, which is V2 = V1 * (P1 / P2), but seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have the pressure increase by (P2 - P1) = rho_water * g * h, and then to find the volume change.

But I'm not seeing any other way to solve this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P2. Let me double-check.

rho_water = 1025 kg/m³.

g = 9.8 m/s².

h = 50 m.

So P2 = rho_water * g * h = 1025 *9.8 *50.

Compute 1025 *50 =51,250.

51,250 *9.8 = 502,250 Pa.

So yes, correct.

So the volume change is V2 = (101,325 *3 ) / (101,325 +502,250) = 303,975 / 603,575 ≈ 0.5036 m³.

So, again, the correct answer is approximately 0.504 m³, which is 0.5 m³.

But in the options, H is 0.5 m³. So the answer would be H.

But perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the pressure inside the bell as the same as the external pressure, but that's incorrect because the pressure increases with depth.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the pressure inside is equal to the external pressure plus the pressure due to the water. No, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have a pressure increase that's 5 times, so the volume is 1/6. But I don't see any other way.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the formula is V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1, which is correct.

So, the correct answer is approximately 0.504 m³, which is 0.5 m³, so option H.

But in that case, the answer is H. But the options don't have 0.5 m³, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, no, the options are:

H:0.5 m³

So perhaps the intended answer is H.

But according to the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 0.504 m³, which is close to 0.5. So the intended answer is H.

So, the answer is H.

Wait, but in the options, the correct answer is H, which is 0.5 m³. So perhaps the intended answer is H.

But according to the calculations, the correct answer is approximately 0.5036 m³, which is 0.5 m³, so option H.

So, the answer should be option H.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the volume of air in a diving bell when submerged in water. The initial volume is 3.0 m³ at the surface, and the bell is lowered to a depth of 50 m. The mean density of sea water is given as 1.025 g/cm³, and we assume the density of seawater is approximately 1025 kg/m³ (since 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³). The pressure due to the water at 50 m is calculated as:

\[
P_{\text{water}} = \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot g \cdot h = 1025 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 50 = 502,250 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

The total pressure inside the bell is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the water:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{atm}} + P_{\text{water}} = 101,325 + 502,250 = 603,575 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

Using the ideal gas law for an isothermal process (\(P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2\)), the volume of air in the bell at depth 50 m is:

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{P_1}{P_2} = 3.0 \cdot \frac{101,325}{603,575} \approx 3.0 \cdot 0.168 \approx 0.504 \, \text{m}^3.
\]

This calculation shows that the volume of air in the bell is approximately 0.504 m³. Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is **H: 0.5 m³**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
