Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Anscombe's views. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick on the grounds of, and there are five options (A to J). I remember that Anscombe worked with Sidgwick, probably on ethical theories.

Wait, so the question is about what he criticizes Sidgwick on. I think Sidgwick's work was about utilitarianism, maybe? And Anscombe, being a critic, might have a different take.

Option A: he supports consequentialism. I thought Sidgwick was more utilitarian. Maybe not. Because I read that Sidgwick was more about the "maximizing agent" idea, where the agent is the person making the decision, not the interests of society, so maybe he supports something like the maximization principle rather than consequentialism. So if A is correct, that would mean Sidgwick's approach is different, maybe not consequentialism. Or am I getting that wrong?

Option B: endorses divine law. I think Sidgwick was critical of the divine law approach, which is more religious in ethics. So if he endorses it, maybe he's against it. So B might not be correct.

Option C: natural balance to the universe. I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe he's critical of naturalism. Or perhaps he's arguing against the idea that the universe operates under some natural laws. Not too sure about this.

Option D: he does not believe in the principle of double effect. Hmm, I'm not certain about this. The double effect is about the consequences of one's actions. I think Sidgwick might have discussed this, perhaps dismissing it as a necessary evil or something. So if he doesn't believe in it, that could be a point. But I'm not certain.

Option E: all of the above. If more than one is correct, but I'm not certain.

Option F: neglects emotions. Sidgwick was known for integrating ethics with psychology, so maybe he didn't neglect emotions. So F might not be correct.

Option G: fails to account for virtue. I remember that Sidgwick's ethics focused more on individual interests and the role of purpose, not virtue. So if G is correct, that would be a point.

Option H: does not distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. I think Sidgwick talked about foreseeability and the difference between what you expect to happen and what actually happens. So maybe he didn't distinguish this, or at least I'm not sure. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Option I: he argues that morality is subjective. Sidgwick was more about objective ethics, maybe. So if he thinks morality is subjective, that could be a point. So I is a possible correct option.

Option J: he overlooks individual intention. Sidgwick, I think, was critical of the idea that moral action is guided by intrinsic motivation. So maybe he doesn't consider individual intention because it's too personal. That could be a point.

Now, trying to piece this together. I remember that the question is about which of these options are correct statements about what Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick.

I think I might have read that Sidgwick criticized consequences for being too focused on what one expects (double effect), so E might be incorrect. Or perhaps I'm mixing up things. Wait, another angle: Sidgwick's views on ethics were critical of utilitarianism in some ways. He argued that utilitarianism's focus on consequences might not be sufficient because the consequences might not be known or might be influenced by others.

Option D says he doesn't believe in the principle of double effect. So if he doesn't think it's necessary, that would be a point. I think Sidgwick did discuss the double effect, but I'm not sure if he thought it was a necessary principle.

Option I says he argues that morality is subjective—Sidgwick's ethics were more objective in that he focused on the individual's self-interest, so maybe he didn't think it's subjective. So I is incorrect.

Option J says he overlooks individual intention. Sidgwick focused on the individual's intrinsic motivation (self-interest) rather than external factors. So if his view doesn't consider individual intention, that's correct. So J would be correct.

So going back to the options, the question is about what he criticizes. Let's see:

The question asks what he criticizes Sidgwick on. So the options are statements about Sidgwick's views.

The options are about what he criticizes, so it's about the criteria or principles he's criticizing.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the question wrong. Let me read again. The question says: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

Ah, wait, the question is about what he criticizes Sidgwick on. So perhaps the options are about what he criticizes, not what Sidgwick criticizes. Or am I getting confused.

Wait, the initial question says: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the options are statements about what he criticizes Sidgwick on.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question is about what he criticizes Sidgwick on, so the options are, for example, A: he supports consequentialism. So if A is a correct statement about what he criticizes, then the answer would be A.

Alternatively, the options are about what he criticizes, so the correct answer is the option that correctly describes a point he makes about Sidgwick.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it again.

The options are statements about what he criticizes. So for example, if option A is correct, that would mean that he supports consequentialism. So the question is, what does he criticize Sidgwick on? So, for example, if he criticizes Sidgwick's view on consequences, then A would be correct.

Wait, but the options are statements that are about Sidgwick's views, not about his own.

Wait, no, the options are what he criticizes. So the question is, what does he criticize Sidgwick on, and the options are statements about Sidgwick's views.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think in terms of which of these statements is correct about Sidgwick.

Another approach: I'll try to recall what I know about Sidgwick and his views.

Sidgwick's ethics were more about individual self-interest and the role of purpose. He argued against utilitarianism's focus on consequences, pointing out that they might not be known or might be influenced by others. So, for example, he might not have considered the principle of double effect, which is about the consequences being foreseen and intended.

Option D: he does not believe in double effect. So if he didn't think it's necessary, then D would be correct.

Option H: says he doesn't distinguish foreseen and intended consequences, so if he thought they were necessary, that could be correct.

Option I: he argues that morality is subjective. I think Sidgwick thought it was objective because he focused on self-interest, so I don't think he considered morality subjective. So I is incorrect.

Option J: he overlooks individual intention. Sidgwick focused on intrinsic motivation, so he wouldn't consider individual intention. So J is correct.

So the options that are correct about Sidgwick's views would be:

D: he doesn't believe in double effect.

H: he doesn't distinguish between foreseen and intended.

J: he overlooks individual intention.

I think that's right.

Now, the question is about what he criticizes Sidgwick on. So if the options A to J are statements about what he criticizes, then the correct answers would be the options that are correct about Sidgwick's views.

But wait, the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So I think the options are statements about Sidgwick's views, and the correct answer is the letter corresponding to the correct statement.

Wait, no, the options are statements about what he criticizes. So the question is, which of these options are correct statements about what he criticizes Sidgwick on.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at what each option says.

The question is, which of these statements is correct about his critique of Sidgwick.

So if I can know which of the statements are correct about Sidgwick.

So let's go through each option:

A: he supports consequentialism. Sidgwick was critical of consequentialism, so A is incorrect.

B: endorses divine law. Sidgwick was against the divine law, so B is incorrect.

C: natural balance. I'm not sure. I think Sidgwick focused more on natural laws and the role of purpose, but I'm not certain about this. So C might not be correct.

D: he does not believe in double effect. I think Sidgwick thought double effect was a necessary principle. So D is incorrect.

E: all of the above. If any of A-D are incorrect, E would be wrong.

F: neglects emotions. Sidgwick focused on logic and self-interest, so F is incorrect.

G: fails to account for virtue. Sidgwick focused on individual self-interest, so G's incorrect.

H: does not distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. Sidgwick thought consequences are foreseen but not intended, so H would be correct.

I: morality is subjective. Sidgwick thought it was objective, so I is incorrect.

J: overlooks individual intention. Sidgwick focused on self-interest, so J is correct.

So the correct statements are H and J.

So looking back at the options, which one is correct.

The options are A to J, each a statement about what he criticizes Sidgwick on.

The question is, which of these is correct.

If the options are about what he criticizes Sidgwick on, then the correct options are D and J.

Wait, but the question provides each option as a possible answer. So the options are:

Options D and J are correct.

So in the given options, D and J would be correct statements about what he criticizes Sidgwick on.

But the question is asking which of the options (A to J) is correct. So the possible answers are D and J.

But the options in the question are presented as what he criticizes Sidgwick on. So perhaps the correct answers are the statements that are correct about Sidgwick's views.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Maybe the question is asking which of the following is a correct point that he made about Sidgwick's ethics.

So if I have to choose which of the options A to J correctly describes what he says about Sidgwick.

So the correct options would be D, H, J.

Wait, but the options are separate. The question is, the answer is one letter, which letter corresponds to the correct statements.

But looking back, the options are:

A: supports consequentialism.

B: endorses divine law.

C: natural balance.

D: no double effect.

E: all correct.

F: neglects emotions.

G: fails to account for virtue.

H: no distinction between foreseen and intended.

I: morality is subjective.

J: overlooks individual intention.

So the question is, which of these is correct about what he criticizes Sidgwick on.

So the correct options are D and H and J.

Wait, but the question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

So the correct answer must be a single letter (A to J), and I think the correct options are D and J.

Wait, but in the options, D says he doesn't believe in double effect.

H says he doesn't distinguish between foreseen and intended.

J says he overlooks individual intention.

Wait, so the question is, which of these three are correct.

But the options are A to J, each a single statement. So the correct answers would be any of these letters if the statement is correct.

But the question is "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen," meaning that the correct answer is a single letter, and the letter must be the last character.

So I need to choose the option that is correct.

But the question is, what does he criticize Sidgwick on.

So the options are statements about Sidgwick's views. So the correct options are D, H, and J.

But the question is not asking which of the options are correct, but which option is correct about his critique of Sidgwick.

So if the answer is D, that's one correct statement; H is another; J is another.

But the question's options are options A through J, each a possible correct answer. So the user is to select which of these statements is correct.

So for example, if the correct answer is H, then the letter is H. But the question says, the last character must be the chosen letter. So the correct letter is H.

Wait, but I'm now getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of each option's correctness.

So, which of the options A-J is correct about what he criticizes Sidgwick on.

So:

A: wrong because he supports consequentialism.

B: wrong because Sidgwick against divine law.

C: I'm not certain, but perhaps he's correct in C? I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D, H, and J.

But the question is about the options given, each as a possible answer. So the correct choices are D, H, and J.

But the options are each a single letter, so the correct answer would be one of them.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the options are each individual statements—so if the question is asking which of these is a correct statement about what he criticizes Sidgwick on, then the correct answers are D, H, and J.

But the question allows for only one letter as the answer, so perhaps that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, H, or J.

Wait, but the options are presented as A to J, each as a possible correct answer. So the correct answer would be, for example, H.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because Sidgwick's ethics focused on individual self-interest, so J is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, since he didn't believe in double effect.

But the question is about what he criticizes Sidgwick on. So the options are statements about Sidgwick's views, not about his own.

So, the correct options would be D: he does not believe in the principle of double effect.

H: he does not distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences.

J: he overlooks individual intention.

So all three are correct statements about Sidgwick's views.

But the options are A to J, each a possible correct statement. So the correct answers are D, H, and J.

But the question is, which of these options is correct. So the user is to select one letter, the correct letter, which is one of these.

Wait, but it's not possible for more than one option to be correct, but the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen," implying that it's a single letter.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think, perhaps the options are the correct answers, but which one is correct according to the question.

Wait, the question is, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

So the response is a single letter, and that letter is the last character. So the correct answer is a letter that correctly describes one of the options.

So the options are A to J, each a statement about what he criticizes Sidgwick on.

So the possible correct options are D, H, and J.

But the question is, which of these is correct.

But since the options are each a single letter and the correct answer must be one, maybe the options are more about the way the question is phrased.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the most correct answer.

I think that the correct answer is H and J. But since the options are presented as letters, perhaps the correct answer is J because he overlooks individual intention.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because he doesn't believe in double effect.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: I've read that Sidgwick's approach, as per my notes, was more about individual self-interest and the role of purpose. So he didn't believe in the double effect, which is about the consequences being foreseen and intended.

So D would be correct.

H says he doesn't distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. Did Sidgwick consider that important?

I think Sidgwick's views on consequences were more about the outcomes that would follow, regardless of whether he expected them or not. So H's statement might be incorrect.

J is correct because Sidgwick focused on individual self-interest rather than considering the role of purpose in ethics.

So if J is correct, then the letter would be J.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another source: I think Sidgwick's views on consequences were more about the consequences that would result, not whether the person expects them. So H's statement might not be correct.

Perhaps H is incorrect.

So the correct statements would be D and J.

But since the question is only looking for one letter, perhaps the intended correct answer is D or J.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the options.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with what I remember. I think the correct answer is D and J.

Wait, but the options are presented as individual letters. So the correct answer would be the letter that is correct.

So if the options are correct statements, then the answer would be D, H, J.

But the question is asking which of these is correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is H and J, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: Let's think of what each option is about.

Option D: he does not believe in the principle of double effect.

Option H: he does not distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences.

Option J: he overlooks individual intention.

What is the difference between these options?

Double effect is about the consequences being both foreseen and intended.

The distinction between foreseen and intended consequences is about whether the outcome is known or anticipated.

Overlooking individual intention implies that Sidgwick didn't consider the role of desire in ethical decision-making.

So, if Sidgwick thought that the consequences were not known or not anticipated, then H is correct.

J is correct because Sidgwick's ethics focused on self-interest, not on the role of purpose.

So, which options are correct?

D is correct, because Sidgwick did not believe in the principle.

H is correct, because he did not distinguish between the two.

J is correct, because he didn't consider individual intention.

So all three D, H, J are correct.

But the question is to select the correct letter, which could be multiple, but it's one.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, the correct answer is J.

Wait, but the options are letters. The correct answer is a letter, which is one of D, H, J.

But how can I decide which one is correct?

Perhaps the correct answer is D, because Sidgwick did not believe in the principle of double effect.

Another thought: In my notes, I remember that Sidgwick's ethics were more about self-interest and the role of purpose, so J is correct.

So the correct letters are D, H, J.

But the question asks for the last character of the response, so the correct answer would be a single letter, which is the letter corresponding to the correct statement.

Wait, I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, the correct answer is J.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is H and J.

But that's getting more complex.

Alternatively, the correct answer is D, H, and J.

But the options are letters, so perhaps the correct answer is J.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to decide.

If I think D is correct, then the letter is D.

If I think H is correct, then the letter is H.

If I think J is correct, the letter is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D and J.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of Sidgwick's views on ethics. He focused on self-interest and purpose, so he probably didn't consider the role of intention in ethics.

So J is correct.

So the correct answer is J, so the letter is J.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, another angle: Sidgwick's views on consequences were more about the consequences that would follow, rather than whether the person expects them.

So, for example, if the consequences are foreseen but not intended, Sidgwick would not be concerned about them.

So, H's statement is correct.

So the correct options are D, H, and J.

But the question is only allowing one letter as the answer.

Hmm.

I think the correct answer is J: he overlooks individual intention.

Because Sidgwick's ethics focused on self-interest, so he didn't consider individual intention.

Therefore, the correct answer is J.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another thought, perhaps the correct answer is H.

So I'm not certain, but perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H and J.

But the options are presented as individual statements, so perhaps the correct answer is D and J.

But the question is only looking for one letter.

Wait, the correct answer is J.

So I'll go with J.
</think>

The correct answer is J. Sidgwick's ethics focused on self-interest and the role of purpose, not on individual intention. He disregarded the principle of double effect, which involves both foreseen and intended consequences. Therefore, J is the correct letter.

ANSWER: J
