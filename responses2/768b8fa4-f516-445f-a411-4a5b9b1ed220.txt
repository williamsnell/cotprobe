Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the volume of KMnO4 needed to oxidize FeSO4 in an acidic solution. Hmm. I remember that this is a redox reaction problem. Let's see what the given information is.

The problem states that the concentration of KMnO4 is 0.20 M, and the volume of FeSO4 solution is 25.0 ml. And the reaction is Fe^2+ being oxidized to Fe^3+ and MnO4^- to Mn^2+.

Wait, I should probably write down the balanced redox reaction first. Oh right, in acidic conditions, KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, and FeSO4 is Fe^2+.

So, the oxidation half-reaction for Fe^2+ would be Fe^2+ → Fe^3+. That's a gain of one electron per Fe atom. But wait, in acidic solution, it's probably better to write it as Fe^2+ + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O. Let me think. Oh wait, because in acidic conditions, the oxidation might involve H+ and H2O.

Similarly, the reduction half-reaction for MnO4^- would be MnO4^- + 8H+ + 5e^- → Mn^2+ + 4H2O. Because Mn goes from +7 to +2, so a gain of 5 electrons per Mn molecule.

Now, to balance the electrons, I need to find a common multiple. The Fe^2+ half-reaction produces 5 electrons per Fe, and the Mn half-reaction consumes 5 electrons per Mn. So, if I balance each half-reaction:

Fe^2+ → Fe^3+ + e^- (but that's losing a electron, so reverse it to gain electrons. Wait, no. The Fe half-reaction is oxidation, so it's losing electrons. So you have Fe^2+ → Fe^3+ + e^- (but wait, that's losing an electron, so to make it an oxidation, the Fe is being oxidized. Let me correct that.

Wait, the oxidation half-reaction should be Fe^2+ → Fe^3+ + e^- because each Fe loses an electron. But wait, that's oxidation. So the oxidation part is losing electrons. Then, the reduction half-reaction is MnO4^- + 8H+ + 5e^- → Mn^2+ + 4H2O. So to balance electrons, I need to multiply the Fe half-reaction by 5 so that the electrons lost equal the electrons gained.

Wait, the Fe half-reaction is losing 1e^- per Fe. So for 5 Fe atoms, 5 e^- are lost. The Mn half-reaction requires 5 e^- gained. So that's right. So when I add the two half-reactions together, I get:

Fe^2+ → Fe^3+ + e^- (but this is losing an electron)
MnO4^- + 8H+ + 5e^- → Mn^2+ + 4H2O
Adding them: Fe^2+ + MnO4^- + 8H+ → Fe^3+ + Mn^2+ + 4H2O + e^-?

Wait, no, let me correct that. When adding, each half-reaction is balanced. So the Fe half-reaction is:

Fe^2+ → Fe^3+ + e^-

But to get 5 electrons, I multiply this by 5:

5 Fe^2+ → 5 Fe^3+ + 5 e^-

And the Mn half-reaction is:

MnO4^- + 8H+ +5e^- → Mn^2+ + 4H2O

Adding these two together:

5 Fe^2+ + MnO4^- + 8H+ → 5 Fe^3+ + Mn^2+ + 4 H2O

Wait, but let's double-check the stoichiometry. Fe is 5 on each side, Mn is 1 on each side. Oxygen comes from H2O. H comes from H+.

Wait, but what about the H+? The MnO4^- has 8 H+ in the equation, so they get on the left. The Fe^2+ and MnO4^- are on the left, and Fe^3+ and Mn^2+ plus water on the right.

So, the balanced equation is 5 Fe^2+ + MnO4^- + 8 H+ → 5 Fe^3+ + Mn^2+ + 4 H2O

Now, I need the mole ratio between KMnO4 and Fe^2+.

Looking at the equation: 1 mole of MnO4^- reacts with 5 moles of Fe^2+.

So, the mole ratio is 5 Fe^2+ : 1 MnO4^-.

Now, the problem gives the concentrations and volumes. We can use the mole concept to find the required volume.

Let's calculate the moles of Fe^2+ first.

FeSO4 is the same as Fe^2+ solution. The molarity is 0.40 M, and volume is 25.0 ml. So moles Fe^2+ = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Molarity = 0.40 mol/L, Volume = 0.025 L.

So, 0.40 * 0.025 = 0.01 mol Fe^2+.

Now, the reaction equation is 5 Fe^2+ + MnO4^- → 5 Fe^3+ + Mn^2+ + ... So 5 Fe^2+ reacts with 1 MnO4^-.

So, moles of MnO4^- needed would be (1/5) * moles of Fe^2+.

So, 0.01 mol Fe^2+ × (1/5) = 0.002 mol MnO4^-.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, the ratio is 5 Fe : 1 MnO4. So for every 5 Fe, we need 1 MnO4. So, the amount of MnO4 needed is (moles Fe^2+) / 5.

So, 0.01 mol /5 = 0.002 mol MnO4^-.

Now, what's the concentration of KMnO4? It's 0.20 M.

We need to find how many liters of 0.20 M KMnO4 give 0.002 mol.

Molarity = moles / liters → liters = moles / Molarity.

So, liters KMnO4 = 0.002 mol / 0.20 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Fe^2+ is 0.40 M × 0.025 L = 0.01 mol.

MnO4^- needed is 0.01 /5 = 0.002 mol.

KMnO4 has a molarity of 0.20 M.

So volume V = moles / Molarity = 0.002 / 0.20 = 0.01 L → 10 mL.

Looking at the options, option I is 10 ml, which would be the correct answer.

To determine the volume of 0.20 M KMnO₄ required to oxidize 25.0 mL of 0.40 M FeSO₄ in acidic solution, we start by analyzing the redox reaction. The oxidation of Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ and the reduction of MnO₄⁻ to Mn²⁺ are the key steps. The balanced redox reaction is:

\[
5 \, \text{Fe}^{2+} + \text{MnO}_4^- + 8 \, \text{H}^+ \rightarrow 5 \, \text{Fe}^{3+} + \text{Mn}^{2+} + 4 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 5 moles of Fe²⁺ react with 1 mole of MnO₄⁻. This means the mole ratio of Fe²⁺ to MnO₄⁻ is 5:1.

Next, we calculate the moles of Fe²⁺ in the given solution:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe}^{2+} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.40 \, \text{M} \times 0.025 \, \text{L} = 0.01 \, \text{mol}
\]

Using the mole ratio, the moles of MnO₄⁻ required are:
\[
\text{Moles of MnO}_4^- = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe}^{2+}}{5} = \frac{0.01 \, \text{mol}}{5} = 0.002 \, \text{mol}
\]

Finally, we calculate the volume of KMnO₄ required using its concentration (0.20 M):
\[
\text{Volume of KMnO}_4 = \frac{\text{Moles of MnO}_4^-}{\text{Molarity}} = \frac{0.002 \, \text{mol}}{0.20 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}
\]

Thus, the volume of KMnO₄ required is **10 mL**.
