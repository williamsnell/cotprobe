Okay, so I've got this question about a DC machine. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the shunt resistance and armature resistance of a shunt type DC machine. The options are A to D, each describing different combinations.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on DC machines, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that in shunt machines, the armature resistance is usually low because it's a parallel arrangement. Oh right, the armature is split into two parallel paths: the armature circuit and the shunt field circuit. So the armature resistance (Ra) is usually low because it's just the armature windings in parallel, which reduces the resistance.

Now, the shunt resistance (Rsh) is the resistance of the shunt field. I think that depends on the type of shunt. If it's a shunt field with a shunt winding, the shunt resistance is high. Because in a shunt machine, the shunt field is the external field, and its resistance is part of the total resistance. For example, the shunt resistance is usually in the range of tens of ohms or more. So, if the shunt has a high Rsh, that's high.

Wait no, maybe I'm getting it backwards. Let me think again. In a shunt generator, the armature resistance is in parallel with the shunt resistance. So the total armature resistance would be Ra in parallel with Rsh. If Ra is low, then the total will depend on Rsh. But the question is about the individual values, not the total.

So the armature resistance Ra is low because it's just the armature circuit. The shunt resistance Rsh is high because it's the shunt field's resistance. So if the options say that Ra is high and Rsh is low, that would be incorrect. But wait, the question might be asking about the individual resistances, not their combination.

So the options are about the values of Ra and Rsh. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: high and high. No, because Ra is low.

Option B: high and low. That would mean Ra is high, which can't be right.

Option C: low and low. No, because Rsh is high.

Option D: low and high. So Ra is low (correct), Rsh is high (which would make option D correct. But wait, is the shunt resistance high? Or is it the shunt field's resistance that is high? Or is the shunt winding's resistance high?

Wait, the shunt resistance is the resistance of the shunt field. I think the shunt field's resistance depends on the type of shunt. For example, if it's a shunt field with a shunt winding, the resistance is high because it's a higher value. So if the options say Rsh is high, then that's correct.

So the question is, what are their individual values. The armature resistance is low, the shunt resistance is high. Looking at the options, option D says low and high. So the correct answer would be D.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the characteristics of a shunt DC machine. In such a machine, the armature resistance (Ra) is low because it is represented by a parallel arrangement of armature windings. On the other hand, the shunt resistance (Rsh), which corresponds to the resistance of the shunt field, is typically high. This is because the shunt field is an external component, and its resistance is part of the total resistance in the armature circuit. 

Given this, the armature resistance is low, and the shunt resistance is high. Among the provided options:

- **Option A (high and high):** Incorrect, as Ra is low.
- **Option B (high and low):** Incorrect, as Ra is low.
- **Option C (low and low):** Incorrect, as Rsh is high.
- **Option D (low and high):** Correct, as Ra is low and Rsh is high.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: D**
