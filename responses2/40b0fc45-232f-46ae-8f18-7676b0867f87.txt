Question:

What is meant by the term "monetary (or demand deposit) mul-tiplier," and how is it calculated?

Options:

A: The monetary multiplier is the ratio of the total amount of a country's money supply to its central bank's monetary base.
B: The monetary multiplier is the increase in total currency in circulation resulting from a single unit of currency being deposited into the banking system.
C: The monetary multiplier is the ratio of total demand deposits to the total reserves of the system.
D: The monetary multiplier is the ratio of the total reserves of the system to the total number of loans granted.
E: The monetary multiplier is the ratio of total demand deposits to the total loans of the system.
F: The monetary multiplier is the ratio of total loans to the total reserves of the system.
G: The monetary multiplier is the ratio of total reserves to the total demand deposits of the system.
H: The monetary multiplier is the rate at which new money is created through the fractional reserve banking system for every dollar of central bank reserves.
I: The monetary multiplier is the ratio of government bonds held by the public to the total reserves of the banking system.
J: The monetary multiplier is the percentage of total deposits that banks must keep as reserves.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the monetary multiplier. Hmm, I remember that the monetary multiplier has something to do with how banks create money through the process of fractional reserve banking. Let me think.

Wait, the question is asking what the monetary multiplier is and how it's calculated. The options are A to J.

First, I should recall the concept. I remember that when a bank receives a deposit, it doesn't keep the entire amount; it keeps a fraction as reserves and lends out the rest. This lending process can create a multiplier effect as the deposited money gets lent out, which in turn gets deposited and lent out more.

So, the monetary multiplier is the factor by which the money supply gets multiplied. For example, if the reserve ratio is 10%, each dollar deposited can potentially create $10 in the money supply through lending. So the multiplier would be 10.

Looking at the options:

Option H says the multiplier is the rate at which new money is created through fractional reserve banking for every dollar of central bank reserves. That sounds right because the central bank's reserve ratio determines how much it can keep and lend out. So for each dollar of reserves, it creates more money. And the rate is like the percentage, so H is a good candidate.

Option B says the multiplier is the increase in currency from a single deposit. That's more about the base money effect. It's not the total effect but a part of it. So B is part of the process but not the multiplier itself.

Option E says the ratio of total deposits to total loans. That's the money multiplier's inverse? Because if you have more deposits and fewer loans, the multiplier is higher. Wait, no. Wait, the money multiplier is the inverse of the reserve ratio. Because if the reserve ratio is 10%, the multiplier is 10. So if you have more deposits, you get more money. So E would be 1/reserve ratio. So the inverse of E's ratio is the multiplier. So E would give 1/0.1 =10. So E is the inverse of the ratio of deposits to loans.

But the question is what the multiplier is. So the correct answer is H.

Looking at the other options:

Option F: Ratio of total loans to reserves. That's the reserve ratio, not the inverse. So F is the reserve ratio.

Option G: Reserve ratio to demand deposits. Not relevant.

Option I: Government bonds. That's about monetary policy, not the multiplier.

Option J: Percentage of total deposits kept as reserves. That's the reserve ratio, same as F and G.

So the correct answer must be H.

The monetary multiplier refers to the factor by which the money supply is multiplied through the fractional reserve banking system. It is calculated as the inverse of the reserve ratio, which is the percentage of deposits a bank must keep as reserves. This means that for every dollar of reserves, the central bank can create a multiple of that dollar in new money. 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is **H**, which accurately describes the monetary multiplier as the rate at which new money is created through fractional reserve banking for every dollar of central bank reserves.

**Answer: H**
