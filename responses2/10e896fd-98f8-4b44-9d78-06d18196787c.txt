Question:

A woman needed to have her microwave repaired. She contacted the local handyman, who said he could repair the microwave for $100. The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if the handyman does not pay the repair bill.
B: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman and the repair store, but only if the repair is not completed on time.
C: The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.
D: The woman has no cause of action as she agreed to the repair without a specific completion date.
E: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if they knew she was the true owner of the microwave.
F: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.
G: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman, but only if the microwave is not repaired.
H: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.
I: The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.
J: The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman, but only if the handyman fails to pay the repair bill.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these torts and whatnot.

The question is about a woman who got her microwave repaired. She contacted a handyman, who said it would cost $100 and would be ready in two weeks. She agreed and handed it over. The handyman realized he couldn't finish the job on time and took it to a repair store instead. The store agreed to fix it for $80 within one week. The store owner didn’t know the woman owned the microwave. The question is about whether the woman has a cause of action against the repair store or the handyman.

Hmm, I remember that cause of action in torts is about whether an action is necessarily harmful or dangerous, and whether there's a breach of contract. So, the woman can sue if the action is necessarily harmful and that the contract was breached.

First, the handyman did repair the microwave for $100 and promised to fix it in two weeks. The woman agreed to it. But the handyman didn't finish on time, so he took the job to the store. The store fixed it for $80, which is less than the handyman's $100.

Now, the store owner didn't know the woman owned the microwave. So, the store was contracted to repair the microwave, but it's unclear whether the owner was aware.

Wait, but for the woman to have a cause of action against the store, she needs to have a breach of contract. But the store didn't know she owned the microwave. So, is that a breach?

Alternatively, could the store be considered a third-party contractor? Because the handyman was a local repairman who agreed to the job. The store is another entity, so perhaps that's a breach.

But wait, the handyman didn't finish on time, so the store took over. Was there an implied duty to repair the microwave in time? Because the handyman was supposed to fix it in two weeks. So the handyman breached the contract, which required him to finish within two weeks.

But the store didn't know. So the store didn't know that the handyman had breached the contract. So, is the store’s action a breach of contract? Or is it a tort of negligence?

Another angle: The handyman agreed to repair it for $100, and the store agreed to repair it for $80. The woman didn't pay the $100 bill. So, perhaps she can sue the handyman for not fulfilling his promise.

Wait, but the handyman didn't complete on time. So he was supposed to fix it in two weeks. But he didn't, so perhaps he breached his contract. The store then has to handle it, but the store owner didn't know.

So, the store didn't know that the woman owned the microwave, so perhaps it's a breach of trust or implied duty.

Wait, but the store is a third party who agreed to fix the microwave. So the store doesn't have a duty to repair it if the handyman hasn't done so. Or does the store have a duty based on the handyman's contract? I'm not sure. If the handyman was supposed to fix it in two weeks, the store might not have a duty to fix it unless the handyman's contract required it.

Wait, the handyman's contract was to repair it, so maybe the store doesn't have a duty to fix it unless the handyman agreed to do so. But the store didn't know the woman owned it. So maybe the store didn't have a duty to repair it because the handyman didn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the store is considered a third-party contractor, but the handyman's contract was to repair it, so the store doesn't have a duty unless the handyman agreed to do it.

Wait, but the store didn't know the woman owned it. So perhaps the store didn't have a duty because the handyman was supposed to handle it. But the store didn't know that.

So, could the store be considered a third-party contractor? If so, then they don't have a duty to repair it unless the handyman agreed to it. But the handyman agreed to repair it, so the store doesn't have a duty unless the handyman breached.

Alternatively, perhaps the store didn't know and so didn't have a duty, so they are not liable.

But wait, the question is about the woman's cause of action. So she can sue the store if she's a party to the store's contract and if the store breached their contract.

But does the store have a duty to repair the microwave? Or is the store acting on behalf of the handyman?

Wait, the handyman was a local repairman, agreed to repair the microwave, and the store agreed to do it for $80. The woman didn't pay the $100. So the handyman's promise to fix it in two weeks was broken. The store then took over.

So, the question is whether the store is liable for the woman's claim that the microwave was not repaired. But if the store didn't know the woman owned it, perhaps it's a breach of contract.

Wait, but the store didn't know, so maybe it's not a breach. Alternatively, maybe the store didn't have a duty because the handyman agreed to repair it, so the store didn't have to do anything.

Wait, but the store's agreement was to repair it for $80. The handyman agreed to the job, but the store didn't know that, so they didn't have a duty.

Alternatively, perhaps the store is a third-party contractor who agreed to repair the microwave, so the store doesn't have a duty unless the handyman breached.

Wait, but the handyman's contract was to repair the microwave, so perhaps the store didn't have a duty. So the store cannot be held liable for not repairing it.

Wait, but the store did repair it at a lower price, but the woman didn't pay the original $100. So, the store could be held liable for the $100, because the handyman didn't pay the full amount.

Wait, but I'm getting confused now. Let me try to approach this differently.

The woman is suing the repair store. She has a claim because the store didn't repair the microwave, but perhaps she has a claim because the handyman didn't perform his contract.

So, the cause of action against the handyman could be based on breach of contract. If the handyman's contract was to repair it in two weeks, and he didn't, then the woman can sue for breach of contract.

But the store owner didn't know she owned it. So, does the store have a duty? Or is it that the store didn't have a duty because the handyman agreed to repair it, so the store didn't have to perform.

Alternatively, the store didn't know, so perhaps it's not a breach.

Wait, but the store did fix it for $80, but the handyman didn't pay $100. So, the woman can sue the store for the $80 repair. But she could also sue the handyman for not paying the full amount.

But the question is about her cause of action against the repair store. So, the store's liability would come from the no payment and perhaps from breach of contract.

Wait, but the store didn't know she owned it, so perhaps they are not liable for breach of contract because the handyman had breached.

So, the woman could have a cause of action against the store for not fixing the microwave, and potentially against the handyman for not paying.

But the options are about whether she has a cause of action against either, both, or neither.

Looking back at the options:

Option F: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.

Option G: Only the handyman.

Option H: Both.

Wait, let's think about the cause of action against the repair store.

The repair store is a third-party contractor. So, the woman can sue them if they breached their contract.

For the contract to be breached, the handyman must have breached. The handyman agreed to repair the microwave, and the woman agreed to it. But the handyman didn't complete.

Wait, no: the handyman agreed to repair it (so he's a party to the contract), but the woman agreed to it. The handyman didn't finish, so he breached his contract.

If the handyman breached his contract, the store, being a third-party contractor, wouldn't have a duty to fix it unless the handyman breached. So the store didn't have a breach.

Therefore, the woman can't have a cause of action against the store because the store wasn't a party to breach the handyman's contract.

So, the only cause of action would be against the handyman.

But wait, the store did repair it, but the woman didn't pay. So, perhaps she can also sue the store for the $80 repair, but that's a separate cause of action.

Looking at the options:

Option F says she has a cause of action against the store only. So, she can sue the store for the repair, but not the handyman.

But the handyman's breach would be the issue for the store. So if the store is only liable for the repair, then she can have a cause of action against the store.

Wait, but the circumstances: The handyman agreed to repair the microwave for $100, and the woman agreed to it. The handyman didn't do it on time, so he took the job to the store. The store agreed to fix it for $80.

The store owner didn't know the woman owned the microwave. So, the store is a third-party contractor who agreed to repair it, so the store didn't have a duty unless the handyman breached.

So, the store didn't have a duty to repair it because the handyman didn't breach his contract. Therefore, the store isn't liable for the repair.

But the store did fix it, but it's at a lower price. So, the woman can sue the store for the $80 repair, but only if the store breached the contract, which it didn't.

Wait, but the cause of action for the repair is not about the price, but about the breach of contract. So, if the handyman breached his contract, then the store is not liable.

Alternatively, the store may have a duty because the handyman agreed to repair it, so the store didn't have to do anything.

Wait, no. A third-party contractor doesn't have a duty unless the main contractor (here, the handyman) breached. The store didn't have a duty because the handyman didn't breach.

So, the store isn't liable for the repair because the handyman didn't breach his contract; the store didn't have a duty regardless.

Therefore, the woman can't sue the store for the repair because the store wasn't a party to that breach. So, she can sue the handyman for not paying the full $100, but not the store.

But the options are:

Option F: Only the store.

Option G: Only the handyman.

Option H: Both.

Option F would be the case if she can only sue the store.

But wait, another angle: The repair store and the handyman had a contract. The handyman agreed to repair it, and the store agreed to fix it for $80. The woman didn't pay the $100. So, the store could sue the woman for the $100. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, the only option that mentions the store is F.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Woman has cause of action against the repair store, unless handyman doesn't pay.

B: She has cause against both.

C: No cause.

D: No cause because she agreed.

E: She has cause only if repair not on time.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the cause of action against the handyman.

The handyman was supposed to fix the microwave within two weeks, but he didn't. So, he breached his contract. As a result, the woman can sue him for breach of contract, which would require the man to pay the full $100.

But the store took over, and then the woman didn't pay the full amount. So, she can also sue the store for the $80 that the store did repair. But that's a separate breach of contract, but perhaps the store is also a third-party contractor, so the store wouldn't have a duty to repair it.

Wait, no. The store is a third-party contractor who agreed to repair it, so the store doesn't have a duty unless the main contractor (the handyman) breached.

Since the handyman didn't breach, the store isn't liable for the repair.

So, the woman can only sue the handyman for breach of contract, but not the store.

So, she has a cause of action against the handyman, but not the store.

Wait, but the options say:

A: She has a cause against the repair store, but only if the handyman doesn't pay.

But if the store isn't a party to breach, then she can't have a cause of action against the store.

So, perhaps the woman can only sue the handyman for not paying the full $100, but not the store.

Wait, but the store did repair it for $80, but she didn't pay that. So, she could also sue the store for the $80 repair, but that's a separate breach.

But the question is about the woman's cause of action. So, she can sue the store for not repairing it, but not the handyman.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Option F: She has a cause of action against the repair store only.

Option G: Only the handyman.

Option H: Both.

Wait, the correct answer should be that she can't have a cause of action against the store because the store wasn't a party to breach.

Wait, but the store is a third-party contractor. So, the woman can't claim against the store because the store didn't have a duty.

So, she can only have a cause of action against the handyman.

But wait, another thought: The repair store is considered a separate entity from the handyman, so the store's service is based on the handyman's contract. If the handyman breached, the store is not liable. But if the handyman didn't breach, the store isn't liable.

So, the woman can't sue the store because the store wasn't a party to breach. Therefore, she can only sue the handyman.

So, she has a cause of action against the handyman, but not the store.

Looking at the options, option G says she has a cause of action against the handyman, but only if it's not repaired on time. Hmm, but that's not exactly accurate. The store wasn't a party to breach, so the woman can't sue the store regardless of whether the handyman paid.

Wait, but the options are about the cause of action. The question is which of the following is the most accurate statement.

So, the woman can only have a cause of action against the handyman for not paying the full amount. She can't claim against the store because the store wasn't a third-party contractor.

Wait, but the store did fix it for $80. So, the woman might also be able to claim against the store for not repairing it at all, but that's a different cause of action.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are about the woman having a cause of action against either the store or the handyman.

So, let's think: Can she sue the store? The store is a third-party contractor who agreed to repair the microwave, but the handyman didn't. So, the store is not liable for no breach of contract because the handyman didn't breach.

Therefore, she can't have a cause of action against the store. So she can only have a cause of action against the handyman.

But the options don't include that. Looking again:

Option G: She has a cause of action against the handyman only.

Option B: She has a cause against both.

Wait, no, because the store isn't liable.

So, the correct answer would be that she can only have a cause of action against the handyman.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option G: She has a cause of action against the handyman only.

Wait, but the store is a third-party contractor, so unless the handyman breached, the store isn't liable.

So, the woman can't have a cause of action against the store. So she has a cause only against the handyman.

But looking at the options, option G says she has a cause only against the handyman, and it's only if the microwave isn't repaired.

Hmm, that seems a bit convoluted. Wait, the question says "only if the repair is not completed on time." Is that a different angle?

Alternatively, perhaps the store isn't liable because the handyman didn't breach. So the store isn't a party to the breach. So she can't have a cause of action against the store.

So, the woman can only have a cause against the handyman.

But the options include:

A: She has a cause against the repair store, but only if the handyman doesn't pay.

B: She has a cause against both.

Wait, maybe the store is considered a third-party contractor, but the woman's claim is only against the handyman. So, she can't have a cause against the store.

So, the correct answer should be that she has a cause only against the handyman.

Wait, but the options don't have a choice that says that. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: She has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if the handyman doesn't pay the repair bill.

B: She has a cause of action against the handyman and the repair store, but only if the repair is not completed on time.

C: No cause of action against either.

D: No cause of action as she agreed to the repair without a specific completion date.

E: She has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if they knew she was the true owner.

F: She has a cause of action against the repair store only.

G: She has a cause of action against the handyman only.

H: She has a cause of action against the handyman only, but only if the microwave is not repaired.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The woman can sue the handyman for breach of contract because the handyman's contract wasn't met. But the store is a third-party contractor who agreed to repair it. So, the store isn't liable unless the handyman breached. Since the handyman didn't, the store isn't liable.

So, the woman can only sue the handyman.

But looking at the options, none explicitly say that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the store isn't a third-party contractor because the handyman is the main contractor. So the store is considered a third-party but only if the main contractor breached. Since the main didn't, the store isn't liable.

So, the woman can't have a cause of action against the store. So, she can only have a cause against the handyman.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the store is considered a third-party contractor, but the woman could also sue the store for the $80 repair, but that's a different cause.

Wait, but the question is about whether she has a cause of action against either.

So, if she can have a cause against the handyman, that's one cause. But she can't have a cause against the store. So, she has a cause of action only against the handyman.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

A: She has a cause of action against the repair store, only if the handyman doesn't pay.

B: She has a cause against both.

C: No cause.

D: She has no cause because she agreed.

E: She has a cause only if the store knew the owner.

F: She has cause against the repair store.

G: She has cause against the handyman only.

H: She has cause against the handyman only, but only if the microwave is not repaired.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that she can't have a cause against either, so option C.

But why? Because the store is a third-party contractor, but the handyman didn't breach, so the store isn't liable.

So, the woman can't have a cause of action against either, so option C.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because she can have a cause against the handyman, because the handyman breached his contract. So, the store isn't liable, but the handyman is.

So, the woman can have a cause of action against the handyman, but not the store.

But the options don't have that. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A: She has a cause of action against the repair store, only if the handyman doesn't pay.

So, she can only have a cause if the handyman doesn't pay, which would be the case if the store is liable. But the store isn't liable because the handyman didn't breach.

So, perhaps option A is correct in that she can have a cause only if the handyman doesn't pay, but she's not required to pay, so she can't have a cause of action.

Wait, that's confusing. The woman can only have a cause against the handyman if the handyman doesn't pay the full amount. She can't have a cause of action against the handyman because even if the handyman didn't pay, no one is responsible for that breach.

Wait, no. The cause of action is that the handyman breached, so the woman can have a cause of action against him, even if he didn't pay. So, the cause of action is that the handyman breached his contract, and the woman can have that as a cause.

So, the store isn't liable, but the handyman is. So, the woman can have a cause against the handyman, but not the store.

So, the correct answer should be that she has a cause of action against the handyman only.

But looking at the options, none of them explicitly state that. Wait, option G says she has a cause of action against the handyman only.

Wait, but the store isn't liable. So, the correct answer must be that she can have a cause of action against the handyman, but not the store.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is that she can't have a cause of action against either, so option C.

Wait, but that's not correct because she can have a cause against the handyman, but not the store.

So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not possible.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

Option G: She has a cause of action against the handyman only.

So, that would be correct if the woman can have a cause against the handyman only, but not the store.

But the store isn't liable, so the woman can't have a cause against the store.

So, the correct answer would be that she can't have a cause against either, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the store is considered a third-party contractor who agreed to repair it, so the woman can have a cause against the store because the store didn't repair it. But that's not correct because the store didn't have a duty.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that she can't have a cause against the store, so she can't have a cause against either.

Wait, but that's not possible because she can have a cause against the handyman.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that she has a cause against the handyman only.

But looking at the options, option G is that.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: She has a cause of action against the repair store, only if the handyman doesn't pay.

B: She has a cause of action against the handyman and the repair store, only if the repair is not completed on time.

C: No cause of action against either.

D: She has no cause of action because she agreed to the repair without a specific completion date.

E: She has a cause of action against the repair store only if the repair wasn't completed on time.

F: She has a cause of action against the repair store only.

G: She has a cause of action against the handyman only.

H: She has a cause of action against the handyman only, but only if the microwave is not repaired.

So, the correct answer is that she has a cause against the handyman only, so option G.

But wait, why? Because the handyman breached his contract, and the woman can have a cause of action against him.

But the store isn't liable.

So, the woman can't have a cause of action against either, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is that she has a cause against the handyman only, so option G.

Alternatively, the correct answer is that she can't have a cause of action against the store, but she can have a cause against the handyman.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that she can have a cause against the handyman only, so option G.

Wait, but the options are not presented correctly.

Alternatively, the correct answer is that she can't have a cause of action against the store, and she can have a cause against the handyman.

So, the correct answer is that she can't have a cause of action against either, but that's not an option.

So, the correct answer is that she has a cause against the handyman only, so option G.

Wait, but the options are:

G: She has a cause of action against the handyman only.

So, that's correct.
</think>

The woman cannot have a cause of action against the repair store because the store was a third-party contractor who agreed to repair the microwave. The store did not have a duty to repair it unless the main contractor (the handyman) breached his contract. The handyman, however, breached his contract by not paying the full amount required to repair the microwave. Therefore, the woman can only have a cause of action against the handyman for breach of contract.

ANSWER: G
