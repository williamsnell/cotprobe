Okay, I've got this biology question about meiosis and the number of chromatids in different stages. Hmm, let me think. So the question says the animal has an adenosine number of 8. Wait, adenosine number refers to the number of sets of chromosomes, right? Like, each set is a pair, so if it's 8, that means 8 pairs, making 16 chromatids in total because each chromosome is two chromatids.

Meiosis is a process where homologous chromosomes pair up and then separate. So during meiosis I, the homologous pairs separate, each going to a different cell. So the number of chromatids remains the same as the original. But during meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate, which would halve the number of chromatids.

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The adenosine number is 8. So that's the number of chromosome sets. Each set has two chromatids, right? So 8 sets would have 16 chromatids in total.

The question is about the tetrad stage, the latelophase of the first meiotic division, and the metaphase of the second meiotic division. Let's break each down.

a) Tetrad stage: During meiosis I, when homologous chromosomes pair up. But wait, during meiosis I, the chromatids would have already split into pairs, right? No, wait, noâ€”during prophase I, the homologous pairs are still separate. Actually, meiosis I creates gametes with only one chromatid each. So during the tetrad stage, which is when four chromatids are present, like in the first meiotic division. Wait, no, the tetrad refers to the four chromatids forming a tetrad, which is a structure formed during the prophase I. So after meiosis I, the number of chromatids reduces. Oh wait, meiosis I results in four chromatids (two pairs) each, so that's the tetrad stage. But wait, that's after meiosis I. Before meiosis I, it's 16 chromatids. So in the tetrad stage, the number is 4 chromatids. Wait no, wait a second. Let's think about the stages.

Wait, adenosine number 8 means 8 pairs, so 16 chromatids. During meiosis I, those 16 split into 8 pairs, each pair consisting of two chromatids. So after meiosis I, we have 8 chromatids, each pair being one from each parent. Then, during meiosis II, those 8 split into 4, each with two chromatids. So the tetrad stage would be the stage when four chromatids are present, which is after meiosis I. So the tetrad stage would have 4 chromatids. So for part a, the number is 4.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure. The adenosine number is 8, so 8 pairs. So during prophase I, each homologous pair is in their own set of two chromatids. So when the first meiotic division happens (meiosis I), each chromatid remains. So after meiosis I, we have 8 chromatids (each pair is one from each parent). So the tetrad stage is when four chromatids form, which is after meiosis I. So a) is 4 chromatids.

b) The latelophase of the first meiotic division. Wait, the first meiotic division (meiosis I) has two cell divisions. The first division (meiosis I) happens, leading to gametes. The latelophase is the phase where the sister chromatids are still attached, so it's during prophase I. So the number of chromatids is 8, since each of the 8 pairs is still present as two chromatids.

Wait, but after meiosis I, each chromosome splits into two, so each pair (two chromatids) becomes one each. So during meiosis I, the chromatids would have already split into pairs, but wait, no. Wait, during prophase I, the homologous pairs are still together as two chromatids. So meiosis I doesn't split them. So during prophase I, each homologous pair is a single unit with two chromatids. So the number of chromatids is still 16 before meiosis I. After meiosis I, it's 8 chromatids (each pair is reduced by half), meaning each of the 8 pairs is now a single chromatid. So during the latelophase (prophase I), there are 8 chromatids.

So part b) is 8 chromatids.

c) The metaphase of the second meiotic division. The second meiotic division is meiosis II. During this stage, the sister chromatids separate. So each chromatid is now a separate unit. So with 8 chromatids, each of which has a sister, during metaphase II, each chromatid is in its own cell. So the number of chromatids is 8, but I think the question is about the number present in metaphase II. So part c) is 8 chromatids.

Wait, but the options in the question are a, b, c. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, like option F says a)16 (which would be before meiosis I), b)8 (prophase I), c)8 (metaphase II). So option F says: a)16, b)8, c)8. So that's the correct answer if the description is correct.

Wait, but another scenario: when the animal undergoes meiosis, the adenosine number is 8 (so 8 pairs, 16 chromatids). So in the tetrad stage, which occurs during prophase I (after meiosis I), the number is 4 chromatids. So part a) is 4.

In the second meiotic division (meiosis II), the number of chromatids is 8 (each chromosome is now a single chromatid). So during metaphase II, each chromosome is a single chromatid, so 8 in total.

So the correct answers are a) 4, b)8, c)8. Looking at the options, option F has these. So the answer should be F.

The adenosine number of 8 indicates that the animal has 8 pairs of chromosomes, or 16 chromatids in total. Meiosis involves two stages: prophase I and prophase II. During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up, and chromatids remain intact. During prophase II, sister chromatids separate, and chromatids are reduced to single units.

### Analysis of Each Part:
1. **a) Tetrad stage**: The tetrad stage occurs during prophase I, where four chromatids form a tetrad. This happens after the first meiotic division (meiosis I). Since the adenosine number is 8, there are 16 chromatids in total. After meiosis I, the number of chromatids reduces to 8. Therefore, during the tetrad stage, there are **4 chromatids**.

2. **b) Latelophase of the first meiotic division**: The latelophase refers to prophase I, where the homologous chromosomes pair up. At this stage, the number of chromatids is 16, as all homologous pairs are present.

3. **c) Metaphase of the second meiotic division**: After meiosis II, the number of chromatids remains at 8, as each chromosome has been separated into its own chromatid. During metaphase II, the chromatids are arranged in pairs, but the total number of chromatids is still 8.

### Correct Answer:
The correct sequence of chromatid numbers is **4 chromatids (a)**, **16 chromatids (b)**, and **8 chromatids (c)**. This corresponds to **Option F**.
