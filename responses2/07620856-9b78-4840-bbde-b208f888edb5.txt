Alright, so I've got this question about jurisdiction over crimes on board vessels. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which state typically exercises jurisdiction for maritime crimes. The options are A to J.

Okay, from what I remember, jurisdiction in maritime law generally refers to the jurisdiction of a particular state. But which state is that? I think it's the state where the vessel is operating. Because if the vessel is on a ship, the state that owns or operates it is the one that bears responsibility. So the state of the vessel's origin would be the one exercising jurisdiction. That would be option G.

Wait, what about other options? Let me go through them. Option A says all states have jurisdiction, but I don't think that's correct. There are states that don't have jurisdiction over certain types of maritime activities, though.

Option B is the neighboring state. I don't think that's right. Jurisdiction isn't usually given to neighboring states unless there's some specific legal situation.

Option C is the IMO. The IMO is an international organization, so it's not a state. Also, IMO doesn't own ships, so I don't think it exercises jurisdiction.

Option D is the port state. Port states can have jurisdiction, but it's not the state that owns the vessel. It's more about the port itself.

Option E is the UN. The UN doesn't own ships, so that's not relevant here.

Option F is the destination state. That's similar to option B; it's a neighboring state, so probably not jurisdiction.

Option I is the flag state. That's a country, not a state, so irrelevant.

Option J is the international tribunal for the law of the sea. That's more of an international court, not a state's jurisdiction.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: The state of the vessel's origin. Because the vessel is on board the state's ship, so that state has jurisdiction.

The state of the vessel's origin is the state that exercises jurisdiction for crimes committed on board vessels.
