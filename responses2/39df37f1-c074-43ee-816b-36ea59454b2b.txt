Question:

Congress enacts a statute that makes Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street. Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?

Options:

A: It is invalid because it conflicts with the ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., City Council.
B: It is valid as it is within the purview of Congress's power over transportation.
C: It is invalid because the law infringes upon the rights of the residents of Washington, D.C.
D: It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.
E: It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.
F: It is invalid because it violates the Tenth Amendment.
G: It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.
H: It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.
I: It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.
J: It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the constitutionality of a federal statute in the context of Washington, D.C. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that Congress passed a statute making Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street. This was done to allow members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in traffic. Before this, the City Council had a two-lane street ordinance. 

Now, the question asks which statement about the validity of this statute is correct. The options are A to J, each making a different claim about the statute's constitutionality.

First, I need to recall the key aspects of constitutional law regarding transportation and property power. I remember that the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, and that's under the Commerce Clause. But specific regulations, like one-way streets, are usually regulated by the states, not the federal government. However, Congress does have the power to regulate transportation within the District of Columbia, I think.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Invalid because it conflicts with the D.C. City Council's previous ordinance. Hmm, thestatute is for travel back and forth, which is probably a matter of public safety and efficiency. A conflict with an existing two-lane street might be seen as a violation, but is that enough? I'm not sure. The two-lane was for two-way use, and making it one-way would change that. But does that directly conflict with the existing law? Maybe not, as the city council's law was for two-way traffic, but the federal statute is about allowing travel without being stuck. So maybe A isn't the strongest argument.

Option B: Valid within Congress's power over transportation. I think the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, and that includes regulating transportation. So this seems correct.

Option C: Invalid because it infringes on rights of D.C. residents. But if this is a regular street regulation, it's probably not about the rights of the residents. It's more about the necessity and convenience, not rights. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Infringes on interstate commerce. That's the Tenth Amendment's concern. But I thought the Tenth Amendment only applies to states, not the federal government. However, Congress can regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. Oh wait, but the federal government's power over interstate commerce is under the 13th and 14th Amendments. Or is it the 13th and 14th? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the 13th Amendment allows states to regulate interstate commerce, but Congress's power over commerce is in the 14th and 15th. So does Congress have the power to regulate interstate commerce? I think so â€” Congress can regulate interstate commerce, but not states. But the question is about the validity of the statute, not whether Congress can do it.

Option E: Valid because it's a proper exercise of Congress's power. But again, it's about a federal regulation, which I thought is a state matter. So E might be incorrect.

Option F: Violates Tenth Amendment. I think Tenth is about states, so probably not.

Option G: Valid because Congress has exclusive power over DC. I'm not sure if that's accurate. Congress's power over DC isn't exclusive in the traditional sense. They have the power to regulate transportation within DC, but I think it's more about Congress's ability to regulate matters that affect commerce. Also, the 13th Amendment allows states to regulate, but Congress can regulate commerce in the same way as states, but they can't regulate interstate commerce itself.

Option H: Valid because Congress can regulate interstate commerce. Wait, I'm getting confused. The 14th Amendment says Congress has the power to pass laws for the purposes of commerce, and that power includes regulating interstate commerce. So if the statute is for the purpose of allowing travel without traffic, that seems to be a business necessity. So H seems correct.

Option I: Valid because it serves a clear government interest. The interest is about making travel easier, which is good for efficiency, so that's a clear interest.

Option J: Valid because it serves a clear interest. Same as I.

Wait, but the question is which statement is the most accurate.

So let's reevaluate.

The original City Council passed a two-lane street, which was probably for two-way traffic. Now, making it one-way is to allow single travel, perhaps for emergency services or for efficiency. As a public convenience, it's a government interest.

The key here is whether this is a violation of the Constitution. So, the federal statute is regulating a public street within the District of Columbia, which is a state matter. But Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, which includes regulating transportation within the state. So the act here is a proper exercise of Congress's power.

Alternatively, the city council's two-lane was for two-way, so the federal one-way makes sense as a public convenience. So I think that makes it a valid exercise of Congress's power.

So, looking at the options, G says "valid because Congress has exclusive power over DC." But I think that's not accurate. The power isn't exclusive; Congress has a general power over commerce, which includes regulating transportation. So G might be incorrect.

Option H is "valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce." That sounds correct.

Option I and J both say it's valid because it serves a clear governmental interest, which is correct.

Wait, which is more accurate? The question is about which is the most accurate statement.

The question is asking which statement is correct.

Looking back: So the statute is a proper exercise of Congress's power. So the answer is either H or I or J.

Option H says, "It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce." Yes, that's correct because Congress has that power, and this statute is for the purpose of regulating interstate commerce.

Option I: "It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest." That's also correct because the interest is to serve a clear purpose.

But the question is about the constitutionality, not the reason. So both H and I are correct statements.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the following is the most accurate statement.

Looking at the options, the correct answers are either H or I.

Wait, but I may have misremembered: the 14th Amendment's power to regulate commerce applies to all states, but Congress has the power to regulate commerce within the state, including DC.

So the correct reasoning is that Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, so the statute is valid.

So the correct answer would be H or I.

Question is, which is the most accurate. So both H and I are correct, but which is the best answer.

Wait, the question is about the most accurate.

Option H: "It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce." That is correct.

Option I: "It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest." Correct as well.

So the question is, which is the most accurate. Both H and I are correct statements.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I should pick the one that is the best.

The question is about the constitutionality. So which of the options address the constitutional issues.

Option G: "It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over DC." No, that's not accurate. The power isn't exclusive.

Option H: "valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce." That's correct.

Option I: "valid because it serves a clear governmental interest." Also correct.

So the correct answers are H and I. But the question is about which is the most accurate statement.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, so only one correct option is right. So which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the other options: 

Option G: "valid because Congress has exclusive power over DC." No, because the power is not exclusive.

Option J: "valid because it serves a clear interest." That's correct, but not the reason.

Option I is correct but perhaps more direct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct regarding the constitutionality. So the correct answer is H or I.

Wait, let me think about the Tenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause.

The Tenth Amendment doesn't apply here because it's about states. The 14th Amendment's power applies to the federal government as well. So the question is about the federal power.

So the federal power over interstate commerce is under the 14th and 15th Amendments, not the Tenth. So the 10th doesn't apply here.

Therefore, the correct answer is either H or I.

Looking again, the question is about the most accurate statement. So which is correct.

Option G is incorrect. So: 

The statute is a regulation of a public street within DC, which Congress has the power to regulate. Hence, it's valid.

So the correct answer is either H or I.

Wait, but the question has options H and I as correct? Let me recheck the options.

Looking at the options:

Option H: "It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce." Correct.

Option I: "It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest." Correct.

But the question is which is the most accurate.

Hmm, perhaps the better answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps both are correct, but the question is which is the best answer.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So both H and I are correct. But maybe the better answer is H, as the reasoning is about the power to regulate commerce.

Wait, the question is about the exercise of power, so the correct statements are H and I. So the answer is either H or I.

Wait, but the question asks which is the most accurate. Both are accurate. But the options are single-choice.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the possible answers.

Wait, I think I was correct that H and I are both correct statements. But the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps the question is tricking me.

Wait, the question is about the validity of the statute. So, perhaps the answer is H, because the power to regulate commerce is a broader statement.

Wait, but the key point is that the statute is a regulation within DC, which the federal government can regulate as part of its power. So H is correct.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option G: "it is valid because Congress has exclusive power over DC." No, because the power isn't exclusive.

Option J: "valid because it serves a clear interest." That's correct but not the reason.

Option I: "valid because it serves a clear interest." Correct.

So options I and H are both correct. But the question is about the most accurate statement.

Wait, the question is about the validity, and both I and H are correct. But perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Wait, the question has options H and I as correct, but the question is which is the most accurate statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, because it's a proper exercise of the power. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think about the actual application. The statute is a regulation of a street that's within DC, so it's a regulation within the state. Therefore, Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce. So that would support option H.

So the correct answer is either H or I.

Looking again, the options:

H: valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.

I: valid because it serves a clear governmental interest.

Both are correct. But the question is about the most accurate statement.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H. Because the power is not exclusive. The power is the general power, not exclusive. So G is incorrect. So the correct answer must be between H and I.

Wait, but the question is about the constitutional validity. So the key is that Congress has the power to regulate commerce, which includes this statute. So option H is correct.

Hence, the correct answer is H.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a federal statute in Washington, D.C., that makes Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street to allow travel back and forth without being tied up in traffic. The statute is compared to a previous two-lane street ordinance in the City Council. The analysis evaluates each option to determine the most accurate statement regarding the statute's constitutionality.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: "It is invalid because it conflicts with the ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., City Council."**  
   While the two-lane street was for two-way traffic, the federal statute's one-way designation changes the nature of the traffic (one-way instead of two-way). However, this does not conflict with the existing law; it simply serves a different purpose. Thus, this option is not the strongest argument.

2. **Option B: "It is valid as it is within the purview of Congress's power over transportation."**  
   Congress does have the power to regulate transportation within the District of Columbia, including regulating public streets. This statement is accurate but does not address the constitutional basis of the regulation.

3. **Option C: "It is invalid because the law infringes upon the rights of the residents of Washington, D.C."**  
   The statute does not infringe on the rights of residents; it is more about the necessity of regulating public streets for efficiency and convenience.

4. **Option D: "It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce."**  
   This option conflates the Tenth Amendment's concerns with the Commerce Clause. The Tenth Amendment does not apply here, and the statute does not discriminatory its commerce.

5. **Option E: "It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power."**  
   This is incorrect because Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce is under the Commerce Clause, not its enumerated property power.

6. **Option F: "It is valid because it violates the Tenth Amendment."**  
   This is incorrect because the Tenth Amendment does not apply to federal regulate of interstate commerce.

7. **Option G: "It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia."**  
   This is incorrect because Congress does not have exclusive power over DC; it has general power over commerce, which includes regulating public streets within the state.

8. **Option H: "It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce."**  
   This is correct. Congress has the power under the 14th Amendment to regulate interstate commerce, and this statute serves the purpose of doing so.

9. **Option I: "It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest."**  
   This is also correct, as the interest is to provide convenience and efficiency for residents.

10. **Option J: "It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest."**  
    This is correct, but it is a more general statement rather than the reason why the statute is valid.

### Conclusion:
Both options H and I are accurate, but the question asks for the **most accurate statement**. Option H is more precise because it directly addresses the power Congress has under the Commerce Clause, which is central to the issue. Therefore, the best answer is:

ANSWER: H
