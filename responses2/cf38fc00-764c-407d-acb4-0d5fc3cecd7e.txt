Okay, so I've got this question about the global population without safe drinking water as of 2019. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking for the percentage of people without safe water. I remember reading somewhere that about half the world relies on tap water, but that's maybe from a while back. Let me recall. 

Wait, I think the situation is that around 70% of the population doesn't have access to safe drinking water. I'm pretty sure that's the case now because of the ongoing issues with contaminated water sources. Also, I remember hearing that many communities still face water shortages and lack access to safe water supplies, especially in developing countries. 

So the options are A to J, with H being 20%. If the figure is around 70%, that would point to option B. But wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think I'm confusing that with another percentage. No, no, 70% is correct because 30% have access and 70% don't. So the correct answer should be B: 70%.

The correct answer is 70%, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
