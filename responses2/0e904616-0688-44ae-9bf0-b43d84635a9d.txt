Okay, so I've got this double-slit experiment question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through. Let me see. The question says D is 0.1 mm and L is 1 meter. The light used is yellow, and I need to find the spacing between adjacent bright lines. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in a double-slit experiment, the formula for the bright lines (constructive interference) is something like d * sin(theta) = m * lambda, where d is the distance between the slits, theta is the angle from the central maximum, m is the order of the bright line, and lambda is the wavelength of the light.

But wait, in this problem, are we assuming the angle is small, so sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ y/L, where y is the distance from the central maximum on the screen. Oh right, that's when the angles are small, which is probably the case here because they don't give us any angles. So the formula simplifies to y = (m * lambda * L) / d.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the spacing between adjacent bright lines (the distance between m and m+1) would be delta y = (lambda * L) / d. Because the distance between m and m+1 is just the difference in their positions.

So the key here is to find the wavelength of yellow light. But wait, the question doesn't give the wavelength. Oh wait, I think I remember that yellow light is approximately 580 nm, which is 580e-9 meters. Or maybe 5800 angstroms? Because 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. Yeah, 5800 angstroms is 580 nm.

So let me get the numbers right. D is the distance between the slits, which is 0.1 mm. That's 0.1e-3 meters. L is 1 meter. The wavelength lambda is 580e-9 meters.

Now, the separation delta y between adjacent bright lines (which would be for m and m+1) is given by delta y = (lambda * L) / d.

Plugging in the numbers:

delta y = (580e-9 m) * (1 m) / (0.1e-3 m)

Let me calculate that. First, 580e-9 is 5.8e-7.

So 5.8e-7 * 1 = 5.8e-7. Divide by 0.1e-3. Oh wait, 0.1e-3 is 1e-4. So 5.8e-7 divided by 1e-4 is 5.8e-3 meters. Because 1e-7 / 1e-4 is 1e-3.

So 5.8e-3 meters is 5.8 mm. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is either option A (3 mm) or perhaps something else. Wait, but I'm not sure about the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck. The formula for the position of bright fringes is y = (m lambda L) / d. So the separation between m and m+1 is delta y = (lambda L) / d.

Wait, yes, because for m and m+1, y increases by delta y. So yeah, delta y = lambda L / d.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recalculate that. Oh, wait, 580e-9 * 1 / (0.1e-3) =

Hmm, 580e-9 is 5.8e-7, L is 1. d is 0.1e-3 m, which is 1e-4 m.

So 5.8e-7 * 1 = 5.8e-7. Divided by 1e-4 is 5.8e-3 meters, which is 5.8 mm. But the options don't have 5.8. The closest is option A: 3mm, but that's way less.

Wait, did I mess up the units? Wait, D is 0.1 mm, which is 0.1e-3 meters. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 0.1 mm is 0.0001 meters. So d is 0.0001 m. So the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it step by step:

lambda = 580 nm = 580e-9 m = 5.8e-7 m.

d = 0.1 mm = 0.1e-3 m = 1e-4 m.

So delta y = (5.8e-7 m) * (1 m) / (1e-4 m) = (5.8e-7) / (1e-4) m.

Divide 5.8e-7 by 1e-4:

5.8e-7 / 1e-4 = 5.8e-3 m = 5.8 mm.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A (3mm) or perhaps I made a mistake in the wavelength.

Wait, wait! Did I mix up the units for the wavelength? Oh no, probably. Let me think again. Oh, wait, 580 nm is 580e-9 meters, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe I confused the formula. Let me think: in the double slit experiment, the separation between adjacent bright fringes (delta y) is given by delta y = (lambda L) / d.

Wait, another way: when you have m=0, it's the central maximum. For delta y between m=0 and m=1, it's the first bright line beyond the center.

So yes, delta y = (lambda L)/(d) = (580e-9 m)(1 m)/(0.1e-3 m).

So 580e-9 *1 = 580e-9. Divided by 0.1e-3: which is 1e-4.

So 580e-9 / 1e-4 = 580e-5 m? Wait, because 580e-9 is 5.8e-7. 5.8e-7 / 1e-4 = 5.8e-3 m, which is 5.8 mm. So 5.8 mm is 5.8e-3 meters.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A (3 mm) or perhaps B (9 mm). Wait, but I think I must have made a mistake because the options are much larger.

Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check the formula for the fringe separation.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the position of the m-th bright fringe is y_m = (m lambda L) / d.

So the separation between y_m and y_{m+1} is delta y = lambda L / d.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I have the wavelength wrong. Wait, let me think about common wavelengths. Yellow light is actually around 580 nm, so 580e-9 m. But wait, I'm not so sure. Wait, sometimes people use 580 nm for yellow, but sometimes 587 nm. Oh wait, maybe in the question, they have a different wavelength. Wait, the question doesn't state the wavelength, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using different units. Like, D is 0.1 mm, which is 0.0001 meters. L is 1 meter.

Wait, let's compute delta y again.

(580e-9 m) * (1 m) / (0.1e-3 m) 

= (580e-9 * 1) / (0.1e-3) 

= 580e-9 / 0.1e-3 

= (580e-9) / (1e-4) 

580e-9 divided by 1e-4 is 580e-5.

580e-5 meters is 5.8e-3 meters, which is 5.8 mm.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the units. Wait, 0.1 mm is 0.0001 m. So d is 0.0001 m.

So (580e-9 m * 1 m) / (0.0001 m) = (580e-9) / (0.0001) m.

Wait, 580e-9 is 0.00000058 m. Divided by 0.0001 m.

Wait, 0.00000058 / 0.0001 = 0.0058 m.

0.0058 meters is 5.8 mm. Hmm, same result.

Wait, but the options don't have 5.8 mm. The closest is option A (3mm) or option B (9mm). Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the bright lines is y_m = (m lambda L) / d.

So delta y between consecutive lines is (lambda L) / d.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, perhaps I should express d in meters correctly. Oh, d is 0.1 mm, which is 0.1e-3 m.

So 580e-9 = 5.8e-7 m.

Then delta y = (5.8e-7 m) * 1 m / (0.1e-3 m) = (5.8e-7) / (0.1e-3) m.

Which is 5.8e-7 / 0.1e-3 = 5.8e-4 / 1e-3 * 10? Wait, perhaps better to compute exponents.

5.8e-7 divided by 0.1e-3 = (5.8e-7) / (1e-4 * 1e-1) ) = (5.8e-7) / (1e-5) )= 5.8e-2 m = 0.058 m = 58 mm. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, I'm getting 58 mm, which is 58 mm, but the options are way smaller. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another possibility: maybe the formula is (2d sin(theta)) because in double-slit, the bright lines are at angles, but when theta is small, sin(theta) is approximately y/L. But I think that's what I've been using.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the formula is (m+1/2) lambda L / d, but that's when you're using the positions of the bright fringes.

Wait, no, I think the central maximum is m=0, the first is m=1, so the separation between m and m+1 is delta y = (lambda L) / d.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers again:

lambda = 580e-9 m.

d = 0.1 mm = 0.1e-3 m.

L = 1 m.

So, delta y = (580e-9 * 1) / (0.1e-3) = (580e-9) / (0.1e-3) = (580e-9) / (1e-4) = 5.8e-3 m = 5.8 mm.

Wait, so 5.8mm is the correct answer, but it's not in the options. Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

Options:

A: 3 mm

B: 9mm

C:1.5 mm

D:10 mm

E:6 mm

F:15mm

G:7.5mm

H:12mm

I:6mm

J:18mm

Wait, but none of these are 5.8 mm. So, did I get the formula wrong? Or perhaps I used the wrong wavelength.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait! Could I have confused the formula for the central line? Like, perhaps the formula is (m + 0.5) lambda L / d? That would make the separation between adjacent lines (m and m+1) equal to (lambda L) / (2d).

Wait, let me think: the first bright line (m=1) is at y1 = (1 lambda L) / d = lambda L / d.

The second bright line (m=2) is at y2 = (2 lambda L) / d.

So the separation between m=1 and m=2 is delta y = (2 lambda L)/d - (lambda L)/d = (lambda L)/d.

So the same as before. So the separation is lambda L / d.

Wait, that's the same answer as before, which is 5.8 mm.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Oh wait! Oh! Wait a minute, I think I got the wrong units somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, D is 0.1 mm. So 0.1 mm is 0.0001 m. So d is 0.0001 m.

Wait, let me compute the formula again.

delta y = (lambda * L) / d.

lambda is 580e-9 m.

L is 1 m.

d is 0.0001 m.

So, 580e-9 * 1 / 0.0001 = (580e-9) / 0.0001.

Wait, 580e-9 is 5.8e-7.

5.8e-7 divided by 0.0001 is 5.8e-7 / 1e-4.

5.8e-7 / 1e-4 = 5.8e-3 m.

Which is 5.8 mm. So even after rechecking, same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the question has a different setup.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula for the bright lines. Another thought: Maybe the formula is (m + 0.5 ) lambda L / d. Because sometimes, when the order starts at m=0 (central), the first bright line would be m=1/2.

Wait, so perhaps the formula is (m + 1/2) lambda L / d. So for m=0, it's (0.5) lambda L / d, and for m=1, it's (1.5) lambda L / d. So the separation between them would be (lambda L)/(d), same as before. So the same result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (m) lambda L / d. So the separation is delta y = (m+1) lambda L /d - m lambda L/d = lambda L /d.

So it's still the same.

Wait, but none of the options match 5.8 mm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps D is the slit separation, but in the question, D is 0.1 mm. Oh, wait, but the formula uses distance between slits, which is D.

Wait, unless I mixed D and d. No, because in the formula, it's d, the slit separation.

Wait, perhaps the question used a different wavelength, say 600 nm?

If lambda were 600 nm, which is 6e-7 m.

Then delta y would be (6e-7 * 1) / (0.1e-3) = 6e-7 / 0.1e-3 = 6e-4 m = 0.06 meters, which is 60 mm. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the wavelength is 400 nm (blue), which is 4e-7 m.

Then delta y = (4e-7 * 1) / (0.1e-3) = 4e-4 m = 40 mm. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the question uses the wrong slit distance. Oh, or perhaps I'm supposed to use D as the distance between the slits, but I might have misread the question.

Wait, the question says D=0.1 mm. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is delta y = (m + 0.5) lambda L / d. Let's compute that:

(m=0: 0.5 * 580e-9 * 1 / 0.1e-3 )= 0.5 * 580e-9 / 0.1e-3 = 0.5 * 5.8e-3 = 2.9e-3 m (2.9 mm). That's option A (3 mm) approximately. But that's a guess.

But why would the formula be (m+0.5) lambda L /d? That would happen if the central fringe is m=0.5. But I thought the central fringe is m=0.

Wait, the formula for bright fringes in double-slit is y = (m lambda L)/d, where m=0,1,2,...

So for m=0, y=0 (central fringe). For m=1, y = (lambda L)/d.

So the separation between m=0 and m=1 is (lambda L)/d, which is about 5.8 mm.

But the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of lambda. Wait, 580 nm is indeed 580e-9 m. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is delta y = (m + ½ ) lambda L / d, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think my confusion comes from whether the formula is delta y = (m) * (lambda L) / d or delta y = (m + ½) * (lambda L) / d.

If I'm using (m) * (lambda L) / d, then the separation is (lambda L) / d.

Which is what I did earlier, giving 5.8 mm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the distance between the slits is D, which is 0.1 mm. So that's correct.

Wait, I'm not seeing any error in the calculation, but the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is delta y = (m + ½) lambda L / d.

So, for m=0: (0.5) lambda L / d = 0.5 * 580e-9 * 1 / 0.1e-3 = 0.5 *580e-6 / 0.1e-3.

Wait, 580e-6 is 5.8e-4.

So 0.5 *5.8e-4 / 0.1e-3 = 0.5 *5.8e-4 /1e-4.

Hmm, 5.8e-4 divided by 1e-4 is 5.8.

0.5 *5.8 = 2.9 mm.

Which would match option A (3 mm) approximately. But why would the formula use ½?

Wait, no, the formula for bright fringes is y = m lambda L / d. So for m=0, y=0. For m=1, y=lambda L / d. So the separation is (lambda L)/d.

But if the problem uses the central fringe as m=½, then the separation would be (½ lambda L)/d. But that's not how it's usually done. I think it's always m=0,1,2, etc.

Wait, perhaps the formula is y = (m + ½) lambda L / d.

Wait, let me compute delta y in that case. For m=0, y = ½ lambda L /d. For m=1, y = (1 + ½) lambda L /d = 1.5 lambda L /d. So delta y would be (1.5 - 0.5) lambda L /d = lambda L /d.

Wait, same result. So the separation is the same as before, 5.8 mm.

Hmm, but I'm still not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options' values.

Wait, looking back at the options, the closest would be 6 mm (option I:6mm), but that's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the wavelength. Let me think again.

Wait, no, 580 nm is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is delta y = (m + 0.5) lambda L / d.

Which would give us delta y = (m+0.5) * 580e-9 * 1 / 0.1e-3.

Wait, for m=0: (0.5) *580e-9 / 0.1e-3 = (0.5 *5.8e-7) /1e-4.

Wait, 0.5 *5.8e-7 = 2.9e-7.

Divide by 1e-4: 2.9e-7 / 1e-4 = 2.9e-3 m = 2.9 mm.

Hmm, that's not matching any option either. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula y = (m) lambda L / d, but I'm using another formula elsewhere, like for interference in single-slit, which is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I confused the formula for the central bright fringe.

Wait, no, the central maximum is the zeroth order. So the first order is m=1, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the separation between the first and second bright fringes to be computed using the formula y = (m) lambda L / d, but I'm using another approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct calculation and see what the answer is.

Wait, according to the options, the correct answer isn't among them. So perhaps the problem has a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the formula.

Wait, let me think again about the formula for the bright fringes in the double-slit experiment.

The bright fringes are located at positions y = m * (lambda L)/d, where m is an integer (0, 1, 2, ...).

So, the spacing between two consecutive bright fringes is delta y = (m+1) * (lambda L)/d - m * (lambda L)/d = (lambda L)/d.

So, the separation is (lambda L)/d.

Which is exactly the formula I used.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but I'm not getting any of the options. So perhaps the question intended to use a different wavelength.

Wait, let me try with lambda = 550 nm.

Wait, 550 nm is 550e-9 m.

So delta y = (550e-9 * 1) / (0.1e-3) = 5.5e-7 / 1e-4 = 5.5e-3 m = 5.5 mm, which is close to option A (3 mm) and option J (18 mm). Hmm, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question meant 550 nm instead of 580 nm.

Wait, but I can't change the question. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is delta y = (m + 0.5) lambda L / d. But I think that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, if the central fringe is m=0, the first bright fringe is m=1, so their positions are y1 = (1) lambda L / d, and y2 = (2) lambda L / d.

So the separation is y2 - y1 = lambda L / d.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to compute the answer again.

lambda = 580 nm = 580e-9 m.

d = 0.1 mm = 0.0001 m.

So, delta y = (580e-9 * 1) / (0.0001) = (580e-9) / (1e-4) = 5.8e-3 m = 5.8 mm.

Which is 5.8 mm.

But the options don't have 5.8 mm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is delta y = (m + 0.5) lambda L / d.

So, for m=0: delta y = (0.5) *580e-9 / 0.1e-3 = 0.5 *5.8e-3 = 2.9 mm.

Which is option A (3 mm) approximately.

But why would the formula use 0.5? Because perhaps in the formula, the central maximum is considered to be at m=0.5.

Wait, that would make sense. So the formula is y = (m +0.5) lambda L / d.

So, for m=0: y=0.5 lambda L / d.

For m=1: y=1.5 lambda L / d.

So the separation is delta y = (1.5 -0.5) lambda L /d = lambda L /d.

Same result.

So even with that formula, the delta y is 5.8 mm.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. So perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options provided and that the problem may have an error.
</think>

To determine the spacing between adjacent bright fringes in a double-slit experiment, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta y = \frac{\lambda L}{d}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light,
- \( L \) is the distance between the slits and the screen,
- \( d \) is the distance between the two slits.

### Given Data:
- \( d = 0.1 \, \text{mm} = 0.0001 \, \text{m} \),
- \( L = 1 \, \text{m} \),
- \( \lambda = 580 \, \text{nm} = 580 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).

### Calculation:
1. Substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   \Delta y = \frac{(580 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot 1}{0.0001}
   \]

2. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   \Delta y = \frac{580 \times 10^{-9}}{0.0001} = \frac{5.8 \times 10^{-7}}{1 \times 10^{-4}} = 5.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 5.8 \, \text{mm}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The spacing between adjacent bright fringes is \( 5.8 \, \text{mm} \). However, none of the provided options match this result. It is possible that there is an error in the problem setup or the options. If the options are as listed, the correct answer should not be among them.
