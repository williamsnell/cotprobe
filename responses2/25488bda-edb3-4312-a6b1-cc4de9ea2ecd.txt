Okay, so I have this question about insurance premiums and losses. Let me read it again. The question is asking for the premium on a $60,000 policy with a rate of $.2065 per $100. Then, how much would the insurance company pay on a loss of $61,000. The options are A to I.

Hmm, let me break this down. I think the premium is calculated based on a certain rate per $100, and the loss payment is likely the total loss or something like that. 

Starting with the premium. The rate is $.2065 per $100. So, for every $100, the premium is $0.2065. I need to find the total premium for $60,000. 

Wait, so, 60,000 divided by 100 is 600. Because each $100 is a unit. So, 600 units at $0.2065 each. Let me calculate that.

600 multiplied by 0.2065. Let me compute that step by step. 600 * 0.2 is 120, and 600 * 0.0065 is 3.9. So adding those together: 120 + 3.9 = 123.9. So the premium would be $123.90. But looking at the options, the first number should be one of the choices. Let me check the options for the first part.

Looking at the options, options E and I have 123 and 126 for the first part. Options A and D have 124 and 118. Wait, but I got 123.9, which is approximately $124. So the first number is 124. So the first part of the answer is 124.

Now the second part: how much would the insurance company pay on a loss of $61,000? Oh wait, wait. I think I might have confused the calculation. Let me think again. The loss amount is $61,000. How much does the insurance company pay based on the rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the loss is covered by the policy. So the premium is based on the policy's coverage, not the loss itself. Wait, but the question says "how much would the insurance company pay on a loss of $61,000." So maybe they're asking for the amount paid by the company after a loss. Or perhaps the insurance company's payout is the loss amount minus the policy's coverage? No, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's the policy's coverage, but that's probably not.

Wait, another approach: The rate is per $100 of the policy's coverage. So if the policy is for $60,000, the premium is $123.90 as before. But for the loss, the company might pay the full amount of the loss if it's covered. But wait, the policy's coverage is $60,000, so a loss over that would be the company not paying anything. But that doesn't make sense because the rate would be per $100 again. So maybe the question is about how much the company would pay based on the rate.

Wait, perhaps the insurance company's payment is the loss amount multiplied by the rate. Or maybe it's the amount covered by the policy. Oh wait, the rate is per $100 of the policy's coverage. So, the loss is $61,000. The insurance company would pay the amount of the loss that's covered by the policy, which is $60,000. So, $60,000 is covered, so the company pays $60,000. Or wait, if the loss is $61,000, the insurance company would pay the amount of the loss, but only up to the policy's coverage. So, the insurance company would pay $60,000, and the excess is $1,000. But that doesn't seem right, because the rate is per $100 of the policy's coverage.

Wait, perhaps the premium is based on the policy's coverage, but the loss is another calculation. Let me read the question again: "the premium on a $60,000 policy if the rate is $.2065 per $100." Then, "how much would the insurance company pay on a loss of $61,000?"

Wait, perhaps the insurance company's payment for the loss is the total loss minus the policy's coverage, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the company covers the loss up to the policy's coverage, so the payment is the loss amount beyond that. No, that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps the insurance company would pay the full loss amount if it's within the policy's coverage. But if the loss is over the policy's coverage, then the company doesn't pay anything. So for a loss of $61,000, the company pays $60,000, because that's what the policy covers. Wait, but the policy is for $60,000, so a loss of $61,000 would be over by $1,000. So the company only covers the policy's $60,000, so they pay $60,000.

But let me think again. The rate is $0.2065 per $100 of policy coverage. So for $60,000, the premium is 60,000 /100 * 0.2065 = 600 * 0.2065 = 123.9, so $123.90. Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $123.90. Looking at the options, the first part is 124.00, so that's correct.

Now the second part: the insurance company's payment for a $61,000 loss. So, the policy is for $60,000. So the company pays the full $60,000 for the loss, because the policy covers up to $60,000. So the payment is $60,000. But wait, looking at the options, the second part of the answer is either 60,000 or 61,000. Wait, option F is 60,500. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the loss amount beyond the policy's coverage. So, the loss is $61,000, and the policy only covers $60,000. So the insurance company would pay the amount of the loss, but only up to the policy's coverage. So, the company would pay $60,000, but perhaps the question is asking for the amount they pay based on the rate. Or maybe it's considering the policy's coverage as the basis. Wait, perhaps the payment is the loss amount minus the policy's coverage, but that would be $1,000, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the rate is applied per $100 of the loss. So, 61,000 /100 = 610. 610 * 0.2065.

Let me calculate that. 610 * 0.2065:

First, 600 * 0.2065 is 123.90.

10 * 0.2065 is 2.065.

Adding them gives 123.90 + 2.065 = 125.965. So approximately $126.

Looking at the options, option I is 126 and 61,000. So the first part is 126, the second is 61,000. But wait, the options are:

Looking at the options, the second part in option I is 61,000. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the options, the second part is sometimes 61,000, sometimes 60,500. So in the first option, A: 124 and 60,000. Option E is 123 and 61,000. Option I is 126 and 61,000.

But earlier, we thought that the company would pay $60,000 for the loss. So why is the second part 61,000 in some options?

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Let me re-read.

The question is: "What is the premium on a $60,000 policy if the rate is $.2065 per $100? How much would the insurance company pay on a loss of $61,000?"

So, the policy covers up to $60,000. So the loss of $61,000 is beyond the policy's coverage. Therefore, the insurance company would only cover the $60,000, so the payment is $60,000. But wait, that's not one of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 60,000

Option I: 61,000

Wait, none of the options have 60,000 as the second part. The options include 61,000 and 60,500. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the insurance company's payment is based on the policy's limit. So, the policy is for $60,000. So the loss is $61,000. The insurance company pays up to $60,000, so they would pay $60,000. But that's not an option.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the rate is applied per $100 of the loss. So for a loss of $61,000, the company would pay 61,000 /100 * 0.2065.

Wait, 61,000 divided by 100 is 610. 610 * 0.2065.

610 * 0.2 is 122, and 610 * 0.0065 is 3.965. So total is 122 + 3.965 = 125.965, which is approximately $126. So the payment is $126.

Looking at the options, the first part is 126, the second part is 61,000. So that would correspond to option I: 126 and 61,000.

Wait, but earlier I thought the company would only pay $60,000. So perhaps I was wrong, and the correct answer is 126 and 61,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the loss is within the policy's coverage, so the company pays the full $60,000. So the payment is $60,000.

But none of the options have 60,000 as the second part. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 124, 60,000

B: 120, 60,000

C: 130, 61,000

D: 118, 60,000

E: 123, 61,000

F: 122, 60,500

G: 125, 61,000

H: 120, 61,000

I: 126, 61,000

J: 124, 61,000 (not listed)

K: 125, 61,000 (not listed)

So, the only options with 61,000 as the second part are F and I.

Now between F (60,000) and I (61,000). Which is correct?

If the insurance company covers the loss up to the policy's coverage, which is $60,000, then they pay $60,000. But that's not an option. But looking at option F, the first part is 122, which is 60,000 * 0.2065 = 123.90, approx 124. So the first part would be 124, second part 60,000 (option F: 124 and 60,000). But that would imply the policy covers up to $60,000, and the loss is $61k, so the company only pays $60,000.

But option F says 60,000 for the second part. So for the question, the second part is the insurance company's payment, which would be 60,000. But looking at the options, option F says the first number is 124 and the second is 60,000.

So the correct answer would be F: 124 and 60,000. But the options don't have a 60,000 for the second part. Wait, no, option F says the second part is 60,000. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but let me think again. The rate is $0.2065 per $100 of policy coverage. So for $60,000, the premium is 600 * 0.2065 = 123.9, so 124. That's the first part. For the loss, the insurance company would pay the full $60,000, so the second part is 60,000. So the correct option is F: 124 and 60,000.

But wait, the options don't have 60,000 as the second part. Oh, looking again, option F is 124 and 60,000, which is correct.

Wait, the question is: "How much would the insurance company pay on a loss of $61,000?" So the correct payment is $60,000. So option F says 124 and 60,000. So the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the first part. Let me confirm the first part again.

$60,000 policy. Rate is $0.2065 per $100.

60,000 / 100 = 600.

600 * 0.2065 = 123.9, so 123.90, which rounds to 124. So the first part is 124.

So the answer must be F: 124 and 60,000.

To determine the premium and insurance company payment:

1. **Premium Calculation**:  
   The policy covers $60,000. The rate is $0.2065 per $100.  
   Number of units = $60,000 / $100 = 600 units.  
   Premium = 600 * $0.2065 = $123.90.  
   Rounded to $124.

2. **Insurance Payment for Loss**:  
   The loss is $61,000, and the policy covers $60,000.  
   The insurance company pays the full $60,000 for the loss.

Thus, the correct answer is **F: $124 and $60,000**.
