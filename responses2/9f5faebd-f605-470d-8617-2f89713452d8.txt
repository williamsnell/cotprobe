Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple choice question. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about Donald Super's __________ graphically depicting the correspondence between an individual’s life roles and life stages. The options are A through J, each with a different graphical representation.

First, I need to remember what Donald Super is known for. I think he's a person who created a specific type of diagram. From what I recall, Donald Super is associated with the Life Path Diagram, also known as the Life Path Graph. This diagram illustrates how a person's life stages are connected to their roles. 

Looking at the options, option G is Life Path Diagram. That rings a bell. The Life Path Graph is a visual tool that shows the progression from birth into life, showing how different life stages (like birth, early life, working, etc.) correspond to various roles someone might play in society, politics, religion, etc.

Let me go through the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A is a life career rainbow, which doesn't sound right because I don't remember a rainbow representing life roles. Option B is an octagon, which doesn't relate to life stages or roles. Option C is life cycle wheel, which I think isn't about roles. Option D is life stage map, which sounds close but I'm not sure if it's the same as the life path diagram. Option E is life staircase, which might imply a step-by-step progression but I don't think that's the standard term. Option F is career ladder, which is more about career progression, not the correspondence to life roles. Option H is role spectrum, which is broader but not specific to a diagram. Option I is a mandala, which is a design with many circles and lines, not related. Option J is a career tree, which shows career branches but again, not the same as the life path diagram.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: life path diagram. It's the only option that directly corresponds to Donald Super's work. I think I'm confident now.

The correct answer is G: life path diagram. This diagram illustrates the progression of life stages and their corresponding roles, as identified by Donald Super.

Answer: G
