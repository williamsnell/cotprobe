Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about a skier going down a hill and then coasting on snow. I need to find the coefficient of kinetic friction between the skis and snow. Let's see what I remember.

First, the skier is 90 kg, starting from rest. The hill is inclined at 17 degrees, she skis 100 meters down, then coasts 70 meters on level snow until stopping. I need to find the coefficient of kinetic friction. Hmm.

I think I should break this into two parts: the downhill part and the level part. Maybe I can use energy conservation principles, but wait, since there's friction, some energy is lost as heat. Oh right, so work done by friction is involved.

Let me think about the first part—down the hill. The skier starts from rest, so her initial kinetic energy is zero. She's going down a slope, so her gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy minus the work done by friction.

So, the potential energy at the top is mgh, where h is the vertical height. The distance she skis is 100 m along the incline. The height h would be 100 * sin(17°), right? Because the height is the opposite side in a right triangle where the hypotenuse is 100 m.

Wait, let me write that down. The vertical height h = 100 * sin(17°). I'll need to compute that. But maybe I can keep it symbolic for now. So, the gravitational potential energy (PE) is mgh, and the kinetic energy at the bottom is (1/2)mv², but since there's friction, some of that energy is lost as heat.

So the work done by friction is (force of friction) * distance. The force of friction is μk * N, where N is the normal force. On an incline, the normal force is mg cosθ. So the work done by friction is μk * mg cosθ * s, where s is 100 m.

Putting it all together, the energy equation for the downhill part is:

PE = KE + Work done by friction.

So, mgh = (1/2)mv² + μk mg cosθ * s.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for v². Let me see:

mgh = (1/2)mv² + μk mg cosθ * s.

Divide both sides by m:

gh = (1/2)v² + μk g cosθ s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck:

The equation is mgh = (1/2 mv²) + (μk mg cosθ * s). 

Divide each term by m:

g h = (1/2) v² + μk g cosθ s.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So, solving for v²:

(1/2) v² = g h (1 - μk cosθ (2 s) / h )

Wait, maybe it's better to solve for v².

Wait, let me rearrange again:

gh = (1/2) v² + μk g cosθ s.

So, (1/2)v² = gh - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply both sides by 2: v² = 2 g h (1 - μk cosθ (s/(h))) ) — Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute h first. Let's compute h numerically. 100 m * sin(17°). Sin(17°) is approximately 0.2924. So 100 * 0.2924 = 29.24 meters. So h = 29.24 m.

So, compute v² = 2 g h - 2 μk g cosθ * s.

Wait, no, let's substitute. From mgh = (1/2 mv²) + μk mg cosθ s.

Divide both sides by m: g h = (1/2) v² + μk g cosθ s.

So (1/2) v² = g h - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply by 2: v² = 2 g h - 2 μk g cosθ s.

But perhaps I can factor out 2 g:

v² = 2 g (h - μk cosθ s / 1 )

Wait, perhaps better to write:

v² = 2g h - 2 μk g cosθ s.

Hmm. Now, let's compute each term.

g is 9.8 m/s².

h is 29.24 m.

cosθ for 17 degrees is cos(17) ≈ 0.9563.

s is 100 m.

1. Compute 2 g h: 2 * 9.8 * 29.24. Let's see: 9.8 * 29.24 ≈ 286.592; multiplied by 2 is 573.184.

2. Compute 2 μk g cosθ s: 2 * μk * 9.8 * 0.9563 * 100.

Which is 2 * 9.8 * 0.9563 * 100 * μk.

Compute 9.8 * 0.9563 ≈ 9.3717.

Multiply by 2: 18.7434.

Multiply by 100: 1874.34. So this term is 1874.34 * μk.

So v² = 573.184 - 1874.34 * μk.

But wait, that's not possible, because v² must be positive. Wait, that would be correct only if 573.184 >= 1874.34 * μk. Which would require μk ≤ 573.184 / 1874.34 ≈ 0.306. So μk can't be more than about 0.306. But the options are up to 0.30, so maybe that's a way to find μk.

Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I also need to consider the second part of the motion: the skier coasts on the level snow until stopping. So, after the downhill, she's moving with some velocity v, which is the velocity at the bottom of the slope. Then she skis on level snow, where friction does work to stop her.

So, the kinetic energy she has at the bottom of the slope (v) will be converted into work done by friction until she stops. The distance is 70 m, so the work done is friction force times distance.

The friction force on level snow is μk * mg. So the work done is μk * mg * 70.

So the equation for the second part is:

(1/2)mv² = μk mg * 70.

We can rearrange this to find v²:

v² = 2 * μk * g * 70.

Again, we can plug in the numbers.

So, v² = 2 * μk * 9.8 * 70.

Compute that: 9.8 * 70 = 686. Multiply by 2: 1372. So, v² = 1372 * μk.

So now, from the first part, we have v² = 573.184 - 1874.34 * μk.

From the second part, v² = 1372 * μk.

Set them equal: 1372 μk = 573.184 - 1874.34 μk.

Let's bring all terms to one side:

1372 μk + 1874.34 μk = 573.184.

(1372 + 1874.34) μk = 573.184.

Compute 1372 + 1874.34 = 3246.34.

So: 3246.34 μk = 573.184.

Solving for μk: μk = 573.184 / 3246.34 ≈ 0.1765.

Hmm, let's compute that division. 573.184 divided by 3246.34.

Well, 3246 is about 3246.34. Let me compute 573.184 / 3246.34.

Let me compute 573184 / 3246340. Essentially, 573184 ≈ 573,000. 3246340 ≈ 3.246e6.

Well, 573,184 ÷ 3,246,340 ≈ approximately 0.1765. So about 0.176.

Looking at the options, the closest is 0.18 (option J), but 0.18 is 0.18, which is a bit higher than 0.176. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equations. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the first part: when she skis down the slope, the work done by friction is (μk mg cosθ) * s. So the energy equation is:

Potential energy (mgh) = kinetic energy (1/2 mv²) + work done by friction (μk mg cosθ s).

So,

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + μk mg cosθ s.

Divide both sides by m: gh = (1/2 v²) + μk g cosθ s.

Then rearrange:

(1/2)v² = gh - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply by 2: v² = 2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, but then in the second part, the skier coasts on level snow, so she's moving at velocity v and comes to a stop because of friction. The work done by friction is μk mg * distance (70 m). So the kinetic energy (1/2 mv²) is equal to the work done by friction:

1/2 mv² = μk mg * 70.

Divide both sides by m: 1/2 v² = μk g *70.

Multiply by 2: v² = 140 μk g.

Wait, that's a different expression than I had earlier. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake when I wrote the second equation earlier.

Wait, let me redo the second part.

After the downhill, she moves with speed v, and then coasts on snow until she stops. So the work done by friction is μk * mg * 70, and that equals the kinetic energy she has at the bottom of the slope.

So:

(1/2)mv² = μk mg * 70.

Divide both sides by m: (1/2)v² = μk g * 70.

Multiply both sides by 2: v² = 140 μk g.

Wait, so that's correct. So in the second equation, v² is 140 * μk * 9.8 m/s².

So now, the first equation after the downhill is:

v² = 2gh - 2 μk g cosθ * s.

Wait, let me compute each term again.

First, h = 100 m * sin(17°) ≈ 100 * 0.2924 ≈ 29.24 m.

So,

2gh = 2 * 9.8 * 29.24 ≈ 2 * 9.8 * 29.24 = 19.6 * 29.24 ≈ 19.6 * 29.24. Let's compute that: 20 * 29.24 is 584.8, subtract 0.4*29.24=11.696, so 584.8 - 11.696 = 573.104.

So 2gh is approximately 573.104.

Next term: 2 μk g cosθ s.

s is 100 m, so 2 * μk * 9.8 * cos(17°) * 100.

Compute cos(17°) ≈ 0.9563.

So 2 * μk * 9.8 * 0.9563 * 100.

Compute 9.8 * 0.9563 ≈ 9.3717. Multiply by 2: 18.7434. Multiply by 100: 1874.34. So term is 1874.34 * μk.

So the equation is:

v² = 573.104 - (1874.34 * μk)

So from the second part, v² = 140 * μk * 9.8.

Which is 140 * 9.8 = 1372. So,

v² = 1372 * μk.

So, setting the two expressions for v² equal:

1372 μk = 573.104 - 1874.34 μk.

Bring all terms to left:

1372 μk + 1874.34 μk = 573.104.

(1372 + 1874.34) μk = 573.104.

Sum of 1372 and 1874.34 is 3246.34.

So 3246.34 μk = 573.104.

μk = 573.104 / 3246.34 ≈ 0.1765.

So about 0.1765. Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 0.18, which is 0.18.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, 573.104 divided by 3246.34.

Let me compute 573.104 ÷ 3246.34.

Well, 3246.34 * 0.176 is: 0.176 * 3246.34.

Compute 3246.34 * 0.176:

0.1 *3246.34 = 324.634

0.07 * 3246.34 = 227.2438

0.006 * 3246.34 = 19.47804

Adding: 324.634 + 227.2438 = 551.8778 + 19.47804 ≈ 571.35584.

Wait, 0.176 * 3246.34 is approximately 571.35584.

But the numerator is 573.104, which is about 573.104 - 571.35584 = 1.74816 more than 0.176*3246.34.

So 1.74816 / 3246.34 ≈ 0.000538.

So 0.176 + 0.000538 ≈ 0.1765.

So μk is approximately 0.1765, which is around 0.1765. The options are A: 0.20, B:0.08,... J:0.18.

Hmm, 0.1765 is closer to 0.18 (option J), but perhaps I should double-check the initial equations.

Wait, let's think about the second equation. Did I make a mistake in the setup for the second part?

When the skier coasts on the level snow, she's moving with velocity v, so her kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². The work done by friction is μk mg * distance (70 m), and that work is equal to the kinetic energy she has.

So,

(1/2)mv² = μk mg * 70.

Divide both sides by m: (1/2)v² = μk g * 70.

Multiply by 2: v² = 140 μk g.

Wait, that's correct. So v² = 1372 μk.

So our earlier setup is correct. So the calculation for μk is approximately 0.1765, which rounds to about 0.18. So the answer should be option J: 0.18.

Wait, but I thought the options include 0.20. Let me see if I could have made a mistake in the initial equation.

Ah! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the first equation. Let me re-express the first part correctly.

The first equation: mgh = (1/2 mv²) + (μk mg cosθ s).

We can divide both sides by m to get:

gh = (1/2) v² + μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the correct signs in the initial setup.

Wait, so in the equation, the frictional work is (μk mg cosθ) * s. Since friction acts opposite to displacement, the work done is negative. So the energy equation should be:

Potential energy = Kinetic energy + Work done by non-conservative forces.

But in this case, the work done by friction is negative, so:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + ( - μk mg cosθ s ).

So,

mgh = (1/2 mv²) - μk mg cosθ s.

Dividing by m:

gh = (1/2) v² - μk g cosθ s.

Rearranging,

(1/2) v² = gh + μk g cosθ s.

Wait, that's a different equation. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Ah, yes. I think I forgot that the frictional work is negative. So the correct equation is:

(1/2) mv² = mgh - μk mg cosθ s.

So, the energy is converted into potential energy and work done by friction. So,

(1/2) mv² = mgh - μk mg cosθ s.

Divide both sides by m:

(1/2) v² = gh - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply by 2:

v² = 2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So, that's different from what I had before. Previously, I had 2gh = (1/2) v² + μk g cosθ s. But that is incorrect. Instead, the correct equation is (1/2) v² = gh - μk g cosθ s.

Let me redo the first part correctly.

Potential energy (mgh) is converted into kinetic energy (1/2 mv²) and the work done by friction (-μk mg cosθ s).

So,

mgh = (1/2 mv²) - μk mg cosθ s.

Divide both sides by m:

gh = (1/2)v² - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2gh = v² - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2gh + 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, that's different from earlier. So, let me recalculate.

Wait, let me recompute the first equation with the correct setup.

So,

mgh = (1/2) mv² - μk mg cosθ s.

Divide by m:

gh = (1/2) v² - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply by 2:

2 gh = v² - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2 gh + 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, from:

gh = (1/2) v² - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2gh = v² - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2gh + 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply that the term 2μk g cosθ s is positive, which it's not. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me re-express the setup correctly.

The correct energy equation is:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + (- μk mg cosθ s).

Divide by m:

gh = (1/2 v²) - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2gh = v² - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2gh + 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the right-hand side would have a term with 2 μk g cosθ s added to 2gh, which would imply that v² is larger than 2gh, which isn't possible because the skier is losing kinetic energy, so v squared should be less than 2gh.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct initial equation is:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + ( μk mg cosθ s )

Because the work done by friction is positive when moving against the motion (so friction does positive work if the skier is moving).

Wait, no: work done by friction is W = force × displacement × cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and displacement. If the skier is moving, and friction is acting opposite to the motion, then the work done by friction is negative.

So, the correct equation is:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + ( - μk mg cosθ s )

So,

mgh = (1/2 mv²) - μk mg cosθ s.

Divide by m:

gh = (1/2 v²) - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply by 2:

2gh = v² - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2gh + 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, that's different from earlier, and this implies that v squared is 2gh plus a positive term, which can't be correct because the kinetic energy is being lost. So this approach can't be correct, either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the friction. Alternatively, perhaps the correct energy equation is:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + ( μk mg cosθ s )

But that would imply that the work done by friction is positive, which is incorrect because friction does negative work.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + ( - μk mg cosθ s )

Which gives:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) - μk mg cosθ s.

Then, dividing by m:

gh = (1/2 v²) - μk g cosθ s.

Multiply by 2:

2gh = v² - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2gh + 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, but that would make v squared larger than 2gh, which can't be correct because the skier is losing kinetic energy.

So I must have made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct setup is that the work done by friction is negative, so the energy equation is:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + ( - μk mg cosθ s )

Which, when rearranged, gives:

v² = 2gh + 2 μk g cosθ s.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the left side is mgh, and the right side would be something else.

Hmm, perhaps the correct equation is:

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + ( μk mg cosθ s )

Which would not account for the negative work correctly. Let me try that.

So,

mgh = (1/2 mv²) + μk mg cosθ s.

Divide both sides by m:

gh = (1/2 v²) + μk g cosθ s.

Multiply by 2:

2gh = v² + 2 μk g cosθ s.

So,

v² = 2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s.

Ah, that makes sense because 2gh is the potential energy, and 2 μk g cosθ s is the work done by friction.

So, the correct equation is:

v² = 2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s.

So now, the first equation is v² = 2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s.

The second equation is v² = 140 μk g.

So setting them equal:

2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s = 140 μk g.

Let's plug in the numbers again.

Compute 2gh: 2 * 9.8 * 29.24 ≈ 2 * 9.8 * 29.24 ≈ 2 * 286.592 ≈ 573.184.

Compute 2 μk g cosθ s: 2 * μk * 9.8 * 0.9563 * 100.

Compute 9.8 * 0.9563 ≈ 9.3717.

Multiply by 2: 18.7434.

Multiply by 100: 1874.34.

So,

573.184 - 1874.34 * μk = 140 * μk * 9.8.

Wait, no, I think I messed up.

Wait, the second equation is v² = 140 μk g.

So,

2gh - 2 μk g cosθ s = 140 μk g.

Let me plug in the numbers again.

2gh = 573.184.

2 μk g cosθ s = 2 * μk * 9.8 * 0.9563 * 100 ≈ 2 * μk * 9.3717 * 100 ≈ 2 * μk * 937.17 ≈ 1874.34 μk.

So,

573.184 - 1874.34 μk = 140 * μk * 9.8.

Wait, 140 * μk * 9.8 is 1372 * μk.

So,

573.184 - 1874.34 μk = 1372 μk.

Bring all terms to left:

573.184 = 1372 μk + 1874.34 μk.

Wait, that can't be right because 1372 + 1874.34 is 3246.34.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the left side is 573.184, and the right side is 3246.34 μk.

So,

3246.34 μk = 573.184.

So,

μk = 573.184 / 3246.34 ≈ 0.1765.

So about 0.1765, which is approximately 0.18, option J.

So the correct answer is option J: 0.18.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion in two parts: downhill and level snow.

### Downhill Part
- **Height**: \( h = 100 \, \sin(17^\circ) \approx 29.24 \, \text{m} \)
- **Gravitational Potential Energy**: \( PE = mgh \)
- **Work Done by Friction**: \( W_f = \mu_k mg \cos(17^\circ) \times 100 \)
- **Energy Conservation**: 
  \[
  mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + W_f
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  gh = \frac{1}{2}v^2 + \mu_k g \cos(17^\circ) \times 100
  \]
  Multiply by 2:
  \[
  2gh = v^2 + 2\mu_k g \cos(17^\circ) \times 100
  \]
  Rearranging:
  \[
  v^2 = 2gh - 2\mu_k g \cos(17^\circ) \times 100
  \]

### Level Snow Part
- The skier coasts on level snow with no additional energy input.
- **Kinetic Energy**: \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)
- **Work Done by Friction**: \( W_f = \mu_k mg \times 70 \)
- **Energy Conservation**:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \mu_k mg \times 70
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2}v^2 = \mu_k g \times 70
  \]
  Multiply by 2:
  \[
  v^2 = 140 \mu_k g
  \]

### Equating the Two Expressions for \( v^2 \)
From the downhill part:
\[
v^2 = 2gh - 2\mu_k g \cos(17^\circ) \times 100
\]
From the level snow part:
\[
v^2 = 140 \mu_k g
\]
Set them equal:
\[
2gh - 2\mu_k g \cos(17^\circ) \times 100 = 140 \mu_k g
\]
Rearranging:
\[
2gh = 140 \mu_k g + 2\mu_k g \cos(17^\circ) \times 100
\]
Divide by \( g \):
\[
2h = 140 \mu_k + 2\mu_k \cos(17^\circ) \times 100
\]
Substitute \( h = 29.24 \):
\[
2 \times 29.24 = 140 \mu_k + 2\mu_k \cos(17^\circ) \times 100
\]
Simplify:
\[
58.48 = 140 \mu_k + 2\mu_k (0.9563) \times 100
\]
\[
58.48 = 140 \mu_k + 191.26 \mu_k
\]
\[
58.48 = 331.26 \mu_k
\]
Solve for \( \mu_k \):
\[
\mu_k = \frac{58.48}{331.26} \approx 0.1765
\]

### Final Answer
The coefficient of friction is approximately **0.18**. The correct option is:

**ANSWER: J**
