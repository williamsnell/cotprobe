Alright, so I've got this problem here about an inductor and a capacitor. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, part (a) is about finding the value of an inductor that carries 2 A of current and stores 20 J of energy. Part (b) is about finding the value of a capacitor that has 500 V across it and stores 20 J of energy. The options are A to J, each with a different inductance and capacitance. 

Starting with part (a) for the inductor. I remember that the energy stored in an inductor is given by the formula E = 0.5 * L * I². Oh wait, that's right. So E is the energy, L is inductance, I is current. I can rearrange this to solve for L. Let me write that down.

E = 0.5 * L * I²  
So L = (2E) / (I²). 

Given that E is 20 J and I is 2 A, plugging in the numbers: 

L = (2 * 20) / (2²) = (40) /4 = 10 H. 

Wait, so the inductance is 10 henries. So looking at the options, which inductance is 10 H? Let me check the options. 

Looking at the options, H is 15 H, I is 8 H, etc. No, wait. Wait, option B is 30 H, option I is 8 H. Hmm, option G is 6 H. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait no, no, wait. Let me calculate again. E is 20 J, I is 2 A. 

E = 0.5 * L * I²  
20 = 0.5 * L * (2)^2  
20 = 0.5 * L *4  
20 = 2 L  
L = 10 H. 

So yes, 10 H. Looking at the options, option G is 6 H, option I is 8 H. Oh, wait, no, let me double-check the options: 

Looking at the options, option G is 6 H, option I is 8 H. Oh wait, I'm missing something. No, wait, no:

Wait the options are:

Looking back, the options are A to J. Let me list them again:

A:4H,140µF  
B:30H,250µF  
C:10H,160µF  
D:5H,80µF  
E:20H,320µF  
F:12H,100µF  
G:6H,120µF  
H:25H,400µF  
I:8H,200µF  
J:15H,240µF  

Ah, I see. So option G has 6 H, which is the correct inductance for the first part. But wait, in part (a), the inductor is 10 H, but option G is 6 H. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, no. Oh wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong. Let me recheck. 

E=20 J, I=2 A. 

E = 0.5 * L * I²  
20 = 0.5 * L * (2)^2  
20 = 0.5 * L *4  
20 = 2 L  
L=10 H. 

Yes, correct. So why isn't there an option with 10 H? Oh wait, looking again, I see option C is 10 H, but what's its capacitance? Let's check part (b) as well, but maybe I should handle that after part (a).

Wait no, the question is part (a) and part (b) are separate. So for part (a), the correct L should be 10 H. Looking back, option C is 10 H, but the capacitance isn't given. Wait, but the options for part (a) and (b) are separate. So the first part (a) is about inductor, part (b) about capacitor. So the options are all combinations of inductance and capacitance. So in the options, each option has both. So for option C, the inductance is 10 H, but what about the capacitance? The question says, for part (a), an inductor carrying 2A and storing 20 J of energy. So the correct answer for part (a) is 10 H. So looking at the options for part (a), the inductance is 10 H, but the other value (capacitance) isn't given. So the options are about both inductor and capacitor values. Wait, but the question is a two-part question, so the correct answer is both parts joined together.

Wait no, the question is presented as two separate parts, (a) and (b), each with their own formulas. The way the question is worded: "the value of an inductor which carries 2 A of current and in which 20 J of energy is stored. (b) Find the value of a capacitor with 500 volts across it, in which 20 J of energy is stored."

So each part is answered separately, and the options are for each part. But the options are a mix of inductance and capacitance values. So each option has an inductor value and a capacitor value, and the correct option is the one where both parts are satisfied. So I can't pick an option where just the inductor is 10 H and the capacitor is, say, 140 µF. Because the question asks for each part's correct value from their respective options.

Wait, but the options are given as pairs, each with inductance and capacitance. So for each option, I need to find out if the inductor's value (from part (a)) and the capacitor's value (from part (b)) are correct. 

But wait, the question is a two-part question, so the correct option is the one where the inductor's value is 10 H and the capacitor's value is 140 µF? Wait, no, because the options are combinations.

Wait, actually, the question is one problem with two parts, each of which is a separate question. But the options are a list of possible answers for each part. So the correct option must satisfy both parts. So maybe I should look for an option where the inductor is 10 H and the capacitor is 140 µF. Let's look.

Option C: 10 H, 160 µF. So for part (a), yes, it's 10 H. For part (b), let's see.

Part (b): Capacitor with 500 V across it, 20 J stored.

The energy stored in a capacitor is E = 0.5 * C * V². So rearranged, C = (2E) / (V²). 

E is 20 J, V is 500 V.

So C = (2 * 20) / (500)^2 = 40 / 250000 = 0.00016 F. Because 40 divided by 250000 is 0.00016. Oh wait, 0.00016 F is 160 µF. Oh! So 160 µF.

Looking for an option where the inductance is 10 H and the capacitance is 160 µF. Looking at the options, option C has 10 H and 160 µF. So that's correct. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but wait: the options are A to J, each a pair. So in the options, which one is 10 H and 160 µF? Option C. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait: the question is a two-part question. So each part (a) and (b) would need their own correct values, and the options are for each part. But the answer given is the combination of both parts. So the correct answer is option C, which has inductance 10 H and capacitance 160 µF. So that's the correct answer, option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part separately and then combine the results.

### Part (a): Inductor
The energy stored in an inductor is given by the formula:
\[
E = 0.5 \cdot L \cdot I^2
\]
Rearranging to solve for \(L\):
\[
L = \frac{2E}{I^2}
\]
Given \(E = 20 \, \text{J}\) and \(I = 2 \, \text{A}\):
\[
L = \frac{2 \cdot 20}{2^2} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \, \text{H}
\]
Thus, the inductance for part (a) is \(10 \, \text{H}\).

### Part (b): Capacitor
The energy stored in a capacitor is given by the formula:
\[
E = 0.5 \cdot C \cdot V^2
\]
Rearranging to solve for \(C\):
\[
C = \frac{2E}{V^2}
\]
Given \(E = 20 \, \text{J}\) and \(V = 500 \, \text{V}\):
\[
C = \frac{2 \cdot 20}{500^2} = \frac{40}{250000} = 0.00016 \, \text{F} = 160 \, \mu\text{F}
\]
Thus, the capacitance for part (b) is \(160 \, \mu\text{F}\).

### Combining Results
We need an option where the inductance is \(10 \, \text{H}\) and the capacitance is \(160 \, \mu\text{F}\). Examining the options:

- **Option C**: \(10 \, \text{H}, 160 \, \mu\text{F}\).

This matches both parts of the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: C**
