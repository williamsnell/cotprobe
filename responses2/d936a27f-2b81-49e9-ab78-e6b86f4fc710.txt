Okay, so I've got this question about natural boron and its atomic weight on the 16 scale. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that natural boron is a mix of two isotopes: ^10B and ^11B. The question says it's 20% ^10B and 80% ^11B. Wait, so the natural abundance of each isotope is 0.2 and 0.8 respectively.

The question is asking about the atomic weight on the scale of boron-16, which is the chemical scale they often refer to. I think this scale is where heavier isotopes are assigned higher atomic weights. I recall that the atomic weight on the 16 scale is calculated by considering the relative abundance of each isotope and their respective masses.

So, the ^10B has an atomic weight of about 10.013 amu. ^11B is a bit heavier, around 11.009 amu. But wait, for the 16 scale, the masses are adjusted. Oh right, the isotopic masses are scaled such that ^16O is assigned a value of 16.000, and other isotopes are calculated based on this.

So, the formula for the atomic weight (A) on the 16 scale is the sum of (abundance * mass of isotope). Oh wait, but wait. The isotopic masses are scaled so that ^16O is 16. So the actual masses (relative to ^16O) are used. But I think the exact method is that each isotope's contribution is (abundance) multiplied by (mass of isotope) divided by (^16O's mass), which is 16.000. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, the 16 scale is a relative scale where each atom's mass is expressed as a fraction of ^16O. So, for each isotope, its atomic weight on the scale is abundance multiplied by the mass number of that isotope (since ^16O has mass 16, and atoms of other isotopes would be based on their mass numbers). Or perhaps, I'm mixing it up.

Alternatively, I can think of the 16 scale as being similar to the regular scale, but with ^16O defined as 16. So for ^10B and ^11B, their atomic weights on the scale would be proportional to their mass numbers. Wait, but that can't be right because ^11B is a heavier isotope, so its atomic weight would be higher than ^10B.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is: atomic weight on the 16 scale = (abundance of isotope) * (mass number of isotope) / (mass number of ^16O). Since ^16O is 16. So for each isotope, it's (abundance) * (mass number) / 16.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Another approach: the 16 scale is a relative scale where the atomic weight of ^16O is 16. So each isotope's contribution is its abundance times the mass number of that isotope divided by the mass number of ^16O. But wait, no, because the scale is based on the atomic weight relative to ^16O. So the atomic weight of ^10B on the scale would be (abundance) * mass number of ^10B / 16.

Wait, but I think the correct formula is to take the relative abundance and multiply by the mass number of each isotope. Because ^16O is 16, so ^10B would be (0.20) * 10 = 2.0 and ^11B would be (0.80)*11 = 8.8. Then adding them together, 2.0 + 8.8 = 10.8. So the total is 10.8, which would be the atomic weight on the scale. Looking at the options, option E is 10.2, D is 9.5, etc. Wait, but that calculation gives 10.8, which is option J. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is more precise. Let me think about the exact masses. ^10B has a mass of approximately 10.01294 amu, and ^11B is about 11.00672 amu. But when calculating the 16 scale, I think the correct way is to compute the relative contribution of each isotope based on their mass.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. On the 16 scale, each isotope's atomic weight is given by (abundance) * (mass number) / (mass number of ^16O). So ^10B would be 0.2 * 10 / 16 = 0.125. ^11B is 0.8 * 11 /16 = 0.55. Adding them together: 0.125 + 0.55 = 0.675. But wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 10s, not 0.6s. So maybe I'm using the wrong method.

Wait, perhaps the method is that the 16 scale is a relative scale where each isotope's contribution is their abundance multiplied by their atomic mass. But that doesn't make sense because if you have ^16O as 16, ^17O as 17, etc., but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relative atomic weights on the 16 scale, which is scaled such that ^16O is 16. So, the relative atomic weight of ^10B would be (abundance) × (mass number) × (some scaling factor). Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let me think in terms of the formula for the atomic weight on the 16 scale. The formula is: atomic weight (16 scale) = (abundance of ^10B) × 10 + (abundance of ^11B) × 11. But wait, that would be 0.2*10 + 0.8*11 = 2 + 8.8 = 10.8, which is option J. But that doesn't take into account the mass of the isotopes relative to ^16O. 

Wait, maybe the correct way is to consider the mass of each isotope relative to ^16O. So, since ^16O is 16, the mass of ^10B is 10, so the fraction is (10/16) * (20%) + (11/16)*(80%). Let me compute that.

(10/16)*0.2 + (11/16)*0.8.

10/16 *0.2 is 0.2*(0.625)=0.125.

11/16 *0.8 is 0.8*(0.6875)=0.55.

Adding them: 0.125 + 0.55 = 0.675.

Wait, that's 0.675. But the atomic weight can't be that low on the scale. That must be incorrect because boron's atomic weight on the 16 scale should be around 10-11.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the average using the actual masses and the abundance. So, the average mass (in amu) would be (0.2 * 10.013) + (0.8 * 11.009). Let me calculate that.

0.2 *10.013 = 2.0026.

0.8 *11.009 = 8.8072.

Total: 2.0026 +8.8072 = 10.8098 amu.

Then, to convert that into the 16 scale, since ^16O is 16, and its mass is 16. So, the relative contribution is (10.8098 / 16) * 16. But that's just 10.8098, which is approximately 10.81. Looking at the options, option J is 10.8, which would be the closest. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 10.8, but the reasoning using mass numbers gave the same result. Hmm, but let's check.

Another approach: the atomic weight on the scale of 16 is calculated as:

( ( abundance of ^10B × 10 ) + ( abundance of ^11B × 11 ) ) / (average mass of all isotopes?)

No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. The average atomic mass is (0.2 *10.013) + (0.8 *11.009) = 10.8098. So, in the 16 scale, since ^16O is 16, the average would be 10.81, which is approximately 10.8. So the answer is option J.

To determine the approximate atomic weight of natural boron on the scale of 16 units, we analyze the given isotopes and their contributions. Natural boron consists of 20% \( ^{10}\text{B} \) and 80% \( ^{11}\text{B} \). The atomic weights of these isotopes are approximately 10.013 amu and 11.009 amu, respectively.

The atomic weight on the 16 scale is calculated by considering the relative abundance of each isotope and their respective masses. The formula for the atomic weight on the 16 scale is:

\[
\text{Atomic weight (16 scale)} = \left( \text{abundance of } ^{10}\text{B} \times \text{mass of } ^{10}\text{B} \right) + \left( \text{abundance of } ^{11}\text{B} \times \text{mass of } ^{11}\text{B} \right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Atomic weight (16 scale)} = (0.2 \times 10.013) + (0.8 \times 11.009)
\]

\[
= 2.0026 + 8.8072 = 10.8098 \, \text{amu}
\]

Since the scale is normalized such that \( ^{16}\text{O} \) corresponds to 16 units, the atomic weight of natural boron on the 16 scale is approximately 10.81. Among the given options, the closest value is 10.8.
