Okay, so I have this probability question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Y follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and 0.25, so Y ~ b(n, 0.25). I need to find a lower bound for the probability that |Y/n - 0.25| is less than 0.05. And this is when n is 100. The options are given from A to J, with various probabilities.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with binomial distributions, especially for large n, we can approximate it with a normal distribution. That's because the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the distribution of the sample proportion approaches a normal distribution as n increases. So for n=100, which is fairly large, this approximation should be applicable.

Let me think about the mean and variance of Y. Since Y is binomial(n, p=0.25), the mean μ is n*p, which is 100 * 0.25 = 25. The variance σ² is n*p*(1-p) = 100 * 0.25 * 0.75 = 100 * 0.1875 = 18.75. So the standard deviation σ is sqrt(18.75) which is approximately 4.3301.

Now, we're looking at Y/n. Since Y is binomial, Y/n is the sample proportion. The expected value of Y/n is p, which is 0.25. The variance of Y/n would be σ²/n = 18.75/100 = 0.1875. So the standard deviation of Y/n is sqrt(0.1875) ≈ 0.4330.

So we're looking to find P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05). That's the same as P(-0.05 < Y/n - 0.25 < 0.05). In terms of standard normal variables, since Y/n is approximately normal, I can standardize it.

Let me set Z = (Y/n - 0.25)/0.4330. So the probability becomes P(-0.05/0.4330 < Z < 0.05/0.4330). Let me calculate those values.

0.05 divided by 0.4330 is approximately 0.1155. So the probability is P(-0.1155 < Z < 0.1155). Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, this is equal to 2 * P(0 < Z < 0.1155).

Looking up the Z-score of 0.1155 in the standard normal table, the cumulative probability up to 0.1155 is about 0.546. So P(0 < Z < 0.1155) is 0.546 - 0.5 = 0.046. Then multiplying by 2 gives approximately 0.092, which is about 9.2%.

But wait, the question asks for a lower bound. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because the normal approximation gives us an approximate probability, but the question is about a lower bound. So perhaps I should think about the Chebyshev inequality or something else.

Alternatively, maybe using the normal approximation is the way to go, and the question is just expecting the approximate probability. But wait, looking at the options, the closest one to 0.092 is 0.05, which is option J. But that seems low. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the exact binomial probability.

Wait, but for n=100, the exact calculation might be tedious, but perhaps using the normal approximation is acceptable here, and the lower bound would be the approximate value I calculated.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the question is about a lower bound, not necessarily the exact probability. So perhaps using the normal approximation's value as the lower bound. So the approximate probability is about 0.092, which is around 0.09.

Looking at the options, there is no 0.09. The closest is J: 0.05, but that's lower. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach.

Wait, another approach: using the normal approximation, the probability is about 0.092, so the lower bound could be this value. But none of the options are 0.09. The options are A:0.75, B:0.85, etc., down to J:0.05.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

n=100, p=0.25. So Y ~ binomial(100, 0.25). So Y/n is the sample proportion, which is approximately normal with mean 0.25 and standard deviation sqrt(0.25*0.75/100) = sqrt(0.1875/100) = sqrt(0.001875) ≈ 0.0433.

So the standard error (SE) is approximately 0.0433. So the probability that |Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05 is the probability that |Z| < 0.05/0.0433 ≈ 1.155. So the Z-score is about 1.155.

Looking at the standard normal distribution, P(Z < 1.155) is about 0.875, and P(Z < -1.155) is about 0.125. So the probability that Z is between -1.155 and 1.155 is 0.875 - 0.125 = 0.75, wait no, because 0.875 is the area up to 1.155, so the area between -1.155 and 1.155 is 2*(0.875 - 0.5) = 2*0.375 = 0.75. Wait, that can't be right because 1.155 is about 1.16.

Wait, let me get more precise. The Z-score of 1.155: I can use the standard normal distribution table.

Z=1.15 is 0.8749, Z=1.16 is 0.8770. Since 1.155 is between 1.15 and 1.16, let's approximate. The difference between 1.15 and 1.16 is 0.01 in Z, and the corresponding probabilities are 0.8749 to 0.8770, a difference of 0.0021. So 1.155 is 0.005 above 1.15, so the probability is 0.8749 + (0.005/0.01)*0.0021 ≈ 0.8749 + 0.5*0.0021 = 0.8749 + 0.00105 ≈ 0.87595. So about 0.876.

Therefore, the area from -1.155 to 1.155 is 2*(0.876 - 0.5) = 2*0.376 = 0.752. Wait, that can't be, because when Z is 1.155, the cumulative up to 1.155 is approximately 0.87595, so the area up to 1.155 is 0.876, and the area below -1.155 is 0.124 (since 1 - 0.876 = 0.124). So the area between -1.155 and 1.155 is 0.876 - 0.124 = 0.752. So approximately 0.75.

Wait, wait a moment. But 0.75 is not one of the options. The options are A:0.75, B:0.85, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the Chebyshev inequality.

Wait, Chebyshev's inequality states that P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². Let's see.

In this case, the variance of Y/n is σ²/n = 0.1875/100 = 0.001875. So the standard deviation is sqrt(0.001875) ≈ 0.0433.

We want P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) which is P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05). So this is the same as P(|Y/n - μ| < 0.05).

We can express 0.05 as k*σ. Let's compute k = 0.05 / 0.0433 ≈ 1.155. So Chebyshev's inequality gives P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k² → P(|X - μ| < kσ) ≥ 1 - 1/k².

So 1 - 1/(1.155)^2 ≈ 1 - 1/1.333 ≈ 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. So the probability is at least 0.25. But that's the lower bound? Wait, no: Chebyshev's gives a lower bound on the probability of being within kσ. So 1 - 1/k² is the lower bound for P(|X - μ| < kσ). So in this case, it's 1 - (1/(1.155)^2) ≈ 1 - 0.75 ≈ 0.25. So the probability is at least 25%, which is 0.25. But 0.25 isn't one of the options either. The options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe using the sample proportion's variance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the normal approximation and then approximate the probability, which I calculated as approximately 0.75 (option A). But wait, wait, that 0.75 is the probability that |Z| < 1.155, which is the area between -1.155 and 1.155. But when I calculated earlier, that area was approximately 0.752, which is close to 0.75. So the probability would be approximately 0.75.

But wait, the options include 0.75 as option A. So that's one of the choices. But earlier, I thought the probability was about 0.75, but I remember that when using the normal approximation, the probability that Y/n is within 0.05 of 0.25 is approximately 0.75, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as using the Central Limit Theorem with continuity correction. But I'm not sure if that would change the result significantly here.

Wait, let me think again. The exact probability would require using the binomial distribution. But for n=100, that's a lot of terms to compute, but perhaps the normal approximation is sufficient for the problem.

So the normal approximation gives us a probability around 0.75, which is option A. But the initial calculation I did for the Z score gave approximately 0.75. But looking back, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier because when I used the normal approximation, I found that the probability is about 0.75, but that's not matching with the Chebyshev approach.

Wait, no, I think I confused the approach. Let me make sure.

Wait, the Chebyshev approach says that P(|X - μ| < kσ) ≥ 1 - 1/k². So for k = 1.155, 1/k² is approximately 0.75, so 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. That's the lower bound on the probability of being within kσ, so the probability is at least 25%, which is 0.25. But 0.25 isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it correctly. Let me re-calculate the Z-score.

0.05 / (sqrt(0.25*0.75/100)) = 0.05 / (sqrt(0.1875/100)) = 0.05 / (sqrt(0.001875)).

sqrt(0.001875) is approximately 0.0433. So 0.05 / 0.0433 ≈ 1.155.

So the Z-score is approximately 1.155. The area from -1.155 to 1.155 is about 0.752, as I calculated earlier, which is approximately 0.75. So the probability is approximately 0.75, which is option A.

But the question says to give a lower bound. So perhaps the normal approximation gives us an upper bound, and the question is expecting the lower bound.

Wait, no. The normal approximation gives the probability, which is the exact value under normality. But the question is about a lower bound, which is a value that the probability is greater than or equal to. So perhaps the normal approximation gives us a value that is the lower bound.

Wait, but the normal approximation is an approximation, and perhaps the actual probability could be lower than the approximation. But in this case, the calculation using the normal approximation gives us 0.75, which is the same as option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the Central Limit Theorem and the normal approximation, and the correct answer is option A: 0.75.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because the options include 0.55, which is option J. Let me think again.

Another approach is to compute the exact binomial probability. Let's calculate P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) when n=100.

That's P(0.25 - 0.05 < Y/n < 0.25 + 0.05) → P(0.20 < Y/n < 0.30). So Y/n is the sample proportion, which is 0.20 < p_hat < 0.30.

But Y is binomial(100, 0.25). So P(20 ≤ Y ≤ 30) because 0.20*100=20 and 0.30*100=30.

Calculating this exact probability might take some time, but perhaps we can estimate it.

Alternatively, maybe using the normal approximation is the way to go. So the Z-scores for Y=20 and Y=30 would give the boundaries.

Wait, but it's easier perhaps to model Y/n as a normal variable with mean 0.25 and standard deviation sqrt(0.25*0.75/100) = sqrt(0.001875) ≈ 0.0433.

So the Z-scores for Y=20 and Y=30 are (20-25)/0.0433 ≈ (-5)/0.0433 ≈ -115.5 and (30-25)/0.0433 ≈ 5/0.0433 ≈ 115.5. These are very large Z-scores, meaning the probabilities are almost 0.5 each, but that's not correct because the binomial distribution is discrete.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the mean is at 25, so Y=20 is -5, and Y=30 is +5. So the probability would be the integral from Y=20 to Y=30 under the normal curve.

But since the normal distribution is continuous, the exact probability would be slightly less than the integral from 19.5 to 30.5, which is a better approximation.

Wait, but for a normal approximation, the continuity correction would mean:

P(19.5 ≤ Y/n ≤ 30.5) → but Y/n is the scaled Y.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Z-scores for 19.5 and 30.5.

Z1 = (19.5 - 25)/0.0433 ≈ (-5.5)/0.0433 ≈ -126.6

Z2 = (30.5 - 25)/0.0433 ≈ 5.5/0.0433 ≈ 126.6

So the area between -126.6 and 126.6 is essentially 1.0 because the normal distribution is almost certain to cover that range.

But that can't be right because the actual probability in the binomial is much lower than 1.0.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, when using the normal approximation to a binomial distribution, the continuity correction adjusts the boundaries by 0.5. So for the lower limit, we use Y=19.5, and for the upper limit, Y=30.5.

So in terms of Y/n, the boundaries are 19.5/100 = 0.195 and 30.5/100 = 0.305.

So the Z-scores are (0.195 - 0.25)/0.0433 ≈ (-0.055)/0.0433 ≈ -1.26.

Similarly, (0.305 - 0.25)/0.0433 ≈ 0.055/0.0433 ≈ 1.26.

Looking at the standard normal distribution, the area between -1.26 and 1.26 is approximately 0.80. So the probability that Y/n is between 0.195 and 0.305 is approximately 0.80. So the exact probability is around 0.80.

But the options don't include 0.80. The closest is option B:0.85. So perhaps the question is expecting the normal approximation's probability as the lower bound, which is about 0.80, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is expecting the lower bound using the normal approximation as an upper bound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the central limit theorem and approximate the probability, which would be P(μ - 0.05 < X < μ + 0.05) → which is P(0.25 - 0.05 < X < 0.25 + 0.05) → P(0.20 < X < 0.30). So using the normal approximation, the probability that X is between 20 and 30 is the same as the probability that Y/n is between 0.20 and 0.30.

So the exact probability would be the sum of the binomial probabilities from Y=20 to Y=30. But calculating that exactly is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps using the normal approximation gives us a probability of approximately 0.80, which is not an option, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the normal approximation's result as the answer, which is 0.75, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the exact probability is about 0.80, which is not an option. So perhaps the question is expecting the normal approximation's value as the answer, which is approximately 0.75, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.55, option J. Because 0.55 is half of 1.1, which is close to 1.155.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a table.

n=100, p=0.25.

Calculate the exact probability using binomial distribution.

The exact probability is the sum from Y=20 to Y=30 of C(100, Y) * (0.25)^Y * (0.75)^(100-Y).

But calculating this exactly would take a lot of time, but perhaps I can estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps using the normal approximation, the probability is approximately 0.75, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the normal approximation's result as the lower bound, which is 0.75, option A.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The options are:

A:0.75

B:0.85

C:0.90

D:0.95

E:0.99

Wait, but none of these are close to the 0.80 I estimated earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the binomial formula to compute the probability.

But perhaps it's easier to use the normal approximation in this case, and accept that the probability is approximately 0.75, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be 0.55, which is J. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:0.75

B:0.85

C:0.90

D:0.95

E:0.99

Wait, but the correct exact probability is about 0.80, which is not an option. So perhaps the question is expecting a different approach, such as using the Chebyshev inequality, which gives a lower bound of 0.25, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the normal approximation, which gives 0.75, option A.

But wait, let me think about the Z-score again. The Z-score of 1.155 gives the area between -1.155 and 1.155 as approximately 0.75. So the probability is approximately 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is option A:0.75.

Wait, but looking back, I thought the exact probability might be around 0.80, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the normal approximation and the area within 1.155, which is approximately 0.75, so the answer is A.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the exact probability might be higher, but perhaps the options don't include it, so the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the options are higher than the normal approximation, but perhaps I should choose the lower bound given by the normal approximation, which is 0.75.

So I'll go with option A:0.75.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the normal approximation gives us approximately 0.75, which is option A, but the options include 0.55 as option J. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: using the normal approximation, the Z-score is 1.155, so the area is approximately 0.75, which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is A:0.75.
</think>

To determine the lower bound for the probability that |Y/n - p| < 0.05, where Y/n is the sample proportion, we use the normal approximation. The sample proportion Y/n has a mean μ = 0.25 and a standard deviation σ = sqrt(0.25*0.75/100) ≈ 0.0433. The Z-score for the boundary (0.25 ± 0.05) is calculated as:

Z = (0.05) / (0.0433) ≈ 1.155.

Using the standard normal distribution table for a Z-score of approximately 1.155, the area between -1.155 and 1.155 is approximately 0.75. Therefore, the lower bound for the probability is 0.75.

ANSWER: A
