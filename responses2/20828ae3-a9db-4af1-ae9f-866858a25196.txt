Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about cultural theories, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question is about the "melting pot" theory of combining several immigrant groups into one mainstream culture. It asks which theory this refers to, with options from A to H.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are several theories related to cultural mixing. Let me think about each option.

Option A is fusion theory. I think fusion theory suggests that different groups come together and merge into a single culture. That sounds similar to the melting pot idea.

Option B is amalgamation theory. I'm not as sure about this one. I think amalgamation might refer to combining parts rather than groups, or maybe it's a misnomer. But I'm not certain.

Option C is ethnic clustering. That's more about groups living near each other, not necessarily merging. Plus, I don't think the melting pot is about clustering but about blending.

Option D is cultural diffusion. That's about the spread of cultures through contact, like how some cultures spread when people migrate. But that's more about the process, not the outcome of combining groups.

Option E is diversity theory. I recall this theory focuses on the blending of cultures, not the main group. It's about how different groups share aspects of each other's cultures.

Option F is integration theory. Integration theory is about how groups integrate into the mainstream culture, which seems to match the question's description. The melting pot theory is about groups coming together into a common culture.

Option G is ethnic islands. That's the opposite of what's being described, as it's the separation of groups.

Option H is ethnocentrism theory. Ethnocentrism is the belief that one's own culture is superior, which is a different concept, not about cultural mixing.

Option I is acculturation. Acculturation is about how outsiders integrate into a culture, but it's a process rather than the theory explaining the process.

Option J isn't listed here.

So, putting it together: The melting pot theory is about different groups merging into a common culture, which is exactly what integration theory (option F) describes. Fusion theory (A) is a subset of integration theory, but the question is likely referring to the broader concept.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F: integration theory.

The correct answer is F: integration theory. The melting pot theory refers to the integration of different groups into mainstream culture, which is best described by integration theory.

Answer: F
