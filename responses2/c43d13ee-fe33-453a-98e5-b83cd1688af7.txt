Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Singer's theory and one of its objections. Hmm, I remember that Singer is associated with the concept of "suffering as a natural state of existence" and "the state of suffering as a mode of existence." So he argued that suffering is a fundamental aspect of life and that people should seek ways to alleviate it.

The question is asking what one of the objections is. The options are A to J. Let me try to think through each one.

Option A says it inappropriately makes proximity morally important. Wait, I think Singer talked about proximity as important in morality, but maybe this is more about the concept of proximity in terms of suffering. I'm not too sure if this is an objection. Or perhaps it's about the moral import of proximity being misapplied here.

Option B: Fails to consider cultural differences in moral norms. That sounds plausible. Singer's theory might focus on Western norms, and if people have different cultural contexts, maybe he didn't account for that. So this could be an objection.

Option C: Overlooks the role of government and institutions. Singer's work was on natural states of existence, not about institutions. But I'm not sure if this is the main objection to his theory.

Option D: Does not address suffering in other countries. That's more about the universality of the theory, not specifically an objection to his own theory.

Option E: Stricter obligations to loved ones. I'm not sure about this. Singer's theory was about the state of suffering, not about how to respond to it. So maybe this isn't an objection.

Option F: Moral obligations to non-human animals. That's a real concern. If the theory only applies to human suffering, it would exclude non-human, which is a problem.

Option G: Self-interest. Singer argues that people should take others as their own, which is a principle. If someone's self-interest is a factor, maybe this is more about his approach.

Option H: All individuals have same capacity. No, he believed in varying capacities. So this is probably not the correct answer.

Option I: No definition of suffering. That's a strong reason. If someone doesn't have a clear definition, how can they address suffering? So this would be an objection because the theory fails to define what suffering is.

Option J: Requires drastic revision. I'm not sure if he actually needed a drastic change. Maybe he just needed to rethink his approach, but that's more about the practicality of his theory, not an inherent objection.

So, going back, the options that are known objections. I think option F and option I are strong contenders. The question is about the last character, so the last letter of the answer. The options are A to J.

Wait, but the question says "one objection to Singer’s theory that he considers is that it:..." So the correct answer is one of these.

The question is, which is an objection. So, looking up my notes, I remember that Singer's theory might have a problem with cultural differences. Because he's talking about the state of suffering, which is a Western concept, and maybe people in different cultures have different moral norms. So option B could be an objection.

But another point: Singer's theory was about the state of suffering, not about how to respond. So if someone's objection was about the response (e.g., how to act), that's not an issue with his theory. Unless the question is about the theory's applicability.

Wait, the question is asking about an objection to his theory, which is about the state of suffering. So the options seem to be about what his theory doesn't do, or what it claims.

Option F: Moral obligations to non-human animals. Wait, that's a different issue. That's a concern that the theory doesn't address, because it's about human suffering, not animal suffering.

Wait, but the question is about what's an objection to his theory. The theory is about human suffering, so the objection would be about how he handles non-human issues. So perhaps the theory doesn't address non-human suffering at all, which would be an objection.

Wait, but looking again, the options:

Option F: does not address the issue of moral obligations to non-human animals.

That's a real concern. So if someone's theory is about human suffering, they don't address non-human, so that's an objection.

Alternatively, option I is about not having a clear definition of suffering. That's also a point. But I'm not sure which is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is phrased as "One objection to Singer’s theory that he considers is that it:...". So the answer is one of the four options that he's pointing out is an objection.

Wait, I think the answer is F. Because Singer's theory is about the state of suffering, not about how to deal with non-human suffering. So the theory doesn't address it, making that an objection.

Alternatively, option I is about not having a clear definition. That's a separate issue but could be an objection if the theory's main focus is on the state of suffering.

Wait, but the question is about which is an objection to his theory. So for example, if someone's objection is that the theory doesn't explain how to deal with non-human suffering, that's a valid objection. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: fails to consider cultural differences. That is, Singer's theory is Western, so if people in other cultures have different moral norms, he's not accounting for that.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about what each option represents.

Singer's theory is about the state of suffering, which is a natural state. So he would argue that everyone is in a state of suffering, and that's a basic part of life. If cultural differences exist where people have different ways of experiencing or responding to suffering, he may not have considered that. So option B would be an objection.

Alternatively, option I is about not having a clear definition of suffering. That's a fundamental problem in any theory. So that's a major issue.

Wait, but the question is looking for an objection to his theory, which focuses on the state of suffering. So the problem of cultural differences would be a problem with his approach, not the theory itself.

Wait, no: the theory itself doesn't consider cultural differences. It's about the state of suffering, not how to act on it. So an objection to the theory would be about its applicability or limitations.

So, thinking again, the question is about the theory's limitations. The main issue he faced is that suffering is a natural state, so the theory doesn't address how to deal with it. So perhaps the correct answer is option F.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm trying to remember what exactly was the main objection.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is option F. Because Singer's theory is about the state of suffering, and there are other moral obligations to non-human animals or non-human suffering, which the theory doesn't address. So the theory doesn't address the issue of dealing with non-human suffering, making F an objection.

Alternatively, the correct answer could be option I, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is about what is an objection to his theory. The theory is about the state of suffering. If the theory doesn't address non-human suffering, that's an objection. So F.

But wait, the question is phrased as "one objection to Singer's theory that he considers is that it:..." So the correct answer is about what he's considering as an objection, not necessarily the theory's own limitations.

Wait, that's a different point. The question is asking about an objection to his theory that he considers. So it's looking for an issue that he has in his approach.

I think option F is about the theory's focus on human suffering and ignoring other moral obligations. That's a problem because it's outside the scope of his theory.

Wait, but the question is about an objection to his theory. So the theory doesn't address how to handle non-human suffering, making that an objection. So option F is the answer.

Alternatively, option I is about not having a clear definition of suffering, which is a problem in any theory. So that's another possible answer.

Wait, the question is about what he considers as an objection. So if he's considering his theory, the main obstacle would be something he points out in his own work.

So for example, if he points out that the theory doesn't consider non-human suffering, that would be an objection.

Alternatively, he might say that the theory is about the state of suffering, which is a natural state, but people have different ways of dealing with it. So that's an objection.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But I think the answer is F. Because Singer's theory is focused on the state of suffering, and if other moral obligations exist, the theory doesn't address them, making option F an objection.

The question asks for an objection to Singer’s theory that he considers. Singer’s theory centers on the concept of suffering as a natural state of existence. The options provided explore various aspects of his theory, with the focus on what he considers as an objection.

- **Option A**: Inappropriately making proximity morally important is not the main issue with his theory.
- **Option B**: Failing to consider cultural differences in moral norms is more about how the theory applies to different cultures rather than an inherent objection to the theory itself.
- **Option C**: Overlooking the role of government and institutions is not directly relevant to his focus on natural states of suffering.
- **Option D**: Addressing suffering in other countries is about the universality of the theory, not a specific objection.
- **Option E**: Stricter obligations to loved ones is not a concern to him, as his theory emphasizes taking others as one’s own.
- **Option F**: The issue of moral obligations to non-human animals is a valid concern. The theory focuses on human suffering, ignoring how non-human beings should be treated, making this an explicit objection.
- **Option G**: Self-interest is not a central concern of his theory, as he emphasizes taking others as one’s own.
- **Option H**: Assuming uniform capacity to alleviate suffering is incorrect as he rejected variation in abilities.
- **Option I**: Lack of a clear definition of suffering is a fundamental problem with any theory, not specifically tied to his approach.
- **Option J**: Not providing a clear definition is a broader issue but not directly an objection to his specific theory.

The most fitting answer is **Option F**, as it highlights an explicit concern that Singer’s theory does not address, specifically the moral obligations towards non-human animals. This is a significant issue that his theory does not adequately handle.

ANSWER: F
