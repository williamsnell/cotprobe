Okay, so I have this accounting audit question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take my time.

The question is about interim audit procedures, specifically accounts receivable. The scenario is that during these procedures, there are numerous unexpected errors found, which change the risk assessment. The options are various auditing responses, and I need to pick the most appropriate one.

First, I should understand what happens when you find errors in interim audits. If you have errors in interim testing, you might need to adjust your risk assessment because the new errors could mean more or less risk. If the errors are material, the risk might increase, and you might need to revisit the testing or change the approach.

Looking at the options:

A: Send negative confirmations instead of positive. That could be a problem because if the errors are material, handling them as negatives might hide the issues, leading to a false impression of lower risk. So maybe not the best choice.

B: Use more experienced team members for year-end testing. Well, if the errors were discovered during interim, maybe more experienced people are better at handling the year-end testing. But I'm not sure if this is the best option. It depends on the situation.

C: Ignore the errors. If the errors are material, ignoring them would be incorrect. But if they're not material, perhaps it's a good idea. However, the question says "unexpected errors are found," which implies they are material. So probably not option C.

D: Use less experienced team members. Less experienced might make it harder to spot errors, or perhaps they won't handle the errors well. But again, if errors are material, perhaps this isn't the best approach.

E: Decrease the use of sampling. Wait, during interim, the sampling is usually done, but if errors are found, maybe they need to adjust the sample size or more thoroughly test. But if you decrease the sampling, that might reduce the materiality, which could be problematic. So maybe E is not the best choice.

F: Perform fewer procedures to save time. That could reduce the effort, but if the errors are important, reducing procedures might mean missing some necessary tests, increasing risk. So this might not be appropriate.

G: Move detailed analytical procedures to year-end. Hmm, but if errors are found during interim, maybe you should focus on the most critical tests. Alternatively, perhaps moving some to year-end could help catch errors there. But I'm not sure about this one.

H: Increase the dollar threshold. That's about vouching invoices. Higher thresholds mean less evidence is needed. If errors in positive confirmations are material, maybe setting a higher threshold would help catch them. But if errors are negative, maybe it's not the right approach. The question says errors are found, but it's not clear if they are positive or negative.

Wait, the question says "unexpected errors are found," which could be either positive or negative, but in the context of accounts receivable, I'm guessing they might be positive errors (like billing a customer for a service that wasn't actually provided). Or maybe negative errors could mean customers not being billed. But how does that affect the audit response?

If there are positive errors during interim testing, they might be a problem. So the team might need to handle them, perhaps by either correcting them or adjusting their approach. So in that case, option A would be bad, but option B would be better because if they use more experienced people, they can handle the errors better.

But wait, what if the errors are negative? Then perhaps using more experienced people isn't the best choice because they might not handle negative errors as effectively. Alternatively, the errors could be a mix. But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps the most appropriate response is to correct the errors, perhaps by changing how confirmations are sent.

Wait, another thought: when there are errors in interim testing, you might need to adjust the risk assessment. If the errors are material, they might require a higher risk, so you might need to perform more thorough testing. So maybe the team could be changed, but not necessarily ignored.

Looking at the options again, option G says to move analytical procedures to year-end. That might not be the best approach because you already have some errors. Alternatively, perhaps you need to adjust testing methods, but none of the options directly say that.

Wait, the question is which response would be most appropriate. If you have errors found during interim, you might need to address them. So perhaps option A is incorrect because sending negatives could hide the errors. Option B would allow experienced people to handle the errors, so that's better.

Alternatively, perhaps you need to focus on more critical tests. But the options don't directly say that. But looking at the options, option G is about moving detailed procedures to year-end. If errors are found, maybe moving them to year-end would help catch them there.

Wait, but if the errors were in interim, perhaps the focus is on testing for errors. So if errors are found and need to be corrected, perhaps the response would be to correct the confirmations, which is option A. But if the errors are in positive tests, more experienced people are better.

Alternatively, perhaps the response is about correcting the errors rather than changing the testing approach. So maybe option A is correct. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: in interim audits, if you find errors, you might need to adjust the risk. If the errors are material, you might need to increase the sample size or perform more thorough testing. So perhaps the response would be to use more experienced people, which is option B. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Wait, another thought: the options don't all cover this. Let me list the options again:

A: Negative confirmations
B: More experienced team members for year-end
C: Ignore errors (unlikely since they're material)
D: Less experienced for year-end
E: Fewer procedures
F: Fewer procedures (but not necessarily better)
G: Move analytical to year-end
H: Higher threshold (vouching)

If errors are found during interim, you might need to address them. So if you have positive errors, more experienced people can handle them better. So option B is better because it would involve more experienced people, which might catch the errors more effectively.

But if the errors are negative (e.g., billing a customer when they weren't supposed to), then perhaps using less experienced people wouldn't help, because they might not catch the negative errors as well.

Wait, but the initial question says "unexpected errors are found," which could be either. However, in the context of accounts receivable, I'm thinking errors might mean that the company is over-billing, which could be a positive outcome. Or perhaps the errors are negative, like overcharging customers.

But without knowing, perhaps the best response is to correct the errors. So, for example, if you have to correct errors, you can choose option A, but that might not be the best approach if errors are material.

Wait, but the question is about which response is most appropriate. The options may not directly address the specifics, but perhaps the best response would be to adjust the testing by using more experienced people, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct response is to ignore the errors (option C), but that's not correct because ignoring errors would lead to a false impression of lower risk.

Wait, another angle: if errors are found, you may need to adjust the risk assessment. So perhaps the response is to correct the errors, which is option A. But if the errors are positive, more experienced people are better.

Alternatively, perhaps the response is to focus on the most critical tests, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the best choice is option G: moving analytical to year-end. No, wait, that seems off. Because you already have some errors. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to correct the errors, but that's option A.

Wait, another thought: if you have errors, you might not want to overlook them. So perhaps the response is to correct the errors, which would be option A. But in some cases, that might be risky if the errors are material. So perhaps the better approach is to use more experienced people, which is option B.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what each option does.

Option G: Move detailed analytical to year-end. Hmm, but if you already have errors, maybe that's not necessary. But if the errors are found during interim, perhaps you need to adjust your testing approach.

Option H: Increase the threshold. So, higher threshold means less evidence needed. But if you have errors that need to be in evidence (like a negative confirm), then a higher threshold might make it easier to catch them. But if errors are positive, a higher threshold could make it harder because you need more evidence.

But the question is about the most appropriate response when errors are found. So, if errors are material, perhaps you need to address them. So, option B: using more experienced people would be better.

Wait, another approach: the question says "change of risk assessment." So maybe the team needs to be adjusted. Perhaps they should be more experienced, so option B.

Alternatively, perhaps if errors are found, you should address them, which would involve more detailed testing. So, perhaps you should use more experienced people, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps you should focus on testing the most critical areas, but the options don't cover that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B. Because if the errors are found during interim, it's best to have a team that can handle those errors more effectively. So more experienced people would be better at handling them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: send negative confirmations. But that might hide the errors, leading to a higher risk. So, that's probably not the best approach.

Wait, another approach: the problem is that errors are found during interim. So, the audit team should adjust their testing. If the errors are in the positive confirmations, more experienced people could handle them better. But if they're in the negative, perhaps the same applies. But the question doesn't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the response is about correcting the errors rather than changing the testing approach. So, option A would be the correct choice.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible answers again.

What is each option suggesting?

A: Negative confirmations. So, if you have errors, perhaps you need to correct them by sending negative confirmations. But that might not be the best approach if the errors are material.

B: More experienced team members for year-end testing. If errors are found during interim, perhaps using more experienced people would be better at handling the year-end testing, which could include the errors.

C: Ignore errors. Unlikely, as errors are material.

D: Less experienced for year-end. Maybe not, because less experience could lead to more errors.

E: Fewer procedures. Fewer procedures might not be as effective as more thorough testing, so perhaps not the best.

F: Fewer procedures. Not necessarily better.

G: Move analytical procedures to year-end. Not sure about this.

H: Higher threshold. If errors are positive, this could be a problem.

So, the best option seems to be B, because more experienced people would be better at handling the errors, which could be either positive or negative. Alternatively, if the errors are positive, A might be better, but I think the question is more about a change in risk assessment, which would require more experienced people.

Wait, but another thought: during interim testing, if you have errors, you might want to adjust the sampling or focus on the most critical tests. But I don't see that option.

Alternatively, perhaps the best response is to correct the errors. So, perhaps option A is correct. But if the errors are positive, that's not ideal.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is to correct the errors, which is option A. But that might not be the best approach if the errors are positive. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the most appropriate response would be to focus on the most critical tests, but the options don't cover that. So, perhaps the answer is B.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it differently. When you find errors in interim testing, you may need to address them. So, if you have errors in the positive confirmations, the team would benefit from more experienced people. If errors are in the negative confirmations, perhaps less experienced people would be better. But since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the best approach is to correct the errors, so option A.

But no, perhaps option B is better because more experienced people can handle any errors, regardless of their type.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option G: Move detailed analytical procedures to year-end. But perhaps that's not necessary if errors are found during interim. Because the errors are already known, and you might have already adjusted your testing approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct response is to correct the errors, which is option A.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is B. Because more experienced people can better assess and correct errors, which is better than ignoring them.

Wait, another angle: the question is which response is most appropriate. So, the best approach after finding errors is to adjust testing, perhaps by using more experienced people, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the error is a positive, the response would be to correct the confirmations, which is option A. But since the question allows any response, and the options are all possible, the most appropriate would be B, as it's a general solution.

So, I think the correct answer is B.

The question involves identifying the most appropriate audit response when unexpected errors are found during interim accounts receivable testing, which leads to a change in risk assessment. The key is to address the errors effectively to minimize materiality issues and avoid incorrect conclusions.

**Option Analysis:**

- **A: Send negative accounts receivable confirmations instead of positive confirmations**  
  Sending negative confirmations could hide errors, potentially leading to a higher risk. This is not ideal if the errors are material.

- **B: Use more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing**  
  More experienced team members are better equipped to handle errors, whether positive or negative, ensuring accurate testing and reducing materiality risks. This is a solid choice as it directly addresses the need to correct errors.

- **C: Ignore the errors as they are not material to the audit conclusion**  
  This is incorrect because errors are material and must be addressed to adjust the risk assessment.

- **D: Use less experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing**  
  Less experienced individuals might struggle with errors, leading to potential issues and not addressing the need to correct them.

- **E: Decrease the use of sampling during audit procedures**  
  Reducing sampling could reduce the risk, but it might also lead to insufficient testing. This is not optimal.

- **F: Perform fewer audit procedures to save time**  
  Fewer procedures might miss critical tests, increasing the risk. This is counterproductive.

- **G: Move detailed analytical procedures from interim to year-end**  
  This might not be necessary if errors are already known. It could complicate testing unnecessarily.

- **H: Increase the dollar threshold of vouching customer invoices**  
  A higher threshold might help catch positive errors but could also hide negative errors. This is not ideal.

**Conclusion:**  
The best approach is to use more experienced team members for year-end testing (Option B). This ensures that errors are effectively addressed, thereby minimizing materiality risks and adjusting the audit conclusion appropriately.

**Answer:** B
