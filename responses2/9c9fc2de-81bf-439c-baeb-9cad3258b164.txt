Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me read it again.

The question is about how an increase in the federal deficit affects the demand for loan funds, the real interest rate, and investment spending. The options are a bit confusing, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when the government runs a deficit, it raises the amount it borrows from the national debt. That would mean the government is expecting more investment or spending to cover that gap. So, the government is borrowing more, which could lead to an increase in demand for loan funds.

Now, the demand for loanable funds. Loanable funds are the money people can lend to banks or others. If the government is increasing its borrowings, this would increase the demand for these funds. So, the demand for loanable funds would go up. That's probably option A or B or E, because those options have increases.

Next, what happens to the real interest rate? The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. If the demand for loanable funds increases, it might push up the nominal interest rate. But if the government is increasing its borrowing, maybe the demand is increasing faster than the supply, which could lead to a higher real interest rate. Or perhaps the increase in demand could lead to higher interest rates regardless of inflation. I'm not entirely sure, but I think an increase in demand for loanable funds would cause the real interest rate to rise. So, real interest rate goes up.

Lastly, investment spending. Investment is influenced by the real interest rate. Lower interest rates encourage more borrowing and investment because it's cheaper to borrow money. If the real interest rate increases, people are less likely to invest, so investment spending would decrease. So, investment spending goes down.

Putting it all together: When the federal deficit increases, demand for loanable funds increases, real interest rate increases, and investment spending decreases.

Looking at the options, let's see which option matches:

Option A: Increases, No change, Decreases. Wait, no, investment spending decreases, so that's wrong.

Option B: Increases, Decreases, Increases. Hmm, no, investment spending decreases, not increases.

Option E: Increases, Increases, Increases. No, because investment spending decreases.

Option F: Decreases, Decreases, Increases. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when the government is borrowing more, it's like a demand for loanable funds. So, the demand for loans increases. The supply of loanable funds is probably fixed or not affected by the government's borrowing. So, if demand increases, the real interest rate rises. Then, lower rates (if real interest rate is lower) would mean more investment. But if real interest rate increases, less investment. So, investment spending decreases.

So, let's re-examine the options. The question is about the correct direction of these effects: demand for loan funds increases, real interest rate increases, investment spending decreases?

Wait, but the options don't have all options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Increase, No change, Decrease → Incorrect, since investment spending decreases.

B: Increase, Decrease, Increase → No, investment spending decreases.

C: No change, Increase, Decrease → No, demand for loans increases.

D: Decrease, Decrease, Decrease → No, investment spending decreases.

E: Increase, Increase, Increase → No.

F: Decrease, Decrease, Increase → No, because investment spending would decrease.

G: Decrease, Increase, Increase → No.

H: Increase, Increase, Decrease → Hmm, real interest rate increases, but investment spending decreases. So, real interest rate up, investment down. So, this would fit.

So, which option is that? Let's look. Option H is:

H: Increases, Increases, Decreases.

Wait, but that can't be right because investment spending can't increase. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. Maybe when the government borrows more, it's a demand for more investment. So, the demand for loanable funds increases (as before). The real interest rate increases because demand exceeds supply. But when the real interest rate increases, people's incentives for investment decrease because the cost (interest) goes up. So, investment spending decreases.

So, the effects are: loan demand up, real rate up, investment down.

Looking for an option where demand for loans increases, real rate increases, investment decreases.

Looking at the options again:

Option H says: Increases, Increases, Decreases. But that can't be correct because an increase in real interest rate would lead to decreased investment.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let's think about the reasons. The real interest rate is the opportunity cost of investing. If the real interest rate increases, it's more expensive to borrow for future investment. So, people would be less inclined to invest, leading to a decrease in investment spending.

So, the correct direction is:

- Demand for loanable funds increases.

- Real interest rate increases.

- Investment spending decreases.

Looking for an option that says "Increases, Increases, Decreases." Let me check the options again:

Option F: Decreases, Decreases, Increases → No.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps none of them have all three correctly. Wait, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: The problem states that the federal deficit increases. So, the government is borrowing more, which would increase its demand for loanable funds. So, demand for loans goes up.

The supply of loanable funds is probably not increasing because the government isn't borrowing it; it's the demand that's increasing. So, the real interest rate would increase because the demand exceeds the supply.

But when the real interest rate increases, people's willingness to invest decreases. So, investment spending would decrease.

So, the correct effects are:

- Demand for loanable funds increases.

- Real interest rate increases.

- Investment spending decreases.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option that matches this. Let me check each option again:

Option G: Decreases, Increases, Increases → No.

Option H: Increases, Increases, Decreases → So, real interest rate increases, but that would cause investment to decrease. However, the question is about the real interest rate's effect on investment spending.

Wait, actually, the real interest rate affects investment: higher real interest rate means people are less willing to invest, so investment decreases. So, the real interest rate's effect is a decrease in investment. So, the correct effect on investment spending is a decrease.

But looking at the options, is there an option where real interest rate increases and investment decreases? Let's see.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option H says: Increases, Increases, Decreases. So, that would mean real interest rate increases, which would lead to a decrease in investment. But option H says "Increases, Increases, Decreases." So, if that's the case, that would fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought that an increase in real interest rate would lead to decreased investment. So, in this case, the effect would be:

- loan funds increase → real rate increase → investment decreases.

So, the effects are:

Demand for loans increases → real rate increases → investment decreases.

Looking at the options, which option has these three effects?

Option F is: Decreases, Decreases, Increases. No.

Option H: Increases, Increases, Decreases.

No, because the increase in real interest rate should lead to a decrease in investment. So, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the entire reasoning again. Let me outline it step by step.

When the federal deficit (government spending) increases, the government needs more funds, so it borrows more. That's an increase in the demand for loanable funds.

The supply of loanable funds is fixed (assuming it's not being used by the government). So, the demand for loanable funds increases, leading to an increase in the real interest rate.

The real interest rate is the market rate minus inflation. Assuming inflation is stable, a higher real interest rate would make borrowing more expensive, so people would hold less money and invest less. Therefore, investment spending decreases.

So, the effects are:

- Demand for loanable funds increases.

- Real interest rate increases.

- Investment spending decreases.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option H: Increases, Increases, Decreases → That's exactly what we have: loan increase, real increase, investment decrease.

But wait, I thought that an increase in real interest rate would lead to decreased investment. So, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the real interest rate is actually measured as the nominal interest rate minus inflation. If the demand for loanable funds increases more than the supply, and if the real interest rate is calculated as the difference between the nominal rate and inflation, then if inflation increases, the real rate could go up or down depending on the change in nominal rate.

Alternatively, if the central bank keeps the inflation rate stable, an increase in the demand for loanable funds would lead to an increase in the real rate (nominal rate - inflation). So, if the real rate increases, people's incentives for investment decrease, so investment spending decreases.

So, the correct effects are: loan demand goes up, real rate goes up, investment spending goes down.

But looking at the options, is such an option present?

Looking at the options again:

Option H: Increases, Increases, Decreases → So, real interest rate increases, investment spending decreases. Yes, that matches.

So, the correct answer is option H. Wait, but earlier I thought that an increase in real interest rate would cause decreased investment.

Wait, in the real world, suppose the central bank keeps inflation stable. If the Fed increases the demand for loanable funds, the real interest rate would rise. When the real interest rate is higher, people will save more and invest less, so investment decreases.

So, the correct effect is as I thought earlier: loan increases, real increases, investment decreases.

So, the correct option is H: Increases, Increases, Decreases.
</think>

The question examines the effects on the demand for loanable funds, the real interest rate, and investment spending when the federal deficit increases. Here's the analysis:

1. **Demand for Loanable Funds**:  
   An increase in the federal deficit triggers an increase in government borrowing, which directly increases the demand for loanable funds.

2. **Real Interest Rate**:  
   With an increased demand for loanable funds and a fixed supply, the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation) rises. This higher rate makes borrowing more expensive, leading to a decrease in investment spending.

3. **Investment Spending**:  
   The real interest rate's increase reduces people's willingness to invest, resulting in a decrease in investment spending.

### Correct Option:
The effects are:  
- Demand for loanable funds increases.  
- Real interest rate increases.  
- Investment spending decreases.  

Looking at the options, the correct choice is **H: Increases, Increases, Decreases**.
