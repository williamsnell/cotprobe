Okay, so I need to find the prime factorization of 48 using exponents where possible. Hmm, prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that prime factorization is breaking down a composite number into a product of its prime factors. So, 48 is a composite number, and I need to break it down into primes.

Let me try dividing 48 by the smallest primes first. I know that 2 is the smallest prime number, so I'll start by dividing 48 by 2.

48 divided by 2 is 24. That's still even, so I divide by 2 again: 24 ÷ 2 = 12. Still even, so divide by 2 once more: 12 ÷ 2 = 6. Still even, so divide by 2 again: 6 ÷ 2 = 3. Now, 3 is a prime number, so I can't divide it further.

So, how many times did I divide by 2? Let me count: 48 ÷2 =24 (1), 24÷2=12 (2), 12÷2=6 (3), 6÷2=3 (4). So that's 4 times, which is 2^4.

Then, the remaining is 3, which is prime. So putting it all together, it's 2^4 multiplied by 3. That's 2^4 * 3.

Looking at the options, option B is 2^4 *3. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option A: 4 *8. 4 is 2^2, 8 is 2^3, so that's 2^(2+3) = 2^5, which isn't 3. So A is incorrect.

Option C: 6*8. 6 is 2*3, 8 is 2^3, so 2*3 *2^3 =2^4*3, which is the same as our answer. Wait, so does that mean both B and C are correct? Or did I make a mistake?

Wait, no. Because in prime factorization, each factor should be prime. So 6 is 2*3, which are primes. 8 is not prime, so it's not acceptable. So C is incorrect because 8 isn't a prime factor.

Wait, but 6*8 isn't the prime factors. So maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, let's think again. When I factor 48, I get 2^4 *3. So that's the prime factorization. So the correct option is B.

But wait, let's look at option C again. 6 × 8 is 48. But 6 is 2×3, which are primes, but 8 is 2^3, which isn't prime. So this isn't the prime factorization. So option C is incorrect.

So the correct factorization is 2^4 *3, which is option B.

But wait, let me check the other options again.

Option E: 2^5 *3. Wait, 2^5 is 32, times 3 is 96, not 48. So E is wrong.

Option J: 2^4 *3^2. 3^2 is 9, 2^4 is 16, 16*9 is 144, which is way bigger than 48. So J is wrong.

Option D: 2^3 *3^2. 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, 8*9 is 72, which is more than 48. So D is incorrect.

So the only correct options are B and C? Wait, no, because C is not the prime factors. So the right one is B.

Wait, but I thought earlier about option C being correct. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me make a table.

Option A: 4*8. 4 is 2², 8 is 2³. So 2²*2³=2^5. But 2^5 is 32, which is not 48. So A is wrong.

Option B: 2^4 *3. 2^4 is 16, times 3 is 48. Correct.

Option C: 6*8. 6=2*3, 8=2^3. So 2*3 *2^3 =2^(1+3)*3=2^4*3. So 2^4*3 is exactly what we have. But wait, 6×8 is also 48 because (2×3)×(2^3)=2^4 ×3. So the factorization is correct, but 6 isn't a prime number. So the factorization should be into primes, which is 2^4 ×3. So the correct prime factorization is given by option B, but option C is also a valid factorization, but it's not in terms of primes. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but in the options, option C is written as 6×8. So in the options, option B says 2^4 ×3, which is correct, and option C is 6×8, which equals 48 but isn't the prime factorization because 6 and 8 are not primes.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 6 ×8, which equals 48, but it's not the prime factors; 6 and 8 are not primes. So the correct factorization is 2^4 ×3, which is option B. So the answer should be B.

The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 multiplied by 3. Therefore, the correct option is B: 2⁴ • 3.

Answer: B
