Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is: "What number multiplied by 4 equals 36?" The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 11 down to 14. Wait, actually, looking closer, I see the options are 11, 10, 12, 6, 15, 9, 7, 8, 13, and 14. Oh wait, the numbers go from 6 to 15 and then down again. That's a bit odd, but I guess it's a list.

So, the equation is: X * 4 = 36. I need to find X. To find X, I can rearrange the equation. If I divide both sides by 4, that would give me X = 36 / 4. Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 4 is 9. So X is 9.

Now I need to check which option is 9. Looking back at the options: option F is 9. So the correct answer should be F.

The equation is X multiplied by 4 equals 36. Solving for X, we divide both sides by 4: X = 36 / 4 = 9. The correct option is F.

Answer: F
