Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The question is about a man jumping into a pool and the force exerted by the water. Hmm. So the man's mass is 100 kg, he jumps from 5 meters high. The water takes 0.4 seconds to stop his velocity. We need to find the average force the water exerts, and there are several options given.

Wait, let me recall Newton's laws. I remember that force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma), but wait—this seems like a problem involving acceleration due to force, so maybe I need to find the acceleration first.

But wait, this involves motion and forces. Oh right, when an object is moving and then stops, the water exerts a force that decelerates it. So the water applies a force opposite to the man's motion, causing a negative acceleration.

So first, I should probably figure out the man's velocity when he hits the water. Since he jumped from 5 meters, maybe using the kinematic equation to find his velocity.

The equation for velocity when starting from rest is v² = u² + 2gh. Wait, but he jumps from rest, so initial velocity u is 0. So v² = 0 + 2gh. Wait, but wait, the height is 5 meters, so h is 5. So v² = 2 * g * h. Oh wait, but wait, wait a second—is that right? Because when you fall from a height, the velocity is calculated from the potential energy converted into kinetic energy. So yes, v = sqrt(2gh).

But wait, does that make sense? So 2 * g is about 19.6, and h is 5, so 2*5=10. 10 * 9.8 is 98. So v² is 98, so v is sqrt(98) ≈ 9.9 m/s. So approximately 10 m/s.

Wait, but I should be more precise. Let me compute it exactly. g is 9.8 m/s². So 2 * 9.8 *5 = 98. So v = sqrt(98) ≈ 9.899 m/s. Let's round it to 9.9 m/s for simplicity.

But let me think again—when he jumps, he's moving downward, and the water comes to his velocity, so the acceleration is downward. So the change in velocity is from 9.9 m/s downward to 0 m/s downward. So the change is 9.9 m/s, but since it's in the same direction, the acceleration is a = Δv / Δt. Wait, but wait, the time given is 0.4 seconds. So how does that fit.

But wait, wait—if the man's velocity is 9.9 m/s downward, and then it reduces to zero after 0.4 seconds, the acceleration a is (0 - 9.9) / 0.4 = -24.75 m/s². Negative because it's deceleration, downward.

But wait, the question is about the average force exerted by the water. So force F = m * a. The mass is 100 kg, so F = 100 * (-24.75) = -2475 N.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. The options are:

A: -2000 N

B: 1200 N

C: 2000 N

D: -2500 N

E: -3480 N

F: -1500 N

G: 1000 N

H: 500 N

I: 980 N

J: 3000 N

Hmm, the force I calculated is about -2475 N. The closest option is D, which is -2500 N. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me recalculate v.

v² = 2 * g * h.

g =9.8 m/s², h=5 m.

v² = 2 *9.8 *5 =98. So v is sqrt(98)= approx 9.899 m/s.

So the change in velocity is 9.899 m/s (since it's the same direction and decreasing), and time is 0.4 s.

So a = (0 - 9.899)/0.4 = -24.7475 m/s².

So F = m * a = 100 kg * (-24.7475) = -2474.75 N.

So approximately -2475 N. Looking at the options, D is -2500 N. That's very close. So the answer is D.

Wait, but wait—the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you've chosen." In the options, the choices are letters A to J. But the options themselves have letters, including the correct one. So in the multiple choice, the correct choice is D: -2500 N.

So the answer is D.

To determine the average force exerted by the water on the man, we start by calculating his velocity when he hits the water. Using the kinematic equation:

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2gh
\]

where \( u = 0 \) (initial velocity), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( h = 5 \, \text{m} \), we find:

\[
v^2 = 2 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 5 = 98 \, \Rightarrow \, v = \sqrt{98} \approx 9.9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The man's velocity is \( 9.9 \, \text{m/s} \) downward. The water takes \( 0.4 \, \text{s} \) to reduce his velocity to zero, so the average acceleration \( a \) is:

\[
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{0 - 9.9}{0.4} \approx -24.75 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

The negative sign indicates deceleration. Using Newton's second law, the average force exerted by the water is:

\[
F = m \cdot a = 100 \, \text{kg} \cdot (-24.75) \approx -2475 \, \text{N}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( -2500 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option D. Therefore, the average force exerted by the water on the man is:
