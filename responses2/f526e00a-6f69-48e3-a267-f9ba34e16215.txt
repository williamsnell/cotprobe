Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about computing the gravitational force between two spheres in a Cavendish balance. Hmm, I remember that the formula for gravitational force is Newton's law of universal gravitation. Let me think... Oh right, the formula is F = G * (m * m') / r², where G is the gravitational constant, m and m' are the masses, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, the question gives the masses in grams and the distance in centimeters. Oh wait, I need to make sure the units are correct. Typically, in physics, we use kilograms for mass and meters for distance. So I'll probably need to convert grams to kilograms and centimeters to meters.

So the given values are m = 1 gram and m' = 500 grams. Oh wait, so 1 gram is 0.001 kg, and 500 grams is 0.5 kg. And the distance r is 5 cm, which is 0.05 meters. Right.

Now, the gravitational constant G is approximately 6.674×10^-11 N·(m²/kg²). Let me plug these values into the formula.

Wait, let me write this out step by step.

First, calculate the product of the masses. m * m' = 0.001 kg * 0.5 kg = 0.0005 kg². Or 5e-4 kg².

Then, the denominator is r squared: (0.05 m)^2 = 0.0025 m².

So the force F would be G multiplied by (m * m') divided by r squared. So F = 6.674e-11 * (5e-4) / 0.0025.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute the numerator first: 6.674e-11 * 5e-4 = 3.337e-14.

Then divide by 0.0025. So 3.337e-14 / 0.0025. Let's see, 0.0025 is 2.5e-3.

So 3.337e-14 divided by 2.5e-3. Hmm, dividing exponentials subtracts exponents. So 3.337 / 2.5 = approx 1.335, and 10^-14 /10^-3 = 10^(-11). So 1.335e-11.

Wait, that's 1.335e-11 N. But wait, the options are in dyne. Oh right, because 1 dyne is 1e-5 N. So I need to convert newtons to dyne. So multiply by 1e5.

So 1.335e-11 N * 1e5 dyne/N = 1.335e-6 dyne. So approximately 1.335e-6 dyne.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.33 × 10^-6 dyne. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Did I make any mistakes in the exponents?

Wait, G is approximately 6.674e-11, multiplied by (1g * 500g) which is 0.001 * 0.5 = 0.0005 kg². So yes, 6.674e-11 * 0.0005 = 3.337e-14. Then (0.05)^2 is 0.0025. So 3.337e-14 / 0.0025 = 1.3348e-11 N. Yes.

Convert N to dyne: 1.3348e-11 N * 1e5 dyne/N = 1.3348e-6 dyne. So approximately 1.33 × 1e-6, which is option B.

To compute the gravitational force between the large and small spheres in a Cavendish balance, we use Newton's law of universal gravitation:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{m \cdot m'}{r^2}
\]

### Given Data:
- Mass of the large sphere, \( m = 1 \, \text{gm} = 0.001 \, \text{kg} \)
- Mass of the small sphere, \( m' = 500 \, \text{gm} = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \)
- Distance between the spheres, \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \)
- Gravitational constant, \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)

### Step 1: Convert units to SI
- \( m = 0.001 \, \text{kg} \)
- \( m' = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \)
- \( r = 0.05 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the product of the masses
\[
m \cdot m' = 0.001 \cdot 0.5 = 0.0005 \, \text{kg}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the square of the distance
\[
r^2 = (0.05)^2 = 0.0025 \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 4: Compute the force in newtons
\[
F = G \cdot \frac{m \cdot m'}{r^2} = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot \frac{0.0005}{0.0025}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{0.0005}{0.0025} = 0.2
\]

Thus:
\[
F = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 0.2 = 1.3348 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 5: Convert newtons to dyne
Since \( 1 \, \text{dyne} = 10^{-5} \, \text{N} \):
\[
F = 1.3348 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 10^5 = 1.3348 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{dyne}
\]

### Final Answer:
The force of gravitational attraction is approximately \( 1.33 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{dyne} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
