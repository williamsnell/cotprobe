Okay, so I've got this problem here about two used car offers, and I need to figure out which one is lower and by how much. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says the first dealer offers a used car for $2,500 less 15%. I remember that "less" means a discount, so I need to calculate 15% of $2,500 and subtract that from the original price.

Calculating 15% of $2,500: 0.15 * 2500 = $375. So the first offer is 2500 - 375 = $2,125.

Now, the second dealer's offer is a bit more complicated. They're offering a similar car for $2,350 less 10%, and also charge a $25 tune-up. Let me tackle each part separately.

Starting with the base price: $2,350 minus 10%. 10% of 2350 is 0.10 * 2350 = $235. So subtracting that gives 2350 - 235 = $2,115.

Then, add the $25 tune-up. So $2,115 + $25 = $2,140.

Now I need to compare the two offers: $2,125 and $2,140. The first is lower. The difference is 2140 - 2125 = $15.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First offer: 15% of 2500 is 375, so 2500 - 375 is 2125. Correct.

Second offer: 10% of 2350 is 235, so 2350 - 235 is 2115. Add 25 for the tune-up: 2140. So 2140 is higher than 2125 by $15. So the first offer is lower by $15. Looking at the options, option G is $15.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J. Let me check the options again.

The options are:
A: $40
B: $30
C: $35
D: $20
E: $0
F: $50
G: $15
H: $5
I: $25
J: $10

So the correct answer is G, $15.

The first dealer offers $2,500 less 15%, which calculates to $2,125. The second dealer offers $2,350 less 10% plus $25, totaling $2,140. The first offer is lower by $15.

Answer: G
