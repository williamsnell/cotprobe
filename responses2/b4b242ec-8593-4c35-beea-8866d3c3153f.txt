Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility in water. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says a chemist dissolves BaSO4 in pure water at 25°C. The K_sp is given as 1 × 10^-10. I need to find the solubility. Alright, I remember that K_sp is the solubility product constant, which relates the concentrations of the ions when a sparingly soluble salt dissolves in water.

BaSO4 is a barium sulfate. Barium typically has a +2 charge, and sulfate is -2, so it's a neutral compound. The dissolution equation should look like this: BaSO4(s) ⇌ Ba²+(aq) + SO4²-(aq). 

Wait, yeah, so the dissolution produces one Ba²+ ion and one SO4²- ion. So the solubility (let's call it 's') would be equal to the concentration of Ba²+ and SO4²- ions in solution, right? Because each mole of BaSO4 produces one mole of each ion.

So the solubility 's' would be [Ba²+] = [SO4²-] = s. 

Now, the K_sp equation for BaSO4 would be K_sp = [Ba²+][SO4²-]. Substituting what we have, K_sp = s * s = s².

So s² = 1 × 10^-10. To find 's', take the square root of both sides. That gives s = sqrt(1e-10) = 1e-5. So the solubility is 1e-5 M.

Wait, let me double-check. If Ksp is 1e-10, then s squared is 1e-10. Taking square root, s is 1e-5. So yes, the solubility is 1e-5 M. Looking at the options, option A is 1e-5 M. So the answer is A.

Wait, but wait, are there any possible mistakes? Let me think again. Oh, no, I think that's correct. Because for a compound AB, the solubility is the square root of Ksp. Since each mole gives one Ba²+ and one SO4²-, that's why it's s squared equals Ksp. So yes, s is 1e-5 M, which is option A.

To determine the solubility of BaSO₄ in pure water at 25°C, we start with the dissolution equation:

\[
\text{BaSO}_4(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Ba}^{2+}(aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)
\]

Let the solubility of BaSO₄ be \( s \) (in mol/L). From the stoichiometry of the dissolution, the concentrations of \(\text{Ba}^{2+}\) and \(\text{SO}_4^{2-}\) ions in solution are both \( s \). The solubility product constant (\( K_{sp} \)) is given by:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ba}^{2+}][\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = s \cdot s = s^2
\]

Substituting the given \( K_{sp} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \):

\[
s^2 = 1 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
s = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-10}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the solubility of BaSO₄ in pure water is \( 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option A.
