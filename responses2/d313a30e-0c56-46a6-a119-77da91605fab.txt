Question:

This question refers to the following information.
On Being Brought from Africa to America
'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic die."
Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a poem by Phillis Wheatley. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which idea from the given options is most directly reflected in the poem. The poem is titled "On Being Brought from Africa to America" and it's a poem about redemption and the concept of a God and a Saviour.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one and see how they relate.

Option A: The natural rights theory of John Locke. I remember that Locke was a Enlightenment thinker, advocating for individual rights. The poem doesn't seem to talk about rights or individualism. It's more about redemption and divine concepts. So maybe not A.

Option B: British ideas about social hierarchy. The poem doesn't mention hierarchy or social structures. It's more about redemption and God. So B probably isn't the answer.

Option C: The Romantic literary movement. Romanticism was a movement that focused on nature, individualism, and the spirit. The poem deals with redemption and God, which are more about spiritual concepts, not necessarily the Romantic movement. So C might not be it.

Option D: The First Great Awakening. That was a movement in the late 18th and early 19th century, promoting Enlightenment ideas, including racial equality. The poem talks about redemption and joining the angelic train, which sounds like it's about joining the spiritual community, which is related to the First Great Awakening. So D could be a possible answer.

Option E: The Transcendentalist movement. That was a later movement, more about literature and the spirit, similar to Romanticism. The poem doesn't specifically touch on transcendentalism, so E might not fit.

Option F: The American Revolution. The poem is about coming from Africa to America, but it's not directly about the revolution itself. So F is probably not the right choice.

Option G: The Eighteenth century scientific racism. The poem doesn't mention any racism or scientific aspects, so G doesn't seem relevant.

Option H: The Enlightenment philosophy. The ideas here are more about spirituality and redemption, which aligns with Enlightenment thought. The First Great Awakening is a part of that, so H might be a contender.

Option I: The Enlightenment philosophy. This is a broader category. The poem's content, like the themes of redemption and God, would fit Enlightenment ideas. So I's a candidate.

Option J: The Abolitionist movement. Again, the poem is about coming from Africa, which is more about migration thanAbolition. So J is probably not the answer.

Now, I'm trying to decide between D and I. The First Great Awakening is about the spirit and joining a spiritual community, which includes things like joining the angelic train. The Enlightenment includes a lot of such ideas, including the concept of joining the spiritual train. So the poem's themes support the First Great Awakening's focus on joining the spiritual community, which is a part of the Enlightenment.

Alternatively, the Enlightenment includes more about the spirit and how people come to understand God and the Saviour. The answer options include the First Great Awakening and Enlightenment ideas.

Wait, what's the difference between D and I? The First Great Awakening emphasizes spiritual unity and the spirit's role in society. The Enlightenment includes a broader set of ideas about the mind and spirit, including the idea that people are created in the image of God. So the poem's themes definitely relate to the Enlightenment's ideas.

So the correct answer would be D or I. But the question is asking which is directly revealed. The First Great Awakening is a specific event, not the general Enlightenment. The poem's message is about the spirit and joining the train to God, which is a key theme in the First Great Awakening. Therefore, the correct answer should be D or I. Wait, but I'm trying to see if the options are about the ideas of the movement. 

Wait, the question is which idea is most directly expressed. So D is the First Great Awakening, which is a specific movement. The ideas include the transformation of the American mind, bringing it in line with the Enlightenment's ideas.

So the answer is D: The First Great Awakening.

The poem reflects the themes of the First Great Awakening, which emphasizes the spirit and the transformation of the American mind. 

Answer: D
