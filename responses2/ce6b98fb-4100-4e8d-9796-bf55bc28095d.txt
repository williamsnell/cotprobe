Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the median of Brian's quiz scores. Let me think through this step by step. I remember that the median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If there's an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But wait, let me make sure I get this right.

First, the scores are given as: 8, 6, 9, 7, 10, 9, 5, 4, 9. Hmm, eight numbers here. So, that's even. So, I need to sort them in order. Let me arrange them from smallest to largest.

Let's list them out: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10. Wait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any. Starting from the original list, 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9. Let me sort them:

4 comes first, then 5, then 6, then 7, then 8, then 9 (the first 9), then another 9, then another 9, and the last one is 10. So the sorted list is 4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10. There are nine numbers now. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original list is 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9. Let me count them again: 1:8, 2:6, 3:9, 4:7, 5:10, 6:9, 7:5, 8:4, 9:9. So nine numbers. Wait, so if I sort them, the middle one is the fifth number because with nine numbers, the middle is the (9+1)/2 = 5th. So the fifth number in the sorted list is the median.

Wait, no, wait. Let me arrange the list correctly. The original list is 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9. Let me list all of them: 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9. So when I sort them, I need to arrange them in increasing order. Let's do that:

Start with the smallest number. The smallest is 4. Then 5. Then 6. Then 7. Then 8. Then 9. Then another 9. Another 9. And finally 10. So the sorted order is 4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10. So yes, nine numbers. So the fifth number is the median. Let me count: 1:4, 2:5, 3:6, 4:7, 5:8. So the fifth number is 8. So the median is 8.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, 9 numbers, so the middle is (9+1)/2 = 5th term. So the fifth term is 8. So the median is 8, which is option D. So the answer should be D:8.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in sorting. Let me recount each step. Original list: 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9.

Let me write all numbers: 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9.

Now, arranging in order: 4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10. Yeah, that's correct. So the fifth number is 8.

So the median is 8, which is option D.

The median is the middle value of an ordered list of numbers. For nine numbers, the middle is the fifth. After sorting, the numbers are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10. The fifth number is 8. 

Answer: D
