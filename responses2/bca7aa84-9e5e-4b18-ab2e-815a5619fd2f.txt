Okay, so I've got this question about property law, specifically about reversionary interests. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks what's called when a remainder in the grantor's heirs becomes a reversion in the grantor. The options are A to J. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that when a grantor's heirs leave a remainder, it can become a reversion. A reversion is usually an estate that's given to someone else after the grantor's heirs pass, but the reversion isn't automatically valid unless certain conditions are met.

The options are:

A: Related Doctrine of Merger – Not sure. I think the Doctrine of Merger deals with reversionary interests, maybe in some cases where interests merge.

B: Contingent remainder – That's when the remainder is contingent, meaning it depends on some condition. Not sure how that relates to becoming a reversion.

C: Doctrine of Worthier Title – That's a doctrine where the grantor's estate takes priority if one heir's estate is invalid. So if their heirs leave a remainder, that could become their estate, but I don't think that's when it becomes a reversion.

D: Doctrine of Escheat – Wait, escheat is when a grantor's estate takes priority in a conveyance where the grantor is transferring another estate. So if the grantor's estate is given to heirs, but the remainder is escheat, the remainder becomes part of the grantor's estate, not a reversion.

E: Vested remainder – That's an estate that's given to the grantor's heirs, but as a vested remainder, it's automatically vested at the death of the last surviving heir. So it's not a reversion but a vested remainder.

F: Rule in Wild's Case – I think Wild's Rule is about certain cases where a remainder can't be a reversion because the grantor's estate is too close for the reversion to take effect. So Wild's Rule applies to such cases where the reversion isn't valid.

G: Doctrine of Lapse – That's when the grantor's estate lapses (loses title) to their heirs. So the remainder becomes part of the grantor's estate, not a reversion.

H: Rule in Shelley's Case – Shelley's Rule probably deals with cases where a remainder is not a reversion because the grantor's estate is too close or there's a breach. So Shelley's Rule would prevent the remainder from being a reversion.

I: Doctrine of Advowson – I'm not very sure about this. Advowson is about the right to inherit or be reconstituted. I think it's when the grantor's estate can be reconstituted, but not sure how it connects to a reversion.

J: Rule Against Perpetuities – That's about the rule that a remainder must vest in a certain period after the death of the last heir. If it doesn't, it's invalid as a reversion.

So the question is about when the remainder becomes a reversion. From what I remember, the Doctrine of Lapse (G) makes the remainder part of the grantor's estate. But I think that's when the remainder is a reversion. Wait, no. The Doctrine of Lapse is when the grantor's estate lapses to their heirs, making the remainder part of the grantor's estate, not a reversion.

Wait, the question is about when a remainder becomes a reversion. So the options that could be this are B or F, H, J, or maybe D.

Wait, another approach: A reversion is an estate given to someone else after the grantor's heirs. When the remainder is given to the grantor's heirs as a reversion, that must have occurred through a reversionary interest. So what makes a remainder a reversion?

I think the Doctrine of Lapse (G) says that if the grantor's estate lapses, then the remainder becomes part of the grantor's estate. So that's a reversion. Wait, no. Because the remainder is given to the grantor's heirs, but if the grantor's estate lapses, then the remainder is part of the grantor's estate, not a reversion to the heirs.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the Doctrine of Lapse (G). Or maybe the Rule in Shelley's Case (H). I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, another way to think: A reversion is when the grantor's estate lapses, making the remainder part of the estate. So that's the Doctrine of Lapse, which is option G. But wait, the question is when the remainder becomes a reversion. So maybe it's when the remainder is given to the grantor's heirs, but the grantor's estate lapses, so the remainder becomes part of the grantor's estate, which would be a reversion. So that would be the Doctrine of Lapse, which is G.

Alternatively, I might have it backwards. Wait, the Rule in Shelley's Case (H) is about cases where a reversion isn't valid because the grantor's estate is too close. So perhaps that's when a remainder can't be a reversion. So that's H.

Wait, but the question is about when a remainder becomes a reversion. So if a remainder is given to the grantor's heirs, but under certain circumstances, that's not a reversion. So for a remainder to become a reversion, perhaps it's when the grantor's estate lapses. That would be the Doctrine of Lapse (G). So the correct answer would be G.

Alternatively, the Rule in Shelley's Case (H) is about a reversion not being valid because the grantor's estate is too close. So if the grantor's estate can't lapses, then the remainder is not a reversion.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The question is, when a remainder becomes a reversion in the grantor. So the process would be the grantor's estate lapses, making the remainder part of it, which is a reversion.

So the correct doctrine is Doctrine of Lapse (G). So the answer is G.

The question asks when a remainder in the grantor's heirs becomes a reversion in the grantor. A reversion is an estate given to someone else after the grantor's heirs, but it requires the grantor's estate to lapse. The correct doctrine for this scenario is the Doctrine of Lapse, which states that the grantor's estate lapses to their heirs, making the remainder part of the estate and thus a reversion. Therefore, the correct answer is G.

Answer: G
