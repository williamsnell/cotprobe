Okay, so I've got this question about conditioned response and reinforcement. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about what happens when a conditioned response is acquired, and then the procedure is changed. Specifically, the CS (conditioned stimulus) is presented repeatedly without being followed by the UCS (unconditioned stimulus). I need to figure out what the result is.

I remember that reinforcement can be strengthened, strengthened, or extinguished. There's also the concept of habituation, where a behavior becomes automatic over time when repeatedly reinforced. Also, there's extinction, which is when a response that hasn't been strengthened (or maybe just maintained) is suddenly extinguished.

Wait, let me recap. The CS is presented a lot, but the UCS isn't given. So, after the CS is repeatedly given, the UCS isn't followed. That sounds like the CS is being reinforced repeatedly without the UCS, which is the opposite of the usual association needed for CS-UCS pairing.

So, what happens when CS is delivered repeatedly without the UCS? That's called extinction. Because without the UCS, the CS won't be reinforced again, so the CS becomes extinguished. So the behavior that was previously reinforced now won't happen again.

Looking at the options, option I is extinction of the conditioned response. Option E is increased resistance to extinction, but that doesn't sound right. I think extinction is when the response is extinguished, so the behavior doesn't happen anymore.

Wait, let me think about the process. If you have a CS and an UCS, and the association is maintained, you get extinction. But if the CS is presented a lot without the UCS, that's the oppositeâ€”so extinction occurs. So the correct result is extinction of the conditioned response, which means the CS is no longer reinforced, and the behavior stops.

Other options: B is habituation, which is when a behavior becomes automatic after repeated reinforcement. But that's when the CS is associated with the UCS, not when it's not. So B doesn't fit. Similarly, no change in response behavior would be if the CS is still reinforced, but that's not the case here.

Option F is increased resistance to extinction. I don't think so. If the CS isn't followed by the UCS, the CS is no longer reinforced, so the resistance should increase. But the question is about what happens, not the increased resistance. So it's more about the occurrence.

So, the result is that the conditioned response is extinguished, meaning the CS isn't reinforced anymore. So the correct answer should be I: Extinction of the conditioned response.

The correct answer is I: Extinction of the conditioned response.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Scenario:** The question describes a situation where a conditioned response (CS) is repeatedly presented without being followed by the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). This is the opposite of the typical CS-UCS association, where the CS and UCS are linked to form a conditioned response.

2. **Extinction of the CS:** When a CS is repeatedly reinforced without the UCS, the CS is no longer reinforced. This is because the association between CS and UCS is removed, leading to the CS being extinguished.

3. **Analyzing the Options:**
   - **Option I (Extinction of the conditioned response):** Correct, as explained above.
   - **Option E (Increased resistance to extinction):** Incorrect, because if the CS is not reinforced, the behavior should extinguish, not become more resistant.
   - **Other Options:** Incorrect for reasons related to habituation, reinforcement strength, or the nature of the scenario.

4. **Conclusion:** The result is the extinction of the conditioned response, making option I the correct choice.

**Answer:** I: Extinction of the conditioned response
