Question:

6.I-I. One characteristic of a car's storage console that is checked by the manufacturer is the time in seconds that it takes for the lower storage compartment door to open completely. A random sample of size $n=5$ yielded the following times:
$\begin{array}{lllll}1.1 & 0.9 & 1.4 & 1.1 & 1.0\end{array}$
(a) Find the sample mean, $\bar{x}$.

Options:

A: 1.6
B: 1.4
C: 1.5
D: 1.3
E: 0.8
F: 1.2
G: 1.0
H: 1.7
I: $1.1$ 
J: 0.9

Okay, so I need to find the sample mean of the given data. Let me see, the data given is the time it takes for the lower storage compartment door to open, and there are five data points. The times are 1.1, 0.9, 1.4, 1.1, and 1.0 seconds. 

I remember that the sample mean is calculated by adding up all the data points and then dividing by the number of observations. So, first, I should add all these numbers together. Let me write them down: 1.1, 0.9, 1.4, 1.1, 1.0.

Let me sum them step by step. Starting with the first two: 1.1 + 0.9 equals 2.0. Then, adding 1.4 to that gives 3.4. Next, adding another 1.1 brings it to 4.5. Finally, adding the last 1.0 makes the total 5.5 seconds.

Wait, wait, let me check that again. So 1.1 + 0.9 is 2.0. Then plus 1.4 is 3.4. Then add 1.1: 3.4 + 1.1 is 4.5. Then add 1.0: 4.5 +1.0 =5.5. So the total sum is 5.5.

Now, since there are 5 data points, I'll divide this sum by 5. So 5.5 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 5.5 รท 5 is 1.1. So the mean is 1.1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me just make sure I didn't make an addition error. Let me add the numbers in a different order to confirm.

1.1 + 0.9 = 2.0. 2.0 + 1.4 = 3.4. 3.4 + 1.1 = 4.5. 4.5 + 1.0 =5.5. Yep, same result.

So the sum is 5.5. Divided by 5 gives 1.1. So the sample mean is 1.1 seconds. Looking at the options, option I is 1.1. So the answer should be I.

The sample mean is calculated by dividing the sum of all data points by the number of observations. The data points are 1.1, 0.9, 1.4, 1.1, and 1.0, which sum up to 5.5. Dividing by 5 gives a mean of 1.1. 

Answer: I
