Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem here. Let me start by reading the question carefully. So, there are two firms in the market. Both of them have no costs of production, which probably means they can produce as much as they want without facing any barriers. The demand curve is given by Q = 150 - P, and these are identical products. So, both firms produce the same kind of good, which probably means they can set prices independently.

The question is about finding the Bertrand model Nash equilibrium. I remember that in the Bertrand model, firms compete by setting prices. Since there are no costs, they can set prices without worrying about costs, but they have to consider what the other firm is doing.

Wait, no, actually, in the Bertrand model, each firm can choose any price, and the firm with the lower price captures the entire market. But if both set the same price, they split the market. So, if both firms set the same price, they each get half of the demand. 

But wait, in this case, both firms have no costs. So, the question is, what price will they set? If they set the same price, what happens? Well, in the Bertrand model, the lowest price wins. So if both set the same price, the market is split, each getting half the demand.

But since both firms are identical, it doesn't matter which one sets the price. So in the equilibrium, they would probably set the same price. But wait, the question is about the Nash equilibrium. So, in the equilibrium, each firm chooses a price such that it is the best response to the other firm's price.

But if both firms can set any price, why would they do that. Wait, but in the case where both can undercut each other, the Nash equilibrium might involve one firm setting a slightly lower price and the other capturing the entire market. But wait, no, because if one sets a lower price, the other can undercut, but since both have no costs, perhaps they can undercut each other.

Wait, but in the Bertrand model, if both firms have identical cost structures and zero costs, but they can choose any price. Let me think. So, the demand is Q = 150 - P. So, if both set P, then the total quantity is 2P? Because each firm sets P, so total quantity is P + P = 2P. Wait, no, wait: Q is the sum of both quantities. So if both set price P, each firm's quantity is P, so total Q is 2P. So the demand at price P is 150 - P. So the total quantity is 2P. So 2P = 150 - P.

Wait, no, the demand equation is Q = 150 - P. So, the total quantity is 150 - P. So if two firms set the same price P, each firm's quantity is P, so the total is 2P. So 2P = 150 - P. Solving that: 2P + P = 150 → 3P = 150 → P = 50. So each firm sets P=50, leading to total Q=100. So the equilibrium price is 50.

But wait, in the Bertrand model, if both firms can undercut each other, they might set a price just below the other's. But since in this question, the firms have no costs, so maybe they can undercut each other to near zero. But in that case, the other firm would capture the entire market.

Wait, but let's think about the payoffs. If one firm sets P=0, what happens? Well, the other firm can set P=0 and capture the entire market. So, for the firm that sets P=0, their profit is (150 - 0)*0 = 0. The other firm gets 150-0=150. So the firm with P=0 would prefer to set a price just above zero, because then both firms can set a price just below, leading to the demand being split.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, in the Bertrand model with identical firms and no costs, the Nash equilibrium is for both firms to set the same price equal to zero. Because if they set any positive price, the other firm can undercut them by setting a slightly lower price, but since the firm with the lower price captures the entire market. Wait, but if a firm sets a price just below the other, the other firm can undercut it by a tiny amount, leading to the first firm capturing almost all the market.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because in the Bertrand model, if both have the same cost structure, the equilibrium is for them to set the same price equal to the minimum cost. Which in this case is zero. Because if one firm sets a positive price, the other can undercut to nearly zero, but since the other can set a price just below the one, the one can't undercut because the other can set a price just below.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. In the Bertrand model, when both firms have identical cost structures and zero costs, the Nash equilibrium is for both to set the same price. If one sets a higher price, the other can undercut it. But since both have the same cost (zero), undercutting is possible but leads to a lower price.

Wait, but in reality, in the Bertrand model without any cost barriers, the equilibrium price is the lowest possible. But if costs are zero, why would they undercut each other? Because if one sets a price just slightly below the other, the other can undercut, but they can't because they have the same cost structure. So, perhaps the equilibrium is where both set the same price, but in the case where costs are zero, this would be the same as the minimum possible price, which is zero.

Wait, but wait. In the standard Bertrand model, if costs are positive, the equilibrium is at the lowest cost. But if costs are zero, you can undercut each other, but the price can be as low as possible. So in the case of identical firms with zero costs, they can set prices as low as zero, which would lead to both capturing the entire market. But that doesn't make sense. Because if both set P=0, then the total quantity is 150-0=150, so each firm would get 75 units. So the total demand is 150 when P=0, so each firm's price is zero, and each sells 75 units. 

But in that case, why would the firm choose to set P=0? Because if they set P>0, they would get a lower price. But if both set P=0, both get 75 each, but if one sets P=0.01 and the other sets P=0, the one with P=0.01 captures the entire market, thus earning a higher profit. So, why would the firm with P=0.01 set it? Because they'd make some profit.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. So, in the case where the firms are identical and have zero costs, they can undercut each other to any price. But since zero is the lowest possible, perhaps that's the Nash equilibrium. Alternatively, perhaps the Nash equilibrium is for both to set the same price, but in this case, if both set the same price, say P, then the total quantity is 2P = 150 - P → 3P=150 → P=50. So each firm sets 50, and the total quantity is 100. So the demand is 100. Each firm's profit is (50) * (150 - 50 - 50) ) = 50 * 50 = 2500. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe they set P=0, leading to each getting 75 each, but then neither can undercut each other further because both can set as low as zero, leading to both getting 75 each. But that would be a Nash equilibrium as well, because neither can improve by changing their price.

Wait, but in this case, are there multiple Nash equilibria? Or is there a unique one. Alternatively, maybe the Nash equilibrium is for both to set a price equal to the minimum possible, which is zero. Because if both set zero, neither can undercut each other and capture the entire market.

But wait, the problem says the firms are identical. So perhaps the Nash equilibrium is for both to set the same price, but in the case of zero costs, that's zero. So the answer would be zero. Looking at the options, option C is zero.

Wait, but another way to think about this is: when both firms set the same price, they split the demand. So, each's demand is their own price divided by two? Because each firm sets P, so each has P, so total quantity is 2P. So, to satisfy Q = 150 - P, 2P = 150 - P → 3P=150 → P=50. But wait, that's a different outcome. So which is correct?

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The demand function is Q = 150 - P, where Q is the total quantity. So, when both set P, total Q is P + P = 2P. Therefore, 2P = 150 - P → 3P=150 → P=50. So each sets 50, total Q is 100, each gets 50 units.

So, why would this be the case? Because if both set a higher price, say 60, the total quantity would be 120, which is more than the demand. So at P=60, Q=90. But if both set P=50, Q=100. So, the equilibrium is at P=50.

Alternatively, if both set P=40, Q=80, which is less than 150-P=110. So the demand is 80, which is less than 110. So, the demand is met, but both set P=40.

Wait, but this seems contradictory. So, perhaps at P=50, the demand is 100, which is met by both setting 50. Thus, each gets 50 units, and the total demand of 100 matches.

So, in this scenario, the equilibrium is at P=50, not zero. So why is the option zero included? Let me think again. Because if both set P=0, the total demand is 150-0=150. So, each would get 75 units. But if one firm sets P=0.01, the other can undercut it by setting P=0, capturing the entire demand. So, in that case, the firm setting P=0.01 would make zero profit (since 0.01*(150-0.01) = 1.499, but if the other sets P=0, they get 150-0=150. So, the first firm would lose money by setting a slight price above zero. Thus, both firms would limit their prices to zero, because otherwise, one can undercut the other.

So, the Nash equilibrium is where both set P=0, as neither can profitably set a price higher than zero.

Wait, but that's only if both set zero. If both set zero, the total demand is 150, so each gets 75. So, each firm's profit is zero, because they set P=0 and demand is 150, so each gets 75 units. But if one firm sets P=0.1, and the other sets P=0, the one with P=0.1 would capture all 150 units, leading to a higher profit. So, the P=0.1 is not a Nash equilibrium because the firm with P=0.1 can deviate to P=0 and capture the entire market, making its profit higher. Therefore, the only Nash equilibrium is when both set P=0, because neither can undercut the other without losing profit.

So in that case, the answer is zero. Looking at the provided options, option C is 0.

The question involves two identical firms in a market where demand is given by \( Q = 150 - P \), and both firms compete under the Bertrand model, where they simultaneously set prices. The goal is to determine the Nash equilibrium price \( P \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Bertrand Model Basics**: In the Bertrand model, firms compete by setting prices. If both firms set the same price, they split the market demand equally. Firms with identical cost structures will undercut each other to the lowest possible price, but in this case, costs are zero, meaning they can set any price without incurring additional costs.

2. **Demand Function**: The total quantity demanded \( Q \) is given by \( Q = 150 - P \). If both firms set the same price \( P \), each firm's quantity demanded is \( P \), so the total demand is \( 2P \). Therefore, \( 2P = 150 - P \), which simplifies to \( 3P = 150 \), giving \( P = 50 \).

3. **Nash Equilibrium Consideration**:
   - If both firms set \( P = 50 \), each firm gets \( 50 \) units of demand, and the total demand is \( 100 \), which matches \( 2P \).
   - However, this outcome assumes that both firms can undercut each other to \( P = 50 \). But in reality, if one firm sets \( P = 0 \), the other can undercut it by setting \( P = 0 \), capturing the entire market demand of \( 150 \).
   - This creates a scenario where both firms would prefer to set \( P = 0 \) to maximize their profits, as any positive price would allow the other firm to undercut and capture the entire market.

4. **Conclusion**: The Nash equilibrium in this scenario is for both firms to set the price at \( P = 0 \). Neither firm can profitably undercut the other without losing higher profits.

### Final Answer:
The price in the Nash equilibrium is **0**.
