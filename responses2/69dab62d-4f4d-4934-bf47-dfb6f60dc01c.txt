Okay, so I've got this question about assessing the property taxes for Booksville. Let me see what it's asking. The city's assessed valuation is $50,600,000, and they require $4,500,000 in property taxes. I need to find the tax rate per $100 and per $1,000. Hmm, I think tax rates are usually calculated based on the assessed value, right?

So, I remember that the tax rate is the tax amount divided by the assessed value. So I should take $4,500,000 and divide it by $50,600,000. Let me do that division. Let me calculate 4,500,000 / 50,600,000. Hmm, that's the same as 4500 / 50600, maybe I can simplify that. Wait, 4500 divided by 50600. Let me compute that.

Wait, maybe I can cancel zeros: 4500 ÷ 50600 equals 450 ÷ 5060. Let's do that division. 5060 goes into 450 how many times? 5060 is larger than 450, so it's 0. So we consider 45000 divided by 50600. Let me write it out.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 4500 / 50600 = (4500 ÷ 50600) = 0.089027... Wait, let me do it step by step.

4500 divided by 50600. Let's think about this as 4500 ÷ 50600 = (4500 ÷ 50600). Let me divide both numerator and denominator by 100: 45 ÷ 506.0. Hmm, 506 goes into 45 zero times. So, 0. Let me add a decimal point and some zeros: 450 ÷ 506.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me compute 4500 ÷ 50600. Let's use a calculator approach. 4500 divided by 50600 equals approximately 0.089027. Let's round that to five decimal places. So 0.08903.

Now, that's the tax rate as a decimal. But the question asks for the tax rate per $100 and per $1,000. So, to find the rate per $100, I need to multiply that decimal by 100. Similarly, per $1,000, I multiply by 1000.

So, 0.08903 * 100 = 8.903%. That's per $100. And 0.08903 * 1000 = 89.03%. So the tax rate per $100 is approximately 8.903%, which is 8.90300 when rounded to five decimals.

Looking at the options, option I is 8.893%, option H is 9.500%, etc. Wait, but wait, I'm getting 8.903%, which isn't exactly any of the options I thought. Let me check again.

Wait, did I miscalculate? Let me compute 4500 / 50600 again. 50600 is 506 * 100. So 4500 / (506 * 100) = (4500 / 506) / 100. So 4500 ÷ 506 is approximately 8.8932. So 8.8932 / 100 = 0.088932, which is 8.8932%. Oh! Wait, that's different from what I did before. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, okay, I think I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me redo it. So 4500 divided by 50600.

Alternatively, 4500 / 50600 = (4500 ÷ 50600) = 0.088932 approximately. So 0.088932 as a decimal. Multiply by 100 to get per $100: 8.8932%, and per $1,000: 88.932%.

Looking at the options, option I is 8.893%, but wait, that's only three decimal places. Oh, wait the question says to carry division to 5 decimal places. So when I calculate 4500 / 50600, what's the precise value?

Let me compute 4500 ÷ 50600.

50600 goes into 4500 zero times. So 0.

Add a decimal point and zeros: 45000.000000...

50600 goes into 45000 zero times. So 0.0.

Next: 450,000 ÷ 50600.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 4500 ÷ 50600.

Let me compute it as 4500 / 50600. Let's compute 4500 ÷ 50600.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 45 ÷ 506 ≈ 0.088932.

Ah, so 0.088932. So that's a tax rate of 8.8932%, which is 8.8932%. 

Now, the options are:

A: 6.893%

B: 12.893%

C:7.893%

D:9.893%

E:5.500%

F:11.893%

G:7.500%

H:9.500%

I:8.893%

J:10.893%

So, 8.8932% is approximately 8.8932. But the options have I as 8.893%, and H as 9.500%.

Wait, but the options don't have 8.8933%. So perhaps I'm supposed to round it to five decimal places. So 8.8932% when rounded to five decimals is 8.89320%, which would be 8.89320%. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is I: 8.893%, but that's only three decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I did the division wrong. Let me compute 4500 / 50600.

Let me do this step by step.

50600 × 0.08 = 4048.

50600 × 0.09 = 4554.

But 50600 × 0.088932 is 4500, approximately. Wait, let me compute 50600 * 0.088932.

50600 * 0.08 = 4048.

50600 * 0.008932 = let's compute 50600 * 0.008 = 404.8, 0.000932 *50600 = 47.0872. So total is 404.8 + 47.0872 = 451.8872. So 4048 + 451.8872 = 4499.8872, which is approximately 4500. So 50600 × 0.088932 ≈ 4500. So 0.088932 is the correct value.

So the tax rate is 8.8932%, which is 8.89320%. So when you round to five decimal places, it's 8.89320%. But the options don't have 8.8932%, so perhaps the correct answer is I: 8.893%, but it's actually 8.8932, which is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects truncating or rounding differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the tax is $4,500,000 on a valuation of $50,600,000. So, to find the tax rate per $100, that's (4,500,000 / 50,600,000) * 100 = (0.088932) * 100 = 8.8932%. 

But looking at the options, I is 8.893%, and H is 9.500%. So option I is the closest, but I'm not sure if the options have five decimal places or just rounded.

Wait, the question says to carry division to 5 decimal places. So perhaps the exact value is 8.89320%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, maybe I messed up the division. Let's compute 4,500,000 divided by 50,600,000.

So 4500000 ÷ 50600000.

Let me write this as 4500000 / 50600000. Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 4500 / 50600.

Simplify: 4500 / 50600 = 450 / 5060. Now, 450 ÷ 5060.

Hmm, 5060 goes into 450 how many times? 0. So 0. So 45000 ÷ 50600.

Let me compute this as 45000 ÷ 50600. Let's find how many times 50600 fits into 45000. 50600 is larger than 45000, so it's 0. So we add a decimal point and some zeros: 450000 ÷ 50600.

Compute 50600 goes into 450000 how many times.

50600 × 8 = 404800.

Subtract that from 450000: 450000 - 404800 = 45200.

Bring down a zero: 452000.

50600 × 8 = 404800. 452000 - 404800 = 47200.

Bring down a zero: 472000.

50600 × 9 = 455400. 472000 - 455400 = 16600.

Bring down a zero: 166000.

50600 × 3 = 151800. 166000 - 151800 = 14200.

Bring down a zero: 142000.

50600 × 2 = 101200. 142000 - 101200 = 40800.

Bring down a zero: 408000.

50600 × 8 = 404800. 408000 - 404800 = 3200.

Bring down a zero: 32000.

50600 × 0 = 0. So 0.

So putting it all together, the division gives us 0.0889320... So 0.0889320.

So, the tax rate is 8.89320%, which when rounded to five decimal places is 8.89320%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is I: 8.893%, but that's only up to three decimals. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently. Let me think about the tax rate as a percentage per $1,000.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the tax rate is (tax amount / valuation) * 1000.

Because, for example, the tax is $4,500,000 on $50,600,000. So per $1,000, the tax is 4500 / 50600 = 0.088932 per $1,000. So 8.8932% per $1,000.

Wait, that would be 8.8932%, which again is similar to before. So the rate per $1,000 is approx 8.8932%, which is 8.8932 per $1,000.

Looking at the options, option I is 8.893%, which is 8.89300%. So perhaps the closest answer is I:8.893%. But wait, the actual value is 8.89320%. So it's 8.8932%, which is 8.8932, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the tax rate per $1000 as (tax amount) / (valuation) * 1000.

So, 4,500,000 / 50,600,000 = 0.088932 per $1000. So 0.088932 *1000 = 88.932 per $1,000. So the rate per $1,000 is 88.932%. Hmm, but that's not one of the options either. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase.

The tax rate is calculated as (tax amount) / (assessed valuation) × 100. So the tax rate is a percentage of the assessed value, not the tax amount. So per $100, it's (tax rate) × 100. Wait, no, the tax rate is a percentage, not a rate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the tax rate as a percentage of the assessed value, and that's how much the tax is per $100 or $1,000.

Another way: the assessed value is $50,600,000, and the tax is $4,500,000. The tax rate is 4,500,000 / 50,600,000 = 0.088932, which is 8.8932%. So that's the rate. 

Looking for per $100: 8.8932% per $100. So 8.8932% is the correct rate per $100. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is I:8.893%, but that's only three decimal places. But in the options, I is 8.893, which is 8.893% (three decimals), and H is 9.500% (five decimals). 

Wait, maybe the question expects the tax rate to be 8.893% per $100, which is I. But I'm not sure because the options don't have five decimal points. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different method.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try it again.

4,500,000 divided by 50,600,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 45,000 / 506,000.

Compute 45,000 ÷ 506,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10,000: 4.5 ÷ 50.6.

Now, 50.6 goes into 4.5 zero times. So 0.

Add a decimal point and a zero: 45 ÷ 506. Still zero.

Add another zero: 450 ÷ 506. Still zero.

Another zero: 4500 ÷ 506. How many times does 506 fit into 4500?

506 × 8 = 4048. 4500 - 4048 = 452.

Bring down a zero: 4520.

506 × 8 = 4048, so 4520 - 4048 = 472.

Bring down a zero: 4720.

506 ×9=4554. 4720 -4554=166.

Bring down a zero:1660.

506×3=1518. 1660-1518=142.

Bring down a zero:1420.

506×2=1012. 1420-1012=408.

Bring down a zero:4080.

506×7=3542. 4080-3542=538.

Bring down a zero:5380.

506×10=5060. 5380-5060=320.

Bring down a zero:3200.

506×6=3036. 3200-3036=164.

So putting it all together, the division gives us 0.0889320... So 0.0889320.

So the tax rate is 8.89320%, which is approximately 8.8932%.

Now, looking at the options again:

A: 6.893% → No.

B:12.893% → No.

C:7.893% → No.

D:9.893% → No.

E:5.500% → No.

F:11.893% → No.

G:7.500% → No.

H:9.500% → No.

I:8.893% → Yes.

J:10.893% → No.

So the correct answer is option I:8.893%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct answer was 8.8932%, which is 8.8932%. So why is option I 8.893?

Ah, perhaps I should have carried the division to five decimal places. Wait, when I did the division, I got 0.088932, which is six decimal places. But to get five, perhaps I need to round. 

Wait, 0.088932 is approximately 0.08893 when rounded to five decimal places. So 8.893%. So option I is 8.893%, which matches this.

Oh! So the correct answer is I:8.893%.
</think>

To determine the assessed valuation of the property, we calculate the tax rate as a percentage of the assessed valuation. The tax rate is computed as follows:

- **Tax amount**: $4,500,000
- **Assessed valuation**: $50,600,000

The tax rate is calculated by dividing the tax amount by the assessed valuation and multiplying by 100 to obtain a percentage:

\[
\text{Tax rate} = \left( \frac{\$4,500,000}{\$50,600,000} \right) \times 100 = 0.088932 \times 100 = 8.8932\%
\]

Carrying the division to five decimal places gives approximately 8.8932%. When rounding to five decimal places, this becomes 8.8932%. However, none of the options provided match this exactly. Upon reviewing the options, the closest match is option **I: 8.893%**, which is the first three decimal places of our calculated value.
