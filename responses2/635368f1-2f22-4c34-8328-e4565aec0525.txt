Okay, so I've got this question about factor groups. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking for the order of the factor group (Z_11 × Z_15)/⟨⟨1,1⟩⟩. Hmm, right. I remember that the order of a factor group G/H is equal to the order of G divided by the order of H if H is a subgroup of G. But wait, what's the order of Z_11 × Z_15 first?

Z_11 and Z_15 are cyclic groups of orders 11 and 15 respectively. The order of their direct product should be the product of their orders, so 11*15=165. So |G| is 165.

Now, H is the subgroup generated by the element ⟨1,1⟩. I need to figure out what H looks like. In the direct product Z_11 × Z_15, the element (1,1) generates a cyclic subgroup. I think the order of this element is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of 1 in each component. Wait, each component is Z_11 and Z_15. The order of 1 in Z_11 is 11, and in Z_15 it's 15. So the order of (1,1) is LCM(11,15). Let me calculate that.

11 and 15 have factors: 11 is prime, 15 is 3*5. So LCM is 11*3*5=165. That's the same as |G|. Wait, so does that mean that ⟨(1,1)⟩ is the entire group G? Because the order of (1,1) is 165, which is equal to the order of G. So H would be the entire group, meaning the factor group G/H is trivial, which has order 1.

Wait, but let me think again. G is Z_11 × Z_15, which has 165 elements. H is ⟨(1,1)⟩. The order of (1,1) is 165, so H has 165 elements. So G/H has 165 / 165 = 1 element. So the order is 1. That would correspond to option A:1.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the order of (1,1). Let me double-check. In the cyclic groups, the order of (a,b) in Z_m × Z_n is LCM(ord(a), ord(b)), where ord(a) is the order of a in Z_m, ord(b) the same in Z_n. So for (1,1) in Z_11 × Z_15, ord(1) in Z_11 is 11, and in Z_15 it's 15. LCM(11,15) is indeed 165. So the order of (1,1) is 165, which is the same as the order of G. So the subgroup H is G itself. Therefore, G/H is the trivial group, which has order 1.

The order of the factor group (Z_11 × Z_15)/⟨⟨1,1⟩⟩ is 1.
