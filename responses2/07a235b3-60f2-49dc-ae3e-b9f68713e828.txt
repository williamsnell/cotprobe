Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of projectile motion. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says a ball is thrown at a 45-degree angle and lands 90 meters away. I need to find the initial speed. Hmm. I remember that in projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical motions are independent. So, the horizontal distance, or range, depends on the initial speed and the angle, but there's also the time the ball is in the air.

Wait, right, the formula for the range (R) of a projectile when it's thrown at an angle θ is R = (v₀² * sin(2θ)) / g. Oh, wait, but wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh, yeah, I think that's correct. Because sin(2θ) would give us sin(90 degrees) when θ is 45, which is 1. So R = (v₀² * 1) / g. So R = v₀² / g.

Wait, but wait, is that right? Because some sources say R = (v₀² * sin(2θ)) / g. Oh yeah, because sin(2θ) is 2 sinθ cosθ. So for θ=45, that's 1, so it's 2*(√2/2)^2. Wait, no, that's not necessary right now. Let me just proceed.

So the given range R is 90 meters. And θ is 45 degrees. So plugging into R = (v₀² * sin(90)) / g. Sin(90) is 1, so R = v₀² / g. So v₀ squared equals R multiplied by g. So v₀ = sqrt(R * g).

Wait, but wait, what is the value of g? I think it's approximately 9.8 m/s². So g is about 9.8 m/s².

So R is 90 m, so v₀ squared is 90 * 9.8. Let me calculate that. 90 * 9.8 is 882. So v₀ is sqrt(882). What's the square root of 882? Let me think. 29 squared is 841, 30 squared is 900. So 29.7 squared is about 882? Let's see: 29.7 * 29.7. Hmm, 29^2 is 841, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms are 2 * 29 * 0.7 = 40.6. So 841 + 40.6 + 0.49= 882.09. Oh, so v₀ is approximately 29.7 m/s. Looking at the options, I don't see 29.7, but I have option G as 25, H 15, I 28, J 30. So the closest is option J (30 m/s) or I (28 m/s). Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait a second. Did I get the formula correctly? Because I think I might have mixed up something. Let me think again. The range formula is R = (v₀² * sin(2θ)) / g. Oh, right, because sin(2θ) is a factor. But in this case, θ is 45 degrees, so sin(90) is 1. So I was correct earlier. So R = v₀² / g.

Wait, but 90 = v₀² / 9.8 → v₀² = 90 * 9.8 = 882 → v₀ = sqrt(882) ≈ 29.7 m/s. None of the options exactly match that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Or perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, another thing. The standard formula for range is R = (v₀² sin(2θ)) / g. Oh wait, no, wait, I think I'm mixing up the formula. Let me double-check. The correct formula is R = (v₀² sin(2θ)) / g. So for θ =45°, sin(90°) is 1. So R = v₀² / g. So yes, v₀² is 882, so v₀ is sqrt(882) ≈29.7 m/s.

Looking at the options, I don't see 29.7. The options are A:50, B:45, C:25, D:20, E:30, F:55, G:40, H:15, I:28, J:30. So the closest is J (30 m/s). But wait, let me think again. Is there another formula where I might have used g as 10 m/s², which is the approximation often used?

If g is taken as 10, then R would be v₀² *1 / 10 → v₀² = R * 10 → 90 *10=900 → v₀=30 m/s. Oh! So if g is considered as 10, then the answer is 30 m/s, which is option J.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because in many problems, especially in exams, g is often approximated as 10 m/s². So perhaps the problem expects us to use that. So in that case, let's recalculate.

If g is 10 m/s², then v₀² = R * g → 90 *10 =900 → v₀=30 m/s. Which is option J. So that would be the answer.

But wait, I thought earlier that the formula is R = v₀² * sin(2θ) / g. But if θ is 45, sin(90) is 1, so that simplifies to R = v₀² / g. So if the problem uses g=10, then it's 90 *10 = 900 → v₀=30.

So perhaps the correct answer is J: 30 m/s, assuming g=10.

To determine the initial speed of the ball, we use the formula for the range of a projectile:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

Given:
- The range \( R = 90 \, \text{m} \),
- The angle \( \theta = 45^\circ \),
- The acceleration due to gravity \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (commonly used in approximations).

Since \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2}{g}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
90 = \frac{v_0^2}{10}
\]

\[
v_0^2 = 90 \times 10 = 900
\]

\[
v_0 = \sqrt{900} = 30 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the initial speed of the ball is \( 30 \, \text{m/s} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
