Alright, so I've got this question here about what term describes someone who doesn't believe in the existence of God. Let me think through this. I'm a bit new to these terms, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the options provided: monotheist, humanist, pantheist, agnostic, polytheist, atheist, nihilist, hedonist, theist, deist. Hmm.

I remember that monotheists believe in one God, so that might not fit unless someone is saying they don't believe in monotheism, but the question is about not believing in God in general. So monotheist isn't the answer here.

Humanists are people who believe in humanism, which is about living a life focused on personal development, ethics, and the greater good. That's more about values and ethics than belief in God, so probably not the term we're looking for.

Pantheists, or pantheists, believe in a single all-powerful being, often God, as the supremum being. So if someone is pantheist, they would believe in God. But the question is about someone who doesn't believe in God, so pantheist isn't the answer.

Atheists are people who don't believe in God. That seems to match what the question is asking. So option F is an option for the answer.

Let me check the others. The theist is someone who believes in a higher power, which would be the opposite of what we're looking for. So I can rule that out.

Nihilists don't believe in God but might have other beliefs, but the question is about a lack of belief in God, so perhaps they don't fit. But I'm not certain if 'nihilist' specifically refers to lack of belief in God or something else. I think their term is broader, focusing on lack of faith in God, but some might have other beliefs as well. Maybe the answer is different.

Hedonists are people who believe that life is a series of good and bad choices, and they focus on the end result. So their belief is more about ethics and consequences rather than the existence of God. So while they don't believe in God, they might not be called 'nihilists' if they don't have other beliefs. I'm a bit confused here.

Theist is the opposite; they believe in God, so it's not the term we want.

Deists are a different category, often believing in a single God but perhaps in a different way. Also, not directly related to lack of belief in God.

So the options left are F (atheist) and G (nihilist). But the question is about someone who doesn't believe in the existence of God, which is a general term. So I think the answer is F, the atheist.

Wait, but some sources say that some theists are agnostics, meaning they don't believe in God. But the question is about someone who doesn't believe in the existence of God in general. So if someone is agnostic, they don't believe in God at all, which might be a better fit than being a theist. Or maybe agnostic is a broader term that includes theist as well.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The question is about someone who doesn't believe in God, regardless of other beliefs. So an agnostic person is someone who doesn't believe in God but may or may not hold other beliefs. Whereas a theist is someone who does believe in God.

So the correct term would be agnostic because it refers to not believing in the existence of God. The theist is someone who does believe in the existence of God.

So the answer should be D: agnostic.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Because if someone is an agnostic, they don't believe in the existence of God, so that's the term we're looking for. A theist does believe in God, so the answer can't be theist.

So putting it all together: The term is agnostic, so the answer is D.

The correct term is D: agnostic. 

Answer: D
