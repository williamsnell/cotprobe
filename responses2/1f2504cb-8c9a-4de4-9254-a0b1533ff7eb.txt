Answer:

Okay, so I have this calculus problem to solve. The equation given is x²y² - 3y + 2x³ = 0, and I'm told that y is a function of x, so y = f(x). The question is asking for the derivatives f’(1) and f’(2) near the points (1,1) and (1,2), respectively. Then I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find the derivative of y with respect to x at two different points. The first point is (1,1), so x is 1 and y is 1. The second point is (1,2), so x is 1 and y is 2.

Since y is a function of x, I can use implicit differentiation to find dy/dx (which is f’(x)) by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x. 

Let me write down the equation again: x²y² - 3y + 2x³ = 0.

I'll differentiate each term with respect to x. 

First term: d/dx [x² y²]. This is a product of x² and y², so I'll use the product rule. The derivative of x² is 2x, and y²'s derivative is 2y y'. So, putting it together: 2x y² + x² * 2y y'.

Wait, wait no: the product rule is (f*g)' = f’g + fg’. So, for x² y², it's (2x)(y²) + (x²)(2y y').

Second term: d/dx [-3y]. That's straightforward. The derivative is -3 y'.

Third term: d/dx [2x³]. That's 6x².

So putting it all together: 

2x y² + 2x² y y' - 3y' + 6x² = 0.

Now, I need to solve for y'. Let me collect all the terms with y' on one side.

So, terms with y': 2x² y y' and -3y'. The other terms are 2x y² + 6x².

So, factor y' from the terms with it:

y' (2x² y - 3) = - (2x y² + 6x²).

Wait, wait, no: the equation after differentiation is:

2x y² + 2x² y y' - 3y' + 6x² = 0.

Let me rearrange:

2x y² + 6x² = -2x² y y' + 3 y'.

Bring all y' terms to the right:

2x y² + 6x² = y' ( -2x² y + 3 )

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it step by step.

Original after differentiation:

2x y² + 2x² y y' - 3y' + 6x² = 0.

Let me group the y' terms:

2x² y y' - 3y' = -2x y² -6x².

Factor y' on the left:

y' (2x² y -3) = -2x y² -6x².

So, y' = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / [2x² y -3]

I can factor numerator and denominator to simplify. Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: -2x y² -6x² = -2x ( y² + 3x )

Denominator: 2x² y -3 = 2x² y -3.

So, y' = [ -2x (y² + 3x) ] / (2x² y -3 )

Alternatively, I can factor out a negative sign from numerator and denominator for easier simplification.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I can factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -2x (y² + 3x) = -2x y² -6x².

Denominator: 2x² y -3.

So, y' = (-2x y² -6x²) / (2x² y -3 )

I can factor numerator and denominator, but perhaps I can also factor out a negative from the numerator to make it look nicer.

Wait, perhaps I can factor both numerator and denominator by 2x² or something. Alternatively, let me plug in the known points to find the derivatives. Because I need to find f’(1) and f’(2), so I need to compute y' at (1,1) and (1,2).

So first, for (1,1): x=1, y=1.

Plug into the expression for y':

y' = [ -2*(1) * (1)^2 -6*(1)^2 ] / [ 2*(1)^2*(1) -3 ]

Calculate numerator: -2*(1)*(1) -6*(1) = -2 -6 = -8

Denominator: 2*(1)*(1) -3 = 2 -3 = -1

So y' = (-8)/(-1) = 8.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when I plug x=1 and y=1 into the equation x² y² -3y + 2x³ =0:

(1)^2*(1)^2 -3*(1) + 2*(1)^3 = 1 -3 +2 = 0. So yes, the point (1,1) is on the curve.

Wait, but looking at the numerator: -2x y² -6x². At x=1, y=1: -2*1*1 -6*1 = -2-6 =-8.

Denominator: 2x² y -3. At x=1, y=1: 2*1*1 -3 =2-3= -1.

So, y' is (-8)/( -1 )=8. So f’(1) is 8.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 8 as the first number. Hmm, the options are A: [12, -18], B: [9, -13], etc. So none of the options have 8, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the numerator. Let me recalculate.

Wait, let me re-derive the equation. The original equation is x² y² -3y + 2x³ =0.

Differentiating both sides, I have:

d/dx (x² y²) = 2x y² + x² * 2y y' = 2x y² + 2x² y y'

d/dx (-3y) = -3 y'

d/dx (2x³) =6x².

So the equation becomes:

2x y² + 2x² y y' -3 y' +6x² =0.

Now, collect the terms with y':

(2x² y -3) y' + (2x y² +6x²) =0.

So, (2x² y -3) y' = - (2x y² +6x² )

Thus, y' = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / (2x² y -3 )

Wait, that's correct.

So, for (1,1):

Numerator: -2*(1)*(1)^2 -6*(1)^2 = -2 -6 = -8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) -3 = 2 -3 = -1.

So y' = (-8)/(-1) =8.

So f’(1)=8. But the options don't have 8 as the first element. Hmm, perhaps I should check for (1,2) first, to see if that makes sense.

For (1,2): x=1, y=2.

Compute numerator: -2*(1)*(2)^2 -6*(1)^2 = -2*(4) -6 = -8 -6 = -14.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(2) -3 = 4 -3 =1.

So y' = (-14)/1 = -14.

So f’(1)=8, f’(2)= -14.

Looking at the options, option H is [8, -16], but wait, no. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: [12, -18]

B: [9, -13]

C: [9, -15]

D: [8, -14]

E: [11, -17]

F: [5, -11]

G: [6, -12]

H: [10, -16]

I: [7, -13]

J: [7, -12]

So for f’(1)=8, the first number is 8, but none of the options have 8 as the first entry. So that suggests I might have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerator. Let me check again.

Wait, the numerator is -2x y² -6x². At x=1, y=1: -2*1*(1) -6*1 = -2-6 =-8. Correct.

Denominator: 2x² y -3. At x=1, y=1: 2*1*1 -3= -1. Correct.

So y’=8. But the options don't have 8 as first number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation step.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the differentiation.

Wait, another way: perhaps write the equation as x² y² + 2x³ = 3y, then differentiate. Let me try that.

Differentiating x² y²:

d/dx (x² y²) = 2x y² + x² * 2y y' = 2x y² + 2x² y y'.

Derivative of 2x³ is 6x².

Derivative of 3y is 3 y'.

So equation becomes: 2x y² + 2x² y y' +6x² =3 y'.

Rearranging terms:

2x² y y' -3 y' = -2x y² -6x².

Factor y' on left:

y' (2x² y -3) = -2x y² -6x².

So y' = (-2x y² -6x²)/(2x² y -3). Which matches the earlier result.

So at (1,1), that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 8 in the first position. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the question wants another approach.

Wait, maybe I should plug in the values into the equation to find y' at (1,1) and (1,2).

Wait, but wait, when x=1, y=1, the equation holds. So perhaps y’ at (1,1) is 8. But the options don’t have 8 as the first number. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Oh wait, no, actually, let me check all the options. Let me see if any of them have 8 as the first element.

Looking at the options:

A: [12, -18]

B: [9, -13]

C: [9, -15]

D: [8, -14]

E: [11, -17]

F: [5, -11]

G: [6, -12]

H: [10, -16]

I: [7, -13]

J: [7, -12]

Wait, no, none of the options have 8 as the first number. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerator and denominator signs. Let me double-check.

Wait, going back, the expression is:

y’ = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / [ 2x² y -3 ]

At (1,1):

Numerator: -2*(1)*(1)^2 -6*(1)^2 =-2*1 -6*1 =-2-6 =-8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) -3 =2 -3 =-1.

So yes, y’= (-8)/(-1)=8.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is [8, -14], which would be option D, but the first number is 8, but none of the options list 8 as the first number. So perhaps I made a mistake in differentiation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me use implicit differentiation another way.

Another approach: perhaps I can write the equation as x^2 y^2 + 2x^3 = 3y.

Differentiating:

d/dx [x² y² + 2x³ ] = d/dx [3y ]

Which is 2x y² + x² * 2y y' +6x² = 3 y'.

So, same as before.

So, same steps.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for another way to compute y’ at (1,1) and (1,2).

Wait, perhaps I should consider using the equation to find y’ at (1,2) first, which might be a simpler calculation.

At (1,2): x=1, y=2.

Numerator: -2*(1)*(2)^2 -6*(1)^2 = -2*4 -6= -8 -6= -14.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(2) -3= 4-3=1.

So y’= (-14)/1= -14. So for (1,2), f’(2)= -14.

So the second number is -14, which is in option D as the second number (since D is [8, -14]). The first number is 8, but none of the options have 8 as the first element. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the derivative again, maybe a different approach.

Let me try to solve for y’ from the equation x² y² -3y +2x³ =0.

y² (x²) -3y +2x³ =0.

We can write this as x² y² = 3y -2x³.

Take natural log on both sides? Well, that's an idea, but maybe too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use implicit differentiation correctly.

Rewriting the equation: x² y² - 3y + 2x³ =0.

Differentiating both sides with respect to x:

d/dx (x² y²) = d/dx (3y) - d/dx (2x³).

Wait, no, the entire left side is x² y², so d/dx of that is 2x y² +x² * 2y y'.

Right side: 3y' -6x².

So:

2x y² + 2x² y y' = 3 y' -6x².

Bring all y’ terms to the left and others to the right.

2x² y y' -3 y' = -2x y² -6x².

Factor y':

y' (2x² y -3 )= -2x y² -6x².

Thus, y’= [ -2x y² -6x² ] / [2x² y -3 ]

Yes, same result as before.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but none of the options have 8 as the first number. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should not have done the differentiation, perhaps I should use another method like using the original equation to express y as a function of x near these points and compute the derivative numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in plugging in the values. Wait, wait, hold on: perhaps I should compute y’ at (1,2) again, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, for (1,2):

Numerator: -2*(1)*(2)^2 -6*(1)^2 =-2*4 -6= -8 -6 =-14.

Denominator:2*(1)^2*(2) -3=4-3=1.

So, y’= -14/1= -14. So f’(2)= -14.

So the second number is -14, which is in option D as the second number, and the first number is 8. But the options don't have 8 as the first number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerator. Let me recheck.

Wait, another way: perhaps the equation is x² y² -3y +2x³=0. So for (1,1), plugging in:

1² *1² -3*1 +2*(1)^3=1 -3 +2=0. Correct.

But perhaps I can use the equation to express y as a function of x and find y’ using the formula for inverse functions. Let me think.

Wait, if I can express y as a function of x, then y’ would be dy/dx. But perhaps another approach is to use the formula for implicit differentiation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem again. Oh, wait, perhaps I can consider a function f(x) = y, and then the derivative f’(x) is the same as y’.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator. Let me recompute:

At (1,1):

Numerator: -2*(1)*(1)^2 -6*(1)^2= -2*1 -6*1= -2-6= -8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) -3=2-3= -1.

So, y’= (-8)/(-1)=8.

But the options don't have 8 as the first number. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should compute the derivative using the equation when x=1 and y=1, but perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, let's recompute the derivative:

d/dx (x² y²) = 2x y² + x² * 2y y' = 2x y² + 2x² y y'

d/dx (-3y )= -3 y'

d/dx (2x³ )=6x².

So, combining:

2x y² + 2x² y y' -3 y' +6x² =0.

Now, group terms with y':

(2x² y -3) y' + (2x y² +6x² )=0.

Thus, (2x² y -3) y' = - (2x y² +6x² ).

So, y' = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / [ 2x² y -3 ].

Which is the same as earlier.

So, at (1,1):

Numerator: -2*(1)*(1)^2 -6*(1)^2 =-2 -6= -8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) -3=2 -3= -1.

Thus, y’= (-8)/(-1)=8.

But since the options don't have 8 as the first element, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can make a mistake in the calculation of the numerator. Let me check the numerator again:

At (1,1):

numerator: -2*(1) * (1)^2 -6*(1)^2 =-2*1 -6*1 =-2 -6= -8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2 * (1) -3=2*1 -3=2-3=-1.

So, y’= (-8)/(-1)=8.

Hmm, but the options do not include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps I should check the equation again. The original equation is x² y² -3 y + 2 x³ =0.

Wait, perhaps I should write this as x² y² + 2 x³ = 3 y.

Then, differentiate both sides.

d/dx (x² y² + 2 x³ )=d/dx (3 y )

Which is 2x y² + x² * 2y y' +6x² =3 y'.

So, 2x² y y' -3 y' = -2x y² -6x².

Factor y' on left:

y' (2x² y -3 )= -2x y² -6x².

So, y' = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / [2x² y -3 ]

Which is same as earlier.

So, no mistake in the differentiation.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the numerator and denominator signs.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator:

At (1,1):

Numerator: -2*(1)*(1)^2 -6*(1)^2 =-2*1 -6*1 =-2-6=-8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) -3=2*1 -3=2-3=-1.

So, y' = (-8)/(-1)=8.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation as:

x² y² = 3 y - 2 x³.

Then, take derivative:

d/dx [x² y²] =d/dx [3 y -2 x³].

Which is 2x y² + x² * 2y y' = 3 y' -6x².

So, same as before.

So, no mistake.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the derivative at (1,1) by using a small change in x and calculating y and then using them to compute the derivative.

Let me approach it numerically.

Let me take x=1, and y=1. Now, let me take a small delta, say, delta_x=0.001, and compute the corresponding delta_y, then compute the derivative as delta_y / delta_x.

Compute y_new when x=1+0.001=1.001.

So, the equation becomes (1.001)^2 (y_new)^2 =3 y_new -2 (1.001)^3.

Compute (1.001)^2 ≈1.002001.

(1.001)^3≈1.003003001.

So, equation: 1.002001 (y_new)^2 = 3 y_new -2*(1.003003) ≈3 y_new -2.006006.

So, 1.002001 (y_new)^2 -3 y_new +2.006006=0.

We can solve for y_new numerically.

Let me set y_new=1 for a start.

Compute left side:1.002001 (1)^2 -3*(1) +2.006006=1.002001 -3 +2.006006= (1.002001 +2.006006) -3=3.008007 -3=0.008007.

So, the equation is approximately 0.008007=0. So, this is a positive value. We can adjust y_new upwards.

We can use the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me compute f(y)=1.002001 y² -3 y +2.006006.

f(y)=0.008007 at y=1.

f'(y)=2*1.002001 y -3=2.004002 y -3.

At y=1, f’(y)=2.004002 -3= -0.995998.

Using Newton-Raphson:

y_new = y - f(y)/f’(y) =1 - (0.008007)/(-0.995998)=1 + 0.008036=1.008036.

So, y_new ≈1.008036.

Thus, the change in y is approximately 0.008036.

The change in x is 0.001.

So, the derivative is approximately 0.008036 /0.001=8.036.

Which is close to 8.

Thus, the y’(1)=8.

But since the options don't have 8 as the first number, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation as:

x² y² + 2 x³ = 3 y.

Then, take the derivative:

d/dx (x² y² +2 x^3 ) = d/dx (3 y).

Which is 2x y² +x² *2y y' +6x² =3 y'.

So, same as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is [8, -14], but since the first number is not present in the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the point (1,2) is in the options and that the problem statement was about (1,2).

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to find f’(2) using the equation and the options.

At (1,2), x=1, y=2.

So, equation: (1)^2 (2)^2 -3*(2) +2*(1)^3=4 -6 +2=0. Correct.

Now, compute y’ at (1,2):

As before, we have y’= (-14)/1= -14.

Which is option D: [8, -14]. Wait, no, option D is [8, -14].

Wait, no, option D is [8, -14], with first number 8 and second -14.

But in our case, the first number is 8, but the option doesn't have 8 as the first. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. Oh! Wait, the original problem says: 'equation x^2 y^2 -3y +2x^3 =0, and the options are given as the pairs (f’(1), f’(2))'.

Wait, so perhaps the first number in the answer is f’(1), which is 8, and the second is f’(2)=-14. So the pair is (8, -14), which is option D.

Wait, but in the options, option D is [8, -14], which is the correct pair. But earlier, I thought that the first number is 8 and the second is -14, which is option D.

Wait, but looking back, I thought that the first number is 8, but perhaps I was wrong. So, perhaps I should proceed to see if the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the first number is 8 and the second is -14, which is option D. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the first number is f’(1) and the second is f’(2). So, the answer is [8, -14], which is option D.

But earlier, in the options, I thought that option D is [8, -14]. So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the first number is 8, but the options don't have 8 as the first. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is [8, -14], which is option D.

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is option D: [8, -14].
</think>

The correct answer is option D: [8, -14].

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Equation:**
   \[
   x^2 y^2 - 3y + 2x^3 = 0
   \]
   We need to find \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) (denoted as \( f'(x) \)) at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \).

2. **Differentiate Implicitly:**
   Differentiate both sides with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 y^2) - \frac{d}{dx}(3y) + \frac{d}{dx}(2x^3) = 0
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - \(\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 y^2) = 2x y^2 + x^2 \cdot 2y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}\)
   - \(\frac{d}{dx}(3y) = 3 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}\)
   - \(\frac{d}{dx}(2x^3) = 6x^2\)

   Putting it all together:
   \[
   2x y^2 + 2x^2 y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} - 3 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + 6x^2 = 0
   \]

3. **Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):**
   Rearrange to collect terms with \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):
   \[
   (2x^2 y - 3) \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x y^2 - 6x^2
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-2x y^2 - 6x^2}{2x^2 y - 3}
   \]

4. **Evaluate at \( x = 1 \):**
   - **At \( (1,1) \):**
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-2(1)(1)^2 - 6(1)^2}{2(1)^2(1) - 3} = \frac{-2 - 6}{2 - 3} = \frac{-8}{-1} = 8
     \]
   - **At \( (1,2) \):**
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-2(1)(2)^2 - 6(1)^2}{2(1)^2(2) - 3} = \frac{-8 - 6}{4 - 3} = \frac{-14}{1} = -14
     \]

5. **Result:**
   The derivative at \( x = 1 \) is 8, and at \( x = 2 \) is -14. Thus, the pair is [8, -14], which corresponds to option D.

**Answer:**
D
