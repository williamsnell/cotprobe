Okay, so I've got this question about power factors. Hmm, let me think. I remember power factors have to do with the ratio of real power to apparent power. Real power is what's actually used, and apparent power is the product of voltage and current. The power factor (PF) is real power over apparent power, so PF = Real / Apparent.

The question gives me three measurements: anammeter reading, volt-meter reading, and wattmeter. Wait, but what do those mean exactly? The ammeter is the current meter, so it should read the current, I. The volt meter reads the voltage, V. And the wattmeter shows the power, P.

Wait, but wait. The ammeter reads 0.15 A. Oh, that's current, I. The volt meter reading is 115 V. So V is 115. The wattmeter shows 15.9 watts. So P is 15.9.

Apparent power is V multiplied by I, right? So apparent power S is V * I. Let me calculate that. V is 115, I is 0.15. So 115 * 0.15 is... 17.25. So S is 17.25.

Now, real power P is 15.9 watts. So PF is P/S. So 15.9 divided by 17.25. Let me compute that. 15.9 / 17.25. Hmm, 17.25 is the same as 69/4. So 15.9 is 159/10. Let me compute 159/10 divided by 69/4. That's (159/10) * (4/69). Simplify, 159 and 69 have a common factor. 69 is 23*3, 159 is 53*3? Wait, 53*3 is 159, yes. So 159/69 = 53/23. So (53/23) * (4/10) = (53 * 4)/(23 *10) )= 212 / 230. Simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 106/115. Let me compute that as a decimal. 106 ÷ 115. Hmm, 115 goes into 106 zero times. 1060 ÷ 115 = let's see, 115*9=1035. So 9 * 115 is 1035. 1060 - 1035 is 25. So 106/115 = 0.913 approximately. So about 0.913. Looking at the options, option G is 0.99, but that's a bit higher. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait wait, no. Let me double-check the calculations. V is 115, I is 0.15, so S is 115 * 0.15 = 17.25, right. P is 15.9. So PF is 15.9/17.25. Let me compute 15.9 divided by 17.25.

Another approach: 15.9 /17.25 = (15.9 * 100) / (17.25 *100) = 1590 / 1725. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 15. 1590 ÷15= 106, 1725 ÷15= 115. So 106/115. As I did before, that's approximately 0.913. But looking at the options, let me check the options again.

Options: A is 0.85, B 0.75, C 1.02 (which is more than 1, impossible for PF), D 1.10, E 0.80, F 0.65, G 0.99, H 0.70, I 0.92, J 0.55.

Wait, my calculation gives 0.913, which is close to 0.91, but the options don't have 0.91. The closest is option I: 0.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the readings. Ammeter is 0.15 A, which is the current. The current is low, so maybe the power factor is low.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the ammeter reading is in milliamps? No, 0.15 A is 150 mA. Hmmm. Or perhaps I confused apparent with other terms. No, no, the approach seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the power factor formula again. PF is cos(theta), where theta is the phase angle between voltage and current.

Wait, oh wait! Wait a minute, the power factor is (Real power)/(Apparent power) = P/S. Which I did. So PF is 15.9 / 17.25, which is approximately 0.913, so 0.91. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:0.85, B:0.75, C:1.02 (impossible), D:1.10, E:0.8, F:0.65, G:0.99, H:0.7, I:0.92, J:0.55.

So the closest is G, which is 0.99, or I, 0.92. Hmm, my calculation is around 0.913, so about 0.91. The closest option is I (0.92) or perhaps a miscalculation.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate 15.9 /17.25. Let's compute 15.9 ÷17.25. Let me do that as a division: 15.9 ÷17.25.

Let me compute 17.25 * 0.9 = 15.525. Because 17.25 * 0.9 = 17.25 * 9/10 = 155.25/10 = 15.525. 15.9 is higher than that. The difference is 15.9 -15.525 = 0.375.

So 0.375 left, and since 17.25 * x = 0.375.

x = 0.375 /17.25 = 0.021739. So total is 0.9 + 0.021739 = 0.921739, approximately 0.9217. So about 0.92. So the PF is approximately 0.9217, which is about 0.92.

Looking at the options, I is 0.92. So the answer should be I. But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in the initial assumption about the readings.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the current is 0.15 A, but that's the ammeter, which is the current. But the power factor depends on the phase between voltage and current, which could be affected by other factors, but in this case, the question gives only three readings. So the meter readings are the current, voltage, and power.

So the calculation is correct: PF is 0.913, which rounds to 0.91, but the closest option is I:0.92. So the correct answer is I.

To determine the power factor of the circuit, we use the formula:

\[
\text{PF} = \frac{\text{Real Power (P)}}{\text{Apparent Power (S)}}
\]

### Given Data:
- Ammeter reading (current, \( I \)) = 0.15 A
- Volt-meter reading (voltage, \( V \)) = 115 V
- Wattmeter reading (power, \( P \)) = 15.9 W

### Step 1: Calculate Apparent Power (\( S \))
Apparent power is given by the product of voltage and current:
\[
S = V \times I = 115 \, \text{V} \times 0.15 \, \text{A} = 17.25 \, \text{VA}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Power Factor (\( \text{PF} \))
The power factor is the ratio of real power to apparent power:
\[
\text{PF} = \frac{P}{S} = \frac{15.9}{17.25}
\]

Performing the division:
\[
\text{PF} = \frac{15.9}{17.25} \approx 0.913
\]

### Step 3: Match the Result to the Options
The calculated power factor is approximately \( 0.913 \). Among the given options:
- **I: 0.92**

The closest option is **I: 0.92**, which is the best match to the calculated value.
