Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I am of opinion that the principal and true profession of the Courtier ought to be that of arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. . . .
I would have him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit a man of war; whereof I think the first should be to handle every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those weapons that are ordinarily used among gentlemen. . . .
Our Courtier then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . .
I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .
You must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .
I wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Castiglione's advice regarding a courtier. Let me break it down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

The question is asking which skill Castiglione recommends but is least valued by a modern European gentleman. The options are A to J, each with a specific skill.

First, I need to recall what the Book of the Courtier says. From the passage, I remember that Castiglione's advice includes several physical and other skills. Let me list out the key points:

1. The Courtier should be strong, bold, and loyal. So, being strong and attractive (D) is mentioned, and being well built is also highlighted.
2. He should be able to handle weapons well, both on foot and horse. That's option A.
3. He needs to be proficient in the humanities, including Latin, Greek, orators, historians, and verse/prose. That's option F.
4. He must be skilled in music, which includes reading notes and playing instruments. That's option E.
5. He should guard against being called a liar or a boaster, which is option C.
6. He needs to be versed in poets, orators, and historians, so that's option G.
7. He should be able to write poetry and prose, which is option H.
8. He should be well-versed in many kinds of weapons, which is part of option A.
9. He should be able to handle various weapons, which is similar to option A.

Looking at the options, the question is asking which of these would be least valued. So, let's think about what's important in a European gentleman at the end of the 20th century.

A modern European gentleman would probably value skills that are practical, well-rounded, and respectful. Let me go through each option:

A: Being strong and attractive. While being strong is important, being well-built might be seen as outdated or less desirable in today's context. But I'm not sure if that's the least valued.

B: Expertise with multiple languages. That's good, but maybe more important than being a musician.

C: Guarding against liars. That's a practical skill, which would be valued. But maybe not as critical as others.

D: Being bold and strong. That's about loyalty and leadership, which is important.

E: Musical proficiency. That's about music, which is a specialized skill, but I'm not sure how much that's valued compared to other areas.

F: Familiarity with poets, orators, and historians. That's about cultural knowledge, which is important.

G: Being bold and loyal. That's about integrity and service.

H: Writing poetry and prose. That's about creativity, which is attractive but perhaps not as essential as others.

Wait, but I'm supposed to choose the least valued. So, which of these is least important.

In the original passage, the Courtier's advice includes being strong, which is D. But in the modern context, maybe being well-built (J) is less important than someone focusing on being bold and loyal (G). Because a modern gentleman might prioritize leadership and integrity over physical attributes.

Alternatively, maybe being well-built is more important now than being bold. Or perhaps being strong is less important in a more relaxed social setting.

Wait, but J is being well-built, which is about strength and shape. D is being bold and strong. So, which is more important? I'm not sure. But considering that other skills like music, languages, and cultural knowledge are also important, perhaps the least valued would be the least directly mentioned.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option C is about being guard against being called a liar or boaster. That's a practical and respectful skill, so it's probably valued.

Option E is about musical proficiency. That's a specialized skill, which might be seen as important but perhaps not as crucial as others.

Option H is about writing poetry and prose, which is a creative skill, so perhaps less important than others.

Option G is about being bold and loyal, which is about integrity and service, thus important.

Option D is about being strong and attractive, but a modern gentleman might not value being overly strong.

Wait, but I'm supposed to pick the least valued. Let me think about what's not as important in a European gentleman. Maybe something like being well-built isn't as essential as others, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps being a good musician (E) is less valued than others because, while it's a good skill, it might not be as central as others. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the most important skills in the original advice are strength, loyalty, languages, etc. So, in the modern context, which of these is least valued?

Wait, looking again, the question is which skill is least valued. So the skills that are not mentioned are not as important.

Wait, the original advice includes being strong and bold, which is D. But in modern times, perhaps a more relaxed approach is taken. So, being a good musician (E) might not be as essential as others. Alternatively, being strong (D) might be less important.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

Looking for the least-valued skill. Let's see:

- Strength and beauty (D)
- Multiple languages (B)
--guard against liars (C)
- Cultural knowledge (F)
- Writing skills (H)
- Strength and loyalty (G)
- Musicians (E)
- Well-built (J)
- Weapon skills (A)
- Experts in many weapons (I), but A is a subset.

So, which of these is least valued.

In the original advice, the Courtier is recommended to be strong, bold, and loyal. So D is about being strong. But in modern times, perhaps being strong is not as crucial a trait as being loyal or noble. So if someone is strong, they might not be as important as someone who is loyal.

Alternatively, being strong might be more important than being bold.

Wait, but in the original passage, being bold and strong is a key point. A modern gentleman might not value being overly strong in that sense, as loyalty is more important.

So, perhaps D is less valued than G. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe being a good musician (E) is more important than other skills. Or perhaps being well-built (J) is more important than others.

Wait, but which one is least valued. The question is which is least valued.

In the original advice, the Courtier is recommended to be strong, but a modern person might not value strength as much.

Alternatively, perhaps being a good musician (E) is less valued than other skills.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what each option represents.

Option E is musical proficiency. That's a specialized skill. So, perhaps less central than others.

Option G is being bold and strong, which is about integrity and leadership, which is important.

Option H is writing poetry and prose. That's a creative skill, which is important.

Option J is being well-built, which is about strength and appearance.

Option D is being strong and attractive, which is about leadership and being bold.

Option F is being familiar with poets, orators, and historians. That's about cultural knowledge, which is important.

Option C is about being guard against being called a liar, which is about respect and integrity.

Option B is being able to handle multiple languages, which is important.

Option A is about weapon handling, which is practical.

Option I is experts in many kinds of weapons, which is similar to A.

So, which of these is least valued?

I think that being a good musician (E) is probably not as important as other skills. Or perhaps being strong and noble (G) is less valued.

Wait, but the question is about which is least valued. So, the answer would be the option that's the least important, i.e., the one that is not emphasized in the original advice.

Looking back, the original advice includes being strong and noble (G), being well-built (J), being strong and attractive (D), being well-versed in multiple languages (B), being skilled in music (E), and being able to handle various weapons (A).

So, the least valued would be the one that isn't mentioned. Looking at the options, option E is about music, which is not mentioned. The other options are all mentioned.

Wait, but the question is which is least valued. So, if the original advice doesn't mention E, then E is the least valued.

Alternatively, perhaps E is not as central as they think, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is which is least valued. So, perhaps the answer is E, because it's a specialized skill not mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps it's J, being well-built, because in a more relaxed setting, being well-built is not as important as other traits.

Wait, but the passage says that being a good musician is important (C), and being well-built (J) is important (G). So if a modern gentleman is being asked which is least valued, perhaps the answer is E, because in the original advice, E is about music, which is a specialized skill, and perhaps not as central as others.

Alternatively, perhaps the least valued is being a good musician because that's not as central as, say, being bold and loyal.

Wait, no, because the question is about which is least valued, not which is more important.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the original advice.

The original advice is from a 16th-century book, and the modern question is about which of the skills would be least valued. So, which skill is not as important in today's European gentleman.

A modern gentleman would probably prioritize being a good musician, because it's a specialized skill, but perhaps not as much as being noble and strong.

Wait, but the original advice mentions being strong and noble, but not being a good musician. So, perhaps E is the least valued.

Alternatively, someone might argue that being well-built is less important than being strong and noble, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, maybe being a good musician (E) is the least valued skill, as it's more specialized than other areas.

So, the answer is E.
</think>

The question asks which skill Castiglione's advice would be least valued by a modern European gentleman. The original advice emphasizes being strong, noble, and other traits, but none explicitly mention a specific skill that might be less central. However, the passage does not explicitly state that being a good musician (E) is not valued. Given that the original advice does not mention E, it is the least valued skill.

ANSWER: E
