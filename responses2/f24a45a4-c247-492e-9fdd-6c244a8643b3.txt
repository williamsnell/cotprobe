Okay, so I have this optics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The problem is about a circular aperture acting as an entrance pupil. The aperture is 1 cm in diameter. It's placed halfway between an extended light source and a lens. The lens has a 10 cm focal length and projects an image onto a screen that's 14 cm away from the lens. I need to find the diameter of the exit pupil.

Wait, right. The setup sounds like a standard lens system, maybe a simple converging lens for magnification. So, the light source is at some distance from the lens, and the image is formed on a screen that's 14 cm away. 

The lens is placed halfway between the source and the screen. So if the screen is 14 cm from the lens, then the distance from the lens to the source would be 7 cm, right? Because halfway between 7 and 14 is 10.5 cm? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the lens is 10 cm away from the source, because the lens is halfway. Wait, no, the lens is placed halfway between the source and the screen. So the total distance between the source and the lens is S, and between the lens and the screen is also S. So the total distance from source to screen is 2S. But wait, the screen is 14 cm from the lens. So 2S =14 cm. So S =7 cm. So the source is 7 cm away, the lens is 7 cm from the source, but wait no, the source is at some distance from the lens, and the lens is halfway between source and screen. So the lens is 7 cm from the source (since 14 cm is the total distance, so each side is 7 cm). So the source is 7 cm from the lens, lens is 7 cm from screen.

Wait, no. No, wait, the problem says the lens is placed halfway between the source and the screen. So the distance from source to lens is equal to the distance from lens to screen. So if the screen is 14 cm from the lens, then the source is 7 cm from the lens. So the total distance from source to screen is 14 cm (from lens to screen) plus 7 cm (from source to lens) = 21 cm. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the problem says the lens is halfway between source and screen, so the total distance from source to screen is twice the distance from source to lens. So if the screen is 14 cm from the lens, source is 14 cm on the other side? No, wait, no, that would make the distance from source to lens 7 cm, and the screen 7 cm on the other side. So total distance from source to screen is 14 cm. But the problem says the screen is 14 cm away from the lens. So the source is 7 cm behind the lens, and the screen is 14 cm behind the lens. So the distance from source to lens is 7 cm, and from lens to screen is 14 cm. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait the source is extended light, so maybe it's far away. So the setup is a converging lens, with the source at a certain distance, and the image is formed on a screen 14 cm from the lens. 

But wait, in a converging lens, the image is formed when the object is within the focal length. Because if the object is within the focal length, the image is real and inverted, but if beyond, it's real and upright. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh no, for converging lenses, if the object is beyond the focal length, the image is real and inverted. If the object is exactly at the focal length, the image is at infinity. If the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual and upright. So in this problem, the image is formed on a screen, which suggests that the image is real and inverted, so the object must be within the focal length of the lens. So the object is at a distance less than 10 cm (since the lens has a 10 cm focal length).

Wait, but the lens is 10 cm from the source. So the object is 7 cm from the lens, which is less than 10 cm. So that's correct.

Now, the question is about the exit pupil diameter. The exit pupil is the opening of the lens at the exit end. Its size depends on the size of the aperture and the magnification.

Wait, the aperture is 1 cm in diameter. The aperture is the circular opening, so the diameter is 1 cm. But wait, the problem says the aperture is 1 cm in diameter. So the exit pupil is the same as the aperture, right? Because the aperture is the entrance pupil, and the exit pupil is the opening of the lens. So if the lens is the same as the aperture, then the exit pupil would be 1 cm. But wait, perhaps the lens is a converging lens, so the aperture is at the entrance, and the lens is the same as the aperture. Hmm, I think that's the case here.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem says that the circular aperture is 1 cm in diameter, acting as the entrance pupil. So the exit pupil is the same as the aperture, because it's the same lens. So the exit pupil would be 1 cm in diameter. So the answer would be option I: 1 cm.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the question says to find the diameter of the exit pupil. If the aperture is the same as the lens, then the exit pupil is 1 cm. But maybe I'm making an incorrect assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the lens forms an image, and the exit pupil is the same as the lens's aperture, but perhaps the lens's focal length affects the size of the image, but since the problem is about the exit pupil, which is the lens's opening, the diameter should be the same as the aperture.

Wait, in reality, the exit pupil's diameter is related to the aperture, but considering that the image is formed, the magnification may affect the size. Wait, no, because the exit pupil is the size of the lens, regardless of magnification. So if the lens is 1 cm in diameter, the exit pupil is 1 cm.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh, wait, perhaps the lens is a diverging lens, but no, the problem says it's a lens projecting an image, so it's converging. Alternatively, perhaps the magnification affects the image size, but the exit pupil's diameter is determined by the lens's aperture. So the exit pupil is 1 cm.

Wait, but the options include 1 cm as option I. So why would the answer not be option I?

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. The exit pupil is the aperture of the lens, which is 1 cm in diameter. So the answer would be option I. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the problem might be considering the magnification. Or perhaps the lens is a convex lens, and the image is formed on the screen. The magnification is given by the ratio of image distance to object distance. So the magnification m is (v/u), where u is object distance and v is image distance.

In this case, u is 7 cm (source to lens), v is 14 cm (lens to screen). So m = 14/7 = 2. So the image is magnified by a factor of 2.

But how does this affect the exit pupil? I'm not sure. Because the magnification affects the size of the image, but the exit pupil's size depends on the lens's aperture. So the exit pupil remains 1 cm.

Wait, but the problem states that the lens is 10 cm focal length. Let me think about the lens formula. Maybe that's a red herring, because the exit pupil is determined by the lens's aperture, regardless of magnification.

So the exit pupil diameter is 1 cm, so option I.

The problem involves a circular aperture acting as an entrance pupil, with a diameter of 1 cm. The aperture is placed halfway between an extended light source and a lens, which has a 10 cm focal length. The lens projects an image onto a screen 14 cm away from the lens. The task is to determine the diameter of the exit pupil.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Lens Setup**:  
   - The lens is placed halfway between the source and the screen. Since the screen is 14 cm away from the lens, the source is 7 cm away from the lens.  
   - The total distance from the source to the screen is therefore 14 cm (lens to screen) + 7 cm (source to lens) = 21 cm.  

2. **Image Formation**:  
   - The lens is converging (as it has a 10 cm focal length), and the image is real and inverted, confirming that the object (source) is within the focal length of the lens (7 cm < 10 cm).  

3. **Exit Pupil**:  
   - The exit pupil is the aperture of the lens at the exit end. Its diameter is determined by the lens's aperture, not by magnification. Since the aperture is 1 cm in diameter, the exit pupil is also 1 cm in diameter.  

4. **Magnification**:  
   - The magnification factor is calculated as \( m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{14}{7} = 2 \). However, magnification affects the size of the image, not the exit pupil. The exit pupil is determined by the lens's aperture, not the magnified image.  

### Conclusion:  
The diameter of the exit pupil is directly determined by the lens's aperture, which is 1 cm. Thus, the correct answer is:
