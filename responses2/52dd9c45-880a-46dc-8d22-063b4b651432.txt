Okay, so I've got this convolution problem to solve. The question is to find f(t) convolved with g(t), where f(t) is t and g(t) is t squared. The convolution symbol is a star, so I remember that convolution is kind of like sliding one function over the other and integrating their product. 

Wait, the formula for convolution is (f ∗ g)(t) = ∫₀^t f(τ)g(t−τ) dτ. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, I think the correct formula is f ∗ g(t) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(τ) g(t - τ) dτ. But since f(t) and g(t) are both defined for t ≥ 0 (I think, because f(t) is linear and g(t) is quadratic, so they're zero for negative t), maybe it's from 0 to t. So the limits are from 0 to t. Right.

So f(t) = t, and g(t) = t^2. So the integral becomes ∫₀^t τ * (t - τ)^2 dτ. Let's expand that. 

First, (t - τ)^2 is t² - 2tτ + τ². So the integral becomes ∫₀^t τ (t² - 2tτ + τ²) dτ. Multiply τ into the terms:

t² τ - 2t τ² + τ^3. So the integral is ∫₀^t [t² τ - 2t τ² + τ^3] dτ.

Now, I'll integrate term by term.

The integral of t² τ is t² * (τ² / 2). From 0 to t, so t² * (t²/2) = t^4 / 2.

Next term: integral of (-2t) τ² is (-2t) * (τ^3 / 3). Evaluated from 0 to t gives (-2t) * (t^3 / 3) = -2t^4 / 3.

Third term: integral of τ^3 is τ^4 / 4. Evaluated from 0 to t is t^4 / 4.

Putting it all together: (t^4 / 2) - (2t^4 / 3) + (t^4 / 4). 

Now, I need to combine these fractions. Let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, and 4. The least common multiple is 12.

So convert each term:

t^4 / 2 is (6 t^4)/12.

-2t^4 /3 is (-8 t^4)/12.

t^4 /4 is (3 t^4)/12.

Adding them: (6 -8 +3) t^4 /12 = (1) t^4 /12. So that's t^4 / 12.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. Because I'm a bit confused. Did I make a mistake in the signs?

Wait, the integral is t² τ - 2t τ² + τ^3. So the first term is positive t^4/2, second term negative, third positive.

So when I put them together: (t^4/2) - (2t^4/3) + (t^4/4).

Convert to twelfths:

(6t^4/12) - (8t^4/12) + (3t^4/12)

6 -8 = -2, plus 3 = 1. So 1t^4 /12. So the result is t^4/12.

But wait, the options: option B is (t^4 /12). So that's the answer, right?

Wait, but let me think again. Did I do the convolution correctly?

Alternatively, maybe I should remember that the convolution of t and t² is a standard result. Let me think about the Fourier transform approach, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I could compute it directly.

Wait another approach: Maybe using Laplace transforms, since convolution in time domain is multiplication in Laplace. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, I can think of the convolution as integrating τ (t - τ)^2 from 0 to t.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the terms. Let me recheck the expansion.

(t - τ)^2 is t² - 2tτ + τ². Multiply by τ: t² τ - 2t τ² + τ^3. That's correct.

Integrate each term:

∫ t² τ dτ: (t²)(τ²/2) → t^4/2.

∫ -2t τ² dτ: -2t (τ^3/3) → -2t^4/3.

∫ τ^3 dτ: τ^4/4 → t^4/4.

So adding them gives t^4/2 - 2t^4/3 + t^4/4.

Wait, let me compute each term:

t^4/2 is equal to 6t^4/12.

Minus 2t^4/3 is -8t^4/12.

Plus t^4/4 is 3t^4/12.

So total: (6 -8 +3) t^4 /12 → (1) t^4 /12 → t^4/12.

So the result is t^4 /12, which is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again: because when I do the convolution, sometimes the result is t^3 / something. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the limits of integration? Oh wait, no. The limits are from 0 to t because both functions are zero before that.

Wait, another way to think about this: let's make a substitution. Let u = t - τ. When τ=0, u=t. When τ=t, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=t of (t - u) * u^2 du.

Wait, that might be easier. Let me try that.

So (f ∗ g)(t) = ∫0^t (t - u) u² du.

Expand the integrand: t u² - u^3.

Integrate term by term:

∫ t u² du = t [u^3 /3 ] from 0 to t → t*(t^3/3) = t^4 /3.

∫ -u^3 du = - [u^4 /4 ] from 0 to t → -t^4 /4.

So the total is (t^4/3) - (t^4/4) = t^4 (4 -3)/12 = t^4/12.

So same result. Therefore, the answer is t^4/12, which is option B.

To find \( f(t) \ast g(t) \), where \( f(t) = t \) and \( g(t) = t^2 \), we use the convolution formula:

\[
(f \ast g)(t) = \int_{0}^{t} f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau
\]

Substituting \( f(\tau) = \tau \) and \( g(t - \tau) = (t - \tau)^2 \), we expand \( (t - \tau)^2 \) as \( t^2 - 2t\tau + \tau^2 \). Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{t} \tau (t^2 - 2t\tau + \tau^2) \, d\tau = \int_{0}^{t} (t^2 \tau - 2t \tau^2 + \tau^3) \, d\tau
\]

Integrating term by term:

1. \( \int_{0}^{t} t^2 \tau \, d\tau = t^2 \cdot \frac{\tau^2}{2} \Big|_{0}^{t} = \frac{t^4}{2} \),
2. \( \int_{0}^{t} -2t \tau^2 \, d\tau = -2t \cdot \frac{\tau^3}{3} \Big|_{0}^{t} = -\frac{2t^4}{3} \),
3. \( \int_{0}^{t} \tau^3 \, d\tau = \frac{\tau^4}{4} \Big|_{0}^{t} = \frac{t^4}{4} \).

Combining these results:

\[
\frac{t^4}{2} - \frac{2t^4}{3} + \frac{t^4}{4}
\]

To combine the terms, find a common denominator (12):

\[
\frac{6t^4}{12} - \frac{8t^4}{12} + \frac{3t^4}{12} = \frac{(6 - 8 + 3)t^4}{12} = \frac{t^4}{12}.
\]

Thus, the convolution \( f(t) \ast g(t) \) is \( \frac{t^4}{12} \), which corresponds to option B.
