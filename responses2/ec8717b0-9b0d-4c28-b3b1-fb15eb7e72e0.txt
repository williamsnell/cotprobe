Okay, so I've got this question about the Address Resolution Protocol, orARP, which is one of the IP suite protocols. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the IP suite has several protocols like ARP, IPsec, and IP sec. So, let me think about what each one does. I know ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It's used to find the corresponding host address on a network when you're given a local IP address and a host name. Wait, or is it the other way around? I think it's the former.

So, the function of ARP is to convert a network address (like a host name) into a host-by-part address. Like, if you have a host address, say 192.168.1.5, and you have a local IP address, say 192.168.1.255, ARP would tell you which host on the network that local IP is pointing to. So, in this case, it would be the host named 192.168.1.5.

Looking at the options, option A is "To determine the host name of a given hardware address." That sounds right because if you have a hardware address (like 192.168.1.5), ARP would find the corresponding host. So, A seems correct.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option B talks about translating Web addresses to host names. That doesn't make sense because ARP is about converting host names to IP addresses. So B is incorrect.

Option C says it's for determining the IP address of a hardware address. That's not right because ARP doesn't produce an IP address; it produces a host address. So C is incorrect.

Option D is about translating hardware addresses to IP. No, that's the other way around.ARP converts host names to IPs. So D is wrong.

Option E: To determine the hardware address of a given IP. That would be the reverse of what ARP does. So E is incorrect.

Option F: To translate IP to host names. Oh, wait, that's the function of the IPsec protocol, perhaps. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: IPsec uses the IP address to create a secure tunnel and then translates the IP into host names. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, actually, no. IPsec uses the host address to translate the IP address. Or maybe I have that wrong. Let me think again: In a traditional tunnel, the local IP and the host's IP are translated. So for example, if the local IP is 192.168.1.255 and the host is 192.168.1.5, then the host IP is 192.168.1.5. So, the IPsec is about creating a secure connection, and the translation would involve the host address being used to create a key, and the IP address being used for the tunnel. So F's description of translating IP to host names is part of IPsec's process, but is F the correct answer for the question? The question is about ARP, so F isn't about ARP.

Option G: To determine the host name of a given IP address. Wait, wait, no. That's the opposite. If you have an IP, like 192.168.1.5, and you want to know the host name, that's what ARP does. So G would be wrong because it's the host name to IP address.

Option H: To translate host names to Web addresses. That's not about ARP. ARP is about IP addresses to host names.

Option I: To determine the IP address of a given host name. Wait, if you have a host name, that's the function of the IPsec protocol, perhaps. No, I'm getting stuck. Let me make a table.

 ARP's purpose: Convert a host name to an IP address. So options A and I are opposite.

So for the question, the correct answer is A. Let me just make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Another way to think: ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. So what does it do? It takes a network address (like a host name) and converts it to the corresponding IP address on the network. So the purpose is to find the physical address of the host given its name. So the correct answer is A.
</think>

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to convert a network address (like a host name) into a host-by-part address. It determines the IP address of a given hardware address. 

The correct answer is **A: To determine the host name of a given hardware address**.

Answer: A
