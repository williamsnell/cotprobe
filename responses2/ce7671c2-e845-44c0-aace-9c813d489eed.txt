Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember the photoelectric effect involves electrons being emitted from a material when light of a certain frequency is shone on it. The question is about finding the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons when magnesium is irradiated with ultraviolet light of a specific frequency.

Wait, the problem says the work function φ of magnesium is 3.7 eV. Oh right, the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal. So if the energy of the incoming photon is just enough to overcome this, the photoelectrons won't be emitted, right? But when it's higher, they are.

The light's frequency is given as 1.5 × 10^15 seconds^-1. Oh wait, that's nanometers? No, wait, the frequency is in Hz, which is per second. So I think I need to calculate the energy of the photon using the equation E = hν, where h is Planck's constant.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the constants I should use. I remember Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But also, I think the speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s, and the electron charge e is 1.6e-19 coulombs.

Wait, but since the work function is given in electron volts, maybe it's easier to use eV units. Oh right, because 1 eV equals 1.6e-19 joules. Oh, right, but in calculations, sometimes people use h = 4.135667696e-15 eV·s, which is h in eV seconds. That might make the calculation easier.

So the energy of the photon E = hν. Let me calculate that.

Wait, the frequency ν is given as 1.5e15 s^-1. So ν = 1.5e15 Hz.

h is approximately 4.1357e-15 eV·s.

So E = h * ν = 4.1357e-15 eV·s * 1.5e15 Hz = let's compute that.

4.1357e-15 * 1.5e15 = 4.1357 * 1.5 since the exponents cancel (e15 * e-15 = e0=1) so 4.1357 * 1.5 is about 6.20355 eV. So E ≈6.2035 eV.

Wait, but wait, the work function is 3.7 eV. So the maximum kinetic energy K_max is E_photon - φ.

So K_max = 6.2035 - 3.7 = 2.5035 eV. So approximately 2.5 eV.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.5 eV. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I get the formula wrong. The photoelectric effect equation is K_max = hν - φ. Yes, that's correct. So if the photon energy is higher than the work function, then the maximum kinetic energy is positive. If the photon energy is less than the work function, no electrons are emitted.

So in this case, 6.2 eV is more than 3.7 eV, so electrons are emitted. So K_max is 6.2 -3.7=2.5 eV. So option J is correct.

To determine the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons ejected from magnesium when irradiated by ultraviolet light, we use the photoelectric effect equation:

\[
K_{\text{max}} = h\nu - \phi
\]

where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 4.1357 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \)),
- \( \nu \) is the frequency of the incident light (\( 1.5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{Hz} \)),
- \( \phi \) is the work function of magnesium (\( 3.7 \, \text{eV} \)).

First, calculate the energy of the photon using \( E = h\nu \):
\[
E = (4.1357 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s}) \times (1.5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{Hz}) = 6.2035 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Next, subtract the work function to find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons:
\[
K_{\text{max}} = 6.2035 \, \text{eV} - 3.7 \, \text{eV} = 2.5035 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the maximum kinetic energy is approximately \( 2.5 \, \text{eV} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 2.5 eV.**
