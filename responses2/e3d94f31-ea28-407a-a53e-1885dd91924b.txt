Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because percentages can sometimes trip me up. Let me take it step by step. The question is asking me to find 4 and 3/4 percent of $24.85. Hmmm, okay, so first, I need to understand what 4 3/4 percent means. I know that 4 and 3/4 is the same as 4.75 in decimal form. So, 4.75% is the percentage I'm dealing with.

Now, I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by that number. So, I think the formula is (percentage as decimal) multiplied by the total amount. Let me write that down: (4.75%) * $24.85.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused about the order—like is it (4.75% of 24.85) or 24.85% of 4.75%. Oh, no, the question specifies "4 (3/4) % of $24.85", so it's 4.75% of 24.85. So I should use the first case.

So, first, I'll convert 4.75% to a decimal. To do that, I divide by 100. So, 4.75 divided by 100. Let me calculate that: 4.75 / 100 = 0.0475. Okay, now I have the decimal form: 0.0475.

Next step: multiply this by $24.85. Let's do that. So, 24.85 * 0.0475. Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. I think I should break this down. Maybe multiply 24.85 by 0.04 first, and then handle the 0.0075.

Wait, 0.04 is like 4%, so 24.85 * 0.04. Let me compute that. 24 * 0.04 is 0.96, and 0.85 * 0.04 is 0.034. Adding those together: 0.96 + 0.034 = 0.994. So that's 24.85 * 0.04 = 0.994.

But wait, the actual multiplier is 0.0475, which is 0.04 + 0.0075. So I need to add that to the previous result. So, 0.994 + (24.85 * 0.0075). Let's compute 24.85 * 0.0075.

Hmm, 24.85 * 0.007 is 0.174, because 0.007 * 24 is 0.168, and 0.007 * 0.85 is 0.00595. Adding them gives 0.168 + 0.00595 = 0.17395. Then, 24.85 * 0.0005 is 0.012425. So adding those two: 0.17395 + 0.012425 = 0.186375.

Wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to multiply 24.85 by 0.0075. Let's do that step by step.

0.0075 is the same as 75/10000. So, 24.85 * 75 = ?

Let me compute 24.85 * 75. Hmm, 24 * 75 is 1800. 0.85 * 75 is 63.75. So, 1800 + 63.75 = 1863.75. Now, since it's 75/10000, I divide by 10000. So 1863.75 / 10000 = 0.186375. Right, that's the same as before.

So adding that to the previous part, 0.994 + 0.186375 = 1.180375.

Wait, that's the total. So, 24.85 * 0.0475 = 1.180375. But wait, I thought earlier that 4.75% of 24.85 would be around 1.18. Let me check if I made any calculation errors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute 24.85 multiplied by 0.0475 directly.

Alternatively, maybe using decimal multiplication:

24.85
x 0.0475
------------

Let me line them up. So, 24.85 has four decimal places (since it's to the hundredth). 0.0475 has four decimal places as well. So, multiply as if they were whole numbers, then adjust the decimal point.

But that might take longer. Alternatively, perhaps I can do it step by step:

0.0475 is equal to 0.04 + 0.0075. So, as I did before, 24.85 * 0.04 = 0.994, and 24.85 * 0.0075 = 0.186375. Adding them gives 1.180375.

Wait, but 1.180375 is approximately 1.18. So, the answer is about $1.18. Let me look at the options. 

Looking back, the options are:

A: $1.50
B: $1.10
C: $0.99
D: $1.25
E: $1.35
F: $1.18
G: $1.00
H: $0.93
I: $1.20
J: $1.05

So, option F is $1.18. That seems to match my calculation. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with percentages, especially with money, it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, another way to compute this: 4.75% of 24.85. Alternatively, since 1% of 24.85 is 0.2485, then 4% is 0.2485 *4 = 0.994. Then, 0.75% is half of that (since 0.5% is 0.12425, but wait, 0.75% is 0.75 * 0.01, which is 0.0075 *24.85= 0.186375. So adding 0.994 + 0.186375 gives 1.180375, which is $1.180375, approximately $1.18.

So, the correct answer should be option F: $1.18.

Wait, but wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-express 4 3/4%. 3/4 is 0.75, so 4.75%. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express 4 3/4% as a decimal. 4 is 4, 3/4 is 0.75, so together 4.75%. So that's correct.

Another way to compute 4.75% of 24.85: 24.85 multiplied by 0.0475. 

Let me do this multiplication more carefully.

24.85
× 0.0475
------------

I'll compute this step by step. Let's break it down into parts.

First, 24.85 × 0.0001 = 0.002485

But perhaps it's easier to compute 24.85 × 0.0475 as follows:

0.0475 = 475/10000.

So, 24.85 × 475 = ?

Wait, perhaps that's not easier. Alternatively, maybe compute 24.85 × 0.0475 by breaking it into 0.04 + 0.0075.

So, 24.85 × 0.04 is 0.994, as before.

Then, 24.85 × 0.0075. Let's compute that.

0.0075 = 75/10000.

So, 24.85 × 75 = ?

24.85 × 75:
= 24.85 × (70 + 5)
= 24.85 *70 = 24.85 ×7 *10 = 173.95 ×10 = 1739.5
24.85 ×5 = 124.25
Adding them together: 1739.5 + 124.25 = 1863.75
Now, since it's 75/10000, the result is 1863.75 / 10000 = 0.186375.

So, adding 0.994 and 0.186375 gives 1.180375, which is $1.180375. Rounding to the nearest cent, that's $1.18.

So, the correct answer is F: $1.18.
</think>

To find 4 3/4% of $24.85, first convert 4 3/4% to a decimal, which is 4.75%. Then, multiply $24.85 by 0.0475:

\[
24.85 \times 0.0475 = 1.180375
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent gives $1.18. 

**Answer: F: $1.18**

The correct answer is option F.
