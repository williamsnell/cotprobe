Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. The question is about finding the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-sided polygon, also known as a decagon. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 1 to 10. 

Hmm, let's think about convex polygons first. A convex polygon has all its interior angles less than 180 degrees, and none of the sides bend inwards. So, each angle must be greater than 0 and less than 180. Now, an acute angle is one that's less than 90 degrees. So the question is, what's the maximum number of angles that can be less than 90 in such a polygon.

I remember that for a polygon to be convex, the sum of its interior angles can be calculated using the formula (n-2)*180, where n is the number of sides. For a decagon (n=10), that's (10-2)*180 = 8*180 = 1440 degrees. So, all angles add up to 1440.

Now, if we're trying to maximize the number of acute angles, let's say we have k acute angles. Each of these would be less than 90. The remaining (10 - k) angles would be at least 90 degrees but less than 180. Or wait, actually, in a convex polygon, each angle must be less than 180. So, the remaining angles must be between 90 and 180 degrees.

Wait, no. Since it's convex, each interior angle is less than 180. So, the other angles can be 90 to less than 180. For maximum number of acute angles, we want as many as possible to be just under 90, and the rest to be as large as possible without exceeding 180.

But we also need to make sure that the sum of all angles is 1440. So, if we have k angles that are acute (each less than 90), and the remaining (10 - k) angles must be at least 90 and less than 180.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal sum that the other angles can contribute. Because if we have more acute angles, the other angles have to compensate to reach the total sum of 1440.

So, let's model this.

Let’s denote the number of acute angles as k. Each of these angles is less than 90. Let's assume each is just under 90, say 90 - ε, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, to find the minimal sum contributed by the non-acute angles, we can set them to the smallest possible value, which would be just over 90 degrees (since they can't be 90 or lower if we're considering acute). Wait, no. Wait, wait—actually, if the non-acute angles are as small as possible, that would allow the acute angles to take up less of the total sum, but we have to see if that's possible.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the minimal sum required for the non-acute angles. Since each of the non-acute angles can be as low as just over 90 degrees, their minimal sum would be (10 - k) * 90 degrees. But wait, that's not right. Because each angle must be strictly greater than 90 to be non-acute. Wait, no—if we're considering the non-acute angles as being at least 90, but in reality, they can be up to 180.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. The problem is that each non-acute angle (i.e., angles >=90) must be less than 180. So, to maximize the number of acute angles, we need to minimize the sum contributed by the non-acute angles. Because if the non-acute angles contribute as little as possible, then the total sum can be achieved with fewer acute angles.

Wait, no. Let me think: If I have k acute angles, each less than 90. The remaining (10 -k) angles must be each less than 180. To minimize the sum of these (10 -k) angles, I'd set them to the smallest possible value, which is just above 90, since they can't be 90 or lower. Because if any of them is 90 or lower, they would be non-acute, which is not allowed since we're trying to maximize the number of acute ones.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Actually, to have maximum acute angles, the other angles must be as small as possible, but they can't be 90 or lower. So, they must be greater than 90. So, the minimal sum for the non-acute angles is (10 -k) * 90. Because each can't be 90 or lower, so the smallest they can be is just over 90. So, for them to just meet the minimum, each is 90, but they can't be 90. So, to model this, each non-acute angle contributes just over 90 degrees, but for the sake of calculation, let's assume they are 90 degrees. Then, the total sum contributed by them would be (10 -k)*90 degrees.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about it again. Because each non-acute angle has to be less than 180. So, the minimal sum for the non-acute angles is (10 -k)*90, since each is just over 90, but in the worst case, they could be 90, but they can't be 90. So, to find the minimal sum, we can set them to 90, but if any angle is exactly 90, it's considered non-acute. So, to ensure all non-acute angles are greater than 90, the minimal sum would be slightly more than (10 -k)*90. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal total sum from the non-acute angles. But perhaps I should consider the maximum possible sum of the acute angles and the minimum possible sum of the other angles to see if the total can reach 1440.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to find the minimal sum of the non-acute angles, which would occur when each of them is just above 90, but that's not the way. Alternatively, perhaps I should set the non-acute angles to just above 90, so their sum is just above (10 -k)*90. Then, the sum of the acute angles must be less than 90k. So, the total sum is less than 90k + (10 -k)*90 = 90k + 90*(10 -k) = 900.

Wait, but the total sum has to be exactly 1440. So, 90k + (non-acute sum) = 1440 → non-acute sum = 1440 - 90k.

But the non-acute sum must be less than (10 -k)*180, because each angle is less than 180. So:

1440 - 90k < (10 -k)*180.

Let me write that inequality:

1440 - 90k < 180*(10 -k)

1440 -90k < 1800 - 180k

Bring all terms to one side:

-90k + 180k < 1800 - 1440

90k < 360

So, k < 4.

Wait, that's interesting. So, k is less than 4. So, the maximum integer value of k is 3. Because if k=4, then 90*4=360, 180*(10-4)=1080. 1440-360=1080. So 1080 is equal to 180*(10-4). So, in that case, the non-acute angles sum to exactly 1080, which is 180*(6), and each non-acute angle is 180. But wait, in a convex polygon, each angle must be less than 180. So, that's not possible. Hence, k must be less than 4. So, the maximum number is 3.

Wait, so that would mean the answer is 3, option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me plug k=3 into the inequality.

If k=3:

Non-acute sum = 1440 - 90*3 = 1440 - 270 = 1170.

Number of non-acute angles is 10 -3 =7.

Each can be at most just under 180. So, 7 angles each at 180 would give 1260, which is way more than 1170. But wait, that can't be right because 7 angles each at 180 sum to 1260, but we have 1170. So, perhaps in reality, each of the 7 non-acute angles is 1170/7 = about 167.14 degrees. That's less than 180, so that's acceptable. So, yes, k=3 is possible.

But what about k=4?

If k=4:

Non-acute sum = 1440 - 90*4 = 1440-360=1080.

Number of non-acute angles is 6.

Each non-acute angle is 1080/6=180 degrees. But in a convex polygon, each angle must be less than 180, so each can't be 180. So, that's impossible. Hence, the maximum k is 3.

So, the maximum number is 3 acute angles, which is option A.
</think>

The maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is found by ensuring the sum of all interior angles (1440 degrees) is achieved with the minimal contribution from the non-acute angles. For k acute angles, each less than 90 degrees, and the remaining (10 - k) angles each less than 180 degrees, the sum of non-acute angles must be 1440 - 90k. This must be less than (10 -k)*180. Solving for k gives k < 4. Thus, the maximum number is 3.
