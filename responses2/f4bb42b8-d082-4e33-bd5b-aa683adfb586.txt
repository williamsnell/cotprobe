Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about finding a recursion equation for y[n], which is the sum of the squares of all integers from 0 to n. Hmm, I remember that the sum of squares formula is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Let me think about how to derive this using recursion.

So, the problem is asking which recursion equation correctly defines y[n]. Let's look at the options.

Option B says y[n] = (n(n+1)(2n+1))/6 for n >=0. That's the well-known formula. But the question is about a recursion, not a closed-form. So maybe B isn't the answer we're looking for because it's a closed-form, not a recursion.

Option G is y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n -1. Let's see. If I take y[n-1], that's the sum up to n-1, and adding 2n-1 would give the next term. Because the next term is n^2. So, for example, when n=1: y[1] should be 0 + 1^2 = 1. Let's see, if I use G's formula: y[0] is 0, so 0 + 2*1 -1 = 1. That works. Similarly, for n=2: y[2] = y[1] + 2*2 -1 = 1 +4-1=4. But wait, the actual sum up to 2 is 0+1+4=5. Oh wait, that doesn't add up. So maybe option G isn't correct. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the sum up to n is y[n], and the next term is y[n] + n^2. So if y[n] = y[n-1] + n^2, that would be correct only if y[n-1] is the sum up to n-1, and adding n^2 gives the sum up to n. So perhaps G's equation is correct. Let me check again. For n=0: y[0]=0. For n=1: y[1] = y[0] + 1^2 = 1. For n=2: y[2] = y[1] + 2^2 = 1 +4=5. But wait, the actual sum up to 2 is 0+1+4=5. Oh, right, that's correct. So G's equation is correct? Then why the options have other options.

Wait, wait, another option: option E is y[n+1] = 2y[n] + (n+1)^2. Hmm, let's see. For n=0: y[1] = 2*0 +1^2=1. But according to the actual sum for y[1], it's 1. So that's correct. What about y[2]? According to E: y[2] = 2y[1] + (2)^2 = 2*1 +4=6. But the actual sum up to 2 is 0+1+4=5. So that's not matching. So E isn't correct.

Option F is y[n-1] = y[n] - n^2 for n>=1 with y[0]=0. Wait, if I take y[n] = y[n-1] + n^2, that's the same as option G. So G and F are similar but written in opposite directions. Let me see: option F says y[n-1] = y[n] -n^2, which would imply y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2. So F is the same as G. But I thought they might not have the same. Wait, perhaps G is correct, but F is the correct recursion equation. Wait, but the question is asking for a recursion equation, so which one is correct.

Let me think about each option.

Option G is y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n -1. Let's compute for n=1: 2(1)-1=1, so y[1]=1. Correct. For n=2: 2(2)-1=3. So y[2]=1+3=4. Which matches 0+1+4=5? Wait, no, wait, 0+1+4=5. Wait, y[2] should be 5, but according to G, it's 4. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the actual sum up to n is y[n]. So y[2] is 0 +1 +4=5. But according to G, y[2] would be y[1] + 2*2-1. y[1] is 1, so 1 + 3=4. That's not matching. So perhaps G isn't correct.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake. So I should find which recursion is correct.

Option B is the closed-form. So the question is about a recursion. So perhaps the correct recursion is y[n] = y[n-1] + n^2.

Wait, let's see: if I take y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2, then for n=0: y[0]=0. n=1: 0+1=1. n=2:1+4=5. Which matches the actual sum. So that's correct.

So option G says y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n -1, which, for n=1, gives 2(1)-1=1, which is correct. For n=2, 2*2-1=3. So y[2] = y[1] +3=4. But actual sum is 5. So that's a discrepancy. So option G is incorrect.

Wait, but then what about option E? Let's check E: y[n+1] = 2y[n] + (n+1)^2. Let's compute for n=0: y[1] = 2*0 +1^2=1. Which is correct. For n=1: y[2] = 2*1 + (2)^2= 2 +4=6. But the actual sum is 5. So E is wrong.

So the correct recursion is y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2.

Looking at the options, option B is the closed-form, not a recursion. So the other options are the recursions.

Wait, looking at option G, which says y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n -1. For n=1, that's 1, correct. For n=2, 2*2-1=3 → y[2]=4, but correct sum is 5. So it's wrong. So option G is incorrect.

Option F says y[n-1] = y[n] -n^2, which is same as y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2. So F is correct.

So the question is asking for a recursion equation. So option G is y[n] = y[n-1] +2n-1, which for n=2 gives 4, but actual sum is 5. So it's incorrect.

Wait, but let's check the other options again.

Option H: y[n+1] = y[n] - (n+1)^2. For n=0: y[1] = y[0] -1= -1. But y[1] should be 1. So that's wrong.

Option D: y[n-1] = y[n]/n^2 → which would be y[n] = y[n-1] *n^2. Let's see for n=1: y[0] =0 → y[1] =0*1=0, but actual y[1] is 1. So incorrect.

Option C: y[n-1] = y[n] *n^2 → same as y[n] = y[n-1]/n^2. For n=1: y[0] =0 → y[1]=0/1=0. But correct is 1. So incorrect.

Option A: y[n-1] = y[n] +n^2. That would mean y[n] = y[n-1] -n^2. But for n=1, y[0] =0 → y[1] = 0 -1= -1, which is wrong.

So, among all options, option G is incorrect, and option F is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option G is incorrect because for n=2, the sum is 5, but according to G, it's 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating. Let me recalculate.

y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n -1.

n=0: y[0]=0.

n=1: y[1] = y[0] + 2(1)-1 =0 +2-1=1.

n=2: y[2]= y[1] +2(2)-1=1+4-1=4.

But the actual sum is y[2] =0+1+4=5. So option G's recursion gives y[2]=4, which is less than the correct sum. So option G is wrong.

Wait, but then which option is correct? Because all options except G seem incorrect. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should think about the sum. The sum of squares up to n is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

So the recursion should be y[n] = y[n-1] + n^2. So that's the correct recursion.

Looking at the options, option G is y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n-1. That's not the same as adding n². So option G is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct recursion is not listed in the options except B, which is closed-form. But the question asks for a recursion.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: suppose the recursion is y[n] = y[n-1] +n².

Which of the options is this?

Option G says y[n] = y[n-1] +2n-1. So no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I missed an option. Let me check.

Wait, the options are:

Option G: y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n-1; n >=1 y[0]=0.

So for n=1, you get 1, correct.

n=2: 1 +3=4. But the correct sum is 5. So this is incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps none of the options except B are correct. But the question is about a recursion, so perhaps the correct recursion isn't present, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum up to 2 for each option.

Option G: sum is 0 +1 + (sum at n=2 is y[2] =4. So the actual sum is 0+1+4=5. So y[2] is 4, which is incorrect.

So option G isn't correct.

So perhaps the correct recursion is not given, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Another approach: what is the correct recursion? It's y[n] = y[n-1] + n². So which option matches this?

Looking at the options, option G is y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n-1. So that's the same as adding 2n-1 each step, which is not adding n². So option G is wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute y[2] using option G:

y[1] =1, y[2] =1 + 2*2-1=1 +3=4. Correct sum is 5. So option G is incorrect.

So the correct recursion isn't among the options except B, which is the closed-form. Wait, but the question is about a recursion equation. So perhaps the answer is option G, but my calculations show it's incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for a different type of recursion. Let me think about the relation between consecutive terms.

The sum y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2. So that's a simple recursion. None of the options except G and F are correct in that.

Wait, perhaps the option G is a different way of expressing the same thing. Let me check.

Option G: y[n] = y[n-1] +2n-1. Which is y[n] = y[n-1] + (2n-1). So for n=1, that's 1, correct. For n=2, 1 +3=4. But actual sum is 5. So option G is wrong.

So the correct recursion is y[n] = y[n-1] +n². So none of the options except B is correct, but B is the closed-form. So perhaps the question is only about the recursion, not the closed-form.

Wait, the question is asking to find a recursion equation. So which option gives a recursion (i.e., defines y[n] in terms of previous terms).

Looking back, option G is y[n] = y[n-1] +2n-1. So for n=1, it gives 1, correct. But for n=2, it gives 4, but the correct sum is 5. So option G is incorrect.

Wait, so none of the options (except B, which is a closed-form) give the correct recursion.

But looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the sum of squares formula.

The sum up to n is y[n] = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

Suppose I want to express y[n] in terms of y[n-1]. So y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2.

But none of the options except G and F are y[n] = y[n-1] + ... .

Wait, option F is y[n-1] = y[n] -n^2 → which is the same as y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2. So option F is correct.

So perhaps option F is the correct recursion equation, despite the earlier confusion.

Wait, but earlier when I used option G for n=2, it gave y[2]=4, which is less than the actual sum of 5. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate option G's y[2].

Option G: y[n] = y[n-1] +2n-1.

n=0 → y[0]=0.

n=1: y[1] =0 +2(1)-1=1 → correct.

n=2: y[2] =1 +2(2)-1=1 +3=4 → which is less than the actual sum 5. So that's incorrect.

So option G is wrong. So the correct recursion is option F.

But wait, option F is y[n-1] = y[n] -n^2. Which rearranges to y[n] = y[n-1] +n^2. So option F is correct.

So the correct recursion is option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought option G is correct, but it's not. So the correct answer is option G? No, because y[2] would be 4, but actual sum is 5. So option G is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of each option again.

Option B is the closed-form, so not a recursion.

Option G: y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n-1 → for n=1, 2(1)-1=1, correct for y[1]=1. For n=2, 2(2)-1=3 → y[2]=4, which is incorrect. So option G is wrong.

Option F: y[n-1] = y[n] -n² → y[n] = y[n-1] +n². So for n=1, y[1] = y[0] +1=1. Correct. For n=2, y[2]=y[1] +4=5. Correct. So option F is correct.

Option H: y[n+1] = y[n] - (n+1)^2 → which would mean y[n] = y[n+1] + (n+1)^2. Not correct for the recursion.

Option D: y[n-1] = y[n]/(n)^2 → y[n] = y[n-1] *n². For n=1, y[1]= y[0]*1=0 → wrong.

So the correct recursion is option F.

Wait, but the options are:

F: y [n-1] = y [n] -n^2; n>=1 where y [0] =0

So yes, option F's equation is correct.

To determine the correct recursion equation for \( y[n] \), where \( y[n] \) is the sum of the squares of all integers from 0 to \( n \), we analyze each option systematically.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option B**: This provides the closed-form formula for \( y[n] \), which is \( y[n] = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \). Since the question asks for a recursion equation, this is not the correct answer.

2. **Option G**: The recursion equation states \( y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n - 1 \). Testing this:
   - For \( n = 1 \), \( y[1] = y[0] + 2(1) - 1 = 0 + 2 - 1 = 1 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 2 \), \( y[2] = y[1] + 2(2) - 1 = 1 + 4 - 1 = 4 \), but the actual sum is \( 0 + 1 + 4 = 5 \). This discrepancy shows that **Option G is incorrect**.

3. **Option F**: The equation states \( y[n-1] = y[n] - n^2 \), which can be rearranged to \( y[n] = y[n-1] + n^2 \). Testing this:
   - For \( n = 1 \), \( y[1] = y[0] + 1^2 = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 2 \), \( y[2] = y[1] + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \), which matches the actual sum. This shows that **Option F is correct**.

4. **Option H**: The equation states \( y[n+1] = y[n] - (n+1)^2 \), which rearranges to \( y[n] = y[n+1] + (n+1)^2 \). This is not a correct recursion equation.

5. **Option D**: The equation states \( y[n-1] = y[n]/n^2 \), which rearranges to \( y[n] = y[n-1] \cdot n^2 \). Testing this:
   - For \( n = 1 \), \( y[1] = y[0] \cdot 1^2 = 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \), which is incorrect since \( y[1] = 1 \).

### Conclusion:
The correct recursion equation is **Option F**, as it accurately defines \( y[n] \) in terms of \( y[n-1] \) and satisfies the condition \( y[0] = 0 \).
