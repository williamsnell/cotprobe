Okay, so I have this question about therapy and how Dr. Lykowski should handle his feelings after seeing his client three times. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that after seeing his client three times, he's feeling hostile because the client reminds him of his wife who's being divorcee. The options are various ways to handle this situation. Hmm, I think I remember that when a client goes through this kind of situation, it's important to assess the situation first.

So, the client is reminding Dr. Lykowski about his wife's divorce. That probably makes him feel a mix of emotions—confusion, anger, maybe even some resentment. But how does that affect his approach?

Looking at the options: Option A suggests consulting another psychologist. That could be a way to assess if the client's issues are valid or if it's just a phase. But I'm not sure if that's the best immediate action.

Option B is seeking personal therapy. That might be a good step because if the client is feeling hostile and the reason is not clear, a personal therapist could help him understand and address his feelings better.

Option C involves referring to another therapist. But why would that help? Maybe if the reason is not about the client, referring elsewhere could lead to more confusion.

Option D says he should recognize it's due to countertransference and continue. Countertransference is when the client feels the therapist's words make them uncomfortable or hurt. If that's the case, stopping the therapy might help, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Option E is expressing hostility in the session. That might reduce the client's feelings, but I'm not sure if that's the best step without addressing the root cause.

Option F is terminating sessions. That seems drastic and might prevent the client from gaining the necessary support. It could lead to more problems, like feeling worse.

Option G is discussing personal issues with the client to create transparency. That's a good idea because it could help clarify why the client feels that way. If he's aware of his personal situation, he might feel better.

Option H is ignoring feelings. That's probably not the best approach because ignoring could make things worse and prevent the client from getting the help they need.

Option I is referring the client to another therapist without explaining. That might not address the underlying issue, leading to more frustration.

Option J is asking the client to find another therapist without a reason. That seems less effective because it doesn't provide any direction, and the client might still stay unresolved.

So, putting it together: The client is feeling hostile because of the divorce. He needs to figure out why he's feeling that way. If the reason is not clear, seeking personal therapy (option B) might be the best immediate step. Alternatively, discussing his personal situation (option G) could also help. But the question is about his best course of action. So, perhaps option B is the immediate next step because it's a direct way to help the client manage his feelings.
