Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychotherapy approaches, specifically comparing traditional and culturally sensitive approaches. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking what perspective culturally sensitive approaches adopt. The options are A through J. I remember that in psychology, there are terms like 'endogenous' and 'exogenous' which relate to how we view the cause and effect in a system. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions here.

Let me think. Traditional psychotherapy often focuses on the client's subjective experience. So it's more about their own feelings and emotions. This is probably an endogenous perspective because it's internal. 

On the other hand, culturally sensitive approaches consider the client's cultural background. That would mean looking at how the client's environment affects their experiences, which is an external perspective. So maybe the answer is 'exogenous' because it's about the external factors influencing the client.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Endogenous is internal, exogenous is external. So if a therapy approach is looking at the client's experience from their cultural context, it's using an external viewpoint. So the correct term would be 'exogenous' since it relates to the external aspects influencing the client's experience.

Looking back at the options, option G is 'emic' and option E is 'eugenic'. Hmm. Oh wait, 'emic' refers to something that is part of the system, like a component, and 'eugenic' is about genetic selection. Those don't seem relevant here.

So the correct answer should be 'exogenous' which is option G. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard 'exogenous' used interchangeably with 'endogenous' in different contexts. Let me make sure I'm not mixing them up. 

Wait a second, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think about the terms again. In psychology, 'endogenous' refers to internal factors, while 'exogenous' refers to external. So, if a therapy is culturally sensitive, it's using an external perspective to understand the client's experience, which would be exogenous. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes I've heard 'exogenous' and 'endogenous' used in different contexts. Oh, perhaps in this case, the question is testing the understanding of which term refers to the perspective the approach takes. So if traditional approaches are endogenous (internal), then culturally sensitive approaches would be exogenous (external), because they're looking at how the client's environment affects their experience.

Alternatively, some sources might refer to 'exogenous' as the external approach, so that's probably the correct term.

The question asks for the perspective that culturally sensitive approaches adopt. Traditional psychotherapy is considered an endogenous approach, focusing on the client's internal experience. Conversely, culturally sensitive approaches examine the external factors influencing the client's experience, making them an exogenous perspective.

ANSWER: G
