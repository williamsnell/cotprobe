Okay, so I've got this question here about how many $100 bills make up one million dollars. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I know that a $100 bill is one hundred dollars. The question is asking how many of these make a million. So, I guess I need to figure out what number multiplied by 100 equals 1,000,000.

Let me write that down as a math equation. Let's call the number of $100 bills 'n'. So, n multiplied by 100 equals 1,000,000. That would be n * 100 = 1,000,000.

To find n, I can divide both sides of the equation by 100. So, n = 1,000,000 / 100. Let me calculate that. 1,000,000 divided by 100. Well, 100 goes into 1,000 ten times, so 100 goes into 1,000,000 a thousand times. Wait, no, wait, 100 goes into 100 once, so 100 into 1,000,000 would be ten thousand times. Because 100 times 10,000 is 1,000,000. So, n is 10,000.

Now, looking at the options provided, I need to see which one is 10,000. Let's check each option:

A: five hundred thousand → 500,000. That's way too big.
B: five thousand → 5,000. No, that's less than 10,000.
C: two thousand → 2,000. Nope, still too small.
D: one hundred thousand → 100,000. That's closer, but still not 10,000.
E: one thousand → 1,000. No.
F: fifty thousand → 50,000. Closer, but not 10,000.
G: twenty thousand → 20,000. No.
H: one hundred → 100. No.
I: one million → 1,000,000. That's way too big.
J: ten thousand → 10,000. Oh, that's exactly what I calculated.

So the correct answer should be J: ten thousand.

The correct answer is J: ten thousand.
