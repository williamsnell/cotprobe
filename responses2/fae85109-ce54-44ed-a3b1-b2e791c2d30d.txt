Okay, so I've got this question here about Bella's photos. Let me read it again. It says, "All of Bella’s photos are in 8 photo books. Each photo book has 25 photos. Which expression shows how to find the total number of photos Bella has?" Then there are several options from A to J.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, Bella has multiple photo books, right? And each of those books has a certain number of photos. The question is about finding the total number of photos she has altogether.

Wait, so if there are 8 photo books and each has 25 photos, I need to multiply the number of books by the number of photos per book. That makes sense because each book contributes 25 photos, and there are 8 books. So the total would be 8 multiplied by 25.

Looking at the options, option A is 25 × 8. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. Let me check the other options to make sure. Option B is 8 + 25. That's adding them, which doesn't make sense because each book has 25, and she has 8 of them. Adding would give a smaller number than expected.

Option C is 25 + 25. That’s just adding two of the books, not all eight. So that's too low.

Option D is 25 × 25. That would be 625, which seems way too high. Each book only has 25, and she has 8, so 8×25 is 200, which is the right amount.

Option E is 8 – 25. That would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Option F is 25 – 8. That would be 17, which is also way too low.

Option G is 25 + 8. That's 33, which is definitely not right.

Option H is 8 ÷ 25. That's 0.32, which is a fraction, but we’re dealing with whole photo counts here.

Option I is 25 ÷ 8. That's 3.125, which isn't a whole number and doesn't apply here.

Option J is 8 × 8. That's 64, which is still lower than the correct number.

So yeah, option A is the correct expression because 25 multiplied by 8 gives the total number of photos. So the answer should be A.

The correct expression is 25 multiplied by 8, so the answer is A.
