The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A distributor agrees to sell 100 tubes of growth hormone to a medical treatment center in exchange for $30,000. The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?

Options:

A: No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.
B: Yes, unless the contract explicitly states that the bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive funds.
C: No, a bar of assignment can only be enforced if it is notarized and legally binding.
D: Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.
E: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.
F: Yes, a bar of assignment applies to all aspects of the contract, including the right to receive funds.
G: No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.
H: No, a bar of assignment is unenforceable if it inhibits the completion of the contract.
I: No, a court will not enforce the bar against assignment as it infringes upon the distributor's right to do business.
J: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable unless it contradicts federal law.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically about whether a court will enforce a contractual provision that prohibits the assignment of a right. Let's break this down step by step. 

The question says that a distributor is selling 100 tubes of growth hormone for $30,000, and the contract includes a clause that prohibits assignment of the rights to receive the funds. The distributor assigns the right to receive the funds anyway. The question is whether the court will enforce this bar against assignment.

Hmm, I remember that in contract law, certain rights are protected by bars of assignment. A bar of assignment is a limitation on someone's ability to assign their rights under a contract. The key is whether the bar is explicitly stated in the contract. If it's not, does that mean it's enforceable?

Wait, I think that generally, if a contract includes a bar against assignment, it's intended to protect the parties. But I should check the specific rules. So, the main idea is that if a contract excludes a particular right (like being able to assign it), that right is considered a bar. But sometimes, the bar is not enforceable if the contract doesn't have it, or if it's not legally binding.

Wait, there's also the concept of notarization. If the contract is notarized, the bar might be enforceable. But the question doesn't mention anything about notarization. It just says the contract includes a bar against assigning the funds. So, the fact that it's a contractual provision doesn't automatically make it enforceable.

I think the general rule is that a contract has a bar against assignment if it explicitly excludes the right to assign. So, unless the contract says the bar doesn't apply, the court should enforce it. Looking at the options:

Option A says the bar doesn't apply unless stated. That sounds right. But wait, are there exceptions? Like, if the bar is a contractual one, is it generally enforceable?

Option B says yes unless the contract states the bar doesn't apply. That sounds like it's a correct statement. So, the court will enforce the bar unless the contract explicitly says otherwise.

But wait, another point: Some jurisdictions have rules about contractual bars. For example, some might require that the bar be in writing, and others might have to be legally binding. But since the question is about whether the court will enforce the bar, regardless of its enforcement mechanisms, the main point is the clause in the contract.

So, the question is whether the court will enforce the bar. The bar is present in the contract unless stated otherwise. So, the court would enforce it, unless the contract explicitly states the bar doesn't apply to the right to receive funds.

Looking at the options again, option B says "Yes, unless the contract explicitly states that the bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive funds." That seems correct. 

Wait, another thought. Some contracts have general terms that prohibit specific assignments, but if those are in the contract, they are treated as bars. But if the bar is a general one, like not being able to assign contracts, it's enforceable unless the contract says otherwise.

So, the answer should be B. Because the question is whether the court will enforce the bar unless the contract says otherwise.

The correct answer is:

**B: Yes, unless the contract explicitly states that the bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive funds.**

**Explanation:**
The question involves determining whether a court will enforce a contractual provision prohibiting the assignment of a right, such as the distributor's right to receive funds. Typically, a contract bar against assignment applies if it explicitly excludes the right to assign. The court will enforce such a bar unless the contract explicitly states that it does not apply to that particular right. Therefore, the correct response is that the court will enforce the bar unless the contract explicitly excludes it. 

Answer: B
