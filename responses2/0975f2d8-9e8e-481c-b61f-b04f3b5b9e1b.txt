Okay, so I've got this question about sound and the paths that compressions and rarefactions take. Hmm, I remember that sound waves are mechanical vibrations that travel through a medium, like air or water. The medium moves in waves, which consist of compressions and rarefactions. 

Wait, compressions are areas where the medium is squeezed together, and rarefactions are where it's spread out. So, when the compression and rarefaction waves meet, they create pressure changes that propagate through the medium. I think these waves move through the medium in a specific pattern.

I remember something about how these waves move. Like, in a longitudinal wave, which is a type of sound wave, the compression and rarefaction move in the same direction. Oh wait, no, wait. No, longitudinal waves are compressions and rarefactions moving in the same direction because the wave's compression and rarefaction are in line with the direction of the wave propagation. 

Wait, another thought: transverse waves, like light or radio waves, are different. They're made up of perpendicular changes, so the compression and rarefaction moves perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. But sound waves are longitudinal, so their compression and rarefaction are in the same direction as the wave moves.

So looking at the options: option C says they travel in the same direction. Option D says they're in a wave-like pattern but not the same. Wait, longitudinal waves are compressions and rarefactions moving in the same direction. So option C is correct.

Wait, what about other options? Option A: random direction. That doesn't make sense. The wave propagates, not randomly. B: zig-zag. No, that's not how sound waves work. They don't change direction like that. Option E: opposite directions. No, that's not the case. Option F: opposite. No, same direction. G: only from source to listener. No, the wave moves through the medium, so it's not just the source to listener. Option H: none of these. But I think option C is correct.

Wait, another point: I remember something about the compression and rarefaction traveling in the same direction as the wave moves. So option C is correct. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: in the same direction. Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical vibrations, where compressions and rarefactions travel in the same direction as the wave propagates. 

Answer: C
