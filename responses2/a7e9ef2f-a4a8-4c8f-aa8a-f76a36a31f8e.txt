Okay, so I have this question about how psychologists view infants over the years. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the shift in how psychologists view infants. The options are from A to J, each making a different point about infants' capabilities. I need to figure out which option is correct.

Let me start by recalling what I know about infants and psychology. I remember that early childhood development has been a subject of study for a long time. Psychologists have long been interested in how babies and children develop, learning, and how they perceive the world.

Option A says that psychologists now emphasize the functions infants can perform, considering their lack of development and learning abilities. I think this is correct because as children grow, their abilities change, so they might be seen as capable in certain areas. But I'm not sure if it's the most accurate.

Option B claims infants are capable of complex reasoning and abstract thought, like adults. Hmm, I'm not sure if infants can do that. I think they might have some basic abilities but not the same level as adults. Maybe B is incorrect.

Option C suggests infants' behavior is random and not indicative of cognitive processes. That doesn't sound right. Infants have shown some pattern and skill, so behavior might not be random. So C is probably not correct.

Option D states that infants have no capacity for learning until they reach toddler age. I don't think that's true. Infants can learn a lot, like social skills, but they still have a lot of sensorimotor abilities that adults don't have yet.

Option E claims infants communicate at the same level as adults. I'm not sure. Adults can talk and write, but is it the same as infants? I think infants can communicate, but it's more basic and limited. So maybe E is incorrect.

Option F says infants are considered miniature adults with all capacities developed. That sounds a lot like option B. If B is wrong because infants can't do complex reasoning, then F is also incorrect.

Option G states that infants are viewed as inadequate and passive. I don't think that's accurate. Infants are active and have a lot of potential, though their abilities develop as they grow.

Option H says psychologists no longer study infant behavior. I don't think that's true. There's a lot of research, especially in areas like early childhood development and neuro development.

Option I claims that infants are influenced only by genetics, no environment. That's not correct. Infants are exposed to the world, so their behaviors are influenced by both genetics and environment.

Option J claims infants are now considered fully developed humans. I'm pretty sure that's not the case. Infants are still developing and have many areas that aren't fully matured yet.

Putting it all together, let's go through each option again. The question is about the way psychologists view infants.

Option A seems correct because the way心理学 has evolved probably focuses more on the developmental stages and what's observable. For example, in behaviorism, infants were seen as having certain observable behaviors, but as psychology changed, they might have more about their cognitive functions and learning.

Option B is probably incorrect because infants can't do complex reasoning yet. They might have some reasoning abilities but not the same as adults.

Option J is incorrect because they're still developing. J says they're fully developed humans, which isn't true.

So, the correct answer is A: emphasizing their capability considering their lack of development and learning abilities.

The correct answer is **A: Psychologists now emphasize the functions that an infant can perform considering his lack of development and learning abilities.**

**Explanation:**
- **Option A** is correct because it reflects the evolving perspective on infants, focusing on their developmental stages and observable capabilities.
- **Options B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I** are incorrect. They either misrepresent infants' capabilities or misattribute their abilities to different models or eras.
- **Option J** is incorrect because infants are still in the process of development, not yet fully formed.
- Thus, A accurately captures the way psychological studies on infants have evolved.
