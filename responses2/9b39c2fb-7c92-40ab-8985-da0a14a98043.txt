Question:

A shop owner domiciled in State A sued a distributor in a federal district court in State A for breach of a contract. The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

Options:

A: No, because the distributor and the wholesaler conduct business in different states.
B: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.
C: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not directly related to the distributor's claim.
D: No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.
E: No, because the distributor has invoked the jurisdiction of the court.
F: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not a compulsory counterclaim.
G: No, because the wholesaler and distributor are incorporated in the same state.
H: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.
I: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the distributor can dismiss the wholesaler's counterclaim. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The situation is that the shop owner sued the distributor for breach of contract. The shop owner asked for $100,000 in damages for defective goods. The distributor is in State B, with their business in State C. Then, the wholesaler, who's also in State B, provided the goods and is listed as a third-party defendant. They're bringing a counterclaim for a $60,000 payment. The distributor is moving to dismiss this counterclaim, and I need to decide if that's correct.

First, I remember that for a demand or counterclaim to be valid, it needs to be subject to the jurisdiction of the same state. But wait, the question is about whether the motion to dismiss is granted. So, does the distributor have jurisdiction over the counterclaim?

The main issue here is whether the counterclaim is within the jurisdiction of the court. The court is in State A, and the shop owner is suing in that state. So, the court's jurisdiction is State A. Now, the wholesaler is in State B. I think that's a key point. If the wholesaler is in a different state, does that affect the jurisdiction?

Wait, I remember that if the parties are in different states, the common law applies, and the jurisdiction isn't automatically transferred. So, the court in State A can only handle cases where both parties are in the same state, or where the demand is in the state of either party.

In this case, the wholesaler is bringing a counterclaim from State B, and the court is in State A. So, the counterclaim is a demand from a party in State B. Since the demand is from a party in a different state, is there an issue?

Wait, but the demand (the counterclaim) is a demand under the contract. The demand has to be made within the jurisdiction of the state where the contract was made. The contract was between the distributor and the wholesaler in State B. So, the demand for payment from the wholesaler is a demand made from State B. But the court in State A can only enforce demands if the demand is made within the jurisdiction of that state.

Wait, but the demand is from the wholesaler in State B. The court is in State A. So, the demand isn't within the jurisdiction of State A. Therefore, the distributor can't enforce the counterclaim under the jurisdiction of State A. So, the distributor's motion to dismiss would be valid because it's not subject to the jurisdiction of the court.

Wait, but wait a second. Another angle: the demand (the counterclaim) is a demand under the contract. The contract is between the distributor (State B) and the wholesaler (State A). So, the demand is from State B. The demand is a demand made in State B, but the court is in State A. So, the demand is not within the jurisdiction of State A because the demand is from State B. So, the demand can't be enforced by State A's court.

Alternatively, the demand is a demand from State B, but the court is in State A, so the demand isn't within State A's jurisdiction. So, the counterclaim is not subject to the court's jurisdiction, so the distributor can't dismiss it. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss.

Looking back at the options:

Option E says "No, because the distributor has invoked the jurisdiction of the court." That makes sense because the distributor's own jurisdiction isn't State A. They could argue that their own jurisdiction is State B, but the counterclaim is supposed to be within State A's jurisdiction. So, if the counterclaim is made from State B, it's not within State A's jurisdiction.

Alternatively, another approach: for the demand (counterclaim) to be enforceable, both parties must be in the jurisdiction. If the demand is from a party outside the jurisdiction, the demand isn't enforceable. So, the wholesaler is in State B, and the demand is from State B. The court is in State A, which doesn't have jurisdiction over demands from State B. So the counterclaim isn't in the jurisdiction of the court. Therefore, the distributor's motion to dismiss is correct.

Looking at the options again, option E says "No, because the distributor has invoked the jurisdiction of the court." I think that's the correct reasoning. Because the distributor is in State B, and the demand is from State B. But the court is in State A, which doesn't have jurisdiction. So, the demand is invalid, and the distributor can dismiss.

Another thought: the question is about whether the counterclaim's subject-matter is within the court's jurisdiction. Since the wholesaler is in State B, their counterclaim is from State B. But the court is in State A, so the demand is not within the jurisdiction. So, the counterclaim is invalid, and the distributor can dismiss.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The distributor's motion to dismiss the wholesaler's counterclaim is appropriate because the counterclaim is a demand made from State B, and the court in State A does not have jurisdiction over demands originating from State B. Therefore, the counterclaim is not within the jurisdiction of the court, and the distributor should dismiss it.
