Okay, let's see. I'm trying to answer this psychology question about the theoretical orientations used by a psychologist. Hmm, the question says the psychologist emphasizes appropriate consequences when dealing with misbehavior. Also, they mention the goal of misbehavior can be to confirm a disability, get attention, power, or revenge. I need to pick the correct theoretical orientation from the options given.

So, the options are Adlerian, Existential, Cognitive-behavioral, Systems theory, Gestalt, Transactional analysis, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, Behavioral, and Rogerian.

Wait, I remember that Adlerianism is about the history of the child and how it affects development. Existentialism is more about individual exploration and understanding the self. Cognitive-behavioral focuses on changing thought patterns to improve behavior. Systems theory is about systems and components working together. Gestalt is about how parts fit together in a whole. Transactional analysis is about treating clients as individuals, focusing on their relationships. Psychodynamic is about unconscious mind processes. Humanistic theory emphasizes self and connection. Behavioral theory focuses on observable behaviors and conditioning. Rogerian theory is about the role of religion in behavior.

The question mentions consequences and misbehavior goals—like getting attention, power, revenge. That makes me think about consequences and perhaps the idea that misbehavior can be explained by underlying issues.

Wait, the question also says the psychologist emphasizes appropriate consequences, which I associate with behavioral theory. Behavioral theory focuses on observable behaviors and the consequences of actions, like reinforcing or punishment. It's about the consequences of actions. So, the psychologist is using behavioral theory because they're talking about consequences and possible underlying issues.

Alternatively, Cognitive-behavioral might involve changing thought patterns but not necessarily about consequences. Systems theory is about systems, which could be about how behaviors fit together. Transactional analysis is about treatment dynamics. Rogerian is about religion's role.

Wait, but looking again, the question says "the goal of misbehavior can be to confirm an assumed disability, or to get attention, power, or revenge." That suggests the theory is about the underlying causes of misbehavior, perhaps explaining it through reinforcement or underlying issues.

Adlerian theory is more about the history of the child, so probably not. Existentialism is about self-discovery. Cognitive-behavioral is about changing thought. Systems theory is about systems and components. Transactional analysis is about relationships. Psychodynamic is about unconscious processes. Humanistic theory includes self and connection. Behavioral is about observable behavior and conditioning. Rogerian is about religion.

So, the question says the psychologist emphasizes consequences, which points towards behavioral theory, because behavioral theory is about what happens, the consequences of actions. Alternatively, cognitive-behavioral might involve changing thoughts, not just consequences.

Wait, but the goal of misbehavior is about underlying issues—like depression or something. The psychologist is explaining that misbehavior can be to confirm disability, get attention, etc. So, the theory would be something that can explain such underlying causes, perhaps more about the process of change rather than just the outcomes.

Wait, another angle: The心理学 is explaining the goals of misbehavior, so perhaps using a theory that deals with underlying causes. Let me think about the options again.

Behavioral theory is about the observable consequences of actions. So, the psychologist would use behavioral theory to explain that mis behaviors can be due to things like getting attention (maybe a form of reinforcement) or power (maybe rewards), which are observable.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be behavioral theory. So the option is I: Behavioral.

The psychologist emphasizes the role of consequences in misbehavior and explains that misbehavior can stem from underlying issues like confirming a disability or seeking attention/power. This aligns with behavioral theory, which focuses on observable behaviors and their consequences. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: I: Behavioral
