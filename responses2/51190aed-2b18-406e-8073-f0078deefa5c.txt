Question:

Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle.

Options:

A: Cardiac muscle has a metabolism similar to smooth muscle, designed for quick, short bursts of activity.
B: Cardiac muscle cells are multinucleated and arranged in a non-striated pattern.
C: Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle. It is striated, has numerous nuclei per cell, is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and its metabolism is designed for endurance.
D: Cardiac muscle lacks intercalated discs, which differentiates it from skeletal and smooth muscle.
E: Cardiac muscle does not have any similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle
F: Cardiac muscle is innervated by the somatic nervous system, similar to skeletal muscle.
G: Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle
H: Cardiac muscle has a metabolism designed for speed and strength
I: Cardiac muscle is not striated and has a single nucleus per cell, similar to smooth muscle.
J: Cardiac muscle is identical to smooth muscle in both structure and function.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about cardiac muscle compared to skeletal and smooth muscle. Hmm, I remember that cardiac muscle is a specialized type of muscle, but I need to think about their differences.

Wait, the options are A to J, each making a claim about how cardiac muscle differs from the other two types. Let me go through each point one by one.

First, option B: "Cardiac muscle cells are multinucleated and arranged in a non-striated pattern." I think smooth muscle is multinucleated and striated. Multinucleated means they have multiple nuclei per cell, right? And striated means they're arranged in straight lines, like a striated bas membrane. So B seems incorrect because cardiac muscle isn't multinucleated. So I can eliminate B.

Next, option D: "Cardiac muscle lacks intercalated discs, which differentiates it from skeletal and smooth muscle." I remember that cardiac muscle has intercalated discs, which skeletal muscle has, but smooth muscle doesn't. So D is incorrect because it says cardiac lacks these discs, which they do have. So D is wrong.

Option C: "Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle. It is striated, has numerous nuclei per cell, is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and its metabolism is designed for endurance." Wait, I thought smooth muscle is striated, but cardiac isn't. So C is wrong because it's saying cardiac is striated, which it isn't. So C can't be correct.

Option E: "Cardiac muscle does not have any similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle." That can't be right because they do have some similarities. Like, both are striated and have intercalated discs. So E is incorrect.

Option A: "Cardiac muscle has a metabolism similar to smooth muscle, designed for quick, short bursts of activity." I think smooth muscle is more like a slow, steady contraction, while cardiac muscle is ejection, which is high-velocity. So A sounds correct because smooth muscle is slow and steady, cardiac is high-velocity. So A might be correct.

Option C again: Let me think again. The key points are: striated, intercalated discs, multiple nuclei, autonomic nervous system, and endurance metabolism. Wait, does cardiac have multiple nuclei? I think smooth muscle has multinucleated, but cardiac is multinucleated? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Smooth muscle cells are multinucleated, and cardiac is multinucleated as well. Oh wait, no. Let me recall. Smooth muscle is multinucleated, striated, and has a high rest-to-extent contractility. Cardiac is multinucleated, striated? No, wait, I think cardiac is striated, but smooth muscle is not. So C says cardiac is striated, which is wrong. So C is incorrect.

Option B is out because it's multinucleated. So what's left?

Option E is out because they do have some similarities. So what's left is to see if any other options fit.

Option C is incorrect because it says cardiac is striated. So I need to find another correct option.

Looking again:

Option C: It's striated, has multiple nuclei, autonomic, discs, etc. Wait, the correct features of cardiac are: striated, multinucleated, different contractility (ejection), discs (intercalated), autonomic innervation, and high-velocity activity. So the option says "is striated" which is wrong. So C is incorrect.

Looking at option C again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options.

Wait, option C says:

C: Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle. It is striated, has numerous nuclei per cell, is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and its metabolism is designed for endurance.

Wait, I'm recalling that smooth muscle is striated, and cardiac muscle is also striated. So C is incorrect because it's saying cardiac is striated.

What about option E? No, because they do have similarities.

Wait, perhaps looking at another option. Let's go through each.

Option A: Cardiac muscle has a metabolism similar to smooth muscle, designed for quick, short bursts of activity. So smooth muscle is slow and steady, cardiac is high-velocity. So A is correct.

Option E is wrong because they do have some similarities. So A and C are incorrect because they both have issues.

Wait, another thought. Do cardiac muscle cells have multinucleated? I think smooth muscle is multinucleated, but I'm not sure about cardiac. Maybe I need to think about the options again.

Looking at the options, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate each.

Option B: Multinucleated and non-striated. No, smooth muscle is multinucleated and striated.

Option C: Some characteristics of both, but is striated. No, because cardiac is not striated.

Option E: Doesn't have any similarities, which is incorrect.

Option H: Cardiac has a metabolism designed for speed and strength. No, because cardiac is ejection, which is high-velocity.

Option D: No discs, which is wrong because they have discs.

Option F: Innervated by somatic, which is wrong because cardiac is innervated by autonomic.

Option G: Cardiac similar to skeletal but not smooth. Correct. So G is a possible correct option.

Wait, looking back: option G says, "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle." Wait, skeletal and smooth? Or the options may have different wording. Let me check.

Option G: "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle." Hmm. Well, I know that cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle in some aspects. But are they not smooth? No, because smooth is another type.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about each muscle's structure and function.

Smooth muscle: multinucleated, striated, high rest-to-extent contractility. High-velocity, ejection activity. Involves the sympathetic nervous system.

Cardiac muscle: multinucleated, striated, high-velocity, intercalated discs, autonomic innervation, and it's associated with high-intensity exercise.

So what about the options again.

Looking back, option E is incorrect.

What about option C: "Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle." Well, skeletal and smooth are both striated, but I thought cardiac is striated as well. Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. I'm a bit mixed up.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think about the structure.

Smooth muscle: striated, multinucleated, high velocity.

Cardiac muscle: striated, multinucleated, high velocity, intercalated discs, autonomic.

So, both are striated, have high-velocity activity.

So option C says cardiac is striated, which is correct. But option C also says "some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth," which includes being striated, but that's correct. Wait, but I thought that skeletal and smooth are both striated. So option C says "striated," which is a correct description, but the other options may be incorrect.

Wait, but option C is saying "some characteristics of both," which might include other aspects.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C: "Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle. It is striated, has numerous nuclei per cell, is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and its metabolism is designed for endurance."

Wait, the first part of option C: "show some characteristics of both" is correct because both have similar features. The second part says it's striated, which is correct. So C is correct? Or is it incorrect because it says it's striated, which is correct, but perhaps other aspects are incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, perhaps option E is incorrect because they have similar structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct options are A and G.

Wait, option G says "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle." Is this correct?

Wait, smooth muscle is multinucleated and striated. Cardiac is multinucleated and striated. So if G says it's similar to skeletal but not smooth, that would be correct.

Wait, what's the structure of skeletal muscle? It's striated, multinucleated, high-velocity contraction. So if G is correct, then cardiac is similar to skeletal but not to smooth.

Wait, smooth muscle is multinucleated and striated. Cardi: same. So G would be correct because it's similar to skeletal (same structure) but not smooth (since smooth is multinucleated and striated, same as cardi's, so G is incorrect. Hmm.)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think about what each option says.

Option C: It is striated, which is correct, but also says "some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth." Well, both are striated, so that part is correct. But the other parts describe characteristics of cardiac, which are more of skeletal plus discs and autonomic.

So, option C is correct if it's correct in the other aspects.

Wait another thought: Do cardiac muscle cells have intercalated discs? Yes, I remember that. So option C says "has intercalated discs" and "has intercalated discs," which is correct.

So, in option C, the correct statements are:

- striated: correct
- multinucleated: correct
- autonomic: correct
- intercalated discs: correct
- metabolism for endurance: correct.

But wait, I thought smooth muscle is not multinucleated. So, the initial option C seems correct, because it's correct in the parts it says.

But the first part of option C says "show some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle," which is correct because they share striated and high-velocity features.

So, option C is correct.

Wait, but looking again at the options, I'm not sure about option G. Let me read it again.

Option G: "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle." Well, smooth muscle and cardiac are both striated and multinucleated. So G is incorrect because it suggests cardi muscle is not smooth, which it is.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look for the correct option. Another approach is to match each point.

Option A: "Cardiac muscle has a metabolism similar to smooth muscle, designed for quick, short bursts of activity." Smooth is steady, cardiac is high-velocity. So A is correct.

Option C: It's correct in the parts it says, but I'm not sure about the first part. Does it say it has some characteristics of both? Yes.

Wait, but then can multiple options be correct? Probably not, as each is a stand-alone statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and C are incorrect, but the correct answer is another option.

Wait another approach: let's go through each option.

Option A: Correct.

Option B: No.

Option C: Correct.

Option D: No.

Option E: No.

Option F: No.

Option G: No.

Option H: No.

Option I: No.

Option J: No.

Wait, but the question says "Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle." So which options are correct.

Looking back, I think option C is correct. Because it's correct in all the points except the first part, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck.

Option C says:

- is striated: Correct.

- has numerous nuclei per cell: Correct.

- is innervated by autonomic: Correct.

- has intercalated discs: Correct.

- metabolism designed for endurance: Correct.

So all the points in option C are correct except for the first part, which is correct. So why is option C not correct?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that smooth muscle is multinucleated and striated, while cardiac is multinucleated and striated. So the first part of option C is correct. So option C is correct?

But wait, I thought that cardiac is striated and multinucleated, so the first part of option C is correct. So why can't option C be the correct answer?

Wait, but in the options I'm looking, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, I'm to choose the correct one. So looking again:

The correct answer is option A? Because cardiac is designed for bursts, which smooth isn't.

Wait, option A says: "Cardiac muscle cells are multinucleated and arranged in a non-striated pattern."

Wait, I thought smooth muscle is multinucleated and striated. So option A is wrong.

But I also thought that cardiac is multinucleated and striated, so option B is wrong.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct, but I'm not sure why because the first part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about each point in option C:

Striated: correct.

Multiple nuclei: correct.

Autonomic: correct.

Intercalated discs: correct.

Endurance: correct.

So all the points in option C are correct. So why is any of the other options correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A is correct, but I thought that was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps option G is correct.

Wait, option G says "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle."

Since both are striated, but smooth is multinucleated and striated. So the statement is incorrect because cardiac is multinucleated and striated, so it's not similar to skeletal muscle in that aspect.

So option G is incorrect.

Now, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the options again.

I think the correct answer is option A. Because cardiac is designed for high-velocity activity, whereas smooth muscle is slow.

Wait, option C includes that. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A and C.

But the question is, which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct one.

Let me think about each option:

A: Correct.

B: Incorrect.

C: Correct.

D: Incorrect.

E: Incorrect.

H: Incorrect.

G: Incorrect.

F: Incorrect.

I: Incorrect.

J: Incorrect.

So, both option A and C are correct? Or perhaps only one.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct because it's correct in all the points except the first.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the initial points.

Option C: It is striated. Correct.

Option A: Correct about metabolic type.

But in the options, each is a separate statement, so multiple statements are in the option. So for option C, all the points are correct.

Wait, but the question is asking to select which option is correct. So perhaps option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But no, because option C is correct in structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of other ways.

Another approach: Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle in some aspects, but not smooth. Do any of the options say that?

Looking at the options:

Option G: "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle." Since both are striated and multinucleated, that would be incorrect. So option G is wrong.

Option C: It's similar in some aspects, including being striated, but without the "similar to skeletal" part.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the other options are incorrect.

Wait, but why would option C be correct? Because it's correct in all the parts it says.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: "Cardiac ... designed for quick, short bursts of activity." That's correct.

But I thought the initial statement in option C is correct too.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not certain. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Let me try to summarize.

The correct options are:

Option C: correct in all parts.

Option A: correct.

But perhaps the question requires selecting all correct answers, but the options are singular.

Wait, the question says 'compare' so perhaps more than one is correct.

Wait, but the options are A through J, each option is one statement.

So, the question is, which of the options is correct. So which of the options (A-D) is correct?

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct, and the other options are wrong. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but why would option C be correct? Because it's correct in all the parts it says, but perhaps the others are not.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another approach: think about autonomic and autonomic: autonomic is part of the innervation.

So option C says it's innervated by autonomic, correct.

Option C: "Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle."

Smooth muscle is not striated, so option C is correct because it's similar in some aspects.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is option A: "Cardiac muscle ... designed for quick, short bursts of activity."

Wait, but option C says it's striated, which is correct.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should consider that option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: think about the structure.

Option C says it's striated. So it's correct.

So, in the options given, which is correct? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to make a decision.

I think option C is correct because it describes several characteristics of cardiac muscle, including the autonomic nervous system, intercalated discs, and so on.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I thought option C is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm not confident because I'm a bit stuck.

To compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle, let's analyze each option carefully:

1. **Option A**: "Cardiac muscle has a metabolism similar to smooth muscle, designed for quick, short bursts of activity."  
   This is correct. Smooth muscle has a high-velocity contractility and is designed for slow, steady contraction. In contrast, cardiac muscle has high-velocity activity, often associated with rapid contractions during intense exercise.

2. **Option B**: "Cardiac muscle cells are multinucleated and arranged in a non-striated pattern."  
   This is incorrect. Smooth muscle cells are multinucleated and arranged in a striated pattern. Cardiac muscle cells are multinucleated but are not arranged in a non-striated pattern.

3. **Option C**: "Cardiac muscle shows some characteristics of both skeletal and smooth muscle. It is striated, has numerous nuclei per cell, is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, has intercalated discs, and its metabolism is designed for endurance."  
   This is correct in several aspects. Cardiac muscle shares some structural similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle, such as being multinucleated and arranged in a striated pattern. It is also innervated by the autonomic nervous system and has intercalated discs. However, the first part of this option ("It is striated") is correct, so the entire option is accurate.

4. **Option D**: "Cardiac muscle does not have intercalated discs, which differentiates it from skeletal and smooth muscle."  
   This is incorrect. Cardiac muscle is striated, multinucleated, and differs from smooth muscle by having intercalated discs. Smooth muscle lacks these structures.

5. **Option E**: "Cardiac muscle does not have any similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle."  
   This is incorrect. Cardiac muscle shares some similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle, such as being multinucleated and arranged in a striated pattern.

6. **Option F**: "Cardiac muscle is innervated by the somatic nervous system."  
   This is incorrect. cardiac muscle is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, not the somatic nervous system.

7. **Option G**: "Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle."  
   This is incorrect. Both skeletal and cardiac muscle are striated and multinucleated, but cardiac muscle is not smooth muscle.

8. **Option H**: "Cardiac muscle has a metabolism designed for speed and strength."  
   This is incorrect. cardiac muscle has high-velocity activity, which is associated with high-intensity exercise, not speed and strength.

9. **Option I**: "Cardiac muscle is not a part of any nervous system."  
   This is incorrect. cardiac muscle is part of the autonomic nervous system.

10. **Option J**: "Cardiac muscle does not have any similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle."  
    This is incorrect. Cardiac muscle shares similarities with skeletal and smooth muscle, such as being multinucleated and arranged in a striated pattern.

After careful analysis, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes several characteristics of cardiac muscle, including its structure and function.

ANSWER: C
