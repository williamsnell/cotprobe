Okay, so I need to figure out what personal (ratione personae) immunity is. I'm a bit rusty on my immunity topics, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that immunity has different types. There's general immunity, which is the basic level of protection against diseases and infections. Then there's specific immunity, which is when you have a unique response to a specific pathogen or pathogen-specific response.

Hmm, personal immunity sounds more like specific immunity. I think it's when an individual has a strong immune response specific to a certain pathogen. So, if someone takes a specific vaccine, they get a strong immune response that lasts longer than the general immune system can provide.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Personal immunity is afforded to all physical persons. That doesn't sound right because personal immunity is about specific responses.

Option F: Personal immunity is given to all individuals, regardless of their conduct. Wait, conduct here probably refers to the pathogen. But I think the term personal immunity might be more about the individual's conduct, meaning their actions towards others, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more about the individual's genotype and the pathogen they encounter.

Wait, personal immunity is when you have a strong immune response to a specific pathogen. So, the individual's conduct towards others (which could be a pathogen) would give them that response. So if someone takes a vaccine, they get a strong response regardless of their actions. But the option says personal immunity is given to all physical persons, which doesn't align because it's not about their actions.

Option C: Personal immunity is afforded to all State officials. That's probably not correct because state officials might not have that level of immunity. Unless they've been exposed to specific pathogens, but I don't think that's the case.

Option E: Personal immunity is given only to individuals who've committed a crime in public. That doesn't make sense because personal immunity is about the individual's own actions, not their behavior in crimes.

Option G: Personal immunity is for conduct in a personal capacity. So, it's about the individual's own conduct, like getting sick or getting vaccinated. That aligns with what I thought earlier.

Option A: Personal immunity is given for their private conduct, not public. That seems opposite of what I'm thinking. I thought personal immunity is for their own conduct.

Option D: Only give to people who committed a crime in public. That's probably not the case because personal immunity is a broader concept.

Option I: State officials have private immunity. So, maybe state officials have a different level of immunity, perhaps lower. So, if someone is a state official, they might not have the same level of specific immunity as a public performer.

Option J: Only for public conduct. So, personal immunity would be for private conduct.

Wait, the question is about personal immunity. So, personal immunity is about the individual's own conduct (like taking a vaccine), not their actions as a public or private individual.

Looking back, option G says personal immunity is afforded in a personal capacity, meaning for conduct in their own private way. That fits because it's about the individual's own actions, not their role in public or private activities.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: Personal immunity is afforded to individuals who have committed a crime in a public capacity.
