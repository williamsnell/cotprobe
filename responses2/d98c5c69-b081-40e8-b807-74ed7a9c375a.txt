Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about hydrolysis equilibrium involving Al^3+ ions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is asking about the concentration of H3O+ ions in a 0.1 M AlCl3 solution. The hydrolysis constant given is 1.4e-5. 

Wait, AlCl3 dissociates in water. Right, AlCl3 would break down into Al^3+ and Cl^- ions. So, the solution initially has [Al^3+] = 0.1 M and [Cl^-] = 0.1 M. But since the solution is acidic, the Al^3+ will hydrolyze. 

Hydrolysis of Al^3+ is an acid-base reaction. The Al^3+ is a strong Lewis acid, so it will react with water. The reaction is likely something like: Al^3+ + H2O ↔ Al(OH)3 + H+ (or maybe Al^3+ + H2O → [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+?), but wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact products. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it forms a complex ion and releases H+.

Wait, I remember that the hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water is a reaction that produces H+ ions. The equilibrium expression would involve the hydrolysis constant. So the expression for the hydrolysis of Al^3+ is probably something like:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+

Wait, no, I think it might produce a complex and H+. Or maybe it's Al^3+ + H2O ⇌ Al(OH)^2+ + 2H+ ? I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Al^3+ + H2O → Al(OH)3 + H+. But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach. The hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water is an acid-base reaction, so it should produce H+ ions. The hydrolysis constant (K) given is 1.4e-5. I think the reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+

But wait, another possibility is that the Al^3+ donates protons. Alternatively, the reaction might be:

Al^3+ + 3H2O → [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + 3H+

Wait, I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Let me think about the general formula. For Al(OH)3, the reaction is Al(OH)3 + H2O → 2H+ + Al(OH)2^-. Hmm. But I'm probably getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+.

But wait, another source says that the hydrolysis of Al^3+ is a complexation reaction with water, producing Al(OH)3 and releasing H+ ions. So maybe the correct reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O ⇌ Al(OH)3 + H+.

Wait, but Al(OH)3 is a weak base. So in solution, it would react with H+ to form Al^3+ and OH^-? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the correct reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+.

In any case, the hydrolysis constant (K) is given as 1.4e-5. Wait, I think I remember that the hydrolysis constant (K) for Al^3+ in water is around 1e-5, but sometimes I've seen values as low as 1e-15 or higher. But in this problem, it's 1.4e-5.

Wait, but the reaction producing H+ would have a K. So if the reaction is Al^3+ + H2O → [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+, then the expression for K would be [H+][Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+][H2O]. But since H2O is a solvent, its concentration is considered constant and thus it's absorbed into the equilibrium expression. So effectively, the expression would be K = [H+][Al^6+]/[Al^3+]. Wait, no, sorry, the complex is [Al(H2O)6]^3+ which I'll denote as [AlH6]^3+.

But perhaps the correct expression is K = [H+][Al(H2O)_6]^3+ / [Al^3+]. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the exact stoichiometry. Another approach: the hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water can be considered as:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ Al(OH)3 + H+.

Wait, but Al(OH)3 is a weak base. So the reaction would be Al(OH)3 + H+ → Al^3+ + OH^-. But the hydrolysis of Al^3+ would be the reverse, giving H+.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equilibrium. Let me clarify: the hydrolysis of Al^3+ is an acid-base reaction where Al^3+ accepts a proton (H+) from water, producing H+ and Al(OH)3. So the reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(OH)3] + H+.

The equilibrium expression would be K = [H+][Al(OH)3] / [Al^3+][H2O]. Since H2O is a liquid and its concentration is considered constant, K = [H+][Al(OH)3]/[Al^3+] = K.

But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the complex is [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ which is a different species. So the reaction is:

Al^3+ + 6 H2O → [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ + 3 H+.

In that case, the equilibrium expression would be K = [H+]^3 [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ / [Al^3+].

But since [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ is a complex ion, the expression would involve its concentration. However, in this problem, perhaps we can assume that it's a negligible change, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is simply:

Al^3+ + 3 H2O → [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ + 3 H+.

Wait, but this way, the stoichiometry would be 1:3. The given hydrolysis constant is 1.4e-5, which would then be K = [H+]^3 [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ / [Al^3+].

Alternatively, if it's a different stoichiometry, the approach would vary.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem again. The solution is 0.1 M AlCl3, so [Al^3+] is 0.1 M, and [Cl^-] is 0.1 M. The hydrolysis of Al^3+ would produce H+ and form a complex. The K (hydrolysis constant) is given as 1.4e-5. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water is represented by the equation:

Al^3+ + 3 H2O → [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ + 3 H+.

In that case, the equilibrium expression would be:

K = [H+]^3 [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ / [Al^3+].

But since the solution is aqueous, and [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ is a complex ion, perhaps the dominant species is that complex. So the equilibrium expression simplifies to:

K = [H+]^3 [Al(H2O)_6]^3+ / [Al^3+] ≈ [H+]^3 [complex]/ [Al^3+].

But since the problem gives the hydrolysis constant as 1.4e-5, and perhaps we can assume that the complex is in significant concentration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrolysis produces a 1:1 ratio of Al^3+ to H+.

Wait, maybe the problem is similar to the hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water. I recall that the hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water is a complexation reaction, not necessarily a direct hydrolysis. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem using the hydrolysis equilibrium.

Let me consider the reaction:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(OH)3] + H+.

But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry. Another approach is to consider the hydrolysis as a base reaction. Wait, Al^3+ is a weak base? No, I think Al^3+ is a weak acid. Because Al^3+ is a conjugate acid of Al(OH)3, which is a weak base.

Wait, Al(OH)3 is a weak base, so in solution, it will react with H+ to form Al^3+ and OH^-.

The reaction is:

Al(OH)3 + H+ → Al^3+ + OH^-.

The hydrolysis constant for this base would be Kb = [Al^3+][OH^-]/[Al(OH)3].

But in this problem, we are given the hydrolysis constant of Al^3+, which is K_a = [H+][Al(OH)3]/[Al^3+][H2O], but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should write the hydrolysis constant equation correctly. Let's say that the reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(OH)3]^+ + H+.

Wait, maybe the correct reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O → Al(OH)3 + H+.

In this case, the equilibrium expression would be K = [H+][Al(OH)3]/[Al^3+][H2O].

But since [H2O] is a constant, it's absorbed into K, so K = [H+][Al(OH)3]/[Al^3+].

But if the problem gives K as 1.4e-5, and [Al^3+] is 0.1 M, perhaps we can model this.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water is such that:

Al^3+ + H2O → Al(OH)3 + H+.

But wait, the Al(OH)3 might dissociate further. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+.

In that case, the expression for K would be [H+][Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+][H2O] = K.

Assuming [H2O] is constant, this simplifies to K = [H+][Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+].

But [Al(H2O)6]^3+ is the complex and perhaps is a constant, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to assume that the concentration of the complex is negligible. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simply uses a simplified approach where the hydrolysis leads to a certain [H+] concentration.

Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis of Al^3+ is an equilibrium where the Al^3+ reacts with water to form H+ and the complex. Let's model the situation with the given K.

Assume that the concentration of H+ is x. When Al^3+ (0.1 M) reacts with water, it produces H+ and the complex. Let's suppose that the change is such that:

Al^3+ → [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+.

But perhaps each Al^3+ produces three H+ ions? Or each releases one H+?

Alternatively, perhaps each Al^3+ releases one H+ and forms the complex. So the reaction is:

Al^3+ + H2O → [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+.

In this case, the stoichiometry is 1:1:1.

So the equilibrium expression is K = [H+][Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+].

But [Al(H2O)6]^3+ is a complex, and its concentration might be much higher than [Al^3+], but without exact data, perhaps we can model it as a variable.

Wait, but perhaps we can approximate. Let's let the change be 'x'. So, initially, [Al^3+] = 0.1 M, [H+] = 0, and [Al(H2O)6]^3+ = 0.

At equilibrium:

[Al^3+] = 0.1 - x.

But wait, if the reaction is 1:1:1, then [H+] = x, and [Al(H2O)6]^3+ = x.

So K = x^2 / (0.1 - x) = 1.4e-5.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.1, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1.

So, x^2 / 0.1 = 1.4e-5 → x^2 = 1.4e-5 *0.1 → 1.4e-6 → x = sqrt(1.4e-6) ≈ 1.18e-3 M.

So [H+] ≈ 1.18e-3 M. Looking at the options, option G is 1.2e-3 M, which would be the closest.

Wait, but wait, is this the correct approach? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 1:3:1, as I thought earlier.

Let me reevaluate. If the reaction is:

Al^3+ + 3 H2O → [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + 3 H+.

Then, the equilibrium expression is K = [H+]^3 [Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+].

Let me let 'y' be the change. So, [H+] = 3y, [Al(H2O)6]^3+ = y, and [Al^3+] = 0.1 - y.

But if y is small, 0.1 - y ≈ 0.1.

So, K = (3y)^3 / 0.1 = 27 y^3 /0.1 = 270 y^3 =1.4e-5.

So, y^3 = 1.4e-5 / 270 ≈ 5.185e-8 → y ≈ cube root of 5.185e-8.

Cube root of 5.185e-8 is approximately 3.7e-3 (since (3.7e-3)^3 = ~5.06e-8). So y ≈ 3.7e-3.

Then, [H+] = 3y ≈ 1.11e-2 M. That's 0.0111 M, which is 1.11e-2. Looking at the options, the closest is E (1e-3) and F (8.4e-6), but none near. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have this value. Alternatively, perhaps my assumption about the reaction is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis is a 1:1:1 reaction, but the K is given as the hydrolysis constant, which would mean that.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps the hydrolysis constant given is for the complex ion. The problem says that the hydrolysis constant is K = 1.4e-5. I think the hydrolysis constant is defined as the concentration of products over the reactants, so in this case, if the reaction is Al^3+ + H2O → [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+, then K would be [H+][Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+][H2O]. But since [H2O] is a constant, K is equal to [H+][Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+].

But if [Al(H2O)6]^3+ is much larger than [Al^3+], perhaps the 1 can be neglected. Hmm, but without knowing the exact concentration, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the hydrolysis of Al^3+ in water as a 1:1 reaction.

Wait, perhaps the problem models it as a monoprotic hydrolysis, where each Al^3+ releases one H+ and forms a complex. So the equation is:

Al^3+ + H2O ↔ [Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H+.

So, K = [H+][Al(H2O)6]^3+ / [Al^3+] = 1.4e-5.

Assuming that [Al(H2O)6]^3+ is equal to [H+], because each H+ comes from one Al^3+.

So, let x be [H+].

Then, K = x^2 / 0.1 =1.4e-5 → x^2 = 1.4e-5 *0.1 → 1.4e-6 → x= sqrt(1.4e-6) ≈ 1.18e-3 M.

So [H+] is approx 1.18e-3 M. Looking at the options, option G is 1.2e-3 M, which is the closest. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the reaction as 1:3:1, I got [H+] ~ 1.1e-2 M, which isn't in the options. So I think the correct approach is the 1:1 reaction.

So, the correct answer is G: 1.2e-3 M.

To determine the concentration of H₃O⁺ ions in a 0.1 M AlCl₃ solution, we analyze the hydrolysis equilibrium of Al³⁺ in water. AlCl₃ dissociates into Al³⁺ and Cl⁻ ions, but the hydrolysis of Al³⁺ in water produces H⁺ ions and the complex [Al(H₂O)₆]³⁺. The hydrolysis constant (K) is given as 1.4 × 10⁻⁵.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Assumption**: The problem assumes that the hydrolysis of Al³⁺ in water proceeds according to the reaction:
   \[
   \text{Al}^{3+} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow [\text{Al(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+} + \text{H}^+
   \]
   This simplifies the equilibrium expression to:
   \[
   K = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{Al(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+}}{[\text{Al}^{3+}]}
   \]
   Assuming that the concentration of the complex \([\text{Al(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+}\) is approximately equal to \([\text{H}^+]\), the equilibrium expression becomes:
   \[
   K = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^2}{[\text{Al}^{3+}]}
   \]

2. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - Initial concentration of \(\text{Al}^{3+}\): 0.1 M.
   - Initial concentration of \(\text{H}^+\): 0 M.

3. **Equilibrium Setup**: Let \(x\) represent the equilibrium concentration of \(\text{H}^+\). Then:
   \[
   [\text{H}^+] = x, \quad [\text{Al(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+} = x, \quad [\text{Al}^{3+}] = 0.1 - x
   \]
   Using the equilibrium expression:
   \[
   K = \frac{x^2}{0.1 - x}
   \]
   Assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.1, we approximate \(0.1 - x \approx 0.1\). Thus:
   \[
   K \approx \frac{x^2}{0.1}
   \]
   Substituting \(K = 1.4 \times 10^{-5}\):
   \[
   1.4 \times 10^{-5} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.1}
   \]
   \[
   x^2 \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-6}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \sqrt{1.4 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.18 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The equilibrium concentration of \(\text{H}^+\) is approximately \(1.18 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\). Among the given options, the closest match is **G: 1.2 × 10⁻³ M**.
