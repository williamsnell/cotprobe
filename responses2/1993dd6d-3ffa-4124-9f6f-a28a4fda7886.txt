Okay, so I have this genetics problem here. Let me read it through again. The question is about a cross between two yellow-haired mice resulting in an F1 ratio of 2:1 nonyellow:1 yellow. They've given me the possible genotypes and the options for a diagram. I need to figure out which option correctly represents the genotypes for the surviving yellow and nonyellow mice.

Hmm, wait, the cross is between two yellow mice. So each parent is yellow, which is the dominant trait. Since it's a cross between two individuals that are homozygous for yellow (I think), the F1 generation would show the offspring's phenotype. But wait, the F1 ratio is 2:1 nonyellow:1 yellow. That suggests that only some of the offspring are nonyellow, so perhaps some of the parents are not homozygous.

Wait, the parents are both yellow. So if both are Y^Ly^L (assuming yellow is dominant), then the F1 should all be yellow, right? But the ratio here is 2:1 of yellow to nonyellow. So that suggests that not all offspring are yellow. Therefore, one of the parents must be homozygous recessive, causing some of the offspring to be nonyellow.

Wait, the options show F1 as 1/4 Y^lY^l (nonyellow) and 3/4 Y^Ly^L (yellow). So that makes sense because the parents are both Y^Ly^L, but when they cross, the F1 is 25% Y^lY^l (nonyellow), and 75% Y^Ly^L (yellow). So the initial parents must be Y^Ly^L each, and the F1 has a 25% chance of being y^ly^l (nonyellow) and 75% of being Y^Ly^L (yellow).

Wait, but the question is about the diagram. The options are about how the surviving yellow mice are represented. The correct scenario is that the surviving yellow mice are Y^Ly^L (75% or 3/4) and the nonyellow are y^ly^l (25% or 1/4).

Looking at the options:

Option A: Y^ly^L and y^Ly^L. Wait, that can't be. Because if parents are Y^Ly^L, then the F1 is 25% y^l y^l (nonyellow) and 75% Y^Ly^L (yellow). So the surviving yellow mice are Y^Ly^L, and nonyellow are y^ly^l. So option A is Y^ly^L and y^Ly^L; that's the opposite of what's happening.

Option B: Y^lY^l and y^Ly^L. So the nonyellow would be Y^lY^l which is 25% and the yellow would be 75%. But the F1 has 75% yellow and 25% nonyellow. So if this option is correct, the yellow mice would be represented as Y^lY^l, but that doesn't fit because the F1 shows 75% yellow. So option B would mean the yellow mice are actually y^Ly^L, which would make the F1 nonyellow. So option B is opposite.

Option C: Y^LY^L and Y^ly^L. So the yellow mice are Y^LY^L, which would mean 75% yellow, and nonyellow is Y^ly^l (25%). That's the correct scenario. So option C would have yellow represented as Y^LY^L (correct) and nonyellow as Y^ly^l (wrong as per F1 ratio). So option C is not correct because it says nonyellow is Y^ly^l, which would be 25% but the F1 shows 25% nonyellow. Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the genotypes of the surviving yellow mice and the nonyellow. So in the F1, 75% are yellow (Y^Ly^L) and 25% nonyellow (y^ly^l). So the correct representation would be yellow mice as Y^Ly^L and nonyellow as y^ly^l. So looking at the options, which one has that?

Looking at the options:

Option C: yellow as Y^LY^L, non as Y^ly^L. So non is wrong.

Option F: yellow as y^Ly^L, non as Y^lY^l. Wait, that's the opposite of what we have. Because in our case, the non are y^ly^l, which is the 25% part. So in the F1, 25% would be represented as y^ly^l, not as Y^ly^l.

Option A is Y^ly^L (nonyellow) and y^Ly^L (yellow). So the yellow would be represented as Y^Ly^L, which is correct because that's the 75% of yellow. The non would be Y^ly^l, which is wrong as the F1 shows 25% non. So option A is incorrect because it represents non as Y^ly^l, which is correct as 25% but the correct genotype is y^ly^l.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me rephrase:

The F1 ratio is 3:1 for yellow to nonyellow. So the parents must be both Y^Ly^L, because the F1 is 3/4 yellow and 1/4 non.

So the surviving yellow mice are Y^Ly^L (75% or 3/4), and non are y^ly^l (25% or 1/4).

Looking at the options:

Option C: yellow is Y^LY^L, non is Y^ly^L. That's incorrect because non is non-Y (y), so their genotype should be y^ly^l.

Option F: yellow is y^Ly^L, non is Y^lY^l. That's the opposite.

Option D: yellow is y^Ly^L, non is Y^Ly^L. So non would be 25% (Y^Ly^L), but F1 is 25% non. So the correct non genotype is y^ly^l, which isn't in any option except maybe none. Wait, looking back.

Wait, the options are:

A: yellow Y^ly^L, non Y^Ly^L.

B: yellow Y^lY^l, non Y^Ly^L.

C: yellow Y^LY^L, non Y^ly^L.

D: yellow y^Ly^L, non Y^Ly^L.

E: yellow Y^Ly^L, non Y^ly^L.

F: yellow y^Ly^L, non Y^lY^L.

G: yellow y^ly^l, non Y^ly^l.

H: yellow Y^lY^l, non Y^Ly^L.

I: yellow y^ly^l, non Y^ly^l.

J: yellow Y^ly^L, non Y^Ly^L.

Wait, wait, the F1 ratio is 2:1 nonyellow:1 yellow. So the ratio is yellow:non = 2:1. So 2/3 are non, 1/3 are yellow. So the correct representation would be that the yellow mice are Y^Ly^L (3/4), and non are y^ly^l (1/4).

Looking again at the options:

Option C: yellow as Y^LY^L, non as Y^ly^L. So non is Y, which is wrong. The correct non is y^ly^l.

Option E: yellow Y^Ly^L, non Y^ly^L. That's exactly what we want. So in this case, the correct option is E, where yellow is Y^Ly^L and non is y^ly^l.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

E: yellow Y^Ly^L, non Y^ly^L. So the correct answer would be E. So the surviving yellow mice are represented as Y^Ly^L, and non are y^ly^l.

But let me make sure.

Wait, the options list E as: the yellow mice are represented as Y^Ly^L and the non as y^ly^L. So that's correct. Because in the F1, 75% are Y^Ly^L (yellow) and 25% are y^ly^l (non). So the correct option is E.

Wait, but looking at the options, another option: option F says yellow is y^Ly^L and non is Y^lY^l. That's incorrect. Option C is yellow Y^LY^L and non Y^ly^L, which is wrong because non is Y. So option E is correct.
</think>

The cross between two yellow-haired mice results in an F1 ratio of 2:1 nonyellow:1 yellow. This indicates that the parents are homozygous for the dominant yellow allele (Y^Ly^L), and the F1 generation shows 75% yellow (Y^Ly^L) and 25% nonyellow (y^ly^l). The problem requires identifying the correct genotype representations for the surviving yellow and nonyellow mice among the given options.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Suggests yellow mice are Y^ly^L and nonyellow mice are Y^Ly^L. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 3/4 yellow and 1/4 nonyellow, so nonyellow should be y^ly^l, not Y^Ly^L.
- **Option B:** Suggests yellow mice are Y^lY^l and nonyellow mice are Y^Ly^L. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 3/4 yellow, so the correct genotype for yellow mice is Y^Ly^L.
- **Option C:** Suggests yellow mice are Y^LY^L and nonyellow mice are Y^ly^L. This is incorrect because the nonyellow mice should be represented as y^ly^l, not Y^ly^L.
- **Option D:** Suggests yellow mice are y^Ly^L and nonyellow mice are Y^Ly^L. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 3/4 yellow, so the correct genotype for yellow mice is Y^Ly^L.
- **Option E:** Suggests yellow mice are Y^Ly^L and nonyellow mice are y^ly^L. This is correct because the F1 shows 75% yellow (Y^Ly^L) and 25% nonyellow (y^ly^l).
- **Option F:** Suggests yellow mice are y^Ly^L and nonyellow mice are Y^lY^l. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 3/4 yellow and 1/4 nonyellow, so the correct genotype for nonyellow mice is y^ly^l.
- **Option G:** Suggests yellow mice are y^ly^l and nonyellow mice are Y^ly^l. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 25% nonyellow, so the correct genotype for nonyellow mice is y^ly^l.
- **Option H:** Suggests yellow mice are Y^lY^l and nonyellow mice are Y^Ly^L. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 3/4 yellow and 1/4 nonyellow, so the correct genotype for yellow mice is Y^Ly^L.
- **Option I:** Suggests yellow mice are y^ly^l and nonyellow mice are Y^ly^l. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 25% nonyellow, so the correct genotype for nonyellow mice is y^ly^l.
- **Option J:** Suggests yellow mice are Y^ly^L and nonyellow mice are Y^Ly^L. This is incorrect because the F1 shows 3/4 yellow and 1/4 nonyellow, so the correct genotype for yellow mice is Y^Ly^L.

### Conclusion:
The correct representation is given in **Option E**, where the surviving yellow mice are represented as Y^Ly^L and the nonyellow mice as y^ly^L.
