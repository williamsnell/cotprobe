Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and then think about what I know.

The question says that 40.0 kJ of energy is added to 1.00 gram of magnesium atoms in the vapor state. They give the first ionization potential as 735 kJ/mole and the second as 1447 kJ/mole. I need to find out the composition of the final mixture after adding that energy. The options are A through J, each giving different percentages of Mg²+ and Mg+.

Hmm, I remember that ionization potential is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. So when you add energy, the atoms lose electrons, becoming ions. The lower the ionization potential, the easier it is to lose an electron.

Wait, wait. The first ionization potential is 735 kJ/mol. That means that for each mole of Mg atoms, 735 kJ is needed to turn Mg into Mg²+. The second is 1447 kJ per mole — so each Mg atom losing another electron would require 1447 kJ.

But wait, the energy given is only 40 kJ. So that's much less than either of the two ionization potentials. Because 40 kJ is way lower than 735. Let me think: 735 is about 700, so 40 is much smaller.

So, if only 40 kJ is added, how many electrons can be ionized? Only one electron? Or maybe not even one. Let's calculate.

Wait, the energy per mole is given. Oh wait, the question states 40.0 kJ is added. The first ionization is 735 kJ per mole. So per mole, 735 kJ is needed. But our energy is 40 kJ, which is much less than that.

So, for each mole of Mg, the energy per mole is 735 kJ to ionize to Mg²+, which requires more than our energy. So, no Mg²+ ions will form. What about Mg+ ions? That requires 1447 kJ per mole. Our energy is 40 kJ, which is way less than 1447. So, even if we try to ionize once, that would require 1447, which we don't have.

Wait, but wait a second. 40 kJ is the amount of energy added. So, each Mg atom (assuming they are in vapor state) can lose one electron if the energy is sufficient for that. Let me think about the energy required per atom.

Wait, no, because the ionization potentials are per mole. So perhaps I need to calculate the energy required per atom. Because each mole is a large number.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first ionization potential is 735 kJ per mole. So per mole, 735 kJ is needed. So per mole, the energy per Mg atom is 735 kJ / Avogadro's number. But wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate how much energy is needed per atom, and see if it's less than 40 kJ.

So, 40 kJ is the energy added. If the energy per mole is 735 kJ, then per atom, it's 735 kJ / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) = about 1.22e-20 J per atom. But wait, 735 kJ per mole is 735,000 J per mole. So per atom, (735,000 J/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ≈ 1.22e-18 J per atom.

Wait, that's a very small amount. 1.22e-18 J per atom is about 1.22e-18 J = 0.000122 nanojoules per atom. But the energy added is 40,000 J (40 kJ). That's 40,000 J. So, how many atoms can be ionized?

Wait, no. Wait, the energy per mole is 735 kJ. So for each mole, it takes 735 kJ. But we only have 40 kJ, which is much less than that. So, no, because the energy is not enough for even one mole of ionization. So, no ionization occurs.

Wait, but wait again. Another way: the number of moles of energy is 40 kJ. Since the first ionization requires 735 kJ per mole, what's the number of moles available?

Wait, the energy per mole is 735 kJ. So, moles of energy = 40 kJ / 735 kJ/mol ≈ 0.0544 mol. But since each mole has Avogadro's number of atoms, the number of atoms ionized would be 0.0544 mol * 6.022e23 atoms/mol = approximately 3.28e22 atoms.

Wait, but wait. Oh, no, because each mole is a mole of Mg atoms. So each atom requires a certain amount of energy. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute how much energy is required per atom and see if it's less than 40 kJ.

So, the first ionization energy is 735 kJ per mole. Which is 735,000 J per mole. So, per atom, that's 735,000 J / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ≈ 1.22e-18 J per atom.

Wait, but that's very small. Wait, but 40 kJ is 40,000 J. So the energy per atom is about 1.22e-18 J. So, 40,000 J is 40,000 / 1.22e-18 ≈ 3.28e23 atoms. Wait, that can't be right because that's more than a mole. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy per atom. Let's compute the energy per atom. The first ionization energy is 735 kJ per mole, so per atom, that's 735e3 J/mol divided by Avogadro's number, which is about 6.022e23 atoms/mol. So per atom, that's (735e3) / (6.022e23) ≈ 1.22e-18 J per atom.

But 40 kJ is 40,000 J. So, 40,000 J / (1.22e-18 J/atom) ≈ 3.28e22 atoms. Wait, but that's about 3.28e22 atoms ionized. But that's a huge number, but the number of atoms in 1 gram of Mg? Wait, Mg's molar mass is about 24.305 g/mol. So 1.00 g is about 0.0411 moles. So, 0.0411 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.474e22 atoms. So, 3.28e22 is more than that, but wait that can't be possible because the total atoms in 1 gram is about 2.47e22.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the energy per mole is 735 kJ. So, per atom, that would be 735,000 J / 6.022e23 atoms ≈ 1.22e-18 J per atom. So, each atom requires 1.22e-18 J to lose an electron (ionize to Mg²+). So, 40 kJ is 40,000 J. So the number of atoms that can lose an electron would be 40,000 / (1.22e-18) ≈ 3.28e22 atoms. But wait, the number of atoms in 1 gram of Mg is approximately 0.0411 moles, which is 0.0411 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.47e22 atoms. So, 3.28e22 is more than that. So, but the maximum number of atoms that can lose an electron is about 2.47e22. So, it's impossible to lose that many — wait, that can't be. That would mean all the atoms lose an electron, which is not possible because each requires 735 kJ per mole.

Wait, but wait, our energy is 40 kJ. So, even if all the atoms lose one electron, that would require 735 kJ. But 40 kJ is much less than that. So, no, no electrons can be removed. So, Mg remains as Mg atoms.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I got the ionization potentials wrong. Oh, the first ionization potential is Mg → Mg²+ requires 735 kJ per mole. So, to get Mg²+ from Mg, you need to remove one electron. So, each Mg atom requires 735 kJ to become Mg²+.

But the energy given is 40 kJ, which is way less than 735 kJ. So, it's impossible to remove any electrons. Therefore, all the Mg atoms remain as Mg atoms, and the energy doesn't cause any ionization.

Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of the second ionization? Because after losing the first electron, the second ionization is Mg²+ → Mg³+ requires 1447 kJ per mole.

But 40 kJ is way less than 1447 kJ. So, even if some electrons could be removed, it's not enough.

So, the final composition is 100% Mg atoms. So, the answer is option A.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option A says Mg atoms 100%, no ionization. Yes, that's correct.

Another way to think: 40 kJ is much smaller than all the ionization potentials. So, nothing happens. So, Mg remains as Mg atoms.

So, the correct answer should be A: Mg atoms 100%, no ionization.

The problem involves determining the final composition of a mixture after adding 40.0 kJ of energy to 1.00 gram of magnesium (Mg) atoms in the vapor state. The first ionization potential of Mg is 735 kJ/mol, and the second ionization potential is 1447 kJ/mol. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Required for Ionization**:
   - The first ionization energy (735 kJ/mol) requires 735,000 J per mole. For 1.00 gram of Mg (approximately 0.0411 moles), the energy needed to ionize one Mg atom is:
     \[
     \frac{735,000 \, \text{J/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}} \approx 1.22 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J/atom}.
     \]
   - The second ionization energy (1447 kJ/mol) requires 1,447,000 J per mole. For 1.00 gram of Mg, the energy needed to ionize one Mg atom is:
     \[
     \frac{1,447,000 \, \text{J/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}} \approx 2.39 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J/atom}.
     \]

2. **Comparison with Added Energy**:
   - The added energy is 40.0 kJ, which is 40,000 J.
   - Since the first ionization energy (735 kJ/mol) is much larger than the added energy (40 kJ), it is impossible to ionize any Mg atoms, as even one Mg atom would require 735 kJ of energy to become Mg²+.
   - Similarly, the second ionization energy (1447 kJ/mol) is also much larger than the added energy, so no Mg²+ ions can be formed.

3. **Final Composition**:
   - The energy added (40 kJ) is insufficient to ionize any Mg atoms. Therefore, the Mg atoms remain as they are, and no Mg²+ or Mg⁺ ions are formed.

### Conclusion:
The final mixture consists entirely of Mg atoms. This corresponds to **Option A: Mg atoms 100%, no ionization**.
