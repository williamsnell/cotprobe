Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is asking for another name for a hasty conclusion. The options are A through I, with E being "ad novitatem." Let me think about each term.

First, what does a hasty conclusion mean? It's when someone makes a quick, possibly irrational decision without sufficient evidence. So, the question is looking for a term that implies this hasty approach.

Option A: false cause. That's when someone concludes that one event caused another, but it's not necessarily true. It's more about correlation not causation, not necessarily hasty reasoning.

Option B: red herring. That's when someone misdirects attention by bringing something irrelevant. It's about confusion between relevant and irrelevant, so not related to hasty reasoning.

Option C: argumentum ad populum. That means arguing based on the popularity of an opinion. It's about the popularity of a belief, not necessarily the hasty conclusion.

Option D: jumping to a conclusion. This sounds exactly like hasty reasoning. It's when someone makes a quick, possibly incorrect judgment without much evidence.

Option E: ad novitatem. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about this one. I think this term refers to delaying the introduction of something new. Like, delaying a product launch because it's not ready yet. So, it's about delaying the introduction, which is a different concept.

Option F: slippery slope. This is a situation where a situation is so unstable that progress is difficult. It's more about a chain reaction rather than hasty reasoning.

Option G: straw man fallacy. This is when someone misrepresents someone else's argument as more clearly problematic than it actually is. It's about misrepresenting an argument to make it easier to attack, not about hasty reasoning.

Option H: post hoc ergo prompter hoc. This is a logical fallacy where someone assumes that because an event happened at a later time, it must be caused by an earlier event. Like, because it rained today, it must be that it caused the rain. This is about causation and causation order, which is different from hasty reasoning.

Option I: ad hominem. This is when someone attacks the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. It's about refuting the character, not about making a hasty conclusion.

So, looking back at the question, the correct term for hasty conclusion is D: jumping to a conclusion. Option E, ad novitatem, seems to be about delaying, not hasty reasoning. So the answer should be D.
