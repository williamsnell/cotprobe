Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillator and a standing wave. Hmm, I remember that when an oscillator is set up near a metal reflector, it produces standing waves. Oh right, the distance between adjacent nodes is called a half-wavelength, right? Because a node is a point where the amplitude is zero, so between two nodes is half a wavelength.

Wait, the problem says the distance between adjacent nodes is 65 cm. So that's half a wavelength. So the full wavelength would be twice that, which is 130 cm. But wait, wait a second. Oh no, no, actually, wait. Wait, no, no. Let me think again. No, wait: nodes are points where the string doesn't move. So between two nodes is half a wavelength. So the distance between adjacent nodes is half a wavelength. So, in this case, 65 cm is half of the wavelength. So the full wavelength is 130 cm.

The frequency of the oscillator is given as 2.3 × 10^8 Hz. Oh right, the frequency is the same as the frequency of the wave because it's a standing wave. So frequency f = 2.3e8 Hz.

Speed of light is what we need to find. Oh, right, the velocity v is equal to frequency times wavelength. So v = f * λ.

Wait, yes. So λ is 130 cm. So v should be 2.3e8 Hz multiplied by 130 cm.

Wait, but wait, the units. The velocity should be in cm per second. Because 65 cm is a length, and 130 cm is the wavelength. So 2.3e8 Hz *130 cm = ?

Let me calculate that. 2.3e8 *130 = 2.3 * 130 = 299, so 299e8 cm/s. Oh wait, because 130 is 1.3e2, so 2.3e8 * 1.3e2 = (2.3 *1.3) e(8+2) = 2.99e10 cm/s.

Wait, but wait, 2.3 times 130 is 299, yes. So 299e8 cm/s. But how does that convert to meters per second?

Wait, no. Because 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 299e8 cm/s is 299e8 * 0.01 m/s. Wait, because 1 cm/s is 0.01 m/s. So 299e8 cm/s = 299e8 * 0.01 m/s = 299e6 m/s. Wait, that can't be. Because light's speed is about 3e8 m/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute 2.3e8 Hz multiplied by 130 cm. So 2.3e8 Hz multiplied by 130 cm is 2.3 * 130 * 1e8 (Hz * cm) = 299e8 (cm * Hz). Wait, but cm * Hz is cm/s. So 299e8 cm/s. Now, to convert cm/s to m/s, since 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 cm/s = 0.01 m/s. So 299e8 cm/s = 299e8 * 0.01 m/s = 299e6 m/s. Wait, but that's way bigger than the speed of light. Because light's speed is about 3e8 m/s.

Wait, something's wrong. Because that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the distance between nodes. Let me re-examine the problem.

Ah, wait a second. No, wait. The distance between adjacent nodes is 65 cm. So that is the wavelength? Or is that twice the wavelength? Wait, no. Nodes are points where the amplitude is zero. So between two adjacent nodes, the distance is half a wavelength.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think: the wave has a node at one point, then a half wavelength before the next node. So for a standing wave, the distance between a node and the next node is λ/2. So the distance between adjacent nodes is half a wavelength. So my initial thought was correct: 65 cm = λ/2 → λ = 130 cm.

But then, using that, the speed v = f * λ. So v = 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm → 2.3e8 * 1.3e2 cm/s → 2.99e10 cm/s.

But wait, 2.99e10 cm/s is 299,000,000,000 cm/s → which is 2.99e10 cm/s. But wait, wait, 2.99e10 cm/s is 299,000,000,000 cm/s. To convert to m/s, 1 cm/s is 0.01 m/s. So 299e8 cm/s = 299e8 * 0.01 m/s = 299e6 m/s. Which is 299 million m/s. But that's way higher than the speed of light.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s, which is 300 million m/s. So 299 million is just a bit less than that. Hmm, but perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me do the calculation again. 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm. Let's compute 2.3 * 130. 2*130=260, 0.3 *130=39, so total 299. So 299e8 cm/s. Now, 299e8 cm/s is equal to 299e8 * 0.01 m/s = 299e6 m/s = 2.99e8 m/s.

Wait, but that's about 2.99e8 m/s, which is less than the speed of light (3e8 m/s). Oh wait, no, 2.99e8 is actually 299 million, and 3e8 is 300 million. So that would be 0.99% less than the speed of light. Which is correct, because the speed of light depends on the medium. Wait, but in this problem, are we dealing with air or another medium? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any medium. Oh, but wait, perhaps the setup is in a medium where the speed of light is different. So maybe the speed of the wave is c/n, which affects the wavelength.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the distance between nodes is λ/2. Because when considering a standing wave, the nodes and antinodes are set up in a particular way, but perhaps the condition is different. Alternatively, perhaps the distance between nodes is actually λ/2, making the wavelength 130 cm. So that part is correct.

But then, using v = f * λ, and with v being the speed in the medium. So v = 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm → 2.99e10 cm/s.

Wait, but in that case, the speed is 299e8 cm/s = 2.99e10 cm/s. Converting to m/s, 2.99e8 m/s. So that's 299 million m/s, which is 0.99% less than the speed of light (which is 3e8 m/s). Hmm.

But wait, looking at the options:

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 2.50e10 cm/sec. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2.99e10 cm/s is 2.99 x 10^10 cm/s. But the options are in the 1e9 to 1e11 range.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2.99 × 10^10 cm/sec → 2.99e10 cm/s.

B: 2.50 × 10^10 cm/sec.

C: 2.99 × 10^9 cm/sec.

D: 2.99 × 10^11 cm/sec.

E: 3.99 × 10^10 cm/sec.

F: 1.50 × 10^10 cm/sec.

G: 1.99 × 10^10 cm/sec.

H: 3.00 × 10^9 cm/sec.

I: 4.50 × 10^10 cm/sec.

J: 1.99 × 10^9 cm/sec.

So option A is 2.99e10 cm/s, which matches our calculation. But wait, our calculation is 2.99e10 cm/s, which is option A. But according to the problem, the speed of light is in the medium. Because in a medium, c_medium = c / n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum.

Wait, but in this problem, are we given any info about the medium? Because the problem doesn't specify that the wave is in a medium. Oh, wait, perhaps it's in a vacuum. Because otherwise, the speed would be c divided by the refractive index.

Wait, but the setup is near a metal reflector. Hmm, that would suggest that the wave is in a medium with a low refractive index. Because, for example, when a wave reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, it undergoes a phase change of π, which affects the standing wave pattern.

Wait, but in a vacuum, the speed of the wave would be c, the speed of light. But perhaps in this scenario, the medium has a refractive index, so the wave's speed is c/n.

Wait, so let's think again. The distance between adjacent nodes is 65 cm. So that's λ/2. So λ = 130 cm. The frequency is 2.3e8 Hz. So the speed of the wave in the medium would be v = f * λ.

Wait, but if the wave is in a medium with refractive index n, then the speed is v = c/n. So, in that case, v = (c/n) * λ. But wait, another approach: in a standing wave, the wavelength is different in different media. So perhaps the distance between nodes is the same as in a vacuum, but the speed is lower because it's in a medium.

But wait, no. The wavelength in a medium is longer than in a vacuum. Because v = f * λ → λ_medium = λ_vacuum / n.

Wait, but the distance between nodes is half the wavelength in the medium. So for a standing wave, the nodes are points where the displacement is always zero. So the distance between nodes is λ_medium / 2.

So, in this problem, the distance between nodes is 65 cm = λ_medium / 2 → λ_medium = 130 cm.

So v = f * λ_medium.

But wait, the speed of the wave in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. So in our case, v = (c/n) * (λ_medium) → v = (c/n) * (λ_medium).

But wait, earlier I thought that λ_medium = 2 * (node distance). So node distance is λ_medium / 2 = 65 cm → λ_medium = 130 cm.

So v = f * λ_medium → v = 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm → 2.99e10 cm/s.

Wait, but what's the value of c? The speed of light in vacuum is about 3e8 m/s. Which is 3e10 cm/s.

So, if v = c/n, then 2.99e10 cm/s = (3e10 cm/s) / n → n = 3e10 / 2.99e10 ≈ 1.00336 → approximately 1.0034. So, the refractive index is just a bit higher than 1, which makes sense for a metal reflector.

Wait, but why is the problem giving us the options in terms of cm/sec and not m/s? Oh, because the problem says: compute the velocity of light. Assuming that if the medium is air, then n is approximately 1. So, if the wave is traveling in air, then v = c → 3e8 m/s → 3e10 cm/s.

But according to our earlier calculation, v is 2.99e10 cm/s. So that would be 0.99% less than the speed of light in vacuum. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or my calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem states that the distance between adjacent nodes is 65 cm. So, for a standing wave, the distance between nodes is half a wavelength.

So λ = 130 cm.

f = 2.3e8 Hz.

v = f * λ → 2.3e8 * 130 = 2.99e10 cm/s.

Wait, that's right. But in that case, the speed of light is 2.99e10 cm/s, which is 2.99e8 m/s. But the speed of light in vacuum is about 3e8 m/s. So, this implies that the wave is in a medium with n ≈ 1.00336. But the problem doesn't specify the medium, so perhaps in this problem, the value is to be taken as 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but the options are in cm/s. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: 2.99e10 cm/s, B: 2.5e10, etc. So, our calculation gives option A, but the options also include 3e8 m/s, which is 3e10 cm/s. 

Wait, but what is the actual speed? Let's think: when a wave reflects at a boundary between two media, if the media have different refractive indices, a phase shift happens. So, for a metal reflector, maybe the wave is reflecting off a medium with a lower refractive index. So the phase shift would be 180 degrees, which affects the standing wave pattern.

Wait, but how does that affect the speed? Hmm, perhaps the phase shift doesn't affect the speed. The speed is determined by the medium, but in this problem, perhaps the wave is in air, so n=1.

So if the wave is in air, then c = 3e8 m/s → 3e10 cm/s.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation would give v = 3e8 m/s → 3e10 cm/s. Which would be option E: 3.99e10 cm/s. Wait, no, option E is 3.99e10 cm/s.

Wait, no, option E is 3.99e10 cm/s, which is 399 million cm/s. Wait, wait, no, 3.99 × 10^10 cm/s is 399e8 cm/s → which is 399,000,000,000 cm/s, which is 3.99e10 cm/s. 

But wait, in that case, v = 3e8 m/s → 3e10 cm/s. So that would be option E.

But wait, so why the confusion earlier? Because I thought the wavelength was 130 cm, leading to v = 2.99e10 cm/s. But perhaps the wave is in a medium with n=1, so that v is 3e8 m/s. But wait, that can't be right because the calculation leads to a speed of 2.99e10 cm/s, which is roughly 3e8 m/s (since 1 m = 100 cm → 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1e10 cm → 1e8 m.

Wait, but 2.99e10 cm/s is 2.99e8 m/s, which is 299 million meters per second. That's approximately 0.99 times the speed of light in a vacuum (c=3e8 m/s). So that implies that the medium has a refractive index n ≈ 1.00336.

But the problem doesn't specify the medium, so maybe I'm supposed to assume it's a vacuum. So if the wave is in a vacuum, then v = 3e8 m/s → 3e10 cm/s. So the speed is option E: 3.99e10 cm/s. But wait, 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s.

Wait, wait, 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s because 1 m is 100 cm → 3e8 m/s = 3e8 * 100 cm/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So, in that case, the correct velocity would be 3e8 m/s → 3e10 cm/s. So the answer would be option E.

But earlier I thought that the calculation gives 2.99e10 cm/s, but that would be 299 million cm/s. Which is 0.99 times 3e8 m/s (3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s). So 2.99e10 cm/s is 299 million cm/s, which is 0.9933 of 3e8 m/s (since 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s). So 2.99e10 cm/s is 2.99e8 m/s, which is 299 million meters per second. Which is 0.9933 times the speed of light.

But the problem is in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.99e10 cm/s, but I'm a bit unsure because in a vacuum, the speed would be 3e8 m/s, which is much faster than the speed of light in a medium.

Wait, but the problem says "compute the velocity of light." So perhaps the speed in the medium is considered, which is 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation would be 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm → 2.99e10 cm/s → 299 m/s? Wait, 2.99e10 cm/s is 2.99e8 m/s → 299 million meters per second. That's way faster than the speed of light. That can't be right.

Wait, no, wait, 2.99e10 cm/s is 2.99e8 m/s, because 1 cm/s = 0.01 m/s. So 2.99e10 cm/s = 2.99e10 * 0.01 m/s = 2.99e8 m/s.

But wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, which is 3 times 1e8. So 2.99e8 m/s is indeed very close to c, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute the speed in the medium as 3e8 m/s, which would make option E the correct answer.

But the problem doesn't mention the medium, so perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the wave is in a medium with n=1.00336, but that's complicating things.

Wait, but in the problem setup, the nodes are 65 cm apart, which is half the wavelength. So, lambda = 130 cm.

If the wave is in a vacuum, then v = c = 3e8 m/s. So 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s.

So, the correct answer would be option E: 3.99 × 10^10 cm/s. But wait, 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s, which is option E. So that would be the answer.

But wait, earlier I thought that the wave's speed is 2.99e10 cm/s, which is option A. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the speed in the medium: v = (c / n) * (lambda in medium).

Wait, lambda in medium is lambda_vacuum / n.

So, v = (c / n) * (lambda_vacuum / n) = c * lambda_vacuum / n².

Hmm, but that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, since the distance between adjacent nodes is 65 cm, the wavelength in the medium is 130 cm. So the wave speed in the medium is v = f * lambda.

Which is 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm = 2.99e10 cm/s.

But the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum.

So, perhaps the wave's speed in the medium is v = c/n, so then:

v = f * lambda_medium = f * (lambda_vacuum / n) = (c/n) * (lambda_vacuum / n) → No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the speed of the wave is v = f * lambda_medium, and lambda_medium is lambda_vacuum / n.

So, v = f * (lambda_vacuum / n) = (c/n) * (lambda_vacuum / n) → Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity in the medium is v = c/n. So, v = 3e8 m/s / n.

But the problem is that we don't know n. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the medium and compute the speed as 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but the problem says to compute the velocity of light, which suggests that it's in the medium.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave is in a medium with n=1. So, the speed is c.

So, v = c = 3e8 m/s → 3e10 cm/s.

Which is option E.

So, the correct answer would be option A if the wave is in a vacuum, option E if it's in a medium with n=1.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the medium. So perhaps the correct answer is to compute the speed in the medium as 3e8 m/s, which would be option E.

But wait, in that case, the calculation is v = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

Hmm, but earlier calculation leads to 2.99e10 cm/s. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm.

2.3e8 Hz → 230,000,000 Hz.

Multiply by 130 cm: 230,000,000 * 130 = ?

Wait, 230,000,000 * 130 = ?

Let's compute 230,000,000 * 100 = 23,000,000,000.

230,000,000 * 30 = 6,900,000,000.

Adding them together: 23,000,000,000 + 6,900,000,000 = 29,900,000,000.

So 29,900,000,000 cm/s = 2.99e10 cm/s.

Which is option A.

So, why is there a conflict between the two calculations?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Because in a standing wave, the nodes are fixed points. So if the wave is in a medium, the phase change upon reflection affects the standing wave pattern.

Wait, but the distance between nodes is half the wavelength, regardless of the medium. So, if the wavelength is 130 cm, then the distance between nodes is 65 cm, which is correct.

So, the calculation is correct. So, the speed of the wave is 2.99e10 cm/s, which is option A.

But then, why is the speed of light in a medium 3e8 m/s, which is 3e10 cm/s. But that would imply that the wave is in a medium.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the speed as 2.99e10 cm/s, which is 2.99e8 m/s.

Wait, 2.99e8 m/s is 299,000,000 m/s → which is 299 million m/s.

Which is 299,000,000 m/s, which is 299,000 km/h.

Wait, but the speed of light in a vacuum is 3e8 m/s (300 million m/s), which is 300,000 km/h.

So, the speed here is about 0.99 times the speed of light in vacuum. So, the medium is a bit denser than air, but not a conductor.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where n is the refractive index. So, in this problem, the speed is 3e8 m/s / n → but in our calculation, we have 2.99e8 m/s.

So, 2.99e8 m/s = (3e8 m/s) / n → n = (3e8 m/s) / (2.99e8 m/s) → n ≈ 1.00336.

So, the refractive index is about 1.00336, which would imply that the medium is a very slight increase in refractive index, perhaps due to a metal.

So, the calculation is correct. The speed of the wave in the medium is 2.99e10 cm/s, which is option A.

Wait, but the problem says to compute the velocity of light. Which is in a medium. So, the correct answer is option A.

But wait, then, why is there a possibility that the speed is 3e8 m/s? Because in a vacuum, light travels at 3e8 m/s. So, in that case, the speed is 3e8 m/s.

But the problem doesn't specify the medium, so maybe I'm supposed to assume it's a vacuum. So, the velocity of light would be 3e8 m/s, which is 3e10 cm/s.

So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the speed of the wave in the medium with the speed of light in a vacuum.

So, let me think again.

In a vacuum, the speed of light is c = 3e8 m/s.

In a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index.

In this problem, the wave is in a medium, and the distance between adjacent nodes is 65 cm, which is half the wavelength.

So, λ = 130 cm.

So, the wave's speed is v = f * λ.

Which is 2.3e8 Hz * 130 cm = 2.3e8 * 130 cm = 2.99e10 cm/s.

But in a medium, v = c/n. So, to find n, we have v = c/n → n = c/v.

So, n = (3e8 m/s) / (2.99e10 cm/s).

Wait, let's calculate that.

First, convert 3e8 m/s to cm/s: 3e8 m/s = 3e8 * 100 cm/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So, n = (3e10 cm/s) / (2.99e10 cm/s) → n ≈ 1.00336.

So, n is about 1.00336.

But in a vacuum, the speed of light is c = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So, the wave's speed in the medium is 2.99e10 cm/s, which is 0.999999 c.

But why is the problem considering the speed of light in a medium? Because in a vacuum, the speed of light is c, and in a medium, it's v = c/n.

So, the problem's setup suggests that the wave is in a medium, so the speed of light would be v, which is in the medium. So, the question is to compute v, which is 2.99e10 cm/s, option A.

But why is option E present? Because if the wave were in vacuum, then v would be 3e10 cm/s, which is option E.

But the problem doesn't specify the medium, so perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, so perhaps the confusion is that in a vacuum, the speed of light is 3e10 cm/s, but in the medium, it's 2.99e10 cm/s. So, the problem states to compute the velocity of light in the medium, which is option A.

So, the correct answer is option A: 2.99 × 10^10 cm/s.

But wait, earlier I thought that in a vacuum, the speed is 3e8 m/s, which is 3e10 cm/s. So, if the medium is air, then v would be 3e10 cm/s.

But the problem doesn't specify the medium, so perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the speed of light in a vacuum, which is 3e8 m/s, or 3e10 cm/s.

But in that case, the problem would have to specify that the wave is in a vacuum or a medium.

So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, given that the problem gives the options, and the correct calculation leads to option A, which is 2.99e10 cm/s, I think that is the correct answer.

Thus, the velocity of light is 2.99 × 10^10 cm/s, option A.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the velocity of light in a medium based on the distance between adjacent nodes in a standing wave. Here's the analysis:

1. **Understanding the standing wave**: In a standing wave, the distance between adjacent nodes is half the wavelength. Thus, if the distance between nodes is 65 cm, the wavelength \( \lambda \) is \( 130 \, \text{cm} \).

2. **Frequency and wave velocity**: The frequency \( f \) is given as \( 2.3 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz} \). The wave velocity \( v \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   v = f \cdot \lambda = (2.3 \times 10^8) \cdot (130) = 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s}.
   \]

3. **Refractive index consideration**: The wavelength in a medium is given by \( \lambda_{\text{medium}} = \lambda_{\text{vacuum}} / n \), where \( n \) is the refractive index. However, the problem does not explicitly require calculating the refractive index. The velocity of light in a medium is typically \( v = c / n \), but the problem's setup does not specify the medium. Instead, it implies the wave is in a medium, where the velocity of light is \( v = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \) (if in a vacuum) or \( v = 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \) (if in a medium with \( n \approx 1.00336 \)).

4. **Options analysis**: The options are:
   - A) \( 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \)
   - B) \( 2.50 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \)
   - C) \( 2.99 \times 10^{9} \, \text{cm/s} \)
   - D) \( 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \)
   - E) \( 3.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \)

   The correct calculation leads to \( 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \), which corresponds to **A**. However, if the wave were in a vacuum, the velocity would be \( 3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \), which corresponds to **E**.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the problem's setup and the provided options, the correct answer is **A**. If the wave were in a vacuum, the answer would be **E**. The confusion arises from the medium's refractive index, but the problem does not specify it, so **A** is the most appropriate choice.
