Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this personnel selection question. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the definition of the selection ratio in personnel selection. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that selection ratio has to do with how many people get selected versus how many are eligible or how many are trying to apply.

Option A says the ratio of successful to unsuccessful workers. Well, that sounds like it's about the outcomes of selection, not the actual number of people who were selected. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B is about the number of successful selected workers compared to the difficulty level of the job. The difficulty level of the job might affect how many people are suited for it, but selection ratio is more about the ratio of selected to unselected. Like, if you have more people who are selected, the ratio would be higher. So I don't think B is correct.

Option C mentions percent of correctly placed in the group. That sounds more like a placement rate or accuracy, not the ratio of selection. So probably not C either.

Option D suggests the ratio of the number of workers needed to the number of applicants available. Wait, that sounds more like a need-to-capacity ratio or something similar. Like, how many people are needed and how many are available. That fits with selection ratio because it's about how many people are selected relative to the applicants. So D might be the correct answer.

Putting it together: Selection ratio is the number of selected workers divided by the number of applicants, or maybe the successful ones over unsuccessful. D matches that, so I think D is the right answer.
