Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a dentist using a concave mirror to look at a filling in the tooth. Hmm, concave mirrors... I remember they have different properties. The question is asking for the magnification of the image. 

Let me think. The radius of curvature is given as 4 cm. Wait, right, the radius of curvature for a concave mirror is positive, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculations here. Oh, wait, the formula for magnification involves the object distance and the focal length. Right, because magnification for mirrors is generally given by m = -image distance / object distance, so m = -v/u.

But wait, the mirror is concave, so the focal length is positive. The radius of curvature is twice the focal length, so the focal length f would be half of that. Oh wait, radius R is 4 cm, so f = R/2. So f is 2 cm. But wait, concave mirrors have positive f, so that's correct.

Now, the dentist is holding the mirror 1.5 cm from the filling. Wait, does that mean the object distance is 1.5 cm? Or is the mirror placed at 1.5 cm from the object? Hmm, yes, I think the object is 1.5 cm in front of the mirror. So object distance u is 1.5 cm. But wait, wait—I should double-check. In mirror problems, the object is on the same side as the incoming light. So the dentist's filling is the object, and the mirror is the mirror. So the object is placed 1.5 cm in front of the mirror. So u is positive in sign conventions.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the sign conventions for mirrors, the object distance is positive if the object is in front of the mirror (which it is, the filling is in front). So u is 1.5 cm. The focal length f is 2 cm. So using the mirror equation 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Let me plug in the numbers. 

So 1/2 = 1/1.5 + 1/v. Wait, wait, let me compute that. 1/2 is 0.5, 1/1.5 is approximately 0.6667. So 0.5 = 0.6667 + 1/v. Wait, that can't be right because 0.6667 is bigger than 0.5, so 1/v would be negative. That would imply v is negative, which would mean the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. But for a concave mirror, when the object is placed within the focal length (since f=2 cm and u=1.5 cm < 2 cm), the image is virtual and upright, and magnified.

Wait, let me calculate the mirror equation properly. 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So f is 2 cm, u is 1.5 cm. Let's compute 1/v.

1/v = 1/f - 1/u. Wait, no: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So rearranging, 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. Oh wait, no, the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So 1/v = (1/f) - (1/u). So substituting:

1/v = (1/2) - (1/1.5) 

Compute each term: 1/2 is 0.5, 1/1.5 is approximately 0.6667.

So 0.5 - 0.6667 = -0.1667. So 1/v is -0.1667. Which means v is 1 / (-0.1667) = approximately -6 cm.

So the image distance is negative, which implies it's a virtual image, located behind the mirror (since v is negative), but wait, no—wait, conventions are that for mirrors, a positive v would be behind the mirror, a negative v would be in front. Wait, maybe I have the sign conventions wrong. Let me double-check.

In mirror problems, if the image is in front of the mirror (positive v), it's real. If it's behind (negative v), it's virtual. So in this case, v is -6 cm. So the image is behind the mirror, virtual. 

Now, the magnification is m = -v/u. So substituting v = -6 cm and u = 1.5 cm. 

m = - (-6) /1.5 = (6)/(1.5) = 4. So m is positive 4.

So the image is four times the size of the object, and since it's virtual, it's upright. So the question is about the magnification, so the answer is 4 times the size of the object.

Looking at the options, option A says 4 times. So the answer should be A.

To determine the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we use the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- Radius of curvature \( R = 4 \, \text{cm} \), so the focal length \( f = \frac{R}{2} = 2 \, \text{cm} \).
- Object distance \( u = 1.5 \, \text{cm} \) (since the dentist holds the mirror 1.5 cm from the filling).

### Step 2: Solve for the image distance \( v \)
Using the mirror equation:
\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{1.5}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{v} = 0.5 - 0.6667 = -0.1667
\]
\[
v = \frac{1}{-0.1667} = -6 \, \text{cm}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the image is virtual and located behind the mirror.

### Step 3: Calculate the magnification \( m \)
The magnification is given by:
\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}
\]
Substitute \( v = -6 \, \text{cm} \) and \( u = 1.5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
m = -\frac{-6}{1.5} = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4
\]

The magnification is positive, indicating that the image is upright and four times the size of the object.

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The magnification of 4 times the size of the object corresponds to **Option A**.
