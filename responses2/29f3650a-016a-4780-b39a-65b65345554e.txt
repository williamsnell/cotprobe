Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question says: Two events occur at the same place in an inertial reference frame S, and they are separated by a time interval of 3 seconds. Now, we're looking at another inertial reference frame S', and in that frame, the two events are separated by a time interval of 5 seconds. The question is asking for the spatial separation between these two events in frame S'. The options are given from A to J, each with different numerical values.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with spacetime intervals and inertial frames, the key is to use the Lorentz transformation equations. But wait, the problem is about the spatial separation, so maybe I should think about the proper time or something related to the spacetime interval.

Wait, the spacetime interval is invariant, right? Oh yes, the spacetime interval (squared) between two events is given by s² = c²Δt² - Δx². And this quantity remains the same in all inertial frames. So s² must be the same in both S and S'.

Wait, but in this problem, both events are at the same place in S. So Δx would be zero in S. Then in S, the time interval is 3 seconds. So the spacetime interval squared would be c²*(3)^2 - 0 = c²*9.

But in S', the time interval is 5 seconds. So S' also has the same s². So in S', the spacetime interval squared is c²*(5)^2 - (Δx')².

But wait, since the two events are at the same place in S, what does that say about S'? Are they still at the same place in S' or not? Because the problem doesn't specify. Wait, no, the question is about the spatial separation between the two events in S'. So in S, the two events are at the same place, so their spatial separation is zero. But in S', their spatial separation could be non-zero because the frames are different.

Wait, but no, that's not correct. The proper spatial separation is zero in S because they're at the same place. But in S', the separation could be non-zero because the events might not be at the same place in S'. Because the problem doesn't state that. Wait, the question says, "the spatial separation between these two events in an inertial reference frame S'". So are the two events still at the same place in S'?

No, the problem doesn't specify that. Wait, no, the problem doesn't say anything about their spatial separation in S'. So the question is about the spatial separation in S' between these two events, regardless of their position in that frame.

Wait, the original problem: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the options are numbers, but the last letter is your answer. So the correct answer is one of the options, and I have to pick which number it is, but the last letter of the response must be the chosen letter.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the events. In S, both events are at the same place, so Δx = 0. The time separation is 3s. So in S, the events are at the same place, so the spatial separation is zero. But in S', the time separation is 5s. So the question is about the spatial separation in S'.

Wait, but the problem is about the spatial separation in S', not the time separation. So what's the relationship between the two frames?

Actually, wait, the situation is that two events are at the same place in S, so their time in S is t1 and t2, with Δt = 3s. The same two events in S' have a time separation of Δt' =5s.

But what about their spatial separation? Because in S, Δx =0. In S', the spatial separation could be non-zero because S and S' are different frames.

Wait, but because the two events are at the same place in S, their separation in S is zero. But in S', their separation is not necessarily zero. So the question is, what is the spatial separation in S'?

Wait, but the problem is about the separation between the two events. So in S, they are at the same place: their spatial separation is zero. But in S', maybe their separation is non-zero. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the events are at the same place in S' or not. So how can we compute the spatial separation between them in S'?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that in S, the events are at the same place, so the spatial separation is zero. So the events are at the same point in four-dimensional space in S.

But when we change frames to S', their separation in space could be non-zero. So perhaps the question is, what is the possible spatial separation between them in S', given that their time separation in S' is 5 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The problem's question is: "what is the spatial separation between these two events in an inertial reference frame S'?" So we need to find the spatial separation, which is a spatial quantity, not a temporal one. So in S', the two events could be at different positions, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the events are not at the same place in S', so their separation isn't zero.

But wait, the question doesn't specify whether the two events are at the same place in S'. Oh wait, it does say: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the events are at the same place in S, but in S', their positions could be at different places.

Wait, so the problem is not about their spatial separation, but perhaps about how their time and space relate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum possible separation or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again: the problem gives the two time intervals, 3s in S and 5s in S'. What is the spatial separation in S'?

Wait, but the initial condition is that the two events are at the same place in S. So their spatial separation in S is zero. So the events are at the same place in S, but possibly different places in S'.

Wait, but the question is about the spatial separation between them in S', which is different. So perhaps the question is about the maximum possible spatial separation in S' given the time differences, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the events as being events in four-dimensional spacetime. Let's model them as events with coordinates (t, x, y, z) in frame S. Since both events are at the same place, the y and z coordinates for both are the same in S, so y1 = y2, z1 = z2, but their x coordinates could be different.

In S, the time separation between the two events is 3s. So t2 - t1 = 3s. Since the x separation is zero, the other coordinates are same.

In S', which is another inertial frame, the events are separated by a time interval of 5s. Let's assume that in S', the two events are at different places. So the time difference is (t2' - t1') =5s.

We need to find the spatial separation in S', which would be sqrt( (x2' -x1')^2 ), but since the question is about the separation, perhaps the maximum possible is considered. But wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the events are moving relative to each other, so the spatial separation in S' is calculated using the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation equations. Let me recall them.

In the Lorentz transformation, the time and space coordinates transform between frames moving at velocity v relative to each other.

The Lorentz transformation equations are:

t' = γ (t - (v x)/c² )

x' = γ (x - v t )

y' = y
z' = z

And γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But I'm not sure if I need to use these equations to find x'.

Wait, but the problem gives the time intervals in S and S'. So perhaps we can relate the time intervals in both frames to find the velocity of S' relative to S, and then use that to find the spatial separation.

Wait, but the time intervals in S and S' are given. Let me think: the events are at the same place in S, which is perhaps frame S. So in S, the two events are at the same x coordinate, so Δx = 0.

In S, the time between events is 3 seconds, so Δt =3 s.

In S', the time is 5 seconds, so Δt' =5s.

Wait, but the problem is about the spatial separation in S', which is the separation between the two events as observed in S'. Since in S, they are at the same place, but in S', they may be at different places.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the spatial separation between the two events in S', which is the separation of their positions in the same frame, not the time interval. So the question is, what's the separation in space between the two events as measured in S'?

But wait, perhaps the question is about the maximum possible separation or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about the separation, but about the time interval.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the speed of the frame S' relative to S.

Wait, perhaps the events are considered to be in different positions in S, but in the same place in S. So the frame S' is moving with velocity v relative to S. Then, the time difference in S' would be affected by the velocity.

Wait, but in this problem, the two events are at the same place in S, so their separation in S is zero. So in S', the separation could be non-zero, depending on the relative motion.

Wait, the problem is asking for the spatial separation in S', which would depend on the relative velocity. But without knowing the relative velocity, perhaps the problem expects us to find the maximum possible separation, or perhaps think about the product of the time intervals.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the four-vector approach. The invariant interval is s² = c²(t2 - t1)² - (x2 - x1)^2 = c²(t2' - t1')² - (x2' - x1')².

Since both events are at the same place in S, x2 -x1 =0. So s² = c²*(3)^2 = 9c².

In S', the time interval is 5s, so s² = c²*(5)^2 - (Δx')².

But since s² is the same in both frames, we have:

9c² = c²*(5)^2 - (Δx')^2

Wait, solving this:

9c² = 25 c² - (Δx')²

So (Δx')² =25c² -9c² =16c² → Δx' =4c.

But wait, wait, wait a second. That's Δx' squared equals 16c², so Δx' is 4c. But wait, the options are in terms of 1e8 m, so 4c would be 4*3e8 m, which is 1.2e9 m. But looking at the options, I don’t see that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute (Δx') in terms of the speed of light.

Wait, let me recompute:

s² = c² (Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2.

In S, Δt=3s, Δx=0. So s² =c²*(3)^2 =9c².

In S', Δt'=5s. So,

s² = c²*(5)^2 - (Δx')^2.

Set them equal: 9c² =25c² - (Δx')² → (Δx')² =25c² -9c²=16c² → Δx' =4c.

So 4c m/s. But c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 4c is 1.2e9 meters. But the options are in terms of 1e8 m.

Wait, but let's see the options again. The options are given as 1e8 m, 2e8, etc. So 1.2e9 m is 12e8 m. Looking at the options, option E is 12 × 10^8 m. So Δx'=12e8 m.

But wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's compute 4c. c is about 3e8 m/s.

So 4 * 3e8 = 1.2e9 m. But the options don't have 1.2e9. Oh wait, the options are A:6e8, B:8e8, C:10e8, D:3e8, E:12e8, F:0, G:14e8, H:16e8, I:5e8, J:2.4e8.

Hmm, 1.2e9 is 12e8. So the answer would be E. But wait, the problem says the two events are separated by 3s in S and 5s in S'. But wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. So the spatial separation is 4c, which is about 1.2e9 m. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 12e8 m. That's 1.2e9, so the answer is option E.

Wait, but wait another moment. The problem says the two events are at the same place in S. So in S, their separation is zero. But in S', their separation is 4c.

But let's think about how S' is moving relative to S. The proper time is the time experienced by the events in their own rest frame. Wait, but in this case, in S, the events are at the same place, so their proper time is zero. Because proper time is the time measured between two events in the frame where they are at rest relative to each other.

Wait, so the proper time τ is zero in S. Then, since the proper time is same in all frames, the proper time in S' is also zero. So the events are at the same point in S', which means their spatial separation in S' is zero. But that can't be right because we calculated (Δx') as 4c.

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. If the proper time is zero, then the events are at the same place in their own frame, but their frame could be moving relative to S. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the proper time between two events is the time between them in the frame where they are at rest. So in S, the events are at the same place, so the proper time is zero because the time in that frame is zero. Then, the proper time in S' is also zero, so the events are at the same place in S'. Thus, their spatial separation in S' is zero. But that's conflicting with the earlier calculation.

Wait, that's confusing. So according to the invariant interval approach, the spatial separation in S' is 4c, but according to the proper time approach, it's zero. So what's the issue here?

Ah, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

We have:

In S, Δt =3s, Δx=0. So s² = (3c)^2.

In S', Δt'=5s. So s² = (5c)^2 - (Δx')^2.

Set equal:

(3c)^2 = (5c)^2 - (Δx')^2 → 9c² =25c² - (Δx')² → (Δx')² =16c² → Δx' =4c.

So 4c ≈ 1.2e9 m, which is option E (12e8 m). But that's in the options.

But why does the proper time approach say it's zero? Because proper time is zero only if the events are at rest relative to each other in their own frame.

Wait, so in S, the events are at the same place, so their proper time is zero. But in S', the events are moving relative to each other, so their proper time is also zero. So their separation in S' is zero, but according to the invariant interval, it's 4c. How can both be true?

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up between proper time and the spacetime interval. The proper time is the time in the frame where the two events are at rest. So if two events are at the same place in S, their proper time is zero. But in S', they may not be at the same place, but the proper time would also be zero.

Wait, no. The proper time is zero only if the events are at the same place and time in that frame. So if in S, the events are at the same place, then in any other frame, their proper time would not be zero unless they're at the same place in that frame too.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The proper time τ is the time experienced by the events in their own rest frame. So if in S, the events are at the same place and same time, their proper time is zero.

But in S', the events may have different times or positions, but the proper time remains zero. That doesn't make sense because if the events are moving relative to each other, their proper time in their own frame is zero, but in another frame, their separation is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I should resort to the Lorentz transformation again. Let me consider the frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S, along the x-axis.

In frame S, the events are at (t, x) = (t, 0). So x =0.

In frame S', the events have coordinates (t', x').

Using the Lorentz transformation:

t' = γ (t - (v x)/c² )

x' = γ (x - v t)

But x=0 in S, so:

t' = γ t

x' = - γ v t

So,

Δt' = t' - t = γ t - t = t (γ -1 )

Δx' = x' - x = -γ v t - 0 = - γ v t

So,

Δt' = t (γ -1 )

Δx' = - γ v t

Now, we can express v in terms of the speeds.

But we can also find v in terms of γ.

We know that v = c (1 - 1/γ² )

Hmm, perhaps I can relate the two.

But let me think about the time intervals.

In frame S, Δt =3s.

In frame S', Δt' =5s.

So,

5s = γ (3s) - 3s (1 - 1/γ² )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the other equations.

Wait, from the Lorentz transformation, since x=0 in S, then:

t' = γ t

x' = - γ v t

So,

Δt' = γ t - t = t (γ -1 )

Δx' =- γ v t

So,

Δx' = - γ v t

But from the original frame S, Δt =3 s = t, so t=3s.

So,

Δt' = γ (3s) - 3s = 3 s (γ -1 )

Δx' = - γ v (3s )

But we're interested in the relationship between Δt' and Δx'.

We can rearrange to find the speed v.

From Δt' =3 s (γ -1 )

And from Δx' = -3 s γ v

So,

Δx' = -3 s γ v

So,

v = - Δx' / (3 s γ )

Wait, but this seems like trying to find v in terms of the knowns, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocity v in terms of the given time intervals.

We have:

Δt' =3s (γ -1 )

Δx' = -3 s γ v

So,

v = -Δx' / (3 s γ )

But from Δt' =3s (γ -1 ), we can express γ in terms of v.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the velocity v in terms of the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the speed of the frame S' relative to S.

Wait, perhaps the events are considered to be in different frames, but the problem is about the separation in S'.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think differently.

In the problem, the two events are at the same place in S. So in S, the two events are at the same location. So the time between the events is 3s. So in S, the spatial separation is zero.

In S', the two events have a time separation of 5s. So the spatial separation in S' would be the separation between the two events in the same frame.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the events are at the same place in S'. So perhaps the only thing we can calculate is the separation in space, which is the spatial component of the separation in four-dimensional space.

Wait, but in the four-vector approach, the separation between events is given by s² = c² (Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2.

So, s² is invariant, so it's the same in all frames.

So, in S, s² = c² (3s)^2 =9 c².

In S', s² = c² (5s)^2 - (Δx')^2.

Set them equal:

9 c² =25 c² - (Δx')²

→ (Δx')² =25 c² -9 c² =16 c²

→ Δx' =4 c.

c is 3e8 m/s, so 4c is 1.2e9 m, which is 1.2e9 m.

Looking at the options, option E is 12e8 m, which is 1.2e9 m. So the answer should be option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the events are at the same place in S, but in S', they are at different places, but the problem is about the separation between the two events in S', which is the spatial separation.

Wait, no, the spatial separation between the two events is a frame-dependent quantity. So in S, the separation is zero (same place). In S', the separation is 4c, which is 1.2e9 m, but in the options, the closest is option E, which is 12e8 m.

So the correct answer is E.

But wait, let me think again. The problem states that the two events are separated by 3s in S and 5s in S'. So what's the spatial separation between the two events in S'?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the four-vector approach. The four-vector (ct, x) is invariant under Lorentz transformations. So for the two events:

In S: (c*3, 0)

In S': (c*5, x')

So, the invariant interval is:

s² = (c*3)^2 - (0)^2 =9 c²

s² = (c*5)^2 - (x')² =25 c² - (x')²

Set them equal:

9 c² =25 c² - (x')²

→ (x')² =16 c² → x' = ±4c.

So, the separation in S' is 4c, which is 1.2e9 m.

Looking at the options, option E is 12 ×10^8 m, which is 1.2e9 m. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the proper time approach would say that the separation in S' is zero, but that's only when the events are at rest in their own frame. But in this case, the events are at rest in S, so their proper time is zero. But in S', they could be moving, so their separation isn't zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the separation in space but the time interval, but the question is about the spatial separation.

But I think I'm getting mixed up here. Let me try to wrap this up.

After working through the problem, I've determined that the spatial separation between the two events in S' is 4c, which is 1.2e9 m. Looking at the options, this corresponds to option E: 12 ×10^8 m.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The problem involves two inertial reference frames, \( S \) and \( S' \), and the concept of spacetime intervals. The spatial separation between two events is determined by the invariant interval \( s^2 = c^2 \Delta t^2 - (\Delta x)^2 \), which is the same in all inertial frames. 

### Key Analysis:

1. **In \( S \):**  
   The two events are separated by \( \Delta t = 3 \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta x = 0 \). The spacetime interval is:  
   \[
   s^2 = c^2 (\Delta t)^2 - (\Delta x)^2 = c^2 (3)^2 = 9c^2
   \]

2. **In \( S' \):**  
   The two events are separated by \( \Delta t' = 5 \, \text{s} \). Using the invariant interval, we have:  
   \[
   s^2 = c^2 (\Delta t')^2 - (\Delta x')^2 = c^2 (5)^2 - (\Delta x')^2
   \]

3. **Equating \( s^2 \):**  
   Since \( s^2 \) is the same in both frames, we equate the expressions:  
   \[
   9c^2 = 25c^2 - (\Delta x')^2
   \]
   Solving for \( (\Delta x')^2 \):  
   \[
   (\Delta x')^2 = 25c^2 - 9c^2 = 16c^2 \implies \Delta x' = 4c
   \]

4. **Numerical Calculation:**  
   The speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting this:  
   \[
   \Delta x' = 4 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.2 \times 10^9 \, \text{m}
   \]
   This corresponds to \( 12 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \).

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The spatial separation between the two events in \( S' \) is \( 12 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \), which matches option **E**.

### Final Answer:
**E**
