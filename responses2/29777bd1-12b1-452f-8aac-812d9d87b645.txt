Okay, so I've got this problem here about a typewriter and some discounts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the price is $80, and there are series discounts of 20%, 10%, and 5%. I need to find the net price after applying these discounts.

Hmm, I remember that series discounts are often applied successively, meaning each discount is applied to the price after the previous discount has been subtracted. So first I take the original price and apply the first discount, then take that result and apply the second, and so on.

Let me list the discounts: 20%, 10%, and 5%. Wait, but the order might matter. Are the discounts 20%, then 10% off the new price, then 5% off the second new price? I think so, yes. So I should apply each discount one after the other, starting with 20%, then 10%, then 5%.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of multiplying the remaining percentages. Because each discount reduces the price, so each subsequent discount is applied to the already discounted price.

So the first discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Then the second discount is 10%, so the customer pays 90% of the already discounted price. And the third discount is 5%, so the customer pays 95% of the second discounted price.

Alternatively, I can calculate it step by step. Let's see:

First discount: 20% off. So 20% is subtracted from 100%, leaving 80%. 80% as a decimal is 0.8. So the price after the first discount is $80 * 0.8.

Let me compute that: 80 * 0.8 is 64. So now the price is $64 after the first discount.

Second discount is 10% off. So 10% off means 90% remains. 0.9 * 64. Let me calculate that: 64 * 0.9 is 57.6. So now the price is $57.60.

Third discount is 5% off. So 95% remains, which is 0.95. 57.60 * 0.95. Hmm, let me do this multiplication. 57.60 * 0.95. Well, 57.60 * 0.95 is the same as 57.60 * (1 - 0.05) = 57.60 - (57.60 * 0.05). 57.60 * 0.05 is 2.88. So 57.60 - 2.88 = 54.72.

Wait, is 54.72 one of the options? Let me check the options again. Yes, option E is $54.72. So that's the net price.

Alternatively, I can calculate each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original price: $80.

After 20% discount: 80 * (1 - 0.20) = 80 * 0.80 = 64.

After 10% discount: 64 * (1 - 0.10) = 64 * 0.90 = 57.60.

After 5% discount: 57.60 * (1 - 0.05) = 57.60 * 0.95 = 54.72.

Yes, that's correct. So the net price is $54.72, which is option E.

The net price after applying the discounts is calculated by successively multiplying the remaining percentages of each discount. After applying a 20% discount, the price becomes $64; after a 10% discount, it decreases to $57.60; and finally, applying a 5% discount brings it down to $54.72.

Answer: E
