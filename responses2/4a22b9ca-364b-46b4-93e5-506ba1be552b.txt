Okay, so I need to answer this question about nonverbal and primarily nonculturally biased abilities. Hmm, let me think about what each option refers to.

I remember that "cognitive abilities" is a broad term, covering a lot of areas like reasoning, problem-solving, etc. But the question specifically mentions nonverbal and nonculturally biased. So nonverbal abilities can refer to things like spatial reasoning or pattern recognition, which are more about seeing and understanding things visually or through shapes.

Wait, the options include fluid intelligence, which I think is about reasoning and problem-solving, often tested in IQ tests. Abstract reasoning is similar, dealing with patterns and logic. Specific abilities might be more targeted, like memory or attention. 

Cognitive abilities are a general term, so maybe that's broader than what the question is asking for. The question is about abilities that are primarily non-verbal and non-culturally biased, so maybe they're looking for something more specific than general cognitive skills.

Looking at the options, option C is abstract reasoning. Abstract reasoning is about solving problems using logic and reasoning without relying on language, which aligns with nonverbal and not tied to culture. Fluid intelligence is another term, but fluid might refer to something that changes or is dynamic, which might not fit as directly as abstract reasoning.

So the correct answer should be abstract reasoning because it's about nonverbal and culturally neutral, focusing more on logical thinking and problem-solving abilities without cultural context.
