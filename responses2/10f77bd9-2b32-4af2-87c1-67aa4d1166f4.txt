Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about related party transactions. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which event indicates the existence of related party transactions. Related parties are typically those who have a direct business relationship with the entity in question. So, events that involve these parties would point to such transactions.

Looking at the options:

A: Purchasing office supplies from a vendor at market value. That sounds like a direct purchase, so probably not related parties.

B: Insuring the lives of key executives and listing the entity as beneficiary. I don't remember exactly what 'benefittee' means here. But if it's about insuring executives, maybe it's about their liability? Not sure if that's a related party.

C: Selling real estate at a price that differs significantly from its appraised value. This seems like an unusual event. Typically, selling at a different value might indicate a transfer of value, but perhaps it's not related. Wait, but if a company sells a property at a price different from its market value, that's unusual. I'm not sure about this one.

D: Selling products to customers at market value. This is a direct sale, so probably not involving related parties.

E: Paying dividends to all shareholders at the same rate. Dividends are distributions, but that's a cash transfer. Unless it's a stock dividend, but that's a different matter. Doesn't sound like a transaction involving related parties.

F: Receiving a loan from a bank at the standard interest rate. Receiving a loan is a direct transfer, so not a related party.

G: Making a loan with specific scheduled terms for repayment. This sounds like a scheduled transfer. Maybe like a loan agreement with a specific schedule for repaying, meaning the entity is loaning money to another party. So, this would involve a related party, the lender.

H: Paying standard salaries to employees. This is a direct transfer, so probably not related.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about related party transactions. So, which of these involve a direct business relationship?

Option G is about making a loan. Typically, when a company borrows money from another entity (like a bank or another company), it's a related party because it's making a financial instrument with a specific term. So, this would indicate a related party.

Option C: Real estate sold at different value. That seems like a transaction involving a third party, not a related party. Because selling at a different value might be a sale with a different price, not necessarily a transfer of a business relationship. Unless it's about the possibility of the transaction being for a different reason, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a transaction involving a transfer, but not necessarily a related party. Like, if the company sells a property at a price different from its market value, that might indicate that the entity is selling it to someone else, but not necessarily a related party. Unless it's a conveyance, like a conveyance that's not a direct transfer. I'm not certain about this.

So, the correct event is G: Making a loan with specific terms. Because that's a direct transfer to another entity, indicating a related party.
