Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates and collisions between reactants. Let me try to figure it out.

The reaction is A + B â†’ C + D. The question is about how tripling or quadrupling the concentrations of A and B affects the number of collisions between them. Oh wait, the options are A to J, each giving two numbers for (a) and (b).

Hmm, I remember something about the collision theory. The number of collisions depends on the concentrations because when you increase concentration, there are more molecules in each solution. So, more molecules means more collisions.

Wait, but how exactly does concentration affect the number of collisions? Let me think. The concentration is moles per liter, right? So if you triple the concentration of A, the number of A molecules per liter becomes three times higher. Same with B. Because when you triple the concentration, the number of molecules increases by a factor of three each.

Now, when two molecules react, each molecule of A can collide with each molecule of B. So the number of collisions would be the product of their concentrations. So for part (a), tripling each concentration would mean the collisions would be multiplied by 3 * 3 = 9. Let me jot that down: for (a), 9 times.

But wait, what about part (b), which is quadrupling the concentrations? Then the number of collisions would be 4 (from A's concentration) times 4 (from B's concentration), which is 16 times. So (b) is 16 times.

Now, looking at the options. I need to find the one where (a) is 9 times and (b) is 16 times. Let's see the options:

Option D says (a) 9 and (b) 16. So that's the one I think.

To determine the effect on the number of collisions when tripling or quadrupling the concentrations of A and B, consider that the number of collisions is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reacting species. Tripling each concentration multiplies the collisions by \(3 \times 3 = 9\), and quadrupling each concentration multiplies the collisions by \(4 \times 4 = 16\). 

From the options provided, the correct choice is **D: 9 times and 16 times**, as it matches the calculated effects.

Answer: D
