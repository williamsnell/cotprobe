Okay, so I have this equation to solve: sqrt(x² + x + 1) + sqrt(2x² + x +5) = sqrt(x² -3x +13). I need to find all the real roots and return them in ascending order. The answer options are given from A to J, but I'm not sure what's correct yet.

Hmm, let's see. First, I know that when dealing with square roots, the expressions inside must be non-negative. So I'll need to find the domain where all the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative.

Let's look at each square root term:

1. sqrt(x² + x + 1)
2. sqrt(2x² + x +5)
3. sqrt(x² -3x +13)

I can start by checking the domain for each.

For the first one, x² + x +1: the discriminant is 1² -4*1*1 = 1 -4 = -3, which is negative. That means x² +x +1 is always positive, so no restrictions here.

Second term: 2x² +x +5. Discriminant is 1² -4*2*5 = 1 -40 = -39. Also negative, so 2x² +x +5 is always positive. No restrictions here.

Third term: x² -3x +13. Discriminant is (-3)^2 -4*1*13 = 9 -52 = -43. So this is always positive, too. 

So the domain is all real numbers. That's good, no restrictions on x.

Now, the equation is sqrt(x² +x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5) = sqrt(x² -3x +13). I need to solve for x.

One approach is to square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But that might get complicated. Let me think about the order of operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move some terms around. Let's see.

Let me denote A = sqrt(x² +x +1), B = sqrt(2x² +x +5), and C = sqrt(x² -3x +13). The equation is A + B = C.

If I square both sides, I get (A + B)^2 = C². Expanding the left side: A² + 2AB + B² = C².

Now, substituting the expressions:

A² = x² +x +1

B² = 2x² +x +5

C² = x² -3x +13

So left side becomes (x² +x +1) + 2AB + (2x² +x +5) = C².

Adding A² and B²: x² +x +1 +2x² +x +5 = 3x² +2x +6. So left side is 3x² +2x +6 + 2AB.

Set equal to C², which is x² -3x +13.

So equation becomes 3x² +2x +6 + 2AB = x² -3x +13.

Let me bring all terms to one side. Subtract x² -3x +13 from both sides:

3x² +2x +6 +2AB -x² +3x -13 = 0.

Simplify: (3x² -x²) + (2x +3x) + (6-13) + 2AB = 0 → 2x² +5x -7 + 2AB =0.

Hmm, so 2AB = -2x² -5x +7 → AB = (-2x² -5x +7)/2.

But AB is the product of sqrt(x² +x +1) and sqrt(2x² +x +5). So AB = sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)}.

So the equation becomes:

sqrt{(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)} = ( (-2x² -5x +7) ) / 2.

Wait, but the right side is (-2x² -5x +7)/2. Let me factor out a negative sign: (-1)(2x² +5x -7)/2 → so it's -(2x² +5x -7)/2.

Wait, but the left side is sqrt, which is non-negative, so the right side must also be non-negative. Therefore:

-(2x² +5x -7)/2 ≥ 0 → (2x² +5x -7)/2 ≤ 0 → 2x² +5x -7 ≤ 0.

So 2x² +5x -7 ≤0. Let's find the roots of the quadratic equation 2x² +5x -7=0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 +56)]/(2*2) → sqrt(81)=9 → x=(-5 ±9)/4.

So x = (4/4)= 1, and x=(-14/4)=-3.5.

So the quadratic 2x² +5x -7 is ≤0 between x=-3.5 and x=1.

So the domain where the equation is possible is x ∈ [-3.5, 1]. But wait, earlier all expressions were positive, so x can be anywhere, but when we square, we have to consider that the RHS is non-positive, which restricts x to between -3.5 and 1.

So now, the equation sqrt{(x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5)} = ( -2x² -5x +7 ) /2.

But the RHS is negative or zero. So the left side is sqrt, which is non-negative. So the RHS must be ≥0. So the equation can only be valid where RHS is ≥0.

Which is x between -3.5 and 1.

So, now, let's square both sides again to eliminate the square root. So:

Left side squared: (x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5) → which is x²*(2x²) + ... but perhaps I should multiply it out.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

So, square both sides:

AB^2 = [ ( -2x² -5x +7 ) / 2 ]^2.

Which is [ (-2x²-5x+7)^2 ] /4.

But AB squared is (x²+x+1)(2x²+x+5). So:

(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5) = [ (-2x² -5x +7)^2 ] /4.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:

4(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5) = (-2x² -5x +7)^2.

Now, expand both sides.

First, expand the left side: 4*(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5).

Let me compute (x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5).

Multiply term by term:

x² * 2x² = 2x^4.

x² * x = x^3.

x² *5 =5x².

x * 2x² = 2x^3.

x *x =x².

x *5=5x.

1*2x²=2x².

1*x =x.

1*5=5.

Now add all these terms together:

2x^4 + x^3 +5x² + 2x^3 +x² +5x +2x² +x +5.

Combine like terms:

2x^4.

x^3 +2x^3 =3x^3.

5x² +x² +2x²=8x².

5x +x=6x.

+5.

So (x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)=2x^4 +3x^3 +8x² +6x +5.

Multiply by 4: 8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20.

Now the right side: (-2x² -5x +7)^2.

Expanding this: (a+b+c)^2 where a= -2x², b=-5x, c=7.

= a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.

a²= (−2x²)^2=4x^4.

b²= (−5x)^2=25x².

c²=7²=49.

2ab=2*(-2x²)(-5x)= 20x^3.

2ac=2*(-2x²)(7)= -28x².

2bc=2*(-5x)(7)= -70x.

So adding all together:

4x^4 +25x² +49 +20x^3 -28x² -70x.

Combine like terms:

4x^4.

20x^3.

25x²-28x²= -3x².

-70x.

+49.

So the right side is 4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49.

So now, the equation is:

Left side (after expansion) = 8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20.

Set equal to right side: 4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49.

Wait, no: the original equation after expansion is 8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20 = 4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49.

Wait, wait, no: the equation is 4*(left side) = right side, so:

8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20 =4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49.

Bring all terms to the left side:

8x^4 -4x^4 =4x^4.

12x^3 -20x^3 = -8x^3.

32x² +3x²=35x².

24x +70x=94x.

20 -49= -29.

So the equation becomes:

4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29 =0.

So now, I have a quartic equation: 4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29 =0.

Solving quartic equations is tricky. Maybe I can factor this or find rational roots.

Let me check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 29 (constant term) over factors of 4 (leading coefficient). So possible roots are ±1, ±29, ±1/2, ±29/2, etc.

Let me try x=1: 4(1)^4 -8(1)^3 +35(1)^2 +94(1) -29 =4-8+35+94-29= (4-8)= -4; (-4+35)=31; (31+94)=125; 125-29=96≠0.

x=-1: 4(1) -8(-1) +35(1) +94(-1) -29 →4 +8 +35 -94 -29 = (4+8)=12; 12+35=47; 47-94=-47; -47-29=-76≠0.

x=29 seems too big, perhaps x=1/2: 4*(1/2)^4 -8*(1/2)^3 +35*(1/2)^2 +94*(1/2) -29.

Compute each term:

4*(1/16) =1/4=0.25.

-8*(1/8)= -1.

35*(1/4)=8.75.

94*(1/2)=47.

Constant term -29.

Sum: 0.25 -1= -0.75; -0.75 +8.75=8; 8 +47=55; 55-29=26≠0.

x= -1/2: 4*(1/16) -8*(-1/8) +35*(1/4) +94*(-1/2) -29.

Compute each term:

4*(1/16)=0.25.

-8*(-1/8)=1.

35*(1/4)=8.75.

94*(-1/2)= -47.

-29.

Adding: 0.25 +1=1.25; 1.25+8.75=10; 10-47= -37; -37-29= -66≠0.

Hmm, maybe x=1/4.

Compute 4*(1/4)^4 -8*(1/4)^3 +35*(1/4)^2 +94*(1/4) -29.

4*(1/256)= 1/64 ≈0.0156.

-8*(1/64)= -0.125.

35*(1/16)= 2.1875.

94*(1/4)=23.5.

-29.

Sum: 0.0156 -0.125= -0.1094; -0.1094 +2.1875≈2.078; 2.078 +23.5=25.578; 25.578 -29≈-3.422≠0.

Hmm, perhaps x=2 is a root?

x=2: 4*(16) -8*(8) +35*(4) +94*(2) -29.

4*16=64.

-8*8= -64.

35*4=140.

94*2=188.

-29.

Sum:64-64=0; 0+140=140; 140+188=328; 328-29=299≠0.

x= -2: 4*(16) -8*(-8) +35*(4) +94*(-2) -29.

4*16=64.

-8*(-8)=64.

35*4=140.

94*(-2)=-188.

-29.

Sum:64+64=128; 128+140=268; 268-188=80; 80-29=51≠0.

Hmm, not promising. Maybe x= 5/2 or other fractions. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor this quartic.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in expanding the terms. Because this seems complicated.

Another approach: going back to the original equation.

sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) = sqrt(C).

Let me consider possible substitutions.

Wait, another approach is to make a substitution to simplify. Let me let y = x + a, where a is chosen to eliminate the linear term. Or perhaps try to find a substitution that simplifies the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the geometric interpretation of the equation. But that might be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the left and right sides.

Let me double-check the expansion of the left side.

Left side: 4*(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5) → which is 4*(2x^4 +x^3 +5x² +2x^3 +x² +5x + 2x² +x +5) → 4*(2x^4 +3x^3 +8x² +6x +5) → 8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20.

Right side: (-2x² -5x +7)^2 = (−2x²)^2 + (−5x)^2 +7^2 + 2*(-2x²)(-5x) + 2*(-2x²)(7) + 2*(-5x)(7).

Wait, that would be 4x^4 +25x² +49 + 20x^3 -28x² -70x.

Wait, 4x^4 +20x^3 + (25x² -28x²)= -3x² + (-70x) +49.

So the right side is 4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49.

So when I set 8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20 = 4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49.

Subtracting R.H.S from L.H.S:

8x^4 -4x^4 =4x^4.

12x^3 -20x^3 = -8x^3.

32x² - (-3x²) → 32x² +3x² =35x².

24x - (-70x) →24x +70x=94x.

20-49=-29.

So yes, the equation is 4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29 =0.

So I had to solve that quartic. Maybe factoring is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the original equation and see if I can find a substitution, like u = sqrt(x² +x +1), etc.

Wait, let me consider sqrt(x² +x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5) = sqrt(x² -3x +13).

Let me think about the right side: sqrt(x² -3x +13). Let me see if that can be rewritten. x² -3x +13 = (x - 3/2)^2 + (13 - (9/4)) ) → (x - 1.5)^2 + (13 - 2.25) = (x-1.5)^2 + 10.75.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let x = y, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the equation and think about possible solutions.

Looking at the options, perhaps the roots are 1 and -2, but let's test them.

Wait, let me try x=1 in the original equation.

sqrt(1^2 +1 +1) = sqrt(3).

sqrt(2*(1)^2 +1 +5) = sqrt(2+1+5)=sqrt(8)=2√2.

So LHS = sqrt(3) + 2√2 ≈1.732+2.828≈4.56.

RHS: sqrt(1 -3*1 +13)=sqrt(1-3+13)=sqrt(11)≈3.316.

So 4.56 ≈3.316? No, that's not correct. So x=1 is not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the original equation.

Assume that the equation holds. So:

sqrt(x² +x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5) = sqrt(x² -3x +13).

Let me square both sides again:

[ sqrt(x² +x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5) ]^2 = (x² -3x +13).

Which gives: (x² +x +1) + 2*sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} + (2x² +x +5) = x² -3x +13.

As I did earlier. So that leads to the quartic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find if the quartic can be factored into quadratics.

Assume that 4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29 can be written as (ax² +bx +c)(dx² +ex +f).

But that's a lot of variables. Let me think of a simpler approach. Let me assume that the quartic factors into (2x² + a x + b)(2x² + c x + d). Since the leading coefficient is 4.

So, 4x^4 + (2c + 2a) x^3 + (ac + 2d + 2b) x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd = 4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29.

So equate coefficients:

x^4: 4 → correct.

x^3: 2c + 2a = -8 → c + a = -4.

x^2: a c + 2d + 2b =35.

x: a d + b c =94.

constant: b d = -29.

So, let's try to find integers a, b, c, d that satisfy these.

From the constant term: b d= -29. So possible pairs (b,d) are (1, -29), (-1,29), (29, -1), (-29,1).

Let me try b=29, d=-1.

Then, b d= -29.

So, from the x term: a d + b c =94 → a*(-1) +29*c =94 → -a +29c=94.

From x^3: a + c = -4.

So, let me write:

From x^3: a = -4 -c.

Substitute into x term equation: -(-4 -c) +29c =94 →4 + c +29c =94 → 4 +30c=94 → 30c=90 → c=3.

So c=3, then a =-4 -3= -7.

Now, check x^2 coefficient: a c + 2d + 2b.

a c = (-7)(3)= -21.

2d= 2*(-1)=-2.

2b=2*29=58.

So total: -21 -2 +58=35. Which matches x^2 coefficient.

So yes, so the quartic factors as (2x² +a x +b)(2x² +c x +d) where a=-7, b=29, c=3, d=-1.

So the quartic factors as (2x² -7x +29)(2x² +3x -1).

So the equation is (2x² -7x +29)(2x² +3x -1)=0.

So setting each factor to zero:

First factor: 2x² -7x +29=0.

Discriminant: D=49 -232= -183 <0. So no real roots.

Second factor: 2x² +3x -1=0.

Discriminant: D=9 +8=17>0. So two real roots.

Solutions: x = [ -3 ± sqrt(17) ]/(2*2) → [ -3 ± sqrt(17) ] /4.

Which is (-3 + sqrt(17))/4 and (-3 - sqrt(17))/4.

Compute numerical values:

sqrt(17)≈4.123.

So, first root: (-3 +4.123)/4≈(1.123)/4≈0.2808.

Second root: (-3 -4.123)/4≈(-7.123)/4≈-1.7808.

So the roots are approximately x≈0.2808 and x≈-1.7808.

Wait, but looking back at our quartic equation, which is 4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29 =0, which factors into (2x² -7x +29)(2x² +3x -1)=0.

So the roots of the quartic are the roots of 2x² +3x -1=0, which are x=(-3±sqrt(17))/4, and the other two roots from 2x²-7x+29=0, which are complex.

So the real roots are x=(-3+sqrt(17))/4 and x=(-3-sqrt(17))/4.

Now, to find which of these satisfy the original equation, I need to check.

But wait, earlier when I tried x=1, which is not one of the roots, the equation didn't hold.

So perhaps these roots are the solutions.

So the answer options are:

A. [ -1, 0 ]

B. [ -2, -1 ]

C. [ -3, -2 ]

D. [ -1.7808, 0.2808 ]

So let me compute the numerical values:

(-3 + sqrt(17))/4 ≈( -3 +4.123 )/4≈1.123/4≈0.2808.

(-3 - sqrt(17))/4≈(-3 -4.123)/4≈-7.123/4≈-1.7808.

So the real roots are approximately x≈-1.7808 and x≈0.2808.

Looking at the options, the correct option is D: [ -1.7808, 0.2808 ].

So the answer is D.
</think>

The given equation is:

$$
\sqrt{x^{2} + x + 1} + \sqrt{2x^{2} + x + 5} = \sqrt{x^{2} - 3x + 13}
$$

We square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

$$
(\sqrt{x^{2} + x + 1} + \sqrt{2x^{2} + x + 5})^{2} = (\sqrt{x^{2} - 3x + 13})^{2}
$$

Expanding the left side:

$$
x^{2} + x + 1 + 2\sqrt{(x^{2} + x + 1)(2x^{2} + x + 5)} + 2x^{2} + x + 5 = x^{2} - 3x + 13
$$

Simplify and combine like terms:

$$
3x^{2} + 2x + 6 + 2\sqrt{(x^{2} + x + 1)(2x^{2} + x + 5)} = x^{2} - 3x + 13
$$

Move all terms except the square root to the right side:

$$
2\sqrt{(x^{2} + x + 1)(2x^{2} + x + 5)} = -2x^{2} -5x +7
$$

Square both sides again to eliminate the square root:

$$
4(x^{2} + x + 1)(2x^{2} + x + 5) = (-2x^{2} -5x +7)^{2}
$$

Expanding both sides:

Left side:
$$
4(2x^{4} + 3x^{3} + 8x^{2} + 6x + 5) = 8x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 32x^{2} + 24x + 20
$$

Right side:
$$
4x^{4} + 20x^{3} - 3x^{2} - 70x + 49
$$

Set the left side equal to the right side:

$$
8x^{4} + 12x^{3} + 32x^{2} + 24x + 20 = 4x^{4} + 20x^{3} - 3x^{2} - 70x + 49
$$

Subtract the right side from the left side:

$$
4x^{4} - 8x^{3} + 35x^{2} + 94x - 29 = 0
$$

This quartic equation factors into:

$$
(2x^{2} - 7x + 29)(2x^{2} + 3x - 1) = 0
$$

The quadratic \(2x^{2} - 7x + 29 = 0\) has a negative discriminant, so no real roots.

The quadratic \(2x^{2} + 3x - 1 = 0\) has roots:

$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{17}}{4}
$$

Numerically, these roots are approximately:

$$
x \approx 0.2808 \quad \text{and} \quad x \approx -1.7808
$$

The correct interval containing these roots is:

$$
[-1.7808, 0.2808]
$$

Thus, the answer is:

**ANSWER:** D
