Okay, so I have to figure out which of these activities are NOT secondary economic activities. I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through each option step by step.

First, I should understand what a secondary economic activity is. From what I remember, secondary activities are those that take place after the primary activity is completed. Primary activities are the ones that happen before, like the raw materials being processed. Secondary activities are where the products are further developed or used in their intended purpose.

Looking at the options:

A: Sewing shirts. That sounds like a finished product. You start with fabric, which is a primary activity, then sew it into a shirt, which is a secondary activity. So A is not the answer.

B: Assembling automotive parts. That sounds like a job you do after the car parts are available. Like, you might take apart a car to figure out what parts are needed, which is a secondary activity. So B isn't the answer either.

C: Building houses. That's definitely a secondary activity. After purchasing materials and getting the permits, building the house is a step that happens after the initial materials are ready.

D: Mining copper. That's an extraction process. Extracting copper from ore is a primary activity, but mining itself isn't until it's extracted. So D is a primary activity, not secondary. So D is a candidate for a non-secondary activity.

E: Brewing beer. That's a process where you take ingredients and make a beer. So it's a secondary activity because you start with raw materials, process them, and then make the product. So E is not the answer.

F: Manufacturing furniture. That's another production activity. You start with materials, put them together, and then build furniture. So F is a secondary activity.

G: Processing food. Processing food involves turning food into something else, like cooking it or making it more flavorful. So that's a secondary activity.

H: Binding books. That's a publishing step. You write the book, edit it, then bind it. So it's a secondary activity.

So the options that are not secondary are D and maybe any others. Wait, let me double-check. The question is asking which are NOT secondary. So D is mining copper, which is a primary activity. So D is the correct answer because it's a primary activity, not a secondary one.

The correct answer is D: Mining copper. Mining is a primary economic activity as it involves extracting raw materials, while mining copper is a step that follows this extraction. 

Answer: D
