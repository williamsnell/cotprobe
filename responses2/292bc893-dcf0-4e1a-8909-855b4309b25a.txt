Okay, so I've got this problem here about linear transformations. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that T is a linear transformation from R^2 to R^2. So it's a function that takes a 2D vector and maps it to another 2D vector, and it's linear. 

The problem gives me two points that T maps to specific other points. Specifically, T maps (1, 2) to (2, 3) and (-1, 2) to (2, -3). Then the question is asking where T maps the point (2, 1). I need to find which of the options A through J is the correct answer.

Wait, since it's a linear transformation, I remember that it's defined by how it acts on a basis. So if I can express the given points in terms of the standard basis vectors, maybe I can figure out the transformation matrix.

Let me think. The standard basis for R^2 is the vectors e1 = (1, 0) and e2 = (0, 1). But wait, in the given problem, the points are (1,2) and (-1,2). So maybe I can express these as combinations of e1 and e2. 

Alternatively, maybe I can set up equations based on the linearity of T. Since T is linear, T(a*u + b*v) = a*T(u) + b*T(v) for any vectors u, v and scalars a, b.

So, let me denote T(1,2) = (2,3) and T(-1,2) = (2,-3). Let's write T as a matrix. Let T be represented by matrix A, so that T([x; y]) = A * [x; y].

So, if I write the transformation matrix A as [a b; c d], then:

A * [1; 2] = [2; 3] => [a*1 + b*2; c*1 + d*2] = [2;3]

Similarly, A * [-1; 2] = [2; -3] => [a*(-1) + b*2; c*(-1) + d*2] = [2; -3]

So, writing out the equations:

First equation:
a + 2b = 2
c + 2d = 3

Second equation:
- a + 2b = 2
- c + 2d = -3

Wait, that's two sets of two equations each. Let's solve the first system for a and b.

From the first equation: a = 2 - 2b.

Plug into the second equation: -(2-2b) + 2b = 2 → -2 + 2b + 2b = 2 → 4b =4 → b=1.

So a = 2 - 2*1 = 0.

So a=0, b=1.

Now for the second system:

From first equation: -a + 2b = 2 → -a + 2*1 =2 → -a=0 → a=0.

Which matches the earlier a=0.

Second equation: -c + 2d = -3 → -c + 2d = -3.

But wait, let's see if c and d are the same as before. In the first transformation, the matrix was [0 1; c d]. Wait, wait, I think I might have gotten the equations wrong. Let me re-calculate.

Wait no, the first equation is from T(1,2) = (2,3). So the first row of A is [a, b], so:

a*1 + b*2 = 2 → a + 2b = 2.

Second equation: c*1 + d*2 =3 → c + 2d =3.

Then the second transformation is (-1, 2) → (2, -3). So:

a*(-1) + b*2 = 2 → -a + 2b = 2.

c*(-1) + d*2 = -3 → -c + 2d = -3.

So solving the first set:

From equation 1: a = 2 -2b.

Equation 2: - (2 - 2b) + 2b = 2 → -2 + 2b + 2b =2 → -2 +4b=2 → 4b=4 → b=1.

Then a=2-2(1)=0.

Now the second set:

Equation 3: -a + 2b =2 → -a +2(1)=2 → -a=0 → a=0.

Equation 4: -c +2d =-3.

But in the first set, c and d are still unknowns. Wait, but in the first equation, the sum is c +2d=3. So from this, we have two equations for c and d, but only one equation (since equation 4 is -c +2d =-3.

Wait, equation 3 is -a +2b =2 → a=0, b=1. Then equation 4 is -c + 2d = -3.

But from the first transformation, the sum is c + 2d =3 → c=3 - 2d.

Substitute into equation 4: -(3 - 2d) + 2d = -3 → -3 +2d +2d = -3 → -3 +4d = -3 → 4d=0 → d=0.

Then c=3 -2(0)=3.

So the matrix A is:

[0 1;

3 0]

Wait, so A is:

a=0, b=1,

c=3, d=0.

Wait, let me check. So A is [0 1; 3 0].

Let me test if this works.

Compute A*(1,2): [0*1 +1*2; 3*1 +0*2] → [2;3], which matches T(1,2)=(2,3).

Compute A*(-1,2): [0*(-1)+1*2; 3*(-1)+0*2] → [2; -3], which matches T(-1,2)=(2,-3).

So the matrix is correct.

Now, the question is to find T(2,1). So let's compute A*(2,1):

First component: (0*2) + (1*1) = 0 +1=1.

Second component: (3*2) + (0*1) =6 +0=6.

Wait, so T(2,1)= (1,6), which is option G.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, A is:

0 1

3 0

So [2;1] is x=2, y=1.

Compute:

a*x + b*y = 0*2 +1*1 =1.

c*x + d*y =3*2 +0*1=6.

So yes, (1,6) is the result, which is option G.

The problem involves determining the linear transformation \( T \) that maps specific points and finding its action on another point. By setting up equations based on the given mappings and solving for the transformation matrix \( A \), we compute \( T(2, 1) \) as \( (1, 6) \), which corresponds to option G.
