Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal propensities to save and consume. I need to figure out which option is correct based on the given information. Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms.

The question says that disposable income is $10,000 and consumption spending is $8,000. For every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. So, I need to find the marginal propensity to save (MPS) and see which options match that.

Marginal propensity to save is the change in savings divided by the change in disposable income. Wait, but the change in disposable income is $100 here, and the saving increases by $10. So, the change in saving is 10, and change in income is 100. So, the marginal propensity to save would be 10 / 100, which is 0.10. 

Wait, so that would make the marginal propensity to save 0.10. Let me check the options. Oh, looking at the options, I see option H says marginal propensity to save is 0.10, and option F is the marginal propensity to consume is 0.10. 

But wait, the question is asking about the marginal propensity to save, not consume. So, what's the relationship between these? I remember that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) plus the marginal propensity to save (MPS) equals 1. Because when income increases, the total change in spending is MPC*(delta Y) + MPS*(delta Y) = delta C + delta S. But delta (C + S) should equal delta Y, so 1 = MPC + MPS. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the MPC is the proportion of additional income that is spent on consumption. So, if disposable income increases by $100, and MPC is 0.10, then the MPC is 0.10, meaning that 10% of the additional income is consumed. So, the rest, 90%, would be saved. That would mean the marginal propensity to save is 0.90. Because 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.

Wait, but earlier I thought the marginal propensity to save was 0.10. Now I'm confused. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. So, saving is 10, income is 100, so 10/100 = 0.10, which is the marginal propensity to save. So, that would mean the answer is H: marginal propensity to save is 0.10.

But wait, another way. If the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.10, then the marginal propensity to save should be 1 - 0.10 = 0.90. But according to the question, the marginal propensity to save is 0.10. So, this would mean that the MPC is 0.90, but the question isn't asking about MPC, it's asking about MPS.

So, the question is about MPS, which is 0.10. So, the correct option is H. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, what's the question again? The question states that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. So, the marginal propensity to save is 10/100 = 0.10. So, option H says the marginal propensity to save is 0.10. So, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The options given are A to H. The options are about either MPC or MPS. So, the correct answer is H.

The question asks for the marginal propensity to save (MPS) based on the given information. 

The marginal propensity to save is calculated as the change in saving divided by the change in disposable income. Here, for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. Thus, the MPS is 10/100 = 0.10. 

Looking at the options, option H states that the marginal propensity to save is 0.10. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
