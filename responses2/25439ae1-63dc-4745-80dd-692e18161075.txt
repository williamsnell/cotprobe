Okay, so I have this real estate question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to property law, but I'll do my best to figure this out.

The scenario involves a couple living together in Los Angeles. They're engaged to be married but got a land on a hillside. The deed they signed says it's not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Hmm, okay, so that means they're joint tenants, but without any ownership rights beyond that. So, they can't claim ownership over the property, which is good because the boyfriend is selling it.

Then, the boyfriend offers to sell the property to his co-worker. But here's the twist: the boyfriend doesn't know the student was his partner, he forged the student's name on the deed. He sells it to the co-worker for $150k, which is the fair market value. The co-worker then records the deed. The question is about the ownership after this.

Options: The options are about who owns the property now. Let's think about the law here. The main points are:

1. The original deed: The couple is joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, their names are joint tenants, but no joint ownership. So, they can't claim title; their right of survivorship allows them to pass away, and the property continues to be owned by others.

2. The co-worker buys the property for $150k, same as the original deed's price. So, the co-worker is buying the property for the same price as it was originally valued.

Wait, but the original deed's price is not mentioned. Hmm, but the co-worker paid $150k, which is the fair market value. So, is the property now valued at $150k?

Wait, but the original deed's price isn't given. So, the original deed was not for sale. Because the deed says it's not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, the original deed is just a conveyance of the property. The co-worker bought it for $150k, which is the same as the original price. So, maybe the property is now valued at $150k, but the original price wasn't specified.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think. If the original deed was for a certain price, and the current price is the same, but the original price isn't given, then the co-worker paid $150k, which is the same as the current market value. So, the co-worker's deed is for $150k now.

But wait, the question says the co-worker recorded the deed. So, the co-worker's deed is valid. So, the co-worker has the right to use the property.

Now, what about the joint ownership? The original deed didn't create any ownership beyond what the joint tenants can claim. So, the co-worker bought the property for $150k, same as the original price. So, is the original deed's price irrelevant here?

Wait, no. The original deed's price is the price set by the couple as the fair market value. But the co-worker bought it for $150k, same as the original price. So, the co-worker is purchasing the property at the original price, which is now the market value. But the original deed doesn't create a new price; it's just a transfer.

So, the co-worker is purchasing the property at the original price, which is the same as the current market value. So, he's getting the property for the same price it was originally sold. Now, the co-worker is the owner now.

But wait, the question is about the ownership after the co-worker bought the property. So, the original deed was for the property, but they are now joint tenants with right of survivorship, but without any ownership beyond that. But the co-worker bought it for the same price, so he owns it now.

Wait, but I thought the original deed was not for sale. Because the deed says it's not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, it's a conveyance, not a sale. So, the grantor (the couple) don't have the right to sell the property. The co-worker is buying it, so it's a private sale.

But when the co-worker buys it, he gets the right to use the property as if it's his own. So, he's a joint tenant with right of survivorship. But since he bought the property for the same price, he now owns it.

Wait, but the original deed was not for sale, so the original grantor couldn't sell it. The boyfriend is the one selling it, but he's not the original grantor. So, the co-worker bought it for the same price, so he owns it now.

But wait, the original deed was not for sale, so the deed is just a transfer. So, the co-worker gets the property, but the original deed's right of survivorship applies to them. So, when the co-worker buys it, he's now a joint tenant with right of survivorship, but he's also the owner because he bought it for the same price.

Wait, but the original deed says it's not as tenants in common, but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, the joint tenants can't claim ownership. So, the original deed doesn't create any right of ownership.

Now, the co-worker bought it for the same as the original price. So, he's a joint tenant with right of survivorship. But he's now owning the property. So, the right of survivorship applies to him because he's a joint tenant.

Wait, but the original deed doesn't create any ownership. So, how can he now own it? Because the original deed is not for sale, so the co-worker is purchasing it, so he becomes the owner. But since the original deed was not for sale, the co-worker's ownership doesn't require any other ownership beyond that.

Wait, but the question is about the ownership. Let me think again. The original deed is just a transfer, so the co-worker has the right to use the property as a joint tenant with right of survivorship. But he bought it for the same price as the original deed's price. So, he's now the owner.

But wait, in real property, if you buy an existing property, you don't have to own it. So, the right of survivorship allows the joint tenants to pass away, and the property continues to be owned by others. But if you buy the property, you become the owner. But in this case, the original deed was for the property, but it's not a sale. So, the co-worker is purchasing it, so he's now owning it.

Wait, but the original deed was for a price that's not specified. So, the co-worker paid for it at the same price as the original price. But the original deed wasn't for sale, so the co-worker can't claim ownership rights. So, the co-worker buys it for the original price. So, he's now the owner of the property, but the original deed didn't create any ownership.

Wait, but the question is about the title. So, the property was originally a joint tenancy. But the co-worker bought it. So, when the co-worker buys it, he's now a joint tenant with right of survivorship. But since he bought it for the same price, he's the owner. So, he's a joint tenant with right of survivorship, but since he owns the property, does that mean he's now the owner?

Alternatively, maybe the original deed didn't create any ownership, so the co-worker didn't have any right of survivorship. But he bought the property for the same price as the original price, so he's now owning it.

Wait, but the original deed wasn't for sale, so he's not a seller. The co-worker is buying it, so he's purchasing the property. So, he's now a joint tenant with the right of survivorship. But since he's the owner, does he have any ownership rights?

Wait, no. Because the right of survivorship allows the joint tenants to pass away, and the property continues to be owned. But the joint tenants can't own the property; they can only claim ownership in the event of their death. So, if the co-worker dies, the property still belongs to the other joint tenant. But if he owns the property, he doesn't have any right to sell it.

Wait, but the co-worker bought the property for $150k, which was the same as the original price. So, he's now the owner. But the original deed was not a sale. So, the right of survivorship applies to the joint tenants. So, if he now owns it, he cannot claim any ownership rights.

Wait, no. The right of survivorship allows the joint tenants to pass away, but doesn't grant ownership. So, if the co-worker owns it, he doesn't have any right to sell it. But here, the co-worker sold it to the co-worker, so he's the owner. Wait, but that's a sale, which wasn't authorized by the original deed.

Wait, but the original deed said it's not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, the original deed doesn't create any ownership, just a transfer. So, the co-worker buys it for the same price, so he's now the owner.

But the original deed was not for sale, so he can't sell it. So, the co-worker is purchasing it, but not selling it, so he's the owner.

Wait, but when the co-worker buys the property, he's not the original grantor. So, the original grantor (the couple) doesn't have any rights to sell the property. The co-worker is the one who is selling it to the co-worker. So, the co-worker is the seller, and the buyer is the same person. So, the co-worker is the owner now.

Wait, but the original deed didn't create any ownership. So, the co-worker bought the property, so he's now the owner. But that's conflicting with the right of survivorship. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the right of survivorship applies to the joint tenants. So, the co-worker, as a joint tenant, can pass away, but the property continues to be owned by the other joint tenant. But the co-worker is now the owner, so he can't pass away and the property isn't owned by anyone else. So, that's a contradiction.

So, perhaps the co-worker bought the property for the same price as the original price, but because the original deed didn't create any ownership, the co-worker is now owning the property. So, he is the sole owner, but the original deed didn't create it. But the right of survivorship would allow him to pass away without any right to sell.

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship doesn't apply here because the co-worker bought it. Or maybe the right of survivorship is about what the joint tenants can claim upon death, but not ownership.

Alternatively, if the co-worker bought the property, he's the owner, but the original deed didn't create any ownership, so he's now the sole owner. But that would mean the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the owner.

Wait, but the original deed was not a sale. So, the co-worker didn't have the right to sell it. So, he's purchasing it, so he's the owner, but the original deed didn't create any ownership. So, the co-worker has the right to use the property as a joint tenant, but since he owns it, he can't sell it.

Wait, but that can't be right. The co-worker can't sell it because the original deed didn't create any ownership. So, the sale is unauthorized. So, the co-worker is just buying the property, so he's the owner, but the original deed was not for sale.

So, in that case, the right of survivorship applies to the joint tenants, but the co-worker is the owner, so he isn't a survivor. That's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the original deed didn't create any ownership. So, the co-worker doesn't have any right of survivorship. So, he can't claim ownership. But he he's buying the property, so he's the owner. But that can't be because the original deed didn't create ownership, so he can't sell it.

Wait, the situation is a bit tricky. Let me try to think again.

The original deed was a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. So, upon death, if one of the joint tenants dies, the property continues to be owned by the other joint tenant. But the original deed doesn't create any ownership, just a transfer.

Then, the co-worker buys the property for the original price, which is the same as the market value. So, he's purchasing it at market value. Now, he's the owner.

Wait, but the original deed didn't create any ownership, so he can't sell it. So, he's the owner, but the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the owner. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the right of survivorship applies to the original grantor's joint tenants. So, the original grantor's joint tenants can't claim ownership. So, the co-worker, as a joint tenant, can't claim ownership because the original deed didn't create it. But he's buying the property, so he's the owner.

Wait, but that's a contradiction. If the co-worker is now an owner, why would he be a joint tenant with right of survivorship? Or is the right of survivorship a right of the joint tenants to continue ownership, but not ownership itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the right of survivorship applies to the original grantor's joint tenants, but the co-worker is now the sole owner. So, the co-worker owns the property and has the right to continue it, but the original deed didn't create ownership. Wait, but the original deed didn't create ownership, so the co-worker can't claim it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to simplify.

The original deed is a transfer. The co-worker buys it for the same price as the original price. So, he's the owner. But the original deed was not for sale, so he can't claim any ownership rights. But since he now owns the property, he doesn't have any right to sell it.

Wait, but the co-worker is the one selling the property, so he's the one who is the seller. No, wait, the original deed was for the property. When the co-worker buys it, he's the owner. So, the co-worker is the owner now.

Wait, but the original deed was not for sale, so he can't sell it. So, he buys it for the price, which is the same as the original price. So, he's the owner, but the original deed didn't create any ownership. So, the co-worker can't claim any ownership rights, but he's the owner.

Wait, but the right of survivorship applies to the original joint tenants. So, the original joint tenants can't claim ownership. But the co-worker is now the sole owner, so he doesn't have any right to sell. But the co-worker is selling it to the co-worker. So, the co-worker is the one selling, so he's the seller, and the buyer is the same person. So, he's just buying, not selling.

So, in that case, the co-worker is the owner, but the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the sole owner. So, he can't pass away without any right to sell, but he can't sell because it's unauthorized.

Wait, the question is about the ownership after the sale. So, the co-worker has the property, which is a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. But since he now owns it, does he have any right to sell it? No, because the original deed didn't create any ownership. So, the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the owner, not a joint tenant.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is about what the joint tenants can claim upon death. If the co-worker is the sole owner, then he can't claim survivorship. So, the right of survivorship isn't applicable because he's the owner. So, the ownership is as a co-writer, but the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the owner.

Wait, but the question is about the title. So, the co-worker now owns the property, and it's a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. But since he's the owner, he can't sell it. So, the ownership is as a co-writer, but the property is now owned by him.

Hmm... I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the original deed. The original deed was not for sale, so the co-worker bought it for the original price. So, he is the owner. But the original deed wasn't for sale, so the right of survivorship doesn't apply. So, the co-worker can't claim any ownership rights. But he's the owner.

So, the ownership is now with the co-worker, but the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the sole owner. So, the answer would be that the co-worker owns the property, but the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the owner.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options A to F are about the ownership. The question is about the ownership now.

Wait, the options are:

A: the co-worker, the student and the boyfriend as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

B: the co-worker as owner in fee simple.

C: the boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

D: the co-worker and the boyfriend as tenants in common.

E: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.

F: the co-worker and the boyfriend as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

Wait, the options are each about who owns the property and the type. The question is about the ownership.

So, the co-worker bought the property for the original price, which was $150k, same as the original deed's price. So, he's the owner. But the original deed was not for sale, so the co-worker can't claim ownership. But he can't sell it because the original deed didn't create ownership. So, the co-worker is the owner, but the original deed didn't create a new ownership.

So, the ownership is with the co-worker, but the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the owner. Therefore, the correct answer is B: the co-worker as owner in fee simple.

Wait, no. Because the original deed was not for sale, so the co-worker can't claim ownership. So, the co-worker is the owner, but he can't claim any ownership because the original deed didn't create it. So, the ownership is with the co-worker, but he can't claim any rights. So, the option is B.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is a right that the joint tenants can claim upon death. So, if the co-worker dies, the property is still owned by the other joint tenant. But the co-worker is now the owner of the property, so he's the sole owner, and he can't claim any rights because he's the owner.

So, the ownership is as the co-worker, but the right of survivorship doesn't apply because he's the owner.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: the co-worker as owner in fee simple.

Wait, but the fee simple is for the price, but the fee simple doesn't create ownership. So, the fee simple is for the price, but the ownership is with the co-worker because he's the owner. So, the answer is B.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: the co-worker as owner in fee simple**.

**Explanation:**

1. **Original Deed**: The couple is recorded as a joint tenant with the right of survivorship, but the deed itself does not create ownership because it is not for sale. This means the couple cannot claim ownership of the property.

2. **Co-worker's Purchase**: The co-worker buys the property for the same price as the original deed's price, which is $150,000. At this point, the co-worker becomes the sole owner of the property.

3. **Right of Survivorship**: The right of survivorship applies to the original joint tenants (the couple) upon their death. However, since the co-worker is now the sole owner, he does not claim any rights under the right of survivorship. The property is now owned by the co-worker, and there is no subsequent right of survivorship to apply.

4. **Ownership Type**: Since the co-worker is the sole owner of the property, the correct term to describe his ownership is "owner in fee simple." This term applies to the property when the owner is the sole owner, regardless of the right of survivorship.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: the co-worker as owner in fee simple**.
