Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Anscombe's concept of moral obligation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question asks what Anscombe derived his notion of moral obligation from. The options are preference, natural law, self-interest, maximizing utility, ethical relativism, personal desire, positive law, divine law, societal norms, and consequentialism.

I remember that Anscombe is a philosopher, maybe from the Analytic School? I think he wrote a lot about ethics and moral principles. Let me try to recall. I think he talked about the concept of moral obligation, so it's not personal desire or preference. Because if it's about preference, that's more about choice and what someone likes, not obligation.

Natural law comes to mind, but I don't think that's what Anscombe was about. Natural law is more about the natural state of the law and how it affects individuals, not obligation.

Self-interest is another option. I think that's more about what someone does because of their own interests, not obligations. But I'm not sure if that's the right angle.

Maximizing utility is a concept in economics, not sure how it applies to ethics. So maybe that's not the right approach here.

Ethical relativism is a theory that moral principles vary by culture or context. But I'm not recalling Anscombe being associated with that.

Personal desire is another thought, but that's similar to preference. Personal desire is about what you feel compelled to do because of your desires, not obligations.

Positive law might refer to laws, but again, I'm not connecting it to obligation.

Societal norms are about what's considered correct in society, but that's more about what's acceptable rather than obligation.

Consequentialism is a theory where the morality of an action is determined by its outcome. I think Anscombe was involved with this, maybe advocating for a more moral outcome-based approach.

Wait, I remember reading that Anscombe's concept of moral obligation is derived from the idea that obligations are the result of the maximization of self-interest. Or was it something else?

Wait, another angle: moral obligation is about the necessary action someone must take because of their self-interest. So, it's about the consequences of their actions. That would tie into consequentialism, which focuses on the outcomes.

Consequentialism (option I) says that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. So if you act in a way that leads to a positive outcome, you're doing what you should.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe it's about the concept of positive law or positive ethics. Positive law refers to laws that are based on principles, not just arbitrary rules. Positive ethics would be about the moral principles themselves.

Alternatively, I think I read that Anscombe's moral obligation is derived from the concept of self-interest. Because he didn't just say, "obligation is what you must do because of your self-interest," but more about the necessity of actions due to self-interest. So perhaps he thought that obligations are the result of self-interested behavior.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Another way: moral obligations are often seen as consequences of personal choices. So, if you have an obligation, it's because there's a reason for you to act in a certain way, perhaps due to self-interest.

So, if Anscombe's idea is about deriving moral obligation from self-interest, that would point to option D: maximizing utility? Or maybe another term.

Alternatively, I think the concept he was associated with is about the necessity of acting in accordance with self-interest. So maybe it's about the maximization of self-interest leading to moral obligations.

Ah, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Looking at each option:

A: preference. That's about what you prefer, not obligation.

B: natural law. More about what's natural, not obligation.

C: self-interest. So, options implying that obligation is about self-interest.

D: maximizing utility. That's about making choices to maximize well-being.

E: ethical relativism. That's about moral principles being relative to culture.

F: personal desire. Similar to preference.

G: positive law. Maybe about laws.

H: divine law. Maybe from religious sources.

I: consequentialism. Focuses on outcomes.

J: consequentialism.

So, I think the answer is about self-interest, which is option C. Or perhaps maximizing utility, but that's about action, not obligation.

Wait, no. Maximizing utility isn't about obligation. So, perhaps the answer is about self-interest, which is option C.

Alternatively, I think I might be confusing it with the concept of "moral consequence," but that's not an option here.

Another angle: I've heard that Anscombe's work on moral responsibility was influenced by his discussions on the necessity of acts. He didn't just say, "you have a moral duty to act in this way," but he thought it's about the reasons behind that duty.

Wait, but the question is about the basis for moral obligation. So, perhaps the idea is that moral obligation is a consequence of self-interest. So, the obligation is the result of your self-interest.

In that case, the answer would be C: self-interest.

But wait, another thought: I think I read that moral obligation is derived from the concept of the maximization of self-interest. So, the reason you have an obligation is that your self-interest is the primary motivation.

So the answer should be C: self-interest.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe it's about the concept of positive law or positive ethics. Positive law refers to the laws that are derived from principles, not arbitrary. Positive ethics is about moral principles themselves.

Wait, the question options don't include positive law or ethics. So, the options are C: self-interest and others.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is C: self-interest.

The concept of moral obligation derived from Anscombe's work emphasizes the idea that obligations are the result of self-interest. This means that morally required actions are those that arise from the necessity of acting in accordance with self-interest, often due to a personal desire to maximize well-being. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: C
