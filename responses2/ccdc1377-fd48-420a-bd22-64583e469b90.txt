Question:

Statement 1 | For every positive integer n there is a cyclic group of order n. Statement 2 | Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.

Options:

A: Statement 1 is false because not all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
B: Statement 1 is false because only composite numbers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
C: False, False
D: True, False
E: False, True
F: Statement 1 is false because only prime numbers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
G: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is false because only infinite cyclic groups contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.
H: True, True
I: Both statements are true, but they are not related.
J: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is false because not all finite cyclic groups contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically about cyclic groups. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out which option is correct based on the given statements.

The question is about two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. Let me go through each part step by step.

Statement 1 says: "For every positive integer n there is a cyclic group of order n." Wait, I remember something about cyclic groups. From what I've studied, a cyclic group is one where all its elements can be generated by a single element. The order of a cyclic group is the number of elements it has, right? So, for any positive integer n, can we have a cyclic group of that order?

I think yes. For example, the integers under addition mod n form a cyclic group of order n. So Statement 1 is true. That means I can eliminate options that say Statement 1 is false.

Looking at the options, I see A, B, D, E, F, H, and J. Wait, no, let me check again. The options are A to J. Let me list them again quickly.

A: Statement 1 is false because not all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
B: Statement 1 is false because only composite numbers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
C: False, False
D: True, False
E: False, True
F: Statement 1 is false because only prime numbers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
G: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is false because only infinite cyclic groups contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.
H: True, True
I: Both statements are true, but they are not related.
J: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is false because not all finite cyclic groups contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Statement 1 is definitely correct because for any n, the cyclic group of order n can be formed, like Z_n. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: "Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group." Hmm, yes, that's a theorem I remember. In any finite cyclic group, the number of elements of order d (where d divides the group's order n) is Ï†(d), Euler's totient function. So, for example, in a cyclic group of order 6, elements of order 1, 2, 3, 6 all exist. So Statement 2 is also true.

So both statements are true. Looking back at the options, that's option H: True, True. Alternatively, I need to check the other options to make sure no other options are true.

Wait, looking at option E: False, True. But we've determined Statement 1 is true, so E can't be right. Option D is True, False, but Statement 2 is true, so D can't be correct.

Looking at option F: Statement 1 is false because only prime numbers have cyclic groups. No, that's not true. Statement 1 is correct. So F is wrong.

Option G: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have cyclic groups. That's correct. But Statement 2 is false because only infinite groups contain elements of all orders dividing the group's order. Wait, no. Wait, Statement 2 says that every finite cyclic group has this property. So Statement 2 is correct. So G says Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, but our analysis shows both are true. So G can't be correct.

Option J: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have cyclic groups. That's correct. But Statement 2 is false because not all finite cyclic groups contain elements of every order dividing the group's order. Wait, no. Because in a finite cyclic group, every element's order must divide the group's order. So for any d dividing n, there's an element of order d. So Statement 2 is correct. So J is wrong because it says Statement 2 is false, but we know it's true.

So the options are between H (both true) and perhaps others. Let me check the options again:

Looking at option H: True, True. So that's correct.

Other options:

Option D is True, False. So that would be wrong because we've found both statements are true.

Option E is False, True. But Statement 1 is true, so E is wrong.

So the correct answer must be H: True, True.

The correct answer is H: True, True.
