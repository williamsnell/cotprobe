Okay, so I've got this question about assault and battery, and I need to figure out who's liable for what. Let me start by recalling what I know about these legal terms.

So, the scenario is Donny throwing a knife at Sally, intending to injure her. But he missed. Sally saw the knife just as it whizzed by, missing it by about an inch. So Sally was scared. She sued for assault and battery, and we have to determine who's liable.

Hmm, I remember that assault and battery are two different criminal terms. Let me think about their definitions.

Attack on someone's body is assault. Battery is usually when someone is attacked by someone else, but it's a bit broader. Wait, actually, battery is a more general term, but I think it's considered a form of assault in certain contexts.

Wait, but there's a key difference. Attack on someone (assault) requires physical contact and the intention to cause physical harm. Battery, on the other hand, requires that the person being attacked (the intruder) intentionally causes harm to the person being harmed. So, the intent is important here.

In this case, Donny threw the knife at Sally. He was intending to injure her. But he missed. So, the key here is whether the intent was to cause physical harm.

Wait, but he did hit her. Because he could have hit her, but he missed. So, when he whizzed by her head, the knife was in the path, but he didn't strike. Wait, the question says "the knife whizzed by her head, missing it by about one inch." So, he hit her, but the knife was there. So, the knife was close enough that he could have hit, but he missed.

Wait, so the action was a direct attack: he threw the knife, which caused Sally to be hit. But the act of hitting was a direct attack on her body. So assault would be applicable here because he intended to injure her, which is a physical harm.

But let's think about battery. Battery requires that the person being attacked intentionally causes harm. So, for that, the intruder must have intentionally hit Sally. But in this case, Donny intended to injure her, but he hit her by throwing the knife. Did he do so with the intent to cause harm? Or was the hit just because he was trying to hit her?

Wait, the question says he intended to injure her. So, he was trying to cause harm. But he didn't actually hit her because he missed. But if he hit her, then he did cause harm. So, if he intended to injure her, and he actually hit her, then he's guilty of assault.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the distinction comes in whether the act of hitting is considered a battery or an assault. But in this case, assault is when someone is attacked and hits their body with intent to cause physical harm. Battery is a more general term, but I think it could include both battery and assault.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: assault requires that the person is attacked and hits their body with intent to cause harm. Battery is a broader term that includes both types. So, if someone is attacked and hits their body, it's a battery. But if it's a direct hit, it's an assault.

Wait, but in this case, Sally was hit by the knife. So, it's a direct attack. So, assault is applicable. But does the fact that the person was missing mean that he didn't cause the harm? Oh, wait, no. The intent was to cause harm, so he did hit her, so assault applies.

Wait, but then let's think about whether the act of hitting is battery or assault. I think in many jurisdictions, hitting someone while trying to hit them counts as battery. But when the intent is to cause harm, it's assault.

Wait, but in this case, the knife was in the path, but he hit her. So, did he hit her because he was trying to hit her, or did he hit her because of the knife's path?

Hmm, the scenario says he intended to injure her. So, he was trying to cause harm, but he didn't hit her because he missed. He hit her, but he was able to, but he missed. So, he hit her.

So, he intended to harm her, and he actually did hit her. So, he's guilty of assault.

But wait, was he a battery? Well, hitting someone while trying to hit them is considered battery. But in actuality, if the intent is to cause harm, it's assault.

Wait, but the options are about which liability he is liable for. The options are about whether he's liable for assault or battery.

Looking at the options, the options are about whether he's liable for both, or one or neither.

In the question, the options are:

A: Donny will be liable for battery, but not assault.

B: Donny will not be liable for either because he didn't hit with intent.

C: He'll be liable for assault, not battery because he missed.

D: He's liable for both.

E: Not liable for either because it's a criminal matter.

F: Not liable for either because Sally wasn't harmed.

G: He's liable for both because he intended harm.

H: He's liable for both because of the intent.

I: He's liable for battery, not assault because Sally was able to dodge.

J: He's liable for assault, not battery.

Wait, so the question is about whether he's liable for battery or assault.

So, the key issue is whether the act of hitting Sally constitutes battery or assault.

In the scenario: he threw the knife, which caused Sally to be hit. He intended to injure her. So, he intended to cause harm. So, he's guilty of assault.

But he hit her, so he's also guilty of battery.

Wait, but does the intention to cause harm make it assault, and hitting is battery, which is a broader term. So, he's liable for both.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about this. Let me think again.

In criminal law, assault requires that the person is attacked and hits their body, and intent to cause harm. Battery is a broader term, which can include both battery and assault. So, if someone is attacked and hits their body with intent to cause harm, it's assault; if they're attacked and hit with a purpose of causing harm, it's battery. But if someone is attacked and hits their body with the intent to cause harm, then it's both.

Wait, but in this case, the act of hitting Sally was intentional to cause harm. So, it's assault. But the act of hitting Sally was also a battery, because it was intentional to cause harm.

Wait, but actual act of hitting Sally is battery. The intent to cause harm is what makes it assault.

So, in this case, he's liable for both. Therefore, whether he's liable for battery or assault.

Wait, but the question is, which is correct? The answer options are A to J.

Looking at the options:

J says: He'll be liable for assault, but not battery.

Wait, no. If he's liable for both, then J is not correct. Because J says he's liable for assault, but not battery. But in reality, he's liable for both.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Did he hit Sally, which was an attack, but he did it in a way that could have been battery? Or was it a direct assault.

Wait, the question says he intended to injure her. So, he intended to cause harm, but he hit her, but he missed. So, he hit her, but he didn't actually hit her with the knife. Wait, no. The wording says that the knife whizzed by her head, missing it by about one inch. So, he was in the path, but he could have hit her. He did hit her, but he didn't hit her with the knife. So, the act of hitting her was a direct assault.

Because he intended to harm her, and he actually hit her, so assault applies. But since he hit her, but he was able to, but he intended to hit her, so he's also liable for battery.

Wait, but in reality, the act of hitting Sally is a battery. Because the act is intentional to cause harm. So, he's liable for both assault and battery. So, in that case, the correct answer would be D, which says he's liable for both.

But wait, looking at the options, option D says he's liable for assault and battery because he intended to cause harm.

But wait, the options are:

D: Donny will be liable for assault and for battery because he intended to cause harm.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because an assault requires physical contact and intent to cause harm, but in this case, he hit her, so it's a direct assault. But is it also a battery? Because battery is when someone is attacked and hit, which is the same as the act of hitting.

Wait, so perhaps the answer is D: he's liable for both because he intended to cause harm. Because he intended to cause harm, which is assault, and he hit her, which is battery.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident. Let me think again.

Option D: "Liability for assault and battery because he intended to cause harm." That's correct. Because assault requires intent to cause harm, so yes. And battery is also required, even if it's a direct hit, as long as the intent is to cause harm.

Wait, but in some cases, the intent to hit is considered as battery, but the intent to cause harm is assault. So, yes, he's liable for both.

But wait, another thought. If the act of hitting Sally is battery, then he's liable for that. But the intent to cause harm is assault, so he's also liable for that. So, he's liable for both.

So looking at the options, D says he's liable for both because he intended to cause harm, which is correct.

Wait, but I'm trying to think if the act of hitting Sally is considered battery or assault. I think in most jurisdictions, it's considered both, but when the intent is for physical harm, it's assault, and if you hit someone while intending to cause harm, it's also battery. Therefore, he's liable for both.

So the answer would be D. Alternatively, if the act of hitting is only battery, and the intent is assault, then D would be correct.

Wait, the options are:

D says he's liable for assault and battery because he intended to cause harm.

Alternatively, option J says he'll be liable for assault, but not battery.

Wait, so if the act of hitting Sally is battery, then he's liable for both assault and battery. So, the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but the question is about whether he's liable for both. So, the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but another way to look at this is that if he intended to cause harm, then he's liable for assault. But whether he's a battery charge or not depends on whether the act of hitting is battery or not. But in this case, he hit her, so it's an assault. But also, the act of hitting is a battery.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says he's liable for both, because each option has specific reasons. So, looking at the options, D says he's liable for both because he intended to cause harm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because he intended to cause harm, which is assault, and the act itself is a battery.

But wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

In the scenario:

He intended to injure Sally (so assault intent), and he hit her. So, assault applies. The act of hitting her is a battery because it's intentional to cause harm.

So, he's guilty of both. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

But wait, the options don't have an option that says 'both' necessarily, but looking at the options:

Looking at the options:

A: Battery, not assault.

B: Neither because he didn't hit with intent.

C: Assault, not battery because he missed.

D: Both because intent.

E: Neither because criminal, which is wrong.

F: Neither because not physically harmed. (She wasn't harmed.)

G: Both because intended to cause harm.

H: Both because of intent.

Wait, so G and H both suggest he's liable for both. But according to the question, Sally was physically harmed. Wait, Sally was hit by the knife, so she was physically harmed. So, battery would apply, because she was physically harmed.

Wait, but usually, battery refers to intentional causing harm. So, if the act of hitting Sally was intentional to cause harm, then it's a battery. So, he's liable for both.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think of an example: If you hit someone with a sword, and you intend to cause injury, then you're liable for both battery and assault.

Because in that case, you were intending to cause harm (assault), and you hit, so it's a battery.

Wait, so in this question, the act of hitting Sally is a battery because it was intentional to cause harm, and the intent to harm was also assault.

So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but the options are:

D: He'll be liable for assault and battery because he intended to cause harm.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether Donny is liable for both assault and battery after intentionally hitting Sally with a knife. The key distinctions are:

1. ** assault** requires physical contact and intent to cause physical harm.
2. ** battery** is broader and includes both intentional causing harm and physical contact.

In this case, Donny intended to injure Sally (intent to cause harm), which satisfies the assault requirement. However, the act of hitting Sally was intentional to cause harm, which satisfies the battery requirement. Therefore, Donny is liable for both assault and battery because he intended to cause harm.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. Donny is liable for both assault and battery.
- **B**: Incorrect. Donny did hit Sally, so he is not only liable for battery but also for assault.
- **C**: Incorrect. Donny is liable for both assault and battery because he intended to cause harm.
- **D**: Correct. Donny is liable for both assault and battery because he intended to cause harm.
- **E**: Incorrect. The scenario involves physical harm, so it is not a criminal matter.
- **F**: Incorrect. Sally was physically harmed, so battery applies.
- **G**: Incorrect. While intent to cause harm is assault, the act of hitting is battery.
- **H**: Incorrect. The intent to cause harm is assault, not battery.
- **J**: Incorrect. Donny was physically harmed, so he is not only liable for assault but also for battery.
