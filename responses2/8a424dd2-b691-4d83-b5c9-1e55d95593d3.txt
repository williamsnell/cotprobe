Question:

Let’s assume that the 10-year annual return for the S&P 500 (market portfolio) is 10%, while the average annual return on Treasury bills (a good proxy for the risk-free rate) is 5%. The standard deviation is 15% over a 10-year period. Whats the market Sharpe Ratio?

Options:

A: 1.50
B: 1.00
C: 0.20
D: 0.25
E: 0.50
F: 1.25
G: 0.75
H: 0.33
I: 2.00
J: 0.60

Okay, so I've got this question about the Sharpe Ratio, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what I remember.

The question says the 10-year annual return for the S&P 500 is 10%, and the risk-free rate, which is the average annual return on Treasury bills, is 5%. The standard deviation is 15% over 10 years. I need to find the Sharpe Ratio.

Wait, the Sharpe Ratio formula, right? I think it's the excess return divided by the standard deviation. So excess return is the market return minus the risk-free rate. Oh right, because the risk-free rate is the return you'd get for putting money in a risk-free asset, like a government bond.

So, let's break it down. Excess return would be 10% minus 5%, which is 5%. Then the standard deviation is 15%. So the Sharpe Ratio is 5% divided by 15%. Hmm, 5 divided by 15 is the same as 1/3, which is approximately 0.333... or about 0.33.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Yes, Sharpe Ratio (SR) = (Rp - Rf) / σp. So in this case, Rp is 10%, Rf is 5%, so Rp - Rf is 5%. σp is 15%. So 5/15 = 1/3, which is 0.33 approximately.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.33. So the answer should be H.

The Sharpe Ratio is calculated as the difference between the market return and the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation of the market returns. 

1. **Market Return (Rp)**: 10%  
2. **Risk-Free Rate (Rf)**: 5%  
3. **Standard Deviation (σp)**: 15%  

**Excess Return** = Rp - Rf = 10% - 5% = 5%  
**Sharpe Ratio (SR)** = Excess Return / σp = 5% / 15% = 1/3 ≈ 0.33  

The correct answer is **H: 0.33**.

Answer: H
