Question:

 Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
M ∨ N
~M · O / N

Options:

A: Valid
B: Invalid. Counterexample when M and O are true and N is false
C: Invalid. Counterexample when M is true and O and N are false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when O is true and M and N are false

Okay, I have to figure out whether this argument is valid or not using a truth table. The argument given is:

1. M ∨ N
2. ~M · O
3. N

And then the question is whether this argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to choose the correct counterexample from the options A to D.

First, I remember that an argument is valid if there's no situation where all the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So, in other words, the argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.

Wait, in this case, the premises are M ∨ N, ~M · O, and N. The conclusion isn't given, but I think the problem is just to see if the premises lead to a conclusion. Wait, maybe the argument is supposed to conclude something like M or O or N, but perhaps I'm missing that. Oh wait, looking back, the problem is to determine if the argument is valid, and if not, find a counterexample.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is of the form:

Premises: M∨N, ~M ∧ O, N.

Conclusion: ?

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the structure. Maybe the argument is a syllogism or a hypothetical syllogism. Hmm, perhaps the conclusion is something like M or O or N, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is to see whether the premises imply the conclusion, which is N in this case. Or maybe the conclusion is something else. Wait, looking at the structure again, the problem says it's an argument to determine validity.

Wait, perhaps the argument is as follows:

1. M ∨ N
2. ~M · O
3. N

And the conclusion is perhaps M or O or N, or maybe a different conclusion. Wait, but in the question, it's not given. So perhaps the argument is to determine if the premises imply the conclusion, and if the conclusion is N, then the argument is valid if the premises must lead to N.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is something else. Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, perhaps the argument is structured as:

Premise 1: M ∨ N
Premise 2: ~M · O
Premise 3: N
Conclusion: ?

Wait, but without the conclusion, how can I determine validity? Wait no, perhaps the argument is supposed to have a conclusion that's not given, and the task is to see if the premises imply the conclusion, and if the conclusion is N, then the argument is valid.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to see if the premises together imply the conclusion, which is N. So, if all three premises are true, then N must be true, making the argument valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is to determine if the premises lead to the conclusion N, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

I'll start by constructing the truth table. There are three variables: M, N, O.

I'll list all possible truth values for M, N, O, and compute the premises and the conclusion.

Wait, but wait, the conclusion isn't given. Hmm. Oh, perhaps the argument is of the form:

Premise 1: M ∨ N
Premise 2: ~M · O
Premise 3: N
Conclusion: Let's say, N (since it's the third premise). So, if all premises are true, does it necessarily make the conclusion true?

Wait, but without knowing the conclusion, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is M or O or N, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is to determine if M ∨ N and ~M · O together imply N, making the conclusion N.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the argument is a syllogism in the form of:

1. M ∨ N
2. ~M · O
3. Therefore, N

In this case, the argument is to see if the premises together imply that N is true. So, if I can find a scenario where premises 1 and 2 are true, and N is false, then the argument is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is a form where premises 1 and 2 together lead to N. So, let's proceed under that assumption.

So, the premises are:

M ∨ N

~M · O

N

Wait, but that's three premises, so for a syllogism, maybe the conclusion is N.

Wait, perhaps the argument's conclusion is N, so let's proceed under that.

So, to determine validity, I'll create a truth table for M, N, O, and see if any row where premises 1, 2, and 3 are all true, the conclusion is false. If such a case exists, the argument is invalid.

Wait, but in this case, the third premise is N. So, in the rows where all premises are true, does N have to be true? Let's see.

Let me go through each possible combination.

First, let's list all possible truth values for M, N, O:

M | N | O | M∨N | ~M · O | N
---|---|---|-----|-------|---
T | T | T |  T  |  F    | T
T | T | F |  T  |  F    | T
T | F | T |  T  |  F    | F → But wait, for ~M · O to be true, both ~M and O must be true. So in the first row, ~M is F, so ~M · O is F. So that row can't have all premises true.

Wait, let's construct the rows step by step.

Case 1: M=T, N=T, O=T

- M∨N= T ∨ T = T
- ~M = F, so ~M · O = F ∧ T = F
- N=T.

So, premises 2 is F, so all premises can't be true. So this row is not possible for all premises.

Case 2: M=T, N=T, O=F

- M∨N= T
- ~M= F, O=F → ~M · O= F ∧ F = F
- N=T.

Again, premise 2 is F, so all premises can't be true.

Case3: M=T, N=F, O=T

- M∨N= T ∨ F = T
- ~M= F, O=T → F ∧ T = F
- N=F.

Again, premise 2 is F.

Case4: M=T, N=F, O=F

- M∨N= T ∨ F = T
- ~M= F, O=F → F ∧ F = F
- N=F.

Again, premise 2 is F.

Case5: M=F, N=T, O=T

- M∨N= F ∨ T = T
- ~M= T, O=T → T ∧ T = T
- N=T.

So, in this case, all premises 1, 2, 3 are T.

But the conclusion in this case would be N, which is T. So, no problem here; the argument holds.

Case6: M=F, N=T, O=F

- M∨N= F ∨ T = T
- ~M= T, O=F → T ∧ F = F
- N=T.

So, premise 2 is F. So all premises can't be true.

Case7: M=F, N=F, O=T

- M∨N= F ∨ F = F
- So premise 1 is F. So this row isn't possible.

Case8: M=F, N=F, O=F

- M∨N= F
- So premise 1 is F.

So, the only possible rows where all premises are true are case5: M=T, O=T, N=T.

In this case, the conclusion N is true.

So, in all cases where all premises are true, the conclusion (N) is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but I thought the problem said to choose between options A to D, and the options are about counterexamples when the premises are true, the conclusion is false. But in this case, the argument is valid because whenever premises are true, conclusion is also true.

But the problem says, 'if the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample'. So, if it's valid, the correct answer would be A: Valid.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the argument is to determine whether the premises imply the conclusion, which is N. So, if premises lead to N, the argument is valid. But if premises don't lead to N, then the argument is invalid.

Wait, in our case, in the only possible case where premises are true (M=T, O=T, N=T), the conclusion N is also true. So, in all cases where premises are true, the conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but the options include A: Valid, and others for invalid. So, perhaps the argument is valid, so answer is A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any scenario where premises 1, 2, 3 are true, but the conclusion is false?

If the conclusion is N, then in the case where premises are true, N must be true. So, no counterexamples. So the argument is valid.
</think>

The argument is valid because in all possible scenarios where the premises are true, the conclusion (N) is also true. There are no counterexamples where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.

Answer: A: Valid
