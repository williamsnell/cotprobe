Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the magnitude of E in a plane wave in free space. The given value is the magnitude of H, which is 5 amp/meter. Hmm, I remember that in electromagnetic waves, especially plane waves, there's a relationship between the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (H). 

Wait, right! The electric field is related to the magnetic field by the speed of light. Oh yeah, the formula is E = c * H. Oh wait, wait, no, the other way around. Or is it H = (c) * B? Wait, no, let's get this straight.

In a plane wave, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. Also, their amplitudes are related by E = c * H. Oh wait, no wait again. Because H is the magnetic field, and E is the electric field. I think it's E = c * H, but maybe I should double-check. Or is it H = (1/c) * E? Hmm. Wait, what's the exact relation.

I recall that in a vacuum, the speed of light c is equal to 1/(sqrt(μ0 ε0)). And the relationship between E and H is E = c * H. Oh wait, no, no, wait. Let me think. The wave equation says that E and H are related by E = c * H. Or is it the other way? Because the wave equation says that the electric and magnetic fields propagate at the speed of light. So, if H has a certain value, E would be that multiplied by c. 

Wait, but wait, the formula is E = c * H. Because H is B/(μ0), and E is B/(ε0). Or wait, wait, let's think about the wave equation. In a plane wave, E and H are related by E = c H. Because the wave is moving at speed v = c, so E changes as H changes in the same direction. So when H increases by a factor, E increases by the same factor. So if H is 5 A/m, then E would be E = c * 5. What's c? Oh right, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me get the exact value of c. Oh, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 2.99792e8 meters per second, which is about 3e8 m/s. So c is roughly 3e8.

So E = c * H. H is given as 5 A/m. So E is 3e8 times 5. Let's calculate that: 3e8 *5 = 1.5e9 volts/meter. Wait, wait, that's 1.5e9 V/m. Looking at the options, the options are:

A: 1200 V/m
B:5 ohm
C:1883 V/m
D:940.5 V/m
E:5 V/m
F:1883 ohm
G:600 V/m
H:376.7 V/m
I:75.34 ohm
J:75.34 V/m

So none of the options directly match 1.5e9. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Did I mix up the formula?

Wait, another approach. Oh wait, the impedance of free space is Z0 = E0/H0, which is approximately 376 ohms. Because E = Z0 H. So, if H is 5 A/m, then E would be 5 * Z0. Oh wait, that's because E = Z0 H. So E = 5 * 376.7 ≈ 1883.5 V/m. Oh, that's option C, which is 1883 V/m. So that would make sense.

Wait, but earlier I thought E = c * H, which would be 3e8 *5 = 1.5e9 V/m, which is much higher than 1883. So which is correct? Hmmm. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct relationship is E = c * H. Because in a plane wave, the speed of the wave is c, and E and H are related by E = c H. Because E = c H, because the wave propagates at speed c, so the change in H leads to a change in E by a factor of c.

Wait, but if E = c H, then H = E/(c). So if H is 5, E would be 5*c ≈5 *3e8 =1.5e9 V/m. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm mixing up the relationship between E and H.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E = c H. Because the wave equation in a vacuum gives E = c H. So with H=5, E= 3e8 *5=1.5e9. But that's not an option. So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (1/√μ0 ε0) * H. Oh wait, because E = (1/√(μ0 ε0)) * H. Because E = B/(μ0), and H = B/(μ0) * sqrt(ε0) * something? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of Maxwell's equations.

In a plane wave, E and H are perpendicular, and E = c H. Because E is the electric field, and H is the magnetic field. So when H is given, E is c times that.

Wait, but earlier I thought the impedance is Z0= E/H = 376 ohms, so E= Z0 H. So if H is 5, E=5*376.7≈1883.5 V/m. That's option C.

So which one is correct? Is the correct formula E = c H or E = Z0 H?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the wave's speed. The wave speed is v = 1/(sqrt(μ₀ ε₀)) = c. But when you have the wave equation, the wave's speed is c, but the relation between E and H is E = c H.

Wait, another way: in a plane wave, the ratio E/H is equal to the impedance Z0 which is approximately 376 ohms. So if H is 5, E is 5 * Z0 = 5*376.7= 1883.5 V/m. That's option C.

So the correct answer would be option C:1883 V/m.

But earlier, I thought E = c H, which would be 1.5e9 V/m, which is not an option. So I must be mixing up something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula I remember is that E = c H, but in the other way around, H = E/(c). But that can't be right because that would give H as 1.5e9 /3e8 =5, which is correct. Wait, but H is 5. So E would be c * H, which is 5 *3e8=1.5e9. But that's not an option.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the magnitude of E, not the relation to H. So perhaps the correct answer is option C when H is 5. But the only way that's possible is if the correct formula is E = Z0 H.

So the confusion arises between the two formulas: E = c H and E = Z0 H. Are these two the same? Because Z0 is c / sqrt(μ0 ε0) = E/H. So Z0 = E/H, so E = Z0 H. But also, since v=1/ sqrt(μ0 ε0) = c, then E = (1/√μ0 ε0) H = c H.

Wait, so E = c H and E = Z0 H are the same thing. Because Z0 is c/(sqrt(μ0 ε0)), so c = Z0 * sqrt(μ0 ε0). So E = c H = Z0 H.

Oh! So both expressions are correct. So either way, E is Z0 H. So if H is 5, E is 5 * 376.7 ≈ 1883 V/m. So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought E = c H, which would be 1.5e9 V/m. But that's not one of the options. So why are the options including both 1e9 and 1.883e3? Because 376.7 is approximately 1e2, but wait no, 376.7 is about 3.76e2.

Wait, 376.7 is approximately 377, but I have to use it exactly. So 5 * 376.7 is 1883.5 V/m. So the correct answer is 1883 V/m, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.

To find the magnitude of the electric field \( E \) for a plane wave in free space, given the magnetic field \( H = 5 \, \text{A/m} \), we use the relationship between \( E \) and \( H \) in a vacuum. The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and the magnitude of the electric field is related to the magnetic field by \( E = cH \). Substituting \( H = 5 \, \text{A/m} \), we calculate:

\[
E = cH = (3 \times 10^8) \times 5 = 1.5 \times 10^9 \, \text{V/m}.
\]

However, this value is not among the provided options. Upon closer inspection, the relationship between \( E \) and \( H \) can also be expressed using the impedance of free space, \( Z_0 \), where \( Z_0 = 376.7 \, \Omega \). The electric field is related to the magnetic field by \( E = Z_0H \). Substituting \( H = 5 \, \text{A/m} \):

\[
E = Z_0H = 376.7 \times 5 \approx 1883 \, \text{V/m}.
\]

This matches one of the provided options, \( C: 1883 \, \text{V/m} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
