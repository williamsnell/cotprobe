Okay, so I've got this question about Zero Population Growth, or ZPG. Hmm, I remember this concept from biology class. Let me think. ZPG is when a population is stable, meaning its size doesn't change much over time. So the number of births equals the number of deaths, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition.

The question is asking which option is correct for ZPG. Let me look at the options. Option D says the birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration. That makes sense because if the number of births and deaths balance each other out, the population should stay stable.

Option E says birth rate is less than death rate. That would cause a decrease in population because people are dying more than being born. So that's not ZPG; it would lead to a decline.

Option C says total fertility equals 2. Total fertility refers to the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime. If that's 2, the population would decrease each generation because each couple is having one child on average. So that's not ZPG.

Option I mentions births minus deaths, immigration, and emigration. Wait, ZPG requires that births equal deaths, but also that the net migration (immigration minus emigration) is zero. Otherwise, there would be an increase or decrease in population. So just having birth rate equal to death rate isn't enough—it also depends on how many people are moving in and out.

Option B talks about the population increasing and then decreasing. That's the dynamics seen in a population that's growing or declining, but not necessarily stable. So B might not be correct for ZPG.

Option F's a bit unclear to me. CBR and CDR are terms I've heard in population studies. I think CBR stands for Crude Birth Rate and CDR for Crude Death Rate. If they are equal, then the population is at equilibrium. So F would imply that the rates are equal, which is the same as D but using different terms.

Wait, the question is about which option correctly describes ZPG. The definition I remember is that ZPG is when the population is stable, so birth rate equals death rate. So D is correct because it says excluding immigration and emigration, which are factors that affect the population. So in ZPG, the birth-death rates balance each other, regardless of how many people are moving in or out. 

I think the answer is D. Let me double-check. Option E is the opposite of ZPG because less births mean fewer people, so the population would decrease. Option I is about net migration, which affects the population, so it's not the main condition. Option C is about total fertility rate, which affects future generations, not the current balance. Option F is about rates being equal, which is similar to D but uses different terminology. So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is **D: Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration**. This aligns with the definition of Zero Population Growth, where the number of births and deaths balance each other, ensuring a stable population regardless of migration patterns. 

Answer: D
