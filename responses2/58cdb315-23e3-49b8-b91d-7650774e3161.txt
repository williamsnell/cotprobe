Question:

A woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden. Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?

Options:

A: The distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages.
B: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.
C: Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.
D: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, and the woman cannot seek restitution.
E: The distributor's performance was excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution.
F: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.
G: Both parties are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.
H: Both parties are not excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and either can recover from the other.
I: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.

Okay, I need to figure out the legal relationship between the distributor and the woman after the government ban on cymbidium importation. Let me break it down step by step.

So, initially, the distributor tried to get a cymbidium plant from Japan. He was told he couldn't get it because the import was illegal. But then the government banned all cymbidiums in foreign countries. So, the distributor couldn't get the plant at all. Now, when the woman tried to pay $1,000, the government stopped her from paying because the cymbidium wasn't available.

The question is about performance excusability. Performance excusability allows the distributor to excuse themselves if the performance was impossible. But in this case, the import was impossible due to the government's ban, so performance was completely impossible. So, the distributor could be excused from performance because it was impossible.

Wait, but wait. There's another angle here. The problem mentions that the woman handed the $1,000 check. But the cymbidium wasn't available, so she can't get the money. So, the distributor is excused because performance was impossible, and the woman cannot sue because she can't even perform. But wait, the options don't have such a scenario.

Wait, no, the options are about whether the performance was excused because of impossibility, etc. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages. But if performance was impossible, then A is incorrect because it's not excuseable.

Option B: distributor not excused because of impossibility, and can recover damages if she waits until performance was due. But if performance was impossible, then the distributor can't perform, so A is incorrect. So B is also incorrect because performance is impossible.

Wait, but in this scenario, the government banned all cymbidiums. So the import was impossible. So the distributor was not allowed to acquire any cymbidium, including the one she needs. So the distributor can't perform. So the performance was not possible, so the distributor is excused.

But option A says "performance was not excused because of impossibility"â€”wait, no. If performance was impossible, performance is excused, right? So the first part of option A is incorrect.

Looking again, option E says: "performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution." Hmm, wait, no.

Wait, the government ban is the 'supernatural' illegality. So in terms of performance excusability, the impossibility (due to illegality) allows the distributor to be excused. So the first part of option E is incorrect because it says "performance was not excused because of the illegality."

Wait, no. Let me think. The initial problem: the distributor tried to import, but the import was impossible due to the government's ban. So the import was impossible, so the distributor is excused from performance. So option E's first part is incorrect.

Looking at the options again, the correct answer is either E or G or another.

Wait, let me think about it again. The problem states that the government banned the cymbidiums. So, the import was impossible. So, the distributor was not allowed to get any plant, including the one she wanted. So, the distributor's performance was not excusable because it was impossible.

So, the correct first part of the options would be about performance being excused because of impossibility. But none of the options say that. Let me look.

Looking at the choices:

Option E: "The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution."

Wait, no, because if performance was impossible, the distributor is excused, so E's first part is wrong.

Option A: "The distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages." So, if performance was impossible, the distributor is excused; so A says it's not excused, which is incorrect. So A is wrong.

Option B says performance not excused because of impossibility. Again, that's incorrect.

Looking at the options, perhaps none of them are entirely correct, but let's reevaluate.

Wait, the question is about the legal relationship, not about performance excusability.

Wait, the contract was signed, but the performance was impossible because of the government ban. So, the distributor couldn't perform, so their performance was not excusable because it was impossible. So, the distributor is excused.

So, when the woman tried to pay, the contract was not performed because the distributor couldn't get the plant at all. So, the contract can't be enforced, but the woman can seek damages for not fulfilling the contract and for the damage to her crops.

Wait, but the government banned all cymbidiums in foreign countries. So, the distributor couldn't even get one, so the performance was impossible.

In terms of performance excusability, if the performance was impossible, then the distributor can be excused.

So, the first part of the question is whether performance was excusable because of impossibility.

So, the options:

A: Not excusable, woman can recover damages.

But if performance is impossible, the distributor can be excused, so A is wrong.

Looking at option E: "The distributor's performance was not excused because of the illegality, but the woman can seek restitution."

Wait, no, if performance was impossible, it's excused, so E is wrong on the first part.

Looking at another option, let's see option E is incorrect on the first part. So perhaps none of the options are entirely correct, but I think I need to look for the best fit.

Wait, the question is about the legal relationship. So, the distributor's performance was not excusable because performance was impossible (due to the ban). So, the performance is excused.

So, the options that say the performance was excused: perhaps only option E and G.

Option E: "The distributor's performance was not excused because of the illegality, but the woman can seek restitution."

Wait, no. Because if performance was impossible, the distributor is excused, so E is incorrect on the first part.

Option G: "Both parties are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other."

Wait, if performance was impossible, the distributor is excused. But the woman can't perform the contract, so she can't recover damages either. So, neither can recover, meaning G says both parties are excused, but neither can recover. That would make sense.

Wait, but if the performance was impossible, G says both are excused, but neither can recover. So the correct answer would be G.

But wait, let's reevaluate. The distributer is excused because performance was impossible. So, the distributor is excused. The woman has a contract to plant the cymbidium. If the distributor can't perform, then the woman can't pursue the contract. So, neither can be excused. So, the answer would be that both are excused, but neither can recover.

Wait no, wait. If the performance is impossible, the distributor is excused. But the woman can't perform because the contract can't be enforced. So, the contract can't be enforced, but the woman can't perform either. So, in terms of contract law, the contract can't be performed, so the woman can't collect damages. Therefore, both the distributor and the woman can't perform, and neither can they collect damages. So, the correct answer would be G.

Looking at the options:

G says both are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.

Yes, that seems correct. Because the performance was impossible, the distributor is excused, and the contract can't be performed, so neither can collect damages.

Wait, but the government's ban might have been in effect, so the performance was impossible. So, the distributor's performance was excused because performance was impossible. So, the answer would be G.

Alternatively, looking at option E, which says the performance wasn't excused because of illegality. But in reality, performance was impossible, so E's first part is wrong. So, E is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is G, which states that both parties are excused because of impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.

The question revolves around the legal relationship between the distributor and the woman after the government banned the importation of cymbidiums from Japan. The key point is whether the distributor was excused from performance due to the impossibility of importing cymbidiums into the United States, given the government's ban. 

The distributor initially tried to acquire cymbidiums but faced the importation illegality, which was deemed impossible. This impossibility allows the distributor to be excused from performance under performance excusability. As a result, the distributor was able to perform the contract by acquiring the cymbidium. 

However, the woman then tried to pay $1,000, but the government's ban prevented the importation of cymbidiums. The contract could not be enforced because the cymbidiums were unavailable, and the woman also failed to perform the contract. This means neither the distributor nor the woman could claim damages or seek restitution, as the performance was impossible and the contract was unenforceable. 

Among the options provided, the correct answer is **G**, which states that both parties are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.

Answer: G
