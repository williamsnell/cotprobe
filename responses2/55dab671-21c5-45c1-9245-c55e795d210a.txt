Question:

A man works at a tire warehouse, where his job duties consist of loading tires onto trucks. The job is exhausting, and the warehouse is always short of personnel. One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire onto a truck by himself, he experienced a sharp and excruciating pain in his lower back. He did not report the incident to his employer, but continued to work. A week later, after work, he went to the doctor for treatment. The man then sues his employer, alleging that the employer failed to provide him with adequate assistance, safety equipment, and training to load heavy tractor tires, thereby contributing to his injury. The employer alleges that the man is merely trying to obtain compensation for an old back injury, unrelated to his employment. At trial, the man's doctor testified that the man told her that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck. The doctor's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.
B: admissible as a statement made in the course of treatment.
C: inadmissible as a violation of the physicianpatient privilege.
D: admissible as it is a statement of fact.
E: admissible as expert testimony.
F: admissible as it is a statement made in anticipation of litigation.
G: inadmissible as it is a speculative statement.
H: inadmissible as it is a biased statement.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: inadmissible as it is a self-serving statement.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about hearsay and statement exceptions. Let me break it down step by step. 

The question is about a man who works at a tire warehouse and is working on his job when he gets a severe back injury. He doesn't report to the employer, but a week later, after work, he goes to the doctor. The employer is suing him, claiming the employer didn't provide him with adequate safety equipment, training, or medical assistance, and he's claiming it's due to an old back injury unrelated to his job.

The options are about whether the doctor's statement is admissible. The options are A to J, each with a different legal status.

First, let's recall the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. It must meet several criteria to be admissible, especially exceptions like hearsay exception 10, which allows statements made in anticipation of litigation.

Now, the doctor's testimony in this case. She testified that he told her the pain started while loading the truck. So she's saying that he was loading a heavy tire, and the pain started during that action.

Wait, so the doctor is stating that he told her. That would be hearsay because she's asserting his injury. Now, does that statement qualify under any exception?

The exceptions include statements made in the course of treatment ( hearsay exception 10), statements made in anticipation of litigation (hearsay exception 9), and statements made with the intent to convince or influence.

Option B says it's admissible as a statement made in the course of treatment. That sounds correct because it's a statement made while the defendant is being treated, which is within the scope of treatment. 

Option A suggests it's admissible as a statement for medical diagnosis, but I think hearsay exceptions are more restrictive. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option F says it's admissible as anticipation of litigation. But in this case, the doctor is stating the event that happened after the injury, not before. So I'm not sure if she's making it for legal action. Also, in this case, she's the witness, so she's stating an event that happened after the injury. But in the context of the injury, perhaps she's using it to show that he was working when the injury occurred.

Wait, the issue is whether the statement is hearsay. The problem is whether the statement is within the hearsay exceptions.

So, if the doctor's statement is offered to prove that her patient (the man) was injured while working, that would be hearsay. Now, is that statement in the course of treatment or in anticipation?

In this scenario, the man was working on his job, and then the injury occurred later. The doctor tells the story of the injury happening after work. So when she says he told her about the pain, that's while he was working on his job (during treatment). So that's in the course of treatment, right?

Therefore, it's admissible under hearsay exception 10. So option B would be correct.

Wait, but option F says it's admissible as anticipation of litigation. I'm not sure if that applies here. Because the statement is about an injury that occurred after work, not before. So perhaps it's about an event that happened after the injury. So the statement is made in anticipation of litigation because the injury occurred after the treatment.

Alternatively, the statement is about the injury that the man experienced, and she's using it to prove that he was working when the injury occurred. So, the statement is about the injury, but it's made after the injury. So it's not about the injury itself but about the circumstances after the injury.

Wait, but the hearsay exception 9 allows statements made with the intent to cause further harm or injury. So if the doctor is using the statement to try to prove that the injury was caused by her statement, that might be hearsay exception 9.

But wait, in this case, she's saying that the pain started while loading the tire during his work. That's an injury that occurred after the injury itself. So the statement is about the injury that happened later, not before.

So maybe it's not a statement made with the intent to cause harm, but just to prove the injury happened. So option F is about anticipation, which is about making a statement before a lawsuit arises.

In this case, the injury occurred after the treatment, so the statement is made after the injury. So perhaps it's hearsay exception 9 because she's making a statement to prove that the injury was caused by her statement. So, the injury was caused by the injury itself, not by the statement she's making.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The statement is about the injury, not about the cause. So the injury itself is what happened. The statement is about the injury, which is a fact, not about the cause. So I think the statement is just an out-of-court statement made to prove the injury, so the exception would be hearsay exception 10.

Alternatively, if the statement is being used to show that the injury was caused by the statement, then it's hearsay exception 9.

Wait, let's think again. The issue is whether the statement is hearsay. If the doctor is offering that statement to prove the injury, that's hearsay. So she's using it to prove the injury.

Now, for hearsay exceptions, let's consider each option.

Option A: Admissible as statement for medical diagnosis. I think that's not a hearsay exception; it's a type of statement, but not hearsay. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Admissible as statement made in the course of treatment. That's hearsay exception 10. Because it's a statement made while the defendant is being treated for the injury.

Option C: Inadmissible as physician patient privilege. That's about privilege, not hearsay. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Admissible as a statement of fact. That's hearsay exception 15, but it's more about statements of fact than hearsay exceptions. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Admissible as expert testimony. That's a different situation, not hearsay, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Admissible as anticipation of litigation. So, if the statement is made in anticipation of a lawsuit, perhaps because the injury was occurring after the treatment. So, the doctor is making a statement after the injury, which is in anticipation of a possible lawsuit. So F could be correct.

Option G: Inadmissible as speculative statement. That's hearsay exception 16, which is about statements made with the intent to deceive. The doctor is stating a fact about the injury, not trying to deceive. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Inadmissible as biased statement. That's hearsay exception 17, about statements made with bias. The doctor isn't biased; she's just stating facts. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. That would be if it's not hearsay at all. But the statement is about an injury, so it's hearsay. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Inadmissible as self-serving statement. That's hearsay exception 18, about statements made with an objective purpose. The doctor is not trying to make the statement because she's trying to prove the injury occurred. So J is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is B and F.

Wait, but let me double-check. The doctor's statement is made after the injury. So it's in the course of treatment, so hearsay exception 10: statement made in the course of treatment. So B is correct.

But wait, could it also be hearsay exception 9? Because the statement is made in anticipation of a lawsuit. The injury occurred after the treatment, so the statement was made for the plaintiff's claim. So that's hearsay exception 9.

So both B and F could be correct. But looking at the options, each is a separate choice. So which one is correct?

Wait, the options are separate. So the question is, which is admissible. Let's see the options.

The question is, the doctor's testimony is admissible as hearsay. So the answer is B and F.

But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is correct.

Let me think again. The statement is about the injury, and the doctor is offering it to prove the injury occurred. It's in the course of treatment, so 10. But it's also made in anticipation of a lawsuit (since the injury occurred after treatment), so 9.

So both could be correct. But each option is only one choice. So I think either B or F would be correct. 

Wait, but the options are multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So looking back, the question is which option is admissible.

Option B is about being made in the course of treatment, which is a hearsay exception.

Option F is about being made in anticipation of litigation, which is another hearsay exception.

So does the doctor's statement fall under both exceptions? Or is it that it's only one exception?

In the context of this case, the doctor's statement is about the injury, which happened after the treatment. So she's making the statement in anticipation of a possible claim, which is hearsay exception 9.

So both B and F are correct only if the statement can be used as both. But the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, the options are exclusive: each is either correct or not. So which one applies?

I think the correct answer is that it's admissible as a statement made in the course of treatment, which is hearsay exception 10.

But then again, it's also made in anticipation of a potential claim, which is hearsay exception 9.

So depending on the context, both could be correct. But the options don't allow for both being correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what hearsay exceptions allow.

Option B is hearsay exception 10: statement made in the course of treatment. So the statement is made while the man was being treated for the injury. So that's within the scope of treatment, so it's admissible.

Option F is hearsay exception 9: statement made in anticipation of litigation. So it's made before the lawsuit is filed, which is in anticipation. So if the injury was occurring after the treatment, making the statement in anticipation would be hearsay 9.

So the doctor's statement is hearsay, but it's admissible under both hearsay exceptions 10 and 9. But the options only allow for one correct answer. So which one applies.

Wait, perhaps the statement is made in anticipation of litigation because he was working on his job, and the injury occurred after that. So when the injury happened, the doctor was making the statement in anticipation of a possible claim, so hearsay exception 9 applies.

So F is correct.

Alternatively, if the statement was made during treatment, as in B, then B is correct.

So which is the correct answer? Let me re-read the question.

The question is whether the statement is admissible. The man may have made the statement to try to prove that he was injured while working. The doctor is using it to prove that he was working when the injury occurred.

So the statement is hearsay, but whether it's admissible depends on which exception.

The statement is made in the course of treatment, so B is correct.

But also, the statement is made in anticipation of a possible claim, so F is correct.

But in the options, each is a separate statement, so the correct answer is both B and F. But the options are exclusive, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is B, as it's a statement made in the course of treatment.

Wait, but in that case, why would it be made in anticipation? Because the statement was made in the course of treatment, but the injury occurred later. So the statement is made during treatment, but the injury occurs after.

But that's about the context of the injury.

Perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose a defendant is injured while on trial. He tells his lawyer that he was working on the case, and the injury occurred after the trial. His lawyer offers that statement as a statement of fact. Would that be hearsay?

The lawyer is not trying to prove the injury occurred; he's trying to prove the defendant was injured. So the statement is hearsay. But if the lawyer is using it to show that the injury occurred, then it's hearsay exception 9 because the statement is made in anticipation of litigation.

Wait, but when the injury occurred, the lawyer is making the statement in anticipation of possible claim, so that's hearsay exception 9.

Alternatively, if the statement was made during treatment, then it's hearsay 10.

So in this scenario, the statement is made in the course of treatment, so B is correct.

But the injury happened after the treatment. So the statement was made while the man was being treated, but the injury occurred after that. So the statement is made during treatment, which is hearsay exception 10.

But also, if the injury occurred after the treatment, the statement was made in anticipation of a potential claim, which is hearsay exception 9.

So both B and F could apply. But the options don't allow for both. So perhaps the correct answer is B, because that's the primary exception applicable.

Wait, but the question is about whether the statement is admissible. The statement is hearsay, but it's in the course of treatment, so B is correct.

Another angle: the statement is made during treatment, so it's hearsay exception 10. So B is correct. The fact that the injury occurred after treatment is irrelevant to the hearsay exception, but it's about the context. So the statement is hearsay and is admissible under exception 10.

Alternatively, if it's made in anticipation, then exception 9 applies.

But which one is the correct answer? The options are:

B: admissible as statement made in course of treatment.

F: admissible as statement made in anticipation of litigation.

The correct answer would be both, but the options don't have both. So perhaps both are correct, but in the given options, only one is correct, so perhaps the intended answer is B.

The question revolves around whether the doctor's statement is admissible as hearsay. The key issue is determining which hearsay exception applies. The statement was made during the defendant's treatment for the injury and is offered to prove the injury occurred. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as a statement for medical diagnosis because it is not a statement of fact. It is hearsay and falls under a hearsay exception.
  
- **Option B**: Correct. The statement is admissible as a statement made in the course of treatment under hearsay exception 10. This exception applies because the statement was made while the defendant was being treated for the injury.
  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as it is not a statement for medical diagnosis. It is hearsay and falls under a hearsay exception.
  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as a statement of fact because it is hearsay, not a factual statement.
  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as expert testimony because it is not about testimony.
  
- **Option F**: Correct. The statement is admissible as a statement made in anticipation of litigation under hearsay exception 9. This exception applies because the injury occurred after the defendant's treatment, and the statement was made to prove the injury occurred.
  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as it is a statement of fact.
  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as it is not biased.
  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as it is not hearsay.
  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as it is not self-serving.

Both **B** and **F** are correct, but since the question requires selecting one answer, the primary exception that applies is **B** (made in the course of treatment), as it directly relates to the defendant's treatment history.

ANSWER: B
