Question:

The owner of a large unimproved tract of land leased it to a tenant for five years at a monthly rental of $1,500. The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. "The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?

Options:

A: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.
B: The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement.
C: The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.
D: The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers, thereby breaching his responsibilities under the agreement.
E: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.
F: The owner had no legal obligation to share the proceeds of the sale as the tenant had continued to live on the property rent-free for a year.
G: The owner's agreement to pay the tenant was conditional upon the sale price exceeding $250,000, which it did not.
H: The tenant's decision to farm the land was against the rental agreement and hence, a violation of the contract.
I: The tenant's construction of the barn without the owner's explicit permission was a breach of the lease agreement.
J: The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant.

Okay, so I've got this tort law question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

So, the scenario: A landowner leased a tract to a tenant for five years at $1,500/month. The land is supposed to be farmed, and the tenant built a barn on it for $15ft x20ft on loose bricks. This barn increased the value from $250k to $275k. Then, the landowner notifies the tenant that it's going up for sale next month. The tenant's next month's rent was $1,000 per month. But the owner reduced the asking price to $260k, which was a big drop. Then, the tenant moved out after some issues. Finally, the seller sold it for $256k.

The tenant sued for damages because they didn't pay the last two months' rent, which was supposed to be $1,500 each. The question is, which argument in the options is the owner's most persuasive?

First, I need to understand the facts. The barn was built on the land as farmland, but it's not farmed yet. The owner's initial price was $250k, then it went up to $275k, then the tenant's claim is about the rent. The key point is the barn. The barn was constructed without the owner's permission, right?

But wait, the barn is a construction on the land, which is also part of the land use. The land was leased as farmland, but the owner had to pay the rent. The barn requires the land to be used as farmland, but the owner didn't make it part of the land use. The land owner could claim that the barn built on the land is a constructive improvement, which could affect the value of the land. But here, the owner didn't have the barn in his possession, so I think the land's value might have increased because of the barn. But the barn was built on the land as farmland, so maybe the value went up. But the question is about the landlord's argument for the tenant's suit.

The tenant's breach of contract: They didn't pay the last two rent payments. The owner agreed to pay two-thirds of the sale proceeds over $250k, but in reality, the asking price was $260k, which is below the $250k threshold. Wait, no, $260k is the asking price, and the owner's contract said "provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it." So, if the asking price is $260k and the tenant is paying two-thirds over that, which is more than $250k, then the owner would pay. But wait, the owner's asking price was $260k, which is higher than $250k, so the two-thirds is over $250k. So the owner would pay that. But in the court, the owner reduced the price to $260k, which is above the threshold. Wait, the threshold is $250k, so any amount over would trigger the two-thirds payment.

But the tenant didn't pay the rent for two months. The owner agreed to pay two-thirds of the sale proceeds over $250k. But the asking price was $260k, so that's above $250k. So the owner would pay two-thirds of $260k, which is $173,333. But the tenancy didn't pay the rent. So the owner's duty is to pay, and the tenant breached by not paying.

So the owner's argument is that the tenant breached their contract by not paying the rent. But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate. Wait, that's about the land use. The barn was built on the land, so perhaps the land is now part of the tenancy's property. The tenancy had a lease as farmland, but built a barn. The landowner's agreement could be that the barn should be part of the tenancy's land. But the tenancy built the barn, not the landowner. So the tenancy's actions could be seen as part of their contract, but the landowner's breach is about not fulfilling their obligations under the lease.

Wait, the initial agreement was a lease to the tenant, who had to pay rent and use the land as farmland, which includes building structures on the land, but the landowner didn't have the barn in their possession. So the landowner's duty to the tenant was to manage the land as per the lease, including the barn. But the tenancy built the barn, so perhaps the landowner is in breach because they didn't have the barn, which is a part of the tenancy's land. So the landowner could claim that the barn is a constructive improvement, thus increasing the value of the land.

But the question is about the tenancy's breach. The tenancy didn't pay the rent. The landowner had a contract where, if the asking price was above $250k, the owner would pay two-thirds over that. So the asking price was $260k, which is over $250k. So the owner agreed to pay two-thirds of the sale proceeds over $250k. But the tenant didn't pay the rent for two months. So the tenancy breached their contract by not paying the rent. So the owner's duty is to perform, and the tenant breached by not fulfilling.

So the argument would be that the owner breached by not paying the rent, which is a breach of contract because the tenancy didn't perform their obligations under the lease.

Looking at the options, option E says: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.

Wait, but does the rent fall under the contract? The initial agreement said the tenancy pays $1,500/month. So the tenancy's breach would be paying less than that. The question is whether that's a breach of contract. The tenancy didn't pay, so that's a breach. So the tenancy breached by not fulfilling their contract. So the owner's argument would be that the tenancy breached their obligations under the lease.

But the question is which argument the owner is most persuasive in their defense. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: Uncured breach of an implied promise. That's about the land useâ€”the tenancy built on the land, which might be considered part of the land use. But the landowner's initial agreement was that the tenancy had to manage the land as per the lease, including the barn. So the landowner's breach is about not fulfilling their obligations, not about the land being used as farmland.

Option E says the tenancy's failure to pay is a breach that discharged the owner's remaining duties. That's correct in a sense, because if the tenancy doesn't pay, and the owner agreed to pay over a certain amount, then the payment would be due. So the tenancy breached, and the owner's remaining duties were discharged because the tenancy didn't pay. So the owner's argument is that the breaching tenancy (the tenant) breached their contract, and that breached contract discharged the owner's remaining duties. So the owner's argument is that the tenancy breached their contract, and that breached contract terminated the owner's obligations.

So the options are:

E: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.

That seems correct. Because the tenancy didn't pay, and the owner agreed to pay two-thirds of the sale proceeds over $250k. So the repairs are due. So the tenancy breached, and the owner's remaining duties (to pay) were discharged because the tenancy didn't pay.

Wait, but the contract is about the tenancy paying their rent. So the tenancy breached by not paying the rent. So the owner's contract is to pay. So the breach is the tenancy not paying, which is a breach of contract, and that breached contract is discharged because the tenancy failed to perform. So yes, E makes sense.

Other options: For example, option G says the owner agreed to pay under certain conditions, but the conditions weren't met. But the rent was not paid, and the asking price was below the threshold, but that's not the case. The asking price was $260k, which is over $250k, so the owner agreed to pay. But the tenant didn't pay, so that's a breach. The option E is that the breach caused the owner's remaining duties to discharge.

So the correct answer would be E.
</think>

The question revolves around the tenant's breach of contract and the owner's argument in defense. The key facts are as follows:

1. **Initial Agreement**: The tenant was leased to the landowner for five years at $1,500/month. The land was supposed to be farmed, but the tenant built a barn on it for $15ft x 20ft on loose bricks. This barn increased the land's value from $250k to $275k.

2. **Reduction in Asking Price**: The owner initially set the asking price at $250k, then raised it to $275k, and later reduced it to $260k. The tenant's next month's rent was $1,000, which was lower than the agreed rent, likely due to the barn's cost.

3. **Landowner's Agreement**: The landowner's contract allowed the tenancy to remain on the land for a year at a reduced rent, provided the asking price was above $250k, and the tenancy could remain on the land for two more months at the agreed rent.

4. **Tenant's Breach**: The tenancy failed to pay the last two months' rent as per the agreement, which constitutes a material breach of contract.

### Analysis of Options:

- **Option A**: The tenancy's breach of promise to cooperate in the land use (building the barn) is not a material breach under the lease agreement. The issue is the tenancy's breach of contract by not fulfilling the lease obligations, not the land use.

- **Option B**: The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant is a breach of contract because the contract clearly outlined the conditions under which the asking price was set.

- **Option C**: A restraint on alienation is irrelevant because the barn was built on the land as part of the tenancy's responsibilities under the lease agreement.

- **Option D**: The tenancy's actions did not necessarily impair the land's condition, and thus they did not violate the contract.

- **Option E**: The tenancy's failure to pay rent is a material breach of contract. The owner's agreement required the tenancy to remain on the land for two more months at the agreed rent. The tenancy's breach of contract caused the owner's remaining duties (to pay rent) to be discharged.

- **Option F**: Anticipatory repudiation is not relevant here; the tenancy simply failed to pay, not to leave the land.

- **Option G**: While the asking price was above $250k, the contract did not require the tenancy to remain on the land; the owner's agreement allowed for a reduction in rent.

- **Option H**: The barn was a constructive improvement, but the tenancy's actions did not violate the lease contract.

- **Option I**: The tenancy's actions did not constitute a violation of the lease agreement.

- **Option J**: Anticipatory repudiation is not relevant.

### Conclusion:

The owner's strongest argument is that the tenant's failure to pay rent is a material breach of contract, which discharged the owner's remaining duties to pay. This aligns with **Option E**.
