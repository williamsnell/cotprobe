Okay, so I have this question about Brownian motion. Hmm, Brownian motion is that random process, right? It's often called the Wiener process. The question is about finding the conditional probability density function (PDF) of W(s) given that W(t) = 2, where s is 1/2 and t is 1. Then I need to find the mean and variance of that conditional distribution.

Wait, I remember that Brownian motion has some properties, like being a Gaussian process, meaning that the increments are normally distributed. Also, the increments are independent, and the variance is proportional to the time interval.

So, the process is W(t). Given that W(t) = 2, what's the distribution of W(s)? I think the conditional expectation and variance can be found using the properties of Brownian motion.

The formula I recall is that for W(s) given W(t), the expectation is E[W(s)|W(t)] = W(t) * s/t. Since s is 1/2 and t is 1, that would be 1/2 * 1/1 = 1/2. So the conditional mean is 0.5.

For the variance, the formula I remember is Var(W(s)|W(t)) = (s/t) * Var(W(t)). The variance of W(t) is t, so this becomes (s/t)*t = s. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, because the variance is proportional to the time. So Var(W(t)) is t. So when we condition on W(t) = 2, the variance would be (s/t) * Var(W(t)). Since Var(W(t)) is t, it's (s/t)*t = s. So that's 1/2. So the variance is 0.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another approach: the conditional distribution of W(s) given W(t) is Gaussian. So, the mean is E[W(s)|W(t)] = (s/t) W(t) = (1/2)*2 = 1/2 * 2 = 1? Wait no, wait. Wait, W(t) is given to be 2. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, the mean is (s/t) * W(t) = (1/2)*2 = 1, but wait, that can't be right because W(t) is given as 2, so the conditional expectation should be 2*(s/t) = 1? Or wait, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's E[W(s) | W(t)] = (s/t) W(t). So when W(t) is 2, then E[W(s)] is (1/2)*2=1. So the conditional mean is 1. Then the variance would be (s/t) * Var(W(t)).

But the variance of W(t) is t, so Var(W(s)|W(t)=2) would be (s/t)*t = s = 1/2. So variance is 0.5.

Wait, but let me think about the process. Brownian motion increments are independent increments, right? So the increment from s to t is W(t) - W(s), which is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance t-s. But in this case, W(t) is given as 2. So the distribution of W(s) given that W(t)=2 is a normal distribution with mean (1/2)*2 = 1 and variance (1/2)^2*(1 - 1/2) ?

Wait, no, maybe that's another way to look at it. The variance between W(s) and W(t) is t-s. So the variance of W(s) given W(t) would be (s^2)/(t) * Var(W(t)) because of the formula for conditional variance in Gaussian variables.

Wait, I think the correct formula is Var(W(s)|W(t)) = s^2 / t * Var(W(t)). Since Var(W(t)) = t, this becomes s^2 / t * t = s^2. So s is 1/2, so variance is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me get this straight.

If X and Y are jointly Gaussian, with X ~ N(μ_x, σ_x²), Y ~ N(μ_y, σ_y²), and Y is correlated with X, then the conditional distribution of X given Y = y is Gaussian with mean μ_x + (σ_x / σ_y) (y - μ_y), and variance σ_x² (1 - (ρ σ_y²)/(σ_x²)) ), where ρ is the correlation coefficient.

Alternatively, the conditional variance is Var(X) (1 - ρ²) / Var(Y).

In the case where X is W(s) and Y is W(t), both being Gaussian. The correlation coefficient ρ between W(s) and W(t) is s/t, since the covariance is s. So the variance of X given Y is Var(X) (1 - (s/t)^2).

Var(X) is s, because W(s) has variance s, and Var(Y) is t.

So substituting, Var(X|Y) = s (1 - (s/t)^2 ) = s ( (t^2 - s^2 ) / t^2 )

So for our case, s=1/2, t=1.

Var(X|Y=2) = (1/2) (1 - ( (1/2)^2 ) / 1^2 ) = (1/2)(1 - 1/4) = (1/2)(3/4) )= 3/8 = 0.375.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation, which was 0.5.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the conditional variance formula and the other approach.

Wait, another approach: since W(t) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t, when conditioning on W(t) = 2, the distribution of W(s) is normal with mean μ = (s/t) * 2, and variance σ² = s(1 - (s/t)^2) * Var(W(t)).

Wait, that's different.

Wait, no: when you have W(t) normally distributed, and you condition on W(t)=2, the distribution of W(s) is normal with mean (s/t)*2 and variance s(1 - (s/t)^2 ) * Var(W(t)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get back to the basics.

If W(t) is a Brownian motion, then it's a Gaussian process. So W(t) ~ N(0, t). Given that W(t) = 2, what is the distribution of W(s)?

The conditional expectation is E[W(s) | W(t) = 2] = [s/t] * 2. Because the covariance between W(s) and W(t) when s < t is s, so the conditional expectation is (s/t) * 2.

The conditional variance is Var(W(s)) - Cov(W(s), W(s)) * (1 - (Cov(W(s), W(t))/Var(W(t)) )) ?

Wait, perhaps the formula for variance when conditioning is Var(W(s)|W(t)) = Var(W(s)) * (1 - (Cov(W(s), W(t))/Var(W(t)))^2 )

But I'm not sure. Another way is to consider that the conditional variance is Var(W(s)) * (1 - (s/t)^2 ), since the correlation between W(s) and W(t) is s/t.

So Var(W(s)|W(t)) = Var(W(s)) * (1 - (s/t)^2 ) = s * (1 - s²/t²) = s(1 - s²/t²).

For s=1/2, t=1:

Var = (1/2) (1 - (1/2)^2 ) = (1/2)(3/4) )= 3/8 = 0.375.

Wait, but then the mean is (1/2)*2 = 1. So the distribution is N(1, 3/8). That would be a mean of 1 and variance of 0.375, which is 3/8.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the answer options have variance 0.375. Let's check the options. The options are A: [0.5, 0.5], B: [0.5, 0.25], C: [2.0, 0.25], D: [2.0, 1.0], E: [0, 0.5], F: [2.0, 0.5], G: [1.0, 0.5], H: [0.25, 1.0], I: [1.5, 0.75], J: [1.0, 0.25}.

Hmm, 0.375 is not among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate the problem. The question is asking for the conditional PDF of W(s)=1/2 given that W(t)=2.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it in terms of conditional distribution.

The process W(t) is a Gaussian process. So the conditional distribution of W(s) given W(t) is Gaussian. So we can calculate the mean and variance as follows.

The mean is E[W(s)|W(t)] = (s/t) * W(t) = (1/2) * 2 = 1. So mean is 1.

The variance is Var(W(s)|W(t)) = s * (1 - (s/t)^2) ) * Var(W(t)) / Var(W(t)) )? Wait, no, perhaps it's Var(W(s)) * (1 - (s/t)^2) because the correlation between W(s) and W(t) is s/t.

Wait, no, Var(W(s)|W(t)) = Var(W(s)) * (1 - (s/t)^2) because the variance of W(s) is s and the variance of W(t) is t. So the conditional variance is s * (1 - (s^2 / t^2)).

So for s=1/2, t=1. So:

Var = (1/2)(1 - (1/2)^2 )= (1/2)(3/4) = 3/8 = 0.375.

So the distribution is N(1, 0.375). But none of the options have variance 0.375. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me try another approach. Since W(t) is Brownian motion, the increment W(t) - W(s) is Gaussian with mean 0 and variance t-s. Given that, the conditional distribution of W(s) given W(t) = 2.

So, W(t) = W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)). Let me denote X = W(s), Y = W(t)-W(s). Then, Y is Gaussian with mean 0 and variance t-s.

So, given Y = 2, X is Gaussian with mean E[X] = E[W(s)|Y=2], and variance Var(X) = Var(W(s)) - Cov(X,Y)^2 / Var(Y).

But Cov(X,Y) is E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]. Since E[Y] = 0, Cov(X,Y) = E[XY].

E[XY] = E[ W(s) * (W(t) - W(s)) ] = E[ W(s) W(t) - (W(s))^2 ].

But W(s) W(t) is a covariance term. Since W(s) and W(t) are jointly Gaussian, the covariance is s. So E[ W(s) W(t) ] = s.

And E[ (W(s))^2 ] is Var(W(s)) = s.

So E[XY] = s - s = 0.

Wait, so Cov(X,Y) = 0. So X and Y are uncorrelated. But since both are Gaussian, they are independent.

Wait, but that can't be. Because X and Y are dependent variables, even if independent in distribution? Hmm, no, that's possible. So if X and Y are dependent but independent in distribution, that could happen.

Wait, but if X and Y are independent, then Var(X|Y=2) = Var(X) = s = 1/2.

But wait, that's the case if X and Y are independent. But earlier I thought that in Gaussian variables, if they are uncorrelated, then they are independent. So in this case, since W(s) and W(t) are uncorrelated, given W(t) = 2, W(s) is independent of W(t). Because if X and Y are jointly Gaussian and uncorrelated, they are independent.

Ah, right! So if X and Y are uncorrelated, their conditional distribution is X | Y=2 is N(E[X|Y=2], Var(X)), and since they are independent, Var(X) remains s.

Wait, but I thought earlier that if they have zero covariance, they are independent. So then the conditional variance is just Var(X) = s.

But if X and Y are independent, then the variance of X given Y is just the variance of X, which is s.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, when I used the formula, I got a different variance. So perhaps I made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, let me think again. So, if X and Y are uncorrelated, then Var(X|Y=2) = Var(X) = s. So in this case, Var(X) is (1/2).

But wait, earlier when I used the formula Var(W(s)|W(t)) = s * (1 - (s/t)^2 ), I got 3/8, which is 0.375. But now, if X and Y are independent, the conditional variance is s=1/2.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should clarify: when X and Y are uncorrelated and jointly Gaussian, they are independent. So, in that case, the conditional variance is just the variance of X.

But wait, if X and Y are independent, then they are also uncorrelated. So in that case, the variance of X given Y is s.

So, in this problem, since W(s) and W(t) are uncorrelated (since Cov(W(s), W(t)) = s for s < t), given W(t)=2, W(s) is independent of W(t). So the conditional variance is just s=1/2, and the mean is E[W(s)|W(t)=2] = E[W(s)] + Cov(W(s), W(t))/Var(W(t)) * W(t) = 0 + (s/t)*2 = (1/2)*2=1. So the mean is 1 and the variance is 1/2.

So the conditional distribution is N(1, 1/2).

Looking at the options, is there an option with mean 1 and variance 0.5? Let's see.

Option G is [1.0, 0.5], which is [1, 0.5]. So that would match.

But wait, earlier when I used the formula with covariance, I got a variance of 0.375, which is not an option. So perhaps I was mistaken in that approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the conditional variance when X and Y are uncorrelated is Var(X|Y=y) = Var(X) - [Cov(X,Y)/Var(Y)]^2 Var(X), but if Var(X,Y) is zero, that's zero. But that can't be right because if they are uncorrelated, their covariance is zero, so Var(X|Y)=Var(X).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The formula for the conditional variance of X given Y is Var(X) * (1 - (E[XY]/Var(Y))^2). Since Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y], and if E[Y]=0, Cov(X,Y)=E[XY]. But if X and Y are independent, then E[XY] = E[X]E[Y] = 0. So Cov(X,Y)=0.

So Var(X|Y) = Var(X) * (1 - (0/Var(Y))^2 ) = Var(X) * 1. So Var(X|Y)=Var(X).

So if X and Y are independent, the conditional variance is Var(X), which is s=1/2.

So that would make the conditional distribution N(1, 1/2).

Looking at the options, that's option G: [1.0, 0.5].

But let me make sure. Another way: the conditional distribution of W(s) given W(t)=2 is N( (s/t)*2, s*(1 - (s/t)^2) ).

Wait, that's when they are dependent. But in this case, since W(t) and W(s) are uncorrelated, the conditional variance is just their variance, so s=1/2.

So the correct mean is 1, variance is 1/2.

Looking at the options, that's option G.

The question involves finding the conditional probability density function (PDF) of \( W(s) \) given \( W(t) = 2 \), where \( 0 < s < t \). Here, \( W(t) \) is a standard Brownian motion. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Understanding Brownian Motion Properties**: Brownian motion is a Gaussian process with independent increments and normally distributed values. The increments are Gaussian with mean 0 and variance equal to the time interval.

2. **Conditional Distribution**: For jointly Gaussian random variables \( X \) and \( Y \), the conditional distribution of \( X \) given \( Y = y \) is Gaussian with mean:
   \[
   \mu_X|Y = \mu_X + \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\text{Var}(Y)}(y - \mu_Y)
   \]
   and variance:
   \[
   \text{Var}(X|Y = y) = \text{Var}(X) - \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)^2}{\text{Var}(Y)}
   \]

3. **Application to Brownian Motion**: Let \( X = W(s) \) and \( Y = W(t) \). Given \( Y = 2 \), the conditional distribution of \( X \) is Gaussian. The mean and variance are calculated as follows:
   - **Mean**: \( \mu_X|Y = E[W(s)|W(t) = 2] = \frac{s}{t} \cdot 2 = 1 \).
   - **Variance**: \( \text{Var}(W(s)|W(t) = 2) = \text{Var}(W(s)) - \frac{\text{Cov}(W(s), W(t))^2}{\text{Var}(W(t))} \). Since \( \text{Cov}(W(s), W(t)) = s \) and \( \text{Var}(W(t)) = t \), this simplifies to \( s \). For \( s = 1/2 \) and \( t = 1 \), \( \text{Var}(W(s)|W(t) = 2) = 1/2 \).

4. **Conclusion**: The conditional distribution of \( W(s) \) given \( W(t) = 2 \) is \( \mathcal{N}(1, 1/2) \). Among the provided options, this corresponds to option G: \([1.0, 0.5]\).
