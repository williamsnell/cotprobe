Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about fruit flies and their eye color alleles. The males have alleles (R, W) and the females also have (R, W). Oh wait, wait, R and W are for red and white eyes, right? 

So the question is about the conditional probability. The setup is that the offspring's eyes are white if they have either two white alleles or one red and one white. Given that the offspring's eyes are white, what's the probability that they have two white alleles? 

Wait, so the problem is about conditional probability. I remember conditional probability formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Here, event A is having two white alleles, and event B is having white eyes. So I need to find the probability that both A and B happen, divided by the probability that B happens.

But wait, wait, wait. Since A is part of B, because having two white alleles (WW) certainly leads to white eyes, then P(A and B) is just P(A). So the conditional probability is P(A) / P(B).

So first, let me figure out what's the possible outcomes when the offspring gets alleles from their parents.

The male fly has alleles R and W. So for each parent, each allele is equally likely to be passed on. Wait, but the male is a male, so he's XY, and I think for males, it's a bit different. But wait, in this problem, the parents are both fruit flies, so each parent has two alleles for eye color. Wait, the description says: the male's alleles are (R, W), and the female's are (R, W). So, perhaps each parent contributes one allele to the offspring. 

Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the males have alleles (R, W) and the females have (R, W). So the male's genotype for eye color is R and W, and the female's is R and W. Wait, but that's for each parent. So for a male, would that be the two alleles he has, R and W? Or is it that each parent has two alleles, but the male's alleles are (R and W) meaning he has one R and one W allele? Or perhaps the notation is different. Wait, perhaps the male has alleles R and W for eye color, which would imply that each of his two alleles is R and W. Or maybe it's a typo, and each parent has two alleles. Wait, perhaps the problem uses R and W to represent the two alleles, so each parent has two alleles for eye color. 

Wait, the problem states the alleles for the fruit flies are R and W. So male fruit flies have (R, W) as their alleles, meaning each has one R and one W. Or wait, no, perhaps each parent is diploid, so the male has two alleles, one R and one W. Similarly, the female has two alleles, one R and one W. So when they have an offspring, they receive one allele from each parent. So the offspring has one allele from the male and one from the female.

Wait, wait, but wait. The male's genotype is (R, W), so the father contributes one R and one W allele. The mother's genotype is (R, W), so she contributes one R and one W. So the possible alleles each parent can contribute are R and W. So when the offspring gets one from each parent, the possible combinations are:

- R (from father) and R (from mother): RR
- R (from father) and W (from mother): RW
- W (from father) and R (from mother): WR
- W (from father) and W (from mother): WW

Wait, but since R and W are different alleles, the order doesn't matter. So the possible genotypic combinations are R/R, R/W, W/W. But wait, in this case, each parent contributes one allele, so the offspring could be RR, RW, or WW. But wait, no, because each parent's contribution is R and W. So the possible genotypic combinations for the offspring are:

- R (from father) and R (from mother): RR
- R (father) and W (mother): RW
- W (father) and R (mother): WR
- W (father) and W (mother): WW

Wait, but the alleles are R and W, so these are the four possible combinations. But since R and W are different, each of these four is a possible outcome. So the four possible outcomes are: RR, RW, WR, WW.

Wait, but in terms of probability, each outcome is equally likely, given the problem statement says each of the four possibilities has equal probability. So the probability of each is 1/4.

Now, the problem states that the offspring's eyes look white if they have either two white alleles (WW) or one red and one white (RW/WR). So the condition is that the offspring's eyes are white. So the possible outcomes that satisfy this condition are WW and RW (since RW and WR are the same as RW in terms of having one R and one W). Wait, no, wait. The problem says that if the offspring has two white alleles or one red and one white, their eyes are white. So the two cases are:

1. WW: two white alleles → eyes white.
2. RW or WR: one R, one W → eyes white.

So the total number of white eye color outcomes is WW + RW + WR. That's three cases. So the total possible outcomes for the offspring are four (RR, RW, WR, WW). But wait, the problem says that each of the four possible outcomes has equal probability. So each of the four is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the offspring has eyes white if they have either two white alleles (WW) or one red and one white (RW or WR). So the white eye color outcomes are WW, RW, and WR. That's three outcomes. So the probability that the offspring has white eyes is 3/4, because there's a 3/4 chance of being WW, RW, or WR. Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, the problem states that each of the four possible outcomes has equal probability. So each outcome (RR, RW, WR, WW) is 25% chance. So the total of the three white eye color outcomes is 3/4. But wait, the problem is phrased a bit differently: the question is, given that the offspring's eyes look white, what's the probability that it has two white alleles. So in this case, the conditional probability is P(A|B), where B is the event that the offspring has white eyes.

So event A is the event that the offspring has two white alleles (WW). Event B is the event that the offspring has white eyes, which includes the outcomes where the offspring has two white alleles or one red and one white.

But wait, actually, all the cases where the offspring has two white alleles (WW) are part of the B event. So the B event includes all possible outcomes except those where the offspring has one red and one white allele. Wait, no, no, wait: the problem says that if the offspring has two white alleles OR one red and one white, their eyes are white. So B is the event that the offspring's eyes are white, which includes all possible outcomes except those where the offspring has one red and one white. Because, for example, if the offspring has a red allele and a white allele, their eyes are white.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem states that an offspring's eyes look white if it has either two white alleles (so WW) or one red and one white (RW or WR). So those are the only cases where the offspring's eyes are white. So the B event is that the offspring has two white alleles or one red and one white. So the B outcomes are WW, RW, and WR, which are three outcomes.

The total of four possible outcomes, each with probability 1/4. So the B probability is 3/4.

But wait, the problem is phrased as: given that the offspring's eyes look white, what's the probability that it has two white alleles. So P(A|B) is P(A and B) / P(B). But since A is a subset of B (A is WW, B is WW, RW, WR), then A and B is just A. So P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/4) / (3/4) )= 1/3.

Wait, but wait, because there are four possible outcomes, each with equal probability. So P(A) is 1/4 (the probability of WW), and P(B) is 3/4 (since B includes WW, RW, and WR). So the conditional probability is (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.

Wait, that's option A: 1/3. But wait, wait, another approach: the four possible outcomes, each with 1/4 probability. The B event includes WW, RW, and WR. So the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1 (WW). The number of favorable outcomes for B is 3 (WW, RW, WR). So the conditional probability is 1/3.

So the correct answer should be A, 1/3.

Wait, but another way to think about this is using Bayes' theorem. Let's model it:

Let me denote the four possible offspring genotypes as:

1. R (from father) and R (from mother): RR (probability 1/4)
2. R (from father) and W (from mother): RW (probability 1/4)
3. W (from father) and R (from mother): WR (probability 1/4)
4. W (from father) and W (from mother): WW (probability 1/4)

Now, the B event is the event that the offspring has white eyes. That happens when the genotype is either RR (eyes red), or RW, or WR. So the B event includes genotypes 2,3,4. So P(B) = (1/4 + 1/4 +1/4) = 3/4.

The event A is having two white alleles. That's just WW (genotype 4). So P(A) is 1/4.

The conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability that the genotype is WW given that the eyes are white. So:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/4) / (3/4) )= 1/3.

So the answer is A: 1/3.

The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that an offspring has two white alleles (WW) for eye color, given that their eyes are white. Here's the analysis:

1. **Possible Offspring Genotypes**: Each parent contributes one allele (R or W) to the offspring, leading to four possible genotypes:
   - RR: Probability = 1/4
   - RW: Probability = 1/4
   - WR: Probability = 1/4
   - WW: Probability = 1/4

2. **Definition of the Event B (White Eyes)**: The offspring's eyes are white if they have either two white alleles (WW) or one red and one white allele (RW/WR). This includes genotypes WW, RW, and WR.

3. **Probability of Event B (P(B))**: There are three favorable outcomes (WW, RW, WR) out of four possible outcomes. Thus:
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

4. **Event A (WW Genotype)**: The event that the offspring has two white alleles. There is only one favorable outcome (WW) out of four possible outcomes. Thus:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

5. **Conditional Probability (P(A|B))**: Using the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \), where \( A \cap B \) is the intersection of A and B (i.e., WW), we get:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the conditional probability that the offspring has two white alleles for eye color, given that their eyes are white, is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
