Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an elevator. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about determining the tension in the elevator cables. The options are various combinations of values the person would need to know. 

Hmm, elevator problems usually involve forces, right? I remember that when an elevator is moving, the tension in the cable isn't just its weight because there could be acceleration involved. So when it's moving upward, the tension must be higher than just mg (mass times gravity). 

Wait, the formula for tension in an elevator when it's accelerating upwards is T = m(g + a), where a is the acceleration. So Tension depends on both mass and acceleration. If the elevator is accelerating downward, like when braking, then the formula changes to T = m(g - a). But the question is about determining the tension, so I think the acceleration is part of what's needed.

So what other values do I need? The mass is definitely necessary because it affects the tension. Without knowing the mass, I can't find the tension. 

Now, looking at the options. Let's go through them. 

Option A: Mass, velocity, and acceleration. Velocity is about the elevator's speed, but without acceleration, how do I find tension? Because velocity could be changing, but without knowing the acceleration, I can't tell if it's speeding up or slowing down. Plus, I don't see how velocity is directly involved in the tension calculation. So A might not be right.

Option B: Mass, velocity, height, and acceleration. Height isn't directly part of the tension formula. Plus, I don't think you need height because the problem is about the force, not about the elevator moving up or down in space. So B seems incorrect.

Option C: Mass and velocity. Velocity is a part of the problem, but how is it used? If the elevator is moving with a certain velocity, that might relate to its kinetic energy, but tension is a force. Wait, velocity isn't directly used in the tension formula. So C might not be correct either.

Option D: Velocity, height, and acceleration. Height again is probably not needed, and velocity is similar to A. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Velocity and acceleration. Wait, without mass, how would you get tension? Because T = m(g + a). So you need mass, not just velocity. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Mass, height, and acceleration. Height isn't part of the tension formula, so F is out.

Option G: Mass and acceleration. That's two things I definitely need. Because if I know mass and acceleration, I can compute tension. So G seems correct.

Wait, but what about the height? Oh right, in some problems, you might use height to find potential energy, but that's for determining potential energy, not tension. Tension is a force from the elevator's weight and acceleration, so height isn't needed. So F is out.

Option H: Mass and height. No, height isn't needed.

Option I: Mass, acceleration, and friction. Hmm, friction is a separate force. When considering friction, the formula would be T = m(g + a) + friction. But the question is about the tension needed to determine it. So if I know mass, acceleration, and friction, I can compute T. But how common is knowing friction in such problems? I don't think that's part of the standard approach. The question is about the elevator's tension, and friction is an additional force. So I think the correct answer is the ones that include mass and acceleration, without friction. So G is better.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is about the tension in the cables. The formula for tension is T = m(g + a) if the elevator is moving upwards with acceleration a. But if the elevator is moving downward, then T = m(g - a). So the key variables are mass and acceleration. 

Velocity isn't directly part of the tension formula. So in order to find the tension, you need mass (option G) and acceleration (also G includes acceleration, so G is correct). 

Looking back at the options, option G is "Mass and acceleration." That's the only one that includes both essential variables. So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

To determine the tension in the cables of an elevator, the essential variables are the mass of the elevator and its acceleration. The tension is calculated using the formula \( T = m(g \pm a) \), where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity and \( a \) is the acceleration of the elevator (either upward or downward). 

Analyzing the options, only option G, which includes both mass and acceleration, correctly identifies the necessary variables to calculate tension. Other options either include irrelevant variables (like velocity, height, or friction) or are missing a key component (like acceleration). 

ANSWER: G
