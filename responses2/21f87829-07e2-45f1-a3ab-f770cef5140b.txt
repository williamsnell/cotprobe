Okay, so I've got this problem about group theory, specifically about homomorphisms. The function f is given from U_5 to U_5, where U_5 is the multiplicative group modulo 5. The function f(x) is x squared. The question is asking about the kernel of f, which is denoted K_f. I need to figure out what K_f is and match it to one of the given options.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what U_5 is. U_5 is the multiplicative group of integers modulo 5. So, its elements are {1, 2, 3, 4} since 5 is prime, and the units modulo 5 are those numbers less than 5 and coprime to 5. So U_5 = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The function f is a homomorphism from U_5 to U_5, defined by f(x) = x². I remember that the kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity element. In this case, the identity in U_5 is 1 because multiplying by 1 leaves any element unchanged. So, K_f is the set {x ∈ U_5 | f(x) = 1}.

Wait, so I need to find all x in U_5 such that x squared equals 1 modulo 5. Let's list them out. The elements of U_5 are 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's square each:

1² = 1 mod 5 → 1. So 1 is in K_f.
2² = 4 mod 5 → 4. 4 is not 1, so 2 is not in K_f.
3² = 9 mod 5 → 4. Again, 4 isn't 1, so 3 is not in K_f.
4² = 16 mod 5 → 16 divided by 5 is 3*5=15, so remainder 1. So 4²=1 mod 5. So 4 is in K_f.

So K_f = {1, 4}.

Wait, what's the notation again? The options are given as intervals, like [a,b]. So I need to see which interval [a,b] contains 1 and 4.

Looking at the options:

A: [1,2] → includes 1,2. So 1 and 4 are not both in [1,2].
B: [2,5] → includes 2,3,4,5. But K_f is {1,4}, so 2 is not in K_f.
C: [4,2] → same as [2,4], which includes 2,3,4. 1 isn't in this interval.
D: [5,2] → same as [2,5]. As before, 1 isn't included.
E: [3,5] → includes 3,4,5. 1 not included.
F: [0,1] → includes 0 and 1. So 1 is in, but 4 isn't.
G: [3,4] → includes 3 and 4. 1 not included.
H: [4,1] → same as [1,4], which includes 1, but 4 is also in. Wait, but 1 isn't in this interval. Wait, no, the interval [4,1] is actually the same as [1,4], because the lower bound is greater than the upper. So no, H includes 4 but not 1.
Wait, no. The notation [a,b] is usually ordered such that a ≤ b, I think. So [1,4] includes 1 and 4. So which option has [1,4]?

Looking back, the options don't directly have [1,4]. Wait, the options are labeled with [a,b], but I'm not sure if they are ordered. Let me check the options:

Options:
A: [1,2] → 1 and 2. Includes 1 but not 4.
B: [2,5] → 2,3,4,5. Includes 4 but not 1.
C: [4,2] → same as [2,4]. Includes 4 but not 1.
D: [5,2] → same as [2,5], includes 4 but not 1.
E: [3,5] → includes 4 but not 1.
F: [0,1] → includes 1, but not 4.
G: [3,4] → includes 4 but not 1.
H: [4,1] → same as [1,4]. Because [4,1] is the same as [1,4] if the order is reversed. Wait, but that notation might be incorrect. Typically, intervals are ordered with the lower bound first. So [4,1] would imply that a=4, b=1, which is invalid because a should be less than or equal to b. So perhaps that's a typo, or perhaps the option is written with a different meaning. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Wait, perhaps the notation [a,b] means the set {x | a ≤ x ≤ b}. So in that case, [1,4] would include all integers from 1 to 4, which is {1,2,3,4}.

Looking back at K_f = {1,4}, the only option that includes both 1 and 4 is [1,4]. But looking at the options, none of them seem to have [1,4] except maybe option H, which is written as [4,1], but perhaps that's a typo and should be [1,4].

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the set K_f.

Wait, another approach: since the group U_5 is cyclic of order 4 (since φ(5)=4), the elements are {1, 2, 3, 4}. The squares of these elements are:

1² = 1
2² = 4
3² = 9 mod5=4
4²=16 mod5=1.

So K_f consists of elements whose squares are 1. So 1 and 4. So K_f is {1,4}.

Looking at the options again, the intervals are [a,b], but perhaps I'm to choose the interval that contains both 1 and 4. The only such interval is [1,4], but none of the options are labeled [1,4]. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options:

A: [1,2] → includes 1,2. So 1 is in, but 4 not.
B: [2,5] → includes 4 but not 1.
C: [4,2] → same as [2,4], includes 4 but not 1.
D: [5,2] → same as [2,5], includes4 but not 1.
E: [3,5] → includes4 but not 1.
F: [0,1] → includes1, but not4.
G: [3,4] → includes4 but not1.
H: [4,1] → same as [1,4], which includes1 and4. So if H is [4,1], perhaps it's a typo, but assuming that [a,b] is a closed interval, [1,4] is the set. But none of the options match this. Let's see which options contain both 1 and4.

Wait, the options are:

A: [1,2] → 1 and 2. So includes1, but not4.
B: [2,5] → includes4, but not1.
C: [4,2] → same as [2,4], includes4, but not1.
D: [5,2] → same as [2,5], includes4, but not1.
E: [3,5] → includes4 but not1.
F: [0,1] → includes1, but not4.
G: [3,4] → includes4, but not1.
H: [4,1] → same as [1,4], includes1 and4. So if H is intended to represent [1,4], then it would be correct. But let me check if any other options include both.

Wait, the options are:

H is [4,1], which if interpreted as [1,4], would include both 1 and4. So perhaps the correct answer is option H. But wait, I thought the kernel is {1,4}, so in interval notation, perhaps it's best to choose the interval that includes both. Looking at the options again, only option H is [4,1], which, if it's a typo, could mean [1,4], which indeed includes both 1 and4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K_f. Let me double-check.

The elements of U_5 are 1,2,3,4.

Compute x² for each:

1² = 1 → in K_f
2² =4 → not 1
3²=9 mod5=4→ not1
4²=16 mod5=1→ yes.

So K_f is {1,4}.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any of them representing {1,4} as an interval. All options are either [a,b] or [b,a]. So perhaps the correct notation is [1,4], but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, another approach: the kernel of f is the set of elements x such that x²=1. So in U_5, which is cyclic of order4, the equation x²=1 has solutions. In a cyclic group of order n, the equation x^k =1 has solutions equal to the divisors of the order of the element. Alternatively, for U_5 which is cyclic of order4, the equation x²=1 would have solutions equal to the elements whose order divides 2, but in U_5, each element's order divides 4.

Wait, the order of 1 is 1, 2 is of order4 (since 2^4=16=1 mod5), 3 is of order4 (3^4=81=1 mod5), and 4 is of order2. So x²=1 is satisfied by the elements of order dividing2, which are 1 and4.

So K_f is {1,4}.

So what's the interval that contains both 1 and4? Looking at the options, the only option that represents [1,4] in interval notation is not present. So perhaps the correct notation is [1,4], but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, let's check the options again:

A: [1,2]
B: [2,5]
C: [4,2]
D: [5,2]
E: [3,5]
F: [0,1]
G: [3,4]
H: [4,1]
I: [1,5]
J: [2,3]

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the options' interval notation is written differently. Like, for example, option H is [4,1], which is the same as [1,4], but written in reverse. So if the notation is [a,b], and the interval is ordered, then [4,1] would be the same as [1,4] if we consider the minimum first. So perhaps option H is intended to represent [1,4], which includes both 1 and4.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is [1,4], but the options don't have that. Wait, looking again, perhaps I misread the options. Let me re-examine all the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the kernel. Let me double-check the function f(x) =x².

Wait, the calculations:

1² =1 → yes.
2²=4 → not 1.
3²=9 mod5=4 → no.
4²=16 mod5=1 → yes.

So K_f is {1,4}.

But none of the options list both 1 and4. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is the set of elements that are either 1 or 4. So I'm looking for an interval that includes both 1 and4. The only option that includes both is [1,4], but that's not present. Alternatively, perhaps the options are written in a way that the first element is the lower bound, and the second is the upper bound, but in their notation, it's [a, b] with a ≤ b.

Wait, let's re-examine the options:

A: [1,2] → 1 and 2. So 1 is in, 4 is not.
B: [2,5] → 2,3,4,5. Only 4 is in, 1 not.
C: [4,2] → same as [2,4]. 4 is in, 1 not.
D: [5,2] → same as [2,5]. 4 in, 1 not.
E: [3,5] → 3,4,5. 4 in, 1 not.
F: [0,1] → 1 in, 4 not.
G: [3,4] → 4 in, 1 not.
H: [4,1] → same as [1,4], so if this is intended as [1,4], then yes, it includes both 1 and4.

Wait, but the way the options are written, H is written as [4,1], which is the same as [1,4]. So the correct kernel would be represented by [1,4], but the only option that represents [1,4] is option H.

Wait, but why is option H written as [4,1]? Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the interval that contains both 1 and4, but the only option that includes both is none. Oh wait, because 1 and4 are the only elements in K_f. So the only interval that includes both would be [1,4], but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the kernel. Let me re-examine K_f.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x². Let me check:

1² =1 → correct.
2²=4 → correct.
3²=9 mod5=4 → correct.
4²=16 mod5=1 → correct.

So K_f={1,4}.

So, among the options, which one represents {1,4} as an interval? The only way is to have [1,4], but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is [1,5], but that's option I, which is [1,5], which includes more elements. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, am I missing something? The kernel is {1,4}, but perhaps the interval [1,4] is written as [4,1] in the options. So option H: [4,1] is the same as [1,4], so the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the group is cyclic of order4, so the kernel of the square function would be the elements of order dividing 2, which are 1 and4. So K_f is {1,4}.

So the correct option is H because it's the only one that includes both 1 and4, but perhaps it's written as [4,1].

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the options:

Looking at the options again:

H: [4,1]

So if I write [4,1], it's the same as [1,4] because a=4, b=1, but since a must be ≤ b, it's actually [1,4]. So the notation is a bit ambiguous here, but the correct interval is [1,4], which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is H, as it represents the set {1,4} in interval notation, assuming that the notation is incorrect and [4,1] is meant to represent [1,4].

Alternatively, maybe none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: in U_5, the element 4 is equal to -1 mod5. So 4²=16=1 mod5. So the kernel is {1, -1}.

Wait, in group theory, the kernel of the squaring map on a cyclic group of even order has size 2. So K_f has size 2, and the elements are 1 and -1. So K_f = {1,4}.

So looking at the options, none of the options list both 1 and4 in an interval. So perhaps the correct answer is option H, which is [4,1], assuming that notation allows for a reversed interval.

In that case, the correct option is H.

The function \( f: U_5 \to U_5 \) is defined by \( f(x) = x^2 \), where \( U_5 = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \) is the multiplicative group modulo 5. The kernel of \( f \), denoted \( K_f \), consists of all elements \( x \) in \( U_5 \) such that \( f(x) = 1 \). 

Calculating \( x^2 \) for each element in \( U_5 \):
- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \)
- \( 4^2 = 16 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)

Thus, \( K_f = \{1, 4\} \). Among the given options, the interval that includes both 1 and 4 is represented by \( [4, 1] \), which is option H.
