Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about calculating the pressure needed to keep a refrigerant liquid at a low temperature. Freon-14, CF4, boils at -127.8°C. Its heat of vaporization is 12.62 kJ/mol. We need to find the pressure when the temperature is -135°C.

Hmm, I remember that when a liquid cools, it releases heat. Since the heat of vaporization is the energy required to turn liquid into gas, in this case, when the temperature drops below the boiling point, the liquid will vaporize, absorbing heat. But wait, wait, let me think about the signs. The heat of vaporization is positive, meaning it's the energy needed to vaporize. So, when the temperature is lower than the boiling point, the liquid condenses, releasing that heat.

Wait, but let me get this straight. The problem says we have liquid Freon-14 at -135°C. We need to find the pressure at which this occurs. So, maybe we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for this? I think the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure and temperature to the heat of vaporization.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = ΔH_vap / (ΔV * T), where ΔH is the heat of vaporization, and ΔV is the change in volume when vaporizing. But I'm not sure if we can use this directly because we don't have information about the volume change. Alternatively, maybe we can assume that the volume change is negligible or treat it differently.

Wait, another approach: the ideal gas law. At the boiling point, the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. But in this case, the pressure would be lower than atmospheric because the temperature is below the boiling point. So, when the temperature is lower than the normal boiling point, the vapor pressure drops.

Wait, but the question is about the pressure inside the container when the temperature is -135°C. So, assuming that the container is rigid, the volume is fixed. As the temperature decreases, the gas (Freon) would condense, so the pressure would decrease.

Wait, but how does this relate to pressure? Well, let's model it. Let's say that the liquid Freon is at a pressure P, and at that temperature, the vapor pressure is P. But wait, the normal boiling point is -127.8°C, so at that temperature, the vapor pressure is 1 atm (assuming atmospheric pressure). So, if the temperature is lower than the normal boiling point, the pressure will be lower than 1 atm.

So, the situation is similar to the case where if you have a liquid at a lower temperature, the vapor pressure is lower. So, the pressure required at -135°C is lower than the normal boiling point pressure.

Wait, but what equation should I use to calculate the pressure? Let me think about the van der Waals equation or the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again. Alternatively, I can think about the ideal gas law modified for the phase change.

Wait, but perhaps an easier approach is to use the equation for the change in vapor pressure with temperature. The equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * [1/T1 - 1/T2] / (1 + ΔV/(V_m) * (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2))

Wait, but this involves the volume change. I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate the change using the ideal gas equation. But wait, the vapor pressure is given by the ideal gas law at the boiling point, so P = (V_m) RT / (n), but when vaporizing, the volume change is significant. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a two-point vapor pressure curve and use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the pressure at a lower temperature.

Wait, let's see. Maybe I should start by determining the vapor pressure at -135°C (which is lower than the boiling point). Let's convert the temperatures to Kelvin.

-127.8°C is 145.92 K (since 0°C is 273.15 K, so -127.8°C is 273.15 - 127.8 = 145.35 K approximately? Wait, wait, 127.8 + 273.15 = 400.95 K, so negative is 400.95 - 127.8 = 273.15-127.8 = 145.35 K.)

Wait, for the normal boiling point, T1 is 145.35 K, P1 is 1 atm. We need to find P2 at T2 = -135°C, which is 273.15 -135 = 138.15 K.

Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * [1/T1 - 1/T2] * [1 + ... ?]

Wait, but actually, the equation is:

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (R T^2 (1 - P/To)) ), or wait, perhaps I'm getting the exact form wrong.

Alternatively, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be written as:

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (R T^2 (V_m - V_liquid)) )

Hmm, perhaps that's getting complicated. But maybe for this problem, we can make an approximation, like assuming that the volume change is negligible or that the change in volume (ΔV) is small relative to the volume of the gas, so that the term (1 + ΔV/V_m) is approximately 1.

Wait, another approach is to use the formula for the change in vapor pressure when the temperature is lower than the normal boiling point. The formula is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1 - T2/T1)

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) * (1/(1 + (T2 - T1)/(T1)) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think in terms of T2 < T1. Let me express T2 as the temperature in Kelvin, and T1 as 145.35 K.

So, T1 = 145.35 K, T2 = 138.15 K.

ΔH_vap = 12.62 kJ/mol = 12620 J/mol.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So, let's compute [1/T1 - 1/T2].

1/145.35 ≈ 0.00689 K^-1.

1/138.15 ≈ 0.00724 K^-1.

Difference: 0.00724 - 0.00689 = 0.00035 K^-1.

So, (ΔH_vap/R) * [1/T1 - 1/T2] = (12620 / 8.314) * 0.00035.

Let me compute that:

12620 /8.314 ≈ approx 1518 (since 8 * 1500 = 12000). 8.314 * 1500 is 12471. So maybe 1518.

Then multiply by 0.00035: 1518 * 0.00035 = ~0.5313.

So, ln(P2/P1) = 0.5313 * (1/(1 + (T2-T1)/(T1)) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Another approach is to use the approximation ln(P2/P1) ≈ (ΔH_vap / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1 - (T2 - T1)/T1 )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct formula for the change in vapor pressure with temperature is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / (R)) [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) ] / (1 + (ΔV_m)/(V_m)) )

But without knowing ΔV_m, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the change in vapor pressure can be approximated by considering the ideal gas law at both temperatures.

Wait, when the temperature drops, the vapor pressure drops proportionally. So, perhaps using the ratio of the vapor pressures at two temperatures.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the ideal gas law for the vapor phase. At the boiling point, P1 V_m = RT1.

At a lower temperature T2, the same volume V would have a pressure P2 V_m = RT2.

But in this problem, the container is rigid, so V is fixed. So, V_m is the molar volume, which is the same as (RT/P) for the vapor phase.

Wait, but at the normal boiling point, P1 = 1 atm, so V_m = RT1 / P1 = RT1.

At temperature T2, P2 = (R T2 V_m) / (n) = (R T2 (RT1/P1)) ) / n. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, since the volume is fixed, for the vapor, the pressure would be P = (R T2) / (V_m). But at the normal boiling point, P = 1 atm = R T1 / V_m. So, V_m = R T1 / P1.

Substituting into the equation for P2: P2 = R T2 * V_m / n = R T2 (R T1 / P1) ) / n. But wait, n is the number of moles, and in the ideal gas equation, PV = nRT. So, for the vapor, the pressure would be P2 = (R T2) / (V_m), where V_m is the molar volume.

But V_m at the normal boiling point is V_m = R T1 / P1.

So, substituting, P2 = (R T2) / ( R T1 / P1 ) ) = (T2 / T1) * P1.

Wait, that gives P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1. But wait, this would be only valid if the pressure and volume change in such a way that the ratio remains the same.

Wait a second, let me test this. At T1, P1 = (R T1) / V_m. At T2, P2 = (R T2) / V_m.

But since V_m is fixed, P2 = (R T2 / V_m) = (T2 / T1) * (R T1 / V_m) ) = (T2 / T1) * P1.

So yes, P2 = (T2 / T1) P1.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic. Let me see if that makes sense. For example, at T1 = 300 K, P1 = 1 atm. If T2 is 273 K, then P2 would be (273/300)*1 ≈ 0.91 atm. But wait, for a liquid, when the temperature drops below the boiling point, the pressure would drop, but the vapor pressure would drop more steeply. So this approximation might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ideal gas law for the vapor, but considering that the pressure inside the container is determined by the vapor pressure at that temperature.

Wait, another approach: Use the ideal gas law for the vapor. 

At temperature T2, the vapor pressure is P2. The volume, V, is fixed. The number of moles, n, is constant. So, P2 V = n R T2.

At the normal boiling point (T1), 1 atm * V = n R T1.

So, dividing the two equations: P2 V / (n R T2) ) = (n R T1) / (n R T2) * V) / (n R T2) ) → P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

Wait, that gives P2 = T2 / T1 * P1.

Wait, but that can't be right if the temperature is lower than the normal boiling point. Because in reality, the vapor pressure would be lower than 1 atm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me rederive it.

At T1, the vapor pressure is P1 = 1 atm.

At T2, the vapor pressure is P2.

The molar volume (V_m) for the vapor is V_m = R T1 / P1.

At T2, the molar volume is V_m = R T2 / P2.

But since V_m is the same for both, setting them equal:

R T1 / P1 = R T2 / P2 → P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

So, P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

But wait, that can't be right, because if T2 is lower than T1, P2 would be lower than P1. So, in this case, T2 is lower than T1, so P2 is lower than 1 atm.

So, the pressure in the container would be (T2 / T1) * P1.

Wait, but wait, isn't the pressure inside the container the vapor pressure? Because the liquid is freezing into vapor, so the pressure is due to the vapor.

So, according to this, P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

Using the numbers:

T1 = 145.35 K (normal boiling point), P1 = 1 atm.

T2 = 138.15 K.

So, P2 = (138.15 / 145.35) * 1 atm.

Calculating that: 138.15 / 145.35 ≈ 0.9537.

So, P2 ≈ 0.9537 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:0.30 atm, which is way lower. Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply that the pressure inside the container is lower than atmospheric, which is about 1 atm. But at -135°C, the vapor pressure should be much lower than atmospheric.

Hmm, this suggests that my approach might be incorrect. Because the approximation probably ignores the change in volume of the gas. So, perhaps the actual vapor pressure at T2 is lower than predicted by this simple ratio.

Wait, maybe I should use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Let's try that.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

dP/dT = ΔH_vap / (R T^2 (1 - (T2 - T1)/T1) ) )

Wait, or perhaps a more precise form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) [ (1 / T1) - (1 / T2) ] * (1 + (V_m - V_liquid) / V_m )

But without knowing V_m and V_liquid, this is hard to use.

Wait, but perhaps as an approximation, we can neglect the volume change, so V_m is approximately constant. Then, the equation becomes:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Let me compute this.

ΔH_vap = 12.62 kJ/mol = 12620 J/mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T1 = 145.35 K.

T2 = 138.15 K.

Compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/145.35 - 1/138.15) = (approx 0.00689 - 0.00724) = -0.00035 K^-1.

So, (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 12620 / 8.314 * (-0.00035).

Compute 12620/8.314 ≈ 12620 /8.314 ≈ 1518.5.

1518.5 * (-0.00035) = approx -0.5315.

So, ln(P2/P1) = -0.5315.

P2/P1 = e^(-0.5315) ≈ e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, but let's compute more accurately.

e^-0.5315 → Let's compute 0.5315.

The natural logarithm of 0.588 is approx. Let me think: ln(0.6) ≈ -0.5108, ln(0.588) ≈ ?

Wait, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108.

0.5315 is a bit higher, so the value is higher (because the exponent is higher, and the function is increasing).

Wait, perhaps 0.588 is e^{-0.531}?

Wait, let me compute e^(-0.5315):

0.5315 → ln(0.588) → Let me compute ln(0.588):

ln(0.5) is about -0.6931.

ln(0.58) ≈?

Using the Taylor expansion around x=0.5.

Let me think, x=0.58, x-0.5=0.08.

f(x) = ln(x) ≈ f(a) + (x-a) f'(a) + ... 

a=0.5.

f(a)= -0.6931.

f'(a)=1/0.5=2.

f''(a)= -1/(0.5)^2 = -4.

So, f(0.58) ≈ f(0.5) + (0.08)(2) - (0.08)^2 *4 / 2?

Wait, maybe it's better to compute using more precise methods.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation:

f(x) ≈ f(a) + (x-a) f'(a) + (x-a)^2 f''(a)/2.

So, f(0.58) ≈ -0.6931 + (0.08)(2) + (0.08)^2*(-4)/2.

Calculating each term:

0.08 *2 = 0.16.

(0.08)^2 * (-4) = 0.0064 * (-4) = -0.0256.

Divide by 2: -0.0128.

So, f(0.58) ≈ -0.6931 + 0.16 -0.0128 = (-0.6931 + 0.16) = -0.5331; -0.5331 -0.0128 = -0.5459.

So, ln(0.58) ≈ -0.5459.

But our exponent is -0.5315, which is higher than -0.5459.

Wait, that can't be right because higher exponents (less negative) would correspond to higher values (since exp is increasing).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recompute f(x) at x=0.58.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to use a calculator to compute e^(-0.5315). Let me think:

e^(-0.5315) = ?

Using a calculator function, I find that e^-0.5315 ≈ 0.587.

So, P2/P1 = 0.587.

So, P2 = 0.587 * P1 = 0.587 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.58 atm. But wait, the options are:

Looking back, the options are:

A) 0.03 atm

B) 0.20 atm

C) 0.25 atm

D) 0.30 atm

E) 0.35 atm

F) 0.50 atm

G) 0.58 atm

H) 0.65 atm

I think I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, considering the volume change.

The correct form is:

dP/dT = (ΔH_vap / R) [1/T1 - 1/T2] / (1 + (V_m - V_liquid)/V_m )

But without knowing V_m and V_liquid, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate the change in molar volume.

Wait, perhaps in the ideal case, the molar volume of the vapor is V_m = R T / P. At the normal boiling point (T1), P1 = 1 atm, so V_m = R T1.

At a lower temperature T2, the same volume is occupied by the vapor, so V_m = R T2 / P2.

But since the container is rigid, V_m is the same as before. So, R T2 / P2 = R T1 / P1 → which leads back to P2 = (T2 / T1) P1 → which is the same as before. But that gives P2 = 0.9537 atm, which is about 0.95 atm, but our calculation from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation suggested around 0.58 atm.

Wait, that's a problem. Because using the simple ratio (T2/T1)*P1 gives 0.95 atm, but the Clausius-Clapeyron equation suggests a lower pressure of about 0.58 atm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the earlier steps. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider that the air inside the container is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. But wait, no, the container is rigid and the Freon is freezing into vapor, so the pressure is due to the vapor.

Wait, another approach: The vapor pressure can be calculated using the ideal gas law for the vapor phase. Since the container is rigid, the volume of the vapor phase is fixed. So, for the vapor, the pressure would be proportional to the number of moles, which is the same as the number of moles of liquid Freon.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to go back to the original problem and see if any other approach can help.

Wait, perhaps I should use the concept that the vapor pressure is inversely proportional to the temperature. But that's not exactly correct because the actual relation is P = (R T) / V, where V is the molar volume. But without knowing V, this approach is not valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law for the vapor phase, considering that the volume is fixed. So, for the vapor, PV = nRT. But we can relate the vapor pressure P to the temperature T.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to see if the options can help.

The options given are:

A) 0.03

B) 0.20

C) 0.25

D) 0.30

E) 0.35

F) 0.50

G) 0.58

H) 0.65

So, from my earlier calculation using the simple ratio, I get about 0.95 atm. But that's not an option. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation with the assumption that the volume change is small. But I don't have enough information.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the vapor pressure at -135°C would be much lower. Let's compute using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

Let me compute ln(P2/1 atm) = (12620 / 8.314) * [ (1/145.35) - (1/138.15) ].

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Compute (1/145.35) = 0.00689 K^-1.

Compute (1/138.15) = 0.00724 K^-1.

Difference = 0.00724 - 0.00689 = 0.00035 K^-1.

So, (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (12620 /8.314) * 0.00035.

Compute 12620 /8.314:

12620 ÷8.314 ≈ 1518.5.

Multiply by 0.00035: 1518.5 * 0.00035 = 0.531475.

So, ln(P2/1 atm) = 0.531475.

So, P2 = e^0.531475 * 1 atm.

e^0.531475 ≈ e^(0.5) * e^(0.031475) ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0319 ≈ 1.6487 + 0.0513 ≈ 1.700.

So, P2 ≈ 1.7 atm. But this is even higher than the initial estimate, which suggests that the vapor pressure is much higher than I calculated.

Wait, but that can't be right because the normal boiling point is 1 atm, so at lower temperatures, the vapor pressure should be lower. So, this approach is conflicting with the physical reality.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the approximation in the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is invalid because the volume change is significant. Therefore, using the simple ratio approach is more appropriate.

But according to that approach, P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1 = (138.15 /145.35) * 1 atm ≈ 0.9537 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:0.50 atm, which is way lower than 0.95 atm. So, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the pressure inside the container is not due to the vapor, but instead, the vapor pressure is the absolute pressure. So, in that case, the pressure would be higher than 0.95 atm, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate P2 using the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use the ideal gas law for the vapor, considering that the pressure is due to the vapor. So, for the vapor, P = (R T) / V.

But the volume V is fixed. So, for the vapor, the pressure would scale with the temperature.

But without knowing the volume, perhaps we can relate it to the normal boiling point.

At the normal boiling point (T1), P1 = 1 atm.

At temperature T2, P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

But as we saw, that gives P2 = 0.95 atm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem lies in the assumption that the vapor pressure is inversely proportional to temperature. But that's not correct. Instead, the vapor pressure increases with temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that the vapor pressure at the normal boiling point is 1 atm. So, at lower temperatures, the vapor pressure should be lower than 1 atm. So, according to the calculation, it would be around 0.95 atm, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approach where the vapor pressure is calculated using the ideal gas law, but without considering the volume change of the gas.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ideal gas equation for the vapor.

At the normal boiling point, P1 = 1 atm.

At a lower temperature T2, the vapor pressure is P2.

The number of moles is the same, so using the ideal gas law for the vapor:

P2 V = n R T2.

At the normal boiling point, 1 atm * V = n R T1.

So, substituting into the vapor equation:

P2 = (n R T2) / (V n) ) = (R T2) / V.

But from the normal boiling point, V = R T1 / P1.

Substituting back:

P2 = (R T2) / (R T1 / P1) ) = (T2 P1) / T1.

So, P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

Which brings us back to the same result.

So, P2 = (138.15 /145.35) *1 atm ≈0.9537 atm.

Hmm, but the options do not have that value. The closest option is F:0.50 atm, but that can't be right because our calculation suggests that it's about 0.95 atm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of T2. Let me recalculate T2.

Earlier, I converted -135°C to Kelvin:

-135°C = 273.15 + (-135) = 138.15 K.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The correct formula is:

K = °C + 273.15.

So, -135°C = (-135) + 273.15 = 138.15 K.

So, T2 is 138.15 K.

So, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the van der Waals equation. But without knowing the parameters, that's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the ideal gas law for the vapor, but in reality, the vapor pressure is much lower. But according to the calculation, it's about 0.95 atm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation without considering the volume change. Let me compute that.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

dP/dT = ΔH_vap / (R T^2 (1 + (V_m - V_liquid)/V_m )) )

But without knowing V_m and V_liquid, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be approximated by neglecting the volume change, so:

dP/dT ≈ ΔH_vap / (R T^2 )

Then, integrate both sides.

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Which is exactly the same equation I used earlier, leading to P2 ≈0.9537 atm.

But that's not an option. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the vapor pressure is inversely proportional to temperature, leading to:

P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

But that would give P2 = 0.9537 atm, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the van der Waals equation, but that's beyond my current understanding. I think I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should see that the correct answer is option F:0.50 atm, but that's not correct according to my calculations. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have an answer different from my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the vapor pressure is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature. So, P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

Which would give P2 = (138.15 /145.35) *1 atm ≈0.9537 atm.

But if I were to use this approach, the answer would be option F:0.50 atm, which is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the vapor pressure is inversely proportional to the normal boiling point.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the correct approach is to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, leading to P2 ≈0.9537 atm. But since this is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the vapor pressure is proportional to the temperature, leading to:

P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1.

Which is 0.9537 atm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option F:0.50 atm, but that can't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute T2 in Kelvin correctly.

Wait, no, -135°C is 138.15 K, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the vapor pressure at -135°C be 0.50 atm, but that's not correct according to my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the vapor pressure using the van der Waals equation, but without knowing the parameters, it's impossible. So, I think this approach is not feasible.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option F:0.50 atm, but according to my calculation, it should be approximately 0.95 atm. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the vapor pressure is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature, leading to P2 = (T2 / T1) * P1 = 0.9537 atm.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option F:0.50 atm, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G:0.58 atm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values.

Compute (1/145.35) = 1/145.35 ≈ 0.00689 K^-1.

Compute (1/138.15) = 1/138.15 ≈ 0.00724 K^-1.

Difference = 0.00724 - 0.00689 = 0.00035 K^-1.

So, (ΔH_vap/R) * (difference) = (12620 /8.314) * 0.00035.

Compute 12620 /8.314 = approximately 1518.5.

Multiply by 0.00035: 1518.5 * 0.00035 = 0.531475.

So, ln(P2) = 0.531475.

So, P2 = e^0.531475 ≈ 1.700 atm.

Wait, that can't be correct because the vapor pressure can't be higher than 1 atm at the normal boiling point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the value.

Wait, (ΔH_vap/R) * (difference) = (12620 /8.314) * 0.00035.

Compute 12620 /8.314:

Divide 12620 by 8.314.

Let me compute 8.314 * 1518 = approx 12620.

8.314 * 1518 = 8.314 * 1500 + 8.314 *18 = 12471 + 149.652 = 12620.652.

So, 8.314 *1518 ≈12620.652.

So, 12620 /8.314 ≈1518.

So, (ΔH_vap/R) * (difference) = 1518 * 0.00035 ≈0.5313.

So, ln(P2) =0.5313 → P2= e^0.5313 ≈ 1.700 atm.

But that's impossible because the vapor pressure at the normal boiling point is 1 atm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the difference.

Wait, (1/145.35) - (1/138.15) = 0.00689 -0.00724 = -0.00035 K^-1.

Wait, no, 0.00689 -0.00724 is negative, which would make the difference negative.

So, (ΔH_vap/R) * (difference) = (12620 /8.314) * (-0.00035) → negative value.

So, ln(P2) = negative value.

So, P2 = e^-0.5313 → approx 0.587 atm.

Ah, so the correct result is approximately 0.587 atm, which would correspond to option G:0.58 atm.

Wait, but how did I get that? Because (1/145.35) is 0.00689, (1/138.15) is 0.00724, so their difference is negative.

So, (ΔH_vap/R) * (difference) = (12620 /8.314) * (-0.00035) ≈ -0.5313.

So, ln(P2) = -0.5313 → P2 = e^-0.5313 ≈0.587 atm.

So, the correct answer is option G:0.58 atm.

Ah, I see now. Earlier, I thought that the difference was positive, which would have made the calculation positive, but in reality, it's negative. So, the correct answer is option G.

To determine the vapor pressure inside the refrigerant container at -135°C, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure to temperature. The equation is:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert Temperatures to Kelvin
- Normal boiling point: \( T_1 = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)
- -135°C: \( T_2 = -135 + 273.15 = 138.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Calculate Reciprocals
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{373.15} \approx 0.00268 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{138.15} \approx 0.00724 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute Temperature Difference
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.00268 - 0.00724 = -0.00456 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Apply Clausius-Clapeyron Equation
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R} \cdot \left(-0.00456\right)
\]
- Given: \( \Delta H_{vap} = 12620 \, \text{J/mol} \), \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)
\[
\frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R} = \frac{12620}{8.314} \approx 1518 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = 1518 \cdot (-0.00456) \approx -0.689
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( P_2 \)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{1 \, \text{atm}}\right) = -0.689
\]
\[
\frac{P_2}{1 \, \text{atm}} = e^{-0.689} \approx 0.500
\]
\[
P_2 = 0.500 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The vapor pressure inside the refrigerant container at -135°C is **0.500 atm**, which corresponds to **option G: 0.58 atm**. However, based on the calculation, the correct answer should be **0.500 atm**. It appears there might be a discrepancy between the calculated result and the provided option.
