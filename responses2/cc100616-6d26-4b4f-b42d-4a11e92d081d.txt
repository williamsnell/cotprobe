Options:

A: $210
B: $180
C: $200
D: $220
E: $205
F: $230
G: $215
H: $190
I: $195

Alright, so I've got this problem here about optimizing revenue for Grey's Truck Rental Service. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, okay, the question says that currently, they charge $180 per week for a truck rental, and they rent out an average of 200 trucks a week. If they raise the price by $1, the demand drops by 1 truck a week. The goal is to find the price that will maximize revenues.

Wait, so I'm thinking of this as a problem where revenue is being affected by price changes, and we need to find the optimal price. Revenue is price multiplied by quantity. So, revenue (R) = P * Q. But in this case, Q is dependent on P. So when the price increases, Q decreases, so I need to find the point where the product of P and Q is maximized.

Let me set up the variables. Let's denote the price as P. Currently, P is $180, and Q is 200. For each $1 increase in P, Q decreases by 1. So, if the price goes up by x dollars, the new price P_new = 180 + x. The quantity Q_new would then be 200 - x, since each $1 increase leads to a 1 truck less rented each week.

So revenue R = P_new * Q_new = (180 + x) * (200 - x). I need to find the value of x that maximizes R.

Expanding this equation: R = (180)(200) + (180)(-x) + x*(200) + x*(-x). That simplifies to R = 36000 - 180x + 200x - x². Combining like terms: R = 36000 + 20x - x².

Wait, so R is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and it opens downward (since the coefficient of x² is negative). The maximum revenue occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex formula is at x = -b/(2a) for a quadratic ax² + bx + c. Here, a = -1, b = 20. So x = -20/(2*(-1)) = -20/-2 = 10.

So x is 10. That means the optimal price is 180 + 10 = $190. Let me check the answer options. Option H is $190. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here.

Alternative approach: Maybe use calculus. Take the derivative of R with respect to x and set it to zero. R = (180 + x)(200 -x) = 180*200 -180x +200x -x² = 36000 +20x -x². dR/dx = 20 - 2x. Setting derivative to zero: 20 - 2x=0 → 2x=20 → x=10. So yes, x=10, price is 190. That's option H.

Wait, but let me double-check the demand. If price increases by x, then Q decreases by x. So x=10 would mean P=190, Q=190. Let me compute R: 190 * 190 = 36,100. Wait, but let's see if at x=10, revenue is indeed maximum. Let's check x=9: P=189, Q=200-9=191. R=189*191. Let me compute 189*200=37,800 minus 189: 37,800-189=37,611. So R is 37,611, which is higher than 36,100. So x=10 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, but option H is $190. But wait, looking back, the options are H: $190, and the other options. So the answer should be H: $190, but wait, the options were A to J, and H is $190, which would be the correct answer. But wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the initial calculation shows that when x=10, the price is 190, and revenue is 36,100. But let me check if at x=11, price is $191, quantity is 189. R=191 * 189. 191*189: 190*189=35,910; plus 1*189=189; total 36,099. So R is 36,099, which is slightly less than 36,100. So x=10 gives the maximum. Thus, the optimal price is $190. So the correct answer is option H.

The problem involves maximizing revenue for Grey's Truck Rental Service, where the demand decreases by one truck for each $1 increase in the rental price. Let's break this down:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Current price (P): $180
   - Current quantity (Q): 200 trucks
   - Price increase (x): $1 per week

2. **Expressing Price and Quantity in Terms of x:**
   - New price: \( P_{\text{new}} = 180 + x \)
   - New quantity: \( Q_{\text{new}} = 200 - x \)

3. **Revenue Function:**
   - Revenue \( R = P_{\text{new}} \times Q_{\text{new}} = (180 + x)(200 - x) \)
   - Expand: \( R = 36,000 + 20x - x^2 \)

4. **Finding the Optimal x:**
   - The revenue function is a quadratic equation opening downward (a = -1).
   - The vertex (maximum point) occurs at \( x = -b/(2a) = -20/(2*(-1)) = 10 \).

5. **Optimal Price:**
   - \( P = 180 + 10 = $190 \)
   - Option H is $190.

6. **Verification:**
   - Check nearby values to confirm maximum:
     - At x=9: \( R = 189 \times 191 = 37,611 \) (higher than $190 revenue)
     - At x=10: \( R = 190 \times 190 = 36,100 \)
     - At x=11: \( R = 191 \times 189 = 36,099 \) (slightly lower than $190 revenue)

Thus, the optimal price to maximize revenue is $190.

Answer: H
