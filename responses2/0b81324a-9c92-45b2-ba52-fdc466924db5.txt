Okay, so I've got this question here about the shape of Bob's Burger Barn's sign, which is a regular octagon. The question is asking how many degrees are in the measure of an interior angle. Hmm, I remember polygons have some formulas related to their angles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

First, a regular octagon has all sides equal and all interior angles equal. I think the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. So for an octagon, n is 8. Let me calculate that: (8-2)*180 = 6*180 = 1080 degrees. That's the total sum of all interior angles.

Since it's a regular octagon, each interior angle is equal, so I divide the total sum by the number of angles. So 1080 divided by 8. Let's see, 8 times 135 is 1080. Oh wait, 135 times 8: 100*8 is 800, 35*8 is 280, so 800+280=1080. Yep, that checks out. So each interior angle is 135 degrees. 

Looking at the options, D is 135. So the answer should be D. But wait, I should make sure I didn't mix up the formula. I remember that for polygons, the sum formula is (n-2)*180, and each angle in a regular polygon is sum divided by n. So yeah, 1080/8 is definitely 135. I'm pretty confident now.

The shape is a regular octagon, so each interior angle is calculated as:

Each interior angle = [(n - 2) × 180°] / n  
= (6 × 180°) / 8  
= 1080° / 8  
= 135°  

So the answer is 135°, which is option D.

Answer: D
