Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the eyes and photoreceptors. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking which type of cells in the eye respond to low levels of illumination. The options are A through J, each with different names and functions.

I remember that the eye has two main parts: the retina and the optical nerve. The retina is the light-sensitive part, but it's connected to the optic nerve. The optic nerve leads to the photoreceptor cells, which are the cone cells. Wait, cone cells are the ones that respond to low light, right? Like how we see colors because of the different cone cells in each eye.

So the question is about cells that respond to low illumination. Those are called rods because they're sensitive to low light. Rods are in the cone cells that make up the retina. But wait, sometimes the term ' rods' is used for cone cells. Or maybe the cone cells are referred to as photoreceptor cells, but that's broader. Oh, the question is about the cells that respond to low levels, so those are the rods, which are also called cone cells. 

Looking at the options, option H is Rods and option G is Cones. But wait, sometimes in the context of the eye, the cones are referred to as photoreceptor cells. So which one is correct here? The question says "cells that respond to low levels" which are the rods or cones. But the options are labeled as G (Cones) and H (Rods). So which is the correct choice?

Wait, another point: sometimes rods are called cone cells. So I might have it backwards. Let me think. In the retina, each eye has 16 cone cells arranged in a circle. These are sensitive to light from a certain part of the spectrum, so they respond to low light. These are called cone cells or photoreceptor cells. So the cells that respond to low illumination are the cone cells, which are also called rods. But maybe the question is more about the correct term. 

Wait, another angle: the term ' rods' is sometimes used for the cone cells, while 'photoreceptor' is a broader term that includes all cone cells, including rods and cones. But in this context, for the specific function of responding to low light, the term ' rods' is more precise. So looking back at the options, option H is 'Rods' and option G is 'Cones'. So which is correct? I think the answer is G, Cones, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the term ' rods' is used for cone cells. 

Wait, I'll try to recall: in the eye, the cone cells are the ones that are rods, and they are arranged in the retina. The rods are also called photoreceptor cells because they're photoreceptors. So the question is about the cells that respond to low light, which are the rods. But since the options are G (Cones) and H (Rods), the correct answer should be H, because ' rods' is a term used for them. Alternatively, maybe the answer is G, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the options include 'Cones' as G and 'Rods' as H. The question is about cells that respond to low illumination. Cone cells are rods, so they are responsible for low light. Therefore, the correct answer is probably G, Cones, but I'm not 100% certain because sometimes ' rods' is used for the same. Alternatively, maybe the term ' rods' refers to the same as ' cones' in this question's context.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the cone cells as the rods. No, that doesn't make sense. So maybe the correct answer is H, Rods, but I'm a bit confused. Another way: the term ' rods' is a specific term for the cone cells, so the correct answer would be G (Cones) if they're called rods, but that's not correct because the rods are the ones responding. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps looking at the function: rods are sensitive to low light (like the colors we see), so the cells that respond to low illumination are called rods. So the correct answer would be H (Rods). But wait, another thought: sometimes, the term ' rods' is used for the cone cells. So perhaps the correct answer is G. I'm a bit stuck here, but I think the answer is G. Or maybe it's H. Alternatively, maybe the answer is G because cones are photoreceptor cells, and rods are photoreceptor cells too.

Wait, another angle: the term ' rods' is sometimes used for cone cells. So in this case, the answer would be G. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the term ' rods' is used for the cone cells. So perhaps the correct answer is G, Cones.

Wait, I've seen in some textbooks that the term ' rods' refers to the cone cells. So the answer would be H, Rods. Or maybe the answer is G, because the cones are photoreceptor cells. So perhaps the correct answer is G, Cones. 

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact terminology. Oh, but I can't do that. So, based on my knowledge, the cone cells are arranged in the retina and respond to low light. They are called photoreceptor cells, but sometimes referred to as rods. So the term for them is either " rods" or "cones." So the question is, which option is correct: H or G.

Wait, another thought: in the context of the question, the cells that respond to low illumination are called the rods. So the answer is H. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the rods are called photoreceptor cells. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cone cells are called rods, and they are photoreceptor cells. So the cells that respond to low light are called rods, which is option H. So the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the term ' rods' is used for them, and that's why the correct answer is H. But I'm more confident that the correct term is ' rods' for the cone cells, so the answer is H.

Wait, no, another thought. The term ' rods' is sometimes used for the cone cells, and 'photoreceptor' is a broader term that includes both rods and cones. But the question is about cells that respond to low light, which are the rods. So the correct answer is H, Rods.

The question asks which type of cells in the eye responds to low levels of illumination. The correct answer depends on the terminology used. Cone cells, also known as photoreceptor cells, are responsible for responding to low light. They are arranged in the retina and are sensitive to the light spectrum that the human eye perceives as the color spectrum. The term " rods" is sometimes used interchangeably with "cones" to describe these cells, as they are particularly sensitive to low-light conditions. Therefore, the cells that respond to low illumination are called rods, which is option H.

Answer: H
