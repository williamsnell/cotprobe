Okay, so I've got this question about brain scans and how they can help disprove a statement. The statement is that "most people only use 10 percent of their brains." Hmm. I need to figure out which scan would be useful to show that this isn't true. Let me think through each option.

First, I remember that brain scans are used to visualize the brain's structure and function. So, which scans are used for that? I think fMRI (functional MRI) is one. It shows which areas of the brain are active during different tasks. So if a lot of people are using a certain area, fMRI would show that. But the question is about disproving that only 10% use it. So maybe an fMRI scan would show how much of the brain is active in that region, which might not fit the statement. Wait, but the statement is that most people use only 10% of their brains. So if fMRI shows that a significant portion uses more than that, maybe it could disprove it. Alternatively, maybe another scan would show a larger portion.

X-ray is a medical scan, so not sure about it. CAT and X-ray are used for internal structures, so maybe not relevant here. EEG is the electroencephalogram, which measures brain activity in real-time. So if you record a lot of activity, that would show more use of certain areas. PET, or Positron Emission Tomography, is used for looking at blood flow, so if it's high in a brain area, that suggests a lot of activity. MRI is magnetic resonance imaging, which shows tissue structures. So if a large brain area is affected, that could indicate more activity. DTI is diffusion tensor imaging, which looks at white matter tracts and might be useful for seeing connections between different areas.

SPECT is Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography, used for cancer detection. So it's about tissue density, which might not be directly related to brain activity. Ultrasound is imaging, but it might not show brain activity.

Wait, the question is about brain scans that disprove the idea that only 10% use most of the brain. So if I want to show that a larger portion uses a certain area, which would contradict the statement, which says that most people only use 10% of their brains. Hmm, but "most people only use 10%" – if the statement is that the majority use a small portion, then a scan showing larger brain activity would disprove it. Alternatively, if the statement is that a small percentage uses most of the brain, then a scan that shows a large portion using a specific area would support that. Wait, no. The statement is phrased as "most people only use 10 percent of their brains." So that suggests that the majority do not use much of the brain, but maybe a small percentage uses a large portion. Wait, actually, that phrasing is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that most people don't use most of the brain, but a small percentage does use a large portion. Or it could mean that most people only use a small part of the brain, implying that the rest are unused, which seems more plausible.

Wait, maybe I should think about each scan's purpose. For example, fMRI would show which parts of the brain are active. If we see that a certain area is active by a significant portion, that could suggest that people use a larger portion of the brain, which might support the statement. Alternatively, if the statement is that only 10% use most of their brains, that would mean that 90% use less. So if a scan shows that many people use a larger portion, that would contradict the statement. Or perhaps the opposite – wait, maybe the statement is that most of the population doesn't use most of the brain, so fMRI could show that some regions are used a lot, which would contradict the statement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me rephrase. The statement is: "Most people only use 10 percent of their brains." So, most of the people don't use much of their brain, but a small percentage does. So, to disprove that, we'd need a scan that shows that a significant portion of the population uses a larger portion of their brains. So that would mean that the statement is incorrect because a lot of people do use a significant part of their brains.

Wait, but that's the opposite. The statement is that most people use only 10 percent. So if a scan shows that a lot of people use a larger area, that would contradict the statement. So, which scan would show that.

EEG (Option C) shows real-time activity. If that's high in a brain area, it implies that that area is used a lot. So if the area is active most of the time, that would mean that a lot of people are using it, which would contradict the statement. So in that case, a scan that shows a large brain area being active would be useful to disprove the statement.

Wait, but sometimes people might use only a small portion of their brain, especially if they're very selective. So perhaps the statement is implying that most people don't use most of their brains, but perhaps use a small part. So if a scan shows that a large brain area is active by a significant number of people, it would show that people are using a larger portion of their brains, which would disprove the statement.

So among the options, which scan is best for showing that many people are using a larger portion? MRI (Option I) is a type of fMRI, perhaps. Wait, no, MRI and fMRI are different. MRI gives a static image of the brain's structure, whereas fMRI shows dynamic changes and connectivity. So maybe MRI would show if a specific brain region is used by a large percentage of people.

Alternatively, fMRI (Option J) would show which areas are active, so if a particular area is active by a large number of people, it would show that they're using it more than 10%.

Wait, but the question is about brain scans that would disprove the statement. The statement is that most people only use 10% of their brains. So if most people don't use a lot, but some do use a larger portion (like 50%), that would contradict the statement. So, which scan would show that.

Looking back at the options, all the brain scans except the statement's context might show different things. For example, if a scan shows that a large portion of people are using a specific brain area, that would support the statement. But wait, the statement is that most people don't use most of the brain. So, a scan showing a brain area used by a significant number of people would support the statement, or the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about which scan would be most useful in disproving the statement. So the statement is: most people only use 10% of their brains. So the opposite would be: most people use a larger portion, perhaps more than 10% of their brains. So, a scan that shows that a large percentage of people use a significant portion of their brains would disprove the statement.

So which scan is best for showing that? Let's think about what each scan shows.

- CAT and X-ray are imaging techniques, not brain scans. So probably not relevant.

- EEG (Option C) shows real-time brain activity, so if it's high in a brain area, it means that people are using it a lot.

- PET (Option D) is used to measure blood flow, which can indicate brain activity.

- MRI (Option I) is similar to fMRI, showing tissue structure, but not real-time.

- SPECT (Option F) is for cancer imaging and tissue density.

- Ultrasound (Option E) is imaging, not brain activity.

- DTI (Option H) is diffusion imaging, which looks at white matter and might show connections.

- SPECT (Option F) is for cancer.

Wait, so which of these would indicate that a large portion of people use a significant portion of their brains.

EEG: If you record a lot of activity in a specific brain area, it might suggest that a significant number of people use that area a lot. For example, if a lot of people are using the visual cortex a lot, that would show that.

MRI (Option I) can't show real-time activity, but maybe if a large portion of the brain is active, that could be shown. But MRI would show static data, so it's not real-time like EEG or fMRI.

Wait, but the question is about which scan would be most useful in disproving the statement. So, the scan needs to show that a large portion of people are using a significant portion of their brains.

So, which scan would show that? Let's think about the options again.

Option J is fMRI. It shows brain activity over time. So if a lot of people are using a particular brain area, say the visual area, then fMRI could show that a large number of people are using that area a lot, which would support the statement that most people use a larger portion. But that would support the statement, not disprove it. So that wouldn't help in disproving.

Wait, maybe the statement is that most people only use 10% of their brains, meaning that most people don't use much. So, if the scan shows that a lot of people are using a large portion, that would contradict the statement.

So which scan would show that. Let's think about MRI (Option I). MRI gives a static image, but if it's an MRI that shows brain structure, perhaps if a large area is used by a significant number of people, it would be an indication. But how would that relate to the statement?

Alternatively, if the scan shows that a specific brain area is used by a large percentage of people, it would show that people are using a significant portion, which could contradict the statement.

Wait, but the statement is that most people don't use most of the brain. So if a scan shows that a lot of people are using a large portion (like 50%), that would support the statement, not disprove it.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach it differently. The statement is that most people only use 10% of their brains. So, if I want to disprove that, I need evidence that more than 10% of the population uses a large portion of their brains.

So which scan would show that? Let's think about fMRI (Option J). If fMRI shows that a large brain area is active by a significant number of people, it would indicate that people are using that area a lot. But if the area is 10% of the brain, then that would mean that 10% of people are using it a lot. But the statement says that most people only use 10% of their brains, so if 10% use a larger portion, that would contradict the statement.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if fMRI shows that a certain brain area is used by a significant number of people, such as 50% of the population, then that supports the statement's opposite.

Wait, but the question is about which scan would disprove the statement. So the correct answer would be the scan that shows a large portion of people are using a significant portion of their brains.

Hmm. So, perhaps the answer is option J, fMRI. Because if it shows that, say, 60% of people use a certain area, that would contradict the statement of most people only using 10% of their brains.

Wait, no, because the statement says that most people only use 10% of their brains. So, if 60% use a specific area, that would mean that 60% use a larger portion than 10%, which would support the statement. But the question is about disproving it, so the opposite scenario.

I'm getting confused. Maybe the correct answer is option J, fMRI. Because if it shows that a large portion of people are using a significant portion of their brains, that would contradict the statement. Alternatively, maybe it's another scan.

Wait, another thought: if the statement is that most people don't use most of their brains, but perhaps use a small portion. So, a scan showing that a small portion of people use a large portion of their brains would support the statement, and a scan showing that a large portion use a small portion would contradict it.

Wait, perhaps the answer is none of the brain scans, but looking at the options, the possible answers are A to J. So, option J (fMRI) would show brain activity. If a lot of people are using a specific brain area (say, the brain's surface), that would suggest that people are using a large portion. So, if the brain area is 10% of the brain, and 90% of people use it, that would show that 90% of people are using 10% of their brains. But the statement says that most people only use 10%, so this would support the statement. But the question is to disprove it, so that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J. Because if fMRI shows that for a certain brain area, a large number of people are using it, that would contradict the statement. For example, if 90% of people use a specific area (like the visual area), which is 10% of the brain, that would mean they're using 10% of their brains. So that would support the statement, not disprove it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each scan's purpose again.

- EEG (Option C) measures real-time brain activity. If it's high in a brain area, it could indicate that people use it a lot.

- MRI (Option I) is similar, but can't show real-time. It shows static images.

- fMRI (Option J) is useful for seeing brain activity over time. So if a scan shows that a certain brain area is active by a large number of people, that would mean that people are using that area a lot. But if that area is the 10% they're using, then it supports the statement. So that's not helpful for disproving.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J because it's the only scan that can show brain activity, which can indicate which parts are being used more by a larger portion of people. So, if a scan shows that a particular brain area is used by a significant portion of people, that would support the statement that most people use a larger portion. Wait, but the statement is that most people only use 10%, so this would not disprove it.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the statement again. It says that most people only use 10% of their brains. So, if the scan shows that a lot of people use a larger portion of their brains, that would support the statement. But if the scan shows that a lot of people use a smaller portion, that would contradict the statement.

Wait, the question is to disprove the statement. So, the scan should show that a lot of people are using a smaller portion of their brains. So, which scan would indicate that. Let's think about each scan.

- CAT and X-ray are imaging techniques, not brain scans.

- EEG: Real-time activity, useful for showing brain activity over time.

- PET: Positron Emission Tomography, shows blood flow, so could indicate brain activity.

- MRI: Shows brain structure, static image.

- SPECT: Cancer imaging, not brain activity.

- Ultrasound: Imaging, not brain activity.

- DTI: Diffusion imaging, which looks at connections between brain regions.

- SPECT: Same as before, not brain activity.

So which scan would show that a large portion of people are using a smaller portion of their brains. For example, if a scan shows that a specific brain area is used by 50% of people, that would contradict the statement.

Alternatively, if a scan shows that a particular brain region is used by a small percentage of people, then that would support the statement. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the answer is option J (fMRI). Because if fMRI shows that a certain brain area is used by a significant portion of people, that would mean that people are using a larger portion of their brains, which would support the statement. But the question is about disproving it. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J. Because if fMRI shows that a particular brain area is used by a large number of people, that would indicate that people are using that area a lot, supporting the statement.

So that's not helpful for disproving.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The statement is that most people don't use most of their brains, but perhaps use a small portion. So, to disprove that, we'd need to show that a large number of people do use a large portion of their brains.

Wait, but the statement is that most people only use 10% of their brains. So, if most people use, say, 50%, that would contradict the statement. So which scan would show that.

So which scan would show that a lot of people are using a larger portion of their brains.

EEG: If a lot of people are using a specific brain area a lot, that would show that a large number of people are using a significant portion.

MRI: If a scan shows that a large portion of people are using a particular brain area, that would show a large brain activity in that area, which could indicate that the area is used by a significant number of people.

Wait, but MRI shows static data. So if a scan shows that a large area is active by a significant number of people, that would support the statement. But if it shows that a small area is active by a large number of people, that would contradict the statement.

So, the answer would be the scan that shows a large portion of people are using a significant portion of their brains. Which scan is that?

Wait, perhaps the answer is option J (fMRI). Because if fMRI shows that a particular brain area is used by a significant number of people, that would suggest that people use a larger portion of their brains. But the statement says that most people only use 10%, so that would support the statement, not disprove.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J. Because if fMRI shows that a particular area is used by a large number of people, that would mean that those people are using a significant portion of their brains. So, for example, if 90% of people use a specific brain region (which is 10% of the brain), that would mean they're using 10% of their brains, supporting the statement. So that doesn't help in disproving.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the question again. The statement is that most people only use 10% of their brains. To disprove it, we need evidence that more than 10% of people use a significant portion of their brains.

- fMRI (J) can show brain activity over time, so if a particular brain area is active by a large number of people, that would show that people are using that area a lot. So, if that area is 10% of the brain, and 90% of people are using it, that would contradict the statement. But that's not possible because the statement says that most people don't use much.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J (fMRI). Because if fMRI shows that a particular brain area is used by a significant number of people, that would indicate that people are using a larger portion of their brains.

So, if the brain area is 10% of the brain, and 90% of people use it, that would contradict the statement. So, a scan that shows that people are using a significant portion of their brains would disprove the statement.

Wait, but in reality, the statement is that most people don't use much of their brains. So, if a scan shows that a large number of people are using a larger portion of their brains, that would support the statement, not disprove it.

Wait, but that would mean the statement is incorrect. But the question is to find the scan that would disprove the statement.

Yes, I think that's it.
</think>

The statement is that most people only use 10% of their brains. To disprove it, we need evidence that a large number of people use a significant portion of their brains. Among the options, **fMRI (Option J)** is the most suitable scan. It can show brain activity over time, and if a particular brain region is used by a significant number of people, it would indicate that people are using a larger portion of their brains. This would contradict the statement, thus disproving it.

ANSWER: J
