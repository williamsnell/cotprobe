Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Why does a physician advise reduced salt intake in cases of hypertension?

Options:

A: Lower salt intake prevents the constriction of blood vessels.
B: Reduced salt intake leads to better insulin sensitivity, which helps lower blood pressure.
C: Reduced salt intake improves heart muscle function directly.
D: Reduced salt intake increases calcium absorption, which indirectly lowers blood pressure.
E: A decreased salt intake causes less water to be retained, decreasing blood volume, and in turn lowering blood pressure.
F: Reduced salt intake helps in weight loss.
G: Decreased salt intake strengthens the heart's electrical system, reducing blood pressure.
H: Decreased salt intake enhances the effectiveness of blood pressure medications.
I: Reduced salt intake reduces the risk of kidney stones.
J: Reduced salt intake decreases the body's cholesterol levels.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about why a physician advises reducing salt intake when someone has hypertension. Hmm. Let me think through this.

Hypertension is when blood pressure is too high. I remember that salt is one of the things that can raise blood pressure. So when someone has hypertension, they might be consuming too much salt, maybe because of diet or stress. The question is why advising them to reduce salt is helpful.

Looking at the options, let's go through each:

Option A: Lower salt prevents constriction of blood vessels. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think too much salt can actually slow blood flow, not stop it. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: Reduced salt improves insulin sensitivity. I think insulin sensitivity is about how cells respond to insulin. Lower salt might affect the body's ability to respond, but does it lead to better insulin sensitivity? Maybe not directly, or maybe this is a stretch. I'm not sure.

Option C: Improved heart muscle function. I don't recall that directly. Maybe some researchers think salt affects the heart, but I think that's not a main reason. So C might be wrong.

Option D: Increased calcium absorption. Wait, salt is a source of table salt, which contains sodium. I think salt is actually a sodium supplement, not calcium. So increasing calcium absorption might be a distractor here. Plus, salt doesn't directly affect calcium in the body. So D seems incorrect.

Option E: Less salt leads to less water retained. Oh, right! Water is about 60-90% of body weight. So if someone is dehydrated, their blood volume decreases, which lowers blood pressure. Lower salt intake could lead to less water retention, so E sounds correct.

Option F: Helps with weight loss. That's a common advice, but I don't think it's specifically about lowering blood pressure. So F is probably not the right choice.

Option G: Strengthens the heart's electrical system. That sounds related to the heart, but I'm not sure how salt affects the electrical system. I think it's more about the heart's ability to pump blood, but maybe not directly. Not sure if this is a correct reason.

Option H: Enhances blood pressure medications. That could be, but the question is about why advise reducing salt, not why medications are better. So H might not be the correct reason.

Option I: Reduces kidney stone risk. No, salt doesn't affect kidney stones. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Decreases cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a different thing. Lowering salt doesn't directly lower cholesterol; that's more about diet. So J is probably wrong.

So the options left are E and D. Let me think again. Option D says calcium absorption increases, which I know salt doesn't affect calcium. It affects sodium, not calcium. So why would increased calcium absorption help? Maybe because salt is considered to contain calcium through the table, but that's not accurate. It's actually sodium. So D is incorrect.

That leaves E as the correct answer. Deceasing salt leads to less water retention, which lowers blood volume and thus blood pressure.

The correct answer is E: Reduced salt intake leads to less water being retained, decreasing blood volume and indirectly lowering blood pressure.

Answer: E
