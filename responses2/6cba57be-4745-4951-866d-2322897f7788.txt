Question:

An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration
B: Immediate cesarean section
C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels
D: Monitor patient without taking action
E: Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations
F: Administer a pregnancy test
G: Prescribe oral contraceptives
H: Ultrasonography
I: Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration
J: Conduct a pelvic exam

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about an 18-year-old woman who's having a prenatal visit. Let me break this down. 

The patient is 16 weeks gestational age and hasn't had her last menstrual period yet. She mentions that the pregnancy probably happened right after she stopped using oral contraceptives five months ago. I remember that oral contraceptives are often used to control bleeding, but they might interfere with fetal development. So, if she stopped using them, that could be a good indicator that something went wrong, maybe the embryo started developing.

The question also says her MSAFP concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Wait, MSAFP is maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. I think this is a marker used to estimate fetal alcohol metabolism or fetal growth. If it's increased, that could be concerning. I remember that when there's an increase, it might indicate that the mother's body is producing more alcohol, or maybe there's something wrong with the fetal development, like an embryo issue.

So, the options are a bunch of medical tests. Let's go through them one by one. Option A is amniocentesis. That's a procedure to check for fetus health, including MSAFP. But wait, if the patient is at 16 weeks, she's already in the second trimester (since 16 is about when the embryo begins to form in the mother's uterus). So she's already starting to have signs of an issue, maybe a gestational anomaly. Amniocentesis could be used to check for any issues, so maybe that's a good option.

Option B says immediate cesarean. C section is drastic, but if the mother's already showing signs of fetal issues, like low maternal serum levels, maybe she's already at risk. If she's had a gestational anomaly, an intrauterine pregnancy could be an option. But the question says she's not sure about her last menstrual period, so maybe she's just starting to feel the signs of something wrong. If the MSAFP is high, that could be a sign of something wrong, so an intrauterine pregnancy might be indicated.

Option C is hormone therapy. But if the patient stopped oral contraceptives, that's probably before any significant change in hormonal patterns. Or perhaps the issue is with the mother's body's response, not her hormones. So hormone therapy might not be the right approach here.

Option D is monitoring without action. If she's already at a high risk, maybe it's better to address it immediately. So not taking any action could lead to more complications, so monitoring might be the next step.

Option E is triple screening for MS AFP, β hCG, and estriol. I don't recall hearing about a triple screen for all three. I think each marker is checked separately. Triple screening might be too expensive or not as effective, so probably not the best option.

Option F is a pregnancy test. But the patient is at 16 weeks, which is the second trimester. Advance diagnosis is better done before giving a test. So she shouldn't take the test until after the ultrasound or if she's certain of her diagnosis.

Option G is prescribing oral contraceptives. She's already given oral contraceptives, but the question is about her next steps. Prescribing again might not be the best option. She might have a gestational anomaly, so oral contraceptives might not be effective.

Option H is ultrasonography. That's used to check the fetus, but again, if she's at 16 weeks, that's intrauterine. Usonography can check for gestational issues, but I'm not sure if it's the best first step in this situation.

Option I is repeat measurement of MSAFP. But why would she do that again? She already has it at 3 med levels. Maybe it's a follow-up to confirm an issue.

Option J is pelvic exam. That's a good initial check, but since she's already at 16 weeks, that's probably too late. She has a gestational anomaly, so the pelvic exam may not be sufficient.

So, putting it all together. She's in the second trimester, and there's an increase in MSAFP. She's not sure about her last menstrual period, which suggests she's starting to have issues. If the MSAFP is high, it's concerning that the fetus might have developed an issue. So, the next steps are either to order an intrauterine pregnancy or a triple screen for other markers.

But the options don't have an option like that. Let me look again. The options are A to J. So, option A is amniocentesis. That's a procedure to check the fetus, which can be used to detect issues like gestational anomalies. So she would benefit from that.

Alternatively, option B is immediate C section. But she's already at 16 weeks, which suggests she's at a high-risk for intrauterine, so a C section might not be necessary. 

So the best next step would be to check for any issues, which is option A. Therefore, the answer should be option A.

The patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks gestational age who has not yet had her last menstrual period but notes that the pregnancy occurred immediately after stopping oral contraceptives five months ago. Her maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) is elevated to 3 multiples of the median. Given the current stage (second trimester), the most appropriate next step is to conduct an intrauterine pregnancy evaluation, as the elevated MSAFP suggests potential fetal issues.

**Answer: A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration**
