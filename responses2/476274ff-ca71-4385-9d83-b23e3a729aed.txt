In what region of the electromagnetic spectrum would there appear a spectral line resulting from the transition from the tenth to the fifth electronic level in hydrogen?

Options:

A: Gamma-ray region
B: X-ray region
C: Infrared region
D: Extreme Ultraviolet region
E: Radio region

Okay, so I've got this question about the Bohr model and the hydrogen atom's spectral lines. Hmm. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the region of the electromagnetic spectrum where a certain transition would appear.

Wait, the transition is from the tenth to the fifth electronic level. Oh wait, wait, n_2 is the higher level, so n2 would be 10, and n1 is 5 because it's the lower level. Or wait, maybe I got that backward. No, wait, the transition is from n2 to n1, and the formula uses (1/n1² - 1/n2²). So the Rydberg formula is 1/lambda equals R_H times (1/n1² - 1/n2²). Oh wait, no, the formula is 1/lambda = R_H [ (1/n1²) - (1/n2²) ].

Wait, but wait, isn't the Rydberg formula typically 1/lambda = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²) where n2 is the higher energy level? Because when electrons drop from a higher level to a lower one, they emit radiation, and the wavelength (or wave number) is calculated that way. So in this case, the transition is from a higher level (n2 =10) to a lower one (n1=5). So the formula would be 1/lambda = R_H [1/5² - 1/10²].

Let me compute that. 1/5 squared is 1/25, which is 0.04, and 1/10 squared is 1/100, which is 0.01. So their difference is 0.04 - 0.01 = 0.03. So 1/lambda is R_H multiplied by 0.03. R_H is the Rydberg constant, which I think is about 1.097e7 m^-1. So 1/lambda ≈ 1.097e7 * 0.03 = 3.291e5 m^-1. So lambda is 1/(3.291e5) meters. Let me compute that.

Wait, 1/(3.291e5) is approximately 3.038e-6 meters, which is 3038 nanometers. Because 1e-9 meters is a nano unit. So 3038 nm is the wavelength. What region is that?

Oh wait, the visible spectrum is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 3038 nm is way beyond red. What's after red? Oh yeah, then there's the UV region. The visible region ends around 700 nm, then comes near UV. So 3000 nm is in the UV.

Wait, but wait: the options are given as A through J. Let me look at the options. Option F is Visible, G is Microwave, H is Terahertz, I is Soft X-ray, J is Ultraviolet. So the correct region would be in the ultraviolet region, right? Because 3000 nm is in the UV. So the answer would be option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I get the energy levels mixed up. Let me double-check. The transition is from n=10 to n=5. So 1/lambda is R_H (1/5² - 1/10²). Wait, wait wait, no, wait, the formula is 1/lambda = R_H [1/(n1^2) - 1/(n2^2)], but in this case, n2 is the higher level, so n2=10 and n1=5. So 1/lambda would be R_H (1/25 -1/100) = R_H (0.04 - 0.01) = 0.03 R_H. So yes, lambda is 1/(0.03 R_H). R_H is about 1.097e7 m^-1, so 0.03 * that is 3.29e5 m^-1. 1/3.29e5 is approximately 3.03e-6 meters, which is 3038 nm. Yep, that's UV. So the answer is J.

The question involves determining the region of the electromagnetic spectrum for a spectral line resulting from an electronic transition in hydrogen from the tenth to the fifth energy level. The transition corresponds to the emission line associated with the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( n_2 = 10 \) (higher energy level) and \( n_1 = 5 \) (lower energy level). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{5^2} - \frac{1}{10^2} \right) = R_H \left( \frac{1}{25} - \frac{1}{100} \right) = R_H \cdot 0.03.
\]

Using the Rydberg constant \( R_H \approx 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} \approx 1.097 \times 10^7 \cdot 0.03 = 3.291 \times 10^5 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the wavelength is:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{1}{3.291 \times 10^5} \approx 3.038 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 3038 \, \text{nm}.
\]

The visible spectrum spans approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The wavelength \( 3038 \, \text{nm} \) falls outside the visible region, into the ultraviolet region. Among the options provided:

- **A: Gamma-ray region** — Incorrect, as gamma rays are much higher energy.
- **B: X-ray region** — Incorrect, as X-rays are even higher energy.
- **C: Infrared region** — Incorrect, as infrared is much lower energy.
- **D: Extreme Ultraviolet region** — Incorrect, as the wavelength is within the ultraviolet.
- **E: Radio region** — Incorrect, as radio waves have much shorter wavelengths.
- **F: Visible region** — Incorrect, as the wavelength is far outside the visible spectrum.
- **G: Microwave region** — Incorrect, as microwaves have lower energy.
- **H: Terahertz region** — Incorrect, as terahertz waves have much lower energy.
- **J: Ultraviolet region** — Correct, as the wavelength falls within the ultraviolet range.

Thus, the spectral line resulting from the transition appears in the ultraviolet region.
