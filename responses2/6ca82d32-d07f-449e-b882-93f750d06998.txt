Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a rectangular guide that's used to guide electromagnetic radiation. The guide has a certain width 'a'. The problem states that the electromagnetic radiation has a free-space wavelength of 3.0 cm. The task is to find the width 'a' such that the energy of the radiation travels down the guide at 95% and then 50% of the speed of light. The options are given from A to J, each with specific 'a' values for the two scenarios.

Hmm. Wait a second. I remember that when electromagnetic waves pass through a medium, their speed changes. The speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, the question here is about the speed of the electromagnetic radiation traveling down the guide. Hmm, wait, the problem says the energy of the radiation travels at 95% and 50% the speed of light. Oh wait, but in a guide, the speed of the wave inside is v = c/n. But wait, is the speed given as a fraction of the speed of light in a vacuum? Because in a medium, the speed is lower than c. Or is it the speed in the guide?

Wait, the question says "the energy of electromagnetic radiation whose free-space wavelength is 3.0 cm travels down the guide at 95% of the speed of light." Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The free-space wavelength is 3.0 cm, which is the wavelength in vacuum, right? But the speed of the radiation inside the guide would depend on the refractive index.

Wait, but the speed of the wave in the guide is actually the speed of light in the medium, which is c/n. So the speed of the electromagnetic wave (like the photon) inside the guide is v = c/n.

But wait, the problem states that the speed is 95% of the speed of light. So if the guide's material has a refractive index n, then v = c/n. So if v = 0.95c, then 0.95c = c/n → n = 1/0.95 ≈ 1.0526. But wait, that can't be right because n is always greater than 1 for most materials. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.95c would be less than c, which would require that n is greater than 1 because v = c/n. So if v = 0.95c, then n = c/(0.95c) = 1/0.95 ≈ 1.0526. That's correct.

Oh wait, but wait. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The question is about the speed of the electromagnetic radiation (photon) traveling down the guide. So the speed of the photon inside the guide is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index of the material the radiation travels through. But for a rectangular guide, if the guide's material is a dielectric, then the speed is c/n. But if the guide is filled with a medium with a larger refractive index than vacuum, then the speed is slower.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the radiation traveling down. Wait, the energy aspect—does the energy relate to the frequency? Or maybe the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency. Since the frequency is related to the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of the electromagnetic radiation. So the speed 'v' of the electromagnetic wave in the guide is c/n, and for the guide to allow the wave to travel at a certain fraction of the speed of light, v = 0.95c or 0.5c. So let's see.

Wait, but wait: the speed of the wave in the medium (guide) is c/n, where n is the refractive index. So if the guide is made of a material with refractive index n, then the speed of the wave is v = c/n. So to have the wave speed at 95% of c, the refractive index must be n = c/(0.95c) = 1/0.95 ≈ 1.0526. Similarly, for 50% speed, n = c/(0.5c) = 2.0.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again: the speed of the wave in the medium is v = c/n. So if the speed must be 0.95c, then n = c/(0.95c) = 1/0.95 ≈ 1.0526. Similarly, for 0.5c, n = 2.0.

But wait, wait a second. The question refers to the energy of the radiation. Wait, the energy of a photon is inversely related to the wavelength. So E = hc/λ. So if the wavelength is smaller, the energy is higher. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here, because the question is about the speed of the wave, not the energy.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back. The problem is asking, what must be the width 'a' of the guide so that the energy of the radiation travels down the guide at 95% and then 50% of the speed of light.

Wait, perhaps the key here is the phase velocity and the group velocity. But in a rectangular guide, the phase velocity is v = c/n, but the group velocity is lower. So perhaps the group velocity is the one that matters here. But I'm not too sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is about the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave in the guide. The phase velocity is v_phase = c/n. So for the phase velocity to be 0.95c, the refractive index n is 1/0.95 ≈ 1.0526. Then the width of the guide a would have to relate to the wavelength in the material.

Wait, but wait. The wavelength in a medium is λ' = λ0 / n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum. The problem gives λ0 as 3.0 cm. So the wavelength inside the guide is λ' = 3.0 cm / n.

Wait, but the question is about the guide's width 'a'; maybe the width is determined by the wavelength in the guide. Or perhaps the guide's size needs to be such that the period of the wave matches the size of the guide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the wavelength again. The wavelength in the medium is λ = λ0 / n. So for n = 1.0526, the wavelength would be 3.0 cm / 1.0526 ≈ 2.85 cm. But wait, the guide's width is a.

Wait, but the question is about the guide's width 'a'. I'm a bit stuck on the exact relation here. Maybe if the guide's width is less than the wavelength in the medium, then the wave can't propagate. So in a guide, the wave's wavelength must be smaller than the guide's width for the wave to propagate. So perhaps a must be greater than λ in the medium for the wave to propagate.

But wait, the question is about the speed. So perhaps the guide's width 'a' must be such that the wavelength in the guide is smaller than the guide's width, but I'm not sure how that relates to the speed.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's see, the phase velocity in the guide is v = c/n. So for the phase velocity to be 0.95c, n is 1/0.95 ≈ 1.0526. Then, the wavelength in the guide is λ' = λ0 / n. So λ' = 3.0 cm / 1.0526 ≈ 2.85 cm.

The guide's width 'a' must be at least the wavelength in the medium for the wave to propagate. So a >= λ'.

Similarly, for 50% speed, n=2.0, so λ' = 3.0 cm / 2.0 = 1.5 cm. So a must be at least 1.5 cm.

But wait, the options give different 'a's. Let's look at the options.

Looking at option H: a=6.0cm for 95% speed, a=3.0cm for 50%. Wait, but for 95%, n is 1.0526, so λ' is 2.85 cm. So a must be at least 2.85 cm.

But option H says a=6.0cm for 95% speed. That's larger than 2.85, so that would make sense. But the a for 95% is 6.0 cm, which is way larger than 2.85 cm. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the problem wrong. Maybe the question is not about the phase velocity but about the group velocity. Or perhaps the speed of the electromagnetic wave's energy is different.

Wait, another thought: The energy E of the wave is proportional to its frequency. The frequency f is given by f = c/λ. So for the same wavelength, higher frequency would mean higher energy.

But the speed of the wave in the medium is v = λ f. So v = λ (c/λ) )= c. Wait, that can't be right. No, because in a medium, v = c/n.

Wait, so v = c/n. So the speed is lower than c. So the wave's speed is v.

Wait, but the question is about the energy. Hmm. Wait, the energy per unit volume is related to the frequency. So for a given guide, the energy depends on the frequency. But perhaps the question is about the speed the wave travels in the guide, which is v = c/n.

Wait, the problem is a bit tricky. Let me re-read it.

"What must be the width a of a rectangular guide such that the energy of electromagnetic radiation whose free-space wavelength is 3.0cm travels down the guide at 95% of the speed of light? (a) at 95% of the speed of light, a = ... ; (b) at 50% of the speed at... " Oh, wait, the question is two parts (a) and (b). So for (a), the speed is 95% of c, and (b) 50% of c.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the speed of the wave (v) is 0.95c or 0.5c, which is the speed of the wave in the guide. So v = c/n → n = c/v.

Wait, but for (a), v = 0.95c. So n = 1/(0.95) ≈1.0526. For (b), v=0.5c → n=2.0.

But how does that relate to the width 'a'?

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the period of the wave in the guide. The period T = λ' / v. Wait, in the guide, the phase velocity is v, so the period is T = λ' / v.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Let me think about the guide's dimensions.

Wait, perhaps the width of the guide affects the wavelength in the guide. So the width 'a' must be such that the wavelength in the guide is smaller than 'a'. Because for a wave to propagate in the guide, the guide's physical dimensions must be larger than the wavelength in the medium.

So, lambda' = lambda0 / n. The width a must be >= lambda', else the wave can't propagate.

So for (a) when v=0.95c, lambda' = 3.0 cm / 1.0526 ≈ 2.85 cm. So a must be at least 2.85 cm. Looking at the options, for (a) a is 6.0 cm, which is bigger. But the options have (a) 6.0 and (b) 3.0. That's not matching.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again. For (a), a is 6.0 cm. For (b), a is 3.0 cm.

But if I'm using the phase velocity approach, for (a), n=1/0.95=1.0526. lambda' =3/(1.0526)=~2.85 cm. So a must be at least 2.85 cm. So the options have a=6.0 cm for (a), which is larger. But let's look at (b): v=0.5c. So n=2.0. lambda' =3/(2)=1.5 cm. So a must be at least 1.5 cm.

Looking at the options, for (b), the a is 3.0 cm, which is larger than 1.5 cm. Wait, but 3.0 cm is larger than 1.5 cm. So that would mean the wave can't propagate because a is larger than lambda', but in reality, a must be larger than lambda' for the wave to propagate. So a >= lambda'.

So for (a), n=1.0526, lambda' =2.85 cm. So a must be at least 2.85 cm. The option for (a) is 6.0 cm, which is larger. So that's acceptable.

But wait, looking at the options, option H says a=6.0 for (a), a=3.0 for (b). So for (b), a is 3.0 cm, but the lambda' is 1.5 cm. So 3.0 cm is larger than 1.5 cm, so the wave can't propagate. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Because the options may be considering the wave's phase velocity, but perhaps the width is related to the wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the phase velocity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the guide's dimensions being such that the wavelength in the guide is half the width, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: If the width 'a' is the same as the wavelength in the medium, then lambda' = a. But that would mean the wavelength is a, so the guide's width is equal to the wavelength, but for a wave to propagate, the guide's width must be at least the wavelength. So a must be >= lambda'.

Wait, perhaps the width 'a' is set to be equal to lambda' for the wave to just start propagating. So for (a), lambda' is 2.85 cm, so a must be 2.85 cm. The option for (a) is 6.0 cm, which is larger than required. So that's okay.

But the options for (a) is 6.0 cm, which is acceptable. For (b), lambda' is 1.5 cm, so a must be 1.5 cm, which is what option H says. But wait, in option H, for (b), a is 3.0 cm, which is larger than 1.5 cm, which would mean the wave cannot propagate. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the width 'a' is related to the wavelength in a different way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy of the wave. Let me consider that. The energy of the wave is proportional to the frequency, which is E = hν. The frequency ν is related to the wavelength λ by ν = c/λ (in vacuum). But in the medium, the speed v = c/n, so the frequency in the medium is ν' = ν = c/λ' = c/(λ/n) )= (c/n)/λ. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per unit area is given by the Poynting vector, which is E × H. But without knowing the exact setup, perhaps this is not the right path.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The question is about the speed of the electromagnetic radiation traveling down the guide. So perhaps the question is about the speed in the guide, which is v = c/n.

But I'm supposed to find the width 'a' of the guide. Wait, wait — perhaps the question is about the phase velocity of the wave in the guide, which is v = c/n. And the phase velocity must be 0.95c or 0.5c. So for (a), n= 1.0526, for (b), n=2.0.

But the width 'a' must be greater than lambda' (wavelength in the guide) for the wave to propagate. So for (a), a >= 2.85 cm. The option for (a) is 6.0 cm, which is acceptable. For (b), a=3.0 cm is >= 1.5 cm, which is correct. But that's a problem because for (b), the guide's width is 3 cm, which is larger than the lambda' of 1.5 cm, so the wave can propagate. So the option H says a=3.0 cm for (b), which is correct.

Wait, but according to the options:

Looking at option H: a=6.0 for (95%), a=3.0 for (50%).

Wait, but wait. The options for (a) are a=6.0 cm, which is larger than the 2.85 cm required. So that's acceptable. For (b), a=3.0 cm is larger than 1.5 cm, which is okay. So the option H is H: a=6.0 for (95%), a=3.0 for (50%). But wait, the question says the width 'a' must be the same for both scenarios.

Wait, but the options each have a as 6.0 for (95%) and 3.0 for (50%). So that's the same 'a' for both.

But wait, I thought the width 'a' needs to be longer than lambda' in the guide. So for (a), lambda' is 2.85 cm, so a must be at least 2.85 cm. So the option a=6.0 is acceptable.

For (b), a must be at least 1.5 cm. The option a=3.0 is acceptable.

So the correct option would have a=6.0 for (95%), and a=3.0 for (50%). Looking at the options, option H says that. So H is the correct option.

Wait, but let me check another angle. Maybe the width 'a' is related to the wavelength in the guide. So perhaps a is set to be equal to the wavelength in the guide. So a = lambda' = 2.85 cm for (a), which is not among the options. Wait, but the options for (a) are 6.0 cm, which is larger than 2.85 cm. So that's allowed.

But perhaps I'm supposed to consider the phase velocity, and find the width 'a' such that the wavelength in the guide is a certain value. Let me think: if the width 'a' is set to be such that a = lambda' * (n), then a = lambda' * (c/(v)).

Wait, but this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of the problem in terms of the options given.

The options for a are:

A: a=6.0 for (95%), a=5.0 for (50%)
B: a=3.0 for (95%), a=6.0 for (50%)
C: a=4.0 for (95%), a=6.0 for (50%)
D: a=5.0 for (95%), a=4.0 for (50%)
E: a=3.0 for (95%), a=5.0 for (50%)
F: a=4.0 for (95%), a=3.0 for (50%)
G: a=3.0 for (95%), a=6.0 for (50%)
H: a=6.0 for (95%), a=3.0 for (50%)
I: same as H, but a=3.8 for (95%) and 5.0 for (50%)
J: a=3.8 for (95%), a=6.0 for (50%)

Now, according to our earlier analysis, the correct option should have a=6.0 for (95%) and a=3.0 for (50%). So option H.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the other options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the phase velocity, but I'm not able to find the correct option with the given data. Maybe I should think of it differently.

Another possibility: The width 'a' must be such that the wavelength in the guide is half the width, which would make the width twice the wavelength. But that's a stretch, and I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the width 'a' is such that the wavelength in the guide is equal to the width, so lambda' = a. So for (95%), lambda' = 3.0 / 1.0526 ≈ 2.85 cm, so a must be at least 2.85 cm. So the option H for (95%) is a=6.0, which is acceptable.

For (50%), lambda' = 3.0 / 2.0 = 1.5 cm. So a must be at least 1.5 cm. The option H for (50%) is a=3.0, which is larger than 1.5, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but the question says, what must be the width a of the guide such that the energy... So perhaps the correct option is H, but looking at the options, option H is a=6.0 and a=3.0, which matches our analysis.

So the correct answer should be H.
</think>

The question involves determining the width \( a \) of a rectangular guide such that the energy of electromagnetic radiation with a free-space wavelength of 3.0 cm travels down the guide at 95% of the speed of light and 50% of the speed of light. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Relationship**: The speed of the electromagnetic radiation in the guide is given by \( v = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the guide material. For a wave to propagate in the guide, the width \( a \) must be at least the wavelength \( \lambda' \) of the wave in the guide, i.e., \( a \geq \lambda' \).

2. **Wavelength in the Guide**: The wavelength of the wave in the guide is related to the free-space wavelength by \( \lambda' = \frac{\lambda_0}{n} \), where \( \lambda_0 = 3.0 \, \text{cm} \).

3. **Refractive Index**: For the given speeds:
   - At 95% of the speed of light, \( v = 0.95c \), so \( n = \frac{c}{v} = \frac{c}{0.95c} = \frac{1}{0.95} \approx 1.0526 \).
   - At 50% of the speed of light, \( v = 0.5c \), so \( n = \frac{c}{v} = \frac{c}{0.5c} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2.0 \).

4. **Wavelength in the Guide**:
   - For \( n = 1.0526 \), \( \lambda' = \frac{3.0}{1.0526} \approx 2.85 \, \text{cm} \). Thus, \( a \geq 2.85 \, \text{cm} \).
   - For \( n = 2.0 \), \( \lambda' = \frac{3.0}{2.0} = 1.5 \, \text{cm} \). Thus, \( a \geq 1.5 \, \text{cm} \).

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - For (a), \( a = 6.0 \, \text{cm} \) is acceptable since \( 6.0 \, \text{cm} > 2.85 \, \text{cm} \).
   - For (b), \( a = 3.0 \, \text{cm} \) is acceptable since \( 3.0 \, \text{cm} > 1.5 \, \text{cm} \).
   - The width \( a \) must be the same for both scenarios. Thus, the option that satisfies both conditions is \( a = 6.0 \, \text{cm} \) for (a) and \( a = 3.0 \, \text{cm} \) for (b).

6. **Conclusion**: The correct option is \( H \), where \( a = 6.0 \, \text{cm} \) for 95% of the speed of light and \( a = 3.0 \, \text{cm} \) for 50% of the speed of light.

ANSWER: H
