Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me. It's about moles and atoms. Let me think through it.

The question is asking how many moles are there in one atom. Hmm, I remember that moles and atoms are related through Avogadro's number. Oh right, Avogadro's principle states that one mole of any substance contains exactly 6.022 x 10^23 atoms. Wait, but wait, the question is the opposite. It's asking about the number of moles in one atom. So if one mole is 6.02 x 10^23 atoms, then one atom would be 1 divided by Avogadro's number.

So the calculation would be 1 / 6.022e23. Let me do that. 1 divided by 6.022 is approximately 0.166, and then multiplied by 1e-23 gives 1.66e-24 moles. Wait, but I'm not sure if I remembered that correctly. Another way to think about it: each mole contains a huge number of atoms. So one mole is a big chunk, and one atom is just a fraction of that. So the number of moles in one atom must be a tiny fraction—like 0.000000000000000000000166, which is 1.66e-24. 

Looking at the options, option E is 1.66 × 10^-24 moles. That matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be E. Let me make sure none of the other options make sense. Option A is 2 moles, which is too high. Option F is 5e-23, which is close but still not matching the calculation. Option G is 1 mole, but that's for a mole of something else. Option J is 0.5, which is half a mole. So none of the other options fit. So the correct choice is E.

The question asks how many moles are in one atom. Using Avogadro's number, which states that one mole contains 6.022 × 10^23 atoms, we find the number of moles in one atom by taking the reciprocal. 

1 / (6.022 × 10^23) ≈ 1.66 × 10^-24 moles. This matches option E. Other options are too large or incorrect. 

Answer: E
