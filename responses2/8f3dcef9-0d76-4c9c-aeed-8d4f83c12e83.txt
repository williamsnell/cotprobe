Okay, let's see. I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. So the question is about a collision between two carts and what's conserved or changes after the collision. Let's break it down.

So, the setup is a cart with a mass of 1.5 kg colliding with another cart that's 0.5 kg and is initially at rest. After the collision, they stick together, meaning it's a perfectly inelastic collision. The question is asking what remains the same after the collision. The options are velocity, potential energy, torque, gravitational pull, kinetic energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, acceleration, force, or mass.

Hmm. I remember from physics that when two objects collide and stick together, the concept of conservation of momentum applies. Because momentum is a vector quantity, the total momentum before the collision equals the total after. Since the second cart was initially at rest, its momentum was zero. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the first cart. 

Wait, but what about after the collision? The combined mass is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 kg. The initial momentum was (1.5 kg)(v_initial). After collision, it's (2 kg)(v_final). So momentum is conserved, which means 1.5*v_initial = 2*v_final. So the velocity after the collision would be (1.5/2) times the initial velocity. So the velocity is different, because the masses are different.

But the question is about what remains the same. So looking at the options, which quantities are conserved in a collision. Linear momentum is conserved in the absence of external forces (Newton's law), so that's a candidate. But what about the other options.

Velocity after the collision is (1.5/2)v_initial, so it's less than the initial velocity. So velocity isn't the same. So option A is not correct.

What about torque? Torque is about rotation, and unless there's a reason for rotation, like if they stick and move, torque might not apply. But the problem says they stick and presumably move in the same direction, so I don't think torque is conserved.

Potential energy (B) and gravitational pull (D) are not the same. The first cart was moving, and the second is at rest, so unless the collision causes them to move in a circular path where potential energy changes, but I don't think that's the case here. So B and D are out.

Acceleration (E) is the rate of change of velocity. Since the collision is inelastic and there's no external force (assuming it's a collision on a frictionless surface), the acceleration would be zero. So acceleration after collision is same as before? Wait, before the collision, the first cart was moving, so acceleration was non-zero. After, both move together, so their acceleration is zero. So acceleration isn't the same.

Force (F) is about the net force applied. Newton's third law says that the force between the two would be the same. But the question is about what remains the same. So what's conserved? Linear momentum (F is Newton's third law, but the question is about something that is conserved, not the force itself).

What about angular momentum? If there's rotation involved, but the problem doesn't mention anything about rotation or torque causing angular changes. So angular momentum might not be conserved unless there's an external torque, which isn't indicated here. So probably not.

What about the linear momentum? Since the collision is inelastic and assuming no external forces, linear momentum is conserved. So the initial linear momentum is (1.5 kg)(v_initial). After collision, it's (2 kg)(v_final). But the question is about what remains the same. So the linear momentum changes because the masses changed. So do they have the same linear momentum? No, because 1.5 != 2, so unless the velocity changes to compensate, which it does, but the question is about what is the same. So if the masses are different, the linear momentum after is different. So the only option that is conserved is linear momentum. So the answer would be option F.

Wait, but the question says, "immediately after the collision, the carts each have the same ______ as each other." So what's conservedâ€”linear momentum. So the same linear momentum? Or what? Wait, no. Because the first cart was moving, and the second was at rest. After collision, both move together. So the initial momentum is p = 1.5v. The final momentum is (1.5 + 0.5)v_final = 2v_f. So unless 1.5v = 2v_f, their momenta are different. But the question is, what's same? So it's possible that after collision, their kinetic energy might be the same, but the question is about what remains the same. So which of the options is conserved.

Wait, the question is about what remains the same. So which of the options is conserved. Let me think again. 

In a collision where external forces are not acting, linear momentum is conserved. So after the collision, the momentum of each cart is part of the total. So the total linear momentum before and after collision is the same. So the linear momentum is conserved, but the individual momenta of the two may not be the same. For example, if the first cart was moving, and the second was at rest, their individual momenta before were (1.5 v) and 0.5 * 0 = 0. After collision, their combined momentum is 2 v_final. Since 1.5 v = 2 v_final, the total is conserved. So the total momentum is the same, but individual momenta change.

So the question is, what remains the same. So what is conserved? Linear momentum. So after collision, the total momentum is same as before. So the same as each other? No, because each cart's individual momentum changes. So among the options, the momentum is conserved. So which option is that? Option F is linear momentum. So the correct answer is F.

To determine what remains the same after the collision, we analyze the situation using the principles of physics. A cart of mass 1.5 kg collides with and sticks to a cart of mass 0.5 kg, which was initially at rest. This is an inelastic collision, so kinetic energy is not conserved, but linear momentum is conserved in the absence of external forces.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Momentum**:  
   The first cart is moving with an initial velocity \( v \), so its initial momentum is \( p_{\text{initial}} = 1.5 \, \text{kg} \cdot v \). The second cart is at rest, so its initial momentum is \( 0 \). Thus, the total initial momentum is \( 1.5 \, \text{kg} \cdot v \).

2. **Final Momentum**:  
   After the collision, the two carts stick together, forming a combined mass of \( 1.5 \, \text{kg} + 0.5 \, \text{kg} = 2 \, \text{kg} \). Let the final velocity be \( v_{\text{final}} \). The total final momentum is \( p_{\text{final}} = 2 \, \text{kg} \cdot v_{\text{final}} \).

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   Since there are no external forces acting on the system, linear momentum is conserved. Therefore, \( p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}} \), which gives \( 1.5 \, \text{kg} \cdot v = 2 \, \text{kg} \cdot v_{\text{final}} \). Solving for \( v_{\text{final}} \), we find \( v_{\text{final}} = \frac{1.5}{2} v = 0.75 v \). This shows that the velocity of the combined system decreases after the collision.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **A: Velocity**: The velocity of the combined system decreases, so velocity is not the same after the collision.  
   - **B: Potential energy**: Potential energy is not conserved because the carts stick together and do not move in a circular path.  
   - **C: Torque**: Torque is about rotation, which is not relevant here since no rotational effects are mentioned.  
   - **D: Gravitational pull**: This force is not conserved because the carts move together, and the gravitational force acts over the same path.  
   - **E: Acceleration**: The acceleration of the combined system is zero after the collision, so acceleration is not the same.  
   - **F: Linear momentum**: Linear momentum is conserved in the absence of external forces.  
   - **G: Angular momentum**: This is not relevant as there is no indication of rotation.  
   - **H: Acceleration**: As noted, the acceleration is zero after the collision.  
   - **I: Force**: Newton's third law applies, but the question asks about what remains the same, not the force itself.  
   - **J: Mass**: The total mass of the system changes, so mass is not the same.

### Conclusion:
The only quantity that remains the same after the collision is **linear momentum**.
