Okay, so I've got this question about partnership interests and basis. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about calculating Skinner's basis in the partnership interest. Let's break down the details given.

First, Skinner contributed $5,000 cash and land. The land's basis is $12,000, and the fair market value (FMV) is $20,000. There's a mortgage of $10,000 that the partnership assumed, which means the liability is offloaded from the land to the partnership. Oh wait, actually, if the land is subject to a mortgage, that's an asset for the partnership. So the partnership's basis in the land increases by the amount of the mortgage. Hmm, I've heard that part before. So the basis of the land becomes the partnership's basis plus the mortgage, right? So the land's basis goes from $12,000 to $22,000? Or wait, was the basis of the land before any adjustments. Wait, no, the basis of the land is $12,000, but the partnership assumes a $10,000 mortgage, so they take that off the basis. So the land's basis for the partnership is $12,000 (original) minus $10,000 (mortgage) = $2,000? Or is the basis of the land the basis of the land contributed, which is $12,000, and the partnership takes on the mortgage? So the partnership's basis in the land becomes $12,000 plus $10,000 (since the partnership assumes it). Wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. If the partnership takes on a mortgage, the liability is offloaded. The partnership's basis in the land increases by the amount of the mortgage. So the basis would be land's basis plus the mortgage, so $12,000 + $10,000 equals $22,000. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should remember that the partnership's basis in the contributed property is adjusted by any liabilities assumed. So the basis would be the basis of the property contributed minus any liabilities assumed.

Wait, no. The partnership's basis in the land is the basis of the land contributed, which is $12,000, plus any liabilities the partnership assumed. Because when you contribute property to a partnership, the partnership's basis in that property is the basis of the property plus any liabilities assumed by the partnership. So the partnership's basis would be $12,000 (land's basis) plus $10,000 (mortgage) = $22,000. But wait, the mortgage is an assumed liability, so for the partnership's basis, they take that off the basis of the land. So the partnership's basis in the land is $12,000 (land's basis) plus $10,000 (liability) equals $22,000. Wait, no, the partnership's basis in the land is the basis of the land plus any liabilities they assumed. So the basis of the land is $12,000, and the partnership takes on $10,000, so the partnership's basis in the land would be $12,000 plus $10,000 = $22,000. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the land's fair market value was $20,000. So the partnership's basis is $22,000. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here, maybe I should look it up in my notes, but since I can't, I'll proceed.

Now, Skinner contributed $5,000 cash. Cash is considered separately. The basis in cash is the same as the contributed amount, so $5,000.

So putting it together, the total basis contributed is $5,000 (cash) plus $22,000 (land) = $27,000. But wait, there are other factors. The partnership has recourse liabilities of $20,000, shared according to their interests. Wait, but does that affect the basis? Oh, right, the partnership's basis is the sum of the contributed property's adjusted basis plus any adjustments. Let me think again.

Wait, another thing: when you contribute property, the partnership's basis in the contributed property is adjusted by any liabilities. So the basis is the basis of the property plus any assumed liabilities. So if the land has a mortgage, the partnership's basis in the land is $12,000 + $10,000 = $22,000. The cash is $5,000, so total is $27,000. But wait, the partnership also has recourse liabilities of $20,000. Oh wait, no, that's part of the partnership's liabilities. How does that affect the basis?

I think the partnership's basis is calculated as the sum of the adjusted basis of the contributed property plus any adjustments. The cash is straightforward. The land's basis is $12,000 plus $10,000 (assuming), so $22,000. Plus $5,000 cash, total is $27,000. But wait, the partnership also has $20,000 in recourse liabilities. I'm not sure how that plays into basis calculation. I think the partnership's basis is the sum of the contributed property's adjusted basis plus the cash and other contributed assets, and then subtract any liabilities. Wait, maybe the partnership's basis is the sum of the contributions minus any liabilities. So the total contributions are $5,000 cash and $22,000 land, totaling $27,000. Then, subtract the partnership's assumed liabilities. Since the partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage, that's a liability, so the basis is $27,000 minus $10,000 = $17,000? Or is it plus? Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: The partnership's basis is calculated as the sum of the adjusted basis of the contributed property (land plus any other assets) plus contributions, minus any liabilities assumed. Or is it the sum of the contributed property's basis plus any contributions, minus any liabilities?

Alternatively, the partnership's basis is the sum of the adjusted basis of the contributed property plus contributions, minus any liabilities. So for the land, the basis is $12,000 plus $10,000 (because the partnership took on the mortgage), so $22,000. Cash is $5,000. So total is $27,000. But then, there's a partnership liability of $20,000. Wait, so is that a liability that reduces the basis? Or a liability that's part of the partnership's liabilities, which are to be shared according to partnership interests.

Wait, the partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities, which are to be shared. So the liability is a liability, not an adjustment to the basis. Oh no, wait. I think the partnership's basis is the sum of the contributions (cash and land) minus any liabilities. So the total contributions are $5,000 + $22,000 (land's basis after mortgage) = $27,000. Then, subtract the partnership's assumed liabilities. The partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage, so $27,000 - $10,000 = $17,000. Wait, but then what about the $20,000 in recourse liabilities? Are those part of the partnership's liabilities that are not part of their ownership?

Wait, I think that the $20,000 is a liability that the partnership has; it's not part of the contributed property. So the partnership's basis is the sum of the contributed property (adjusted basis) plus contributions, minus any liabilities. But wait, the basis is calculated based on contributed property plus contributions, minus any liabilities. Or is the liability part of the partnership's total liability, which is separate from the basis?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. The total contributed property is $5,000 cash + $22,000 (land's adjusted basis). So $27,000.

2. Subtract the partnership's assumed liabilities. The partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage. So 27,000 - 10,000 = 17,000.

But wait, I thought the basis is adjusted by the partnership's liabilities, so the basis is 27,000, then subtract 10,000, so 17,000. But one of the options is $17,000 (Option A). But wait, the correct option isn't A, because the other options include other numbers. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options: A is $17,000. So if that's the case, the answer is A. But I'm not sure because I might have missed something.

Wait another point: Skinner contributed land with a basis of $12,000. But the partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage on that land, so the basis of the land in the partnership becomes $12,000 + $10,000 = $22,000. So the basis from the land is $22,000. The cash is $5,000. So total basis is 22,000 +5,000 =27,000. Then, the partnership's liabilities of $20,000 are part of the partnership's liabilities, not the basis. So the basis is 27,000 minus 10,000 (the assumed mortgage) =17,000. So option A.

Wait, but the correct answer is one of the options. Looking back at the options, option A is $17,000. So that's the answer.

To determine Skinner’s basis in the partnership interest, we analyze the contributions and adjustments step by step:

1. **Contributions**:
   - **Cash**: Skinner contributed $5,000 cash.
   - **Land**: Skinner contributed land with a basis of $12,000 and a fair market value (FMV) of $20,000. The partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage on the land, which reduces the basis of the land in the partnership. Thus, the adjusted basis of the land in the partnership is $12,000 + $10,000 = $22,000.

2. **Total Contributions**:
   - The total adjusted basis from contributed property is $5,000 (cash) + $22,000 (land) = $27,000.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - The partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage on the land, which is an assumed liability. This reduces the basis of the contributed property. Therefore, the partnership’s basis in the land is adjusted downward by $10,000, resulting in $22,000 (land) + $5,000 (cash) = $27,000.

4. **Recourse Liabilities**:
   - The partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities that are to be shared according to their partnership interests. These liabilities are not part of the contributed property and thus do not directly affect the basis calculation. Therefore, the basis remains $27,000.

5. **Final Basis Calculation**:
   - After adjusting for the assumed mortgage, the partnership’s basis in the contributed property is $27,000 - $10,000 = $17,000.

Thus, Skinner’s basis in the partnership interest is **$17,000**.
