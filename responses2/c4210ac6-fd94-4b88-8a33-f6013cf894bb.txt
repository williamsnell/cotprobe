Question:

A state's constitution reserves to the people of each municipality in the state the power of referendum with respect to all questions that the municipality is authorized to control by legislation. A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a water park on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city's charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the commission rejected the developer's subsequent application for "recreational area" approval for the proposed water park on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. Assume that while the action was pending in the state court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum. Which would be the most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance?

Options:

A: The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment.
B: The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.
C: The referendum procedure is not applicable in this context as it is only for state-wide legislation.
D: The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
E: The referendum procedure is a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: The referendum procedure is valid only if it is not influenced by external factors.
G: The referendum procedure is unconstitutional as it infringes on the rights of property owners.
H: The referendum procedure is only applicable in cases of major legislative changes, not zoning changes.
I: The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against publicpolicy.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically regarding the applicability of a zoning ordinance's referendum procedure. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a real estate developer applying for a zoning change. The city's charter was amended to require a 55% vote in a referendum for changes. The city planning commission and council approved the zoning change, but the council rejected the developer's application on grounds that the zoning action wasn't submitted to a referendum. However, in a state court, the referendum was defeated. The question is about the applicable rule of constitutional law regarding the referendum procedure in this context.

First, I need to recall the key principles of constitutional law related to zoning ordinances, particularly regarding the referendum procedure.

I remember that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause deals with the right to a fair trial and due process. The Automated Marketplaces Act (AMCA) is relevant here because it deals with the regulation of real estate and zoning. The AMCA imposes restrictions on real estate development based on zoning laws and requires a referendum process for certain changes.

The situation here is that the city has an amendment in its charter requiring a 55% vote. The zoning plan proposal was approved by both the city planning commission and council, but the council specifically rejected because the zoning action wasn't submitted to a referendum. However, in the state court, the referendum was defeated. So what's the constitutional issue?

The key is whether the zoning regulation was properly subject to a referendum. If the city's current zoning acts require a referendum, then the developer's application would be a challenge to that regulation, which would be considered an adverse action under the due process clause. But wait, the city's own amendment required a referendum, so the zoning ordinance itself would have to be evaluated against the due process requirements.

Wait, the question is about the referendum procedure itself, not the zoning regulation's effect on the developer. So the question is about the applicability of the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance. The options are about whether the procedure is invalid because of constitutional violations.

Let me look at the options. Option E says the procedure is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. The Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause applies when the government's action is subject to a due process requirement. So if the zoning regulation is a regulation that's subject to a referendum, then the due process clause applies.

But wait, the city's own amendment required a referendum, but the zoning change was approved by the city council as part of the zoning plan. But the city's plan was submitted, and the council approved it, but the city council rejected the developer's application because it wasn't in a referendum. However, the city's current zoning laws require a referendum.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The city's own zoning changes (like the amendment in the charter) might be a question, but the zoning change that the developer is applying for is a new zoning regulation. So the application is before the city planning commission and council, but the amendment was done by the city council.

Wait, the city's own plan was amended, which was submitted to a referendum. So the city's zoning regulation (the amendment) is considered in the context of due process. However, the question is about the referendum procedure for the developer's application, which is a new zoning change.

But the city's own amendment required a referendum, so the city's zoning laws are subject to due process. But the developer is applying for a new zoning change, which might not necessarily be subject to a referendum. Or perhaps the question is about whether the city's proposed zoning change is properly subject to a referendum.

Wait, but the question is about the referendum procedure as applied to a rezoning ordinance. So if the city is enforcing a zoning regulation which requires a referendum, then the developer's application is a challenge to that regulation, which would involve due process.

Wait, but the city's own amendment (the one in the charter) requires a referendum, so that's a regulation that's subject to due process. But the developer's application is a new zoning regulation, which is a separate matter.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think about the structure. The city has an amendment to its charter that makes a zoning change require a 55% vote in a referendum. So for a zoning change, they're submitting the plan to a referendum. So that's a regulation that requires a referendum.

Now, the developer applies for a zoning change. His application is to a water park on his land. The city's plan was approved by the city council, but the council rejected the developer's application because his action wasn't submitted to a referendum. However, in the state court, the referendum was defeated. So the question is whether the city's zoning regulation is subject to a due process violation.

Wait, the point is whether the zoning regulation is properly subject to a referendum. If the city's zoning laws require a referendum, then any change would be subject to due process. But the developer's application is a challenge to the new zoning regulation.

Wait, but the city's own zoning regulation was modified in the charter (the amendment), which required a referendum. So the city has a regulation (the amendment) that is a zoning change requiring a referendum. The developer is challenging a new zoning change, which is a new regulation.

Wait, no. The city plan amendment was part of the city's own zoning laws, which now require a referendum. So it's a regulation that's subject to due process. The developer is applying for a new zoning change, which is a new regulation, so the question is about whether that new regulation is properly subject to a referendum.

Wait, but the question is about the referendum procedure as applied to a rezoning ordinance. So the issue is whether the city's zoning regulation (the one requiring a referendum) is properly subject to due process. But the developer's application is for a new regulation.

Wait, no. The question is about the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance. So the options are about the applicability of the procedure. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: the procedure is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. That suggests that because the zoning regulation is subject to a referendum, it's a due process violation, which would apply to the developer's application as well.

Wait, but the city's own amendment was amended to require a referendum, so the city's zoning laws are subject to due process. But the developer's application is a new zoning change, which is another matter. So perhaps the issue is whether the city's zoning regulation is properly subject to a referendum, thus violating due process.

But the question is about the referendum procedure's applicability when applied to a rezoning ordinance. So when the city is enforcing a zoning ordinance that requires a referendum, the due process applies. However, the city's own amendment (the one in the charter) was amended into law, meaning the city's zoning regulation now requires a referendum.

So the city's zoning regulation is now a regulation that requires a referendum. Therefore, any change to the city's zoning, including a rezoning, would be a challenge to that regulation. But the developer is challenging a new zoning change, not the city's own regulation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the applicability of the referendum procedure to a rezoning ordinance. So the city's zoning regulation (the one that requires a referendum) is a regulation that's subject to due process.

So when the city enforces a zoning regulation that requires a referendum, any challenge to that regulation would be a violation of due process. So if the city is enforcing a zoning regulation that requires a referendum, then the act of enforcing it violates due process, which is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

So the question is, does the city's zoning regulation require a referendum, thereby requiring the due process violation? But the city's own zoning regulation was amended, which required a referendum. So the city's zoning regulation is a regulation that's a violation of due process.

So the application for the new zoning change would be a challenge to that regulation. But the city is enforcing it under the due process, so the developer's application is a violation of due process.

Wait, but the question is about the referendum procedure's applicability, not the application itself. So when the city's zoning regulation requires a referendum, any change to that regulation is subject to due process. So the city's zoning regulation is a violation of due process, and therefore, any application for a zoning change that's a challenge to that would be a violation.

Wait, but the city's own amendment was amended to require a referendum, meaning that the city's zoning regulation now requires a referendum. So the city's zoning laws are a subject to due process. So when the city is enforcing a zoning regulation that requires a referendum, any application for a change is a violation of due process.

But the question is about the referendum procedure, not about the application. So the city's zoning regulation is a regulation that requires a referendum, so it's a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.

So the application for the new zoning change would be a violation of due process because the city's zoning regulation is a regulation that requires a referendum. Therefore, the correct answer would be E: the procedure is a violation of the equal protection clause.

Wait, but why is E correct? Because the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause applies when a government acts in a way that is subject to a due process requirement. So if the city is enforcing a zoning regulation that requires a referendum, then any change to that regulation is subject to due process. So the city's action is a violation, and so is any application for a change.

So the answer would be E: the procedure is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.

Alternatively, another approach: The Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause applies when a state government's action is subject to a due process requirement. Here, the city has an amendment to its zoning laws (the one requiring a referendum), so any change to that regulation is subject to due process. Therefore, the city's action is a violation of the equal protection clause.

So the referendum procedure (the requirement to have a 55% vote) is a violation of the equal protection clause because the zoning regulation is a regulation that's a violation of due process.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the city's zoning regulation, which requires a 55% vote in a referendum, is subject to a due process violation under the Fourteenth Amendment. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Issue**: The city's zoning regulation (the amendment in the city charter) requires a referendum, making it a regulation that is subject to due process. Any challenge to this regulation, including the developer's application, would violate due process.

2. **Application of Due Process**: The Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause applies when a government action is subject to due process. Since the city's zoning regulation now requires a referendum, any change to this regulation would be a violation of due process.

3. **Revolusion Question**: The question asks about the applicability of the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance. The referendum procedure is relevant to the city's zoning regulation, which is now a violation of due process.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **E**: Correct. The procedure is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause because the zoning regulation is a regulation requiring a referendum, a violation of due process.
   - Other options either involve erroneous constitutional principles or are not directly relevant to the application of the referendum procedure in this context.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.
