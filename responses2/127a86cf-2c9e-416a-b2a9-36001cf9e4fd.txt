Okay, let's see. So, the question is about Mr. and Mrs. Miller's house insurance. Hmm. They paid $32,700 for their house and land. The land is estimated to be worth $5,500. They want to insure the house at 80% of its estimated value. Wait, I need to find out how much insurance they should purchase.

Wait, the question says they want to insure the house at 80% of its estimated value. So, the estimated value of the house must be the total minus the land's value, right? Let me calculate that. So, total is $32,700, minus $5,500 for the land. That leaves $27,200 for the house. Now, they want to insure the house at 80% of that estimated value. So, 80% of $27,200. Let me calculate 80% of 27,200. 0.8 times 27,200 equals... 21,760. So, the insurance should be $21,760. Looking at the options, option B is $21,760. So, the answer should be B.

The insurance should cover 80% of the house's estimated value, which is $27,200. 80% of that is $21,760. So, the correct answer is **B: $21,760**.

Answer: B
