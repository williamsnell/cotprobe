Question:

John S. Knight, Detroit Free Press (3 July 1970): ...Capitalism is the economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately owned and operated for profit. The alternative system is called socialism, the theory of the ownership and operation of the means of production by society, with all members sharing in the work and the products.

Options:

A: Begging the Question
B: False Dilemma
C: Straw Man
D: Appeal to Gallery (Provicialism)

Okay, so I've got this question about John S. Knight's article on capitalism and socialism. Let me think through this. The question is about identifying a logical fallacy in the article's argument.

The first part says that capitalism is the system where the means of production and distribution are privately owned and operated for profit. Then it contrasts that with socialism, which is where all members share in the work and the products through society's ownership.

The options are Begging the Question, False Dilemma, Straw Man, and Appeal to Gallery (also known as Proitionalism). I need to figure out which one applies here.

Begging the question is when someone assumes that the conclusion is true to prove it, which isn't helpful in an argument. So that probably isn't the case here.

False Dilemma suggests that the two options are the only ones, but Knight is presenting them as alternatives, which would make sense if the question was about the debate between capitalism and socialism, but in this context, it's about how each is presented as mutually exclusive.

Straw Man is when someone distorts the issue to make a bad point. I don't think that's the case here because the article is clearly contrasting the two systems.

Then there's Appeal to Gallery, which is a type of argument where the speaker appeals to a gallery of possible solutions to make the case. In this case, Knight is presenting two options as the only possible solutions, so that fits.

The correct answer is C: Straw Man. 

The article presents capitalism and socialism as mutually exclusive options, which fits the structure of an Appeal to Gallery argument.
