Question:

Consider a tank used in certain hydrodynamic experiments. After one experiment the tank contains $200 \mathrm{~L}$ of a dye solution with a concentration of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$. To prepare for the next experiment, the tank is to be rinsed with fresh water flowing in at a rate of $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, the well-stirred solution flowing out at the same rate. Find the time that will elapse before the concentration of dye in the tank reaches $1 \%$ of its original value.

Options:

A:  460.5 min
B: 520 min
C: 690 min
D: 600 min
E: 385 min
F: 345 min
G: 300 min
H: 500 min
I: 550 min
J: 420 min

Okay, so I've got this problem about a tank with a dye solution, and I need to find out how long it takes for the concentration to drop to 1% of its original. Hmm, let's break it down.

Alright, the tank starts with 200 liters of 1 g/L dye solution. So the initial concentration is 1 g/L. The flow in and out are both 2 L/min. Oh wait, that means the volume inside the tank stays constant because the inflow equals outflow. So the concentration will change over time as water is added and mixed, and then removed.

I remember this is a classic mixing problem. The formula for concentration over time in such cases is exponential decay. The general formula is C(t) = C0 * e^(-kt), but wait, is that right? Or maybe it's C(t) = C0 * e^(-kt), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Let me think. 

The differential equation for this situation is dC/dt = (inflow rate) - (outflow rate) multiplied by the current concentration. Since the inflow and outflow rates are both 2 L/min, the net change is zero, but the concentration depends on how the dye is being mixed.

Wait, more accurately, the rate of change of concentration is the inflow concentration minus the outflow concentration. The inflow is fresh water, so 0 g/L, and the outflow is the current solution, which is C(t) g/L.

So the rate of change of concentration is dC/dt = 0 - (2 L/min) * C(t) / (volume). Wait, because the outflow is 2 L/min, and the concentration is C(t) g/L, so the mass flow out is 2 * C(t) g/min.

The volume of the solution is constant because the inflow equals outflow. So the volume is 200 L throughout. So the concentration is C(t) = (initial mass) / (volume).

Initial mass is 200 L * 1 g/L = 200 g. So the concentration is 200 / V, but wait, V is 200 L, so 200 g / 200 L = 1 g/L. Yeah, that's correct.

So the rate of change dC/dt is equal to the mass flow in minus mass flow out. Since inflow is 0, and outflow is 2 * C(t). So dC/dt = -(2 L/min) * C(t) / (200 L) ) → which simplifies to dC/dt = - (2/200) * C(t) = - (1/100) C(t). So the differential equation is dC/dt = - (1/100) C(t).

This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, and its solution is C(t) = C0 * e^(-kt), where k is the rate constant. In this case, k is 1/100 per minute.

We want to find the time when C(t) is 1% of the original concentration. Original concentration is 1 g/L, so 1% is 0.01 g/L.

So set up the equation: 0.01 = 1 * e^(- (1/100) t )

Taking ln on both sides: ln(0.01) = - (1/100) t.

ln(0.01) is approximately -4.605. So:

-4.605 = - (1/100) t → 4.605 = t / 100 → t = 4.605 * 100 → t ≈ 460.5 minutes.

Looking at the options, option A is 460.5 min. So the answer should be A.

The problem involves a tank with 200 L of 1 g/L dye solution, with fresh water flowing in and out at 2 L/min. The goal is to find the time when the dye concentration drops to 1% of its original value (0.01 g/L). This is a classic mixing problem with an exponential decay solution.

The differential equation for the concentration is:

\[
\frac{dC}{dt} = -\frac{2}{200} C(t) = -\frac{1}{100} C(t)
\]

The solution to this equation is:

\[
C(t) = C_0 e^{-\frac{1}{100} t}
\]

Given \( C_0 = 1 \, \text{g/L} \), we set \( C(t) = 0.01 \, \text{g/L} \):

\[
0.01 = e^{-\frac{1}{100} t}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.01) = -\frac{1}{100} t
\]

\[
\ln(0.01) \approx -4.605 = -\frac{1}{100} t
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = 4.605 \times 100 = 460.5 \, \text{minutes}
\]

The closest option is A: 460.5 min.
