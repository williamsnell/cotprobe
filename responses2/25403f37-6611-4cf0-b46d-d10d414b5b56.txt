Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this accounting question. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, Markson Co. traded a concrete-mixing truck to Pro Co. The truck had a book value of $10,000, and Pro Co. paid $11,000 for the cement-mixing machine. I need to determine which question Markson Co. must answer to know if the exchange has commercial substance.

Hmm, commercial substance means that the exchange isn't just a transfer of ownership but also changes the financial position of the company. So, for that, I think we need to consider the differences in the asset's fair values and the impact on the company's net income.

The key here is the concept of "change in fair value." If the exchange doesn't change the fair value of the assets involved, it's not commercial. So, when Markson traded the truck for the machine, the truck's book value was $10k, and the machine's fair value is $11k. The difference here is $1k. So, an increase in fair value would affect the company's financial statements.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one relates to whether the exchange's commercial substance is determined. The question asks which question Markson Co. must answer. So the correct answer is the question that tells whether the exchange affects the company's assets in a way that changes their fair values.

Option B: Is there a significant difference between the book value and fair value of the assets exchanged? That makes sense because if there's a significant difference, the exchange has commercial substance.

Another thing to think about: commercial substance requires that the exchange results in a change in the company's financial position, which is indicated by a change in the fair value of assets. So, the difference in their values (10k vs 11k) is significant, leading to a change in financials.

Options like E and F also relate to the impact on future cash flows. But the main factor is whether the exchange affects the fair value of the assets. So, option B is the right answer.

To determine if the exchange has commercial substance, Markson Co. needs to assess whether there's a significant difference between the book value and fair value of the assets exchanged.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Commercial Substance**: An exchange has commercial substance if it changes the financial position of the company, typically by altering the fair value of assets.
2. **Key Factors**: The difference between the book value of the asset given up and its fair value received is crucial. A significant difference indicates a change in fair value, which is indicative of commercial substance.
3. **Analysis of Options**: Option B directly addresses the significant difference between the book and fair values, which is essential for determining commercial substance.

**Answer: B**
