Okay, so I've got this graph theory problem. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The graph G has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. The edges are given as {<0,3>, <1,3>, <2,3>}. So, each of these edges connects node 0 to 3, node 1 to 3, and node 2 to 3. So, node 3 is connected to all other nodes. 

The question is asking for the minimum vertex cover. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. And a minimum vertex cover is the smallest such set possible.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I should visualize the graph. It's a star-shaped graph with node 3 at the center and nodes 0, 1, 2 connected directly to it.

So, the edges are:

0-3, 1-3, 2-3.

Each of these edges must have at least one of the connected nodes in the vertex cover.

So, the task is to choose the smallest number of nodes such that all these edges are covered.

Let's list the possible options for the minimum vertex cover.

Option A: [1,2,3]. That would include nodes 1,2,3. But wait, node 3 is included. So, that covers all edges because 3 is connected to 0,1,2. So, node 3 alone is enough. But wait, is that correct? Because node 3 alone is connected to all three nodes. So, if we choose 3, then all edges are covered. So, the vertex cover can be just {3}.

But wait, let me think again. Because the vertex cover needs to include at least one end of each edge. So, for each edge, at least one of the two endpoints is in the cover. So, for the edges 0-3: either 0 or 3 is in the cover. Similarly, for 1-3: either 1 or 3 is in the cover. And for 2-3: either 2 or 3 is in the cover.

So, the vertex cover must include at least one of 0 or 3, one of 1 or 3, and one of 2 or 3.

So, if I choose 3, then all edges are covered. Because 3 is in the cover, so each edge has at least one node in the cover.

Wait, but that's the minimum possible, right? Because if I just choose 3, then all edges are covered. So, the minimum vertex cover is of size 1, just {3}.

But looking at the options given, option F is [3], which is one of the options. But wait, looking back at the options: F is [3], which is a single node. So, that's the minimum possible.

Wait, but the options are A to J. Let me check.

Option A: [1,2,3] → size 3. But since we have a smaller vertex cover possible, F is better.

Option B: [0,1,2,3] → size 4. That's definitely not minimal.

Option C: [0,1] → size 2. Let me see if that's a valid vertex cover. So, do both 0 and 1 cover all edges? Edge 0-3: 0 is in the cover → yes. Edge 1-3: 1 is in the cover → yes. Edge 2-3: 2 is not in the cover, so 3 is the only one. So, since 3 is not in the vertex cover, this doesn't cover the edge 2-3. Thus, [0,1] is not a vertex cover. So option C is invalid.

Option D: [0, 2, 3] → size 3. Let's see: 0 covers 0-3 and 0 is in the cover. 2 covers 2-3 and 3 is in the cover. 3 covers 2-3. So, all edges are covered. But the size is 3, which is larger than F's size of 1. So, F is better.

Option E: [2,3] → size 2. Let's check. 2 covers 2-3 and 3 covers 2-3. 0-3: 3 is in the cover. 1-3: 3 is in the cover. So yes, all edges are covered. So, [2,3] is a valid vertex cover with size 2. But again, F is better because it's size 1.

Option G: [1,2] → size 2. Let's see: 1 covers 1-3 and 3 covers 1-3. 2 covers 2-3 and 3 covers 2-3. So, yes, all edges are covered. So, [1,2] is a vertex cover, size 2, but F is better.

Option I: [0,1,2] → size 3. This would cover all edges because each edge has 0,1, or 2 or 3. But F is better.

Option J: [0,3] → size 2. Check: 0 covers 0-3 and 3 covers 2-3. So, yes, that's a vertex cover. So, [0,3] is a valid cover with size 2.

So, the options C, D, E, G, I, J are all vertex covers, but with sizes of 2 or more. F is the smallest, size 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. The question says 'the minimum vertex cover'. So, according to the options, F is [3], which is a vertex cover of size 1. So the correct answer should be F.

But wait, wait another thing. Is the vertex cover allowed to have just 3? Because in the graph, node 3 is connected to all others. So, selecting only 3 would cover all edges because each edge has 3 as one end. So yes, [3] is a vertex cover.

So the minimum vertex cover is [3], which is the option F.

But wait, the options given include F as [3], but in the initial problem statement, the options are A to H and I, J. Let me recheck the options.

The options are:

A: [1,2,3] → 3 nodes.

B: [0,1,2,3] → 4.

C: [0,1] → 2 nodes.

D: [0,2,3] → 3.

E: [2,3] → 2.

F: [3] → 1.

G: [1,2] → 2.

H: [0,1,3] → 3.

I: [0,1,2] → 3.

J: [0,3] → 2.

So the correct minimal vertex cover is [3], which is option F.

Wait, but why are other options presented? Because sometimes, graph theory problems have specific conditions. But in this case, the graph is a star with node 3 connected to all others. So, the minimal vertex cover is indeed just [3], as selecting 3 covers all edges. So, the answer is F.

The minimal vertex cover of a star-shaped graph with node 3 connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2 is simply {3}, as it covers all edges. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: F
