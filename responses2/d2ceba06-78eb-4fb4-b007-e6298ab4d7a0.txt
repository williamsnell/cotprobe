Okay, so I have this question about rings and whether the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. Hmm, I need to figure out for which of the given rings this is possible. Let me think through each option.

Starting with option A: The ring of complex numbers with rational coefficients. Wait, that's Q(i), which are complex numbers where both the real and imaginary parts are rational. I remember that Q(i) is a field, so in a field, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. So if a and b are non-zero in this ring, then ab can't be zero. So A probably isn't the answer.

Option B: Integers modulo 11. That's Z/11Z. Since 11 is prime, this is a field as well. So again, in a field, zero divisors don't exist. So B is out.

Option C: Continuous real-valued functions on [0,1]. Hmm, this is C([0,1]), the ring of continuous functions. I think this is a ring where the product of two non-zero functions can be zero only if both are zero functions. Because if f and g are continuous and their product f(x)g(x) is zero everywhere, then for every x, either f(x) is zero or g(x) is zero. But since they're continuous, the zero set can't be the whole interval unless one of them is identically zero. So C is not the correct ring.

Option D: Rational numbers. That's Q. Similar to the complex case, Q is a field. So again, no non-zero elements multiply to zero. So D is out.

Option E: Complex numbers. That's C, the complex numbers. Wait, this is a field because C is algebraically closed. So again, no zero divisors. So E is not the answer.

Option F: Integers modulo 7. That's Z/7Z. 7 is prime, so it's a field. So no zero divisors here either. So F is not it.

Option G: Ring {a + b*sqrt(3) : a,b rational}. Let's call this ring R. Is this a field? Because if it's a field, then it won't have zero divisors. Let me think. For any element r in R, if it's non-zero, there exists an inverse. Let me take r = a + b*sqrt(3). Then the inverse would be (a - b*sqrt(3))/(a^2 - 3b^2), provided a^2 ≠ 3b^2. If a^2 = 3b^2, then a = b = 0, which is only r=0. So R is a field, so no zero divisors. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: Ring {a + b*sqrt(2) : a,b rational}. Let's call this ring S. Similar to G, let's check if it's a field. Take an element s = a + b*sqrt(2). Its inverse would be (a - b*sqrt(2))/(a^2 - 2b^2), which exists as long as a^2 ≠ 2b^2. But if a^2 = 2b^2, then a and b can be scaled appropriately. For example, if a = sqrt(2)*b, then that would be in the ring. But wait, wait. Let's think: can we always find an inverse for every non-zero element? Let me take a simple case, say a = 1, b = 1. Then the inverse would be (1 - sqrt(2))/(1 - 2) = (1 - sqrt(2))/(-1) = sqrt(2) - 1. So that works. What about a = 0? Then s = b*sqrt(2). Its inverse would be 1/(b*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2)/(2b^2), which is also in the ring since sqrt(2) is in S. So S is a field; hence, no zero divisors. So H can't be the answer.

Option I: Integers modulo 9. That's Z/9Z. 9 is not a prime, it's composite. So Z/9Z is not a field. It's a ring where zero divisors exist. Because 3 * 3 = 9 ≡ 0 mod 9. So in Z/9Z, 3 is a zero divisor because (3)(3)=0. So in this ring, the product of two non-zero elements can be zero. So I is a candidate.

Wait a second. Let me double-check. Are there any other rings in the options that might also be possible? Let me go back through them. Are there any other rings that aren't fields but have zero divisors?

Wait, option G and H are both about rings with sqrt(3) and sqrt(2), which are irrational. They are fields, so they don't have zero divisors. Option I is Z/9Z, which is composite and hence has zero divisors. So I is the only one left that fits.

Wait, but what about option C, the continuous functions? No, as I thought before, C is a field because it's a division ring, so any two non-zero functions can't multiply to zero everywhere. So no, that's not it.

So the correct answer should be I: The ring of integers modulo 9.

The correct answer is I: The ring of integers modulo 9. This ring is Z/9Z, which is not a field because 9 is composite, allowing zero divisors like 3 and 3, where 3*3 = 9 ≡ 0 mod 9. Thus, the product of two non-zero elements can be zero.
