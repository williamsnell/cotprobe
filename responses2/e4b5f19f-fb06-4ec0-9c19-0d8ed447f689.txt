Okay, so I have this freezing point problem about toluene and a solute. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that the freezing point constant of toluene is 3.33°C per mole per 1000 grams. Wait, I remember the formula for freezing point depression is ΔT = Kf * m, where m is the molality of the solution. Oh right, freezing point depression is caused by solute particles, so it lowers the freezing point.

So, the given data is: 0.4 moles of solute are dissolved in 500 grams of toluene. The freezing point of pure toluene is -95.0°C. They're asking for the new freezing point.

First, I need to calculate the molality (m) of the solution. Molality is moles of solute divided by kilograms of solvent. The solvent here is toluene, which is 500 grams. So, I convert that to kilograms: 500g is 0.5 kg.

Molality m = moles of solute / kg of solvent = 0.4 mol / 0.5 kg = 0.8 mol/kg.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, 0.4 moles divided by 0.5 kg is 0.8. So m is 0.8 mol/kg.

Now, the formula for freezing point depression is ΔT = Kf * m. The Kf given is 3.33°C/(mol/kg). So, substituting the numbers: ΔT = 3.33 * 0.8.

Let me compute that. 3.33 * 0.8 is 2.664. So the freezing point drops by 2.664°C.

Wait, but wait, the freezing point of pure toluene is -95.0. So the new freezing point is -95 + (-2.664) = -97.664°C. Hmm, but wait, no. Because freezing point depression is a decrease in freezing point. So if the pure freezing point is -95, a solution would have a lower (more negative) freezing point, which is a decrease. Oh wait, no. Wait, freezing point depression is how much the freezing point lowers. So the freezing point of the solution is the freezing point of pure solvent minus the ΔT.

Wait, pure T is -95. So, the solution's freezing point is -95 - 2.664 = -97.664°C. So the freezing point is -97.664°C, which is option E, which is -97.66°C.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A to J. Let me look back.

Options:

A: -92.34

B: -89.66

C: -88.0

D: -90.0

E: -97.66

F: -100.0

G: -93.0

H: -98.34

I: -94.0

J: -96.0

So the correct answer is E: -97.66°C.

Wait, but wait. Did I compute the molality correctly? 0.4 mol in 0.5 kg is 0.8 mol/kg, yes. Kf is 3.33. Multiply 0.8 by 3.33: let's compute that again.

3.33 * 0.8. 3 * 0.8 is 2.4. 0.33 *0.8 is 0.264. So sum is 2.664. So ΔT is 2.664, so freezing point is -95 - 2.664 = -97.664. Rounded to two decimal places, -97.66°C, which is option E. Hence, the answer is E.

To calculate the freezing point of the solution, we use the formula for freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T = K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \( \Delta T \) is the freezing point depression,
- \( K_f \) is the freezing point depression constant (3.33°C/mol/kg for toluene),
- \( m \) is the molality of the solution.

### Step 1: Calculate molality (\( m \))
The molality is given by:

\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}}
\]

The solute is 0.4 moles, and the solvent (toluene) is 500 g, which is 0.5 kg. Substituting the values:

\[
m = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \, \text{mol/kg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate freezing point depression (\( \Delta T \))
Using the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T = 3.33 \cdot 0.8 = 2.664 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the freezing point of the solution
The freezing point of pure toluene is -95.0°C. Since freezing point depression lowers the freezing point, the freezing point of the solution is:

\[
\text{Freezing point of solution} = -95.0 - 2.664 = -97.664 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated freezing point of the solution is -97.66°C, which corresponds to option E.
