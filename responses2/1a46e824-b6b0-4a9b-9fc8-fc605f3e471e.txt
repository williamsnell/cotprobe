Question:

One computer in a lab is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every five minutes. Another computer is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every two minutes. Find the number of times in twenty-four hours that the two computers back up data at the same time. (Assume that the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period.)

Options:

A: 144
B: 240
C: 36
D: 180
E: 72
F: 12
G: 6
H: 60
I: 120
J: 48

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about two computer backup systems. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about two computers backing up data at different intervals. One backs up every five minutes, and the other every two minutes. We need to find out how many times in a 24-hour period they both back up data at the same time, assuming they don't start backing up at the very beginning.

Hmm, so the first computer (Computer A) is backing up every 5 minutes. The second (Computer B) every 2 minutes. I think this is a problem about finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. Because LCM gives the smallest time interval at which both events coincide.

Let me calculate the LCM of 5 and 2. Well, 5 is a prime number, and 2 is also prime. So their LCM is 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. That means every 10 minutes, both computers will back up at the same time.

Now, the total time period is 24 hours. I need to convert that into minutes to match the units. 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes.

So, the computers will align every 10 minutes. To find how many times this happens, I can divide the total minutes by the LCM. So 1440 divided by 10 is 144. But wait, we have to consider if the 24-hour period includes the start time. The problem says they don't back up at the start, so we don't count the initial moment. But since the first alignment is at the 10th minute, which is within the 24-hour period, the total number of alignments would be 144.

Looking at the options, option A is 144. So the answer should be A.

The answer is A: 144.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Intervals:**
   - Computer A backs up every 5 minutes.
   - Computer B backs up every 2 minutes.

2. **Determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - LCM of 5 and 2 is 10 minutes. This means both computers align backing up every 10 minutes.

3. **Calculate Total Alignments in 24 Hours:**
   - 24 hours = 1440 minutes.
   - Alignments occur at 10, 20, 30, ..., up to 1440 minutes.
   - Number of alignments = 1440 / 10 = 144.

**Answer:** A: 144
