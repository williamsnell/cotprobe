Okay, so I've got this question about Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I remember that this model is about how leaders interact with their subordinates. The question is asking about the type of leadership style a leader should use when dealing with subordinates who have certain characteristics—specifically, their ability and motivation.

Let me think. Hersey and Blanchard's model usually focuses on the leader's role in a group, especially in terms of communication and support. So the model probably evaluates how the leader handles different types of subordinates.

The options are about the subordinates' ability and motivation. The question is asking which characteristics make the leader's style "participative." That probably means the leader is encouraging and accepting of the subordinates' contributions.

Wait, I think in their model, if a subordinate has high ability, that wouldn't be right, because the leader would need to support them, not over compound. So the leader should use participative style when the subordinate is low in ability, right? Because otherwise, the leader might be pushing for their own dominance without support.

As for motivation, if a subordinate has high motivation, the leader should also be supportive. So the leadership style should encourage the subordinates, not suppress their performance. So the leadership should be participative even if motivation is high.

Looking at the options, option F is high ability and low motivation. That would mean the leader uses a participative style when the subordinate is good at their job but not motivated. But wait, does F fit the criteria? Or is it the opposite, where the subordinate is low ability but high motivation, leading to a participative approach?

Wait, I think the model suggests that the leader should support those who are low ability to avoid power struggles, and also support those with high motivation because they drive the group. So the participative style is used when the subordinate is low in both ability and motivation. Or maybe when the subordinate is low in ability but high in motivation, the leader still uses participative because they support the ability—maybe because their job is good, but not necessarily that their motivation is high.

No, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. Hersey and Blanchard's model in situational leadership might outline that the leader should use a participative style when both the subordinate's ability and motivation are low. Or perhaps the opposite: low ability but high motivation. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the model suggests that the leader should use a participative style when the subordinate is low in ability because that's where the leader can offer support. High ability might not require that, but high motivation might require it. So perhaps the correct option is F: high ability and low motivation. Wait no, because the question is about subordinates who have certain characteristics, and the leader's style is participative in that context.

Wait, the question says, the leader should use a "participative" style for subordinates who have: so the options are about the characteristics of the subordinates, not the leader. So the correct option is the one that describes the subordinates' characteristics that require a participative style. So the correct scenario would be where the leader uses participative leadership when the subordinate has low ability. Because if a subordinate is low in ability, the leader can support them without being too supportive, perhaps, but maybe the question is about when the leadership style is participative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the model says that when a subordinate is low in ability AND low in motivation, the leader uses participative. Or maybe high ability and low motivation. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model divides leadership into two main types: participative and directive. Participative leadership is more supportive, while directive is more about order and authority. But the specifics about the characteristics—ability and motivation—probably refer to the subordinate's characteristics.

I think the model states that a leader should use a participative style when the subordinate has low ability. Because if the subordinate is low in ability, the leader can support them without overstepping. High ability subordinates might be handled more directive, but high motivation might require more support.

No, wait, maybe in their model, the leadership style depends on both ability and motivation. So if the subordinate has low ability and high motivation, the leader would use participative leadership because the subordinate can contribute and drive the group. If the subordinate has low ability and low motivation, the leader might use directive leadership because the subordinate isn't motivated to contribute.

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of the options again. The question is which option describes subordinates that the leader should use a participative style with. So the correct option would be when the subordinates have certain characteristics.

Looking at the options:

A: high ability and high motivation. So the leader would likely use directive, not participative, because the subordinates are high in both.

B: low ability and high motivation. So high motivation would require support, low ability may not require support. So the leader would use participative because the subordinate can contribute and drive the group.

Wait, but does the model say that? Or is it that when a subordinate has low ability, regardless of motivation, the leader uses participative. Or does it require both to be low?

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. But the question is about what the leader should use a participative style for. So perhaps the correct scenario is when the subordinates are low in ability but high in motivation. So the answer would be B. Or maybe when the subordinates are low in both, then F. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach is to recall that in situational leadership, the model states that in high-stress situations, a leader should use a participative style when the subordinate's role is low. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct answer is F: high ability and low motivation. Because perhaps the leader would support the subordinate's ability. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the model might suggest that the leader uses participative when the subordinate is low in ability or low in motivation.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F. Let me think: the question is, the leader uses a participative style for subordinates who have certain characteristics. The options are:

F: high ability and low motivation.

So, the leader uses participative when the subordinates are high in ability and low in motivation. So that would mean the leader is supportive of their ability and less supportive of motivation. So the leadership style would be more supportive.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the model suggests that when a subordinate has low ability AND high motivation, the leader should use participative leadership because the subordinate can contribute, and the leader doesn't want to overstep. So the correct option would be B: low ability and high motivation.

Alternatively, I remember that in some models, low ability and high motivation would lead to participative leadership, as the leader can support the subordinates' performance despite their high motivation. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Another approach: look for what the model says. Hersey and Blanchard's situational leadership model divides leadership into two types: participative and directive. Participative is more supportive and collaborative, while directive is more formal and authoritative.

In their model, the leadership style depends on the subordinate's ability and motivation. If the subordinate is low in ability, the leader uses participative leadership because it's about support and collaboration. High ability might be handled more directive. Similarly, high motivation might be supported more, but low ability is handled more in a participative way.

So for a subordinate who has low ability and high motivation, the leader would use participative leadership because the subordinate can contribute, and the leader doesn't want to overstep or overcompensate. So the correct option would be B: low ability and high motivation.

Alternatively, the model might state that low ability AND low motivation would lead to participative leadership. Or perhaps only when the subordinate's ability is low.

Wait, another thought. The model states that the leader should use a participative style when the subordinate has low ability and high motivation. So the correct answer would be B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not sure. I think I need to make a decision here.

Given that the question is about the characteristics leading to a participative style, the correct option would be when the subordinate has low ability and high motivation, so the answer is B: low ability and high motivation.
</think>

The question asks which characteristics of subordinates would require a participative leadership style according to Hersey and Blanchard’s situational leadership model. The model suggests that the leader uses participative leadership when the subordinate has low ability and high motivation. This is because the leader can support the subordinate's contributions while maintaining a level of collaboration, avoiding overstepping.
