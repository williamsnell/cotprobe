The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.
—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Thomas Paine and the Enlightenment. The question is about which characteristic his ideas best illustrate. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that the Enlightenment period was marked by a lot of individualism and critical thinking. People like Paine were known for their free thinking and their ability to articulate ideas clearly. They didn't settle for organized religions; they supported their own beliefs and others' as long as they made sense.

Looking at the question, the options are A to J. I need to pick which one best describes Paine's ideas. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Many promoted individual belief systems over organized religions. That's true. Paine wasn't just for organized churches. He wrote about his own beliefs and others' as long as they were understood. So this seems correct.

Option B: Focused on accumulating power and profit. Paine was more about freedom and understanding. He didn't use religious institutions to gain power but rather used them for education and personal growth. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Against equality. Paine did believe in equality, but he didn't endorse other religions or ideas. So C might not apply.

Option D: Communication methods like salons and pamphlets. Paine did write about these, so D could be correct.

Option E: Strong belief in one religion. No, Paine didn't think one religion was superior; he believed in his own and others' as long as they made sense. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Sci. discoveries solving all problems. Paine talked about the need for science but didn't believe in universal solutions. So F is wrong.

Option G: Scientific discoveries irrelevant. No, he believed they were relevant to progress. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Reject religion. Paine didn't reject religion; he believed in his own and others' as long as they were compatible. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Acquainted with science. He did write about science and Europe. So I might be correct.

Option J: Maintain traditional institutions. Paine didn't support rigid traditions but opposed them by advocating for change. So J is incorrect.

So the options that seem correct are A and D. The question is which one Paine best illustrates.

Looking back at his text. He mentions "I believe in the equality of man" and "I believe religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy." These are about belief in equality and the duties of religion, not communication methods. So he didn't focus on accumulating power (D) or promoting individual belief (A). He did advocate for his own beliefs and others' as long as they were reasonable, so A might be better.

Wait, but he did write about communication methods. So D is also correct. Let me re-examine the text.

In the pamphlet, Paine discusses the abolition of the national order of priesthood, which is about religion, and he talks about how this would make work necessary. So he does talk about communication methods (pamphlet mentions salons, so D is correct).

But does he promote individual belief systems over organized ones? Yes, in the last part of the pamphlet, he says, "I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy." So he doesn't advocate for one religion over another, but supports his own and others' as long as they're reasonable.

So between A and D. The question is about what his ideas best illustrate. The question is about the characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals, and Paine's ideas are best described by which characteristic.

Option A says many promoted individual belief systems. That's true, as he didn't follow organized religions but supported his own and others'. So A is correct.

Option D is about communication methods, which he did use. So D is also correct.

Wait, but the question is about which best illustrates. So both A and D seem correct. But looking at the options, maybe the answer is D. Let me think.

The options are a bit tricky. The question is which characteristic his ideas best illustrate.

The last part of the pamphlet talks about the abolition of the national order, which is about religion. So he's critical of organized religions. So perhaps that's more about the structure of religious institutions rather than communication methods.

Another option is that he didn't accept organized religion, which relates to A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because he did advocate for his own system and others' as long as they were reasonable, which relates to communication methods.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option A: Many promoted the idea of individual belief systems over organized religions. That's correct as per the last paragraph.

Option D: They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive pamphlets. Paine did use salons and pamphlets, so D is also correct.

But the question is about what his ideas best illustrate. So perhaps both A and D are correct. But the options are singular, so which is more accurate?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because he's known for his use of communication methods, whereas A is about belief systems.

Looking online, I recall that in the Enlightenment, individuals supported their own beliefs, not necessarily promoting individualism. So maybe A is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the ideas best illustrating which characteristic. Let's think about what Paine's views are about. He doesn't promote individual belief systems (A is not his main focus), but rather he supports his own beliefs and others' as long as they're reasonable. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, looking for another angle, perhaps the question refers to the use of the ideas, such as the belief in individualism over organized religion.

So the answer is either A or D, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the options again.

The question asks which characteristic his ideas best illustrate. The answer choices are:

A: Many promoted the idea of individual belief systems over organized religions.

D: They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive pamphlets.

Paine's work is known for his critical thinking and free inquiry. He didn't restrict himself to one religion. He wrote about his own beliefs and others' as long as they were reasonable, which relates to A. However, he did write about communication methods, so D is also correct.

Wait, but the question is about the characteristics, not the methods. So D is about the methods of communication, and A is about belief systems.

But the question is about what his ideas best illustrate. So both A and D are correct, but looking for the most accurate choice.

Wait, another way to think: the pamphlet talks about the abolition of the national order, which is a political issue. So perhaps he didn't just focus on religion, but also on political aspects. But that doesn't directly tie to the options.

Another point: the pamphlet also mentions that he doesn't believe in the "creed" of the Jewish Church, Roman, etc. So his approach was critical of organized religions, which might make A correct.

On the other hand, he did use communication methods, so D is another correct statement.

But the question asks which best illustrates. So both A and D are correct. But in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the original question. The options are about characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals, and Paine's ideas are best expressed in which of these.

Option A: Individual belief systems over organized ones. That's a big point he made.

Option D: Utilized new methods, like salons and pamphlets. That's something he did, so it's correct.

So the question is, which one best illustrates. Both A and D are correct, but the options are singular, so perhaps the intended answer is D, as he is known for his methodological freedom.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another way: perhaps the answer the question is looking for is D, because he's known for his use of communication methods, but also promoting his own beliefs. But the question is about the characteristics of his ideas, not his methods.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A, because he didn't support organized religion but did believe in his own and others' as long as they were reasonable. So A is correct.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Given that the options are A and D, and the question is about the features of his ideas, which is more central.

I think the correct answer is A: Many promoted the idea of individual belief systems over organized religions. Because in the last part, he does discuss this. So that's the most accurate.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again. The question is, which of the following best illustrates the characteristics.

Paine's pamphlet is known for his critical thinking and free thought. He did not support organized religions but did believe in his own and others' as long as they were reasonable. So that's about individual belief systems over organized ones.

But he also did use communication methods, so that's another point.

Wait, but the question is about the ideas he expresses, not his methods. So I think A is the correct answer because it's about belief systems.

So I think the correct answer is A.
</think>

The question asks which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals best illustrates the ideas expressed in Thomas Paine's pamphlet. Paine's ideas emphasize individual belief systems over organized religions, as he advocates for his own beliefs and others' as long as they were reasonable. While he also utilized communication methods, the question focuses on the nature of his beliefs, making A the most accurate choice.

ANSWER: A
