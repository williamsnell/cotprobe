Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about behavioral therapy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking what behavioral therapy typically does. The options are A through I, and the last character of the answer should be the letter chosen.

I remember that behavioral therapy focuses on helping clients change their behavior through various techniques. It's more about altering patterns of responding rather than just changing their behavior by some external method like medication or advertising.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Influencing patients by controlling the consequences of their actions. Hmm, behavioral therapy doesn't involve influencing. It's more about guiding behavior through techniques rather than changing what the client does.

Option B: Encouraging clients to focus on their dreams and unconscious mind. I'm not too sure about this. I think some therapies focus on the unconscious, but behavioral therapy is more about techniques and patterns rather than focusing on unconscious aspects through talking or meditating.

Option C: Promoting insight into thoughts and feelings. Insight is more psychological, like in therapeutic interpretations or through personal development. Behavioral therapy is about behavioral changes, not insight.

Option D: Administering medication. That's more about medical treatment, not therapy. It's a form of therapy, but it's not what behavioral therapy is about.

Option E: Assisting in developing a positive self-image. That's part of self-help or therapeutic interventions, but behavioral therapy is more about behavior change than self-perception.

Option F: Challenging illogical thinking. I think behavioral therapy uses techniques that challenge illogical thinking. For example, cognitive restructuring techniques where the client is guided to change negative thoughts. This makes sense, as it's about altering thoughts rather than changing behavior.

Option G: Supporting spiritual beliefs. While some therapies focus on spirituality, behavioral therapy is typically about behavioral changes, not spiritual beliefs.

Option H: Repeating what the client says. That's more about rephrasing, not changing behavior.

Option I: Encouraging talking about past experiences. That's part of cognitive-behavioral techniques, which is part of behavioral therapy. It's about exploring and discussing past issues to change behavior.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I says encouraging talking about past experiences. That sounds like a method used in behavioral therapy, part of cognitive restructuring.

So the question is asking which statement describes what behavioral therapy does. The options are about what it does. So Behavioral therapy is about influencing the consequences of actions, promoting insight into thoughts, supporting spiritual beliefs, etc. Or does it involve talking about past experiences as part of the process.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Behavioral therapy, as I understand it, uses techniques to change behavior. It doesn't directly influence the consequences (option A) because that's more about a therapeutic influence. Instead, it's about manipulating the client's thoughts, patterns, and behaviors through techniques like cognitive restructuring, reward systems, and systematic desensitization.

Looking at the options again:

Option F says "volitively challenging clients' illogical ways of thinking." That sounds like a way in behavioral therapy to get the client to think more logically or change their thoughts. So this is part of behavioral therapy's approach.

Option I says "encouraging clients to talk about their past experiences and traumas." That's part of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a subset of behavioral therapy. So in CBT, clients are encouraged to talk about their pasts, which helps them change their behavior.

So, the question is about what behavioral therapy does. Behavioral therapy's primary focus is on behavioral change, not on focusing on their pasts or thinking about their thoughts. So options F and I are techniques used within behavioral therapy, but the question is about what behavioral therapy typically alters.

Wait, the question says "typically alters the patterns of responding of clients by." So it's about influencing the patterns of responding, which is more about behavioral techniques than focusing on past experiences or thinking.

So, looking again, option F is about challenging their illogical ways through talking about past experiences. That's a part of CBT, but behavioral therapy as a whole uses a variety of techniques, including those about past experiences.

Wait, but the question is about behavioral therapy's primary action. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Influencing by controlling consequences. That's too much of a therapy influence and perhaps not entirely part of the therapy.

Option I: Encouraging talking about past experiences. That's a part of CBT, which is a form of behavioral therapy. So it's part of behavioral therapy, but does it fit the question's primary action?

Option F: It's about challenging illogical thinking by talking about past experiences, which is a technique used in behavioral therapy.

Option I: Encouraging talking about past experiences is a way to help the client's behavior change, which is part of behavioral therapy.

So the question is, which of these options correctly describes what behavioral therapy does.

Wait, the question is about the 'last character' of the answer. So the correct answer would be a letter, like F, I, etc.

Looking back, I think behavioral therapy is more about influencing the client's behavior through various methods, like systematic desensitization, cognitive restructuring, etc. So among the options, which one does that.

Option F talks about challenging illogical thinking through talking about past experiences. That's part of behavioral therapy. So that's a way Behavioral therapy uses.

Wait, the question is whether the answer is F, I, or another option.

The question says: "Behavioral therapy typically alters the patterns of responding of clients by..." So it's about influencing the patterns. Option A is about influencing by controlling consequences, which is more like a therapeutic influence, perhaps not the primary action.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option's function.

Option F is about challenging the client's illogical thinking through discussing their past experiences. That's part of behavioral therapy, but the question is about what behavioral therapy does. It's about changing the client's behavior, not just their thoughts.

Option I is about encouraging the client to talk about their past experiences, which is a form of therapy technique.

So the best option is F, because it's a way Behavioral therapy uses techniques to change the client's behavior.

Wait, no. Because I'm a bit confused. Let's read the options again.

Option F: "volitely challenging clients' illogical ways of thinking." That sounds like a therapeutic approach, perhaps in CBT.

Option I: "encouraging clients to develop a positive self-image." That's a therapeutic approach to building self-esteem.

So the question is about what behavioral therapy does, not the specific therapeutic approaches.

Wait, the question asks what behavioral therapy typically does. So behavioral therapy is about influencing behavior, not about focusing on the client's thoughts or self-perception in a different way.

So the options that fit into behavioral therapy are F and I.

Wait, but behavioral therapy's primary focus is on behavioral change. So the correct answer is one of the options that is a part of behavioral therapy's approach.

Looking at the options, option F is about challenging illogical thinking through talking about past experiences, which is a method used in behavioral therapy.

Alternatively, option I is about talking about past experiences to help change behavior.

Wait, but the question is about what behavioral therapy does. So the answer would involve influencing the client's behavior, perhaps through techniques that change their behavior.

So looking at the options again:

Option F is about challenging illogical thinking by talking about past experiences, which is part of behavioral therapy.

Option I is about encouraging talking about past experiences to change behavior.

So which of these is the primary action of behavioral therapy.

I think the correct answer is F. Because behavioral therapy's main focus is on behavioral change, which can involve challenging negative thought patterns through discussing past experiences.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: behavioral therapy's main goal is to alter patterns of responding, which is done through various techniques, including cognitive restructuring, which can involve challenging illogical thinking (option F) and encouraging talking about past experiences (option I).

Wait, but the question asks what behavioral therapy typically does. So behavioral therapy's typical action is to change the patterns of responding, which includes techniques that challenge thoughts and help the client's behavior.

But the options given are all possible answers, regardless of their directness in describing behavioral therapy's action.

Looking again, the options are:

A: Influencing by controlling consequences.

B: Focusing on dreams and unconscious mind.

C: Promoting insight into thoughts.

D: Administering medication.

E: Developing positive self-image.

F: Challenging illogical thinking through talking about past experiences.

G: Supporting spiritual beliefs.

H: Repeating client's words.

I: Encouraging talking about past experiences.

So behavioral therapy's primary action is about changing the client's behavior, which can be done through various techniques, including challenging illogical thinking and encouraging talking about past experiences.

So the question is which option best describes what behavioral therapy does.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is F and I are both techniques used in behavioral therapy.

But the question is about what behavioral therapy does, not what it does in a specific way. So among the options, both F and I are techniques, but the question says "typically alters the patterns of responding by..." So the correct answer is F and I.

Wait, but the options are single letters. The question's wording says "by" which implies it's about the method used.

So the answer should be F or I.

Wait another thought: The question is about behavioral therapy's primary action. So behavioral therapy's primary action is changing the patterns of responding, which is done through techniques that challenge illogical thinking and perhaps encourage talking about past experiences.

So the answer would be either F or I. But the question is about what behavioral therapy typically does, not which approach it uses.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, because it's a part of behavioral therapy.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let's think again.

The primary function of behavioral therapy is to influence the client's behavior by providing tools that change how the client thinks and responds. So the process involves techniques that can include challenging illogical thoughts (F) and encouraging past experience talk (I).

So the correct answer is F or I.

But in the options, the choices are single letters, so I think the intended answer is F. Alternatively, I might have misremembered.

Wait, looking up (mentally), I think behavioral therapy does involve challenging illogical thinking techniques, so option F.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the answer's last character. So the correct answer is either F (last letter F) or I (I). The options are single letters, so the answer must be F or I.

Wait, but the question is about 'typically alters the patterns of responding by...' So the correct answer is F because it's about challenging illogical thinking, which is part of behavioral therapy.

Alternatively, I'm recalling that behavioral therapy uses a variety of techniques, including those that encourage talking about past experiences (option I), but that's a form of CBT.

Hmm, perhaps F is not the correct answer. Let's think again.

The question is about what behavioral therapy does, not about specific approaches. So behavioral therapy's primary action is to change the client's behavior through techniques that influence their responses.

So the correct answer should be F or I. Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: The options that describe behaviors are A (influence), H (repetition), etc. Not helpful.

Wait, another approach: What does behavioral therapy do in general? It's about helping the client change their behavior, not thinking. So the techniques it uses include things like cognitive restructuring, which can involve challenging negative thought patterns (so option F) and encouraging talking about past experiences (so option I). So both F and I are parts of behavioral therapy.

But the question is about the primary action. So the answer would be F or I.

Wait, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not 100% confident.

Alternatively, I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the question is asking. The options are about what behavioral therapy does. The correct answer is F or I.

Wait, the question is about the last character of the answer. So the answer must be a single letter. So the correct answer is either F or I.

But I'm not sure which one is correct. Let me think about the process again.

The question is about behavioral therapy's typical action. So the answer is about altering the client's patterns of responding, which is done through techniques that challenge illogical thinking and encourage talking about past experiences.

Both options F and I are techniques used in behavioral therapy. So the correct answer is F or I.

But the question is about the answer's last character. So if the correct answer is F, the last letter is F. If it's I, the last letter is I.

Wait, perhaps F is not correct. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, option F says "volitely challenging clients' illogical ways of thinking." That's a way behavioral therapy uses, but it's more about the client's thoughts, not the client's behavior.

Option I says "encouraging clients to talk about their past experiences and traumas." That's part of CBT, which is a form of behavioral therapy. So both F and I describe techniques within behavioral therapy.

But the question is about what behavioral therapy does. It's about influencing the client's behavior, so perhaps the correct answer is F and I are possible, but looking at the options, the question is about what behavioral therapy does, not which technique.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F because it's about thinking, which is part of behavioral therapy.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The correct answer is likely F or I. Since both are techniques in behavioral therapy, but I'm not sure which is the primary action.

Wait, the question's answer is the letter corresponding to the correct option. So if the correct answer is F, the last letter is F. If it's I, it's I.

But looking for the most accurate answer, perhaps option F is the correct one because it's about challenging illogical thinking, which is part of behavioral therapy. Option I is another technique used.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Alternatively, the answer is F because the question is about changing the client's patterns of responding, which would involve techniques that challenge their thinking.

So, I think the correct answer is F.
</think>

The question asks what behavioral therapy typically does by altering the patterns of responding. Behavioral therapy focuses on influencing behavior through techniques rather than just changing thoughts. 

Option A discusses influencing consequences, which is more about therapeutic influence rather than behavior change. Options B and G are about focusing on unconscious aspects and spiritual beliefs, which are not typical components of behavioral therapy. Option D involves administering medication, which is outside the scope of behavioral therapy. Option E is about developing positive self-image, which is a different approach. 

Options C and H focus on insight and repetition, which are not central to behavioral therapy. 

Options F and I describe techniques commonly used in behavioral therapy, such as challenging illogical thinking and encouraging past experience talk. Both are valid, but the question specifies the last character of the answer. Option F ends with "F," and option I ends with "I." 

Since the question asks for the last character of the correct answer, the correct choice is F, as it corresponds to the letter "F" in option F.

ANSWER: F
