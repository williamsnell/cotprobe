Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 52 plus 6 multiplied by 2. Hmm, I remember from school that I should do the multiplication before the addition. So let me think about the order of operations. Yeah, PEMDAS, right? Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

So in this case, there's no parentheses or exponents, so I should do the multiplication first. 6 times 2 is 12. Then I add that to 52. So 52 plus 12 equals 64. Wait, but looking at the options, there's an option J which is 64. So the answer should be J. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait. Oh no, wait a second. No, wait. Wait, 52 plus 6 is 58, and then 58 multiplied by 2 is 116. Oh, wait, no, because the original problem is 52 + (6 * 2). So I did that correctly. So 6*2 is 12, and 52+12 is 64, which is option J. So I think that's right.

The correct answer is J: 64.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Compute the multiplication first: 6 * 2 = 12.
2. Add to 52: 52 + 12 = 64.

Answer: J
