Okay, so I have this question about calculating depreciation using the declining-balance method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Dr. Frankel bought an X-ray machine for $4,000. The machine's estimated life is 5 years, with a salvage value of $800. He's using the declining-balance method with a depreciation rate of 40%. I need to compute the depreciation for each year and see which option matches.

Wait, I remember that the declining balance method uses a straight-line rate multiplied by the book value each year. So, the depreciation each year is based on the current book value, which decreases each year.

The formula for each year's depreciation is: Depreciation = (Depreciation Rate) * (Cost - Accumulated Depreciation so far). 

Let me list out the steps for each year:

Year 1:
Depreciation = 40% * 4000 = 0.4 * 4000 = $1,600. The book value then becomes 4000 - 1600 = $2,400.

Year 2:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 2400 = 960. Book value becomes 2400 - 960 = $1,440.

Year 3:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 1440 = 576. Book value now is 1440 - 576 = $864.

Year 4:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 864 = 345.6. Book value becomes 864 - 345.6 = $518.4.

Year 5:
Depreciation would be 0.4 * 518.4 = 207.36. But wait, the salvage value is $800. So, if the book value minus accumulated depreciation after 4 years is 518.4, then the book value in year 5 should be 518.4 - 207.36 = 311.04. But since the salvage value is 800, which is more than 311.04, the depreciation in the fifth year would be limited to (800 - 311.04) = 488.96. But wait, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to adjust that. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't limit it to the straight method but just uses the declining balance regardless of salvage.

Wait, the question says he will use the declining balance method, so I think we calculate each year's depreciation as per the method, even if beyond the salvage value. But wait, the machine's salvage value is $800, so when calculating the depreciation for the last year, if the book value minus accumulated depreciation equals the salvage value, then no further depreciation is needed.

Let's recalculate each year's depreciation:

Year 1:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 4000 = 1600. Book value: 4000 - 1600 = 2400.

Year 2:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 2400 = 960. Book value: 2400 - 960 = 1440.

Year 3:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 1440 = 576. Book value: 1440 - 576 = 864.

Year 4:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 864 = 345.6. Book value: 864 - 345.6 = 518.4.

Year 5:
Depreciation = 0.4 * 518.4 = 207.36. But wait, the machine's salvage value is $800. So, the book value at the end of year 4 is 518.4. Subtracting the accumulated depreciation of 1600 + 960 + 576 + 345.6 = 3481.6. So, the book value after 4 years is 4000 - 3481.6 = 518.4. 

The salvage value is 800, but since 518.4 is less than 800, the machine would still be depreciated. So, in year 5, the depreciation would be the full 207.36, bringing the book value down to 518.4 - 207.36 = 311.04. But does this affect the depreciation calculation? I think so because we're using the declining balance method, which doesn't consider the salvage value until the end. Wait, no, the declining balance method doesn't take salvage into account except when calculating the total depreciation. So, perhaps the depreciation for each year is based on the book value, regardless of the salvage.

But wait, no. The depreciation calculated each year is based on the book value at the beginning of the year. So, for year 5, the book value is 311.04, but the depreciation is 207.36, which would bring it down to 311.04 - 207.36 = 103.68. However, the salvage value is 800. So, the machine's book value would be higher than the salvage, so no further depreciation is needed in year 5. But in this case, the depreciation is still 207.36, even though the book value is lower than the salvage. So, Frankel's machine would still be depreciated for year 5, but the book value would be 311.04, which is less than the salvage value. But the question is about the depreciation amount for each year, regardless of the salvage. So, the depreciation would be 207.36 in the fifth year.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option H has the depreciation as $1,600 each year, which doesn't make sense because the depreciation rate is 40%, so the first year would be 1600. But the second year would be 960, which is 40% of 2400. But the third year would be 40% of 1440, which is 576, and so on. So option H's depreciation each year is fixed at 1600, which seems incorrect because the rate is 40%, so it should decrease each year.

Looking at option H:

A: 1,600, 960, 576, 345.6, 207.36

Wait, no. No, option H is 1,600 for all years, which doesn't fit the declining balance method.

Another option is option B: 1,600, 1,000, 600, 360, 216. That doesn't seem right because the second year's depreciation is 1,000, which is higher than the 960 I calculated. So that's probably incorrect.

Option G: 1,400, 840, 504, 302.4, 181.44. Hmm, starts with 1,400, which doesn't align with the 40% of 4000.

Option F: 2,000 is way too high, so no.

Option E: 1,800, which is more than 40% of 4000. So that's not right.

Wait, I think I might be making a mistake. Let me recalculate each year again.

Year 1:

Depreciation = 40% of 4000 = 1600. Book value: 4000 - 1600 = 2400.

Year 2:

Depreciation = 40% of 2400 = 960. Book value: 2400 - 960 = 1440.

Year 3:

Depreciation = 40% of 1440 = 576. Book value: 1440 - 576 = 864.

Year 4:

Depreciation = 40% of 864 = 345.6. Book value: 864 - 345.6 = 518.4.

Year 5:

Depreciation = 40% of 518.4 = 207.36. Book value: 518.4 - 207.36 = 311.04.

So, the depreciation each year is 1600, 960, 576, 345.6, 207.36.

Looking at the options, option H is 1,600, 960, 576, 345.6, 0. Wait, no, option H's last year is 207.36? Let me check option H again.

Option H says: $1,600, $960, $576, $345.6, $207.36. Wait, that's five years, each year's depreciation is 1600, 960, 576, 345.6, 207.36. That would be option H.

Wait, but that's not correct because the last year's depreciation would be 207.36, which brings the book value down to 311.04, which is below the salvage value. But the question is about depreciation, not whether the machine is sold or not. So the depreciation for each year is calculated regardless of whether the machine is sold. So option H's depreciation is correct for each year.

Wait, but looking at option H, the last year's depreciation is 207.36, which is correct, but the sum of all the years would be 1600 + 960 + 576 + 345.6 + 207.36 = let me calculate that.

1600 + 960 = 2560.

2560 + 576 = 3136.

3136 + 345.6 = 3481.6.

3481.6 + 207.36 = 3688.96.

But the total depreciation should be equal to the cost minus the salvage value. So, 4000 - 800 = 3200. But 3688.96 is more than 3200. So this suggests that the depreciation can't be more than the cost minus salvage. Therefore, in the fifth year, the depreciation should be limited to 800 - (4000 - 1600 - 960 - 576 - 345.6) = 800 - (4000 - 3481.6) = 800 - 518.4 = 281.6. But that's a different approach.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the calculations. Let me sum the depreciation each year:

Year 1: 1600 → Total: 1600

Year 2: 960 → Total: 2560

Year 3: 576 → Total: 3136

Year 4: 345.6 → Total: 3481.6

Year 5: 207.36 → Total: 3688.96

But the total depreciation should be 3200 (since 4000 - 800 = 3200). So, the sum is 3688.96, which is over. This suggests that the declining balance method's total depreciation may exceed the salvage value. So, perhaps in the fifth year, the depreciation is limited to 800 - (4000 - 1600 - 960 - 576 - 345.6) = 800 - 518.4 = 281.6.

So, the fifth year's depreciation would be 281.6 instead of 207.36. That would bring the total depreciation to 1600 + 960 + 576 + 345.6 + 281.6 = 3663.2, which is still over 3200. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach: The machine's depreciation each year must not cause the book value to drop below the salvage value. So, after each year's depreciation, the book value is reduced by that amount. So, let's see:

Year 1: 1600 → Book value: 2400.

Year 2: 960 → 2400 - 960 = 1440.

Year 3: 576 → 1440 - 576 = 864.

Year 4: 345.6 → 864 - 345.6 = 518.4.

Year 5: 207.36 → 518.4 - 207.36 = 311.04, which is still above the salvage value. So, there's no need to adjust the depreciation for the fifth year because the book value is still above 800. But the total depreciation is 1600 + 960 + 576 + 345.6 + 207.36 = 3688.96. But the cost was 4000, salvage 800, so the total depreciation should be 3200.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the depreciation. Because the declining balance method doesn't cap the depreciation based on salvage, it just applies the rate to the book value each year, regardless of whether the book value is above or below the salvage. So, if the book value drops below the salvage, no further depreciation is needed, but the method still calculates it, which might seem odd because it would cause the book value to go below the salvage, which would be an issue.

Wait, perhaps the question is just about using the declining balance method, regardless of whether the book value goes below salvage. So, the depreciation should be 1600, 960, 576, 345.6, 207.36. So the correct answer would be option H.

Let me check the options again. Option H says 1,600, 960, 576, 345.6, 207.36. That matches what I've calculated. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The question requires calculating the depreciation for each year using the declining balance method with a 40% depreciation rate and a salvage value of $800. The machine's cost is $4,000, and its estimated life is 5 years.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Year 1:**
   - Depreciation = 40% of $4,000 = $1,600.
   - Book value after Year 1 = $4,000 - $1,600 = $2,400.

2. **Year 2:**
   - Depreciation = 40% of $2,400 = $960.
   - Book value after Year 2 = $2,400 - $960 = $1,440.

3. **Year 3:**
   - Depreciation = 40% of $1,440 = $576.
   - Book value after Year 3 = $1,440 - $576 = $864.

4. **Year 4:**
   - Depreciation = 40% of $864 = $345.6.
   - Book value after Year 4 = $864 - $345.6 = $518.4.

5. **Year 5:**
   - Depreciation = 40% of $518.4 = $207.36.
   - Book value after Year 5 = $518.4 - $207.36 = $311.04.

### Validation:
The total depreciation calculated is $1,600 + $960 + $576 + $345.6 + $207.36 = $3,688.96. However, the machine's cost is $4,000, and the salvage value is $800, so the total depreciation should be $4,000 - $800 = $3,200. The slight discrepancy arises because the declining balance method does not cap depreciation based on the salvage value, allowing the book value to drop below it. However, the depreciation calculated for each year is correct based on the declining balance method.

### Correct Option:
The depreciation schedule matches the options provided. Option **H** lists the depreciation amounts as $1,600, $960, $576, $345.6, and $207.36 for each year, respectively.
