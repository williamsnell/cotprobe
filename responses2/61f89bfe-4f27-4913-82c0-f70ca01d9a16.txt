Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about a concentration cell, right? The question is about the relative concentrations of zinc and copper ions when the cell is completely discharged. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, what's a concentration cell again? Oh right, it's a setup where two solutions of ions are placed in separate containers, and the cell potential is maintained by varying the concentrations of the ions. In this case, the cell is Zn; Zn²+/Cu²+/Cu. So the setup is Zn metal | Zn²+ || Cu²+ | Cu metal.

The standard cell potential is given as E° = 1.10 volts. I remember that in concentration cells, the higher concentration of the ion with a lower reduction potential tends to get reduced. Or wait, the higher concentration is where the reaction would proceed based on the E°.

So which ions have which standard reduction potentials? Zinc has a lower E° than copper. Zinc's E° is about 0.76 V, and copper's is around 1.36 V. So Cu²+ is a stronger oxidizing agent than Zn²+. 

Wait, but in concentration cells, the one with the higher concentration of the reacting ion will tend to be reduced. Because higher concentration of the oxidizing agent (like Cu²+ in this case) will attract electrons, so the reaction will proceed.

So the cell is set up with E° positive, meaning it's a spontaneous cell. When the cell is completely discharged, I guess that means the cell is at equilibrium. Or wait, no, when the cell is completely discharged, maybe the concentrations don't change because the cell is at equilibrium?

Wait, no, wait. When a concentration cell is set up, the cell will not produce a current because the concentrations of the ions are the same in both half-cells, so there's no driving force. But once the concentrations change, the cell will drive a current.

Wait, but the question says the cell has completely run down. Oh, I think that means the concentrations have changed enough that the cell can no longer drive a current. Or perhaps the cell is at equilibrium, which occurs when the concentrations are such that the cell voltage is zero.

Wait, but the problem is about the relative concentrations when the cell has completely run down, so perhaps the cell is at equilibrium.

Wait, no, maybe it's about when the cell can no longer be discharged. So after the cell is discharged, the concentrations would adjust to what?

Alternatively, perhaps the concentrations must equalize because the cell is a concentration cell. Let me think.

In a concentration cell, the two half-cells have the same metal, but different ions. The higher concentration of the oxidizing agent (like Cu²+) will tend to reduce, so the reaction will occur until the concentrations of the ions are equal.

Wait, but in this case, the cell is set up with Zn and Cu. So the setup is:

Zn metal | Zn²+ || Cu²+ | Cu metal

So when the cell is discharged, it will drive a current until the concentrations of the ions are such that the cell can no longer drive any current. Since the cell is a concentration cell, the concentrations must equalize.

So the cell will reach an equilibrium when the concentrations of Zn²+ and Cu²+ are the same, right? Because the cell potential is zero when concentrations are equal.

Wait, but wait. The cell is Zn | Zn²+ and Cu | Cu²+.

In a concentration cell, the reaction is driven between the two ions. The higher concentration of the oxidizing agent (Cu²+) will cause a spontaneous cell reaction. The reaction would proceed until the concentrations are equal.

But wait, the cell is set up with Zn and Cu, so the higher concentration of Cu²+ will lead to a spontaneous cell reaction where Cu²+ is reduced (as it's more likely to attract electrons) and Zn²+ is oxidized.

So the cell will keep moving until the concentrations of the ions are equal. Because then, the driving force (E°) is zero, so no more current flows.

So, when the cell is discharged completely, the concentrations of Zn²+ and Cu²+ will be equal.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me look at the options.

Option D says concentrations are equal.

Option A says Cu²+ is slightly greater than Zn²+. That would imply the cell is not at equilibrium, which wouldn't be the case when it's completely discharged.

Option E: Cu²+ equals initial concentration of Zn²+. Hmm, that's not necessarily true unless the concentrations equilibrate.

Wait, no. The problem states that the cell has completely run down. So, perhaps the setup is that the cell has been discharged, meaning that the concentrations have changed such that the cell is at equilibrium.

Wait, but the question is about the relative concentrations when the cell has completely run down. So perhaps it's when the concentrations are equal.

So the correct answer should be D: The concentrations of Zn²+ and Cu²+ are equal.

Let me double-check. Another way to think: in a concentration cell, when discharge occurs (current flows), the higher concentration of the oxidizing agent (Cu²+) will cause the reaction: Cu²+ + 2e^- → Cu; Zn²+ + 2e^- → Zn. So, Cu²+ is reduced, Zn²+ is oxidized.

The cell will continue to transfer electrons until the concentrations of the ions are equal because the cell potential E° is zero. At that point, no further current flows.

So when the cell is completely discharged, the concentrations are equal. So the correct answer is D.

In a concentration cell, the relative concentrations of the reacting ions depend on their standard reduction potentials. Zinc (Zn²⁺) has a lower standard reduction potential (E° = 0.76 V) compared to copper (Cu²⁺, E° = 1.36 V). Since Cu²⁺ has a higher reduction potential, it acts as the oxidizing agent and attracts electrons, causing the reaction to proceed until equilibrium is reached.

When the cell is completely discharged, it means the concentration of the ions has equilibrated because the cell potential is zero. At equilibrium, the concentrations of Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ are equal, as the driving force for the reaction is no longer present. This ensures that no further current flows.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. If Cu²⁺ were slightly greater than Zn²⁺, the cell would not be at equilibrium.
- **B**: Incorrect. Both ions are not completely depleted; equilibrium occurs when their concentrations equalize.
- **C**: Incorrect. Cu²⁺ is not necessarily slightly less than Zn²⁺; the concentrations are equal at equilibrium.
- **D**: Correct. At equilibrium, the concentrations of Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ are equal.
- **E**: Incorrect. Cu²⁺ is not equal to the initial concentration of Zn²⁺; they equilibrate to the same concentration.
- **F**: Incorrect. Zinc²⁺ is not far less than Cu²⁺; they equilibrate to the same concentration.
- **G**: Incorrect. Zinc²⁺ is not far greater than Cu²⁺; they equilibrate to the same concentration.
- **H**: Incorrect. The concentrations of Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ do not remain unchanged; they equilibrate.
- **I**: Incorrect. The concentrations of Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ do not remain unchanged; they equilibrate.
- **J**: Incorrect. Zinc²⁺ is not slightly greater than Cu²⁺; they equilibrate to the same concentration.

The correct answer is that the concentrations of Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ are equal when the cell has completely run down.
