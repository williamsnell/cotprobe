Okay, so I have this calculus problem here, and I need to find the volume of a solid formed by rotating a region around the x-axis. The region is bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x³). Hmm, right. So, I remember that when you rotate a function around the x-axis, you use the disk method. The formula for the volume is π times the integral from a to b of [f(x)]² dx. 

Alright, so first, I need to figure out the limits of integration. The region is bounded by the x-axis, which is y=0, and the curve y = x/(1+x³). I suppose the region starts at x=0 because if x is 0, f(x) is 0, right? So that's one point. Now, where does the curve intersect the x-axis again? Well, y = 0 when x=0, so maybe it only touches the x-axis at 0. Wait, but for x positive, the function is positive as long as 1+x³ is positive. Since x³ is positive for x>0, denominator is positive, so the function is positive. So, maybe the region is from x=0 to x approaching infinity? But wait, the function f(x) tends to zero as x approaches infinity because the denominator grows faster than the numerator. Hmm, but integrating from 0 to infinity might be an improper integral.

Wait, but in the options given, all the answers are finite. So, I'm probably supposed to compute the volume from x=0 to x=1, or perhaps to some finite value where the function doesn't cross the x-axis again. Wait, no, the function is always positive for x>0, so maybe the region is actually from x=0 to x=1. Let me think again. Because when you have a function that tends to zero as x approaches infinity, but it's positive everywhere, so the region is bounded between x=0 and x=∞, but when rotated, it might form a finite volume. Wait, but the integral of [x/(1+x³)]² dx from 0 to ∞ might converge. 

Wait, let me check: [x/(1+x³)]² = x²/(1+x³)^2. Let's see if that integral converges at infinity. Let me make a substitution for large x. Let me set t = x³, so dt = 3x² dx, so x² dx = dt/3. So, the integral becomes ∫ dt/(1 + t)^2 from t=0 to infinity. The integral of 1/(1 + t)^2 dt is -1/(1 + t) + C, evaluated from 0 to ∞. As t approaches ∞, -1/(1 + t) approaches 0; at t=0, it's -1. So the integral is 0 - (-1) = 1. So the integral from 0 to ∞ of [x/(1+x³)]² dx is 1. So, the volume is π times that, which is π. But wait, π is one of the options, option J. But wait, I thought the options were A:4π, B:3π, C:5π/2, D:6π, E:π/3, F:2π, G:π/2, H:π/4, I:3π/2, J:π.

Wait, so volume would be π. So, the answer is J: π. But let me double-check. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because the integral of [x/(1+x³)]² dx from 0 to ∞ is 1, so the volume is π * 1 = π, so option J. Hmm, but let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the function is bounded between x=0 and x=1, but no, because at x=1, f(x)=1/(1+1)=1/2. So, the function is positive beyond x=0. So, the region would extend to infinity, so the volume is finite, and the integral is indeed 1, so the volume is π.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Let me redo the substitution. Let me set t = x³, so x = t^{1/3}, dx = (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫ [ (t^{1/3})/(1 + t) ]² * (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt. Simplify that: (t^{1/3})^2 is t^{2/3}; denominator is (1 + t)^2. So, numerator is t^{2/3}, denominator is (1 + t)^2, multiplied by (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt. So, the t terms are t^{2/3} * t^{-2/3} = t^0 =1, so the integral becomes (1/3) ∫ 1/(1 + t)^2 dt from t=0 to t=∞. The integral of 1/(1 + t)^2 is -1/(1 + t) + C. Evaluating from 0 to ∞, as before, it's 0 - (-1) =1. So, (1/3)*1 =1/3. Wait, but then wait, why did I get confused earlier? Oh, no, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the substitution. Wait, let me redo it correctly.

Wait, original integral is ∫ from 0 to ∞ [x/(1 + x³)]² dx. Let me set t = x³, so x = t^{1/3}, dx = (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt. So, substituting, we get:

∫ [ t^{1/3} / (1 + t) ]² * (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt.

Which is ∫ [ t^{2/3} / (1 + t)^2 ] * (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt.

Simplify inside the integral: t^{2/3} * t^{-2/3} = 1, so it becomes ∫ (1/3) * [1/(1 + t)^2] dt.

So, that's (1/3) ∫ from t=0 to t=∞ of [1/(1 + t)^2] dt. The integral of 1/(1 + t)^2 is -1/(1 + t) + C. Evaluated from 0 to ∞:

At t=∞: -1/(1 + ∞) = 0.

At t=0: -1/(1 + 0) = -1.

So, the integral is 0 - (-1) =1.

Multiply by 1/3, so 1/3 *1=1/3. Thus, the integral from 0 to ∞ of [x/(1 + x³)]² dx is 1/3. Therefore, the volume is π*(1/3) = π/3. So, the volume is π/3, which is option E. Wait, but previously I thought it was π, but that was a miscalculation. So, conclusion is the volume is π/3, which is option E.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I thought the integral was 1. Let me redo that part again.

Wait, original substitution: let t = x³, so x = t^{1/3}, dx = (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt.

So, [x/(1 + x³)]² is [ t^{1/3}/(1 + t) ]² = t^{2/3}/(1 + t)^2.

Multiply by dx: [ t^{2/3}/(1 + t)^2 ] * (1/3) t^{-2/3} dt = (1/3) * [ t^{2/3} * t^{-2/3} ] / (1 + t)^2 dt = (1/3) * 1/(1 + t)^2 dt.

So, integral from t=0 to t=∞ is (1/3) ∫ [1/(1 + t)^2] dt. The antiderivative is -1/(1 + t) + C. Evaluated from 0 to ∞: at ∞, it's 0; at 0, it's -1. So, 0 - (-1) =1. Multiply by 1/3: 1/3. So, the integral is 1/3. Thus, the volume is π*(1/3) = π/3, which is option E.

Wait, so earlier, I must have made a mistake in the substitution, thinking the integral was 1, but it's actually 1/3, making the volume π/3, option E. So, the correct answer is E.

Wait, but another way to compute the integral is by substitution. Let me try integrating [x/(1 + x³)]² dx. Maybe using substitution u = x², but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a trigonometric substitution. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like u = x³ +1, du = 3x² dx, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating [x/(1 + x³)]² dx can be rewritten as x²/(1 + x³)^2 dx. Let me consider substitution u = 1 + x³, du = 3x² dx, so x² dx = du/3. So, the integral becomes ∫ (1/u²) * (du/3) = (1/3) ∫ u^{-2} du = (1/3)(-1/u) + C = -1/(3u) + C = -1/(3(1 + x³)) + C. Evaluating from 0 to ∞:

At ∞, -1/(3(∞)) = 0.

At 0, -1/(3(1 + 0)) = -1/3.

So, the integral is 0 - (-1/3) = 1/3. So, same result. So, the volume is π/3, option E.

Thus, the correct answer is E.

The volume is calculated using the disk method. The integral of [x/(1 + x³)]² from 0 to ∞ is found to be 1/3, leading to a volume of π/3.
