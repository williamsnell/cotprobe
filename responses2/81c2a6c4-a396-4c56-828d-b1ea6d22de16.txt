Question:

A 17-year-old boy was jostling with his 12-year-old brother. A pedestrian witnessed the boy shoving his brother and mistakenly believed that they were fighting. Acting as a Good Samaritan, the pedestrian approached the boys and tried to intercede. The boy stumbled and accidentally fell into the pedestrian, knocking him to the ground. The pedestrian broke his arm as a result of the fall. If the pedestrian sues the boy to recover damages for his injury, he should

Options:

A: prevail, because the pedestrian reasonably believed that the boy was about to injure his brother.
B: prevail, based upon the doctrine of transferred intent.
C: not prevail, because the pedestrian assumed the risk.
D: not prevail, unless the boy was negligent.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically about negligence and the doctrine of transferred intent. Let me try to break it down.

The question states that a 17-year-old boy is jostling with his 12-year-old brother. A pedestrian witnesses the boy pushing his brother and thinks they're fighting. The pedestrian then approaches the boy, believing he's in trouble, but the boy falls and knocks him down. The pedestrian's arm breaks because of the fall. The boy sues for damages, and the question is whether the pedestrian will prevail.

I remember that when a minor is injured, the cause of the injury is a key point. The doctrine of transferred intent applies when the plaintiff's intent to recover damages is transferred to the tortfeasor. So, if the pedestrian thought the boy was about to harm himself, that intent transfers to the pedestrian.

Wait, but here's the thing: the pedestrian is a minor. Can he transfer his intent? I think minors have a higher burden of proof. They need to prove that their belief was reasonable. So if the pedestrian believed the boy was about to cause an injury, that's a valid reason for the belief. But wait, the question says the pedestrian approached the boy and believed he was in trouble. The boy's fall caused the pedestrian's arm to break. So the pedestrian thought the boy would hit the pedestrian, leading to his injury.

So, when the pedestrian sues, they can argue that the pedestrian's belief was reasonable, so the intent is transferred. But wait, the doctrine of transferred intent applies when the tortfeasor can prove that their belief of the injury was reasonable. In this case, the pedestrian was a minor. But are minors allowed to transfer their intent? I think yes, but the reasoning might be a bit different. Because minors have a higher standard of proofâ€”proof of intent is more stringent. So, the pedestrian has to prove that their belief that the boy was about to hurt them was reasonable.

So, if the pedestrian can show that their belief was reasonable, then the intent would transfer. That would mean the pedestrian can recover damages because their belief was a valid reason for the injury.

Wait, but the options don't directly mention intent. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Prevail because pedestrian reasonably believed the boy was about to injure. So, if the pedestrian's belief was reasonable, they can recover.

Option B: Prevail based on transferred intent. But minors can't transfer their intent as easily as adults. Or can they?

Option C: Not prevail because pedestrian assumed the risk. That's the inverse of what I thought. If the pedestrian assumed the risk, they'd be likely to win. But in this case, pedestrian didn't assume, they approached the boy. So C seems incorrect.

Option D: Not prevail unless boy was negligent. I don't think so because the question doesn't say anything about the boy being negligent. The pedestrian's belief was likely not negligence.

So, the key issue is whether the pedestrian can transfer their intent to recover damages. Since the pedestrian was a minor, they might have more difficulty proving the intent. But I think the doctrine still applies. So the pedestrian can prevail because their belief was reasonable.

Wait, but wait another point. The situation is that the boy was jostling, perhaps pushing his brother. The pedestrian, as a minor, may not have the same risk of harm as an adult. But when a minor sues, can the defendant's belief of injury transfer their intent?

I remember that for the doctrine of transferred intent, the tortfeasor must prove that their belief of injury was a reasonable belief. So, if the pedestrian's belief was reasonable, then yes, the intent transfers.

So, the answer might be A or B. Wait, the options don't have both. Let me read the options again.

Option A: Prevail because the pedestrian reasonably believed that the boy was about to injure. So, if the pedestrian's belief was reasonable, they can recover.

Option B: Prevail based on transferred intent. So, if the pedestrian's belief was transferred, they can recover.

Wait, but for the transferred intent doctrine, the tortfeasor must prove that the belief was a reasonable belief. So, the pedestrian would have to prove that their belief that the boy was about to injure was reasonable.

But the question is phrased as whether the pedestrian sues because he reasonably believed the boy was about to injure. So that's the basis for A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. So, if the pedestrian's belief was reasonable, then the intent is transferred, and the pedestrian can recover. So the answer would be A.

Alternatively, the question is whether the pedestrian sues because they reasonably believed it. So, if the belief was reasonable, which is a condition for the doctrine, then yes. So, the pedestrian can prevail.

So, the answer is A.

Wait, but another angle: the doctrine of transferred intent requires the defendant to prove that the belief was a reasonable belief that the plaintiff would be injured. So the pedestrian's belief must be a reasonable belief. The question says the pedestrian "miscalculated" or "assumed the risk." Wait, no, the pedestrian approached the boy thinking he was in trouble.

So, in this case, if the pedestrian thought the boy was about to have an accident, that belief may or may not be reasonable. But the question states that the pedestrian "mistakenly believed that they were fighting." So, maybe the pedestrian's belief was incorrect. But the question is whether the belief was reasonable.

So, the question is whether the pedestrian's belief was reasonable. If it was, then the intent is transferred.

So, the pedestrian sues on the basis that their belief was reasonable, which allows them to recover damages. So, the answer would be A: prevail because the pedestrian reasonably believed...

Alternatively, if the belief was not reasonable, then the pedestrian wouldn't prevail.

But the question is, what is the basis for the pedestrian's belief? The question says the pedestrian mistakenly believed they were about to fight. So perhaps the belief was incorrect, but the question is about the basis for the belief. So the pedestrian's belief was reasonable, so they can recover.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is that the pedestrian "mistakenly believed that they were fighting." So perhaps the belief was incorrect, but the question is whether the belief was reasonable. So the belief's reasonableness is the issue.

In that case, the pedestrian sues based on the belief being reasonable, so option A.

Alternatively, if the belief was not reasonable, then the pedestrian wouldn't prevail.

But the question isn't asking about the reasonableness of the pedestrian's belief. It's asking the pedestrian's suity; so, the pedestrian's belief must be a reasonable belief for the doctrine to apply. So, yes, the pedestrian sues because their belief was reasonable. So A is correct.

So the correct answer is A: prevails because the pedestrian reasonably believed the boy was about to injure.

The question revolves around whether a pedestrian sues a child for injuries caused by the child's fall, based on the doctrine of transferred intent. The key issue is whether the pedestrian's belief that the boy was about to injure him was reasonable.

The doctrine of transferred intent applies when the tortfeasor can prove that their belief of injury was a reasonable belief. In this case, the pedestrian, as a minor, must prove that their belief that the boy was about to injure was reasonable for the intent to recover damages to be transferred. The pedestrian approached the boy, believing he was in danger, and the boy fell, causing the pedestrian's arm to break.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. If the pedestrian reasonably believed the boy was about to injure, they can recover damages because the intent to recover is transferred.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The doctrine of transferred intent requires the tortfeasor to prove the belief was reasonable, not that it was transferred.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The pedestrian did not assume the risk; they approached the boy with the belief.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The question does not indicate that the boy was negligent; it focuses on the pedestrian's belief.

The pedestrian's belief must be reasonable to apply the doctrine of transferred intent, allowing them to recover damages. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
