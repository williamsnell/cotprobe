Okay, so I've got this problem about a hydraulic press and the change in volume of oil. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the oil volume is 0.25 m³, and the pressure increases by Δp of 1.6e7 Pa. I remember that the bulk modulus is involved here. Oh wait, the bulk modulus B is given as 5.0e9 Pa. Bulk modulus formula is B = - (ΔV / V) * (Δp / P), but wait, no—actually, the formula for the fractional change in volume is ΔV/V = - (Δp / B), assuming pressure is in the same units. So the negative sign indicates compression.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The bulk modulus equation is Δp = B * (ΔV / V). So solving for ΔV, that would be ΔV = (Δp / B) * V. But wait, is it negative? Because when pressure increases, volume decreases, right? So I think the formula is ΔV = - (Δp / B) * V. So the change in volume is negative.

So the problem asks for the decrease in volume. So the answer would be a negative number, right? But the options are all negative.

So let's plug in the numbers. V is 0.25 m³. Δp is 1.6e7 Pa. B is 5e9 Pa.

So ΔV = -(Δp / B) * V. Let me compute this: 1.6e7 divided by 5e9. Hmm. 1.6e7 is 16000000. 5e9 is 5,000,000,000. So 16,000,000 / 50,000,000,000 = 16e6 / 5e8. That's (16/5) * 1e-2. 16/5 is 3.2, times 0.01 is 0.032. So 0.032. But wait, that's without the negative sign. So ΔV is approximately -0.032 m³. But wait, wait. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 1.6e7 is 16,000,000. Divided by 5e9 would be 5,000,000,000. So 16,000,000 /5e9 = (16e6) / (5e9) = (16/5) * 1e-3 = 3.2 * 1e-3 = 0.0032. Oh wait, wait—that's 3.2e-3, which is 0.0032. But wait, that's without the negative. But wait, the formula is ΔV = -(Δp / B) * V. So the negative would make it -0.0032 m³, which is a decrease of 0.0032 m³. But none of the options are that. Oh wait, the options are in terms of 1e-4 m³. Because each option is a change on the order of 1e-4. So I need to make sure I've got the correct scaling.

Wait, wait, no. Let me check the calculations again. Wait, 1.6e7 is 16,000,000. Divided by 5e9 is 5,000,000,000. So 16e6 /5e9 = (16/5) * 1e-3 = 3.2 * 1e-3 = 0.0032 m³. So ΔV is -0.0032 m³. But the options are in steps of 1e-4, so maybe I should convert this into that scale.

Wait, 1e-4 m³ is 0.0001 m³. So 0.0032 m³ is 3.2e-3, which is 32 * 1e-4, so 32 times 0.0001. But wait, wait. The question says the volume decreases, so the number is negative. So the decrease is 0.0032 m³, which is 3.2e-3, which is 32e-4. But the options are in terms of 1e-4. So perhaps the problem expects us to write this as 32 * 1e-4, but wait the options are not in that form. Or maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 1.6e7 /5e9 = (1.6 /5) * 1e-2 = 0.32 * 0.01 = 0.0032 m³. So 0.0032 m³ is 3.2e-3 m³. But the options are given in terms of 1e-4. So perhaps we should convert 0.0032 m³ into 1e-4 units.

Wait, 1e-4 m³ is 0.0001 m³. So 0.0032 m³ is 32 * 0.0001 m³, which is 32e-4 m³. But looking at the options, the choices are in the 1e-4 m³ units. Let me look at the options again.

Options A to J are: A: -1.5, B: -0.2, C: -1.0, D: -2.0, E: -1.2, F: -0.8, G: -0.6, H: -0.3, I: -1.7, J: -0.5.

Wait, none of these are 32. So maybe I did something wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The bulk modulus B is 5e9 Pa. The pressure increase is 1.6e7 Pa. So the change in volume is (Δp / B) * V multiplied by negative sign.

So Δp = 1.6e7 Pa, B =5e9 Pa. So (1.6e7) / (5e9) = 0.0032. So 0.0032 * V.

V is 0.25 m³. So 0.0032 * 0.25 = 0.0008 m³. So 0.0008 m³ is 8e-4 m³. So the change in volume is -0.0008 m³. So the decrease is 0.0008 m³, which is 8e-4 m³.

Looking at the options, I don't see 8e-4, but wait, the options are all in 1e-4 units, so perhaps the options are in multiples of 1e-4 m³.

Wait, the options are:

A: -1.5 --> which is -15e-4 m³

B: -0.2 --> -20e-4 m³

C: -1.0 --> -10e-4 m³

D: -2.0 -->-20e-4 m³

E: -1.2 --> -12e-4 m³

F: -0.8 --> -8e-4 m³

G: -0.6 --> -6e-4 m³

H: -0.3 --> -3e-4 m³

I: -1.7 --> -17e-4 m³

J: -0.5 --> -5e-4 m³

Wait, so 0.0008 is 8e-4, which is 0.8e-3, but none of the options match that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. The formula for fractional volume change is ΔV / V = -Δp / B. So ΔV = - (Δp / B) * V. So in this case, that's (1.6e7 / 5e9) * 0.25.

Wait, 1.6e7 is 16e6. 5e9 is 5e9. 16e6 /5e9 = (16/5) * 1e-3 = 3.2e-3. Then 3.2e-3 * 0.25 = 0.0008, which is 8e-4 m³.

So the change is -0.0008 m³, which is -8e-4 m³.

But looking at the options, none of them are -8e-4. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should compute 1.6e7 / 5e9 = 0.0032.

Multiply that by 0.25 m³: 0.0032 * 0.25 = 0.0008 m³. So the volume change is -0.0008 m³.

Wait, but the options are in 1e-4 units, so perhaps 0.0008 is 8e-4, which would be 8 times 1e-4, but the options are 1e-4. Wait, that can't be. So this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again: Using the formula for bulk modulus.

Bulk modulus B = - (Δp / ΔV) * V.

Wait, no, wait. The correct formula is B = - (Δp / ΔV) * V. So rearranged, ΔV = - (Δp / B) * V.

Wait, so that's correct. So the change is - (Δp * V) / B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it as (Δp * V) / B, but then the sign is negative. So that's correct.

Wait, let me compute Δp * V: 1.6e7 * 0.25 = 4e6.

Then divide by B: 4e6 /5e9 = 0.0008.

So that's the same as before. So the change is -0.0008 m³.

But the options are in terms of 1e-4, so let me convert 0.0008 m³ to 1e-4 units. 0.0008 is 8e-4, which is 8 * 1e-4. So the change is -8e-4 m³.

Wait, but the options are all in steps of 1e-4, like -0.5 (which is -5e-4), etc. So none of them is -8e-4. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I misremembered the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh! Wait, the formula is Δp = B * ΔV / V.

So ΔV = (Δp * V) / B.

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Did the question state that the decrease is in terms of 1e-4 m³? Or perhaps the problem expects the change in terms of 1e-4, but with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (Δp * V) / B and then scale it to 1e-4.

So (1.6e7 * 0.25) /5e9 = (4e6)/(5e9) = 0.0008 m³.

As before. 0.0008 m³ is 8e-4 m³, which is 8 times 1e-4. But the options don't have 8; they have options like -1.5, etc., which are multiples of 1e-4.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 1.6e7 is 16,000,000.

(16e6) *0.25 = 4e6.

4e6 /5e9 = (4 /5) * 1e-3 = 0.8e-3 = 0.0008 m³.

Which is 0.0008 = 8e-4. So about 8e-4 m³.

But the options don’t have 8e-4. The closest are option F (-0.8), which is -8e-4 m³. So the change is -0.0008 m³, which is option F: -0.8.

Wait, but wait, 0.8e-3 is 0.0008. Oh, right, 0.8e-3 is 0.0008. So option F is -0.8e-3, which would be -8e-4 m³. So the correct answer should be F: -0.8.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct calculation was 0.0008 m³, which is 8e-4. But 8e-4 is 0.0008, which is the same as 0.8e-3.

Looking at the options, yes, option F is -0.8. So the answer is F.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the change in volume of a fluid under pressure:

\[
\Delta V = -\frac{\Delta p \cdot V}{B}
\]

### Given Data:
- Initial volume: \( V = 0.25 \, \text{m}^3 \)
- Pressure increase: \( \Delta p = 1.6 \times 10^7 \, \text{Pa} \)
- Bulk modulus: \( B = 5.0 \times 10^9 \, \text{Pa} \)

### Step 1: Apply the formula
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta V = -\frac{(1.6 \times 10^7) \cdot (0.25)}{5.0 \times 10^9}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the calculation
First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.6 \times 10^7) \cdot (0.25) = 4 \times 10^6
\]

Now divide by the bulk modulus:

\[
\frac{4 \times 10^6}{5.0 \times 10^9} = 0.0008 \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 3: Determine the sign and magnitude
The negative sign indicates a decrease in volume, so:

\[
\Delta V = -0.0008 \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The options are given in terms of \( 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 \). Converting \( -0.0008 \, \text{m}^3 \) to this unit:

\[
-0.0008 \, \text{m}^3 = -8 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3
\]

Looking at the options, the closest match is **Option F: -0.8**.

### Final Answer:
ANSWER: F
