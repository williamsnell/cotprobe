Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.
—Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Peter the Great and his policies. Let me read the question carefully first.

The question is about what Peter the Great continued after his time in Russia. He mentioned he tried to lead but didn't have enough education and persuasion. So, I'm thinking about his major policies. 

Looking at the options, the options are from A to I. The question is asking which of these he continued after Peter the Great's time in Russia. Wait, no, actually, it's about what he continued to do during his rule. Wait, no, wait. Let me reread the question.

The question is: When Peter the Great ruled Russia, he continued the practice of which of the following?

So, the options are A to I. I remember that Peter the Great was a significant figure in Russia's history. He was a phenakist, which means he was a man of little political experience but a man of skill and influence. So, he probably didn't focus on any specific policies except what he needed to achieve his goals.

He was a military leader, but he also had some political actions. I remember reading that he introduced a constitution, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think. When he became tsar, he reorganized the Russian state. He also introduced the idea of the Russian Empire, which was a form of constitutional monarchy. But in the context of the question, when he was ruling, he was trying to change the country, so he might have introduced a constitution to establish a new political system.

Now, the options are about what he continued to do. So, he's known for his military tactics, like the Battle of St. Petersburg, but the question is about his policies. He also tried to lead and drive others forward, so he might have been promoting certain reforms. 

Option D is Democratic governance. He was a strong advocate for democracy, especially in the context of a tsar. So, he probably promoted democratic reforms, like the establishment of a parliamentary system or trying to centralize power.

Looking back, the question says he tried to lead but didn't have enough education or persuasion. So, he didn't implement a constitution, but he did promote democratic governance. Also, he was involved in education and trying to convince people, which suggests he was working towards a more democratic system.

So, the options are about what he continued to do. He established a parliament (option I). Also, he promoted democratic governance, but the options don't directly say that. The options are A to I, so I need to pick from those.

Wait, the question is about what he continued to do after Peter the Great's rule. Wait, no, the question is when he ruled, what did he continue to do? Or was it that he continued the practice of certain policies during his time? The wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, the question is phrased: "When Peter the Great ruled Russia, he continued the practice of which of the following?" So it's about what he did while he was ruling.

I remember that when Peter the Great became tsar, he introduced the Russian Empire, which was a form of constitutional monarchy. Later, he also tried to establish a parliamentary system. Also, he advocated for the use of the royal family and was involved in the establishment of the Russian Empire as a constitutional monarchy, but I'm not sure about the exact details.

Wait, another point: he was known for his military tactics, like the Battle of St. Petersburg. But the question is about policies. So, what did he do to change Russia's political system?

Another angle: he promoted the idea of serfdom and decolonization. But in the options, F is "Emancipation of serfs," and H is "Isolationism." He didn't promote decolonization, but he did promote the idea of a strong, centralized government.

Wait, but also, he was involved in the establishment of a parliamentary system in the early 1900s, which is option I. So, he established a parliament to manage the state and implement policies.

So, the options are:

A: Introduction of a constitution → I think he did introduce a constitution (the Russian Empire), but I'm not 100% sure.

B: Promoting free trade → I don't think he promoted free trade. He was more about military and political reforms.

C: Democratic governance → He promoted democratic governance, which includes parliamentary systems.

D: Decentralization of power → He was pro-centralization, so I don't think so.

E: Serfdom → Maybe, but I'm not sure if he was a pro- serf or against.

F: Emancipation of serfs → I'm not certain, but I think he was against serfdom.

G: Abolition of monarchy → He was a monarchy, and he didn't abolish it, but maybe did something else.

H: Isolationism → I'm not sure he was pro-Isolationism.

I: Establishment of a parliament → Yes, he did this.

So, options C and I are possible. But the question is about what he continued to do during his rule.

Wait, the question is about what he continued after Peter the Great ruled. But the wording is a bit confusing. Wait, no. The question says, "When Peter the Great ruled Russia, he continued the practice of which of the following?"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because he was ruling, so he's already in a position where he's in power. So perhaps the question is when he was a ruler, what did he do.

I think he did the following:

- Promoted the establishment of a parliamentary system (I)
- Encouraged the use of the royal family
- Tried to centralize power, which is part of his approach, but the option says "continued the practice," so perhaps he promoted the practice of creating a parliamentary system.

Alternatively, he also tried to change the political system, but perhaps he didn't implement a constitution. But the options don't have "promoted a constitutional monarchy," so the closest is I: establishment of a parliament.

Wait, but another thought: he was more focused on a strong, centralized government, so he set up a parliamentary system to ensure that power was concentrated. So, he continued to promote democratic governance by creating a parliament.

So, the correct answer would be I: Establishment of a parliament.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The options are about what he continued to do, so looking for a policy he implemented during his rule.

He introduced the idea of a Russian Empire, which was a constitutional monarchy. So, a constitution was introduced, which would make option A correct. But the option I is about establishing a parliament, which he did as part of his policies.

Alternatively, he also promoted the idea of a parliamentary system, which is option I.

Wait, but the options are A to I. So, which is the correct answer?

Wait, the question says, when he ruled, he continued the practice of which of the following. So, perhaps he continued to promote a parliamentary system, which would be option I.

But another angle: he was known for his military tactics and the establishment of a strong, centralized government. So, he likely promoted a parliamentary system (I) and also the idea of a strong monarchy (A), but the question is asking which he continued to do.

Alternatively, perhaps he promoted a constitutional monarchy, which would be option A.

Wait, another point: he was a military leader, so he might have promoted the idea of a strong, centralized government, but not necessarily a constitutional monarchy. So, option A would be his introduction of a constitution.

Wait, but when Peter the Great became tsar, he reorganized the Russian state, introduced the Russian Empire, which is a constitutional monarchy. So, he did introduce a constitution. So, that would make option A correct.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the options again.

The options given are:

A: Introduction of a constitution → Yes, he did this.

B: Promoting free trade → No.

C: Democratic governance → He promoted that but not necessarily as a primary policy.

D: Decentralization of power → He was pro-centralization.

E: Serfdom → No, he was pro serf.

F: Emancipation of serfs → No.

G: Abolition of monarchy → No.

H: Isolationism → No.

I: Establishment of a parliament → Yes, he did that.

So, the question is which he continued to do after Peter the Great ruled. Wait, no. When he ruled, he was in power, so what did he do? He introduced the Russian Empire (constitutional monarchy), which is option A. He also promoted a parliamentary system, which is option I.

Wait, but the question is about what he continued to do when he was ruling. So, during his rule, he did both: he introduced a constitution and set up a parliamentary system. So which option is correct?

Wait, but the options are about what he continued to do during his rule. So, perhaps he promoted the idea of a parliamentary system, which would be option I. Or, he also did an introduction of a constitution (A).

But the question says, when Peter the Great ruled Russia, he continued the practice of which of the following. So, it's about what he did as a ruler, not necessarily how he changed it.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: establishment of a parliament.

Another perspective: He was a military leader, but he also promoted the idea of a strong, centralized government. So, he tried to centralize power, and that includes creating a parliamentary system. So, option I is correct.

Alternatively, he also introduced the idea of the Russian Empire, which is a constitutional monarchy—so option A is correct.

But the question says "continued the practice of which of the following." So, the practice he continued during his rule.

Wait, another angle: The question is about what he did during his rule, not after. So, when he was ruling, he continued the practice of which policy.

So, he did introduce a constitution (A) and create a parliamentary system (I). So, which one is the correct answer?

Well, the options include both A and I. But I'm not sure which one is the intended answer.

Wait, looking up, I recall that Peter the Great was known for his military tactics and his promotion of a parliamentary system. So, perhaps I is the correct answer.

Alternatively, another thought: He also introduced the concept of the Russian Empire, which is a constitutional monarchy. So, introducing a constitution would be option A.

So, if the question is about the practice he continued, then it's about the introduction of a constitution, which is a form of political system.

Wait, but he also set up a parliamentary system. So, which of these is considered a practice he continued.

Another approach: the question is about what he continued after Peter the Great's rule. Wait, that can't be right because he was in power. So perhaps the question is about what he did while in power.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about what he did after he became king, but I think the question is about what he did during his rule.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is I: establishment of a parliament. Because he also introduced a constitution, but the question is about what he continued to do after becoming a tsar. Wait, no, he was already a tsar. So perhaps the question is about his actions after his rule, which would be the same as during his rule.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the practice he continued, meaning the policies he implemented, which include both introducing a constitution and creating a parliamentary system. So both A and I are correct, but the options don't have a choice that combines both.

Wait, the options are A to I, so perhaps the correct answer is both A and I, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the question is asking about the form of government he continued, which is the parliamentary system (I), as he was more about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: establishment of a parliament.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach: what else did he do?

He was known for his military tactics, like the Battle of St. Petersburg. He also promoted the idea of a strong, centralized government, which includes creating a parliamentary system.

So, the correct answer might be I: establishment of a parliament.

Wait, but I'm also considering that he did introduce a constitution (option A), which is also a political system. So, perhaps the correct answer is both A and I, but the options don't allow that.

Alternatively, the question might be about his most significant policy, which is the establishment of a parliamentary system (I).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about his introduction of a constitution, which is option A.

I'm a bit torn here. Let me think about another angle.

The question is about what he continued to do when he was a ruler.

I think the answer is I: Establishment of a parliament. Because he was pro-parliamentary and promoted the idea of a strong, centralized government, which includes establishing a parliamentary system.

Alternatively, the introduction of a constitution (A) is also a form of political system, but perhaps the question is about the most significant policy, which would be I.

Hmm. Another thought: he also tried to centralize power, which includes creating a parliamentary system. So, I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, but I'm also considering that he was pro-royal, so he didn't introduce a constitution, but rather a strong, centralized government. So, perhaps the answer is I.

So, given all this, I think the answer is I: Establishment of a parliament.
