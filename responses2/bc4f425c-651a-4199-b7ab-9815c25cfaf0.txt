Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a whiffle ball being tossed up and then coming back down. The question is about which statements are true regarding the motion. Let me try to think through each part carefully.

The problem says that air resistance is not negligible. So, that probably means air resistance is acting on the ball, which affects how it moves. I remember that when objects move through air, they experience air resistance, which tends to slow them down, especially when they are moving faster. But wait, in this case, the ball is moving upward and then coming down. So, let's break down each statement.

Statement I: The ball’s speed is zero at the highest point. Hmm. At the highest point, the ball should stop going up, right? Because the only force acting on it (ignoring air resistance for a moment) is gravity, which decelerates it until it stops. But wait, the question says air resistance is not negligible. So, at the highest point, is the speed zero or not?

I think that when the ball is going up, it's moving upward, but as it reaches the highest point, its velocity is zero. But wait, if air resistance is present, it might affect the speed. Wait, no. At the highest point, the vertical component of velocity would be zero, right? Because the ball stops moving upward. So, without air resistance, the speed would be zero, but with air resistance, does the speed become zero or not?

Wait, let me think again. Air resistance acts opposite to the direction of motion. So when the ball is moving up, air resistance is downward (opposite to the motion). When it's moving down, air resistance is upward. So, the net acceleration would be due to gravity minus air resistance. But wait, when the ball is moving up, the net acceleration is (g - (air resistance)). But the ball is slowing down, so the acceleration is downward. At the highest point, the ball's velocity is zero. But wait, if the ball is moving up, its speed is zero only if it's coming to a stop. So, the speed is zero, but the acceleration is still acting downward, but since it's at the highest point, the ball stops moving. So, the speed is zero, and the acceleration is still non-zero (since it's still moving in the negative direction). So statement I is true. Because at the highest point, speed is zero. Oh, wait, but wait, sometimes in such problems, people might assume that air resistance isn't a big factor, but the question says it's not negligible. So, the speed would be zero, but the acceleration isn't zero. Because acceleration is the net force divided by mass. So, the net force is gravity (mg) minus air resistance (which is some value). So, the acceleration is (mg - F_air)/m = g - (F_air/m). Since F_air is significant, but the direction is opposite to the motion. So, at the highest point, the speed is zero, but the acceleration is still acting (downward) but not zero. So statement I is true.

Statement II: The ball’s acceleration is zero at the highest point. Hmm, acceleration is the net force, so if there's a net force, the acceleration isn't zero. Wait, but when the ball is at the highest point, is the acceleration zero? Because the only force acting is gravity. Oh wait, but sometimes people make a mistake. Let's think. The net force is mg downward. So acceleration is g downward. So statement II claims acceleration is zero. So that's false. So statement II is false.

Statement III: The ball takes a longer time to travel up than to fall back down. Hmm. Without air resistance, the time up equals time down. But with air resistance, the time up is longer than time down. Because when going up, the ball is decelerated more than when coming down. So, for example, when going up, the acceleration is (mg - F_air)/m = g - a, where a is the deceleration due to air resistance. So when going up, the acceleration is less than g, but when coming down, the acceleration is (mg + F_air)/m = g + a, which is greater than g. So, the ball's speed decreases more when going up, meaning it takes longer. So statement III is true.

Now, let me look at the options. The options are statements I, II, III.

The question is which statements are true. So, I is true, II is false, III is true. So the correct statements are I and III. So looking at the options:

Option A: I & III only. That would be correct because I and III are true, II is false.

Wait, but the options are A: I and III; B: none; C: all three; etc.

So, the correct answer would be option A: I and III only.

Looking back at the options:

Options: A is I and III. So the letters are options H, I, etc. Wait, the options given are:

Options:

A: I & III only

B: None of the above

C: I, II & III

D: I & II only

E: II only

F: III only

G: II & III only

H: I & II & III

I: I only

So option A is I and III. So the correct answer is A.

So the answer is option A.

The problem involves a whiffle ball being tossed straight up, reaching a highest point, and falling back down, with air resistance not negligible. The statements to evaluate are:

1. **Statement I**: The ball’s speed is zero at the highest point.  
   - At the highest point, the vertical component of velocity is zero, but air resistance continues to act (opposite to motion). Therefore, the speed is still non-zero. Thus, **I is true**.

2. **Statement II**: The ball’s acceleration is zero at the highest point.  
   - The net acceleration is due to gravity minus air resistance (downward) during ascent and gravity plus air resistance (downward) during descent. At the highest point, the speed is zero, but the net acceleration is not zero. Thus, **II is false**.

3. **Statement III**: The ball takes a longer time to travel up than to fall back down.  
   - Air resistance reduces the deceleration during ascent (less than \( g \)) and increases it during descent (more than \( g \)). This causes the ascent to take longer than the descent. Thus, **III is true**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: I & III only.  
  - This is correct because both I and III are true.

- **B**: None of the above.  
  - Incorrect, as option A is valid.

- **C**: I, II & III.  
  - Incorrect, as II is false.

- **D**: I & II only.  
  - Incorrect, as II is false.

- **E**: II only.  
  - Incorrect, as II is false.

- **F**: III only.  
  - Incorrect, as I is true but III is also true.

- **G**: II & III only.  
  - Incorrect, as II is false.

- **H**: I & II & III.  
  - Incorrect, as II is false.

- **I**: I only.  
  - Incorrect, as III is true.

Thus, the correct answer is **A: I & III only**.
