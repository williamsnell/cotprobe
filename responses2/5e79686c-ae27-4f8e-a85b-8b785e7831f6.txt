Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4. Hmm, I need to find the value of this expression. Let me think about the order of operations, which I remember is often remembered by PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the expression, I see division and multiplication symbols. According to PEMDAS, I should do those first. Let's break it down step by step.

First, 4 ÷ 2. That's straightforward. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So I replace 4 ÷ 2 with 2. So the expression now becomes 2 • 2 + 8 − 4.

Next, there's a multiplication symbol between 2 and 2. So I do 2 multiplied by 2. 2 times 2 is 4. Now the expression is 4 + 8 − 4.

Now, the remaining operations are addition and subtraction, which I handle from left to right. So first, 4 plus 8 is 12. Then, 12 minus 4 is 8. So the result is 8.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to look at the original problem: 4 ÷ 2 is 2. Then 2 multiplied by 2 is 4. Then 4 plus 8 is 12, minus 4 is 8. Yep, that's consistent.

The correct answer is 8.

**Answer:** G: 8
