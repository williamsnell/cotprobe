Question:

A defendant and his friend were down on their luck. They decided they would make some extra cash by robbing the local liquor store. The friend didn't like guns and decided to use a toy gun, which looked like a real gun, but only shot water. The defendant was aware that the gun was not real. Their plan fixed, they walked into the liquor store late one afternoon when few customers were in the store. The friend produced the toy pistol and pointed it at the customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the clerk began to rummage behind the counter for the key to the register. While his head was ducked, the clerk pulled a shotgun from behind the counter and fired it at the defendant and his friend. The defendant dived to the side, but his friend was shot and killed. If the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death he should be found

Options:

A: guilty of felony murder.
B: not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill his friend.
D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.
E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
F: guilty of second degree murder.
G: guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
H: guilty of first degree murder.
I: guilty, because the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony when his friend was killed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this murder question. Let me read through it again.

So, the defendant and his friend decide to make some extra cash by robbing a liquor store. The friend doesn't like guns and uses a toy gun, which looks like a real gun but only shoots water. The defendant realizes the gun isn't real and his plan is fixed. They walk into the store late one afternoon with few customers. The friend brings the toy gun, points it at customers and the clerk. Then the defendant orders everyone to the floor, and the clerk starts searching for the key to the register. While ducking his head, the clerk pulls a shotgun and fires it at the defendant and friend. The defendant dives to the side, but the friend is shot and killed. The defendant is then charged with the death of his friend, and I need to determine his charge.

Hmm, I remember that murder charges usually involve intent to kill. But this is a bit different because the defendant was in the store, and the friend was the one who was shot. Wait, the defendant was the one who ordered everyone to the floor, and the friend was the one who was shot. So the defendant's action was to kill his friend, not himself.

I think this might be a case of felony murder. Because the defendant was in the store, which is a felony, and his friend was killed as a result. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact elements of felony murder.

In felony murder, the defendant must have been in the course of a felony when the killing occurred. Here, the defendant was in the store, which is a felony. He was in the store for the purpose of robbing, which is a felony. The killing happened during that time, so that fits.

Wait, but sometimes if the defendant is the co-felon, they can be convicted even of murder. So in cases where both are in the same gang or connected, that might make it a felony murder or second-degree murder.

So, the defendant was in the store, the friend was killed inside. So, two people in the same store, and the defendant is in the same store as the co-felon. So, that's a classic felony murder scenario.

Felon murder requires that the defendant was in the course of a felony and that the killing was committed with intent to kill. The intent is key here. Did the defendant intend to kill his friend?

The question says the defendant was aware the gun was not real and fixed the plan. Did he intend to kill? The question doesn't say he intended to kill, but perhaps the friend's death was such that he knew the gun was fake. But the goal is to see if the defendant's intent was enough to be guilty.

Wait, the question says the defendant is "subsequently charged with his friend's death". So the charge is murder. So I need to determine if it's felony murder, second-degree murder, etc.

But in some jurisdictions, when the two are in the same gang or connected, it's considered a felony. So the defendant is the co-felon, and both were in the same store. So, that's a felony murder charge, making the defendant guilty.

Alternatively, if the defendant was not the co-felon, but he was part of a separate gang, then it might be second-degree murder. But in this case, I think the two are co-felon. So the charge would be felony murder.

So looking at the options:

A: guilty of felony murder. That's what I thought.

B: Not guilty because the clerk justified killing the friend. Not sure, but I think the intent is crucial here.

C: Not guilty because defendant didn't intend to kill. Maybe, but the intent isn't mentioned. But perhaps the intent is implied because the friend was shot. But the question doesn't state that the defendant intended to kill. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. That sounds correct.

E: Involuntary manslaughter. That's when the killing is intentional and the force was severe, leading to death, but without intent to kill. Here, intent is unclear. The defendant's intent isn't stated, so perhaps this is not applicable.

F: Second degree murder. If it's not felony murder, maybe. But I think it's a felony.

G: Voluntary manslaughter. That's when the killing was intentional and the force was sufficient, but no intent. Again, no intent is mentioned, so perhaps not.

H: First degree murder. First degree is usually more severe than felony murder, which is usually second degree. I think H is probably not right.

I: Guilty because he was in a felony and the killing was during that time. That's similar to A and D.

So the options A and I seem to fit. But wait, the options are labeled A, I, etc. So what's the standard here?

I think that when two people are in the same store and the defendant was in the same store, and he was part of the felony, it's felony murder.

So the correct answer would be A or I.

But looking at the options, the choices are A (felon murder) and I (involuntary manslaughter).

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, when the co-felon is killed by someone in the same store, it's felony murder. So the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

So the answer is A or I. But looking back, the options are:

A: felony murder.

I: involuntary manslaughter.

So the question is, did the defendant intend to kill his friend? If not, then involuntary manslaughter applies.

Wait, the question is about whether the defendant should be found guilty. The charge is murder. So the question is, does the crime involve intent.

If the defendant intended to kill, then felony murder is correct. But if he didn't intend, then involuntary is guilty.

The question doesn't state that he intended to kill. It only states that he was aware the gun was fake and fixed the plan.

So without intent, maybe not guilty for murder.

Wait, but that's a bit ambiguous. Some states might require intent for murder. For example, in many places, first-degree murder requires intent. But felony murder doesn't require intent, just the intent to kill.

Wait, but is the killing of a co-felon considered a felony? Yes. So the elements are that the defendant was in the course of a felony and the killing was done with intent. Without intent, he's not guilty of murder but perhaps of involuntary manslaughter.

But the options don't include involuntary manslaughter. The options are A, I, etc.

So if the defendant intended to kill, then he's guilty of felony murder. But if he didn't, then he's guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

But the facts don't show that he intended to kill. The question says he "dived to the side, but his friend was killed." The intent isn't clear.

Wait, the question is about whether the defendant is found guilty. So the options are whether it's felony murder, involuntary, etc.

If the defendant intended to kill, then felony murder. If not, involuntary.

But the question is about whether the defendant is guilty of his death. So what's the correct charge?

Involuntary manslaughter is when the killing was intentional and the force was sufficient, leading to death without intent. Here, the intent isn't clear. So maybe the answer is that he's guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

But looking at the options:

F: second degree murder.

Wait, another angle: if the defendant was in the same store, the co-felon, and he was in the course of the same felony, then it's felony murder regardless of intent. So that's A.

But another thought: sometimes, when the defendant is a co-felon, they can be convicted of murder. So the correct charge would be felony murder.

So I think the answer is A: guilty of felony murder.
</think>

The defendant and his friend were both in the same liquor store, which was a felony. The defendant was in the course of a felony (robbing the store) and was responsible for his friend's death. However, the question does not explicitly state that the defendant intended to kill his friend. Without intent to kill, the killing could not be classified as felony murder, which requires intent. 

If intent was implied by the situation, the defendant may be guilty of second-degree murder. However, the question does not provide evidence of intent. Therefore, the correct charge is felony murder, as it does not require intent.

ANSWER: A
