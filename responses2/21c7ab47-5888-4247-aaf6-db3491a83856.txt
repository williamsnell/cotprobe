Okay, so I’ve got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a monopolist whose total costs are given at different output levels. The problem gives me two parts, a and b, asking about profit without and with price discrimination, respectively.

So, let me break it down. The data provided is on quantity, price, and total costs. The quantities are from 1 to 5 units. The prices decrease as the quantity increases, which makes sense for a monopolist, who is likely to set a higher price for more units. The total costs are also provided for each quantity. 

The first part, part a, is about profit without price discrimination. That means the price is set at the level that maximizes profit, which in this case is probably the profit-maximizing quantity, which is 5 units as given. So, the monopolist is presumably making the optimal decision where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

The second part, part b, is about potential profit with price discrimination. Price discrimination usually refers to charging different prices for different quantities, which allows the monopolist to capture more consumer surplus. But in this problem, part b is asking about the maximum potential profit, which I think would be when the monopolist can perfectly price-discriminate, meaning they can charge each customer the maximum they are willing to pay for each unit. However, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

Wait, the question says part b) How much profit can he potentially earn with price discrimination? So, under perfect price discrimination, the monopolist can set prices equal to the marginal benefit each customer is willing to pay. The total revenue would be the sum of the areas under the demand curve up to each quantity. But I'm not sure how to calculate that directly, so maybe it's better to think about the concept.

Wait, but maybe part a) is about the monopolist's profit when price discrimination isn't possible. So, in a typical market, the monopolist sets a single price, which is the price that maximizes profit. So, in part a, price discrimination isn't an option because the monopolist is constrained by the demand curve. Wait, no. Wait, part a is without price discrimination; part b is with price discrimination. So, part a would be the standard profit (price is fixed), part b is the potential profit if the monopolist can set different prices for each unit.

Wait, but maybe part a) is when the monopolist is forced to set a single price, and part b) is when they can set different prices. So, for part a), the monopolist is operating under the demand curve's price for each quantity. For part b), they can set prices higher than the marginal cost, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe part a) is the standard case where the monopolist sets the profit-maximizing price (which is the same price for all units), and part b) is the case where the monopolist can set different prices for each unit, effectively maximizing total revenue by charging the highest possible price for each unit. Wait, but that's not entirely clear.

Let me approach this step by step. Let's first tackle part a.

Part a) How much profit the monopolist will make without price discrimination.

In this scenario, the monopolist sets the price at the profit-maximizing level, which is 5 units. The price for 5 units is 91. So, total revenue (TR) is price multiplied by quantity. So TR = 91 * 5 = 455.

Total costs (TC) are given as $405. So profit is TR - TC = 455 - 405 = $50. So part a) is $50.

Wait, but in the options, one option is $50 and $96 (option D), but that's for part b. So, let's see what part b) is asking.

Part b) How much profit can he potentially earn with price discrimination.

Under price discrimination, the monopolist can set a price for each unit equal to the demand curve. So, the total revenue would be the sum of all individual prices. Let me think about how to compute total revenue.

The demand curve is given for each quantity. So, for 1 unit, price is 109; for 2, 105; 3, 100; 4, 96; 5, 91.

But under perfect price discrimination, the price for each unit is the highest price consumers are willing to pay for that unit. So, for the first unit, the price is $109, for the second, it's $105, third $100, fourth $96, fifth $91.

So, total revenue (TR) is the sum of all these. Let me add them up:

109 (for 1) + 105 (2) = 214

Plus 100 (3) → 314

Plus 96 (4) → 410

Plus 91 (5) → 501.

So, TR is $501.

Total costs are $405. So, profit is TR - TC = 501 - 405 = $96.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is $50 and $96, which are the answers for part a) and part b). So, the options are:

Options:

A: $70 and $110

B: $40 and $85

C: $60 and $100

D: $50 and $96

E: $30 and $75

F: $45 and $90

G: $65 and $105

H: $55 and $95

I: $75 and $115

J: $80 and $120

So, the correct answer for part a) is $50 (profit without price discrimination), and part b) is $96 (profit with price discrimination). So the correct option is D.

The question involves calculating the monopolist's profit under two scenarios: without price discrimination and with price discrimination. The data provided includes the quantity, price, and total costs (TC) for each unit. Here's the analysis:

### Part a) Profit without price discrimination:
1. The monopolist sets the price at the profit-maximizing level, which corresponds to producing 5 units.
2. The price for 5 units is **$91**, so total revenue (TR) is calculated as:
   \[
   TR = \text{Price} \times \text{Quantity} = 91 \times 5 = 455
   \]
3. Total costs (TC) are given as **$405**. Therefore, profit is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = TR - TC = 455 - 405 = 50
   \]
   So, the profit without price discrimination is **$50**.

### Part b) Profit with price discrimination:
1. Under perfect price discrimination, the monopolist charges the highest price each customer is willing to pay for each unit. This means the price for each unit is:
   - 1 unit: $109
   - 2 units: $105
   - 3 units: $100
   - 4 units: $96
   - 5 units: $91
2. Total revenue (TR) is the sum of these prices:
   \[
   TR = 109 + 105 + 100 + 96 + 91 = 501
   \]
3. Total costs (TC) remain **$405**. Therefore, profit is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = TR - TC = 501 - 405 = 96
   \]
   So, the profit with price discrimination is **$96**.

### Conclusion:
- Profit without price discrimination: **$50**
- Profit with price discrimination: **$96**

The correct option is **D: $50 and $96**.
