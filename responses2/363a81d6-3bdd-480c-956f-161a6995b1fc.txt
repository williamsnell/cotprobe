Question:

Suppose that a certain software product has a mean time between failures of 10,000 hours and has a mean time to repair of 20 hours. If the product is used by 100 customers, what is its availability?

Options:

A: 90%
B: 97%
C: 100%
D: 75%
E: 85%
F: 99%
G: 80%
H: 95%
I: 98%
J: 99.80%

Okay, so I've got this question about software product availability. Let me try to figure it out. The question gives me the MTBF and MTTR, and the number of customers. Hmm.

First, I remember that MTBF stands for Mean Time Between Failures and MTTR is the Mean Time to Repair. Availability is the percentage of time the system is operational. Oh right, it's usually calculated as MTBF divided by (MTBF + MTTR). Wait, no, wait. Or is it MTBF divided by (MTBF + MTTR) multiplied by 100? I think that's the formula.

Wait, so the formula is Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR). Let me make sure I got that right. So MTBF is 10,000 hours, and MTTR is 20 hours. So plugging those in: 10,000 divided by (10,000 + 20). That's 10,000 / 10,020. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 10,000 divided by 10,020. Let me do this division. 10,020 is approximately 10,000, so 10,000 / 10,000 is 1. But since it's 10,020, the denominator is a bit more, so the result will be slightly less than 1. Let's see, 10,020 goes into 10,000 about 0.998 times. So 1 minus 0.002 is 0.998. So 0.998 multiplied by 100% gives 99.8%.

Looking at the options, option J is 99.80%. So that should be the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up anything. No, I think that's correct. MTBF is 10k, MTTR is 20. So the denominator is 10.02k. 10,000 / 10,020 is around 0.998, so 99.8% availability.

The availability of the software product is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Availability} = \frac{\text{MTBF}}{\text{MTBF} + \text{MTTR}} \]

Given:
- MTBF = 10,000 hours
- MTTR = 20 hours

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Availability} = \frac{10,000}{10,000 + 20} = \frac{10,000}{10,020} \approx 0.998 \]

Converting to percentage:

\[ 0.998 \times 100 = 99.80\% \]

The correct answer is **J: 99.80%**.
