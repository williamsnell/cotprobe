Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. So, the question is about a specific historical event regarding Chinese policies regarding trade under the Ming Dynasty. Let me start by understanding the context provided.

The text is from the book "The Chinese are all infidels: they worship images, and burn their dead just like the [Hindus]. The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan… In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China… When we approached this city [Hangzhou], we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The Muslims are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six districts is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand… In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of Muslims, with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most honorably…"

So, this passage is from the text "Ibn Battuta, Voyages, 1332–1346 C.E." by Ibn Battuta, which is a historical text. It's about the history of China, specifically the Ming Dynasty, and discusses the religious beliefs and policies of the time.

The question is about which change in Chinese policies regarding trade occurred under the Ming Dynasty. The options are A to J, each pointing to a different policy.

I need to recall what I know about the policies of the Ming Dynasty regarding trade. The Ming was a time of significant changes in China, influenced by various factors including the scientific revolution, the rise of the printing press, and the relaxation of old religious practices.

One of the key aspects of the Ming was the relaxation of the Confucianism, which led to more openness in foreign trade. The state wanted to allow more foreign merchants to operate in the country without imposing their own regulations. This was in contrast to the earlier days where China often imposed strict taxes or imposed Confucian principles on foreign merchants.

Looking at the options, option G says the Chinese government allowed unrestricted trade throughout the country. That aligns with the idea that the Ming allowed more foreign trade, which was facilitated by relaxed Confucian policies and perhaps the opening up of trade routes.

Another option to consider is option I, which says the Chinese government imposed heavy taxes on all foreign merchants. That seems incorrect because the passage seems to support the idea that trade was unrestricted.

Option E is about abandoning Confucian principles, which seems opposite to G.

Option H suggests giving prominent roles to foreign merchants in local government, which might be related to the state's control but not directly about trade itself.

Option J says the Chinese government monopolized key resources. That doesn't seem right either.

So, the main point is that the Ming allowed more free trade. So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: The Chinese government allowed unrestricted trade throughout the country.

**Answer: G**
