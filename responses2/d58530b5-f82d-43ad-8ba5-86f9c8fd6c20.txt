Okay, so I've got this geometry question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again: "What kind of angle is formed where two perpendicular lines meet?" And then there are several options, from A to J.

Hmm, perpendicular lines. I remember that when two lines intersect at a right angle, they form something called a right angle. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the only possibility. Let me think about the definitions of different types of angles.

Right, an acute angle is less than 90 degrees, an obtuse is more than 90 but less than 180. A straight angle is exactly 180, which makes a straight line. A reflex angle is more than 180 but less than 360. Complementary angles add up to 90, and supplementary add up to 180.

So, if the lines are perpendicular, they intersect at 90 degrees. That's a right angle. So the correct answer should be option E, which is 'right'.

Wait, the question is phrased as "where two perpendicular lines meet." So yes, that point where they meet is a right angle. So the answer is E.

Other options: A is reflex—no, that's the opposite. B is complementary, which adds up to 90, not 90 itself. C is supplementary, which adds up to 180, but that's for two angles. D is zero—no, that's a straight line, not an angle. F is invisible—probably not related. G is full rotation, which is 360 degrees, irrelevant here. H is acute, too small. I is straight, which is 180, not 90. J is obtuse, which is more than 90 but under 180.

So yeah, the only correct answer is E, right angle.

The correct answer is E: right.
