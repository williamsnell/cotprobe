Question:

During the years 1886 through 2000 there were an average of 8.7 tropical cyclones per year, of which an average of 5.1 became hurricanes. Assuming that the probability of any cyclone becoming a hurricane is independent of what happens to any other cyclone, if there are five cyclones in one year, what is the probability that at least three become hurricanes?

Options:

A: 0.586
B: 0.345
C: 0.621
D: 0.313
E: 0.528
F: 0.412
G: 0.701
H: 0.274
I: 0.658
J: 0.789

Okay, so I've got this probability question here about tropical cyclones becoming hurricanes. Let me try to break it down. The question says that from 1886 to 2000, there were on average 8.7 tropical cyclones each year, and out of those, 5.1 became hurricanes on average. So the probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane is 5.1 divided by 8.7? Let me calculate that. 

5.1 ÷ 8.7 is approximately 0.586. Oh wait, that's like a 58.6% chance each cyclone becomes a hurricane. But wait, the question says that the probability of any cyclone becoming a hurricane is independent of another. So each cyclone has a 0.586 chance, and the events are independent. 

The question is asking for the probability that at least three out of five cyclones become hurricanes. So I need to find P(at least 3 hurricanes) when there are five cyclones. Since each is an independent event, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. 

In a binomial distribution, the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, hurricanes) is given by the formula:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and n is the total number of trials.

Here, n=5, p=0.586. We need P(3) + P(4) + P(5).

Calculating each term individually might be tedious, but maybe I can compute each one step by step.

Let me compute each term:

First, P(3):
C(5,3) = 10
p^3 = (0.586)^3 ≈ 0.586 * 0.586 = 0.343, then *0.586 ≈ 0.343 * 0.586 ≈ 0.2015
(1-p)^(5-3) = (0.414)^2 ≈ 0.1714
So P(3) = 10 * 0.2015 * 0.1714 ≈ 10 * 0.03453 ≈ 0.3453.

Next, P(4):
C(5,4) =5
p^4 = (0.586)^4 = (0.586^2)^2 ≈ (0.343)^2 ≈ 0.1176
(1-p)^1 = 0.414
P(4) =5 * 0.1176 * 0.414 ≈5 * 0.0486 ≈0.243.

Wait, let me recalculate that. 0.343^2 is actually 0.1176, right. So 5 * 0.1176 = 0.588, multiplied by 0.414: 0.588 *0.414≈0.243.

Wait, no, wait. Because (1-p) here is 0.414, and it's raised to the (5-4)=1. So 5 * 0.1176 * 0.414 ≈5 * 0.0486 ≈ 0.243. Hmm, that seems right. 

Wait, or did I make a mistake in the exponents? Let me check: 0.586^4 is (0.586²)² = (0.343)² ≈ 0.1176. So P(4) = C(5,4) * (0.586)^4 * (0.414)^1. So 5 * 0.1176 * 0.414 ≈ 5 * 0.0486 ≈ 0.243. 

Then, P(5):
C(5,5)=1
p^5 = (0.586)^5 = 0.586^4 * 0.586 ≈ 0.1176 * 0.586 ≈ 0.0688
(1-p)^0=1
So P(5)=1 * 0.0688 *1= 0.0688.

Now, summing them all up: P(3)+P(4)+P(5) = 0.3453 + 0.243 + 0.0688 ≈ 0.6571.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.658, which is about 0.658. So that's the closest. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Wait, wait a second. When I calculated P(3), I had 10 * 0.2015 * 0.1714. Let me recalculate 0.2015 * 0.1714. 0.2 *0.17 is 0.034, but exact numbers: 0.2015 * 0.1714 = let me compute it step by step.

0.2015 * 0.1714: 

= (0.2 + 0.0015) * (0.1 + 0.07 + 0.0014)

Wait, maybe a better way is to multiply 2015 * 1714 and then adjust the decimal places. That's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps I'll just compute it as:

0.2015 * 0.1714 ≈ 0.03453.

So 10 * 0.03453 ≈ 0.3453.

Then P(4): 5 * (0.586^4) * 0.414.

Wait, 0.586^4: as computed earlier, 0.586^2 ≈ 0.343, squared gives 0.1176. So 5 * 0.1176 = 0.588, times 0.414 is 0.588 *0.414. Let me compute that: 0.588 * 0.4 = 0.2352, 0.588 * 0.014 ≈ 0.00823. So total ≈ 0.2352 + 0.00823 = 0.24343.

So P(4)≈0.2434.

P(5): 0.586^5. Let me compute 0.586^5.

We have 0.586^4 = 0.1176, so 0.1176 * 0.586 ≈ 0.0688.

So, adding up: 0.3453 + 0.2434 + 0.0688 = 0.3453 + 0.2434 is 0.5887, plus 0.0688 is about 0.6575.

So approximately 0.6575, which rounds to 0.658. Looking at the options, option I is 0.658. So the answer should be I.

The probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane is approximately 58.6% (0.586). Using the binomial formula, the probability of at least three hurricanes out of five is calculated by summing the probabilities of exactly 3, 4, and 5 hurricanes. Each term is computed as follows:

- **P(3):** 10 * (0.586)^3 * (0.414)^2 ≈ 0.3453
- **P(4):** 5 * (0.586)^4 * (0.414)^1 ≈ 0.2434
- **P(5):** 1 * (0.586)^5 ≈ 0.0688

Summing these gives approximately 0.3453 + 0.2434 + 0.0688 ≈ 0.6575, which rounds to 0.658.

**Answer: I: 0.658**
