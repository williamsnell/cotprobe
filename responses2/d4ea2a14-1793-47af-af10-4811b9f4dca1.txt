Okay, so I have this problem here about seniors going to graduate school. Let me read it again to make sure I get it right.

The question says that approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go on to attend graduate school. There are 750 seniors at the college, and I need to find out how many would be expected to attend graduate school. The options are A to J, so I'll look at them once I figure out the answer.

Hmm, so first, the ratio is 2 out of 5. That means for every 5 seniors, 2 go to grad school. I think I can model this with a fraction. So the fraction of seniors going to grad school is 2/5.

To find the number, I can multiply the total number of seniors by this fraction. So, 750 * (2/5). Let me compute that. 

Let me think: 750 divided by 5 is 150, because 5 times 150 is 750. So, 2/5 of 750 is the same as 2 times 150, which is 300. So the expected number is 300 seniors.

Looking at the options, option J is 300 seniors. So the answer should be J. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mess up the calculations. 

Alternatively, I can think of it as 2/5 * 750. Let's do it step by step. 5 goes into 750 how many times? 5 * 150 = 750, so 750 /5 is 150. Then, 2 times that is 300. Yep, that still gives me 300. So I'm confident it's 300, which is option J.

The expected number of seniors who attend graduate school is calculated by multiplying the total number of seniors by the fraction that goes to grad school. 

Number of seniors: 750  
Fraction: 2/5  
Calculation: 750 * (2/5) = 300  

Answer: J: 300 seniors
