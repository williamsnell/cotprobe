Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The problem says that Alfred and Ben are both considering asking Charlene to the school prom. The probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72. The probability that both ask her is 0.18. And the probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6. I need to find the probability that Ben asks her.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving two people, it's often useful to think about the union and intersection of their events. Let me denote:

Let A be the event that Alfred asks Charlene, and B be the event that Ben asks Charlene. So, we have:

P(A) = 0.6
P(B) = ? (this is what we need to find)
P(A ∪ B) = 0.72
P(A ∩ B) = 0.18

Wait, the question is about P(B), the probability that Ben asks. So, I think I can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events. The formula is:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

We know all the values except P(B), so we can plug them in and solve for P(B).

Plugging in the numbers:

0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18

Wait, let me compute that. 0.6 minus 0.18 is 0.42. So:

0.72 = 0.42 + P(B)

So, subtracting 0.42 from both sides gives P(B) = 0.72 - 0.42 = 0.30. Hmm, so that would make P(B) equal to 0.30.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. P(A ∪ B) = 0.72. P(A) is 0.6, P(B) is 0.3, and their intersection is 0.18. Plugging into the formula: 0.6 + 0.3 - 0.18 = 0.72. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the probability that at least one asks is 0.72. So, the chance that neither asks is 1 - 0.72 = 0.28. So, P(neither) = 0.28.

Alternatively, since P(A) is 0.6, P(neither) = 1 - P(A) = 0.4 when considering only Alfred. But since there are two people, maybe that's not directly applicable. But I think the initial formula approach is correct.

Wait, another approach: The probability that neither asks is 1 - P(A ∪ B) = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28.

But wait, is that the same as (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) when events are independent? No, that's not correct because independence isn't given here. So, that approach isn't valid. So the first method is better.

So, I think the correct probability that Ben asks is 0.30, which is option H. Wait, looking back at the options, let's see:

Options are labeled A to J, with H being 0.3. So the answer should be H.

The probability that Ben asks Charlene is 0.30.
