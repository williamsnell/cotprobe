Question:

Say the incidence of a disease D is about 5 cases per 100 people (i.e., P(D) = 0.05). Let Boolean random variable D mean a patient “has disease D” and let Boolean random variable TP stand for "tests positive." Tests for disease D are known to be very accurate in the sense that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, and the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97. What is P(D | TP), the posterior probability that you have disease D when the test is positive?

Options:

A: 0.0495
B: 0.02
C: 0.05
D: 0.1
E: 0.99
F: 0.635
G: 0.078
H: 0.25
I: 0.97

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the incidence of a disease D is about 5 cases per 100 people. So that's like a probability, right? So P(D) is 0.05. That makes sense because 5 divided by 100 is 0.05.

Then, there's a Boolean random variable D, which I think just means it's true or false. Wait, no, the correct notation for a binary variable is maybe p(D) or P(D), but the question uses P(D) so I'll go with that. TP stands for "tests positive." So the question is asking for the posterior probability P(D | TP), which is the probability that you have the disease given that the test is positive. I remember this is Bayes' theorem.

The problem also gives the accuracy of the tests. When you have the disease, the probability of testing positive is 0.99. So that's the true positive rate, or sensitivity. And the probability of testing negative when you don't have the disease is 0.97, which is the true negative rate. Wait, but wait. The problem says "the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97." So that's 1 - P(TP negative | no D) = 0.97. So P(TN | ~D) = 0.97. So P(TP | no D) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03. That's the false positive rate.

So I need to find P(D | TP) using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' formula is P(D | TP) = [P(TP | D) * P(D)] / P(TP). 

So let's compute each part.

First, P(D) is 0.05, given.

P(TP | D) is the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease, which is 0.99.

Now, the denominator P(TP) is the total probability of testing positive. This can happen in two ways: either you have the disease and test positive, or you don't and test positive. So P(TP) = P(TP | D) * P(D) + P(TP | ~D) * P(~D).

We know P(D) is 0.05, so P(~D) is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.

P(TP | D) is 0.99, so 0.99 * 0.05 = 0.0495.

P(TP | ~D) is 0.03, so 0.03 * 0.95 = let's calculate that. 0.95 * 0.03 = 0.0285.

So P(TP) is 0.0495 + 0.0285. Let's add those: 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078.

So now, putting it all together: P(D | TP) = (0.99 * 0.05) / 0.078.

Calculating numerator: 0.99 * 0.05 is 0.0495.

So 0.0495 divided by 0.078. Let me do that division. 

Hmm, 0.0495 / 0.078. Let's see, both divided by 0.003 gives 16.5 / 26. Which is the same as 165 / 260. Hmm, maybe a better way is to compute 0.0495 ÷ 0.078.

Wait, 0.078 * 0.635 is 0.078 * 0.6 = 0.0468, 0.078 * 0.035 = 0.00273. Adding those gives 0.04953, which is approximately 0.0495. So 0.635 is the result.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.635, so that's the answer.

To determine the posterior probability \( P(D | TP) \), we apply Bayes' theorem. Given:

- \( P(D) = 0.05 \),
- \( P(TP | D) = 0.99 \),
- \( P(TP | \neg D) = 0.03 \),
- \( P(\neg D) = 0.95 \).

First, calculate \( P(TP) \):
\[
P(TP) = P(TP | D) \cdot P(D) + P(TP | \neg D) \cdot P(\neg D) = (0.99 \cdot 0.05) + (0.03 \cdot 0.95) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078.
\]

Then, apply Bayes' formula:
\[
P(D | TP) = \frac{P(TP | D) \cdot P(D)}{P(TP)} = \frac{0.0495}{0.078} = 0.635.
\]

Thus, the posterior probability is **0.635**.
