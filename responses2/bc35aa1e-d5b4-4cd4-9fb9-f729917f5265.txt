Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about intermediaries and their rights in market distribution. The sentence says that intermediaries are given exclusive rights to market the good or service within a defined territory, using a limited number of intermediaries. The options are A through J, each with a different term.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that intermediaries are people or companies that help businesses reach their customers by bridging the gap between a producer and a consumer. So, when a company wants to distribute a product, they usually hire intermediaries to handle logistics, marketing, and other steps.

The key part here is the term "exclusive rights." So, it's not that each intermediary has their own market, but rather that intermediaries as a group have the ability to market within a certain territory. Which options fit that description?

Looking at the options:

A: Selective. That means they choose which intermediaries to use, but maybe not all.
B: Exclusive. This means each intermediary is given the exclusive right, which doesn't seem right because intermediaries might have a collective agreement.
C: Concentrated. This sounds more like a few key players, but it's not exactly what's described.
D: Comprehensive. This implies a full coverage, but it's not about the number of intermediaries.
E: Specific. Not sure what that means in this context.
F: Direct. That could mean direct sales, but intermediaries are intermediaries, not directly involved.
G: Restricted. Maybe limited in some way, but not exactly what the question says.
H: Intensive. That usually relates to effort, like a lot of resources, but not relevant here.
I: Limited. This could mean fewer intermediaries, but the question says a very limited number, not just a few.
J: Extensive. That would mean many, which isn't fitting because the term is about exclusive rights within a defined territory.

Wait, the question says "exclusive rights to market the good or service within a defined territory." So the term used here is "exclusive rights," which refers to the collective ability of a group of intermediaries. The concept that matches this is "Concentration," but wait, no. Alternatively, the term that describes being given exclusive rights is "Exclusive," but I'm not sure if that's the correct term for intermediaries.

Wait another thought. The term "Concentration" might refer to having many, but the question is about exclusive rights, which would be "Exclusive." But wait, the options don't have "Exclusive" with a prefix? Let me check the options again:

Options are:

A: Selective.

B: Exclusive.

C: Concentrated.

D: Comprehensive.

E: Specific.

F: Direct.

G: Restricted.

H: Intensive.

I: Limited.

J: Extensive.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me look at the original question again. Oh, right, the options are labeled A to J, with each being a different term.

So, the correct term for intermediaries being given exclusive rights to market within a defined territory is "Concentration," but wait, no, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps "Concentrated" is the right term. Because "Concentrated" would mean having many, but that's about the number of intermediaries. Alternatively, "Restricted" might not fit.

Wait, another angle. The term "Concentration" isn't an option. Let me see the options again. Options are A: Selective, B: Exclusive, C: Concentrated, D: Comprehensive, E: Specific, F: Direct, G: Restricted, H: Intensive, I: Limited, J: Extensive.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think about what "exclusive rights" means. It means each intermediary has the right to handle their own marketing within a certain territory. That's not exclusive to a group, but rather each intermediary has rights.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is "Concentrated." For example, in some market structures, intermediaries are concentrated, but that's when there are many. Alternatively, exclusive rights could be called "Exclusive".

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the structure of the sentence. The sentence says intermediaries are given exclusive rights to market within a defined territory. So it's about the number of intermediaries they can use. It's not that each intermediary has exclusive rights, but that together, they have the ability to market.

So the term would be "Concentrated" because they are limited in the number of intermediaries. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's "Concentrated" because they are a limited number, but the term in the options is "Concentrated," which is an option. So the correct answer would be C: Concentrated.

Wait, no, the term in the options is C: Concentrated. So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C: Concentrated. This term refers to the limited number of intermediaries that can market within a defined territory, each having rights to handle their own marketing within that area. 

Answer: C
