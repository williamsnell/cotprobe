Okay, so I need to figure out which item is useful for removing ink stains. Let me think through this. 

First, I'm going to go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Hair spray. Hmm, I don't think hair sprays are typically used for removing ink. They're more for conditioning or styling hair. 

Option B: Butter. Butter is a cooking ingredient, usually used in spreads or for cutting in baking. I don't think it's used for cleaning or removing ink. Maybe in baking, but not for inks.

Option C: Toothpaste. Toothpaste is mainly for cleaning teeth, so I don't think it helps with ink. It's probably for making a toothpaste, not cleaning inks.

Option D: Baking soda. Baking soda is used in baking as an additive, like in baking soda cookies or salt-and-ink recipes. It's used to neutralize acids, but does it remove ink? I'm not sure. Maybe in some cleaning products, but I don't think it's a common one for inks.

Option E: Nail polish. Nail polish remover is a thing. It's a common household item. It would help remove the polish, including any ink or residues. So that's a possibility.

Option F: Olive oil. Olive oil is used in cleaning, perhaps in some cleaning products. But I don't recall it being a common item for removing ink. It might help with cleaning, but not specifically for removing ink.

Option G: Coffee grounds. Coffee grounds are used in brewing coffee, maybe for cleaning some things. But I don't think they're used for removing ink.

So, looking at the options, E: nail polish seems like the best fit. It's a common item used to remove residue, including ink.
