Question:

A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?

Options:

A: Spongy
B: Posterior
C: Intramural (pre-prostatic)
D: Prostatic
E: Proximal
F: Penile
G: Bulbous
H: Anterior
I: Membranous
J: Distal

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, here's the scenario: A 32-year-old man is in the emergency department 30 minutes after being hit by a car on his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On exam, he has bruising of the perineum and pain with the pelvis movement. Also, blood is noted in the urethral meatus. No other trauma. Then, an X-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus, and a retrograde urethrography is done.

The question is about where the urethra risk is highest.

Hmm, I remember that the urethra can be divided into different types based on their position. Let's think about the options given.

The options are: Spongy, Posterior, Intramural (pre-prostatic), Prostatic, Bulbous, Anterior, Membranous, Distal, and the penile part. Wait, Penile is not an option here, so that's maybe irrelevant.

I think the seminal regions of the urethra are categorized based on whether they're superior or inferior. From what I recall, the superior seminals are the ones that can form a slit for urine when the urethra is fully open. The inferior seminals are closer to the urethral opening and can cause barriers.

In this case, the fracture is in the superior pubic ramus. Wait, the superior pubic ramus is part of the pubic bone, not the urethra. The urethral meatus is the part of the urethra that's near the urethral opening, probably in the penile area. So the injury here is in the superior pubic ramus, which is part of the pubic bone. That probably means the fracture is in the seminal region of the urethra. But wait, the question is about where the risk is highest.

Retrograde urethrography is done. That method is used to evaluate for urethral disorders, like discontinuities or stones. The results are typically a series of dots or bands along the urethral surface.

The main thing here is that the fracture is in the superior seminal region. So, the proximal seminals (those closer to the opening) are more at risk of injury. Because when you have a fragment, it's more likely to cause a blockage in the proximal seminals.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J. The question is about where the risk is greatest.

So, in the superior seminals, I think the proximal ones (like the upper seminals) are the ones at greater risk. But I need to make sure.

Wait, I remember that in the superior seminals, the proximal ones (near the opening) are more prone to injury because the fragment can cause a blockage there. The inferior seminals are more affected because they can form barriers and are more prone to blockage.

So, the proximal seminals (like the upper ones) are at higher risk.

Looking at the options, which of these is proximal? The options are A to J.

Looking at the options, the first part is "proximal" or "anterior" or "posterior"?

Wait, the options are:

A: Spongy
B: Posterior
C: Intramural (pre-prostatic)
D: Prostatic
E: Proximal
F: Penile
G: Bulbous
H: Anterior
I: Membranous
J: Distal

Wait, so the proximal part is E: Proximal.

Wait, but another angle: the urethral meatus is near the opening, so the injury is in that area. If the injury is in the superior seminals, where would the risk be? The proximal seminals are more likely to be injured.

So the correct answer should be E: Proximal.

The question involves a 32-year-old man struck by a car while riding a motorcycle, resulting in severe pelvic pain. On exam, he has bruising of the perineum and pain with movement of his pelvis, along with blood in the urethral meatus. The superior pubic ramus is fractured, and a retrograde urethrography is performed.

To determine the greatest risk for injury in the urethra, it's important to consider the position and type of injury. The superior seminals are the areas near the urethral opening, and a fragment in the superior seminals can cause a blockage. The proximal seminals (those closer to the urethral opening) are more at risk due to the potential for injury from the fragment.

Analyzing the options, the proximal seminals are identified as option E: Proximal. This is the correct answer because the injury in the superior seminals (proximal) is most likely to cause significant blockage and injury.

ANSWER: E
