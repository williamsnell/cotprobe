Alright, so I've got this probability question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a game where two players take turns tossing a fair coin, and the first to toss a head wins. I need to find the probability that the first player wins. The options are from A to J, with each being a fraction.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down. Since it's a turn-based game with two players, the first toss goes to Player A, then B, then A, and so on. The game continues until either A or B gets a head.

I remember that in probability problems like this, especially with turns, we can model it using an infinite series. Because each toss has a 50% chance of being heads or tails, and the game could potentially go on indefinitely. But since the coin is fair, the probability of heads is the same as tails each time, so the game should have a certain probability that the first player can win.

Let me think: the first player can win on the first toss, or if both first and second toss tails, then the first player gets another chance, and so on. So the probability of the first player winning is the sum of the probabilities of all their possible winning scenarios.

Mathematically, that would be:

P(A wins) = P(A wins on first toss) + P(B tails) * P(A wins on second toss) + P(B tails) * P(A tails) * P(A wins on third toss) + ... and so on.

Breaking it down, the first term is straightforward: P(A wins on first toss) is 1/2, since it's a fair coin.

The second term is the probability that A gets a tail (which is 1/2) times B getting a tail (another 1/2), then A has another chance to win. So that's (1/2)*(1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^3.

Similarly, the third term is (1/2)^5, because it's A tails, B tails, A tails, B tails, and then A wins. So each subsequent term is (1/2)^(2n+1) where n is the number of full rounds (each round being A then B).

So the probability P(A wins) is the sum of a geometric series where the first term is (1/2) and the common ratio is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, let me write that out:

P(A) = 1/2 + (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) + (1/2)^3*(1/2)^2 + ... 

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Each time, after both players fail to get a head, the game starts over. So after the first round, the probability that A wins on the third toss is (1/2)^3. Because each toss is independent.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first player (A) can win on the first toss with probability 1/2. If A doesn't win (1/2 chance), then B gets a chance. B has a 1/2 chance to win, so if B doesn't win either, then the game goes back to A. So the probability that A wins on their second toss is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^3.

Similarly, the probability that A wins on their k-th toss is (1/2)^{2k-1}. Because each round A gets a toss, then B, so for A's k-th toss, there have been (2k-1) tosses (A and B each got k-1 tosses, then A again). So the probability is (1/2)^{2k-1}.

So the total probability is the sum from k=1 to infinity of (1/2)^{2k-1}.

Alternatively, factor out (1/2):

P(A) = (1/2) * [1 + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^4 + (1/2)^6 + ... ]

That's a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the ratio less than 1. So the sum here is 1 / (1 - 1/4) = 1/(3/4) = 4/3.

So P(A) = (1/2) * (4/3) ) = 2/3.

Wait, that can't be right because when I think about it, the first player should have a higher chance than the second. For example, in a 50-50 game, the first player has a 2/3 chance of winning. So that makes sense.

Let me cross-verify. Another way to think about it is that each round, the probability that the game continues is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. So the game can be seen as a series of rounds where each round may end with someone winning or the game continuing. So the first player has a first chance, then if not, the second, then back to the first, and so on.

Alternatively, the probability that the first player wins is 1/2 (their first toss) plus (1/2)*(1/2) [both tails] times the probability that the first player wins from that point. Wait, but that would make P(A) = 1/2 + (1/2)^2 * P(A), which would imply P(A) = 1/2 + (1/4)P(A). Solving for P(A): P(A) - (1/4) P(A) = 1/2 → (3/4) P(A) = 1/2 → P(A) = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3. Same result. So that's correct.

So the probability that the first player wins is 2/3, which is option H.

The probability that the first player wins the game can be calculated by considering the infinite series of possible outcomes where the first player wins on their first toss, second toss, and so on. Each round consists of both players tossing tails, which happens with probability (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The probability that the first player wins is the sum of the probabilities of them winning on each subsequent round, which forms a geometric series. Solving this series gives the first player a 2/3 chance of winning.

Answer: H: 2/3
