Okay, so I've got this problem about a solid cylindrical shaft. Let me see what it says. The shaft's diameter is 2 inches, length is 18 inches. It's transmitting power at 45 horsepower at 1500 rpm. The modulus of rigidity is 14e6 psi. I need to find the shear stress and the torsional deflection. And then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that for torsion problems, there are some formulas. Let me think. The shear stress in a circular shaft is given by the formula τ = (T * r) / J, where T is the torque, r is the radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia. Oh right, and the polar moment J for a solid cylinder is (π * d^4)/32, where d is the diameter.

Wait, but first I need to find the torque T. Oh, because power is given as 45 hp at 1500 rpm. Oh right, power in horsepower can be converted to torque. The formula is power (hp) = torque (lb-ft) * speed (rpm) / 5252. So I can rearrange that to find torque.

Wait, let me get the units right. Torque in lb-ft. So, power (hp) = (T * N) / (5252), where N is revolutions per minute. Wait, or wait, N is in rpm, so the formula is T = (power * 5252) / N.

Wait, let me think carefully. The formula is: Power (in horsepower) = (Torque (lb-ft) × RPM) / (5252). So Torque T = (Power × 5252) / RPM.

So, 45 hp is the power. So T = (45 * 5252) / 1500. Let me compute that. 45 *5252 is... Let me compute 5252 *45. 5000*45=225000, 252*45=11340 → 225000 +11340=236340. Then divide by 1500: 236340 /1500 = 157.56 lb-ft. So T is approximately 157.56 lb-ft.

Wait, let me double-check that. Wait 45 hp to torque: 45 * 5252 = 236340. Divide by 1500 rpm: 236340 / 1500 = 157.56 lb-ft. Yes.

So torque T is 157.56 lb-ft. Now, I need to find the shear stress τ.

Shear stress formula: τ = (T * r ) / J.

Wait, J is the polar moment. For a solid cylinder, J = π d^4 / 32. Because d is diameter, so radius is r = d/2. So since J is (π d^4)/32, this is correct.

r is the radius, so r = 1 inch, since diameter is 2 inches. Wait, 2 inches diameter, so radius is 1 inch. So r = 1 in.

Now, let me compute J. J = π (1)^4 /32 = π /32 = approx 0.0981745 in^4.

But wait, the units need to be consistent. Because T is in lb-ft, and shear stress is in psi, which is force per area (lb/(in²)).

Wait, yes. So, let's plug into τ formula.

τ = T * r / J.

But T is in lb-ft, r in inches, J in in^4. So, T is 157.56 lb-ft. But wait, the formula expects T in lb-in or something else?

Wait, let me think about the units. T in lb-ft. r is inches, J is in^4. So let's compute the units.

T is (lb-ft) * (in) / (in^4) → (lb * ft * in) / in^4 → (lb * ft) / in^3?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the formula correctly. The formula is τ (in lb/in²) = (T (lb-ft) * r (in)) / J (in^4). Because T has units lb-ft, J in^4. So when I multiply T * r, I get lb-ft * in. Then divide by J (in^4) → (lb-ft * in) / in^4 → (lb * ft * in) / (in^4) → this is (lb * ft) / (in^3). But psi is lb/in², so I need to convert this.

Wait, but perhaps I should convert T to lb-in instead of lb-ft. Let me think.

Wait, 1 lb-ft is equal to 12 lb-in. Because 1 ft = 12 in, so 1 lb-ft = 1 lb * 12 in = 12 lb-in.

So T in lb-in would be 157.56 lb-ft * 12 = 157.56 *12 = 1890.72 lb-in.

Then, τ = (T * r) / J → (1890.72 lb-in * 1 in) / (π * 1^4 /32 in^4) → (1890.72 *1) / ( (3.1416) /32) in^4.

Wait, let me compute denominator: π * (1)^4 /32 = 3.1416 /32 ≈ 0.0981745 in^4.

So numerator is 1890.72 lb-in².

Wait, wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate τ in terms of lb-in^2? Let me see.

Wait, the formula is τ = (T * r) / J.

But T is in lb-ft, so let me write it in lb-in.

157.56 lb-ft = 157.56 *12 = 1890.72 lb-in.

Then J is in in^4, so J is pi * d^4 /32 → d is 2 in, so d^4 is 16.

So J = pi * 16 / 32 = pi/2 ≈ 1.5708 in^4.

So τ = (1890.72 lb-in * 1 in) / (pi/2 in^4) → (1890.72 *1) / (1.5708) ≈ ?

Wait, 1890.72 / 1.5708 ≈ let me compute that.

1.5708 * 1200 ≈ 1885 → 1200 *1.5708 = 1885. So 1890.72 is a bit more than 1200, perhaps 1200.5 or so.

Wait, 1200 *1.5708 = 1885. So 1890.72-1885=5.72. 5.72 /1.5708≈3.64. So approximately 1203.64 psi.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 1300 psi, option C is 1204 psi, which is close. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate:

T = 157.56 lb-ft = 157.56 *12 = 1890.72 lb-in.

J = pi * (2)^4 /32 → because d is 2. So 16pi /32 = pi/2 ≈ 1.5708 in^4.

So tau = (1890.72 * 1) / (1.5708) → 1890.72 /1.5708.

Wait, 1.5708 is approximately pi/2. So 1890.72 / (pi/2) = 1890.72 * 2/pi ≈ (3781.44) / 3.1416 ≈ let's compute that.

3.1416 × 1200 = 3769.92.

3781.44 -3769.92=11.52.

11.52 /3.1416≈3.68.

So 1200 +3.68 ≈1203.68 psi. So approximately 1204 psi, which matches option C. So option C's shear stress is 1204 psi. So that's a lead.

Now, the second part is the torsional deflection θ. The formula for the angle of twist in radians is θ = (T * L) / (J * G), where G is the modulus of rigidity.

Wait, but again, T is in lb-in, L in inches, J in in^4, and G is psi (lb/in²). So units would be (lb-in) * in) / (in^4 * psi) → (lb-in^2) / (in^4 psi) → (lb) / (in psi) → since psi is lb/in², this would be (lb) * in² * in² / (in^4 psi) → (lb * in²) / (in² psi) → (lb)/(psi) → which is dimensionless, as it should be. So the calculation should work.

So let's compute θ.

We have T = 1890.72 lb-in, L =18 in, J = pi/2 ≈1.5708 in^4, G=14e6 psi.

So θ = (1890.72 * 18) / (1.5708 *14e6 )

Compute numerator: 1890.72 *18.

1890 * 18 = 34020, 0.72*18=12.96 → total 34032.96.

Denominator: 1.5708 *14e6 = 220e6 (approximate? Let me compute accurately.

14e6=14,000,000.

1.5708 *14e6= approx 1.5708 *14 *1e6.

14 *1.5708 = 21.9912. So 21.9912e6.

So denominator approx 21,991,200.

So θ ≈ 34032.96 / 21,991,200 ≈ approx 0.001545 radians.

Wait, but to get degrees, we need to convert radians to degrees. Since 1 radian is 57.2958 degrees.

So θ (degrees) = θ (radians) * (57.2958).

So 0.001545 *57.2958 ≈ 0.0887 degrees.

Wait, but let me do exact calculation.

Numerator: (1890.72)(18) = 34032.96.

Denominator: (pi/2) *14e6 = (3.1416/2)*14,000,000 → (1.5708)*14e6 = 22,000,000 + 1.5708*14e6 ?

Wait, 1.5708 *14e6 = 1.5708 * 14 million.

14e6 = 14,000,000 → 1.5708 *14,000,000 = 1.5708 *1.4e7 → 1.5708 *1.4 = 2.200, so 2.200e7 → 22,000,000.

Wait, no, 1.5708 *14e6 = 14e6 *1.5708 = 22,000,000. No, wait, 14e6 is 14,000,000, so 14e6 *1.5708 is 22,000,000? Let me compute 14,000,000 * 1.5708.

14,000,000 *1 =14,000,000.

14,000,000 *0.5=7,000,000.

14,000,000 *0.07= 980,000.

14,000,000 *0.0008= 11,200.

So adding up: 14e6 +7e6=21e6, plus 980,000 →21,980,000, plus 11,200 → 21,991,200.

So denominator is 21,991,200.

So numerator is 34032.96.

θ radians =34032.96 / 21,991,200 ≈ 0.001545 radians.

Now, to convert to degrees: 0.001545 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.001545 * 57.2958 ≈ 0.0887 degrees.

Looking at the options, option B says deflection is about 0.110 degrees. Hmm, but I got 0.089, which is about 0.090, which is 0.090 degrees, which is option C's deflection? Wait, option C says 0.089 degrees.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for the angle.

Wait, another approach: the formula for θ is (T * L) / (G * J). Let me compute that again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula.

Shear deflection formula: θ (radians) = (T * L) / (G * J).

Wait, wait, another version of the formula is θ = ( T * L ) / ( G * J ), but J is the polar moment. So I think I did that correctly.

Wait, T is 1890.72 lb-in, L=18 in, G=14e6 psi, J = pi/2 in^4.

So (1890.72 *18) = 34032.96. Multiply by 18 gives 34032.96.

Denominator: (14e6) * (pi/2) = 14e6 * 3.1416 /2.

14e6 * 3.1416 = 43.9824e6. Then divided by 2 → 21.9912e6.

So 34032.96 / 21.9912e6 = 0.001545 radians.

0.001545 radians * (180/pi) ≈ 0.001545 * 57.2958 ≈0.0887 degrees.

So approximately 0.089 degrees, which is option C's deflection. So option C has a shear stress of about 1204 psi and a deflection of approximately 0.089 degrees.

Looking at the options again:

A: shear 1300, deflection 0.095

B: shear 1500, deflection 0.110

C: shear 1204, deflection 0.089

D: shear 950, deflection 0.075

So option C's shear stress is 1204, which matches my calculation, and the deflection is 0.089, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the deflection was about 0.089, which is option C.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the shear stress and torsional deflection for a solid cylindrical shaft using the given parameters:

1. **Determine the torque (T):**  
   The power (P) is related to torque and speed (rpm) by:  
   \[
   P = \frac{T \cdot N}{5252}
   \]  
   Rearranging for torque:  
   \[
   T = \frac{P \cdot 5252}{N}
   \]  
   Substituting \( P = 45 \, \text{hp} \), \( N = 1500 \, \text{rpm} \):  
   \[
   T = \frac{45 \cdot 5252}{1500} = 157.56 \, \text{lb-ft}
   \]  

2. **Convert torque to inch-pound (lb-in):**  
   \( 157.56 \, \text{lb-ft} = 157.56 \times 12 = 1890.72 \, \text{lb-in} \).

3. **Calculate shear stress (\( \tau \)):**  
   The formula for shear stress in a solid cylinder is:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{T \cdot r}{J}
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \( T = 1890.72 \, \text{lb-in} \)  
   - \( r = 1 \, \text{in} \)  
   - \( J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32} = \frac{\pi (2)^4}{32} = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5708 \, \text{in}^4 \)  

   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{1890.72 \cdot 1}{1.5708} \approx 1204 \, \text{psi}
   \]  

4. **Calculate torsional deflection (\( \theta \)):**  
   The formula for the angle of twist in radians is:  
   \[
   \theta = \frac{T \cdot L}{G \cdot J}
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \( T = 1890.72 \, \text{lb-in} \)  
   - \( L = 18 \, \text{in} \)  
   - \( G = 14 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \)  
   - \( J = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5708 \, \text{in}^4 \)  

   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \theta = \frac{1890.72 \cdot 18}{14 \times 10^6 \cdot 1.5708}
   \]  
   Numerator: \( 1890.72 \cdot 18 = 34032.96 \).  
   Denominator: \( 14 \times 10^6 \cdot 1.5708 = 22,000,000 \).  
   \[
   \theta = \frac{34032.96}{22,000,000} \approx 0.001545 \, \text{radians}
   \]  

   Convert radians to degrees:  
   \[
   \theta (\text{degrees}) = 0.001545 \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 0.0887^\circ
   \]  

5. **Final Answer:**  
   Comparing with the options:  
   - Shear stress: \( \tau \approx 1204 \, \text{psi} \)  
   - Torsional deflection: \( \theta \approx 0.089 \, ^\circ \)  

   The correct option is **C**.
