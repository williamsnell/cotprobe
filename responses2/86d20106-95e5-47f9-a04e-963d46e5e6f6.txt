Okay, so I have this question about personnel selection and the term "adverse impact." Hmm, I remember hearing about this concept before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to piece it together.

The question is asking what "adverse impact" means in the context of personnel selection. The options are A through J, each describing different scenarios. I think I should go through each option and see which one fits.

First, I recall the definition of adverse impact. I think it has to do with whether a protected group is being unfairly selected or not. So, if a group that's protected (like a racial or gender group) is being hired at a lower rate than a non-protected group, that's considered adverse impact. Or maybe it's the opposite depending on how it's phrased.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "the total selection process results in equal results for all groups covered by law." Wait, that sounds like it's saying there's no adverse impact. Because if it's equal, that doesn't mean there's a problem. So A might not be right.

Option B: "a group covered by law is hired at a rate more than 80% of that of the group with the best selection." Hmm, if a group is hired at 80% or more of another's rate, that's a big difference. That doesn't ring a bell as the definition I remember. I think the benchmark is usually 50% or something, not 80%. So B might be incorrect.

Option C: "adverse conditions exist for selection of groups covered by law." This seems to frame the issue as the selection conditions being adverse. That sounds like it's talking about the circumstances affecting the selection, which is part of the definition. But I'm not sure if that's the most precise term.

Option D: "a group not covered by law is hired at a higher rate than that of the group with the best selection." Wait, does that mean that non-protected groups are getting hired more? That would be bad if it's a protected group. So D says the non-protected group is hired at higher rate than the best (so the best group is the one with the highest rate). If the best is the non-protected group, then this would mean the protection group is worse. That might be the definition of adverse impact, but I'm not sure.

Option E: "a group covered by law is hired at a rate less than 80% of that of the group with the best selection." If the best group is, say, 100%, the covered group is less, like 50%. That's a big difference but doesn't necessarily mean it's adverse impact. It depends on how it's compared. I think the standard benchmark is 50%, not 80%, so E might not be correct.

Option F: "a group not covered by law is hired at a rate less than 80% of that of the group with the best selection." So the non-protected group is hired at less than 80% of the best. That seems similar to option D, but phrased differently. I'm not sure which is correct.

Option G: "the total selection process results in unequal results for one or more groups covered by law." This sounds like it's saying there is a disparity, which could be due to adverse impact. But the wording might not be the exact definition. I think it's more about the term itself.

Option H: "selection interviews are “adverse” for groups covered by law and result in differential selection rates." I don't remember this being the precise definition. The term "adverse" here might not be the standard one used in this context.

Option I: "adverse conditions exist for selection of groups not covered by law." That's saying that the hiring process has adverse conditions, which affects non-protected groups. So it's a general statement about the conditions, which is part of the definition.

Option J: "selection interviews are “favorable” for groups covered by law and result in differential selection rates." That sounds opposite, saying the groups are favored, which would be bad if it's about adverse impact.

Wait, I think I remember that the key aspect of "adverse impact" is that it's a difference in selection rates between protected and non-protected groups, especially a significant one (like 50% or more). The definition often states that a protected group is "unfairly" selected at a lower rate than the non-protected group.

So looking back, option C says "adverse conditions exist for selection of groups covered by law." That seems to describe the fact that the conditions are adverse, which is part of the definition. But the option itself is phrased as a statement about the process. So the definition is about the adverse conditions, not necessarily the outcome.

Option G is a broader statement that says there's unequal results for one or more groups, which could be due to adverse impact. But G's wording is a bit vague.

Option D says non-protected groups are hired at a higher rate than the best. Wait, the best selection would be the non-protected group, so D says that they are hired less than that, which would be bad. That's a big difference. But I thought the standard benchmark is 50%, not 80%. So maybe E or D are incorrect.

Wait, the original definition I know is that adverse impact occurs when a group is selected less frequently than would be expected, relative to the group with the best selection rates. The rate difference must be at least 50% or more.

So looking at the options, option G says "unequal results for one or more groups covered by law," which could be true if one group is selected more. That's one possibility, but it could include cases where the difference is less than 50%, which would still be a problem but not as severe as adverse impact.

Alternatively, option E says a group covered by law is hired at less than 80% of the best. That's a big drop, like 20% less. That's a significant disparity, more than the 50% standard, so E would indicate that there's a problem.

Wait, but the definition of adverse impact is that the protected group is selected less than the rate of the non-protected group, and the difference must be at least 50%. So option E is a stronger statement. That is, the covered group is hired at 80% or less of the best, which would imply that the non-covered group is being hired at 100% (if E is saying the covered is 20% of the best). So if the best is 500, the covered is 100, and the non-protected is 500. So the covered is 100, non-covered 500. So the difference is 400, which is a big disparity.

So if a group is hired at 20% of the best, that's a big problem. That's similar to option E, but phrased as "covered group is hired less than 80% of the best." So E would imply a 20% difference.

But the definition of adverse impact requires that the difference is at least 50%. So if it's less than 50%, it's not considered adverse impact. So option D or G could be correct.

Wait, but the options are about what "adverse impact" means. So the correct term is that it's a difference in rates, and if that difference is at least 50%, it's a problem.

So option G says that it's "unequal results for one or more groups covered by law." That could be true, but it's a broad statement. It doesn't specify the disparity. Option E is a specific scenario where the covered group is hired at less than 80% of the best, meaning the non-covered is at 100% and covered at 20%. That's a big disparity.

So which one is the correct definition? I think the standard definition is that adverse impact occurs when a group is selected less frequently than would be expected, and the difference must be at least 50%. So the total selection process would have unequal results for one or more groups, which is option G.

But wait, another thought: I remember that the definition sometimes is phrased as "if a group is selected at a rate less than 50% of the group with the best selection rate." So in that case, option E would be correct.

Wait, the original question is about the meaning of "adverse impact." So the possible options are E and G.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try another approach. The definition I learned is that adverse impact occurs when a group is hired less frequently than the group with the best selection rate, and the difference must be at least 50%. So if a group is hired at 20% of another's rate, that's a big disparity, which is a serious concern.

So option E: "a group covered by law is hired at a rate less than 80% of that of the group with the best selection." That would mean the non-covered group is being hired at 100%, and the covered is 20% of that. So 20% of the best. The difference would be huge, which would indicate a problem.

So option E would be correct as a condition for adverse impact.

But another thought: I think the term "adverse impact" is often used to refer to situations where the selection is disproportionately favoring protected groups. So the correct definition would involve the disparity being at least 50%, which is E's condition.

Wait, but option G says "unequal results for one or more groups covered by law." That's a broader statement. It could include cases where the disparity is less than 50%, but those would still be a problem. So the definition of adverse impact is more specific than that.

Wait, but another point: perhaps the definition is that the group is selected at a rate less than the rate of the non-protected group by at least 50%. So the correct conditions would be that the covered group is less than the non-covered group's rate by at least 50%. So option E would indicate that because 20% is a big drop.

So option E is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The definition I remember is that adverse impact occurs when a group is selected at a rate less than the rate of the group with the best selection, and the difference must be at least 50%. So that would align with option E.

Alternatively, another source I recall says that adverse impact is when the group is selected at a rate less than the rate of non-protected groups by at least 50%. So that would match E.

Wait, but option D says "a group not covered by law is hired at a higher rate than that of the group with the best selection." That would mean the non-protected group is better, which is not the case for adverse impact. So D is not correct.

So the correct answer would relate to a group being selected less than the best by a significant margin. So option E: the covered group is hired at less than 80% of the best.

So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: "selection interviews are “favorable” for groups covered by law and result in differential selection rates."

**Explanation:**

The term "adverse impact" in personnel selection refers to a situation where a protected group is selected at a significantly lower rate than the non-protected group. The key criteria for adverse impact are a significant disparity (at least 50%) and a difference in selection rates between two groups. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because it suggests equal results for all groups covered by law, which does not define adverse impact.
- **Option B** is incorrect as it describes a high disparity (more than 80%) but does not align with the standard benchmark of 50% for adverse impact.
- **Option C** describes adverse conditions but does not specify the disparity, making it a broader statement.
- **Option D** is incorrect because it suggests a non-protected group is hired at a higher rate than the best, which would not be considered adverse.
- **Option E** correctly identifies a covered group being hired at a rate less than 80% of the best group, indicating a significant disparity and thus a potential adverse impact.
- **Option G** is too broad and does not specify the disparity, making it less precise than E.
- **Option H** and **Option I** are incorrect because they describe adverse conditions for non-protected groups and are not the standard definition.
- **Option J** is incorrect because it describes favorable selection for protected groups, which is the opposite of adverse impact.

Thus, the correct definition aligns with E, reflecting a significant disparity in selection rates.
