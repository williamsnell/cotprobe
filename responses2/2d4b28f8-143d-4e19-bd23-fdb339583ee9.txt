Question:

A virus is spreading throughout the population of a town, and the number of people who have the virus doubles every 3 days. If there are 1,000 people in the town, and 10 people have the virus on January 1st, what is the earliest date at which the entire town would be infected with the virus, given that there are 365 days in a year, and 31 days in the month of January?

Options:

A: February 10th
B: January 28th
C: January 10th
D: March 1st
E: January 15th
F: January 31st
G: March 10th
H: January 21st
I: February 21st
J: February 1st

Okay, so I have this question about a virus spreading in a town. Let's see what it says. The virus spreads so that every 3 days, the number of infected people doubles. There are 1000 people in the town, and on January 1st, 10 people are infected. I need to find out the earliest date when the entire town is infected.

Hmm, so the number of infected people doubles every 3 days. That sounds like exponential growth. Let me think about how to model this. The formula for exponential growth is N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/T), where N0 is the initial number, t is the time, and T is the doubling time.

In this case, N0 is 10, and T is 3 days. The goal is to reach N(t) = 1000.

So, let me write that equation:

10 * 2^(t/3) = 1000

I need to solve for t. Let's divide both sides by 10.

2^(t/3) = 100

Now, take the logarithm of both sides. Since it's base 2, maybe using log base 2 is easier.

log2(2^(t/3)) = log2(100)

Simplify the left side:

t/3 = log2(100)

What's log2(100)? Well, 2^6 is 64, and 2^7 is 128. So log2(100) is between 6 and 7.

Wait, log2(100) can be calculated as ln(100)/ln(2). Let me compute that.

ln(100) is about 4.605, ln(2) is about 0.693. So 4.605 / 0.693 ≈ 6.644.

So, t/3 ≈ 6.644 → t ≈ 3 * 6.644 ≈ 19.932 days.

So approximately 20 days needed for the number to reach 1000.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes approximations can be tricky. Alternatively, I can compute 2^6 =64, 2^7=128. 64*10=640, 128*10=1280. Oh wait, 1000 is between 640 and 1280. So the time would be between 6 and 7 doublings.

But in the formula, t is 3 days per doubling. So 6 doublings would be 6 *3=18 days, giving 10 *64=640. Then 7 doublings: 10 * 128=1280. Wait, but our target is 1000, which is more than 640 and less than 1280. So it happens between 18 and 21 days, but the question says "the earliest date at which the entire town would be infected." So the earliest date when it's 1000 or more.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the number of people who have the virus doubles every 3 days." So every 3 days, the number doubles. So on day 0 (January 1st), 10 people. Then day 3: 20, day 6:40, day9:80, day12:160, day15:320, day18:640, day21:1280. Wait, 1280 is over 1000, so about 21 days after Jan 1st.

Wait wait, but wait, wait. Wait, 10 in Jan 1, then day 3 is 20, day6 40, day9 80, day12 160, day15 320, day18 640, day21 1280. So on day21, 1280, which is more than 1000. So the earliest date would be 21 days after Jan 1, which would be January 22nd. But wait, let me check.

Wait wait, wait another thing. Let me think again. Because the number of infected people doubles every 3 days. So each 3-day period, it doubles. So starting from Jan 1, 10 people.

Day 1: Jan 1, 10.

Day 4 (Jan 4): 20.

Day 7 (Jan 7): 40.

Day 10 (Jan10):80.

Day13 (Jan13): 160.

Day16 (Jan16): 320.

Day19 (Jan19): 640.

Day22 (Jan22): 1280. So wait, on Jan22, the number is 1280, which exceeds 1000. So the entire town would be infected on Jan22nd.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A: February 10th (which is about 51 days after Jan 1), J: February 1st (52 days), H: Jan21st, etc.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's Jan22nd. But none of the options is Jan22. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation. Because perhaps I missed something.

Wait, 1000 is the target. The formula is 10*(2)^(t/3) = 1000.

Divide both sides by 10: 2^(t/3) = 100.

Take log base 2 of both sides: t/3 = log2(100).

log2(100) is approximately 6.644. So t = 3 *6.644 ≈19.932 days, which is about 19.93 days.

Wait, that's about 6 days and 22 hours. So 19.93 days after Jan 1 is Jan1 + 19 days plus 22 hours, which would be Jan21st (19 days) plus 22 hours.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the date calculation.

Jan 1 is day 0. So day 1 is Jan 2, day 2 Jan 3, etc. So 19 days after Jan1 is Jan20. Because day 0 is Jan1, day1 is Jan2, ..., day19 is Jan20.

Wait, but 19.93 days is about 19 days and 0.93 days. 0.93 days is about 22.5 hours. So 19 days and 22.5 hours after Jan1.

Jan1 is day 0. 19 days later is Jan20 (day19). Plus 22.5 hours is 22 hours and 12 minutes. So Jan20 is 22:00, adding 22h12m would be Jan21 at 4:12 am.

Wait, no, wait: Jan1 is day 0. So Jan1 plus 19 days is Jan20. So adding 22h12m, which would be Jan20 22:12, which is 20th at 10pm +22h12m = 21st at 4:12 am.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if Jan1 is day 0, then day1 is Jan2, day2 Jan3, etc. So day19 is 19 days after Jan1, which is Jan20.

Wait, so 19.93 days is about 19 days and 22 hours. So 19 days after Jan1 is Jan20. Then 0.93 days is about 22h. So adding that to Jan20 would be 22h after Jan20, which is Jan20 22:00, and then 12 minutes, so Jan21 4:12 am. So that's Jan21st at 4:12 a.m., which is 19.93 days after Jan1.

But wait, the options don't include Jan21st. Let me look back at the options:

Options:

A: February 10th

B: January 28th

C: January 10th

D: March 1st

E: January 15th

F: January 31st

G: March 10th

H: January 21st

I: February 21st

J: February 1st

Wait, option H is January 21st.

Wait, so according to my calculation, the earliest date is Jan21st at 4:12 am, which would be option H.

But wait, why did I earlier think it's Jan22nd? Because I might have miscalculated the number of doublings. Wait, let me redo the calculation.

t = 3 * log2(100) → 3 *6.644≈19.932 days. So 19.93 days is about 19 days and 22 hours.

So 19 days after Jan1 is Jan20, right? Because:

Jan1 is day 0.

1 day: Jan2

...

19 days: Jan20.

Then, 0.93 days is 22.5 hours. So 22h after Jan20 is 22:00 (10pm), which is Jan20, which is 20th. Adding 22h 12m, it's 21st at 4:12 am.

Wait, but 19.93 days is about 19 days and 22 hours. 19 days brings us to Jan20, and 22h brings us to Jan21.

Wait, wait, no. Because 19 days after Jan1 is Jan20. So 19 days is Jan20. So 19.93 days is 19 days plus 0.93 days, which is 22h.

So Jan20 + 22h is Jan21 at 4:12 am.

So the earliest date when the entire town (1000 people) is infected is January 21st.

So the correct answer would be option H: January 21st.

But wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are in the problem:

Looking back, the options are:

A: February 10th

B: January 28th

C: January 10th

D: March 1st

E: January 15th

F: January 31st

G: March 10th

H: January 21st

I: February 21st

J: February 1st

So option H is January 21st.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me check the calculation again. Because sometimes in these problems, the initial day is considered day 0 or day1.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the number of infected people each day, but that's time-consuming, but perhaps it's better.

Number of people: 10.

After 3 days: 10*2=20.

After 6 days: 40.

After 9 days: 80.

After 12 days: 160.

After 15 days: 320.

After 18 days: 640.

After 21 days: 1280.

So, 1000 is reached between 18 and 21 days. So the earliest date when it's 1000 is 21 days after Jan1, which is Jan21. So the correct answer is H: January 21st.

Wait, but the options include H as January 21st. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but looking back, the initial calculation thought it was 19.93 days, which is about 20 days, making it Jan20, but that's not correct because the number doubles only after 3 days. So perhaps the number is 1000 reached on the 21st day.

Wait, no, because each doubling happens every 3 days. So the process is: every 3 days, the number doubles. So in 3 days, from Jan1 to Jan4, it doubles once. So the number of doublings is t/3, which is 19.932 days.

Each doubling happens at 3,6,9,... days.

So t=19.932 days would be 19 days and 22h, which is Jan20 plus 22h → Jan21st.

So option H: January 21st is correct.
</think>

To determine the earliest date when the entire town of 1,000 people is infected, we use the exponential growth model: **N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/T)**, where \( N0 = 10 \), \( T = 3 \) days, and \( N(t) = 1000 \). Solving for \( t \):

\[
10 \cdot 2^{t/3} = 1000
\]

\[
2^{t/3} = 100
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:

\[
t/3 = \log_2(100) \approx 6.644
\]

\[
t \approx 3 \cdot 6.644 \approx 19.932 \text{ days}
\]

This is approximately 19 days and 22 hours. Starting from January 1, adding 19 days brings us to January 20, and adding 22 hours brings us to January 21. Therefore, the entire town is infected by January 21st.
