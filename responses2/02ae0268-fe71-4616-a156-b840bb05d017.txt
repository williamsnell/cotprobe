Question:

A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Increase the dosage of corticosteroids
B: Begin amphotericin therapy
C: Increase the dosage of cyclosporine
D: Perform a second kidney transplant
E: Discontinue all medications and monitor the patient's condition
F: Begin ganciclovir therapy
G: Begin interferon therapy
H: Decrease the dosage of cyclosporine
I: Decrease the dosage of corticosteroids
J: Begin acyclovir therapy

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the patient is a 42-year-old man with malaise, muscle pain, joint issues, and high temperature for three days. He had a renal transplant three months ago, and now he's getting cyclosporine and corticosteroids. His leukocyte count is high at 2700/mm³, but his serum creatinine is 0.8, which is normal. The cyclosporine is in the therapeutic range. 

Looking at the biopsy, there's intracellular inclusion bodies. I remember that those are markers of inflammation, like in kidney function. Inflammation in the kidney can cause issues, perhaps leading to infection or rejection.

So, the question is about the next step in management after these treatments. Let me think about what's going on here. He got transplants, which usually means his kidneys were functional, but the fact that he's getting cyclosporine and corticosteroids might suggest he's not completely rejecting them. But if the kidney shows inflammation (inclusion bodies), that could indicate some functional issues.

Wait, but wait. His leukocyte count is 2700, which is high. High leukocytes usually indicate a lot of inflammation. But if the kidney is showing inclusion bodies, which are a sign of active inflammation, perhaps the kidneys are still functional but need more support.

So, the treatments are cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Cyclosporine is for managing the bone marrow, and corticosteroids help with inflammation, like in infections. But if the kidney is showing inflammation (inclusion bodies), perhaps the treatment isn't sufficient. Also, the fact that it's in the therapeutic range suggests it's being used, but maybe not enough.

What's the next step? The options are increasing the dose of steroids, starting amphotericin, increasing cyclosporine, second kidney transplant, discontinuing medications, or starting a different treatment.

I remember that if there are functional inflammation and the kidneys are still working, sometimes they can tolerate the treatments but need a strong support. Also, high leukocyte counts (like 2700) might indicate some infection or functional disease, but the kidney shows signs of inflammation, so maybe it's more about supporting the current treatments.

In some cases, when the kidneys are showing functional issues (like functional rejection), the treatment might need to be adjusted. But in this case, the patient's treatments are already cyclosporine and steroids. If the kidney shows inflammation, maybe increasing the dose of the steroids would help, but sometimes you need to increase the dose if the current one isn't enough.

Wait, but option A is "Increase the dosage of corticosteroids." If the patient is on 1.6 mg/dL, maybe they need more. Also, if the current dose isn't enough, increasing it might help reduce his symptoms.

Alternatively, the other options. If the kidney isn't completely rejecting, maybe a second transplant is needed, but the question says he's receiving the treatments and the biopsy is showing something. Also, the other options like interferon (probably not in the question), interferon is more about infections.

Wait, interferon is more about infections, so probably not. Ganciclovir is a vianilbin used for kidney infection, but that's a different indication. Acyclovir is an antiviral, but the patient's symptoms are more about inflammation, not viral.

So, back to the options. The issue is that the kidney shows inflammation (inclusion bodies), so maybe the current treatments are not sufficient. But if the patient is on cyclosporine and steroids, and the level is therapeutic, perhaps they need more.

Alternatively, if the treatment isn't sufficient, increasing the dose could help reduce the inflammation. So, option A is increasing the dosage of corticosteroids. But wait, what if the current dose isn't enough? Maybe the patient's functional status is impaired, so they might need more.

But another possibility is that when the kidneys are showing functional issues (like functional rejection), sometimes the treatments need to be adjusted. Like, if the patient is on steroids, perhaps they need to add more, or start a different approach.

Wait, but in this question, the patient is receiving and managing the treatments. The biopsy shows functional issues, but the current treatments are in the therapeutic range. Maybe the next step is to increase the dosage of the current treatment.

Another option is to consider a second kidney transplant if the first one isn't working. But the question doesn't suggest that. It says he's receiving these treatments, so perhaps the current ones are sufficient but not enough. Or maybe the patient is on a different treatment, and the body isn't responding well.

Wait, another angle: if the patient's leukocyte count is high, but the kidney shows functional issues (like functional rejection), the treatment might need to be adjusted. But in this case, the medications (cyclosporine and steroids) might be sufficient, but perhaps the patient's functional status isn't fully rejected. So maybe they need a second transplant. But the question doesn't specify.

Alternatively, the patient's functional status is impaired, and the treatments aren't enough. So the next step would be to increase the dosage of the current treatments. So option A is "Increase the dosage of corticosteroids." Another option is to increase the dosage of cyclosporine, but that's not what's in the question; the current dose is in the range.

Wait, the question says the current serum cyclosporine is in the therapeutic range. So if they're on cyclosporine, perhaps it's not enough, so increasing it would help. But wait, some treatments might require a dose, and maybe the patient's body isn't responding, so they might need a bigger dose.

Alternatively, when the body is on an antibody treatment like cyclosporine, sometimes you need to increase the dose. So option A is to increase that.

Another thought: sometimes if the kidneys are functional but showing inflammation, the patient might benefit from a stronger support, which can be achieved by increasing the dose of the current treatment. So if the current dose is insufficient, add more. So the next step is to increase the dosage of the existing treatment.

Looking at the options, option A says to increase the dosage of corticosteroids. So that could be the right step.

Another possibility: maybe the patient needs to start amphotericin, but I don't think that's standard. Amphotericin is for infections.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, when the body is on a supportive treatment like steroids and cyclosporine, but functional issues, the patient might need to start a second treatment. But the options don't include that, so I think it's not an option.

So, the most likely next step is to increase the dosage of the current treatment (corticosteroid), so the answer is A.
</think>

The patient is a 42-year-old man with malaise, muscle and joint pain, elevated temperature, and has been treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows functional inflammation (inclusion bodies), and the leukocyte count is high (2700/mm³). The current serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. 

Given the functional inflammation in the kidney and the need for support, the most appropriate next step is to increase the dosage of the existing treatments. Increasing the dosage of corticosteroids could help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Other options, such as interferingon therapy or discontinuing medications, are less likely given the current treatment regimen and the patient's functional status.
