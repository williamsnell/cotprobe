Okay, so I'm trying to figure out who discovered the first virus. Hmm, I remember that viruses are the most common infectious agents, but their discovery has a long history. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A to J, each a scientist. I'll go through each one.

Option A: Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. He was a Dutch scientist known for his work in microbiology. He did some experiments with microorganisms, but I think he didn't discover viruses. His work was more about seeing microorganisms and their properties.

Option B: Jonas Salk. I think he's the one who developed the polio vaccine. But wait, was that the first discovery of a virus? No, because he didn't study the virus itself. He probably knew about the polio virus and the vaccine, but he didn't discover it himself. His discovery was later attributed to other scientists, I believe.

Option C: Edward Jenner. He was a physician and made the first vaccine for smallpox. He used animal experiments, which led to the first vaccine, but again, he didn't discover the virus itself. He discovered the vaccine, though.

Option D: Louis Pasteur. He was a microbiologist, and he discovered pasteurization, which is a method to kill bacteria. But he didn't discover the first virus. He worked on maintaining safe food production.

Option E: Charles Chamberland. He's a bacteriologist. He discovered the Shigella bacteria, which was the first bacterial disease. So, he discovered the first living virus, Shiga toxin. So E could be the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought that was the case. Wait, I remember that Chamberland's work was the first to detect a pathogenic bacteria. So, yes, E is correct. So the answer is E.

The correct answer is E: The bacteriologist Charles Chamberland discovered the first living virus.

Answer: E
