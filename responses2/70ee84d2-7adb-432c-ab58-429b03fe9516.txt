Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So the equation is 35 divided by something equals 7. I need to find the number that makes this true. Hmm, let's see. 

So the equation is 35 divided by a number equals 7. Let me write that down: 35 / x = 7. I need to find x. How do I solve for x here? Oh right, I can rearrange the equation. If I multiply both sides by x, that would give me 35 = 7x. Then, to find x, I can divide both sides by 7. 

Let me do that step by step. So, 35 divided by 7 is x. Wait, 35 divided by 7 is 5 because 7 times 5 is 35. So x should be 5. Let me check: 35 divided by 5 equals 7. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 5. So that should be the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me double-check. Yes, 35 divided by 5 is indeed 7. So the correct choice is A.

The equation 35 / x = 7 can be solved by multiplying both sides by x and then dividing by 7, yielding x = 5. The correct answer is **A: 5**.
