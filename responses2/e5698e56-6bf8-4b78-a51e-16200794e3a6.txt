Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says that thorium-234 decays at a rate proportional to the amount present. So, the model they're using is dQ/dt = -rQ, where r is the decay rate. We know that initially, there's 100 mg, and after one week, it's 82.04 mg. We need to find the decay rate r.

Hmm, I remember that this is a first-order differential equation. The solution to this should be an exponential decay function. The general solution is Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-rt), where Q0 is the initial quantity. Alternatively, it can also be written as Q(t) = Q0 * (1 - r*t) if r is small. But wait, that's an approximation. Since the question gives a specific time and a specific amount, I should probably stick with the exponential decay formula.

So, given Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-rt). We're told that at t = 1 week, Q = 82.04 mg. Q0 is 100 mg. So plugging those values in:

82.04 = 100 * e^(-r * 1 week)

I need to solve for r. Let's rewrite that equation:

e^(-r) = 82.04 / 100

82.04 divided by 100 is 0.8204. So,

e^(-r) = 0.8204

To solve for r, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln(e^(-r)) = ln(0.8204)

Simplify the left side: -r = ln(0.8204)

So, r = -ln(0.8204)

Wait, but the natural log of a number less than 1 is negative. So r will be positive, as required.

I need to compute ln(0.8204). Let me think about what that value is. I don't remember it off the top of my head, so I'll approximate it or maybe use a calculator. Since I'm simulating this in my head, I'll think about the ln of 0.8. Ln(0.8) is approximately -0.2231, because e^(-0.2231) ≈ 0.8. Similarly, ln(0.82). Let me see, if I remember that ln(0.8) is -0.2231. Let's compute the derivative of ln(x) around x=0.8. The derivative is 1/x. So, at x=0.8, the slope is 1/0.8 =1.25. The change in x from 0.8 to 0.82 is +0.02. So, the approximate change in ln(x) is approximately (1.25)(0.02) = 0.025. Therefore, ln(0.82) ≈ ln(0.8) + 0.025 → -0.2231 + 0.025 ≈ -0.1981. So, ln(0.8204) is approximately -0.1981.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because the exact value of ln(0.8204) might be a bit higher than -0.1981.

Alternatively, I can use a more precise approximation method. Let's consider that ln(0.8204) = ?

Let me consider that 0.8204 is 82.04/100, which is 0.8204. Let me think about the Taylor expansion around x=0.8 for e^x, but maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, using the fact that ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x^2/2 - x^3/3 - ... for small x. Let me set x = 0.18, so 1 - x = 0.82. So, ln(0.82) ≈ -0.18 - (0.18)^2/2 - (0.18)^3/3.

Wait, but 0.18 is 18%, so maybe that's a decent approximation.

Compute each term:

First term: -0.18

Second term: -(0.18^2)/2 = -(0.0324)/2 = -0.0162

Third term: -(0.18^3)/3 = -(0.005832)/3 ≈ -0.001944

Adding these: -0.18 -0.0162 = -0.1962, then -0.001944 gives -0.198144.

So, ln(0.82) ≈ -0.198144, which is approximately -0.1981. So, going back to our equation:

r = - ln(0.8204) ≈ 0.1981.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me clarify: ln(0.8204) is approximately -0.1981, so r = - (-0.1981) = 0.1981 per week.

Wait, but wait, the question says "dQ/dt = -r Q", so the decay rate is r, which is the positive constant. So, r is approximately 0.1981 per week. But the answer options are in terms of per day, since the question mentions "day^-1" as the unit. So, I need to convert weeks to days.

Because 1 week = 7 days. So, the time t is 7 days. So, the rate r in per week is actually (r_day) = r_week / 7.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The given decay is per week. So, the decay rate r is per week. But the options are per day. So, I need to convert the weekly r to per day.

So, if r is 0.1981 per week, then per day, it's 0.1981 /7 ≈ 0.0283 per day.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 0.02828 day^-1, which is approximately 0.0283. So, that would be our answer.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my earlier steps.

We had:

82.04 = 100 * e^(-r *1), where t is 1 week, which is 7 days.

So, e^(-r *7) = 82.04 /100 = 0.8204.

Taking natural log:

-r *7 = ln(0.8204) → r = - (ln(0.8204))/7.

Wait, earlier I had it as r = -ln(0.8204), but that was for 1 week. Oh, wait no: the equation was e^(-r*1) = 0.8204. So, ln(e^(-r *1)) = ln(0.8204) → -r *1 = ln(0.8204) → r = - ln(0.8204) → ~0.1981 per week.

But r is per week, so to get per day, divide by 7, as I did before.

So, 0.1981 /7 ≈ 0.0283 per day.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.02828 day^-1, which is about the same.

Wait, but let me calculate ln(0.8204) more precisely. Let me compute ln(0.8204) using a calculator if possible, but since I don't have a calculator here, I'll proceed with that.

Alternative approach: let me compute ln(0.8204) using the expansion I used earlier, but perhaps it's better to think of it as:

ln(0.8204) = ln(1 - 0.1796).

But maybe another approach: since e^0.1981 is approximately 1.219, which is the inverse.

Wait, let's see. e^0.1981 ≈ 1.219.

Because e^0.2 is approximately 1.2214. So, e^0.1981 is about 1.219. So, e^0.1981 ≈ 1.219 → 1/1.219 ≈ 0.8204, which confirms that ln(0.8204) ≈ 0.1981.

So, our calculation is correct. Thus, r (per week) is 0.1981.

But the question is in terms of per day, so we divide by 7.

0.1981 /7 ≈ 0.0283.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.02828 day^-1, which is very close. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculation.

Wait another approach: perhaps the decay is modeled as Q(t) = Q0 * (1 - r * t), but I think that's only an approximation when r is small. In our case, the time is 1 week, and the decay is significant (from 100 to 82), so that approximation may not be valid. So, the exponential model is more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can compute ln(0.8204) with more precision.

Let me think about the Taylor expansion for ln(x) around x=0.8. Alternatively, I can use the natural logarithm table approach.

Wait, another way is to use the fact that ln(0.8) is approximately -0.22314, as I thought earlier. Then, compute the derivative of ln(x) at x=0.8, which is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So, the change in ln(x) when x increases by a small delta x can be approximated as delta_x / x.

But here, x is 0.8204. So, delta x is 0.0204.

So, the approximate change in ln(x) is (0.0204)/0.8 = 0.0255.

So, ln(0.8204) ≈ ln(0.8) + 0.0255.

Which is -0.22314 + 0.0255 ≈ -0.19764.

So, that's about -0.19764.

So, r would be 0.19764 per week.

Divided by 7 gives 0.028235 per day.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.02828, which is very close. So, that would be the correct choice.

To determine the decay rate \( r \), we start with the exponential decay model:

\[
Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-rt}
\]

Given:
- Initial quantity \( Q_0 = 100 \, \text{mg} \)
- Quantity after 1 week (\( t = 7 \, \text{days} \)) is \( Q(7) = 82.04 \, \text{mg} \)

Substitute these values into the equation:

\[
82.04 = 100 e^{-7r}
\]

Divide through by 100:

\[
e^{-7r} = 0.8204
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-7r = \ln(0.8204)
\]

Solve for \( r \):

\[
r = -\frac{\ln(0.8204)}{7}
\]

Using approximations, \( \ln(0.8204) \approx -0.1976 \). Thus:

\[
r = -\frac{-0.1976}{7} = \frac{0.1976}{7} \approx 0.02823 \, \text{day}^{-1}
\]

Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**F: 0.02828 day\(^{-1}\)**
