Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Mayan king Yax Pahsaj and what his symbolism is. Hmm, I remember that the Mayan kings were known for their incredible craftsmanship and their symbols often reflected their beliefs and roles. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question asks what Yax's stele depicts. The options are A through J. I'll go through each one.

Option A: series of decisive military conquests. I think the Mayan kings were known for their military prowess, but the stele might not necessarily show a series of conquests. Maybe more about his achievements rather than a sequence.

Option B: corn god as a symbol of fertility and prosperity. The corn god is a symbol in Mayan religion representing abundance, so this might fit. But I'm not sure if that's a traditional depiction of a king.

Option C: hunting and defeating a large jaguar. That sounds more like a battle scene. Maybe the stele shows his battles, but I'm not certain if it's the key symbol.

Option D: eagle, serpent, jaguar. I've heard that the Mayans had a lot of symbols involving these animals. Like the eagle representing strength, serpent as a serpent, and jaguar as a predator. So this could be a possible symbol of royalty.

Option E: crown from the Mayan god of death and rebirth. The Mayan god of death is often a tiger, and the crown symbolizes royalty, so this could be another symbolism.

Option F: coronation with all Mayan gods as witnesses. That makes sense because the coronation ceremony often includes multiple gods as testimonies to his victory.

Option G: lightning bolt. I don't think that's a traditional symbol of a king. Lightning is more common in other cultures, maybe like pyramids.

Option H: large sun symbolizing his role as a son of the Sun God. The sun is often associated with the ruler, so this could be a symbolic meaning.

Option I: passing the torch. That's related to the idea of kings passing the torch, like in the Inca tradition. Maybe the Mayans also had a symbolic passing of the throne, though I'm not sure if it's called the torch.

Option J: standing on a mountain. That's more about power and status, perhaps symbolizing a position of authority.

Now, thinking about the stele's symbolism. I recall that the Mayan kings were depicted in various ways. For example, the king maya was often depicted as a warrior, maybe fighting, which would tie into option C. But I'm also trying to remember if they used the bull or other animals for symbols.

Wait, there's another point: the Mayan king might have symbols beyond military. For instance, the Sun God is often depicted prominently, and his sons (like Yax) might have their own symbols. So option H, the sun as his father, could be a key symbol.

Alternatively, the stele might show the king as a symbol of his role, perhaps as a symbol of power, maybe in a battle or as a leader. Or perhaps it's the bull, which is often associated with the king.

Another angle: the Mayan king symbols include a large sun, which is a major symbol. So option H could be correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Mayan kings were depicted as warriors, often depicted in battle scenes. So option C might be a possible choice. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that the Mayan kings often had symbols that included the Sun, representing their divine connection. So option H might be more about their role as sons of the Sun God.

Wait, another thought: the Mayan king is depicted as an eagle, serpent, and jaguar. That's option D. I think the Mayan kings were associated with these animals. For example, the king maya might have the eagle representing strength, the serpent as a serpent, and the jaguar as a predator, symbolizing his might.

So maybe option D is the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall the images more clearly. The Mayan king maya, in particular, the king maya, often depicted as a warrior with a golden head. But it's possible that the stele includes more intricate symbols, like the bull or the Sun.

Wait, another point: the Mayan king maya might be depicted as a battle between the king and a large bull, which could be a depiction of a老虎. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Mayan king maya is depicted as a bull, but that's more of a symbol for strength. So if I have to choose between options, I'm going to have to go with what I remember most accurately.

Wait, I think I've read that the stele of the Mayan king maya depicted him as a bull, which symbolizes his power. So that would point to option G? No, option G is a lightning bolt, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the stele depicts him as a battle between himself and a large bull, which would involve a老虎 or a bull. So that would be option C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider which of these is more of a traditional symbol. The Mayan king maya symbolizes his role as a son of the Sun God, so option H is about the Sun. But in the stele, you might see the Sun as a central symbol. So perhaps the stele shows the Sun as the king's father, and the Sun is depicted as a key element.

Alternatively, the Mayan king maya is depicted as a symbol of strength, maybe as a bull. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible answer. The Mayan king maya, in the stele, is usually depicted as a warrior, perhaps fighting, which would make option C correct. But I also remember that the king maya may have a depiction of the Sun, perhaps as a symbol.

Alternatively, another possible answer is D, because the Mayan kings were often depicted with these three animals. I think the Mayan king maya may have the symbols of the eagle, serpent, and jaguar. So, option D.

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Another approach: think about which of these is a traditional symbol. The Sun is a major symbol, so option H. But the Mayan king as a symbol of his status as a son of the Sun would be option H.

Wait, no, the Sun is the divine father. So perhaps the stele shows him as the bull, which symbolizes the Sun. That would mean option G is the symbol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the bull is a symbol of strength, not necessarily the Sun.

Wait, perhaps the Mayan king maya is depicted as a bull, which represents his father figure. So option G would be the correct symbol.

But I'm getting stuck between options C and D. Another thought: the Mayan kings are often depicted as warriors, hence option C. The battle scene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the Mayan king maya might have the Sun as a symbol. So option H is correct.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Mayan script. The stele is written in the Mesoamerican alphabet, which includes the sun symbol. So perhaps the Mayan king maya is depicted as a symbol of the Sun, which is option H.

But another angle: the Mayan king maya may be depicted as a battle between himself and a large bull, which is a depiction of the Sun, perhaps. So option C would be the battle scene, which is a depiction of his strength.

But I'm getting confused. I think I'll go with the option that I'm more confident about. The Mayan kings were depicted in battle scenes, so option C sounds right. Or perhaps the Mayan king maya is depicted as a symbol of his role as a son of the Sun, which points to option H.

Wait, I think the correct answer is G, the lightning bolt. No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps option D.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should recall that the Mayan king maya is depicted as a symbol of his status as a son of the sun, so option H. That way, the Mayan gods would witness his coronation. Alternatively, the stele might show him as a symbol of his strength, perhaps as a bull, which would be option C.

But I'm not certain which one is more correct. Another approach: think about the Mayan kings being depicted as warriors.

Wait, I think I need to make an educated guess. I'm more confident that the Mayan king maya is depicted as a battle scene, so option C is correct. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the Mayan king maya is depicted as a symbol of his connection to the Sun, which would be option H.

Wait, I think I remember that the Mayan king maya is depicted as a symbol of strength, and perhaps as a battle. So option C is the battle scene. Alternatively, the Mayan king maya may be depicted as a symbol of his divine connection to the Sun, which would be option H.

Wait, another thought: the Sun God is often depicted in the stele. So perhaps the Mayan king maya is depicted as the Sun. So option H would be correct.

Wait, actually, that doesn't make sense because the Sun is a divine being, not a human. So option H is the Sun, and the Mayan king's stele would depict him as the Sun, but that's not how it works. The Sun is part of the Mayan religion but not a human figure.

So perhaps option H is incorrect because it's not a human depiction. So that leaves me between option C and D.

Alternatively, the Mayan king maya is depicted as the bull, which is a symbol of strength. So option C is a battle scene, which is a depiction of his strength.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the Mayan king maya is depicted as a symbol of his divine father, the Sun. So perhaps the Sun is a part of the stele, but it's not represented as a human figure.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about what each option represents.

Option H: the Sun as a symbol. But the stele of a human king would not show a Sun, just the king. So option H's description (receiving a crown from the Mayan god of death) might not be correct.

So, perhaps the stele of the Mayan king maya shows him as a symbol of his role as a ruler and as a symbol of his divine connection, which could be the Sun.

Wait, but the Mayan Sun is a different entity. The Mayan kings were depicted in battle scenes, not as the Sun. So perhaps option C is correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll have to go with option C: a battle scene, depicting his strength and military conquests.

The Mayan king Yax Pahsaj's stele likely depicts a battle scene, showcasing his strength and military prowess. This aligns with the traditional depiction of the Mayan king as a warrior, often depicted in battle scenes, which symbolize his power and role as a ruler. While other options, such as the sun or a symbol of fertility, are considered, the stele is more likely to feature a battle or conflict scene.
