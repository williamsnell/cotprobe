Okay, so I have this equation here: x plus 2.7 equals 8.4. I need to find the value of x from the given options. Let me think about how to approach this.

Hmm, right. To solve for x, I guess I should isolate it on one side of the equation. So, if I subtract 2.7 from both sides, that should do it. Let's see, x plus 2.7 minus 2.7 equals 8.4 minus 2.7. That simplifies to x equals 8.4 minus 2.7.

Now I need to calculate 8.4 minus 2.7. Let me do that. 8.4 minus 2 is 6.4, and then minus another 0.7 is 5.7. So x equals 5.7.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.7. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my math. 5.7 plus 2.7 is 8.4, which matches the equation. Yep, that makes sense.

To solve the equation \( x + 2.7 = 8.4 \), subtract 2.7 from both sides:

\( x = 8.4 - 2.7 \)

\( x = 5.7 \)

The correct option is A.
