Question:

The relationship introduced in Problem $1-48$ has been interpreted to mean that a particle of mass $m\left(E=m c^2\right)$ can materialize from nothing provided that it returns to nothing within a time $\Delta t \leq h / m c^2$. Particles that last for time $\Delta t$ or more are called real particles; particles that last less than time $\Delta t$ are called virtual particles. The mass of the charged pion, a subatomic particle, is $2.5 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~kg}$. What is the minimum lifetime if the pion is to be considered a real particle?

Options:

A: 2.0 x 10^-23 s
B:  2.9$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$ 
C: 3.0 x 10^-22 s
D: 2.5$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$
E: 1.2 x 10^-23 s
F: 3.2$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$
G: 4.1 x 10^-23 s
H: 3.7$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$
I: 5.0 x 10^-23 s
J: 1.5 x 10^-23 s

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about pions and their lifetimes. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a particle's lifetime is real if it's at least Δt or more. And Δt is given by h/(m c²), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, so the pion's mass is given as 2.5e-28 kg. Right. So I need to calculate Δt using the formula Δt = h / (m c²). 

I remember that Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3 x 10^8 m/s. 

Let me plug these numbers in. So m is 2.5e-28 kg. So first, calculate m c².

m c² = 2.5e-28 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2. Let's compute that. (3e8)^2 is 9e16. So 2.5e-28 * 9e16 = 2.5 * 9 = 22.5, and 1e-28 * 1e16 is 1e-12. So 22.5e-12, which is 2.25e-11 J. Wait, but wait, maybe I should double-check that. Let me compute 2.5e-28 * 9e16.

2.5e-28 * 9e16 = (2.5 *9 ) * 10^(-28+16) = 22.5 * 10^-12 = 2.25e-11 J. Yes, that's correct.

Now, Δt = h / (m c²) = 6.626e-34 J·s / 2.25e-11 J.

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 / 2.25e-11. Let me compute 6.626 / 2.25. 2.25 times 2 is 4.5, 2.25 times 2.9 is 6.525. Oh wait, 2.25 * 2.9 is about 6.525. Since 2.25 * 2.9 = 6.525, and our numerator is 6.626, which is about 6.626 - 6.525 = 0.101 more. So that would be 2.9 + (0.101 / 2.25) ≈ 2.9 + 0.0449 ≈ 2.9449. So approximately 2.9449e-23 s.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 2.0e-23 s
B: 2.9e-23 s
C: 3.0e-22 s
D: 2.5e-23 s
E: 1.2e-23 s
F: 3.2e-23 s
G: 4.1e-23 s
H: 3.7e-23 s
I: 5.0e-23 s
J:1.5e-23 s

So option B is 2.9e-23 s, which is very close to my calculation. So the minimum lifetime for the pion to be considered real is approximately 2.9e-23 seconds.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me redo the calculation step.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
m = 2.5e-28 kg
c = 3e8 m/s

m c² = (2.5e-28 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) = (2.5 *9) * 1e-28+16 * kg·m²/s² = 22.5e-12 = 2.25e-11 J.

Δt = 6.626e-34 / 2.25e-11 = (6.626 / 2.25) * 1e-34+11 = (2.944) * 1e-23 = 2.944e-23 s.

So yeah, the minimum time is about 2.9e-23 s. But wait, the options don't have 2.9e-23 exactly. Looking again, option B is 2.9 x 10^-23 s. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the minimum lifetime of the charged pion to be considered a real particle, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{h}{m c^2}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 2.5 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the pion),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light).

First, calculate \( m c^2 \):
\[
m c^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{-28} \times 9 \times 10^{16} = 2.25 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}.
\]

Next, calculate \( \Delta t \):
\[
\Delta t = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2.25 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{6.626}{2.25} \times 10^{-34 + 11} \approx 2.944 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

The calculated minimum lifetime is approximately \( 2.944 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \). Comparing this result with the provided options:
- \( A: 2.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too low),
- \( B: 2.9 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (closest match),
- \( C: 3.0 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{s} \) (too high),
- \( D: 2.5 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too low),
- \( E: 1.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too low),
- \( F: 3.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too high),
- \( G: 4.1 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too high),
- \( H: 3.7 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too high),
- \( I: 5.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too high),
- \( J: 1.5 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \) (too low).

The correct answer is \( B: 2.9 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \).
