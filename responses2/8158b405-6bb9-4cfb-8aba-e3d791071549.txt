Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find which expression is equivalent to 9(9m + 3t). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, I remember from algebra that when you have a number multiplied by a sum inside parentheses, you need to use the distributive property. The distributive property is where you multiply the outside number by each term inside the parentheses. So, in this case, the 9 is outside the parentheses, and inside there are two terms: 9m and 3t.

Let me write that down. So, 9 multiplied by 9m should be the first part. Let me calculate that: 9 times 9m is 81m. That makes sense because 9*9 is 81, and then the m stays as is.

Next, I need to multiply 9 by 3t. Let's see, 9 times 3 is 27, so that part becomes 27t. 

Putting it all together, after distributing the 9, I have 81m + 27t. Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this result.

Let me check the options again. Option A is 18m + 12t, which doesn't look right because I got 81m and 27t. Option B is 81m + 27t, which matches what I calculated. Option C is 27m +81t, which would be if I multiplied each term by 3, but that's not the case here. Option D is 9m +81t, which doesn't fit. Option E is 81m +3t, which has the 3t but the m term is correct, but the t term is wrong. Option F is 81m +9t, which doesn't make sense. Option G is 9m +27t, which is close but the coefficient of m is wrong. Option H is 72m +27t, which doesn't match either. Option I is 18m +3t, which is way off.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. 9 times 9m is indeed 81m, and 9 times 3t is 27t. So yes, 81m +27t is correct. So the correct answer should be option B.

I think that's it. Let me make sure none of the other options are correct. Option D is 9m +81t. That would be if I had (9m +9t) but then multiplied by 9, but no, that's not the case here. The original expression is (9m +3t) multiplied by 9, so each term is multiplied by 9. So 9m becomes 81m and 3t becomes 27t. So option B is correct.

The correct answer is option B, which is 81m +27t.

Answer: B
