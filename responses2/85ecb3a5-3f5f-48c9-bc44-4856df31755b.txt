Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this Whorfian hypothesis question. The options are A to H. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Whorfian hypothesis.

The Whorfian hypothesis, or linguistic relativity, suggests that language evolves in a way that its meanings are closely tied to the physical structures of the environment. So, for example, words for animals (like "elephant") might be formed to reflect how elephants move or their habitat.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one.

Option A: Some languages are tonal while others are not. I remember that tonal languages have distinct sounds for certain tones, like in English and many African languages. But I'm not sure if the Whorfian hypothesis directly explains tonality. The hypothesis is more about how language uses the environment, not tonal systems. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: Humans have the ability to create new words. That doesn't seem right. The Whorfian hypothesis is about how existing words are used in the environment, not about the ability to create new ones. So B can't be the answer.

Option C: Phonemes are not interchangeable with morphemes. Wait, phonemes and morphemes are different parts of language. Phonemes are about sounds, while morphemes are about grammatical roles. I think the Whorfian theory would say that the meaning of words (like phonemes) is connected to the environment, which doesn't directly relate to whether phonemes can replace morphemes. Hmm, maybe this is about how phonemes are used in the environment, not their interchangeability. So I'm not sure if C is correct.

Option D: People can understand multiple languages. I'm not sure. The Whorfian hypothesis isn't about understanding multiple languages but about how language uses the environment. So D might not be the correct answer.

Option E: Cultures have developed different languages. That rings a bell. The Whorfian theory suggests that the evolution of language is tied to the environment, so different cultures develop their own languages. So E could be the answer.

Option F: Eskimos have many words relating to snow. That's a classic example. The Whorfian hypothesis would say that the naming of snow-related items (like "alder" for snow) evolved because they were part of their environment. So this supports the Whorfian idea. So F might be correct.

Option G: Parents use a high-pitched voice. That's more about speech production. The Whorfian hypothesis isn't about why parents produce that sound; it's about the relationship between language and the environment. So not G.

Option H: English became a universal language. That's a different thing. The Whorfian hypothesis isn't about English becoming universal; it's about how English's phonology is shaped by the environment. So H isn't the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The Whorfian hypothesis says that language is shaped by the environment. So for example, language reflects the environment. So which options relate to that?

Option E says cultures have different languages. The Whorfian hypothesis suggests that language evolves to fit the environment, so different cultures might have different languages. That makes sense. So E is likely correct.

Option F is about the origin of words for snow. The Whorfian hypothesis explains that the words were created for the needs of living in the environment. So that's a supporting point, but the question is about what the hypothesis helps explain. So perhaps the question is about the broader phenomenon supported by the hypothesis.

Wait, the question is asking what the Whorfian hypothesis helps explain. The options are about various linguistic phenomena.

The Whorfian hypothesis has implications for how language uses the environment. So, for example, it can explain why certain words are used in certain contexts. 

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Phonemes not interchangeable with morphemes. Phonemes are sounds, morphemes are grammatical structures. So the Whorfian hypothesis would say that phonemes are tied to the environment. So perhaps this doesn't directly apply, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is about how the hypothesis explains the use of language in the environment.

Wait, the question is about what the hypothesis explains. The hypothesis itself suggests that language is shaped by the environment. So which option is that?

Looking at the options, option E says cultures have developed different languages. That's what the hypothesis is about. So option E is correct.

Option F is about the origin of words for snow, but the hypothesis is more about how language is used in the environment, not the origin of words.

So I think the correct answer is E.

The Whorfian hypothesis explains that language evolves to fit the environment, meaning that language usage is shaped by the physical structures of the environment. This involves how words are created and used based on the needs and behaviors of the environment.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: The Whorfian hypothesis does not directly explain tonal systems (A is incorrect).
- **B**: The hypothesis does not address the ability to create new words (B is incorrect).
- **C**: This relates to the interchangeability of phonemes and morphemes, which is not the focus of the Whorfian hypothesis (C is incorrect).
- **D**: The hypothesis concerns language evolution, not the ability to understand multiple languages (D is incorrect).
- **E**: This directly aligns with the Whorfian hypothesis, explaining that cultures develop different languages based on their environments (E is correct).
- **F**: While related to the origin of words, this is not the primary explanation of the Whorfian hypothesis (F is incorrect).
- **G**: Speech production is unrelated to the Whorfian hypothesis (G is incorrect).
- **H**: The hypothesis does not explain the becoming of English as a universal language (H is incorrect).
- **E**: Correctly identifies the primary implication of the Whorfian hypothesis.

The correct answer is **E**, as it directly reflects the hypothesis's focus on how language is shaped by the environment.

**Answer: E**
