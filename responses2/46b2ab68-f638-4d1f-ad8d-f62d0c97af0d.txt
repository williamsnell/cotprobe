The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
~G ⊃ H
~H / G

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when G is false and H is true
B: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is true
C: Valid, with G and H both being variable
D: Invalid. Counterexample when G and H are true
E: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is false
F: Invalid. Counterexample when both G and H are false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when G is false and H is false
H: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and G is false
I: Valid

Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to construct a truth table for an argument and determine its validity. The argument is:

~G → H

~H

G 

Hmm, wait, let's make sure I parse this correctly. The first premise is "not G implies H", the second premise is "not H", and the conclusion is G. So the argument is like:

1. ~G → H
2. ~H
3. Therefore, G

I need to see if this argument is valid. If it's invalid, I have to find a counterexample. 

Alright, to construct a truth table, I need to list all possible truth values for G and H. Since there are two variables here, each can be either true or false. So there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations.

Let me list them:

1. G = true, H = true
2. G = true, H = false
3. G = false, H = true
4. G = false, H = false

For each of these, I'll evaluate the premises and see if the conclusion holds.

Starting with the first row: G=T, H=T.

1. ~G → H: ~G is F, so F→T is T.
2. ~H: H=T, so ~H is F.
3. So the premises are T and F. Do they lead to G being T? Well, the premises are both true, and the conclusion is G=T. So the argument holds here.

Second row: G=T, H=F.

1. ~G → H: ~G = F, so F→H (where H is F) becomes F→F, which is T.
2. ~H: H=F, so ~H is T.
3. So premises are T and T. The conclusion is G=T. So argument holds.

Third row: G=F, H=T.

1. ~G → H: ~G=T, so T→H (H=T) is T.
2. ~H: H=T, so ~H=F.
3. So the premises are T and F. The conclusion is G=F. Argument holds.

Fourth row: G=F, H=F.

1. ~G → H: ~G=T, so T→F is F.
2. ~H: H=F, so ~H=T.
3. So premises are F and T. Since both are true, does this mean the conclusion G=F follows? Wait, the premises are true, but the conclusion is also G=F. So the argument holds here as well.

Wait a minute, in all four cases, the premises are true and the conclusion is G. So the argument is valid because whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

But wait, I might be making a mistake here. Let me double-check each step.

Looking back, the first premise is ~G → H. Let's see:

In the fourth row, G=F, so ~G=T. So ~G→H becomes T→F (since H=F). So this premise is false in this case. But the second premise is ~H=T, so both premises would be (F and T), which makes the entire argument (premises) false. But the conclusion G=F is also false. So in this case, both premises are false, but the conclusion is also false. So the argument holds.

Wait, but the argument is an implication. The argument is of the form: If premise1 and premise2, then conclusion. So in the fourth row, premise1 is false (because ~G=T, and H=F → F), premise2 is true (because ~H=T). So the argument would have premise1 as false (so the whole argument is false regardless of premise2 and conclusion), but in reality, the conclusion is G=F, which is also false. So the argument holds in this case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me make a table:

So the argument is:

1. ~G → H
2. ~H
3. Therefore, G

I need to see if whenever both 1 and 2 are true, does 3 necessarily follow?

Let me consider all possible cases:

1. G=T, H=T:

   1. F→T → T
   2. F
   So premises are T and F → premises are true, but the conclusion is T. So argument holds.

2. G=T, H=F:

   1. F→F → T
   2. T
   So premises are T and T → argument holds (conclusion T).

3. G=F, H=T:

   1. T→T → T
   2. F
   So premises T and F → argument holds (conclusion F).

4. G=F, H=F:

   1. T→F → F
   2. T
   So premises are F and T → argument holds (conclusion F).

In all four cases, when the premises are true, the conclusion is true. So the argument is valid.

So looking back at the options, the argument is valid, so the answer should be I: Valid.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to J. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Valid. Counterexample when G is false and H is true

B: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is true

C: Valid, with G and H both variable

D: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is true

E: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is false

F: Invalid. Counterexample when both G and H are false

G: Invalid. Counterexample when G is false and H is false

H: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and G is false

I: Valid

So the conclusion is that the argument is valid, so option I is correct.
</think>

The argument is valid because in all possible truth values, whenever the premises (~G → H and ~H) are true, the conclusion G is also true. 

Answer: I: Valid
