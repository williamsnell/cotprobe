Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on checking these reconciled bank statements. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the question says that Mr. Blake received a statement for his checking account. The closing balance was $1,810.50. But then his checkbook shows a balance of $1,685.75. Hmm, so there's a difference here. I need to reconcile this.

He noticed that three checks didn't appear on the statement: $60.80, $40.30, and $25.00. Also, the statement has a service charge of $1.35 that's not on his checkbook. So I think I need to adjust the balances to make them match.

Wait, let me think. When reconciling, the bank statement starts with the balance. Then, we add any deposits and subtract any outstanding checks and fees. Alternatively, the checkbook starts with the balance and adds checks and subtracts fees. So the two should reconcile.

So the checkbook balance is $1,685.75. Let's add the outstanding checks. The checks not listed are $60.80, $40.30, and $25.00. Adding those: 60.80 +40.30 is 101.10, plus 25 is 126.10. So subtracting these from the checkbook balance: 1,685.75 - 126.10 = 1,559.65.

But wait, the bank statement starts at 1,810.50. So after adding the outstanding checks, it becomes 1,810.50 - 126.10 = 1,684.40. Wait, no, maybe I should think about the other side.

Alternatively, the bank statement's balance is 1,810.50. He has these three outstanding checks not listed. So in the bank's books, those checks haven't been processed yet. So the bank's balance should be higher. 

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to adjust the bank balance to match the checkbook.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Start with the bank statement balance: $1,810.50.

2. Subtract the checks that are not listed on the statement. So subtract $60.80, $40.30, and $25.00. So total is 126.10. So 1,810.50 - 126.10 = 1,684.40.

3. Add any fees or charges that the bank statement doesn't account for. The statement has a service charge of $1.35. So that's a fee. Since the bank is charging, the fee is an expense, but in the checkbook, it's a expense as well. Wait, but in the checkbook, it's more likely that the checkbook has a balance that includes all transactions, so the bank's statement balance is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the steps as:

The bank statement balance is higher because the three checks are outstanding. So, in the checkbook, the balance is lower because the checks haven't been paid yet. Therefore, to reconcile:

We need to adjust the checkbook balance to match the bank statement balance.

So:

Checkbook balance is $1,685.75.

Bank statement balance is $1,810.50.

The difference is 1,810.50 - 1,685.75 = $124.75.

Wait, but that doesn't account for the missing checks and the service charge.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the bank statement is higher, so to get to the checkbook balance, we need to add the missing checks and subtract the service charge.

Wait, maybe it's better to outline the two sides of the reconciliation.

Bank Statement Balance: $1,810.50

Checkbook Balance: $1,685.75

We need to reconcile these. The difference is $124.75.

But how to reach this.

Wait, perhaps adding back the checks not on the statement and subtracting the service charge.

So, the checkbook is $124.75 less than the bank statement. So to reconcile, we need to add those $124.75.

Which would mean starting from the checkbook balance, add the missing checks and subtract the service charge.

Wait, let me think again.

The checkbook shows $1,685.75. The bank statement says he has $1,810.50, which includes the three checks and the service charge. So the bank has these three checks as outstanding, and the service charge as a charge.

So, in the bank's books, the balance should be the checkbook balance plus the outstanding checks and minus the service charge.

Alternatively, the checkbook is lower than the bank's balance, so to reconcile, we need to add the missing checks and subtract the service charge.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

Starting with the bank's balance: $1,810.50.

Add the three missing checks: 60.80 +40.30 +25.00 = 126.10.

So 1,810.50 + 126.10 = 1,936.60.

But the checkbook shows $1,685.75, which is lower. So the difference between 1,936.60 and 1,685.75 is 250.85. Hmm, not sure if that's right.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the correct approach.

The correct steps are:

1. Start with the bank statement balance.

2. Add any deposits, but in this case, there's no mention of deposits, so perhaps not.

3. Subtract the outstanding checks.

Then, the checkbook balance plus any fees or charges would need to be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps the checkbook balance is too low because it's not including the three checks, so to reconcile, we need to add the three checks to the checkbook balance.

Wait, but also, the bank statement includes the service charge, which is a fee, so it's an expense. So in the checkbook, it's already subtracted.

So perhaps the correct way is:

Bank balance: $1,810.50.

Add the three missing checks: $60.80 + $40.30 + $25.00 = $126.10. So 1,810.50 + 126.10 = 1,936.60.

Then, the checkbook balance is $1,685.75. So the difference is 1,936.60 - 1,685.75 = $250.85. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

The steps to reconcile are:

1. Start with the bank statement balance.

2. Subtract the outstanding checks (which are not listed on the statement) and any fees.

So,

1,810.50 (bank) - 126.10 (outstanding) = 1,684.40.

But the checkbook balance is $1,685.75, which is $1.35 higher.

Wait, but the bank statement includes a service charge of $1.35. So the bank's balance is 1,810.50 minus 1.35 = 1,809.15.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the bank statement includes the service charge as a deduction. So the actual balance is 1,810.50 minus 1.35 = 1,809.15.

But that's not matching with the checkbook balance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to add the service charge to the checkbook balance and subtract the missing checks.

Wait, let me think. The bank balance is 1,810.50. The three checks are not on the statement, so they should be added to the checkbook. 

Also, the bank statement includes a service charge, which is a fee that the bank is charging, so it's an expense. So that should be subtracted from the checkbook balance.

So, the steps would be:

Checkbook balance: 1,685.75.

Add the three checks: 126.10 → 1,685.75 + 126.10 = 1,811.85.

Subtract the bank's service charge (since it's an expense for the bank) → 1,811.85 - 1.35 = 1,809.50.

Wait, but then the bank statement balance is 1,810.50, so the difference is 1,809.50 vs 1,810.50.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The correct reconciliation should bring the two balances to the same number.

Bank statement balance is 1,810.50.

We need to adjust this to match the checkbook, which is 1,685.75.

So, the difference is 1,810.50 - 1,685.75 = 124.75.

But where does this 124.75 come from? It must be the sum of the three checks and the service charge.

Wait, 60.80 +40.30 +25 = 126.10, plus the service charge of 1.35 → 127.45. But the difference is 124.75, which is less than 127.45.

Wait, perhaps I'm not adding correctly.

Wait, maybe the correct adjustment is to add the missing checks and subtract the service charge from the bank balance.

So,

1,810.50 (bank) + 126.10 (missing checks) = 1,936.60.

Then subtract the service charge of 1.35 → 1,935.25.

But the checkbook balance is 1,685.75. Hmm, 1,935.25 minus 1,685.75 = 249.50. 

Not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to start with the checkbook balance and adjust it to match the bank's balance.

Checkbook balance: 1,685.75.

We need to add the three checks and subtract the service charge.

So,

1,685.75 + 126.10 = 1,811.85.

Then subtract 1.35 → 1,810.50. 

Ah! That brings the checkbook balance up to 1,810.50, which matches the bank statement balance.

So the adjusted checkbook balance is 1,810.50, which is equal to the bank statement balance. So the reconciliation shows that.

So the reconciled checkbook balance would be 1,810.50, which matches the bank statement. So the correct balance is 1,810.50, which is option F: $1,823.85? Wait, no. Wait, let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are A to J, and the amounts are:

A: $1,748.60

B: $1,810.50

C: $1,773.00

D: $126.10

E: $1,729.55

F: $1,823.85

G: $1,684.40

H: $1,710.05

I: $1685.75

J: $1,654.40

So option B is $1,810.50, which is the adjusted balance. So the correct answer is B.

So the correct reconciled balance is $1,810.50, which is option B.

To reconcile Mr. Blake's bank statement and checkbook, we need to adjust both balances to match each other. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Start with the bank statement balance**: $1,810.50. This is the balance as recorded by the bank.

2. **Add the missing checks**: The bank statement does not include three checks ($60.80, $40.30, and $25.00) that have not been recorded. Adding these:
   \[
   1,810.50 + 60.80 + 40.30 + 25.00 = 1,936.60
   \]

3. **Subtract the service charge**: The bank charges a service fee of $1.35, which should be deducted from the bank balance:
   \[
   1,936.60 - 1.35 = 1,935.25
   \]

4. **Adjust the checkbook balance**: The checkbook balance is $1,685.75. To reconcile, we need to add the missing checks and subtract the service charge from the checkbook balance:
   \[
   1,685.75 + 60.80 + 40.30 + 25.00 - 1.35 = 1,810.50
   \]

5. **Final reconciled balance**: After adjustments, both the bank statement and the checkbook balance match at $1,810.50.

Thus, the reconciled balance is **$1,810.50**, which corresponds to option **B**.
