Question:

A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

Options:

A: Bronchoscopy
B: Examination of sputum for eosinophils
C: Sputum cytology
D: Sweat chloride test
E: Chest CT scan
F: Echocardiogram
G: Spirometry repeat test
H: Tuberculin skin test
I: Complete blood count
J: Arterial blood gas analysis

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm trying to help someone with a medical question. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is a 20-year-old man who has had upper respiratory infections for 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and his exercise tolerance has decreased. He and his wife can't conceive because of his low sperm count. Also, there's scattered expiratory wheezing and rhinchi in both lung fields. The x-ray shows hyperinflation, and the spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio.

The question is asking which test confirms the diagnosis. The options are A to J.

Hmm, so let's break down what's going on. He has frequent infections, low sperm count, can't exercise well, wheezing, and maybe some lung issues. The x-ray shows hyperinflation, which I think is a sign of lung inflammation, maybe an infection. Spirometry measures gas exhalation efficiency, so a lower ratio suggests more chronic coughing or more air being expelled, which could indicate something like asthma or something else that affects breathing.

Sputum cytology is used to look for types of cells in the sputum, like eosinophils which are a type of white blood cell. If they find those, it suggests a more severe infection, maybe chronic bronchitis or something with inflammation. That would support the idea of an infection, which would explain the wheezing and rhinchi.

But wait, what's the primary cause here? Let's think about the symptoms. Low sperm count is often linked to fertility issues, but it's not the typical cause of respiratory infections. Maybe it's related to another condition like prostate cancer, but that's not the main issue here. His chest x-ray shows hyperinflation, which points to lung inflammation and infection.

So, options: the tests. Bronchoscopy is for smaller abscesses or infections, but if there's no clear infection, maybe it's not the right choice. Sputum cytology would look for things like macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. If the sputum has those, that's a sign of inflammation affecting the respiratory system.

Option C is sputum cytology. Option A is a bronchoscopy, which is more for when you suspect an infection that's more localized, like an abscess or a small infection. If the infection is more widespread, a sputum cytology might be more appropriate.

So, considering all the symptoms—low sperm, wheezing, rhinchi, hyperinflation, and a decreased FEV1/FVC—these are all pointing to chronic, possibly inflammatory, respiratory conditions. Sputum cytology would help identify any signs of inflammation like those.

Another thing is the x-ray showing hyperinflation. That's a histological sign of inflammation in the lungs. So, the primary diagnosis here is likely an infection or inflammation of the lung. If you check the sputum for these cells, you can confirm that.

So, the test that would confirm the diagnosis is likely sputum cytology (option C). Alternatively, maybe the other options aren't the best fit. For example, a bronchoscopy (option A) might be used if there's a small infection or abscess, but if the sputum has these cells, that's more indicative of a chronic condition.

Wait, but since the man has a low sperm count, which is linked to possibly prostate cancer, but that's a separate issue. His chest infection is the main point. So, the primary test needed is to check the sputum for any inflammation or infection. So, the correct answer would be C: examination of sputum for eosinophils.

The patient's condition is best confirmed by an examination of the sputum for eosinophils, as this suggests the presence of an inflammatory lung condition. 

ANSWER: C
