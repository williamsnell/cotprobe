Okay, so I've got this problem here about Maddie riding her bike. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says she will ride a total of 56 miles over 7 days, and she rides the same number each day. I need to find out how many miles she rides each day.

Hmm, right, so this is a division problem. If she's riding the same distance each day, I just need to divide the total miles by the number of days. So, 56 miles divided by 7 days. Let me do that calculation. 56 divided by 7 equals 8. So, each day she rides 8 miles.

Wait, let me double-check that. 7 times 8 is 56, right? Yeah, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 8 miles per day. Looking at the options, option D is 8. So I think the correct answer is D.

The total miles Maddie rides each day is calculated by dividing the total miles by the number of days.

**Answer: D: 8**
