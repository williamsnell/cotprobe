Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about how the members of an Arbitral Tribunal (Arbitration tribunal) are appointed. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Arbitration tribunals are involved in labor and civil disputes. The question is about the process of appointing their members. I think the main thing to consider is the rules governing the appointment process. 

I recall that in many international tribunals, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the process has some specific rules. I think the members of the tribunal are not appointed by the parties directly. It's more about the tribunal itself deciding who gets to sit. That makes sense because if the parties were directly appointing members, that could be seen as favoring one party over the other, which might not be fair or legal.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says all members are appointed by the parties. That doesn't seem right because if the tribunal itself is making the appointments, then the parties aren't directly involved. I think the tribunals are typically formed by the ICJ and other countries, so the members aren't chosen by the parties. 

Option B claims that the members are appointed by an impartial third party, like the president of the ICJ. But I don't think the tribunals are appointed by an external third party. Instead, they are formed through voluntary applications from the countries, and the members are selected by the tribune or the court itself. So this option doesn't fit.

Option C states that all members are appointed by the parties from a restricted list. Again, this sounds incorrect because the tribunals are formed by the ICJ and other countries, not the parties. So this is probably not the right answer either.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option B. The members are appointed by the tribune or the court, not by the parties directly. The tribunals are formed through their own process, and the members are selected by the tribune's decision. This ensures fairness and impartiality, as the tribune is the one making the selection, which is a key aspect of international tribunals.
