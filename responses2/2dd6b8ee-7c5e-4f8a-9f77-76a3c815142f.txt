Question:

Two objects, a sphere and a block of the same mass, are released from rest at the top of an inclined plane. The sphere rolls down the inclined plane without slipping. The block slides down the plane without friction. Which object reaches the bottom of the ramp first?

Options:

A: The block, because it slides down faster due to its shape
B: The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does
C: The sphere, because it has less surface area in contact with the ramp
D: Both reach at the same time, as gravity acts equally on both objects
E: The block, because it has more surface area in contact with the ramp
F: The sphere, because its shape allows it to roll faster
G: The sphere, because it gains mechanical energy due to the torque exerted on it, but the block does not
H: The sphere, because it gains rotational kinetic energy, but the block does not
I: Both reach at the same time, as they both have the same mass
J: The block, because it does not lose mechanical energy due to friction, but the sphere does

Okay, let me think through this physics problem. So, there are two objects: a sphere and a block. They're both released from rest at the top of an inclined plane. The sphere rolls down without slipping, and the block slides without friction. I need to figure out which one reaches the bottom first.

Hmm, I remember that when objects move down an incline, their acceleration depends on their moment of inertia. Oh wait, the moment of inertia affects how they rotate. The moment of inertia is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation. For a sphere, the moment of inertia is lower than for a block, I think.

Wait, the formula for moment of inertia is I = (2/5)mr² for a solid sphere and I = (1/3)mr² for a solid cylinder or something. So, a sphere has a lower moment of inertia than a block. That means when it rolls down, it's going to have less energy to spin than it would if it just slides, right?

Because when an object rolls without slipping, both translational and rotational kinetic energy are involved. The total kinetic energy for the sphere would be the sum of translational and rotational parts. The translational part is (1/2)mv², and the rotational part is (1/2)Iω². But since ω = v/r for rolling without slipping, the rotational part becomes (1/2)(I)(v²/r²). Substituting I for the sphere, that's (1/2)(2/5 mr²)(v²/r²) = (1/5 mv²). So, the total KE for the sphere is (1/2 mv²) + (1/5 mv²) = (7/10 mv²). 

On the other hand, the block is just sliding, so all its energy is translational, (1/2 mv²). So the block has less rotational KE than the sphere. Since total energy is conserved, the block has less potential energy converted into kinetic energy. Wait, no—wait, the potential energy is mgh, right. So both will convert that into KE. 

Wait, another way: the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For the block, all the KE is translational. For the sphere, it's a combination. So, which one is faster? Because the sphere has some rotational KE as well.

Wait, so for a given height, the potential energy is the same for both. Let me think about energy. 

Let’s model this. Let’s say the height is h. The potential energy is mgh. For the block, all of this goes into translational KE: (1/2 mv²) = mgh → v = sqrt(2gh). 

For the sphere, the energy is split between translational and rotational. So, (1/2 mv_total²) = mgh. But the total KE is (7/10 mv_total²) for the sphere. So, (7/10 mv_total²) = mgh → v_total² = (10/7)gh → v_total = sqrt(10gh/7) ≈ sqrt(1.428gh) → v ≈ 1.195 * sqrt(gh). 

Wait, but the block's speed is sqrt(2gh) ≈ 1.414 * sqrt(gh). So the block's speed is higher. So the block reaches the bottom faster. 

Wait, but I thought the sphere would have a lower speed because it's rolling, but in reality, since it's transferring some energy into rotation, it ends up moving slower than the block. Because the block is only translating, while the sphere is both translating and spinning. 

So, the sphere's speed is lower than the block's. So the block would reach the bottom first. So the correct answer is option B or F? Let me check the options. 

Looking at the options: 

Option B says the block because it doesn't gain rotational KE. Option F says the sphere because it gains rotational KE but the block doesn't. Wait, but the block's KE is all translational, and the sphere has rotational as well. So the block is faster because it doesn't have any rotational KE.

Wait, but the block is sliding without friction. So, no friction, so all potential energy is converted into translational KE. The sphere, on the other hand, has some rotational KE. So the sphere's velocity is lower than the block's. 

So the block is faster. So the correct answer is option B? Or no, wait option F says the sphere because it gains rotational KE but the block does not. No, that's not right. Because the block doesn't gain any rotation, so its speed is higher. So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves two objects, a sphere and a block, released from rest at the top of an inclined plane. The sphere rolls without slipping, while the block slides without friction. The goal is to determine which object reaches the bottom of the ramp first.

When an object rolls without slipping, both translational and rotational kinetic energy are involved. For the sphere, the moment of inertia is lower than that of a block, which means the sphere has less rotational kinetic energy compared to the block. The total kinetic energy for the sphere is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energy, while for the block, all the kinetic energy is translational. 

Using conservation of energy, the potential energy at the top is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom. For the block, all the potential energy becomes translational kinetic energy, resulting in a speed of \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \). For the sphere, the total kinetic energy is shared between translational and rotational parts. The sphere's speed is slower than the block's because it has rotational kinetic energy involved, which reduces its translational speed.

Thus, the block, sliding without friction, reaches the bottom of the ramp faster than the sphere, which rolls without slipping due to the additional rotational kinetic energy.

**Correct answer:** **B: The block, because it slides down faster due to its shape.**
