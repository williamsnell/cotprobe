Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The reaction is 2KClO3(s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O2(g). He's collecting O2 gas by water displacement, and he observed a pressure of 753 mm Hg. Wait, the question asks for the volume of gas produced, given some conditions. The answer choices are in milliliters, so I guess I'll need to calculate the volume in liters and then convert to milliliters.

The data given includes the mass of KClO3 used, which is 1.28 grams. The temperature is 20°C, and the pressure of water vapor is 17.5 mmHg at that temperature. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, right? So I think I'll need to find the number of moles of O2 produced, then use that in the ideal gas equation to find the volume.

First, let's write down the balanced equation again: 2 moles KClO3 produce 3 moles O2. So the mole ratio is 2:3 for KClO3 to O2. That's important to find out how much O2 is produced from 1.28 grams of KClO3.

Next, I need to calculate the moles of KClO3. The molar mass of KClO3 would be the sum of the atomic masses of K, Cl, and O. K is about 39.1 g/mol, Cl is about 35.5, and O is 16. So KClO3 is 39.1 + 35.5 + (3×16) = 39.1 +35.5=74.6 +48=122.6 g/mol.

So moles of KClO3 = mass / molar mass = 1.28 g / 122.6 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1.28 ÷ 122.6 is about 0.01049 moles. So around 0.01049 mol KClO3.

Since the mole ratio is 2 moles KClO3 : 3 moles O2, the moles of O2 produced would be (3/2) * 0.01049. Let me calculate that: 0.01049 * 1.5 = 0.015735 moles of O2.

Wait, but wait a second. The pressure he observed is 753 mm Hg, but the water vapor pressure is 17.5 mm Hg. Oh right, because when you collect gas over water, the total pressure includes the gas plus the water vapor pressure. So the actual pressure of the O2 is the total pressure minus the vapor pressure.

So the partial pressure of O2 is 753 mm Hg - 17.5 mm Hg = 735.5 mm Hg.

But wait. The units for R are in liters and atm. Oh right, since the ideal gas law uses P in atm, volume in liters, and T in Kelvin.

So, I need to convert 735.5 mm Hg to atm. Since 1 atm is 760 mmHg, 735.5 / 760 = approx 0.968 atm. Let me compute that more accurately. 735.5 ÷ 760 = 0.96821 atm.

Wait, but wait, I should be precise with the division. Let me compute 735.5 divided by 760.

760 goes into 735.5 about 0.968 times. So, 0.968 atm.

Temperature is 20°C, which is 293.15 K.

Now, the ideal gas law PV = nRT. We're solving for V.

V = (nRT)/P.

n is 0.015735 mol.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

P is 0.968 atm.

Plugging in:

V = (0.015735 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 293.15 K) / 0.968 atm.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute nRT:

0.015735 * 0.0821 = let's see. 0.015735 * 0.0821. Let me approximate. 0.015735 * 0.08 is about 0.0012588. 0.015735 * 0.0021 is about 0.00003298. So total is approximately 0.0012918.

Wait, maybe better to compute more accurately:

0.015735 * 0.0821 = ?

0.015735 * 0.08 = 0.0012588.

0.015735 * 0.0021 = 0.0000329935.

Adding together: 0.0012588 + 0.0000329935 ≈ 0.0012918.

Then multiply by 293.15 K.

0.0012918 * 293.15 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.0012918 * 293 = approximately 0.379 (since 0.0012918 * 300 is 0.38754, but subtract 0.0012918 *7 = 0.0090426, so 0.38754-0.0090426= 0.3784974 ≈ 0.3785).

But let me compute more accurately.

0.0012918 *293.15 = ?

Let me compute 0.0012918 * 293 = 0.3783 (since 293 * 0.001 is 0.293, 0.0002918 is 0.08515, so 0.293 +0.08515 = 0.37815). Then, 0.0012918 *0.15 = 0.00019377. So total is 0.37815 + 0.00019377 ≈ 0.37834377 L·atm.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator step. Let me compute 0.015735 * 0.0821 = 0.00129188 mol·L·atm/(mol·K)? No, wait, wait. Wait, no, n is 0.015735 mol. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So nRT is 0.015735 * 0.0821 = let me compute that.

0.015735 * 0.0821.

Let me multiply 0.015735 * 82.1 * 1e-3.

Wait, 0.015735 * 82.1 = ?

Let me compute 0.015735 * 80 = 1.2588, and 0.015735 * 2.1 ≈ 0.0330435. So total is 1.2588 + 0.0330435 = 1.2918435. Multiply by 1e-3 gives 0.0012918435 L·atm/K.

Then we multiply by 293.15 K: 0.0012918435 * 293.15 ≈ ?

Calculating that: 0.0012918435 * 293.15.

Well, 0.0012918435 * 200 = 0.2583687.

0.0012918435 * 93.15 = ?

Wait, 293.15 = 200 + 93.15.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.0012918435 * 293.15.

Compute 0.0012918435 * 293.15.

Let me break it down:

0.0012918435 * 200 = 0.2583687.

0.0012918435 * 90 = 0.1162659.

0.0012918435 * 3.15 ≈ 0.004055 (because 0.00129 *3=0.00387, 0.00129 *0.15=0.0001935, total 0.0040635).

So adding those: 0.2583687 + 0.1162659 = 0.3746346 + 0.0040635 = 0.3787 L·atm.

Now, that's the numerator for V = nRT.

Now, the denominator is P, which is 0.968 atm.

So V = 0.3787 L·atm / 0.968 atm = approx 0.3916 liters.

Wait, because 0.3787 ÷ 0.968. Let me compute that: 0.3787 ÷0.968.

Hmm, 0.968 is about 1. So 0.3787 / 0.968 ≈ 0.3916 liters.

Wait, 0.968 * 0.3916 = approx 0.378 liters. So yes, that's correct.

Now, I need to convert liters to milliliters. Since 1 liter is 1000 mL, 0.3916 L = 391.6 mL.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is D) 300 ml, C) 390 ml, G) 450 ml.

Hmm, 391.6 is very close to 390, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, did I make a miscalculation earlier?

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

First, moles of KClO3: 1.28 g / 122.6 g/mol = 0.01049 mol. Correct.

Mole ratio is 2:3, so moles of O2 produced is 0.01049 * (3/2) = 0.015735 mol. Correct.

Partial pressure of O2 is 753 mmHg - 17.5 mmHg = 735.5 mmHg. Correct.

Convert to atm: 735.5 /760 = 0.96821 atm. Rounded to about 0.968 atm.

nRT: 0.015735 * 0.0821 * 293.15.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Compute 0.015735 × 0.0821 = ?

0.015735 * 0.0821.

Let me compute 15735 * 821 = ?

Well, 15735 * 800 = 1,258,800.

15735 * 21 = 329,835.

Wait, 15735 * 20 = 314,700; 15735 * 1 = 15,735. So 314,700 +15,735= 330,435.

So total 1,258,800 + 330,435 = 1,589,235.

Wait, but 0.015735 is 15735e-6, 0.0821 is 821e-3.

So 15735e-6 *821e-3 = (15735 *821) * 1e-9. Wait, 15735 *821 is 13,000,000 approximately. Wait, earlier I found 1,589,235. So 1589235 *1e-9 = 0.001589235.

So 0.015735 *0.0821 ≈ 0.0012918.

Then multiply by 293.15 K: 0.0012918 *293.15 = 0.3787 L·atm.

Divide by P (0.968 atm): 0.3787 /0.968 ≈ 0.3916 L = 391.6 mL.

But wait the options don't have 391.6. The closest is 390 mL (option C), but wait, wait let me check what the initial calculation of moles of O2 was. Oh wait, wait, Did I make a mistake in the mole ratio?

Wait, the reaction is 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. So for each 2 moles KClO3, you get 3 moles O2. So the moles of O2 are (3/2) * moles of KClO3. So I did that correctly.

Wait, but what about the initial mass of KClO3? Let me double-check that.

Mass of KClO3 is 1.28 grams. Molar mass is 39.1 (K) + 35.5 (Cl) + 3*16 (O each) = 39.1 +35.5=74.6; 74.6 +48=122.6 g/mol.

So 1.28 / 122.6 = 0.01049 mol. Correct.

Hmm. So I think the calculation is correct. So the volume is approximately 391.6 mL, which is around 390 mL, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 390 mL, and option G is 450. But why is the correct answer not 390?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial pressure. Let me recheck that.

The total pressure is 753 mm Hg. The water vapor pressure is 17.5 mm Hg. So the partial pressure of O2 is 753 -17.5 = 735.5 mm Hg. Correct.

But wait, wait a second. I think I might have mixed up the units somewhere.

Wait, another approach: use the ideal gas law with the given pressure in mm Hg and convert to atm.

Wait, the ideal gas law is V = nRT/P. But when P is in mm Hg, you can convert it to atm by dividing by 760.

So, n=0.015735 mol.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

P =735.5 mmHg /760 mmHg/atm = 0.968 atm.

Compute V = (0.015735 * 0.0821 *293.15)/0.968.

Wait, let me compute 0.015735 * 0.0821 = 0.0012918.

Multiply by 293.15: 0.0012918 *293.15.

Wait, 0.0012918 * 293 = 0.378.

But more accurately, 0.0012918 *293.15 = ?

Let me compute 0.0012918 *293.15.

0.0012918 * 200 =0.25836.

0.0012918 *93.15= 0.0012918 *90=0.116262; 0.0012918 *3.15≈0.004055.

So 0.116262 +0.004055=0.120317.

So total is 0.25836 +0.120317 =0.378677.

Then divide by 0.968 (P):

0.378677 /0.968 ≈ 0.3913 L.

Which is 391.3 mL.

Hmm, but none of the options have 391. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait another thought: the calculation of the moles of KClO3. Let me recheck that.

Wait, the mass is 1.28 grams. Molar mass is 39.1 + 35.5 + (3 * 16) = 39.1 +35.5=74.6 +48=122.6 g/mol.

So 1.28 / 122.6 = 0.01049 mol. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered that the KClO3 is the only solid in the reaction, so perhaps the mass is correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is due to the number of moles? Or perhaps in the initial setup, I forgot to account for the moles correctly.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute using the number of moles correctly.

Calculating the number of moles of O2 correctly.

Yes, 3/2 * 0.01049 mol = 0.015735 mol.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is 391 mL, but there's no option for that. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the partial pressure.

Wait, 753 mm Hg (total) minus 17.5 mm Hg (water vapor) gives 735.5 mm Hg (O2). Correct.

But wait, perhaps the correct pressure to use is 735 mm Hg, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure in the vessel is 753 mm Hg, and the water vapor is 17.5 mm Hg, so the O2 pressure is 753 -17.5 =735.5 mm Hg. Correct.

So, the partial pressure of O2 is 735.5 mm Hg = 735.5 /760 atm = 0.968 atm.

So, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is 390, option G is 450. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of moles of KClO3.

Wait, 1.28 grams divided by 122.6 grams per mole. Let me compute 1.28 / 122.6.

122.6 × 0.01 =1.226 → 1.28 is 0.0128 grams more than 1.226.

Wait, 1.28 ÷ 122.6 = 0.01049.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using a calculator approach.

122.6 × 0.01049 = ?

Wait, 122.6 × 0.01 = 1.226.

122.6 ×0.00049 = 0.060 (approx).

So total is 1.226 + 0.060 =1.286, which is more than 1.28. So perhaps my initial calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles again.

Wait, 1.28 grams of KClO3.

Molar mass is 39.1 (K) +35.5 (Cl) + 3*16 (O) → 39.1+35.5=74.6; 74.6 +48=122.6 g/mol.

So 1.28 / 122.6 = 0.01049 mol. Correct.

Hmm. Ok, so I think the calculation is correct and the answer is approximately 391 mL. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the volume is in liters and I forgot to convert. Let me compute V without dividing by 1000.

Wait, no, V = (nRT)/P.

n=0.015735 mol, R=0.0821, T=293.15.

nRT = 0.015735 *0.0821 *293.15 =0.3787 L·atm.

Divide by 0.968 atm: 0.3787 /0.968 =0.3916 L =391.6 mL.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options. But the options given don't include 391. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction produces more O2. Let me double-check the stoichiometry.

Reaction: 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2.

So for each 2 moles of KClO3, you get 3 moles of O2. So the mole ratio is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law without converting to atm, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law with the pressure in atm.

Wait, another approach: compute the number of moles of O2, then use the ideal gas law with the correct units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the volume using the ideal gas equation, but correct the pressure into atm and the volume into liters.

Wait, let me recapitulate the numbers.

n=0.015735 mol.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T=293.15 K.

P=0.968 atm.

V = (nRT)/P = (0.015735 * 0.0821 * 293.15) / 0.968.

Compute numerator:

0.015735 * 0.0821 = 0.0012918.

0.0012918 *293.15 = 0.3787 L·atm.

Divide by 0.968 atm: 0.3787 /0.968 =0.3916 L.

So 0.3916 L = 391.6 mL.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is C)390 and G)450. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure calculation.

Wait, perhaps the total pressure is 753 mm Hg and the water vapor is 17.5 mm Hg, so the partial pressure of O2 is 753 -17.5=735.5 mm Hg. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use correct units for the ideal gas law, like using R in L·atm/(mol·K).

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So, the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles. Let me compute 1.28 grams of KClO3 again.

Molar mass: K is 39.1, Cl is 35.5, O is 16 each. So KClO3 is 39.1 +35.5 +3*16 = 39.1 +35.5 =74.6 +48=122.6 g/mol.

So 1.28 /122.6 = 0.01049 mol. Correct.

Hmm. I'm getting 391.6 mL, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the volume using the ideal gas law with the correct units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the volume as (nRT)/P, but without converting pressure to atm.

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but if I use R as 0.0821 L·mmHg/(mol·K), then pressure in mmHg.

So, n=0.015735 mol, R=0.0821 L·mmHg/(mol·K), T=293.15 K.

P=753 mmHg.

So V = (nRT)/P = (0.015735 * 0.0821 *293.15 ) /753.

Calculate numerator:

0.015735 * 0.0821 = 0.0012918.

0.0012918 *293.15 =0.3787 L·mmHg.

Divide by 753 mmHg: 0.3787 /753 ≈ 0.000503 L.

Convert to mL: 0.0005 L = 0.5 mL.

Wait, this is not possible, because 0.5 mL is way too small. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps R is 0.0821 L·mmHg/(mol·K). So, R = 0.0821.

Thus, V = (nRT)/P = (0.015735 * 0.0821 *293.15 ) /753.

Compute numerator: 0.015735 *0.0821 =0.0012918.

Multiply by 293.15: 0.0012918 *293.15 =0.3787 L·mmHg.

Divide by 753 mmHg: 0.3787 /753 ≈0.000503 L.

Wait, that's 0.000503 L *1000 mL/L=0.503 mL. That's way too small.

Wait, but that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute V in liters using the ideal gas equation with R in L·atm/(mol·K), and pressure in atm.

Wait, perhaps that's the mistake. Let me try that approach.

So, number of moles is 0.015735 mol.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

P=0.968 atm.

T=293.15 K.

V = (nRT)/P = (0.015735 *0.0821 *293.15 ) /0.968.

Compute numerator: 0.015735 *0.0821=0.0012918.

Multiply by 293.15: 0.0012918 *293.15=0.3787 L·atm.

Divide by 0.968 atm: 0.3787/0.968≈0.3916 L.

Which is 391.6 mL. So, same result.

Wait, but if I use the R value as 0.0821 L·mmHg/(mol·K), then the unit would be different.

But that would complicate things.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check my calculation of the moles again.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles.

Wait, 1.28 grams of KClO3.

Molar mass is 39.1 (K) +35.5 (Cl) +3*16 (O)=39.1 +35.5 =74.6 +48=122.6 g/mol.

So 1.28 /122.6 =0.01049 mol. Correct.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the calculation is correct and the volume is approximately 391.6 mL. But the options don't have that.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A. 1.8 mL

B. 2.5 mL

C. 390 mL

D. 395 mL

E. 480 mL

Wait, so option C is 390 mL. So perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles of O2.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that 1 mole of KClO3 produces 2 moles of O2. So for 2 moles KClO3 → 2 moles O2.

So moles of O2 = (moles of KClO3) * (2/2) = moles of KClO3. So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should use the ideal gas law with the correct units.

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So, I think I did that correctly.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure in the vessel is 753 mm Hg, and the water vapor is 17.5 mm Hg, so the partial pressure is 735.5 mm Hg. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the temperature is 273 K, not 293. That would be a big difference.

Wait, if T is 273 K, then V = (0.015735 *0.0821 *273)/0.968.

Compute numerator: 0.015735 *0.0821 =0.0012918.

0.0012918 *273 = 0.353 L·atm.

Divide by 0.968 atm: 0.353 /0.968 ≈0.365 L =365 mL.

Which is close to option C (390 mL). But why would the temperature be lower?

Wait, perhaps the reaction was run at lower temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the temperature into account correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the temperature. Wait, 293 K is 20°C, which is a reasonable temperature.

Hmm, I'm stuck. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 390 mL, and I should proceed with that.
</think>

To determine the volume of oxygen gas produced by the reaction, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

- Reaction: \( 2 \, \text{KClO₃} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{KCl} + 3 \, \text{O₂} \)
- Molar ratio of KClO₃ to O₂: \( 2:3 \), so moles of O₂ = \( 0.01049 \times \frac{3}{2} = 0.015735 \, \text{mol} \)
- Total pressure: 753 mmHg
- Water vapor pressure: 17.5 mmHg
- Partial pressure of O₂: \( 753 - 17.5 = 735.5 \, \text{mmHg} \)
- Convert partial pressure to atm: \( \frac{735.5}{760} = 0.968 \, \text{atm} \)
- Temperature: \( 20^\circ \text{C} = 293 \, \text{K} \)
- Gas constant: \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

### Calculation:
1. Calculate \( nRT \):
   \[
   nRT = 0.015735 \times 0.0821 \times 293 = 0.3787 \, \text{L·atm}
   \]

2. Divide by \( P \):
   \[
   V = \frac{0.3787}{0.968} = 0.3916 \, \text{L} = 391.6 \, \text{mL}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated volume of oxygen gas is approximately 391.6 mL. However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **C) 390 mL**. Given the options, **C** is the best choice.
