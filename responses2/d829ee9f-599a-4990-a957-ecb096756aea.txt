Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about treaties and whether a reservation is invalid. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about when a reservation becomes invalid under the law of treaties. The options are A, B, C, D, and E (though E isn't listed). Let's break down each option.

First, what's a reservation in the context of treaties? I remember it's a provision made by a country that doesn't affect the core treaties but is part of the treaty agreement. Like, if the treaty includes clauses about the U.S. military, that's a reservation.

Now, the key point here is about invalidation. I think treaties have rules, and certain provisions can be invalid under those rules. The law of treaties is a legal framework that defines how the treaties can be interpreted, especially in international law contexts.

So option A says a reservation is invalid when the majority of the State parties object. That doesn't sound right. If a majority objects, that would generally mean it's not in the best interest of the country, so the country might not want to accept it. But does that automatically make it invalid? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about whether the provision is necessary for the treaty's validity.

Option B suggests the reservation is invalid only when an international tribunal says so. Wait, but the law of treaties is the framework. Tribunals are separate; so if a country's reservation doesn't fit into international law, perhaps it's invalid regardless of the tribunal. Or maybe the treaty itself defines the validity, not the tribunal's ruling. I'm not certain about this one.

Option C says the reservation is invalid only when incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens). Peremptory norms are statements made by the government of a country that are considered to be necessary for the country to abide by international law. So if a reservation contradicts these norms, it might be invalid. For example, saying the U.S. can't sell arms to a country without a valid reason could be in breach of a peremptory norm. That makes sense because it's against the principle of not resting on assumptions.

Option D states the reservation is invalid when it's incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. Wait, but a reservation is part of the treaty, not the object. The object is the actual content of the treaty, like what each country is agreeing to. So D might be mixing up the concepts here. The object is about what the countries agree to, while a reservation is a clause added by the country that doesn't affect the main treaties. So maybe D is incorrect.

Putting it together, the correct reasoning is about peremptory norms. The law of treaties includes peremptory norms which are considered to be necessary for the country to abide by international law. If a reservation is incompatible with these norms, it's invalid because it's against the necessary norms of international law.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is **C: A reservation is invalid only when incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens)**.

**Explanation:**
- **Option A** is incorrect because a reservation's validity isn't solely determined by the majority of State parties' objections; it's about whether it aligns with international law principles.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the validity of a reservation under treaties is not solely determined by an international tribunal's ruling; it's governed by the framework of international law.
- **Option C** is correct because peremptory norms (jus cogens) are essential for a country to abide by international law. A reservation incompatible with these norms is invalid as it breaches necessary international law principles.
- **Option D** is incorrect as it conflates the object and purpose of the treaty with the reservation, which is an addition to the treaty, not its object.

Thus, the correct reasoning is based on the peremptory norms framework.
