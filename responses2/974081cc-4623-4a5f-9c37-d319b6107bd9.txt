Okay, so I've got this economics question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about why car prices and steel prices both increase. The options are A to E. 

First, I need to understand what's happening. Both car prices and steel prices are going up. The question says the automobile industry is fairly competitive and the supply of steel is constant in the short run. So, I'm thinking about what factors can cause both prices to rise.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Increased taxes on automobile sales. If taxes go up, that would reduce the amount people have to spend on cars, right? So if taxes increase, people's disposable income for cars would decrease, leading to lower demand. That would cause prices to fall, not rise. So that's probably not the answer.

Option B: Decreased demand for cars. If fewer people want cars, the demand curve shifts left. That would lead to lower prices because supply stays the same (assuming supply is unchanged). So that would cause both prices to go up if demand decreases and supply is constant. But wait, the question says the supply of steel is constant. Does that affect demand for cars? Hmm, maybe not directly. But I'm not sure. Let me keep this in mind and look at other options.

Option C: Increased demand for cars. If demand goes up, assuming supply is constant, prices should rise. That makes sense. So both car and steel prices going up could be due to increased demand for cars. But wait, the question mentions that the supply of steel is constant. I'm not sure how that ties in. The steel supply is a separate issue, but perhaps a change in the car industry's demand would affect both. So Option C might be a possibility.

Option D: Decreased supply of steel. But the question says the supply is constant. So this option is not correct. So D is out.

Option E: Technological advancements in car manufacturing. If cars become cheaper or more efficient, that would lower the cost for manufacturers and consumers. But wait, if supply is constant, if supply doesn't change, and cost goes down, then price would go down, not up. Unless the supply is inelastic or something. Or perhaps this is about a change in demand. Wait, but option C is about increased demand. So maybe that's another angle.

Wait, the question says the supply of steel is constant. So steel's supply doesn't change. But how does that impact car prices? Well, steel is an input in production. If the supply were to change, perhaps the cost of production would change. But the question says supply of steel is constant in the short run. So maybe not the steel's price, but the quantity. So perhaps that's not the reason for the increase in car prices.

So going back to the options, let's think about what caused both car and steel prices to go up. So scenario: Both car and steel prices go up. Let's think about possible reasons.

If the supply of steel is unchanged, but prices go up, perhaps the cost of steel is increasing. But the question says the supply is constant. That would mean the cost per unit of steel doesn't change, so that can't be the reason. Alternatively, if the demand for steel increases, but the question says supply of steel is constant. Hmm, perhaps the supply is fixed, so if demand increases, price would go up. But the question says supply is constant, so that might not apply.

Wait, maybe the supply of cars is increasing, leading to higher prices. But the question says the supply of steel is constant. So perhaps the change in steel's supply isn't the reason for the car price increase. Because the question states that the supply of steel is constant, so the cost per unit doesn't change. So perhaps the key is that the car industry's supply is affected.

Wait, the question says the supply of steel is constant in the short run. So perhaps the supply of cars is affected. For example, if steel becomes more expensive, but the question says supply of steel is constant, so that doesn't fit. Or maybe the production process for cars is getting more efficient, which would lower costs, but that would lower prices, not raise them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the demand for cars is increasing. Since the car industry is competitive, maybe more people are buying cars, leading to higher demand. If supply is fixed, then higher demand would lead to higher prices. So both car and steel prices would go up because supply is fixed. But wait, the question says the supply of steel is constant. So how is steel's price rising?

Wait, maybe the steel is an input in the car production. If the supply of steel is fixed, and the cost of steel increases, but that's not the case here. The options don't mention steel's price increasing, just the cars and steel prices. So perhaps the supply of steel isn't the reason for the price increase, but the other factors are.

Alternatively, the supply of steel being constant might mean that the cost per unit doesn't change, but perhaps the demand for cars is increasing, leading to higher prices. So that would support option C: Increased demand for cars.

Wait, but why would the supply of steel not affect the car prices? Unless the steel is part of the production process. If the supply of steel increases, it might increase the production capacity. But the question says supply of steel is constant. So perhaps that's not the case. So maybe the supply of steel is fixed, but the demand for cars is increasing, leading to higher prices. So both car and steel prices rise because the demand for cars is up, perhaps due to increased demand (option C).

Wait, but the question says the supply of steel is constant. So if the supply of steel is fixed, the cost per unit of steel doesn't change. So if the price of steel increases, that would mean each car requires more steel, which is expensive. But the question says both car and steel prices are increasing. Alternatively, perhaps the cost per car's steel component is increasing, but that's not one of the options. 

Alternatively, if the supply of cars is increasing, then the price of cars would go up if supply is constant and demand is increasing. But the question doesn't state that the supply of cars is increasing. It says the supply of steel is constant. So maybe the correct answer is C: increased demand for cars.

Wait, but then why would steel prices go up? Unless, perhaps, the cost of steel is increasing because the demand for steel increases. But the question says supply of steel is constant, so that can't be it. The question says the supply of steel is constant, so I think the supply of steel doesn't change. So the increase in steel price is due to something else, but none of the options mention that. So perhaps the steel price increase is a red herring or irrelevant to the question. 

So going back to the options, the possible answers are A, C, E. Let's see:

If supply of steel is constant, then a change in demand for cars could cause both car and steel prices to go up. Because if the demand for cars increases, and the supply of cars is fixed, then the price of cars would go up. But how about steel? If steel is an input in car production, and the supply is fixed, then the cost per unit of steel would change if the quantity supplied increases. But the question says supply of steel is constant. So perhaps the supply of cars is the main driver for the price increase. 

Alternatively, maybe the supply of steel is fixed, but the demand for cars is increasing, so both prices go up. But the question is about why both car and steel prices go up. So perhaps the correct reason is increased demand for cars (option C).

Wait, but why would the price of steel go up? If supply is constant, that can't happen. Unless the cost of steel increases because the demand for it increases. But the question says supply is constant. So perhaps this is a trick. Maybe the supply of steel is fixed, but the demand for cars is increasing, leading to higher car prices, but why would steel prices go up? Unless, perhaps, the cost of steel increases because of something else, not the supply. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the supply of steel is fixed, so the cost per unit doesn't change. So that the price of steel is determined by the cost, which is fixed. So why would steel prices go up? Or perhaps the steel is an input in the production and the cost increases because the demand for cars increases, but that's not reflected in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: technological advancements in car manufacturing. If cars become more efficient, that would lower the cost of production, which would lower the price of cars. So that's not the case. Because the question says both car and steel prices go up. So that's not the answer.

So, going back, the main cause is increased demand for cars (option C). Because with a fixed supply, higher demand leads to higher prices. So both car and steel prices would go up. But wait, the question doesn't give any reason for steel prices to go up. Or does it? The question says both prices go up, so maybe it's because steel is a component in car production, and if the supply of cars increases, the cost of steel would increase. But the question says supply of steel is constant. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in steel price is due to an increase in demand for steel, but the question says supply is fixed. So maybe the steel price is unaffected. That complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the supply of steel is fixed, so the cost per unit doesn't change. So if the price of steel goes up, that would be due to something else, but no options mention that. So perhaps the correct answer is C: increased demand for cars, leading to higher prices.

So looking at the options, the correct answer should be C: Increased demand for cars. Because a constant supply would cause higher demand for cars, leading to higher prices. But why would steel prices go up? Unless the question is a trick, but the options don't mention that. So perhaps the intended answer is C.

The question asks why both the price of cars and the price of steel increase, given that the automobile industry is competitive and the supply of steel is constant in the short run. Let's analyze the options:

- **Option A: Increased taxes on automobile sales**  
  If taxes increase, it would reduce disposable income, leading to lower demand for cars. This would cause both prices to fall, not rise. **Not correct.**

- **Option B: Decreased demand for cars**  
  If demand decreases, prices would fall. However, the question states that both car and steel prices are rising, so this option doesn't explain the increase in steel prices. **Not correct.**

- **Option C: Increased demand for cars**  
  If demand for cars increases, and the supply of cars is fixed, prices would rise. This aligns with the observation that both car and steel prices are going up. While the supply of steel is constant, the increase in car demand is the primary reason for the car price increase. **Correct.**

- **Option D: Decreased supply of steel**  
  The question specifies that the supply of steel is constant, so this option is irrelevant. **Not correct.**

- **Option E: Technological advancements in car manufacturing**  
  Technological advancements could lower production costs, potentially lowering car prices. However, the question states that both car and steel prices are rising, which suggests a change in demand for cars rather than supply changes. **Not correct.**

The most plausible explanation is that the increased demand for cars leads to higher prices, even though the supply of steel remains constant. The increase in steel prices is not explained by the given options.

**Answer: C**
