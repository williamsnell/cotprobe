Okay, so I've got this question about a nonprofit environmental group and how they're trying to use a social psychological principle to increase contributions. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the group offers a free gift of address labels in a letter asking for contributions. The options are various social psychological concepts. Hmm, I need to figure out which one applies here.

First, the scenario involves a nonprofit group giving a reward to encourage donations. It's like a free gesture to get people to contribute. So, the group is trying to use a strategy where people are motivated by something tangible and a reward.

Looking at the options, each represents a different psychological principle. I remember that some of these relate to group behavior and motivation. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Compliance strategy. That's when people follow rules as instructed. The group is giving a reward, so maybe they're trying to make people comply by offering something. That sounds plausible.

Option B: Confirmation bias. That's when people notice things that fit their beliefs and ignore others. I don't think that's what's happening here. The group is offering a reward, expecting donations, so they're probably not using confirmation bias.

Option C: Social loafing. That's when people underload, meaning they don't contribute as much as they could. The group is offering a reward, so maybe they're trying to prevent that by encouraging more contributions, so this might be the opposite of what's happening.

Option D: Self-fulfilling prophecy. That's when someone's expectation causes a negative outcome. I don't think that's relevant here; the group is trying to give a reward, not have someone's expectation cause them to act badly.

Option E: Groupthink. This is when a group prioritizes harmony over diversity, leading to poor decision-making. The group is offering a reward, which might prevent people from thinking more objectively, but I'm not sure if that's what the question is about. Maybe not directly applicable here.

Option F: Stable attribution. This is about how we attribute our successes to our own actions and failures to others'. The group is giving a free reward, so it's more about the reward than personal attributes. Not sure if this fits.

Option G: Halo effect. That's when a positive trait in one area leads to a positive outcome in another. The group is giving a reward, which could be tied to environmental contributions, so maybe the group's positive image helps others contribute more. That's a possibility.

Option H: Halo effect. Wait, I just thought maybe I misread, but it's the same as option G. Maybe it's a different effect here.

Option I: Bystander effect. When a group is in the way, it makes it harder for others to contribute. But the question is about offering a reward, not about being blocked.

Option J: Fundamental attribution error. That's the idea that people have different reasons for feeling successful. The group's offering a reward might be contributing to that, but I'm not sure if that's the main strategy here.

Wait, going back, the group is offering a free gift to encourage donations. This is similar to the "free good" principle in psychology, where giving something small can increase the likelihood of someone taking the action. So they're using a compliance strategy, which is option A.

Alternatively, the free good theory suggests that giving a small reward can make people comply with requests, especially when it's a group effort. So the group is using a compliance strategy to make people contribute.

Another angle: Groupthink might be about not thinking beyond the group, but perhaps the group is encouraging people to contribute by providing a small incentive, which could be a form of social pressure, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the compliance strategy.

Wait, compliance strategy is more about people following rules because they're told to, which can lead to higher contributions. The free good theory supports this idea, as people would comply more easily when a small reward is given. So the answer should be A: compliance strategy.

The nonprofit environmental group's strategy to offer a free gift of address labels is likely intended to use the **compliance strategy**. This principle involves encouraging people to comply with rules or requests by offering a tangible reward, which can enhance their motivation to contribute. The free good theory supports this approach, as providing a small incentive can increase compliance and, consequently, donations.

Answer: A
