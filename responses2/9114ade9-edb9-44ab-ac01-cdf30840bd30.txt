Okay, so I've got this problem about freezing point depression. Hmm, I remember that the formula involves the molality of the solute and the freezing point constant. Let me think.

The question says the molal freezing point constant (Kf) is 0.500°C. Oh wait, wait. The freezing point goes down by 0.125°C when 26.4 grams of solute is dissolved in 250 grams of the solvent. So the solution's freezing point is 0.125°C below pure solvent.

I think the formula is ΔT_f = Kf * m, where m is the molality. Oh right, molality is moles of solute per kg of solvent. So I need to find the molality first.

Wait, the mass of solvent is 250 grams. That's 0.25 kg. So I can rearrange the formula to find molality m = ΔT_f / Kf. Let me plug in the numbers: 0.125°C divided by 0.500°C per mol/kg. Hmm, 0.125 / 0.5 = 0.25 mol/kg. So m is 0.25 mol/kg.

Now, m is moles solute per kilogram solvent. So moles solute = m * kg of solvent. Wait, the solvent is 0.25 kg, so 0.25 mol/kg * 0.25 kg = 0.0625 moles. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, let me check the calculation. Oh no, wait, 0.25 kg solvent would be 0.25 kg, so 0.25 kg * 0.25 mol/kg = 0.0625 moles. So the solute is 0.0625 moles.

The solute's mass is 26.4 grams, which is 0.0264 kg. To find the molecular weight, we divide the mass by the moles. So MW = mass / moles = 0.0264 kg / 0.0625 mol. Let me calculate that. 0.0264 divided by 0.0625.

Wait, 0.0264 / 0.0625. Let's do this in steps. 0.0264 ÷ 0.0625 = same as (264 x 1e-3) / (62.5 x 1e-3) )= 264 / 62.5. 264 divided by 62.5. Let's see: 62.5 * 4 is 250, so 4, and 14 left. 14 /62.5 is 0.224. So total is 4.224. So molecular weight is 4.224 g/mol. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me go through again.

ΔT_f is 0.125°C, Kf is 0.500°C·kg/mol. So m = ΔT / Kf = 0.125 / 0.5 = 0.25 mol/kg.

Moles of solute = m * kg solvent = 0.25 mol/kg * 0.25 kg = 0.0625 moles.

Mass of solute is 26.4 grams = 0.0264 kg? Wait no, grams is mass, so I should convert to kg for molality. So 26.4 g is 0.0264 kg. Oh wait, no, molarity is moles per kg solvent, but molality is moles per kg solvent, regardless of what the solvent is. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but then the molecular weight is (mass)/(moles) = 0.0264 kg? Wait, no, because kg is kg, but the grams are in grams. Oh wait, no, the mass of the solute is 26.4 grams, which is 0.0264 kg. So I think I did that right.

So MW = (0.0264 kg) / (0.0625 mol) = 0.4224 kg/mol. Wait, because kg is 1e3 g, so 0.0264 kg is 26.4 grams.

Wait, wait, 0.0264 kg is 26.4 grams. So 26.4 grams is the mass. So 26.4 grams = 0.0264 kg. So 0.0264 kg divided by 0.0625 mol equals 0.4224 kg/mol? No, wait, 0.0264 / 0.0625 is 0.4224 kg per mol. Oh wait, no. Wait, kg divided by mol is kg/mol, correct.

Wait, 0.0264 divided by 0.0625: let me compute that. 0.0264 / 0.0625 = (264e-3) / (62.5e-3) = 264/62.5 = let's compute that.

62.5 × 4 = 250. So 4, and 14 left. 14 /62.5 is 0.224. So total is 4.224. So MW is 4.224 kg/mol, but wait, kg/mol would be 4224 g/mol? No, wait. Wait, kg is 1e3 grams. So 4.224 kg is 4224 grams. Wait, no, no, wait, 4.224 kg/mol is 4224 grams per mole? No, wait, no. Because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 4.224 kg/mol is 4224 g/mol. Wait, but that doesn't fit any given options.

Wait, the options are A:422.4, B:600, etc. So 422.4 is option A. Oh wait, so I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. Oh! Wait, perhaps I forgot that the solute's mass is in grams. Let me double-check the steps.

Molar mass is mass (g) / moles. So yes, the mass is 26.4 grams, correct.

Moles calculated as 0.25 (mol/kg) * 0.25 kg = 0.0625 moles. Correct.

So MW = 26.4 g / 0.0625 mol = 26.4 / 0.0625 = 422.4 g/mol. Oh! So that's option A.

Wait, so earlier I thought I made an error in the calculation, but perhaps I was miscalculating the division. Oh, yes, because 26.4 / 0.0625 is 422.4. So the correct molecular weight is 422.4 g/mol, which is option A.

To calculate the molecular weight of the solute, we use the formula for freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \(\Delta T_f = 0.125^\circ \text{C}\),
- \(K_f = 0.500^\circ \text{C} \cdot \text{kg/mol}\),
- \(m\) is the molality of the solute.

Rearranging the formula to solve for molality \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f} = \frac{0.125}{0.500} = 0.25 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

Next, calculate the moles of solute using the molality and the mass of the solvent:

\[
\text{Moles of solute} = m \cdot \text{mass of solvent (in kg)} = 0.25 \cdot 0.25 = 0.0625 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The mass of the solute is given as \(26.4 \, \text{g}\), which is \(0.0264 \, \text{kg}\). The molecular weight (\(M\)) is calculated as:

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{moles of solute}} = \frac{0.0264}{0.0625} = 4.224 \, \text{kg/mol}.
\]

Since \(1 \, \text{kg/mol} = 1000 \, \text{g/mol}\), the molecular weight is:

\[
M = 4.224 \cdot 1000 = 4224 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

However, this result does not match the provided options. Rechecking the calculation, the correct molecular weight is:

\[
M = \frac{26.4}{0.0625} = 422.4 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: A**
