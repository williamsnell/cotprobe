Okay, so I've got this Laplace transform problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding i(0^+), the current right after the switch is closed. The Laplace transform of i(t) is given as I(s) = (E - V(0^+)) divided by [R(s + (1/(RC)))].

Wait, Laplace transforms... Right, I remember that the Laplace transform of a step function is 1/(s) when the step is at t=0. But wait, this is a bit different. Let me parse the equation again. The numerator is (E - V(0^+)), which I think is the initial voltage across a capacitor. Because when you close a switch, the initial voltage V(0^+) across a capacitor is given by E multiplied by the step function, so V(0^+) = E * [u(t)], so V(0^+) is E. Hmm, but wait, no: when a switch is closed, the capacitor is initially uncharged, so V(0^+) is E multiplied by the step function at t=0. So V(0^+) is E. Wait, no, because when the switch is closed, the capacitor is initially at 0 V if it's an ideal capacitor. So if you apply a step input E, then V(0^+) would be E. Or wait, perhaps E is the applied voltage. Let me think again.

The Laplace transform equation is I(s) = (E - V(0^+)) / [R(s + 1/(RC))]. So the denominator is R multiplied by (s + 1/(RC)). The denominator's s term is characteristic of an RC circuit, probably an RC circuit in parallel with a resistor, perhaps making a low-pass filter. The numerator is (E - V(0^+)).

Hmm, but wait, let me think about the form of the Laplace transform. The form (A) / [s + B] suggests an exponential response, like e^{-Bt}. In this equation, the denominator is s + 1/(RC), so B is 1/(RC). The numerator is (E - V(0^+)).

Wait, but if the current I(s) is given by that expression, then maybe the inverse Laplace transform would give us the current i(t). Let me try to find i(t) by taking the inverse Laplace.

The expression is (E - V0) / [ R (s + 1/(R C)) ] where V0 is V(0+). So the expression could be rewritten as (E - V0) / R multiplied by 1/(s + 1/(RC)).

The inverse Laplace of 1/(s + a) is e^{-a t}, so this would become (E - V0)/(R) * e^{-(1/(RC)) t}.

So the current i(t) is (E - V0)/R multiplied by e^{-t/(RC)}. Now, to find i(0^+), we plug t=0 into this expression.

Wait, but wait, when t approaches zero, e^{-0} is 1. So i(0^+) equals (E - V0)/R. Because if t approaches zero, i(t) approaches (E - V0)/R.

But wait, V0 is V(0^+), which I thought was E, but wait, that would imply that E and V0 are the same. But that doesn't make sense because then i(0) would be zero. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating V(0^+).

Wait, V(0^+) is the initial voltage across the capacitor at t=0+. If the capacitor is initially uncharged, then V(0^+) is zero, right? Because when you switch on the capacitor, it starts charging, and at t=0, it's at 0 V if it's a zero initial voltage condition. Or, wait, perhaps the capacitor is in a different configuration. Let me think.

Wait, the question says V(0^+). The function is E - V(0^+), which is in the numerator of I(s). So E is the applied voltage, and V(0^+) is the initial voltage across a capacitor. If it's a capacitor in series with a resistor, then perhaps the initial voltage is zero. Alternatively, if it's a voltage source in series with a resistor and a capacitor in parallel, the initial voltage V(0^+) would be E * step function. Wait, perhaps I need to model this more carefully.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the Laplace transform of i(t) is given, and I need to find i(0^+). The options are all in terms of E and V(0^+). So let me think.

The Laplace transform given is I(s) = (E - V0) / [ R(s + 1/(RC)) ] where V0 is V(0^+).

So I(s) = (E - V0) / R * [ 1/(s + 1/(RC)) ]

The inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s + a) is e^{-a t}, so the inverse of I(s) is (E - V0)/(R) * e^{-t/(RC)}.

Wait, okay, so i(t) = (E - V0)/R * e^{-t/(RC)}.

At t=0^+, e^{-0} is 1, so i(0^+) is (E - V0)/R.

But wait, what is V0? V0 is V(0^+), the initial voltage across the capacitor. So if the circuit is a simple RC circuit with a capacitor in parallel with a resistor, then the initial voltage across the capacitor is zero (since it's at the moment the switch is closed). So when the step voltage E is applied, the capacitor starts charging, so V(0^+) would be zero. Or perhaps it's the voltage source that's applied, and the capacitor is initially uncharged.

Wait, but if the capacitor is being charged, then V(0^+) is zero. So in that case, (E - V0) would be E, because V0 is zero. So i(0^+) would be E/R.

Looking at the options, option J is [E - V0]/R. But if V0 is zero, then J becomes E/R. So that would be i(0^+). So the correct answer would be J.

But wait, wait a second. Is V0 zero?

Alternatively, perhaps the capacitor is part of a different configuration. Let me think again about the Laplace transform.

Wait, perhaps the form of the Laplace transform is (E - V0) multiplied by 1/R, and the denominator is (s + 1/(RC)). So that would mean that the current is (E - V0)/(R) multiplied by e^{-t/(RC)}, as before.

So i(0^+) is (E - V0)/R.

But what is V0? It's the initial voltage across the capacitor at t=0^+.

In the context of the circuit, if the capacitor is initially at zero, then V0 is zero. So (E - V0) is E. So i(0^+) is E/R, which is option J.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is [E - V(0^+)] / R. So if V(0^+) is zero, then J is E/R.

But let me think if that makes sense. Suppose E is applied, but the capacitor is initially uncharged, so it starts charging. The initial current would be (E - 0)/R, which is E/R. So that's correct.

Wait, but another possibility is that perhaps the capacitor is in a different configuration. Suppose the circuit is a voltage source in parallel with a resistor and a current source in series. No, I think I'm going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps the circuit is such that the capacitor is in series with a resistor, and the current is flowing through both. So the initial voltage V(0^+) is the voltage across the capacitor at t=0+, which is zero. So the expression i(0^+) is (E - 0)/R = E/R, which would be option J.

But looking at the options, option J is [E - V(0^+)] / R. So yes.

Wait, but the options also have other forms. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: [E/(v(0^+) * R)]

B: [v(0^+) - E]/R

C: [E*v(0^+)]/R

D: [E - v(0^+)]*R

E: [E*R/(v(0^+)-1)]

F: [E + R]/[v(0^+) + RC]

G: [(E - v(0^+))/(R + RC)]

H: [E + v(0^+)] / R

I: [E*(v(0^+) +1)]/R

J: [E - v(0^+)] / R

So J is [E - V(0^+)] / R, which would be correct if V(0^+) is zero. But if V(0^+) is not zero, then what happens?

Wait, perhaps I got the expression wrong. Let me make sure. The Laplace transform is I(s) = (E - V(0^+)) / [R(s + 1/(RC))]. So the inverse transform would be (E - V0)/R * e^{-t/(RC)}. So i(t) is (E - V0)/(R) * e^{-t/(RC)}.

At t=0, e^0 is 1, so i(0^+) is (E - V0)/R.

But what is V0? It's the initial voltage across the capacitor. If the capacitor is initially uncharged, then V0 is zero. So i(0^+) is E/R.

So the correct answer is option J.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is [E - V(0^+)] / R. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. Suppose the current i(t) is the current through the resistor. If I have a capacitor in parallel with a resistor, and if the capacitor is initially uncharged, then the initial current would be zero. Because the initial voltage is zero. So if I= (E - 0)/R, as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial condition is different. Let me think about the initial conditions for circuits.

In an RC circuit, the initial voltage across the capacitor is zero if it's uncharged, and then it charges to E when the step is applied. So V(0^+) is zero.

So, with that, the expression [E - V(0^+)] / R is E/R. So the current at t=0^+ is E/R.

Looking back at the options, option J is [E - V(0^+)] / R. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is different, such as the input being the sum of a capacitor and a resistor in parallel, but I think I've considered the most straightforward scenario.

So, the correct answer is J.

To determine \( i(0^+) \), the current immediately after the switch is closed, we start with the given Laplace transform of the current:

\[
I(s) = \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R(s + \frac{1}{RC})}
\]

### Step 1: Inverse Laplace Transform
The inverse Laplace transform of \( I(s) \) is:

\[
i(t) = \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R} e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate at \( t = 0^+ \)
At \( t = 0^+ \), the exponential term \( e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} \) becomes 1. Thus:

\[
i(0^+) = \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R}
\]

### Step 3: Interpret \( V(0^+) \)
\( V(0^+) \) is the initial voltage across the capacitor at \( t = 0^+ \). For an ideal capacitor that is initially uncharged, \( V(0^+) = 0 \) if there is no source applied at \( t = 0^+ \). Therefore:

\[
i(0^+) = \frac{E - 0}{R} = \frac{E}{R}
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The expression \( \frac{E - V(0^+)}{R} \) matches **Option J**. Thus, the correct answer is:
