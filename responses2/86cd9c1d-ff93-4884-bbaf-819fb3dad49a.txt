Okay, so I've got this psychology question here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a situation where a psychologist is subpoenaed to testify at a deposition. The options are A to J, each giving a different possible answer. The key part is understanding what the subpoena implies about the psychologist's actions.

I remember from my studies that when a psychologist is subpoenaed for testimony, it's a formal request. The phrase "sub subpoenaed" usually means that the person must provide certain documents or information. The deposition is a process where a client presents their case, and the psychologist's testimony is a crucial part of that.

So, the options are about what the psychologist must do. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Must present a detailed analysis. That sounds like a demand for specific information rather than a subpoena. Sub subpoenaed is more about providing information, not necessarily detailed analysis.

Option B: Must appear at the deposition. Hmm, this is about the actual presence, not the type of testimony. Sub subpoenaed doesn't require the psychologist to show up, just to testify.

Option C: Must testify about the client as requested. That seems directly related. The subpoena would likely require the psychologist to testify about the client's case as demanded.

Option D: Must provide a written statement. That's more about the nature of the testimony than the requirement of appearing. So it's not the strongest answer.

Option E: Can choose not to attend. The subpoena itself doesn't imply that the psychologist can choose not to come; it's about what they must do, not what they can choose.

Option F: Must reveal all details. Again, this is about the content of the testimony, not about the action taken.

Option G: Must discontinue therapy. That's not related to the subpoena. The subpoena is about testimony, not therapy termination.

Option H: Can refuse to testify on grounds of confidential. I think this is about the client's confidentiality. But the question is about the psychologist's actions, not whether they can refuse.

Option I: Can expect a court order. The subpoena is about the client's case, not future court orders.

Option J: Must provide requested documents. This refers to providing specific documents needed for the deposition, like records, etc. But the subpoena for testimony doesn't require providing those, unless it's part of the deposition process.

Wait, I might be confusing some points. So, when a person is subpoenaed, they must provide the requested documents. So, the deposition would require the psychologist to provide certain documents, like those from the client. So the deposition requires the psychologist to provide the documents (as in J option). But the question is about what must happen because of the subpoena.

Wait, no. The question is about the actions a psychologist must take because a subpoena is made. So the key is what must happen as a result of the subpoena.

The options are about the action the psychologist must take. The subpoena is a formal request, but it doesn't necessarily mean the psychologist can refuse to testify if they can't. But the main point is that they must testify about the client because they're subpoenaed. So option C says must testify as requested. That's correct.

So the correct answer should be C: must testify about the client as requested.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So I need to make sure that the answer I choose ends with 'e'.

Looking at the options, let me check each letter.

A: ends with A. So no.

B: ends with B. No.

C: ends with C. Yes.

D: ends with D. No.

E: ends with E. Yes, but the option is about choice, not the letter.

Wait, the question is about what must happen because of the subpoena, not the letter. So I need to pick the correct option, regardless of the letter.

So the correct answer is C, which is about testify as requested. Sub subpoenas typically require the testimony, so the psychologist must testify as the subpoena is made.

The correct answer is C: must testify about the client as requested. A subpoena necessitates the psychologist to provide the requested information and testify about the client's case. 

Answer: C
