Okay, so I need to figure out when the first Buddhist temple was constructed in Japan. Hmm, I'm a bit new to Buddhist history, but I'll try to think it through.

Buddhist temples are a big part of Buddhist architecture, right? I remember that Buddhism has been around for a long time, but the specifics of temple construction vary. I'm thinking maybe the earliest temples were built in the 3rd or 4th century CE.

Wait, I think the earliest Buddhist temple in Japan was constructed around 119 CE. That makes sense because I remember a temple in Japan which is now known as the Buddha's Temple. I think it was constructed in the 3rd or 4th century. Let me try to recall the exact dates. Oh yes, around 119 CE, which is option B. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: 119 CE.
