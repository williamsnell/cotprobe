Okay, so I have this question about Christopher Heath Wellman's position. Hmm, I remember he's a big name in immigration law. Let me think about what he said. So, the question asks which option correctly describes his position.

The options are labeled A to J. I need to pick the correct one. Wellman's main idea, if I recall correctly, is about how nation-states should handle immigration. He probably emphasized that nation-states have a duty to protect their own citizens, not just the immigrants. So, if someone is a citizen of a nation-state, they should be protected, even if they're an immigrant.

Looking at the options:

A: Nation-states have a presumptive right to close borders to all potential immigrants. Wait, that sounds like a safeguard, but wellman's position might not be about a right but an obligation. So maybe A is not correct.

B: Nation-states have an obligation to close borders to protect their own citizens. That seems more in line with what Wellman said. He's not just a safeguard, he's about protection.

C: Closing borders to all potential immigrations is an inherently racist social policy. I don't think he's saying anything about race or racism. His focus is on protection, not about discrimination.

D: Anti-egalitarianism incompatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. Hmm, anti-egalitarianism might relate to immigration, but I'm not sure he directly links it to cosmopolitanism. Maybe not the best fit.

E: Anti-egalitarianism is compatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. Again, I'm not sure about the connection here. Wellman's stance is more about protection, not necessarily compatible or incompatible.

F: Nation-states have an obligation to open borders to least well-off immigrants. That seems more about the approach than the main point. Wellman's focus is likely on the obligation, not the specific group.

G: All borders should be open, no restrictions on immigration. That's too broad and doesn't align with what I remember about his stance.

H: abolished nation-states and a global government. Wellman doesn't support abolishing nation-states; he emphasizes protection.

I: Potential immigrants have a right to cross any border they choose. Wait, that's a different point. He might have said something about being able to choose where to cross, but the question is about his position.

J: Prioritize citizens over immigrants. Wellman's position is about protecting citizens, not about which group is preferred.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. I think Wellman's position is that nation-states have an obligation to protect their own citizens, not just the immigrants. So option B says nation-states have an obligation to close borders to protect their own citizens. That sounds right.

Alternatively, option I says immigrants have a right to cross any border, which seems more about the ability to cross rather than protection. But the question is about his position, which is more about protecting citizens, not the right to cross.

So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: nation-states have an obligation to close their borders to protect their own citizens.
