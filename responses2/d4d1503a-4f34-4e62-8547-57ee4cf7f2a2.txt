Okay, so I have this differential equation problem to solve using Euler's method. Let me think through this step by step. The equation given is dp/dx = 0.5 * x * (1 - x), and the initial condition is p(0) = 2. I need to approximate p(2) with a step size of 1.

Hmm, Euler's method is a numerical way to approximate solutions to differential equations. I remember that the formula is p_{n+1} = p_n + h * f(x_n, p_n), where h is the step size. In this case, h is 1.

So, the initial point is x_0 = 0, p_0 = 2. I'll need to take steps from x=0 to x=2, which is two steps since each step is 1 unit. Let's break it down.

First step: x = 0 to x = 1.
The function f(x, p) is 0.5 * x * (1 - x). At x=0, f(0, 2) = 0.5 * 0 * (1-0) = 0. So, p_1 = p_0 + h * f = 2 + 1*0 = 2.

Second step: x = 1 to x = 2.
Now, f(1, 2) is 0.5 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 0.5 *1 *0=0. So, p_2 = p_1 + 1*0 = 2 + 0=2.

Wait, but that gives p(2) as 2. Looking at the options, option G is 2.0. So, is that the answer?

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I compute the function correctly? Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate for the second step more carefully.

At x=1, f(1, p) is 0.5 *1*(1-1) = 0.5 * 1 *0=0. So, p at x=1 is still 2. Then at x=2, f(2, 2) is 0.5*2*(1-2)=0.5*2*(-1) = -1. So, p(2) would be p(1) + h*(-1) = 2 + 1*(-1) = 1.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me redo the steps.

First step: x0=0, p0=2. h=1.

f(x0, p0) = 0.5*0*(1-0)=0. So, p1 = 2 + 1*0 =2.

Second step: x1=1, p1=2. f(x1, p1) =0.5*1*(1-1) =0. So, p2=2 +1*0=2.

Wait, but then p(2) is 2. But that's conflicting with the previous calculation where I thought it was 1. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the second step.

Wait, I think I messed up the function evaluation. Wait, f(x, p) is 0.5 * x * (1 -x). So for x=1, that's 0.5 *1*(0)=0. So, f is 0. So, p doesn't change.

Wait, but that would mean p(2) is 2. So the correct answer would be option G:2.0.

Wait, but the initial problem says the differential equation is ∂p/∂x = 0.5x(1−x), and the solution in the first step is 2, and the second step also 2. So after two steps (x from 0 to 2), p(2)=2. So yes, option G.

The problem requires using Euler's method to approximate \( p(2) \) for the differential equation \( \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = 0.5 \cdot x \cdot (1 - x) \) with the initial condition \( p(0) = 2 \) and a step size of 1. 

Euler's method updates the solution as \( p_{n+1} = p_n + h \cdot f(x_n, p_n) \), where \( h = 1 \) and \( f(x, p) = 0.5 \cdot x \cdot (1 - x) \). Starting with \( x_0 = 0 \), \( p_0 = 2 \):

1. **First step (x = 0 to x = 1):**
   - \( f(0, 2) = 0.5 \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - 0) = 0 \)
   - \( p_1 = p_0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 2 \)

2. **Second step (x = 1 to x = 2):**
   - \( f(1, 2) = 0.5 \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0 \)
   - \( p_2 = p_1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 2 \)

Thus, \( p(2) \) is approximated as 2.0, corresponding to option G.
