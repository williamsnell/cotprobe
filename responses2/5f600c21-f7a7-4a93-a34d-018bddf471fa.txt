Okay, so I have this Python question here: 1 + 3 % 3. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Python, but let's think this through step by step. 

First, I remember that in Python, the modulo operator is %, and it gives the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, 3 % 3 would be the remainder when 3 is divided by 3. Wait, what's the remainder here? I think 3 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 0. So 3%3 equals 0.

But wait, the expression is 1 + 3 % 3. Oh right, the order of operations matters in Python. I think the modulo operator has higher precedence than addition. So, I should compute 3 % 3 first, then add 1.

So, 3 % 3 is 0. Then 1 + 0 is 1. So the result should be 1.

Looking at the options, option D is 1, so that's probably the answer. Let me double-check. The options are A to J, with D being 1. Yep, that makes sense.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the order of operations? Sometimes, parentheses can change things, but in this case, the % is in the same level as the +. So the calculation is definitely 3 % 3 first. So 3%3 is 0, and adding 1 gives 1. So yeah, D is correct.

The expression 1 + 3 % 3 evaluates to 1 because 3%3 is 0, so adding 1 gives 1.

Answer: D
