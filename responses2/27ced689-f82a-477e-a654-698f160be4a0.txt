Okay, so I've got this question about evolution and the work of Charles Darwin. I remember that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is pretty famous and I've heard a lot about it. The question is asking which statement Darwin would have rejected. The options are A, B, and C.

Let me think about each option one by one. 

Option A says, "Environmental change plays a role in evolution." I know that Darwin himself was pretty critical of modern evolutionary theory. He thought that natural selection was the key mechanism, but he didn't believe in the idea of "survival of the fittest." He believed that organisms are just suited to their environment, not necessarily that the environment is the reason for their survival. So I'm pretty sure A is a statement Darwin would reject.

Option B states, "The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism." Darwin's theory suggests that evolution doesn't work on the smallest units because selection would have acted on them. In fact, he thought that the smallest units are molecules like water or ions, which don't have enough variation to undergo selection. So B is probably something he would have rejected. But I'm not 100% sure; I'll keep this in mind.

Option C says, "Inherited variation in a population is a necessary precondition for natural selection to operate." I remember that natural selection relies on variation within a population. Adapted individuals are more likely to pass on their genes, which is the key point. So this seems like a statement Darwin would accept because it's part of the foundation of his theory. So C isn't the answer.

So, putting it together: the question is which is Darwin's rejection. So between A and B. Both are about evolution and natural selection. But I think Darwin rejected environmental change as the cause. He thought it's not about the environment but the organisms' own traits that matter. So A is the one he would reject. B is a statement he might accept, but the question is which he rejected, so the answer is A.
