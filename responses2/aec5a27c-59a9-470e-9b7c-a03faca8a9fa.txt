Okay, so I have this function f(x, y) = [(x² - y²)/(x² + y²)](1). Wait, actually, the way it's written, I think the function is (x² - y²) divided by (x² + y²). I need to determine if it's continuous at the origin, (0,0). 

Hmm, continuity at a point means that the limit as (x, y) approaches (0,0) should equal the function's value at that point. But wait, in this case, what's the value at (0,0)? Oh, wait, the function isn't defined there because the denominator becomes zero. So f(0,0) isn't defined. But maybe the limit exists?

I remember that when dealing with functions of two variables, the limit depends on the path you approach the point. If the limit varies depending on the path, the function isn't continuous at that point. So I need to check the limit along different paths approaching (0,0).

Let me think of some paths. First, along y = 0. If I set y=0, then f(x,0) becomes (x² - 0)/(x² + 0) = x²/x² = 1. So as x approaches 0, the limit is 1. But wait, the function isn't defined along y=0 except at x=0. Wait, but when approaching from different paths, the limit might change.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when approaching along y=0, the function is 1 everywhere except at (0,0), where it's undefined. So the limit as (x,y) approaches (0,0) along y=0 is 1. 

What about along another path, like y = x. Let me substitute y=x into the function. So f(x,x) = (x² - x²)/(x² + x²) = 0/(2x²) = 0. So as x approaches 0, the limit is 0. 

Hmm, so along y=0, the limit is 1, but along y=x, it's 0. That means the limit isn't the same along different paths. Therefore, the overall limit as (x,y) approaches (0,0) doesn't exist because it varies. 

Wait, but wait. The function is (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). Let me calculate the limit along y = kx, where k is some constant. Substitute y = kx into f: (x² - (k x)^2)/(x² + (k x)^2) = (x² (1 - k²))/(x² (1 + k²)) = (1 -k²)/(1 +k²). 

So the limit depends on k. So if I choose different k, I get different limits. For example, when k=1, the limit is (1-1)/(1+1)=0. When k=0, the limit is 1. For any other k, say k=2, it's (1-4)/(1+4)= (-3)/5, so -0.6. 

So as k varies, the limit along y=kx changes. That means the limit doesn't exist because it's path-dependent. So the function isn't continuous at (0,0) because the limit doesn't equal any particular value.

Wait, but the question is about continuity. So if the limit doesn't exist, the function isn't continuous. So the answer would be E: The function is continuous at all points except along the line y=x? Wait, no. Wait, the function isn't defined along y=0, because f(x,0) is 1 when x≠0, but when x=0, it's undefined. But wait, along y=0, the function isn't defined at (0,0). So is the function discontinuous along y=0? Because f approaches 1 as you approach (0,0) along y=0, but the function isn't defined there. Similarly, along y=x, the function approaches 0 but isn't defined at (0,0). So along y=x, the function isn't defined at that point, which is part of the domain. So the function isn't continuous along y=x because it's not defined at (0,0). Similarly, along y=0, the function isn't defined at (0,0), so that's a separate line of discontinuity.

Wait, but in the options, option F says the function is continuous at all points except along the line y=x. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me re-examine. 

Wait, for continuity, the function must approach the same limit along every path approaching the point, and the function must be defined at that point. But in this case, the function isn't defined at (0,0). So even if the limit exists, the function isn't continuous because it's not defined there. So the function isn't continuous at (0,0) because it's undefined. 

But what about along other paths? For example, along y=x, the function isn't defined at (0,0). So the function isn't continuous along y=x because the point (0,0) isn't even in its domain. Similarly, along y=0, the function is defined at (0,0) as 1, but the limit along y=0 is 1, which matches. But wait, no, because along y=0, the function is 1 everywhere except at (0,0), which is undefined. So approaching (0,0) along y=0, the function approaches 1, but at (0,0), it's undefined. So the function is discontinuous along y=0. Similarly, along y=x, the function isn't defined at (0,0), so it's discontinuous there.

Wait, but the options don't directly address that. Let me re-examine the options. 

Option F: The function is continuous at all points except along the line y = x. Wait, but the function isn't defined at (0,0), and along y=x, the point (0,0) is on that line, so the function isn't defined along that line. So, every point on the line y=x is a point where the function isn't defined, except maybe (0,0), but it's not the only point. So the function is discontinuous along y=x. 

Wait, but let me think again. The function f(x,y) is (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). Let's see if it's continuous everywhere except at (0,0). Because at (0,0), the denominator is zero, so it's undefined.

Wait, so when you approach (0,0) along different paths, the limits are different. For example, approaching along y=0 gives 1, but along y=x gives 0. So the limit doesn't exist, which means the function isn't continuous at (0,0) because the limit doesn't equal the function's value (which is undefined here). But wait, the function isn't defined at (0,0), so regardless of the limit, it's discontinuous there.

So the function is discontinuous at (0,0), and along the line y=x, because along that line, the function isn't defined at (0,0). So the function isn't continuous along y=x either. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the options are about continuity at the origin. So the question is whether f is continuous at (0,0). But since f is undefined there, and the limit doesn't exist, it's not continuous at that point. So option A would be incorrect. 

Wait, but looking at the options again. The options are: 

A: The function is continuous at (0,0) 
B: Continuous along y=x
C: Removable discontinuity at origin
D: Continuous along y=-x
E: Continuous at all points
F: Continuous except along y=x
G: Only at origin
H: Not continuous at (0,0)

Wait, the function isn't defined at (0,0), so it's not continuous there. So option A is wrong. 

Now, for the other options. Let's consider each:

B: Continuous along y=x. Well, along y=x, the function is 0 everywhere except at (0,0), which is undefined. So approaching along y=x, the limit is 0, but the function isn't defined at (0,0). However, continuity at a point requires the function to be defined at that point. So along y=x, since the function isn't defined at (0,0), the function isn't continuous along that line. So option B is incorrect.

C: Removable discontinuity at origin. But the function isn't defined at the origin. So it can't be a removable discontinuity because that requires the function to be defined at that point. So option C is incorrect.

D: Continuous along y=-x. Along y=-x, the function becomes (x² - (-x)^2)/(x² + (-x)^2) = (x² - x²)/(x² + x²) = 0/(2x²) = 0, except at (0,0) where it's undefined. So again, the function isn't defined at (0,0), so continuity along y=-x isn't possible. Option D is incorrect.

E: Continuous at all points. Well, the function isn't defined at (0,0), so it's not continuous there, so E is incorrect.

F: Continuous at all points except along y=x. Wait, but earlier I thought that's not correct. Because along y=x, the function isn't defined at (0,0), but along that line, it's undefined at that point. So the function is discontinuous along y=x because at (0,0), which is on that line, it's undefined. So the function isn't continuous along that line. So option F is incorrect.

G: The function is continuous only at the origin. But at (0,0), the function isn't defined, so it's not continuous there. So G is incorrect.

H: The function is not continuous at (0,0). That's correct. Because f is undefined there, and the limit doesn't exist. So the function isn't continuous at the origin.

So the correct answer is H: The function is not continuous at (0,0).
</think>

The function f(x, y) = [(x² - y²)/(x² + y²)] is not continuous at the origin because it is undefined there. Additionally, the function is discontinuous along the line y = x because it is not defined at (0,0), which lies on this line. 

ANSWER: H: The function is not continuous at (0,0).
