Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about converting ppm to mg %. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the maximum safe concentration of fluoride ion in drinking water, which is given as 2.0 ppm. I need to express this in milligram percent.

Wait, ppm stands for parts per million, right? So 1 ppm is 1 mg per liter of water, I think. But wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, I remember that ppm can be in different units. Oh right, ppm can be mg per liter, or mg per kilogram of water, or mg per 1000 liters, etc. But in this context, I think the question is using ppm as mg per liter.

So, 2.0 ppm is 2.0 mg per liter of water. But I need to express this as milligram percent. Oh wait, wait. Wait, mg % means milligram per 100 grams of solution. Because percentages are often expressed as per 100 grams. So mg % is (mg of solute) / (g of solution) * 100.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether the solution is water or another solvent. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it step by step.

So, the question is: 2.0 ppm is equal to how many mg%?

Wait, ppm is often defined as mg per liter of water. So 1 ppm is 1 mg/L. So 2 ppm is 2 mg/L.

But mg % is a different measure. I think mg % is calculated as (mg of solute) divided by (total mass of solution in grams) multiplied by 100. Let's say the solution is water, so the solution's mass is approximately the mass of the water. But wait, the density of water is about 1 g/mL. But when you add a solute, like fluoride, the solution's mass increases. So the solution's mass isn't exactly the same as the water's mass. But for most purposes, especially in water treatment, ppm and mg% are both used, but they are different.

Wait, maybe I've got it wrong. Let me try to recall the exact definitions.

I think that ppm can be in different units. For example, in water, 1 ppm is equivalent to 1 mg/L. So 2.0 ppm is 2 mg/L.

But mg % is a different measure. So mg % is (mg solute)/(g solution) * 100. So I need to find out the total mass of the solution.

Wait, but the solution's mass would be the mass of the water plus the mass of the solute. But if the solute is a small amount, like 2 mg in 1 liter of water (which is 1 kg, 1000 g), then the solution's mass is approximately 1002 g (since 1 liter of water is 1 kg, 1000g; but wait, actually, that's 1000 grams of water, and adding 2 mg of solute is 0.002 grams. So total mass is 1000.002 grams.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified. Maybe in this context, when they say ppm, it's mg per liter, and mg % is the same as ppm, but that can't be right because mg % is a different unit.

Wait, wait. Let me do the math correctly.

So, to find mg %, which is (mg solute) / (total solution mass in grams) * 100%.

Assuming that the solution's mass is approximately equal to the mass of the water, since the solute is much less. So, using density of water as 1 g/mL. So 1 liter is 1000 mL, 1000 g of water.

The solute is 2.0 mg, which is 0.002 grams. So total solution mass is 1000.002 grams. Wait, but maybe for this problem, they're simplifying it, and considering the solution's mass as 1000 grams. Because, for example, 1 liter of water is 1 kg, but the solution, when you add a small amount, is about 1.002 kg. But perhaps the problem ignores the small addition, treating the solution as 1000 grams.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think.

Wait, assuming that the solution's mass is 1000 grams (1 kg of water), and the solute is 2 mg.

So, mg % = (2 mg) / (1000 grams) * 100 = (2/1000) * 100 = 0.2% ?

Wait, but wait, that would be if the solution's mass is 1 kg. Let me check again.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Because 1 liter of water is 1000 mL, which is 1000 grams. So if the solution is 1000 grams, and 2 mg is the solute, then mg % is (2 mg) / (1000 g) *100 = 0.2% mg %. But wait, that would make the mg % as 0.2%.

But wait, the options are given. Looking at the options, option F is 0.20 mg %, and option C is 0.002 mg %, etc.

Wait a moment, I'm getting confused. Let me start over.

The correct formula for mg % is (mg solute) / (kg of solution) * 100.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. The mg % is (mg of solute) / (mass of solution in kg) * 100.

So, if the solution's mass is 1 kg (1000 grams), and 2 mg is the solute, then:

(2 mg) / (1 kg) * 100 = 200 mg%?

Wait, that can't be right because that would be a very high concentration, but I thought ppm is mg/L. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting the definitions wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct definitions.

Wait, according to my notes, ppm can be defined in terms of mg per liter (mg/L) or mg per kilogram of solution (mg/kg). But in water, since water's density is about 1 g/mL, 1 kg of water is 1 liter. So, 1 ppm (mg/L) is equivalent to 1 mg/kg.

Wait, but mg % is a different measure. So, perhaps mg% is expressed as (mg of solute) / (total mass of solution) *100.

But if the solution's total mass is (mass of solvent + mass of solute), which is approximately mass of solvent if the solute is small.

Wait, perhaps in the context of water, when you're dealing with ppm, it's often mg per liter, and mg% is the same as ppm? Or no.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: I know that 1 ppm is 1 mg per liter of water (which is 1 kg in terms of mass, but the volume is 1 liter). So 1 ppm is 1 mg/L.

But mg% is a percentage based on the mass of the solution. So, for the solution, which is made up of water plus the solute, the mass of the solution is about 1000 g (1 kg) plus 0.002 g (2 mg), so about 1000.002 g.

So, the percentage would be (2 mg) / (1000.002 g) *100.

Wait, 1000 grams is 1 kg, so 1000 grams plus 0.002 grams is 1000.002 grams.

So, 2 mg is 0.002 grams.

So, (0.002 grams) / (1000.002 grams) *100 = (0.002 / 1000.002) *100 ≈ 0.002% approximately.

Wait, but wait, 0.002 is 0.002 mg %?

Wait, because mg % is (mg solute) / (mass of solution in grams) *100.

So 0.002 grams in mg is 2 mg. So, 2 mg / 1000 grams = 0.002%, which is 0.002% mg %.

So, that would be 0.002% as a percentage. But wait, no, mg % is a percentage, so 0.002% would be 0.002% of 100%, so 0.002%.

So, the correct mg % is approximately 0.002% because the solution's mass is about 1000 grams (since 2 mg is negligible compared to 1000 grams).

Wait, but 0.002% is equivalent to 0.002 mg % because mg % is same as percentage. Wait, no, mg% is mg per 100 grams. So, 0.002% would mean (0.002 * 100) mg per 100 grams. Wait, no, because mg% is (mg)/(g) *100.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to calculate it numerically.

So, the solution's mass is 1000 grams (water) + 2 mg (solute) = 1000.002 grams.

So, 2 mg is 0.002 grams.

So, mg% is (0.002 grams) / (1000.002 grams) * 100.

0.002 / 1000.002 is approximately 0.000002.

Multiply by 100 gives 0.0002%.

Wait, that's 0.0002%? That's 0.0002%, which is 0.0002 mg %? Or is it 0.0002% which would be 0.0002 mg per 100 grams.

Wait, no, the mg % is (mg solute) / (g of solution) * 100.

So, 0.002 / 1000.002 = 0.000002, times 100 is 0.0002%.

Wait, so 0.0002% is 0.0002 mg %? No, wait, mg % is a percentage, so if I have 0.0002% of the solution, that's 0.0002 mg per 100 grams.

Ah, wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

The concentration is 2.0 ppm of fluoride. ppm is mg/L. So, 2.0 mg/L.

But mg% is (mg)/ (g of solution) *100.

So, mg% = (2 mg/L) / (g of solution) *100.

But the solution's mass depends on how much fluoride is added. If the solution is 1 liter (1 kg of water), adding 2 mg of fluoride is 2 mg.

But the solution's mass is approximately 1 kg (1000g) plus the added 2 mg (0.002g), so 1000.002g.

So, mg% = (2 mg) / (1000.002g) *100 = (2 / 1000.002) *100 ≈ 0.2% (since 2 / 1000 is 0.2%).

Wait, but that's a 0.2% mg %, which is option F: 0.20 mg %.

But wait, earlier when I calculated using 1000g, I got 0.002%, which is 0.002 mg %.

Hmm, so which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact definitions.

According to a quick recall, ppm is mg/L, and mg% is (mg in solution) / (total solution mass) *100. So, in this case, the solute is 2 mg, and the solution's mass is 1 kg (1000g) plus 2 mg (0.002g) = 1000.002 grams.

So, mg% = (2 mg) / (1000.002 g) *100 = (2 / 1000.002) *100 ≈ (0.002) * 100 = 0.2%.

Wait, so that's approximately 0.2%.

But looking at the options, option F is 0.20 mg %, which is 0.2% (since mg% is a percentage, so 0.2% is 0.2 mg %? No, wait, no. Wait, mg% is (mg)/(g) *100. So, for example, 10 mg in 100g of solution is 10/(100) *100=10%. So, this is 10 mg %, not 10%.

Wait, but no, mg % is (mg)/(g) *100. So, 10 mg in 100g is (10/100)*100 =10% (mg%).

So in our case, 2 mg in 1000g solution is (2/1000)*100 = 0.2% (mg%). So, the mg % is 0.2%.

But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, because 1000g is 1 kg, which is 1000 grams. So, 2 mg is 0.002 grams.

So, the calculation is 0.002 grams / 1000 grams * 100 = 0.002% (mg%).

Wait, because 0.002 grams is the solute, and the solution's mass is 1000 grams.

So, 0.002 / 1000 = 0.000002 → 0.000002 *100 = 0.0002%.

Wait, that's 0.0002%, which is 0.0002 mg %? Because mg% is (mg)/(g) *100.

So, 0.0002% is 0.0002 mg %.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify.

The formula is:

mg% = (mg solute) / (mass of solution in grams) * 100

So, in our case, 2 mg / 1000.002 g = approximately 0.002% (mg%). Because 2 / 1000 is 0.002, and then multiplied by 100 gives 0.2%.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused again. Let me compute:

2 mg is 0.002 grams.

So, 0.002 g / 1000.002 g = approx 0.000002.

Multiply by 100% gives 0.0002%.

So, 0.0002% is 0.0002 mg %?

Wait, no, mg% is (mg)/(g) *100.

So, 0.002 grams is 2 mg.

Wait, no, 0.002 grams is 2 mg. Wait, 1 gram is 1000 mg, so 0.002 grams is 2 mg.

So, the mg% is (2 mg) / (1000.002 grams) *100.

Which is (2 / 1000.002) *100 ≈ 0.2%.

So, 0.2% is the mg %.

But this is 0.2% of a 1000g solution. Since the question is asking for the concentration in mg %, which is a percentage, 0.2% is the same as 0.2 mg %, because mg % is a percentage. So, 0.2% is 0.2 mg %.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, mg % is (mg in solution) / (mass of solution in grams) *100.

So, if the solution is 1000g, 2 mg is 0.002 grams. So,

0.002 / 1000 = 0.000002 → 0.000002 *100 = 0.0002%.

Which is 0.0002%, which is 0.0002 mg %.

Wait, no, mg% is (mg)/(g) *100. So, 0.002 grams is 2 mg. So, 2 mg divided by 1000 grams is 0.002%, which is 0.002 mg %.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to use ppm as mg/L and convert to mg %.

So, ppm is mg/L.

In this case, 2.0 ppm is 2.0 mg/L.

Now, mg% is (mg)/(g of solution) *100.

The solution's mass is approximately the mass of the water plus the mass of the solute.

But for a solution where the solute is a small fraction, the solution's mass is approximately equal to the mass of the solvent. So, if the solution is water (1000g), then the solution's mass is 1000g.

So, mg% = (2 mg) / (1000g) *100 = 0.2%.

So, 0.2% is the mg %.

But wait, wait, that can't be right because 0.2% is 0.002 mg %.

Wait, but mg% is a percentage, so 0.2% is 0.2 mg per 100 grams.

Wait, no, this is getting me stuck. Let's try to find another approach.

I think the correct way is to calculate mg % as (mg) / (total mass in grams) *100.

So, total mass is approximately the mass of the water plus the added fluoride.

But if the solution is 1 L, which is 1 kg, then adding 2 mg is 2 mg.

So, total mass is 1000g + 2mg = 1000.002g.

So, mg% is (2 mg) / (1000.002 g) *100 = (2 / 1000.002) *100 ≈ 0.2%.

So, mg% is approximately 0.2%.

Which is option F: 0.20 mg %. So, the answer would be F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 2 ppm is 0.2 mg %, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that mg% is the same as mg/L, but expressed as a percentage.

So, if ppm is mg/L, then mg% is (mg/L) * (100 / 1000) ) ?

Wait, that's not making sense. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps mg% is the same as ppm, but in a different unit. So, 2 ppm is the same as 2 mg %.

But that can't be right because ppm is mg/L, and mg % is (mg) / (g solution) *100.

Wait, perhaps I should find an example.

Suppose we have 10 mg of fluoride in 100g of solution.

So, (10 mg) / (100 g) = 0.1 mg %.

Alternatively, if the solution is 100g, and 10 mg, then mg% is 10 mg / 100 g *100 = 10 mg %.

Wait, that's not possible because mg % is a percentage.

Wait, perhaps mg% is (mg) / (g solution) *100, so 10 mg in 100g solution is 10 mg %, which would be a very high concentration.

But in our problem, the solution's mass is 1002g (1000g water +2 mg solute), so mg% is (2 mg) / (1002g) *100 ≈ 0.2% (mg %).

But that's a 0.2% concentration. Wait, but mg% is a percentage, so 0.2% is 0.2 mg %.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the correct formula.

The correct formula for mg% is (mg) / (g solution) *100.

So, using that, let's compute.

The solution's mass is 1000g (water) + 2mg (solute) = 1000.002g.

So, mg% = (2 mg) / (1000.002 g) * 100.

Which is (2 / 1000.002) *100 = (0.002) *100 = 0.2%.

So, mg% is 0.2%.

But looking at the options, option F is 0.20 mg %, and option C is 0.002 mg %.

Wait, because mg% is 0.2%, which is 0.002 mg %.

Wait, because 0.2% is 0.002 mg %.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, mg% is a percentage, so 0.2% is 0.2 mg %.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because mg % is a percentage, so 0.2% is equal to 0.2 mg %.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 1% is 100%, so 0.2% is 0.2 mg %.

Wait, that would mean that the mg% is 0.2, which is option F:0.20 mg%.

But earlier calculation using 1000 grams gave mg% as 0.2%. So, that's 0.2%.

Wait, but then according to the correct formula, mg% is (mg) / (g solution) * 100.

So, in this case, mg% is 0.2%.

Which is option F.

But wait, looking back at the initial problem, the maximum safe concentration is 2 mg/L, which is 2 mg per 1000g, which is 0.2% in terms of mg %.

So, the correct answer is option F: 0.20 mg %.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 2 ppm is 0.2 mg %, but that's a different unit.

Wait, now I'm more confused.

Perhaps I should refer to a reliable source.

Upon checking, the correct formula for mg% is (mg) / (g solution) *100. So, in this case, 2 mg in 1000 grams of solution is (2 /1000)*100=0.2%.

So, the correct answer is option F:0.20 mg %.

So, the answer is F.
</think>

To determine the maximum safe fluoride concentration in drinking water, we start with the given fluoride concentration of 2.0 ppm. 

### Step 1: Understanding ppm
- **ppm** is a measure of concentration where 1 ppm equals 1 mg per liter (mg/L). 
- For example, 2.0 ppm of fluoride means 2.0 mg of fluoride per liter of water.

### Step 2: Convert ppm to mg/L
- 2.0 ppm of fluoride corresponds to 2.0 mg/L of fluoride in water.

### Step 3: Calculate mg% (parts per million by mass)
- **mg%** is a measure where the concentration is expressed as a percentage of the mass of the solution. 
- The formula for mg% is: 
  \[
  \text{mg\%} = \left( \frac{\text{mg}}{\text{g of solution}} \right) \times 100
  \]
- In this case, the solution's mass is approximately the mass of the water (1000 g) plus the added fluoride (2 mg), totaling 1002 g.
- Applying the formula:
  \[
  \text{mg\%} = \left( \frac{2 \, \text{mg}}{1002 \, \text{g}} \right) \times 100 \approx 0.2\%
  \]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
- The calculated mg% is approximately 0.2%.
- Since mg% is a percentage, 0.2% is equivalent to 0.2 mg %.

### Step 5: Match with options
- Option F: **0.20 mg %** matches our calculation.

ANSWER: F
