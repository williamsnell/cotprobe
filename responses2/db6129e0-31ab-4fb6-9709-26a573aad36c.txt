Okay, so I've got this question about the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I'll try to work it out. Let's see, the options are A to I, and the answer is supposed to be one of them. 

First, I remember that general jurisprudence is the broader, more fundamental principles, while particular jurisprudence deals with specific cases. The question is asking about the person who recognized this distinction. 

I think the person is called Dworkin. Wait, Dworkin is known for his work on the law of general and particular principles. He's probably a key figure in the legal theory of general principles. I'm pretty sure he was involved with the concept that particular jurisprudence is a specific application of general principles. So, the answer should be D, which is Dworkin.

The answer is D, Dworkin. He recognized the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence, establishing the idea that particular jurisprudence is derived from general principles.
