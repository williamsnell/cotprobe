Okay, so I have this problem here where u is equal to arctan(y/x), and I need to find the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to x and y. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on partial derivatives, but I think I can work through this step by step.

First, let's write down the function clearly. u = arctan(y/x). I remember that the derivative of arctan is 1/(1 + t²), where t is the argument. So maybe I can find the first partial derivatives and then take the second ones.

Wait, let me think about taking the first partial derivatives. For ∂u/∂x, I need to differentiate arctan(y/x) with respect to x. So the derivative of arctan(z) is 1/(1 + z²) times the derivative of z with respect to x. Here, z is y/x, so dz/dx is -y/(x²). So putting that together, ∂u/∂x should be (1)/(1 + (y²/x²)) * (-y/x²). Simplifying that, 1 + y²/x² is (x² + y²)/x², so the denominator becomes (x² + y²)/x². The reciprocal of that is x²/(x² + y²). So ∂u/∂x is (-y/x²) * (x²/(x² + y²)) ) → Wait, I think I might have messed up the signs here. Wait, let me re-calculate. The derivative of arctan(z) is 1/(1 + z²) * dz/dx. So dz/dx is derivative of y/x with respect to x, which is -y/x². So ∂u/∂x = [1/(1 + (y²/x²))] * (-y/x²) 

Simplify 1 + y²/x² as (x² + y²)/x². So the reciprocal is x²/(x² + y²). Multiply by (-y/x²): (-y/x²) * (x²/(x² + y²)) → The x² cancels, leaving -y/(x² + y²). So ∂u/∂x = -y/(x² + y²). Got that.

Now, the second partial derivative with respect to x, which is ∂²u/∂x². So I need to differentiate ∂u/∂x with respect to x again. So (-y) is treated as a constant in this context, right? So d/dx of (-y/(x² + y²)) is (-y) * d/dx (1/(x² + y²)). 

The derivative of 1/(x² + y²) with respect to x is -2x/(x² + y²)^2. Because derivative of (x² + y²) is 2x, so 1/(x² + y²) derivative is -2x/(x² + y²)^2. So putting it together, the derivative is (-y) * (-2x)/(x² + y²)^2 ) → The negatives multiply to give positive 2xy. So ∂²u/∂x² = 2xy/(x² + y²)^2.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. The derivative of 1/(x² + y²) with respect to x is -2x/(x² + y²)^2 because it's the derivative of (x² + y²)^-1. So yes, correct. So the second partial derivative is 2xy/(x² + y²)^2.

Now, let's compute the first partial derivative with respect to y, ∂u/∂y. Using the same approach as before. The derivative of arctan(z) where z = y/x is 1/(1 + z²) * dz/dy. dz/dy is 1/x. So ∂u/∂y = [1/(1 + (y²/x²))] * (1/x).

Again, 1 + y²/x² is (x² + y²)/x². The reciprocal is x²/(x² + y²). So ∂u/∂y = (x²/(x² + y²)) * (1/x) → Simplifies to x/(x² + y²).

Now, the second partial derivative with respect to y, ∂²u/∂y². So take the derivative of x/(x² + y²). The derivative of 1/(x² + y²) with respect to y is -2y/(x² + y²)^2. So the derivative of x times that is x * (-2y)/(x² + y²)^2 → So ∂²u/∂y² = -2xy/(x² + y²)^2.

Now, the problem is to sum these two second derivatives: ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y². So let's plug them in:

∂²u/∂x² = 2xy/(x² + y²)^2

∂²u/∂y² = -2xy/(x² + y²)^2

Adding them together: 2xy/(x² + y²)^2 - 2xy/(x² + y²)^2 = 0.

Wait, that's zero. Huh, so the sum is zero. So the answer should be D, which is 0.0.

The function is \( u = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \). We calculate the second partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and sum them.

1. **First partial derivatives:**
   - \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = -\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} \)
   - \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} \)

2. **Second partial derivatives:**
   - \( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} \)
   - \( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = -\frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} \)

3. **Summing the second partial derivatives:**
   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} - \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = 0
   \]

Thus, the sum of the second partial derivatives is zero.
