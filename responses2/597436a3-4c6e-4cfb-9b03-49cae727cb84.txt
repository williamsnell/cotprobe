Question:

A major polling organization wants to predict the outcome of an upcoming national election (in terms of the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate).

Options:

A: 2048
B: 1000
C: 39

Okay, so I've got this question here about determining the minimum sample size needed for a poll. Let me try to break it down. The question says a major polling organization wants to predict the outcome of an upcoming national election. They're using a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5%. I need to find the minimum sample size from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that the formula for calculating the required sample size when estimating a population proportion involves the margin of error, confidence level, and an estimate of the population proportion. But wait, I think the formula is n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2, right? Where Z is the Z-score, p is the estimated proportion, and E is the margin of error.

Since we don't have an estimate for p, I think the most conservative approach is to use p = 0.5, because that maximizes the variance (p*(1-p)). Oh, wait, because when p is 0.5, 0.5*(1-0.5) is 0.25, which is the highest possible value for p*(1-p). So that way, the sample size calculation will be the largest possible, ensuring that even in the worst case, the margin of error is met.

So plugging in the numbers: Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. I think for 95% confidence, the Z-score is 1.96, since it's common and that's what I remember from standard tables.

E is 2.5%, which is 0.025 in decimal. So E squared is (0.025)^2 = 0.000625.

Now, plug these into the formula:

n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / 0.000625.

Calculating the numerator first: 1.96 squared is approximately 3.8416. Multiply that by 0.25 (since 0.5*0.5=0.25), so 3.8416 * 0.25 = 0.9604.

Now, divide that by 0.000625. Let's see: 0.9604 / 0.000625. Hmm, 0.000625 is 1/1600, so dividing by that is the same as multiplying by 1600. So 0.9604 * 1600 = let's calculate that. 0.96 * 1600 is 1536, and 0.0004 *1600 is 0.64, so total is 1536.64.

So n is approximately 1536.64, which we can round up to 1537 because sample sizes are whole numbers and you can't have a fraction of a person.

Looking at the options, I see option H is 1537. So that's the answer I think.

The formula for the required sample size is derived from the confidence interval and margin of error. Using a 95% confidence level (Z = 1.96), a margin of error of 2.5% (E = 0.025), and p = 0.5 for maximum variance, the calculation is:

n = (1.96² * 0.5 * 0.5) / (0.025)²  
n ≈ 1536.64  

Rounding up, the minimum sample size is 1537.

**Answer: H: 1537**
