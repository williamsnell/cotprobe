Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it. The question is about kinetic energy and momentum after an increase in speed doubles the kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and momentum is mv. 

So, the problem says if the speed increases and the kinetic energy doubles, what happens to the momentum? Let me break it down. Let's denote the initial speed as v and the initial momentum as p_initial = mv. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². 

When the speed increases, let's say the new speed is v'. The kinetic energy becomes double, so (1/2) m (v')² = 2*(1/2 m v²) → simplifies to (1/2)m v'² = m v² → v'² = 2 v² → v' = v√2. 

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check that. The initial KE is (1/2)m v². After the speed doubles the KE (but no, the question says increases speed and doubles KE). So, the final KE is 2 * initial KE. So,  (1/2) m (v')² = 2*(1/2 m v²) → simplifying, m v'² = 2 m v² → v'² = 2 v² → v' = v * sqrt(2). 

So the new speed is v multiplied by the square root of 2. Now, the momentum after this change is p_final = m v' = m (v√2) = m v * √2. 

But the initial momentum was p_initial = m v. So p_final is √2 times p_initial. Wait, √2 is approximately 1.414, so that's about 1.414 times the original momentum. So the momentum doesn't remain the same; it increases. But how much? The options are about what it does. 

The options are about whether the momentum increases, decreases, etc. Let's look at the options. 

Option E says doubles. But our calculation shows that the momentum becomes √2 times the original. So it's not exactly double. So E is not correct. What about option J: increases but less than doubles. Since √2 is less than 2, it's about 1.414 times. So the momentum increases, but not by a factor of 2. So option J says 'increases but less than doubles'. That fits. 

Wait, what about the other options? Let me check. 

Option A: quadruples. No, because √2 is about 1.4, not 4. So no. 

Option B: halved. No, because p_final is larger than p_initial. 

Option C: depends on mass. No, because m is constant. 

Option D: triples. No, it's about 1.4 times. 

Option F: decreases. No, momentum increases. 

Option G: depends on factors not stated. No, because m and the speed are directly related. 

Option H: remains the same. No, because KE increased, so momentum must have increased. 

Option I: more than doubles. No, because 1.4 is less than 2. 

Option J: increases but less than doubles. Yes, that's correct. 

So the correct answer should be J.

The problem involves determining how the momentum of a moving object changes when its kinetic energy doubles due to an increase in speed. The kinetic energy is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), and the momentum is \( p = mv \).

1. **Initial Setup**: Let the initial speed be \( v \), initial momentum \( p_{\text{initial}} = mv \), and initial kinetic energy \( KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).

2. **After Speed Increase**: After the speed increases, the kinetic energy doubles, so:
   \[
   KE_{\text{final}} = 2 \cdot KE_{\text{initial}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mv^2
   \]
   The final speed \( v' \) can be found using:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}mv'^2 = mv^2 \implies v'^2 = 2v^2 \implies v' = v\sqrt{2}
   \]

3. **Final Momentum**: The final momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = mv' = m \cdot v\sqrt{2} = mv\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Comparing \( p_{\text{final}} \) to \( p_{\text{initial}} \):
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot p_{\text{initial}} \approx 1.414 \cdot p_{\text{initial}}
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option J**: "increases but less than doubles." Since \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), which is less than 2, this is correct.
   - **Other Options**: None of the other options (A to I) accurately describe the relationship between momentum and the given conditions.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: increases but less than doubles**.
