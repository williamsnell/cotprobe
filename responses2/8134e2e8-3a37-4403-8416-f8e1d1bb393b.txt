Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that the image of a distant scene, limited by the light passing through a window, can be focused sharply on a white card held 40 cm from a lens. I need to find the power of the lens from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when a lens is used to focus an image, it's typically a converging lens. But wait, the scene is limited by light passing through a window. Oh right, so the scene must be a scene that is blocked by the window, meaning the light source is behind the window. So the image is formed by a converging lens because the light passes through the window (which is a convex lens) and then converges onto the card. That makes sense.

Now, the white card is the image. The card is 40 cm from the lens. Since the scene was distant, the object is far away, so the object distance (u) is effectively at infinity. But wait, in lens problems, the formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. If u is infinity, 1/u is zero. So 1/f = 1/v. So the focal length f is equal to v? Or wait, another approach: the image is formed by the window (convex lens) and the card (the image). So the image distance is the distance from the lens to the card, which is 40 cm. So v is 40 cm.

Wait, but wait, the object distance is the distance from the lens to where the light from the scene comes from. Since the scene is distant, the object is at a very large distance. So u is considered infinity. So using the thin lens formula: 1/f = 1/v - 1/u. But if u is infinity, 1/u is zero. So 1/f = 1/v. So f = v. So the focal length is 0.4 meters (since v is 40 cm, which is 0.4 m). 

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The thin lens equation is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u. Since u is very large, 1/u is negligible. So 1/f ≈ 1/v → f = v. The image distance v is 40 cm, so f is 40 cm, which is 0.4 meters. Power P is 1/f in meters, so P = 1 / 0.4 = 2.5 diopters. Looking at the options, option A is 2.5 diopters.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check. The lens is the window itself, right? So the scene is behind the window. So the window is a convex lens, and that's the lens we're considering. So the image is formed by the lens. So we're using the lens to form an image of the scene. So the object is the scene, which is at a great distance, so u is infinity. So the image is formed at v = 40 cm, so the focal length is 40 cm.

Wait, but wait. How about if the object is at a finite distance? No, the scene is distant, so u is infinity. So f is 40 cm. So the power is 1/(0.4) = 2.5 diopters. So the answer is A.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the image and object. The object is the scene, which is at a very large distance. The image is formed on the white card, which is at v = 40 cm. So yes, f = v = 0.4 m. So the power is 2.5 D, which is option A.

To determine the power of the lens, we analyze the setup. The scene is distant, meaning the object distance \( u \) is effectively infinite. The image is formed on a white card held 40 cm from the lens, so the image distance \( v \) is 40 cm. Using the thin lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}
\]

Since \( u \) is very large, \( \frac{1}{u} \) is negligible, simplifying the equation to:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v}
\]

Thus, the focal length \( f \) is equal to the image distance \( v \), which is 40 cm or 0.4 m. The power \( P \) of the lens is given by:

\[
P = \frac{1}{f} \quad \text{(in meters)}
\]

Substituting \( f = 0.4 \, \text{m} \):

\[
P = \frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5 \, \text{diopters}
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:
