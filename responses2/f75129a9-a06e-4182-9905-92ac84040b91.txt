Question:

The weight of an object on the moon, m, is about q of the object’s weight on Earth, e. Which equation represents the approximate weight of an object on the moon in terms of the object's weight on Earth?

Options:

A: m = e - 1/6
B: m = 6+e
C: m = 1/6e
D: m = 6e
E: m = 1/6 + e
F: m = e + 6
G: m = e - 6
H: m = e/6
I: m = 6 - e

Okay, so I've got this physics question here about the weight of an object on the moon compared to its weight on Earth. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that the weight on the moon, m, is about q of the object’s weight on Earth, e. Wait, but the options given are in terms of e and m, so I think q might be a distractor or maybe part of the equation. The question seems to ask for the equation that represents m in terms of e.

Hmm, I remember that gravity on the moon is much weaker than on Earth. Earth's gravity is stronger, so objects would weigh less on the moon. The moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's. So if an object's weight on Earth is e, then on the moon it should be e multiplied by 1/6. 

Let me think: weight is mass times gravity, right? So if the object's mass doesn't change, and the moon's gravity is 1/6th of Earth's, then m = e * (1/6) = e/6. That would make sense. Looking at the options, option H is m = e/6, which seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. If I have an object that weighs 120 pounds on Earth, then on the moon it should weigh 20 pounds. 120 divided by 6 is 20. So yes, m = e/6. 

Looking at the options, that's option H. The other options don't fit this calculation. For example, option B is m =6 +e, which would mean more weight on the moon. Option C is m= (1/6)e, which is exactly what we have. But wait, the question asks for the weight on the moon in terms of Earth's weight. So that's correct. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Let me think about the formula again. Weight on Earth is W_e = m * g_e, where g_e is Earth's gravity. Weight on moon is W_m = m * g_m, where g_m is moon's gravity, which is 1/6th of g_e. So W_m = m * (g_e/6) = (m g_e)/6 = W_e /6. So W_m = (1/6) W_e, which is the same as m = e/6. So yes, H is correct.

The weight of an object on the moon is approximately 1/6 of its weight on Earth. Using the formula for weight (W = m * g), where g is gravity, the moon's gravity is 1/6th of Earth's. Thus, the weight on the moon, \( m \), is \( m = \frac{e}{6} \). 

Answer: H
