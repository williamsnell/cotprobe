Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ￡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The question is about a letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879. The author describes his homestead being destroyed, the crops and premises being destroyed, and then he's suing the Government for damages. The options are about what the government did with this incident.

Hmm. So the key here is to understand the context. The letter was written during the Anglo-Zulu War, which was a conflict between British rule and Zulu rule in South Africa. The war ended in 1884, but the author wrote the letter in 1879.

The author mentions a homestead in the city that was insured for £2,000. Insurance companies wouldn't make money from destroyed property, so the homestead was probably destroyed. The homestead was 50 acres close to the town, but that's probably irrelevant because the problem is about the damage caused by the Zulu resistance.

The main point is the damage caused by a contingent of 1,500 natives who encamped near the place. The author is suing the Government for damages. 

Now, I remember that in the Anglo-Zulu War, when a British citizen defends their homestead, the government might have taken measures against the Zulu independence movement. The government's role during this period was to maintain British control and protect the British citizens.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu. Casus belli is a term used by the British government to signify that the British have lost their war rights, typically by making clear that they are not willing to fight again. So, this would be relevant. But wait, the author is suing the government for damage, not perhaps taking a step to go to war. But during the war, the government might have taken action, so this could be a possibility.

Option B: Form an alliance with the Zulu Kingdom against other African tribes. That would be more about the government collaborating with Zulu, which seems less likely because the Contenders (the Zulu people) were against British rule.

Option C: Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages. That's more about the government imposing taxes to compensate for damage. Could this happen? Maybe, but I don't think that's the main point of the question. The main issue seems to be the government's response to the Zulu's resistance.

Option D: Force British citizens to leave South Africa. That seems unlikely because the author is defending his home, not evicting people. He's suing for damages, not forcing them.

Option E: Negotiate a peace treaty with the Zulu Kingdom. Again, this seems more about a peaceful end to the conflict, which doesn't directly address the government's response to the Contenders' actions.

Option F: Negotiate a peace treaty with the Kingdom of Zulu. This is similar to E, but perhaps more about making a formal agreement rather than the government's direct action.

Option G: Increase military presence in South Africa. That's about military expansion, which doesn't directly relate to the government's response to the Contenders.

Option H: Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism. This seems like a broader statement about the government's intent. But the question is about the government's actions in this specific situation.

Option I: Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa. I'm not sure about this. This sounds like the government was taking responsibility for the loss of citizens, perhaps by the Contenders, but I don't think the government did that. The Contenders were just a resistance group; the government's role was more to maintain control.

Option J: Establish more colonies in South Africa. That's about expanding the country's borders, which is probably unrelated.

So, considering the options, the most likely scenario is that the British government, during the war, recognized the Contenders' resistance and took measures against them. One such measure would be to issue a casus belli (a sign that British war rights have ended), which would allow the government to take action against the Zulu people. Alternatively, the government might have taken action like paying taxes or creating a defense to protect the British citizens.

However, looking back, the question says the author is suing the government for damages done by the Contenders. So the government's actions would have been to take measures against their actions, perhaps through legal action or tax payments.

Wait, but the question is about what the government did with the incident. So if the author is suing, then the government's response would include taking measures to compensate for the damage caused by the Contenders.

I think the most accurate option here is Option A: issue a casus belli. Because during the war, the British government would have taken steps to recognize the Contenders and take action against them. So the government's action was to issue such a sign, which allowed the government to take measures against the Zulu people, leading to the damage described.

So the correct answer would be A.
</think>

The British government during the Anglo-Zulu War, 1879, likely issued a casus belli to recognize the Contenders' resistance, allowing them to take legal and financial measures against the British. This action was part of the government's response to the Contenders' actions, leading to the damage described in the letter. 

**Answer: A**
