Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.
"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity."

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about political movements and I need to match a given statement from the Populist Party with one of the listed options. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly. The Populist Party's platform mentions several key points: they're fighting for power and plunder, causing hardship to people, claiming that the controlling influences are letting things happen without much effort to control them. They also suggest ignoring certain issues except one, which is about ignoring all except the tariff battle. They want to lose hope for their causes by sacrificing homes, lives, and children, and destroy a lot of people to get corruption funds from powerful individuals. They also want the government of the Republic back to the people.

So, the main goals of the Populist Party are:
1. Reverting to a government based on the people.
2. Fomenting an independence movement.
3. Removing the control of power from the existing political parties.
4. Promoting social and economic reforms, including justice, national tranquility, and the general welfare.
5. Securing benefits for the people, like liberty, through the government.

Now, I need to look at each option and see which one aligns most closely with these goals.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: The Tea Party movement of the early 2000s. Tea Party is a more recent movement, focusing on reducing taxes, supporting workers, and supporting the wealthy. It's about breaking the free market and promoting certain economic policies. Not sure if it's related to the Populist goals.

B: Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s. This was the American民国 era, led by Andrew Jackson. It was a period of significant reform under the Articles of Confederation and more towards the end of the 18th century. It's more about the rise of states' rights and the end of the British Empire's influence. Doesn't seem directly related to the Populist's goals of independence and government of the people.

C: Neoconservatism of the 1980s. Neoconservativism is a movement that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It's related to the collapse of theConservatism movement and the rise of the socialist and environmental movements. While it does promote certain policies, like environmental protection and social justice, I'm not sure if it's the same as the Populist's focus on independence and repositioning government.

D: Progressivism of the early 1900s. Progressivism is a term that refers to the movement of people against industrialization, particularly working-class progressivism. It includes things like theologists who oppose industrialization and the shift towards workers' rights. Progressivism tends to focus more on social and economic reforms, like labor rights and workers' rights. It's somewhat similar to the Populist's goal of better welfare and social justice. However, it's about the shift from industrialization rather than repositioning the government.

E: Federalism of the late 1700s. Federalism is where a country is divided into two or more governments, each responsible for their own region. It's more about a system of division rather than a movement for government. Not directly related to the Populist's focus on repositioning power.

F: The New Deal policies of the 1930s. The New Deal was a series of policies aimed at recovering from the Great Depression, focusing on economic recovery, industrialization, and social services. While it did address some economic issues, like the stock market crash and the usurer policies, it's more about how to recover from the effects of the Depression rather than the goals of independence or government repositioning.

G: The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Civil Rights was a movement to address the issues of racial segregation and discrimination. It focused on fighting for equal rights, voting rights, and ended racial segregation through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While it was a major movement, it's more about equality and not directly related to the Populist's goals of government independence and government of the people.

H: Isolationism of the early 1900s. Isolationism was a movement advocating for the separation of nations, often driven by fear of foreign intervention. It was a reaction to the expansionist policies of the 19th century and the U.S. becoming a global power. Isolationism was more about national sovereignty and the idea that other nations shouldn't interfere. It doesn't align with the Populant's focus on government independence.

I: Socialism of the late 1800s. Socialism refers to a system of government and economic policies based on class struggle, as opposed to capitalism. Socialist movements often focus on class struggle, economic reforms, and working-class empowerment. While socialism can be seen as a form of government of the people, it's a very different approach from the Populist's goals, which emphasize independence and government repositioning.

J: The Counterculture movement of the 1960s. The Counterculture was a group of intellectuals and artists advocating for social justice, anti-feudalism, and anti-war policies. It emphasized individualism and freedom. While it was a significant anti-colonial movement, it's more about individual and social freedoms rather than government independence or progressive social reforms.

Wait, so looking back, the Populist's main goals were about government independence, repositioning power to the people, and promoting social reforms. Let's see which options match that.

Option D: Progressivism of the early 1900s. Progressivism does focus on social and economic reforms, including social justice, labor rights, and welfare. The early 1900s saw the rise of workers' rights and the shift toward more social policies. Progressivism didn't necessarily focus on government repositioning but more on the social aspects of that shift. So, perhaps D is closer.

Alternatively, option G is the Civil Rights movement, which is about equality but not about government independence.

Wait, maybe I should think about the key points of each option.

The Populist wanted to revert to the people as the government, which was about government of the people. The earliest movements that did that were the early 19th-century movements, especially the Union of the People movement, which was a significant event in American history. But looking at the options, the closest is D: Progressivism of the early 1900s.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Neoconservatism of the 1980s. Neoconservativism did promote social and environmental policies, but it's a broader movement, and it aligns more with the goals of improving welfare and social welfare than the goals of independence.

Wait, the Populist's main goal was to return the government to the people, so that would align more with the idea of a government of the people. Looking at the options, the earliest movements that were about that were the early 19th-century. But the options given don't include all of them.

Looking again at the options:

A: Tea Party (1900s)
B: Jacksonian (1800s)
C: Neoconservativism (1980s)
D: Progressivism (early 1900s)
E: Federalism (1700s)
F: New Deal (1930s)
G: Civil Rights (60s)
H: Isolationism (early 1900s)
I: Socialism (late 1800s)
J: Counterculture (60s)

So, the closest to the Populist's goals of government of the people, social reforms, etc., would be Progressivism (D). Because Progressivism was a shift towards equality, social welfare, and individual rights, which is similar to the Populist's desire to reposition government to the people.

Alternatively, maybe Neoconservativism (C) is more about welfare policies and social issues but not exactly the same as the goals of the Populist. The Populist wanted to lose power and control, so perhaps something that involved repositioning power and removing the control of the political parties, which would align more with options that involve a shift from the political parties to the people.

Looking at the options again, the earliest movements that were about government of the people were progressive movements, but the options don't have a specific one. So, perhaps the answer is D: Progressivism of the early 1900s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is probably D: Progressivism of the early 1900s because that's the movement that focused on the people's rights, social reforms, and government of the people. The Populist wanted to revert to that, so that's pretty much the same as their goals.

Another angle: The Populist's platform emphasized the need to remove the control of the political parties and shift power to the people. So the movement that did more along this line is Progressivism, which aimed to equalize rights and improve welfare for the people. So option D would be the correct answer.
</think>

The Populist Party's platform emphasized the need to revert to a government based on the people, promote social reforms, and remove the control of power from political parties. Among the options provided, the movement most closely aligned with these goals is **Progressivism of the early 1900s**. This movement focused on social justice, individual rights, and welfare, aligning with the Populant's desire to lose political control and regain the government of the people.

Answer: D
