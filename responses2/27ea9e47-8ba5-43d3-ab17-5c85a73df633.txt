Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a sphere rolling down a hill without slipping. I need to find out which force provides the torque causing rotation. Hmm.

Alright, let me break it down. The sphere starts from rest on a hill, and it rolls down without slipping. So, what's happening here? Rolling without slipping implies that there's both translational and rotational motion. The forces acting on the sphere must be considered.

I remember that when a sphere rolls down, the forces acting on it are gravity, normal force, and friction. Let's think about each force. Gravity is pulling the sphere down the slope. The normal force is perpendicular to the hill's surface. Friction must be acting up the slope to prevent slipping, right?

But wait, the question is about the torque causing rotation. Torque is related to the force and the lever arm. Since the sphere is rolling down, the torque comes from the friction force. Because without friction, the sphere couldn't rotate. Friction provides the torque by creating a force that causes rotation.

So, the forces are: gravity (mg) acting vertically, normal force (N) perpendicular, and friction (f) up the slope. The net force down the slope is mg sin(theta) minus friction. But which force is causing the rotation?

I think it's the friction because it's the only non-normal force that can cause torque. Without friction, the sphere would translate down the slope without spinning, right? So friction provides the torque necessary for rotation.

Let me check the options. The options are A to J. Let's see:

A: Magnetic force – probably not relevant here, since the question doesn't mention anything like that.

B: Static friction – yes, static friction is involved when there's no slipping.

C: Tension force – probably not, as tension is usually when you're stretching a string, not rolling a sphere.

D: The inertia of the sphere – inertia is mass, not a force. It's the resistance to acceleration.

E: The normal force – that's perpendicular, so no torque.

F: Gravity – that's the force acting vertically. But the torque would be due to friction, not gravity.

G: Centrifugal force – that's a pseudo-force in rotating frames, not relevant here.

H: The net force – the net force is a vector sum, but that's not a force itself for rotation.

I: Kinetic friction – kinetic friction is the current friction, not the maximum possible. I think the question is about the force that causes rotation, which is static friction.

J: Air friction – that's a different force, but in the case of rolling, it's more about rolling resistance, but not directly the torque.

So the correct answer should be B: Static friction.

The sphere rolls down the hill without slipping, and the question asks which force provides the torque causing rotation. Torque arises from a force applied at a distance from the axis of rotation. For rolling without slipping, the only force that creates torque is static friction. Static friction provides the necessary force to prevent slipping and also causes the torque that aligns with the rotational motion. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Magnetic force** – Not relevant.
- **B: Static friction** – Correct, as it provides the torque.
- **C: Tension force** – Not relevant.
- **D: Inertia of the sphere** – Not a force.
- **E: Normal force** – Perpendicular, no torque.
- **F: Gravity** – Acts vertically, not torque.
- **G: Centrifugal force** – Pseudo-force.
- **H: Net force** – Sum of forces, not a force itself.
- **I: Kinetic friction** – Current friction, not the force causing torque.
- **J: Air friction** – Different force.

The correct answer is **B: Static friction**.
