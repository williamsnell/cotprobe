Okay, so I've got this question about prime numbers and their digits summing to 19. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on primes and their properties, but let's think this through.

The question asks for the smallest prime whose digits add up to 19. The options given are A through J, each with a number. I need to find which one is the smallest prime that meets this condition.

First, I should understand what a prime number is. A prime is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I'm looking for a prime number where if I add up all its digits, the total is 19.

Let me look at each option and check if it's a prime and if its digits sum to 19.

Option A: 1991. Let me check if this is prime. To do that, I need to see if it's divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Let's try dividing by small primes. 1991 divided by 11 is, um, 11 times 181 is 1991? Wait, 11*180 is 1980, so 11*181 is 1991. So 1991 is not a prime because it's divisible by 11. So A is out.

Option B: 199. Let's check if it's prime. 199 is a known prime number. Let's add its digits: 1 + 9 + 9 = 19. Oh, that fits the condition! So 199 is a prime and its digits sum to 19. But wait, let's check the other options to see if there's a smaller one.

Option C: 289. Hmm, is this a prime? Let's see. I know 17 squared is 289 because 17*17 is 289. So 289 is 17 squared, which means it's not prime. So C is out.

Option D: 17. That's a prime number. Let's add its digits: 1 +7=8. Not 19. So D doesn't work.

Option E: 109. Is this prime? Let's think. Let's see if it's divisible by 2? No, it's odd. Divisible by 3? 1+0+9=10, not divisible by 3. Divisible by 5? Ends with 9, no. Next, 7? Let's see, 7*15 is 105, 105+7=112, which is more than 109. So 7 times 15 is 105, 109-105=4, which isn't a multiple of 7. So 7 isn't a factor. Next prime is 11: 11*9=99, 11*10=110, which is higher. So 11 doesn't divide 109. Next is 13: 13*8=104, 13*9=117. 109-104=5, which isn't a multiple of 13. So 13 doesn't divide 109. Then 17: 17*6=102, 17*7=119. So no. So 109 is prime. Now, its digits sum to 1+0+9=10, which is not 19. So E is out.

Option F: 29. That's a prime. Its digits sum to 2+9=11. Not 19. So F is out.

Option G: 991. Is this a prime? Let me check. 991 divided by small primes: it's not even, doesn't end with 5. Let's try 3: 9+9+1=19, not divisible by 3. 7: 7*141=987, 987+7=994, which is higher than 991. So 7 doesn't divide 991. 11: 11*90=990, 990+11=1001, too high. 13: 13*76=988, 988+13=1001. So no. 17: 17*58=986, 986+17=1003. So no. 19: 19*52=988, 988+19=1007. No. So 991 is a prime. Its digits sum: 9+9+1=19. Oh! So G is a prime and sum is 19. But wait, earlier I found 199 is a prime with digit sum 19. Between F and G, which is smaller? 199 is 199, G is 991, which is larger than 199. So 199 is smaller than 991. So A was 1991, which is larger than 199. So 199 is smaller than G.

Wait, so 199 is the smaller option. Let me double-check. Wait, I thought 199 is the correct answer, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other options between A and G.

Wait, what about option J: 5. 5 is a prime, but its digit sum is 5, not 19. So J is out.

Wait, but earlier I thought G is 991, which is a prime with digit sum 19, but 199 is smaller than 991. So, the smallest prime among the options is 199. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I should check if any other options are smaller than 199 but still have digit sum 19.

Looking back, the options are A:1991, B:199, C:289, D:17, E:109, F:29, G:991, H:11, I:919, J:5.

So B is 199, which is smaller than G. So 199 is the smallest possible prime in the options that meets the condition. So the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B: 199.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to find the smallest prime number whose digits sum to 19. The options are A: 1991, B: 199, C: 289, D: 17, E: 109, F: 29, G: 991, H: 11, I: 919, J: 5.

2. **Check Each Option:**
   - **A: 1991**  
     Not prime (1991 = 11 × 181). **Eliminate.**
   - **B: 199**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 1 + 9 + 9 = 19. **Valid.**
   - **C: 289**  
     Not prime (289 = 17 × 17). **Eliminate.**
   - **D: 17**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 1 + 7 = 8. **Eliminate.**
   - **E: 109**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 1 + 0 + 9 = 10. **Eliminate.**
   - **F: 29**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 2 + 9 = 11. **Eliminate.**
   - **G: 991**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 9 + 9 + 1 = 19. **Valid, but 199 is smaller.**
   - **H: 11**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 1 + 1 = 2. **Eliminate.**
   - **I: 919**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 9 + 1 + 9 = 19. **Valid, but 199 is smaller.**
   - **J: 5**  
     Prime. Digits sum: 5. **Eliminate.**

3. **Determine the Smallest:** Among the valid options, 199 is the smallest.

**Answer:** B: 199
