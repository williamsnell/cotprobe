Question:

Jack picks 60 apples from an apple tree. He uses 12 of them to make applesauce. He places the remaining apples equally into 6 gift baskets. Which equation can be used to determine the numberof apples, a, that Jack places into each gift basket?

Options:

A: (60-6)-12=a
B: (60+12)/6=a
C: (60—12)/6=a
D: (60/12) - 6 = a
E: (60 + 6)/12 = a
F: (60 + 12) - 6 = a
G: (60 - 12)*6 = a
H: (60/6) + 12 = a
I: (60 - 6)/12 = a
J: (60/6)—12=a

Okay, so I've got this question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Jack picks 60 apples from an apple tree. He uses 12 of them to make applesauce. He places the remaining equally into 6 gift baskets. The question is asking which equation can determine the number of apples, a, that Jack places into each basket.

Hmm. So the main steps are: total apples, subtract the ones used for applesauce, then divide equally into baskets.

Let me break it down. Jack has 60 apples. He uses 12 for applesauce. So the remaining apples are 60 minus 12. That makes sense because he's left with 48 apples. Then he puts these equally into 6 baskets. So each basket gets 48 divided by 6, which is 8 apples each.

So the equation should be (60 - 12) divided by 6, which is 48/6=8.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: (60-6)-12=a → That would be 54-12=42, which doesn't make sense.

B: (60+12)/6=a → 72/6=12. But he only used 12, so that would give 12 per basket, which is maybe not correct. Wait, he uses 12, but he's left with 48. So B would be 12, but that's the total, not per basket.

C: (60—12)/6=a → 48/6=8. That matches what I thought.

D: (60/12) - 6 = a → 5 -6 = -1. Negative apples? No, that doesn't make sense.

E: (60 +6)/12 =a → 66/12=5.5. Doesn't match 8.

F: (60 +12) -6 =a → 72-6=66. Again, that's 66, which is more than 48, so that can't be right.

G: (60 -12)*6 =a → 48*6=288. Way too high.

H: (60/6) + 12 =a → 10 +12=22. No, that's not relevant.

I: (60 -6)/12 =a → 54/12=4.5. Doesn't match 8.

J: (60/6)—12=a → 10 -12= -2. Negative again.

So the only correct equation is option C.

The correct equation is (60 - 12)/6 = a, which calculates to 8 apples per basket.

Answer: C
