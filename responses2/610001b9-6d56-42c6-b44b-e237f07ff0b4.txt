Okay, so I've got this question about free abelian groups and their bases. Hmm, I need to figure out whether Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true or not. Let's start by remembering what a free abelian group is. 

A free abelian group is one that has a basis, meaning it's isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the integers. The number of these copies is called the rank of the group. So, for example, the integers Z itself is a free abelian group of rank 1. 

Statement 1 says every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases. Wait, what's a 'base'? Oh right, a basis is a maximal set of linearly independent elements. For a free abelian group, any basis has the same number of elements, which is the rank. So, if the group is of infinite rank, like ℚ × ℚ × ℚ × ... (countably infinite times), does that mean there's an infinite number of bases? Because each possible set of elements that are linearly independent (and maximal) would count as a different basis. So if the group is infinite-dimensional, there could be infinitely many bases. So Statement 1 seems to be saying that every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases. I think that makes sense. So I'd say Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2 says every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the rank is at least 2, then the number of possible bases is actually infinite. Because you can pick any set of elements that are linearly independent, and there are infinitely many ways to choose such elements. For example, in a group like Z × Z, any basis has two elements, but you can change them in infinitely many ways, so there are infinitely many bases. So Statement 2 is also true. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let's think about the definitions again. The rank is the maximum size of a free generating set, so if the group has rank 2, then each basis must consist of two elements. But can you have infinitely many such bases? Yes, because you can have different combinations. So both statements are true. So the answer should be option B: True, True. Let me check the options again. 

Looking back, the options are:

A: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is not applicable.

B: True, True

C: False, False

D: Statement 1 is not applicable, Statement 2 is true.

E: Both statements are not applicable.

F: True, False.

G: False, True.

H: Statement 1 is sometimes true, Statement 2 is false.

I: Both statements are sometimes true.

J: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is sometimes true.

So the correct option is B. Both statements are true.

The correct answer is B: True, True.
