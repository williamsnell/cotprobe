Okay, so I've got this problem where Ramanujan and Hardy played a game with complex numbers. The product of their numbers is 32 - 8i, and Hardy picked 5 + 3i. I need to find out what Ramanujan picked. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when you multiply two complex numbers, you can use the distributive property. So, if Ramanujan's number is some complex number z, then the product z * (5 + 3i) should equal 32 - 8i. So, mathematically, that's z * (5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i. To find z, I need to solve for it.

Wait, right, so to solve for z, I can divide both sides by (5 + 3i). Because if z multiplied by (5 + 3i) is 32 - 8i, then z must be (32 - 8i) divided by (5 + 3i). So, z = (32 - 8i)/(5 + 3i). 

But dividing complex numbers isn't straightforward. I remember that to divide by a complex number, you multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (5 + 3i) is (5 - 3i). So, I'll multiply both top and bottom by (5 - 3i).

So, numerator becomes (32 - 8i)(5 - 3i), and denominator becomes (5 + 3i)(5 - 3i). Let me calculate each part.

First, the denominator: (5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) is 5*5 + 5*(-3i) + 3i*5 + 3i*(-3i). That's 25 -15i +15i -9i². The -15i and +15i cancel out, and i² is -1. So, denominator is 25 -9*(-1) = 25 + 9 =34. So denominator is 34.

Now the numerator: (32 -8i)(5 -3i). Let's expand this. 32*5 is 160. 32*(-3i) is -96i. -8i*5 is -40i. -8i*(-3i) is +24i². So putting that together:

160 -96i -40i +24i².

Again, i² is -1, so 24i² is 24*(-1) = -24. So the numerator becomes 160 -96i -40i -24. Let's combine like terms.

160 -24 is 136. Then, -96i -40i is -136i. So numerator is 136 -136i.

So now, z = (136 -136i)/34. Let's divide each term by 34.

136/34 is 4, and -136i/34 is -4i. So z is 4 -4i.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 5+3i, which is Hardy's number. Option G is 4-4i, which is what I got. So the answer should be G:4-4i.

The product of Ramanujan's and Hardy's numbers is 32 - 8i, with Hardy's number being 5 + 3i. To find Ramanujan's number (z), we solve z * (5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i. Dividing both sides by (5 + 3i), we get z = (32 - 8i)/(5 + 3i). Multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate (5 - 3i), we calculate:

Numerator: (32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 160 - 96i - 40i + 24i² = 160 - 136i - 24 = 136 - 136i.

Denominator: (5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 25 - 9i² = 25 + 9 = 34.

Thus, z = (136 - 136i)/34 = 4 - 4i.

The correct answer is G:4-4i.

Answer: G
