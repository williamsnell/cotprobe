Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, there's a sofa that's worth $547.50. It was bought on an installment plan with a 20% down payment and the rest paid over 36 months. There's also a service charge of 20% on the unpaid balance. I need to find out how much each monthly payment is.

First, I think I should calculate the down payment. 20% of $547.50 is... let me see, 20% is the same as 0.2, so 0.2 * 547.50. Let me do that math. 547.50 * 0.2 is 109.50. So, the down payment is $109.50.

Now, subtract that from the total price to get the remaining amount. So, 547.50 minus 109.50 is... let's see, 547.50 - 100 is 447.50, minus another 9.50 is 438. So, the remaining amount to be paid is $438.

But wait, there's a service charge too. Oh right, 20% of the unpaid balance is added as service charge. So, 20% of $438. Let me calculate that. 0.2 * 438 is 87.60. So, the service charge is $87.60.

Now, the total amount to be paid is the remaining balance plus the service charge. So, $438 + $87.60 is 525.60. So, the total amount to be paid over 36 months is $525.60.

To find each month's payment, I need to divide this total by 36. So, 525.60 divided by 36. Let's compute that. Hmm, 36 times 14 is 504, 36 times 15 is 540 which is higher than 525.60. So, 14 times 36 is 504. Subtract that from 525.60: 525.60 - 504 = 21.60. So, that's 21.60 left. Now, 21.60 divided by 36 is 0.60. So, each month's payment is $14.60.

Wait, let me double-check that. 14.60 * 36 is 525.60. Yes, that's correct. So each payment is $14.60. Looking at the options, that's option D: $14.60.

The calculation involves determining the down payment, subtracting it from the total price to find the remaining balance, calculating the service charge, and then dividing the total to be paid by the number of months. The result is $14.60 per month.
