Okay, so I've got this paint and cube problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question says that the amount of paint David needs is directly proportional to the surface area of a cube. That makes sense because more paint usually means a larger area being covered.

So, the first part tells me that David can completely cover a cube with side length 2 feet using exactly 16 quarts of paint. I need to find out what size cube he can cover with 169 quarts of paint.

Hmm, okay. Since the amount of paint is directly proportional to the surface area, I can set up a proportion. Let me denote the amount of paint as P and the surface area as S. So, P1 / S1 = P2 / S2, where P1 and S1 are the paint and surface area for the first cube, and P2 and S2 are for the second cube.

Wait, but in this case, I think it's better to express it as P1 = k * S1, where k is the constant of proportionality. So, since P1 is 16 quarts and S1 is the surface area of the cube with side length 2.

Let me calculate the surface area of the first cube. A cube has 6 faces, each face is a square with area side^2. So, S1 = 6*(2)^2 = 6*4 = 24 square feet.

So, 16 quarts = k * 24. Therefore, k = 16/24, which simplifies to 2/3. So, the constant of proportionality is 2/3 quarts per square foot.

Now, for the second cube, we know we have P2 = 169 quarts. Using the same formula, P2 = k * S2. Plugging in the values: 169 = (2/3) * S2.

To find S2, we can rearrange: S2 = (169 * 3)/2. Let me compute that: 169 * 3 is 507, divided by 2 is 253.5 square feet.

Wait a second, the surface area of the cube is 253.5 square feet. Since the surface area of a cube is 6*(edge length)^2, we can set up the equation:

6 * (edge length)^2 = 253.5

So, (edge length)^2 = 253.5 / 6. Let me compute that. 253.5 divided by 6 is 42.25.

So, (edge length)^2 = 42.25. Taking the square root of both sides, edge length = sqrt(42.25). Hmm, what's the square of 6.5? 6.5 * 6.5 is 42.25. So, the edge length is 6.5 feet.

Wait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. Let me check the options. Option B is 13/2, which is 6.5. So that's the answer.

Let me recap just to be sure. Surface area is proportional to the amount of paint, so the ratio of the areas (and thus the ratio of paint) is the same. First cube: 2ft side, surface area 24 ft², paint 16 quarts. So, paint per square foot is 16/24=2/3. For 169 quarts, paint per square foot is 169/ S2. Setting equal: 2/3 = 169/S2 => S2= (169*3)/2=253.5. Surface area is 253.5, edge length is sqrt(253.5/6)=sqrt(42.25)=6.5. Yep, that's 13/2. So option B.
</think>

The surface area of a cube is proportional to the amount of paint used, as the paint needed is directly proportional to the surface area. For the first cube (side 2 ft), surface area = 6*(2)^2 = 24 ft², and paint used is 16 quarts. The constant of proportionality is 16/24 = 2/3 quarts per ft². For 169 quarts, the surface area is 169*(3/2) = 253.5 ft². The edge length is sqrt(253.5/6) = sqrt(42.25) = 6.5 ft = 13/2. Thus, the cube has an edge length of 13/2 feet.

Answer: B
