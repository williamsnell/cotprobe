Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about unions and their methods for increasing wages. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is asking which method is NOT used by unions to increase wages. The options are A to J, each representing a different method.

First, I need to remember what unions do. Unions typically represent workers' interests, often through negotiations with employers. They aim to improve working conditions, including wages, benefits, and working hours.

Looking at the options:

A: Seeking to increase the demand for the union's labor. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If unions want more demand, maybe they could negotiate higher wages, but isn't this about increasing the supply rather than the demand? Or perhaps it's about signaling to employers. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one yet.

B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Wait, that doesn't make sense. A wage floor is a minimum wage set by the government, not negotiated. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum, but that's more about setting a floor rather than negotiating for a floor. So maybe B is not a method they use to increase wages, but instead to set a higher minimum. So this could be the answer because the question is about increasing, not decreasing.

C: Encouraging workers to increase productivity. I think unions do support workers' productivity through training, education, and other means. This is more about productivity rather than wage increase.

D: Lobbying for higher minimum wage laws. Yes, that's a method. Unions can campaign for higher minimum wages by lobbying.

E: Promoting worker training and education. Unions support training to improve skills and decrease unemployment, which also helps with wages.

F: Restrictive membership policies. I'm not sure. Restrictive policies might limit union activity, perhaps decreasing their influence. Or maybe they restrict the union's ability to unionize, which could be a way to control wages. Not entirely sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

G: Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources. How does that tie into wages? Maybe by restricting the production of certain resources to affect wages, but not directly increasing them. Alternatively, if a union wants to increase prices for substitute resources, maybe they would set a price higher than the market, but that's about supply rather than wage increase. Not sure if this is a method to increase wages.

H: Featherbedding or make-work rules. These are older labor practices, not directly related to wage increases. Unions might be against these because they can affect working conditions, but they don't use this method to increase wages.

I: Encouraging government regulation of industries. Unions can influence labor unions to push for stricter regulations, which might affect wages. So this is a valid method.

J: Instituting strike actions. Striking could lead to higher wages as companies might demand higher pay to keep workers involved. So this is a possible method.

So, going back to the options. The question is which method is NOT used to increase wages. 

Looking at B again: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum wage, but they don't negotiate for a floor. A wage floor is a set minimum, not negotiated. So B is not a method they use.

Another angle: If a union wants to increase wages, they might negotiate for a higher minimum (which is more about setting a floor than negotiating for one). So B is not a method they use. 

But wait, sometimes unions might negotiate for a higher minimum wage, which is a form of increasing wages. So perhaps in that sense, B is a method. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.

The question is about what is NOT a method. So the correct answer is the option that isn't used. 

Another option: F says restrictive membership policies. Unions might limit their membership to certain types of workers or industries, which could affect their ability to influence wages. But that's about restricting membership, not increasing wages. So maybe F is another method not used, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is which is not a method. So the methods they do use include B (if they negotiate for a higher minimum), D (looking for higher laws), E (training), J (striking), I (regulation), and A (signaling to unions). 

So, the option not used is B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor.

Wait, because a wage floor is a legal minimum, not a negotiated one. So if a union wants to increase the minimum, they wouldn't be negotiating for a floor. They might negotiate for a higher minimum, which is a form of increasing. So in that case, B is a method used.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options again.

Which method is not used? So the options are:

A: Seeking to increase the demand for labor. Wait, unions typically increase supply, not demand. So if they want to increase demand, maybe they push for more workers, but that's not a common method. Or perhaps seeking to increase demand is a way they can, but it's not a primary method. Not sure.

Back to the question. The options are about methods unions use. The question is which is NOT among the methods.

So the methods they use include B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum, which is a form of increasing. So B is a method.

Wait, perhaps B is not a method because a wage floor is a set minimum, not obtained by negotiation. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, the question is: which is not a method? So B is not a method because it's about setting a floor, not negotiating for one.

Wait, but some unions might still negotiate for a higher minimum, which is a way to increase. So B is still a method.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's think of each option:

A: Seeking to increase demand for union labor. Unions might not directly seek to increase demand. Instead, they might focus on supply by signaling higher wages. So A could be a method, but not the primary method.

B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum, which is a way to increase. So B is a method.

C: Encouraging productivity. Yes, unions do this.

D: Lobbying. Yes.

E: Training. Yes.

F: Restrictive policies. Not sure. Maybe unions don't restrict membership, but restrict their influence. Alternatively, restrictive membership policies might limit their ability to unionize, but not necessarily increase wages.

G: Decrease prices of substitute resources. Unions might argue that by limiting the availability of substitute resources, they can keep wages up. So G is a method.

H: Featherbedding. Unions don't promote this. Featherbedding is about restricting labor, not increasing wages.

I: Government regulation. Yes, unions can push for stricter regulations.

J: Strike actions. Yes, strikes can lead to higher wages.

So the options that are methods are A, B, C, D, E, I, J. The ones not are F and H.

Wait, F says restrictive membership policies. Unions wouldn't restrict membership but might restrict their ability to unionize. So F is not a method. G is not a method.

So the question is which is not a method. So options F and G are not methods.

Wait, the question is which is NOT among the methods. The options are A to J.

The options are:

Which is not among the methods?

So the not methods are F and G.

Looking back, the question is which is NOT a method. So F is restrictive membership policies. Unions will not restrict membership, but perhaps restrict their ability. Alternatively, maybe they can't unionize in restrictive ways, but that's not a method. So F is not a method.

Wait, but the question is about methods, so F is not a method.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each method.

The options are:

Option B: Negotiations for wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum, but not set the floor. So if B is about setting the floor, it's not a method they use. But if B is about negotiating for a floor, then it's a method.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me look for another angle.

The question is which is not a method. So the options that are not methods are F and G.

But in the options, only one is the answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which is not a method.

Another thought: Featherbedding or make-work rules (G) are not methods unions use. Unions focus on labor rights, not on restricting production.

So which of the options is not a method? The options are:

F: Restrictive membership policies. Unions may restrict their ability to unionize, so F is not a method.

G: Decrease prices of substitute resources. Unions might argue that restricting substitute resources can keep wages up, but that's more about production costs, not prices. So G is not a method.

Wait, but I thought the question includes the options as the possible answers. So the options are A to J, and the question is which is not among the methods.

So the methods are:

A: Seeking to increase demand. Not a primary method, but perhaps.

B: Negotiations for wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum, which is a method.

C: Encouraging productivity. Yes, a method.

D: Lobbying. Yes.

E: Training. Yes.

F: Restrictive membership policies. Unions may restrict their ability to unionize, which is a method.

G: Decrease prices of substitute resources. Unions argue that restricting substitute resources can keep wages up, which is a method.

H: Featherbedding. Unions don't promote this.

I: Government regulation. Yes.

J: Strike actions. Yes.

So the methods are A, B, C, D, E, I, J. The not methods are F, G, H.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is which is not among the methods. The options are A to J, and the question is which is not a method.

So the not methods are F, G, H. But the options presented are single letters.

Wait, but the options are:

Options A to J, each a possible answer.

So the question is which is not a method. So all options except the correct one are methods. So which one is not a method.

So the answer must be F, G, or H.

Wait, let me think again. Let's consider each option:

A: Seeking to increase demand for the union's labor. I'm not sure. Unions might not directly seek to increase demand for their labor. They might focus on signaling higher wages. So A is not a method.

B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum, which is a form of increasing. So B is a method.

C: Encouraging productivity. Yes, a method.

D: Lobbying for higher minimum. Yes.

E: Training. Yes.

F: Restrictive membership. Unions might restrict their ability to unionize, so F is not a method.

G: Decrease prices of substitute resources. Unions might argue that restricting substitute resources can keep wages up, so G is a method.

H: Featherbedding. Unions don't promote this. So H is not a method.

I: Regulation. Yes.

J: Strike. Yes.

So the not methods are A, D, I, J (as per the previous reasoning). Wait, no, I thought earlier that the correct answer was B, but I'm now getting confused.

Wait, the question is which method is NOT among the ones unions use.

So the methods are:

A: Not a primary method. Unions might not seek to increase demand.

B: Unions might negotiate for a wage floor. So B is a method.

C: Encouraging productivity. Yes.

D: Lobbging for wage floor. No, D is about looking for the floor.

Wait, no. D is about looking for a wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher floor, so D is a method.

E: Training. Yes.

F: Restrictive policies. Unions may restrict membership, so F is not a method.

G: Decrease prices of substitute resources. Unions might argue that restricting substitute resources can keep wages up, so G is a method.

H: Featherbedding. Not a method.

I: Regulation. Yes.

J: Strike. Yes.

So the methods are B, C, D, E, I, J. The not methods are A, F, G, H.

Wait, but the options are single letters. So the question is which is not a method.

So the options are:

A: Not a method.

B: Method.

C: Method.

D: Method.

E: Method.

F: Not a method.

G: Method.

H: Not a method.

I: Method.

J: Method.

So the options not among the methods are A, F, H.

But the question is asking which one is not among the methods. So the correct answer is one of these.

Looking back at the original question: the options are A to J, and the question is which is not a method.

So the options in the question are the possible answers. So the correct answer is the one that is not a method.

The options that are methods are B, C, D, E, I, J.

So the options that are not methods are A, F, H.

Wait, the options are:

A: Seeking to increase demand for the union's labor.

B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor.

C: Encouraging productivity.

D: Lobbying for higher minimum wage laws.

E: Promoting worker training and education.

F: Restrictive membership policies.

G: Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources.

H: Featherbedding or make-work rules.

I: Encouraging government regulation of industries.

J: Instituting strike actions.

The question is asking which is NOT a method.

So the answer would be one of A, F, H.

But the correct answer in the options is one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is F (F: Restrictive membership policies) or H (H: Featherbedding) or A (A: seeking demand).

But in the options, which of these is not a method.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Let me think again.

Unions might restrict their ability to unionize, which is a method (F is not a method). So the answer is F.

But wait, another thought: Featherbedding is not a method. So G is not a method.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the question includes the options as the possible answers, so the correct answer is one of the letters. So which of these is not a method.

The question is which is not a method. So the options that are not methods are F, G, H.

Wait, the options are:

F: Restrictive membership policies.

G: Decrease prices of substitute resources.

H: Featherbedding.

So, the methods are B, C, D, E, I, J.

The not methods are F, G, H.

So the question is which is not a method. So the correct answer is F, G, or H.

But the question is one of the letters. So the correct answer is F, G, or H.

But the options are single letters, and the question says which is not among the methods.

So, the options are single letters, and the question is which is not a method.

So the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

So the methods are B, C, D, E, I, J.

The not methods are A, F, G, H.

Looking for which one is the answer.

The question is: Which of the following is not among the methods.

So the answer is one of the four not methods: A, F, G, H.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is F, G, or H.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, G, or H.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each method again.

Option B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum, which is a way of increasing. So B is a method.

Option F: Restrictive membership policies. Unions might restrict their ability to unionize, so F is not a method.

Option G: Decrease prices of substitute resources. Unions might argue that this can keep wages up by restricting substitute factors. So G is a method.

Option H: Featherbedding. Unions don't promote this. So H is not a method.

So the not methods are B, C, D, E, I, J. The not options are A, F, G, H.

But the question is which is not a method. So the options not being methods are A, F, G, H.

Wait, the options are each a possible answer. So which one is the correct answer?

The question asks for the one that is not a method. So the correct answers are letters A, F, G, H.

But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because restrictive membership policies are not a method. Alternatively, H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because unions might restrict membership, which is a method?

Wait, no. Restrictive membership policies are not a method. Unions might restrict their ability to unionize, but not restrict their membership.

So, F is not a method.

Thus, the answer is F.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: the question includes the options as the possible answers, so the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the options in the question are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and the question is which is not a method. So the answer is F.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the correct answer was B. But perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, G, or H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, and I need to make a decision.

The question is which is not a method. The methods are B, C, D, E, I, J. The not methods are A, F, G, H.

So the options that are not methods are A, F, G, H.

But the question presents the options as the possible answers, so the correct answer is one of these letters: A, F, G, H.

But the question is a single-choice question, so I'll have to choose.

Wait, the correct answer is F. So I'll proceed with that.
</think>

The question asks which method is not used by unions to increase wages. Here's the breakdown:

- **A**: Seeking to increase the demand for the union's labor. Unions typically increase supply through signaling rather than increasing demand.
- **B**: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Unions might negotiate for a higher minimum wage, which indirectly increases the minimum wage.
- **C**: Encouraging workers to increase productivity. This is a method unions use.
- **D**: Lobbing for higher minimum wage laws. Unions can argue for this.
- **E**: Promoting worker training and education. This is a method unions use.
- **F**: Restrictive membership policies. Unions might restrict their ability to unionize, which is not a method.
- **G**: Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources. Unions might argue that restricting substitute resources can keep wages up.
- **H**: Featherbedding or make-work rules. Unions do not promote these practices.
- **I**: Encouraging government regulation of industries. Unions can influence industry regulations.
- **J**: Instituting strike actions. Strikes can lead to higher wages.

The options that are not methods are **A**, **F**, **G**, and **H**. Among these, **F** (restrictive membership policies) is not a method unions use because they restrict unionization rather than restricting membership. 

ANSWER: F
