Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about sound frequencies. Hmm, let's see. The question says the airplane is flying at Mach 0.5, which I think is a speed of half the speed of sound. It carries a sound source emitting a 1000-Hz signal. The listener is in the path after the airplane has passed. I need to find out the frequency the listener hears.

Wait, I remember that when a source and observer are moving relative to the medium (like air), there's a Doppler effect to consider. Oh right, the Doppler shift formula. But wait, when the source and observer are moving towards each other, the observed frequency increases, and when moving away, it decreases. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh wait, the formula depends on whether they're moving towards or away. 

The formula for the Doppler effect when the source is moving is f' = f * (v + v_observer) / (v + v_source). But I need to get the signs right. Oh wait, the signs depend on the direction. If the source is moving towards the observer, then v_source is positive, and the observer is moving towards, so v_observer is positive. So in this case, the source is moving away from the listener, because after the airplane has passed, the listener is behind the plane. So the source is moving away, and the listener is stationary? Wait, no. The problem says the listener is in the path after the airplane has passed. So the airplane is moving away from the listener. So the source is moving away, and the listener is stationary. So the observer's velocity is zero. So the formula becomes f' = f * (v) / (v + v_source). But wait, I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the formula is f' = f * (v ± v_observer) / (v ± v_source). The plus signs are for when the observer is moving towards the source, and the minus signs are for when the source is moving away. So in this case, the source is moving away, so we use the minus. The observer is moving towards the source (since after the airplane passes, the listener is behind, so the source is moving away, and the listener is moving in the same direction as the source's movement? Wait, no, the observer is at rest relative to the air, so their velocity is zero. So the formula would be f' = f * (v) / (v + v_source). Because the source is moving away, so we subtract v_source from the denominator.

Wait, let me double-check. I think the formula when the observer is stationary is f' = f * (v) / (v + v_source). Because when the source is moving away, the denominator adds their speed. So when the source is moving away, the denominator is larger; so the observed frequency is lower than the emitted frequency.

Wait, the emitted frequency is 1000 Hz. So if the source is moving away, the observed frequency is lower. So what's the speed here? The speed of sound in air is about 343 m/s at 20°C. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify temperature. Hmm, but maybe the exact temperature isn't an issue because the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the temperature. Wait, or is the problem using a standard value? Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value. Oh, wait, wait, the speed of sound in air is approximately 340 m/s at 20°C. So if the plane is moving at Mach 0.5, what's that speed?

Mach number is speed relative to air divided by speed of sound. So if the plane is Mach 0.5, then its speed is 0.5 * 340 m/s = 170 m/s. 

So now, the sound source is moving away from the observer (the listener is in the path after the plane has passed, so the source is moving away). So the Doppler effect formula is f' = f * (v + v_observer) / (v - v_source). Because the observer is stationary, v+vo is v. The source is moving away, so v - vs is the denominator.

Wait, plugging the numbers:

v = 340 m/s
v_observer = 0
v_source = 170 m/s

So f' = 1000 * (340) / (340 - 170) )

Calculating denominator: 340-170=170.

So f' = 1000 * 340 / 170 = 1000 * 2 = 2000 Hz? Wait, that can't be right. Because when a source moves away, the frequency should be lower. Oh wait, wait, did I mix up the formula?

Wait, the formula is f' = f * (v) / (v - vs). So yes, if the source is moving away, the denominator is v - vs. So in this case, 340/(340 - 170) = 2. So 1000 * 2 = 2000 Hz. But wait, that would mean the sound is higher in frequency, which isn't the case because the source is moving away. That suggests I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the formula is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v + vs). If the source is moving away, then vs is positive, and vo is zero. So f' = 1000 * (340 + 0)/(340 + 170) ) = 1000 * 340 / 510 = (1000/510) * 340 = (approx 1.96) * 340 ≈ 666 Hz. Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me see the options again.

The options are A:1000, B:500, C:2000, D:1250, E:667, etc. So E is 667, which is about 667 Hz. Wait, wait, maybe the speed of sound is 343 m/s. Let me recalculate with v=343.

So applying the same formula:

f' = 1000 * 343 / (343 - 170 )

Compute denominator: 343 - 170 = 173.

So 1000 * 343 / 173 = ?

343/173 is approximately 1.983. So 1000 * 1.983 = ~1983 Hz. Hmm, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact Doppler formula.

Wait, let me think again. The Doppler effect when the source is moving away and the observer is stationary is f' = f * (v) / (v + v_source) )

Because the source is moving away, so the denominator is v + vs. So v=343, vs=170.

So f'=1000 * 343 / (343 + 170) = 1000 * 343 / 513.

Compute 343/513: 343 ÷ 513 ≈ 0.667.

So 1000 * 0.667 ≈ 667 Hz. So option E is 667 Hz.

So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the frequency heard by the listener after the airplane has passed, we use the Doppler effect formula for a source moving away from the observer. The formula is:

\[
f' = f \cdot \frac{v}{v + v_{\text{source}}}
\]

where:
- \( f = 1000 \, \text{Hz} \) (emitted frequency),
- \( v = 343 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of sound in air),
- \( v_{\text{source}} = 170 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of the source, the airplane, moving away from the observer).

### Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula
\[
f' = 1000 \cdot \frac{343}{343 + 170}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the denominator
\[
343 + 170 = 513
\]

### Step 3: Perform the division
\[
\frac{343}{513} \approx 0.667
\]

### Step 4: Multiply by the emitted frequency
\[
f' = 1000 \cdot 0.667 \approx 667 \, \text{Hz}
\]

### Conclusion
The listener hears a frequency of approximately **667 Hz** after the airplane has passed. This corresponds to option **E**.
