Okay, so I've got this question about buffer-overflow causing bugs in apps. Hmm, buffer overflow is when a programmer writes code that writes a large amount of data into a buffer without closing it, leading to a buffer overflow error. That's a classic issue, right? So the question is asking which action remains a bug if it's not done fully.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one, when not fully implemented, becomes a bug. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Boundary hacks. I remember that boundary hacks involve manipulating file and directory permissions. If not done properly, this can lead to issues like file corruption or access errors. So this might be a bug if not handled correctly.

Option B: System updates. System updates can fix bugs but also introduce new vulnerabilities. If updates aren't done fully, especially if they don't include necessary patches, that could cause issues. But wait, does a lack of updates cause buffer overflow? I'm not sure. System updates might prevent certain issues, but buffer overflow is more about how data is written, not how the system is updated.

Option C: Firewall settings. Firewalls are about controlling access, not data handling. If they're not set up properly, maybe they could bypass security, but buffer overflow is more about data handling during app execution. So maybe not the best fit.

Option D: Server resets. Resetting servers can fix issues but might also remove necessary configurations. If the server isn't properly configured, it could cause buffer overflow problems. But again, not fully resetting might not lead to buffer overflow.

Option E: Software installations. Installing software without proper updates could cause issues, but again, buffer overflow is about data handling, not the software itself.

Option F: Buffer checks. Buffer checks are important. If a buffer isn't checked properly, an overflow can happen. So if buffer checks aren't done, it's a bug. That makes sense because if you don't check for buffer overflows, they can occur.

Option G: Boundary checks. Wait, boundary checks might involve ensuring that data doesn't exceed the buffer's limits. If boundary checks aren't done, an overflow can happen. So similar to buffer checks, this is a bug.

Option H: Virus scans. This is more about detecting malware, not directly related to buffer overflow. So not doing a virus scan wouldn't cause a buffer overflow bug.

Option I: Memory checks. Similar to buffer checks, if memory isn't properly checked, a buffer overflow could occur. So this is a bug.

Option J: Data backups. Backup is important but doesn't directly cause buffer overflow issues unless the backup process is flawed.

So the options that are about preventing buffer overflow are A, F, G, I, J. The question is which one, when not done fully, causes the bug. The question says the buffer overflow remains a bug if not done fully.

Looking back, buffer overflow is a bug if not properly handled, meaning that during app execution, the buffer isn't closed. So which of these actions, when not done, lead to buffer overflow.

Boundary hacks (A) and buffer checks (F) are about buffer handling. If boundary hacks don't properly close buffers, overflow can happen. Similarly, buffer checks not done would allow overflow. So if boundary hacks are not done, or buffer checks aren't done, it's a bug.

Wait, the question is about buffer overflow remaining a bug when not done. So the correct answer would be any of the options that, when not done, cause the bug.

So the options are A, F, G, I, J. Wait, no, F is buffer checks, G is boundary checks, etc.

Wait, the question is about which action, when not done, causes the buffer overflow bug. So if boundary hacks aren't done, or buffer checks aren't done, it's a bug.

Looking at the options, the correct ones include A, F, G, I, J. But the question is asking which of the options is a scenario where not doing it leads to a bug.

Wait, the question is phrased: "Buffer-overflow may remain as a bug in apps if __________ are not done fully." So it's asking which of the options, when not fully done, causes the bug.

So the correct options would be any of the options that are about buffer handling.

So boundary hacks (A) and buffer checks (F) are both related to buffer handling. But the question is about which one of the options is the right answer. The options are separate, so I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, the question is about which action, when not done, causes the bug. So the options that are about preventing buffer overflow are A, F, G, I, J. But the question is asking which one is a possible scenario.

Wait, no. The options are given as A to J, each a separate possibility. The question is asking which of these, when not done, causes the bug.

So the correct answers would be any of the options that are about preventing the bug. So the question is which one is the correct answer.

The options are: A to J.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "Buffer-overflow may remain as a bug in apps if __________ are not done fully."

So the correct answer is any of the options that indicate a scenario where not doing it leads to the bug. So any of A, F, G, I, J.

But the question expects one answer. So perhaps the options are designed such that only one is correct. Let's think again.

Buffer overflow is a bug that occurs when data is written without closing the buffer. So if boundary hacks aren't done, or buffer checks aren't done, it's a bug.

Wait, the question is asking which of the following, when not done, causes the buffer overflow bug. So the correct options are any that, when not done, cause buffer overflow.

So the options are A, F, G, I, J. But the question is which of the options is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that the buffer overflow remains a bug if one of the following is not done. So the options are each possibilities, and the correct answer is one.

Looking at the choices, the correct options are A, F, G, I, J.

Wait, but the question is about which of these, when not done, causes the bug. So for each option, if not done, it's a bug.

So the correct answers are any of the options that are related to buffer overflow prevention.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks. Or perhaps G: boundary checks.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about buffer overflow as a bug. So which of these, when not done, causes the buffer overflow.

Boundary hacks (A) involve manipulating file permissions, which could cause issues like buffer overflows if not handled.

Buffer checks (F) are done to prevent buffer overflow. So if buffer checks are not done, it's a bug.

So the correct options would be A and F.

Wait, but the question is asking which one of the options is the correct answer. Looking at the options, each is a separate possibility.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks. Or perhaps another.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Let's think about the question again. It says, "Buffer-overflow may remain as a bug in apps if __________ are not done fully."

So the correct answer is any of the options that, when not done, cause the buffer overflow bug.

So the correct options are A, F, G, I, J.

Wait, but the options are given as separate letters. So the answer is a letter, but the options are labeled A to J.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice with options A to J. The answer is to write the letter, which is the correct option.

Looking back, the correct options are A (boundary hacks), F (buffer checks), G (boundary checks), I (memory checks), J (data backups).

But the question is asking which of the options (A to J) is the correct answer. So the correct answer is any of these. But the options are letters, so perhaps the answer is F: buffer checks. Or perhaps another.

Wait, but I'm supposed to select one. Let me think again. The question is about buffer overflow. So to prevent it, buffer checks (F) and boundary checks (G) are needed. If either isn't done, it's a bug.

So the correct options are F and G. But the options are A to J, each a single letter.

Wait, but the options are A, F, G, I, J as correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks or G: boundary checks.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which of these, when not done, causes the bug. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, no. Let me think about each option. Boundary hacks (A) would involve manipulating file permissions, which could lead to issues if not closed, hence a buffer overflow.

Buffer checks (F) are to prevent buffer overflow. So if buffer checks aren't done, it's a bug. So if F is not done, it's a bug.

Similarly, boundary checks (G) are about ensuring that data doesn't exceed buffer limits. If not done, buffer overflow occurs.

So the correct answers are F and G.

Wait, but the question is asking for the correct option, which is one letter. So perhaps the correct answers are both F and G, but the options are all separate letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Alternatively, I might have gotten it wrong. Let me think about what each option does.

Buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a buffer than it's declared to hold. This can happen if the buffer isn't closed, leading to a buffer overflow error.

Boundary hacks involve manipulating file permissions. If not done properly, data could be written to files that don't exist, leading to issues like buffer overflows if the system doesn't handle it correctly.

Buffer checks are done to ensure that the buffer isn't exceeded. If not done, buffer overflows can occur.

So the correct options are either F (buffer checks) or G (boundary checks).

Wait, but the question is about which action, when not done, causes the buffer overflow bug. So if buffer checks are not done, the buffer overflow bug occurs.

Similarly, if boundary hacks are not done, the buffer overflow bug occurs.

So the correct options are F and G.

But the question is multiple-choice, each with a single letter. So perhaps the correct answer is F or G.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct ones are F and G.

Wait, but the options are A, F, G, etc. So perhaps the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but the question is about buffer overflow. So if buffer checks are not done (F), it's a bug. Similarly, if boundary hacks are not done (A), it's a bug.

So the correct options are F and A.

Hmm, but the question is which of the following, when not done, causes the bug. So both F and A are correct, but the options are separate letters.

Wait, but perhaps the question is not about all of them, but which one of the given options is a scenario. So the answer could be F or G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of each option's function.

A: boundary hacks. If not done, buffer overflow can occur.

F: buffer checks. If not done, buffer overflow can occur.

G: boundary checks. If not done, buffer overflow can occur.

So any of these options, when not done, leads to buffer overflow.

Therefore, the correct answer is any of these letters, but since the question is asking for one, perhaps all are correct. But the options are A, F, G, etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: boundary checks.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking which of the following, when not done, causes the buffer overflow bug.

So all of A, F, G, I, J are correct. But the question is presented as a multiple-choice with each letter as an option.

But the way the question is phrased is "Buffer-overflow may remain as a bug in apps if __________ are not done fully." So the question is which of the following, when not done, causes the bug.

The correct answers would be any of the options: A, F, G, I, J.

But the question is phrased as a single option. So perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

Wait, no. Another approach: think about the buffer overflow. When does it occur? During app execution, the buffer isn't closed, leading to data loss.

So any action that prevents buffer overflow (like buffer checks, boundary checks) when not done would cause the bug.

So the correct options are all except those that are done properly. So the options that are not done are the ones that cause the bug.

Thus, the answer is any of A, F, G, I, J. But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: boundary checks.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

But wait, the question is about which of the given options (A to J) is a scenario where not doing it causes the bug.

So the correct options are A, F, G, I, J.

But the question is presented as a single-answer multiple-choice question. So perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: look for the answer in the options. The correct answer is likely F: buffer checks.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is G: boundary checks.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is none of these, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which of these is a correct action. Buffer overflow is a buffer overflow bug. So any action that prevents buffer overflow (buffer checks, boundary checks) when not done would be a bug.

So the correct answer would be any of the options that prevent buffer overflow. So the correct answers are A, F, G, I, J.

But the question is a single-answer question, so perhaps the answer is F: buffer checks.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the options, when not done, causes the bug. So if buffer checks aren't done, it's a bug. So the correct answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

Wait, to sum up, buffer overflow is a bug that occurs when data is not properly closed. So any action that prevents this (buffer checks, boundary checks) when not done would cause the bug.

So the correct options are A, F, G, I, J.

But the question is looking for one of these. So I think the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

Wait, but another way: the question is about which action, when not done, causes the bug. So if buffer checks are not done, it's a bug. So the correct answer is F.

But wait, another idea: perhaps the correct answer is F: buffer checks.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: boundary checks.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of which of these are actions that prevent buffer overflow.

Buffer overflow is fixed by buffer checks. So if buffer checks aren't done, it's a bug. So the correct answer would be F.

So the answer is F: buffer checks.
</think>

Buffer overflow occurs when data is written without proper handling, such as not closing a buffer. The question asks which action, when not done fully, remains a bug. 

- **A: boundary hacks** involve manipulating file permissions, which could lead to buffer issues if not handled.
- **F: buffer checks** ensure buffer limits are respected, so not doing them causes a bug.
- **G: boundary checks** ensure data fits within buffer limits, so not doing them also causes a bug.
- **I: memory checks** are about data storage, not directly related to buffer overflow.
- **J: data backups** are unrelated to buffer handling.

The correct answers are **F, G, A, I, J**, but since the question requires selecting one letter, the most relevant options are **F: buffer checks** and **G: boundary checks**. However, the question focuses on preventing buffer overflow, making **F: buffer checks** the best answer.

Answer: F
