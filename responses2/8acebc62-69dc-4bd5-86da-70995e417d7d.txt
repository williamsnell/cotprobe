Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about equivalent expressions, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. 

The question is asking which pair of expressions is equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. I remember that equivalent expressions mean they have the same value no matter what the variable is, as long as it's positive, right? So I need to check each option and see if they're equal for any positive value.

Looking at the options, there are 12 possibilities from A to J. Let's go through each one.

Option A: 4n + 2o vs 8no. Hmm, 4n is 4 times n, 2o is 2 times o. The product 8no would be 8 * n * o. These don't look the same. For example, if n=1 and o=1, A would be 4+2=6, and B would be 8*1*1=8. Not equal. So A isn't equivalent.

Option B: 2j + 2j + k vs 4jk. Let me simplify the left side first. 2j + 2j is 4j, so 4j + k. The right side is 4j*k, which is 4jk. These aren't the same. For example, if j=1 and k=1, B would be 4+1=5, and D would be 4*1*1=4. Not equal. So B isn't equivalent.

Option C: 5h + 3i vs 15hi. Left side is 5h + 3i, which is a sum of two terms, each with h and i respectively. The right side is 15hi, which is a product. These can't be equal since they combine differently. For instance, h=1, i=1: C is 5+3=8, C is 15*1*1=15. So no match. C isn't equivalent.

Option D: 4d +2e vs 8d + e. Let's see. 4d is 4 times d, adding 2e. On the right side, 8d is 8 times d, and e is just e. These expressions have different coefficients for d and e. For example, d=1, e=1: D is 4+2=6, E is 8+1=9. Not equal. So D isn't equivalent.

Option E: s + s + 2t vs 2st. Simplify the left side: s + s is 2s, so 2s + 2t. The right side is 2s*t. Let me plug in numbers. Let s=1, t=1: 2*1 + 2*1=4. R.H.S. is 2*1*1=2. Not equal. Another example: s=2, t=3: LHS is 4 + 6=10; RHS is 2*2*3=12. Not equal. So E isn't equivalent.

Option F: f + f + f + g vs 3fg. Let's simplify the left side: f + f + f is 3f, plus g: 3f + g. The right side is 3*f*g. Let's test with f=1, g=1: LHS is 3+1=4, RHS is 3*1*1=3. Not equal. Another example: f=2, g=3: LHS is 6+3=9, RHS is 3*2*3=18. Not equal. So F isn't equivalent.

Option G: b + b +3c vs 2b +3c. Let's simplify the left side: b + b is 2b, so 2b +3c. The right side is 2b +3c. They look the same. Are they equivalent? Yes, because both sides are 2b + 3c. So G is a match.

Option H: p + q + q + r vs 2pqr. Left side: p + q + q + r = p + 2q + r. The right side is 2pqr, which is a product. These are different. For example, p=1, q=1, r=1: LHS is 1+2+1=4, RHS is 2*1*1*1=2. Not equal. So H isn't equivalent.

Option I: l + m + m vs 2lm. Simplify left side: l + m + m = l + 2m. The right side is 2l*m. Let's see. For example, l=1, m=1: LHS is 1+2=3, RHS is 2*1*1=2. Not equal. Another example: l=2, m=3: LHS is 2+6=8, RHS is 12. So I isn't equivalent.

Option J: 3(x+2) vs 3x +2. Let's expand 3(x+2) which is 3x +6. The right side is 3x +2, which is different. So J isn't equivalent.

Wait, but looking back at option F, f + f + f + g is 3f +g. And option G is 2b +3c. Are these the same? Let me check. Yes, both have two variables each, but G has 2b and 3c, F has 3f and g. So no, they are different. Only option G is equivalent.

The correct answer is G: b + b + 3c and 2b + 3c.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Option A**: 4n + 2o vs 8no. These expressions combine different terms and their product, so they are not equivalent.
2. **Option B**: 2j + 2j + k vs 4jk. Simplifying, 4j + k vs 4jk. Different structures, so not equivalent.
3. **Option C**: 5h + 3i vs 15hi. These combine differently, so not equivalent.
4. **Option D**: 4d +2e vs 8d + e. Different coefficients and structures, so not equivalent.
5. **Option E**: s + s + 2t vs 2st. Simplifies to 2s + 2t vs 2st. Different structures, not equivalent.
6. **Option F**: f + f + f + g vs 3fg. Simplifies to 3f + g vs 3fg. Different structures, not equivalent.
7. **Option G**: b + b +3c vs 2b +3c. Both simplify to 2b + 3c, so they are equivalent.
8. **Option H**: p + q + q + r vs 2pqr. Different structures, not equivalent.
9. **Option I**: l + m + m vs 2lm. Simplifies to l + 2m vs 2lm. Different structures, not equivalent.
10. **Option J**: 3(x+2) vs 3x +2. Expanding gives 3x +6, which is not equivalent to 3x +2.
