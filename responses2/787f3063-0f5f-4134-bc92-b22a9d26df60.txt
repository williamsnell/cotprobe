Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about moments of inertia. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a thin rod pivoted at one end. I remember that moments of inertia depend on the mass distribution relative to the pivot point. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let's think it through step by step.

So, the rod has a length l and mass m. It's pivoted at one end. I think the moment of inertia for a rod about one end is a standard result, but I'm not sure about the exact value. I recall something about it being (1/3)m l². But wait, I should make sure I'm getting the right formula.

Wait, another approach: I can derive it. The moment of inertia I is the integral of r² dm, where r is the distance from the pivot. For a thin rod, the mass per unit length is λ = m/l. So, I'd integrate from 0 to l of (r)^2 * λ dr.

So, substituting, λ is m/l, so I = ∫ from 0 to l (r²)(m/l) dr. Let's compute that integral. The integral of r² is (r³)/3. Evaluated from 0 to l gives (l³/3) * (m/l) )= m l² /3. So, that's I = (1/3) m l². Which is option A.

Wait, but wait, sometimes I get confused. I think sometimes people confuse the moment of inertia for a rod about its center. Oh yeah, the moment of inertia there is (1/12) m l², but that's about the center. But this question is about one end. So yes, the answer must be (1/3) m l². Looking back at the options, option A is that.

Alternatively, another way to remember is that for a thin rod, the moment of inertia about one end is indeed a third of what it would be about its center. Because the mass is spread out more towards the end, so the moment of inertia is higher. The center case is (1/12) m l², so (1/3) of that would be (1/3)(1/12) m l² = m l² /36? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, wait, no, the moment of inertia about the center is (1/12) m l². So, for one end, since the distance from each mass element is larger, the moment should be larger. So, the end's moment of inertia is 3 times that of the center. Because the center is (1/12) m l², so 3 times would be (1/4) m l². Wait, that would make I = (1/4)m l². But that contradicts my earlier calculation.

Wait, I'm getting confused now. Let me think again. Why am I getting two different results?

Hold on, I think I made a mistake in my earlier derivation. Let's re-do the integral.

The moment of inertia I is ∫ r² dm.

The rod has length l, so from 0 to l. The mass per unit length is λ = m/l. So, dm = λ dr = (m/l) dr. So, I becomes ∫ (r^2) * (m/l) dr from 0 to l.

So, I = (m/l) ∫ r² dr from 0 to l. The integral of r² is (1/3) r³. So, evaluated from 0 to l, it's (1/3) l³. Multiply by (m/l), so I = (m/l) * (1/3) l³ = (m l²) * (1/3) = (1/3) m l². So that's right. So the answer is A.

But wait, earlier I thought about the center being (1/12) m l². So, the end must be 3 times that. Because for the end, each mass element is at a distance r from the pivot, which is equal to the length of the rod. So, the moment of inertia would be I = ∫ r² dm = ∫ r² (m/l) dr. Wait, no, that's same as before. So if the center is at l/2, then the end is at l, so it's 3 times the center's moment.

Wait, that can't be right. Oh no, no, wait. The center's moment of inertia is (1/12) m l². The end's moment is (1/3) m l², which is indeed 3 times larger. Because (1/3) is three times (1/12) since 1/3 is 4 times 1/12? Wait, no, 1/3 is three times 1/12 is (1/12 *3) = 1/4. Wait, no, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, if the center is at (1/12) m l², then the end is at (1/3) m l². So, (1/3) is 4 times (1/12). Because 1/12 *4 =1/3. So yes, the end is four times the center's moment. So that makes sense because the rod's mass is further away from the pivot, so each mass element contributes more. So, the end's I is four times the center's I.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for the center, I is (1/12) m l², so for the end, it's 3 times that, but that's not correct? Because the center is (1/12) m l². So the end is (1/3) m l². Because (1/3) is 4 times (1/12). So, it's 4 times larger than the center. So, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think of another way. Imagine a rod of length l, mass m. The center is at l/2. So the moment of inertia there is I_center = ∫ (r)^2 dm, where r is from 0 to l/2? No, wait, no. The center is at l/2, so the distance from the pivot is r = x, where x runs from 0 to l.

Wait, no. The center is at l/2 from the pivot. The moment of inertia about the center is (1/12) m l². So, for the end, the distance is l. So, the moment of inertia for the end is ∫ (x)^2 dm, where x runs from 0 to l. So, the integral is over x from 0 to l. The integrand is x^2 (m/l) dx.

So, ∫ x² (m/l) dx from 0 to l is (m/l) * (l³/3) )= m l² /3.

So I = (1/3) m l². So, that's correct. So the answer is A.

So, the earlier confusion was because I thought about the center being (1/12) m l², but the end is 3 times that. Wait, no, 3 times (1/12) is 1/4. But that's not matching. So I must have made an error in that earlier thought.

Ah, no, wait, I think I confused something. Let me compute the center's moment of inertia correctly. The center is at l/2.

So, I_center = ∫ (x)^2 dm. x is from 0 to l. So, x = r, but in the center case, the pivot is at the center. Wait, no, the pivot is at the end. So, in this problem, the rod is pivoted at one end, so the center is at l/2, but the distance of each mass element is x, where x runs from 0 to l. So, the center is at x = l/2, but the moment of inertia about the center (x=0) is ∫ x^2 dm. Wait, no, I'm complicating it.

Wait, no, the moment of inertia about the center would be ∫ (r)^2 dm, where r is the distance from the pivot. For the center, the distance is l/2, but the moment of inertia for the center is ∫ (x)^2 dm, where x is from 0 to l. Wait no, that's not possible because the center is at x = l/2. Wait, no, the center is at x = l/2, but the moment of inertia about the center would be when the pivot is at the center. But in our problem, the pivot is at the end, so the moment of inertia about the end is (1/3) m l².

So, the answer is option A.

To calculate the moment of inertia of a thin rod of length \( l \) and mass \( m \) pivoted about one end, we use the definition of moment of inertia:

\[
I = \int r^2 \, dm
\]

Here, \( r \) is the distance from the pivot, and \( dm \) is the mass element. The rod has mass per unit length \( \lambda = \frac{m}{l} \), so \( dm = \lambda \, dr = \frac{m}{l} \, dr \). Substituting into the integral:

\[
I = \int_0^l r^2 \cdot \frac{m}{l} \, dr = \frac{m}{l} \int_0^l r^2 \, dr
\]

The integral of \( r^2 \) is \( \frac{r^3}{3} \), so:

\[
I = \frac{m}{l} \left[ \frac{r^3}{3} \right]_0^l = \frac{m}{l} \cdot \frac{l^3}{3} = \frac{m l^2}{3}
\]

Thus, the moment of inertia of the rod about one end is \( \frac{1}{3} m l^2 \).
