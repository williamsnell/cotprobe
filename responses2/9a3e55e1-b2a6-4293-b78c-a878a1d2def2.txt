Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about why people join a political party not based on their parents' choice. Let me break it down.

The question is asking why people typically join a political party other than the one their parents support. The options are peer pressure, economic issues, religious beliefs, or pressure from their employers. 

Hmm, I remember that political parties often have a social component because people come from different backgrounds and might feel they need to join a group that aligns with others. So, if someone's parents support a particular party, they might feel compelled to join it to join with their parents. Like, for example, if my parents are in a political party, I might join because I think it's the right group to support, even if I'm not from the same political stance.

Wait, but isn't there also an economic reason? Maybe people are drawn to other parties for affordable options. But the question is about why they join despite their parents' choice. Peer pressure seems more likely. I've heard stories where friends from a different party join because they feel it's the right thing to do based on their parents' influence.

Religious beliefs are another option. People might join a political party for religious reasons, but the question isn't about that. It's about political reasons. Pressures from employers don't immediately tie into political parties either. Employers might influence career choices, but not necessarily political party choices.

So, putting it together, peer pressure seems to be the main reason. They feel compelled to join because their friends or family are from a particular party, and they want to support that group even if they aren't from that political stance. That makes sense because political parties often have a social aspect, and people tend to align with groups that have support from others.

The correct answer is A: peer pressure. People join political parties other than their parents' choice because they feel compelled to align with groups that have support from friends or family, leading to social alignment and support despite their political differences.
