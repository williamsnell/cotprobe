Question:

Ms. Edwards' disposable income (that is, her income after taxes have been paid) has risen from $19,000 to $20,000. Her expenditures have risen from $15,200 to $15,950. 1) What is her marginal propensity to consume? 2) What is her marginal propensity to save?

Options:

A: Marginal propensity to consume is .70, marginal propensity to save is .30
B: Marginal propensity to consume is .80, marginal propensity to save is .20
C: Marginal propensity to consume is .95, marginal propensity to save is .05
D: Marginal propensity to consume is .85, marginal propensity to save is .15
E: Marginal propensity to consume is .75, marginal propensity to save is .25
F: Marginal propensity to consume is .50, marginal propensity to save is .50
G: Marginal propensity to consume is .55, marginal propensity to save is .45
H: Marginal propensity to consume is .60, marginal propensity to save is .40
I: Marginal propensity to consume is .65, marginal propensity to save is .35
J: Marginal propensity to consume is 1.00, marginal propensity to save is 0.00

Okay, so I have this question here about marginal propensities to consume and save. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that Ms. Edwards' disposable income has gone up from $19,000 to $20,000, and her expenditures went up from $15,200 to $15,950. I need to find her marginal propensities to consume and save. The options are A through J, each with different percentages.

Wait, marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the change in consumption divided by the change in income. Similarly, marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the change in saving divided by the change in income. But wait, I remember that MPC plus MPS should equal 1 because the person can either consume or save (assuming no taxes or other factors here since the question gives us disposable income after tax).

So first, let me calculate the change in income. Her income went from 19k to 20k, so that's an increase of $1k or 1000 dollars.

Now, consumption went from 15,200 to 15,950. So the change in consumption is 15950 - 15200 = 750 dollars.

Since MPC is change in C divided by change in Y, that would be 750 / 1000 = 0.75. So MPC is 0.75.

Now, since MPC + MPS = 1, MPS should be 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, if she saved 250 dollars, then her MPC is 750 and MPS is 250. That makes sense because 750 + 250 = 1000, which is her change in income.

Looking at the options, option E says MPC is 0.75 and MPS is 0.25. So that matches my calculation.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is listed as:

E: Marginal propensity to consume is 0.75, marginal propensity to save is 0.25.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be E.
</think>

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is calculated as the change in consumption divided by the change in disposable income. Here, consumption increased by $750 (from $15,200 to $15,950) over an increase of $1,000 in disposable income. Thus, MPC = $750 / $1,000 = 0.75. Since MPC + MPS = 1, MPS = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. Therefore, the correct option is E.

Answer: E
