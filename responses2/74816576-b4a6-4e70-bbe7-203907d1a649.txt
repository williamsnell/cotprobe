Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking about the positive square roots of 200 and 121. I need to find out how much larger the square root of 200 is compared to that of 121, and then express that increase as a percentage.

First, I remember that the square root of 121 is 11 because 11 times 11 is 121. So, sqrt(121) = 11. That's straightforward.

Now, for the square root of 200. Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but I can approximate it. I know that 14 squared is 196, which is less than 200. 14 times 14 is 196. So, sqrt(200) must be a little more than 14. Let me try 14.1 squared. 14.1 times 14.1: 14 squared is 196, 0.1 times 28 is 2.8, so 196 + 28 + (0.1^2) which is negligible. So, 14.1 squared is about 198.81, which is still less than 200. So, 14.1 squared is 198.81. So, 14.2 squared would be 14 squared is 196, plus 14*0.2*2 (the cross term) which is 5.6, and plus (0.2)^2 which is 0.04. So, 196 + 5.6 + 0.04 = 201.64. Wait, that's 14.2^2 = 201.64, which is more than 200. So, sqrt(200) is between 14.1 and 14.2.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Alternatively, since 14.14 squared is approximately equal to 200? Let me check. 14.14^2 = (14 + 0.14)^2 = 14^2 + 2*14*0.14 + 0.14^2. 14^2 is 196. 2*14*0.14 is 2*1.96 = 3.92. 0.14^2 is 0.0196. Adding them all: 196 + 3.92 = 199.92, plus 0.0196 is 200. So, 14.14^2 is exactly 200. So sqrt(200) is exactly 14.14. Oh, wait, that's a neat number. So, sqrt(200) is 14.14.

Wait, no. Wait, 14.14 squared is (14 + 0.14)^2 = 14² + 2*14*0.14 + 0.14². So 14² is 196, 2*14=28, 28 *0.14= 3.92. 0.14²=0.0196. So 196 +3.92=199.92, plus 0.0196 is 200. So sqrt(200) is exactly 14.14. Wait, that's right. Because 14.14 *14.14 = 200. So sqrt(200) is exactly 14.1421356... but approximately 14.14.

So the square root of 200 is approximately 14.14, and the square root of 121 is exactly 11.

Now, the question is: how much larger is sqrt(200) than sqrt(121) in percentage terms. So I need to calculate the percentage increase from 11 to 14.14.

The formula for percentage increase is: ((New Value - Original Value)/Original Value) *100.

So, New Value is 14.14, Original Value is 11.

So, (14.14 -11)/11 *100 = (3.14)/11 *100.

Calculating 3.14 divided by 11: 3.14 /11 is approximately 0.2854545...

Multiply by 100: 28.54545... percent.

The question asks to round to the nearest whole number. So 28.545... rounds to 29 percent.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 14, I is 29, etc. So the answer would be 29%, which is option I.

The positive square root of 200 is approximately 14.14, and the positive square root of 121 is exactly 11. To find how much larger 14.14 is than 11 as a percentage:

1. Calculate the difference: 14.14 - 11 = 3.14.
2. Divide by the original value (11): 3.14 / 11 = 0.28545.
3. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.28545 * 100 ≈ 28.545%.
4. Round to the nearest whole number: 29%.

Answer: I: 29
