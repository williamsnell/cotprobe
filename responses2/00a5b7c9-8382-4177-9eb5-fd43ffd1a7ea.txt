Okay, so I've got this question about carbon filaments and the wavelengths at which they emit the most energy. Hmm, I remember something about Wien's Law from my physics class. Let me think about this.

Wien's Law states that the wavelength (λ) at which the emission of a blackbody is strongest is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T) of the blackbody. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. I think the value of b is approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. Oh wait, wait, right, because sometimes the units are in meters and Kelvin. So that's the key here.

The question gives temperatures in Celsius, but Wien's Law uses Kelvin. So I need to convert each temperature from Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273.15. Let me list the temperatures again:

500°C: 500 + 273.15 = 773.15 K
1000°C: 1273.15 K
1500°C: 1773.15 K
2500°C: 2773.15 K

Now, I'll calculate λ_max for each temperature using the formula. Let's compute each one step by step.

Starting with 500°C (773.15 K):

λ_max = 2.898e-3 m·K / 773.15 K
Let me compute that. 2.898e-3 divided by 773.15.

Hmm, 2.898e-3 is 0.002898. Divided by 773.15.

Let me calculate that:

0.002898 / 773.15 ≈ 3.75e-6 meters. Wait, that's 3.75 micrometers (since 1e-6 m is a micrometer). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1e-6 m is 1 micrometer, so 3.75e-6 m is 3.75 micrometers (μm). Wait, but in the options, I see option G: 500C: 4.50μm, option F: 2.75μm, option H: 3.75μm.

Wait, so for 500°C, I calculated 3.75μm. Looking at the options, option H lists 3.75μm for 500C. But wait, looking at the choices, let's see. Oh, option H's 500C is 3.75μm. Let's check the other temperatures.

Next, 1000°C (1273.15 K):

λ_max = 2.898e-3 / 1273.15 ≈ 2.28e-6 m, which is 2.28 micrometers. Wait, but looking at the options, option G for 1000C is 2.28μm. Let me see the other options.

Wait, option G's 1000C is 2.28μm, which matches this calculation. So far, so good.

1500°C (1773 K):

λ_max = 2.898e-3 / 1773 ≈ about 1.63e-6 m or 1.63μm. Looking at the options, option G's 1500C is 1.63μm. But wait, option F's 1500C is 2.63μm, which doesn't match. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 2.898e-3 / 1773 = approx 0.002898 / 1773 ≈ 1.63e-6 m. So 1.63 micrometers. So option G's 1500C is 1.63μm, which would be correct. But looking at the options, option F's 1500C is 2.63μm. Wait, that's a big discrepancy. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation for 1500°C. Let me compute it again.

2.898e-3 m·K / 1773.15 K = (2.898 / 1773.15 )e-3 m.

2.898 / 1773.15 is approximately 0.001633. So that's 0.001633 e-3 m? Wait, no, wait, 2.898e-3 is 0.002898. Divided by 1773.15 gives 0.002898 / 1773.15 ≈ 1.63e-6 m, which is μm.

So 1.63 μm, which is option G's 1500C (1.63μm). So that's correct.

Next, 2500°C (2773.15 K):

λ_max = 2.898e-3 / 2773.15 ≈ (2.898 / 2773.15) e-3 m.

2.898 / 2773.15 ≈ 0.0010478, so 0.0010478e-3 m? Wait no, wait: 2.898e-3 divided by 2773 is ≈ 1.0478e-6 m, which is 1.05 μm. So 1.05 μm. Looking at the options, option H says 2500C: 1.05μm, which matches. So H is correct for 2500°C.

Wait, but option G for 2500C is 1.95μm, which is larger. So option H is correct.

So putting it all together:

500°C: 3.75μm (H)
1000°C: 2.28μm (G)
1500°C: 1.63μm (G)
2500°C: 1.05μm (H)

Wait, but looking at the options, each option lists four values for 500, 1000, 1500, 2500. Let me check each option's numbers.

Option F: 500:2.75, 1000:3.28, 1500:2.63, 2500:2.05. Doesn't match any of our calculations.

Option G:500:4.50 (no), 1000:3.50, 1500:2.95, 2500:1.95. Doesn't match.

Option H:500:3.75, 1000:2.28, 1500:1.63, 2500:1.05. So for 500, H says 3.75, which matches. 1000 is G's 2.28. 1500 matches G's 1.63. 2500 matches H's 1.05. So H is correct for all.

Looking at the options, option H is the one that lists all four correctly. So the correct answer is option H.

To determine the corresponding wavelengths at which the most energy is emitted by a carbon filament at different temperatures, we use Wien's Law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \( b \approx 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K} \) is Wien's displacement constant, and \( T \) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. The given temperatures are converted from Celsius to Kelvin by adding \( 273.15 \, \text{K} \). The calculations for each temperature are as follows:

1. **500°C (\( T = 773.15 \, \text{K} \)):**
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{773.15} \approx 3.75 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

2. **1000°C (\( T = 1273.15 \, \text{K} \)):**
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{1273.15} \approx 2.28 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

3. **1500°C (\( T = 1773.15 \, \text{K} \)):**
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{1773.15} \approx 1.63 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

4. **2500°C (\( T = 2773.15 \, \text{K} \)):**
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{2773.15} \approx 1.05 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

Now, comparing these results with the options provided, the correct values are:

- **500°C:** \( 3.75 \, \mu\text{m} \) (matches option H)
- **1000°C:** \( 2.28 \, \mu\text{m} \) (matches option G)
- **1500°C:** \( 1.63 \, \mu\text{m} \) (matches option G)
- **2500°C:** \( 1.05 \, \mu\text{m} \) (matches option H)

Thus, the correct option is **H**, as it aligns with all four calculated values.
