Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man selling novelty items. Let me read it again. He sells each for $1.25. His cost is $0.75 per item plus a fixed cost of $140,000. The question is asking how many items he needs to sell to break even and what his sales revenue would be at that point. The options are A through J, each with different numbers of units and corresponding revenue.

Hmm. Break-even point is when total revenue equals total cost. So I need to find the point where he's neither making a profit nor a loss. Let's think about the costs and revenues.

First, his cost per unit is $0.75, which includes the variable cost. But wait, is that the variable cost or fixed? Oh, the problem says his cost is $0.75 apiece plus a fixed cost of $140,000. So each item's cost is $0.75, and he has fixed costs regardless of how many items he sells, which is $140,000.

So, the total cost (TC) would be the fixed cost plus the variable cost (number of items sold times the variable cost per item). So TC = 140,000 + 0.75 * x, where x is the number of items sold.

The total revenue (TR) is the selling price per item times the number of items sold. So TR = 1.25 * x.

At break-even, TR equals TC. So, setting them equal:

1.25x = 140,000 + 0.75x.

Let me solve for x. Subtract 0.75x from both sides:

1.25x - 0.75x = 140,000.

That gives 0.5x = 140,000.

So x = 140,000 / 0.5 = 280,000 units. 

Wait, so the break-even point is 280,000 units. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option H says 280,000 units and $350,000. Let's see what the revenue is at that point. TR = 1.25 * 280,000.

Calculating 280,000 * 1.25: 280k * 1 = 280k, 280k * 0.25 = 70k. So total is 350k. That matches option H. So option H is 280,000 units and $350,000.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I do the break-even correctly?

Yes, because break-even is when total revenue equals total cost. The cost is fixed plus variable. So the equation is correct. 

Alternatively, sometimes people get confused between fixed and variable costs. But in this case, the $0.75 is probably the variable cost per unit. So yes, the calculation seems right.

The break-even point is calculated by setting total revenue equal to total cost. Total revenue (TR) is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold, while total cost (TC) includes fixed costs and variable costs. Solving 1.25x = 140,000 + 0.75x gives x = 280,000 units. At this point, TR = 1.25 * 280,000 = $350,000. Thus, the correct answer is option H.

Answer: H: 280,000 units and $350,000
