Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to maximize the entropy H(X) of a non-negative integer-valued random variable X. The values X can take are from 0 to infinity, and I have the constraint that the expected value E(X) is 1. The entropy is calculated using base 2 logarithm, so I should be careful about the units here. 

Hmm, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness. To maximize it, I think I should consider using a distribution that spreads out the probability mass as evenly as possible. But wait, since X has to be an integer and the expectation is 1, I can't just have all the probability at one point because that would make the expectation either 0 or infinity, depending on where it's concentrated. 

What's the maximum entropy distribution under the expectation constraint? I remember that for continuous variables, the maximum entropy distribution is the exponential distribution, but here it's discrete. Oh right, the maximum entropy distribution for an integer variable is a geometric distribution. Or wait, maybe it's the uniform distribution? No, wait, the uniform distribution would have all possible values with equal probability, but that might not maximize entropy given the expectation constraint. 

Wait, another thought: The uniform distribution on integers isn't possible because the probabilities would have to add up to 1, but if X can take any integer from 0 to infinity, the sum would diverge, which isn't possible. So that's out. 

So perhaps I need to find a distribution where the values are as small as possible, but their sum times their probabilities equals 1. Since each X is integer ≥0, the minimal values would be 0,1,2,… but wait, because E(X)=1, I need the average to be 1. If I have X=0, it doesn't contribute to the expectation. So maybe the maximum entropy distribution would assign probabilities to 0,1,2,... in such a way that the sum of probabilities times their values is 1, and the entropy is maximized.

Wait, but X is non-negative integer-valued, so the possible values are 0,1,2,... So E(X) = sum_{k=0}^∞ k P(X=k) = 1.

To maximize entropy, I think the distribution should be such that the probabilities are as spread out as possible. So perhaps the maximum happens when X takes the minimal possible values with the highest possible probabilities. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the distribution with the maximum entropy under the constraint is a geometric distribution.

Wait, maximum entropy for a discrete distribution with a fixed expectation can be achieved by a geometric distribution. Let's think: suppose the variable X can take values 1,2,3,... with probabilities P(X=k) = (1 - p) p^{k-1}, where p is the probability of success. Then, E(X) would be 1/p. Since E(X)=1, p=1. Hmm, but that would make P(X=1)=0, which isn't possible. Wait, maybe I got the distribution wrong. Or perhaps it's a different form.

Alternatively, maybe the distribution is a shifted geometric distribution. Let's see. Suppose that the possible values are 1,2,... so X can't be 0. Then, the probability P(X=k) = (1 - p) p^{k}, for k=1,2,3,... Then, E(X) would be sum_{k=1}^∞ k (1-p) p^k. Hmm, what's that sum? I think that's p/(1-p)^2. Setting that equal to 1: p/(1-p)^2 = 1 → p = (1-p)^2 → p = 1-2p + p^2 → p^2 -3p +1=0 → p = [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2. The positive solution is (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3+2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618, which is more than 1, which can't be a probability. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a different structure. Suppose I have P(X=k) for k ≥1, with E(X) = 1. The entropy is H = -sum_{k=1}^∞ P(k) log P(k). To maximize this, the distribution should be as uniform as possible, but subject to the expectation constraint.

Wait, another approach: the maximum entropy distribution under the constraint E(X) = 1 would be the one where the distribution is uniform over as many points as possible. But since the expectation is finite, it's not possible to have an infinite number. Maybe the maximum occurs when X takes on the smallest possible values with the highest probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the maximum entropy is achieved when X takes on the values 1,2,3,... with probabilities P(k) = c/(k^2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the entropy would be maximized when the distribution is the uniform distribution over the minimal possible support. But that doesn't fit with the expectation constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum entropy occurs when the variable takes on the values 0,1,2,… with probabilities P(0)=p, P(1)=q, P(2)=r, etc., such that sum P(k) = 1 and sum k P(k) =1.

Wait, but to maximize entropy, we want to spread the probability as much as possible. So perhaps the maximum occurs when the distribution is as uniform as possible, i.e., each P(k) is 1/(k), but that seems problematic because the sum would diverge. Because sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k diverges.

Wait, that's not possible because the probabilities must sum to 1. So perhaps we can't have a uniform distribution. So I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the maximum entropy distribution is the one which has the minimal possible support, but that's not possible because the expectation has to be 1. For instance, if X can take values only at 0 and 1, then the expectation is P(1)*1 =1 → P(1)=1. But then X can't take higher values because the expectation would be 1. So that's not possible because the expectation is 1, but X would have to take 1 with probability 1, but that leaves no room for higher values, but perhaps that's the case where X=1 almost surely, but then what's the entropy? H(X) would be -1 * log(1) = 0, which is not maximum. So that's worse than other distributions.

Wait, perhaps the maximum occurs when X takes on the minimal possible values, but more spread out. For example, perhaps X takes values 0,1,2,… with probabilities P(0)=p, P(1)=q, P(2)=r, etc., such that sum P(k) =1 and sum k P(k)=1.

Wait, but how do I find these probabilities? Maybe I can set up the Lagrangian for the optimization problem.

The problem is to maximize H(X) = -sum_{k=0}^\infty P(k) log P(k), subject to the constraints sum_{k=0}^\infty P(k) = 1 and sum_{k=0}^\infty k P(k) =1.

In the Lagrangian method, we introduce two multipliers: one for the first constraint (sum P(k) =1) and another for the second constraint (sum k P(k) =1). So the Lagrangian is:

L = -sum P(k) log P(k) + λ (sum P(k) -1) + μ (sum k P(k) -1)

To find the maximum, we take the derivative of L with respect to each P(k) and set it to zero.

So dL/dP(k) = - log P(k) -1 + λ + μ k = 0.

This gives the equation:

log P(k) = -1 + λ + μ k → P(k) = e^{-1 + λ + μ k}.

We can write this as P(k) = A e^{μ k}, where A = e^{-1 + λ}.

So P(k) = A e^{μ k}.

Now, the sum over all P(k) must equal 1:

sum_{k=0}^\infty A e^{μ k} }=1.

This is a geometric series, sum_{k=0}^\infty A (e^μ)^k.

The sum is A/(1 - e^μ) ), assuming e^μ <1, i.e., μ <0.

So A = (1 - e^μ)/(e^μ).

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The sum S = A * sum_{k=0}^\infty (e^μ)^k = A * [1/(1 - e^μ)].

We have S=1, so A/(1 - e^μ) ) =1 → A = 1 - e^μ.

So P(k) = (1 - e^μ) e^{μ k}.

Now, the other constraint is sum_{k=0}^\infty k P(k) =1.

Let's compute sum_{k=0}^\infty k P(k) = sum_{k=0}^\infty k (1 - e^μ) e^{μ k}.

Factor out (1 - e^μ), so it's (1 - e^μ) sum_{k=0}^\infty k e^{μ k}.

The sum sum_{k=0}^\infty k x^k = x/(1-x)^2, for |x| <1.

So in our case, x = e^{μ}.

Thus, sum becomes e^{μ} / (1 - e^{μ})^2.

So the entire expression is (1 - e^μ) * [e^{μ}/(1 - e^μ)^2 ) ] = e^{μ}/(1 - e^μ).

Set this equal to 1:

e^{μ}/(1 - e^μ) =1 → e^{μ} = 1 - e^{μ} → 2 e^{μ} =1 → e^{μ} = 1/2 → μ = ln(1/2) = -ln2.

So μ = -ln2.

Now, compute A.

A = 1 - e^μ = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So P(k) = (1/2) e^{μ k} = (1/2) e^{-ln2 *k} = (1/2) (e^{ln2})^{-k} = (1/2) 2^{-k} = 2^{-(k+1)}.

So P(k) = 2^{-(k+1)} for k=0,1,2,...

Wait, for k=0: P(0) = 2^{-1} = 1/2.

k=1: 2^{-2}=1/4.

k=2: 2^{-3}=1/8.

And so on.

So let's check the sum of P(k):

sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^{-(k+1)} = (1/2) sum_{k=0}^\infty 1/2^k ) = (1/2) * (1/(1 - 1/2)) ) = (1/2) * 2 =1. Correct.

Now, check the expectation E(X) = sum_{k=0}^\infty k P(k).

Compute sum_{k=0}^\infty k (1/2^{k+1}) )

= (1/2) sum_{k=0}^\infty k 2^{-k}.

We know that sum_{k=0}^\infty k x^{k} = x/(1 -x)^2.

Here, x=1/2.

So sum_{k=0}^\infty k (1/2)^k = (1/2)/(1 - 1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/4) = 2.

Multiply by 1/2: (1/2)*2 =1. Correct. So E(X)=1.

Great, so the probabilities are P(k) = 2^{-(k+1)} for k=0,1,2,...

Now, compute the entropy H(X) = - sum P(k) log2 P(k).

So H(X) = - sum_{k=0}^\infty [2^{-(k+1)}] log2 [2^{-(k+1)}].

Simplify each term:

Each term is 2^{-(k+1)} * log2 (2^{-(k+1)}) ) = 2^{-(k+1)} * [ -(k+1)*1 ].

Wait wait, because log2(2^{-(k+1)}) ) = -(k+1).

So H(X) becomes:

H(X) = - sum_{k=0}^\infty [ 2^{-(k+1)} * (- (k+1) ) ]

The negative sign comes in front, and the negative of that would flip the sign.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Each term is:

- P(k) * log2 P(k) = - [2^{-(k+1)} ] * [log2 (2^{-(k+1)} ) ]

= - [2^{-(k+1)} ] * [ -(k+1) ] 

= (k+1) * 2^{-(k+1)}.

So H(X) is the sum from k=0 to ∞ of (k+1) * 2^{-(k+1)}.

Let me make a change variable: let m = k+1. So when k=0, m=1; k=1, m=2; etc. So sum becomes sum_{m=1}^\infty m * 2^{-m}.

Wait, I know that sum_{m=1}^\infty m x^{m} = x/(1 -x)^2 for |x| <1.

Here x=1/2.

So sum_{m=1}^\infty m (1/2)^m = (1/2) / (1 - 1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/4) ) = 2.

So H(X) = sum_{m=1}^\infty m (1/2)^m = 2.

Wait, because each term is (k+1) * 2^{-(k+1)}, and the sum is 2.

So H(X) = 2 bits.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.0. So the answer should be B.

To maximize the entropy \( H(X) \) of a non-negative integer-valued random variable \( X \) with \( E(X) = 1 \), we consider the constraints \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty P(k) = 1 \) and \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty k P(k) = 1 \). The entropy is given by \( H(X) = -\sum_{k=0}^\infty P(k) \log_2 P(k) \), and we aim to maximize it under the given constraints.

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we derive the probability distribution \( P(k) = 2^{-(k+1)} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \dots \). This distribution satisfies both constraints and maximizes the entropy. Substituting \( P(k) \) into the entropy formula:

\[
H(X) = -\sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^{-(k+1)} \log_2 2^{-(k+1)}.
\]

Simplifying each term:

\[
-\sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^{-(k+1)} \log_2 2^{-(k+1)} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^{-(k+1)} (k+1).
\]

Letting \( m = k+1 \), the sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{m=1}^\infty m \cdot 2^{-m}.
\]

Using the known result \( \sum_{m=1}^\infty m x^m = \frac{x}{(1-x)^2} \) for \( |x| < 1 \), with \( x = 1/2 \):

\[
\sum_{m=1}^\infty m \cdot 2^{-m} = \frac{1/2}{(1-1/2)^2} = 2.
\]

Thus, the entropy is \( H(X) = 2 \) bits.

The correct answer is:
