Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the net price after applying a trade discount. Let me see if I can figure this out. The question says that Herbie'sService Station bought a water pump with a list price of $40 and a trade discount of $16. They want to find the net price.

Hmm, I remember that the net price is calculated by subtracting the trade discount from the list price. Wait, but sometimes there are multiple discounts, but in this case, it's just one. So, I think it's straightforward subtraction.

So the list price is $40, and the discount is $16. Let me do the math: 40 minus 16 equals... 24. So the net price should be $24.

Looking at the options, option E is $24, which matches my calculation. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a simple subtraction, so I'm confident the answer is E.

The net price is calculated by subtracting the trade discount from the list price. 

List price = $40.

Trade discount = $16.

Net price = List price - Trade discount = $40 - $16 = $24.

The correct answer is E: $24.

Answer:
E: $24
