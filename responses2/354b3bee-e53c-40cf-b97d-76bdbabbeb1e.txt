Alright, I need to figure out which singer appeared in the 1992 baseball film "A League of Their Own." Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that "A League of Their Own" is a play by Tom Stabell, based on a novel by John Greenleaf Whittier. It's a popular film that's been shown on multiple home runs and has a historical connection to baseball. The main characters are baseball players, so the singer in question is likely a baseball player.

Now, looking at the options provided: A is Whitney Houston, B is Madonna, C is Mariah Carey, D is Celine Dion, E Janet Jackson, F is Prince, G Britney Spears, H Garth Brooks, I Michael Jackson, J is Brandy.

Wait, I think I remember that Garth Brooks was in the film. He plays the manager for the Texas Rangers. Alternatively, I should double-check if any other options are correct.

Let me think about the film's duration. Considering it's 1992, the movie should be around 45 minutes. I recall that Garth Brooks was there, as he played a key character. Alternatively, Michael Jackson was in "A Day with Dave" but not in this one.

Wait, another thought: another character in the film is Celine Dion, but she's more of a singer and also a former baseball player. But was she in this specific film? I'm not sure. I think Mariah Carey was in "A Day with Dave," but not here.

Wait, no, Mariah Carey was in another film called "The Honeymooners," which I don't think is this one. Alternatively, Celine Dion was in "The Honeymooners" as well, but I think she's not in this film. Alternatively, perhaps Garth Brooks is correct.

Wait, wait, another angle. I think the film is titled "A League of Their Own," and Garth Brooks was there. So the answer should be H, Garth Brooks.

Alternatively, maybe another option. Let me think again. Oh, I think I might have mixed up some details. Another possibility is that Michael Jackson was in "The Honeymooners," but that's not the same as "A League of Their Own." So I'm leaning towards Garth Brooks being the correct answer.
