Okay, so I've got this question about the distance between two carbon atoms in a unit cell. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's think this through. The question gives me a value of a as 4.5°A, and asks for the distance between two Cs atoms. 

Wait, I'm remembering that in a rock-salt (NaCl) structure, each unit cell has a certain arrangement of ions. For Cs, which is a halogen, I think it's a different structure. Oh right, Cs has a body-centered cubic structure. So each unit cell for Cs would have Cs atoms at the corners and one in the center.

But wait, in a body-centered structure, each corner atom is shared among eight adjacent unit cells. So the formula for the number of atoms per unit cell for Cs would be (8 corners * 1/8) + 1 (center) = 1 atom per unit cell. Oh, that's different from NaCl, which is a face-centered cubic structure with 4 atoms per unit cell.

Wait, but the question is about the distance between two Cs atoms. So maybe it's considering the distance between adjacent ions in the structure. Because in a body-centered structure, the Cs are arranged in a way where each corner is a Cs atom, and the center is another. So the Cs are in a face-centered cubic arrangement. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit cell is a simple cubic structure? No, that's probably not right for Cs. Cs is a larger atom than Na, so the structure must be different.

Wait, in a rock-salt structure, which is NaCl, each Na+ is surrounded by Cl- and vice versa. The unit cell is face-centered cubic, so each corner has Cl- and one in the center. So the distance between adjacent ions is a/√2, I think. Because the face diagonal is a√2, and half of that is a/√2. So the distance between Na and Cl in the face-centered cubic would be a/√2.

But wait, the question is about two Cs atoms. Are they in the same cell? Or is the unit cell a different structure? Oh, perhaps the unit cell is a body-centered cubic structure for the Cs. Wait, in a BCC structure, each atom is at the corners and the center. So the Cs are at the corners and one in the center. So the distance between adjacent Cs would be the distance between a corner atom and the center atom, which is a/√3. Because the body diagonal is a√3, so half is a√3/2, which is a/(√3).

Wait, but that depends on how the structure is arranged. If the Cs are at the corners and one in the center, their positions are such that the distance between a corner and the center is a/(√3). So the unit cell has Cs at all corners and one in the center. So the Cs atoms are each at a corner and the center. The distance between an adjacent corner and the center would be a/(√3).

So the unit cell for Cs would have (8*1/8 +1) = 1 atom per unit cell. So the Cs are at positions (0,0,0) and (a/2, a/2, a/2). The distance between these two points is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 ) = sqrt(3*(a²/4)) = a√3 / 2. Which is the same as (a/2)*√3. So that's a/√3 multiplied by 2, because a√3/2 is (a/2)*√3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The body diagonal of a cube is a√3. So if each corner is a Cs atom, and the center is another, the distance from a corner to the center would be half the body diagonal. So (a√3)/2 = a*(√3)/2. But maybe I should re-express it as a/(√3) multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it correctly. Let's consider two Cs atoms in adjacent corners of a cube. The cube has edge length a. The distance between any two adjacent corners (edge length) is a. The distance between a corner and the center is the space diagonal divided by 2. The space diagonal is a√3, so half of that is a√3 / 2. So the distance would be (a√3)/2.

Wait, but in a BCC structure, the distance between a corner atom and the center atom is a√3 / 2. So that's the distance between two Cs atoms if one is at a corner and the other at the center. So the distance is (a√3)/2.

But the question gives a as 4.5°A. So substitute that in.

So a =4.5 A.

So (4.5 * √3)/2.

What's that numerically? Let's calculate. √3 is about 1.732.

So 4.5 * 1.732 = about 7.794.

Divide by 2: 7.794 / 2 ≈ 3.897.

Wait, but the options don't have a 3.897. Let me look at the options.

Options are: A:5, B:2.25, C:6.5, D:7, E:7.790, F:10, G:4.5, H:3.6, I:8.5, J:9.5.

Wait, option E is 7.790. Oh, that's close to our calculation of about 3.897. Wait, no, 3.897 is about 3.9. But the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the structure assumption.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the unit cell is a simple cubic structure, but that’s probably not for Cs. Cs is a larger atom, so it's more likely in a BCC structure.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused. Because in the BCC structure, the Cs are at the corners and the center. So the distance between adjacent Cs would be the distance between a corner atom and the center atom, which is a√3/2.

Wait, but wait, the question says "the distance between two Cs atoms in a unit cell". So the two Cs could be adjacent, but in the BCC structure, each Cs is at a corner and the center. So, their positions are at (0,0,0) and (a/2, a/2, a/2). The distance between them is sqrt( (a/2)^2 * 3 ) = (a√3)/2.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them exactly match (4.5 * 1.732)/2. Let me compute that precisely. 4.5 * 1.732 is approximately 7.794. Divided by 2 is about 3.897.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is E:7.790. That's about 7.79, which is twice as big as our calculation. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing the structure. Let me think again. For a BCC structure, the atoms are at the corners and the center. The distance between any two corners is a, but the distance between a corner and the center is a/√3, because the center is at the cube's center, so the distance from a corner (which is at (0,0,0)) to (a/2, a/2, a/2) would be sqrt( (a/2)^2 *3 ) = a*sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let me think in terms of a unit cell. Let me imagine a cube with edge length a. The center is at (a/2, a/2, a/2). The distance from (0,0,0) to that point is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 ) = a*sqrt( (1/4)+(1/4)+(1/4) )= a*sqrt(3/4) = a*(√3)/2.

So the distance is (a√3)/2. So with a=4.5 A,

(4.5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ (7.794)/2 ≈ 3.897 A.

So the options don't have that. The closest option is E:7.790, which is about double that. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the unit cell is not BCC. Maybe it's a different structure. Wait, another thought: for NaCl structure, each unit cell has 4 ions, with Na+ and Cl- alternating. The distance between Na and Cl is a/√2, because the face diagonal is a√2, and the distance is half that. So between Na and Cl in face-centered cubic structure, the distance is a/(√2) = 4.5 A /1.414 ≈ 3.18 A. That's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, maybe the Cs are not in a BCC structure. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the unit cell is a simple cubic (like Na), but that's unlikely for Cs since it's a larger atom, but perhaps in a body-centered cubic structure, the Cs are arranged in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the two Cs are adjacent in a BCC structure. So if the unit cell edge is a, then in a BCC structure, the Cs are at the corners and center. So the distance between any two adjacent Cs would be the distance between the corner and the center along an edge. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Cs are at the corners and the center. So the Cs at adjacent corners are a distance of a apart. But the distance between a corner and the center is a√3/2, as we calculated.

Wait, but the question asks for the distance between two Cs atoms. Depending on whether they are adjacent or not, the distance can differ.

Wait, perhaps the two Cs are at adjacent corners, so their distance would be a, which is 4.5 A. But that's not an option either.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.25 A. Hmm, that's half of 4.5. Not sure why. Alternatively, maybe the unit cell is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the unit cell is a rhombohedral structure. Wait, but I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is about a face-centered cubic structure, but for Na. Let me think. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the unit cell is a face-centered cubic (BCC) structure for the Cs, but two Cs are in contact. So the distance between them would be a√3/2. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the structure. Maybe the unit cell is a simple cubic, but that's not likely for large atoms. Or maybe the Cs are in a body-centered cubic, but perhaps the question considers a different arrangement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the unit cell is a simple cubic, and the Cs are at the body diagonal. So the distance between two Cs would be the space diagonal of the cube. So the space diagonal is a√3. Then the distance would be a√3. But that's 4.5 * 1.732 = ~7.794, which is option E. Oh wait, that's exactly what option E is. 7.790 is approximately 7.794, which is a√3.

Wait, but that would suggest that the two Cs are at the opposite corners of the cube, but in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at a corner and the center is another atom. Hmm, but the space diagonal would be a√3, the distance between two opposite corners. But in a simple cubic structure, each corner has an atom, and the center has another. So if two Cs are at opposite corners, the distance would be a√3. But that's 7.790 A for a=4.5. So option E would be the correct choice.

Wait, that makes sense. So perhaps the structure is a simple cubic. So the unit cell is a cube with edge length a. The Cs are at the corners and the center. So the distance between two Cs at opposite corners is a√3.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, each corner is a separate atom. So the center is another atom. So for two Cs, if they are at opposite corners, the distance is a√3. So the unit cell has a Cs at each corner and one in the center. The distance between any two opposite corners is a√3.

So then, substituting a=4.5, we get 4.5 * 1.732= ~7.794 A. So option E is 7.790, which is very close, and option B is 2.25, which is half of 4.5. Hmm, but 2.25 A is much smaller than a. So that would correspond to a simple cubic unit cell, but with a=2.25, which is half of 4.5. But in that case, the edge length would be 2.25 A.

Wait, but the question gives a as 4.5 A. So if they're considering two opposite Cs, their distance is a√3. So 4.5 * √3 ≈ 7.794 A. So that would fit option E.

So the answer would be E, 7.790 A.

To determine the distance between two Cs atoms in a unit cell, we consider the structure of the Cs atom. Cs forms a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, where each corner of the cube contains a Cs atom, and one atom is at the center of the cube. The Cs atoms are at positions (0,0,0) and (a/2, a/2, a/2), where \( a \) is the edge length of the cube. The distance between these two atoms is half of the space diagonal of the cube.

The space diagonal of a cube is given by \( a\sqrt{3} \), so the distance between two Cs atoms is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Substituting \( a = 4.5 \, \text{A} \):

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{4.5 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \frac{4.5 \cdot 1.732}{2} \approx \frac{7.794}{2} \approx 3.897 \, \text{A}
\]

However, this value (approximately 3.897 A) does not match any of the provided options. Upon re-evaluating the structure, it is noted that the question might involve a different arrangement of Cs atoms, such as being at the corners and the center of a cube. In this case, the distance between two Cs atoms at opposite corners is the edge length of the cube, \( a \), which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = a = 4.5 \, \text{A}
\]

This does not match the options either. Another possibility is that the unit cell is a simple cubic structure, where the Cs atoms are at the corners, and the center is another atom. In this case, the distance between two Cs atoms at opposite corners is the space diagonal of the cube:

\[
\text{Distance} = a\sqrt{3}
\]

Substituting \( a = 4.5 \, \text{A} \):

\[
\text{Distance} = 4.5 \cdot \sqrt{3} \approx 4.5 \cdot 1.732 \approx 7.794 \, \text{A}
\]

This value closely matches option E (\( 7.790 \, \text{A} \)). Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the unit cell is a simple cubic structure, and the distance between two Cs atoms at opposite corners is \( a\sqrt{3} \).
