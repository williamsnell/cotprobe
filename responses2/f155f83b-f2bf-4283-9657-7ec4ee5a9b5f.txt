Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the cost of on-the-job training per employee. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that Judith Franklyn Corporation offered training to 1,240 employees. The expenses are given, and I need to find the cost per employee. So, I think I need to sum up all the expenses and then divide by the number of employees.

Looking at the expenses: part-time instruction is $114,770. Janitorial services are $6,080. Books are $12,370. Supplies are $4,160. Miscellaneous is $6,150. And there's a misc $6,150. Wait, I think I misread that. Or wait, maybe the misc is another amount. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote: part-time instruction $114,770 janitorial services $6,080 books $12,370 supplies $4,160 miscellaneous $6,150. Oh, so the misc is $6,150. So all the expenses are those numbers.

So, the total expense would be the sum of all these amounts. Let me add them one by one.

Start with part-time instruction: 114,770.

Then add janitorial: 114,770 + 6,080 = 120,850.

Then books: 120,850 + 12,370 = 133,220.

Then supplies: 133,220 + 4,160 = 137,380.

Miscellaneous: 137,380 + 6,150 = 143,530.

Wait wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't add wrong.

Wait, 114,770 + 6,080 is 120,850. Then add 12,370: 120,850 + 12,370. Let's see, 120,850 +12,000 is 132,850. Then +370 is 133,220.

Then 133,220 +4,160: 133,220 +4,000 is 137,220, plus 160 is 137,380.

Then 137,380 +6,150: 137,380 +6,000 is 143,380, plus 150 is 143,530. So the total expense is $143,530.

Wait, but the question asks for the cost per employee. So I need to divide this total by the number of employees, which is 1,240.

So 143,530 divided by 1,240. Let me compute that.

I'll do the division step by step. Let's see, 1,240 goes into 143,530 how many times?

First, 1,240 * 100 = 124,000. So 100 times is 124k.

Subtracting 124,000 from 143,530 gives 19,530.

Now, how many times does 1,240 go into 19,530?

Well, 1,240 *15 is 18,600. Because 1,240 *10 =12,400; 1,240*5=6,200; 12,400+6,200=18,600.

Subtracting that from 19,530: 19,530 -18,600 = 930.

So that's another 15, making it 115. So 15 times with a remainder of 930.

So total is 100 +15=115, with a remainder of 930.

Wait, but 115 times 1,240 is 115*1,240. Let me compute that:

1,240 *100 =124,000
1,240 *15=18,600
Total 142,600. Wait, but 124,000 +18,600 is 142,600. But our total is 143,530. So 143,530-142,600=930.

So 115 times is 142,600, and 115.75 times would be 142,600 + 930=143,530.

Wait, but 1,240 *115 is 142,600. So 115.75 times would be 143,530.

Wait, but this might be getting too detailed. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 143,530 ÷1,240.

Let me compute 143,530 ÷ 1,240.

Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 10 first: 14,353 ÷ 124.

Now, 124 × 115 is 14,140 (since 124*100=12,400. 124*15=1,860. 12,400+1,860=14,260. Hmm, wait, 124 ×115: 115 = 100+15.

124 *100=12,400; 124 *15=1,860. So total 12,400+1,860=14,260.

Wait, 124 x 115 =14,260. But the numerator is 14,353. So 14,353 -14,260=93.

So 115 times with a remainder of 93.

So, 115 + (93/124) =115.75.

Because 93/124 = 0.75. Because 124 × 0.75 = 93.

Wait, 124 × 0.75 is 93. So 93/124 = 0.75. Therefore, 143,530 ÷1,240 is 115.75.

Wait, so the cost per employee is $115.75.

Looking at the options, option I is $115.75. So the answer should be I.

The total expenses for the on-the-job training are calculated by summing all the given amounts: $114,770 (part-time instruction) + $6,080 (janitorial services) + $12,370 (books) + $4,160 (supplies) + $6,150 (miscellaneous) + $6,150 (supplies again, but that's a typo correction, but let's proceed). The correct total is $143,530. Dividing this by the number of employees (1,240) gives $115.75 per employee.

ANSWER: I: $115.75
