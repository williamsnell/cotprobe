Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables X₀, X₁, X₂, and so on, each taking values from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}. We're supposed to find the expected waiting time N for the next occurrence of X₀. Then, we need to compute E(N), the expected value of N, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, wait a second. N is the waiting time to the next occurrence of X₀. So, what does that mean? I think this is related to the concept of waiting times in probability, maybe like the expected number of trials until a certain event happens again.

Let me think. Since the X's are i.i.d., each has the same probability distribution. So, the probability that X_n equals X₀ for any n is p, which is the probability that X₀ takes a particular value. Let's say p is the probability that X₀ is, say, 5. Then, each subsequent X_n has a probability p of being equal to X₀. 

Wait, but since we're waiting for the next occurrence, it's like a geometric distribution problem. The geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to get the first success. In each trial, the probability of success is p. The expected value of a geometric distribution is 1/p. So, if N is the number of trials until the next occurrence, then E(N) is 1/p.

But wait, does this apply here? Because each X_n is an independent trial, and each has the same probability p of being equal to X₀. So yeah, it's a geometric distribution with parameter p. The expectation is 1/p.

But wait a second, X can take values from 1 to 100, so p is the probability that any X_i equals X₀. Since each X_i is drawn from p(x), which is uniform over 1-100, each X_i has a 1/100 chance of being any particular value, including X₀'s value.

Wait, but if X₀ is a specific value, say, 5, then the probability that X_n equals 5 for any n is 1/100. So p is 1/100. Therefore, E(N) would be 1/(1/100) = 100. So, that would be option H: 100.0.

But wait, wait. Another thought: Is the waiting time N the number of trials until the next occurrence, including the current one? Or is it the next occurrence after the current one?

Let me clarify. If X₀ is the current value, the next occurrence of X₀ would be the next time X_n equals X₀. So, N is the number of trials (including the next one) until the next success. So, in that case, yes, it's a geometric distribution, and E(N) = 1/p.

But wait, given that p is 1/100, E(N) is 100. So the correct answer should be H: 100.0.

Wait, but let me think again because sometimes I get confused between the definitions. For example, if I have a geometric distribution modeling the number of trials until the first success, starting from trial 1, then the expectation is 1/p. So in this case, each X_n represents a trial. So for each n >=1, the probability that X_n equals X₀ (which is p) is 1/100. So, the waiting time N is the first n where X_n equals X₀. So, the expectation E(N) is 1/(1/100) = 100.

But let me think of a small example. Suppose we're dealing with p=1/2, so each trial has p=0.5. Then, the expected waiting time is 2. That makes sense because on average, you'd expect to wait one trial for the first success, two for the second, etc. So yes, E(N)=2.

So applying that here, E(N)=100.

Let me check the options again. Option H is 100.0. So that should be the correct answer.

The problem involves finding the expected waiting time N for the next occurrence of X₀, given that X₀, X₁, X₂, etc., are i.i.d. random variables taking values from 1 to 100. Since each trial has a probability p=1/100 of matching X₀, the waiting time N follows a geometric distribution with expectation 1/p = 100.0.
