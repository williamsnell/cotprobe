Okay, so I've got this question here: "Phoebe Dione and Helene are moons of what planet?" The options are Saturn, Pluto, Neptune, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury, Sun, Jupiter, Uranus. I need to figure this out.

Hmm, I remember that Phoebe and Dione are moons. Wait, I think they were discovered by a group called the Galilean group. Oh right, Galileos. No, wait, maybe the Galileanmoons? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. So, Phoebe and Dione were part of that group. What do I know about their discovery?

I think they were found in 1995 by a team led by Don J. de Haegemont. They were part of the Galilean moons, which were discovered as part of their studies of Jupiter. So, they're not the same as the more famous moons like Io, Europa, and Ganymede. These are smaller, less massive moons.

Wait, so Phoebe and Dione are smaller and closer to Jupiter. They're part of the Galilean moons, not the outer ones like Io, Europa, etc. So the question is asking about the planet they're moons of. That's the same as the planet Jupiter, because the Galilean moons were around Jupiter.

Looking at the options, option I is Jupiter. So the correct answer should be I: Jupiter.

Let me double-check the options. The options are A to J, with I being Jupiter. So yes, that's the one.

The correct answer is **I: Jupiter**.
