Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me try to break it down. The problem is about finding the expectation (a) and variance (b) of a certain random variable. The variable is defined as the limit as n approaches infinity of a normalized sum involving X_k, which are independent variables taking values +1 or -1 with equal probability.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We have X_1, X_2, and so on, each taking +1 or -1 with probability 1/2. So each X_k is a Rademacher random variable, right? They're independent and identically distributed.

The expression given is √(3/n³) * sum from k=1 to n of k*X_k. And it's known that as n tends to infinity, this converges in distribution to a normal distribution N(a, b). I need to find a and b.

Wait, so the normalized sum converges to a normal distribution. That suggests that maybe we can use the Central Limit Theorem here because we're dealing with a sum of random variables. But the Central Limit Theorem usually involves the sum of independent variables divided by the square root of the number of terms. Here, each term is weighted by k, which complicates things.

Let me think about the components. The sum is S_n = sum_{k=1}^n k X_k. Each term k*X_k is a random variable. Since X_k are independent, S_n is the sum of these random variables. Let's find the mean and variance of each term.

The mean of X_k is E[X_k] = (1)(1/2) + (-1)(1/2) = 0. So each term k X_k has a mean of 0. Therefore, the mean of S_n is 0.

What about the variance? Since the X_k are independent, the variance of S_n is the sum of the variances of each term. The variance of X_k is Var(X_k) = E[X_k²] - (E[X_k])² = 1 - 0 = 1. So each term k X_k has variance Var(k X_k) = k² Var(X_k) = k² * 1 = k². Therefore, the variance of S_n is sum_{k=1}^n k².

Hmm, so Var(S_n) is the sum of squares from 1 to n. The formula for the sum of squares up to n is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. So that's Var(S_n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

But wait, the expression we have is sqrt(3/n³) multiplied by S_n. Let me write that as (S_n) * sqrt(3)/n^(3/2).

I need to find the limit in distribution of this expression as n tends to infinity. If this converges to a normal distribution, then by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sum S_n divided by sqrt(Var(S_n)) should converge to N(0,1), right?

Wait, but in the CLT, you have (sum X_i ) / sqrt(n Var(X_i)) ~ N(0,1). But in this case, the terms aren't 1, but scaled by k. So, perhaps I should think about how S_n behaves as n increases.

So let me compute the variance again. Var(S_n) = sum_{k=1}^n Var(k X_k) = sum_{k=1}^n k². I can write this sum as n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Let me approximate this for large n. For large n, n+1 ≈n, 2n+1≈2n. So sum ≈ (n * n * 2n)/6 = (2n^3)/6 = n^3/3.

Wait, but that would make Var(S_n) ≈ n^3 /3. So for large n, Var(S_n) is about n^3 /3. Therefore, the standard deviation of S_n is sqrt(Var(S_n)) ≈ n^(3/2)/sqrt(3).

So the expression we're looking at is [S_n] * sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) = [S_n / sqrt(Var(S_n)) ] * (sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) * sqrt(Var(S_n)) )? Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, the expression is sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) * S_n = S_n * sqrt(3) / n^(3/2). Since S_n is of order n^(3/2) (because Var(S_n) is n^3/3), so S_n is proportional to n^(3/2) for large n. Let me see: S_n's variance is n^3/3, so the standard deviation is n^(3/2)/sqrt(3). Therefore, S_n is of order n^(3/2).

So sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) * S_n would be (S_n) * (sqrt(3) ) / (n^(3/2)).

But since S_n is the sum of terms each up to n^2 (since each term is k^2), so S_n is O(n^3). Wait, no. Wait, S_n is the sum of k^2 from k=1 to n. So S_n is O(n^3), because the largest term is n^2, and there are n terms. Wait, but n^2 * n is n^3. So S_n is O(n^3).

So sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) * S_n would be O(n^3) / n^(3/2) ) = O(n^{3/2} ). Wait, that can't be right. Because that would mean the expression is growing as n increases, which would tend to infinity, but the problem states that it converges to a normal distribution. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variance. Let me recompute the variance of S_n.

Each term is k X_k, where X_k is ±1. So Var(k X_k) = k² Var(X_k) = k² *1 = k². So sum Var(k X_k) from k=1 to n is sum_{k=1}^n k² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

Approximate for large n:

n(n+1) ≈n², (2n+1)≈2n. So the sum is about (n² * 2n)/6 = (2n³)/6 = n³/3.

So Var(S_n) = n³/3 → as n→infty, the variance grows as n³/3.

Therefore, the standard deviation is sqrt(Var(S_n)) = sqrt(n³/3) = n^(3/2) / sqrt(3).

So the expression we're looking at is sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) * S_n = (S_n) * (sqrt(3)/n^(3/2)).

But S_n is sum_{k=1}^n k X_k. The expectation of S_n is zero because each term has expectation zero. So the mean of the expression is zero.

What about the variance? The variance of (sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) S_n) is (3)/(n^3) * Var(S_n) = (3)/(n^3) * (n³/3) )= 1.

Wait, that can't be. Because if the variance approaches 1 as n→infty, that would imply that the expression converges to a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. So a=0 and b=1.

Looking at the options, option B is [0, 1], which would make sense.

Wait, but wait—I thought that the variance of S_n is n³/3, so when you scale by sqrt(3)/n^(3/2), the variance becomes:

Var( (sqrt(3)/n^(3/2) S_n) ) = (3 / n^3 ) * (n³/3) )= 1.

So the variance converges to 1, and the mean is zero, so N(0,1). So a=0, b=1.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach is to think about the Central Limit Theorem for the scaled sum.

The Central Limit Theorem states that if (X_1, X_2, ...) are independent, identically distributed, with finite variance μ and σ², then the normalized sum (sum X_k)/ (σ sqrt(n)) tends to N(0,1) as n→infty.

In our case, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n k X_k. Let me denote Y_n = sum_{k=1}^n k X_k.

We can consider each term as X_k * k. So each term is a scaled version of X_k.

Let me compute the mean and variance of Y_n.

Mean of Y_n: sum_{k=1}^n E[k X_k] = sum_{k=1}^n k E[X_k] = 0 since E[X_k] = 0.

Variance of Y_n: Var( sum_{k=1}^n k X_k ) = sum_{k=1}^n Var(k X_k) = sum_{k=1}^n k².

As before, Var(Y_n) = n³/3.

So the standard deviation is sqrt(Var(Y_n)) = sqrt(n³/3) = n^(3/2)/sqrt(3).

So now, the expression is (sqrt(3)/n^(3/2)) * Y_n.

Let me rewrite this as (Y_n) * (sqrt(3) / n^(3/2)).

Since Var(Y_n) = n^3 /3, and the expression is Y_n scaled by sqrt(3)/n^{3/2}.

So, the variance of the expression will be Var(Y_n) * (sqrt(3)/n^{3/2})^2.

Wait, no, because variance is linear, not multiplicative. Wait, when you multiply a random variable by a constant c, the variance becomes c² Var(X). So, in this case, the expression is (sqrt(3)/n^{3/2}) * Y_n.

So the variance would be (sqrt(3)/n^{3/2})^2 * Var(Y_n) = (3/(n^3)) * (n^3/3) )= 1.

So the variance of the expression tends to 1 as n→infty. And the mean of the expression is zero, because Y_n has mean zero.

Therefore, the expression converges in distribution to N(0,1). So a=0 and b=1. Looking at the options, that's option B: [0, 1].
</think>

The problem involves determining the expectation and variance of a normalized sum of independent Rademacher variables. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Define the Variables**: Each \( X_k \) is ±1 with equal probability, making them independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

2. **Sum and Variance Calculation**:
   - The sum \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k X_k \) has variance \( \text{Var}(S_n) = \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 \), which is \( n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 \approx n^3/3 \) for large \( n \).

3. **Normalization**:
   - The expression \( \sqrt{3/n^3} \cdot S_n \) is normalized by \( \sqrt{3/n^3} \), which scales the sum.

4. **Central Limit Theorem Application**:
   - The sum \( S_n \) has variance \( n^3/3 \), so its standard deviation is \( n^{3/2}/\sqrt{3} \).
   - The normalized expression converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 due to the Central Limit Theorem.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The expectation \( a = 0 \) and the variance \( b = 1 \).

The correct option is **B: [0, 1]**.
