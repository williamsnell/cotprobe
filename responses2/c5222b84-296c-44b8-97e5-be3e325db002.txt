Okay, so I've got this question about determinants and orthogonal matrices. Hmm, let's think through this. The question says that both A and B are orthogonal square matrices, and their determinants have opposite signs: det A is -det B. We need to find det(A + B). The options are a bunch of numbers, mostly integers and their negatives.

Wait, orthogonal matrices. I remember that an orthogonal matrix Q satisfies Q^T Q = I, where Q^T is the transpose and I is the identity matrix. Also, the determinant of an orthogonal matrix has absolute value 1. So det Q is either 1 or -1. Because if you take the determinant of both sides of Q^T Q = I, you get (det Q^T)(det Q) = det I. Since det I is 1, and det Q^T is det Q, it follows that (det Q)^2 = 1, so det Q is ±1.

So, since A and B are orthogonal, det A and det B are each either 1 or -1. The question says det A = -det B. So, if det A is 1, det B is -1, and vice versa. So, their determinants are negatives of each other. So, for example, det A = 1, det B = -1, or det A = -1, det B = 1.

Now, the main question is about det(A + B). I know that determinants don't distribute over addition, so there's no straightforward formula for det(A + B) in terms of det A and det B. So I can't directly compute it from the given information just based on the determinants.

But perhaps there's something more specific about orthogonal matrices and their sum. Let's think about what A + B would look like. Since they are square matrices, their sum is a matrix where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from A and B.

Wait, another thought: if A and B are orthogonal, their product is orthogonal, but that doesn't directly help here. Also, the sum of two orthogonal matrices isn't necessarily orthogonal. For example, the sum of two orthogonal matrices might not preserve the inner product or the orthonormality of the columns.

Alternatively, maybe there's a property or a specific case where the determinant of their sum can be determined. Let's consider some specific cases.

Case 1: Let's say A is the identity matrix, so det A = 1. Then B would have det B = -1. But what's B? Since B is orthogonal, its determinant is -1. So maybe B is a reflection matrix, or some other orthogonal matrix with determinant -1. For example, a rotation matrix might have determinant 1, but a reflection has determinant -1.

Wait, another approach: think about whether A + B can be invertible, or if it's singular. If the determinant is zero, then the matrix is not invertible. Otherwise, it's invertible.

But without knowing more about A and B, it's hard to say. Hmm. Maybe there's a more general approach.

Wait, perhaps there's a property that the sum of two orthogonal matrices doesn't necessarily have a determinant that can be directly inferred, but maybe it's constrained in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the determinant of A + B is zero in this case.

Wait, another angle: think about the properties of orthogonal matrices and how they interact when added. Let me think of some specific examples.

Example 1: Let’s take A as the identity matrix, so A = I. Then B could be a reflection matrix, like the matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So B is orthogonal because B^T B is identity. The determinant of B is (1)(-1) - (0)(0) = -1, which matches the condition.

So, A = I (det A =1), B = [[1,0],[0,-1]] (det B =-1).

Then A + B would be [[1+1, 0+0], [0+0, 1 + (-1)] ] = [[2,0],[0,0]]. The determinant of this matrix is (2)(0) - (0)(0) = 0. So det(A+B) =0.

Hmm, so in this case, the determinant is zero.

Another example: What if A is a rotation matrix and B is a reflection. Let’s take A as rotation by 90 degrees, which is [[0, -1], [1, 0]]. Its determinant is (0)(0) - (-1)(1) = 1. Then B, say, is the reflection matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which has determinant -1. Then A + B is [[0+1, -1 + 0], [1 + 0, 0 + (-1)] ] = [[1, -1], [1, -1]]. The determinant here would be (1)(-1) - (-1)(1) = -1 +1 = 0.

Another case: Let me think of two matrices where their sum's determinant is zero. So in the examples above, in both cases, the sum had a determinant of zero.

Is there a case where the determinant is not zero? Let me try another pair.

Suppose A is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so det A = -1. Then B is [[-1,0],[0,1]], so det B = (-1)(1) - 0 = -1. So det A = -det B. Then A + B is [[1 + (-1), 0+0], [0 + 0, -1 +1]] = [[0,0],[0,0]]. The determinant is zero.

Another example: Let’s say A is [[1,0],[0,1]], det A=1. Then B is [[-1,0],[0,1]], det B= (-1)(1) -0= -1. Then A + B is [[0,0],[0,2]], determinant zero.

Wait, in all these examples, the sum has a determinant of zero. So perhaps in general, if A and B are orthogonal matrices, and det A = -det B, then A + B is singular, so det(A+B)=0.

But wait, wait. Are there any cases where det(A+B) isn't zero? Let me think of another pair.

Suppose A is the identity matrix, and B is a rotation matrix. Let's say B is [[cosθ, -sinθ], [sinθ, cosθ]], which has determinant 1. So det A=1, det B=1, but in this case, det A equals det B. Not applicable because the question says det A = -det B.

Wait, another example. Let's take A and B to be such that A + B is a diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal elements. So, for example, A is [[1,0],[0,-1]], det A=-1. B is [[a,b],[c,d]], with det B = -det A =1. So det B=1.

But wait, if B is [[a,b],[c,d]], then a*d - b*c =1. Now, when you add A and B, you get [[1+a, b],[c, -1 +d]]. The determinant of this sum is (1+a)(-1 +d) - b c.

Hmm, but unless the sum is a diagonal matrix, the determinant could be something else. But I'm not sure if this would always result in zero. But in the previous examples, it was zero.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a general property here. Wait, considering that A and B are orthogonal, perhaps A^T = A^{-1} and B^T = B^{-1}.

But I'm not seeing a direct way to combine this. Alternatively, perhaps if A and B are inverses of each other, but that might not apply here.

Wait, another approach: Consider that for any orthogonal matrix Q, Q^T = Q^{-1}, so Q^2 is orthogonal if Q is orthogonal, but that might not help directly.

Wait, but if I consider that A + B is a sum of two orthogonal matrices, maybe it's possible that A + B is also orthogonal, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Wait, but perhaps for the sum to be orthogonal, certain conditions must hold. But I don't think that's the case here. So that might not help.

Wait, another thought: Since A and B are orthogonal, their adjugate matrices are related to their inverses. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the determinant of A + B in terms of the determinants of A and B and some other terms, but I don't recall a formula that directly relates det(A+B) to det A and det B.

Wait, here's a different approach. Let's consider that for any 2x2 matrices, the determinant of a sum can sometimes be expressed in terms of their individual determinants. But for higher dimensions, it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe for 2x2 matrices, the determinant of the sum can be expressed as det(A) + det(B) + (trace(AB^{-1}) - trace(A^{-1}B)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in 2x2, the determinant of A + B can be written as det A + det B + (trace(AB^{-1} ) - trace(A^{-1}B )) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, but perhaps in the 2x2 case, the determinant of (A+B) is det(A) + det(B) + tr(AB^{-1}) - tr(A^{-1}B). Let me check.

The formula I remember for 2x2 matrices is that det(A + B) = (det A + det B) + (tr(AB^{-1}) - tr(A^{-1} B)) ). Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, I think the correct formula for det(A + B) in 2x2 is:

det(A + B) = det A + det B + trace(AB^{-1}) - trace(A^{-1} B).

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is det(A + B) = det A + det B + tr(A B^{-1}) - tr(A^{-1} B).

Wait, let me see an example. Let me take A and B as 2x2 matrices.

Let A be [[1,0],[0,1]] → det A=1, A inverse is same as A, so A^{-1} is identity.

Let B be [[0,1],[1,0]] → det B = (0*0 - 1*1) = -1. So det A =1, det B =-1 → det A =-det B, which fits the condition.

Now, A + B = [[1+0, 0+1],[0+1, 1+0]] → [[1,1],[1,1]].

The determinant is (1)(1) - (1)(1) = 0.

Now, according to the formula I thought of, det(A+B) should be det A + det B + trace(AB^{-1}) - trace(A^{-1} B).

Compute each part:

AB^{-1} → A is identity, B is [[0,1],[1,0]], so B^{-1} is same as B^T, which is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So AB^{-1} is identity times B^{-1}, which is B^{-1} → [[0,1],[1,0]].

The trace of AB^{-1} is 0 +0 =0.

A^{-1} B → identity times B → B.

Trace of A^{-1} B is 0+0=0.

So according to the formula, det(A+B) = det A + det B + 0 -0 → 1 + (-1) +0 -0 =0.

Which matches the actual determinant. So this formula seems to hold in this case.

Now, let me try another case. Let's take A as the identity matrix again, and B as [[1,0],[0,-1]], which has determinant -1.

A + B is [[2,0],[0,0]], determinant is 0.

Compute using the formula:

AB^{-1} = identity times B^{-1} = B^{-1} = same as B, because B is orthogonal.

Wait, B is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so B^{-1} is same as B, since determinant is -1, which is its own inverse.

So AB^{-1} is the same as B → trace is 1 + (-1) =0.

A^{-1} B is same as B, because A is identity. So trace is 1 + (-1) =0.

So det(A+B) = det A + det B + 0 -0 →1 + (-1) =0. Which also matches.

So the formula seems to hold.

So if I apply this formula to any A and B (orthogonal matrices, det A = -det B), then the determinant of (A + B) is 0.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.
