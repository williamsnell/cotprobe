Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about international economics, specifically about currency appreciation, depreciation, and how it relates to interest rates and other factors. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says: If interest rates rise relatively more in country A than in country B, what happens to the value of country A's currency? The options are A to J, each with different possibilities.

I remember that when interest rates are higher, it affects the demand for a country's currency. Higher interest rates make it more attractive for investors to hold that currency because they get more returns. So, in terms of purchasing power parity, higher interest rates in a country would cause its currency to appreciate, right? Because people want to hold more of that currency to earn higher returns.

Wait, so if country A has higher interest rates than B, A's currency should appreciate. That makes sense because A can earn more interest, so its exports would be more valuable, which can attract more foreign investment, leading to a stronger currency.

Looking at the options, option E says "appreciate." Option C says "be pegged to the value of country B's currency." I think pegging implies a fixed exchange rate, but the question doesn't mention that. It just says the value of A's currency, so I don't think pegging is the right answer here. So option E seems correct.

Option D: increase, then decrease. That doesn't sound right. If A's interest rates are consistently higher, the currency should appreciate, not go up and then down. Unless other factors are changing, but the question doesn't mention that.

Option F says fluctuate unpredictably. That's unlikely. Interest rate differences should have a direct impact, not random changes.

Option G: decrease, then increase. No, higher interest rates in A should cause A's currency to appreciate, not decrease and then increase.

Option H: change indeterminately. Again, I don't think so. Different factors can influence currency values, but I don't recall any other factors mentioned here related to this scenario.

Option I: depend on inflation. I don't think the question relates to inflation. It's more about interest rates affecting the currency's value.

Option J: remain unchanged. No, because higher interest rates generally lead to appreciation.

So the best answer must be E: appreciate.

The correct answer is E: appreciate. Higher interest rates in country A make its currency more attractive, leading to its appreciation.

Answer: E
