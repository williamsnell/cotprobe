Okay, so I have this question about neuroticism and anxiety. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is asking if a symptom that doesn't help relieve anxiety would lead someone to ignore or discard the neurotic element. 

First, I remember that neuroticism is a psychological concept that suggests that some people experience intense mood swings, anxiety, and depression. It's often linked to traits like perfectionism, cope with stress, and maybe even some anxiety disorders. 

So the question is: if a symptom doesn't solve the anxiety, does the person discard the neurotic aspect? Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think I've heard that people try to find solutions to their problems, even if they're not effective. So maybe they don't discard the neurotic traits but instead seek additional solutions.

Looking at the options:

A: the neurotic discards them. I don't think that's right. They usually try to find a better way, not abandon it.

B: The neurotic accepts them but seeks additional solutions. Yeah, that makes sense. They acknowledge the symptom but keep looking for better ways to cope.

C: the neurotic ignores them. No, they wouldn't ignore it; they'd try again.

D: The neurotic is unaware of the symptom's presence. That doesn't fit. They know they have symptoms, but maybe they don't recognize them as a problem.

E: the neurotic does not discard them. So they don't abandon the neurotic trait. That seems opposite of what I thought.

F: The neurotic suppresses until they are effective. I'm not sure about this one. Suppression might be a defense mechanism, but if the symptom isn't working, they might try again, not suppress.

So the correct answer should be B: The neurotic accepts them but seeks additional solutions. Because they're aware of the symptom but are determined to find a better solution.
