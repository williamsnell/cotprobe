Okay, so I've got this question about the Over justification hypothesis and what it implies. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with the exact theory, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about the self-concept and how the hypothesis affects certain behaviors. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's break it down.

First, the question says, "What can happen according to the OVERJUSTIFICATION HYPOTHESIS?" So I need to understand what the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis states. I remember that this theory is related to self-organization and how people's behaviors are influenced by their perceptions of their environment.

From what I recall, the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis suggests that people tend to focus on their internal cues rather than external ones. So, if an external cue is present, they might not first notice the internal factors. For example, if someone sees a car park (external cue) and thinks about their internal state (like whether it's a good place to park), they might not notice the physiological arousal or the emotional response that comes from it. 

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The hypothesis says that people will look at internal factors (justifications) even if external ones are present. So, if an external cue exists, people don't let that external state influence their decisions but instead focus on their internal factors. That would mean they might not experience the physiological arousal just because they see the external cue. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact implications.

Looking at the options:

Option A: to experience an emotion, a person must first experience cognitive interpretation, then physiological arousal. Hmm. So, maybe they first figure out the meaning (cognitive) of the situation, then feel the emotion. But I'm not sure how this ties into the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis.

Option B: not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. Wait, if not rewarding someone for an enjoyable activity, that might reduce their interest. But the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis says people focus on internal cues, so maybe they don't notice the reward or enjoy it because they're focused on their own needs. So that could undermine their interest in the activity. But I'm not certain about this connection.

Option C: not rewarding people for an unenjoyable activity can enhance their interest. So if someone finds an activity unenjoyable, and it's not rewarding, they might gain interest. But the hypothesis isn't clear on that. Alternatively, maybe the lack of reward would make them less interested, but the option says it enhances. So I'm not sure about this.

Option D: when internal cues are clear, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context. So this sounds like the idea that when someone knows what's going on internally (like they know they're feeling anxious), they can infer their behavior and the context from that. That makes sense because if you know your internal state, you might infer others' actions or the situation around you.

Option E: rewarding people for an unenjoyable activity can enhance their interest. So if an activity is unenjoyable but rewarding, interest would increase. But I'm not sure how the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis would affect this. The hypothesis is about focusing on internal cues. So maybe they would not notice the external reward because they're focusing on their own needs, thus losing interest.

Option F: to experience an emotion, a person must first experience physiological arousal, then cognitive interpretation. So, does this mean that before feeling an emotion, they have to figure out the physiological response, or the other way around? I'm not exactly sure. But the OVERJUSTIFICATION theory is about focusing on internal factors, not necessarily the order of experiences.

Option G: when internal cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context. So, if internal factors are unclear, they use their behavior and environment to figure it out. That sounds like the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis.

Option H: rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. So if someone gets rewarded for an enjoyable activity, their interest is affected. I think that's more about the intrinsic motivation. The OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis is about the influence of external cues on internal decisions.

Option I: when external cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context. So, if external information isn't clear, people infer internal factors from their own behavior and surroundings.

Option J: rewarding people excessively can enhance their interest. So, the more rewards, the more interest. But the OVERJUSTIFICATION theory says people look at internal cues, not external ones. So, if rewards are given, they might not notice the internal factors that could enhance interest.

Let's try to match these. The OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis suggests that people focus on internal factors (justifications) even when external ones are present. So, if an external cue is present, they don't notice it but pay attention to their internal states.

Looking at the options, option G says when internal cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the context. That fits with the hypothesis because when internal factors aren't clear, they rely on behavior and context to figure them out.

Option I says when external cues are vague, people infer based on behavior and context. That also aligns because if external info is unclear, they infer from their own actions.

Wait, but the question is about what the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis can do. So which of the options is a direct outcome of it.

Looking at the options, option G says when internal cues are vague, people infer by observing behavior and context. So that's about internal vs external, which is exactly what the hypothesis is about.

So the correct answer should be option G.
</think>

The OVERJUSTIFICATION HYPOTHESIS suggests that people focus on internal cues rather than external ones, meaning they pay attention to internal factors even when external information is present. This leads to a situation where individuals might not notice an external cue but infer its meaning based on their internal state.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** states: "when internal cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context." This aligns with the OVERJUSTIFICATION hypothesis, as it highlights the reliance on internal factors when external information is unclear.

Thus, the correct answer is **G**, as it directly reflects the hypothesis's implication about internal vs. external cues and inference mechanisms.

**Answer: G**
