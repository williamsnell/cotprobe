Okay, so I've got this question about stranger anxiety in children. Hmm, I remember that stranger anxiety is a type of anxiety where children experience fear when they see strangers around them, especially at certain times or situations. The question is asking about the typical age range when this begins for most children.

I think the answer is usually around 2-3 months, but wait, that doesn't sound right because I remember hearing that it starts much earlier. Maybe it's when they're just learning to socialize. Oh wait, I think it starts around 12 to 14 months. So looking at the options, H is 12 to 14. That makes sense because I've read that kids start experiencing this around a year old, maybe a bit later than I thought. So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: 12 to 14 months.
