Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me read it again. It says a piston cylinder arrangement contains saturated Freon -12 at -10°C. Then the vapor is compressed to a final pressure of 1.6 MPa. The process is reversible and adiabatic. I need to find the work per kilogram of Freon -12 for this process. The options are A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange, so Q=0. And since it's reversible, it's an isentropic process. So the entropy should remain constant.

Wait, but Freon -12 is a refrigerant. I think it's a substance with variable entropy and specific volumes. Oh right, for refrigerants, entropy depends on temperature and pressure, but for some, it might not be considered constant. But in this case, since it's a process, I guess we're assuming it's undergoing an isentropic process. That is, the entropy doesn't change because it's reversible.

So the process is reversible adiabatic, so the first law becomes ΔU = W + Q. But Q is zero, so ΔU = W. Oh wait, but in an isentropic process for an ideal gas, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the work done on the system (W). But Freon -12 isn't an ideal gas, so this might not hold. Wait, but the process is isentropic, so maybe there's another approach.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Maybe I should think about the properties of Freon -12. I'll need to find the specific enthalpy and specific volume at both the initial and final states, and then calculate the work.

First, the initial state: saturated Freon -12 at -10°C. I think that would be the saturated liquid state. So I need the properties for saturated Freon-12 at that temperature.

Wait, but I might need to check the table for Freon-12 properties. Alternatively, perhaps I can use some equations.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the process. The process is adiabatic and reversible, so it's an isentropic compression. The work done on the system is equal to the change in enthalpy (assuming no heat transfer). So W = h2 - h1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because for an ideal gas, yes, but Freon is a real substance. But perhaps in this context, since it's a process that's treated as such, we can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the work as the area under the P-v curve for the process.

Wait, but without knowing the exact P-v diagram, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps I should use specific entropy.

Wait, wait. Since the process is isentropic (Δs = 0), maybe I can find the final temperature and then get the work.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me outline the steps.

1. Determine initial and final states.
   Initial state: saturated Freon-12 at -10°C. So, that's the point where the liquid and vapor coexist.
   Final state: compression to 1.6 MPa. Since it's isentropic, the entropy at final state is same as initial.

2. Find the entropy of the initial state. Then, find the specific entropy of the final state, which should be the same.

Wait, but wait. Freon-12 is a real gas, so the entropy can be found using the property tables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the specific entropy of saturated Freon-12 at -10°C, then find the specific volume, and then find the final state at 1.6 MPa and same entropy.

Wait, but maybe I should look up the properties of Freon-12. I'm not 100% sure about the exact values, but I can proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the final temperature at 1.6 MPa with the same entropy as the initial state. Because in an isentropic process, the entropy remains constant.

But without the exact tables, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps there's a shortcut, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the process is isentropic, so the entropy at the initial state equals that at the final state.

So, let's denote:

State 1: Saturated liquid Freon-12 at T1 = -10°C (263.15 K).
State 2: Compressed to P2=1.6 MPa, and with S2=S1.

We need to find the work done during this process.

But without knowing the equation of state for Freon-12, it's difficult to find the exact values. So maybe the problem expects an approximate approach or perhaps a standard method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the work done in an isentropic process for a real gas. But I'm not sure of the exact equation.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the ideal gas law approximation. But Freon-12 isn't an ideal gas, so that might not be accurate. But since the problem asks for the work, perhaps it's expecting an answer that uses some standard approach.

Alternatively, maybe the work is calculated using the change in enthalpy, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the first law for a reversible adiabatic process. The first law is:

ΔU = W + Q

But since Q=0 (adiabatic), ΔU = W. So W = ΔU.

But for real gases, the change in internal energy is given by:

ΔU = h2 - h1.

So W = h2 - h1.

But wait, in this case, the system is compressed, so the work done on the system is positive. So W would be positive.

But without knowing the actual values of h1 and h2, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the specific enthalpy at each state.

Wait, but without the exact data, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas approximation or some standard method.

Oh, wait, perhaps the process is considered as a saturated liquid at -10°C, and then compressed to 1.6 MPa. The work done would be the specific enthalpy at 1.6 MPa and the same entropy as at -10°C.

But without the exact tables, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that at the final state, the entropy is the same as the initial, which is a saturated liquid at the final temperature. So the final temperature would be lower than the initial temperature (since the pressure is higher — wait, no, because for an isentropic compression, the final temperature would be higher than the initial, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no. For isentropic compression, the temperature increases because the process is adiabatic and reversible. So yes, the final temperature is higher than the initial. But this is all getting a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the process as follows. The initial state is a saturated liquid at -10°C. The final state is a saturated vapor at some higher pressure, but wait, the pressure is 1.6 MPa. Wait, but for Freon-12, what's the saturation pressure at -10°C?

Wait, I'm not certain about the saturation pressure. But perhaps the final state is a saturated vapor at 1.6 MPa. Because if it's a saturated vapor, then the entropy would be the same as the initial state (since the process is isentropic).

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case — because the initial state is a saturated liquid, perhaps the final state is a mixture of liquid and vapor at 1.6 MPa?

Alternatively, maybe it's a different approach. Since the process is isentropic, the entropy at state 1 equals entropy at state 2.

So, for state 1: S1 = S_f at -10°C.

For state 2: S2 = S_f (at final temp, say T2) + x * S_g (at T2), where x is the quality.

But since S2 = S1, so S_f(T2) + x S_g(T2) = S_f(-10°C).

But the final pressure is 1.6 MPa. So, perhaps T2 is the saturation temperature corresponding to 1.6 MPa.

Wait, but perhaps that's the approach. I can find the saturation temperature at 1.6 MPa, then compute the entropy at that temperature, and find the quality x that brings the entropy to the initial state.

But without the exact data, I'm stuck. So perhaps I need to make some assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the work done is the specific enthalpy at the final state minus the initial state. But I don't know the final state's enthalpy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the work can be approximated using the ideal gas equation if the process is approximately isothermal, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use specific enthalpy tables for Freon-12.

Wait, but without the tables, perhaps I can recall that for certain substances, the work can be found using certain equations. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the correct option in the given choices.

Looking at the answer options, they include both positive and negative numbers. Wait, but since the process is compression, work is done on the system, so the work should be positive. So the answer is probably a positive value. So that rules out options B, F, G, H, J.

Options left: A, D, E, and I. Wait, no. Wait, the options are labeled A to J. Let me check:

Options:

A: 50.000 kJ/kg

B: -200.352 kJ/kg

C: 166.265 kJ/kg

D: 125.789 kJ/kg

E: -50.000 kJ/kg

F: 34.087 kJ/kg

G: 75.123 kJ/kg

H: -34.087 kJ/kg

I: -150.210 kJ/kg

J: -100.456 kJ/kg

So, the possible answers are A, D, C, and G. But the work is done on the system, so it's positive, so options A, D, C, G.

But perhaps the actual process is that the system is compressed, so W is positive. So the options are A, C, or D.

Wait, but the initial state is at -10°C, and the final pressure is 1.6 MPa. So maybe the initial state is the saturated liquid, and the final state is the saturated vapor at 1.6 MPa. So then, the process is a two-phase process, but the entropy is the same as the initial state.

Wait, but in reality, the initial state is a saturated liquid, so the entropy is S_f(-10°C). The final state is a mixture of liquid and vapor at 1.6 MPa, and S_f(T2) + x S_g(T2) = S_f(-10°C). So I can compute T2 from the saturation temperature at 1.6 MPa.

Let me try to find the saturation temperature at 1.6 MPa.

Wait, I remember that the saturation pressure of Freon-12 increases with temperature. For example, at 0°C, it's about 1.6 MPa or so. So if the final pressure is 1.6 MPa, what's the saturation temperature?

I think at 1.6 MPa, the saturation temperature is higher than 0°C. Let me think: For Freon-12, the saturation pressure at 0°C is about 1.6 MPa. So at 1.6 MPa, the saturation temperature is higher than 0°C. Let me say approximately 10°C, but I'm not certain.

But perhaps I should think of the process as being a two-phase process. So, the entropy of the system after compression would be S_f(T2) + x S_g(T2) = S_f(T1). Since the initial state is a saturated liquid, S1 = S_f(T1).

So, T1 is -10°C. So S1 = S_f(-10°C) = ?

And S2 = S_f(T2) + x S_g(T2) = S1.

Hmm, but without knowing T2 and x, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the process is isentropic, and the final state is at 1.6 MPa, perhaps the entropy is the same as the initial state.

Alternative idea: perhaps the process is similar to the compression of a gas in an isentropic manner, and the work done can be approximated as the specific enthalpy at the final state minus specific enthalpy at the initial state.

But without data, perhaps I can think of the answer as option C: 166.265 kJ/kg.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to think about the work done in a constant entropy process, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the specific enthalpy at the final temperature.

Wait, perhaps I can look for a table or an online resource. But since I can't, I'll proceed with the given options.

Wait, another approach — perhaps the work for an isentropic process of an ideal gas is (P2 V2 - P1 V1)/n. But since Freon isn't ideal, perhaps this isn't applicable.

Wait, but maybe I can use the ideal gas law for approximation. Let's assume that Freon-12 behaves like an ideal gas, which may not be accurate, but perhaps it's a start.

Wait, but if I do that, then the work would be W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / n.

But I don't have the volumes at each state. However, perhaps I can find the initial and final volumes from the saturation data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the initial and final temperatures, then compute the work.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the isentropic process in terms of specific volumes.

Let me proceed:

At initial state, T1 = -10°C = 263.15 K; state is saturated liquid.

At final state, P2 = 1.6 MPa. The saturation temperature T2 can be found from a table, but without the table, perhaps I can estimate.

Assuming that at 1.6 MPa, the saturation temperature is around 10°C (for example, if 1.6 MPa is the saturation pressure at 0°C). If that's the case, then T2 = 10°C = 283.15 K.

In that case, the entropy change would be S2 - S1 = (S_f(T2) + x S_g(T2)) - S_f(T1).

But since the process is isentropic, S2 = S1, so S_f(T2) + x S_g(T2) = S_f(T1).

Hmm, but how to proceed without the exact data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the work as the area under the P-v curve, but without knowing the exact points, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy change. The work done is h2 - h1. But without knowing h1 and h2, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the work done is the specific enthalpy at the final state minus the initial state. But without knowing the final state's enthalpy, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the process as requiring the calculation of the work using the formula for an isentropic process in a substance with variable specific heats.

Wait, but without the tables, this is hard. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the option that seems plausible.

Looking at the possible options, option C is 166.265 kJ/kg. That's a positive value, matching the expectation for work done on the system.

Option A is 50.000, which is about 0.166 MPa (50 kJ/kg is 0.05 MPa, so maybe if the process is isentropic, the work is about that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial and final states are such that the work is higher, like 166 kJ/kg. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the work can be found using the formula for the work in a constant entropy process. The formula for work in such a process for a substance with variable specific heats is:

W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / n

But again, without knowing the volumes, this is hard.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to approximate the work. Let's try that.

Assuming that the initial state is a saturated liquid, at T1 = -10°C. The volume of the saturated liquid is V1. The final state is a saturated vapor at T2 = 10°C (approx). So V2 is the volume of the saturated vapor.

Assuming ideal gas behavior, P V = n R T.

So, n = (m/M) = 1/M, where M is molar mass of Freon-12.

But without knowing the molar mass, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated without the exact data.

Another approach: perhaps the answer is option C) 166.265 kJ/kg. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the enthalpy change. The enthalpy of the initial state is h1 = h_f(T1). The final state is h2 = h_g(T2). But again, without knowing the saturation temperatures and enthalpy values, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is isentropic, and the work is calculated using the formula:

W = (h2 - h1) = integral from T1 to T2 of C_p(T) dT

But without knowing C_p(T), it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the answer is option C) 166.265 kJ/kg.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 50 kJ/kg, but I don't have enough confidence in that.

Wait, another thought: the process is isentropic, so the work can be calculated as h2 - h1. But without knowing h1 and h2, perhaps the answer is option C, since it's the only positive option.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the work done by the system is negative, so the answer would be negative, but that can't be the case because the question asks for the work per kilogram, which is positive.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the answer. But perhaps I can think that the work is 166 kJ/kg, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

After some consideration, I think the correct answer is option C) 166.265 kJ/kg.
</think>

To determine the work per kilogram of Freon-12 during the process, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Initial State**: Freon-12 is in the **saturated liquid** state at -10°C. The entropy at this state is \( S_1 = S_{f}(-10^\circ \text{C}) \).

2. **Final State**: The process is **reversible and adiabatic** (isentropic). Freon-12 is compressed to a pressure of 1.6 MPa. For an isentropic process, the entropy remains constant: \( S_2 = S_1 \). The final state is a **saturated vapor** at 1.6 MPa, and the entropy is determined by the saturation entropy at this pressure.

3. **Key Assumption**: Since the process is isentropic and reversible, the work done on the system is equal to the change in enthalpy: \( W = h_2 - h_1 \). However, without the exact values of \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \), this approach is incomplete.

4. **Answer Options**: The options provided are:
   - A: 50.000 kJ/kg
   - B: -200.352 kJ/kg
   - C: 166.265 kJ/kg
   - D: 125.789 kJ/kg
   - E: -50.000 kJ/kg
   - F: 34.087 kJ/kg
   - G: 75.123 kJ/kg
   - H: -34.087 kJ/kg
   - I: -150.210 kJ/kg
   - J: -100.456 kJ/kg

   Since the process involves compression, the work is positive. Therefore, the negative options (B, E, H, I, J) are eliminated. This leaves options A, C, D, F, G, and J. Further analysis eliminates options B, E, H, I, J.

5. **Final Selection**: Based on the reasoning and the provided options, the most plausible answer is **C: 166.265 kJ/kg**, as it aligns with the expectation of positive work for a compression process.
