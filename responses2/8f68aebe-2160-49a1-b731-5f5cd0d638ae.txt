Okay, let's see. I have this function f(x) defined piecewise, and I need to find its fundamental period. Hmm. So the function is defined differently in each interval, right?

Looking at the function, it's given as:

f(x) = (-1)^n, when 2n-1 ≤ x < 2n,

and f(x) = 1, when 2n ≤ x < 2n+1, for n = 0, ±1, ±2, etc.

Wait, let's parse that again. For each integer n, the function behaves differently in two intervals. Let me think about what intervals these correspond to.

When n=0: 2(0)-1 = -1 ≤ x < 2(0) = 0. So that's x from -1 to 0.

Then, f(x) = (-1)^0 = 1 in that interval.

But wait, n=0: So the intervals for n=0 are [-1, 0) and [0, 1). Because 2n is 0, so [0,1). So in [-1,0), it's (-1)^0 = 1, and in [0,1), it's 1 as well.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because for n=1, the intervals would be [1,2) and [2,3), right? And for each of those, f(x) = (-1)^1 = -1.

Similarly, for n=-1: 2(-1)-1 = -3 ≤ x < -2. So the intervals would be [-3, -2) and [-2, -1). And f(x) here would be (-1)^(-1) = -1, since (-1)^-1 is -1.

So, putting it all together, the function alternates between 1 and -1 in each interval of length 1. So the function looks like a square wave that alternates between 1 and -1 every interval.

Now, what's the fundamental period of this function? The fundamental period is the smallest positive number T such that f(x + T) = f(x) for all x.

Looking at the intervals, each time the function repeats its pattern every 2 units. Because starting from -1 to 0, 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc., each time the function completes a full cycle.

So, the function has a period of 2. Let me check. For example, f(0) = 1. What is f(2)? Let's see, x=2 is in the interval [2,3), so it's 1. Similarly, f(-1) is 1, and f(1) is also 1. So every 2 units, the function repeats.

Is there a smaller period? Let's see. What about T=1? If I take T=1, then f(x+1) would be different. For example, f(0) is 1, but f(1) is (-1)^1 = -1. So f(0+1) = -1 ≠ 1, which means T=1 is not a period. Similarly, any smaller period would not repeat the function, since the function alternates every 1 unit.

So the fundamental period is 2. Looking at the options, that's option B.

The function alternates between 1 and -1 every 1 unit, indicating a period of 2. Checking smaller periods like 1, 2, etc., confirms that 2 is the smallest period. Thus, the fundamental period is 2.

Answer: B
