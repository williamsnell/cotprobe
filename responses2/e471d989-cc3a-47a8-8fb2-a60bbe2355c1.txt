Okay, so I have this function f(x) = (x + 6)/sqrt(x² - 3x -4), and I need to find its domain. Hmm, I remember that the domain of a function is all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since this function has a denominator and a square root, I need to make sure both parts are valid.

First, the denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, the expression sqrt(x² -3x -4) must not be zero. But wait, the square root is in the denominator, so actually, the expression inside the square root must be greater than zero because the square root of zero is zero, which would make the denominator zero, which is not allowed. So that means x² -3x -4 must be greater than zero. Let me factor that quadratic to find the critical points. 

x² -3x -4 factors into (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0. So the roots are x=4 and x=-1. Now, to determine where the quadratic is positive, I can test intervals around these roots.

The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of x² is positive), so it will be positive outside the roots. That means x < -1 or x >4. So the expression inside the square root is positive when x is in (-infinity, -1) or (4, infinity). So that's the first condition.

Next, I also need to ensure that the denominator isn't zero. The denominator is sqrt(x² -3x -4), so sqrt(0) is zero, which is not allowed. But since the square root is already positive (as we found earlier), the denominator is always positive in the intervals where x² -3x -4 >0. So the denominator is safe as long as the inside is positive, which is already covered.

Wait, but I should also consider the numerator. The numerator is (x +6). Since any real number can be in the numerator, there's no restriction from the numerator. So the only restrictions come from the square root's argument being positive.

So putting that together, the domain is all real numbers x where x < -1 or x >4. So in interval notation, that's (-infinity, -1) U (4, infinity). Looking at the options, option F is (-inf, -1) U (-1,4) U (4, inf). Wait, no. Because from my analysis it's x < -1 and x>4, but none in between. So option F includes (-1,4), which is actually where x² -3x -4 is negative, which would make the denominator undefined. So option F is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. The square root is defined only when x² -3x -4 is positive, so that's x < -1 or x>4. So the domain is (-inf, -1) U (4, inf). But the options presented don't include that exactly. Let's look again.

Looking at the options: A is (-inf, -4) U (4, inf). B is (-4,4). C is [0,4]. D is (-inf, -6) U (6, inf). E is (-inf,0) U (0, inf). F is (-inf, -1) U (-1,4) U (4, inf). G is [1,4]. H is (-inf, -1) U (4, inf). I is (-inf,0) U (0,4) U (4, inf). J is (-1,4).

Wait, so option H is exactly what I found: (-inf, -1) U (4, inf). But wait, the function f(x) is (x+6)/sqrt(...). The square root only exists when x² -3x -4 > 0, which as I found is x < -1 or x >4. So that's the domain. But none of the options is exactly that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option H is (-inf, -1) U (4, inf). So that's correct if that's an option. Looking back, yes, option H is that. So the answer should be option H.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The denominator is sqrt(x² -3x -4), which is sqrt((x-4)(x+1)). So when x is between -1 and 4, (x-4)(x+1) is negative because one factor is positive and the other is negative. So the square root is undefined there. Therefore, the function is only defined for x in (-infinity, -1) and (4, infinity). So the domain is (-inf, -1) U (4, inf), which is option H. So the correct answer is option H.

The domain of f(x) is determined by ensuring the denominator is positive. The quadratic x² - 3x - 4 factors to (x - 4)(x + 1), which is positive when x < -1 or x > 4. Thus, the domain is (-∞, -1) U (4, ∞), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
