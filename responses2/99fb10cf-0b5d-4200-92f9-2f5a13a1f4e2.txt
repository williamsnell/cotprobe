Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about average velocity of a ball being thrown into the air. The problem says that the height of the ball in feet after t seconds is given by y = 40t - 16t². I need to find the average velocity during the time period starting at t=2 and lasting 0.5 seconds. The answer options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. 

Hmm, average velocity... Oh wait, I remember that average velocity is the change in position over the change in time. So it's like the slope of the secant line between those two points. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably find the position of the ball at t=2 and at t=2.5 because the time interval is 0.5 seconds. Then, subtract the two positions to get the change in displacement. Then divide by the change in time, which is 0.5 seconds. That should give me the average velocity.

So, let me calculate the position at t=2. Plugging into the equation: y(2) = 40*(2) - 16*(2)². Let's compute that. 40*2 is 80, and 16*4 is 64. So 80 - 64 equals 16 feet. So at t=2, the ball is at 16 feet.

Now for t=2.5. y(2.5) = 40*(2.5) - 16*(2.5)². Calculating each part: 40*2.5 is 100. Then, 2.5 squared is 6.25. Multiply that by 16: 16*6.25 is 100. So y(2.5) is 100 - 100, which is 0. So at t=2.5, the ball is at ground level, assuming the ground is at y=0.

Wait, that makes sense because the ball was thrown upwards, reaches a peak, and comes back down. So at t=2.5, it's back at ground level.

So the change in displacement is from 16 feet to 0 feet, which is a change of -16 feet. The time interval is 0.5 seconds. So average velocity is (-16 ft) divided by 0.5 s. Let me do that division: -16 / 0.5 is -32 ft/s. Wait, but hold on—is that right?

Wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Because when I plug t=2 into y=40t-16t², I get 40*2=80, minus 16*(4)=64. 80-64 is 16, correct. Then t=2.5: 40*2.5 is 100, 16*(6.25) is 100, so 100-100=0. So the difference in position is 0 - 16 = -16 feet. Divided by 0.5 seconds, so average velocity is -32 ft/s.

Looking at the options, option B is -32 ft/s, which seems to match. But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Hmm... 40*2.5 is indeed 100. 16*(2.5)^2: 2.5 squared is 6.25, multiplied by 16 is 100. So 100-100 is 0. So yeah, displacement is -16. Time is 0.5. So -16 / 0.5 is -32. So the velocity is -32 ft/s. That should be option B.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, average velocity can also be expressed as the derivative at the midpoint, but since this is a quadratic function, maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the velocity function and integrate, but that's more for instantaneous velocity. Since the question asks for average, using the displacement over time is correct.

So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is B: -32 ft/s.

To find the average velocity during the time period from t=2 to t=2.5 seconds, we calculate the change in position divided by the change in time. 

1. **Position at t=2**:  
   \( y(2) = 40(2) - 16(2)^2 = 80 - 64 = 16 \, \text{ft} \).

2. **Position at t=2.5**:  
   \( y(2.5) = 40(2.5) - 16(2.5)^2 = 100 - 100 = 0 \, \text{ft} \).

3. **Change in position**:  
   \( \Delta y = 0 - 16 = -16 \, \text{ft} \).

4. **Change in time**:  
   \( \Delta t = 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 \, \text{s} \).

5. **Average velocity**:  
   \( \text{Average velocity} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{-16}{0.5} = -32 \, \text{ft/s} \).

The correct answer is **B: -32 ft/s**.
