Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about fiscal policy combinations and their impact on real GDP. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which combination of fiscal policy changes would slowly increase real GDP without causing a huge rise in the price level. Real GDP growth is about economic output, and a price level increase would mean inflation. So the goal is to have slow economic growth without inflation.

Fiscal policy refers to government spending and taxation. The two main tools are expansionary and contractionary policies. Expansionary policies are those that increase real GDP, while contractionary ones reduce it. The question is about the best way to achieve expansion without inflation.

Looking at the options:

A: Increase government spending with no change in taxes. That's expansionary. Increases GSP, so real GDP should rise. But since taxes aren't changing, people's disposable income goes up. This should lead to inflation over time because higher spending without price increases.

B: Increase spending and a matching decrease in taxes. So both GSP and taxes go up by the same amount. This should also lead to expansionary. But since both are increasing, it's a bit of a mix. I'm not sure if it's better than just increasing spending alone.

C: Increase taxes and decrease spending. So taxes go up, meaning less disposable income, and government spending goes down. This would reduce GSP, which is bad for real GDP. So this would likely slow down growth.

D: Decrease spending and no change in taxes. So GSP decreases, leading to lower real GDP. Also, since taxes don't change, people's disposable income remains the same, which might not help with growth.

E: Decrease taxes and no change in spending. GSP decreases, so real GDP might drop. But since taxes are going down, people's disposable income goes up, which could stimulate spending. But overall, if taxes are reduced, it's an expansionary policy, and real GDP would increase. However, the question is about preventing inflation, so I'm not sure if a decrease in taxes would cause too much of a price increase.

F: No tax change and decrease spending. So GSP goes down. This would reduce real GDP. Not good for the question's goal.

G: Decrease spending and a matching increase in taxes. So both GSP and taxes go up. But spending is down, so that's bad. But taxes are up, so disposable income is higher. Maybe this could lead to a mixed effect. If GSP decreases, real GDP might slow, but higher taxes could lead to lower consumption, which might not be as bad as just spending down. Not sure.

H: No change in spending, but increase in taxes. So GSP stays the same, but taxes up. That would reduce disposable income, leading to lower consumption. So real GDP might slow down, but perhaps not as much as just spending down.

I: Increase taxes and increase spending. Both tax and GSP go up. So expansionary. But since both are increasing, it's a bit of a balance. If both are up, maybe the increase in spending helps, but the higher taxes could drive up prices.

J: Decrease taxes and increase spending. GSP goes up, so real GDP increases. But taxes are decreased, so disposable income goes up, which might stimulate spending. But the question is about preventing inflation—so perhaps this is a good combo.

Wait, the goal is to increase real GDP slowly without causing inflation. So all options that reduce GSP are bad. So options D, F, and others that reduce GSP are not good.

Looking at options B and E. Option E is decrease taxes and no change in spending. So GSP is same. Taxes are decreased, so disposable income is higher. People might spend more, which could stimulate real GDP, but since taxes are lower, maybe it's a contractionary effect. Wait, no—tax decrease is expansionary. So with taxes down, spending increases.

Option E: No change in spending, decrease taxes. So GSP remains same, but disposable income is higher. Since GSP doesn't change, but taxes go down, spending would go up. So GSP is same, so real GDP doesn't increase. Hmm, that's not good. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, wait. If taxes are decreased, that's a contractionary policy. Because if taxes are lower, people have more disposable income, so they spend more. So GSP would go up. But if GSP is not changed, the output would go up. So that's a contractionary, leading to lower real GDP. So that's bad for the question's goal.

Option E is decrease taxes and no change in spending. So GSP doesn't change, but since taxes are lower, people's income goes up, leading to more spending. So GSP remains same, but spending increases. This would lead to an increase in real GDP because people are spending more, but GSP isn't. So it's a situation where the economy is expanding, but the government isn't increasing spending. So it's a bit tricky. Because if taxes are lower, it's a contractionary, but since GSP isn't changing, the economy might be overextended. Or maybe it's a mix of contractionary and expansionary.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the effects. Let's think about the multiplier effect. If taxes are decreased, people have more disposable income, so they spend more, which increases GSP. So GSP increases, which should lead to real GDP. But if GSP is not changing, that's a problem. So in option E, GSP is same, but taxes are decreased. So, net effect: GSP increases, but it's not a net change. So, how does this play out?

Alternatively, in option B, both GSP and taxes go up. So that's expansionary. So when taxes are up, it's a contractionary, but GSP is up. So how does that balance? It's a bit unclear.

Wait, the question is about which combination would increase real GDP without causing inflation. So the ideal is a policy that increases GSP without increasing T too much.

Looking at options, maybe option E is a good one. Let's reevaluate.

Option E: Decrease taxes, no change in spending. So GSP remains the same, but taxes go down, so people's disposable income goes up. That should lead to increased consumption and thus increased GSP. So if GSP increases, real GDP goes up, but T doesn't change. So it's a bit unclear—could it be a mix of expansionary and contractionary?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the overall effect. A decrease in taxes would lead to an increase in GSP because people have more money to spend. So, even if GSP isn't changing, because taxes are being reduced, the economy is expanding. But I'm not sure how that works.

Wait, another approach: the correct answer is probably option E. Because both tax decrease and GSP decrease would lead to a decrease in T = contractionary, but GSP doesn't change. So GSP is same, but T is lower, so it's a contractionary. But the question is about a policy combination that increases GDP without causing inflation.

Another thought: if you decrease taxes, you can stimulate GSP because people have more disposable income. So, if you just decrease taxes, GSP would increase, leading to real GDP. But the question says "slowly increase real GDP," so maybe it's a gradual decrease in taxes. So, if taxes are decreased, and GSP is decreased, but the decrease is gradual, then perhaps the economy is able to expand without high inflation.

Wait, but that's option E. So E is decreasing taxes with no change in spending.

Another thought: if you decrease taxes, people have more income. They might spend more, so GSP increases. But if you don't change spending, then GSP increases, leading to real GDP.

But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E.

Alternatively, option G: Decrease spending with a matching increase in taxes.

So both GSP and T go up. So if T increases, that's contractionary. So people have less disposable income, which would lead to lower spending. So GSP would decrease. But the question is about increasing real GDP, so that's bad.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is option E. Because in E, taxes are decreased, so people's income goes up, leading to more spending, which increases GSP. But GSP doesn't change. So it's a situation where the economy is expanding, but GSP is same. So perhaps it's a bit of a mix, but I think that's considered part of expansionary policy. So the impact on real GDP would be positive, but not necessarily about inflation.

Wait, but if spending is fixed, and people's disposable income increases, that could lead to higher consumption and thus higher GSP, but the policy doesn't change GSP. So the economy would expand because people are spending more. But that's a bit of a tricky situation. Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is option E. Because when you decrease taxes, you're increasing the money supply, which can stimulate spending without changing GSP, leading to higher real GDP.

Another angle: According to the Keynesian model, expansionary fiscal policies (increase in GSP) like option B or E would increase real GDP. But the question is about policies that don't cause inflation. So if you just decrease taxes without changing GSP, the economy might start expanding, but if taxes are decreased, there's potential for high inflation.

Wait, but in option E, GSP is same. So if GSP doesn't change, but taxes are decreased, the economy would expand because people can spend more. But since GSP is same, maybe real GDP doesn't increase. Or perhaps it does because the multiplier effect is working.

Another thought: let's think about the multiplier. In option E, since GSP doesn't change, and taxes are decreased, the economy is expanding because of the increased disposable income. So the increase in T could lead to an increase in GSP, but since GSP isn't changing, perhaps the economy grows. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that contractionary policies (like option H or G) would decrease real GDP, which is not what we want.

So the options that increase GSP are B, E, I, J.

Option I: Increase taxes and GSP increase. That would be a contractionary policy, leading to lower real GDP.

Option J: Decrease taxes and GSP increase. So T decreases, GSP up. That's a contractionary (since T is lower) and an expansionary (GSP up). So the net effect is a possible decrease in T and GSP up. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the impact of each.

Option B: GSP up, T same. So expansionary. Both GSP and T go up. So both are expansionary. So GSP increases, so real GDP increases.

Option E: T decreases, GSP same. So T lowers, so people have more disposable income, so they spend more. So GSP would increase. So GSP increases, so real GDP increases.

But the question is about a combination that would increase real GDP without putting upward pressure on prices.

So which of these would lead to higher real GDP without causing inflation? I think option E is a good candidate because it's a contractionary policy on taxes, which can lead to increased spending. But wait, contractionary policies usually lead to lower GDP, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe option E is a correct answer because it's a contractionary policy on taxes, but since GSP is same, the economy might be overextended. Or perhaps it's a mix of increasing GSP and decreasing T, which could be a good strategy.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's think about an example. If the government reduces taxes, people have more money to spend. So GSP increases. If GSP doesn't change, but T is decreased, then the economy is expanding because of increased spending. So real GDP would go up. However, if GSP remains the same, but T is decreased, perhaps the economy is able to grow, but with perhaps more spending.

But the options are about combinations. So for example, if you have a mixture of increasing GSP and decreasing T, then GSP increases, making real GDP go up. So that's option B.

But the question says "slowly increase real GDP without putting upward pressure on price level." So perhaps a situation where GSP increases, but T doesn't change, so the economy can grow.

Wait, another approach: the classical model says that contractionary policies (like tax cuts) can lead to higher real GDP if the economy has excess capacity. So, if taxes are cut, GSP increases, leading to higher real GDP. So if the government cuts taxes to stimulate the economy, that's a contractionary policy. But in this case, the question is about policies that would increase GDP, so maybe a contractionary policy that's slow to take effect.

Wait, but the question is about a combination of policies. So perhaps the correct answer is option E. Because in E, taxes are decreased, but real GSP increases because of the higher disposable income, which leads to more spending. So that's a contractionary policy on taxes, but with GSP not changing, perhaps the economy can expand.

Alternatively, another thought: If the government increases taxes, it's a contractionary policy, which would reduce real GDP and cause prices to rise. So that's bad.

So, the options that increase real GDP without causing inflation are options that either increase GSP without increasing T, or policies that mix expansion with contraction but don't lead to over-inflation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E. Because if you decrease taxes and keep GSP the same, people can spend more, which drives up GSP, leading to real GDP increase. But since GSP isn't changing, perhaps the economy doesn't contract and continues to grow.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: the correct answer is option E because it's a contractionary policy on taxes, but since GSP doesn't change, GSP is same, so real GDP doesn't increase. Hmm, that contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E because it's a contractionary policy on taxes, which can lead to higher real GDP if not too aggressive.

I think I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should recall that the correct answer is option E. Because in E, taxes are decreased, which can lead to increased spending, thus increasing GSP and real GDP. So the answer is E.

To determine the fiscal policy combination that would slowly increase real GDP without putting upward pressure on the price level, we analyze the given options:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Expansionary Policy**: Increases GSP (Government Spending) or decreases taxes to stimulate economic growth.
2. **Contractionary Policy**: Decreases GSP or increases taxes to slow economic growth and control inflation.
3. The goal is a slow increase in real GDP while preventing inflation.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A: Increase Government Spending with No Change in Taxes**  
  Expansionary, leads to increased GSP, causing inflation. Not suitable.

- **Option B: Increase Government Spending with a Matching Decrease in Taxes**  
  Both policies increase GSP, leading to inflation. Not suitable.

- **Option C: Increase Taxes with a Decrease in Government Spending**  
  Contractionary, reduces GSP, leading to slower growth and inflation. Not suitable.

- **Option D: Decrease Government Spending with No Change in Taxes**  
  Contractionary, reduces GSP, leading to slower growth and inflation. Not suitable.

- **Option E: Decrease Taxes with No Change in Government Spending**  
  Expansionary, increases GSP due to higher disposable income, leading to real GDP growth without significant inflation. This is a good combination.

- **Option F: No Change in Taxes with a Decrease in Government Spending**  
  Contractionary, reduces GSP, leading to slower growth and inflation. Not suitable.

- **Option G: Decrease Government Spending with a Matching Increase in Taxes**  
  Contractionary, increases T, leading to lower GSP and inflation. Not suitable.

- **Option H: No Change in Government Spending with an Increase in Taxes**  
  Expansionary, increases T, leading to higher inflation and slower GDP growth. Not suitable.

- **Option I: Increase Taxes with a Matching Increase in Government Spending**  
  Contractionary, reduces GSP, leading to slower growth and inflation. Not suitable.

- **Option J: Decrease Taxes with a Matching Increase in Government Spending**  
  Contractionary, increases T, leading to higher inflation and slower GDP growth. Not suitable.

### Conclusion:
Option **E** is the best choice. Decreasing taxes increases disposable income, leading to increased spending and GSP, which slowly drives real GDP growth without causing inflation. This combination aligns with the goal of expansionary fiscal policy.
