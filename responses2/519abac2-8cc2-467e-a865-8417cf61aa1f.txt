Okay, so I've got this question about organ pipes and harmonics. Hmm, I remember that organ pipes can be open or closed, and the harmonics produced depend on their end conditions. The question says the pipe is open at both ends and the first five harmonics are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. The question is asking which of these harmonics will survive if the pipe is closed at one end.

Wait, I think when a pipe is open at both ends, the harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency. Like, if the fundamental is f, then the harmonics are f, 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, etc. So in this example, the first five are 50 Hz, 100, 150, 200, 250. That makes sense because 50 Hz is the fundamental, then each is a multiple.

But when the pipe is closed at one end, the harmonics are a bit different. I recall that for a closed pipe, the harmonics are the odd multiples of the fundamental. So the possible frequencies are 1f, 3f, 5f, 7f, etc. But wait, the question is about the harmonics of the pipe's original open state. Oh, right, the question says the harmonics are from the open pipe, but once the pipe is closed, which of those will survive.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. The pipe is open at both ends, so it's an open-open pipe. The harmonics are multiples of the fundamental. Each harmonic is n*f, where n is 1,2,3, etc. But when it's closed at one end, the harmonics are the odd multiples of the fundamental. But the question is about whether the harmonics of the open pipe will survive when the pipe is closed.

Wait, the question says the first five harmonics of the open pipe are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 Hz. So the fundamental is 50 Hz. So when the pipe is closed, which harmonics are present?

Wait, the closed pipe's harmonics are 1f, 3f, 5f, 7f, etc. So let me calculate each:

f = 50 Hz.

So 1f = 50 Hz (which is one of the harmonics in the open pipe), 3f = 150 Hz, 5f=250 Hz, 7f=350 Hz, 9f=450 Hz, 11f=550, etc.

But wait, the question is about which of the first five harmonics (50,100,150,200,250) will survive when the pipe is closed. So when the pipe is closed, the harmonics that are allowed are the odd multiples of the fundamental. So in the open pipe, the first five harmonics are all multiples of 50. So when the pipe is closed, the allowed harmonics are 50, 150, 250, etc.—i.e., the odd multiples of 50.

Looking at the options:

The harmonics of the open pipe that can exist in a closed pipe are the odd multiples of the fundamental. So, the first five harmonics of the open pipe are 50 (n=1), 100 (n=2), 150 (n=3), 200 (n=4), 250 (n=5). When the pipe is closed, the allowed harmonics are the odd multiples of 50. So 50 (which is 1×50), 150 (3×50), 250 (5×50). So the even multiples (like 100 and 200) would be even harmonics, but when closed, they don't exist because the pipe is closed.

Wait, but the question says the pipe is closed, so which harmonics will survive in the new setup. The initial harmonics in the open pipe are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250. When the pipe is closed, the allowed harmonics are the odd multiples: 50 (1×50), 150 (3×50), 250 (5×50), etc. So 50 and 250 are odd multiples. But wait, 100 and 200 are the even multiples. But in the original open pipe, the even multiples (100, 200) are present, but when closed, the even harmonics (like 2f, 4f, etc.) are not allowed. Because for a closed pipe, the harmonics are 1f, 3f,5f, etc.

So the open harmonics that survive in the closed pipe are the ones that are odd multiples of the fundamental. So in the open harmonics (50 Hz, 100, 150, 200, 250), the allowed ones when the pipe is closed are 50, 150, 250. Because 100 and 200 are even multiples, and the closed pipe doesn't have those.

Wait, but the question is which of the harmonics (from the original open pipe) will survive. So the question is, which of the given options (A to J) are the harmonics that will survive in a closed pipe.

So the original harmonics are 50,100,150,200,250. But when closed, the allowed harmonics are 50,150,250.

So in the options, which ones are these? Looking at the options:

Option E: nan (probably not relevant here, but I'm not sure if it's an option here)
Option J: 50,150,250 Hz only—yes, that's our case.

Wait, but why? Let me think again. The problem statement says: "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Actually, the question is about which of the original harmonics will survive in the closed pipe. So the original harmonics are 50, 100, 150, 200,250 Hz.

When the pipe is closed, only the harmonics that are odd multiples of the fundamental f are allowed. So f is 50. So the allowed harmonics are 50 (1×50), 150 (3×50), 250 (5×50), etc. So in the original open harmonics, the allowed ones are 50, 150, 250. So the correct option would be J: 50,150,250 Hz only.

Looking at the options, option J is '50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only'—so the correct answer is J.

The organ pipe is open at both ends, producing harmonics that are multiples of the fundamental frequency. The first five harmonics are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. When the pipe is closed at one end, the harmonics allowed are the odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. Since the fundamental is 50 Hz, the allowed harmonics are 50 Hz (1×50 Hz), 150 Hz (3×50 Hz), and 250 Hz (5×50 Hz). 

Among the given options:

- **Option J (50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only)** matches the allowed harmonics when the pipe is closed.  
- Other options (A to F) either include or exclude incorrect harmonics or are unrelated.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only**.
