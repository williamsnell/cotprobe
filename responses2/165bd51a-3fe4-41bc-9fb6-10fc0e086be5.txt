Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question says I walked my dog 7/9 miles in the morning and 5/12 miles in the afternoon. And the question is, how much farther did I walk in the morning than in the afternoon. Oh wait, wait, actually, no, wait. Wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "How much farther did you walk your dog in the morning than in the afternoon?" So it's asking for the difference between the morning and afternoon walks.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem states: "You walked your dog 7 over 9 mi in the morning and 5 over 12 mi in the afternoon. How much farther did you walk your dog in the morning than in the afternoon?"

So the difference is 7/9 minus 5/12. Because the question is asking how much more the morning walk was compared to the afternoon.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe I'm supposed to find the difference between the two walks. Oh, but the question says, "how much farther did you walk your dog in the morning than in the afternoon." So that's the difference between morning and afternoon.

Wait, let me make sure. So it's 7/9 - 5/12. Because the morning walk was longer, right? Because 7/9 is about 0.778, and 5/12 is about 0.417. So the difference is around 0.361 miles. But let me calculate it properly.

To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 9 and 12. What's the least common multiple of 9 and 12? Well, 9 is 3^2, 12 is 2^2 *3. So LCM is 2^2 *3^2 = 4*9=36.

So convert both fractions to 36ths.

7/9 = (7*4)/(9*4) = 28/36.

5/12 = (5*3)/(12*3) = 15/36.

Now subtract: 28/36 - 15/36 = (28-15)/36 = 13/36.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking how much farther in the morning, so it's the difference. So the answer would be 13/36 miles. Looking at the options, option G is 13 over 36. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, no. Because the question says, "how much farther did you walk your dog in the morning than in the afternoon." So the difference is in the morning minus afternoon, which is 13/36. So that's the answer.

The problem requires calculating the difference between the morning and afternoon walks. 

1. Convert the fractions to a common denominator (36):
   - 7/9 = 28/36
   - 5/12 = 15/36

2. Subtract the afternoon distance from the morning distance:
   - 28/36 - 15/36 = 13/36

Thus, the dog walked 13/36 miles farther in the morning than in the afternoon.
