Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

Point A is at -20 on the number line, and point B is 5 less than point A. I need to figure out where B is located and whether it's to the left or right of A. Then, I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let's break down the information step by step. Point A is at -20. Point B is 5 less than A. Wait, so if A is -20, then B is A minus 5, right? So I should calculate that. 

So, B = A - 5. Substituting A's value, that's -20 -5. Let me compute that. 20 minus 5 is 15, but since both are negative, it's -25. So point B is at -25. 

Now, I need to see where -25 is on the number line compared to A, which is at -20. Since -25 is less than -20, B is to the left of A. Because the number line goes from left to right, increasing as you go right. So -25 comes before -20 on the line.

Looking at the options, I should find the one that says B is at -25 and is to the left of A. Let's look at the options:

Option D: It's at -25 and is to the left of A. So that's correct.

But wait, let me check the other options too to make sure. 

Option B: -30 and right. No, because 5 less than -20 is -25, not -30. So B is -25, not -30. So B is incorrect.

Option E: -30 and left. Nope, same reason as B. 

Option J: 5 and left. No, because 5 is positive, and A is at -20. So J is wrong.

So D seems correct. 

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I got the subtraction right. B is 5 less than A. So A is -20. 5 less than A would mean subtracting 5. So yes, -20 -5 is -25. So B is -25.

So the location is at -25, which is to the left of A (-20) because -25 is more negative. So the statement about B is "located at -25 and is to the left of A on the number line."

Looking at the options, D matches that.

Alternatively, let's think of it as a number line. A is at -20. Moving to the left decreases the value. So 5 less than A would be moving further left by 5 units. So from -20, moving 5 steps left gets you to -25. So yes, B is at -25 and is to the left of A.

Another way: if B is 5 less than A, then B = A - 5, which is -20 -5 = -25. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.

Answer: D
