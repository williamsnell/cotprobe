Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

There are 25 suitcases, 5 of which are damaged. We're selecting 3 at random, and we need to find the probability that exactly 2 are damaged. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, probability problems can be a bit tricky, but I think I can work through it. Let me recall how to approach this. It sounds like a hypergeometric distribution problem, where we're dealing with successes (damaged suitcases) and failures (undamaged ones) without replacement.

So, the formula for hypergeometric probability is:

P = (number of ways to choose the successes) × (number of ways to choose the failures) / (total number of ways to choose the sample)

In this case, the "successes" are the damaged suitcases, and "failures" are the undamaged ones.

Let me break it down. The total number of suitcases is 25, with 5 damaged. So, the number of undamaged suitcases is 25 - 5 = 20.

We're choosing 3 suitcases. We want exactly 2 damaged and 1 undamaged.

So, the number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases from 5 is the combination of 5 choose 2, which is written as C(5,2). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 1 undamaged suitcase from 20 is C(20,1).

The total number of ways to choose any 3 suitcases from 25 is C(25,3).

So, P = [C(5,2) × C(20,1)] / C(25,3)

Let me compute each part.

First, C(5,2). The formula for combinations is n!/(k!(n-k)!).

C(5,2) = 5!/(2! * (5-2)!) = (5×4×3!)/(2×1×3!) = (20)/2 = 10.

Wait, or is that right? Wait, 5×4 is 20, divided by 2 is 10. Yep, correct.

Next, C(20,1). That's just 20, since choosing 1 from 20 is 20 ways.

So, numerator is 10 × 20 = 200.

Denominator is C(25,3). Let's compute that. 25!/(3! *22! ) = (25×24×23)/(3×2×1) = (25×24×23)/6.

Calculating numerator: 25×24=600; 600×23=13800. Then divided by 6: 13800 /6 = 2300.

So denominator is 2300.

So P = 200 / 2300. Let's simplify that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 200/2300 = 2/23.

Wait, that's option F, which is 2/23. So that's the probability.

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations.

C(5,2) is indeed 10. C(20,1) is 20. 10×20=200.

C(25,3) is (25×24×23)/(3×2×1) = (25×24×23)/6. Let's compute that again.

25 ×24=600, 600 ×23=13800. 13800 divided by 6 is 2300. Yes, that's correct.

So 200/2300 simplifies to 2/23. So the probability is 2/23, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options again, F is 2/23. Yes. So the correct answer should be F.

The probability is calculated using the hypergeometric distribution. The number of ways to choose 2 damaged out of 5 is C(5,2)=10, and 1 undamaged out of 20 is C(20,1)=20. The total ways are C(25,3)=2300. Thus, the probability is 200/2300 = 2/23, which is option F.

Answer: F
