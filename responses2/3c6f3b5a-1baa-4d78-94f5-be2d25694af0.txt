Alright, so I've got this question here about property taxes. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about calculating the tax on a house. The market value is $18,400, the assessed value is 65% of that, and the tax rate is $4.57 per $100. Hmm, I need to find the total tax.

First, I think I need to find the assessed value. The assessed value is 65% of the market value. So, I can calculate that by multiplying 18,400 by 0.65. Let me do that.

18,400 * 0.65. Let me break it down. 18,400 * 0.6 is 11,040, and 18,400 * 0.05 is 920. Adding those together gives me 11,960. So the assessed value is $11,960.

Now, the tax rate is $4.57 per $100. To find the total tax, I have to see how many $100 units are in the assessed value and then multiply by the tax rate.

Let me calculate how many hundreds are in $11,960. I can divide 11,960 by 100, which is 119.6. So that's 119.6 hundreds.

Now, multiply that by $4.57 per hundred. Let me compute 119.6 * 4.57.

Hmm, I might need to multiply that step by step. Let's break it down.

First, 100 * 4.57 = 457.00
Then, 19 * 4.57. Let's see:

19 * 4.57: 10*4.57 is 45.70, 9*4.57 is 41.13. Adding those: 45.70 +41.13= 86.83.

Then, 0.6 *4.57 is 2.742.

Adding all together: 457.00 + 86.83 is 543.83, plus 2.742 is 546.572.

So the total tax is approximately $546.57. Looking at the options, option J is $546.57.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Assessed value calculation: 18,400 * 0.65. Let me confirm that. 18,400 * 0.6 is 11,040, and 18,400 * 0.05 is 920. So 11,040 + 920 = 11,960. That's correct.

Tax calculation: 11,960 / 100 = 119.6. 119.6 *4.57. Let me re-calculate that. Breaking it down:

100 *4.57 = 457
19 *4.57 = 86.83 (as before)
0.6 *4.57 = 2.742

Adding 457 +86.83 = 543.83, plus 2.742 gives 546.572, which rounds to 546.57. So the correct answer is J.

The assessed value is 65% of $18,400, which is $11,960. Dividing by $100 gives 119.6 hundreds. Multiplying by $4.57 per hundred gives $546.57. Thus, the correct answer is J.

Answer: J: $546.57
