Question:

Carmen spends her entire weekly income on two goods: X and Y. At her current consumption level of the two goods, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good X is 5 and the marginal utility of the last dollar she spent on good Y is 10. To maximize her utility, Carmen should

C: maintain her current consumption level but seek cheaper prices
D: buy fewer units of both X and Y
E: buy more units of both X and Y
F: buy more units of X and less units of Y
G: buy equal amounts of X and Y
H: maintain her current consumption level of the two goods
I: stop buying X and only buy Y
J: buy fewer units of Y and more units of X

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about Carmen and her spending on two goods, X and Y. The question is about maximizing her utility. Hmm, I remember that utility maximization involves the principle that the last dollar spent on each good should have the same marginal utility. Oh right, so the marginal utility per dollar should be equal for both goods.

The problem says Carmen spends her entire weekly income on X and Y. At her current consumption level, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on X is 5, and on Y it's 10. Wait, so the MUX is 5 and MUY is 10. But wait, that can't be right because I thought MUX should equal MUY for maximum utility.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. So let me think. The idea is that the ratio of the marginal utilities should equal the ratio of the prices. Oh, right, the condition is MUX/MUy = PX/PY. So if MUX is 5 and MUy is 10, then 5/10 equals PX/PY. So PX/PY would be 0.5. That means PX is half of PY. So PX is cheaper than PY.

So if PX is less than PY, that means good X is relatively more affordable. So for maximizing utility, she should buy more of X and less of Y. Because the last dollar spent on X gives more utility than the last dollar spent on Y. Or wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, marginal utility per dollar is MUX/PX and MUY/PY. So if MUX/PX equals MUY/PY, she's at the optimal. Otherwise, she should adjust.

In this case, MUX is 5, and MUy is 10. So MUX/PX is 5/PX, and MUY/PY is 10/PY. So if 5/PX equals 10/PY, then PX is half of PY, right.

So she should buy more of X and less of Y. Because the utility per dollar is better on X. So the correct answer would be buying more X and less Y.

Looking at the options: E says buy more X and less Y. So that's option E.

Wait, let me make sure. The question says she wants to maximize her utility. So the condition is MUX/PX = MUY/PY. If that's the case, she's already at the optimal. But wait, in the problem, MUX is 5 and MUy is 10. So 5/PX = 10/PY. That would imply that PX is (5/10)*PY = 0.5 * PY. So PX is cheaper than PY.

So she should buy more X and less Y. So the correct choice is E.

To maximize her utility, Carmen should allocate her spending such that the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good is equal. At her current consumption level, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on X is 5, and on Y is 10. Since MUX/PX = 5/PX and MUY/PY = 10/PY, the ratio of marginal utilities to prices is 5/PX = 10/PY. This implies that PX is half of PY, meaning X is relatively cheaper. Therefore, Carmen should buy more of X and less of Y to equalize the marginal utility per dollar.

The correct answer is:

E: buy more units of both X and Y.

Wait, no. Let me check again. If PX is cheaper, she should buy more of X and less of Y. So the correct option is E.
