Question:

\lim_{x \to c} |f(x)| = 0. What is \lim_{x \to c} f(x)?

Options:

A: \infty (infinity)
B: Does not exist

D: Undefined
E: -1
F: c
G: |c|
H: 0
I: -c
J: \frac{1}{c} (1 over c)

Okay, so I have this limit problem here. The question says that the limit as x approaches c of the absolute value of f(x) is zero. And I need to figure out what the limit of f(x) as x approaches c is. The options are A through J, which include various possibilities like infinity, does not exist, 1, undefined, etc.

Wait, let's think. The absolute value of f(x) is approaching zero. So |f(x)| → 0 as x → c. That means that f(x) itself must be getting closer and closer to zero because the absolute value can't be negative. So if |f(x)| is going to zero, f(x) must be approaching zero. Because if |f(x)| approaches zero, then f(x) can't approach any non-zero value, because the absolute value would then approach that non-zero value, not zero.

So for example, if f(x) approached 5, then |f(x)| would approach 5, but that's not the case here. So the only possibility is that f(x) approaches zero. So the limit of f(x) as x approaches c should be zero.

Looking at the options, H is 0. So that's the answer. Let me just double-check. If f(x) approached a non-zero value, then |f(x)| would approach that value, which is not zero. So the only way |f(x)| can approach zero is if f(x) itself approaches zero. So yes, the limit of f(x) is zero.

The correct answer is H: 0.

**Answer: H: 0**
