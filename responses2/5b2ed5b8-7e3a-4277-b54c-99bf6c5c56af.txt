Okay, so I have this question about a stock option that Janet Firestone bought. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the question says Janet purchased an option on a stock for $175. The option gives her the right to buy 100 shares at 14 and a half, which is $14.50 per share. Then, one month later, she exercised her option, meaning she bought those 100 shares at $14.50. 

One month after buying the option, she sold the stock on the same day for $17. So, she sold the 100 shares at $17 each. Let me calculate how much she made from selling the stock.

Each share sold at $17, so 100 shares would give her 100 * $17 = $1700. But she bought them for $14.50 each, so the cost was 100 * $14.50 = $1450. 

Now, subtracting the cost from the revenue: $1700 - $1450 = $250. That's the profit from selling the stock. But wait, she also bought the option for $175. Oh, right, so the total profit is the difference between the proceeds from selling the stock and the cost of the option.

Wait, no. The profit is the money she made from selling minus the cost of the option. So, she spent $175 to buy the option, and then she made $1700 from selling 100 shares. So her net profit is $1700 - $175 = $1525? That seems way too high, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe the option is a call option. When she exercised, she paid $14.50 per share for 100 shares. So, the cost is 100 * 14.50 = $1450. Then she sold 100 shares at $17 each, which gives $1700. So, the profit would be $1700 - $1450 = $250. But wait, she also spent $175 to buy the option. So, does the $175 apply separately?

Wait, perhaps she bought the option for $175, and then she sold it for $1700. So, the profit from the option is $1700 - $175 = $1525. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says "her profit on the stock." So perhaps it's just the profit from selling the stock, not considering the option purchase. So, she sold the stock for $17 per share, making $1700 on 100 shares. She bought the stock for $14.50, so the profit per share is $17 - $14.50 = $2.50. For 100 shares: 100 * $2.50 = $250. So her profit from the stock is $250. But wait, she also spent $175 to buy the option. So, does that affect her profit?

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the net profit from exercising the option and selling the stock, considering the cost of the option. So, she bought the option for $175 and sold it for $1700, making $1525. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the $175 is considered as part of the cost for the option, and she only sells the stock. So, the profit is the selling price minus the option cost.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "what was her profit on the stock?" So I think it's the profit from selling the stock, not considering the cost of the option. So, she sold 100 shares at $17 each, making $1700, and bought them at $14.50 each, which costs $1450. So her profit from the stock is $250.

Looking at the options, I see option C is $250. So that's probably the answer.

The profit from exercising the option and selling the stock is calculated by subtracting the cost of the shares from the revenue from selling them. Each share was sold for $17, yielding $1700 for 100 shares. The cost was $14.50 per share, totaling $1450. The profit is $1700 - $1450 = $250. 

Answer: C: $250.
