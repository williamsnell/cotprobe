Alright, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Beame investing $400 in a bank that gives 3% interest compounded semiannually. The question is asking how much interest he got after two years. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the compound interest for this scenario.

Let me think about the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount, which is $400 here.
- r is the annual interest rate, which is 3% or 0.03 in decimal.
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded semiannually, that's twice a year, so n is 2.
- t is the time the money is invested for, which is 2 years.

Wait, wait, but the question is asking for the interest earned, not the total amount. So maybe I should calculate A first and then subtract the principal to find the interest.

So plugging the numbers in:
A = 400 * (1 + 0.03/2)^(2*2)
Calculating the denominator first: 2*2 is 4. So the exponent is 4.

Then, 0.03/2 is 0.015. Adding 1 gives 1.015.

So it becomes 400 * (1.015)^4.

Wait, I need to compute (1.015)^4. Let me calculate that step by step. 1.015 squared is approximately 1.030225. Then squared again for the fourth power: 1.030225 squared. Let me compute that.

1.030225 * 1.030225. Let's see, 1 * 1 = 1. 0.03 * 1.03 is 0.0309, but wait, maybe it's easier to compute as (1 + 0.030225)^2 = 1 + 2*0.030225 + (0.030225)^2.

Wait, 2*0.030225 is 0.06045. (0.030225)^2 is approximately 0.0009135. So adding those together: 1 + 0.06045 + 0.0009135 ≈ 1.0613635.

So (1.015)^4 is approximately 1.0613635.

Wait, but wait, I think my approach might be a bit off. Let me compute it more accurately using a calculator step.

Alternatively, I can compute (1.015)^4 directly. Let's compute 1.015 squared: 1.015 * 1.015. 1 * 1 = 1, 1 * 0.015 is 0.015, 0.015 * 1 is 0.015, and 0.015 * 0.015 is 0.000225. So adding those terms: 1 + 0.015 + 0.015 + 0.000225 = 1.030225.

Now, square that again: 1.030225 * 1.030225.

Let me compute this as (1 + 0.030225)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.030225 + (0.030225)^2 = 1 + 0.06045 + 0.0009135 ≈ 1.0613635.

So (1.015)^4 ≈1.0613635.

Therefore, A is 400 * 1.0613635 ≈ 400 * 1.0613635.

Calculating that: 400 * 1 is 400, 400 * 0.06 is 24, 400 * 0.0013635 is about 0.5454. So adding them together: 400 +24=424, plus 0.5454 is about 424.5454.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 400 * 1.0613635 is 400 * 1.0613635.

Alternatively, let me compute 400 * 1.0613635 exactly. 

1.0613635 times 400.

Breaking it down:

1.0613635 × 400 = (1 × 400) + (0.0613635 × 400) = 400 + (24.5454) = 424.5454.

So A ≈ $424.55.

But wait, that can't be right because 3% annually compounded semiannually would lead to a higher amount. Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait a second, 400 at 3% semiannual compounding for 2 years. Let me calculate the interest step by step.

Each period is 6 months, so each period has 1.5% interest.

After the first year (two periods):
400 * 1.015^2. Let me compute that.

1.015 squared is 1.030225, so 400 *1.030225= 412.09.

After the second year (another two periods):
412.09 *1.015^2 = 412.09 * 1.030225.

Hmm, let me compute 412.09 * 1.030225.

Wait, maybe I can compute 412.09 * 1.030225 as 412.09 * (1 + 0.03 + 0.000225) = 412.09 + (412.09 * 0.03) + (412.09 * 0.000225).

412.09 *0.03 is 12.3627.

412.09 *0.000225 is approximately 0.092720.

So adding them: 412.09 +12.3627 = 424.4527 + 0.092720 ≈ 424.5454.

So same as before, A is approximately $424.55.

So the total amount is $424.55. But the question is about the interest earned, which is A - P. So that's 424.55 - 400 = $24.55.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $24.55. The closest option is G: $24.54, which is pretty close. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe the formula was applied incorrectly. Wait, the formula is correct, right? P(1 + r/n)^(nt).

Wait, using the formula again:

r is 3% per annum, so 0.03. n=2, t=2.

So rate per period is 0.03/2=0.015.

Number of periods: 2 *2=4.

So 400*(1.015)^4.

As I calculated earlier, 1.015^4 is approximately 1.061363. So 400 * 1.061363 is about 424.545, so interest is 24.545, which is approximately $24.55.

Looking at the options, G is $24.54, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for (1.015)^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 1.015 squared, then square that.

First, 1.015 squared:

1.015 *1.015.

Let me compute that:

1 * 1 = 1

1 * 0.015 = 0.015

0.015 *1 = 0.015

0.015 *0.015 = 0.000225.

Adding all together: 1 + 0.015 +0.015 +0.000225=1.030225.

Now, 1.030225 squared.

1.030225 *1.030225.

Let me compute that exactly.

Multiply 1.030225 ×1.030225.

Breaking it into parts:

= (1 + 0.030225)^2
= 1^2 + 2*(1)*(0.030225) + (0.030225)^2
= 1 + 0.06045 + (0.030225)*(0.030225)
Calculating (0.030225)^2:

0.03 *0.03 is 0.0009, and then 0.000225 *0.03 is 0.00000675, but wait, perhaps a better way: 

0.030225 × 0.030225:

Let me compute 0.030225 × 0.03 = 0.00090675

Then 0.030225 × 0.000225 = appr 0.000006800625

So sum: 0.00090675 + 0.000006800625 ≈ 0.00091355.

So (1.030225)^2 = 1 + 0.06045 + 0.00091355 = 1.06136355.

So yes, 1.06136355.

So 400 * 1.06136355 = ?

Compute 400 * 1.06136355.

400 *1 =400.

400 *0.06136355 = let's compute that.

0.06136355 *400.

0.06*400=24.

0.00136355 *400 = 0.54542.

So 24 + 0.54542 =24.54542.

Adding that to 400: 400 +24.54542=424.54542.

So total amount is $424.55.

Thus, interest earned is 424.55 -400= $24.55.

But looking at the options, the closest is G: $24.54.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the calculation is using simple interest or not.

Wait, no, the question says compounded semiannually, so it's compounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of (1.015)^4.

Wait, let me compute 1.015^4 step by step.

First, 1.015^2 = 1.030225.

Then, (1.030225)^2 = ?

Let me compute 1.030225 × 1.030225.

Multiply 1.03 ×1.03 = 1.0609.

But the exact calculation is:

1.030225 ×1.030225.

Let me do it digit by digit.

1.030225
×1.030225

First, multiply 1.030225 by 1.030225:

= (1 + 0.03 + 0.000225) × (1 + 0.03 + 0.000225)

I'm not sure if that's easier, but perhaps using a more precise method.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for (a + b)^2 where a=1.03 and b=0.000225.

But maybe it's faster to just accept the earlier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

1.015 ×1.015=1.030225.

Then, 1.030225 ×1.015= ?

Compute 1.030225 ×1.015:

1.030225 ×1 =1.030225.

1.030225 ×0.015=0.015453375.

Adding:1.030225 +0.015453375 = 1.045678375.

So 1.045678375 is 1.015^3.

Now, multiply that by 1.015 to get 1.015^4.

1.045678375 ×1.015.

Compute 1.045678375 ×1 =1.045678375.

1.045678375 ×0.015 = 0.015685175625.

Adding, 1.045678375 +0.015685175625= 1.061363550625.

So 1.015^4 is approximately 1.06136355.

So, 400 ×1.06136355=424.54542.

So interest is 24.54542, which is approximately $24.55.

Looking at the options, the only one close is G: $24.54.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using 3% as 0.03. Let me check: 3% is 0.03, yes. So 3/2 is 0.015 per period. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant simple interest. If it did, then the interest would be 400 *0.03 *2=24, which is $24, but that's not one of the options. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rate is compounded semi-annually, so the rate per period is 1.5%, but perhaps I should compute it as 3% per annum but compounded once a year, but that doesn't make sense. No, the question says semiannually, so it's twice a year.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is wrong. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each period step by step.

First period (6 months): $400 becomes 400 ×1.015=406.

Second period: 406 ×1.015.

Compute that: 406 ×1.015.

Well, 400 ×1.015 =406, and 6 ×1.015=6.09. So total is 406 +6.09=412.09.

Third period: 412.09 ×1.015.

Compute 412 ×1.015=412 + (412 ×0.015)=412 +6.18=418.18.

Then 0.09 ×1.015=0.09135.

So 418.18 +0.09135=418.27135.

Fourth period: 418.27135 ×1.015.

Compute 418 ×1.015=418 + (418 ×0.015)=418 +6.27=424.27.

0.27135 ×1.015≈ 0.27135 + (0.27135 ×0.015)=0.27135 +0.00407≈0.27542.

So total amount: 424.27 +0.27542=424.5454.

So the interest is 424.5454 -400=24.5454, which is approximately $24.55, but the options don't have this. The closest is G: $24.54, which is $24.54.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1.015^4.

Wait, another way: 1.015^4.

1.015 ×1.015 =1.030225.

Then, 1.030225 ×1.015.

Compute 1.030225 ×1.015:

Multiply 1.030225 by 1.015.

Compute 1.030225 *1 =1.030225.

1.030225 *0.015=0.015453375.

Add them: 1.030225 +0.015453375=1.045678375.

So 1.045678375 is 1.015^3.

Multiply by 1.015 again to get 1.015^4.

1.045678375 ×1.015.

Compute 1.045678375 ×1=1.045678375.

1.045678375 ×0.015= 0.015685175625.

Add them:1.045678375 +0.015685175625=1.061363550625.

So 1.015^4 is 1.061363550625, which when multiplied by 400:

400 ×1.061363550625 =400 ×1.06136355 +400 ×0.0000000625.

Wait, but 0.0000000625 is negligible, so it's 424.54542.

So the interest is $24.5454, which rounds to $24.55. But the options don't have that. The closest is G:24.54.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question gives 3%, but the calculation uses a different rate. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different method.

Wait another idea: perhaps the interest is calculated using simple interest but compounded, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is $24.54, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is $24.55, but that's not an option. So looking at the options, the closest is G:24.54.

Wait but wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Maybe the formula is incorrect. Let me think.

Wait, the correct formula is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt). So in this case, P=400, r=0.03, n=2, t=2.

So let me compute (1 + 0.03/2)^(2*2) = (1 +0.015)^4=1.015^4.

So 1.015^4 is approximately 1.061363.

So 400 *1.061363=424.545.

So the interest is 424.545 -400=24.545, which is about $24.55.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is G: 24.54.

But wait, perhaps the calculation is incorrect, and the correct answer is 424.545, so the interest is $24.55, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is G: 24.54.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using another method.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total amount after each period:

After first 6 months: 400 *1.015=406.

Second 6 months: 406 *1.015=412.09.

Third 6 months:412.09 *1.015=418.27135.

Fourth 6 months:418.27135 *1.015=424.5454.

Same result. So interest is 424.5454 -400=24.5454.

So 24.5454 is about $24.55, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is G:24.54.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly and compute the interest as 24.55, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is G:24.54.

Wait, but maybe I should look at the options again. The options are:

A) $40.00

B) $120.00

C) $160.00

D) $180.00

E) $24.00

F) $24.50

G) $24.54

H) $24.56

So the interest is $24.54. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but then why didn't I get the exact $24.55? Because perhaps the calculation is precise, but perhaps the options are rounded.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate the interest.

Wait, another approach: the total amount is 400*(1 + 0.03/2)^(2*2) =400*(1.015)^4.

Compute (1.015)^4:

1.015^2 =1.030225.

1.030225^2 =1.06136355.

So 400 *1.06136355 =424.5454.

So interest is 24.5454.

Which is approximately 24.55, but that's not an option. So the correct option is G:24.54.

Because 24.54 is the closest to 24.5454.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the interest to be calculated using a different method, such as simple interest on the principal, but that would not be correct for semi-annual compounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interest as 400*(0.03/2)*4=400*(0.015)*4=400*0.06=24, which is the simple interest. But that's not the case here.

So, given all that, the correct answer is G: $24.54.
</think>

Mr. Beaman invests $400 in a bank account that earns 3% interest compounded semi-annually. The interest earned after two years is calculated as follows:

1. The annual interest rate is 3%, so the semi-annual rate is 1.5%.
2. The number of compounding periods is 4 (2 years × 2 periods/year).
3. Using the compound interest formula: \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \), where \( P = 400 \), \( r = 0.03 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( t = 2 \).
4. Calculating \( \left(1 + \frac{0.03}{2}\right)^{2 \times 2} = (1.015)^4 \approx 1.061363 \).
5. The total amount is \( 400 \times 1.061363 \approx 424.545 \).
6. The interest earned is \( 424.545 - 400 = 24.545 \approx $24.55 \).

However, since the closest option available is $24.54, the correct answer is **G: $24.54**.

ANSWER: G
