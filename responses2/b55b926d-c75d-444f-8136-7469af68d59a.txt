Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about ethics and the work of John Stuart Moore. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Okay, the question is asking about the most fundamental question in all of ethics according to Moore. The options are labeled A through J. I remember that Moore's ethics focus on the nature of morality and how it relates to values.

Let me think. Moore's philosophy is known for being a transcendental philosophy, focusing on the idea that morality is a matter of values, not a science. He's often discussed in the context of evaluating different ethical theories. His key contributions include the concept of "being good as we are" and the idea that morality is objective.

Wait, the question is about the most fundamental question. In Moore's view, what's the core issue? I think he's probably tied to the question of whether morality is objective or subjective. Because he argues that morality isn't derived from facts but is a matter of values that are inherent in a person.

Looking at the options, option I says whether morality is objective. That rings a bell. Other options seem more about definitions or the nature of ethics. For example, option A is about justice, which is part of ethics, but not the fundamental question. Option B is about ethics being a science, which isn't correct because Moore doesn't think it's a science.

Option C is about morality being subjective, which is a part of his view. His subjectivism suggests that morality is tied to how we perceive and value things. So, whether morality is subjective is a part of it, but the fundamental question would relate to the nature of morality itself.

Option E is about whether humans are inherently good or bad. That's more of a biological question, not about ethics. Similarly, option J is about "evil," which is a concept of morality, but the fundamental question is more about the nature of morality itself.

Another thought: Moore's ethics are about the values we hold, not the laws of nature. So, the fundamental question is about whether morality is an objective property of being or if it's a subjective choice.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: Moore's major work is "The Works of John Stuart Moore," and his most famous ideas include the concept of "being good as we are" and the distinction between objective and subjective morality. He argues that morality is a matter of values, not facts.

So, the most fundamental question in ethics would be whether morality is objective. Because he's saying that morality isn't something we can know through reason alone; it's a matter of values. So the question is, is morality a matter of objective values (which would be objective) or is it a subjective choice (subjective)?

Wait, the options are as follows:

Option I: whether morality is objective.

So, if Moore's view is that morality is objective because it's a matter of values, then the answer would be I.

Alternatively, option C says whether morality is subjective, which is part of his view. So the fundamental question he's addressing is whether morality is objective or subjective.

Another point: I remember that Moore's ethics are about the values, not the laws. So, the most fundamental question is about whether morality is an objective property of being (i.e., whether it's inherent in a person) or a subjective choice (how we value things).

Wait, but the question is about the most fundamental question in all of ethics. So perhaps the core issue is whether morality is objective or if it's a subjective matter. So, if the question is whether morality is objective, then the answer is I.

Looking back at the options again:

A: Justice definition. Not the core.

B: Ethics as a science. No.

C: Morality is subjective. He thinks it's subjective.

D: God exists. That's more about religious thought, not Moore.

E: Humans inherently good or bad. That's a biological question.

F: Goodness definition. Again, part of morality.

G: Life worth living. That's about existence, not ethics.

H: Meaning of life. Also a personal or existential question.

J: Evil definition. Again, part of morality.

So, the answer is I: whether morality is objective.

The most fundamental question in all of ethics according to John Stuart Moore is whether morality is objective. Moore's philosophy emphasizes that morality is a matter of values, not derived from facts. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: whether morality is objective.**
