Okay, so I have this question about plant growth and gravitropism. Hmm, I remember that gravitropism has something to do with how plants grow in relation to gravity. Let me think about what I know.

Alright, plant growth direction is influenced by gravitropism, which is the direction the plant grows relative to gravity. There are several types of gravitropism, like geotropism, phototropism, thigmotropism, and hydrotropism. I need to figure out which one this question is referring to.

The question says the plant grows in the opposite direction of gravity. Wait, I thought gravitropism is when the plant leans away from gravity. Like, for example, wheat grows to the south if gravity is pulling it south. So if a plant grows opposite to gravity, that would mean it's facing the direction gravity is pulling it. So that's positive gravitropism? Or is that negative?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: geotropism is when plants grow towards the direction of gravity. So, if gravity is pulling them down, they grow down. Phototropism is towards light. So positive phototropism is when they grow towards the light, which is the direction the light is coming from. Thiganotropism is towards the ground, which is the opposite direction of light. So for example, if the plant is in a sunny spot, it grows towards the ground (thigmotropism) because the light is coming from the south, and the plant grows northwards. Negative thigmotropism would be growing away from the light, but in this question, it's the opposite.

Wait, but the question is about the direction the plant is growing relative to gravity. So if it's growing the opposite direction of gravity, that's positive gravitropism. Because, for example, if gravity is pulling the roots down, the plant would grow upwards. So positive gravitropism is when they grow away from gravity towards the light, which is the opposite direction. So the plant is growing in the opposite direction of gravity, meaning it's gravitropically positive.

Looking at the options, option F is positive gravitropism. So the answer should be F.

The question asks for an example of a plant growing in the opposite direction of gravity, which is a form of gravitropism. Positive gravitropism is when the plant grows towards the light, away from gravity. This matches option F, positive gravitropism.

Answer: F
