Question:

What is meant by the marginal product of aproductive factor?

Options:

A: The total output produced by a single unit of a factor
B: The increase in total cost when one more unit of a factor is employed, holding all other factors constant
C: The cost of producing an additional unit of output
D: The amount by which total output increases due to the addition of one unit of a given factor while the amount used of other factors of production remains unchanged
E: The revenue generated from selling the output produced by an additional unit of a factor
F: The ratio of total output to the number of units of a factor used
G: The added value of a unit of output
H: The average output produced by all units of a factor
I: The decrease in total output when one unit of a factor is removed
J: The profit earned from the production of one more unit of output using an additional unit of a factor

Okay, so I've got this economics question about the marginal product of a productive factor. Hmm, let me think through this.

I remember from my studies that marginal product has something to do with the additional output produced by using one more unit of a factor of production. Like, if you have a certain number of workers, each additional worker contributes a certain amount to the total output. So the marginal product is how much more output you get when you add one more worker.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. Option A says it's the total output from a single unit. Wait, that's more like average productivity, isn't it? Because average product is total output divided by the number of workers. So A is probably average, not marginal.

Option B talks about increased cost with more workers. But I don't think marginal product is about cost; it's more about the output effect. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Cost of producing an additional unit? That sounds more like marginal cost. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. So C isn't about productivity, but cost, so probably not.

Option D: It says due to adding one unit of a factor while others are unchanged. That sounds exactly like marginal product. Because when you add a factor, the additional output is the marginal. So D seems correct.

Option E: Revenue from selling the additional unit. That sounds like marginal revenue, not marginal product. So E is about revenue, not output effect.

Option F: Ratio of output to factor units. That's average product. So F is the opposite of what we're looking for.

Option G: Added value. That's similar to marginal product, but I'm not sure if it's the same thing. Oh, marginal product is the change in output from adding one more unit, so G might be a different term but similar concept.

Option H: Average output. Again, average product. So H is about average, not marginal.

Option I: Decrease in output when removing a unit. That's inverse of marginal product. So I is about average but in the opposite direction.

Option J: Profit from producing one more. That's marginal profit, not productivity.

So the correct answer should be either D or G. Wait, but let me think. The question is about the "marginal product of a productive factor." So D defines it as the increase in total output due to adding one unit. G is about the added value. Are they different? Or are they the same concept?

Wait, marginal product is the change in total output when you add one more unit of the factor. So D is describing that change. So D is correct.

Alternatively, G says "the added value of a unit of output." Hmm, marginal product is the additional output, so G might be the same as D. Or is it a different term? Let me think. Marginal product is the change in total output, so D is the definition.

Wait, but in some sources, marginal product is defined as the change in total output when one more unit of the factor is used. So D is the correct answer.

The marginal product of a productive factor refers to the additional output produced by employing one more unit of that factor. This is best described by the definition in option D, which states that it is the increase in total output due to the addition of one unit of a given factor while the amount of other factors remains unchanged. 

Answer: D
