Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The chemist wants to make a 50 ml solution of pH 1.25 HCl, and the HCl is labeled 11.6 M. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on dilution, but I think I can figure this out.

Wait, I remember that dilution involves the concept of moles. Oh right, the formula is M1V1 = M2V2, where M is molarity and V is volume in liters. So that's the key formula here.

The desired volume is 50 ml, which is 0.05 liters. The desired concentration is pH 1.25. Wait, but pH doesn't directly give me the concentration; pH is the negative log of the H+ concentration. So [H+] = 10^(-pH). Let me calculate that.

pH is 1.25, so [H+] = 10^(-1.25) ≈ 0.05996 M. But wait, wait, since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so [H+] is the same as the concentration of HCl. So the desired concentration of HCl solution is 0.06 M (approximately).

Now, the stock solution is 11.6 M HCl. I need to find how much to take from this stock and how much water to add to make 50 ml of 0.06 M HCl.

Using M1V1 = M2V2:

11.6 M * V1 = 0.06 M * 0.05 L

So V1 = (0.06 * 0.05) / 11.6 = (0.003) / 11.6 ≈ 0.0002586 liters, which is 0.2586 ml. Wait, but wait, that's the volume of the concentrated HCl needed. But wait, wait, no. Wait, no, that's the volume of the concentrated solution that needs to be diluted. So let me think again.

Wait, I have 0.2586 mL of 11.6 M HCl. To make 50 ml of 0.06 M HCl, I need to add water. The total volume after dilution is 50 ml. So the volume of water needed is 50 - 0.2586 ≈ 49.7414 ml. So approximately 49.74 ml of water.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. The options involve adding a certain volume of water to another volume of HCl. So the correct way is to take some concentrated HCl and add water to reach 50 ml. So, the correct dilution would be 0.2586 mL of concentrated HCl plus (50 - 0.2586) ml of water, which is about 49.74 ml.

Looking at the options:

A: 50 ml H2O to 0.24 ml HCl. No, that's the reverse. We need more concentrated solution.

B: 49.76 ml H2O to 0.24 ml HCl. Wait, that's adding water to the concentrated solution. Wait, but that would be a very dilute solution. Wait, no: wait, the volume of HCl is the same as the volume of water? That can't be right. Because 0.24 ml HCl is the volume, and 49.76 ml is the water. So the total is 50.0004 ml, almost 50 ml. But the volume of HCl is 0.24 mL, which is much less. Wait, but the formula is (M1V1) = (M2V2). If we have 0.24 mL of 11.6 M HCl, and we add 49.76 mL of water, the total volume is 50.0004 mL. So what's the M of that solution? M1V1 = 11.6 * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol. The total volume is 0.050004 L. So M = 0.002784 / 0.050004 ≈ 0.05567 M. Which is about 0.0557 M. The pH is -log(0.0557) ≈ 1.255. That's a bit higher than desired. But the options might not have that exact number, but perhaps the right order of magnitude is correct.

Wait, but option B says add 49.76 ml of H2O to 0.24 ml of HCl. So the HCl is 0.24 ml, which is about 0.24 * 11.6 = approx 2.784 mmol. Adding 49.76 ml H2O (which is 49.76 liters? No, wait, H2O is 1 g per mL, so 49.76 ml is ~49.76 grams of water. Wait, but the molarity is based on volume. But in this case, perhaps the way the dilution is set up, the volumes are additive.

Wait, but wait, the way I calculated earlier, 0.2586 ml of HCl is needed. So in option B, 0.24 ml is less than that. So the actual amount taken would be 0.24 ml, which is less than needed. But perhaps the options are using approximations.

Looking at the other options. Let's go through each option.

Option E: Add 49.5 ml of water to 0.1 ml of HCl. So that would be 0.1 ml HCl plus 49.5 ml water. Total volume 49.6 ml. Moles HCl would be 11.6 * 0.0001 = 0.00116 mol. Molarity is 0.00116 / 0.0496 L ≈ 0.0234 M. pH is about -log(0.0234) ≈ 1.63, which is higher than 1.25. So probably not correct.

Option B: 49.76 ml water to 0.24 ml HCl. So V1 is 0.24 ml, V2 is 50 ml. So M1 = 11.6 M, M2 = 0.06 M.

Check if M1V1 = M2V2.

11.6 * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol. 0.06 * 0.05 = 0.003 mol. Hmm, wait, 0.002784 is less than 0.003. So that's not equal. So that doesn't satisfy the dilution equation. So option B isn't correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate.

Option B: 0.24 mL HCl (assuming 0.24 ml) plus 49.76 ml H2O. So total volume is 50.0004 mL.

M1V1 = 11.6 * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol.

M2V2 = 0.06 M * 0.05 L = 0.003 mol.

0.002784 is less than 0.003. So the solution would be slightly less concentrated than desired. So the pH would be slightly higher than 1.25. But our desired is 1.25. So perhaps the correct volume is a bit higher.

Wait, but the formula M1V1 = M2V2. So if I take V1 = 0.2586 mL, then M2 would be (11.6 * 0.2586) / 50 = let's calculate that.

11.6 * 0.2586 = approximately 3.000 (exact is 11.6 * 0.2586 = 2.98356). Divided by 0.05 L is 59.671 M. Wait, that can't be right because 0.2586 mL is 0.0002586 L. So 11.6 * 0.0002586 = 0.003 mol. Then M2 would be 0.003 / 0.05 = 0.06 M. So the desired concentration. So the correct V1 is 0.2586 ml. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option B is 49.76 ml H2O to 0.24 ml HCl. So the volume of HCl is 0.24 ml, which is less than 0.2586. So the volume taken would be 0.24 ml, leading to a solution of 11.6 * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol. Total volume is 0.050004 L. Molarity is 0.002784 / 0.050004 ≈ 0.0556 M. pH is about 1.255, which is higher than desired. So option B is not correct.

Wait, but option F: add 45.24 ml H2O to 4.76 ml HCl. So V1 is 4.76 ml, V2 is 50 ml. So M1V1 = 11.6 * 0.00476 = 0.054776 mol. M2V2 = 0.06 * 0.05 = 0.003 mol. 0.054776 is way higher, so pH would be way higher. Not correct.

Option J: add 45 ml H2O to 0.24 ml HCl. So V1 is 0.24, V2 is 50. So M1V1 = 11.6 * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol. M2 is 0.002784 / 0.05 = 0.0556 M. pH is about 1.255. So pH is higher than desired. Not correct.

Option D: add 49.76 mL H2O to 0.5 mL HCl. So V1=0.5 mL, V2=50 mL. M1V1 = 11.6 * 0.0005 = 0.0058 mol. M2V2 = 0.06 * 0.05 = 0.003. 0.0058 >0.003, so the solution is more concentrated than needed. So pH is lower than 1.25. Not correct.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that 0.24 mL HCl would give a volume of 50.0004 mL, which is about 0.050004 L. So M is 0.002784 / 0.050004 = ~0.0556 M. pH is about 1.255. So pH is a bit higher than desired. So option B is close but not exact.

Wait, but the question asks which option is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm a bit confused. Because our calculation shows that 0.24 ml HCl would give a higher pH than desired. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate the exact required volume.

M1 = 11.6 M, M2 = 0.06 M. We need V2 =50 ml.

So V1 = (M2 * V2 ) / M1 = (0.06 * 0.05) / 11.6 = 0.003 / 11.6 = 0.0002586 L = 0.2586 ml.

So the correct volume of concentrated HCl is approximately 0.2586 ml. So when adding to 50 ml water, the final solution is 50.2586 ml. Let's see, but none of the options exactly state 0.2586 ml. So the closest option is option B, which uses 0.24 ml, which is a bit less. So perhaps option B is the intended answer because it's the closest to 0.2586.

Wait, but why is option B the correct answer? Let me look again.

Option B: add 49.76ml of H2O to 0.24ml of HCl. So the total volume is 50.0004ml. The HCl is 0.24 ml, so 11.6 M is 0.24 * 11.6 = 2.784 mmol.

The final volume is 0.050004 L. So Molarity is 2.784 / 0.050004 = approximately 55.64 M. That can't be right. Wait, wait, no: wait, 2.784 mmol is 0.002784 mol. Oh, wait, no, wait, 0.24 ml is 0.00024 L. So 11.6 M * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol. So M = 0.002784 / 0.05 = 0.05568 M, which is 0.0557 M. So pH is about 1.255, which is just a bit higher than desired. So option B is giving a pH a bit higher than desired.

So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about preparing a 50 ml solution of pH 1.25. So the correct way is to take 0.2586 ml of 11.6 M HCl and add enough water to make 50 ml. But since none of the options exactly match that, perhaps the intended answer is option B, because it's the closest in volume. Alternatively, maybe the options have a typo, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at the options again. Let's recheck all options.

Option B: 0.24 ml HCl + 49.76 ml H2O. So total volume is 50.0004 ml. 0.24 ml of 11.6 M HCl is 2.784 mmol. So the solution's concentration is 2.784 mmol / 50.0004 ml = 0.05568 M. Which is 0.0557 M, pH is about 1.255. Which is a bit higher than 1.25. So the pH is 1.255, which is only 0.005 higher than desired. Hmm, but perhaps the options are using a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should go through each option again.

Looking for which option satisfies M1V1 = M2V2.

Option B: V1 = 0.24 ml, V2=50 ml.

M1V1=11.6 * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol.

M2V2=0.06 * 0.05= 0.003 mol.

But 0.002784 is not equal to 0.003. So option B is not correct.

Wait, but 0.002784 is 0.003 minus 0.000216, which is 2.16e-5 less. So the molarity is 0.05568 M instead of 0.06 M. So pH is a bit higher.

So perhaps none of the options is correct, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me calculate the desired volume.

M1=11.6, V1= x. M2=0.06, V2=50ml.

x = (0.06 *50)/11.6 = 0.003 / 11.6 = 0.0002586 L = 0.2586 ml. So needed 0.2586 ml HCl.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B's 0.24 ml. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

But wait, why is that the case? Because the options might have used the approximation of the stock solution's volume as the same as the amount taken. For example, if you take 0.2586 ml, perhaps the actual volume taken is 0.2586 ml, but in the options, perhaps it's 0.24 ml (the nearest option), leading to a solution with a pH slightly higher than 1.25.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but the intended correct option is B.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the 49.76 ml is the water or the HCl. No, the option says to add 49.76 ml of water to 0.24 ml of HCl.

So in this case, the dilution is 0.24 ml HCl + 49.76 ml H2O. The volume is 50.0004 ml.

The moles of HCl are 11.6 * 0.00024 = 0.002784 mol.

The concentration is 0.002784 / 0.050004 = 0.05568 M. pH is approx 1.255.

Which is very close to the desired pH of 1.25. So perhaps the intended correct option is B.
</think>

To prepare a 50 mL solution of pH 1.25, the required concentration of HCl is calculated as follows:

1. The pH of the desired solution is given by:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = -\log[H^+] = -\log(10^{-1.25}) = 1.25
   \]  
   Thus, the concentration of HCl in the solution is:  
   \[
   [H^+] = 10^{-1.25} \approx 0.05996 \, \text{M}
   \]  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so the concentration of HCl is also 0.05996 M.

2. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), where:  
   - \( M_1 = 11.6 \, \text{M} \) (concentration of the stock HCl)  
   - \( M_2 = 0.05996 \, \text{M} \) (desired concentration of HCl)  
   - \( V_2 = 50 \, \text{mL} \) (desired volume of the solution)  

   Solve for \( V_1 \):  
   \[
   V_1 = \frac{M_2V_2}{M_1} = \frac{(0.05996)(0.050)}{11.6} \approx 0.002784 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   Convert moles to volume:  
   \[
   V_1 = \frac{0.002784}{11.6} \approx 0.0002586 \, \text{L} = 0.2586 \, \text{mL}
   \]  
   Thus, 0.2586 mL of the stock HCl is needed, and water is added to make the total volume 50 mL.

3. **Evaluating the options:**  
   - **Option A:** Adds 50 mL of water to 0.24 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.24 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.00024 = 0.002784 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050024 = 0.003001 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

   - **Option B:** Adds 49.76 mL of water to 0.24 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.0004 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.00024 = 0.002784 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050004 = 0.00300024 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

   - **Option C:** Adds 50 mL of water to 0.25 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.25 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.00025 = 0.0029 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050025 = 0.0030015 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

   - **Option D:** Adds 49.76 mL of water to 0.5 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.25 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.0005 = 0.0058 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050025 = 0.0030015 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

   - **Option E:** Adds 49.5 mL of water to 0.1 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.0004 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.0001 = 0.00116 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050004 = 0.00300024 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

   - **Option F:** Adds 45.24 mL of water to 4.76 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.0004 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.000476 = 0.00547776 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050004 = 0.00300024 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

   - **Option G:** Adds 45.24 mL of water to 4.76 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.0004 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.000476 = 0.00547776 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050004 = 0.00300024 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

   - **Option H:** Adds 45.24 mL of water to 4.76 mL of HCl. Total volume = 50.0004 mL.  
     \[
     M_1V_1 = 11.6 \times 0.000476 = 0.00547776 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     \[
     M_2V_2 = 0.06 \times 0.050004 = 0.00300024 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     The concentrations are not equal, so this option is incorrect.  

4. **Conclusion:** None of the options exactly match the required 0.2586 mL of HCl. However, **Option B** is the closest, as it uses 0.24 mL of HCl, resulting in a slightly higher pH (1.255) than the desired pH (1.25). Despite this, it appears to be the intended answer based on the given options.

ANSWER: B
