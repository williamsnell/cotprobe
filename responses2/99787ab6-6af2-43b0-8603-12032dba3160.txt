Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a survey from Mexico in 2017. The question asks about the percentage of respondents who reported having paid a bribe in the last year. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about this topic. I remember that Mexico is a country with a history of corruption issues, especially since they have a strong system of public service contracts and have been accused of bribery. But I'm not exactly sure about specific statistics on this.

I think the调查 might have been done by the National Institute of Public Health (INPH) or something similar. I don't remember the exact number, but I know that corruption in Mexico is a significant issue. The 2017 survey, if it's a national one, would have covered all public services, including education, judiciary, police, utilities, etc.

Wait, I'm trying to remember if there were reports or public statements about bribes. I think there were statements against bribery, but exact percentages of respondents might be tricky. Maybe the numbers are quite high because the issue was so critical. I remember reading somewhere that a large percentage of people were aware of the issue and that many were aware of the consequences, which might lead them to report it.

Looking at the options: A is 21%, B is 91%, C is 100%, D is 81%, E is 71%, F is 51%, G is 61%, H is 31%, I is 41%, J is 11%.

I've heard that the majority of people in many countries about corruption are aware of it but haven't paid bribes. So the percentage might be high but not 100% (since some might not have paid bribes). Also, most people would be aware of the consequences, but they might not have explicitly stated it.

If the majority are aware, maybe around 90% or so. Looking at the options, B is 91%, which is pretty high. Alternatively, D is 81%, which is also a solid number. But I'm not sure which is more accurate.

I think I've read that about 90-95% of people in Mexico are aware of corruption but haven't paid bribes. So the answer could be around 90%, which is closest to option B (91%) or D (81%). Wait, 91% is the closest to what I've heard.

Alternatively, if the majority said they had paid bribes, but that's unlikely since the issue is serious and many people are aware of the consequences. So the correct answer would be a high percentage but not 100%.

So I think the correct answer is B: 91%.

The correct answer is B: 91%. 

**Answer: B**
