Okay, so I've got this proportion problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because proportions can be tricky, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which ratio forms a proportion with 6/9. The options are A to G. Hmm, I remember that a proportion means two ratios are equal when compared. So, 6/9 needs to be equal to one of these options.

First, maybe I should simplify 6/9 to its lowest terms. Let's see, both 6 and 9 are divisible by 3. So, dividing numerator and denominator by 3, that gives 2/3. So, the simplified version is 2/3. That might make things easier because I can check each option against 2/3.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 18 over 24. Let's simplify that. Both are divisible by 6. 18 ÷6=3, 24 ÷6=4. So it's 3/4. Now, 3/4 isn't equal to 2/3 because 3*3=9 and 4*2=8, which isn't the same as 6*something. Wait, maybe another approach: 2/3 equals 18/24? Let me cross-multiply. 2*24=48 and 3*18=54. 48 isn't equal to 54, so no, A isn't a proportion.

Option B: 8 over 12. Simplify that. Both are divisible by 4. 8÷4=2, 12÷4=3. So, 2/3. Oh, that's the same as 6/9! So, that's a proportion. So, B is a candidate.

Wait, but let me check the others just to be sure. Maybe there's another option, but I've already found one.

Option C: 3 over 5. Let's see, simplify if possible. 3 and 5 don't have any common factors other than 1, so it's 3/5. Does that equal 2/3? Let's cross-multiply: 3*3=9 and 2*5=10. 9≠10, so no.

Option D: 24 over 27. Let's simplify. Both are divisible by 3: 24÷3=8, 27÷3=9. So, 8/9. Is that equal to 2/3? Let's see: 2*9=18, 3*8=24. 18≠24, no.

Option E: 15 over 20. Simplify by dividing by 5: 15÷5=3, 20÷5=4. So, 3/4. 3/4 isn't equal to 2/3, because 3*3=9, 4*2=8. Not the same.

Option F: 9 over 6. Let's simplify. Both are divisible by 3: 9÷3=3, 6÷3=2. So, 3/2. That's not the same as 2/3. Wait, but wait, 3/2 is the reciprocal of 2/3. So, 2/3 ≠3/2. So, F isn't a proportion.

Option G: 2 over 6. Simplify by dividing by 2: 2/2=1, 6/2=3. So, 1/3. 1/3 is not equal to 2/3. So, G isn't a proportion either.

So, the only option that simplifies to 2/3 is B:8/12. So, the correct answer should be B.
</think>

The correct answer is B: 8 over 12.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Simplify 6/9:** Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3, resulting in 2/3.

2. **Check each option:**
   - **A: 18/24** simplifies to 3/4 (divided by 6), which is not equal to 2/3.
   - **B: 8/12** simplifies to 2/3 (divided by 4), matching the simplified form of 6/9.
   - **C: 3/5** simplifies to 3/5, which is not equal to 2/3.
   - **D: 24/27** simplifies to 8/9, which is not equal to 2/3.
   - **E: 15/20** simplifies to 3/4, not equal to 2/3.
   - **F: 9/6** simplifies to 3/2, not equal to 2/3.
   - **G: 2/6** simplifies to 1/3, not equal to 2/3.

3. **Conclusion:** Only option B simplifies to 2/3, forming a proportion with 6/9.

**Answer:** B
