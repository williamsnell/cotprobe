Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about finding the area of triangle ABC. The given information is the lengths of two sides, AB is 10 cm and BC is 3 cm. Also, the angle at B, which is angle ABC, is 107 degrees. They want the area correct to five decimal places. Hmm, okay, let me figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that there are a couple of formulas for the area of a triangle. One is (1/2)*base*height, but I don't know the height here. The other formula I can think of is using the formula involving two sides and the included angle: (1/2)*ab*sinθ. That might be useful here because I have two sides and the included angle. Let me write that down.

So, sides AB and BC are 10 cm and 3 cm respectively. The included angle at B is 107 degrees. So, if I use the formula:

Area = (1/2) * AB * BC * sin(angle ABC)

Plugging in the numbers:

Area = (1/2) * 10 cm * 3 cm * sin(107°)

Let me compute this step by step. First, multiply 10 and 3. That gives me 30. Then, multiply by 1/2, so that becomes 15. So, now the formula simplifies to:

Area = 15 cm² * sin(107°)

I need to calculate sin(107°). Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, so I'll have to compute it. Since 107 degrees is more than 90 but less than 180, it's an obtuse angle. Sine of an angle greater than 90 but less than 180 is positive, but I should make sure I'm calculating it correctly.

Alternatively, since 107 degrees is 90 + 17, I can use a calculator to find sin(107°). Wait, I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, maybe I can use the sine of (90 + 17) which is equal to cos(17°). Because sin(90 + θ) = cosθ. So, sin(107°) = cos(17°). That might be easier because I can look up cos(17°).

Wait, but without a calculator, I might not remember the exact value for cos(17°), so maybe I should just compute sin(107°) directly. Let me think about how to proceed.

Alternatively, since I don't have a calculator, maybe I can find a way to approximate sin(107°). But that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed symbolically and then compute it.

Wait, but maybe I can use the sine addition formula. Let me try that.

Wait, I know that sin(107°) = sin(60° + 47°). Alternatively, maybe I can use 90° + 17°, as I thought earlier, which is cos(17°). So, sin(107°) equals cos(17°). But again, without a calculator, I might not know cos(17°) offhand. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator approach: 107 degrees. Let me convert that to radians for calculation purposes, but wait, maybe it's easier to use a calculator function.

Wait, but since I'm trying to simulate an exam situation, maybe I should just proceed with the formula and see where it leads me.

So, sin(107°) is approximately... Hmm, I can recall that sin(90°) is 1, sin(120°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sin(135°) is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(150°) is 0.5. So, 107° is between 90° and 120°, closer to 90°. So, sin(107°) should be a bit less than 1. Let me see if I can get a rough estimate.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the sine of supplementary angles. Wait, no, 107° is not supplementary to anything else in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sine of 107° as sin(90° + 17°) = cos(17°). So, sin(107°) = cos(17°). Now, cos(17°) is approximately 0.9563. Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Wait, cos(15°) is about 0.9659, cos(20°) is about 0.9397. So, cos(17°) should be somewhere between 0.9563 and 0.9659. Maybe around 0.9563?

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator, but since I'm not allowed that, maybe I can think of another way. Alternatively, I can use a linear approximation around 15°, but that might be beyond my current ability.

Alternatively, maybe I can think that 17° is 15° + 2°, so using some trigonometric identities. Hmm, perhaps the cosine of 17° can be calculated using the formula for cosine of sum angles. Let me think: cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So, cos(15° + 2°) = cos15° cos2° - sin15° sin2°.

I know that cos15° is approximately 0.9659, cos2° is about 0.9994, sin15° is about 0.2588, and sin2° is about 0.0349.

So, plugging these values in:

cos17° ≈ (0.9659)(0.9994) - (0.2588)(0.0349)
≈ 0.9652 - 0.0090
≈ 0.9562

So, that's about 0.9562. So, sin(107°) is approximately 0.9562.

So, going back to the area:

Area = 15 cm² * 0.9562 ≈ 15 * 0.9562 ≈ 14.343 cm².

Wait, is that right? Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 15 * 0.9562. Let me compute 15 * 0.9 = 13.5, and 15 * 0.0562 = 0.843. So, 13.5 + 0.843 = 14.343 cm². So, that would be approximately 14.343 cm².

But let me check if I used the right formula. I used the formula (1/2)*ab*sinθ, where a and b are sides AB and BC, and θ is the included angle at B.

Wait, but in this case, angle ABC is the angle at B between AB and BC. So, yes, that's angle θ, so the formula is correct.

But let me verify that the sides are AB and BC, and the angle is at B. So, AB is 10 cm, BC is 3 cm, and angle at B is 107°, so sides AB and BC are adjacent to angle B, so the included angle is indeed between AB and BC, so the formula applies correctly.

So, the area is 15 * 0.9562 ≈ 14.343 cm². So, looking at the options, option J is 14.34457 cm², which is very close to 14.343. So, the closest option is J, correct to five decimal places.

Wait, but let me check if my approximation of sin(107°) as 0.9562 is accurate enough. Perhaps I should get a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator function on my phone, but since I can't, maybe I can use another method.

Alternatively, I can use the Law of Cosines to find another side and then use another formula for area.

Wait, but maybe I can use the Law of Sines to find another angle, and then compute the area with sides and angles.

Wait, but perhaps an alternative approach: the area can also be calculated using (1/2)*a*b*sinθ, but in this case, we have two sides and the included angle, so that's the most straightforward method.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Compute sin(107°) using a calculator: 107 degrees.

If I have a calculator, 107 degrees: sin(107) ≈ 0.9563047559.

So, sin(107°) ≈ 0.9563047559.

So, then the area is 15 * 0.9563047559 ≈ 15 * 0.9563 ≈ 14.3445 cm².

Wait, that's even more precise. So, 15 * 0.9563 is 14.3445 cm².

Looking back at the options:

A: 12.34567

B: 11.98765

C: 19.87654

D: 13.56789

E: 12.12345

F: 16.23564

G: 18.23456

H: 15.67890

I: 17.45678

J: 14.34457

So, the exact value is approximately 14.34457 cm², which matches option J. So, the correct answer is J.

Wait, just to make sure, did I compute sin(107°) correctly as 0.9563?

Yes, because 107° is 90° + 17°, so sin(107°) = cos(17°), and cos(17°) is approximately 0.9563, which matches the calculator value. So, that's correct.

So, the area is (1/2)*10*3*sin(107°) = 15 * 0.9563 ≈ 14.3445 cm², which is option J.

Alternatively, since I can't use a calculator, maybe I can compute sin(107°) using another method.

Wait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines to find another side and then compute the area with Heron's formula. Let me try that approach.

Wait, but Heron's formula requires all three sides. I don't have the third side yet. So, let's find the third side, AC.

Using the Law of Cosines:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle ABC)

Wait, angle ABC is 107°, so:

AC² = 10² + 3² - 2*10*3*cos(107°)

Compute that:

AC² = 100 + 9 - 60*cos(107°)

So, AC² = 109 - 60*cos(107°)

Now, cos(107°) is equal to cos(90° + 17°) = -sin(17°). So, cos(107°) is approximately -0.2923717.

So,

AC² = 109 - 60*(-0.2923717) = 109 + 60*0.2923717

Compute 60*0.2923717: 60*0.2923717 ≈ 17.5423

So, AC² ≈ 109 + 17.5423 ≈ 126.5423

Thus, AC ≈ sqrt(126.5423) ≈ 11.254 cm.

Now, using Heron's formula, the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

So, let's compute the semi-perimeter:

s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 ≈ (10 + 3 + 11.254)/2 = (24.254)/2 ≈ 12.127 cm

Now, compute each term:

s - AB = 12.127 - 10 = 2.127

s - BC = 12.127 - 3 = 9.127

s - AC = 12.127 - 11.254 = 0.873

Now, the area is sqrt(12.127 * 2.127 * 9.127 * 0.873)

Compute the product inside the square root:

12.127 * 2.127 ≈ let's approximate:

12 * 2 = 24, 12 * 0.127 ≈ 1.524, 0.127 * 2 ≈ 0.254, 0.127 * 0.127 ≈ 0.0161

Wait, maybe better to compute 12.127 * 2.127:

12.127 * 2 = 24.254

12.127 * 0.127 ≈ 1.542

So total ≈ 24.254 + 1.542 ≈ 25.796

Similarly, 9.127 * 0.873 ≈

9 * 0.873 = 7.857

0.127 * 0.873 ≈ 0.111

So, total ≈ 7.857 + 0.111 ≈ 7.968

So, the product is approximately 25.796 * 7.968 ≈ let's compute that.

25 * 8 = 200

25 * 0.968 = 24.2

0.796 * 8 = 6.37

0.796 * 0.968 ≈ 0.776

Wait, perhaps a better way: 25.796 * 7.968

Approximate as:

(25 + 0.796) * (8 - 0.032) = 25*8 + 25*(-0.032) + 0.796*8 + 0.796*(-0.032)

Compute each term:

25*8 = 200

25*(-0.032) = -0.8

0.796*8 = 6.368

0.796*(-0.032) ≈ -0.02547

Adding them all up:

200 - 0.8 + 6.368 - 0.02547 ≈

200 - 0.8 = 199.2

199.2 + 6.368 = 205.568

205.568 - 0.02547 ≈ 205.54253

So, the product inside the square root is approximately 205.54253.

Thus, the area is sqrt(205.54253) ≈ 14.34 cm².

Wait, that's consistent with the previous calculation. So, using Heron's formula gives me approximately 14.34 cm², which is option J when rounded to five decimal places. So, that seems correct.

But earlier, when I used sin(107°) ≈ 0.9563, I got 14.3445 cm², which is option J as well.

Wait, but let me check if I did Heron's formula correctly because I used approximate values for the sides.

Wait, AC was approximately 11.254 cm, so s was (10 + 3 + 11.254)/2 = 24.254 / 2 = 12.127 cm.

Then, s - AB = 2.127, s - BC = 9.127, s - AC ≈ 0.873.

Multiplying these together: 2.127 * 9.127 * 0.873 * 12.127.

Wait, but I approximated the product as 205.54, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 2.127 * 9.127:

Compute 2 * 9 = 18

2 * 0.127 = 0.254

0.127 * 9 = 1.143

0.127 * 0.127 ≈ 0.0161

Wait, actually, perhaps a better way is to compute 2.127 * 9.127 as:

= (2 + 0.127) * (9 + 0.127)
= 2*9 + 2*0.127 + 0.127*9 + 0.127*0.127
= 18 + 0.254 + 1.143 + 0.0161
= 18 + 0.254 = 18.254
18.254 + 1.143 = 19.397
19.397 + 0.0161 ≈ 19.4131

So, approximately 19.4131.

Now, multiply this by 0.873:

19.4131 * 0.873 ≈

19 * 0.873 = 16.587

0.4131 * 0.873 ≈ 0.361

So, total ≈ 16.587 + 0.361 ≈ 16.948.

Wait, but that can't be because 19.4131 * 0.873 is more than 19.4131 * 0.8 = 15.5305, but 16.948 is less than 19.4131 * 1 = 19.4131, which seems correct.

Wait, then multiply this by 12.127:

16.948 * 12.127 ≈

16 * 12 = 192

16 * 0.127 ≈ 2.032

0.948 * 12 ≈ 11.376

0.948 * 0.127 ≈ 0.120

So, adding up:

192 + 2.032 = 194.032

194.032 + 11.376 = 205.408

205.408 + 0.120 ≈ 205.528

Wait, so the product is approximately 205.528.

Thus, the area is sqrt(205.528) ≈ 14.34 cm².

Wait, but that's still approximate, but closer to J.

So, given that Heron's formula and the direct formula both give approximately 14.34 cm², which matches option J (14.34457 cm²).

Wait, but in the Heron's formula, I approximated the sides as 10, 3, and 11.254, which might have introduced some error. But since the answer comes to J in both methods, I can be confident that J is the correct answer.

Thus, the correct option is J, correct to five decimal places.

To find the area of triangle \(ABC\), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BC \times \sin(\angle ABC)
\]

Given:
- \(AB = 10 \, \text{cm}\)
- \(BC = 3 \, \text{cm}\)
- \(\angle ABC = 107^\circ\)

First, we calculate \(\sin(107^\circ)\). Since \(107^\circ = 90^\circ + 17^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin(107^\circ) = \sin(90^\circ + 17^\circ) = \cos(17^\circ)
\]

Using a calculator, \(\cos(17^\circ) \approx 0.9563\).

Now, plug into the area formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 3 \times 0.9563 = 15 \times 0.9563 \approx 14.3445 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{J}
\]
