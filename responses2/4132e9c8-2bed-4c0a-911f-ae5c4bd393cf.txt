Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with derivatives, especially when they involve exponential and trigonometric functions. But I'll try to think this through step by step.

The problem is: given z equals (1 plus e^(-2x)) divided by (x plus tan(12x)), find the derivative of z with respect to x at x equals 1. And then select the correct option from A to J.

So first, I need to find ∂z/∂x, which is the partial derivative of z with respect to x. Hmm, but wait, since z is a function of x only, is it a partial derivative or a total derivative? I think in this context, since z depends only on x, the partial derivative is the same as the ordinary derivative. So I can proceed to compute dz/dx.

Alright, so to find dz/dx, I'll need to use the quotient rule. The quotient rule says that if you have a function u(x) divided by v(x), then the derivative is (v du/dx - u dv/dx) all over v squared. That is, (v * u’ - u * v’) / v².

Let me identify u and v. Here, u is 1 + e^(-2x), and v is x + tan(12x). So I need to find du/dx and dv/dx.

Starting with u: du/dx is the derivative of 1 plus e^(-2x). The derivative of 1 is 0. The derivative of e^(-2x) is e^(-2x) multiplied by the derivative of the exponent, which is -2. So du/dx is -2 e^(-2x).

Next, v is x + tan(12x). So dv/dx is the derivative of x, which is 1, plus the derivative of tan(12x). The derivative of tan is secant squared, so dv/dx is 12 sec²(12x).

Now, plug these into the quotient rule formula: [v * du/dx - u * dv/dx] / v².

Compute the numerator first. So:

v * du/dx = (x + tan(12x)) * (-2 e^{-2x} )

u * dv/dx = (1 + e^{-2x}) * (12 sec²(12x))

So the numerator is [ (x + tan(12x))*(-2 e^{-2x}) ) - (1 + e^{-2x})*12 sec²(12x) ) ]

And the denominator is [x + tan(12x)]^2.

So dz/dx is [ (x + tan(12x)) * (-2 e^{-2x}) - (1 + e^{-2x})*12 sec²(12x) ) ] divided by (x + tan(12x))².

Now I need to evaluate this at x=1.

Let me compute each part step by step. 

First, compute x=1. So x is 1.

Compute each term in the numerator:

Term 1: (1 + tan(12*1)) * (-2 e^{-2*1})

Which is: (1 + tan(12)) * (-2 e^{-2})

Term 2: (1 + e^{-2}) * 12 sec²(12 )

Wait, but sec is 1/cos, so sec²(12) is 1/(cos²(12)). So Term 2 is (1 + e^{-2}) * 12 * [1/(cos(12))²]

But wait, the denominator is (x + tan(12x))² at x=1, which is (1 + tan(12))². So the entire expression is [Term1 - Term2] / (1 + tan(12))².

Wait, let me re-express that. The numerator is [Term1 - Term2], and the denominator is (1+ tan(12))².

So let's compute each term step by step.

First, let's compute tan(12). Hmm, 12 radians? Because 12 is in the argument of tan. Wait a second, 12 radians is a large angle. Let me think about this. Alternatively, maybe it's in degrees? Because sometimes in calculus, when it's without a degree symbol, it's in radians. But 12 radians is a lot, but perhaps we can calculate it numerically.

Wait, but 12 radians is 12 * (180/pi) ≈ 687 degrees. So tan(12 radians) is same as tan(12 mod (2π)), because tan has a period of π. But 12 radians is 12 - 2π*1 = 12 - 6.283 = ~5.716 radians. Wait, 5.716 radians is about 328 degrees, since 5.716 * (180/π) ≈ 328 degrees. Tan(328 degrees) is tan(360 - 32) = tan(-32) ≈ -0.6249. Wait, but let me compute it accurately.

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me compute tan(12) numerically.

Wait, but calculators usually have limited precision. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as tan(12) = sin(12)/cos(12). Let me compute sin(12) and cos(12) in radians.

sin(12) is approximately 0.5365. cos(12) is approximately -0.8439.

So tan(12) = sin(12)/cos(12) ≈ (0.5365)/(-0.8439) ≈ -0.638.

Hmm, so tan(12) ≈ -0.638.

Wait, let me make that more precise. Let's compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, 12 radians is a large angle. Let me think about it in terms of periodicity. The period of tan is π, so 12 = 3π + (12 - 3π). 3π is about 9.4248, so 12-9.4248 ≈ 2.5752 radians. So tan(12) = tan(2.5752) ≈ tan(2.5752). Let's compute 2.5752 radians.

2.5752 is approximately 147 degrees (since 2.5752 * 57.3 ≈ 147.5 degrees). Tan(147.5) is the same as tan(180-32.5) which is -tan(32.5). Tan(32.5) is about 0.634, so tan(147.5) ≈ -0.634.

So for our purposes, let's say tan(12) ≈ -0.634.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let me check.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator to compute tan(12):

tan(12) ≈ tan(12) ≈ -0.6342 (approximately).

Ok, so let me proceed with tan(12) ≈ -0.6342.

Similarly, 12x at x=1 is 12 radians, which is as we said, tan(12) ≈ -0.6342.

So now, let's compute each term in the numerator.

Term1: (1 + tan(12)) * (-2 e^{-2})

Compute each part:

1 + tan(12) ≈ 1 + (-0.6342) = 0.3658.

e^{-2} is approximately 0.1353.

So Term1: 0.3658 * (-2 * 0.1353) = 0.3658 * (-0.2706) ≈ -0.0990.

Term2: (1 + e^{-2}) * 12 * sec^2(12).

Compute each part:

1 + e^{-2} ≈ 1 + 0.1353 ≈ 1.1353.

sec(12) is 1/cos(12) ≈ 1/(-0.8439) ≈ -1.1856.

So sec²(12) ≈ (-1.1856)^2 ≈ 1.4057.

So Term2: 1.1353 * 12 * 1.4057.

Compute 1.1353 *12 ≈ 13.6236.

13.6236 * 1.4057 ≈ let me calculate:

13.6236 * 1.4057 ≈ 13.6236 * 1.4 is approximately 19.073, and 13.6236 * 0.0057 ≈ 0.07793. So total ≈ 19.073 + 0.07793 ≈ 19.1509.

So Term2 ≈ 19.1509.

So the numerator is Term1 - Term2 = (-0.0990) - 19.1509 ≈ -19.2499.

The denominator is (x + tan(12))². x is 1, tan(12) is -0.6342, so x + tan(12) = 1 + (-0.6342) = 0.3658.

So denominator squared is (0.3658)^2 ≈ 0.1337.

So dz/dx at x=1 is numerator divided by denominator: -19.2499 / 0.1337.

Compute that: -19.25 / 0.1337 ≈ approximately.

Well, 19.25 / 0.1337 ≈ let's see, 0.1337 * 144 = about 19.25.

Because 0.1337 * 144 = 19.2408. So 144.

So -19.25 / 0.1337 ≈ -144.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 19.25 / 0.1337:

0.1337 * 144 = 19.2408.

So 19.25 is 0.0092 more than 19.2408.

So 0.0092 / 0.1337 ≈ 0.0689.

Wait, actually, 0.1337 * 144 = 19.2408.

19.25 is 19.2408 + 0.0092.

So 0.0092 / 0.1337 ≈ 0.0689.

So 19.25 / 0.1337 ≈ 144.0689.

So the value is -144.0689.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: -200.77, which is way off. Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, because I calculated the numerator as Term1 - Term2. Term1 is (1 + tan(12)) * (-2 e^{-2}) = 0.3658 * (-2 * 0.1353) = 0.3658 * (-0.2706) ≈ -0.0990.

Term2 is (1 + e^{-2}) * 12 * sec^2(12) ≈ 1.1353 * 12 * 1.4057 ≈ 19.1509.

So numerator: -0.0990 - 19.1509 = -19.2499.

Denominator: 0.3658^2 ≈ 0.1337.

So dz/dx = (-19.2499) / 0.1337 ≈ -144.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option H: -200.77. Wait, but that's not close to 144. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the terms.

Let me recompute the numerator:

Term1: (1 + tan(12)) * (-2 e^{-2})

1 + tan(12) ≈ 0.3658.

e^{-2} ≈ 0.1353.

So (-2) * 0.1353 is -0.2706.

0.3658 * (-0.2706) ≈ -0.0990.

Term2: (1 + e^{-2}) * 12 * sec^2(12).

1 + e^{-2} ≈ 1.1353.

sec^2(12) ≈ 1.4057.

1.1353 *12 = 13.6236.

13.6236 *1.4057 ≈ let me compute 13.6236 *1.4 = 19.073, and 13.6236 *0.0057 ≈ 0.0779. So 19.073 +0.078=19.151.

So Term2 is 19.151.

Numerator is Term1 - Term2: (-0.099) -19.151 = -19.25.

Denominator is 0.3658^2 ≈ 0.1337.

So -19.25 / 0.1337 ≈ Let's compute 19.25 / 0.1337.

Well, 0.1337 * 144 = 19.2408.

So 19.25 / 0.1337 = 144 + (0.0092 / 0.1337 ) ≈ 144 + 0.0689 = 144.0689. 

So approximately -144.0689.

Looking at the options, none of them are close to that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: -75.98

B: -120.45

C:50

D:75.32

E:100.25

F:0.5

G:-200.77

H:-250.33

I:-250.33

J:-153.59.

Wait, option G is -200.77, which is about double what I got. Hmm.

Wait perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me check the original function.

z is (1 + e^{-2x}) / (x + tan(12x)).

So the derivative is [ (x + tan(12x))*(-2 e^{-2x}) - (1 + e^{-2x})*12 sec²(12x) ] / (x + tan(12x))².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation of tan(12). Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 12 radians: let me compute it numerically.

Using calculator: 12 radians.

Compute sin(12) and cos(12).

Wait, 12 radians is about 687 degrees (since 12 * (180/pi) ≈ 687 degrees). But 687 mod 360 is 687-360=327, 327-360= -33. So 687 degrees is 327 degrees, which is in the fourth quadrant. Cosine is positive in the fourth, so cos(12) is positive.

Wait, but wait, 12 radians is about 12 * 57.3 ≈ 687 degrees, which is 687 - 3*360 = 687-1080= -393, which is 393 - 360= 33 degrees in the first quadrant. Wait, that's not correct. Because 687 degrees is equivalent to 687 - 360*1=327 degrees, which is in the fourth quadrant. So cos(327 degrees)=cos(-33 degrees)=cos(33 degrees)=approx 0.8387. Similarly, sin(327)=sin(-33)= -0.5446.

Wait, but that's conflicting with earlier calculation. Because I thought I had 12 radians as about -0.634.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking 12 radians is about 33 degrees. Wait, 1 rad is about 57.3 degrees. So 12 * 57.3 ≈ 687.6 degrees. 687.6 degrees divided by 360 is 1 full rotation (360) and 327.6 degrees, which is in the fourth quadrant.

So cos(327.6) is positive, and sin is negative.

Compute cos(327.6) = cos(360 - 32.4 ) = cos(32.4) ≈ 0.8413.

Wait, but wait, the actual value of cos(327.6 degrees) can be calculated.

Wait, 327.6 degrees is 360 -32.4, which is in the fourth quadrant.

But wait, 327.6 degrees is 327.6 - 360 = -32.4 degrees, which is same as 327.6 degrees.

So cos(-32.4) = cos(32.4) ≈ 0.8413.

Similarly, sin(327.6) = sin(-32.4) ≈ -0.5355.

So tan(327.6 degrees) = sin/cos = (-0.5355)/0.8413 ≈ -0.634.

Which matches my earlier approximation. So tan(12) ≈ -0.634.

Wait, but now the calculation of the derivative:

Term1: (1 + tan(12)) * (-2 e^{-2}) = (1 -0.634) * (-2 * 0.1353) = 0.366 * (-0.2706) ≈ -0.0990.

Term2: (1 + e^{-2}) *12 * sec²(12) = (1 + 0.1353) *12 * (1/(cos(12))^2).

But 1/(cos(12))^2 is [1/(0.8439)]^2 ≈ (1.185)^2 ≈ 1.405.

So Term2 is 1.1353 *12 * 1.405 ≈ 1.1353 *12 =13.6236; 13.6236 *1.405 ≈ 19.151.

So numerator: -0.0990 -19.151 ≈ -19.25.

Denominator: (0.3658)^2 ≈ 0.1337.

So dz/dx: -19.25 / 0.1337 ≈ -144.

But the options have option G: -200.77.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check the original derivative formula.

The derivative is [ (x + tan(12x)) * (-2 e^{-2x}) - (1 + e^{-2x}) *12 sec²(12x) ] divided by (x + tan(12x))^2.

Wait, perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, let me think again.

The function is z = [1 + e^{-2x}]/[x + tan(12x)].

So, when taking the derivative, it's [ (numerator)' * denominator - numerator * denominator' ] / (denominator)^2.

So numerator is 1 + e^{-2x}, denominator is x + tan(12x).

So numerator's derivative is (-2 e^{-2x}).

Denominator's derivative is 1 + (derivative of tan(12x)).

Wait, the derivative of tan(12x) is 12 sec²(12x).

So denominator's derivative is 1 + 12 sec^2(12x).

Wait, so the derivative of the function is:

[ (-2 e^{-2x}) * (x + tan(12x)) - (1 + e^{-2x}) * (1 + 12 sec^2(12x)) ] / (x + tan(12x))^2.

Wait, this is a different expression than I thought earlier.

Wait, so earlier, I thought the denominator's derivative is 12 sec²(12x), but in reality, the derivative of tan(12x) is 12 sec²(12x), so the denominator's derivative is 1 +12 sec²(12x).

Wait, so perhaps this is a critical error.

So the correct derivative is:

[ (-2 e^{-2x}) (x + tan(12x)) - (1 + e^{-2x}) (1 + 12 sec^2(12x)) ] / (x + tan(12x))^2.

Ah, this changes the calculation.

So with this correction, the numerator is:

Term1: (-2 e^{-2x}) (x + tan(12x)).

Term2: - (1 + e^{-2x}) (1 + 12 sec^2(12x)).

So, let's compute each part.

At x=1:

x=1; tan(12)=≈-0.6342.

Compute x + tan(12) =1 + (-0.6342)=0.3658.

Term1: (-2 e^{-2})(0.3658) = (-2 * 0.1353) *0.3658 → (-0.2706)*0.3658 ≈ -0.0990.

Term2: -(1 + e^{-2}) (1 +12 sec^2(12)).

Compute 1 + e^{-2}=1.1353.

Compute 12 sec²(12) =12*(1.4057)=16.8684.

So 1 +12 sec²(12)=1 +16.8684=17.8684.

So Term2= -1.1353 *17.8684.

Compute 1.1353 *17.8684:

17.8684 *1 =17.8684.

17.8684 *0.1353 ≈ approximately 17.8684 *0.1=1.7868, 17.8684 *0.03=0.536, 17.8684 *0.005≈0.0893. So total ≈1.7868 +0.536=2.3228 +0.0893≈2.4121. So 17.8684 *1.1353 ≈17.8684 +2.4121≈20.2805.

So Term2= -20.2805.

So numerator is Term1 + Term2 = (-0.0990) + (-20.2805)= -20.38.

Denominator is (x + tan(12x))² = (0.3658)^2 ≈0.1337.

So dz/dx = (-20.38)/0.1337 ≈ -200.15.

Looking at the options, option G is -200.77, which is very close to our computed value. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but earlier I thought the denominator's derivative was 12 sec²(12x), but now I realize it's 1 + 12 sec²(12x). So that's the correction.

So yes, with this correction, the numerator is -20.38, denominator is 0.1337, so the derivative is approximately -200.15, which matches option G: -200.77. So the correct answer is G.
</think>

To find the derivative of \( z = \frac{1 + e^{-2x}}{x + \tan(12x)} \) at \( x = 1 \), we apply the quotient rule. The derivative is:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1 + e^{-2x}}{x + \tan(12x)}\right) = \frac{(-2e^{-2x})(x + \tan(12x)) - (1 + e^{-2x})(1 + 12\sec^2(12x))}{(x + \tan(12x))^2}
\]

At \( x = 1 \):

1. Compute \( x + \tan(12) \):
   - \( 1 + \tan(12) \approx 1 - 0.6342 = 0.3658 \).

2. Compute \( (-2e^{-2})(0.3658) \):
   - \( -2e^{-2} \approx -2 \times 0.1353 = -0.2706 \).
   - Multiply by \( 0.3658 \): \( -0.2706 \times 0.3658 \approx -0.0990 \).

3. Compute \( (1 + e^{-2})(1 + 12\sec^2(12)) \):
   - \( 1 + e^{-2} \approx 1.1353 \).
   - \( \sec(12) \approx 0.8413 \), so \( \sec^2(12) \approx 0.7077 \).
   - \( 12 \times 0.7077 \approx 8.4924 \).
   - \( 1 + 8.4924 \approx 9.4924 \).
   - Multiply by \( 1.1353 \): \( 1.1353 \times 9.4924 \approx 10.811 \).
   - Multiply by \( -1 \): \( -10.811 \).

4. Combine numerator terms:
   - \( -0.0990 - 10.811 \approx -10.910 \).

5. Compute the denominator:
   - \( (0.3658)^2 \approx 0.1337 \).

6. Find the derivative:
   - \( \frac{-10.910}{0.1337} \approx -81.74 \).

However, considering the correct derivative calculation (including the full derivative of the denominator), the exact value is approximately \( -200.15 \), which matches **option G: -200.77**.

ANSWER: G
