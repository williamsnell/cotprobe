Question:

Lizette and her family watch the sunset over the ocean. While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?

Options:

A: Lizette's eyes are adjusting to the darkness, hence she cannot distinguish the colors of objects.
B: Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.
C: The retina does not respond to changes in light intensity, therefore colors are not visible in dim light.
D: The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.
E: Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.
F: Rods and cones both require a high amount of light to be activated, hence color vision is not possible in dim light.
G: The cones, which are responsible for color vision, are deactivated in dim light.
H: The color vision is not possible in the dark because the photoreceptor cells in the retina require light to detect colors.
I: The colors are not visible in dim light because the rods, which detect colors, are deactivated.
J: Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about why Lizette can't see colors when it's dark. Let me think step by step.

The question says that Lizette can't distinguish colors of objects when walking home in the dark. She's noticing this while walking, so maybe her vision is being affected. The options are about cones, rods, and other photoreceptor functions.

First, I remember that color vision involves rods and cones. Rods are good for color (black, white, gray), and cones are specialized for color as well, but they have higher sensitivity. So, in the dark, both should be working, right? Because without enough light, maybe they can't process color as effectively.

Looking at the options, option B says cones require more light to be activated compared to rods. That makes sense because cones are highly sensitive to light, especially in color. They need more light to detect color accurately. If the light is dim, cones can't process color as well as rods can. So, maybe they can't see color in dim light because the cones aren't active enough without enough light.

Option E says cones require less light and rods require more. No, that's the opposite. I think cones need more light, so they can process color better when the light is plenty. So E is probably wrong.

Option H says rods need more light. That's not right because cones are more sensitive in color. So H is incorrect.

Option B's statement seems correct. Because cones are more sensitive, they need more light to activate, so in dim light, the cones can't see colors as well as rods can.

Another way: when the light is dim (like at sunset), cones might be less active because they're more sensitive to light. So without enough light, cones can't detect color as well. Rods are more stable because they handle color in a different way, so without enough light, they can't see color either. So the better process would be rods.

So the answer should be option B.

The question asks why Lizette cannot distinguish colors in dim light. The correct explanation lies in the roles of rods and cones in color vision. Rods are specialized for color (black, white, gray) and require more light to function efficiently, while cones are highly sensitive to light, especially in color, and need more light to process color accurately. In dim light, cones may not activate as well, leading to reduced color perception. 

Analyzing the options, **B** correctly identifies this relationship: "Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light."

ANSWER: B
