Okay, I need to translate the statement "All first-year students take a swim test" into predicate logic. Let's see, the options are A to J.

First, let's break down the statement. The subject is "first-year students," which I'll denote as Fx, where F is for being a first-year student. The predicate is that they take a swim test, so that would be Sx, where S stands for taking a swim test.

The phrase "all" indicates a universal quantifier, so it's ∀x. So the structure would be something like ∀x (Fx) and then the condition after.

Looking at the options:

A: ∀x (Sx → Fx). Wait, that would mean if x takes a swim test, then x is a first-year student. That doesn't make sense because the statement is that first-year students take a swim test, not the converse.

B: ∀x (Fx ≡ Sx). This would mean that being a first-year student is equivalent to taking a swim test. That's not correct because it implies both directions, which isn't the case here.

C: ∀x (Sx ∨ Fx). This would mean that for every x, either x takes a swim test or is a first-year student. But the statement doesn't make a disjunction; it's about implication, not either/or.

D: ∀x (Sx ≡ Fx). Again, same as B, it's an equivalence, which isn't what we want.

E: ∀x (Sx ∧ Fx). This would mean that every student takes a swim test (since Fx is first-year, but the statement is about all first-year students). Wait, no. The original statement is about all first-year students. So Fx is for being a first-year, and Sx is taking a swim test. So E would mean that if x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test. But the statement is that all first-year students take a swim test, which is ∀x (Fx → Sx). But none of the options say that.

Wait, looking back, the options. Option J says ∀x (Fx → Sx), which is the correct translation: every first-year student takes a swim test. So that's the right one.

Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The options don't have J, but in the options given, J is (∀x)(Fx → Sx). So yes, that's the correct translation.

The correct translation is J: ∀x (Fx → Sx), which states that if x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test.

Answer: J
