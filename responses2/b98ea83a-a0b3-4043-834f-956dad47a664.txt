Okay, so I've got this question about dividing a set of 5 elements into two non-empty ordered subsets. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you want to split a set into subsets, you're dealing with something called a partition. Since the subsets are ordered, the order matters here. Oh right, that means it's not just about grouping them but about considering which subset comes first.

Wait, so how do we calculate the number of ways to partition a set into two non-empty subsets when order matters? I think it's related to combinations and permutations. Let me recall. Normally, the number of ways to split a set into two non-empty subsets (without considering order) is 2^(n-1) - 1. For n=5, that would be 2^4 -1 = 16-1=15. But wait, that's when order doesn't matter. But in this question, the subsets are ordered.

Oh right, so when order matters, the number becomes 2^(n-1). Because each element can either be in the first subset or the second, but since the subsets are ordered, we don't divide by anything. So for n=5, that would be 2^4=16 ways. But wait, that's if the subsets can't have zero elements. Because the question says non-empty.

Wait, no. Wait the formula for ordered partitions doesn't include the cases where one subset is empty, because we're considering non-empty subsets. So, when we split into two subsets, both can't be empty. So the total number when order matters is 2^(n) - 2, but each subset has to be non-empty. Oh wait no, when you split into two, each subset must be non-empty, so we subtract 2 (one for each empty subset case). But since the subsets are ordered, the formula would be (2^n - 2)/2? Or wait, perhaps it's just 2^(n-1) because you're counting the subsets without considering order, but since order matters, it's double that.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The total number of ways to split into two subsets (without considering order) is 2^(n-1) -1, as each element has two choices, but we subtract the cases where all are in one subset. Then, since the order matters, each split is counted twice. So for each split into A and B, the same split into B and A is considered different. So the total number would be 2*(2^(n-1) -1) ?

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think differently. For each element, there are two choices: put it in subset A or subset B. So for 5 elements, that's 2^5 =32 possibilities. But this includes the cases where all are in A (subset B is empty), or all are in B (subset A is empty), and the case where A and B are the same (which is when A is the empty set and B is the entire set, but that's another case). Wait no, for each non-empty subset A, there's a corresponding subset B = total set minus A, which is also non-empty, and since order matters, A and B are two different ordered pairs. So the total number of ordered pairs would be 2^5 - 2 (excluding the cases where A is empty or B is empty). So that's 30. But wait, does that include the order? Because each split into A and B, whether A is considered first or B is, is counted separately.

Wait, wait. Let's see: for each non-empty A, there's a corresponding non-empty B. So the number of ordered pairs is 2^5 - 2 = 30. Because each element has two choices, but we subtract the two cases where all are in A or all in B. But wait, those are only two cases. So yes, 30. But wait, the question is about dividing into two non-empty ordered subsets. So is that 30? But that seems small. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are A:90, B:120, C:180, D:360, E:240, F:300, G:15, H:150, I:30, J:60. So 30 is one of the options, option E.

But wait, another way to think: the number of ordered partitions into two non-empty subsets is equal to the number of ways to choose a non-empty subset A, and then B is the complement. Since the subsets are ordered, A and B are considered different if they're swapped. So the number of ordered partitions is equal to the number of non-empty subsets A multiplied by the number of non-empty subsets B, which is the same as the number of non-empty subsets A. Since each subset A corresponds to a unique ordered pair (A,B) where B is the complement. So the number of ordered partitions is 2^(5) - 2, because each element can be in A or B, but we exclude the cases where A is empty or B is empty. So that's 32 - 2 =30.

But wait wait, that's the number of ordered pairs. But wait, I'm a bit confused. For example, for n=2, the number of ways to split into two non-empty ordered subsets would be 2^(2-1)=2. Let's see: for elements {1,2}, the possible ordered pairs are:

A={1}, B={2}

A={2}, B={1}

So that's two, which is 2^1=2. So yes, the formula holds for n=2. 

For n=3, 2^(3-1)=4. The possible splits are:

A={1}, B={2,3} 

A={2}, B={1,3}

A={3}, B={1,2}

A={2,3}, B={1}

Wait, wait, but that's four ordered pairs. So that's 4, which is 2^(3-1) =4. So the formula seems correct.

So for n=5, it's 2^(5-1)=16. But wait, that's only for ordered pairs where A and B are non-empty and A is in the first position. But wait, in our initial formula, when you have 2^(n) - 2, that counts all ordered pairs except when A is empty or B is empty. So for n=5, it's 32-2=30. So this matches.

So the answer should be 30, which is option E. But wait, wait, the options are A:90, B:120, etc.

Wait, no, the options given are A:90, B:120, C:180, D:360, E:240, F:300, G:15, H:150, I:30, J:60.

So 30 is an option (option E). So the correct answer should be E:30.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "divide into 2 non-empty ordered subsets." So maybe I'm not considering that each subset is considered as an ordered pair. But wait, in the formula 2^(n-1) is the number of ordered ways to split into two non-empty subsets where order matters. So for n=5, 2^(5-1)=16. Wait, that doesn't fit with our earlier example for n=2.

Wait, for n=2, 2^(2-1)=2. That's correct, as there are two ordered splits. For n=3, 2^(3-1)=4. That's correct. For n=4, 2^3=8. Let's think, for n=4 elements, the number of ordered pairs is 8. Each element can be in A or B, but A can't be empty or B can't be empty. So that's 16-2=14, but wait that's 14, not 8. There's a conflict here.

Wait, no, maybe I confused the formula. Wait, let me think again. The formula is that the number of ordered ways to split a set into two non-empty subsets is 2^(n-1) - 2, but I'm getting confused. Wait, the correct approach is that each element has two choices: A or B, but both cannot be empty. So the total number is 2^n - 2, but each split is counted once as (A,B) and once as (B,A), except when A and B are swapped. No, wait, that's not the case. Because when we split into A and B, the ordered pair is (A,B), but if you swap, you get (B,A), which is a different ordered pair. So the count is 2^n - 2, but wait, in the case of n=2, that's 4 - 2=2, which is correct. For n=3, 8-2=6. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3 gives 4 ordered splits. So now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should consult the formula. The number of ways to partition a set into two non-empty, ordered subsets is equal to the number of subsets A (excluding empty and the full set), multiplied by the number of subsets B (which is determined by A, since B is the complement). But since each ordered pair (A,B) is unique, the count is 2^(n) - 2, but this counts each ordered pair only once. But wait, no, because each split into A and B is unique, but each split is represented once in the count.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the number of ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are non-empty and A ∪ B = S, and A ∩ B = empty. And for each such pair, A and B are considered different if A is different from B.

The total number of such ordered pairs is 2^(n) - 2, because the only invalid cases are when A is empty or B is empty. So for n=5, 32-2=30. So the correct number is 30.

So the answer is E:30.
</think>

The number of ways to divide a set of 5 elements into two non-empty ordered subsets is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of the set (excluding the full set and empty set) multiplied by the number of their complements. This is calculated as 2^5 - 2 = 30. 

Answer: E:30
