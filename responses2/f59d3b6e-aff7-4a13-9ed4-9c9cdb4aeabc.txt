Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates and order determination. Hmm, I remember that the rate law depends on the reaction order. The question involves a reaction A → 2B. They've constructed some graphs and found out the orders.

The problem says that [A] vs. time and ln [A] vs. time give curved lines, but 1/[A] vs. time is a straight line. Wait, I think this has to do with the integrated rate laws for different orders.

Let me think. For a first-order reaction, the plot of ln[A] vs. time is a straight line. So for a first order, the graph should be linear. But in this case, the ln[A] graph isn't linear. Wait, no, wait. No, the problem says the ln[A] graph is curved. So that's not first order.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recap. The integrated rate laws for different orders:

First-order: ln[A] vs. t is linear.
Second-order: 1/[A] vs. t is linear.
Zeroth-order: [A] vs. t is linear.

So in the problem, [A] vs. t is curved, so it's not zeroth or first order. Wait, zeroth order would give a straight line. So that's not it. But since the [A] vs. t is curved, it's probably not first or zeroth. But wait, the problem says that ln[A] vs. t is curved, which would mean not first order. Because for first order, ln[A] is linear. So ln[A] is curved, so the reaction is not first order.

Wait, but that doesn't add up. Because if [A] vs. t is curved, that's not linear, so it's not first or zeroth. But wait, for zeroth order, [A] vs. t would be a straight line, but the problem says it's curved, so that's not zeroth order. So [A] vs. t being curved suggests it's either second or third order.

Wait, but looking at the problem again: [A] vs. time is curved, ln[A] vs. time is curved, but 1/[A] vs. time is straight. So, wait, if 1/[A] is linear, that suggests the reaction is second order, because for second-order reactions, 1/[A] versus time is linear.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If the reaction is second order, then the plot of 1/[A] vs. time should be linear. That's correct.

But wait, what about the [A] vs. time plot? For a second-order reaction, the concentration of A decreases over time, and the plot of [A] vs. time is a curve. For first-order, [A] decreases exponentially, so maybe its plot is a curve. Hmm. So if the [A] vs. time is curved, that doesn't fit second order. Because for second-order, [A] decreases but as a function like 1/[A] is linear. So perhaps the [A] vs. time being curved suggests a second order.

Wait, but let me think again. For a second-order reaction, [A] vs time is not linear. For example, the integrated rate law is 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A0], which is linear. So [A] would be 1/(kt + 1/[A0}). So it's a hyperbola-shaped curve, which is curved. So the [A] vs. time graph is curved, which matches the problem.

But the ln[A] vs. time for a second-order reaction? Wait, no. For a second-order reaction, the [A] vs. time is a hyperbola. So ln[A] would not be linear. Hmm. So if ln[A] is curved, that would suggest a different order.

Wait, no. Let me think about the integrated rate laws again. For a second-order reaction, the formula is 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A0], so [A] is 1/(kt + 1/[A0]). So as time increases, [A] decreases. So the plot of [A] vs. time would be a curve that approaches zero, getting closer as time increases. So it's a curved line, as the question states.

But what about ln[A]? Let me see. If [A] = 1/(kt + 1/[A0]), then ln[A] = ln(1/(kt + 1/[A0])) = -ln(kt + 1/[A0]). That's not linear. So ln[A] would not be a straight line. So that's consistent with the problem statement: ln[A] vs. time is curved. So [A] vs. time is curved, ln[A] vs. time is curved, but 1/[A] is straight.

Wait, but if 1/[A] is straight, then the reaction is second order. Because 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A0]. So yes, for a second-order reaction, 1/[A] is linear.

But wait, the problem states that [A] vs. time is curved. So what's the order then? Because for first-order, [A] decreases exponentially, so the plot is a curve. So [A] vs. time is not linear; it's curved.

So combining the information: the graph of 1/[A] vs. time is linear (so reaction is second order), but [A] vs. time is curved (so not first order). 

Wait, but the question says that both [A] vs. time and ln [A] vs. time are curved. But ln [A] vs. time would be non-linear if the reaction is not first or second order. Wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The integrated rate laws for different orders:

Zeroth order: [A] = [A0] - kt. So [A] vs time is straight line.

First order: ln[A] = ln[A0] - kt. So ln[A] vs time is straight line.

Second order: 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A0]. So 1/[A] vs time is straight line.

Third order: I'm not sure about that, but let me recall. For third-order, the integrated rate law might be something like 1/[A]^2 = 2kt + 1/[A0]^2. So 1/[A]^2 would be linear with time, implying third-order.

But the problem says that 1/[A] is linear, so that's a second order reaction.

But then, the [A] vs. time would be curved. Which is correct. Because for a second order reaction, [A] decreases, but in a way that as time increases, [A] approaches zero.

Wait, but the [A] vs time graph would be a hyperbola, which is a curve. Yes, that's correct.

So the reaction is second order, so the rate law is Rate = k [A]^2.

Looking at the options, option C is Rate = k [A]^2.

But wait, the question says that the 1/[A] graph is straight (so reaction is second order), but the [A] vs time is curved (which isn't a problem for being second order), because for second order, the [A] vs. t is a hyperbola, which is curved.

So the correct rate law is second order.

So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The problem involves determining the rate law for the reaction A → 2B based on the behavior of three graphs: [A] vs. time, ln[A] vs. time, and 1/[A] vs. time. The key observations are:

1. **[A] vs. time**: The graph is curved, which suggests that the reaction is not first-order (since [A] vs. time for first-order reactions decreases exponentially, leading to a curved line). It is also not zeroth-order (since [A] vs. time for zeroth-order reactions is a straight line).

2. **ln[A] vs. time**: The graph is curved, which indicates that the reaction is not first-order (since ln[A] vs. time for first-order reactions is linear). It is also not second-order (since ln[A] vs. time for second-order reactions is also linear).

3. **1/[A] vs. time**: The graph is straight, which confirms that the reaction is second-order. For a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is \( \frac{1}{[A]} = kt + \frac{1}{[A]_0} \), which is linear with respect to time.

Thus, the reaction is second-order, and the rate law is:

\[
\text{Rate} = k[A]^2
\]

This corresponds to option C.
