Okay, so I have this question about Arthur's principle about the "greater moral evil rule." Hmm. I'm not entirely sure what Arthur refers to, but I think it's a concept from Western philosophy, maybe something like Kant or some other philosopher. Let me try to piece together what this principle might mean.

The question gives me multiple-choice options, and I need to pick which one correctly describes the principle. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Morality itself is a great evil. That doesn't sound right. If morality were itself bad, then it would be a moral evil, but I think the principle is the opposite. Like, the idea that the greater moral evil is a problem to be addressed.

Option B: People should strive to commit the lesser evil, even if it results in personal gain. Wait, no, the principle says to avoid the greater evil, so I think B is the opposite. Because if you can't avoid the greater, you should do the lesser, which sounds more like a positive principle. But I'm not certain. Maybe not.

Option C: The person who commits the greater evil is morally responsible. That doesn't make sense either. Because if you're the one causing the greater evil, you should be held accountable. So if someone did the greater evil, they're the one responsible. So option C is saying that the greater evil is committed by a person, so they're morally wrong. Which contradicts the principle.

Option D: People are entitled to keep their earnings only if there's no way to prevent a greater evil by giving them away. Hmm, this sounds a bit confusing. If earnings are kept only if it's impossible to prevent a greater evil by giving them away, that might suggest that the person is obligated to keep their money unless it's a way to avoid a worse situation. But I'm not sure if D aligns with the principle that the greater evil is the one to be addressed, regardless of how it's done.

Option E: People are morally obligated to share their wealth if it can prevent a greater evil. That sounds a bit like D but maybe more about sharing to avoid greater evil. So if sharing prevents a greater evil, then people are obliged to share. But I'm not sure if that's the same as the "greater evil rule," which is about avoiding the greater evil regardless of how it's done.

Option F: Being rich is a great moral evil, and we should all live on a moderate income. This seems like the opposite of the principle. If being rich is a moral evil, then people shouldn't be so wealthy. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: The greater moral evil is a concept stating that it's always wrong to do evil, regardless of circumstances. I'm not sure about this one. Some ethical theories do say that all evil is inherently wrong, but I think the "greater evil" principle is more about avoiding the worst possible evil, not necessarily that all evil is inherently wrong. So G might not be the right answer.

Option H: Two moral evils do not make a moral good. That sounds more like it's about the trivium or something else. Not sure. Maybe it's about the idea that two evils don't create a good; but I'm not certain how this applies to the principle.

Option I: People are allowed to do a smaller evil to prevent a greater one. This seems like the opposite of the principle. Instead, I think the principle would say that we should avoid the greater evil, but if a smaller one is unavoidable, people shouldn't do it. So this option I is the opposite.

Option J: The concept of evil is subjective and varies from person to person. That's not the principle; this is more about the nature of evil being relative. The "greater evil" is about the worst possible evil, not the view that different people see different evils. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The question is about Arthur's principle. I think the "greater moral evil" principle is about the idea that the person who commits the greatest moral harm is morally wrong. So the idea is that the greater evil is a problem to be addressed, not that people should avoid it unless they can't.

Looking back at the options, option A says morality itself is a great evil. That seems opposite. Option B says people should commit the lesser evil, even if it's personal gain. That sounds like the opposite of the principleâ€”practitioners would choose to avoid greater evil, not to allow it.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think of the actual axiom. The "greater moral evil" is the principle that the person who is the cause of the worst possible evil is morally wrong. So, you can't choose to do a greater evil; you have to avoid it because the principle says you can't. So the principle is about the greater evil, not the lesser.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state it. But looking, option E says people are morally obligated to share their wealth if it can prevent a greater evil. That aligns with the idea that the person is obliged to take action to avoid the greater evil. So option E says that if sharing prevents a greater evil, people must share.

Wait, but the principle is about the person's responsibility to avoid the greater evil, regardless of how it's done. So option E says that sharing is morally required if it prevents a greater evil, which is a way of saying that you have to do something to avoid it, but it's not necessarily about being allowed to do it.

Wait, let me think again. The principle is that you should avoid the greater evil. So if you can avoid it by sharing, you must do so. So the principle is that you can't avoid the greater evil. Therefore, people are morally obligated to do the actions that can prevent it. So the correct statement would be that people are morally required to share their wealth (E) if it prevents a greater evil.

So option E is correct. Alternatively, another thought: option J says evil is subjective. That's not the principle, it's about the nature of evil being relative. The principle is about the principle of the greater evil, so it's about avoiding the worst evil.

So the correct answer is E.

The principle Arthur refers to is about the "greater moral evil," which states that the person responsible for committing the worst possible evil is morally wrong. This principle does not advocate for avoiding the greater evil, but rather for the actions that prevent it. Among the options provided, option E aligns with this principle by stating that sharing wealth is morally required to prevent a greater evil, reflecting the obligation to act to avoid the greater evil. 

**Answer: E**
