Okay, so I've got this question about moral arguments and what the Hare says. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is asking what the Hare claims about all moral arguments. The options are A: useless, B: valid, C: ad hominem, D: sound.

Hmm, I remember from my philosophy class that Hare is a well-known philosopher for his argument against utilitarianism. He argues that moral arguments aren't just about actions but also about the people involved. So, he says that the focus should be on the morality of people rather than just the outcomes or actions. 

Wait, so if Hare says that moral arguments are useless, that would mean they don't contribute anything. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the other options. Option B is valid, which would mean that the arguments are logically sound, but Hare's arguments are more about ethics and people's actions, not just logic. So maybe B isn't correct.

Option C is ad hominem, which is attacking the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. Hare's argument isn't about attacking Hare's credibility; it's about the morality of the person. So C doesn't fit.

Option D is sound, which is both valid and true. But again, Hare's arguments aren't about the validity of the actions, so I don't think they're sound.

Wait, but the question is about what Hare claims all moral arguments are. So he's probably saying that all moral arguments are useless. Because his main point is to show that arguments based on actions alone aren't good enough. So if the Hare's claim is that all moral arguments are useless, then the correct answer would be A.

Let me double-check. The question says, "Hare claims that all moral arguments are: " and then the options. So Hare is making a general statement about all moral arguments. If Hare is saying that all of them are useless, that would fit. Because his counterargument is that arguments should focus on the person's morality, not just their actions.

So the answer should be A: useless.
</think>

The correct answer is A: useless. Hare's argument posits that moral arguments are not useful because they should focus on the moral nature of individuals rather than their actions. 

Answer: A
