Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about discrete random variables. Let me think through each option step by step. The question is asking which statement is NOT true for all discrete random variables. All of them are true except one. 

Hmm, let's start with what I know about discrete random variables. Discrete variables are those that can only take on a countable number of distinct values. So they can be like the number of heads in three coin flips or something. They have a probability distribution, and each possible outcome has a probability.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean. Wait, isn't this the 68-95-99.7 rule? Oh wait, that's the empirical rule, which applies to normal distributions. But wait, the question says it's about all discrete random variables. Does that rule apply to all discrete variables, even those not following a normal distribution? I remember that the empirical rule is about normal distributions. But wait, for any distribution, not just normal, the rule doesn't necessarily hold. Like, if a distribution is skewed, the percentages might differ. So A might not be true for all discrete variables. Alternatively, wait, no. Because the empirical rule is about the normal distribution, but the question is about all discrete variables. So if a discrete variable isn't normally distributed, would 95% of the outcomes fall within two standard deviations? Or is that a rule only for continuous variables? Hmm, wait, the 68-95-99.7 rule applies to normal distributions, which are a subset of continuous random variables. So for discrete variables, which can be approximated by continuous ones (like binomial or Poisson approximations), maybe it's a rough approximation. So for all discrete variables, the statement might not hold exactly. But wait, I'm not too sure. Sometimes I think that for any distribution, the probability within 2σ is about 95%, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the statement is true for all. Wait, no. Because for discrete variables, like a binomial distribution with n=1, the mean is p, variance p(1-p). So sigma is sqrt(p(1-p)). For n=1, the possible outcomes are 0 or 1. The mean is p, variance p(1-p), so 2 sigma is 2*sqrt(p(1-p)). So for p=0.5, 2 sigma is sqrt(0.25) = 0.5. So 95% of the outcomes are within two sigmas? Wait, but in reality, the binomial(1, 0.5) has two outcomes. So 0 and 1. The mean is 0.5, and the standard deviation is sqrt(0.25) = 0.5. So the two standard deviations would be 0.5 ± 0.5, which is 0 and 1. So all possible outcomes are within two standard deviations. That's 100% for n=1. So perhaps in that case, the statement is true. But wait, for a binomial distribution with n=2 and p=0.5, the outcomes are 0,1,2. Mean is 1, variance is 0.5, standard deviation is sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707. So two standard deviations is about 1.414. The outcomes are 0,1,2. The mean is 1. So 1 - 1.414 is negative, which would be 0. So the two standard deviations are from 1 - 1.414 (negative) up to 1 + 1.414 (2.414). So the possible outcomes 0 and 1 are within 2σ. 2 is the upper limit. So 0 and 1 are within 2σ, and 2 is above. So 2 outcomes are within, 1 is outside. So 66.6% of the time (since 2/3). So that would be approximately 66.6% within. So the statement A says approximately 95% would be within two standard deviations. But in this case, it's only 66.6%. So that's not 95%. So for this variable, the statement is false. Wait, but the statement says "approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean." But for this case, it's only about 66.6%. So that would mean the statement isn't true for all discrete variables. So that's a problem because the question is asking which statement is NOT true for all. So option A is the false statement.

Option B: The possible outcomes must all be numerical. Hmm, yes, because by definition, a random variable assigns numerical values to outcomes. So for a discrete variable, the possible outcomes are numerical. So B is definitely true.

Option C: The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive. Wait, mutually exclusive means that two outcomes cannot occur at the same time. But for a random variable's outcomes, each outcome is distinct and can't happen at the same time. So the outcomes are mutually exclusive. So C is true.

Option D: The sum of all probabilities for all possible outcomes is always 1. Yes, that's the definition of a probability distribution. So D is correct.

Option E: The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability. That's the definition of expected value. So E is correct.

So the incorrect statement is option A. Because for a binomial distribution with n=2, p=0.5, the outcomes are 0,1,2. The mean is 1, the standard deviation is sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707. Two standard deviations are about 1.414. The possible outcomes are 0 and 1 are within that range, but 2 is not. So 2/3 of the time (approx 66.6%) are within. So 95% isn't accurate, which makes A false. Thus, the answer is A.

The question asks which statement is NOT true for all discrete random variables. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A:** The statement claims that approximately 95% of outcomes fall within two standard deviations of the mean. This is an oversimplification and only holds true for normally distributed continuous variables. For discrete variables, particularly those like the binomial distribution with \( n=2 \), the empirical rule (which assumes normality) does not apply exactly. For example, with \( n=2 \), 66.6% of outcomes fall within two standard deviations. Thus, this statement is false for discrete variables.

- **Option B:** Discrete random variables have numerical outcomes. This is a fundamental property, so the statement is true.

- **Option C:** Discrete random variables' outcomes are mutually exclusive. This is correct because each outcome is distinct and cannot occur simultaneously.

- **Option D:** The sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes is always 1. This is a key property of probability distributions, so the statement is true.

- **Option E:** The expected value is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. This is the definition of expected value, so the statement is true.

The incorrect statement is **Option A**, as it does not hold true for all discrete random variables.
