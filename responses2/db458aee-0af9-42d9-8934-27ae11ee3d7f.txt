Okay, so I've got this question about angle-modulated signals, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The given signal is v(t) = A cos[ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t)]. I remember that angle modulation can come in different forms like amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM). I think this is a frequency modulation because the carrier is multiplied by a sum of cosine terms that vary with time.

Wait, wait. The general formula for frequency modulation is v(t) = A cos(ω_c t + 2π f_m cos(2π f_m t) + ... ), where f_m is the modulation frequency. So in this case, the terms inside the cosine are 2 cos(60π t) and 5 cos(40π t). Each of these is a sideband component.

Let me think about the maximum phase deviation. Phase modulation usually uses the formula v(t) = A cos(ω_c t + β cos(2π f_m t)), where β is the phase deviation. In this case, the terms are 2 cos(60π t) and 5 cos(40π t). So I think the modulation index is the sum of these coefficients, but wait, no. Wait, no, in amplitude modulation, the maximum phase deviation is given by β, which is the coefficient multiplied by the amplitude of the modulating signal. But wait, in FM, the maximum phase deviation is β times the amplitude of the modulating signal. But in this case, the problem might be referring to the modulation index as the sum of the frequencies, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says that the signal is v(t) = A cos(ω_c t + 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t)). So the modulating part is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t). Hmm, so the modulating signal is a sum of two cosine functions. Each would correspond to a frequency of 30 Hz (since 60π t is 60π rad per second, but 2π f, so f=30 Hz), and 20 Hz.

Wait, but in frequency modulation, the maximum phase deviation is β, which is the amplitude of the modulating signal. But wait, in this case, the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t). So the maximum value of the modulating signal is 2+5=7? Or is β the maximum value of the coefficient in front of the cosine terms? Because in the standard FM equation, the modulation index is β, which is the coefficient in front of the cosine term. So in this problem, each term is 2cos(...), so the maximum modulation index is 2 * 2=4? Or wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The given expression is v(t) = A cos(ω_c t + 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t)). So the argument of the cosine is ω_c t plus 2 times cos(60π t) plus 5 times cos(40π t). 

In frequency modulation, the instantaneous phase is ω_c t + 2π f_m cos(2π f_m t) + ... , where f_m is the modulation frequency. So in this case, the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t). Let's compute the maximum value of this modulating signal. Since each cosine term varies between -1 and +1, the maximum value of the modulating signal is 2+5=7. Because if cos(60π t) is 1 and cos(40π t) is 1, then the sum is 7. So the amplitude of the modulating signal is 7. 

Wait, but in FM, the maximum phase deviation is β times the amplitude of the modulating signal. Wait, no. Wait, the phase deviation is given by β multiplied by the modulating signal. So maximum phase deviation would be β * Am, where Am is the amplitude of the modulating signal.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the general formula. The phase deviation is usually β * cos(2π f_m t), where β is the modulation index, which is the maximum value of the amplitude of the modulating signal. In the given problem, the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t). The maximum value of this is 2 * 1 + 5 * 1 =7. So the maximum phase deviation is β, which is 7. Wait, but the maximum phase deviation would be β * Am, where Am is the amplitude of the modulating signal. No, wait, the phase deviation is usually β multiplied by the modulating signal. Wait, wait, I'm confused.

Wait, another approach: In frequency modulation, the instantaneous phase shift is ω_c t + 2π f_m cos(2π f_m t). The instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase with respect to time. So the phase is ω_c t + 2π f_m cos(2π f_m t). The derivative of that is ω_c - (2π f_m)(2π f_m) sin(2π f_m t). So that's ω_c - (4π² f_m²) sin(2π f_m t). The instantaneous frequency is f_c minus the term in the bracket.

So the maximum change in frequency occurs when the sin term is at its maximum (i.e., +1 or -1). So the instantaneous frequency is f_c ± (4π² f_m²). So the maximum frequency deviation is (4π² f_m²).

Wait, that's for frequency modulation. So for this problem, f_m would be the modulation frequency. But in the given expression, the terms are 2cos(60π t) and 5cos(40π t). So the modulating signal is the sum of two cosine terms. So the maximum value of the modulating signal is 2 +5=7, but when it's multiplied by the cosine, that's the amplitude. So the modulation index β is 7.

Wait, wait, but in standard FM, the modulation index β is the amplitude of the modulating signal. So if the modulating signal's amplitude is 7, then β is 7.

But wait, wait. Wait, the given modulating terms are 2cos(60π t) and 5cos(40π t). So if I think about the amplitude of the modulating signal, each term's amplitude is 2 and 5. So the maximum amplitude is 7. So β is 7.

So for part (A), the maximum phase deviation is β * Am? Or is it just β? Because in my earlier calculation, I thought the phase deviation is β multiplied by the modulating signal, which is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t), but I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let me clarify. In frequency modulation, the phase deviation is given by β * cos(2π f_m t). So the phase deviation is β times the modulating signal. So the maximum phase deviation would be β times the maximum value of the modulating signal. But wait, the modulating signal is the sum of 2 and 5, which is 7. So the maximum phase deviation is β * 7. But wait, wait—no. Because the phase deviation is β multiplied by the amplitude of the modulating signal, which is the maximum value of the modulating signal. So if the modulating signal has a maximum value of 7, then the phase deviation is β times 7.

But wait, wait, no. Because in the given expression, the modulating signal is 2 cos (60π t) +5 cos(40π t). So each term's amplitude is 2 and 5. The total modulating amplitude is 2+5=7. So the maximum phase deviation would be β times 7. But wait, no, I think I'm mixing the concepts.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum phase deviation is simply β, the amplitude of the modulator, which is the sum of the amplitudes of the two terms. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, another approach: the phase deviation in FM is given by β * cos(2π f_m t + ... ), where β is the modulating index, which is the amplitude of the modulating signal. So the maximum phase deviation is β. But wait, in this case, the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t), which has a maximum value of 7. So the amplitude of the modulating signal is 7, so β is 7. So the maximum phase deviation is β, which is 7. But wait, this is not matching any of the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E has maximum phase deviation as 7 and instantaneous frequency deviation 86.6 Hz.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

The maximum phase deviation is β. But in some cases, like when the modulating signal is a single sinusoid, the maximum phase deviation is β. But in this case, the modulating signal is a sum of two sinusoids. So perhaps the maximum phase deviation is the maximum value of the modulating signal multiplied by β. Wait, but β is the amplitude of the modulating signal. So the maximum phase deviation is β * Am. But Am is the maximum of the modulating signal, which is 7. So maximum phase deviation would be β * 7. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum phase deviation is simply β, which is the amplitude of the modulating signal (i.e., 7), because the phase deviation is β multiplied by the amplitude, but in this case, β is 7. So that would make the maximum phase deviation 7 radians.

Wait, but the options suggest maximum phase deviation is 7, but I'm not sure. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option E says maximum phase deviation is 7 radians. So that would fit.

Wait, but wait. Another way: Suppose the modulation index is 7. Then the maximum phase deviation is β, which is 7. So for part (A) the maximum phase deviation is 7 radians.

Wait, but wait another thought: in the standard FM equation, the phase deviation is β * cos(2π f_m t), and the maximum phase deviation is β. So if β is 7, then the maximum phase deviation is 7 radians. So option E's first part (A) is 7.

So that's option E's part (A) is 7. Now, that's one part done.

Now, part (B) is the instantaneous frequency deviation at t = 1/30 seconds.

The instantaneous frequency deviation in FM is given by the derivative of the phase with respect to time. The phase is ω_c t + 2π f_m cos(2π f_m t) + ... So the instantaneous frequency is f_c + 2π f_m cos(2π f_m t) + ... 

Wait, no. Let me think about the derivative again. The phase is ω_c t + 2π f_m cos(2π f_m t) + 5π f_m cos(2π f_m t) ?

Wait, wait, the given signal is v(t) = A cos(ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t)).

So the argument is ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t). 

Wait, in the standard FM equation, the phase is ω_c t + β cos(2π f_m t). So in this case, the β would be 7, and f_m is the modulation frequency. But wait, the modulating terms are 60π t and 40π t. So each term represents a frequency of 30 Hz and 20 Hz, respectively.

Wait, but in the standard equation, β is the amplitude of the modulating signal. So in this case, the modulating signal is the sum of 2 and 5, which is 7, so β is 7.

The modulation frequency f_m is the frequency corresponding to the highest frequency term, which is 60π / (2π) = 30 Hz.

Wait, but wait. The given terms are 2 cos(60π t) and 5 cos(40π t). So each term's frequency is 60π/(2π) =30 Hz and 40π/(2π)=20 Hz. So the modulation frequency is 30 Hz.

Wait, but wait: in the given expression, the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t). So is the modulation frequency 60 Hz? Because 60π t corresponds to 30 Hz, 40π t corresponds to 20 Hz. So the highest modulation frequency is 30 Hz.

Wait, but in the standard FM equation, the modulation index β is the amplitude of the modulating signal. So if the modulating signal has a maximum value of 7, then β is 7. So the maximum phase deviation is 7 radians, which matches option E's part (A).

But wait, let me think about the phase deviation again. The phase deviation is β * cos(2π f_m t + ... ), so the maximum deviation is β. So for part (A), the maximum phase deviation is 7 radians.

Now, for part (B), the instantaneous frequency deviation at t=1/30 seconds.

The instantaneous frequency is f = f_c + (β) * cos(2π f_m t) + ... wait, no. Wait, the phase is ω_c t + β cos(2π f_m t). So the instantaneous frequency is (d/dt) phase / (2π). Let's compute this.

The phase is ω_c t + β cos(2π f_m t).

The derivative of phase w.r. to t is ω_c - 2π f_m β sin(2π f_m t).

So the instantaneous frequency is (ω_c - 2π f_m β sin(2π f_m t)) / (2π) = f_c - f_m β sin(2π f_m t).

Hmm. Wait, but wait, since the carrier frequency is f_c = ω_c / 2π. So substituting that, f_c = (ω_c) / (2π).

Wait, in this case, the phase is ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t).

So, the phase is ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t).

The derivative of phase with respect to t is ω_c - 2*(60π) sin(60π t) - 5*(40π) sin(40π t).

But wait, no, because the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x) * x's derivative. So for each term:

d/dt [2 cos(60π t)] = -2 * 60π sin(60π t)
d/dt [5 cos(40π t)] = -5 *40π sin(40π t)

So the instantaneous frequency is (ω_c - 2*60π sin(60π t) -5*40π sin(40π t)) / (2π).

Which can be written as f_c - (60π * 2 sin(60π t) + 40π *5 sin(40π t)) ) / (2π )

Simplify:

f_c - [ 120π sin(60π t) + 200π sin(40π t) ) ] / (2π )

Divide by 2π:

f_c - [ (120π)/(2π) sin(60π t) + (200π)/(2π) sin(40π t) ) ]

Simplify each term:

120π/(2π) = 60, and 200π/(2π)=100.

So f(t) = f_c - [60 sin(60π t) + 100 sin(40π t) ]

Wait, but that can't be right. Because each term inside the brackets would be the modulating signal. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute.

The instantaneous frequency is:

f(t) = (d/dt phase) / (2π) 

Phase = ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t)

d/dt phase = ω_c - 2*(60π) sin(60π t) -5*(40π) sin(40π t)

So,

f(t) = [ ω_c - 120π sin(60π t) -200π sin(40π t) ] / (2π )

Now, divide each term by 2π:

= [ω_c/(2π)] - [120π/(2π) sin(60π t)] - [ 200π/(2π) sin(40π t) ]

Simplify each term:

ω_c/(2π) = f_c.

120π/(2π) = 60.

200π/(2π) =100.

So f(t) = f_c - [ 60 sin(60π t) + 100 sin(40π t) ]

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the maximum possible value of the modulating term is 60 +100=160. So the instantaneous frequency would be f_c minus a function whose amplitude is 160.

Wait, but when the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t), the maximum modulating amplitude is 2+5=7. So, the term inside the brackets would have a maximum of 60 *7 +100 *7? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, the instantaneous frequency is f_c - [ 120π sin(60π t) + 200π sin(40π t) ] / (2π )

Which simplifies to f_c - (60 sin(60π t) + 100 sin(40π t)) )

So the maximum possible deviation from f_c is when the sin terms are at their maximum. So each sin term contributes up to 60 and 100, respectively. So the maximum instantaneous frequency deviation is 60 +100 =160 Hz.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula for the phase. Let me try to recompute.

Wait, phase is ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t).

d/dt phase = ω_c - 2*(60π) sin(60π t) -5*(40π) sin(40π t)

So,

d/dt phase = ω_c - 120π sin(60π t) -200π sin(40π t)

So,

f(t) = (d/dt phase) / (2π) = (ω_c -120π sin(60π t) -200π sin(40π t) ) / (2π )

Which simplifies to:

f_c - (120π)/(2π) sin(60π t) - (200π)/(2π) sin(40π t )

Simplify each term:

120π/(2π)=60, 200π/(2π)=100.

So,

f(t) = f_c - [60 sin(60π t) +100 sin(40π t) ]

Wait, that can't be correct because the maximum value of the modulating signal is 60 +100=160, so the maximum deviation from f_c would be 160 Hz.

But looking back at the options, the maximum frequency deviation in option E is 86.6 Hz. So where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait a second. Perhaps I'm confusing the frequency modulation index β. Earlier, I thought β was the amplitude of the modulating signal, which was 7, but perhaps in this scenario, the amplitude of the modulating signal is the sum of the amplitudes of each term.

Wait, but in the standard FM equation, the modulation index β is the peak value of the modulating signal. So if the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t), then the maximum value of the modulating signal is 7. So β is 7.

But in that case, the maximum phase deviation is β, which is 7, but then the options don't match. Wait, but perhaps in this scenario, β is not the maximum of the modulating signal but the sum of the amplitudes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me reevaluate.

The given signal is v(t) = A cos(ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t) ).

So the modulating signal is 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t). Let's compute the maximum value of this modulating signal.

The amplitude of 2cos(60π t) is 2, and the amplitude of 5cos(40π t) is 5. So the maximum of the modulating signal is 2 +5 =7. So the maximum phase deviation is 7 radians.

Now, for the frequency deviation, let's compute it at t=1/30.

The instantaneous frequency is f_c + [ -120π sin(60π t) -200π sin(40π t) ] / (2π )

Wait, but the formula is:

f(t) = (d/dt phase) / (2π )

So phase is ω_c t + 2 cos(60π t) +5 cos(40π t).

d/dt phase = ω_c - 120π sin(60π t) -200π sin(40π t)

Divide by 2π:

f(t) = [ω_c]/(2π) - [120π sin(60π t) +200π sin(40π t)]/(2π *2π)

Wait, no. Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it correctly.

f(t) = [ω_c - 120π sin(60π t) -200π sin(40π t) ] / (2π )

So,

f(t) = [ω_c / (2π) ] - [120π/(2π) sin(60π t) ] - [200π/(2π) sin(40π t) ]

Which simplifies to:

f_c -60 sin(60π t) -100 sin(40π t)

So at t=1/30, we can compute sin(60π t) and sin(40π t).

Compute 60π t: t=1/30 → 60π*(1/30)=2π.

Similarly, 40π t=40π*(1/30)= (40/30)π= (4/3)π.

So, sin(60π t)=sin(2π)=0.

sin(40π t)=sin(4π/3) = -√3/2.

So,

f(t) = f_c -60*(0) -100*(-√3/2 )

= f_c - (0) + 50√3

But wait, the carrier frequency f_c is ω_c/(2π). So, ω_c is the angular frequency of the carrier.

But wait, in the given signal, the argument is ω_c t + 2cos(60π t) +5cos(40π t). So, the carrier frequency (f_c) is ω_c/(2π), but I don't know the value of ω_c. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any options for ω_c, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but looking at the options, the maximum frequency deviation is 86.6 Hz, which is 86.6 = 50√3 ≈ 86.6. Wait, 50√3 is approximately 86.6, yes.

So, f(t) = f_c +50√3.

Wait, but the carrier is at f_c = ω_c/(2π).

Wait, but in the problem, the given signal doesn't specify the carrier's frequency. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the carrier is at a certain frequency, but given that the options include 50√3, which is approximately 86.6, perhaps the carrier is at f_c = 150 Hz, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but let's think again. The maximum frequency deviation is 50√3 Hz, which is option E's second part.

Wait, but if the maximum frequency deviation is 50√3, that's 50 times the square root of 3, which is approximately 86.6.

So, the calculation at t=1/30 gives f(t) = f_c -60 sin(60π t) -100 sin(40π t).

At t=1/30, 60π t =2π, sin(2π)=0.

40π t= (4/3)π, sin(4π/3)= -√3/2.

So,

f(t) = f_c -60*0 -100*(-√3/2 )

= f_c +50√3.

So the maximum frequency deviation is 50√3 Hz, which is approximately 86.6 Hz.

So, the options are:

E) 7, 86.6.

So, the maximum phase deviation is 7 radians, and the maximum frequency deviation is 50√3 Hz, which is approximately 86.6 Hz.

But wait, looking at the options, the maximum phase deviation is 7 radians, and the maximum frequency deviation is 50√3 Hz, which is 86.6 Hz.

So, the correct answer should be E) 7, 86.6.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) Max phase 3, freq dev 120.

B) Max phase 5, freq dev 60.

C) Max phase 7, freq dev 50√3.

D) Max phase 7, freq dev 70.

E) Max phase 7, freq dev 86.6.

So, according to our calculation, E is correct.

But let's make sure. Let me recompute the phase deviation.

Wait, the maximum phase deviation is 7, because the maximum of the modulating signal is 7.

So, the maximum phase deviation is 7.

When t=1/30, the phase deviation is calculated as:

f(t) = f_c +50√3.

Wait, but the maximum frequency deviation is 50√3, which is approximately 86.6 Hz.

So, the correct answer is E.
</think>

The given signal is \( v(t) = A \cos(\omega_c t + 2\cos(60\pi t) + 5\cos(40\pi t)) \). To determine the maximum phase deviation and the instantaneous frequency deviation at \( t = \frac{1}{30} \) seconds, we analyze the components:

### Phase Deviation Analysis:
1. **Maximum Modulating Signal Amplitude**:  
   The modulating signal is \( 2\cos(60\pi t) + 5\cos(40\pi t) \). The amplitudes are 2 and 5, respectively. The maximum modulating amplitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \).

2. **Maximum Phase Deviation**:  
   The phase deviation is given by \( \beta \), where \( \beta \) is the amplitude of the modulating signal. Here, \( \beta = 7 \). Thus, the maximum phase deviation is **7 radians**.

### Instantaneous Frequency Deviation:
1. **Frequency Modulation Formula**:  
   The instantaneous frequency is given by:
   \[
   f(t) = f_c - \left( \frac{120\pi \sin(60\pi t) + 200\pi \sin(40\pi t)}{2\pi} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   f(t) = f_c - 60\sin(60\pi t) - 100\sin(40\pi t)
   \]

2. **Evaluating at \( t = \frac{1}{30} \)**:  
   - \( 60\pi t = 60\pi \cdot \frac{1}{30} = 2\pi \), \(\sin(2\pi) = 0\).  
   - \( 40\pi t = 40\pi \cdot \frac{1}{30} = \frac{4}{3}\pi \), \(\sin\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).  
   Substituting:
   \[
   f\left(\frac{1}{30}\right) = f_c - 60(0) - 100\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
   \]
   \[
   f\left(\frac{1}{30}\right) = f_c + 50\sqrt{3} \approx f_c + 86.6 \, \text{Hz}
   \]

Thus, the maximum instantaneous frequency deviation at \( t = \frac{1}{30} \) is approximately **86.6 Hz**.

### Correct Answer:
The maximum phase deviation is **7 radians**, and the maximum instantaneous frequency deviation is **86.6 Hz**. Therefore, the correct option is **E**.

ANSWER: E
