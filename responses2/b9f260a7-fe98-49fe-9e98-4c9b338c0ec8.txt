Question:

What is meant when it is said that "the accelerator is asymmetric "?

Options:

A: The accelerator inversely affects the level of investment and capital creation
B: The accelerator is only operational during periods of economic boom
C: The acceleration principle applies only when the required capital for a certain level of output is greater than the available capital, but does not apply in the reverse situation
D: The accelerator is a term used to describe the fluctuating interest rates on capital loans
E: The acceleration principle applies only when the available capital for a certain level of output is greater than the required capital, but does not apply in the reverse situation
F: The accelerator affects only the service sector but not the manufacturing sector
G: The accelerator applies equally to capital surplus and deficit
H: The accelerator only applies when required capital is less than available capital
I: The accelerator applies to the rate of technological innovation in capital goods
J: The accelerator refers to the rate of capital depreciation

Okay, so I've got this question about the accelerator and I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see... the question is asking about what it means when it's said that the accelerator is asymmetric. 

Hmm, I remember that the accelerator effect is part of neoclassical economics. It's about how investments and capital creation are affected by the rate of saving. Wait, right, the accelerator is the concept that a higher rate of saving leads to a greater increase in investment over time. So, the accelerator is a multiplier factor. 

The question is about the asymmetry part. Asymmetric usually means that the effect isn't the same in all situations. So the accelerator effect might have different impacts depending on the economic context. 

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: The accelerator inversely affects investment and capital creation. Wait, I thought the accelerator is a positive factor that amplifies saving. So if a person's saving rate increases, investment and capital creation go up. So A says inverse, which doesn't sound right. I'm thinking A is incorrect because the accelerator is positive, not inverse.

Option B: The accelerator is only operational during economic booms. That doesn't sound right either. The accelerator's effect is more about the rate of saving and the level of investment, which probably are more about the overall economy, not just during booms. Plus, I don't think it's only during boom times. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: The acceleration principle applies only when the required capital is greater than available. Wait, I'm trying to remember. The accelerator principle, I think, is about the point at which capital becomes surplus or deficit. So when the capital needed to produce a certain level of output is more than available, the acceleration effect kicks in. So if required capital is greater than available, then the accelerator applies, which is C. But does it apply only in that situation? I think the accelerator principle is about when capital is surplus. So C says it applies only when required capital is greater than available. That sounds correct. So C could be a candidate.

Option D: The accelerator is a term for fluctuating interest rates on capital loans. That doesn't make sense. The accelerator is about investment, not interest rates. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: The accelerator applies only when available capital exceeds required. Wait, that's opposite of C. So E says when available capital is greater than required, the accelerator applies. But I think the accelerator applies when required capital is more than available. So E is the opposite, so probably wrong.

Option F: Accelerator affects service vs. manufacturing. I don't think the accelerator is about the type of industry. It's more about the overall economy. So F is wrong.

Option G: Accelerator affects capital surplus and deficit equally. That doesn't seem right. I remember that the accelerator effect leads to different rates of growth depending on whether there's a surplus or deficit. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Accelerator only when required is less than available. Wait, if required capital is less than available, then the accelerator applies. H says only when required is less, which is the opposite of what I thought. So H is wrong.

Option I: Accelerator applies to technological innovation in capital goods. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. The accelerator effect is about investment and capital creation, not technological changes. So I don't think I is correct.

Option J: Accelerator refers to capital depreciation rates. No, that's not right. The accelerator is about investment and capital creation. So J is wrong.

Wait, wait, let me recheck. Option C says the accelerator applies only when required capital is greater than available. But the accelerator works when the required capital (the capital needed to produce a certain output level) is greater than the available capital. So when the capital required is more than what's available, the accelerator effect kicks in. That makes sense. So option C is correct. 

Alternatively, looking at option E: it states that the accelerator applies only when available capital is greater than required. Which would mean that the accelerator effect is only active when available capital is sufficient to cover the needed capital, so the accelerator effect isn't in play. But that's the opposite of the correct scenario. So E is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C: "The acceleration principle applies only when the required capital for a certain level of output is greater than the available capital, but does not apply in the reverse situation."

**Explanation:**  
The accelerator effect, in economics, refers to the phenomenon where a higher rate of saving leads to a greater increase in investment and capital creation over time. The term "asymmetric" indicates that this effect may vary depending on the economic context. Specifically, the accelerator effect is most pronounced when the required capital to produce a certain level of output exceeds the available capital. This creates a situation where investment growth accelerates. Conversely, when the available capital exceeds the required capital, the accelerator effect does not apply, as the economy has reached a point of surplus capital. This asymmetry highlights the dynamic nature of economic systems, where the accelerator's impact varies based on the balance between saving and investment.
