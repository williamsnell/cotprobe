Okay, so I have this problem here about hiker boots and manufacturing costs. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that a pair of hiking boots costs $25 to produce. Sure-grip Shoe Co. wants to sell them for 15% more than they cost to produce. I need to find the manufacturer's increase over the cost. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, so the cost to produce is $25. They want to sell them at a 15% markup. Wait, does that mean they sell them for 15% more than the cost, or that the selling price is 15% more than the production cost? I think it's the former. So, the selling price is 25 plus 15% of 25.

Let me calculate 15% of 25. 15% is 0.15, so 0.15 * 25 = 3.75. So, the selling price is 25 + 3.75 = $28.75.

But wait, the question is about the increase over the cost. The cost is $25, and the selling price is $28.75. So the increase is 28.75 - 25 = $3.75.

Looking at the options, option J is $3.75. So the answer should be J.

The manufacturing increase over the cost is the 15% markup. Calculating:

15% of $25 = 0.15 * 25 = $3.75.

The increase is $3.75, which is option J.

Answer: J
