Okay, so I've got this question about the intrinsic value of a preferred share. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but let me think this through. 

The question says that a preferred share pays $1.90 per year in dividends, and the required rate of return is 9%. I need to find the intrinsic value. 

Wait, I remember that preferred stock is similar to bonds in that they don't pay interest; instead, they pay a fixed dividend. So the formula for calculating the intrinsic value of a preferred share should be the same as for the value of a perpetuity. Oh right, because preferred stock is essentially an infinite dividend payment stream.

The formula for the present value of a perpetuity is PV = D / r, where D is the annual dividend and r is the required rate of return. So in this case, D is $1.90 and r is 9%, which is 0.09 in decimal form.

So plugging in the numbers: PV = 1.90 / 0.09. Let me calculate that. 1.90 divided by 0.09. Hmm, 0.09 goes into 1.90 how many times?

Wait, 0.09 times 20 is 1.80. Because 0.09 times 20 is 1.8. So 1.90 minus 1.80 leaves 0.10. Then, 0.09 goes into 0.10 about 1.11 times. Because 0.09 * 1.11 is about 0.0999, which is roughly 0.10. So the total is 20 + 1.11 = 21.11. 

But wait, let me do the division more accurately. 1.90 ÷ 0.09. Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 190 ÷ 9. 

9 goes into 190 how many times? 9 * 21 is 189, which leaves a remainder of 1. So it's 21 with a remainder of 1, which is 21.111... So the value is approximately $21.11.

Looking at the options, option J is 21.00, which is close, but I should double-check. Oh wait, the exact calculation: 1.90 / 0.09. Let me do it step by step.

0.09 * 20 = 1.80

Subtract from 1.90: 1.90 - 1.80 = 0.10.

0.09 * x = 0.10 → x = 0.10 / 0.09 = 1.111...

So total is 20 + 1.111 = 21.111. So $21.11.

Looking at the options, option J is 21.00, which is the closest. But wait, wait a second. Are there any rounding rules or do they expect a whole number? The options might be rounded to two decimal places. So 21.11 would round to 21.11, but none of the options have that. Wait, looking again at the options:

Options are A:19.00, B:20.35, C:25.40, D:23.50, E:24.75, F:26.22, G:22.11, H:17.78, I:18.50, J:21.00.

Wait, J is 21.00, which is $21.00. So the calculated value is approximately $21.11, which is closer to 21.00 than 21.00 isn't exact. So perhaps the correct answer is J. But wait, I thought the calculation was exactly 21.11.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects rounding to the nearest whole number, so 21.11 would round to 21.00. Or maybe the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try that again. 1.90 divided by 0.09.

So 0.09 into 1.90.

Wait, 0.09 * 20 is 1.80. Then, 1.90 - 1.80 = 0.10. So 0.10 divided by 0.09 is 1.111. So total is 21.111.

Hmm, so that's approximately $21.11. So among the options, J is 21.00, which is the closest. So the correct answer is J.

To determine the intrinsic value of a preferred share, we use the formula for the present value of a perpetuity, which is:

\[ \text{Intrinsic Value} = \frac{\text{Dividend per year}}{\text{Required rate of return}} \]

Given:
- Dividend per year = $1.90
- Required rate of return = 9% (or 0.09 in decimal form)

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Intrinsic Value} = \frac{1.90}{0.09} \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1.90 \div 0.09 = 21.11 \]

Thus, the intrinsic value is approximately $21.11. Among the provided options, the closest value is **21.00** (Option J).

Answer: J: 21.00
