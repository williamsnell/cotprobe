Question:

A college student and her boyfriend lived together in a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, "not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to property law, so I might make some mistakes along the way, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

So, the scenario is about a couple who got married and bought a property together. The key points are about their ownership and the subsequent deed that the boyfriend tried to sell the property to his co-worker.

First, the deed they recorded: it's a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. That means both the student and the boyfriend are joint tenants, and if one of them dies, the other continues to own the property until they both die. So, they're not tenants in common because that would require each owning a separate interest. But in this case, it's a joint tenancy, so both have equal rights.

Now, the boyfriend tried to sell the property to his co-worker. He did this without knowing the student, so it's a fraudulent deed. He forged the student's name on the deed. He then gave the deed to the co-worker, who paid $150,000, which was the fair market value. Since the property's value was the same as the market, the sale was at fair value. 

Wait a second, in a joint tenancy, the grantee (in this case, the co-worker) would take the entire property if it's a fee simple conveyance. But here, the deed was a joint tenancy, not a fee simple. So, the co-worker, as a joint tenant, would take the property in exchange for consideration. However, because the deed was recorded, the co-worker would have a right of survivorship, meaning the co-worker and the student would both own the property until one or both die.

But wait, the question says that the deed was recorded in the common law joint tenancy. So, the right of survivorship applies. The co-worker, as a joint tenant, would take the property when conveyed. But the co-worker didn't actually take the property yet. Wait, no, the co-worker received the deed, which involves ownership. 

Wait, no, the deed was executed by the boyfriend, who took the deed and forged the student's name. Then, he gave it to the co-worker, who paid the amount. So, the co-worker is a joint tenant with the right of survivorship. But the co-worker didn't take the property yet; he was just given the deed. So, upon delivery, the co-worker's ownership would take effect. But hold on, in a joint tenancy, if a joint tenant dies, the other joint tenant continues. But in this case, the co-worker didn't take the property yet. Wait, no, he did receive the deed, so the property is now owned by him as a joint tenant.

But wait, the initial deed was recorded as a joint tenancy. So, the co-worker, as a joint tenant, would take the property when the deed is delivered. But in this case, the co-worker received the deed, but didn't actually receive the property. Wait, no, the co-worker paid the $150,000, which was the fair market value. So, that's the price the co-worker paid for the property. Therefore, the co-worker took the property as a joint tenancy owner, with the right of survivorship.

But wait, that can't be right. Because the initial deed was recorded as a joint tenancy, so the student and the boyfriend are joint tenants. The co-worker received the deed, but didn't own it yet. So, when he received the deed, the property was still in the hands of the joint tenants (student and boyfriend) because the deed was recorded as a joint tenancy. So, the co-worker's ownership comes from the deed. That means the co-worker now owns the property, and the student and boyfriend are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Because the right of survivorship takes effect when the deed is delivered, which is when the co-worker receives it.

Wait, but in this case, the co-worker didn't own it. Because the student and boyfriend are joint tenants. So, the student and boyfriend are joint tenants, but the co-worker didn't take the property yet. So, when the co-worker received the deed, the property was still owned by the joint tenants (student and boyfriend) as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Because the right of survivorship applies to the tenant who receives the deed. So, the co-worker, upon receiving the deed, becomes a new owner with the right of survivorship.

So, who owns the property now? The co-worker, as the one who received the deed, and the student and boyfriend remain joint tenants with the right of survivorship. So, all three (co-worker, student, boyfriend) are joint tenants.

But wait, no, the question says the boyfriend tried to sell the property to his co-worker, and the co-worker took the deed but didn't own the property yet. So, the right of survivorship applies. So, the co-worker is a new owner, with the student and boyfriend as joint tenants. So, all three would have joint tenancy with the right of survivorship.

Looking at the options, option E is "the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship," and option I is "the boy and the student as tenants in common." But the initial deed was a joint tenancy. So, the correct answer should be the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with survivorship, but wait, no, the student was a joint tenant, but the co-worker is also a joint tenant.

Wait, let's re-examine. The initial deed was a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. So, the student and the boyfriend are joint tenants. The co-worker received the deed, which is recorded as a joint tenancy. So, upon delivery of the deed, the property is now owned by the co-worker because he's the one who received the deed, and the right of survivorship applies. So, the co-worker, along with the student and boyfriend, are all joint tenants with right of survivorship. But wait, in the common law, the right of survivorship would apply when the property is conveyed. So, in this case, the co-worker received the deed, so he becomes a new owner, and the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants.

Wait, but the initial deed had the right of survivorship for the student and the boyfriend. So, when the co-worker gets the deed, he's a new owner, but the right of survivorship applies to the student and the boyfriend. So, the property would now belong to the co-worker, but the student and boyfriend are still joint tenants because they were in a joint tenancy. So, all three are joint tenants with the right of survivorship.

Wait, but the initial deed was recorded as a joint tenancy. So, the student and the boyfriend are joint tenants. The right of survivorship applies to the joint tenant who receives the deed. So, the co-worker, upon receiving the deed, is the one who takes the property, and the right of survivorship applies to the student and boyfriend. So, now, the co-worker is the sole owner, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants.

So, the new owner is the co-worker, and the student and boyfriend are joint tenants with survivorship.

Wait, that can't be. The initial joint tenancy is between student and boyfriend. The co-worker gets the deed. So, as a joint tenant, he is now a new owner with the right of survivorship. So, among all three, the co-worker is the sole owner, but the student and boyfriend are still joint tenants with survivorship. So, the correct answer is E: the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship. No, wait, the student was already a joint tenant. So, the correct answer is E, but the student was already a joint tenant. Wait, the question is about the current ownership. So, the student and the boyfriend are joint tenants, and the co-worker is also a joint tenant with survivorship.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship doesn't come into play until the property is transferred. So, if the co-worker received the deed, then the right of survivorship would apply to the student and boyfriend. So, the co-worker takes the property, and the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants.

So, the correct answer is the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, option E. Wait, no, because the right of survivorship applies to them, but the co-worker is also a joint tenant.

Wait, the current ownership is that the co-worker is the owner (as he took the deed), and the student and boyfriend are joint tenants. So, all three are joint tenants with the right of survivorship.

Looking at the options:

A: student and boyfriend as joint tenancy with survivorship. But that ignores the co-worker.

B: co-worker as fee simple, which isn't the case here.

C: boyfriend and student as joint tenancy. Then the co-worker is fee simple. But the initial deed was a joint tenancy, so that's not correct.

D: co-worker and boyfriend as tenants in common. No, because the initial deed was a joint tenancy, not tenants in common.

E: co-worker and student as joint tenants with survivorship. No, because survivorship applies to the student and boyfriend, not to the co-worker.

Wait, no, survivorship applies when the property is transferred. So, the co-worker, as the one who received the deed, becomes a new owner, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants. So, all three are joint tenants with survivorship.

Hence, the correct option is E: the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship. No, because the student was already a joint tenant. So, the co-worker is a new owner, but the student and boyfriend remain joint tenants. So, the correct option is E, but that would be co-worker and student. But the student was already a joint tenant. So, the correct statement would be that all three are joint tenants with right of survivorship.

Looking again at the options, let's see:

E: the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

No, because the right of survivorship applies to the student and the boyfriend, not to the co-worker. So, the correct answer must include the co-worker as a joint tenant with survivorship, but since the student and boyfriend are already joint tenants, the answer would be E, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship applies to the student and the boyfriend, so the co-worker is the new owner, but the student and boyfriend are joint tenants. So, the co-worker is a separate owner, but the student and boyfriend are still joint tenants. So, in that case, the co-worker is the sole owner, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants.

But the options don't have a choice that reflects that. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: joint tenancy between student and boyfriend.

B: co-worker as fee simple.

C: boyfriend and student as joint tenancy.

D: co-worker and boyfriend as tenants in common.

E: co-worker and student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

F: co-worker and boyfriend as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

Wait, none of the options explicitly say all three are joint tenants. But the correct ownership is that the co-worker is the sole owner, but the student and boyfriend remain joint tenants. But in the options, the only one that includes the co-worker and the student as joint tenants is E, but that's incorrect because the student is a joint tenant, and the co-worker is the survivor. Alternatively, the correct answer might be that the co-worker is the sole owner, but the student and boyfriend are joint tenants, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The deed recorded is a joint tenancy. So, the student and boyfriend are joint tenants. The co-worker, who took the deed, is a new owner, but the right of survivorship applies to the student and boyfriend. So, the co-worker is the one who now owns, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants. So, all three have joint tenancy with survivorship.

Looking at the options, none of them have all three as joint tenants. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the right of survivorship doesn't create a new right of survivorship for the co-worker, but only for the student and boyfriend. So, the co-worker is a new owner, but the student and boyfriend are still joint tenants.

So, in the options, the correct answer would be E: the co-worker and the student as joint tenants. But that's not accurate because the right of survivorship applies to the student and boyfriend, not to the co-worker. So, the correct answer should be E, but the wording would require that E is correct, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship doesn't affect the co-worker's ownership status. So, the co-worker is a joint tenant with the right of survivorship continuing. So, the co-worker, as a joint tenant, would have the right of survivorship. So, the co-worker is the sole owner, and the student and boyfriend are joint tenants with survivorship. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

E: the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

That's not correct because the student was already a joint tenant. So, the correct answer is that the co-worker is a new owner, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants.

But the options don't have an option that states that. So, maybe the correct answer is E, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the co-worker is the sole owner, but since the initial tenancy was joint, perhaps the right of survivorship only applies to the student and boyfriend, and the co-worker is a separate owner.

Wait, no. The right of survivorship applies in a joint tenancy to the surviving party. So, if the co-worker receives the deed, he becomes the one who takes the property in exchange for consideration, but the right of survivorship still applies to the student and boyfriend, meaning they both continue to own the property until they die. So, the co-worker is a new owner, but the student and boyfriend remain joint tenants.

So, the correct answer would be that the co-worker and the student are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Because the student was already a joint tenant, and the co-worker is another joint tenant. But in the options, option E says "the co-worker and the student as joint tenants," which would not be correct because the survivorship still applies to the student and boyfriend. So, perhaps the correct option is E, but that's not accurate because the survivorship applies to the student and boyfriend, not to the co-worker.

Wait, perhaps the survivorship applies only to the student and boyfriend. So, the co-worker is a separate owner, and the student and boyfriend are still joint tenants. But the options don't have an option reflecting that. So, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the deed was a fee simple, but the question says it's a joint tenancy. So, the right of survivorship applies.

Looking again, the options:

Option E: co-worker and student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

But the right of survivorship would only apply to the student and boyfriend. So, the co-worker is a new owner, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants. So, the correct answer would be E, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, the right of survivorship is a right to continue ownership upon death. So, the student and boyfriend would have the right of survivorship. The co-worker, upon receiving the deed, would take the property in exchange for consideration, but he wouldn't have the right of survivorship. So, the co-worker is a new owner, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants.

So, the correct answer is that the co-worker is the sole owner, but the student and boyfriend remain as joint tenants. However, the options don't have that. So, perhaps the answer is E, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think: when a joint tenancy deed is recorded, the grantee (student) and the grantor (boyfriend) are joint tenants. The right of survivorship applies to the grantee, but the grantor remains a joint tenant. So, if the grantor (boyfriend) dies, the grantee (student) continues. In this case, the co-worker is a joint tenant but not a grantee. The co-worker received the deed, so he's now a new owner. So, the right of survivorship applies only to the student and boyfriend, not to the co-worker. Therefore, the co-worker isn't a joint tenant with survivorship. So, the correct answer is that the co-worker is a new owner, and the student and boyfriend are joint tenants. But the options don't have an option that reflects that.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the right of survivorship doesn't apply to the co-worker. So, the correct answer is that the co-worker is the sole owner, but the student and boyfriend are joint tenants. However, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the right of survivorship applies to all parties who have contributed to the joint tenancy. So, the student was a member; the boy was a member; the co-worker received the deed but didn't own it. The co-worker is a joint tenant with the right of survivorship. So, in that case, the co-worker's ownership would take effect, making them a joint tenant with the right of survivorship, along with the student and boyfriend. But the initial deed was a joint tenancy, so the student and boyfriend are already joint tenants. So, the correct answer would be E: co-worker and student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

Because the co-worker, upon receiving the deed, becomes a new joint tenant with the right of survivorship. So, the student and boy remain as joint tenants, and the co-worker is also a joint tenant with the right of survivorship. So, the answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship**.

### Breakdown:
1. **Initial Deed**: The deed recorded is a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. This means the student and boyfriend are joint tenants, and if one dies, the other continues to own the property.

2. **Co-worker's Role**: The co-worker received the deed and took it for consideration. Upon delivery, the property was transferred to the co-worker, who now owns it with the right of survivorship.

3. **Student's Role**: The student, who was part of the initial joint tenancy, remains a joint tenant with the right of survivorship.

4. **Co-worker's Ownership**: The co-worker, who received the deed, now owns the property with the right of survivorship. Thus, the co-worker, student, and boyfriend are all joint tenants with the right of survivorship.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **A, B, C, D, F, G**: These options either ignore the co-worker's ownership or incorrectly imply survivorship only for the student and boyfriend.
   - **E**: Correctly states that the co-worker and student are joint tenants with the right of survivorship, making the co-worker the sole owner of the property.

ANSWER: E
