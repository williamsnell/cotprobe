Okay, so I've got this question about polar coordinates and vertical tangents. Hmm, the equation is r = sin 3θ. I need to find where in the first quadrant the tangent is vertical. Wait, but wait—the question is about the first quadrant, right? So θ must be between 0 and π/2, but wait, no. Wait, polar coordinates typically have θ from 0 to 2π, but the first quadrant in polar terms is where x and y are both positive. So in Cartesian terms, that's θ between 0 and π/2. Wait, no, wait—actually, the first quadrant in polar is where x is positive and y is positive. So that's when θ is between 0 and π/2, because in that range, both x (r cosθ) and y (r sinθ) are positive. So the question is about θ in the range where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.

The question is when the tangent is vertical. I remember that in polar coordinates, the slope of the tangent line is given by (dy/dx). But since we're dealing with r as a function of θ, I think the formula for the derivative in polar coordinates is dy/dx = (dr/dθ sinθ + r cosθ) / (dr/dθ cosθ - r sinθ). Wait, or was it the other way around? Let me think. Oh, right, the formula is:

dy/dx = [ (dr/dθ) * cosθ - r * sinθ ] / [ (dr/dθ) * sinθ + r * cosθ ]

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, another approach is to use the parametrization in Cartesian coordinates. Since x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So, to find the slope, dy/dx, we can use the chain rule:

dy/dx = (dy/dθ) / (dx/dθ)

Which would be [ (dr/dθ sinθ + r cosθ) ] / [ (dr/dθ cosθ - r sinθ) ]

Wait, that's the same as the formula I wrote earlier. So for a vertical tangent, dy/dx is infinite, which means the denominator is zero. So set the denominator to zero:

(dr/dθ cosθ - r sinθ) = 0

So let's compute dr/dθ for r = sin 3θ. dr/dθ = 3 cos 3θ.

So the denominator is:

3 cos 3θ * cosθ - sin 3θ * sinθ = 0

I need to solve this equation for θ in [0, π/2].

So, 3 cos 3θ cosθ - sin 3θ sinθ = 0.

Hmm, can I simplify this expression? Maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me think about the product terms.

Wait, I remember that cos A cos B can be expressed using a sum formula, and similarly for sin A sin B.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor something out. Let's write it as:

3 cos(3θ) cosθ - sin(3θ) sinθ = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can express this as a single cosine function. Let me think about using the identity for cos(A + B):

cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B.

Wait, that's similar to the expression here. So:

3 cos(3θ) cosθ - sin(3θ) sinθ = cos(3θ + θ) multiplied by something?

Wait, no, because the coefficients are 3 and 1. So perhaps factoring out a 3:

Wait, 3 cos(3θ) cosθ - sin(3θ) sinθ = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor it as cos(3θ + θ) = cos(4θ), but then it's multiplied by 3. Let's see:

Wait, cos(4θ) = cos(3θ + θ) = cos 3θ cos θ - sin 3θ sin θ.

But in our expression, it's 3 cos 3θ cosθ - sin 3θ sinθ, which would be 3 cos(4θ) + (something else?) No, because 3 cos(3θ) cosθ is 3 times the product. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, let me think about 3 cos(3θ) cosθ. That's 3 multiplied by cos(3θ) cosθ. The standard identity is cos(A)cos(B) = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2. So 3 cos(3θ) cosθ = 3 [ cos(4θ) + cos(2θ) ] / 2. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the whole equation as:

3 cos3θ cosθ = sin3θ sinθ

So, 3 cos3θ cosθ = sin3θ sinθ

Let me divide both sides by cosθ cos3θ, assuming neither is zero. So:

3 = (sin3θ / cos3θ) * (sinθ / cosθ)

Which is 3 = tan3θ tanθ

So, tan3θ * tanθ = 3.

Hmm. Now, tan3θ can be expanded using the identity for tan(3θ). Let me recall that tan3θ = (3 tanθ - tan³θ) / (1 - 3 tan²θ).

So, substituting:

[ (3 tanθ - tan³θ) / (1 - 3 tan²θ) ] * tanθ = 3

Multiply both sides by (1 - 3 tan²θ):

(3 tanθ - tan³θ) * tanθ = 3 (1 - 3 tan²θ)

Expand the left side: 3 tan²θ - tan^4θ.

Right side: 3 - 9 tan²θ.

Bring all terms to one side:

3 tan²θ - tan^4θ - 3 + 9 tan²θ = 0

Combine like terms:

(3 + 9) tan²θ - tan^4θ - 3 = 0

12 tan²θ - tan^4θ - 3 = 0

Let me rearrange:

tan^4θ -12 tan²θ +3=0

Let me set u = tan²θ. Then equation becomes:

u² -12 u +3 = 0

Quadratic equation: u² -12u +3=0

Solve for u:

u = [12 ± sqrt(144 -12)] / 2 = [12 ± sqrt(132)] / 2

Simplify sqrt(132): sqrt(4*33) = 2 sqrt(33). So,

u = [12 ± 2 sqrt(33)] /2 = 6 ± sqrt(33)

So two solutions: u1 =6 + sqrt(33), u2=6 - sqrt(33)

But u = tan²θ, so u must be positive. Let's check 6 + sqrt(33) is definitely positive, and 6 - sqrt(33) is about 6-5.744=0.256, which is positive.

So tan²θ =6 + sqrt(33) → tanθ = sqrt(6+sqrt(33)) → but that's a large value, about sqrt(6+5.744)=sqrt(11.744)=~3.427, which would make θ around 73 degrees, which is way beyond π/2 (1.57 radians, which is 90 degrees). So that solution is not valid because θ must be between 0 and π/2.

The other solution is tan²θ=6 - sqrt(33) → tanθ= sqrt(6 - sqrt(33)) → sqrt(6 -5.744)=sqrt(0.256)=0.506. So tanθ ≈0.506 → θ≈ arctan(0.506). Let me calculate that.

Arctan(0.506): I know that tan(26.6 degrees) is about 0.5 (since tan(26) is about 0.488, tan(27)= ~0.5095). So 0.506 is about 26.6 degrees, which is approximately 0.466 radians (since π is about 3.1416, so 180 degrees is π, so 26.6 degrees is roughly 0.466 radians).

Wait, but the options given are in terms of multiples of 0.1, like 0.30, 0.47, etc. So 0.466 is closer to 0.47.

So the solution is θ ≈0.47 radians, which is option F.

Alternatively, I should double-check.

Wait, let's compute θ where tanθ ≈0.506. So θ ≈ arctan(0.506)≈ 26.6 degrees, which is about 0.466 radians, which is approximately 0.47 as in option F.

Alternatively, let me compute using more precise calculation.

Wait, 0.506 is roughly 0.506. Let me find arctan(0.506).

Using a calculator: arctan(0.5) is about 26.565 degrees, and 0.506 is a bit more. Let me compute 0.506 - 0.5=0.006. The derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1+x²). So the change in angle for a small x would be approximately delta_x / (1 + x²). So delta_x=0.006. So delta_theta ≈ 0.006 / (1 + (0.5)^2) =0.006 / (1.25)=0.0048 radians. So 26.565 + 0.0048=26.57 degrees, which is approximately 0.463 radians. Rounded to two decimal places, 0.46, but perhaps the options have 0.47 as option F.

So the correct θ is near 0.466, which is approximately 0.47 as in option F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option F is 0.47, G is 0.60, H is 0.25, etc.

So the vertical tangent occurs at θ ≈0.47, which is option F.

To determine where the rose \( r = \sin 3\theta \) has a vertical tangent in the first quadrant (\( 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2 \)), we analyze the condition for a vertical tangent. A vertical tangent occurs when the denominator of the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is zero, which corresponds to the equation:

\[
3 \cos 3\theta \cos \theta - \sin 3\theta \sin \theta = 0
\]

Simplifying using trigonometric identities and solving for \( \theta \), we find that the valid solution in the first quadrant is approximately \( \theta \approx 0.47 \) radians. This matches option F.
