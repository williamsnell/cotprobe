Okay, so I've got this problem about markup percentages. Let me see... The question says the markup on a camera is 20% based on the cost. I need to find the percent markup based on the selling price. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what markup means. Markup can refer to the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. But there are different ways to calculate it, like based on cost or based on selling price. The question specifies that the markup is 20% based on cost, so I think that means that the markup is 20% of the cost. 

Let me denote the cost as C. So, the markup would be 0.20 * C. Then, the selling price (S) would be the cost plus the markup, right? So S = C + 0.20C. That simplifies to S = 1.20C. So, the selling price is 120% of the cost.

But the question is asking for the markup percentage based on the selling price. So, I need to find what percentage the markup is of the selling price. The markup is 0.20C, and the selling price is 1.20C. So, the markup as a percentage of the selling price would be (0.20C / 1.20C) * 100%.

Wait, the C cancels out, so it's (0.20 / 1.20) * 100%. Let me calculate that. 0.2 divided by 1.2 is the same as 2/12, which simplifies to 1/6. 1 divided by 6 is approximately 0.166666..., which is 16.666... percent. So, 16 and two-thirds percent.

Looking at the options, option B is 16(2/3)%, so that should be the answer.

The markup based on cost is 20%, so the selling price is 1.20 times the cost. To find the markup as a percentage of the selling price, we calculate (0.20 / 1.20) * 100% = 16(2/3)%.

Answer: B: 16(2/3)%
