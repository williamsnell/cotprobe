Okay, so I've got this question here about Mr. Williams and his savings account. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that Mr. Williams has $20 deducted from his paycheck every month and deposited into his savings account. The savings account is earning interest at 5 3/4 percent. The question is asking how much these monthly deposits will add to his account in 3 months. The options are from A to J, each with different amounts.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The $20 is taken out every month, but it's deposited into the savings account. So, each month, the deposit is $20. But since the account earns interest, this money isn't just sitting there—it earns some returns over time.

Wait, the question is about how much the monthly deposits add to the account in 3 months. Hmm. So, each month, the $20 is deposited, but it also earns interest. So, over three months, the total would be the sum of the $20 each month plus any interest earned on that.

But wait, let me read the question again. It says, "how much will these monthly deposits add to his account in 3 months?" So, I think that's the total interest earned plus the $20 from each month. Or maybe just the interest, because the $20 is part of the deposit each month. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, no, each month, he deposits $20, and the account earns interest on that deposit each month. So, the total amount in the account after 3 months would be the sum of $20 each month plus the interest earned each month over the three months.

Wait, but the question is how much the monthly deposits add to his account in 3 months. Hmm. So, perhaps the question is asking for the total interest earned over those 3 months. Because each deposit earns interest, but the problem says "how much will these monthly deposits add to his account in 3 months"—so maybe the interest. Or maybe it's the total of all three deposits, including interest. I'm a bit confused.

Wait another approach: Each month, he adds $20 to the account, and the account earns interest on that $20 each month. So, in month 1, he deposits $20, which earns interest for that month. Then in month 2, another $20 is deposited, and it earns interest for month 2. Same for month 3. So, the total interest earned over 3 months would be the sum of interest from each of the three deposits.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total amount deposited, which is 3 times $20, but that's $60. But the options don't have $60 as an option (they do have $60.56, which is D. So that's not it.)

Wait, but I think the question is about the interest earned on the $20 each month. Because the question is asking how much the monthly deposits add to his account in 3 months. So, perhaps it's the interest earned over 3 months.

Wait, but the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read. The question states: "how much will these monthly deposits add to his account in 3 months?" So, each deposit is $20, and each deposit earns interest. So over 3 months, the total interest is the sum of each month's interest.

But the way to calculate interest is to know the principal, rate, and time. The formula is I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time in years.

Wait, the rate is 5 3/4 percent, which is 5.75%. So, 0.0575 in decimal.

Each month, the principal is $20, and the rate is 5.75% per month? Or per year? Wait, no. The rate is probably annual, but since the deposits are monthly, perhaps each deposit earns interest per month. Alternatively, the rate is 5.75% per annum, so compounded monthly.

Wait, but this might be getting too complicated. Let me think again. Maybe the question is simply asking for the total interest earned on the $20 each month, summed over 3 months.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total of the three deposits plus interest. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says, "how much will these monthly deposits add to his account in 3 months?" So, it's asking about the interest earned on the $20 each month, summed over 3 months. Because the $20 is being deposited each month, and each deposit earns interest. So, the total interest would be the sum of interest from each of the three deposits.

But wait, alternatively, the question might be asking for the total amount in the account after 3 months, including the interest. Because each deposit earns interest, so the total would be the sum of the deposits plus the interest.

So, the initial approach could be: each month, the $20 is deposited, and each earns interest. So, after 3 months, the total in the account is 3 * $20 plus interest earned on each of those deposits.

But to calculate that, I need to know how much interest each $20 earns each month. Since the rate is 5.75% annually, but how is it applied? Is it monthly compounding, or is it simple interest?

Ah, wait, the question doesn't specify compounding, so perhaps it's using simple interest each month. So, for each $20 deposit, the interest would be 5.75% per month.

So, the interest per month for each $20 is $20 * (5.75/100) = $20 * 0.0575 = $1.15.

So, each $20 deposit earns $1.15 in interest each month.

In 3 months, each deposit would have earned 3 * $1.15 = $3.45 in interest.

Since there are 3 deposits, the total interest earned would be 3 * $3.45 = $10.35.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include that. Let me check the math again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recalculate.

Each month, the $20 is deposited. The interest rate is 5.75% per year, which is 5.75/12 ≈ 0.479% per month. So, the monthly interest rate is approximately 0.479%.

So, each $20 deposit earns 0.479% of $20 per month. Let's calculate that:

0.479% of $20 is 0.00479 * 20 = $0.0958, which is about $0.096, or $0.10.

Wait, but if that's simple interest, each deposit earns $0.10 per month. So over 3 months, each deposit would earn 3 * $0.10 = $0.30. Three deposits would earn 3 * $0.30 = $0.90.

So the total interest after three months would be $0.90. But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are all around $5 to $60. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total interest earned on the entire amount deposited over three months. So, the total deposits are 3 * $20 = $60. The interest on $60 at 5.75% annual rate for three months.

Wait, but 5.75% per year, so per month it's 5.75/12 ≈ 0.479%. So over three months, the interest rate is 3 * 0.479% ≈ 1.437%.

So, interest is $60 * (1.437%) = $60 * 0.01437 ≈ $0.862.

But that's not matching any of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is compounded monthly. So, let's try that approach.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^n, but since the rate is annual, perhaps the compounding is monthly. Wait no, the rate is annual, but the interest is monthly.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate simple interest for each deposit.

Each $20 deposit earns 5.75% annually, but how much per month? 5.75% per year is 5.75/12 ≈ 0.4792% per month.

So, each $20 deposit earns 0.4792% per month, so the monthly interest is 0.004792 * 20 = $0.09584 per month.

So, each $20 deposit earns about $0.096 per month. Over three months, each deposit earns 3 * $0.096 ≈ $0.288. So, three deposits would earn 3 * $0.288 ≈ $0.864.

But again, the options don't have this amount. The closest is option B, $59.50, which is much higher. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the interest per month but about the total interest earned on all deposits over three months.

Wait, each deposit is $20. So, total deposits over three months are 3 * $20 = $60. The interest rate is 5.75% per annum. So, the interest on $60 over three months would be (5.75% per year) * (3/12 year) = 5.75% * 0.25 = 1.4375% of $60.

So, 1.4375% of $60 is 0.014375 * 60 = $0.8625. So, total interest is approximately $0.86. But again, the options don't have this. The closest is option B: $59.50, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is about how much the monthly deposits add to the account, including interest. So, the initial deposits are $20 each month. But each month, the $20 is deposited and earns interest. So, after three months, the total in the account would be the sum of all three deposits plus the interest earned on each.

But let's approach it step by step.

Month 1:

- Deposit $20. Now, it's in the account. Let's say it earns interest for the first month.

So, at the end of month 1, the account has $20 plus interest.

But without knowing the compounding method, it's a bit tricky. Let me assume simple interest for each deposit. So, each $20 earns 5.75% per year, which is 5.75/12 ≈ 0.4792% per month.

So, each $20 deposit earns 0.4792% * 1 month = 0.004792 dollars.

So, after three months, each deposit would have earned 3 * 0.004792 ≈ $0.01438.

So, each deposit would have 0.01438 in interest. So, three deposits would have 3 * 0.01438 ≈ $0.04314 in interest.

Thus, the total amount in the account after three months would be 3*$20 + $0.04314 = $60 + $0.04314 ≈ $60.04314. So, approximately $60.04.

Looking at the options, option F is $60, which is the closest. But wait, the options don't have $60.04. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is about the total interest earned on the amount deposited over 3 months. So, each $20 is deposited, and each earns interest for 3 months. So, the interest per $20 is 5.75% per annum * (3/12) = 5.75% * 0.25 = 1.4375% per $20.

So, interest per $20 is 1.4375% of $20 = $0.2875. For three $20s, it's 3 * $0.2875 = $0.8625. So, total interest would be $0.8625, so total amount in the account would be $60 + $0.8625 ≈ $60.86. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the time value of money, and each deposit is treated as a separate investment. So, each $20 is deposited at the start of each month and earns interest for the remaining months. So, the first $20 earns interest for 2 months, the second for 1 month, and the third for 0 months (since it's deposited at the end of the third month and hasn't earned any interest yet).

Let me calculate that.

First deposit (month 1):
- $20 deposited at the start of month 1.
- It earns interest for 2 months (end of month 2 and end of month 3).
- So, the interest for the first deposit: 5.75% per annum is 5.75/12 ≈ 0.4792% per month.
- Over 2 months, it's 0.4792 * 2 = 0.9584%.
- So, interest: 0.9584% * $20 = $0.01917.

Second deposit (month 2):
- $20 deposited at the start of month 2.
- It earns interest for 1 month (end of month 3).
- Interest: 0.4792% * 1 = 0.4792%.
- Interest: 0.004792 * $20 = $0.09584.

Third deposit (month 3):
- $20 deposited at the start of month 3.
- It hasn't earned any interest yet (it's deposited at the start and hasn't been in the account for a month).
- So, interest: $0.

Total interest earned: $0.01917 + $0.09584 + $0 = $0.11501.

So, the total amount in the account after three months would be 3*$20 + $0.11501 = $60 + $0.11501 ≈ $60.12.

Wait, but the options don't have $60.12. The closest is option F ($60). So, perhaps the question is only considering the interest earned on the initial deposit, not compounded, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the interest earned on the $20 each month, summed over three months, and the correct approach is to calculate the interest on each deposit for each month.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

The correct way to calculate interest on a recurring deposit is to use the formula for compound interest, but perhaps the question is using simple interest. Let's try that.

Each month, the $20 is deposited, and each earns interest for the number of months left in the 3-month period.

For the first deposit (month 1), it earns interest for 2 months.

Interest = 20 * (5.75% / 12) * 2.

So, 5.75% is 0.0575, divided by 12 is about 0.0047916667.

So, 20 * 0.0047916667 * 2 = 20 * 0.0095833334 ≈ $0.191666668.

Second deposit (month 2) earns interest for 1 month:

20 * 0.0047916667 * 1 = $0.095833334.

Third deposit (month 3) earns no interest.

Total interest = 0.191666668 + 0.095833334 ≈ $0.2875.

So, total amount is 3*20 + 0.2875 = $60 + 0.2875 = $60.2875 ≈ $60.29.

Looking at the options, option E is $60.25, which is close but not exactly this. Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me do the calculations more precisely.

5.75% is 0.0575. Divided by 12 months: 0.0575 / 12 = 0.004791666667.

First deposit (month 1) interest: 20 * (0.004791666667) * 2 = 20 * 0.00958333333 = 0.1916666666.

Second deposit (month 2) interest: 20 * 0.00479166667 * 1 = 0.0958333333.

Third deposit (month 3) interest: 0.

Total interest: 0.1916666666 + 0.0958333333 = 0.2875.

So, total amount is 60 + 0.2875 = 60.2875.

The options are:

A:6.25

B:5.95

C:6.125

D:60.76

E:60.25

F:60

So, 60.2875 is closest to 60.25, which is option E. But wait, I'm getting 60.2875, which is 60.29 when rounded to two decimal places.

But the options don't have 60.29. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, 60.25, assuming that the interest is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is calculating the interest on each deposit without considering the compounding. So, each $20 is deposited, and the first earns interest for two months, the second for one month, and the third for none.

So, first deposit: 20 * 0.0575 * (2/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * (1/6) = 20 * 0.009583333 = 0.19166666.

Second deposit: 20 * 0.0575 * (1/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * 0.0833333 ≈ 20 * 0.000479166667 ≈ 0.00958333.

Third deposit: 0.

Total interest: 0.19166666 + 0.00958333 ≈ 0.20125.

Total amount: 60 + 0.20125 ≈ 60.20125.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 60.25, which is 0.04875 higher. So, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the question is simply asking for the total amount after three months, without considering the interest, which would be $60, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the question is incorrectly worded.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total interest earned, which is $0.2875, but that's not among the options either.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the interest for each deposit.

Let me try to calculate it more accurately.

First deposit: $20.

Interest for month 1: 20 * (5.75/12) * (1/12) = 20 * (0.0575) * (1/12) = 20 * 0.0004791666667 ≈ 0.00958333333.

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct way is to compute the interest for each month. So, for the first deposit, after month 1, it has earned 5.75% * (1/12) = 0.4791666667%.

So, 20 * 0.004791666667 ≈ $0.0958333334.

After month 2: 20 * 0.004791666667 * 1 = 0.0958333334.

After month 3: 20 * 0.004791666667 * 1 = 0.0958333334.

So, for the first deposit, the interest earned over three months is 3 * 0.0958333334 ≈ $0.2875.

For the second deposit, which is deposited at the start of month 2, it has earned interest for one month.

So, interest for month 2: 20 * 0.004791666667 ≈ $0.0958333334.

For the third deposit, deposited at the start of month 3, it hasn't earned any interest yet, so its interest is $0.

So, total interest earned on the three deposits is 0.2875 + 0.0958333334 ≈ $0.3833333334.

Adding that to the initial $60, the total amount after three months would be $60.3833333334, which is approximately $60.38.

But the options are:

A:6.25

B:5.95

C:6.125

D:60.76

E:60.25

F:60

So, the closest is option E: 60.25, which is about 0.13 less than our calculated 60.38.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the interest for the first deposit. Let me double-check.

First deposit: $20.

After month 1: 20 * (5.75/12) * (1/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * (1/12) ≈ 20 * 0.0004791666667 ≈ $0.00958333333.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct way is to calculate the interest each month.

So, each month, the $20 is deposited, and it earns interest for the number of months remaining.

So, for the first deposit:

- Month 1: earns interest for 2 months.

So, 20 * (5.75/12) * 2 = 20 * 0.0575 * 2 = 20 * 0.115 = $2.30.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 5.75% per annum is 5.75/12 ≈ 0.47916667% per month.

So, 20 * 0.47916667% * 2 = 20 * 0.0047916667 * 2 ≈ 20 * 0.0095833334 ≈ $0.191666668.

So, after month 1, first deposit has $20 + $0.191666668 ≈ $20.191666668.

In month 2, the first deposit's interest is calculated based on the remaining months.

So, after month 2, first deposit's interest is (5.75/12) * 1 = 0.0047916667.

So, 20.191666668 * 0.0047916667 ≈ 20.191666668 * 0.0047916667 ≈ $0.0965833333.

So, after month 2, first deposit's balance is 20.191666668 + 0.0965833333 ≈ $20.288250001.

In month 3, the first deposit's interest is (5.75/12) * 0 = 0.

So, after month 3, first deposit's balance is $20.288250001.

Similarly, the second deposit is deposited at the start of month 2, so it earns interest for 1 month and 0 days.

So, in month 2, it earns interest for 1 month: 20 * (5.75/12) * 1 = $0.958333333.

In month 3, it earns no interest.

So, after month 3, the second deposit's balance is $20 + $0.958333333 ≈ $20.958333333.

The third deposit is deposited at the start of month 3 and earns no interest over the three months.

So, after month 3, the third deposit's balance is $20.

Now, the total amount in the account after three months is:

First deposit: $20.288250001

Second deposit: $20.958333333

Third deposit: $20

Total: 20.288250001 + 20.958333333 + 20 = (20.28825 + 20.95833) + 20 ≈ (41.24658) + 20 ≈ $61.24658.

Wait, that's about $61.25, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as each $20 deposited in the first, second, and third months earns interest for the remaining months.

So, for the first $20 deposited in month 1, it earns interest for 2 months:

20 * (5.75/12) * 2 = 20 * (0.0575) * 2 = 20 * 0.115 = $2.30.

So, after two months, the first deposit has 20 + $2.30 = $22.30.

Then, in month 2, it earns interest for 1 month:

22.30 * (5.75/12) * 1 ≈ 22.30 * 0.0575 ≈ $1.28225.

So, after month 3, the first deposit's balance is 22.30 + $1.28225 ≈ $23.58225.

Similarly, the second $20 deposited in month 2 earns interest for 1 month:

20 * (5.75/12) * 1 ≈ 20 * 0.047916667 ≈ $0.95833334.

So, after month 3, the second deposit's balance is 20 + $0.95833334 ≈ $20.95833334.

The third $20 deposited in month 3 earns no interest.

So, adding all three:

$23.58225 + $20.95833334 + $20 = $64.54058334.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the total interest earned on each $20, which is 3 months.

So, for each $20, interest is 5.75% per annum * (3/12) = 5.75% * 0.25 = 1.4375% per $20.

So, interest per $20 is $20 * 0.014375 = $0.2875.

So, three $20s would earn 3 * $0.2875 = $0.8625.

Total amount in account would be 3*$20 + $0.8625 = $60 + $0.8625 = $60.8625, which is approximately $60.86.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option E: $60.25, which is 60.25, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the interest earned on the $20 each month, summed over three months, which would be 3 * $0.2875 = $0.8625, and the total amount is $60.86.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option E: $60.25.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest. Let's calculate that.

Each $20 deposited in month 1 earns interest for 2 months: 5.75/12 * 2 = 0.09791667.

So, interest per $20: 20 * 0.09791667 ≈ $1.958333.

Three $20s: 3 * $1.958333 ≈ $5.875.

Total amount: 3*20 + $5.875 = $60 + $5.875 = $65.875.

No, that doesn't make sense because the options are much lower.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, another way to approach this is to use the formula for compound interest for each deposit.

But given the time I've spent on this, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the calculations I've done.

The options are:

A:6.25

B:5.95

C:6.125

D:60.76

E:60.25

F:60

Based on my earlier calculations, I think the correct answer is option E: $60.25, because the total amount after three months is approximately $60.29, which is closest to $60.25. So, I'll go with option E.
</think>

The correct answer is option E: $60.25.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The account earns 5.75% interest annually.
   - Each month, $20 is deposited, and interest is calculated on the deposited amount.

2. **Calculating Monthly Interest:**
   - Annual interest rate = 5.75%.
   - Monthly interest rate = 5.75% / 12 ≈ 0.4791667%.
   - Each $20 deposited earns interest for the remaining months until the end of three months.

3. **Calculating Interest for Each Deposit:**
   - **First Deposit ($20):**
