Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantage—the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places."
Frederick Douglass, 1857

Okay, so I have this question about Frederick Douglass and which social movement influenced him. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Douglass was a prominent figure in the American South, especially during the era of slavery. I think he was influenced by several movements, but I need to figure out which one.

Looking at the question, it mentions that Douglass had a decided advantage because his organizations were complete and he didn't create them. The Federal Government is linked to the slavery system, so that's probably a key point. His views on the pen, purse, and sword against the curse of slavery makes me think he was against slavery and saw it as a system that needs support or resistance.

I also recall that Douglass was a proponent of abolitionism. Abolitionism was a movement opposing slavery, and I think he was quite involved with that. The Abolitionist Movement was a significant one where people like him played a role. They were known for advocating for the removal of slavery, especially in the South, and against the expansion of slavery into other regions.

Another angle is the " Civil Rights Movement," but that's more about ending slavery in the U.S. and other countries, not specifically the Southern states where Douglass was active. The question is about the movement he was most influenced by, so it's probably not the Civil Rights Movement.

Looking at the options:

A: Second Great Awakening—this was a movement in the late 18th-early 19th century, focusing on personal and social change. While he was influenced by social changes, I think more directly by abolitionism.

B: The Enlightenment—Douglass was a proponent of the American Way, which was more about the moral and social values than the broader Enlightenment ideas.

C: The Temperance Movement—this was about anti-slavery movements, but I'm not sure if Douglass was directly associated with that.

D: The Abolitionist Movement—this seems the most likely because Douglass was a leading figure there, especially in the South. He was part of the movement that started in the 1820s and became more prominent in the 1830s.

E: Manifest Destiny—this was about the expansion of the United States into territories for white supremacy, not directly related to Douglass's views on slavery.

F: The Civil Rights Movement—this is a broader movement that's more about the U.S. and the South, but Douglass's main focus was more on the Southern context.

G: First Great Awakening—this was earlier, before the Civil War, and focused on personal and social change. It's possible, but I think Douglass's main influence was more on abolitionism and the movement's focus on removing slavery.

H: The Women's Suffrage Movement—Douglass was a supporter of women's rights, but that's more about female suffrage, not directly about slavery.

I: Popular Sovereignty—this is a philosophical idea that people are the masters of their destiny, which is more about political philosophy than a specific social movement.

J: The Industrial Revolution—Douglass was more about the South and slavery, not the broader industrial revolution.

So, putting it all together, the answer is D: The Abolitionist Movement.

The correct answer is D: The Abolitionist Movement.

Frederick Douglass was most influenced by the Abolitionist Movement, which focused on opposing slavery and promoting the abolition of the slave trade. His involvement in this movement was significant in the context of the Southern United States, where he played a key role in resisting the expansion of slavery and advocating for the end of its influence.
