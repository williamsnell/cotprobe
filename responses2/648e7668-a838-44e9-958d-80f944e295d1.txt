Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve. The question is asking for the limit as x approaches 9 of (x - 9) divided by (sqrt(x) - 3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially when substituting x = 9 directly leads to an indeterminate form like 0/0, I need to manipulate the expression to simplify it. So let's try plugging in x = 9 into both the numerator and the denominator.

The numerator becomes 9 - 9, which is 0. The denominator is sqrt(9) - 3. Since sqrt(9) is 3, that becomes 3 - 3, which is also 0. So, 0/0 is an indeterminate form, which means I need to find another way to evaluate the limit.

One common method for such cases is to factor the numerator and denominator to see if any factors cancel out. Let me try that. The numerator is (x - 9), which can be written as (sqrt(x))^2 - 3^2, since sqrt(x) squared is x. Wait, no, that's not the case. Because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so (sqrt(x))^2 is x. Wait, right, the numerator is x - 9, which is (sqrt(x))^2 - 9. Oh wait, 9 is 3 squared, so yes, that's the difference of squares. So, I can factor the numerator as (sqrt(x) - 3)(sqrt(x) + 3).

So, numerator: x - 9 = (sqrt(x) - 3)(sqrt(x) + 3)
Denominator: sqrt(x) - 3

So, when I substitute x with 9, the denominator becomes 3 - 3 = 0, but the numerator becomes (3 - 3)(6) = 0 * 6 = 0. Wait, that's still 0/0, so perhaps I can cancel the (sqrt(x) - 3) terms.

Wait, but more accurately, the numerator can be written as (sqrt(x) - 3)(sqrt(x) + 3), so when I take the limit as x approaches 9, the denominator is (sqrt(x) - 3). So I can factor that out:

[(sqrt(x) - 3)(sqrt(x) + 3)] / (sqrt(x) - 3) = sqrt(x) + 3, provided that sqrt(x) - 3 is not zero, which would be when x = 9.

So, after canceling the (sqrt(x) - 3) terms, we're left with sqrt(x) + 3. Now, we can substitute x = 9 into this simplified expression.

So sqrt(9) is 3, so 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the limit is 6.

Alternatively, I could have considered using L’Hospital’s Rule, since we had a 0/0 situation. Let's see, taking derivatives of the numerator and denominator. The derivative of (x - 9) is 1, and the derivative of (sqrt(x) - 3) is (1/(2 sqrt(x))). So applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes 1 / (1/(2 sqrt(9))) which is 1 / (1/6) = 6. That also gives the same result.

Wait, but in this case, we didn't need L’Hospital’s Rule because we already saw the expression simplifies. But it's good to know both methods.

So, the limit as x approaches 9 of (x - 9)/(sqrt(x) - 3) is 6.

The problem involves evaluating the limit as x approaches 9 of (x - 9)/(sqrt(x) - 3). Direct substitution results in an indeterminate form 0/0. Factoring the numerator as (sqrt(x) - 3)(sqrt(x) + 3) allows for cancellation of the (sqrt(x) - 3) terms, leaving sqrt(x) + 3. Substituting x = 9 gives 3 + 3 = 6. Thus, the limit is 6.
