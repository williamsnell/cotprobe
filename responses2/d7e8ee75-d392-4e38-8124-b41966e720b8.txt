Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about monetarism. Monetarism is the school of economic thought that argues that the economy's fundamental problem is too much money in the hands of the hands of the few. So, basically, people are saving too much and not spending, and the government is also doing things that create too much money. The idea is that the central bank, like the Fed, should manage the money supply to prevent this from happening.

The question is asking which statement is true under a monetarist view. The options are A to I, with E being the correct answer, I think. Wait, let me go through each option carefully.

Option A: Money supply should be increased steadily. That doesn't sound right. Monetarists would probably oppose increasing money supply too much. They would say that if the economy is overheating with too much money, the central bank should increase it, but not necessarily steadily. Steady increases might lead to inflation, which they'd criticize.

Option B: Velocity of money is unstable. The velocity of money is the theory that money times velocity equals output (MV = PY). Monetarists would say that velocity is stable because they believe the economy is too dependent on money. So, if velocity is unstable, that would imply the economy is being driven more by money, which is bad for them. So this might be a false statement under monetarism.

Option C: Crowding out is not a problem. Crowding out happens when government spending or investment causes the crowding out effect, which is negative because when you spend more, it reduces private investment. Monetarists believe that the economy is too dependent on the central bank's control, so increasing money supply would help stabilize private spending. So if the central bank increases the money supply, it can prevent crowding out. Therefore, option C might be correct.

Option D: Inflation is primarily caused by the decrease in the money supply. Wait, no, that's the opposite. Monetarists believe that the economy is stuck with high money supply and the central bank is the one trying to manage it. So if the money supply increases, it's to prevent inflation. So D is incorrect because D says inflation is caused by a decrease in money, which would be wrong under monetarism.

Option E: Money supply should be decreased. That's opposite of what I thought earlier. Monetarists think increasing money supply is needed. So E is not correct under monetarism.

Option F: Monetary policy has no impact on the economy. No, that's not right. Monetarism says it does, so this is incorrect.

Option G: Fiscal policy is more effective. No, that's a different school, Keynesian theory, which says fiscal policy is more important.

Option H: Crowding out is the main problem. No, under monetarism, crowding out isn't a problem because the central bank can manage the economy by increasing the money supply, which mitigates crowding out.

Option I: Monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy. That's a good way, so I is correct.

So between options C and I. The question is about what the monetarist points of view is.

Monetarists believe that the economy is too dependent on the money supply. So, if the economy is overheated, the central bank should increase the money supply to control it. So, the central bank should increase the money supply, not decrease it.

Option I says monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy. Fine-tuning would mean adjusting the money supply to hit the right level. So I is correct.

Option C says crowding out is not a problem. Yes, because the central bank can prevent it by increasing money supply. So under monetarism, option C is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is true. So both C and I seem correct based on the above reasoning. But looking back, the options are A to I, and the correct answer is E, I think. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the question is "It is a monetarist point of view that", so only one option is correct.

Wait, the options are statements, so I need to think which one is a point of view of monetarism.

Option C: Crowding out is not a problem. That's a statement that aligns with monetarist views because they believe the economy isn't being driven by high money supply but by the central bank's control. So, when the central bank increases the money supply, it prevents crowding out.

Option E: Decreasing the money supply. That's the opposite; they'd increase, not decrease.

Option I is correct: monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy.

So both C and I are correct? But the question asks for the correct option.

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer is E, I, or other?

Wait, the question is which is a point of view of a monetarist. The options are:

A: money supply increases steadily - not a monetarist view, since they probably increase it to prevent inflation.

B: velocity unstable - not a point, because monetarists think velocity is stable.

C: crowding out not a problem - this is a statement that seems to be correct under monetarist view.

D: inflation due to decrease in money - wrong, because they think money increases.

E: money should be decreased - wrong.

F: monetary policy has no impact - wrong.

G: fiscal more effective - wrong.

H: crowding out is main problem - wrong.

I: monetary policy fine-tune - correct.

So both C and I are correct statements under monetarist view.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a multiple-choice, which of the options is correct.

So, the correct answer is E: No, wait, no. Let me double-check.

Wait, the options are:

E: money supply should be decreased to control inflation.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Monetarists think increasing the money supply is needed, not decreasing.

So, looking again, the correct statements under monetarism are C and I.

But the options are:

A: money increase steadily – not correct.

B: velocity unstable – not correct.

C: crowding out not a problem – correct.

D: inflation due to decrease in money – incorrect.

E: money decrease – incorrect.

F: policy no impact – incorrect.

G: fiscal more – incorrect.

H: crowding out main problem – incorrect.

I: fine-tune – correct.

So, the statements that are correct are C and I.

But the options only allow one correct answer.

Wait, the question says "It is a monetarist point of view that...", so which of the options A-I is correct.

Wait, perhaps only one is correct. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, what's each option again:

The question asks, "It is a monetarist point of view that" and is followed by options A-I.

So, the correct answer is the option that reflects a monetarist's belief.

Option I says monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy. That's correct because that's the way the central bank does it.

Option C says that crowding out is not a problem. That's also correct, because under monetarist's view, the central bank can prevent crowding out by increasing the money supply.

But in the context of the question, which of the options is correct? Because the options are multiple, but the answer is a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the question is multiple-choice with only one correct option. So, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, looking back, option C is also correct. So why is that? Because the question is presented as a statement. Both C and I are correct under monetarist theory.

Wait, perhaps in the options, both C and I are correct, but the test expects only one answer.

Wait, the options are:

A: increase steadily – wrong.

B: velocity unstable – wrong.

C: crowding out not a problem – correct.

D: inflation caused by decrease – wrong.

E: decrease – wrong.

F: no impact – wrong.

G: more fiscal – wrong.

H: crowding out main – wrong.

I: fine-tune – correct.

So the correct options under monetarist view are C and I. But the question is asking which statement is true. So I have to choose among these.

Wait, but the options are letters from A to I, and in the question, the correct answer is E, I, etc. But the correct statements are C and I.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing which of the options is correct. But then the user hasn't given the multiple-choice options in a way that's clear.

Wait, looking again, the question seems to be a standard single-answer multiple-choice question. But in the original setup, the options are A to I.

So, looking at the original question, the options are:

A: money should be increased steadily

B: velocity is unstable

C: crowding out not a problem

D: inflation caused by decrease in money

E: money decreased

F: no impact on economy

G: fiscal more effective

H: crowding out main

I: fine-tune

So, under monetarist view, option C and I are correct. But the question is asking which is a correct statement under monetarism.

But in the options, the user lists A-I, so perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct, so both C and I are correct, but among the options, perhaps only one is presented as an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, as it directly states the monetary policy should be fine-tuned.

Wait, but the answer options are A to I, each is a statement. So, if both C and I are correct, but the question asks for which one is a correct statement, but the options don't allow multiple correct answers. So, perhaps the correct answer is option E is incorrect, option I is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the way the question is structured, the correct answer is E? No, that's not right because E says decrease in money, which is wrong for monetarists.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is: It is a monetarist point of view that [which statement]. So, the correct answer is one of the options.

Option E: The money should be decreased to control inflation. No, that's wrong.

Option I: monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy. That's correct.

Option C: crowding out is not a problem. Correct.

So both C and I are correct. But the question must have only one correct choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the correct answer is I. Alternatively, perhaps both are correct, but the user is looking for the best fit.

Wait, the options are A to I, and the correct answers are C and I. But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps under monetarist view, the correct answers are C and I, but the question is presented as a single option. So, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's a direct statement of a monetarist's approach, while C is a statement that's correct but is more of an economic theory in general.

Wait, but the answer is either I or C.

Wait, given that, perhaps the correct answer is I. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both C and I, but the question expects only one option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, as that's a direct statement of a monetarist's approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. But in the context of the question, I think the correct answer is option I: monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy. Because that's exactly what monetarists advocate for.

The question asks which statement aligns with a monetarist perspective. Monetarism emphasizes the importance of the money supply in controlling the economy, asserting that the economy is too dependent on the central bank's control. Under monetarism, the central bank should increase the money supply to prevent inflation and stabilize the economy.

**Analysis of each option:**

- **A: The money supply should be increased steadily.**  
  While monetarists suggest increasing the money supply, they do not recommend a steady increase but rather a strategic approach to avoid inflation.

- **B: The velocity of money is unstable.**  
  Monetarists believe velocity is stable because they argue the economy is under the control of the central bank, and velocity should remain stable.

- **C: Crowding out is not a problem.**  
  Monetarists believe the central bank can prevent crowding out by increasing the money supply, making this statement correct under their view.

- **D: Inflation is primarily caused by the decrease in the money supply.**  
  This is the opposite of monetarism, which argues that the money supply is controlled by the central bank, not the economy.

- **E: Money supply should be decreased to control inflation.**  
  This is incorrect because monetarists advocate for an increase in the money supply to prevent inflation.

- **F: Monetarist theory has no impact on the economy.**  
  Incorrect, as monetarists believe monetary policy has a significant impact.

- **G: Fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy.**  
  Incorrect, as Keynesian theory emphasizes fiscal policy.

- **H: Crowding out is the main problem in the economy.**  
  Incorrect, as monetarists believe the central bank can mitigate crowding out by increasing the money supply.

- **I: Monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy.**  
  Correct, as this is a core principle of monetarism, where the central bank adjusts the money supply to achieve price stability.

- **J: None of the above.**  
  Incorrect, as I is a valid option.

**Conclusion:**
Both **C** and **I** are correct under monetarist theory. However, since the question requires selecting only one option, **I** is the best answer as it directly reflects the central bank's role in fine-tuning the economy, a core principle of monetarism.
