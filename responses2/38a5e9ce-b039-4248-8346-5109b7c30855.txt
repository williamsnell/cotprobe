Question:

In class, John's teacher tells him that she will give him the coin and bill for each picture he can correctly identify on the face of the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half-dollar, dollar bill, and five-dollar bill. John cannot identify any of them although he has been handling money for 17 years. His inability to remember the pictures most likely results from

Options:

A: sensory memory decay
B: retroactive interference
C: failure to encode
D: failure to reconstruct
E: false memory formation
F: lack of attention
G: failure to retrieve
H: confabulation
I: deep processing
J: proactive interference

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about John's inability to remember the pictures on his coins and bills. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says John cannot identify any of the coins and bills, but his teacher told him to remember each one. The options given are related to memory concepts. I'm a bit rusty on my memory techniques, so I'll need to think carefully.

First, I remember that there are different types of memory. The main ones are sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. The question is about short-term memory, I think.

The teacher told him to remember each coin and bill, so that suggests he's trying to encode each item into his memory. Encoding is the process of converting information into something he can remember. But if he's failing to retrieve the information, that means he didn't remember it after the teacher told him.

Wait, but the question is about why he can't remember them. So, if he's not retrieving them, maybe he's not even encoding them in the first place. That would mean something's wrong with how he's trying to remember.

Another concept is false memory, which is when you remember something incorrectly. But that's a different issue. The question doesn't mention any errors, just that he can't identify them. So maybe he's struggling with encoding.

There's also something called retroactive interference. I think that's when you try to remember something that's been forgotten. Like, if you remember a previous event and then forget it, it interferes with current thinking. But in this case, the teacher told him to remember, so maybe he's trying to interfere with the teacher's instruction.

Wait, the question is about the inability to retrieve. So if he's trying to store information but can't retrieve it, what's the underlying cause? That would be failure to encode. Because if he can't encode, he can't retrieve it.

Looking at the options, let me list them again:

A: Sensory memory decay — Maybe his memory for images doesn't improve over time if he's not remembering.

B: Retroactive interference — Maybe he's confusing the teacher's instruction with the images.

C: Failure to encode — He's not storing the information properly.

D: Failure to reconstruct — Hmm, reconstructing might be about putting things together, but I'm not sure.

E: False memory — Not sure, but that's about remembering something wrong.

F: Lack of attention — If he's not paying attention, he might not focus on the task, so he can't remember.

G: Failure to retrieve — So he can't even get the information stored correctly.

H: Confabulation — That's when you confuse two different things, but again, not directly related.

I: Deep processing — That's about thinking deeply about information, which might not be the issue here.

J: Proactive interference — That's when you try to remember something that's been just learned, which can cause interference.

Wait, the question is about his inability to correctly identify the coins and bills. So he's probably trying to remember the pictures, but maybe he's not encoding them correctly. Or maybe he's not retrieving them because he's forgotten.

Alternatively, if he's not encoding, he can't retrieve. So his failure to retrieve might be due to failure to encode. But I'm a bit confused between options G and F.

Wait, the question is about the cause of his inability to remember. So if he's trying to remember but can't retrieve, perhaps he's failing to encode the information. Because encoding is the storage. So maybe he's not storing the images correctly.

Option G is failure to retrieve — but that's the effect, not the cause. The question is about why he can't retrieve. So if he can't retrieve, that's because he didn't encode. So it's failure to encode.

But wait, another thought: when you encode, you're storing it. So without encoding, he can't retrieve. So his inability to retrieve could be due to failure to encode.

Alternatively, if he's trying to retrieve but can't because he's not encoding the images, that makes sense.

So the correct answer would be G: failure to retrieve. Wait, but the options don't have a 'failure to encode' as separate; the options are A to J.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Sensory memory decay — That's about forgetting, not encoding.

B: Retroactive interference — Maybe interfering with the teacher's instruction.

C: Failure to encode — That's directly about storing.

D: Failure to reconstruct — Not sure.

E: False memory — No.

F: Lack of attention — Maybe not.

G: Failure to retrieve — So the answer would be G.

Wait, but I thought that if you're trying to encode, you can't retrieve. So the cause is failure to encode, which is failure to retrieve. So the answer is G.

But wait, I'm now confused because the options are in the list, and sometimes these can be tricky.

Alternatively, the teacher told him to remember, which is an attempt. So he's trying to encode, but failing to retrieve. So the failure to retrieve is because he didn't encode.

So the answer is G: failure to retrieve.

Wait, but another angle: maybe he's not retrieving because he's failing to encode. So yes, G.

Alternatively, if he's trying to remember but can't, perhaps the failure is in encoding.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of it another way. If he's forgetting, that's sensory decay (A). If he's not encoding, he can't retrieve. So the cause is failure to encode, which is G.

But wait, another thought. Maybe the teacher told him to remember, which is a task. If he can't encode, then he can't retrieve. So the response is G.

Alternatively, I've heard that when you try to remember something but can't, it's often because you didn't encode it. So the failure to retrieve is because he hasn't encoded it.

So the correct answer is G: failure to retrieve.

The question asks why John cannot remember the pictures of coins and bills despite being told to do so. The key is to identify the underlying cause of his inability to retrieve the information after attempting to encode it.

- **Option A (Sensory memory decay)**: This refers to forgetting images over time, which is unrelated to encoding or retrieval.
- **Option B (Retroactive interference)**: This involves interfering with previous information, which doesn't explain the inability to retrieve.
- **Option C (Failure to encode)**: Correct. Encoding is the process of storing information. If he can't encode, he can't retrieve.
- **Option D (Failure to reconstruct)**: This term is unclear and doesn't fit the context.
- **Option E (False memory formation)**: This is about recalling incorrect information, which isn't mentioned.
- **Option F (Lack of attention)**: Not directly related to memory storage.
- **Option G (Failure to retrieve)**: The effect of not encoding, which fits because he can't retrieve after encoding.
- **Option H (Confabulation)**: Confusing two things, not relevant.
- **Option I (Deep processing)**: This involves thinking deeply, irrelevant.
- **Option J (Proactive interference)**: Trying to remember something recently learned, which could interfere, but not the cause of failure to retrieve.

The correct answer is **G: failure to retrieve**, as it directly explains John's inability to retrieve information after encoding.
