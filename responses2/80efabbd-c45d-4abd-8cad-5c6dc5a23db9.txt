Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: We have two independent random samples, X and Y, both of the same size n. We want to find n such that the interval (x̄ - ȳ) ± 4 is a 90% confidence interval for the difference in means, μ_X - μ_Y. The standard deviations are given: σ_X is 15 and σ_Y is 25.

Hmm. I remember that confidence intervals for the difference in means involve the standard error of the difference. Since the samples are independent, the variance of (x̄ - ȳ) is the sum of the variances. So the standard error (SE) would be sqrt( (σ_X² / n) + (σ_Y² / n) ), right? Because both have the same sample size.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. So SE = sqrt( (σ_X² + σ_Y² ) / n ), and since both have the same n, it's σ_X²/n + σ_Y²/n. So the SE is sqrt( (15² + 25²) / n ). 15 squared is 225, 25 squared is 625. So 225+625 is 850. So SE = sqrt(850 / n).

Now, the confidence interval is given as ±4. But what's the z-score here? Since it's a 90% confidence interval, and we're using the standard normal distribution (assuming large sample sizes), the z-score for 90% confidence is about 1.645. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 90% confidence, which is a two-tailed test. So for 90%, the critical value is 1.645? Let me double-check. For 95% confidence, the z is 1.96, which is correct. For 90%, it's lower. Let me think: 1.645 is the z for 90% confidence because 95% is 1.96, 99% is 2.576. So yes, 1.645 is correct.

Wait wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a 90% confidence interval, the z-score is 1.645. Because when you split the 10% into two tails, each tail has 5%, so the z that leaves 5% in the tail is 1.645. Yes, that's right.

So the confidence interval is calculated as x̄ - ȳ ± (z * SE). And here, the interval is given as ±4. So 4 equals z * SE.

So 4 = 1.645 * sqrt(850 / n).

I need to solve for n. Let's write that equation:

4 = 1.645 * sqrt(850 / n).

Wait, let me rearrange it. Let's first divide both sides by 1.645:

sqrt(850 / n) = 4 / 1.645.

Compute 4 divided by 1.645. Let me calculate that.

1.645 * 2 is 3.29, and 3.29 * 2 is 6.58. Wait, wait, 1.645 is approximately 1.645.

Wait 1.645 * 2.44 is about 3.99 (because 1.645 * 2 is 3.29, 1.645 * 0.44 is ~0.727, so 3.29 + 0.727 ≈ 4.017). So 4 divided by 1.645 is approximately 2.44. So sqrt(850/n) ≈ 2.44.

So sqrt(850/n) = 2.44.

Now, square both sides:

850 / n = (2.44)^2.

What's 2.44 squared? 2.44 * 2.44. Let me compute that: 2 * 2 =4, 2 * 0.44= 0.88, so 2.44^2 = (2 + 0.44)^2 = 2² + 2*2*0.44 +0.44² = 4 + 1.76 + 0.1936 = 5.9536. So approximately 5.95.

So 850 / n = 5.95.

Then, n = 850 / 5.95.

Let me compute that.

Divide 850 by 5.95. Let's see: 5.95 * 140 is 5.95 *100 =595, 5.95 *40=238. So 595 + 238 = 833. So 5.95 *140 =833. So 850 -833=17. So 17/5.95 is approximately 2.88 (since 5.95 *2=11.9, 5.95*3=17.85). Wait, no, 17 is about 17/5.95≈ 2.88.

Wait, 5.95 * 140 = 833. 850 -833=17. So 17 /5.95 = 2.88, approximately.

So n ≈140 + 2.88 ≈142.88. Since n must be an integer, we'll need to check the options around this value.

Looking at the options: options are 180, 144, 120, 210, 100, 150, 170, 130, 160, 200. Hmm, 142.88 is between 144 and 130. Let me see the options.

Wait, wait, wait. Are the options in order? Let me check the options.

Options:

A:180

B:144

C:120

D:210

E:100

F:150

G:170

H:130

I:160

J:200

So 142.88 is closest to 144 (option B) and 130 (option H). But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the z-score. Let me think: 90% confidence interval. Let me double-check the z-value. For a 90% confidence interval, which is 10% in the tails, each tail is 5%. The critical z is the value where the area to the right of it is 5% in a standard normal distribution. So the z-value is 1.645. Because 95% is 1.645, 90% is lower. So I think I was correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me re-derive the confidence interval.

The formula for the confidence interval when the population variances are known is:

(x̄ - ȳ) ± z * sqrt( (σ_X² /n ) + (σ_Y² /n ) )

Which simplifies to ± z * sqrt( (σ_X² + σ_Y² ) /n )

So that part is right.

So 4 = z * sqrt( (15² +25²)/n )

15² is 225, 25² is 625. So sum is 850. So sqrt(850/n) = 4 / 1.645 ≈2.44.

Square both sides: 850/n= (2.44)^2≈5.95.

So n=850/5.95≈142.88.

So the closest option is 144 (option B) or 130 (option H). Hmm. Wait, but 144 is an option, but 142.88 is closer to 144? 142.88 is 0.12 away from 144 and 0.88 away from 130. So probably 144 is the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I used the correct z-value. Wait, what is the z for a 90% confidence interval? Let me think. For 90%, the two-tailed test. The critical z is such that 95% of the data is within ±1.96, 99% is ±2.575. So 90% would be 95% -5%, so the z is lower than 1.96.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate it precisely. Let me compute the exact z-value for 90% confidence.

The formula for the confidence interval's z is found by finding the value such that P(-z < Z < z) = 0.90. Since it's a two-tailed test, each tail is 0.05. So the z is the value where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at z is 0.95. So for a standard normal distribution, what z satisfies P(Z < z) = 0.95.

Looking up a z-table, 0.95 is about 1.6448536. So approximately 1.645 as I used earlier. So that was correct.

So seems n is approximately 142.88, so the closest option is 144 (option B).

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me re-calculate this to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Compute 850 /5.95.

Let me compute 850 / 5.95.

Divide 850 by 5.95.

An alternative way is to compute 850 ÷ 5.95.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 85000 ÷ 595.

Compute 595 * 142 = ?

595 * 100 =59,500.

595 * 40=23,800. 59,500 +23,800=83,300.

595 * 2=1,190.

So 595 *142=83,300 + (1,190) =84,490.

But 85000 is 84,490 plus 510. So how many times does 595 go into 510? 510/595 ≈0.858.

So 142 + 0.858 ≈ 142.858. So 850 /5.95 ≈142.858, so n≈142.86.

So the answer is approximately 142.86. Now, looking at the options, the closest integer is 144 (option B). However, wait, let's see if any of the options give a more precise value.

Wait another thing. Let me check what 850 /5.95 is exactly.

5.95 * 144 = ?

5.95 *100=595.

5.95 *40=238.

5.95 *4=23.8.

So 595 +238=833; 833 +23.8=856.8.

Wait, 5.95 *144 =856.8. But our numerator is 850. So 5.95 *144=856.8, which is larger than 850 by 6.8.

So 850 is 6.8 less than 856.8. So 850 /5.95=144 - (6.8/5.95)≈144 -1.143≈142.857. So that's consistent with earlier.

So n≈142.86. The options are 144 (142.86 is 1.14 less than 144), 130 (12.86 higher). So 144 is the closest, making option B the correct answer.

To determine the required sample size \( n \) such that the interval \( \bar{x} - \bar{y} \pm 4 \) forms a 90% confidence interval for \( \mu_X - \mu_Y \), we use the formula for the confidence interval for the difference of means. The standard error (SE) is given by:

\[
\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_X^2}{n} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2}{n}}
\]

Here, \( \sigma_X = 15 \), \( \sigma_Y = 25 \), so:

\[
\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{15^2 + 25^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{850}{n}}
\]

For a 90% confidence interval, the critical value \( z \) is approximately 1.645. The confidence interval width is given as 4, which corresponds to:

\[
4 = z \cdot \text{SE}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
4 = 1.645 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{850}{n}}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( n \):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{850}{n}} = \frac{4}{1.645} \approx 2.44
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{850}{n} = (2.44)^2 \approx 5.95
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{850}{5.95} \approx 142.86
\]

The closest integer value from the options provided is **144**. Therefore, the correct answer is:
