Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts. But I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking about the energy emitted by a large number of atoms, specifically Avogadro's number. Hmm. Let's see.

The question states: How much energy is emitted by Avogadro's number of atoms, each emitting a light wave of 400 nm wavelength? The options are A through J, with varying values.

Wait, I remember that Avogadro's number is about 6.022 × 10^23 atoms per mole. Oh right, so when you have a large number of atoms, like a mole, you can use Avogadro's number to convert between atoms and moles.

Each atom emits a light wave with a wavelength of 400 nm. I think the energy of a single photon is related to its wavelength, and then we can multiply that by Avogadro's number to get the total energy for a mole of atoms.

Oh right, the formula for the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. I think h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s, and c is 3.00 × 10^8 m/s.

Wait, the wavelength is given as 400 nm. Oh, nm is nanometers, which is 1e-9 meters. So 400 nm is 400e-9 meters. That's 4 × 10^-7 meters? Wait, wait, 400e-9 is 4e-7 meters? Let me check: 400 nm is 400 x 10^-9 m, which is 4 x 10^-7 m. Yes.

So, substituting into E=hc/λ:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (4e-7 m)

Let me compute that. Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3 )e(-34+8) = 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, because the units would be J·s * m/s = J·m, right, so E is (1.9878e-25 J·m) divided by 4e-7 m. The meters cancel out, so E = (1.9878e-25 / 4e-7) J.

Let me calculate that. 1.9878e-25 divided by 4e-7 is the same as (1.9878 / 4 ) * (1e-25 / 1e-7) ) = (0.49695) * (1e-18) ) = 4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Wait, wait, that's the energy of one photon. But the question is about Avogadro's number of atoms. So each atom emits one photon, assuming each atom emits a single photon? So the total energy would be energy per photon multiplied by Avogadro's number.

So total energy E_total = N_A * E_photon.

N_A is 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So E_total = (6.022e23 atoms/mol) * (4.9695e-19 J/photon) )

Wait, let me compute that. 6.022e23 * 4.9695e-19 = ?

Let me first compute 6.022 * 4.9695. Let me approximate: 6.022 * 5 is 30.11, but it's 4.9695, which is about 0.03 less. So 6.022 * (5 - 0.03) = 6.022 *5 = 30.11 minus 6.022 *0.03 = 0.18066 → 30.11 - 0.1807 ≈ 29.9293.

So approximately 29.9293, but we need to account for exponents. Wait, 6.022e23 * 4.9695e-19 = (6.022 *4.9695) * 1e(23-19) = 29.929 * 1e4 → 299290 J/mol? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 29.929 * 1e4 is 299290 J/mol. So, 2.9929e5 J/mol? Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, 6e23 multiplied by 5e-19 is 3e5, but 4.9695 is a bit less than 5, so 6e23 *4.9695e-19= (6 *4.9695 )e(23-19) )= 29.817e4 → 298,170 J/mol.

Wait, but why did I get 29.929 earlier? Oh, I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me redo the multiplication.

Wait, 6.022 * 4.9695 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

4.9695 = 5 - 0.0305.

So 6.022 * 5 = 30.11. Then subtract 6.022 * 0.0305.

6.022 * 0.03 = 0.18066; 6.022 *0.0005=0.003011; so 0.18066 +0.003011=0.183671.

So 30.11 - 0.183671 = 29.9263.

So 29.9263e4 → wait, no. Wait, 6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 = (6.022 *4.9695) *1e(23-19) )= (29.9263) *1e4 = 299,263 J/mol.

Wait, no. Wait, 6.022e23 is 6.022 times 1e23, and 4.9695e-19 is 4.9695 times 1e-19. So when multiplied, the powers are 1e23 *1e-19 = 1e4. So 6.022 *4.9695 is about 29.9263, so 29.9263e4 J/mol. Because 1e4 is 10,000. So 29.9263 *1e4 is 299,263 J/mol.

Wait, but 1e4 is 10^4, so 29.9263 *1e4 = 299,263 J/mol. Wait, but I thought the calculation was 299,263 J/mol? But wait, that can't be right because 1 mole of photons has a certain energy, but Avogadro's number is a huge number, so the energy would be a big number.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute exponents:

6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 = (6.022 *4.9695) * 10^(23 -19) )= (29.9263) * 10^4 → which is 29.9263 *10,000 → 299,263 J per mole.

Wait, but the options given are in the range of 1e5 to 6e5 J. Wait, 299,263 J/mol is about 3e5 J/mol. Oh, but the options are like 1e5, 2e5, etc.

Wait, but I think I miscalculated the exponents. Let me check.

Wait, 6.022e23 is 6.022 * 1e23.

4.9695e-19 is 4.9695 *1e-19.

So when multiplying, 6.022 * 4.9695 → approximately 29.9263.

The exponents: 1e23 *1e-19 = 1e4. So 29.9263 *1e4 = 299263 J/mol.

But wait, that's 29.9263e4 → 299,263 J/mol. But looking at the options, option F is 2.98e5 J, which is about 3e5. So 299,263 J is 2.99263e5 J. So which option is that? Let's see.

Options:

A:5.20e5

B:2.58e5

C:2.20e5

D:3.50e5

E:1.98e5

F:2.98e5

G:4.98e5

H:3.98e5

I:1.50e5

J:6.02e5

So 2.99e5 is option F. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate E_photon:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ=400e-9 m = 4e-7 m.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8)/(4e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) = (1.9878 /4 )e-18 → 0.49695e-18 J → 4.9695e-19 J.

Wait, wait, 1.9878e-25 divided by 4e-7 equals (1.9878 /4) * (1e-25 /1e-7) )= 0.49695 * 1e-18 → 4.9695e-19 J. So that's correct. So E_photon is 4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Then, Avogadro number is 6.022e23 atoms/mol. So total energy per mole is 6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 J.

Let me compute that:

6.022e23 * 4.9695e-19 = (6.022 *4.9695) *1e(23-19) = 29.9263 *1e4 = 299,263 J/mol. Which is 2.99263e5 J/mol. So approximately 3e5 J. So the closest option is F: 2.98e5 J. Oh wait, 2.99e5 is option F? No, wait:

Wait, 2.98e5 is option F, and 2.99e5 is option F? Let me check the options again. Oh, option F is 2.98 ×10^5 J, which is 298,000 J. Wait, my calculation came to about 299,263 J. So which is closer: 298,000 or 299,263? 298,000 is option F, 299,263 is not exactly an option. But the closest is F, perhaps. But let me double-check the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: the energy of a photon is E = (1240 eV·nm)/λ. Because λ in nm, E in eV.

Wait, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, but perhaps that's a bit more complicated. Let me try this method.

λ=400 nm → 400 nm.

E_photon = 1240 eV·nm / 400 nm = 3.1 eV.

Wait, but 3.1 eV is about 3.1 ×1.6e-19 J = 4.96e-19 J per photon. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.

So 6.022e23 atoms × 4.9695e-19 J/photon = 2.99e5 J per mole. So the correct answer should be approximately 3e5 J/mol.

Looking at the options, F is 2.98e5 J, which is close. But wait, perhaps the precise calculation using the 1240 method.

Wait, using 1240 eV·nm / λ (nm) gives E in eV. So 400 nm → 1240/400 = 3.1 eV.

3.1 eV is 3.1 * 1.602e-19 J = 4.966e-19 J per photon.

So same as before. So 6.022e23 *4.966e-19 = (6.022 *4.966) *1e4.

6*4.966 is about 29.796. 0.022 *4.966 = approx 0.109. So total ≈30. So 30 *1e4 = 3e5 J/mol. So the answer is 3e5 J/mol, which is 3 x10^5 J. So the closest option is F:2.98e5, which is about 298,000 J. But wait, that's 2.98e5, which is 298,000, but the calculated is 299,263.

Hmm. So perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 6.022 ×4.9695.

6.022 ×4.9695= ?

Let me compute 6 ×4.9695=29.817.

0.022 ×4.9695=0.109329.

So 29.817 +0.109329=29.926329.

So 29.926329 ×1e4 → 299,263.29 J/mol.

Which is 2.9926329e5 J/mol. So approximately 2.99e5 J/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:2.98e5 J. But wait, 2.99e5 is 299,000, which is 100 J higher than option F. So perhaps option F is the correct one, but wait, why isn't it exactly 3e5 J/mol?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach? Or maybe using the wrong formula.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in using the formula. Another way to think about it: the energy per mole is Avogadro's number multiplied by the energy per molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula E=hc/λ, but I'm using the correct values?

Wait, another approach: use E = hc / λ, where λ is in meters.

So hc is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ=400 nm=400e-9 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (400e-9) → 1.9878e-25 / 4e-7 → (1.9878 / 4) *1e(-25 +7) → 0.49695e-18 → 4.9695e-19 J. Same as before.

So E per atom is 4.9695e-19 J.

So per mole, multiply by 6.022e23: 4.9695e-19 *6.022e23 = (4.9695 *6.022) *1e4.

4.9695 *6.022 → Let's compute it accurately.

4 *6 =24, 0.9695 *6 ≈5.817, 4 *0.022=0.088, and 0.9695 *0.022≈0.0213.

So 24 +5.817 +0.088 +0.0213= 24+5.817=29.817+0.088=29.905+0.0213=29.9263.

So 29.9263 *1e4 =299,263 J/mol. So 2.99263e5 J/mol. Looking at the options, option F is 2.98e5 J, which is 298,000 J, but our result is 299,263 J. That's a difference of about 1,263 J. Which is about 0.004% off.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that we should be using Avogadro's number in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of hc/(λ in angstrom) which would give E in eV, and then converted to joules. Let's try that approach.

hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ in angstrom is 400 angstrom, since 1 angstrom is 10^-10 m. So 400 angstrom =400 *1e-10 m=4e-8 m.

Wait, no, wait: 400 nm is 400e-9 m =4e-7 m.

Alternatively, 400 nm =4000 angstrom. Oh wait, no. 1 angstrom is 10^-10 m, so 400 nm = 400e-9 m =4e-7 m =40,000 angstrom. Because 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 400e-9 m =400e-9 /1e-10 =400e1 =40,000 angstrom. Hmm, that's a huge number.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I thought λ=400 nm, which is 4e-7 m. So for the formula E = hc / λ, λ in meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (4e-7) → (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) → 0.49695e-18 →4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Which is same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents when multiplying. Let me do that again.

1.9878e-25 divided by 4e-7.

So 1.9878e-25 / 4e-7 = (1.9878 /4) * (1e-25 /1e-7) ) → 0.49695 * 1e-18 → 4.9695e-19 J.

So, same as before.

So perhaps the correct answer is 2.98e5 J per mole, which is option F. But according to the precise calculation, it's 2.992e5 J/mol. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the wavelength. Let me double-check.

Wait, 400 nm is 400e-9 m =4e-7 m. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Avogadro's number is used in a different way. For example, using the formula E = (hc)/(λ) where λ is in meters, and E is in joules, and then multiply by Avogadro's number.

Wait, in that case, E (per mole) would be (hc/λ) * N_A.

Which is (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (4e-7) ) *6.022e23 → same as before.

Which gives us 2.99e5 J/mol. So I think the correct option is F:2.98e5 J.

Wait, but why is the precise calculation 2.99e5? Let me recompute 6.022 *4.9695.

6.022 *4.9695 = ?

Let me compute 6 *4.9695 = 29.817.

0.022 *4.9695 = approx 0.109329.

So total: 29.817 +0.109329=29.926329.

Now, 29.926329e4 is 29.926329 *1e4 =299,263.29.

Which is approximately 299,263 J/mol.

But the options don't have 299,263 J.

So the options are:

A:5.20e5

B:2.58e5

C:2.20e5

D:3.50e5

E:1.98e5

F:2.98e5

G:4.98e5

H:3.98e5

I:1.50e5

J:6.02e5

So option F is 2.98e5, which is 298,000 J/mol. The exact calculation is 299,263 J/mol. So that's 1,263 J/mol higher than option F.

Wait, but if I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should recalculate using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E = hc/(λ). But perhaps I should use E = (hc)/(λ) where λ is in Angstroms.

Wait, let me try that approach. So λ in Angstroms =400e-10 m → 400 Angstroms.

Wait, because 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 400 Angstroms is 400e-10 m=4e-8 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(4e-8) → (1.9878e-25) / (4e-8) → 0.49695e-17 → 4.9695e-18 J.

Wait, that's not right. Because 400 Angstroms is much smaller than 400 nm. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: use E = (hc)/(λ), where λ is in Angstroms.

So λ=400 nm=400e-9 m=4000 Angstroms (since 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 1 nm is 10 Angstroms).

Wait, 400 nm=4000 Angstroms.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (4000e-10) → (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) → 4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Which is the same as before.

So that doesn't change the result.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute the energy per mole more precisely.

Wait, here's another way: Avogadro's number is 6.022e23. The energy per mole is (6.022e23) * (E per atom).

E per atom is (hc)/(lambda) → (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (400e-9) → (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) → 4.9695e-19 J.

So E per mole =6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 → (6.022 *4.9695) *1e(23-19) →29.9263 *1e4 →299,263 J/mol.

So 299,263 J/mol is 2.99263e5 J/mol.

Looking at the options:

F:2.98e5 J.

So the correct answer should be F, but the precise calculation is 299,263 J/mol, which is higher than F.

But perhaps in the problem statement, the numbers are approximate, so the correct answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, let me compute 6.022e23 *4.9695e-19.

6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 = (6.022 *4.9695) * (1e23 *1e-19) → 29.9263 *1e4 →299,263 J/mol.

Which is 2.99263e5 J/mol.

So the options don't have exactly this value. So perhaps the intended answer is F, which is 2.98e5 J/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the formula E= (hc)/lambda, and using Avogadro's number, but perhaps the problem expects a miscalculation and the answer is F.

Wait, but in any case, the precise calculation yields approximately 2.99e5 J/mol, which is 299,263 J/mol. Since that's not an available option, but option F is 2.98e5 J/mol, which is 298,000 J/mol, which is 1,263 J/mol less than the calculated value.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculations once more.

Wait, another way: E= (hc)/lambda.

hc=6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

lambda=400e-9 m=4e-7 m.

So E= (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) = 4.9695e-19 J per photon.

Then, per mole: 6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 =299,263 J/mol.

So it's 299,263 J/mol.

But the options don't have this number. But option F is 2.98e5 J/mol, which is 298,000 J/mol. So that's 1,263 J/mol less than the correct answer.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this, but perhaps the correct answer is option F. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula E= (2.98e5) * (Avogadro's number) * (1e-20). No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses E= hc/(lambda) with lambda in nm, then converts to eV before converting to joules.

Wait, let's try that approach.

E (eV) = 1240 / lambda (nm).

So lambda=400 nm →E=1240/400=3.1 eV.

E (J) =3.1 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV =4.96e-19 J per photon.

Same as before.

So, E per mole is 6.022e23 *4.96e-19 =299,263 J/mol.

So, I think the correct answer is F: 2.98e5 J/mol.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation using Avogadro's number in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses E = (hc)/(lambda) and then converts to eV, and then directly uses the Avogadro's number multiplied by eV to get the energy in joules.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy per mole using E= (hc/(lambda)) * N_A.

Wait, so hc/(lambda) is energy per photon. N_A is photons per mole.

So E per mole is hc/(lambda) * N_A.

So hc=6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25 J·m.

lambda=400e-9 m.

So hc/lambda = 1.9878e-25 /4e-7 =4.9695e-19 J per photon.

N_A=6.022e23.

So E per mole =4.9695e-19 *6.022e23 = (4.9695 *6.022) *1e4.

4.9695 *6.022 = approx 29.9263 → 29.9263e4 → 299,263 J/mol.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula E= (hc)/(lambda) and then multiply by Avogadro's number to get the energy per mole.

Wait, that's what I did.

So, E per mole is (hc/lambda) * N_A.

Which is (6.626e-34 *3e8 /4e-7) *6.022e23 → (1.9878e-25 /4e-7) *6.022e23 → (4.9695e-19) *6.022e23 → 299,263 J/mol.

So, I think the correct answer is F:2.98e5 J/mol.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in using the formula. Because when I use the formula E = hc/(lambda), and then multiply by Avogadro's number to get the energy per mole, that's correct.

But I think that the correct calculation gives 299,263 J/mol, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is F:2.98e5 J/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy per mole using Avogadro's number and the formula E = hc/(lambda).

Wait, in any case, I think the correct answer is F:2.98e5 J/mol.

To calculate the energy emitted by the Avogadro number of atoms, each emitting a photon with a wavelength of 400 nm, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert the wavelength to meters**:  
   \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} = 400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

2. **Use the formula for energy of a photon**:  
   \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \),  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Substitute the values**:  
   \( E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4 \times 10^{-7}} \).  
   Simplify the numerator:  
   \( 6.626 \times 3 = 19.878 \), so \( 19.878 \times 10^{-26} \).  
   Denominator: \( 4 \times 10^{-7} \).  
   \( E = \frac{19.878 \times 10^{-26}}{4 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{19.878}{4} \times 10^{-19} \).  
   \( E = 4.9695 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/photon} \).

4. **Calculate the energy per mole**:  
   \( E_{\text{molar}} = N_A \times E \),  
   where \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \).  
   \( E_{\text{molar}} = (6.022 \times 10^{23})(4.9695 \times 10^{-19}) \).  
   \( E_{\text{molar}} = 29.9263 \times 10^4 \, \text{J/mol} \).  
   \( E_{\text{molar}} = 2.99263 \times 10^5 \, \text{J/mol} \).

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest option to \( 2.99263 \times 10^5 \, \text{J/mol} \) is **F: 2.98 × 10⁵ J**.  
   The slight discrepancy (≈1,263 J/mol) could be due to rounding or approximation in the problem setup.
