Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shepp'sStore buying camping hotplates and figuring out the amount paid after discounts. Let's take it step by step.

First, the problem says that on December 10, Shepp'sStore bought the hotplates for $56.65 minus a trade discount of 10%. Then, the terms offered were (2/10), (n/30). Shepp'sStore paid on December 20. I need to find the amount paid.

Let me start by figuring out the trade discount. A 10% discount on $56.65. Hmm, 10% of 56.65 is 5.665, so subtracting that from 56.65 gives me the discounted price. Let me calculate that: 56.65 - 5.665 = 50.985. Oh, but I should probably round to the nearest cent. So that's $50.99. Okay, so after the discount, the price is $50.99.

Now, the terms are (2/10), (n/30). So that means if you pay within 10 days, you get a 2% discount. Otherwise, you have to pay the full amount with n/30, where n is 30 days. Shepp bought on December 10 and paid on December 20. Let me see, the time between December 10 and December 20 is 10 days. So she paid within the 10-day window.

So, since she paid within 10 days, she qualifies for the 2% discount on the already discounted price of $50.99. So I need to calculate 2% of 50.99 and subtract that from 50.99.

Calculating 2% of 50.99: 0.02 * 50.99 = 1.0198. So subtracting that gives 50.99 - 1.0198 = 49.9702. Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $49.97.

Looking at the options, option B is $49.97. So I think the correct answer is B.
