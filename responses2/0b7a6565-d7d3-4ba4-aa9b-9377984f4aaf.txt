Okay, so I've got this fluid dynamics question here about potential functions and velocity components. Let's see if I can figure it out. 

The question says that phi equals x squared minus y squared is a potential function for an irrotational flow. I remember that in irrotational flow, the velocity components are related to the gradient of the potential function. Oh right, the velocity vector V is the gradient of phi. So V_x is the partial derivative of phi with respect to x, V_y is the partial derivative with respect to y, and V_z is the partial derivative with respect to z.

So let's compute each component. 

First, phi = x² - y².

For V_x, I take the partial derivative of phi with respect to x. The derivative of x² is 2x, and the derivative of -y² with respect to x is zero. So V_x = 2x.

Next, V_y is the partial derivative with respect to y. The derivative of x² is zero, and the derivative of -y² is -2y. So V_y = -2y.

V_z is the partial derivative of phi with respect to z. Since phi doesn't depend on z, V_z is zero.

So putting it all together, the velocity vector V is (2x, -2y, 0). Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option C says V_x=2x, V_y=-2y, V_z=0. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check: is there any other component I might have missed? No, because phi is only a function of x and y, not z, so V_z is zero. Also, the other options don't match. Option B has V_x=2y and V_y=-2x, which would be the case if phi was y² - x², but our phi is x² - y². So B isn't right. Option D has V_x=x and V_y=y, which would be if phi were x² + y², but that's not the case. Option H has V_z=-z, which isn't what we have. Option I has V_z = z, which is also wrong. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine the velocity components for an irrotational flow with potential function \(\phi = x^2 - y^2\), we use the fact that the velocity vector \(\mathbf{V}\) is the gradient of \(\phi\). The velocity components are calculated as follows:

- \(V_x = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = 2x\),
- \(V_y = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} = -2y\),
- \(V_z = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} = 0\).

Thus, the velocity vector is \(\mathbf{V} = (2x, -2y, 0)\). Comparing this with the given options, the correct choice is **C: \(V_x = 2x\), \(V_y = -2y\), \(V_z = 0\)**.
