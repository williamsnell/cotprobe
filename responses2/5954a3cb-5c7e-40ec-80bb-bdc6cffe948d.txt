Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about precipitation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solubility products, but let me try to think it through.

The question says I mix 50ml of 5.0e-4 M Ca(NO3)2 with 50ml of 2.0e-4 M NaF, and the total volume is 100ml. I need to find out if precipitation happens. The Ksp for CaF2 is 1.7e-10.

Wait, so precipitation happens when the product of the concentrations of the ions exceeds the solubility product. Right, Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 because CaF2 dissociates into Ca²+ and 2F⁻. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, CaF2 is Ca²+ plus F⁻? No, wait, CaF2 is Ca²+ and F⁻? No, wait, CaF2 is Ca²+ and F²-? No, wait, no. Wait, CaF2 is Ca²+ and F⁻. Wait, no, CaF2 is Ca²+ and two F⁻? Wait no, wait. CaF2 is Ca²+ and F²- because the formula is CaF2, so each molecule gives one Ca²+ and two F⁻. So the dissociation is CaF2 ↔ Ca²+ + 2F⁻. So the expression for Ksp is [Ca²+][F⁻]^2.

So the Ksp is 1.7e-10.

Now, I need to find the concentrations of Ca²+ and F⁻ in the 100ml solution after mixing.

Wait, both solutions are diluted by the same volume. Each 50ml is diluted into 100ml. So each concentration is halved.

So initial Ca(NO3)2 concentration is 5.0e-4 M in 50ml. So when diluted to 100ml, it's (5.0e-4) * (50/100) )= (5e-4 * 0.5) = 2.5e-4 M. So [Ca²+] is 2.5e-4 M.

The NaF solution is 2.0e-4 M in 50ml. So when diluted to 100ml, it's 1.0e-4 M. So [F⁻] is 1.0e-4 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The NaF is Na+ and F⁻. So when you add 50ml of 2e-4 M NaF to 50ml of something else, the F⁻ concentration is (2e-4 * 0.05 L) / 0.1 L. 2e-4 * 0.05 is 1e-5, divided by 0.1 is 1e-4 M. So [F⁻] is 1e-4 M.

So now, Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = (2.5e-4) * (1e-4)^2.

Let me compute that. (1e-4)^2 is 1e-8. Multiply by 2.5e-4: 2.5e-4 * 1e-8 = 2.5e-12.

Now compare to Ksp. Ksp is 1.7e-10, which is higher than 2.5e-12.

Wait, so Ksp is bigger than the product. That means the solution is supersaturated, so precipitation will occur. Because when Q (the reaction quotient) is greater than Ksp, the solution can't hold that much product, so precipitation occurs.

So precipitation will happen. So looking at the options:

Option C says precipitation will occur. Option B says only under high pressure, which isn't applicable here. Option D says it shouldn't occur. Option A says the solution is saturated. But since Ksp is higher, no, it's not saturated. So C is correct. 

Wait, another way: the product [Ca][F]^2 is 2.5e-4 * (1e-4)^2 = 2.5e-12. Compare to Ksp 1.7e-10. Since 2.5e-12 <1.7e-10, the solution is undersaturated. So excess ions can precipitate. So precipitation happens, so answer C.

To determine if precipitation occurs when 50 mL of 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ M Ca(NO₃)₂ and 50 mL of 2.0 × 10⁻⁴ M NaF are mixed, we analyze the reaction:

**Reaction:**  
Ca(NO₃)₂ + 2 NaF → CaF₂(s) + 2 NaNO₃  

The solubility product is given as **Ksp = 1.7 × 10⁻¹⁰**. For CaF₂, the dissociation is:  
CaF₂ ↔ Ca²⁺ + 2 F⁻  

The equilibrium expression is:  
**Ksp = [Ca²⁺][F⁻]²**

After mixing, the total volume is 100 mL, so the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and F⁻ are halved from their original concentrations in the respective solutions:

- **Initial concentration of Ca(NO₃)₂ in 50 mL:** 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ M  
  After dilution to 100 mL:  
  [Ca²⁺] = (5.0 × 10⁻⁴) × (50/100) = 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ M  

- **Initial concentration of NaF in 50 mL:** 2.0 × 10⁻⁴ M  
  After dilution to 100 mL:  
  [F⁻] = (2.0 × 10⁻⁴) × (50/100) = 1.0 × 10⁻⁴ M  

Next, calculate the reaction quotient **Q** using the formula:  
**Q = [Ca²⁺][F⁻]²**

Substitute the values:  
**Q = (2.5 × 10⁻⁴)(1.0 × 10⁻⁴)² = (2.5 × 10⁻⁴)(1.0 × 10⁻⁸) = 2.5 × 10⁻¹²**

Compare **Q** to **Ksp**:  
- **Q = 2.5 × 10⁻¹²**  
- **Ksp = 1.7 × 10⁻¹⁰**

Since **Q < Ksp**, the solution is undersaturated, and precipitation will occur. 

**Analysis of options:**
- **A: The mixture is saturated** – Incorrect, as Q < Ksp, so the solution is not saturated.
- **B: Precipitation will occur only under high-pressure conditions** – Incorrect, precipitation does not depend on pressure.
- **C: Precipitation will occur** – Correct, as Q < Ksp and precipitation is possible.
- **D: Precipitation should NOT occur** – Incorrect, precipitation occurs.
- **E: Precipitation will occur instantaneously** – Incorrect, precipitation occurs only after the solution reaches equilibrium.
- **F: Cannot determine without further information** – Incorrect, the concentrations and Q are known, so precipitation can be determined.
