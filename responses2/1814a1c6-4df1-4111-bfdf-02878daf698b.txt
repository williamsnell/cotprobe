Question:

In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
C: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.
D: the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.

Okay, so I have this real property law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is that a landowner owns a dairy farm and conveys it to his son in 1938. The son then conveys it to his friend in 1957, but that deed wasn't recorded until after the son's death in 1957. Then, the son mortgaged the farm to the bank in 1956, but the mortgage was recorded in 1956 as a subordinated mortgage to another mortgage from 1936. There's also a friend who takes it to a farmer in 2008, with a deed that's a general warranty deed, not mentioning any mortgage.

Now, the question is about the covenant against encumbrances. The buyer had a claim against the son's 1936 mortgage, which wasn't satisfied. They're suing for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. The question is whether the covenant allows the buyer to claim damages if the covenant is breached.

I remember that covenants of title are agreements that the grantee (the owner of the property) has made, and they are typically enforceable against the covenantee (the other party in the deed). So, the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property isn't encumbered by outstanding rights or interests. But wait, the covenant is designed to prevent the covenantee from being at risk of encumbrances because the grantor (the grantee) is a party to the agreement.

So in this case, the buyer is the covenantee because they conveyed the property. The covenant is created when the son conveyed the property in 1938. So, the covenant is a promise to not encumbrances. If the son's mortgage is breached, the covenant would be breached.

Now, the covenant is a general warranty, which means it's a covenant that is enforceable under the law but requires some effort from the grantee to maintain. So, if the covenant is breached, the grantee has an implied right to recover damages. The question is whether the covenant allows the buyer to claim the $75k in damages.

Wait, but the options suggest whether the buyer or the farmer is the one liable. The buyer learned about the son's mortgage in 1956 and seeks damages. So, if the covenant is breached, the buyer should be able to claim damages.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the structure of covenants. The covenant against encumbrances is a covenant that the grantee (the owner) has to keep the property free of encumbrances. If the grantee breaches this covenant, the covenantee (other party) might have an option to sue for damages.

Wait, but in real property, generally, covenants are enforceable against the covenantee. So, if the covenant is breached, the covenantee (the other party) can sue and get damages. So, in this case, the buyer is the covenantee. So the buyer would have the right to claim.

But wait, another angle: the covenant is a general warranty. So, it's not a promise that's unalterable, but it's a promise that can be breached, and the grantee (buyer) has a right to recovery.

So, the correct answer would be option B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think: the covenant is a covenant of the right to convey, which is a general warranty. So, the covenant is a performance obligation. If the covenant is breached, the grantee (buyer) is entitled to recovery.

Alternatively, the covenant against encumbrances is a covenant that the grantee (buyer) has a right to maintain, so if it's breached, the covenantee can recover.

So, looking at the options:

Option A says the buyer is liable because the covenant is a guarantee. That sounds correct.

Option B says the covenant would breach at delivery, giving the covenantee. That also sounds correct.

Wait, but let's think about the timing. The covenant (against encumbrances) is created when the son conveyed the property. So, the covenant is a future performance obligation. If the covenant is breached, the buyer (as covenantee) can sue.

So, both A and B seem correct. But let me double-check.

Wait, the covenant is (1) covenant for seisin, (2) right to convey, and (3) against encumbrances. The right to convey is a general warranty. So, the covenant is a performance obligation. If a party breaches it, then the other party can sue.

So, when the buyer (covenantee) learns of the breach, he can sue for damages. So, the covenant against encumbrances would be breached, allowing the buyer's claim.

So the correct answer is option B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.

Wait, but let me think again. The covenant against encumbrances is a covenant that the grantee (buyer) has a right to maintain. If the covenant is breached, the covenantee (the other party) can sue. So, the cause of action is against the covenantee.

So, the buyer is the covenantee, so they have a right to sue.

So, the correct answer would be B.

The question revolves around the covenant against encumbrances and its enforceability in a real property transaction. The son conveyed the dairy farm to his son in 1938, and the son mortgaged the property to his friend in 1956, creating a covenant against encumbrances. The buyer sought damages for breaching this covenant. 

The covenant against encumbrances is a performance obligation created in 1938, a future performance promise. If breached, the covenant is unenforceable, and the covenantee (the other party in the deed) has a right to recover damages. The buyer, as the covenantee, can sue for breach of the covenant, as this covenant is enforceable against others.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct, as the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
- **Option B**: Correct, as the covenant is breached at the delivery of the deed, and the covenantee (buyer) is entitled to recover damages.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as the covenant against encumbrances is not only breached but also must be enforced against others, not just at conveyance.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the covenant against encumbrances does not require the covenantee to disturb his actual enjoyment of the land.

The buyer is the covenantee and is entitled to recover damages for breaching the covenant against encumbrances.
