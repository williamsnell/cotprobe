Okay, I need to find the shortest distance from the origin to the given circle. The equation is x² -24x + y² +10y +160 =0. Hmm, I remember that to find the center and radius of a circle from its equation, I need to complete the squares for both x and y terms.

First, let me rearrange the equation to group x terms and y terms together. So, the equation becomes x² -24x + y² +10y = -160. Now, I'll complete the square for x and y.

For the x terms: The coefficient of x is -24. Half of -24 is -12, and squaring that gives 144. So I add 144 to both sides.

For the y terms: The coefficient of y is 10. Half is 5, and squaring gives 25. So I add 25 to both sides.

Adding these to both sides: (x² -24x +144) + (y² +10y +25) = -160 +144 +25. Let me calculate the right side: 144 +25 is 169, and 169 -160 is 9. So the equation becomes (x -12)² + (y +5)² = 9. 

Wait, so the circle has center at (12, -5) and radius √9 which is 3. Now, to find the shortest distance from the origin (0,0) to this circle, I think I need to find the distance from the origin to the center and then subtract the radius.

The distance from (0,0) to (12, -5) is sqrt[(12)^2 + (-5)^2] = sqrt(144 +25) = sqrt(169) =13. So the origin is 13 units away from the center. Since the radius is 3, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle should be 13 -3 =10 units.

Looking at the options, 10 is option I.

The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is found by calculating the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtracting the radius. The center is at (12, -5) with radius 3, so the distance from the origin is 13, and subtracting the radius gives 10.
