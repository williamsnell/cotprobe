Okay, so I've got this question about Mrs. Valdez and her bonds. Hmm, let me read it again. She owns six 9(1/8)% coupon bonds, each with a par value of $500. On the date of annual interest, she clips the coupons and presents them to her bank. I need to find out how much she receives. The options are A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Wait, let's break this down. Coupon bonds pay interest periodically. Since it's an annual interest payment, each bond will give her a fixed amount every year. The coupon rate is 9 and 1/8 percent, which is 9.125%. The par value is $500. So, the annual interest per bond is 9.125% of $500.

Let me calculate that. 9.125% is the same as 9.125/100, so 0.09125. Multiply that by 500: 0.09125 * 500 = let's see, 0.09*500 is 45, and 0.00125*500 is 0.625. So adding up, 45 + 0.625 = 45.625 per bond. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing that correctly. Alternatively, I can think of 9% of 500 is $45, and 0.125% of 500 is $0.625. So total is $45.625 per bond.

But wait, the question says she owns six of these bonds. So each bond gives 45.625, so six bonds would be 6 * 45.625. Let me compute that. 45.625 * 6. Let's break it down: 45 * 6 is 270, and 0.625 *6 is 3.75. Adding those gives 273.75. So total is $273.75.

Looking at the options, option A is $273.75. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Oh, the question says she clips the coupons. Wait, does that affect anything? I think when you "clip" the coupons, you're taking them out and giving them to the bank. So the bank receives the interest. So it's the same as if she had received it. So yes, the total is 6*45.625 = 273.75.

But wait, another thought: is the coupon rate based on par value? Yes, because in most bonds, the coupon is based on the par value. So 9.125% of $500 is correct.

So the answer should be A. Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A is 273.75, which matches my calculation. So I think the correct answer is A. Alternatively, sometimes in exams, there might be a trick, but in this case, it's straightforward. She's paying the interest, so the bank gets the interest. So answer is A.

The correct answer is A: $273.75. 

Step-by-step explanation: Each bond has a coupon rate of 9.125% on a $500 par value, which equals $45.625 per bond annually. With six bonds, the total annual interest is 6 * $45.625 = $273.75. 

Answer: A
