Question:

On Thursday, March 7, an owner's home was destroyed by fire. The owner's house was insured against such fire loss by an insurance company. According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.
B: inadmissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony is considered second-hand information.
C: admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.
D: inadmissible, because it is the responsibility of the owner, not the bookkeeper, to ensure the insurance company received the notice.
E: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.
F: admissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony provides proof of the owner's attempt to notify the insurance company.
G: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.
H: inadmissible, because the bookkeeper cannot confirm the contents of the envelope.
I: admissible, because the owner's statement is considered a verbal act.
J: admissible, because the bookkeeper is a credible witness.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about evidence law, specifically hearsay and admissibility of evidence. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that an owner's home was destroyed by fire on Thursday, March 7. The insurance company insured the home, and the owner sued them for $750,000. The insurance company admitted they didn't notice the fire and denied liability. The owner's bookkeeper testified that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope, told her it contained a notice, and she mailed it. The owner is arguing that the envelope contains the notice, so the owner's statement is admissible as evidence.

The options are A to J, each offering a different reason for the admissibility or inadmissibility of the bookkeeper's testimony.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay. Hearsay is statement made to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it must be original and not offered by another party. It must also not be admitted through any hearsay exception, like private property law, but here we're dealing with a business case.

The policy says the insured must notify the company within 10 days. The owner sued the insurance company, claiming they didn't give notice. The insurance company denied liability, admitted the home was insured for that amount, but didn't receive notice.

Now, the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is that he handed her an envelope with a notice. The owner is using this as evidence. Let's look at the options.

Option A says it's admissible because the owner's statement is non-hearsay. I think non-hearsay is about statements made to prove the truth of what's asserted. But the owner's statement was to admit the insurance, so is that hearsay? Wait, the insurance company didn't receive notice, so the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is saying he did receive notice, which the insurance company denied. So if the owner is saying they did receive it, that's hearsay because the insurance company didn't have it. But the bookkeeper is using the statement as evidence. But wait, the owner's statement is to prove that the insurance company had the notice, but if the company denied it, maybe the owner's statement is hearsay.

Wait, no, the problem is the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is being offered as evidence. If the owner is accusing the insurance company of not having notice, and the insurance company denies it, the owner's statement is a defense, but the bookkeeper is trying to prove the notice was there. So, the owner's statement is a defense, but the bookkeeper is using it to prove the company didn't have the notice.

Wait, but the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is a defense to liability, not to the notice. So the owner is claiming the company didn't have the notice, but the bookkeeper is trying to prove the notice was there.

So when the owner says he handed the envelope, the bookkeeper uses it as evidence. But this is a defense, so if the owner is using it for a defense, that doesn't make it admissible as evidence. The owner's statement is not hearsay because it's about the contents of the envelope, which is the bookkeeper's testimony. So the question is whether the owner's statement is hearsay.

Wait, no. The owner's statement is about the contents of an envelope, which is the bookkeeper's testimony. So when the owner says "the envelope contains a notice form," that's a statement made to prove the contents of the envelope, which is the bookkeeper's own statement. So this is a private statement, which is private property, so it's admissible under 42(a)(3) if it's a private property statement. So the owner's statement is private property, so it's admissible. So the owner's statement is non-hearsay because it's about the contents of a letter, not about the matter asserted.

Wait, but wait. The matter asserted is that the insurance company didn't have notice. But the owner's statement is about the contents of the envelope, which is probably a private statement. So the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is non-hearsay, so it's admissible.

Wait, but another point: the owner's statement is non-hearsay because it's about the contents of the envelope, which is the bookkeeper's statement. So the owner is using the bookkeeper's testimony as evidence, which is a private statement. So the owner's statement is a private statement, so it's admissible.

So looking at the options:

A: admissible because the owner's statement is non-hearsay. This seems correct because the owner is using the bookkeeper's testimony as evidence, which is a private statement. So the owner's statement is non-hearsay because it's about the contents of an envelope, which is the bookkeeper's statement. So this would make the owner's statement admissible. But wait, is the owner's statement a defense or a defense of the company's liability? Because the owner is claiming that the insurance company didn't receive notice. So if the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is being offered as evidence, but the owner is using it to prove that the company didn't have it, that would mean the owner is using it as a defense. But the issue is whether the owner's statement is hearsay or not.

Wait, no. The owner's statement is about the contents of the envelope, which is the bookkeeper's own statement. So it's a private statement. Therefore, it's admissible. So the owner's statement is non-hearsay because it's about the contents of an envelope, which is the bookkeeper's statement. Therefore, option A is correct because the owner's statement is non-hearsay and thus admissible.

Wait, but what about the 42(a)(3) rule? The owner is saying that the insurance company didn't receive notice. So the owner's statement is about the contents of the envelope, which is the bookkeeper's own statement. So the owner is using the bookkeeper's statement as evidence. Since it's about a private property statement, the owner's statement is admissible.

So the correct answer would be A: admissible because the owner's statement is non-hearsay.

Wait, but another thought: is the owner's statement a private statement? Because the contents of the envelope are a private property, so yes, the owner's statement is a private statement. So the owner's statement is admissible.

So the correct answer is A.

The owner's statement to the bookkeeper is non-hearsay because it is a private statement about the contents of an envelope, which is the bookkeeper's own statement. Therefore, the owner's statement is admissible under 42(a)(3) as a private property statement. This makes the owner's statement admissible evidence, so the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
