Okay, so I've got this gas volume problem here. Let me see, the question says a certain quantity of gas has a volume of 1200 cm³ at 27°C. I need to find its volume when the temperature increases to 127°C, and the pressure remains constant. Hmm, right, this sounds like Charles's Law. I remember that Charles's Law states that volume is directly proportional to temperature when pressure is held constant. 

Wait, but wait. What's the correct formula again? Oh right, it's V1/T1 = V2/T2, where T is in Kelvin. Oh, because the absolute temperature is needed. So I can't just use Celsius directly. I'll have to convert both temperatures to Kelvin.

Okay, let's start. The initial temperature is 27°C. To convert that to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 27 + 273.15 is 300.15 K. The final temperature is 127°C. Adding 273.15 to that gives 127 + 273.15 = 400.15 K. 

So V1 is 1200 cm³, T1 is 300.15 K, and T2 is 400.15 K. Now I plug into the formula: V2 = V1 * (T2 / T1). Let me compute that. 

So V2 = 1200 * (400.15 / 300.15). Let me calculate that ratio. 400.15 divided by 300.15 is approximately 1.333. Wait, 400 is about 1.333 times 300. So 1200 multiplied by 1.333. Hmm, 1200 * 1.333 is about 1200 * (4/3) which is 1600 cm³. 

Wait, but wait another thing, I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 400.15 / 300.15. Let's see: 300.15 * 1.333 is about 400.15 (since 300 * 1.333 is 400. So 400.15 / 300.15 is approximately 1.333333. So that part is correct. 

So V2 is 1200 * 1.333333. Let's compute 1200 * 1.3333. 1200 multiplied by 1 is 1200, 0.3333 is like a third. So 1200 * 0.3333 is approximately 400. So 1200 + 400 = 1600. So the new volume would be 1600 cm³. 

Looking at the options, option H is 1600. So the answer should be H. 

Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors I'm missing? Like, is there any gas expansion or something? No, the question just states the same amount of gas, so I don't think so. Also, since pressure is constant, it's a straightforward Charles's Law scenario. 

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is H: 1600 cm³.

To solve the problem, we use Charles's Law, which states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature when pressure is constant. The formula is:

\[
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
\]

where \( V_1 \) and \( T_1 \) are the initial volume and temperature, and \( V_2 \) and \( T_2 \) are the final volume and temperature, both in Kelvin.

1. **Convert temperatures to Kelvin**:  
   - Initial temperature: \( 27^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \)  
   - Final temperature: \( 127^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 400.15 \, \text{K} \)

2. **Apply Charles's Law**:  
   \[
   V_2 = V_1 \times \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1200 \, \text{cm}^3 \times \frac{400.15}{300.15}
   \]

3. **Calculate the ratio**:  
   \[
   \frac{400.15}{300.15} \approx 1.3333
   \]

4. **Compute the final volume**:  
   \[
   V_2 = 1200 \times 1.3333 \approx 1600 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

Thus, the volume of the gas at \( 127^\circ \text{C} \) is approximately \( 1600 \, \text{cm}^3 \).
