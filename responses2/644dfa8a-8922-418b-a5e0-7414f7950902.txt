Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electric fields, so I need to take it slow.

The question says that a charged cloud system produces an electric field near Earth's surface. There's a particle with a charge of -2.0 times 10^-9 coulombs. When this particle is placed in the field, it experiences a downward electrostatic force of 3.0e-6 Newtons. They're asking for the magnitude of the electric field.

Hmm, right, I remember that electric field (E) is related to the force (F) experienced by a charge (q) placed in it. Oh wait, the formula is E = F / q. But wait, I should double-check the signs here. Oh right, the direction matters. The force on a positive charge is in the same direction as the electric field. But our charge here is negative. So the force is opposite to the electric field direction.

But wait, the question is only about the magnitude of the electric field, not the direction. So I don't need to worry about the sign of the charge for the calculation.

So given:
q = -2.0e-9 C
F = 3.0e-6 N (downward)

Wait, the force is downward. Since the charge is negative, the electric field must be upward. Because F = qE, F is down, q is negative, so E must be opposite in direction. But for magnitude, it doesn't matter.

So calculating E: E = F / |q| because we're dealing with magnitude.

Plugging in the numbers: E = (3.0e-6 N) / (2.0e-9 C).

Wait, let me compute that. 3e-6 divided by 2e-9. Hmm. Let's do the exponents first. 3e-6 is 3 * 1e-6, and 2e-9 is 2 * 1e-9. So (3/2) * (1e-6 / 1e-9) → 1.5 * (1e3) → 1500 N/C.

Wait, so E is 1.5e3 N/C? Let me see the options. Looking at the options, option B is 1.5e3, option G is 0.5e3. So option B is 1.5e3, which matches.

Wait another thought: sometimes people get confused between electric field direction and force. For example, if the force is downward, and the charge is negative, the electric field is upward. But the magnitude is about the size, not the direction. So the calculation is correct.

So the answer should be 1.5e3 N/C. Checking the options, option B is 1.5×10^3 N/C. So that would be the correct choice.

To determine the magnitude of the electric field, we use the relationship \( E = \frac{F}{|q|} \), where \( F \) is the force experienced by the charge and \( q \) is the charge of the particle. 

Given:
- \( q = -2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} \) (magnitude is \( 2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} \))
- \( F = 3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{N} \)

The magnitude of the electric field is calculated as:
\[
E = \frac{F}{|q|} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{N}}{2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C}} = \frac{3.0}{2.0} \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{N/C} = 1.5 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{N/C}.
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the electric field is \( 1.5 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{N/C} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
