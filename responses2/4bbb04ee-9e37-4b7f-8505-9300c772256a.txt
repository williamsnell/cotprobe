Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the stopping potential when light of a certain wavelength hits lithium. Hmm, I remember that stopping potential has to do with the photoelectric effect, right? Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the wavelength is 400 nm, and the work function (phi) of lithium is 2.93 eV. I need to calculate the stopping potential V. Oh wait, the stopping potential is the voltage needed to stop the most energetic electrons from hitting a metal surface. So the formula I think is the energy of the incident photon minus the work function equals the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons, which is eV. Or I remember it as E_photon = phi + eV? Wait, wait. Let me get this right.

The photoelectric equation is E_photon = phi + K_e, where K_e is the maximum kinetic energy. But since we're dealing with stopping potential, which is the voltage needed to stop the electrons, the stopping potential V is such that eV = K_e. So combining these, E_photon = phi + eV => V = (E_photon - phi)/e. But wait, wait, e is the charge, so when you convert eV into Joules, you'd have to remember that, but since everything is in eV, maybe I can directly compute it in electron volts. 

The energy of the photon is given by E = hc/lambda. Oh right, h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, lambda is wavelength. But wait, sometimes people use the equation E = (1240 eV路nm)/lambda, since hc is approximately 1240 eV路nm. So for lambda=400 nm, E = 1240 /400 = 3.1 eV. Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that: 1240 divided by 400. 400 times 3 is 1200, so 1240 is 3.1 times 400. So E_photon is 3.1 eV.

Wait, but the work function is 2.93 eV. So according to the photoelectric equation, the stopping potential V is (E_photon - phi)/e. Since e is 1 eV per volt, because 1 eV is 1 eV of energy. So V = (3.1 - 2.93) eV. Let me calculate that: 3.1 minus 2.93 is 0.17. So V is 0.17 volts. 

Looking at the options, option H is 0.17. So the answer should be H. That's option H. Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. 400 nm is 400 times 1e-9 meters. hc is 1240 eV路nm, so 1240 divided by 400 is 3.1 eV. Correct. 3.1 minus 2.93 is 0.17. Yep. So the stopping potential is 0.17 V. So the correct answer is H.

To calculate the stopping potential \( V \) when light of wavelength \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} \) is incident upon lithium with a work function \( \phi = 2.93 \, \text{eV} \), we use the photoelectric equation:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \phi + eV
\]

Rearranging for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{E_{\text{photon}} - \phi}{e}
\]

The energy of the photon is given by \( E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV路nm}}{\lambda} \). Substituting \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1240}{400} = 3.1 \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, substituting \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3.1 \, \text{eV} \) and \( \phi = 2.93 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
V = \frac{3.1 - 2.93}{1} = 0.17 \, \text{V}
\]

Thus, the stopping potential is \( 0.17 \, \text{V} \), which corresponds to option H.
