Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking about an appeal to beliefs, also known as a fallacy. Let me think about each option and what I know about them.

Option A: Ad nauseam. I remember that's a type of argument that repeats the same point over and over again, making it seem absurd. It's more of a rhetorical device, not a logical fallacy. So probably not A.

Option B: Appeal to tradition. This is a logical fallacy where someone tries to prove something by referencing the work of a historical figure or a traditional example. Like, saying a person was good because of their grandfather's noble qualities. That makes sense, so B could be the answer.

Option C: Solid slope. I think this is a term used in rhetoric, referring to a persuasive argument that relies on a chain of reasoning leading to a conclusion. It's a form of argumentation, not a specific type of fallacy. So maybe C is a type of argument, but not a fallacy named after a concept.

Option D: Self evident truths. These are propositions that are obvious or self-explanatory, like "The sky is blue." They don't require proof and aren't considered fallacies. So D is not the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The question is asking for an appeal to beliefs, which is a type of logical fallacy. So the fallacy in question is appeal to tradition, which is option B. Because in the classic example, people might say a historical figure was a good role model, so the person in question should be as well. That's a common way people use appeal to tradition as a fallacy, making B the correct answer.
