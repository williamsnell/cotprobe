Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the doctrine of 'margin of appreciation' as applied by the European Court of Human Rights. I'm a bit rusty on my international law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking which case was the first to define the meaning of the doctrine of margin of appreciation as applied by the European Court of Human Rights. The options are a bunch of different legal cases from the UK and other nations.

Wait, the doctrine of margin of appreciation... I remember hearing something about the EU's interpretation of the principle in their legal documents. Let me think. The EU's fundamental principle of the margin of appreciation is a key aspect of their international trade law. It's about the right to import goods and the right to export. The EU's case, I think, was significant in defining how this principle applies.

Oh right, I think the first such case was in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) case. Let me recall the names. One of the options is Marckx v Belgium (1979). Marckx was a prominent Belgian lawyer who was involved in the EU's case. Was he involved with defining the margin of appreciation?

I remember reading that Marckx was part of the trial that led to the decision in the ECJ's case. Specifically, in that case, the court decided that the margin of appreciation was a right to be exercised, and it had a specific meaning. So, the case that first defined it would be Marckx v Belgium.

Looking at the options, option B is Marckx v Belgium (1979). So the answer should be B.

The case that first defined the margin of appreciation as applied by the European Court of Human Rights was Marckx v Belgium (1979). This case was significant as it contributed to the understanding of the EU's interpretation of the margin of appreciation, a key principle in their international trade law.

Answer: B
