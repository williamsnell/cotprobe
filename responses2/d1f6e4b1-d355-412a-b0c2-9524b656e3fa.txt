Question:

Which of the following principles is NOT part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection?

Options:

A: Evolution does not occur within an individual's lifespan.
B: Natural selection favors traits that are beneficial for survival.
C: Evolution occurs in response to changes in the environment.
D: Every population has tremendous variation.
E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on to their offspring.
F: Survival of the fittest ensures that only the strongest survive.
G: Evolution is a gradual process that occurs over a long period of time.
H: Every species has the potential to evolve.
I: Organisms will overpopulate area, giving rise to competition.
J: Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which principle is NOT part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that Darwin's theory focuses on how species change and adapt over time. Let me think through each option.

Option A: Evolution does not occur within an individual's lifespan. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think natural selection acts continuously over generations, so evolution definitely happens within the lifespan. So A is probably incorrect, meaning it's not a principle of evolution.

Option B: Natural selection favors traits beneficial for survival. Yeah, that's definitely part of natural selection. So B is correct.

Option C: Evolution responds to environmental changes. That makes sense. Natural selection is about adapting to the environment, so C is correct.

Option D: Every population has variation. I remember that variation is a key part of evolution. The more variation, the more selection pressure, leading to evolution. So D is correct.

Option E: Species develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. Natural selection allows this because species evolve by passing on advantageous traits. So E is correct.

Option F: Survival of the fittest. Oh, wait, that's a key point. The fittest individuals survive, so F is a correct principle.

Option G: Evolution is gradual and long-term. That's exactly what Darwin described; evolution is slow and takes time. So G is correct.

Option H: Every species can evolve. I think so. Because each species has its own way of adapting, so H is correct.

Option I: Overpopulation causes competition. I'm not sure about this. Overpopulation leads to competition, which could lead to evolution, but I thought evolution isn't solely about competition. Maybe I'm mixing it up with other models like the competitive exclusion principle. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe I should think more.

Option J: Mutations are the main source of variation. I remember that mutations provide the raw material for variation, and natural selection acts on them. So J is correct.

So the incorrect one is option A. Because evolution does occur within an individual's lifespan. Oh wait, the question says which is NOT part of Darwin's theory. So the answer is A.

The correct answer is A: Evolution does not occur within an individual's lifespan.
