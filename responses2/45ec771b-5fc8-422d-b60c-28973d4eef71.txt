Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 2x³ + e^x = 10. The question is asking me to use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root, and then choose the correct answer from the given options. Hmm, I remember that Newton-Raphson is an iterative method for finding roots of equations, right? So I'll need to set this up.

First, I think I should express the equation in the form f(x) = 0. So, subtracting 10 from both sides, f(x) = 2x³ + e^x - 10. I'll need to find x such that f(x) = 0.

Now, Newton-Raphson formula is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). So I need to compute the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x) = 6x² + e^x. That makes sense because the derivative of 2x³ is 6x² and the derivative of e^x is e^x.

So the iterative formula becomes x_{n+1} = x_n - (2x_n³ + e^{x_n} - 10) / (6x_n² + e^{x_n}).

I need to choose an initial guess, x₀. Let's see the options are between 0.75 and 3.67. Maybe I can pick a middle value, like 2.5, but I'm not sure if that's near the root. Alternatively, since all the options are positive, maybe the root is somewhere in the positive region.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me test f(2) first. f(2) = 2*(8) + e² -10. e² is about 7.389. So 16 +7.389 =23.389 -10 = 13.389 which is positive. So f(2) is positive.

f(1): 2*(1) + e^1 -10 =2 + 2.718 -10 = 4.718 -10= -5.282. So f(1) is negative. Since f(1) is negative and f(2) is positive, the root must be between 1 and 2. So the options given are 0.75, 1.42, 2.89, etc. So 1.42 is in the lower range.

Wait, but what about the options? Let's list them:

A:3.14

B:2.05

C:2.89

D:-1.23

E:2.56

F:1.42

G:0.98

H:0.75

I:1.85

J:3.67

So the positive options are B, C, E, F, G, I, J. Wait, but f(1.42) is positive? Let me check f(1.42). Let's compute 2*(1.42)^3 + e^{1.42} and see if it's 10.

Wait, let me calculate f(1.42):

1.42³ = (1.42)*(1.42)*(1.42). 1.42 squared is about 2.0164. Multiply by 1.42: 2.0164 * 1.42 ≈ 2.8643. So 2*x³ is 2*2.8643 ≈5.7286.

e^1.42: I think e^1 is 2.718, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.42 is approximately 4.135 (maybe a bit higher? Let's say 4.14).

So adding 5.7286 +4.14 ≈9.8686. Subtract 10, f(1.42) ≈ -0.1314. So f(1.42) is negative, because 9.8686 is less than 10. Wait, but f(2) is 2*8=16 + e²≈7.389, so 16+7.389=23.389 -10 =13.389. So f(1.42) is negative, f(2) positive. So the root is between 1.42 and 2. But wait, all the options are higher than 1.42? The options include 1.42, F:1.42, G:0.98, H:0.75, I:1.85, J:3.67. So the root is likely in the options, but perhaps the initial guess is 1.42.

Wait, but the options F is 1.42. So let's test f(1.42) as I did before, it's approximately -0.1314. So f(1.42) is negative. Then f(2) is positive. So the root is between 1.42 and 2. So the correct answer would be a value in that interval.

Looking at the options, the positive ones are B:2.05, C:2.89, E:2.56, F:1.42. Wait, F is 1.42. So let's see if the root is around 1.42. But wait, wait. The options have F as 1.42, which is the same as my initial point. So if I start at x=1.42, f(x) is negative. The next iteration would be x = x - f(x)/f'(x).

Wait, but maybe the correct root is around 1.85 or 2.56. Let me think about the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should pick a better initial guess. Maybe 1.5 is a better starting point. Let's calculate f(1.5):

1.5³ is 3.375. 2*3.375=6.75. e^1.5 is about 4.4817. So 6.75 +4.4817=11.2317. Subtract 10, f(1.5)=1.2317, which is positive.

So f(1.42) is negative, f(1.5) is positive. So the root is between 1.42 and 1.5.

So let's compute f(1.45) to see where it lies.

f(1.45) = 2*(1.45)^3 + e^1.45 -10.

1.45^3: 1.45 *1.45=2.1025. Multiply by 1.45: 2.1025 *1.45. Let's calculate that. 2 *1.45=2.9, 0.1025 *1.45=0.149625. So total is 3.049625. 2 * that is 6.09925.

e^1.45: e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^0.05 is about 1.0513. So e^1.45 ≈4.055 *1.0513 ≈4.263. So f(1.45) ≈6.09925 +4.263 -10 =10.36225 -10=0.36225. Positive.

f(1.42) ≈-0.1314, f(1.45)=~0.362. So root is between 1.42 and 1.45.

Let me compute f(1.43):

1.43^3 is 1.43 *1.43=2.0449. Multiply by 1.43: 2.0449 *1.43 ≈ let's compute 2*1.43=2.86, 0.0449*1.43≈0.0647. Total ≈2.9247. 2* that is 5.8494.

e^1.43: e^1.42 is about 4.135 (as before), e^0.01 is about 1.01005. So e^1.43 ≈4.135 *1.01005≈4.176. So f(1.43)=5.8494 +4.176 -10≈10.0254 -10=0.0254. So f(1.43)≈0.0254.

f(1.42)= -0.1314, so f(1.42) is negative, f(1.43) is positive. So root is between 1.42 and 1.43.

But wait, the options don't have 1.43. The closest is F (1.42) and I (1.85), etc. So if the initial guess is 1.42, but it's negative. The next iteration would be x1 = 1.42 - (-0.1314)/(f’(1.42)).

What is f’(1.42)? f'(x)=6x² +e^x. So 6*(1.42)^2 + e^1.42.

1.42^2 is about 2.0164. So 6*2.0164=12.0984. e^1.42 is approx 4.135. So f’(1.42)≈12.0984 +4.135≈16.2334.

So x1 = 1.42 - (-0.1314)/16.2334 ≈1.42 +0.0081=1.4281.

So the next guess is 1.4281. Let's compute f(1.4281):

x=1.4281.

x³= (1.4281)^3. Let's compute that.

First, 1.4281 *1.4281 = Let's approximate. 1.4^2 is 1.96, 0.0281^2 is negligible. The cross term is 2*(1.4)(0.0281)=0.07892. So (1.4+0.0281)^2≈1.96 +0.07892=2.03892. Then multiply by 1.4281:

2.03892 *1.4281 ≈ let's compute 2 *1.4281=2.8562, 0.03892 *1.4281≈~0.0555. So total ≈2.9117. So 2* that is 5.8234.

e^1.4281: Let's approximate. e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^0.0281≈1.0285 (since e^0.03 is approximately 1.03045). So e^1.4281≈4.055 *1.0285≈4.168.

So f(x)=5.8234 +4.168 -10=9.9914 -10≈-0.0086. So f(1.4281)=approx -0.0086.

Hmm, very close to zero. The derivative at x=1.4281 is f'(x)=6x² +e^x. x=1.4281, x²≈2.0389. So 6*2.0389≈12.2334. e^x≈4.168. So f’(x)=12.2334+4.168≈16.4014.

So x1=1.4281 - (-0.0086)/16.4014 ≈1.4281 + 0.000523=1.4286.

So x2=1.4286.

Compute f(1.4286):

x³= (1.4286)^3. Let's compute 1.4286^3.

We can compute (1.4286)^2 first: 1.4286 *1.4286. Let's approximate.

Let me compute 1.4286 * 1.4286:

1.4286^2 = (approx) (1.4)^2 + 2*(1.4)*(0.0286) + (0.0286)^2.

1.4^2=1.96.

2*(1.4)*(0.0286)= 2.8 *0.0286=0.08008.

(0.0286)^2≈0.000818.

So total ≈1.96 +0.08008 +0.000818=2.0409. So 1.4286^2≈2.0409.

Multiply by 1.4286: 2.0409 *1.4286. Let's compute:

2 *1.4286=2.8572.

0.0409 *1.4286≈approx 0.0583 (since 0.04 *1.4286=0.057144, 0.0009 *1.4286≈0.001286; sum≈0.05843).

So total x³≈2.8572 +0.05843=2.91563.

2x³≈5.83126.

e^1.4286: e^1.4281 was 4.168. Let's compute the change. The difference from 1.4281 to 1.4286 is 0.0005. The derivative of e^x is e^x, which is approximately 4.168 at x=1.4281. So for a small delta x=0.0005, e^x increases by about 4.168 *0.0005≈0.002084. So e^1.4286≈4.168 +0.002084≈4.170084.

So f(x)=5.83126 +4.170084 -10≈9.991344 -10≈-0.008656.

So f(x2)≈-0.008656, which is very close to zero. So the root is around 1.4286. The options don't have this value. The options are F:1.42, which is close.

Wait, but the options don't include 1.4286. The closest is F:1.42. So perhaps the correct answer is F? But wait, f(1.42) is negative, which is the initial point. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the Newton-Raphson method with proper initial guess would converge to a different root. Let me think about the function again.

Wait, the function f(x) =2x³ +e^x -10. At x=1.42, f is negative; at x=2, it's positive. So the root is between 1.42 and 2. But the options don't have any number higher than 2 except J:3.67. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps the options are different.

Wait, but the options are given, and F is 1.42. Another possibility is that the question is about the root between 0 and 2. But the options include numbers like 0.98, which is lower than 1.42. Let me check f(0.98):

f(0.98) =2*(0.98)^3 + e^0.98 -10.

0.98^3=0.98*0.98*0.98= 0.941192.

2*0.941192=1.882384.

e^0.98: e^1 is 2.718, e^0.9 is about 2.4596, e^0.98 is a bit higher. Let me compute e^0.98.

We can approximate using Taylor series around a point. Let's take a=0.98, but that may not help. Alternatively, using e^0.98 = e^(1 - 0.02) = e^1 * e^(-0.02) ≈2.718 * (1 -0.02 +0.0002) ) ≈2.718 *0.9798≈2.665.

Wait, but exact value: e^0.98 = e^(0.98) ≈2.6651 (I think that's a known approximate value). Let's take it as 2.6651.

So f(0.98)=1.882384 +2.6651 -10=4.5475 -10= -5.4525. So f(0.98) is negative.

Wait, then how? Because f(0.98) is -5.45, f(1.42) is -0.13, both negative. So perhaps the root is higher than 1.42, which is why I thought it's around 1.85 or 2.56.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider another initial guess. Let me pick x=1.85.

f(1.85) =2*(1.85)^3 + e^1.85 -10.

Calculate 1.85^3: 1.85 *1.85=3.4225. Multiply by 1.85: 3.4225 *1.85.

Let me compute 3 *1.85=5.55, 0.4225 *1.85=？

0.4 *1.85=0.74; 0.0225 *1.85≈0.0416. So total 0.74+0.0416=0.7816. So 3.4225 *1.85≈5.55 +0.7816=6.3316. So 2*6.3316=12.6632.

e^1.85: e^1.8 is about 6.05 (since e^1.8=approx 6.05), e^1.85= e^1.8 * e^0.05. e^0.05≈1.05127. So 6.05 *1.05127≈6.334. So f(1.85)=12.6632+6.334 -10≈18.997 -10≈8.997. Positive.

So f(1.85)=~9.0. So f(1.85)=9.0, which is positive. So between x=1.42 and x=1.85, f goes from negative to positive. So the root is between 1.42 and 1.85.

Wait, but the options don't include any number between 1.42 and 1.85 except F:1.42, which is negative.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F:1.42, but that's the initial point, not the root. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should pick a different initial guess. Let's try x=1.5.

f(1.5)=2*(3.375)+4.4817 -10 =6.75 +4.4817=11.2317 -10=1.2317. Positive.

So initial guess at x=1.5 is positive. So the root is between 1.42 and 1.5.

Wait, but the options don't include a number between 1.42 and 1.5 except F:1.42.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think which of the options is closer to the root.

Wait, the options are:

A:0.75

B:2.05

C:2.89

D:-1.23

E:2.56

F:1.42

G:0.98

H:0.75

I:1.85

J:3.67

So, the options are 0.75, 1.42, 2.05, 2.56, 3.67. The root is between 1.42 and 2.56. The closest option is I:1.85, which is higher than 1.42 and the midpoint of 1.42 and 2.56.

Wait, maybe the correct root is 1.85. Let me test f(1.85).

f(1.85) =2*(1.85)^3 + e^1.85 -10.

Compute 1.85^3. As earlier, 1.85^3=6.3316. So 2*6.3316=12.6632.

e^1.85: Let's compute it more accurately. Since e^1.8 is approximately 6.05, e^1.85 =6.05 * e^0.05. e^0.05 is approximately 1.05127. So 6.05 *1.05127 =6.05 *1.05 =6.3525; 6.05 *0.00127=approx 0.00767. So total e^1.85≈6.3525 +0.00767≈6.36017.

So f(1.85)=12.6632 +6.36017 -10=19.02337 -10=9.02337. Positive.

So f(1.85)=9.02337>0. So the root is between 1.42 and 1.85.

Wait, but the options don't have any in that range except I:1.85.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I:1.85. Because the root is between 1.42 and 1.85.

Wait, but the options include I:1.85, which is the highest option. So perhaps the correct answer is F:1.42, but that's the initial point, not the root.

Wait, no. Wait, the options are A to J, so F is 1.42, but the correct root is between 1.42 and 1.85. So the correct answer is I:1.85.

Wait, but let's think again. Are there other options that are higher than 1.42 but less than 1.85? For example, 1.5,1.6, etc. But the options don't include any of these. So the closest higher option is I:1.85. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F:1.42, but that's not correct because f(1.42) is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. The options are:

A: 0.75

B: 2.05

C: 2.89

D: -1.23

E: 2.56

F: 1.42

G: 0.98

H: 0.75

I: 1.85

J: 3.67

So the options are 0.75, 1.42, 2.05, 2.56, 3.67. The root is between 1.42 and 2.56. So the closest options are I:1.85 and J:3.67. Since 1.85 is closer to the root than 3.67, I think the correct answer is I:1.85.

But wait, earlier when I did the Newton-Raphson iterations, I started with x=1.42 and got closer to the root around 1.4286. So the root is approximately 1.4286, which is the same as 1.42857. So the correct answer is F:1.42? No, because f(1.42) is negative. So perhaps the correct answer is I:1.85, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F:1.42, but the function is negative there. So perhaps the correct answer is I:1.85.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F:1.42, but it's not because f(1.42) is negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial guess.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different initial guess. Let me try x=1.85 again.

f(1.85)=2*(1.85)^3 + e^1.85 -10. As before, 1.85^3=6.3316, 2*6.3316=12.6632. e^1.85=6.36017. So f=12.6632+6.36017-10=19.02337-10=9.02337. Positive.

So the root is between 1.42 and 1.85.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I:1.85, and the other options are not correct. So the correct answer is I:1.85. Therefore, the correct option is I.
</think>

To solve the equation \( f(x) = 2x^3 + e^x - 10 = 0 \), we apply the Newton-Raphson method. The given options for the root are:

A: 0.75  
B: 2.05  
C: 2.89  
D: -1.23  
E: 2.56  
F: 1.42  
G: 0.98  
H: 0.75  
I: 1.85  
J: 3.67

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   The function is \( f(x) = 2x^3 + e^x - 10 \).  
   The derivative is \( f'(x) = 6x^2 + e^x \).

2. **Iteration Process**:  
   Using the Newton-Raphson formula:
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
   \]
   We start with an initial guess \( x_0 = 1.42 \) because \( f(1.42) \) is negative, and we expect the root to be higher than 1.42.

3. **First Iteration**:  
   Compute \( f(1.42) = -0.1314 \) and \( f'(1.42) = 16.283 \).  
   Update guess:  
   \[
   x_1 = 1.42 - \frac{-0.1314}{16.283} \approx 1.4286
   \]

4. **Second Iteration**:  
   Compute \( f(1.4286) \approx -0.0086 \) and \( f'(1.4286) \approx 16.401 \).  
   Update guess:  
   \[
   x_2 = 1.4286 - \frac{-0.0086}{16.401} \approx 1.4286
   \]

5. **Convergence**:  
   The iterations have converged to approximately \( x = 1.4286 \).

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The closest option to the root \( 1.4286 \) is **I: 1.85**. However, \( f(1.85) \) is positive, indicating that the root lies between 1.42 and 1.85. Since 1.42 is the closest lower option, but it's negative, the correct root is the next higher option, **I: 1.85**.

ANSWER: I
