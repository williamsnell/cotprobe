Okay, so I have this question about finding the Laplace transform of f(t) = sin(kt) for t > 0. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I remember that transforms involve integrals. Let me think, the formula for the Laplace transform of sin(kt) should be something specific.

Wait, I think the Laplace transform of sin(at) is a/(s² + a²). Oh right, because the Laplace transform formula for a function f(t) is F(s) = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) f(t) dt. So for sin(kt), I substitute a with kt, making it ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

Let me set up the integral. Let me call a = k. So F(s) = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt. I think integration by parts is the way to go here. Let me choose u and dv. Maybe let u = sin(kt), then du = k cos(kt) dt. And dv would be e^(-st) dt, which means v = -1/s e^(-st).

Applying integration by parts: uv|₀^∞ - ∫ v du. So uv is [ - sin(kt)/s e^(-st) ] from 0 to ∞. Let's evaluate that. As t approaches ∞, e^(-st) goes to zero if s is positive, so the first term is zero. At t=0, sin(0) is zero, so the whole expression is zero. So the first term is zero.

Now the second part is - ∫ v du. That's - ∫ (-1/s e^(-st)) * k cos(kt) dt. Simplify that: (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure about this. Maybe I should use a different approach. I remember there's a standard integral formula: ∫₀^∞ sin(kt) e^(-st) dt = k/(s² + k²), but I need to confirm.

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, I can use the table of Laplace transforms. From what I recall, the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s² +k²). So the correct answer should be option H? Let's look at the options.

Options are A: k/(s² +k²), B: k/(s² -k²), etc. So option A is the same as what I thought. But wait, wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Oh wait, sometimes the formula can vary based on the definition. Sometimes, depending on whether the transform includes a 1/(s) term or not. Wait, no, the standard Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s² +k²). So option A should be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option H is [k/(s^2 +k^2)], which is exactly that. So the correct answer should be option A. Hmm. But wait, is it? Oh wait another thing, sometimes people define the Laplace transform as L{f(t)} = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) f(t) dt, and for functions like e^{at} sin(bt), the transform is b/(s² + (a)^2) when a is negative. Oh wait, actually, the sign might matter. Wait, no, the formula I used earlier is correct because the integral is from 0 to infinity.

Wait, let me think again. Let me compute the integral for sin(kt). Let me set up the integral:

∫₀^∞ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

Let me consider using integration by parts twice and solving for the integral. Let me set u = sin(kt), dv = e^(-st) dt.

So du = k cos(kt) dt, and v = -1/s e^(-st). So integrating by parts:

uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du.

At t=∞: e^(-st) sin(kt) → 0 as e^(-st) goes to zero and sin is bounded.

At t=0: sin(0) =0, so uv is zero. So the first term is zero.

Then, we have - ∫ ( -1/s e^(-st) ) * k cos(kt) dt = (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Now, this new integral is (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt. Let me call this integral I. So I = (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Again, I can apply integration by parts. Let me set u = cos(kt), dv = e^(-st) dt.

Then du = -k sin(kt) dt, and v = -1/s e^(-st).

So integrating by parts again:

uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du.

At t=∞: e^(-st) cos(kt) → 0.

At t=0: cos(0) =1, so this term is (-1/s) *1 * e^0 = -1/s.

So the first term is [0 - (-1/s)] = 1/s.

The second term is - ∫ (-1/s e^(-st)) * (-k sin(kt) ) dt. Let me write that:

- ∫ (-1/s e^(-st)) * (-k sin(kt)) dt = - [ (1/s) * (-k) ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt ]

Wait, let me compute that step again. The integral is:

∫ v du = ∫ (-1/s e^(-st)) (-k sin(kt)) dt = (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

Which is (k/s) times our original integral I.

So, putting it all together:

I = (k/s) [ (1/s) - (k/s) I ]

Wait, no. Wait, the integration by parts for I gave:

The integral I is (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt = (k/s) [ (1/s) - (k/s) I ]

Wait, so I = (k/s) [ (1/s) - (k/s) I ]

Wait, that's I = (k/(s^2)) - (k^2/(s^2)) I.

So, bringing the (k^2/(s^2)) I term to the left:

I + (k^2/s^2) I = k/(s^2)

Factor I:

I (1 + k²/s²) ) = k/(s²)

So, I = [k/(s²)] / ( (s² + k²)/s² ) )

Wait, wait, the denominator is (1 + (k²/s²)) = (s² +k²)/s².

So I = [k/(s²)] * [s²/(s² +k²) ] = k/(s² +k²).

Wait, so the integral I is k/(s² +k²). But what was I? I was (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt, which equals (k/s) * [ 1/s - (k/s) I ]

Wait, no, I think I got confused. Let me retrace.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the algebra.

Let me start over. Let me denote the integral ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt as J.

So J = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Again, integration by parts.

u = cos(kt), du = -k sin(kt) dt.

dv = e^(-st) dt, v = -1/s e^(-st).

So J = [ -1/s e^(-st) cos(kt) ] from 0 to ∞ + (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

At t=∞, e^(-st) → 0, so first term is zero.

At t=0, cos(0) =1, so the first term is (-1/s) *1 * e^0 = -1/s.

So J = 0 - (-1/s) + (k/s) I = 1/s + (k/s) I.

Wait, because I is ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt, which is the original integral we wanted.

So J = 1/s + (k/s) I.

But J is ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Now, let's go back to the original integral I.

I = ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

We can perform integration by parts again on I.

Let u = sin(kt), du = k cos(kt) dt.

dv = e^(-st) dt, v = -1/s e^(-st).

So I = [ -1/s e^(-st) sin(kt) ] from 0 to ∞ + (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

The first term is [0 - ( -1/s ) * 0 ] = 0, because at t=0, sin(0)=0, and at t=∞, e^(-st) goes to zero.

So I = 0 + (k/s) J.

But J we've found is 1/s + (k/s) I.

So,

I = (k/s) [ (1/s) + (k/s) I ]

Multiply through:

I = (k/s)(1/s) + (k^2/s^2) I.

Bring the (k^2/s^2) I term to the left:

I - (k^2/s^2) I = k/(s^2).

Factor I:

I (1 - (k^2/s^2)) ) = k/(s^2).

So,

I = [k/(s^2)] / [ (s^2 - k^2)/s^2 ) ]

= [k/(s^2)] * [ s^2/(s² -k²) ) ]

= k/(s² -k²) * s² / s² → wait, no, wait: s² cancels.

So I = k/(s² -k²) * (1/(1)) ?

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, (s² -k²) is the denominator.

So,

I = [k/(s^2)] / [ (s² -k^2)/s^2 ) ]

Which is [k/(s^2)] * [ s^2/(s² -k²) ]

The s^2 cancels, so I = k/(s² -k^2). Wait no, because (1/s²) * (s²) is 1.

Wait, wait no:

Wait, [k/(s^2)] divided by [ (s² - k²)/s^2 ] → which is [k/(s^2)] * [ s^2/(s² -k²) ) ].

The s² cancels, so I = k/(s² -k²) ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because from the earlier steps, I think I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the final result again.

Wait, from the previous step:

I = (k/s) J.

And J = 1/s + (k/s) I.

So substituting J:

I = (k/s) [ 1/s + (k/s) I ]

= (k/s)(1/s) + (k^2/s^2) I.

I = k/(s^2) + (k²/s²) I.

Bring (k²/s²) I to the left:

I - (k²/s²) I = k/(s^2)

→ I (1 - k²/s²) = k/(s^2)

→ I = [k/(s^2)] / [ (s² - k²)/s² ]

= [k/(s^2)] * [ s^2/(s² -k^2) ]

= [k * s^2 ] / [ s^2 (s² -k^2) ) ]

s^2 cancels, so I = k/(s² -k^2).

Wait, but earlier I thought that the integral was k/(s² +k²). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should have used a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard integral formula.

Wait, another approach: the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s² +k²). So that's probably correct.

Looking back at the options, option A is k/(s² +k²), which matches this. So the correct answer should be option A.

But I'm a bit confused because when I did the integration by parts, I ended up with I = k/(s² -k^2), which is option F. But that can't be right, because that would be for cos(kt), but I was integrating sin(kt).

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the integral ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

Wait, another way to compute it is to note that the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s² + k²), which is correct.

But according to my integration by parts approach, I ended up with I = k/(s² -k^2), which is option F. So that can't be right, because the correct answer would be option A.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the integration by parts steps.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the integration by parts step for I.

I = ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

Let me try integrating by parts again, but perhaps I should choose u and dv differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use a standard formula without going through integration by parts, which might be faster.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different method. Let me recall that the integral of e^(-st) sin(kt) dt from 0 to ∞ is k/(s² + k^2).

So that would mean option A is correct.

So then why did my integration by parts lead me to a different result? Probably I messed up somewhere in the algebra.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs or the substitution.

Let me try to re-do the integration by parts steps.

I = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt

Let u = sin(kt), so du = k cos(kt) dt.

Let dv = e^(-st) dt, so v = -1/s e^(-st).

Apply integration by parts:

I = uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du.

So,

I = [ - sin(kt)/s e^(-st) ] from 0 to ∞ - ∫ [ -1/s e^(-st) ] * k cos(kt) dt.

Evaluate the first term:

As t approaches ∞: e^(-st) → 0, so term is 0.

At t=0: sin(0) = 0, so term is 0.

So the first part is zero.

Now the integral is: - [ -1/s ∫ e^(-st) k cos(kt) dt ] → (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

So,

I = (k/s) J, where J = ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Now compute J.

Let J = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Again, use integration by parts. Let u = cos(kt), du = -k sin(kt) dt.

dv = e^(-st) dt, v = -1/s e^(-st).

So J = uv | from 0 to ∞ + (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

Evaluating the first term:

At t=∞: e^(-st) → 0, so term is 0.

At t=0: cos(0) =1, so term is (-1/s) *1 → -1/s.

So J = 0 - (-1/s) + (k/s) I → J = 1/s + (k/s) I.

Now, substitute J back into I:

I = (k/s) J = (k/s) (1/s + (k/s) I )

Multiply out: I = (k/s)(1/s) + (k^2/s^2) I.

So,

I = k/(s^2) + (k^2/s^2) I.

Bring the (k^2/s^2) I term to the left side:

I - (k^2/s^2) I = k/(s^2)

Factor I:

I [1 - (k^2/s^2) ] = k/(s^2).

Hmm, let's compute 1 - (k^2/s^2) = (s^2 -k^2)/s^2.

So,

I = [k/(s^2) ] / [ (s^2 -k^2)/s^2 ) ]

= [k/(s^2)] * [ s^2/(s^2 -k^2) ) ]

= [k * s^2 ] / [ s^2 (s^2 -k^2) ) ]

s^2 cancels, so I = k/(s^2 -k^2).

Wait, that's the same result as before. But according to standard tables, the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s^2 +k^2), which is option A.

Hmm, but according to the integration by parts I did, I'm getting I = k/(s^2 -k^2), which isn't an option. So that must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration by parts steps. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs of the integration by parts formula.

Wait, the integration by parts formula is:

∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

So in the first integration, when I set u = sin(kt), du = k cos(kt) dt,

dv = e^(-st) dt → v = -1/s e^(-st).

So I = [ - sin(kt)/s e^(-st) ] evaluated from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du.

Wait,

I = [ - sin(kt) e^(-st)/s ] evaluated from 0 to ∞ → 0 -0 = 0.

Then, I = - ∫ v du = - ∫ [ -1/s e^(-st) ] * k cos(kt) dt.

Which is (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt = (k/s) J.

So I = (k/s) J.

Now, J = ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Again, let me integrate by parts. Let u = cos(kt), du = -k sin(kt) dt.

dv = e^(-st) dt → v = -1/s e^(-st).

So J = [ - cos(kt) e^(-st) / s ] evaluated from 0 to ∞ → 0 - ( -1/s *1 ) = 1/s.

Then, J = [ 1/s + (k/s) I ].

Wait, wait, no. J was computed as:

J = [ - cos(kt) e^(-st) / s ] from 0 to ∞ → 0 - [ -1/s *1 ] → 1/s.

Then, J = [1/s + (k/s) I ].

So J = 1/s + (k/s) I.

So from I = (k/s) J,

I = (k/s) (1/s + (k/s) I )

= (k/s) * 1/s + (k/s) * (k/s) I

= k/(s^2) + (k^2/s^2) I.

Bring the (k^2/s^2) I term to the left:

I - (k^2/s^2) I = k/(s^2 )

Factor I:

I (1 - (k^2/s^2 )) = k/(s^2 )

→ I = k/(s^2) / [ (s^2 -k^2)/s^2 ) ]

= [ k/(s^2) ] * [ s^2/(s^2 -k^2) ) ]

= k/(s^2 -k^2 )

Wait, so I = k/(s^2 -k^2 ), which is option F.

But I thought the correct answer was option A.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about it again.

Wait, the standard Laplace transform for sin(kt) is k/(s^2 +k^2 ), which is option A.

But according to my integration by parts, I'm getting I = k/(s^2 -k^2 ), which is option F.

So there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another method. Let me think about the properties of the Laplace transform.

I know that the Laplace transform of e^(at) sin(bt) is [b/( (a)^2 + (b)^2 ) ] / (s -a) )

Wait, but that's for a >0. So when a is negative, that would change.

Wait, let's suppose 'a' is negative. So, in the case of e^(-st) sin(kt), we're looking for the Laplace transform of sin(kt) multiplied by e^(-st), where s is in the standard variable.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the Laplace transform of sin(kt) multiplied by e^(-st}, where s is a complex variable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just recall that the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s^2 +k^2 ), which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But according to my integration by parts, I'm getting k/(s^2 -k^2 ), which is option F. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration by parts.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when I did the integration by parts for I, I made a mistake in bringing the terms together.

Let me try again.

I = (k/s) J.

J = 1/s + (k/s) I.

So,

I = (k/s) (1/s + (k/s) I )

= (k/s)(1/s) + (k^2/s^2) I.

So,

I = k/(s^2) + (k^2/s^2) I.

Bring (k^2/s^2) I to the left:

I - (k^2/s^2) I = k/(s^2 )

Factor I:

I [ 1 - (k^2/s^2) ) ] = k/(s^2 )

→ I = [k/(s^2)] / [ (s^2 -k^2)/s^2 ) ]

= [k/(s^2)] * [ s^2/(s^2 -k^2) ) ]

= k/(s^2 -k^2 )

Which brings me back to I = k/(s^2 -k^2 ), which is option F.

But this contradicts the standard Laplace transform formula for sin(kt), which is option A.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the integration steps again.

Wait, let me consider the integral I = ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

Let me compute it directly.

Using integration by parts:

Let u = sin(kt), so du = k cos(kt) dt.

Let dv = e^(-st) dt, so v = -1/s e^(-st).

So I = uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du.

uv is [ - sin(kt) e^(-st) / s ] from 0 to ∞.

At t=∞: e^(-st) → 0, so term is 0.

At t=0: sin(0) = 0, so term is 0.

So uv term is 0.

Now, the integral part is - ∫ v du = - ∫ [ -1/s e^(-st) ] * k cos(kt) dt.

Which is (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt = (k/s) J.

So I = (k/s) J.

Now, J = ∫ e^(-st) cos(kt) dt.

Again, integration by parts:

Let u = cos(kt), du = -k sin(kt) dt.

Let dv = e^(-st) dt, v = -1/s e^(-st).

So J = [ - cos(kt) e^(-st) / s ] from 0 to ∞ + (k/s) ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt.

The first term evaluates to [ 0 - ( -1/s *1 ) ] → 1/s.

So J = 1/s + (k/s) I.

Now, substituting back into I:

I = (k/s) J → I = (k/s)(1/s + (k/s) I )

= (k/s)(1/s) + (k^2/s^2) I.

So,

I = k/(s^2) + (k^2/s^2) I.

Subtract (k^2/s^2) I from both sides:

I - (k^2/s^2) I = k/(s^2 )

→ I (1 - (k^2/s^2)) = k/(s^2 )

→ I = [k/(s^2)] / [ (s^2 - k^2)/s^2 ) ]

= [k/(s^2)] * [ s^2/(s^2 -k^2) ) ]

= k/(s^2 -k^2 )

Hmm, I keep getting I = k/(s^2 -k^2 ), which is option F.

But the standard Laplace transform formula for sin(kt) is k/(s^2 +k^2 ), which is option A.

So there's a problem here. Either the integration by parts is incorrect, or I'm making a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the integral I = ∫ e^(-st) sin(kt) dt is equal to the Laplace transform of sin(kt) multiplied by e^(-st), but perhaps I should consider the complex variable s.

Wait, no, the variable s is a real variable in the Laplace transform.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula I have for the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s^2 +k^2 ), and the formula I have for the Laplace transform of e^(-st) sin(kt) is k/(s^2 -k^2 ), which is option F.

Hmm, but that can't be right, because the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is k/(s^2 +k^2 ), which is option A, but the Laplace transform of e^(-st) sin(kt) should be the Laplace transform of sin(kt) evaluated at s' = s +k, I think.

Wait, perhaps I should use the shifting property of Laplace transforms.

Wait, the Laplace transform of e^{-at} f(t) is F(s +a), where F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).

So, if f(t) is sin(kt), then f(t) would have a Laplace transform of k/(s^2 +k^2).

So, the Laplace transform of e^{-st} sin(kt) would be F(s +s), but wait, no.

Wait, more accurately, if f(t) is sin(kt), then f(t) = sin(kt).

The Laplace transform of f(t) is ∫ e^{-st} sin(kt) dt from 0 to ∞ = k/(s^2 +k^2).

Now, if I have e^{-st} sin(kt), it's the same as f(t) where f(t) is sin(kt), but multiplied by e^{-st}.

So, according to the shifting property, the Laplace transform of e^{-st} f(t) is F(s +s), no, wait, no. Wait, the shifting property is that the Laplace transform of e^{-at} f(t) is F(s +a), I think.

Wait, if f(t) is sin(kt), then the Laplace transform of e^{-st} sin(kt) is F(s +s) = F(2s).

Wait, but that can't be right. Because then, F(2s) would be k/( (2s)^2 +k^2 ) = k/(4s^2 +k^2 ), which is not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the shifting property wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct property is that the Laplace transform of e^{-at} f(t) is F(s +a). So, if f(t) is sin(kt), then the Laplace transform of e^{-st} sin(kt) would be F(s +s) = F(2s) = k/( (2s)^2 +k^2 ) = k/(4s^2 +k^2 ), which is not any of the options.

But according to the standard property, the Laplace transform of e^{-at} f(t) is F(s +a). So if f(t) is sin(kt), then F(s) is k/(s^2 +k^2), so F(s +a) would be k/( (s +a)^2 +k^2 ).

But in our problem, the Laplace transform is e^{-st} sin(kt), which is F(s) evaluated at s' = s +s? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps this is getting me more confused. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct Laplace transform is option A: k/(s^2 +k^2).

So, the correct answer is A.

So, the mistake earlier was in the integration by parts steps, leading to I = k/(s^2 -k^2 ), which is option F.

But according to the standard formula, the correct answer is option A.

So, perhaps I should just pick option A as the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: k/(s^2 +k^2).

ANSWER: A
