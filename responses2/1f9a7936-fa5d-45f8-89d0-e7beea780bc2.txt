Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me about a cannonball being fired. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking whether the cannonball and the cannon experience equal something. The options are about various quantities like displacement, acceleration, momentum, energy, etc. 

First, I need to consider what happens when a cannonball is fired. The cannon itself is exerting a force on the cannonball. Newton's third law says that the cannonball will exert an equal and opposite force on the cannon. So, both the cannonball and the cannon are experiencing forces. That would mean they have accelerations because force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). So, both must have accelerations. 

Wait, let me think again. Newton's third law says that each object experiences an equal and opposite force. So, if the cannon applies a force on the cannonball, the cannonball applies a force on the cannon. That makes sense. So both have forces, so their accelerations should be the same, right? Because if F = ma, then a = F/m. So if F is the same and if the masses are different, the accelerations would be different. Wait, the cannonball is probably much heavier than the cannon. So, the cannonball's acceleration is smaller than the cannon's. But the question is about whether they experience equal something. Oh wait, the question is phrased as "equal" as in, are their... quantities equal?

Wait, the options are about what they experience being equal. The choices are A to J. So, the question is, when a cannonball is fired, both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal of something. So, which of these options is correct?

Looking at the options: A is displacement. So the displacement of the cannonball is the same as the displacement of the cannon? Wait, no, because when you fire the cannon, the cannon moves backward, and the cannonball moves forward. So their displacements are not the same. For example, if the cannon fires, it might move a little, but the cannonball would move a lot. So their displacements are not equal. So option A is wrong.

Option B says both experience both. That's not accurate, because they experience different things. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Neither. That can't be right, because they both experience forces, so some quantity is equal.

Option D: Both have equal accelerations. Wait, as I thought earlier, because the force is the same, but the mass of the cannonball is much larger than the cannon's mass. So the accelerations would be different. So D is incorrect, unless the question is about they have equal forces. Wait, no, the question is about equal something. So if they have equal forces, then their accelerations would be the same. But in reality, the forces are equal, but their accelerations are different because of mass differences.

Wait, let me get this straight. Newton's third law says that the cannon exerts a force F on the cannonball, and the cannonball exerts an equal and opposite force F on the cannon. So they each have the same force, F. So their accelerations would be a_cannon = F/m_cannon, and a_cannonball = F/m_cannonball. So since m_cannonball is much larger than m_cannon, a_cannonball is much smaller. So their accelerations are not equal.

Wait, but the question is about what they experience being equal. So the question is, when the cannon is fired, do they have equal... something. So for example, both have same velocity? No, the cannonball would move much faster. So no. Displacement is different, as I thought. Momentum: momentum is mass times velocity. The cannonball's mass is much larger, so even if its velocity is lower, its momentum is less than the cannon's. So no, they don't have same momentum. 

What about kinetic energy? Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². The cannonball's KE would be (1/2)m(velocity of cannonball)^2. The cannon's velocity is much lower, but its mass is much larger. So to compare, since m_cannonball is much bigger, then (m_v²) would be same as m_cannon (since m_cannonball * v_cannonball² = m_cannon * v_cannon²). So m_cannonball * v_cannonball² = m_cannon * v_cannon². But since m_cannonball is much larger, v_cannonball would be much smaller than v_cannon. So (v_cannonball)^2 is (m_cannon / m_cannonball) * v_cannon². So, m_cannonball * v_cannonball² = m_cannon * v_cannon². So v_cannonball² = (m_cannon / m_cannonball) * v_cannon². So, if m_cannonball is, say, 2000 kg and m_cannon is 100 kg, then v_cannonball is roughly v_cannon * sqrt(100/2000) = v_cannon * 1/4.9. So v_cannon is 4.9 times higher. So the cannon's KE would be (1/2)(100)(v_cannon)^2, and the cannonball's is (1/2)(2000)( (v_cannon/4.9) )^2. Let me compute that.

(1/2)*2000*(v^2)/(4.9^2) = (1000 v² )/(24.01) ≈ 41.65 v². The cannon's KE is (1/2)*100*(v^2) = 50 v^2. So the cannonball has more KE than the cannon? Wait, that can't be right. Because the cannon is exerting force on the cannonball, so the cannonball gains KE, and the cannon's KE would decrease. But wait, when the cannon is fired, maybe the cannon itself loses kinetic energy. But in this case, the question is about when it's fired, so perhaps it's a simple scenario without energy loss. 

But in reality, the cannon and cannonball system's total momentum is conserved because there's no external force. So their momenta are equal and opposite. So m_cannon * v_cannon = m_cannonball * v_cannonball. So m * v = M * v'. So momentum is conserved. But that's about momentum, which is mass times velocity. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So, the question is about which option is correct. The cannon and cannonball have equal momentum, but I don't see that option. The options are about displacement, acceleration, etc. So the question is, are they experiencing equal something.

Wait, the question is, when the cannon is fired, both experience equal of something. So which of the options is correct.

Looking back, the options are:

A: displacements.

B: both same.

C: neither.

D: both same acceleration.

E: same amount of momentum.

F: same potential energy.

G: same kinetic energy.

H: same velocities.

I: same amounts of force.

J: same amounts of heat energy.

Wait, the options are about what they experience being equal. So, for example, option D says both have same acceleration. But as I thought, the acceleration would be different because their masses are different. So D is incorrect.

Hmm. So the only options are whether they have equal something. So for the question, the options are whether the two objects (cannon and cannonball) have equal in some quantity. So, for example, they each have the same force, same acceleration, same momentum, etc.

Wait, when the cannon is fired, the cannon and cannonball experience equal forces. So the forces are equal and opposite. So the options about forces would be correct. So the cannonball and cannon experience equal forces.

But the options are about what they experience being equal. So the question is, both experience equal of something. So the correct answer is that they have equal forces, so the force is same, so the answer would be that they have equal forces, so option I (since I think the options are about force). Wait, no, let's check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: displacements.

B: Both

C: Neither

D: Both same acceleration.

E: same momentum.

F: same potential energy.

G: same kinetic energy.

H: same velocities.

I: same amounts of force.

J: same heat energy.

So the question is, when the cannon is fired, both experience equal something. So, which option is correct.

The options are about what they experience being equal. So the question is, what is the same for both.

So, when the cannon is fired, the cannon applies a force on the cannonball, and the cannonball applies a force on the cannon. So the forces are equal and opposite. So, their acceleration is same magnitude, but opposite direction. So that would make option D (both same acceleration) if they're being compared in magnitude. But the acceleration is a vector, so equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So if the question is about magnitude, then D is correct. If the question is about direction, then no.

Wait, the options are: D: both same acceleration. So if acceleration is considered in vector terms, same acceleration would mean same magnitude and direction. So the cannonball's acceleration is opposite in direction to the cannon's. So their accelerations are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So they are not same vectors. So D is incorrect.

So the question is about what they experience being equal. So for the force, the question is which option says they experience equal force.

Looking again, the options include "forces" in some options, but the question is about what they experience being equal. The options are about displacement, acceleration, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether they have equal momentum. Because in a closed system, the total momentum is conserved. So the cannon and cannonball's combined momentum before firing is zero (assuming the cannon is stationary and the cannonball is at rest). After firing, the cannon has some momentum to the left and the cannonball to the right, but their momenta are equal in magnitude (opposite in direction). So their momenta are equal, so option E, same momentum.

But wait, option E is "same amounts of momentum." So they have the same momentum in magnitude but opposite direction. So their momenta are equal in magnitude, but the question is about what they experience being equal. So E is correct, but let's check the options.

Option E: amounts of momentum. So, if the question is, are they experiencing equal amounts of momentum? Well, their momenta are equal, so yes, they have same momentum. So E would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Before firing, the system is at rest, so total momentum is zero. After firing, the system's total momentum is zero, so the magnitudes must be equal and opposite, so their momenta are equal. So they have same momentum. So E says "same amounts of momentum." So that would be correct.

But wait, option E: amounts of momentum. So, if the cannonball's momentum is equal in magnitude to the cannon's, then yes, they have same momenta. So E is correct. 

But wait, let me check all the options again. The question is, when a cannon is fired, both the cannon and cannonball experience equal what?

We can think about the momentum. But another point is that the cannonball and cannon, when fired, have the same momentum because the forces are equal and opposite. So their momenta are equal. So, the correct answer would be that they have same momentum, so E is correct.

But let me check the other options to make sure. For acceleration, the acceleration is F/m, so the same F but different m, so different a. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is E: same amounts of momentum.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the cannon and cannonball are part of a closed system. So their momentum is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So if E is about same amounts (so same magnitude), that would be correct. So E is correct.

Alternatively, another way: momentum is a vector quantity, so same magnitude but opposite direction. So equal in magnitude, so E is correct.

So looking at the options, the correct answer is E: amounts of momentum. So the question is, both have same momentum, so E is the correct answer.
</think>

The question asks whether the cannonball and the cannon experience equal quantities when the cannon is fired. To analyze this, we consider the principles of physics, particularly Newton's third law and momentum conservation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Newton's Third Law**: The cannon exerts a force on the cannonball, and the cannonball exerts an equal and opposite force on the cannon. Thus, both objects experience equal forces.

2. **Displacement**: The cannonball and the cannon move in opposite directions, so their displacements are not equal. This eliminates option A.

3. **Acceleration**: Since the forces are equal but the masses of the cannon and cannonball are different, their accelerations are not the same. The cannonball has a much smaller acceleration than the cannon. Thus, option D (both same acceleration) is incorrect.

4. **Momentum**: In a closed system, the total momentum is conserved. Before firing, the system is stationary, so the total momentum is zero. After firing, the cannon and cannonball have equal and opposite momenta. Therefore, their momenta are equal in magnitude, making option E (same amounts of momentum) correct.

5. **Other Options**: Options B, C, F, G, H, I, and J do not apply to this scenario. For example, momentum is conserved, so they do not have equal amounts of heat energy (J), velocities (H), or kinetic energy (G). Similarly, they do not have equal forces (I) or same amounts of momentum (E).

### Conclusion:
The cannonball and the cannon have equal momenta in magnitude but opposite directions. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: amounts of momentum**
