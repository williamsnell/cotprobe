Question:

In humans, the disease known as hemophilia is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Sally and Sam, both of whom are normal, marry, and they have three children: (1) Saul, a hemophiliac, who marries a normal woman and has a daughter, Sarah, who is normal; (2) a normal daughter, Sheryl, who marries a normal man and has a son, Solomon, who is a hemophiliac; and (3) Shirley, also normal, who marries and has six normal sons. Using the letters H and h for the normal and hemophilia genes, respectively, and \nearrow to represent the Y chromosome, determine the genotypes of Sally, Sam, Saul, Sarah, Sheryl, Solomon and Shirley.

Options:

A: Sally: HH, Sam: h\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
B: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: HH
C: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
D: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH
E: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: Hh, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
F: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
G: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
H: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
I: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: H\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH
J: Sally: Hh, Sam: h\nearrow, Saul: H\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the genotypes of Sally, Sam, Saul, Sarah, Sheryl, Solomon, and Shirley. The disease is hemophilia, which is X-linked recessive. That means only males can get the hemophilia gene. Since Sally and Sam are both normal, their sons and daughters would have different probabilities.

First, let's list all the children and their traits. 

1. Saul is a hemophiliac. He marries a normal woman and has a daughter Sarah, who is normal.
2. Sheryl is normal, marries a normal man, has a son Solomon, who is hemophiliac.
3. Shirley is normal, marries someone and has six sons, all normal.

Wait, but according to the question, these are the three children each couple has. So each couple has three children, but the problem statement says each has three children, so perhaps the children are the ones listed. So each of them has three children, not three in total.

Wait, the question says three children each. So each of the three children (Saul, Sheryl, Shirley) have three children each? Or each couple has three children, each of whom is described.

Wait, the way the question is written: 

The three children (1, 2, 3) are each individuals with their own children. So each of the three (Saul, Sheryl, Shirley) has three children each, but the question lists each of them as having three children.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

Let me start by figuring out the parents' genotypes. Since they are both normal, their X and Y chromosomes are normal. So Sally and Sam are both carriers? Or?

Wait, if both are normal, their possible genotypes are either XY (where X is normal, Y is the normal allele, but wait, hemophilia is an X-linked recessive, so the X must be recessive. So for a normal individual, their genotype would be XY where X is normal and Y is normal. But wait, that's not correct because hemophiles are on the X. So a normal person has an X with the normal allele and a Y. So a normal person's genotype is X^H Y (assuming H is normal and h is hemophilic). Wait, no: wait, the X that carries the hemophilia gene is the X.

In hemophilia, the allele is on the X. So for a normal person, they have one X (normal) and one Y. So their genotype is X^H Y. Wait, but wait—no. Wait, the hemophiliac person has an X^h. So for a person to be normal, their X must be X^H, Y (since hemophiles are recessive). So, the normal parent is X^H Y, the hemophiliac parent is X^h Y.

Wait, but in the case of a normal person, their genotype is X^H Y. For a hemophiliac, it's X^h Y.

But wait, wait—no, that can't be right. Because hemophilia is on the X, so the hemophiliac has the X^h. So, a normal person's genotype is X^H Y, and a hemophiliac is X^h Y. So both are XY, with Y being normal and X either H or h.

So if Sally and Sam are both normal, their X must be normal (so X^H) and the Y is normal (Y^+). So Sally's genotype is X^H Y, and same for Sam. Wait no, wait—wait, both are normal, so each has an X^H (normal) and Y (normal, since they are normal). So their X is H and Y is H. Thus, both are X^H Y.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if both are X^H Y, their children would all be X^H Y (normal), because only males can have hemophiles. Wait, but that's conflicting with the first child, Saul who is a hemophiliac. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. If Sally and Sam are both normal, their X are normal (so X^H), but their Y are normal (Y^+). So each is X^H Y. But if that's the case, their children would all be X^H Y (normal), but the question states that each of them has a child with hemophilia. So that must not be right. So perhaps Sally and Sam are both hemophiliac carriers? Or one is a carrier and the other is normal.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The question says Sally and Sam are both normal. Their children include a hemophiliac, so the parents must carry the hemophilia gene.

Because if both parents are normal (X^H Y), their children would all be normal. But the first child is a hemophiliac, so that's impossible. Therefore, the parents must be carriers. So one of them must have the hemophilic gene.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the hemophilia is on the X. So if a parent is hemophilic, they have X^h and Y. But if both parents are normal, then their X chromosomes are X^H Y and X^H Y. So the children would all have X^H Y, i.e., normal.

But the first child is a hemophiliac, so that's impossible. Therefore, one of the parents must be a hemophiliac. Wait, but the question says both Sally and Sam are normal. So that's a problem. Hmm, maybe I've got this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the parents are both hemophiliac carriers. Wait, no—because hemophilia is an autosomal recessive trait, but the question says it's X-linked. So I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think. 

Wait, maybe the parents are both hemophiliac carriers. So their possible genotypes are X^H X^h. So Sally is X^H X^h, Sam is X^H X^h. Then their children have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac (X^h Y), 50% normal (X^H Y). So the first child has a 25% chance of being a hemophiliac. But the first child (Saul) is a hemophiliac, so that's possible. So perhaps that's the case.

But the problem states that Sally and Sam are both normal. So that would mean that both their X chromosomes are normal. But in that case, their children would all be normal, which contradicts the first child being a hemophiliac. So perhaps something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused about whether hemophilia is on the X. Let me clarify. Yes, hemophilia is X-linked recessive. So the hemophiliac has the X^h allele. So, if the parents are both normal, their X chromosomes are all normal, so their children are normal (since X^H Y only). But the first child (Saul) is a hemophiliac, which is impossible if both parents are normal. So that suggests that at least one of the parents must be a hemophiliac carrier. But the question says both are normal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. The question states that Sally and Sam are both normal. So perhaps each has an X^H Y. But then their children can't be hemophiliac. So this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the parents are not both normal. Because the question says they are normal. Wait, no, the question says they are normal. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps one of the parents is hemophiliac. Let me see. If Sally is hemophiliac (X^h Y), and Sam is normal (X^H Y). So their children can have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac (Sally's X^h and Sam's X^H, so child X^h Y). So that would make Sally's sons have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac, and daughters have 0% chance. Because daughters receive X from mom and X from dad. So daughters would have X^H X^H, so normal (no hemophilia). So if Sally is hemophiliac (X^h Y), Sam is X^H Y, then their children:

- daughters: X^H (mom) X^H (dad) → normal (so no hemophilia).

- sons: X^h (dad) X^H (mom) → hemophiliac.

So the first child (Saul) is a son and a hemophiliac.

But in the problem statement, the first child is a hemophiliac (Saul), so that's possible. So in this scenario, Sally is hemophiliac and Sam is normal.

Wait, but the question says Sally and Sam are both normal. That's a contradiction. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps both Sally and Sam are hemophiliac carriers, but then that's not what the question says.

Wait, the question says Sally and Sam are normal. So perhaps each is a hemophiliac carrier. Wait no, that's not right. Let me read the question again.

Question says: Sally and Sam are both normal. So their genotype is X^H Y. So each is X^H Y.

But that would imply that all their children are normal, which contradicts the first child (Saul) being a hemophiliac. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the parents are both hemophiliac carriers, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "Sally and Sam, both of whom are normal." So their X chromosomes are normal, so X^H Y each.

But then, their children (as per the problem statement) are all normal. But the problem says that Saul is a hemophiliac, which would contradict this. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps one of them is hemophilic, and the other is normal. So let's say Sally is hemophilic (X^h Y), Sam is normal (X^H Y). Then their children can have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac (Saul) and daughters are normal (Sheryl) and sons are normal except when Sally is hemophilic.

Wait, but in that case, only the children who inherit Sally's X^h would be hemophilic.

So let's proceed with that.

So, Sally is hemophilic (X^h Y), Sam is normal (X^H Y).

Then, their children:

- Daughters: X^H (mom) X^H (dad) → normal.

- Sons: X^h (dad) X^H (mom) → hemophiliac.

So, the first child (Saul) is a son and hemophiliac.

Sheryl is daughter, so her genotype is X^H X^H (since she's normal). So her son (Solomon) is hemophiliac (X^h Y), so 25% chance.

Wait, but in the question, the second child of Sol is a hemophiliac. So let's see.

Wait, in the question, the description is:

- (1) Saul, a hemophiliac, who marries a normal woman and has a daughter, Sarah, who is normal.

- (2) a normal daughter, Sheryl, who marries a normal man and has a son, Solomon, who is a hemophiliac.

- (3) Shirley, also normal, who marries and has six normal sons.

Wait, so the two children described are each of the three (Saul, Sheryl, Shirley) and have three sons each. So each of these three has three sons.

So, for each, we can think of their children.

So let's track each parent's genotype.

First, Sally and Sam are both normal. So Sally is X^H Y, Sam is X^H Y. But that would make all their children normal, which conflicts with the first child being a hemophiliac. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I have an incorrect assumption.

Wait, perhaps one of them is hemophilic, the other is normal.

Wait, if Sally is hemophilic (X^h Y) and Sam is normal (X^H Y), then their children:

- Sons: 25% hemophilic (X^h Y).

- Daughters: 25% hemophilic (no, because daughters receive X from mom and X from dad. So if mom is X^H, then daughters are X^H X^H (normal), because they receive X^H from mom and X^H from dad (as Sam is X^H Y). Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, Sally is X^h Y, and Sam is X^H Y. So Sally's X is X^h, and Sam's X is X^H. So when Sally is a mother, she can give her Y (but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, Sam is X^H Y, so he gives X or Y. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, no. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should correct my approach. Let me try to model the possible genotypes.

Since both Sally and Sam are normal, their possible genotypes are X^H Y (since they're normal and can't have hemophilia). But wait, if both are X^H Y, their children would all be X^H Y, which is normal. But the problem says the first child (Saul) is a hemophiliac, which is impossible. So this suggests that perhaps the parents are not both normal, but one is hemophilic and the other is normal.

Wait, but the question says they're normal. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that both are normal. Alternatively, perhaps the hemophilia is on the X, but the parents' genotype is hemophilic. No, the question says they are normal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's try again.

Sally and Sam are both normal. So their X chromosomes are normal, meaning they have X^H (since Y is normal). Thus, each is X^H Y.

But then their children can't have hemophilia. So the first child (Saul) is a hemophiliac. So this is a contradiction.

This suggests that perhaps one of them is a hemophilic carrier. But the question says they are both normal. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the hemophilia allele is on the X, but the parents are hemophiliac carriers. So their genotype is X^h X^H. But the question says they are normal, so their X is normal, which would mean X^H. So that can't be. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the parents are hemophilic carriers, but the question says they're normal. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the parents are hemophilic carriers. But the question says they are normal, so that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps I should proceed with another approach.

Wait, let me look at the options to see if any can help.

Looking at the options, perhaps I can find the genotype of the hemophiliac children.

Option A: Sally: HH, Sam: h\nearrow. So Sally is Hh, Sam is hh. Wait, but Sam is supposed to be normal, but if he's hh, that means his X is h, so he's hemophilic. But the question says he's normal. So this can't be correct.

Option B: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow. So Sam is Hh. So his genotype is X^H Y (since he's Hh, so X^H from mom and Y from dad). Wait, but that would make him normal. Because if he's Hh, his X is H, Y is H (assuming hemodysthis is on X). So his genotype is X^H Y, which is normal. So his children would be X^H Y, which would be normal. So then, the children would all be normal. But the first child is a hemophiliac. So that's a contradiction.

Option C: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow. So Sam is Hh (X^H Y). Sally is Hh as well. So their children would have 50% chance of being hemophiliac. Which aligns with the first child (Saul) being hemophiliac.

Wait, but the first child is a son and a hemophiliac. So if Sally is Hh and Sam is Hh, then their children have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac (since only sons inherit the son's X chromosome, and daughters get X from both parents). Wait, no: sons receive X from mom and X from dad. Daughters receive X from mom and X from dad. So for a son, if mom is H and dad is H, the son's X is H. If mom is H and dad is h, the son's X is h. So the son's X can be H (if mom is H) or h (if mom is h and dad is H). But if both parents are Hh, then each son has a 50% chance of getting h (and thus hemophiliac) and 50% of H (and normal). Wait, but in the case where both parents are Hh, their children have 25% chance of being hemophiliac (if mom is h and dad is h). Wait, no, let's think.

Wait, for a son, the X from mom and dad. So if mom is H and dad is H, then son's X is H. So that's normal. If mom is H and dad is h, son's X is h. If mom is h and dad is H, son's X is h. If mom is h and dad is h, son's X is h.

Wait, no. Let me think again: if mom is Hh, she can give H or h. Sam is Hh, same. So the son's X is H (from mom) or h (from dad). So 50% H, 50% h. Similarly for the daughter. So the son's X is H or h, 50% each. So if a son inherits H from mom and H from dad, he's normal. If he gets h from dad, he's hemophiliac.

So the probability of a son being hemophiliac is 50% (since 50% chance of getting h from dad). Similarly, the probability for a daughter is 50% (50% chance of getting h from mom).

So, if both parents are Hh, then:

- 25% chance of a son being hemophiliac (because 50% to get h from dad, and 50% to get H from mom. So 50 * 50 = 25%).

Wait, no. Wait, the son has X from mom and X from dad. So for a son, the possible X's are H (if mom is H) or h (if mom is h and dad is H). Wait, this is getting too messy. Let me think with a 2x2 Punnett square.

For the sons:

Each son's genotype is X from mom and X from dad.

Possible outcomes for mom's X: H or h.

Possible outcomes for dad's X: H or h.

So the possible sons' X chromosomes are:

H (mom) and H (dad) → H H (normal).

H (mom) and h (dad) → H h (hemophiliac).

h (mom) and H (dad) → h H (hemophiliac).

h (mom) and h (dad) → h h (hemophiliac).

So each of these possibilities is 25% of the sons. So 25% of sons are hemophiliac.

Similarly, 25% of daughters are hemophiliac.

So, back to the problem.

In the problem, the first child is a hemophiliac (Saul), so this must be a son. So his X must be h, and his dad must have provided the H.

Wait, no. Wait, if the first child is a son and hemophiliac, this implies that the son's X is h, and the father's X is H (because the son can only get X from mom and X from dad). Wait, but that's not correct. The son's X comes from the mother and the father's X. So for the son to have X^h, the father must have X^h. But the father's X^h would make the mother's X^H. So the son can't have X^h if the father has X^h. So perhaps I've got the relationship wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the father's X chromosome is H, and mom's X is H. So the son's X would be H (from mom) and H (from dad) → H H, normal. So that can't be. So the son's X must be H from mom and h from dad → H h (hemophiliac). So that's 25% of sons.

So, in this case, the first child is a son and hemophiliac. So that must be the case.

So, the parents must have:

One parent with X^h (the father), and the other parent with X^H (the mother). But wait, if the father is X^h, then his daughters would have X^H (mom) and X^H (dad) → normal. But the first child is a son, so he must be X^h (from dad) and X^H (from mom) → H h, hemophiliac. So that fits.

So the parents are:

Sally: X^H Y.

Sam: X^h Y.

Wait, but that's only possible if both are normal. Because X^H Y would be normal, as they don't have hemophilia. But wait, no, wait. Wait, if both are normal, their children would all be normal. But the first child is a hemophiliac, which is impossible. So this is a contradiction.

So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the parents are both normal, but one is hemophilic. But the question says both are normal, so that's not possible.

Wait, no. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's proceed with the options provided and see which makes sense.

Looking at option C: 

Sally: Hh (X^H X^h)

Sam: H\nearrow (X^H Y)

Wait, no, because if Sam is X^H Y, he is normal (X^H Y is normal). So Sally must be X^h X^H (homozygous for hemophilic). But the question says they are normal. So this is impossible. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the question actually says that both are hemophilic carriers. Let me think.

If Sally is X^h X^h, and Sam is X^h X^h. Then their children have 25% chance of being hemophilic. But the problem says the first child is a hemophiliac. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the options and see which makes sense.

For example, option C says Sally is Hh, Sam is H\nearrow. So Sam is Hh (X^H X^h), and Sally is Hh (X^H X^h). So their children have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac. But the problem says the first child is a hemophiliac. So this doesn't fit.

Option A: Sally is HH (normal), Sam is h\nearrow (homozygous recessive). So their children are all normal. But the problem says the first child is a hemophiliac, which is a contradiction.

Option B: Sally is HH (normal), Sam is H\nearrow (homozygous dominant). So their children are all normal. But problem says first child is hemophiliac. Contradiction.

Option D: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow. So Sally is Hh (X^H X^h), Sam is Hh (X^H X^h). So their children have 25% chance of being hemophiliac. Again, problem says first child is hemophiliac.

Option E: Sally: HH (normal), Sam: h\nearrow (homozygous recessive). So their children are all normal. Problem says first child is hemophiliac. Contradiction.

Option F: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow. So same as option D.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

Since the problem involves hemophilia, let's list the possibilities based on the options given.

The correct answer must have:

- Both parents are normal, so their genotype is X^H Y each.

- Their children (Saul and others) are either normal or hemophiliac.

But the problem says that the first child is a hemophiliac, which would be impossible if both parents are normal. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question statement is correct and I'm misunderstanding the genetics. Let me think again.

In hemophilia, the gene is on the X. So, if a person has hemophilia (X^h X^H), they have hemophilia. If a person is normal, their X is normal.

So, the first child (Saul) is a son and has hemophilia, which would mean that the father must have X^h, and the mother must have X^H. But if the mother is normal (X^H Y), then the first child would be X^H (mom) X^h (dad) → X^H X^h, which is a hemophiliac. But the mother is normal, so her genotype is X^H Y. Therefore, the only way the first child is a hemophiliac is if the father is hemophilic. But the question says the parents are normal. So this is a contradiction.

So, this suggests that the correct answer must have one parent as hemophilic and the other as normal, but the question says both are normal. Therefore, perhaps the answer is not possible, but since the question is given, I must proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me try to think of the options again.

Looking at option A:

Sally: HH (normal)

Sam: h\nearrow (homozygous recessive, meaning Sam has X^h X^h)

So, their children:

- Daughters: X^H (mom) X^H (dad) → normal.

- Sons: X^h (dad) X^H (mom) → hemophiliac.

So, the first child (Saul) is a son and hemophiliac. So that's possible.

Sheryl is daughter. She's X^H X^H → normal.

Shirley is daughter. She's X^H X^H → normal.

Wait, but the problem says that the second child is a normal daughter, and the third child is a normal son. So, perhaps the parents' genotypes are different.

Wait, perhaps the parents are both normal, but the hemophilic allele is on the X. So, Sally is X^H Y, Sam is X^h Y. Then their children would have 50% chance of being hemophiliac. Which aligns with the first child being a hemophiliac.

But then, the second child is a normal daughter, which would be X^H X^H (normal) and third child is X^H Y (normal). So that fits.

So, let's think about this. Sally is X^H Y, Sam is X^h Y.

Then, their children:

- Sons: X^h Y → hemophiliac (25%).

- Daughters: X^H X^H → normal.

So, in the problem's scenario, the first child is a son and hemophiliac, the second child is a normal daughter, and the third child is a normal son.

But the second child is a normal daughter. How? Because the daughters are X^H X^H. But if the parents are X^H Y and X^h Y, then the daughters are X^H X^H → normal. So the second child is a normal daughter, which is correct.

The third child is a son: X^h Y → normal, correct.

So, the first child is a son with hemophiliac, which is correct.

Now, let's look at the options.

Option A: Sally: HH, Sam: h\nearrow. So Sally is Hh (but that can't be, because if she's normal, her genotype is X^H Y). So this is incorrect.

Option B: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow. So Sam is Hh (X^H X^h). So their children would have 50% hemophiliac. But the problem says the first child is a hemophiliac, so this doesn't fit.

Option C: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow. So Sam is Hh, so his genotype is X^H X^h. So their children would have 25% hemophiliac.

But in the problem, the first child is a hemophiliac, so this doesn't fit.

Option D: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow. Same as option C.

Option E: Sally: HH, Sam: h\nearrow. So Sally is Hh (X^H X^h), Sam is h\nearrow (X^h X^h). So their children would have 25% hemophiliac. But the first child is a hemophiliac, which matches. But then, the second child is a normal daughter, which would be a daughter of X^H X^H → correct. But what about the third child? If the parents are X^H X^h and X^h X^h, then their children would have 25% hemophiliac. But the problem says the third child is a normal son. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, let me think. If the parents are X^H X^h and X^h X^h, then:

- Sons: 25% X^h Y → hemophiliac.

- Daughters: 25% X^H X^h → hemophiliac.

So, the second child (son) would be hemophiliac, but the problem says the second child is a normal daughter. So that's a contradiction.

Thus, option E cannot be correct.

So, the correct option must have parents that are both normal, with one parent being hemophilic (so that the children have 25% chance of being hemophiliac), and the problem's scenario must allow for that.

Wait, perhaps the parents are both normal, but one parent is hemophilic. But according to the question, both are normal. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the hemophilic allele is on the Y chromosome. But the question says it's on the X.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the options again.

The correct option must have parents who are both normal, with one being hemophilic. But the question states both are normal, which is a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the hemophilic allele is on the Y chromosome, but the question says it's on the X. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the hemophilic allele is on the X, and the parents are both carriers. But the question says both are normal, so that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the hemophilic allele is on the Y, but the question says it's on the X. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at option A:

Sally: HH, Sam: h\nearrow.

So Sally is Hh (but that would mean she's hemophilic, but the question says she's normal. So this is incorrect.

Option B:

Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow.

Sam is Hh (X^H X^h). Their children have 25% hemophiliac. The first child is a hemophiliac. So that's correct.

Then, Sheryl is daughter, X^H X^H → normal.

Shirley is daughter, X^H X^H → normal.

So the second child is Sheryl, normal. The third child is Shirley, normal. So this fits.

But wait, the third child is a normal son. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the problem, the first child is a hemophiliac, the second child is a normal daughter, the third child is a normal son. So this fits.

But what about the parents' genotypes? If Sam is Hh, then his genotype is X^H X^h. Sally is Hh, her genotype is X^H X^h. So their children have 25% hemophiliac, which fits the first child being a hemophiliac.

So, this scenario is possible.

But then, the third child is a normal son, which is correct, because sons have 50% chance of hemophiliac.

Wait, but if the parents are both Hh, then the children would have 25% hemophiliac. So the first child is a hemophiliac. The second child is a normal son. The third child is a normal son. But that suggests that the second child is the son, which is a normal, so that's correct. But the problem says the second child is a normal daughter. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the parents are both Hh. Then, their children would have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac. So the first child is a hemophiliac. The second child is a son: 50% chance of being normal, 50% of hemophiliac. So if the second child is a normal son, that's correct. The third child is a daughter: 50% chance of being normal, 50% of hemophiliac. So if the third child is a normal daughter, that's correct. But the problem says the third child is a normal son. So that's a contradiction.

So, if the parents are both Hh, then the third child is a son, 50% normal, 50% hemophiliac. So the problem says that the third child is a normal son, which is incorrect.

Thus, option B is incorrect.

Wait, but let's see the problem again. The problem says:

The third child is a normal son.

But if the parents are both Hh, then the third child is a son, 50% normal, 50% hemophiliac. So the third child can't be a normal son. So the problem's scenario is impossible.

Thus, option B is incorrect.

Now, let's think of option C.

Option C:

Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow.

So, Sally is Hh (X^H X^h), Sam is Hh (X^H X^h). So their children have a 25% chance of being hemophiliac.

So the first child is a hemophiliac.

The second child is Sally's daughter, X^H X^H → normal.

The third child is Sally's son, X^H X^h → normal.

So that fits the problem.

But wait, how about the parents' genotypes? If both are Hh, then yes.

But the problem says that the second child is a normal daughter. Which is correct.

The third child is a normal son. Which is correct.

But then, the problem's scenario is correct.

But wait, the third child is a son, who has 50% normal, 50% hemophiliac. So the problem says that the third child is a normal son, which is incorrect.

So the problem's scenario is incorrect.

Thus, option C is incorrect.

Wait, but let's think again.

If Sally is Hh and Sam is Hh, their children are:

- Sons: X^H Y (normal), X^h Y (normal), X^H Y (normal), X^h Y (normal) → all normal.

Wait, no. Wait, the children are:

- Sons: X^H Y (from mom) and X^h Y (from dad). Wait, no. Wait, their children are:

Wait, wait, no, sorry, getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

Wait, if Sally is X^H X^h and Sam is X^H X^h, then their children are:

- Sons: X^H Y (mom) and X^h Y (dad). So 50% X^H Y (mom) and 50% X^h Y (dad). So sons are 50% X^H Y (mom's side) and 50% X^h Y (dad's side). Wait, no, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the children's possibilities.

Wait, the children are:

- Sons: X^H Y (mom) and X^h Y (dad).

- Daughters: X^H X^H (mom) and X^H X^h (dad).

Wait, no. Wait, the daughters are X^H X^H (mom) and X^H X^h (dad). So daughters are 50% X^H X^H (mom) and 50% X^H X^h (dad). So daughters are normal.

So, for the children:

- Sons: 50% X^H Y (mom) and 50% X^h Y (dad). So 50% normal, 50% hemophiliac. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. No, wait.

Wait, no. Wait, if mom is X^H Y and dad is X^h Y, then their children are all X^H X^h, which are normal. Because the son will be X^H Y (mom) and X^h Y (dad) → X^H X^h, normal.

The daughter will be X^H X^h (mom) and X^h X^h (dad) → X^H X^h, normal.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, no.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, when the mom is X^H Y and dad is X^h Y, the children are:

- Sons: X^H Y (mom) and X^h Y (dad) → X^H X^h, normal.

- Daughters: X^H Y (mom) and X^h Y (dad) → X^H X^h, normal.

So all children are normal.

Thus, the problem's scenario is impossible.

Thus, none of the options fit except option C, which says Sally is Hh and Sam is Hh, and the scenario is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but no, no, no. Because the problem's scenario is that the first child is a hemophiliac, the second is a normal daughter, the third is a normal son. But according to the scenario, the first is a hemophiliac, which is correct, the second is a normal daughter, correct, the third is a normal son, correct. But according to the parents' genotypes, the third child is a son, which has a 50% chance of being normal, which is correct. So, the scenario is correct.

Thus, option C is correct.

Wait, but the problem says that both parents are normal. So option C says both parents are normal, which is correct. So the scenario is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The correct answer is **Option C**, which states that Sally is **Hh** and Sam is **Hh**. This setup allows the scenario described in the question to be correct. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Parents' Genotypes**:  
   - Sally is **Hh** (X^H X^h).  
   - Sam is **Hh** (X^H X^h).  
   - Both are **normal**, meaning they have two normal chromosomes (X^H X^H).  

2. **Children's Genotypes**:  
   - **Sons**: X^H Y (mom) and X^h Y (dad).  
     - Both are **normal**, as X^H X^H.  
   - **Daughters**: X^H X^h (mom) and X^h X^h (dad).  
     - Both are **normal**, as X^H X^H.  

3. **Scenario**:  
   - The first child is a **hemophiliac** (X^h Y).  
   - The second child is a **normal daughter** (X^H X^H).  
   - The third child is a **normal son** (X^H Y).  

This scenario aligns with the given options and the conditions stated in the question. Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
