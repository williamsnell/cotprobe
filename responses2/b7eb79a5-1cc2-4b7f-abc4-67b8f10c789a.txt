Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the cost of renting a warehouse. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems, but I'll do my best.

The question says that Teddy's Auto Parts is renting a warehouse. The lease requires paying an annual rent of $2 per square foot. Hmm, so first I need to find out how much the rent is based on the size of the warehouse. The warehouse is 62,500 square feet. So, I should calculate 2 dollars multiplied by 62,500 square feet. Let me write that down: 2 * 62500. Let me do the math. 62,500 times 2 is 125,000. So that's $125,000 in rent.

Wait, but the question also mentions taxes and insurance. The annual taxes are $12,000 and insurance is $400. I think I need to add those to the rent. So, adding 12,000 and 400. 12,000 plus 400 is 12,400. So, the total cost would be the sum of the rent plus the taxes and insurance.

So, $125,000 (rent) + $12,400 (taxes and insurance) equals what? Let me do the addition. 125,000 plus 12,400. That's 125,000 + 12,400 equals 137,400. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 125,000 + 10,000 is 135,000, and then adding 2,400 more gives 137,400. Yeah, that looks correct.

Looking back at the options, option I is $137,400. So, that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Did I include everything? The lease says to pay $2 per square foot plus taxes and insurance. So, yes, those two things are part of the annual cost. So, the 2 * 62,500 is the rent, which is correct, and then plus 12,400.

Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. I don't think there's any other cost mentioned. So, the total is $137,400, which is option I.

The total cost for the occupancy of the warehouse for one year includes both the rent and additional expenses. 

1. Calculate the annual rent: 2 dollars per square foot multiplied by 62,500 square feet equals $125,000.
2. Add the annual taxes and insurance: $12,000 + $400 = $12,400.
3. Sum the two amounts: $125,000 + $12,400 = $137,400.

The correct answer is option I: $137,400.

Answer: I
