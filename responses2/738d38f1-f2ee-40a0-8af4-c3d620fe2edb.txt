Okay, so I've got this question about Kohler's studies with apes. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with the exact details, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what Kohler's work demonstrates, and there are several options to choose from.

First, I remember that Kohler was a behaviorist, right? He worked a lot with animal behavior, especially apes. His work focused on learning through observable behavior. So the options likely relate to operant conditioning or learning traits.

Looking at the options: 

Option B says apes can learn through operant conditioning. That rings a bell because Kohler did a lot of work on that. He showed that learning comes from the consequences of actions, so operant conditioning makes sense.

Option A talks about using objects as tools. That sounds more like a behaviorist approach to tool use, but I'm not sure if that's Kohler's main focus. Maybe not his main study.

Option C is about insight, which is a bit different from operant conditioning. Insight is more like discovery, not a learned behavior. I think Kohler was more about observable behavior and the conditioning aspect.

Option E says apes can recognize themselves in a mirror. That's more of a psychological or emotional thing, maybe related to self-referential behavior. I'm not sure if that's Kohler's main point.

Option F is about recognizing themselves in a mirror, which I think is more about instinct than behavior. Kohler might have studied how animals recognize themselves, but I'm not certain if that's his main contribution.

Option G talks about abstract thinking, which doesn't seem right. Kohler worked a lot on observable behavior, so I don't think he was contributing to abstract thinking.

Option H is about mimicking human behavior. That's more about social learning, which he did study, but I'm trying to remember if it's the main focus of his work.

Option I is about solving complex math problems, which suggests something more than just behavior. That might be more related to genetics or other areas, not Kohler's main area.

Option J is about understanding human languages. That's a big one, but again, I think Kohler focused more on animal behavior and learning through behavior.

Wait, but let me think again. Kohler's main work involved the animal's ability to learn through conditioning. He showed that the brain processes rewards and punishments, leading to behaviors. So option B is about operant conditioning, which is what he studied.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is:

**B: that apes can learn through operant conditioning.**

Kohler's studies focused on animal behavior, particularly apes, and his work emphasized learning through observable behavior, such as the effects of rewards and punishments. This aligns with operant conditioning, a key concept in his research. Therefore, the most accurate option is B.
