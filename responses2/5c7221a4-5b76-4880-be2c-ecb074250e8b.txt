Okay, I'm trying to solve this question about how many genes are in a plant's series. The question gives data on flower length varying between two strains, Strain A and Strain B. The data includes group means and variances for different generations. So, the main thing here is to find the number of genes involved in this variation.

First, I remember that in genetics, the variation in traits can be influenced by genes and environmental factors. The formula that comes to mind is the coefficient of variation, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, I think about the variance components. The total variance is the sum of the variance due to genes (or polygenes) and the variance due to the environment.

Looking at the data, each line represents a generation. Strain A has a mean of 21 mm and a variance of 1.43. Strain B is 39 mm with 1.16 variance. F1 is the cross of A and B, with a mean of 30 and 1.80 variance. F2 is the cross of F1 with itself, mean 30, and variance 5.10.

I think the idea is that the variation in flower length is due to both genes and the environment. So, the variance in F2 is mainly due to genes, while the variation in F1 and Strain A/B is due to the environment. Because F2 is the result of two F1 crosses, the variation in F2 would be the gene variance plus the environment variance.

Wait, wait. The variance of F2 might be the sum of the variances due to genes (because that's the variation in the F1 generation, which is due to parents' genes) and the environment's variance. Because F2 is the offspring of F1s, which themselves are a result of parents' genes plus environment.

So F2's variance is the sum of the genes' variance and the environment's variance. Because F1's variance is due to both the parents' genes and the environment. But wait, no. Let's think again. Each F1 comes from a cross of A and B. So the F1's mean is the average of A and B. The variance of F1 would be the average of the variances of A and B plus the interaction (environment) variance. Because F1 is (A + B) averaged, and the variance would be the average of A's variance and B's variance plus any interaction variance. So F1's variance (s^2) is the average of their two variances plus the environment variance. 

Wait, no. I think the formula is that the variance of F1 (assuming additive effects) would be (s_A^2 + s_B^2)/2 + σ^2, where σ^2 is the environment variance. Because F1 is (A + B)/2, so the variance is the average of A's and B's variances plus any shared environmental variance. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula, but I think that's the case.

So, let's compute the F1 variance. The variances given for Strain A and B are 1.43 and 1.16, respectively. So the average of those is (1.43 + 1.16)/2 = 1.295. But wait, wait. The variance of F1 would be the average of the variances of the parents plus the environment variance. Because F1 is a hybrid, so its variance is the average of the variances of the two parents plus the environment variance. Or wait, maybe it's the average of the variances plus the variance of the environment.

Wait, I'm not so certain. Let me think: each F1 plant's trait (flower length) is a combination of the parents (A and B) plus any environmental factors. So the variance of F1 would be the variance in the parents' traits plus the variance due to environment. So the variance of F1 is (s_A^2 + s_B^2)/2 + σ^2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the variance of F1 is the average of the parents' variances plus the environment variance. So V(F1) = (s_A^2 + s_B^2)/2 + σ^2.

Wait, let's look at the data. The variance of Strain A is 1.43, Strain B is 1.16, so average is (1.43 + 1.16)/2 = 1.295. So if the variance of F1 is 1.295 plus the environment variance. But the F1's variance is given as 1.80. So:

1.80 = 1.295 + σ^2 → σ^2 = 1.80 -1.295 = 0.505.

Wait, but wait, the F2's variance is given as 5.10. F2's variance is the sum of the variance due to genes and the environment variance.

So, F2's variance = variance due to genes (which is perhaps (s_A^2 + s_B^2)/2 + σ^2) plus the environment variance. Wait, no. Because the F2's variance is the variance of the offspring, which is the sum of the parents' variances (averaged) plus the environment variance. Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula.

Wait, I think the variance of F2 in a dihybrid cross (like F1 × F1) is given by (s_A^2 + s_B^2)/2 + σ^2 + 2ρ s_A s_B, where ρ is the correlation between A and B. But in the problem, it's not given, so perhaps we can assume that the genes are uncorrelated (ρ=0), which simplifies things. So F2's variance would be (s_A^2 + s_B^2)/2 + σ^2.

Wait, no, because F2 is (F1 × F1), and F1 is (A + B)/2. So F2 would be ( (A + B)/2 + (A' + B')/2 ), where A' and B' are the alleles of F1. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, since F2 is a dihybrid cross, the variance in F2 would be the average of the parents' variances plus the environment variance. Because F2 is the offspring of F1, which is a hybrid of A and B. So F2's variance would be the average of A and B's variances plus the environment variance.

Wait, let's think about this again. The F1 is a hybrid, so its mean is (A + B)/2. The variance of F1 would be the average of the variances of A and B plus the interaction variance (from the environment). So V(F1) = (s_A² + s_B²)/2 + σ².

But in the data, F1's variance is given as 1.80. So:

1.80 = (1.43 + 1.16)/2 + σ² → 1.295 + σ² =1.80 → σ²=0.505.

So the environment variance is 0.505.

Now, the F2's variance is 5.10. The F2's variance is the variance of the F1s, but since F2 is the offspring of F1s, its variance is the average of the variances of the F1 parents plus the environment variance.

Wait, no. The F2's variance is the average of the variances of F1 parents plus the environment variance. Because F2 comes from F1 and F1, so each F1's parents are A and B. So the variance of F2 would be the average of F1 variances plus the environment variance. But wait, F1's variance is 1.80, so the average of F1 variances is 1.80. So F2's variance = 1.80 + σ²? But the given F2 variance is 5.10. So 1.80 + 0.505 = 2.305. That's not matching 5.10.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 variance is the sum of the variance due to genes (from F1 parents) and the environment variance.

Wait, the variance due to genes in F2 would be the average of the parents' variances. So the F2's variance is the average of F1's variances plus the environment variance. But F1's variance is 1.80, so average is 1.80. So 1.80 + 0.505 = 2.305. But the given F2 variance is 5.10, which is way bigger.

So perhaps I'm modeling this wrong. Another approach: The variance of F2 is the sum of the variances of the parents plus twice the covariance (if any). But without knowing the covariance, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the genetic variance and environmental variance.

Wait, another approach: the phenotypic variance of F2 includes the genetic variance and the environmental variance. So, the variance of F2 (5.10) would be equal to the genetic variance (which is the sum of the gene variances of the parents) plus the environmental variance. But in this setup, the parents are Strain A and Strain B, which are homozygous for their respective genes, so their parents' variances are the same as their gene variances (since they are homozygous and have no environmental influence when selfing). So the genetic variance in F2 would be the same as the sum of the genes in F1, which is (A and B's variances averaged) plus the environment variance. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation in F2 is the sum of the variances from the parents plus the environment variance. So:

F2 variance = (A's variance + B's variance)/2 + environment variance.

But according to the given data, F2's variance is 5.10. So:

5.10 = (1.43 + 1.16)/2 + σ² → (2.59)/2 = 1.295.

So, 1.295 + σ² = 5.10 → σ² = 5.10 - 1.295 = 3.805.

But earlier, when we looked at F1, we found that σ² (environment) is 0.505. Now, this is giving σ² as 3.805, which is a larger value. That doesn't seem to align. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. The formula for the variance of F2 is the average of the parents' variances plus the environment variance. Because F2 is the offspring of F1, which is a hybrid. So, the F2's variance is the average of A and B's variances plus the environment variance.

So, F2 variance = (s_A² + s_B²)/2 + σ².

Given F2 variance is 5.10, and s_A² is 1.43, s_B² is 1.16, so (1.43 + 1.16)/2 = 2.59/2 = 1.295.

So 5.10 = 1.295 + σ² → σ² = 5.10 -1.295 = 3.805.

But earlier, when we looked at F1, we found that σ² = 0.505. That's a different value. So maybe this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the F2 variance is the average of the parents' variances plus the gene variance. Because F1 is a hybrid, so its variance is the average of A and B's variances plus the environment variance. The F2's variance is the average of F1 variances plus the environment variance again. But F1's variance is 1.80, so the average F1 variance is 1.80, so F2 variance would be 1.80 + 0.505 = 2.305. But the given F2 variance is 5.10. So this doesn't add up.

Hmm, maybe the approach is incorrect. Let's think differently. The variance in F2 is the sum of the variances from each parent's genes plus the environmental variance.

Wait, perhaps each F2 plant's variance is the sum of the genes from both parents plus the environment. So, for F2, the genetic variance is the average of the parents' variances (since each parent's gene variance is fully passed on to the offspring, assuming no epistasis or other interactions), and the environmental variance is added. So the F2 variance would be the average of the parents' variances plus the environment variance.

So, F2 variance = (s_A² + s_B²)/2 + σ².

Given that, F2 variance = 5.10, and (s_A² + s_B²)/2 = (1.43 + 1.16)/2 = 1.295.

So, 5.10 = 1.295 + σ² → σ² = 3.805.

But when we looked at F1, we found that σ² is 0.505. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made an incorrect assumption. Let's re-examine the F1 variance. F1 is a hybrid of A and B, so its mean is (A + B)/2. The variance of F1 would be the average of A's and B's variances plus any interaction variance. The interaction variance is the same as the environment variance because the environment affects all phenotypic traits, including the hybrid.

So, F1 variance = (s_A² + s_B²)/2 + σ².

Wait, but in the given data, F1's variance is 1.80. Substituting the numbers:

1.80 = (1.43 + 1.16)/2 + σ² → 1.295 + σ² = 1.80 → σ² = 0.505.

So that's the environment variance.

Now, the F2 variance is the average of the parents' variances plus the environment variance. So F2 variance would be (s_A² + s_B²)/2 + σ² = 1.295 + 0.505 = 1.80. But the F2 variance is given as 5.10, which is way higher. So this doesn't add up.

Hmm. Maybe the F2's variance is the sum of all the variances from each parent's genes plus the environment? Or perhaps the gene variance is the sum of the parents' variances plus the environment variance.

Wait, the parents are A and B, each with their own gene variance. So the F2's gene variance would be the average of the parents' variances. So (1.43 + 1.16)/2 =1.295, and the environment variance is 0.505. So F2's variance would be the sum of the parents' gene variance (from F1) plus the environment variance. So 1.295 + 0.505 =1.80. But the given F2 variance is 5.10. So this approach isn't aligning.

Wait, perhaps the gene variance in F2 is the average of the parents' variances, and the environmental variance is 3.805 (from earlier calculation). So F2 variance would be 1.295 + 3.805 =5.10. That matches the given F2 variance. So, yes, that makes sense.

So, the variance due to genes in F2 is 1.295, and the environmental variance is 3.805. But wait, how does this tie back to the question?

The question is asking for the number of genes involved. So, each gene contributes to the variance. The variance due to genes is the sum of the variances of the individual genes. So, each gene's variance would be part of the total gene variance.

But wait, how many genes are involved? The data provided is for two strains, and the question is about the number of genes in the series. So perhaps each gene contributes to the gene variance, and the environment contributes the other variance.

Wait, wait. The total variance in F2 is the sum of the genetic variance (which is the sum of the gene variances) and the environmental variance. So, F2's variance (5.10) = sum of gene variances + environment variance (3.805).

So, sum of gene variances = 5.10 -3.805 =1.295.

But each gene contributes to this sum. So, the number of genes (let's call it 'n') multiplied by their individual variances would equal 1.295.

Assuming each gene contributes equally (i.e., same variance), then each gene has the same variance. Let's say each gene contributes a variance of (1.295)/n.

But without knowing the individual gene variances, we can't find 'n' directly. Wait, but the question says the variation is due to a specific number of polygenes. So perhaps each gene is additive, and each contributes the same amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of genes is the number of parents' alleles. Wait, that's probably not the case. Alternatively, the variance of the genes is the sum of the variances of the individual genes. For example, if you have 10 genes, each with variance 0.1295, then the sum would be 1.295.

But without knowing the individual gene variances, perhaps the question is referring to the number of genes based on the number of parents. Wait, each parent's alleles may represent multiple genes. For example, two alleles (A and a) can represent two genes (e.g., presence of gene A, presence of gene a). But that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, another approach: The number of genes can be determined by the number of different alleles present in the parents. For example, each parent has two alleles (A and B). So the number of genes would be 2 (from each parent). But that seems too simplistic, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I've also heard that the number of genes is determined by the number of parents' alleles. So, if each parent contributes 2 alleles, the total is 4 alleles. But that's not the way genes are counted. Because each gene would be represented by two alleles. So the number of genes would be the number of pairs of alleles. For example, two alleles (A and a) represent one gene (presence of gene A), two alleles (B and b) represent another gene (presence of gene B), etc.

So in the given data, each parent has two alleles (A and B). So each gene is represented by two alleles. Therefore, the number of genes in the parents' alleles would be the number of parents. Wait, no. Let me think: Parent A has alleles A and a (if it's a diploid), same with Parent B. So for each gene, you have two alleles (A and a) in Parent A, and two in Parent B. So the number of genes in the parents' genes would be 2 (gene A and gene B), but each gene has two alleles.

But perhaps the number of genes involved in the variation is equal to the number of parents' alleles divided by 2. So, for two parents each with two alleles, that's (2 * 2) / 2 = 2 genes. So the number of genes is 2. But none of the options are 2. The options are 5, 6, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of genes is the number of parents' alleles. Each parent has two alleles, so 2 parents have 4 alleles. But each gene is represented by two alleles, so the number of genes is 4/2=2. But again, the options don't have 2. 

Wait, perhaps another approach. The variance due to genes in F2 is given as 1.295 (from earlier calculation). The number of genes is the number of different alleles present in the parents, which is 2. But each gene's variance is the same as the allele's variance. So, if there are 2 genes, each with variance 0.6475, then the sum would be 2 * 0.6475 = 1.295. That makes sense. So the number of genes is 2, but the options don't include 2.

Wait, but perhaps in the question, each parent's alleles represent different genes. Each gene is represented by two alleles. So, for Parent A, which is homozygous for gene A, and Parent B, which is homozygous for gene B, each gene has two alleles. So the number of genes is 2.

But the options given are 5,6, etc., which are much larger. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the number of genes relates to the variance.

Wait, maybe each gene contributes a certain amount of variance, and the sum of their variances is the gene variance in F2. Let's say each gene has a variance of x. Then the number of genes n would be the total gene variance (1.295) divided by x. But without knowing x, it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps each gene's contribution is the same as the variance of the F1 parents. So, for each gene, the variance contributed is (s_A² + s_B²)/2 =1.295. So if there are n genes, each contributing 1.295/ n to the total gene variance. So the total gene variance would be n*(1.295/n) )= 1.295. Which we have.

But wait, the total variance in F2 is 5.10. How is this 5.10 related to the number of genes?

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try another approach. The question is about the number of genes involved in the variation among the two strains. So each gene is represented in the parents. So if each parent has two alleles for each gene, then the number of genes is 2 (as previously thought), but the options don't include 2. So perhaps each gene is represented by more than two alleles, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of genes involved in the variation, considering that each gene is represented by two alleles. So to find the number of genes, we can count the number of different alleles present in the parents.

Parent A has two alleles (A and a), Parent B has two (B and b). So the different alleles are A, a, B, b → four different alleles. But each gene is represented by two alleles. So the number of genes is 2.

But again, the options are 5,6, etc. So perhaps each gene is represented by three alleles, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, another way: the number of genes is the number of different pairs of alleles present in the parents. For example, Parent A has two alleles, A and a, which form one gene (presence of gene A). Parent B has two alleles, B and b, forming another gene (presence of gene B). So the number of genes is 2.

But the options are 5,6,7,8,9. So perhaps the question is considering more genes, perhaps each parent contributes more genes. Alternatively, perhaps each parent's alleles represent the presence of individual genes, so Parent A has two genes (A and a), Parent B has two genes (B and b), so the total number of genes is 4.

But again, the options don't have 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the number of genes in the F2 population as the number of genes in the parents. Since the F2 population's genetic variance is the sum of the parents' variances, perhaps each gene is represented by one allele in each parent. So, if each parent has two alleles (A and a) for each gene, then the number of genes is 2.

But I'm still not matching the options. Another approach: The number of genes in the series (which is the variation among the two strains) is the number of genes represented by the parents. Since each parent is a diploid with two alleles, and each gene is represented by two alleles, the number of genes is 2.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the options given.

Options are:

A)5

B)6

C)7

D)8

E)9

So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each gene contributes the same to the gene variance, and the F2 variance is the sum of the parents' gene variances plus the environment variance.

Wait, perhaps the total number of genes is the number of genes in the parents, which is two. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, another thought: The total number of genes involved in the variation among the two strains would be the number of genes present in the parents. Each parent has two alleles per gene. So, for each gene, you have two alleles. So, if you have n genes, each represented by two alleles, then the number of parents is n.

But in this case, the parents are A and B, each with two alleles. But the question is about the number of genes in the series. So perhaps the number of genes is the same as the number of parents, which is 2. But the options don't include 2.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene is represented by one allele in each parent, so the number of genes is equal to the number of parents. So, two genes.

But the options are 5,6, etc. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each parent is a diploid with two genes, and each gene is represented by one allele in each parent. So, for Parent A, which has two genes, and Parent B, which also has two genes. So the total number of genes is 4.

But the options don't have 4. Alternatively, perhaps each gene is represented by two alleles in each parent. So, Parent A has two genes (A and a), and Parent B has two genes (B and b). So, the number of genes is 4.

But again, the options don't have 4.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of genes involved in the variation, considering that each gene is represented by two alleles in each parent. So, for each gene, you have two parents contributing two alleles. So the number of genes is the number of such pairs.

Wait, perhaps the number of genes is 2, but the options start at 5. So, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach.

Looking back at the data:

Each parent has two alleles. Parent A: A and a. Parent B: B and b.

So, the different alleles are A, a, B, b. So that's four different alleles. But each gene is represented by two alleles. So, the number of genes is 2.

But I'm still not matching the options. So perhaps the question is considering that each parent is a diploid with two genes, but each gene is represented by two alleles. So, for example, Parent A is A and a (for gene A), and B and b (for gene B). So, the number of genes is two.

But again, the options don't have 2.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that each gene is represented by three alleles. But that would not make sense because each gene is represented by two alleles.

Alternatively, perhaps each parent is a heterozygote for multiple genes. For example, Parent A is AaBb, which represents two genes (A and B). Similarly, Parent B is AaBb, which represents two genes (A and B). So, the number of genes is two in each parent.

But the question is about the variation between the two strains, so the number of genes would be two. But again, the options don't have 2.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the number of genes involved in the variation among the two strains. The variation is due to a specific number of polygenes. So, each polygene contributes a certain amount of variance.

Wait, perhaps each gene contributes the same amount of variance. So, the total gene variance is the sum of all individual gene variances. So, the number of genes would be the total gene variance divided by the variance per gene.

But without knowing the individual gene variances, I can't find the number of genes.

Wait, but perhaps each gene's variance is the same as the variance of the F1 parents. Let's see.

The F1 parents have different variances for each gene. So, for example, in Parent A, the variance for gene A is (s_A² + s_B²)/2 =1.295. For gene B, it's 1.16. So, the variance for gene B in Parent A is 1.16, but the F1 variance is 1.80, which includes both genes.

Wait, perhaps each gene's variance is 1.16. So, each gene in Parent A has a variance of 1.16. So, the number of genes is the total gene variance divided by 1.16.

Total gene variance is 1.295 (from F1 parents). So, 1.295 /1.16 ≈ 1.116. So, approximately 1.116 genes. But that doesn't make sense because the number of genes must be an integer.

So perhaps each gene's variance is 1.16, and the total gene variance is 1.295. So, the number of genes would be 1.295 /1.16 ≈ 1.116, which is not an integer. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps each gene's variance is 0.505, as per the F1 variance. So, F1 variance is 1.80, which includes the average of the two genes' variances. So, each gene's variance would be (1.295 * 2) /2 = 1.295. So, each gene's variance is 1.295. So, the number of genes would be the total gene variance (1.295) divided by each gene's variance (1.295) → 1 gene. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of it differently. The question is about the number of genes involved in the variation between the two strains. So, each gene contributes a certain amount of variance. The variation is the sum of the variances from each gene.

In F2, the genetic variance is the sum of the variances from each gene. So, the number of genes is the number of genes in the parents, which is two (since each parent has two alleles, and each gene is represented by two alleles). But the options start at 5. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each gene is represented by three alleles. For example, each parent has three alleles for each gene. But in a diploid, you can't have three alleles. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene is represented by two alleles, but these are inherited from one parent. For example, Parent A gives one allele to each gene, and Parent B gives another. So, the number of genes is two, but each gene is represented by one allele from each parent. So, the number of genes is two.

But I'm still not matching the options. Maybe I should consider that each gene is represented by two alleles, and each allele contributes the same to the gene variance. So, each gene contributes a certain amount of variance. The number of genes would be the total gene variance divided by the variance per gene.

So, the total gene variance is 1.295. Let's say each gene's variance is x. So, the number of genes is 1.295/x. But we don't know x.

Hmm, perhaps each gene's variance is the same as the F1 parents' variances. For example, each gene in Parent A has variance 1.16, and each gene in Parent B has variance 1.16 as well. So, the total gene variance is 1.295. So, the number of genes is 1.295 /1.16 ≈ 1.116, which is not an integer.

Wait, perhaps each gene's variance is 0.505, as per the F1 variance. So, the number of genes would be 1.295 /0.505 ≈ 2.56. So, approximately 2.56 genes. But that's not possible, as genes are whole numbers.

So, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should think of the number of genes as the number of genes in the parents' alleles, which is two, but the options don't have 2. So, perhaps the question is considering that each gene is represented by three alleles, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene is represented by two alleles in each parent, leading to four genes, but again, the options don't have 4.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that each parent has two genes, each represented by two alleles. So, Parent A: two genes, each represented by two alleles (A and a). Parent B: two genes, each represented by two alleles (B and b). So, the total number of genes is four. But the options don't have 4.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to think of the answer in terms of the given options. The options are 5,6,7,8,9.

I think I'm missing a key insight here. Let's try to model this.

Assume that each gene contributes a certain amount of variance. The total variance in F2 is the sum of the variances from the genes plus the environmental variance.

So, F2's variance (5.10) = sum of gene variances + environment variance (3.805).

The sum of gene variances is 5.10 -3.805 =1.295.

Now, the number of genes involved is the number of genes in the parents' alleles. Each parent has two alleles per gene. So, for two parents, the number of genes is 2.

But that's not matching the options. So, perhaps each parent has more genes.

Wait, perhaps each parent is a trihybrid (has three genes), but in this case, each parent has two genes. So, Parent A has two genes, each with two alleles (A and a). Similarly, Parent B has two genes, each with two alleles (B and b). So, the total number of genes is four.

But the options don't have 4. So, perhaps each gene is represented by three alleles, but that's not possible in a diploid.

Wait, perhaps each gene is represented by two alleles in each parent, so Parent A has two genes (A and B), each with two alleles (A and a, B and b). Similarly, Parent B has two genes (A and B), each with two alleles (A and a, B and b). So, the total number of genes is four.

But the options still don't have 4. So, perhaps the question is considering that each parent has three genes, but each gene is represented by two alleles. So, Parent A has three genes (A, B, C), each with two alleles (A and a, B and b, C and c). Similarly, Parent B has three genes (A, B, C). So, the number of genes is 3 * 2 =6.

Ah, that makes sense. So, Parent A has three genes, each with two alleles (A and a, B and b, C and c). Similarly, Parent B has three genes. So, the total number of genes is 3 * 2 =6. So, the answer is option B)6.

Wait, but let me double-check. If each parent has three genes, each represented by two alleles, then Parent A has six alleles (three genes, two alleles each). Similarly, Parent B has six alleles. So, the number of genes is 3 for each parent, but since the question is about the variation between the two strains, perhaps the number of genes is 6.

But wait, another way: each gene is represented by two alleles in each parent, so each parent has two genes (A and B), each with two alleles. So, Parent A has four alleles (two genes, each two alleles). But each gene is represented by two alleles. So, if Parent A has two genes, each with two alleles, then the number of genes is two, but each gene is represented by two alleles. So, the number of genes is two, but each gene is represented by two alleles.

So, for Parent A, each gene has two alleles (A and a, B and b). So, the number of genes is two. Similarly, Parent B has two genes. So, the number of genes is two. But the options don't have 2.

Hmm, perhaps each gene is represented by three alleles, but that's not possible in a diploid. So, perhaps each gene is represented by two alleles per parent, so each parent has two genes, each represented by two alleles. So, the number of genes is two. But the options don't have 2.

Alternatively, perhaps each parent has three genes, each represented by two alleles. So, Parent A has three genes, each represented by two alleles (A and a). Similarly, Parent B has three genes, each represented by two alleles (B and b). So, the number of genes is three for each parent. But the question is about the variation between the two strains, so perhaps the number of genes is six (3 from each parent). So, the options would have 6 as option B.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the number of genes involved is six.
</think>

The variation between the two strains is due to a specific number of polygenes. Each polygene contributes a certain amount of variance. The total number of genes involved is determined by the number of genes in the parents' alleles. Each parent has three genes, each represented by two alleles (e.g., A and a, B and b, C and c). Therefore, the number of genes is 3 for each parent, but since the question is about the variation between the two strains, the total number of genes is six (3 from each parent).

ANSWER: B)6
