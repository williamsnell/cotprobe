Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a solution containing Zn²+ and Cu²+ ions. Both are at 0.02 M each. Then, H3O+ is made 1M, and H2S is bubbled in until the solution is saturated. The question is whether a precipitate will form. The Ksp values for ZnS is 1e-22, CuS is 8e-37, and the H2S-saturated equilibrium constant is 1e-22.

The options are A to J, each suggesting a different precipitation outcome. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when a solution is saturated with a sulfide salt (like H2S), it can form a precipitate if the sulfide concentration exceeds the solubility product (Ksp). The Ksp for H2S is given as 1e-22. So, H2S's Ksp is 1e-22. Wait, but the solution is made 1M in H3O+ and H2S is bubbled in until it's saturated. Hmm, so the sulfide ions from H2S will be in solution.

But wait, when H2S is bubbled into solution, it dissociates into 2H+ and S²-. The H+ from the H3O+ is already present. So, the sulfide concentration in solution will depend on the concentration of H+ ions.

Wait, the problem states that the solution is made 1M in H3O+ and H2S is bubbled in until it's saturated. So, initially, the solution has 1M H+ (from H3O+). Then, H2S is added until it's saturated. The K_eq for H2S when it's saturated is given as 1e-22.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. K_eq for H2S is the equilibrium between H2S, 2H+, and S²-.

So, the reaction is H2S ↔ 2H+ + S²-.

The K_eq is given as 1e-22.

So, K_eq = [H+]^2 [S²-] / [H2S] = 1e-22.

But the solution is made 1M in H3O+ (so H+ is 1M), and H2S is bubbled until it's saturated. So, when it's saturated, the [H+] is 1M, and [H2S] is 1M (assuming it's saturated), but the sulfide concentration from H2S would be determined by the K_eq.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the sulfide concentration in the solution after adding H2S until it's saturated.

Wait, the K_eq is 1e-22, which is [H+]^2 [S²-] / [H2S] = 1e-22.

So, when the solution is made 1M in H3O+ and H2S is bubbled until it's saturated, the [H+] is 1M, and the [H2S] is 1M. So substituting into K_eq:

(1)^2 * [S²-] / 1 = 1e-22 → [S²-] = 1e-22 M.

Wait, but wait, [S²-] is from the dissolution of H2S. But that's the sulfide concentration from the H2S. So, in the solution, the total sulfide concentration is [H2S] + [S²-], but for the Ksp, it's [H2S] [S²-]^2, since each H2S gives 2 H+ and 1 S^2-. Wait, no. Wait, when H2S dissociates, it gives 2H+ and 1 S²-. So for each mole of H2S, you get 2 H+ and 1 S²-.

So, the solubility product Ksp for H2S would be [H+]^2 [S²-]. Because H2S is a weak acid, but in this case, it's acting as a base (sulfide ion is the conjugate base). So the solubility product is [H+]^2 [S²-] = K_sp.

Wait, Ksp for H2S is given as 1e-22. But in reality, H2S is a weak acid, but in solution, it's the S²- that can precipitate. So the Ksp is [H+]^2 [S²-] = 1e-22.

Wait, wait, but the problem says that when H2S is bubbled in until the solution is saturated, the K_eq for H2S is 1e-22. Hmm, perhaps I should think about which ions are present and their concentrations.

Wait, in the solution, we have H3O+ (1M) and H2S (so [H+] is 1M, and H2S is 1M because it's saturated). So the sulfide concentration comes from the dissociation of H2S.

So, [S²-] = (K_eq * [H+]^2) / [H2S] → (1e-22 * (1)^2 ) / 1 → 1e-22 M.

But wait, that's the concentration of S²- from H2S. But if you have other sources, like the solutions of Zn²+ and Cu²+, they can react with S²- to form their respective sulfides.

So, for each ion, the sulfide concentration would be determined by the Ksp.

Wait, but Zn²+ and Cu²+ are present, each at 0.02 M. So, for each, the sulfide concentration would be:

For Zn²+:
[Zn²+][S²-] = Ksp_zn → 0.02 * [S²-] = 1e-22 → [S²-] = 1e-24 M.

For Cu²+:
[Cu²+][S²-] = Ksp_cu → 0.02 * [S²-] = 8e-37 → [S²-] = 4e-35 M.

Wait, so the sulfide concentration from the sulfide of H2S is 1e-22 M. But the sulfide from Zn²+ and Cu²+ is 1e-24 and 4e-35, respectively.

But wait, in solution, the sulfide comes from H2S, Zn²+ (as ZnS), and Cu²+ (as CuS). So the total sulfide concentration in solution is the sum of their individual contributions. But wait, no—because each contributes to the pH, and the sulfides are in equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps the key is to determine whether the sulfide concentration from each ion (like ZnS and CuS) exceeds their Ksp, leading to precipitation.

Wait, but the solution is 1M H3O+ and H2S is bubbled until it's saturated. So the [S²-] in solution is primarily from the H2S. But the presence of Zn²+ and Cu²+ will affect the solubility of their sulfides. So, for each, the sulfide concentration from the metal sulfide must be considered.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the sulfide concentration from the H2S is 1e-22 M, and from Zn²+ and Cu²+, it's 1e-24 and 4e-35 M. But wait, that can't be right because in solution, the sulfide concentration from each is determined by their own Ksp, given the [H+] and the concentration of the metal ion.

Wait, but [H+] is 1M, as the solution is made 1M in H3O+.

So, for Zn²+:

[Zn²+] = 0.02 M.

Ksp_zn = [Zn²+][S²-] = 1e-22 → [S²-] = 1e-24 M.

For Cu²+:

[Cu²+] = 0.02 M.

Ksp_cu = [Cu²+][S²-] = 8e-37 → [S²-] = 4e-35 M.

So, the sulfide from Zn²+ is 1e-24 M and from Cu²+ is 4e-35 M. Wait, but wait, the total sulfide in solution would be the sum of all the sulfides.

But perhaps another approach: each sulfide ion can precipitate from the metal ions. So, the sulfide concentration from each metal will determine if precipitation occurs.

Wait, but in solution, the sulfide concentration from H2S is 1e-22 M. So, if the sulfide from each metal is less than their Ksp, then they would not precipitate. Wait, but the sulfide from the metal sulfides is a separate consideration.

Wait, perhaps the sulfide concentration in solution is not just from H2S, but the sum of all the sulfides, but that's probably negligible compared to the H2S's sulfide concentration. Because H2S is a strong acid in some cases, but sulfide is a weak base.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominant sulfide in solution is from H2S, and the other sulfides (from Zn and Cu) are less significant, especially since their Ksp is much lower.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the formation of each sulfide. Let me consider which sulfides would precipitate.

For ZnS: Ksp is 1e-22. The sulfide concentration from H2S is 1e-22 M. So, [S²-] (from H2S) is 1e-22 M. The sulfide from Zn²+ is 1e-24 M. Wait, but in solution, the sulfide is a mix of H2S's sulfide and the sulfide of Zn and Cu.

Wait, perhaps the total sulfide concentration is the sum of the sulfides from each, but that's not correct because the sulfides are all in equilibrium. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfide concentration is determined by the H2S activity.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the sulfide concentration in solution and compare it to the Ksp of each sulfide.

Wait, considering that in solution, the sulfide concentration is primarily from H2S. So [S²-] = 1e-22 M.

But wait, when you have both Zn²+ and Cu²+ in solution, the sulfide ions will react to form their respective sulfides. So, the sulfide concentration in solution is a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the concentrations of each metal sulfide. Let me think: each metal sulfide would form until the sulfide concentration reaches the Ksp.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the H2S's sulfide concentration is 1e-22 M, but the sulfide from the metal may be lower.

Wait, maybe we can model this.

Let me think about each metal's potential to form a sulfide precipitate.

For Zn²+:

The sulfide concentration from Zn²+ is [S²-] = Ksp_zn / [Zn²+] = 1e-22 / 0.02 ≈ 5e-21 M.

Similarly, for Cu²+:

[S²-] = Ksp_cu / [Cu²+] = 8e-37 / 0.02 = 4e-35 M.

So, the sulfide concentration from the metal sulfides is much lower (5e-21 for Zn and 4e-35 for Cu) compared to the sulfide from H2S (1e-22).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. H2S's sulfide concentration is 1e-22 M, which is the highest among them. If the sulfide from the metal sulfides is lower, then the sulfide from H2S dominates.

Wait, but wait, maybe that's not the correct way to calculate because the sulfide from each metal sulfide is in equilibrium with the solution's [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfide concentration from each metal is Ksp divided by [metal], but considering that H+ affects the sulfide concentration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. So, perhaps I should think about precipitation.

Each metal will attempt to form a sulfide precipitate until the sulfide concentration in solution meets the Ksp. So, the sulfide ion concentration in solution will be determined by the H2S.

But wait, the H2S is reacting with the metal ions until the sulfide concentration in solution is low enough.

Wait, but the solution already has H2S, so the sulfide concentration is determined by the H2S activity. So, [S²-] is 1e-22 M.

So, for each metal:

Zn²+ will form ZnS if [S²-] > Ksp_zn. Since [S²-] is 1e-22, which is less than 1e-22? Wait, the Ksp for ZnS is 1e-22. So, if [S²-] is 1e-22, it's exactly equal to the Ksp. So, the solution is at equilibrium and no precipitation occurs.

Wait, but wait, the sulfide concentration is 1e-22, which is the same as the Ksp. So, that suggests that no precipitation would occur because when [S²-] = Ksp, the solution is saturated and no more ZnS would precipitate.

Similarly for CuS: Ksp is 8e-37. [S²-] is 1e-22, which is much higher than CuS's Ksp. So, [S²-] is way above CuS's Ksp. So, CuS would precipitate.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the sulfide concentration from H2S is 1e-22, which is higher than the Ksp of both ZnS and CuS. So, ZnS would be at equilibrium (no precipitation), and CuS would precipitate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that ZnS's Ksp is 1e-22 and [S²-] in solution is 1e-22. So, if [S²-] = Ksp, the solution is saturated and no more ZnS would precipitate.

So, when CuS is added, its Ksp is 8e-37, which is much lower than the [S²-] in solution (1e-22). So, [S²-] > Ksp → CuS would precipitate.

Wait, but what about the sulfide concentration from Zn²+? Because, in solution, Zn²+ and Cu²+ ions could react with H2S to form ZnS and CuS, respectively, which in turn will affect the sulfide concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concentrations of Zn²+ and Cu²+ in solution.

Wait, when H2S is bubbled into solution, it can act as a base, pulling H+ from the solution. As a result, the sulfide ions from H2S can precipitate as sulfides. But the presence of the sulfide ions from Zn²+ and Cu²+ (the metal sulfides) will further affect the solution's pH and the sulfide concentration.

Wait, perhaps the H2S is adding sulfide ions that react with Zn²+ and Cu²+ to form their sulfides, thereby reducing the sulfide concentration available for other reactions.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.

1. The solution is made 1M H3O+ and 1M H2S bubbled until it's saturated.

2. So, the solution's sulfide concentration from H2S is determined by K_eq. K_eq is 1e-22, which is [H+]^2 [S²-] / [H2S] = 1e-22. Since [H+] is 1M, [S²-] is (1e-22 * [H2S])/ (1M^2) ) → [S²-] = 1e-22 [H2S]. But since it's saturated, [H2S] = 1M. So, [S²-] = 1e-22 M.

3. Now, considering the presence of Zn²+ and Cu²+.

4. The sulfide ions from Zn²+ and Cu²+ will precipitate if [S²-] < Ksp (since Ksp is the product of [metal] and [S²-], and if [S²-] is lower than Ksp, precipitation occurs).

5. For Zn²+:

[Zn²+] = 0.02 M.

If the sulfide concentration [S²-] is less than Ksp_zn (1e-22), precipitation will occur.

Because [S²-] is 1e-22, which is exactly equal to Ksp_zn. So, no precipitation occurs for ZnS.

6. For Cu²+:

Ksp_cu = 8e-37.

[S²-] is 1e-22, which is way higher than Ksp_cu. So, CuS will precipitate.

Wait, but wait, the sulfide concentration in solution is 1e-22, which is exactly the Ksp of ZnS. So, when you add H2S, the solution reaches a state where ZnS is at equilibrium. So, no further precipitation of ZnS occurs.

So, the precipitate would be CuS, because CuS has a much lower Ksp than ZnS, and the sulfide concentration in solution is higher than CuS's Ksp.

Wait, but I'm confused now. Because according to the previous calculation, the sulfide concentration from H2S is 1e-22, which is equal to the Ksp of ZnS. So, any additional H2S would increase the sulfide concentration, but if the solution's [S²-] is equal to the Ksp, no more ZnS would form.

Wait, but the solution is made 1M in H3O+ and H2S is bubbled until it's saturated. So, at that point, the solution's [H2S] is 1M, [H+] is 1M, and [S²-] is 1e-22.

So, with that, when adding Zn²+ and Cu²+:

The sulfide concentration from the solution's H2S is 1e-22.

Wait, but the sulfide concentration from the metal sulfides would be Ksp_metal / [metal].

So, for Zn²+: [S²-] = 1e-22 / 0.02 = 5e-21 M.

For Cu²+: [S²-] = 1e-22 / 0.02 = 5e-21 M.

Wait, but that can't be correct because in reality, the sulfide concentration from each metal sulfide is determined by their own Ksp in solution.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the sulfide as a product of both the metal sulfides and the H2S. So, the sulfide concentration is the sum of sulfide from H2S, ZnS, and CuS.

But that's probably not correct because sulfide is a conjugate base, and each metal sulfide is a separate equilibrium.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the sulfide concentration is determined by the H2S, and the metal sulfides are in equilibrium with the solution, but their sulfide concentrations are negligible compared to the H2S's.

Wait, but that can't be the case because the formation of ZnS and CuS would affect the solution's pH, and the sulfide concentration from each metal sulfide would be determined by the solution's [H+].

Wait, perhaps I should use the Nernst equation for each metal sulfide.

The Nernst equation for a metal's sulfide is:

E = E° - (RT)/(nF) ln Q.

But in this case, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equilibrium expression.

For each metal, the sulfide concentration is determined by the equilibrium between the metal ion and the sulfide.

So, for Zn²+:

Zn²+ + S²- ↔ ZS²- (wait, no, that's not right. The correct reaction is Zn²+ + 2 OH- ↔ Z(OH)₂ (precipitate) plus H2O. But in this case, we're dealing with H2S and the sulfide ions.)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.

The solution is 1M H3O+ and 1M H2S bubbled until it's saturated. So, [H2S] = 1M, [H+] = 1M.

The sulfide concentration from H2S is [S²-] = (K_eq * [H+]^2) / [H2S] ) → (1e-22 * 1) / 1 = 1e-22 M.

Now, when Zn²+ is added, it can react with H2S to form ZnS. Similarly, Cu²+ can react with H2S to form CuS.

The Q for each reaction would be:

For ZnS:

Q = [Zn²+][S²-] / ( [H2S] )

Since in solution, [H2S] is 1M (because it's saturated), and after adding Zn²+, the [Zn²+] is 0.02 M.

Wait, but adding Zn²+ would increase the [Zn²+], which could affect the Q for ZnS.

Wait, perhaps the Ksp for ZnS is 1e-22, and the Q would be ([Zn²+][S²-]) / ( [H2S] ) ).

If Q < Ksp, precipitation occurs.

But in solution, [H2S] is 1M, and [S²-] is 1e-22 M.

So, Q = (0.02 * 1e-22 ) / 1 = 2e-24.

Wait, but Ksp for ZnS is 1e-22. So, 2e-24 is much less than 1e-22. So, for ZnS, Q < Ksp → precipitation occurs.

Wait, but earlier I thought that [S²-] is exactly equal to Ksp, so no precipitation. But this calculation shows that [S²-] is 1e-22, but when Zn²+ is added, the product [Zn²+][S²-] is 2e-24, which is less than Ksp (1e-22), so precipitation occurs.

Wait, so this suggests that ZnS will precipitate because Q < Ksp.

But earlier I thought that [S²-] is 1e-22, which is equal to Ksp, so no precipitation. That's a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that when Zn²+ is added, it reacts with the sulfide ions from H2S to form ZnS.

Wait, but in solution, the sulfide concentration from H2S is 1e-22 M, and the sulfide from Zn²+ is 1e-24 M. So, adding Zn²+ would increase the [Zn²+], which would reduce the available sulfide in solution for CuS.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused.

Perhaps I should look for the Ksp of the metal sulfides, considering the [H+] and the [S²-] from H2S.

Wait, let me think again.

When H2S is bubbled into solution, it reacts with H+ ions to form H2S.

But in this case, the solution is made 1M H3O+ and H2S is bubbled until it's saturated. So, [H2S] = 1M, [H+] = 1M.

The sulfide concentration in solution is [S²-] = (K_eq * [H+]^2 ) / [H2S] ) = (1e-22 * (1)^2 ) / 1 = 1e-22 M.

Now, when Zn²+ is added, the sulfide ions from Zn²+ will react with the sulfide ions from H2S.

So, the reaction would be:

Zn²+ + S²- ↔ ZnS(s)

Similarly, Cu²+ and S²- would react.

So, the sulfide ion concentration in solution is determined by the H2S.

But, when Zn²+ is added, it will consume some of the sulfide ions from H2S, which will affect the sulfide concentration from ZnS.

This is getting a bit complicated, so perhaps I should calculate the Q for each metal sulfide reaction.

For ZnS:

Q = [Zn²+][S²-] / ( [H2S] )

Initially, [S²-] is 1e-22, [Zn²+] is 0.02.

So, Q = (0.02)(1e-22) / 1 = 2e-24.

Compare to Ksp for ZnS, which is 1e-22. So, Q < Ksp → precipitation occurs.

For CuS:

Q = [Cu²+][S²-] / ( [H2S] )

Initially, [S²-] is 1e-22, [Cu²+] is 0.02.

So, Q = (0.02)(1e-22) / 1 = 2e-24.

Compare to Ksp for CuS, which is 8e-37. So, Q > Ksp → no precipitation.

Wait, but that suggests that CuS won't precipitate because Q > Ksp, but ZnS will.

But earlier I thought that [S²-] in solution is 1e-22, which is equal to Ksp for ZnS, so no precipitation.

Now, this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

The sulfide concentration in solution is 1e-22 M.

So, for each metal, we can calculate the [M][S] in solution.

For ZnS:

[M][S] = (0.02)(1e-22) = 2e-24.

Compare to Ksp (1e-22). So, 2e-24 < 1e-22 → ZnS will precipitate.

For CuS:

[M][S] = (0.02)(1e-22) = 2e-24.

Compare to Ksp (8e-37). So, 2e-24 > 8e-37 → CuS will not precipitate.

Wait, but according to this, ZnS would precipitate and CuS would not. But earlier I thought that [S²-] in solution is 1e-22, which is exactly equal to Ksp for ZnS, so no precipitation.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to find a different approach.

Let me think about the net ionic equations for each metal sulfide.

For ZnS:

Zn²+ + S²- ↔ ZnS(s)

For CuS:

Cu²+ + S²- ↔ CuS(s)

Now, the solubility of each metal sulfide depends on the [S²-] in solution.

So, the [S²-] in solution is determined by the H2S.

Now, when Zn²+ is added, it consumes some of the sulfide ions from H2S, which will affect the [S²-] for CuS.

But in this case, sulfide from Zn²+ isn't part of the H2S solution; it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction of H2S with Zn²+ and Cu²+.

H2S can act as a base, pulling H+ from the solution.

So, the reaction could be:

H2S + H+ ↔ H2O + S²-

Wait, but that's not the case. Actually, H2S is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely.

In reality, H2S reacts with H+ in the solution:

H2S + H+ ↔ H2O + S²-.

So, the H+ from the solution reacts with H2S to form water and S²-.

But in this case, H+ is coming from the solution, but the H2S is being bubbled into the solution, so the H2S is reacting with the H+ in the solution.

Wait, but that's a bit contradictory. Usually, H2S is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate much in solution, but when H+ is added, it can react with H2S.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

H2S + H+ ↔ H2O + S²-.

So, the H+ from the solution is consumed by H2S to form S²-.

So, when you add H2S to the solution, it reacts with the H+ to form S²-, which then reacts with metals to form their sulfides.

So, the sulfide ion concentration from H2S is determined by the H2S and the H+.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Perhaps I should think about the solution's pH.

When H2S is bubbled into solution, it reacts with H+ to form H2O and S²-.

But since H2S is a weak acid, it doesn't completely dissociate. So, the reaction is:

H2S ↔ H+ + HS^-

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka, which is low (since H2S is a weak acid).

So, the solution's pH is determined by the concentration of H+ and the equilibrium between H2S, H+, and HS^-.

If we add H2S, it reacts with H+ to form H2O and S²-.

But, the solution's pH can be adjusted by adding H2S, which pulls H+ from the solution.

But in this problem, the solution is made 1M H3O+ and 1M H2S bubbled until it's saturated. So, [H2S] = 1M, [H+] = 1M, and [S²-] is determined by the K_eq.

Now, when Zn²+ and Cu²+ are added, they will react with the sulfide ions from H2S and each other.

So, the sulfide ions from H2S are reacting with the Zn²+ and Cu²+.

So, the reaction would be:

Zn²+ + S²- ↔ ZnS(s)

Cu²+ + S²- ↔ CuS(s)

So, the [ZnS] and [CuS] will form based on the initial concentrations and the reaction.

But I'm not sure how to calculate this.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfide from H2S will react with Zn²+ and Cu²+ until the solution reaches a state where the sulfide concentration is exactly the Ksp of each metal sulfide.

But this is getting a bit too involved.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible precipitation.

Given that the sulfide concentration in solution is 1e-22 M.

Now, for ZnS:

If [Zn²+] * [S²-] = 0.02 * 1e-22 = 2e-24.

Compare to Ksp (1e-22). So, 2e-24 < 1e-22 → ZnS will precipitate.

For CuS:

0.02 * 1e-22 = 2e-24.

Compare to Ksp (8e-37). So, 2e-24 > 8e-37 → CuS will not precipitate.

So, precipitation of ZnS will occur, and CuS will not.

But earlier, I thought that [S²-] is exactly Ksp for ZnS, so no precipitation. That is incorrect.

In reality, when Zn²+ is added, it will cause the sulfide concentration from H2S to react with it, which will cause ZnS to precipitate.

The key here is that the sulfide concentration is determined by H2S, and when metals are added, they will react with the sulfide ions.

So, in this case, ZnS will precipitate, and CuS will remain in solution.

So, the answer would be that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not.

Looking at the options:

A: Precipitation of ZnS and CuS

B: Precipitation of ZnS

C: No precipitation

D: Precipitation of CuS

Hmm, the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not. So, the correct option would be B, but no, because option B says only ZnS forms.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are:

A: Precipitation of ZnS and CuS

B: Precipitation of ZnS

C: No precipitation

D: Precipitation of CuS

Wait, but according to my analysis, only ZnS precipitates. So, the correct answer is B.

Wait, but I thought that when Zn²+ is added, it would cause ZnS to precipitate. So, the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not.

So, option B is correct.

Wait, but the initial analysis said that [S²-] is 1e-22, which equals Ksp of ZnS, so no precipitation. But that's incorrect because when Zn²+ is added, it reacts with the sulfide ions from H2S, causing ZnS to precipitate.

So, the correct answer is that ZnS precipitates, and CuS remains in solution. So, option B is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have a choice that says only ZnS precipitates. They have option B as "precipitation of ZnS" and option D as "precipitation of CuS".

Wait, but wait, according to my analysis, only ZnS precipitates. So, the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the initial thought process suggested that when Zn²+ is added, it reacts with sulfide ions from H2S, causing ZnS to precipitate.

So, the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS remains in solution. So, the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Precipitation of ZnS and CuS

B: Precipitation of ZnS

C: No precipitation

D: Precipitation of CuS

So, the correct answer is B, because only ZnS precipitates.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that only ZnS precipitates, so option B is correct.

But let me think again. When Zn²+ is added, it reacts with sulfide ions from H2S to form ZnS, which precipitates. Similarly, Cu²+ would react with sulfide ions to form CuS, but since CuS's Ksp is much lower, it might precipitate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The sulfide concentration in solution is 1e-22 M.

When Zn²+ is added, it will react with sulfide ions from H2S, causing ZnS to precipitate.

Similarly, Cu²+ will react with sulfide ions to form CuS, but if the Ksp of CuS is lower, it may precipitate.

Wait, but in this case, when Zn²+ is added, it will precipitate ZnS, and CuS can precipitate, but the problem is that H2S is a strong acid and the solution is saturated, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not precipitate.

So, the correct option is B: Precipitation of ZnS.

Wait, but then why did I think earlier that [S²-] is 1e-22 M, which equals Ksp for ZnS, so no precipitation.

But that's incorrect because the sulfide ions from H2S are reacting with Zn²+ to form ZnS, which precipitates.

So, the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not. So, option B is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is "Precipitation of ZnS" only, but option A says both.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS remains in solution. So, option B is correct.

Wait, but I think that when Zn²+ is added, it reacts with sulfide ions from H2S to form ZnS, which precipitates. Similarly, Cu²+ reacts with sulfide ions to form CuS, but since CuS's Ksp is much lower, it may precipitate.

Wait, but no, because the solution is saturated, adding more Zn²+ and Cu²+ would shift the system, and the Ksp would mean that the precipitate would form.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that both ZnS and CuS precipitate.

But looking at the options, option A says both, option B says only ZnS, option D says only CuS.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the precipitation of ZnS and CuS based on their Ksp.

For ZnS, Ksp = 1e-22.

For CuS, Ksp = 8e-37.

When Zn²+ and Cu²+ are added, they will react with sulfide ions to form their respective sulfides.

The solubility of ZnS is determined by Ksp, and since Ksp is 1e-22, which is higher than CuS's Ksp (8e-37), ZnS will precipitate more than CuS.

Wait, but no, because the sulfide concentration is determined by H2S, and when Zn²+ is added, it reacts with sulfide ions to form ZnS, which precipitates. Similarly, Cu²+ reacts with sulfide ions to form CuS, but since CuS's Ksp is lower, it may precipitate more than ZnS.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that both ZnS and CuS precipitate, so option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm not confident now. I think the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the Ksp of the metal sulfides.

Looking up, the Ksp for CuS is approximately 8.0×10^-37, and Ksp for ZnS is approximately 1.1×10^-22.

So, Ksp of ZnS is larger than Ksp of CuS. So, when adding Zn²+ and Cu²+ to the solution, the ZnS will precipitate more than CuS.

Wait, no, because the sulfide concentration is determined by H2S, and when adding metals, they will react with the sulfide ions to form the metal sulfides.

So, the metal sulfides with higher Ksp will precipitate first.

So, ZnS has a higher Ksp than CuS, so ZnS will precipitate before CuS.

Therefore, a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not precipitate.

Wait, but no, because when adding Cu²+ to the solution, the sulfide ions in solution will react with the Cu²+ to form CuS. But since the Ksp of CuS is lower, perhaps it will precipitate.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS remains in solution.

So, the answer is option B: Precipitation of ZnS.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS remains in solution.

So, the correct answer is B: Precipitation of ZnS.

Wait, but perhaps CuS also precipitates because the sulfide concentration is low enough.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solubility.

The solubility of ZnS is determined by Ksp. If Ksp is higher, the solubility is higher.

Since Ksp of ZnS is higher than CuS, ZnS will precipitate more than CuS.

But wait, no, because the sulfide concentration is determined by H2S. So, when adding Zn²+ and Cu²+, they will react with the sulfide ions, causing ZnS and CuS to precipitate.

So, perhaps both ZnS and CuS precipitate, which would be option A.

But I'm not sure. I think I need to make a decision.

Given that, I think the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not. So, option B is correct.

Wait, but in reality, when adding metals to a solution with a sulfide, the sulfide will react with the metal to form the metal sulfide, and the reaction will proceed until the metal sulfide reaches its solubility limit, which depends on the Ksp.

So, in this case, the Ksp of ZnS is higher than that of CuS, so ZnS will precipitate before CuS.

Therefore, the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not.

So, option B is correct.

Wait, but no, option B says only ZnS forms.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

I think the correct answer is that both ZnS and CuS precipitate. So, option A is correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, ZnS's Ksp is higher, so it should precipitate first.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the dissolution process.

The dissolution of ZnS can be written as:

ZnS(s) ⇌ Zn(s) + S(s)

The equilibrium constant for this process is K_sp = [Zn][S]/K_sp = 1e-22 / 1e-22 = 1.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the dissolution process is:

ZnS(s) ⇌ Zn(s) + S(s)

The equilibrium constant for this process is K_sp = (Ksp for ZnS)/ (Ksp for CuS) ?

Wait, no, the dissolution is:

ZnS(s) ⇌ Zn(s) + S(s)

The equilibrium constant is K_sp = (Ksp for ZnS) / (Ksp for CuS).

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing it up.

Alternatively, perhaps the dissolution is:

ZnS(s) ⇌ Zn(s) + S(s)

The equilibrium constant is K_sp = (Ksp for ZnS) / (Ksp for CuS).

But perhaps I'm not getting anywhere.

In any case, considering the Ksp values, ZnS has a higher Ksp, so it will dissolve more than CuS.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not precipitate.

So, option B is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

In any case, I think the correct answer is that a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not. So, option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the precipitation of metal sulfides (ZnS and CuS) in a solution where the sulfide concentration is determined by the reaction of H₂S with H+ ions. The key steps and analysis are as follows:

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The solution contains 1M H3O+ (H+ ions) and 1M H2S (sulfide ions from H2S).  
   - The solution is saturated, meaning the concentration of H2S is much lower than the equilibrium constant for the reaction of H+ with H2S.  

2. **Reaction of H2S with H+**:  
   - The H+ ions from the solution react with H2S to form H2O and HS⁻:  
     \[
     \text{H}_2\text{S} + \text{H}^+ \leftrightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{HS}^-
     \]  
   - The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_{\text{H2S}} \), which is much less than 1, indicating that H2S is a weak acid and reacts with H+ ions to form H2O and HS⁻.

3. **Sulfide Concentration in Solution**:  
   - The sulfide concentration in the solution is determined by the reaction of H+ ions with H2S, not by the initial H2S concentration.  
   - Therefore, the initial H2S concentration is irrelevant to the sulfide concentration in solution.

4. **Reaction of Metal Sulfides with Sulfide**:  
   - When metal ions (Zn²+ and Cu²+) are added to the solution, they react with the sulfide ions (HS⁻) to form their respective metal sulfides (ZnS and CuS):  
     \[
     \text{Zn}^{2+} + \text{HS}^- \leftrightarrow \text{ZnS(s)} + \text{H}^+
     \]  
     \[
     \text{Cu}^{2+} + \text{HS}^- \leftrightarrow \text{CuS(s)} + \text{H}^+
     \]  
   - The reaction proceeds until the sulfide ions are consumed, and the metal sulfides reach their equilibrium concentrations determined by their Ksp values.

5. **Key Ksp Values**:  
   - The Ksp for ZnS is approximately \( 1.1 \times 10^{-22} \).  
   - The Ksp for CuS is approximately \( 8.0 \times 10^{-37} \).  
   - Since the Ksp of ZnS is larger than that of CuS, ZnS has a higher solubility and will precipitate more than CuS.

6. **Precipitation of ZnS**:  
   - Zn²+ reacts with H+ to form ZnS, which precipitates out of the solution.  
   - Cu²+ reacts with H+ to form CuS, but since the Ksp of ZnS is higher than that of CuS, ZnS will precipitate before CuS.  
   - Therefore, a precipitate of ZnS forms, and CuS does not precipitate.

7. **Final Answer**:  
   - The correct option is **B: Precipitation of ZnS**.
