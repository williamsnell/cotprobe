Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically about GNP (Gross National Product). I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that GNP is being measured, and non-productive transactions should not be included. I remember that GNP is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period. So, it includes both productive and non-productive activities.

Non-productive transactions are probably things that don't contribute to the production of goods or services. So, they might not be counted in GNP. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Transactions exclusively involving agricultural products. Well, that definitely is productive. So they should be included in GNP, so A is probably wrong.

Option B: Exports and imports of goods and services. Oh, wait, exports are goods and services sold to other countries, and imports are received from others. These are definitely part of a country's economy because they affect the local production. So B is probably not correct because the question says non-productive transactions should not be included, and these are part of the economy.

Option C: Consumer spending on durable goods. That's a form of consumption, which is part of a country's expenditure. So C is not correct because it's a productive transaction.

Option D: Government spending on infrastructure. That's definitely part of the economy. Infrastructure projects are necessary for anything except trivial stuff. So D is not the answer.

Option E: Investments in education and healthcare. These are government or non-profit sectors, but they contribute to the economy. So E isn't the answer.

Option F: Public and private transfer payments. Transfer payments are payments made by the government to citizens or to others for services. They're not part of the national income because they don't represent production. So F could be a candidate. But wait, the question is about non-productive transactions.

Option G: Sales of new manufactured goods and services. That's a thing. Like, when a company makes and sells products, those profits are counted. So G is a productive activity and should be included.

Option H: Wage payments and stock market transactions. Wages are part of labor, which is part of production. Stock market transactions are financial, not part of the production of goods and services. So H is non-productive, but wait, the question is about what non-productive transactions are. So if H is non-productive, but the question is asking what 'non-productive transactions' are, perhaps that's not the right way to see it. Or maybe F is the better option.

Option J: Pure financial transactions and second-hand sales. That's a mix of financial and non-productive, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Wait, the question says non-productive transactions should not be included. So what are non-productive transactions?

Looking back, F is public and private transfer payments. Transfer payments don't involve the production of goods or services but are part of the national income. Because they're not part of the production process. So option F is about non-productive transactions.

Wait, but I thought about option G which is about the production of goods. So G is a productive transaction, so it's included in GNP. So F is the correct answer.

Alternatively, let me think about what each option represents. The question is about non-productive transactions. Non-productive would be things that consume the goods and services but don't create them. So like, for example, if someone pays someone else for services, that's transfer payment and not counted as part of the national income. Or like, taking a transfer without the owner getting the product.

So F is public and private transfer payments, which are not part of the national income because they don't involve production. Hence, they should not be included in GNP computation.

Wait, but earlier I thought G was about the sale of new goods, which is included. So F is the correct answer.

The question asks about non-productive transactions that should not be included in GNP computation. Non-productive transactions are those that do not contribute to the production of goods or services. 

- **Option A**: Includes agricultural products, which are productive. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Exports and imports are part of the national economy as they affect production. Incorrect.
- **Option C**: Consumer spending on durable goods is part of consumption, a productive activity. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Government infrastructure projects are part of the economy. Incorrect.
- **Option E**: Investments in education and healthcare are government or non-profit sectors, contributing to the economy. Incorrect.
- **Option F**: Public and private transfer payments involve financial transactions that do not represent production. Correct, as they are non-productive.
- **Option G**: Sales of new manufactured goods and services are included in GNP. Incorrect.
- **Option H**: Wages and stock market transactions are part of production. Incorrect.
- **Option J**: While financial and second-hand sales are financial, they are not non-productive in the context of GNP.

The correct answer is **F: public and private transfer payments**, as these transactions are non-productive and not included in GNP computation.
