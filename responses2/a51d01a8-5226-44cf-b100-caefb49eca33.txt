Okay, so I need to find the determinant of the matrix A. The matrix is given as:

[[2, 4, 3],
 [3, 0, 1],
 [1, 2, 5]]

Hmm, I remember that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the general formula. I think the general formula is a bit involved, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try the rule of Sarrus because it's a bit easier for 3x3 matrices. Let me recall how that works. For matrix:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

The determinant using Sarrus is calculated by:

a*e*i + b*f*g + c*d*h
minus
c*d*i + b*e*g + a*f*h

Wait, maybe I should write it down more clearly. The formula is:

det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)

Let me assign each element to variables to make it easier. So:

a = 2, b=4, c=3
d =3, e=0, f=1
g=1, h=2, i=5

Plugging into the formula:

det(A) = 2*(0*5 - 1*2) -4*(3*5 -1*1) +3*(3*2 -0*1)

Calculating each part step by step.

First term: 2*(0*5 is 0, 1*2 is 2) → 0-2 = -2 → 2*(-2) = -4.

Second term: -4*(3*5 is 15, 1*1 is 1 → 15-1=14) → -4*14 = -56. Wait, no, wait: the formula is minus 4 times (15-1), which is 14. So -4*14 = -56.

Third term: 3*(3*2=6, 0*1=0 → 6-0=6) → 3*6=18.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check the formula. Oh, right! The formula is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg). So for each term, it's the coefficient multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each part step by step again.

First term: a*(e*i - f*h) → 2*(0*5 - 1*2) = 2*(0-2) = 2*(-2) = -4.

Second term: -b*(d*i - f*g) → -4*(3*5 -1*1) → -4*(15-1) → -4*14 = -56.

Third term: c*(d*h - e*g) → 3*(3*2 -0*1) → 3*(6-0) = 3*6=18.

Now, sum all three terms: (-4) + (-56) + 18 = (-60) +18 = -42.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the calculation gives me -42. Looking back at the options, option G is -42, so that's one of the choices.

Wait, did I do the calculations correctly? Let me check again.

a(ei - fh) → 2*(0*5=0, 1*2=2 → 0-2= -2) → 2*(-2) = -4.

Second term: -4*(d*i - f*g) → d is 3, i is 5, f is 1, g is 1. So 3*5=15, 1*1=1. 15-1=14. So -4*14 = -56.

Third term: 3*(d*h - e*g) → d=3, h=2 → 3*2=6. e*g=0*1=0. 6-0=6. 3*6=18.

Sum: -4 -56 +18 = (-60) +18= -42.

Hmm, that's -42, which is option G. But wait, shouldn't I double-check because sometimes I might mix up the signs. Let me recount.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the determinant using another method to confirm.

Another method: maybe row operations.

Wait, another way: perhaps expand along a different row or column. Let me try expanding along the first column.

The first column is [2, 3, 1]. So, the determinant would be:

2 * det(minor at 2) - 3 * det(minor at 3) + 1 * det(minor at 1)

Wait, the minor for 2 is the 2x2 matrix:

[0,1]
[2,5]

Its determinant is (0*5 - 1*2)=0-2=-2.

Minus 3 times the minor's determinant for the element 3: the minor there is:

[4,3]
[2,5]

Which is 4*5 -3*2=20-6=14. So, the second term is -3*14= -42.

Third term: 1 times the minor's determinant for element 1. The minor is:

[4,3]
[0,1]

Determinant is 4*1 -3*0=4. So, third term is 1*4=4.

Adding them up: 2*(-2) =-4. -42, and +4. So sum is (-4) + (-42) +4= (-46)+4= -42.

Same result. So determinant is -42. So option G.
</think>

The determinant of the matrix A is calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Both methods yield the same result, which is -42. Therefore, the correct answer is G: -42.

Answer: G
