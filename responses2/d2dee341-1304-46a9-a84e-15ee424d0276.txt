Alright, so I've got this problem here about quadratic equations. Let me read it again. It says: Let x₁ and x₂ be the roots of the equation x² + 3x + 1 = 0. I need to compute (x₁/(x₂ + 1))² + (x₂/(x₁ + 1))². The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 16 to 24.

Hmm, my first thought is to recall Vieta's formulas because the problem gives a quadratic equation, and Vieta's relates the sum and product of roots to the coefficients. So for a quadratic ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots x₁ + x₂ is -b/a, and the product x₁x₂ is c/a.

Here, the equation is x² + 3x + 1 = 0, so a=1, b=3, c=1. Thus, x₁ + x₂ = -3/1 = -3, and x₁x₂ = 1/1 = 1.

Okay, so the sum is -3 and the product is 1. 

Now, the expression I need to compute is (x₁/(x₂ + 1))² + (x₂/(x₁ + 1))². That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it step by step.

Let me denote the expression as E. So E = [x₁/(x₂ + 1)]² + [x₂/(x₁ + 1)]².

Hmm, perhaps I can find a way to express this in terms of x₁ + x₂ and x₁x₂. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term separately and then add them. Let's try that approach.

First, let's compute x₁/(x₂ + 1). Let me denote this term as A = x₁/(x₂ +1). Similarly, B = x₂/(x₁ +1).

So E = A² + B².

I know that A² + B² = (A + B)² - 2AB. Maybe that helps. Let me compute A + B and AB.

Wait, but before that, maybe I can find expressions for A + B and AB in terms of x₁ and x₂.

Let's compute A + B first. A + B = x₁/(x₂ +1) + x₂/(x₁ +1). To add these, I need a common denominator.

The denominators are (x₂ + 1) and (x₁ + 1). So the common denominator would be (x₂ + 1)(x₁ + 1).

So:

A + B = [x₁(x₁ + 1) + x₂(x₂ + 1)] / [(x₂ + 1)(x₁ + 1)]

Expanding the numerator: x₁² + x₁ + x₂² + x₂.

So numerator = (x₁² + x₂²) + (x₁ + x₂).

Denominator = (x₁x₂ + x₁ + x₂ + 1).

Hmm, let's compute numerator and denominator using Vieta's.

We know x₁ + x₂ = -3 and x₁x₂ = 1.

First, compute x₁² + x₂². I remember that (x₁ + x₂)² = x₁² + 2x₁x₂ + x₂². So x₁² + x₂² = (x₁ + x₂)² - 2x₁x₂.

Plugging in, that's (-3)^2 - 2*1 = 9 - 2 = 7. So x₁² + x₂² =7.

So numerator = 7 + (-3) = 4.

Denominator: x₁x₂ + x₁ + x₂ +1 = (1) + (-3) + 1 = (1+1) + (-3) = 2 -3 = -1.

So A + B = 4 / (-1) = -4.

Okay, so A + B = -4.

Now, let's compute AB. AB = [x₁/(x₂ +1)] * [x₂/(x₁ +1)].

AB = (x₁x₂) / [(x₂ +1)(x₁ +1)].

We know x₁x₂ =1. So AB =1 / [(x₂ +1)(x₁ +1)].

What's (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1)? Let's expand it: x₁x₂ + x₁ + x₂ +1. From earlier, x₁x₂ is 1, x₁ +x₂ is -3, so:

=1 + (-3) +1 = (1+1) + (-3) = 2 -3 = -1.

So AB = 1 / (-1) = -1.

So now, E = A² + B² = (A + B)^2 - 2AB.

Plugging in the values:

E = (-4)^2 - 2*(-1) = 16 + 2 = 18.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, (A + B) is -4, so (A + B)^2 is 16. Then 2AB is 2*(-1) = -2. So E = 16 - (-2) = 16 + 2 = 18.

Yes, E would be 18. Looking at the options, option H is 18.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make any mistake in calculations?

Let me double-check the steps.

1. Vieta's gives x₁ +x₂ = -3, x₁x₂=1.

2. A = x₁/(x₂ +1), B= x₂/(x₁ +1).

3. A + B = [x₁(x₁ +1) + x₂(x₂ +1)] / [(x₂ +1)(x₁ +1)].

   Numerator: x₁² + x₁ +x₂² +x₂.

   x₁² +x₂² = (x₁ +x₂)^2 - 2x₁x₂ = 9 -2=7. So 7+ (-3)=4.

   Denominator: (x₁x₂) +x₁ +x₂ +1 =1 + (-3) +1= -1.

   So A + B =4/(-1) =-4. Correct.

4. AB = (x₁x₂) / [(x₂ +1)(x₁ +1)].

   (x₂ +1)(x₁ +1) =x₁x₂ +x₁ +x₂ +1=1 + (-3) +1= -1.

   So AB =1 / (-1) =-1. Correct.

5. E= (A + B)^2 -2AB= (-4)^2 -2*(-1)=16 +2=18. Correct.

So the answer should be 18, which is option H.

But wait, looking back at the options, option H is 18. So, the correct answer is H.

The expression to compute is (x₁/(x₂ + 1))² + (x₂/(x₁ + 1))². Using Vieta's formulas, we find x₁ + x₂ = -3 and x₁x₂ = 1. By manipulating the expression, we find that E = 18, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
