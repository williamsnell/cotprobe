Okay, so I have this question about coping strategies. Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking what strategy Bu is using when she says she's late for appointments but thinks she has more important things on her mind. The options are A through H, including things like Projection, Avoidance, Denial, etc.

Hmm, I remember from school that there are various ways people cope with stress or negative emotions. I think Projection is when you project someone else's feelings onto yourself. Like, if you think about what someone else would feel, you might feel the same way.

But wait, in this case, Bu isn't projecting. She's saying she's late because she has more important things on her mind. That sounds more like denial. Denial is when you don't believe something because it's hard to accept it. So if she doesn't believe her appointment is a problem because she's not feeling it, that's denial.

Alternatively, maybe Avoidance is when you avoid something because you're scared. Bu is not avoiding; she's just saying she's late because of other things. So Avoidance doesn't fit here.

Projection is when you project someone else's feelings onto yourself. Like if I think about how someone else is feeling, I might feel the same way. Not sure, but Projection might not be the right fit here because Bu isn't projecting her own feelings onto others.

Denial is when you deny or avoid something because it's hard to accept. So Bu isn't avoiding, she's just saying she's late because of other matters. So Denial seems to fit.

Wait, but I should double-check the other options. Let's think about each one. Assimilation is about fitting into a group, which doesn't seem relevant here. Accommodation is when you change your behavior to fit someone else's expectations, which doesn't fit either.

Sublimation is when one's behavior changes to avoid a negative emotion. That doesn't fit here.

I think the best fit is Denial because Bu is denying that she's being late because of other things. She's saying she has more important things on her mind, so she's not accepting the situation as it occurs. She's not projecting, avoiding, or accommodating. So the answer should be Denial.

The correct answer is Denial. Bu denies that her being late is because of other important things, instead believing her appointment is a normal occurrence. Denial fits because she avoids the negative reality by denying it.
