Okay, so I've got this question about finding the dimension of a parallelepiped that's circumscribed by a sphere of radius R. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. 

So the question says the parallelepiped has maximum volume and is inscribed in a sphere. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, the parallelepiped is circumscribed by a sphere, meaning all its vertices lie on the sphere. So the sphere is the circumscribed sphere around the parallelepiped. That makes sense.

I remember that the maximum volume occurs when the parallelepiped is a cube. Because for a given sphere, the cube has the maximum volume among all rectangular boxes. But wait, is that the case here? Let me think. Oh, right, yes, for a given sphere, the cube will have the largest volume. So the parallelepiped should be a cube when the volume is maximized.

Wait, but wait. The sphere is circumscribed, so the cube's space diagonal would be equal to the sphere's diameter. The diameter is 2R. The space diagonal of a cube with side length a is a√3. So  a√3 = 2R → a = (2R)/√3. 

Wait, but wait, the question is about the dimension of the parallelepiped. The dimension refers to the length of the diagonals, right? Or is it the space diagonal? Hmm, no, wait. The question says "the dimension of the parallelepiped of maximum volume." The options are given as expressions of R, but the options are like 2R, 3R/sqrt(2), etc. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum volume in terms of R, but wait the options are in terms of dimensions, like 2R could be the space diagonal, but the options are all expressions of R with square roots.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back.

The parallelepiped is circumscribed by a sphere. So all eight vertices lie on the sphere. The sphere's radius is R, so the diameter is 2R. In a cube, the space diagonal is 2R. So for a cube, the side length a is 2R/√3. The space diagonal is 2R, but perhaps the question is asking for the dimension, which refers to the length of the space diagonal. So in this case, the space diagonal is 2R. But 2R is option J. But wait, the options are given as expressions like 2/sqrt(2) R, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, no, maybe the question is about the volume, not the diagonal. Let me read the question again: "Find the dimension of the parallelepiped of maximum volume circumscribed by a sphere of radius R." Hmm, the term "dimension" is a bit ambiguous. But perhaps they're referring to the edge length? Or maybe the diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum volume in terms of the sphere’s radius, and the dimension as in the length of the diagonal. Let me think again.

Wait, the sphere's radius is R, so the diameter is 2R. For a cube inscribed in a sphere, the space diagonal is 2R, so the edge length a is (2R)/√3. So the volume is a^3 = (8 R^3)/(3√3). But the question is about the dimension. Hmm, perhaps the diagonal is the dimension in question, which would be 2R. But that's not matching any of the options except J, which is 2R.

Wait, but looking at the options again, J is 2R, but I have to make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the edge length. Because in that case, the edge length would be (2R)/√3, which is option D. Wait, no, D is (3/√2) R. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up. Let me think differently. The parallelepiped that maximizes the volume is a cube. So the maximum volume occurs when the parallelepiped is a cube. The space diagonal of a cube is 2R, so space diagonal = 2R. So the dimension (the diagonal) is 2R, which is option J.

But wait, the options list 2R as option J. Then that would be the answer. But wait, let me check other options. If the parallelepiped were a regular tetrahedron, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another approach: for any parallelepiped inscribed in a sphere, the maximum volume is achieved when it's a cube. So, the space diagonal is 2R, which is the diameter. So the space diagonal is 2R, which is the dimension. So the answer is J: 2R.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the maximum possible volume of the parallelepiped, and the dimension of that cube. So if the sphere has radius R, the cube's space diagonal is 2R, so the edge length is (2R)/√3. But the options are in terms of R, so perhaps the dimension is 2R, which is the diagonal. So the correct answer is J: 2R.

The parallelepiped circumscribed by a sphere of radius R has maximum volume when it is a cube. The space diagonal of this cube equals the sphere's diameter, 2R. Therefore, the dimension (space diagonal) of the cube is 2R, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
