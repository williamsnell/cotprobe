Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about number representations and whether adding 109 and -42 fits within 8-bit words for three different systems: one's complement, two's complement, and sign and magnitude. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the question is about whether the addition of 109 and -42 is possible without causing an overflow in each representation. The options are combinations of these three methods. The choices are A to I, where I is none of the above.

Wait, let's break it down. I remember that in computers, different number systems have different ranges for 8-bit words. One's complement and two's complement can cause issues because they don't have a fixed number of bits for negative numbers, unlike two's complement which does have a fixed representation. Sign and magnitude uses a sign bit and zero, but that's not as commonly used these days.

So I'll need to consider each representation:

1. **One's complement**: This is an older way of representing negative numbers. It uses the complement to get the negative, but because it's a one's, adding 1 gives the negative. But for 8 bits, the range is from -128 to +127. Let me check if 109 and -42 can fit here. 109 is positive, 42 is positive, but in one's complement, the number's complement is 255-42=213, but wait, wait. Wait, in 8 bits, the range is from -128 to 127. So 109 is within 127, so that's okay. But the problem is, when you add 109 and -42, let's see what happens. Hmm, but wait, in one's complement, adding can cause overflow if the result is outside the 8-bit range. But wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the two's complement because that's the standard way to represent signed integers.

Wait, but the question is about the addition being within range. So let's compute 109 + (-42) = 67. Wait, but let's see if each representation allows for that.

2. **Two's complement**:
   In two's complement, 8 bits can represent from -128 to +127. Let's check 109 and -42. 109 is positive, which is within 0-127. -42 is within -128-0. So adding them should fit with no overflow. But wait, adding two numbers in two's complement can cause an overflow? Well, I think in two's complement, the maximum positive number is 127, the minimum is -128. So 109 is 0x6D (since 6*16 +13=109), and -42 in two's complement is 0xB2 (since 42 is 0x2A, invert and add 1: 0xA9 + 1 = 0xB0? Wait, maybe I'm getting the bits wrong. Wait, 42 in binary is 00101010, so invert: 11010101, which is 213 in decimal. Add 1: 214. But since it's 8 bits, 214 is 0x8E. So in two's complement, 109 is 0x6D, -42 is 0x8E. Adding them gives 0x6D + 0x8E = 0x153. Wait, 0x153 is 333 in decimal. But 333 is way beyond the 8-bit two's complement range (which is up to 127). So wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. 109 in binary is 109 → 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 → 1101101. As 8 bits, it's 01101101. But in two's complement, the positive numbers are 00000101101 for 8 bits? Wait, no, 8 bits are 0 to 7 bits. Wait, 109 is 0b1101101, which as 8 bits is 01101101. But perhaps I should think in 8-bit terms.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the maximum value for 8 bits. The maximum positive number is 0x7F (127). So 109 is within that. -42 is -42, which in two's complement is 0xB2 (since 42 is 0x2A, invert to 0xC1, add 1 is 0xB2). So 0xB2 is 178 in decimal. So adding 109 (109) and -42 (178 in decimal) would be 287. But wait, 287 is way beyond the 8-bit two's complement capacity (max is 127 for positive). So adding 109 and -42 in two's complement would cause an overflow, because 109 + (-42) = 67, which is within the 8-bit range, but wait, no: 109 is 0x6D, -42 is 0xB2. Let me compute 0x6D + 0xB2.

0x6D is 109, 0xB2 is 178. 109+178=287. But 287 in 8-bit two's complement is 0x0000127, which is way beyond 0x7F. So 287 is outside the 8-bit two's complement range (which can only go up to 0x7F which is 127). So in two's complement, adding 109 and -42 would cause an overflow. So the addition is not possible in two's complement.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question isn't about the absolute sum but about whether the representation allows for the sum without overflow. Maybe I should think about the addition's result in each system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum in each system and see if it fits.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's proceed methodically.

1. **One's complement**:

In one's complement, the range is from -128 to +127. So the maximum positive is 127, maximum negative is -128.

109 is well within 0-127, so positive. -42 is within -128-0, so negative. So adding 109 and -42=67.

But in one's complement, adding can cause overflow. Wait, how does one's complement handle overflow? Let me think. In one's complement, adding 1 (complement) is equivalent to subtracting. So, for example, adding 1 to 0x7F (127) would give 0x80 (128), which is outside the 8-bit range. But in 8-bit one's complement, the range is from -128 to 127. So, in one's complement, adding 127 and -42 is 127-42=85, but what about the sum? Wait, 109 is 0x6D (01101101), and -42 is 0xB2 (10110101 in 8 bits? Wait, 42 in binary is 00101010, so in 8 bits, it's 00101010. One's complement is 11010101, which is 213. So in one's complement, 213 is beyond the 8-bit range, but wait, no. Wait, in 8 bits, the maximum is 127, so 213 is larger than that. Wait I'm getting confused. So perhaps in one's complement, the representation can't handle numbers beyond 127, so adding 109 and -42 is 67, which is within the 8-bit range, but does the addition itself cause any overflow? Wait, in one's complement, when you add two numbers, if the result is 0x80 (128) it's a negative number (128-256= -128), so that could fit. So 67 is within 0-127, and 0x80 is -128. So 67 is within the range, and the addition doesn't cause an overflow. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me check another way. Let's compute 109 in one's complement as a 8-bit number. 109 is 0b1101101, which is 01101101 in 8 bits. So 01101101 (109) is correct. -42 is 0xB2 (10110101 in 8 bits). Adding them: 01101101 + 10110101 = ?

Let me add them bit by bit.

  01101101
+10110101
= ?

Starting from the right:

1 +1=0, carry 1.
0 +0 +1=1.
1 +1=0, carry 1.
0 +0 +1=1.
1 +1=0, carry 1.
1 +1 +1=1, carry 1.
0 +0 +1=1.
0 +1=1.

Wait, maybe I should write this out:

Let me align the bits:

   0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

+ 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1

= ?

Let me add each column:

Rightmost bit (bit 0): 1 +1 → 0, carry 1.
Bit 1: 0+0 +1 →1, carry 0.
Bit2: 1+1 →0, carry 1.
Bit3: 1+0 →1, carry 0.
Bit4: 0+1 →1, carry 0.
Bit5:1+1 →0, carry 1.
Bit6:1+0 +1 →0, carry 1.
Bit7:0+1 +1 →0, carry 1.
Bit8: 0 +1 +1 →0, carry 1.

So the sum is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0? Wait, no, wait the carry goes to the 8th bit which is beyond 8 bits. So the sum is 10000000, which is 128, but in one's complement, 128 is 0x80, which is -128. So the sum is -128. But wait, 128 in two's complement is -128, and in one's complement, 0x80 is also -128. So 109 + (-42) = -128 in one's complement. So the sum is -128, which is within the 8-bit one's complement range (since it's -128). So in one's complement, the addition doesn't cause an overflow; it actually wraps around to -128, which is allowed.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in one's complement, the range is from -128 to 127. So 109 + (-42) = 67, which is within 0-127, but in one's complement, the maximum positive is 127. But when adding 109 and -42, the sum is -128. So perhaps the addition is allowed because the result is within the 8-bit one's complement range.

So in one's complement, the sum is allowed. So option I is correct for one's complement.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think again. In one's complement, the maximum positive is 127, with 0x7F. So when adding two numbers, does the sum exceed 127? Or does it wrap around to negative? For example, 109 is 0x6D, which is 109. Adding 109 + 109 = 218. But wait, 218 in 8 bits is 0x86, which is 134, which is beyond 127. So 0x86 is 134, which is not allowed. So in two's complement, 109 + (-42) would be 67, which is fine. But in one's complement, the sum is -128, which is allowed. So in one's complement, the addition is allowed with no overflow.

So step I is correct.

2. **Two's complement**:

In two's complement, 8-bit can represent from -128 to +127. Let's compute 109 + (-42) in two's complement.

109 is 0x6D (01101101), -42 is 0xB2 (10110101).

Adding them: 01101101 + 10110101 = ?

Let me add:

  01101101
+10110101
= ?

Let's do it step by step.

Starting from the right:

1 +1 → 0, carry 1.

0 +0 +1 →1, carry 0.

1 +1 →0, carry 1.

1 +0 +1 →0, carry 1.

0 +1 +1 →0, carry 1.

1 +1 +1 →1, carry 1.

0 +0 +1 →1, carry 1.

0 +1 +1 →0, carry 1.

The carry out is 1, so it's 1 00000000 → 10000000, which is 0x80, which is -128 in two's complement.

So the result is -128, which is allowed in two's complement because the maximum negative is -128. So the sum is allowed. Therefore, two's complement allows the addition without overflow. So option II is correct.

Hmm, but wait, wait. 109 is 0x6D, which is 109 in decimal. 0xB2 is 178. 109 + (-42) is 67. Oh, wait, what did I just compute? Oh no, I must have done the addition wrong.

Wait, 109 is 0x6D, which is 01101101 in 8 bits. -42 is 0xB2, which is 10110101. So adding:

0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

+1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1

= ?

Let me add each column step by step.

Starting from the right:

Bit 0: 1 +1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 1:0 +0 +1=1, carry 0.

Bit 2:1 +1=0, carry 1.

Bit3:1 +0 +1=0, carry 1.

Bit4:0 +1 +1=0, carry 1.

Bit5:1 +1 +1=1, carry 1.

Bit6:1 +0 +1=0, carry 1.

Bit7:0 +1 +1=0, carry 1.

So the carry propagates to a new bit (bit 8), which is 1. So the result is 10000000, which is -128. So the sum is -128, which is within the 8-bit two's complement range. So II is correct.

Wait, but wait, 109 is 67 when added to -42, but according to the addition, the sum is -128. So that's correct.

Hmm, but wait, that's a problem because 67 is within the 8-bit range, but according to the sum, the addition is done as -128. But that's okay because -128 is acceptable.

So, for two's complement, the sum is allowed.

But wait, does the addition require that the sum is within the range, or is overflow the issue? I'm a bit confused. Wait, actually, the question is about whether the addition is within the range. So the idea is that the sum can't exceed the maximum or minimum. So in two's complement, the sum is -128, which is allowed. So the addition is allowed, so II is correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Wait, 109 + (-42) = 67. So why is the sum in two's complement -128?

Wait, that can't be right. Because 109 + (-42) = 67. Which is within 0-127. So why does the addition in two's complement give -128? That doesn't make sense. Oh no, I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm adding the two numbers. Let me try adding 109 and -42 in two's complement.

Wait, perhaps I should convert to decimal first. 109 is positive. -42 is negative. So their sum is 67. So in two's complement, 67 is 0x43. So 67 is 0x43, which is within 0-127. So the addition is allowed. So why was my two's complement calculation giving -128? That must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the two's complement addition. Let me think again: in two's complement, to add two numbers, you can add normally and then if you get a carry beyond the bit length, you adjust. But in this case, perhaps the initial addition is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm handling the addition. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the representation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that in two's complement, the sum can be with a carry. But in this case, the sum is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Wait, but another approach: in two's complement, the maximum positive is 127, and the minimum negative is -128. So 109 is positive, so adding -42 can't make it go beyond 127. But in two's complement, adding 109 and -42 would give -128, which is within the range. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to III: sign and magnitude.

3. **Sign and magnitude (original system)**:

In sign and magnitude, the number is represented with its sign bit followed by the magnitude. For example, 109 is 01101101, and -42 is 10110101.

Adding them: 01101101 + 10110101.

Let me compute this:

  0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

+ 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1

= ?

Adding each column:

Rightmost:1+1=0, carry 1.

Next:0+0 +1=1, carry 0.

Next:1+1=0, carry 1.

Next:1+0 +1=0, carry 1.

Next:0+1 +1=0, carry 1.

Next:1+1 +1=1, carry 1.

Next:1+0 +1=0, carry 1.

Next:0+1 +1=0, carry 1.

Finally, carry 1 is added as a new bit, making it 1 followed by seven zeros.

Wait, but this gives a sum of 10000000, which is 128 in decimal. But in sign and magnitude, 128 is not a valid representation. The maximum positive is 127, which is 0x7F. So the sum is 128, which is beyond the maximum. Therefore, the addition is not allowed in sign and magnitude.

Wait, but wait, 109 + (-42) equals 67 in decimal, which is within the 8-bit sign and magnitude (since 67 is less than 128). But wait, the issue is that the sum is 128, which is outside the 8-bit range. So in sign and magnitude, the addition would cause an overflow, because it's trying to represent 128, which is not allowed. So in sign and magnitude, the addition is not possible because it would overflow. Therefore, sign and magnitude isn't a valid representation for the sum.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The sum is 67, which is within the 8-bit sign and magnitude. But the way the addition is done is that it's trying to represent 128, which is outside the range. So the sum would cause an overflow, so it's not allowed. Therefore, in sign and magnitude, the addition is not possible. So III is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum. Let me compute 109 + (-42):

109 -42 = 67. So in decimal, the sum is 67, which is within the 8-bit range. But in sign and magnitude, how is the sum computed? Let me think: 109 is 01101101, -42 is 10110101. Adding these two would give 10000000, which is 128. But 128 is not a valid sign and magnitude number. So the sum is 128, which can't be represented. Therefore, the addition is not allowed in sign and magnitude.

So, in sign and magnitude, the addition is not possible because it would cause an overflow. So III is incorrect.

So, summarizing:

I: One's complement allows the addition without overflow. Yes.

II: Two's complement allows the addition without overflow. Yes.

III: Sign and magnitude allows the addition without overflow. No.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, when adding 109 and -42 in two's complement, the sum is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 109 is 0x6D, which is 109. -42 is 0xB2, which is 178. Adding them gives 67. But when you add them in two's complement, you get -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Wait, but let me reevaluate step II. When adding 0x6D and 0xB2, the sum is 0x80, which is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Wait, but what about the maximum positive value? 0x6D is 109, which is less than 127. So adding 109 and -42 is 67, which is within the 8-bit range. So II is correct.

Wait, but then, when adding in two's complement, the sum is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Wait, but then, if the sum is allowed, then the addition is permitted. So II is correct.

Wait, but the question is whether the addition is possible within the range. So for two's complement, the addition of 109 and -42 is -128, which is within the range. So II is correct.

Wait, but wait again. Let me compute 109 + (-42) in two's complement. 109 is 0x6D (01101101), -42 is 0xB2 (10110101). Adding them: Let me add the two numbers in binary.

01101101

+10110101

= ?

Adding each bit:

Starting from the right:

1 +1=0, carry 1.

0 +0 +1=1, carry 0.

1 +1=0, carry 1.

1 +0 +1=0, carry 1.

0 +1 +1=0, carry 1.

1 +1 +1=1, carry 1.

0 +0 +1=1, carry 1.

0 +1 +1=0, carry 1.

The carry goes to the 9th bit, which is 1. So the sum is 10000000, which is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Wait, but then why is the sum -128, which is allowed, but 67 is also allowed. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but the question is about whether the addition is possible, not about the result itself. So the addition is possible if the result is within the range. So for II, the sum is -128, which is within 8-bit two's complement, so the addition is allowed. So II is correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think about the way the addition is done. When adding 109 and -42, the result is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Hmm, but then I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to reevaluate all three representations.

So, for one's complement:

The sum is -128, which is allowed. So I is correct.

For two's complement:

The sum is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

For sign and magnitude:

The sum is 128, which is not allowed. So III is incorrect.

So, the correct options are I and II.

Wait, but the question is asking whether the addition is within the range. So the addition is allowed in both one's and two's complement, but not in sign and magnitude.

Wait, but wait—let me make sure about the addition in sign and magnitude. So in sign and magnitude, adding 109 and -42:

109 is 01101101, -42 is 10110101.

Adding them in sign and magnitude: 01101101 + 10110101 = 10000000 (128). But 128 is not a valid sign and magnitude number, so the addition is not allowed. Therefore, III is incorrect.

So, the correct answers are I and II.

Wait, but wait again. Let me check all three again.

So, for one's complement:

The sum is -128, which is allowed, so I is correct.

For two's complement:

The sum is -128, which is allowed, so II is correct.

For sign and magnitude:

The sum is 128, which is not allowed, so III is incorrect.

So, the correct options are I and II.

Wait, but the question is whether the addition is within the range. So perhaps the question is only about the sum, not the result. So if the sum is within the range, then the addition is allowed.

But in two's complement, the sum is -128, which is within the range, so II is correct.

Wait, but the question is about whether the representation is possible. So when adding in two's complement, the sum is allowed. So II is correct.

So, the correct options are I and II.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the sum of two's complement. Let me compute 109 + (-42) in two's complement.

109 is 0x6D (01101101), -42 is 0xB2 (10110101).

Adding 0x6D + 0xB2 = ?

Let me add them in binary.

01101101

+10110101

= ?

Adding:

Rightmost bits:

1+1=0, carry 1.

0+0+1=1, carry 0.

1+1=0, carry 1.

1+0+1=0, carry 1.

0+1+1=0, carry 1.

1+1+1=1, carry 1.

0+0+1=1, carry 1.

0+1+1=0, carry 1.

Carry propagates to a new bit (10th bit), which is 1.

So the sum is 10000000, which is -128, which is within the two's complement range.

So II is correct.

So, in conclusion, I and II are correct, so the options are I and II.

Wait, but wait, the question is "Which of the following representations of the integers will the addition be within range?" So the options are I, II, III.

So, I: yes.

II: yes.

III: no.

So, the correct options are I and II.

But wait, the question is "which of the following representations of the integers will the addition be within range?" So the correct representations are I and II. So the answer is I and II.

Wait, but I'm not sure about sign and magnitude. Let me make sure that the sum is allowed in sign and magnitude.

In sign and magnitude, the numbers are represented with their sign bit followed by the magnitude. So, 109 is 01101101, -42 is 10110101.

Adding them: 01101101 + 10110101 = 10000000, which is 128. But in sign and magnitude, 128 is not allowed. So the addition is not allowed in sign and magnitude.

So, the correct representations are I and II.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other representations where the sum is allowed? Or are there cases where the sum is beyond the range in those representations?

I think the only representations where the sum is beyond the range are sign and magnitude, because in those representations, the sum would be 128, which is not allowed.

So, the correct answers are I and II.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because the question is about whether the addition is within the range, not the sum itself. So for one's complement, the sum is -128, which is allowed, so I is correct.

For two's complement, the sum is -128, which is allowed, so II is correct.

For sign and magnitude, the sum is 128, which is not allowed, so III is incorrect.

So, the correct options are I and II.

Wait, but perhaps I should also think about whether the addition is performed correctly, but that's beyond the question.

So, I think the correct answer is I and II.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the sign and magnitude case. Because in sign and magnitude, the addition of 109 and -42 would result in 128, which is not allowed. So the sum is not allowed, so the addition is not possible in sign and magnitude.

So, the correct options are I and II.

Therefore, the answer is I and II.

Wait, but let me make sure that in two's complement, the sum is allowed.

Wait, 109 is 0x6D, and -42 is 0xB2. Adding them gives 0x80, which is -128, which is allowed. So II is correct.

Therefore, the correct options are I and II.

Hmm, I think I've thought through all possibilities and I'm confident in my answer.
