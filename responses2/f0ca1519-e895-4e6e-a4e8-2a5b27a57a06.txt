Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of triangles with integer side lengths where the maximum side is 11. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that for a triangle to have sides of length a, b, and c, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since the maximum side is 11, that means the other two sides can't exceed 11 either. So, all sides are integers between 1 and 11, inclusive, and the largest is 11.

I think this is similar to finding all possible triplets (a, b, c) where a ≤ b ≤ c = 11, and a + b > c. Wait, but since c is 11, the triangle inequality becomes a + b > 11. Also, since the sides are integers, a and b are ≤ 11.

So, to count all such triangles, I can fix c as 11 and find all pairs (a, b) where a ≤ b ≤ 11 and a + b > 11. Then, since c is fixed at 11, each such pair (a, b) forms a valid triangle.

Let me think about how to count these pairs. For each possible value of a, from 1 up to 11, I can find the possible values of b such that a ≤ b ≤ 11 and a + b > 11.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. For a given c, the number of possible (a, b) pairs that form a triangle is equal to the number of integer pairs where a + b > c and a ≤ b ≤ c.

Wait, but in this case, c is fixed at 11. So, for each a from 1 to 11, b must satisfy a ≤ b ≤ 11 and a + b > 11.

Let me consider each possible value of a and find the range of b.

Case 1: a = 1. Then, 1 + b > 11 → b > 10. Since b ≤11, b must be 11. So, one possible pair: (1,11).

Case 2: a = 2. 2 + b >11 → b>9 → b ≥10. So, b can be 10 or 11. So, two pairs: (2,10), (2,11).

Case 3: a = 3. 3 + b >11 → b>8 → b≥9. So, b can be 9,10,11. That's three pairs: (3,9), (3,10), (3,11).

Continuing this pattern:

a=4: b>7 → 8,9,10,11 → 4 pairs.

a=5: b>6 → 7,8,9,10,11 →5 pairs.

a=6: b>5 →6,7,8,9,10,11 →6 pairs.

a=7: b>4 →5,6,7,8,9,10,11 →7 pairs.

a=8: b>3 →4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 →8 pairs.

a=9: b>2 →3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 →9 pairs.

a=10: b>1 →2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 →10 pairs.

a=11: b>0 →since b≥a=11, so b=11. So, 1 pair.

Wait, but wait. Let me check when a is 10. If a is 10, then a ≤ b ≤11. The condition is 10 + b >11 → b>1. Since b can be 11, that's valid. So yes, ten pairs.

Now, adding them up:

a=1: 1
a=2:2 → total 3
a=3:3 →6
a=4:4 →10
a=5:5 →15
a=6:6 →21
a=7:7 →28
a=8:8 →36
a=9:9 →45
a=10:10 →55
a=11:1 →56?

Wait, that can't be right. Because when a=11, b has to be at least 11, so only one pair (11,11). So adding all these up would give 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+1 = 56.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when a=10, b must be greater than 1, but since a=10 and b ≤11, possible b's are 11, so one pair.

Wait but wait, let me recount the sums again.

Wait, for a=1: 1
a=2:2 → total 3
a=3:3 →6
a=4:4 →10
a=5:5 →15
a=6:6 →21
a=7:7 →28
a=8:8 →36
a=9:9 →45
a=10:10 →55
a=11:1 →56.

Wait, so that's 56. But the options are A:45, B:36, etc. Hmm, so maybe this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Because when c is 11, the sides a, b, 11 must satisfy a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b >11.

Wait, but another approach is to find all triplets (a, b, 11) where a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b >11.

So, for each possible a, find the possible b's.

Alternatively, for a given a, the minimal b is max(a, 12 - a). Because a + b must be >11, so b>11 - a.

But since b has to be ≥a, and ≤11.

Wait, maybe another approach is to compute the number of pairs (a, b) with a ≤ b ≤11, a + b >11, and a ≤ b.

Let me think about this differently. For a given a, the minimal b is max(a, 12 - a). Because if a + b >11, then b >11 -a. But since b must be ≥a, the minimal b is the maximum of a and (12 -a +1), because b must be an integer.

Wait, perhaps for a given a, the minimal b is (12 - a) if it's less than a, otherwise a.

So, for a, the minimal b is max(a, 12 -a +1). Because b must be greater than 11 -a.

Wait, let me test this for a=1.

a=1: 12 -1 =11 → so b must be >11, but since b ≤11, b=11. So, minimal b is 11. So, for a=1, b can be 11.

Which fits with previous count.

a=2: 12-2=10 → b must be >10. Since b can be 10 or 11. So, minimal b is 10.

Which is correct.

a=3: 12-3=9 → b>9, so b starts at 10. Thus, b can be 10 or 11, so two options.

Ok, so general formula for minimal b is max(a, 12 -a +1). Because 12 -a is 11 when a=1, so 12 -a +1 is 12, but that's beyond 11, so b can't be 12. So, the formula is max(a, 12 -a +1), but if it's larger than 11, then the minimal b is 11.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think for a=12 - a +1.

Wait, perhaps for a ≤6, 12 -a +1 is greater than a.

Wait, when is 12 -a +1 > a?

So 12 -a +1 >a →13 > 2a →a <6.5. So for a ≤6, 12 -a +1 >a, so the minimal b is 12 -a +1. For a >6, 12 -a +1 ≤a, so minimal b is a.

So, for a ≤6, number of b's is 11 - (12 -a +1) +1 = a -1 +1? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, for a ≤6, the minimal b is 12 -a +1 =13 -a.

But since b must be ≥a and ≤11, the number of possible b's is 11 - (13 -a) +1, but only if 13 -a ≤11.

Wait, 13 -a ≤11 →a ≥2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of a for a ≤6:

The minimal b is 13 -a.

But b must be ≥a and ≤11.

So, the possible b's are from max(a, 13 -a) to 11.

The number of such b's is 11 - max(a, 13 -a) +1, but only if 11 >= max(a, 13 -a).

Wait, for a ≤6, 13 -a is 13 -3=10 for a=3, 13-4=9, etc.

Wait, for a=6: 13-6=7. So, for a=6, the minimal b is 7.

So, number of b's is 11 -7 +1 =5.

Which is correct. Because a=6, b can be 7,8,9,10,11 →5 options.

Similarly, a=5: 13-5=8. So b ranges from 8 to 11: 4 options.

a=4:13-4=9 → b from9 to11:3 options.

a=3:13-3=10 →b from10 to11: 2 options.

a=2:13-2=11 →b=11: 1 option.

a=1:13-1=12, which is larger than 11. So, minimal b is 11. So, only one option.

So, for a=1, 1 option.

a=2:1.

a=3:2.

a=4:3.

a=5:4.

a=6:5.

a=7: For a=7, 12 -7 +1=6. Since a=7>6, minimal b is7. So, b can be7,8,9,10,11 →5 options.

Wait, a=7:12-7 +1=6. Since a=7>6, minimal b is7. So, b ranges from7 to11:5 options.

a=8:12-8 +1=5. a=8>5, so minimal b is8. So, b=8-11:4 options.

a=9:12-9 +1=4. a=9>4 →b=9-11:3 options.

a=10:12-10 +1=3. a=10>3 →b=10-11:2 options.

a=11:12-11 +1=2. a=11>2 →b=11. So, 1 option.

Now, let me sum up the number of b's for each a:

a=1:1

a=2:1

a=3:2

a=4:3

a=5:4

a=6:5

a=7:5

a=8:4

a=9:3

a=10:2

a=11:1

Let me add these up:

1+1=2

2+2=4

4+3=7

7+4=11

11+5=16

16+5=21

21+4=25

25+3=28

28+2=30

30+1=31.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier when I added a=1 to a=11 as 56, but now this approach gives 31. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: for each a from 1 to 11, the number of b's is the number of integers b where a ≤b ≤11 and a + b >11.

So, for a given a, the minimal b is max(a, 12 -a +1). Wait, wait, because a + b >11 →b >11 -a →b ≥12 -a.

But since b must be ≥a and ≤11, the minimal b is the maximum of a and (12 -a).

Wait, for example, a=1: 12 -1=11. Max(1,11)=11. So, b can be 11.

a=2:12-2=10 →max(2,10)=10. b ≥10. So, 10 and 11 →2 options.

a=3:12-3=9 →max(3,9)=9. So, b from9 to11 →3 options.

a=4:12-4=8 →max(4,8)=8. So, b from8 to11 →4 options.

a=5:12-5=7 →max(5,7)=7. So, b from7 to11 →5 options.

a=6:12-6=6 →max(6,6)=6. So, b from6 to11 →6 options.

a=7:12-7=5 →max(7,5)=7. So, b from7 to11 →5 options.

a=8:12-8=4 →max(8,4)=8. So, b from8 to11 →4 options.

a=9:12-9=3 →max(9,3)=9. So, b from9 to11 →3 options.

a=10:12-10=2 →max(10,2)=10. So, b from10 to11 →2 options.

a=11:12-11=1 →max(11,1)=11. So, b=11 →1 option.

Now, let's add these up step by step:

a=1:1 → total 1.

a=2:2 →3.

a=3:3 →6.

a=4:4 →10.

a=5:5 →15.

a=6:6 →21.

a=7:5 →26.

a=8:4 →30.

a=9:3 →33.

a=10:2 →35.

a=11:1 →36.

So, total is 36.

Wait, so the correct number is 36, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I used the other approach, I got 31, which was wrong. So, the correct approach is to calculate for each a, the number of b's as the max(a, 12 -a) and then count.

So, the correct total is 36, option B.

The correct count of integer-sided triangles with maximum side length 11 is 36.
