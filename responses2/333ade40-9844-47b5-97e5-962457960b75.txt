Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about a data set where all the values are the same. I need to determine which of the given options does not equal zero except for one of them. Let's break this down.

First, the question states that all values of the data set are the same. So, for example, if the data set is [5,5,5,5], all elements are equal. Now, I need to recall what each of these statistical measures means when all data points are identical.

Option A: Mean. The mean is calculated by adding all values and dividing by the number of values. If all are the same, say all are 5, then the mean is definitely 5. So the mean is not zero here. Wait, but wait—the question says which must equal zero except for one. So if the mean is 5, that's not zero. Hmm, but wait, the question is which one does NOT equal zero except for one. So perhaps another option is the one that does not equal zero.

Option B: Standard deviation. The standard deviation measures the spread of the data. If all values are the same, there's no spread, so the standard deviation should be zero. That makes sense because the formula uses the differences from the mean, which are all zero. So standard deviation is zero.

Option C: Variance. Variance is similar to standard deviation but squared. So if variance is the square of standard deviation, and standard deviation is zero, then variance must also be zero. So variance is zero.

Option D: Interquartile range (IQR). IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). If all data points are the same, the order statistics Q1 and Q3 are both that same value. So Q3 - Q1 would be zero. So IQR is zero.

Option E: Quartile deviation. Quartile deviation is another name for the interquartile range. So this is the same as option D. So quartile deviation is also zero.

Option F: Range. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. If all are the same, max and min are equal, so the range is zero.

Option G: Coefficient of variation. Coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. Since standard deviation is zero, the coefficient of variation is zero/mean. But wait, wait, if all values are the same, the mean is that value, say 'μ'. So CV = σ/μ. But σ (standard deviation) is zero, so CV is zero.

Option H: Percentile. Percentiles are measures that indicate the value below which a given percentage of observations fall. If all data points are the same, say 5, then the 50th percentile is definitely 5. So percentiles are 5, which is not zero. Thus, the percentiles do not equal zero except for one. Wait, but the question says which must equal zero except for one. So which one doesn't equal zero?

Let me recap:

Mean: 5 (non-zero)
Standard deviation: 0 (zero)
Variance: 0 (zero)
Interquartile range: 0 (zero)
Quartile deviation: 0 (zero)
Range: 0 (zero)
Coefficient of variation: 0 (zero)
Percentile: 5 (non-zero)

Wait, but the question asks which must equal zero except for one. So the exception is the mean. So the mean is the one that doesn't equal zero except for one. So the correct answer is A.

The question involves a data set where all values are identical. We need to determine which statistical measure does not equal zero except for one. Let's analyze each option:

- **Mean (A):** The mean is the average of all values. If all values are the same, say 5, the mean is 5, not zero.
- **Standard deviation (B):** This measures spread. With no variation, the standard deviation is zero.
- **Variance (C):** The square of the standard deviation, so it's also zero.
- **Interquartile range (D):** The difference between third and first quartiles. Both are the same value, so zero.
- **Quartile deviation (E):** Same as interquartile range, so zero.
- **Range (F):** Max minus min, which is zero since all values are the same.
- **Coefficient of variation (G):** Standard deviation divided by mean. Since standard deviation is zero, this is zero.
- **Percentile (H):** Indicates a value below which a certain percentage falls. With all values equal, percentiles are the same value, not zero.

The mean is the only measure that does not equal zero. Thus, the exception is the mean.
