Okay, so I've got this question about how a city should report its expenditures from different funds. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that Poplar City paid $5,000 in interest and $20,000 in principal on its bonds. The payment was made using a debt service fund from earlier that year. Hmm, I remember that debt service funds are called General Fund, but wait, no, wait. The options mention General fund debt service fund and others. Wait, the debt service fund is called the debt service fund, I think it's separate from the general fund.

Wait, the debt service fund is a separate entity from the general fund. So, when you pay off bonds from the debt service fund, that's part of the debt service, which is a category of expenditures. And the general fund is used for general expenses, like maintenance, salaries, etc.

So, the payment is made from the debt service fund. So, from the debt service fund, the city is using $20,000 principal and $5,000 interest. Wait, no, wait. The problem says the city paid $5,000 in interest and $20,000 principal. So that's a total of $25,000. So this amount is coming from the debt service fund.

But where does this go in the reporting? Because the debt service fund is a separate category. So the interest is a debt service, and the principal is also part of the debt service.

So the options are about how the amounts are reported. Let's look at the options.

Option A: $25000 $5000 $0 — that doesn't make sense because the debt service fund is where the payment comes from, so the $20,000 and $5,000 should be in the debt service fund. So option A is wrong because it has only $5,000 in debt service.

Option B: $5000 $20000 $0 — same issue, this seems to be the opposite. The debt service fund is $25,000, which would be where the $20,000 and $5,000 are. So B is wrong.

Option C: $0 $25000 $20000 — Wait, that doesn't make sense. The debt service fund is where the $25,000 comes from, so where is the $5k? Maybe not. Also, the options don't seem to match the structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me parse each option.

The options are about how the amounts are allocated as follows: the first number is the interest expense, the second is principal, and whatever is left is the permanent fund? Or wait, maybe the options represent how the funds are used. Let me think again.

Wait, the debt service fund is a category of expenditures. So when you use debt service fund, the money goes into debt service, not into the permanent fund or the general fund. So, the $25,000 is all in debt service. So, the expense in debt service fund would be $25,000, and the permanent fund is not affected because the payment comes from debt service fund. So, the debt service fund's fund allocation is $25,000, and nothing is in the permanent fund.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are about how the payments are reported. So, the first number is the interest expense, the second is the principal. Then the remaining is the permanent fund? Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, in the debt service fund, the payment is split into interest and principal. So, the interest is $5,000, principal $20,000, totaling $25,000. So, the debt service fund's expenditure is $25,000. The structure of the options is probably showing how the funds are allocated. So, the first line is interest, second principal, third permanent.

Wait, the question says, "how should the city report the expenditures?" So, the debt service fund is the main category. So, in the debt service fund, the $25,000 is how it's spent. So, the fund's allocation is $25,000. So, when reporting, the debt service fund's principal and interest would be $5,000 and $20,000, totaling $25,000.

So looking at the options, which one has the first number as $25,000, the second as $5,000, and the third as $20,000? Let me check the options.

Option B is $5,000 in debt service fund, $20k in principal, so that would be incorrect because the interest is part of the debt service. So the interest is $5k, principal $20k. So the debt service fund's interest is $5k, principal $20k.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The debt service fund is part of the debt service. So, the interest is part of debt service, so the payment from debt service fund would be $5k interest and $20k principal, totaling $25k. So, the fund's allocation is $25k. So in the debt service fund, the interest is $5k, principal $20k.

Now, looking at the options, the first column is interest, second principal, third permanent. So the debt service fund's interest is $5k, principal $20k.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's look.

Option B: $5000 (interest) and $20000 (principal). So that would be correct. But the third column is 0, which might mean the permanent fund is not affected, but the debt service fund's allocation is $25k. But the options don't have this structure. Oh wait, perhaps the options are structured as:

Each option has three numbers: first is interest (from debt service fund), second is principal (from debt service fund), third is permanent fund.

Wait, no. The question states: how should the expenditures be reported. So, the debt service fund is a category, and the principal is also part of it. The general fund is another category.

So the interest is part of debt service. So for debt service fund, the interest is $5k, principal $20k, totaling $25k. Then, the general fund is unaffected because the payment is made from the debt service fund.

Wait, but the question is about the city's expenditures. The debt service fund is a category, so the payment goes into that. So in the debt service fund, the interest is $5k and principal $20k, totaling $25k. So, looking at the options, which one shows the debt service fund's interest as $5k and principal as $20k, and nothing in the permanent fund, which would be $0.

Looking at the options:

Option B: $5k (interest), $20k (principal), 0 (permanent). So that would be correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as: first number is interest, second is principal, third is permanent. So for option B, that's exactly what it would be.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Looking at each option:

A: 25000 (debt service), 5000 (interest), 0 (general) → No, that would mean the general fund is using $0, which is wrong because the payment is from debt service fund.

B: 5000 (interest) + 20000 (principal) + 0 (perman) → So this is correct because the debt service fund is where the payment is made.

C: 0, 25000, 20000 → No, because the interest is 0, which is wrong.

D: 0, 0, 25000 → No, because the debt service fund is using $25k.

Wait, no. Wait, D is 0 in debt service, which is wrong. So only option B matches the required amounts.

So the correct answer is B.
</think>

To determine how the city should report the expenditures, we focus on the debt service fund, where the payment of $5,000 in interest and $20,000 in principal is made. The debt service fund is a separate category, and the payment is entirely allocated to the debt service fund. The general fund is unaffected because the payment comes directly from the debt service fund.

- The interest ($5,000) and principal ($20,000) are both part of the debt service fund.
- There is no permanent fund allocation since the payment is not made from the permanent fund.

Thus, the debt service fund's allocation is $25,000 ($5,000 interest + $20,000 principal), and the general fund is not affected. 

The correct option is **B**, which reflects the debt service fund's interest and principal allocations and no permanent fund allocation.

**Answer: B**
