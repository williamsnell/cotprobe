Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about study designs and dental caries. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is asking about the best available evidence for an association between the amount of sugars and risk of dental caries. The options are various study designs, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in medical studies, there are different types based on factors like randomization, sample selection, duration, etc. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Case-control study. I think this is used to find out the cause of a disease. It looks at cases and controls, but I'm not sure if it's the best for establishing an association between two variables like sugar intake and caries.

Option B: Longitudinal study. This involves observing the same subjects over time. It can show trends over years, which might capture the cumulative effect of sugar intake, but I'm not certain it's the best for establishing a direct cause-effect link.

Option C: Non-randomised controlled study. Oh wait, that's a randomized controlled trial (RCT), right? But the question is about the best evidence, which might come from observational studies. So maybe C isn't the best for the question.

Option D: Cross-sectional observational. Cross-sectional looks at a population at a specific time, capturing data from a sample. It provides a snapshot but doesn't establish causation. It might show associations but not the cause-effect link.

Option E: Experimental study. That's where you manipulate an independent variable and measure the effect on the dependent variable. This is more about testing causation, which might not be the best way to get evidence of an association between sugars and caries unless it's a controlled experiment.

Option F: Meta-analysis. This combines data from multiple studies. It's more of a systematic review, but I think it's a type of observational study, not the specific design mentioned.

Option G: Qualitative study. That's about non-numerical data, like interviews or observations. Not relevant here.

Option H: Randomised controlled trial. That's an RCT, which is a type of experimental study. But the question is about the best available evidence, which might come from non-experimental designs like cohort studies.

Option I: Cohort study. Cohort studies follow a group over time, comparing those exposed to a factor (like sugar intake) with those not exposed. They can show an association but might not establish causation. However, they're observational because they're based on existing data.

Option J: Ecological study. This looks at populations at a larger scale, not specific to individuals. It's observational but might not provide causality.

Wait, the question is asking for the best evidence, so it's about the study design that best supports establishing a cause-effect link. Cohort studies can show an association but not causation. They are observational. However, sometimes, especially with time trends, they can suggest causation if the exposure is a leading factor.

Wait, but the best evidence for association could come from a Cohort study, as it's a type of observational study. Or maybe a Case-control study, which is a type of observational study as well.

Alternatively, I remember that cohort studies are considered as observational studies, but they're considered good for showing an association between exposure and disease. They can be used to estimate the risk ratio or odds ratio, which are types of association.

So, the question is about the best available evidence. Cohort studies are observational. But sometimes, they can show a cause-effect relationship if the exposure is a known risk factor. 

Wait, but the best evidence might not necessarily require an experimental approach. So, the best available evidence for an association between sugars and dental caries would likely be a Cohort study, which is an observational study.

Alternatively, a cross-sectional study would provide a snapshot but not the causation. A case-control study might be used for an association but not causation. A cohort study would be good for showing an association.

Wait, but the question is about the best available evidence, which comes from which study design. So the best evidence is the study type that best supports establishing the association, regardless of causation.

So the correct answer is either A) Case-control, which is observational, or I) Cohort, which is also observational but more focused on showing an association.

Wait, but what's the definition of best evidence? It depends on whether it's observational or experimental. Observational studies can show an association, but not causation. Cohort studies can show an association. So if we're looking for evidence of an association, which is a type of evidence that suggests a relationship, both would qualify.

But the question is about the best available evidence, which might come from a Cohort study because it's designed to assess the association directly.

Alternatively, the best evidence for an association would probably come from a Cohort study, as it's an observational study that can show an association. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, another angle: the best available evidence for an association between sugars and cariesâ€”cohort studies are considered to be an observational study that assesses the risk. They can show an association when you include the right population and control for confounders.

So the best evidence would come from a Cohort study. So the correct answer would be I) Cohort.

The best available evidence for establishing an association between the amount of sugars and risk of dental caries comes from a **cohort study**. Cohort studies are observational designs that follow a group of individuals over time, allowing researchers to assess the risk of disease in exposed versus unexposed groups. They provide evidence of an association but do not establish causation. Therefore, the answer is:

**I: Cohort**
