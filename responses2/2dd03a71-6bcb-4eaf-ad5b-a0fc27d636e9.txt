Okay, so I've got this question about functions, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says, "If f(x) = 2 for all real numbers x, what is the value of f(x + 2)?" And then there are six options: A to J, each with different expressions or numbers.

Hmm, I remember that when a function is defined for all real numbers, it means that no matter what input you give it, it will output the same value. In this case, f(x) is always 2. So, whether x is 1, 0, -5, or any other number, f(x) will be 2.

Now, the question is about f(x + 2). So I need to understand what happens when we substitute x + 2 into the function. Let's break it down.

Since f(x) is always 2, no matter what x is. So if I replace x with (x + 2), the function should still take whatever (x + 2) is, and return 2. Because the function itself doesn't depend on x—it's a constant function.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say f(x) = 2. Then f(5) would be 2, right? And if x is 5, f(5) = 2. If x is 3, f(3) is 2. So if x is replaced with another expression, like (x + 2), the function's output remains 2.

So, f(x + 2) = 2.

Looking at the options, option I is 2 and option J is 4x. But wait, J is 4x, which would be 4 times x, which is not correct because the function f doesn't depend on x anymore—it's always 2. So substitution would just leave 2.

So the correct answer is I: 2.

The function f(x) is defined as 2 for all real numbers x. Since f(x) is a constant function, substituting (x + 2) into it does not change its value. Therefore, f(x + 2) is also 2.

Answer: I: 2
