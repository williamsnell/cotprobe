Okay, so I've got this question about Piaget's theory and cognitive development stages. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

Piaget's theory, I remember, has several stages that describe how children develop their cognitive abilities. The question is asking which option describes his stages. Let me recall the key points.

So, Piaget's framework includes six stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, formal operational, etc. But the question is a bit vague, so it might be referring to the main stages. Each of these stages occurs at a specific developmental stage.

Sensorimotor: This is the first stage, happening during infancy, where babies learn about the world through their sensory experiences and motor skills. So, this is definitely during early childhood.

Preoperational: This is a bit tricky. I think it's during the first four years of childhood, maybe early childhood. Children start to engage in pretend play, which is the preoperational stage. So, that's from birth to early adulthood? Wait, no, because it's the first stage of primary (primary school) age, which is early childhood. So, the preoperational stage starts around birth but stops around early adulthood, but I'm not sure. Maybe the exact time varies.

Concrete operational: This is a bit later. I think this is during adolescence, when children can think logically and perform operations like permutation and seriation. So, this is during adolescence.

Formal operational: This is later, usually in adulthood, where people can think abstractly and solve complex problems.

So, the question is about the stages. The options given don't mention all stages. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: During adolescence only — but this doesn't cover the sensorimotor and preoperational stages.

B: From birth to late childhood only — Again, no, because the stages aren't all during early childhood.

C: During infancy only — Only the first stage.

D: From birth to early adulthood only — Hmm, maybe this is mixing stages. The sensorimotor is during infancy, preoperational during early childhood, concrete operational during adolescence, and formal operational after adulthood.

E: From infancy through adolescence only — This might include sensorimotor, preoperational, and concrete operational, but not formal operational.

F: From early childhood to late adulthood only — This includes all stages except maybe the formal operational, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is what describes the stages. Wait, maybe the question is which stages Piaget identified? So, the stages are sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. But the options don't list them all.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the period in which these stages occur. For instance, the first stage is infancy, which is early childhood. The second is preoperational, which is early childhood. The third is concrete operational, which is during adolescence. The fourth is formal operational, which is adulthood.

But the options don't include all these. Let me read the options again.

Option E: From infancy through adolescence only. So that would cover sensorimotor (infancy), preoperational (early childhood), concrete operational (adolescence), but not formal operational (adults). So does the question say which describes the stages? Or perhaps which is the correct period Piaget considered.

Wait, the question says, "Piaget’s theory describes stages of cognitive development __________." So, the stages are the various points in development, not the entire period.

Looking at the options, option D says from birth to early adulthood only. But that's a broad period, and Piaget's stages are spread across the lifespan. So D might include all stages, but perhaps not exactly.

Wait, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Piaget's stages are sensorimotor (infancy), preoperational (early childhood), concrete operational (adolescence), and formal operational (adults). So each stage occurs at specific times. The question is which stage(s) Piaget described.

But the options might not list all of them. Let's see:

Option D: From birth to early adulthood only. That's the entire lifespan. But Piaget's stages are in specific periods. So D would include all the stages.

Option F: From early childhood to late adulthood only. That would cover sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, but not formal operational.

Wait, the question is about stages. So the stages are four: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete, formal. But the options don't list all of them. Wait, looking at the options, I don't see any that include all four stages. Let me read the options again.

Options:

A: During adolescence only — excludes earlier stages.

B: From birth to late childhood only — excludes formal operational.

C: During infancy only — only the first stage.

D: From birth to early adulthood only — includes all four stages? No, because it's a period but Piaget's stages are spread across the lifespan.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about all the stages but which one Piaget's theory refers to. Or, perhaps it's about the correct period when Piaget's theories were developed.

Wait, another approach: the options are about the time periods when Piaget's stages were relevant. For example, sensorimotor is infancy, preoperational early childhood, concrete operational adolescence, formal operational adulthood.

So, the stages occur at different times, and their presence isn't confined to a single period. So, the question is about which statement describes the stages. Looking back, the options include D: From birth to early adulthood only.

But wait, the stages aren't all in that period. Formal operational is after early adulthood. So D would include all four stages, but perhaps the correct answer is that Piaget's stages encompass all these periods. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that Piaget's stages are distributed across the lifespan.

Wait, the question is phrased as "Piaget’s theory describes stages of cognitive development __________." So it's referring to the stages, not the periods.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: From infancy through adolescence only. Because from infancy (stage 1) to adolescence (stage 3), so that's three stages. But that doesn't cover the formal operational stage, which is from adulthood.

Wait, maybe the options are simplified. Looking again:

The options are:

A: During adolescence only — excludes earlier stages.

B: From birth to late childhood only — excludes formal operational.

C: During infancy only — only the first stage.

D: From birth to early adulthood only — which would include stages up to early adulthood, but not the formal operational stage.

E: From infancy through adolescence only — covers the first three stages.

F: From early childhood to late adulthood only — covers stages 1,2,3.

G: During early childhood only — only stage 2.

H: Throughout the life span — all four stages.

I: From adolescence to early adulthood only — covers stages 3 and 4.

J: From birth through late adolescence only — covers stages 1,2,3,4.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that Piaget's stages occur from birth through early adulthood only (option F) but that's not correct because formal operational is after.

Alternatively, the correct answer is D: from birth to early adulthood only, but that would include all stages, which isn't accurate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: The question is which of the following statements describes the stages of cognitive development according to Piaget.

Looking up my notes, Piaget's model has four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. These occur at different developmental periods. So, the correct answer would be the one that includes all four.

Looking at the options, none of them list all four. Hmm. So perhaps the question is about the general period during which the stages occur, perhaps the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only, but that's not correct because formal operational is after that.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E: From infancy through adolescence only, because the stages are up to adolescence, but not formal operational. But the question is about the stages, not the periods. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the periods during which the stages are relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about Piaget's stages in general, and the correct answer is that they occur from birth through early adulthood only. But that's not precise because the formal operational is later.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: From infancy through adolescence only. Because the stages are in those periods, but perhaps the question is implying that Piaget's theories apply to that period, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only. Or F: From early childhood to late adulthood only.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that Piaget's stages include all the mentioned stages mentioned in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J: From birth through late adolescence only. But that's not accurate because the formal operational stage is after that.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

Piaget's stages are:

1. Sensorimotor: infancy (early childhood)
2. Preoperational: early childhood (so up to late childhood)
3. Concrete operational: adolescence
4. Formal operational: adulthood

So, the question is about which option describes the stages. The options include D: from birth to early adulthood, which would include all four stages, but that's not correct because formal operational is after.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that Piaget's theory describes the stages of cognitive development during the periods: infancy, early childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. So, the stages are spread across these periods.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only, but that doesn't account for the stages beyond early childhood. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: From early childhood to late adulthood only.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but the options are the key. Let me think about each option.

Option D: From birth to early adulthood only. So, that would include all four stages, but formal operational is beyond early adulthood.

Option F: From early childhood to late adulthood only. This includes stages 1 (infancy), 2 (early childhood), 3 (adolescence), and 4 (adult). So, that's accurate because each of those stages occurs in their respective periods.

Wait, but the stages are in the four periods. So, the correct answer would be F: From early childhood to late adulthood only.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: From infancy through adolescence only.

Because the first three stages are during infancy, early childhood, adolescence. The fourth is formal operational after that. So, E would capture the first three stages.

Wait, but the question is about the stages of cognitive development, not the periods. So, the stages are spread across the periods. So the answer would be that Piaget's theory describes the stages from birth through early adulthood only, but that's not precise because formal operational is after.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only. Because all the stages occur within those periods.

Alternatively, the correct answer is that Piaget's theory describes the four stages occurring from birth through early adulthood. But none of the options exactly state that.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

H: Throughout the life span

J: From birth through late adolescence only.

Wait, J says from birth through late adolescence. So, this covers all the stages except formal operational. So, the four stages occur up until late adolescence, but formal operational comes after that.

But the question is about the stages, not the time. So, perhaps the correct answer is that Piaget's theory describes all four stages, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, the question is which stage is covered, perhaps the first three.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: From early childhood to late adulthood only. Because this includes stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 except the formal operational.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only, which would include stages 1, 2, 3, and 4, but that's incorrect because formal operational is after that. So perhaps D is not the right answer.

Alternatively, the correct answer is that Piaget's theory describes the stages from infancy through adolescence only (option E), which would include stages 1, 2, 3, but not 4.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me try to think what each option says.

The question is which option describes the stages of cognitive development according to Piaget.

The stages are: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.

Looking for which option includes these four, perhaps:

Option J: From birth through late adolescence only. But this doesn't include formal operational.

Option F: From early childhood to late adulthood only. This includes all four stages.

Option J includes all four except formal operational.

But the question is about the stages, not the periods. So, perhaps the correct answer is that Piaget's stages occur from birth through early adulthood only.

Wait, but that's not accurate because formal operational is after that.

I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option D: From birth to early adulthood only, even though it's not precise. Or maybe the correct answer is F.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that Piaget's theory describes the four stages, and the correct option is J: From birth through late adolescence only. But that's not correct because formal operational is later.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only. Because all the stages occur during this period.

Wait, no, because the formal operational is after that, so the answer can't be D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: From infancy through adolescence only, which captures the first three stages. But Piaget's theory also includes the formal operational stage, which comes after.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I have to choose from the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only. Because that's when Piaget's theories were developed, and the stages were addressed in that period.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: Think of each option's timeframe.

Option D: From birth (1) to early adulthood (4). So, includes all four stages.

But Piaget's stages are spread across the lifespan, so this would include all four, but formal operational is after.

But the question is about the stages, not the periods. So, perhaps the answer is D.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the correct answer is F: From early childhood to late adulthood only.

Wait, I'm going to make a decision. The first three stages are during infancy (1), early childhood (2), and adolescence (3). The fourth is formal operational (4) in adulthood.

So, the stages occur in all four periods. So, the correct answer would be F: From early childhood to late adulthood only, which includes all four stages. Because that's the full period during which Piaget's theories were applied, and all the stages addressed in his theory are covered in that period.

Wait, but the stages are spread across all four periods. So, the correct option would be J: From birth through late adolescence only, which includes all four stages except formal operational.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only, which includes stages 1,2,3 but not 4.

But none of the options include all four. So perhaps the correct answer is E: From infancy through adolescence only, which includes stages 1,2,3.

Wait, the question is which option describes the stages. So, the stages are a combination of all four periods. So, the answer would be D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: Throughout the life span. But that's not correct because formal operational is after.

Wait, maybe I should read the options again.

Option E: From infancy through adolescence only.

So, that's stages 1, 2, 3. But Piaget's theory doesn't have a formal operational stage in that period, so the answer would be incorrect.

Option J: From birth through late adolescence only. So, includes stages 1,2,3,4.

Wait, but that's not correct because formal operational is after that.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only, as Piaget's theory was developed during that time and addressed all the stages.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Throughout the life span, but that's not correct.

Wait, another thought: The stages are sensorimotor (infancy), preoperational (early childhood), concrete operational (adolescence), and formal operational (adulthood). So, the answer must include all four stages. But the options don't have that.

Looking again at the options, the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only. Because that's when Piaget's theories were developed, and the four stages were addressed in that period, even though formal operational is after that.

Wait, but formal operational is a later stage. So the answer would not include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: From early childhood to late adulthood only. Because that's when all four stages were addressed.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because formal operational is after.

I'm really confused. I think I need to make a decision.

I think the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only. Because Piaget's stages occur during that time, and the question refers to the stages, not the periods.
</think>

The question asks about the stages of cognitive development as described by Piaget's theory. Piaget's model includes four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational, which occur at different developmental periods. The stages are:

1. **Sensorimotor**: Infancy.
2. **Preoperational**: Early childhood.
3. **Concrete Operational**: Adolescence.
4. **Formal Operational**: Adulthood.

The question provides options that describe these stages. After analyzing each option:

- **Option A (During adolescence only)**: Incorrect, as it excludes the sensorimotor and preoperational stages.
- **Option B (From birth to late childhood only)**: Incorrect, as it excludes the formal operational stage.
- **Option C (During infancy only)**: Incorrect, as it excludes the preoperational and concrete operational stages.
- **Option D (From birth to early adulthood only)**: This option includes stages 1, 2, and 3 but excludes the formal operational stage, which occurs after early adulthood.
- **Option E (From infancy through adolescence only)**: This option includes stages 1, 2, and 3 but excludes the formal operational stage, which occurs after adolescence.
- **Option F (From early childhood to late adulthood only)**: This option includes stages 1, 2, and 3, but excludes the formal operational stage, which occurs after late adulthood.
- **Option G (During early childhood only)**: Incorrect, as it excludes the formal operational stage.
- **Option H (Throughout the life span)**: Incorrect, as it includes the formal operational stage after early adulthood.
- **Option J (From birth through late adolescence only)**: Incorrect, as it excludes the formal operational stage, which occurs after late adolescence.

The correct answer must describe the stages as they are spread across the lifespan. Option **D (From birth to early adulthood only)** is the most appropriate, as it aligns with the periods during which Piaget's theory was developed and the stages were addressed. However, it does not fully account for the formal operational stage, which occurs after early adulthood. Despite this, **D** is the best choice among the given options.

ANSWER: D
