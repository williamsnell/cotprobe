Alright, so I've got this question about Plato and his work. Hmm, the question is about shifting from cosmology to which issue. Let me think. I remember that Plato was a big figure in philosophy, especially in Western thought. Cosmology is the study of the universe, right? Like the structure of the cosmos and the nature of existence.

Plato's main works are Timaeus and the Laws. I think he was interested in ethics too, which falls under morality. So, in the Laws, he's talking about theåŸŽ states and the moral code. That's where he shifts from cosmology. So, the last character choice would be the word from the options. The options are A: Epistemology, B: Morality, C: Religion, D: Aesthetics.

Wait, so the shift is from cosmology to morality. So the answer should be B. But I should make sure. Let me recall. In the Laws, he's discussing how society is organized based on moral codes, so that's definitely morality. Epistemology is about knowledge, religion is about belief, and aesthetics is about beauty or taste. So yes, B makes sense.

The correct answer is B: Morality. Plato's Laws shifts from cosmology to morality, discussing the moral order of society. 

Answer: B
