Okay, so I've got this question about internal auditing and objectivity. Hmm, I remember that objectivity in auditing is about ensuring that the auditor is impartial and not influenced by their own personal opinions. Let me think through the options.

The question is asking what an independent auditor should do when assessing the objectivity of their work. So the options are A through H. I think I need to figure out which of these statements align with what an independent auditor would do to assess objectivity.

Option A: Perform tests of controls. That makes sense because tests of controls are part of internal audit to assess whether controls are maintained properly. But is that about objectivity? I'm not sure. Objectivity might involve more than just doing tests; maybe ensuring that tests are done fairly.

Option B: Review educational background. That's probably unrelated. An independent auditor's objectivity isn't about their own education, more about their expertise and judgment.

Option C: Evaluate personal financial statements. I'm not certain about this. It doesn't ring a bell as a standard part of testing objectivity. Maybe it's about the auditor's own knowledge, not their audit's objectivity.

Option D: Consider the relationship with external regulators. That's about the auditor's alignment with regulatory bodies. Not directly about objectivity. Objectivity is more about the process itself, not how the auditor interacts with external bodies.

Option E: Review reports for consistency. That sounds like a good point. If the internal auditor's reports don't align with their own findings, it could indicate bias. So E is about verifying consistency, which is part of objectivity.

Option F: Analyze risk factors. This is about identifying potential misstatements. It's related to the risk assessment part, which is part of the audit process. It's about understanding the risks but maybe not directly about objectivity.

Option G: Assess frequency and severity. That's part of the audit plan. It's about how often and how severely issues are expected to be found. But again, it's about the process, not the objectivity of the auditor's judgment.

Option H: Consider policies. This could relate to whether the auditor is aware of certain policies that might affect their judgment. It's about the auditor's awareness and ethical standards.

Now, what's the core of assessing objectivity? I think it's about ensuring that the auditor is impartial and that their conclusions are based on facts and evidence rather than personal bias. So which option reflects that?

Option E talks about reviewing the internal auditor's reports for consistency. That's a good practice because if the reports don't align with their own findings, it suggests they might have been influenced by personal factors. So this is about verifying if the conclusions are consistent with the audit findings, which is part of objectivity.

Wait, but another thought: Option E is about the consistency between the internal auditor's reports and their own findings. That's about verifying that their own conclusions are sound, which is an indication of objectivity. Without this consistency, an independent auditor could be biased if they were influenced by their personal opinion.

Alternatively, option G is about the frequency and severity of misstatements. That's more about the risk assessment and could tie into the audit plan but again, not directly about the objectivity of the auditor's evaluation.

So, I'm leaning towards E being the correct answer because it's directly about ensuring the auditor's own conclusions are consistent, which is a key part of evaluating their objectivity. If their reports don't align with their own assessments, it might indicate bias.

The correct answer is E: Review the internal auditor's reports to verify that the conclusions reached are consistent with the procedures performed. This option directly addresses the auditor's objectivity by ensuring that their conclusions align with their own findings, which is crucial for impartiality. 

Answer: E
