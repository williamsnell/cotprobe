Okay, so I have this problem where a toy was originally priced at $2.25 and then marked down to $2.00. I need to find the percentage markdown. Hmm, markdown means the reduction in price, right? So I need to calculate how much the price was reduced and then express that as a percentage of the original price.

First, let me find the amount of the markdown. The original price is $2.25, and the new price is $2.00. So subtracting the new price from the original gives me the markdown. Let me do that: $2.25 minus $2.00 is $0.25. So the markdown is $0.25.

Now, to find the percentage markdown, I have to take this amount and divide it by the original price. So that's $0.25 divided by $2.25. Let me do that calculation. 

$0.25 ÷ $2.25 equals... Hmm, let me think. 2.25 is the same as 9/4, so dividing 0.25 by 0.25 * 9, which is 9/4. Wait, 0.25 is a quarter, and 2.25 is 2 and a quarter. So 0.25 divided by 2.25. Let me convert this to fractions to make it easier. 0.25 is 1/4, and 2.25 is 9/4. So (1/4) divided by (9/4) equals (1/4) * (4/9) = 1/9. 

1 divided by 9 is approximately 0.1111, which is about 11.11%. Wait, but none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again. Oh, option J is 11%. So that's the closest. But wait, let me double-check my calculation because sometimes I might have messed up somewhere.

Wait, $0.25 divided by $2.25: 0.25 ÷ 2.25. Let me do this as decimals. 2.25 goes into 0.25 how many times? Well, 2.25 is larger than 0.25, so it's less than 1. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 25 ÷ 225. Simplify that. Both divide by 25: 1 ÷ 9, which is approximately 0.1111, so 11.11%. So yes, approximately 11.11%, which rounds to 11%. So the markdown is about 11%.

The markdown is calculated by finding the percentage of the original price that was reduced. The reduction is $0.25, which is (0.25 / 2.25) * 100% ≈ 11.11%, so the closest option is 11%.

Answer: J: 11%
