Okay, so I have this initial value problem: y’ minus y equals 1 plus 3 sin t, and the initial condition is y(0) equals y0. I need to find the value of y0 that keeps the solution finite as t approaches infinity. Hmm, I remember this is a linear first-order differential equation. Let me think about the steps to solve it.

First, the equation is in the form y’ + P(t)y = Q(t). Wait, in this case, it's y’ - y = 1 + 3 sin t. So, moving the y term to the left, I can write it as y’ + (-1)y = 1 + 3 sin t. So P(t) is -1 and Q(t) is 1 + 3 sin t.

I think the solution to such an equation is given by the integrating factor method. The integrating factor mu(t) is e^{∫P(t)dt}. So in this case, P(t) is -1, so the integrating factor would be e^{-t}.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor, I get:

e^{-t} y’ - e^{-t} y = e^{-t} (1 + 3 sin t)

The left side should be the derivative of (mu(t) y). So, d/dt [e^{-t} y] = e^{-t} (1 + 3 sin t).

Now I need to integrate both sides with respect to t.

Integrate the left side: ∫ d/dt [e^{-t} y] dt = e^{-t} y.

Integrate the right side: ∫ e^{-t} (1 + 3 sin t) dt.

Let me split the integral into two parts: ∫ e^{-t} dt + 3 ∫ e^{-t} sin t dt.

Calculating each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ e^{-t} dt is straightforward. The integral of e^{-t} is -e^{-t} + C.

Second integral: 3 ∫ e^{-t} sin t dt. Hmm, I think I need to use integration by parts for this. Let me set u = sin t and dv = e^{-t} dt.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to use a standard formula. The integral of e^{at} sin(bt) dt is e^{at} (a sin bt - b cos bt)/(a² + b²) + C. But in this case, a is -1 and b is 1. So the integral is e^{-t} [ (-1) sin t - 1 * cos t ] / [ (-1)^2 + 1^2 ] + C.

Wait, let me compute that correctly. So a is -1, b is 1.

So integral is e^{-t} [ (-1) sin t - 1 * cos t ] / (1 + 1) ) + C.

Simplify denominator: 2.

So the second integral becomes (e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t)) / 2 + C.

Putting it all together, the right side integral is:

∫ e^{-t}(1 + 3 sin t) dt = ∫ e^{-t} dt + 3 ∫ e^{-t} sin t dt = (-e^{-t}) + 3 * [ (e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t))/2 ] + C.

Simplifying: -e^{-t} + (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t) + C.

Wait, let me double-check the signs. The integral of e^{-t} sin t is (e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t))/ (1 + 1) ) → which is (e^{-t} ( -sin t - cos t )) / 2.

So 3 times that is (3 e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t )) / 2.

Putting it all together, the right integral is:

- e^{-t} + (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t) + C.

Now, the left side was e^{-t} y. So:

e^{-t} y = -e^{-t} + (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t) + C.

Multiply both sides by e^{t} to solve for y:

y = -1 + (3/2) e^{t} (-sin t - cos t) + C e^{t}.

Wait, let me do that step again. Wait, if we have e^{-t} y = expression, then multiply both sides by e^{t} to get y = [expression] * e^{t}.

So y = [ -e^{-t} + (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t) ] * e^{t} + C e^{t}.

Simplify each term:

First term: -e^{-t} * e^{t} = -1.

Second term: (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t) * e^{t} → (3/2) [ (-sin t - cos t) ].

Third term: C e^{t}.

So y = (-1) + (3/2)(-sin t - cos t) + C e^{t}.

Simplify the constants:

y = -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t) + C e^{t}.

So the general solution is y(t) = C e^{t} -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t).

Now, the question asks for y0 such that the solution remains finite as t approaches infinity.

Hmm, because e^{t} grows without bound as t increases. So for y(t) to remain finite as t→infinite, the coefficient of e^{t} must be zero. Because if it's not zero, then as t grows, e^t term dominates and y(t) would go to ±infinity, which is not finite.

So the only way for y(t) to stay finite is that the coefficient C must be zero. Otherwise, the solution will blow up.

Wait, but wait. The general solution is y(t) = C e^{t} -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t).

So in this case, the term with e^t is C e^t. So as t→infinite, e^t becomes large. So for y(t) to remain finite, the coefficient C must be zero. Otherwise, y(t) will approach infinity or negative infinity, depending on the sign of C.

Wait, but what if C is zero? Then y(t) is -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t), which is always finite, regardless of t, since sine and cosine are bounded.

So the only requirement is that C=0. So in the initial condition, when t=0, y(0)=y0.

So let me find C in terms of y0.

At t=0, y(0) = C e^{0} -1 - (3/2)(sin 0 + cos 0) → y0 = C * 1 -1 - (3/2)(0 + 1) → y0 = C -1 - (3/2)*1 → C = y0 + 1 + 3/2 → C = y0 + (5/2).

But we set C=0 for y(t) to be finite as t→infinite. So set C=0 = y0 + 5/2 → y0 = -5/2 → which is -2.5.

So looking at the options, option F is -2.5.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. I think I made a mistake in the integral of e^{-t} sin t dt. Let me recompute that integral.

The integral of e^{-t} sin t dt is (e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t)) / 2 + C. So when I multiplied by 3, it became 3*(e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t)/2) → (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t).

So when I integrated the right side, I had:

∫ e^{-t} (1 + 3 sin t) dt = ∫ e^{-t} dt + 3 ∫ e^{-t} sin t dt.

Which is (-e^{-t}) + (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t) + C.

Then e^{-t} y = this, so y = [ (-e^{-t} + (3/2) e^{-t} (-sin t - cos t) ) ] * e^{t} + C e^{t}.

Wait, I think that part is correct.

Then when I simplify, the e^{-t} e^{t} terms give -1, and the other term is (3/2) e^{-t} e^{t} (-sin t - cos t) → (3/2)(-sin t - cos t). So y = -1 - (3/2)(sin t + cos t) + C e^{t}.

Yes, that's correct.

So, for the solution to be finite as t grows, C must be zero. So C = y0 + 1 + 3/2 → y0 = -5/2 → -2.5.

Looking at the options, option F is -2.5. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the value of \( y_0 \) such that the solution of the initial value problem remains finite as \( t \to \infty \), we analyze the differential equation:

\[
y' - y = 1 + 3 \sin t, \quad y(0) = y_0.
\]

This is a linear first-order ODE. The integrating factor is \( e^{-t} \), and multiplying through by it gives:

\[
e^{-t} y' - e^{-t} y = e^{-t} (1 + 3 \sin t).
\]

The left side is the derivative of \( e^{-t} y \), so integrating both sides:

\[
\int \frac{d}{dt} [e^{-t} y] \, dt = \int e^{-t} (1 + 3 \sin t) \, dt.
\]

The left integral becomes \( e^{-t} y \). The right integral is split into two parts:

1. \( \int e^{-t} \, dt = -e^{-t} + C \),
2. \( 3 \int e^{-t} \sin t \, dt = -\frac{3}{2} e^{-t} (\sin t + \cos t) + C \).

Combining, the right integral is:

\[
-e^{-t} - \frac{3}{2} e^{-t} (\sin t + \cos t) + C.
\]

Thus, the solution is:

\[
e^{-t} y = -e^{-t} - \frac{3}{2} e^{-t} (\sin t + \cos t) + C e^{t}.
\]

Multiplying through by \( e^{t} \):

\[
y = -1 - \frac{3}{2} (\sin t + \cos t) + C e^{t}.
\]

For \( y \) to remain finite as \( t \to \infty \), the coefficient of \( e^{t} \), which is \( C \), must be zero. Thus, \( C = 0 \).

Using the initial condition \( y(0) = y_0 \):

\[
y_0 = -1 - \frac{3}{2} (0 + 1) = -1 - \frac{3}{2} = -\frac{5}{2} = -2.5.
\]

Therefore, the correct value is \( y_0 = -2.5 \), corresponding to option F.
