Okay, so I've got this question about complete graphs. Hmm, let's see. I remember that a complete graph is one where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. So every vertex is connected to every other vertex.

The question is asking how many edges such a graph would have if it has 10 vertices. I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula, but I think it's related to combinations. Oh right, because each edge is a unique pair of vertices. So the number of edges is the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 10.

Wait, the formula for combinations is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2. So plugging in 10, that's 10*9/2. Let me calculate that. 10 times 9 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So the number of edges should be 45.

Looking at the options, I see option E is 50, D is 20, etc. Oh wait, no, E is 50. Did I do the calculation right? Let me double-check. 10-1 is 9, 10*9 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be E, 50? Wait, wait, wait. No, I think I made a mistake. Because 10 choose 2 is 45, not 50. So the correct option is E:50? Wait, that doesn't match. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Wait, let me think again. The formula is n(n-1)/2. For n=10, that's 90/2=45. So yes, E is 50, which is incorrect. So the correct answer should be 45. But looking back at the options, option E is 50. So maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in counting. Let me think differently: if each vertex is connected to 9 others, then for 10 vertices, each has 9 edges. So 10*9=90, but that counts each edge twice because each edge connects two vertices. So the actual number is 90/2 = 45. So the correct answer is 45, which is option E? But looking at the options, option E is 50. Wait, did I misread the options? Let me check.

The user's options are: A:60, B:35, C:90, D:20, E:50, F:25, G:100, H:55, I:10, J:45.

So option J is 45, which matches the calculation I did. So the correct answer is J:45.

The correct answer is J:45.
