Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about rectal bleeding. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through each option carefully.

First, let me read the question again. It's asking which statement is true about rectal bleeding. The options are A to J.

I remember that rectal bleeding is a common issue. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Hemorrhoids are never a cause of rectal bleeding. Hmm. I don't think that's true. I know that hemorrhoids can cause rectal bleeding, especially if there's an obstruction. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure. Digital exam is when you look at the rectum under a microscope, right? I think that's more about detecting something like a fissure, but I'm not sure if it's the most common symptom. Maybe it's a sign, but I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: A colonoscopy is not necessary if rectal bleeding is present. That doesn't sound right. I remember that colonoscopies are often done to check for issues like colon cancer, which can lead to rectal bleeding. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D: Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding. That doesn't seem right. I think the common causes are hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, not cancer. So D would be false.

Option E: Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Caecal lesions are more about things like rectal adenoids or things like pyelonephritis. Bright red blood is more like a abscess or infection. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe E is wrong.

Option F: Rectal bleeding is always a sign of cancer. That's definitely not true. There are many causes, including hemorrhoids and other obstructions, and it's not the only sign of cancer. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding. Proctoscopy is the procedure to look at the rectum, like a rectal exam. So G is saying it's not useful for rectal bleeding. I don't think that's true. Proctoscopy can help in diagnosing certain issues, maybe like a rectal lesion. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Rectal bleeding is not a symptom of diverticulosis. Diverticulosis is a condition where diverticuloesesquithes insert into the rectum, leading to rectal abscesses. I don't think diverticulosis causes rectal bleeding. So H would be true? Or is it the other way around? Wait, diverticulosis leads to diverticulosis itself, not directly to rectal bleeding. So H is correct, so H is true.

Option I: Rectal bleeding is always accompanied by pain. I'm not sure. Rectal bleeding can be painful, but sometimes it's mild. I think it's more common to have a mild pain when you see it, but sometimes it's more intense. So I don't think it's always accompanied by pain. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J: A negative colonoscopy rules out all causes of rectal bleeding. Wait, a colonoscopy looks for things like colon cancer, colorectal cancer, etc. If the colonoscopy is negative, meaning no signs of those conditions, then it's safe to say that rectal bleeding is not a cause. So J is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option J: If the colonoscopy is negative, it doesn't rule out any causes of rectal bleeding. That makes sense. Because if the colonoscopy isn't positive, there's no evidence of other issues. So J is correct.

So the options that are correct are H and J.

Wait, but let me check each again.

H: Rectal bleeding is not a symptom of diverticulosis. Correct, because diverticulosis causes diverticulosis and not rectal bleeding.

J: A negative colonoscopy rules out all causes. Yes, because colonoscopy is used to check for other possible issues. If it's negative, you don't have other conditions. So J is correct.

So which options are true? Let me look again.

Looking back, the question is asking which is true. So multiple options could be correct, but the options are separate.

So the question is, which of the following is true. So perhaps multiple are correct, but the user is to pick one as the answer. Wait, the user wrote "which of the following is true" and options are A to J. So the correct answers are a combination of correct options. But in the initial question, the user says "select the correct one" but didn't specify whether it's multiple or single choice. Wait, the original question says "which is true", so maybe only one option is correct.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to J, and the user is to select one of them as the correct answer. Or no, wait, no, the user wrote "Which of the following is true about rectal bleeding?" and then the options are A to J, each being a statement. So the correct choices could be multiple, but the options are presented as A, B, etc., each a possible correct answer.

Wait, but in the initial question, the user says "which of the following is true", so the correct answer could be more than one. However, in the options, the user is to select from A to J, each being a statement.

Wait, but the user wrote "select the correct one", but the initial structure is "Which of the following is true..." So the correct answer could be multiple, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is either H and J, but the user is to pick which letter is correct.

Wait, no. Actually, the user wrote a list of A to J, each a possible statement, and the correct answer is which is true. So in the options, each is a possible correct answer. So perhaps the correct answer includes multiple statements, but the options are presented as A to J, each being a single statement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check each option again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which of the following is true. So the correct answer could be multiple, but let me check each option.

Wait, the user is to select one of the options (A to J) that is correct. So the correct answer will be the exact letter (e.g., J is correct, so the answer is J).

So, looking back at each option:

Which of the following is true about rectal bleeding?

A: Incorrect, hemorrhoids can cause it.

B: Maybe a sign, but painful? Not sure.

C: Colonoscopy unnecessary? No, colonoscopy is often done.

D: Cancer is the commonest cause? No, correct is hemorrhoids.

E: Bright red on finger? I don't think that's a sign of cancer.

F: Always cancer? No, others cause.

G: Proctoscopy not needed? No, it's not worth doing.

H: Correct, no relation.

I: Always pain? No.

J: Negative colonoscopy rules out all. Correct.

So the correct options would be H and J. But since the user is to select one letter, perhaps the question has only one correct answer. Wait, but the user's question in the prompt says "which of the following is true", and options are A to J. But the original question is presented as a multiple-choice with options A to J, each is a statement.

Wait, perhaps the user is using the letters, each as a separate option, and the user is to select the correct letter(s). But without knowing, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, looking again, perhaps J is correct, and H is correct. But the question gives only one letter as the answer, but perhaps H and J are both correct. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the options again.

Option J: Negative colonoscopy rules out all causes. So if you have no signs of colon cancer, colorectal cancer, etc., then you can say that rectal bleeding isn't a cause. So J is correct.

H: Rectal bleeding isn't a symptom of diverticulosis. Correct.

So both H and J are correct. But the options are A to J, each a statement. So if the question allows multiple correct answers, which of the options is correct, then both H and J are correct. But the user's question says "which of the following is true". Depending on how the question is presented, it could be that more than one is correct, but the options are given as separate letters.

But the user is to select one letter, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps I'm meant to choose all correct options, but in the given setup, the user expects only one letter as the answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answers are H and J, but the question is structured so that only one option is correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps J is correct because a negative colonoscopy means no other issues, so rectal bleeding isn't a cause. So J is correct.

H is correct because, yes, diverticulosis is a different condition, not causing rectal bleeding.

Wait, but I'm to choose which of the options is true. So if both H and J are correct, but the options are presented as separate letters, perhaps the correct answers are H and J. But the user is to pick which one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a multiple-choice where only J is correct, and H is correct too, but the user expects only one letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because J says the negative colonoscopy rules out all causes. That's correct.

But then, what about H? The question is which is true. So both H and J are correct, but the options are [A to J], each a statement. So perhaps the correct options are H and J.

Wait, but the user is to choose one letter, so perhaps the choices are either H or J.

Wait, but in the options, the user says "which of the following is true", and each letter is a possible correct answer. So if both H and J are correct, but the system is expecting only one, perhaps the user made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct options are H and J. But the user's question is structured as a single answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating H and J.

Wait, let me re-examine H.

H: Rectal bleeding is not a symptom of diverticulosis. Correct. Because diverticulosis involves diverticuloesesquithes inserting into the rectum, leading to diverticulosis, not causing rectal bleeding.

J: Negative colonoscopy rules out all causes of rectal bleeding. Correct. Because the colonoscopy looks for other conditions, and if it's negative, rectal bleeding isn't a cause.

So both H and J are correct. But the options are presented as separate letters, and the user is to select one letter.

Wait, but perhaps the correct options are H and J. But the question is presented as a single-choice question. So perhaps the correct answer is both, but the user expects a letter.

Wait, but the user's question is in the format of a multiple-choice answer with options A to J. So perhaps the correct answer is either H or J, but I need to determine which is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a statement. So if J is correct, and H is correct, but the question is "which is true", perhaps it's both, but the options are presented as separate letters. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct options are H and J, but the user is to select the letter that is correct. But if the user expects only one letter, perhaps the answer is J.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The question is, which of the following is true. So if both J and H are correct, but in the options, each is a separate letter, then the correct answers are J and H. But the user expects me to select one letter. Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to choose the letter that is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is J, because a negative colonoscopy would indicate no other issues, so rectal bleeding is not a cause. So J is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps J is correct, and H is correct too. But the user expects only one letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. So the correct letter is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's options are such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me see:

Which of the following is true about rectal bleeding?

A: Hemorrhoids never cause it. Incorrect.

B: Digital exam suggests an anal fissure. Maybe, but not always a sign. I'm not sure.

C: Colonoscopy not needed. Incorrect.

D: Cancer is the main cause. Incorrect.

E: Bright red on finger indicates cancer. I don't think so.

F: Rectal bleeding always signifies cancer. Incorrect.

G: Proctoscopy not needed. Incorrect.

H: Rectal not caused by diverticulosis. Correct.

I: Pain always present. Incorrect.

J: Negative colonoscopy rules out all. Correct.

So H and J are correct. But the user is to choose which letter is correct. So perhaps the answer is both H and J. But the options are single letters. So perhaps the question expects multiple correct answers, but in the given format, I'm to select the correct letter, so perhaps J is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both H and J. But the user is expecting a single selection. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are structured such that only J is correct. Or perhaps H is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the facts. What's the correct answer?

I think the correct answer is J: a negative colonoscopy rules out all causes of rectal bleeding. Because if the colonoscopy isn't positive, then you can't conclude any other issues. So J is correct.

Regarding H: yes, it's correct.

Wait, but the user is to select one letter as the correct answer. So if both H and J are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple selections, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answers are H and J, but the user expects one letter. I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the facts.

Upon checking, I know that a colonoscopy is used to look for other conditions, not necessarily rectal bleeding. So colonoscopy is not necessary if rectal bleeding is present. So option C is incorrect.

Option H: Rectal bleeding is not a symptom of diverticulosis. Correct.

Option J: Negative colonoscopy rules out all causes of rectal bleeding. Correct.

So both H and J are correct. But, in the question, the options are presented as A to J, each a possible correct answer. So perhaps the answer is J.

Wait, but the user is to select the correct letter, which would be J because J is correct.

I'm getting stuck here. I think the answer is either H or J. But perhaps the correct answer is J: a negative colonoscopy rules out all causes, so J is correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each a statement. So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both H and J, but in the context of the question, perhaps J is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H and J, but the user expects only one letter. Since I can't select multiple, perhaps I should pick J because the colonoscopy approach is more definitive.

Hmm, I'm not sure. But I think the correct answer is J.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, each option was carefully evaluated:

- **A: Hemorrhoids are never a cause of rectal bleeding**  
  This is incorrect. Rectal bleeding can occur due to hemorrhoids.

- **B: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure**  
  While a digital exam can suggest a possible fissure, it is not a definitive or sole indication of one.

- **C: A colonoscopy is not necessary if rectal bleeding is present**  
  This is incorrect. A colonoscopy may be needed to rule out other conditions, such as colorectal cancer.

- **D: Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding**  
  This is incorrect. The common cause is hemorrhoids and other obstructions.

- **E: Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion**  
  This is not a hallmark of rectal bleeding. Bright red blood is more indicative of infection or abscesses.

- **F: Rectal bleeding is always a sign of cancer**  
  This is incorrect. Other causes, such as hemorrhoids and obstructions, are common.

- **G: Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding**  
  This is incorrect. Proctoscopy is used to examine the rectum and can provide vital information about its condition.

- **H: Rectal bleeding is not a symptom of diverticulosis**  
  This is correct. Diverticulosis involves inserting diverticuloesesquithes into the rectum, leading to abscesses and not rectal bleeding.

- **I: Rectal bleeding is always accompanied by pain**  
  This is incorrect. Rectal bleeding can be mild or painful, but it is not always accompanied by pain.

- **J: A negative colonoscopy rules out all causes of rectal bleeding**  
  This is correct. A negative colonoscopy indicates no other conditions, so rectal bleeding is not a cause.

Both **H** and **J** are correct. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **J** is selected as it directly addresses the importance of a negative colonoscopy in ruling out rectal bleeding.
