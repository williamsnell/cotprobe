Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a drag racer driving a car. Let me see what the question is. Hmm, the question is about a hockey puck that appears to be motionless in the fixed system after the car has started moving. I need to find the initial velocity of the rotating system in the rotating frame.

Wait, the problem says the tires are not slipping, so that must mean there's no relative motion between the tire and the road. The car has an acceleration 'a' and instantaneous velocity 'v'. The tires have a radius r₀, and the system is rotating with some angular velocity ω, I think. Wait, wait, the question asks about the initial velocity in the rotating system. So maybe in the car's frame or the rotating frame?

Wait, in the rotating system, which is the car's frame, the initial velocity would be the tangential velocity of the car. Because in the rotating frame, the car is moving in a circle, so its velocity is v = ω r, where r is the radius of the car's path. Oh wait, but the question says the tires have radius r₀. So the initial velocity in the rotating system would be v_car = ω r₀. Because in the rotating frame, the car is moving with velocity v = ω r. But wait, the question is about the initial velocity of the rotating system? Or is it the initial velocity in the rotating frame?

Wait, the problem says: the question is about the initial velocity in the rotating system. So perhaps the initial velocity of the rotating system refers to the angular velocity ω, but I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read: "For what initial velocity in the rotating system..." Oh, maybe they're asking for the initial angular velocity ω of the rotating system. Because the rotating system is the car's frame, so the initial velocity of the rotating system would be ω r₀? Or ω R, where R is the radius of the track? Wait, the question's setup is: the hockey puck appears to be motionless in the fixed system. So in the fixed system, the puck isn't moving. Which implies that in the rotating system, the puck is moving in such a way that it's stationary relative to the rotating frame.

Wait, no, in the fixed system, the puck is not moving. But in the rotating frame, the puck's velocity would be v' = v - ω x, where x is the position vector. Wait, maybe I should think about the rotation axes. Maybe the rotating system is the car's frame, which is rotating with angular velocity ω around some point, like the center of the track. So the initial velocity of the rotating system... Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the car's angular velocity in its own rotating frame. So the initial velocity in the rotating system refers to the angular velocity. Wait, the question says "initial velocity in the rotating system", which I think refers to the angular velocity ω. Because in the rotating frame, the car's velocity is ω r₀. So the initial velocity (which would be before the car starts moving, but I'm not sure that's right). Wait, no, the problem says the driver is driving the car with acceleration a and velocity v. Oh wait, maybe this is about the angular velocity of the car's wheels. Because the tires are not slipping, so the velocity (v) of the car is equal to ω times the radius of the tire, r₀. So v = ω r₀. So the initial angular velocity is ω = v / r₀.

But wait, none of the options seem to have v / r₀. The options are in terms of ω times something. So perhaps the question is about the initial angular velocity of the rotating system (the car's frame), which is ω. And the initial velocity in that system is ω r₀. Because in the car's frame, the initial velocity is ω r₀. But the question says "initial velocity in the rotating system", which would be the initial ω r₀. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, wait, the question is about the initial velocity in the rotating system. So perhaps, in the rotating frame (car's frame), the initial velocity of the car is v = ω r₀. But the options are in the form of something with ω times a radius. So for example, option F is 1.0 ω r₀. So if the initial velocity is v_initial = ω r₀, that would be option F. But the problem states "the initial velocity in the rotating system". So if the system is rotating with angular velocity ω, then the car's initial velocity in that system is ω r₀, but that's not an option in the given choices, except option F.

Wait, but the question says for what initial velocity in the rotating system will the puck be motionless. So perhaps the initial angular velocity ω is determined. Let me think about the puck's motion in the fixed frame. The puck is on the rotating system, so in the fixed frame, it's moving in a circle. Wait, no: if the system is rotating with ω, then the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is v_puck = ω r. But wait, the radius of the puck's path would be r, but the question isn't about that. Alternatively, perhaps the puck is on the rotating system, but the system is itself rotating. So in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is due to the rotation of the system. Wait, perhaps the puck is fixed to the rotating system, so in the rotating frame, it's stationary. But in the fixed frame, it's moving. Or wait, the problem says the puck appears to be motionless in the fixed system. So in the fixed system, the puck's velocity is zero. But how?

Ah, perhaps the rotating system itself is moving so that the puck is stationary. Alternatively, perhaps the puck is moving in the rotating frame, but in the fixed frame, it's moving in a circle. Wait, maybe it's the other way around. If the rotating system is rotating with angular velocity ω, then in the fixed frame, any point on the rotating system has velocity v = ω r, where r is the distance from the center.

But the puck is on the rotating system. So in the rotating system, if it's initially stationary, then in the fixed system, it would move in a circular path with velocity v_initial = ω r. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the puck is initially moving in the rotating frame, but in the fixed frame, it's not moving (i.e., stationary). So in the rotating frame, the puck's velocity is v, then in the fixed frame, it's v + ω × r (if r is the position vector). Wait, but the puck is on the rotating system, so its position in the rotating frame is the same as the system. So in the rotating frame, the puck's velocity is ω × r. But in the fixed frame, its velocity is ω × r + v_initial, where v_initial is the initial velocity of the rotating system (the car's velocity). Or wait, no, maybe the rotating system's velocity is v, and the puck's velocity in the rotating frame is zero, so in the fixed frame, it's v + something.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's say the rotating system is the car's frame. The puck is on the rotating system. In the rotating frame, the puck is stationary (because the system is rotating at angular velocity ω). But in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is v + ω × r. Wait, but the rotating system's frame is moving with velocity v. So in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is v plus ω × r.

Wait, but the puck is on the rotating system, so its position in the rotating frame is fixed. So in the rotating frame, the puck's velocity is zero. But in the fixed frame, its velocity is v (the car's velocity) plus the velocity due to the rotation of the system. Wait, no. Because in the rotating frame, the system itself is moving with velocity v. So the puck's velocity in the fixed frame would be v plus the velocity due to the rotation of the system. Wait, but the system's rotation has velocity ω r, where r is the distance from the center. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about a merry-go-round. Imagine the system is a merry-go-round. The puck is on the merry-go-round. So in the merry-go-round's frame, the puck is stationary. But in the fixed frame, it's moving because the merry-go-round is rotating. So the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is the velocity of the merry-go-round plus the velocity due to its rotation. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the merry-go-round is rotating with angular velocity ω, then in its own frame (the rotating frame), the puck is stationary. In the fixed frame, the puck's velocity would be ω × r, where r is the radius of the merry-go-round. Wait, but if the system is not a merry-go-round, but the car is the rotating system, then the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is v (car's velocity) plus ω × r (distance from center). So if the puck is to appear motionless in the fixed frame, then v + ω × r = 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because v is the car's velocity (which is in the direction of the track's radius), and ω × r is a tangential velocity. Unless ω × r equals -v. So the sum would be zero. So, v + ω × r = 0.

Wait, but in the rotating frame, the puck is stationary. So in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is v + ω × r. For it to appear stationary, this sum must be zero. Thus:

v + ω r = 0.

But wait, that can't be, because if the puck is on the rotating system, which is itself moving, then in the fixed frame, its velocity would be v plus the rotational velocity. Unless the rotational velocity is opposite to v. So, v = ω r. But the options don't have this as an option. Let me look.

Wait, none of the options seem to match v=ωr. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 1.1 ω r₀

B: 0.7 ω R

C: 0.9 ω R

D: 0.5 ω R

E: 0.2 ω r₀

F: 1.0 ω r₀

G: 0.3 ω R

H: 0.8 ω r₀

I: 0.6 ω r₀

J: 0.4 ω r₀

Hmm. So the correct condition is v + ω r = 0. So v = -ω r. But velocity is a vector, so the magnitudes must satisfy v = ω r. But the options are in terms of ω and r. So the initial velocity in the rotating system (the car's frame) is v. So v = ω r₀ (since the tire radius is r₀).

But none of the options are v= ω r₀. Wait, but wait, the problem says the tires are not slipping. So the velocity of the car's wheels' contact point is equal to ω r₀, right? Because the car's velocity is v = ω r₀. So the initial velocity in the rotating system is v = ω r₀.

Wait, but the options are giving expressions for the initial velocity of the rotating system as ω times a radius. So perhaps the question is about the car's initial angular velocity. Because the initial velocity of the car in the rotating system is v = ω r₀. So to find ω, it's v/(r₀). But the options give ω multiplied by a radius, not angular velocity.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think about the angular velocity. The car's initial velocity in the rotating system is ω r₀. So the initial angular velocity is ω = v/(r₀). But the options are in terms of ω multiplied by a radius. So for example, option F is 1.0 ω r₀. So if the initial velocity is v = ω r₀, then the angular velocity is ω = v/(r₀). So option F is 1.0 times ω r₀, which would be the same as v. But the question is asking for the initial velocity in the rotating system, which is ω r₀. So the correct option would be F.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have ω r₀ as the initial velocity. Instead, some have ω times a radius. So perhaps the question is asking for the angular velocity, which is ω, in terms of the car's initial velocity. Because the initial velocity in the rotating system is ω r₀, which equals v. So, if v is the initial velocity, then ω r₀ = v. Hence, ω = v/(r₀). But none of the options are in terms of v. The options are in terms of ω multiplied by a radius. Wait, the options are:

Option F: 1.0 ω r₀.

Option I: 0.6 ω r₀.

So the initial velocity in the rotating system is v. So if the question is asking for the initial velocity in the rotating system, which is v, then the correct option is F, because v = 1.0 ω r₀. But wait, that depends on the initial setup.

Wait, no, the question is about the initial velocity in the rotating system. The rotating system's initial velocity is ω r₀. So in terms of the rotating system, it's v = ω r₀. So the initial velocity in the rotating system is v = ω r₀. So which option represents v = ω r₀?

Looking at the options:

A: 1.1 ω r₀ → v = 1.1 ω r₀ → higher than v.

Wait, no. The problem states that the initial velocity in the rotating system is v, which is the car's initial velocity.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the situation where the puck appears motionless. So in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is zero. So in the rotating system, the puck is stationary. So in the rotating system, the puck's velocity is zero. But in the fixed system, the puck is moving. How does that happen?

In the rotating system, the puck's velocity is ω × r, where r is the distance from the center. But wait, the rotating system itself is moving with velocity v, so in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is v + ω × r. For the puck to be motionless, this sum must be zero.

So:

v + ω × r = 0 → v = - ω × r.

So the magnitude is v = ω × r → v = ω r.

But the options are in terms of ω times a radius. So:

v = ω r → ω = v / r.

So if the question is asking for the initial angular velocity, then ω = v / r. But the options are in terms of ω multiplied by a radius, so let's see.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the initial angular velocity. So if the initial velocity in the rotating system is v = ω × r₀, then ω = v / r₀. But the options are in terms of ω multiplied by a radius, which would be the initial velocity in the rotating system.

Wait, for example, option F is 1.0 ω r₀. So that would be v = 1.0 ω r₀. Which would imply ω = v / r₀, which is exactly what we have. So option F is v = ω r₀, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking for the initial velocity in the rotating system. So the initial velocity in the rotating system is v = ω r₀. So the correct option is F, because v is equal to 1.0 ω r₀.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. The rotating system is the car's frame, so the car's initial velocity in that system is v = ω r₀. The question is asking for the initial velocity of the rotating system, which is the car's velocity. So the initial velocity in the rotating system is v = ω r₀. So looking for an option that represents v = ω r₀. Looking at the options, option F is 1.0 ω r₀, which is the same as v. So the initial velocity in the rotating system is option F.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the rotational system is the rotating frame, and the initial velocity is the angular velocity. Wait, but the problem specifies the initial velocity in the rotating system. So the initial velocity is the car's velocity, which is ω r₀.

But the options don't have ω r₀ as the initial velocity. Instead, the options are in terms of ω multiplied by a radius. So option F is 1.0 ω r₀, which is equal to v. So the initial velocity in the rotating system is 1.0 ω r₀.

So the answer is F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the hockey puck and the rotating system. The car has an initial velocity \( v \) and an angular velocity \( \omega \), with the tires of radius \( r_0 \). The car is not slipping, meaning \( v = \omega r_0 \). The goal is to determine the initial velocity in the rotating system (the car's frame) that makes the puck appear motionless in the fixed system.

In the fixed system, the puck's velocity is determined by its position and the rotation of the system. If the puck is stationary in the fixed system, its velocity in the rotating frame must be zero. This implies that in the rotating frame, the puck's velocity is \( \omega r \), where \( r \) is the distance from the center of rotation. For the puck to appear motionless in the fixed system, the puck's velocity in the rotating frame must cancel out the car's velocity. Thus, in the rotating frame:

\[
v + \omega r = 0
\]

Since the car is not slipping, \( v = \omega r_0 \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\omega r_0 + \omega r = 0 \implies \omega (r_0 + r) = 0
\]

For the puck to appear motionless, the sum \( \omega r_0 + \omega r \) must equal zero. This occurs when the puck's velocity in the rotating frame cancels out the car's velocity. The problem asks for the initial velocity in the rotating system (the car's frame). Since \( v = \omega r_0 \), the initial velocity in the rotating system is \( v = \omega r_0 \).

Looking at the options:

- **Option F: \( 1.0 \omega r_0 \)** corresponds to \( v = \omega r_0 \), which matches the initial velocity in the rotating system.

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: F
