Question:

Six positive integers are written on the faces of a cube. Each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to the vertex. If the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001$, then what is the sum of the numbers written on the faces?

A: 36
B: 31
C: 15
D: 20
E: 13
F: 18
G: 27
H: 24
I: 1001
J: 45

Okay, so I have this problem here about a cube with six positive integers on its faces. Each vertex of the cube is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the adjacent faces. The sum of all these vertex numbers is given as 1001, and I need to find the sum of the numbers on the faces. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Hmm, let me think about how the cube's faces relate to the vertices. A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each vertex is formed by the intersection of three faces. So, each vertex's value is the product of the three numbers on those adjacent faces.

Wait a second, maybe I can express this in terms of the cube's face numbers. Let's denote the faces as follows: Let's say the top face is A, bottom is B, front is C, back is D, left is E, and right is F. So, each face has a number: A, B, C, D, E, F.

Now, each vertex is where three faces meet. For example, the vertex at the top front left would be the product of A (top), C (front), and E (left). Another vertex would be top front right: A, C, F. Then top back left: A, D, E, and so on.

Wait, but how many unique products are there for each combination? Since each face is part of four vertices, maybe I can find a way to express the sum of all vertices in terms of the faces.

I remember that for such problems, sometimes it's helpful to think about how each face contributes to the sum. Let's expand the sum of the vertices.

Each vertex is a product of three adjacent faces. So, the sum S would be:

A*C*E + A*C*F + A*D*E + A*D*F + B*C*E + B*C*F + B*D*E + B*D*F

Hmm, but that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor or find a pattern.

Wait, another approach: Each face is part of four vertices. For example, face A is part of the top front left, top front right, top back left, and top back right vertices. Each of these four vertices has A multiplied by two other faces (since each vertex has three adjacent faces, but one is the face itself). Wait, no, each vertex's product is the three adjacent faces. So, if I take a face, say A, each vertex connected to A would have A multiplied by two other faces.

Wait, maybe I can factor this sum. Let me consider the sum S:

S = (A*C*E) + (A*C*F) + (A*D*E) + (A*D*F) + (B*C*E) + (B*C*F) + (B*D*E) + (B*D*F)

I can factor A, B, etc., out. Let me group terms:

S = A*C*E + A*C*F + A*D*E + A*D*F + B*C*E + B*C*F + B*D*E + B*D*F
= A*C*(E + F) + A*D*(E + F) + B*C*(E + F) + B*D*(E + F)
= (A*C + A*D + B*C + B*D) * (E + F)
= (A*(C + D) + B*(C + D)) * (E + F)
= (A + B)(C + D) * (E + F)

Oh! So the sum S is equal to (A + B)(C + D)(E + F). That's a clever factorization.

Wait, that's a key insight. So, the sum of the vertex products is equal to the product of the sums of opposite faces. Because on a cube, opposite faces are A & B, C & D, E & F. So, (A + B) is the sum of top and bottom, (C + D) is front and back, (E + F) is left and right.

So, S = (A + B)(C + D)(E + F) = 1001.

Now, 1001 is a known number; I remember it as 7 × 11 × 13. Let me check: 7×11=77, 77×13=1001. Yes, so 7×11×13=1001.

Therefore, (A + B)(C + D)(E + F) = 1001 = 7×11×13.

So the three factors are 7, 11, and 13. Now, each of these is the sum of two opposite face numbers.

So, (A + B) = 7, (C + D) =11, (E + F) =13, or any permutation of these.

But the question is asking for the sum of the numbers on the faces. That means (A + B + C + D + E + F) = (A+B) + (C+D) + (E+F) = 7 + 11 +13 = 31.

Wait, no. Let me check: (A+B) + (C+D) + (E+F) = sum of all six faces.

Because each pair is added, so 7+11+13=31.

Looking at the options, option B is 31. So the sum of the numbers on the faces is 31.
</think>

The sum of the numbers on the faces is calculated by recognizing that the sum of the vertex products equals the product of the sums of opposite face pairs. Given the sum of vertex products is 1001, which factors into 7 × 11 × 13, the sum of the faces is 7 + 11 + 13 = 31.

Answer: B: 31
