Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. It says a convex polygon has 26 faces and 39 edges, and I need to find out how many vertices it has. Hmm, wait, that's confusing because a polygon is a two-dimensional shape, so it has vertices, edges, and faces. Oh wait, maybe it's referring to a polyhedron instead. Because a polygon is two-dimensional, it doesn't have faces in the way a polyhedron does. Maybe the question meant a polyhedron, like a convex polyhedron, where we can apply Euler's formula. Let me think.

Wait, the question says the polygon has 26 faces and 39 edges. That doesn't make sense for a polygon since polygons are planar and have only edges and vertices. So perhaps this is a typo, and it's referring to a polyhedron instead. Let's proceed under that assumption.

So, if it's a polyhedron, then Euler's formula applies. Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2, where V is vertices, E is edges, and F is faces.

Given:
F = 26
E = 39

We need to find V.

So plugging into Euler's formula:
V - 39 + 26 = 2
Simplify that: V - 13 = 2 â†’ V = 15.

Wait, but looking at the options, 15 is option D. But wait, the options don't have a 15. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:18, B:20, C:36, D:15, E:30, F:40, G:25, H:24, I:22, J:33.

Oh yeah, D is 15. So that's the answer. But wait, the initial question was about a polygon, which doesn't have faces, but that's probably a typo. So I'm confident in the approach.

The correct answer is D: 15.

Answer:
D:15
