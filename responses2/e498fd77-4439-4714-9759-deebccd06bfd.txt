Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the 'new racism' and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me break down each option carefully.

The question is asking about the definition of 'new racism.' The options are A through J, each giving a different perspective on what new racism might be. I remember from my studies that racism can come in various forms, and 'new' might refer to recent or contemporary aspects.

Option A says it's a subtler form of prejudice, masked by nationalist pride. I know that some people might feel more comfortable with their heritage or national identity even if they have a biased view. That sounds like it's about the underlying issues but presented differently.

Option B suggests it's a trend of neo-nazism masked as patriotism. Neo-nazism was a movement that used nationalist rhetoric against Jews, I think. So if it's masked as patriotism, it's about using national pride to spread racist ideas. That makes sense because people might feel more connected to their country's history while still having a negative view.

Option C claims it's a form that only exists within social media. I'm not sure about this. Social media is a huge platform for expressing opinions, so maybe some forms of racism are more prevalent there. But does 'new' imply something recent or not? Maybe it's more about the way racism is expressed now, rather than its existence.

Option D is an anti-fascist movement challenging nationalist politics. I'm not too sure about this one. I think some movements aim to oppose nationalist policies, but I'm not certain how this ties into 'new racism.' Maybe it's about pushing for more open-mindedness.

Option E says increased awareness and sensitivity towards racism in contemporary society. This sounds like a positive shift, showing a better understanding. I'm not sure if this is 'new racism' itself but more of the outcome of addressing it.

Option F is about deconstructing racist ideas to show their lack of depth. That seems like a more critical approach, perhaps a response to existing racism rather than a new form of it.

Option G refers to a radical form of racism encouraging open discrimination. This seems more extreme and perhaps unique, not something that's commonly referred to as 'new racism.'

Option H talks about racism practiced in newly emerging areas like cyberspace. This could mean that in places where people are more open to new ideas, racism is expressed in ways that were not before. So this might be a form that's been recently identified.

Option I is about racist practices in cyberspace. So if social media is a hub for new ideas, maybe some racism is expressed there, rather than being a new form.

Option J is the rise of racism in new political parties. This could be a form where parties are trying to address racism, perhaps by being more inclusive.

Now, thinking about definitions, 'new racism' often relates to recent social media use or the spread of ideas that are perceived as racist but expressed differently. So option I says it's racist practices found in cyberspace, like social media. That makes sense because social media allows for more direct expression and could facilitate the spread of racism in a way that's masked or misrepresented.

Alternatively, option A is about a subtler form, but I'm not as confident about that. Option E is about awareness, which is more of a positive shift than a form of racism itself.

So putting it together, the answer is likely either I or F. Option F is about deconstructing racist ideas, which is more of a critical approach. Option I is about the form of racism expressed in cyberspace. Both could be correct, but the question is about the form of racism, so I think it's about the expression of racism in new areas, like social media.

Wait, but the question is about 'new racism'â€”so perhaps it's about the recent emergence or recent forms of racism in new areas, which is covered in option I. That's a form of racism that's been recently expressed in cyberspace, which is a new area. So I think option I is the correct answer.

The correct answer is I: a form of racism practiced in newly emerging areas of social life, such as cyberspace. This option captures the recent emergence of racism in cyberspace as a form of newly identified racism, highlighting its expression and impact in contemporary social spaces. 

Answer: I
