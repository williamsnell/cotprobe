Okay, so I have this equation here: (x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q). And I know that one solution is x = r. I need to find the other solution in terms of p, q, and r. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when you have a quadratic equation, like ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product is c/a. Maybe I can rearrange the equation into a quadratic form and then use that.

Let me expand both sides of the equation. On the left side: (x - p)(x - q) = x² - (p + q)x + pq. On the right side: (r - p)(r - q) = r² - (p + q)r + pq. So the equation becomes x² - (p + q)x + pq = r² - (p + q)r + pq.

Wait, I can subtract pq from both sides, which gives me x² - (p + q)x = r² - (p + q)r. Now, let's bring all terms to the left side to form a quadratic equation: x² - (p + q)x - r² + (p + q)r = 0.

Alternatively, I can rearrange the terms to group like terms. Let me write it as x² - (p + q)x + ( - r² + (p + q)r ) = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this quadratic. The standard form is x² + Bx + C = 0, so here B is - (p + q) and C is - r² + (p + q)r. But maybe it's easier to factor it by grouping, or perhaps I should use the quadratic formula.

Wait, since I know that one of the roots is x = r, maybe I can factor out (x - r) from the quadratic. Let me try that.

Let me consider the quadratic as x² - (p + q)x + (r² - (p + q)r) = 0. Since x = r is a solution, (x - r) is a factor. So I can factor the quadratic as (x - r)(x - something) = 0.

Using polynomial division or factoring, let's find the other factor. Let me write (x - r)(x - a) = x² - (r + a)x + r a. Comparing this to our quadratic equation:

x² - (p + q)x + (r² - (p + q)r) = (x - r)(x - a).

So, equating coefficients:
- Coefficient of x: -(r + a) = -(p + q) → r + a = p + q → a = p + q - r.
- Constant term: r a = r² - (p + q) r. Let's check if this holds:

r a = r(p + q - r) = r p + r q - r². Which is equal to the constant term on the left side. So yes, that works.

Therefore, the quadratic factors as (x - r)(x - (p + q - r)) = 0. Thus, the roots are x = r and x = (p + q - r). So the other solution is x = p + q - r.

Looking at the options, option B is p + q - r. That should be the answer.

The equation is rewritten and factored, revealing the other solution as p + q - r.

Answer: B: p+q-r
