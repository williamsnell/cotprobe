Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically about externalities and their effects on social costs and benefits. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which statement is true. The options are labeled A through J, each giving a statement about marginal social costs, benefits, etc. I'll need to recall what each term means and how they relate.

First, I remember that externalities are costs or benefits that are not reflected in the market price. These can be positive (like pollution causing health issues) or negative (like taxes). Marginal social benefit and cost are the benefits and costs to society (including everyone, not just the producer) of producing one more unit. Marginal private benefit and cost are what the individual producer or consumer experiences.

So, let's break down each statement.

Option A: Marginal social benefit equals marginal private cost plus a negative externality. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I think the negative externality would be added to the private cost or benefit, but the statement says it's equal to the private cost plus the negative externality. Wait, no, actually, the marginal social benefit (which includes the external cost) would be the private marginal benefit plus the external cost. So A's equation would be MB = MB_p + Negative Externality. But A says MB = MC + Negative. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Or perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, another thought: The marginal social benefit is the marginal private benefit plus the marginal external benefit. So if there's a positive externality, it's a positive term added. If the externality is negative, it's subtracted. So for a negative externality, MB = MB_p + (Negative Externality). So in A, it's MB = MC + Negative. But MC is the marginal private cost, so that would mean the external cost is added to the private cost, making it the marginal social cost. Wait, no, the negative externality is subtracted in the MB equation. So A says MB = MC + negative externality, which would be MB = MC - positive externality. I don't think that's accurate. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: Value of externality equals marginal social costs. Wait, the value of the externality is the benefit society gains from it. The marginal social cost and benefit are the costs and benefits to society of producing an additional unit. So the value of the externality is the net benefit of the externality. The externalities themselves are external costs or benefits, not the social costs/benefits of production. So B is incorrect because the value of the externality is not the same as the marginal social cost. The marginal social cost is the cost of producing the good, which includes any external costs. So B is wrong.

Option C: Marginal private cost equals marginal social cost plus marginal social benefit. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Marginal private cost is the cost of producing the good for a single unit, considering private costs and any taxes or charges. Marginal social cost would include any externalities and the social cost of production. So the relation isn't that private cost equals social cost plus something. It's the opposite: social cost is private cost plus externalities. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Marginal social cost equals negative externality minus marginal private cost. Wait, negative externality is a cost, so subtracting it would imply that it's a negative effect. But I'm not sure. Let me think. If a negative externality exists, it's an additional cost to society. So the marginal social cost would be the marginal private cost plus this negative externality. So, MC = MC_p + Negative. But D says MC = Negative - MC_p. That would mean MC = (Negative) - MC_p. But MC_p is positive, so this would imply that MC is less than MC_p, which doesn't make sense because the negative externality adds to the cost. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Marginal social cost equals marginal social benefit minus positive externality. Hmm. Wait, if there's a positive externality, the marginal social cost (which includes private costs plus external benefits) would be higher than the marginal private cost. So E says MC = MB - Positive. That would imply that MC is less than MB, which would mean that the external benefit is being subtracted from MB. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the marginal social cost is the marginal private cost plus the external benefit (if positive). So MC = MC_p + Positive. So E would not be correct. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Marginal social benefit equals marginal private costs. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Marginal social benefit is the benefit to society of producing an additional unit, which includes the private benefit plus any external benefits. Marginal private cost is the cost to the producer. So F says MB = MC_p, which isn't right. The correct relation is that the social marginal benefit (which includes the private benefit plus external benefits) equals the marginal private benefit plus any external benefits. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Marginal social cost equals marginal private cost plus negative externality. Wait, that would mean MC = MC_p + Negative. But a negative externality is a cost, so adding it would increase MC. So that's correct. Let me think. The marginal social cost is the cost of producing one more unit, including any externality. So if there's a negative externality, the cost increases by that amount. So yes, MC = MC_p + Negative. So G is correct?

Wait, but let me double-check. The marginal social cost includes the private cost plus any external costs. So, yes, G seems correct.

Option H: Value of externality equals marginal private costs. No, the value of the externality is the gain society gains from it. The marginal private cost is the cost to the producer. So H is wrong.

Option I: Marginal social cost equals marginal social benefit plus negative externality. Wait, that would mean MC = MB + Negative. But a negative externality would add to the social cost, not subtract. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Marginal social cost equals marginal private cost plus marginal social benefits. I don't think that's correct. The marginal social cost is the cost of production, which includes externalities. Marginal social benefits would be the benefits to society of production, not the costs. So J is wrong.

Wait, but let me go back to option G. It says MC = MC_p + Negative. That's correct because MC includes the private cost plus the negative externality. So G seems correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The marginal social cost is the cost to society of producing an additional unit. It's the private marginal cost plus any external costs. So if there's a negative externality, that adds to the private cost. So MC = MC_p + (Negative). So G is correct.

Wait another thought: Let me check each option again.

A: MB = MC + Negative. That would imply that the external cost is subtracted from the private cost, so the MC would be less than MB. But MC includes the external cost, so that would mean the marginal external cost is subtracted, which is not correct. So A is incorrect.

B: Value of externality is marginal social costs. That's not right because the value is the net benefit, not the same as the social cost. So B is wrong.

C: MC = MC + MB? No, that can't be. It's MC equals MC_p plus another MC. So C is incorrect.

D: MC = Negative - MC_p. That would imply that MC is less than MC_p, which isn't correct because MC includes the negative externality. So D is wrong.

E: MC = MB - Positive. If positive is a cost, then subtracting it from MB. So MC = MB - Positive. But MC includes the positive externality, so this would mean that MB is less than MC, which is incorrect. So E is wrong.

G: MC = MC_p + Negative. That's correct because the marginal social cost includes the marginal private cost plus the negative externality. So G is correct.

So the correct answer should be G.

To determine which statement is true, we analyze each option based on the concepts of marginal social costs, benefits, and externalities:

1. **Option A**: "Marginal social benefit equals marginal private cost plus a negative externality."  
   This is incorrect because the marginal social benefit includes the external benefit, not the negative externality. The correct equation should be MC = MC_p + (External Benefit), not MC + Negative.

2. **Option B**: "Value of externality equals marginal social costs."  
   This is incorrect because the value of the externality is the net benefit society gains, not the marginal social cost itself.

3. **Option C**: "Marginal private cost equals marginal social cost plus marginal social benefit."  
   This is incorrect because marginal social cost already includes any externalities and the marginal social benefit is not added to it.

4. **Option D**: "Marginal social cost equals negative externality minus marginal private cost."  
   This is incorrect because negative externality is added to the marginal private cost, not subtracted.

5. **Option E**: "Marginal social cost equals marginal social benefit minus positive externality."  
   This is incorrect because positive externality is added to the marginal private cost, not subtracted.

6. **Option F**: "Marginal social benefit equals marginal private costs."  
   This is incorrect because marginal social benefit includes both the private benefit and any external benefits, not just the private cost.

7. **Option G**: "Marginal social cost equals marginal private cost plus negative externality."  
   This is correct because the marginal social cost (MC) includes the marginal private cost (MC_p) plus any external benefits or costs. A negative externality is an additional benefit to society.

8. **Option H**: "Value of externality equals marginal private costs."  
   This is incorrect because the value of the externality is the net benefit to society, not the marginal private cost.

9. **Option I**: "Marginal social cost equals marginal social benefit minus positive externality."  
   This is incorrect because positive externality is not subtracted from the marginal social benefit; it is added.

10. **Option J**: "Marginal social cost equals marginal private cost plus marginal social benefits."  
    This is incorrect because marginal social benefits are not costs; they are benefits to society of production.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as it accurately describes the relationship between marginal social cost and the components that contribute to it, including a negative externality.
