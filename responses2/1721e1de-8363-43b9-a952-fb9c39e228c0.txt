Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in kinetic energy. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that two students drop a ball from rest and measure the speed just before it hits the ground. They found the uncertainty in the speed to be 10%. I need to find out the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball, assuming the mass's uncertainty is negligible.

Alright, I remember that kinetic energy is given by KE = ½ mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. Since the mass is negligible in uncertainty, I don't have to worry about that part. So the main source of uncertainty comes from the speed measurement.

I think the formula for uncertainty in KE would involve the uncertainties in m and v. But wait, the mass is negligible, so the main contribution is from the velocity. Let me think about how to calculate the propagation of uncertainty here.

The formula for KE is proportional to v squared. So the uncertainty in KE (ΔKE) should be related to the uncertainty in v (Δv) through the square of that factor. I recall that for a function y = f(x), the uncertainty in y is approximately |f’(x)| * Δx. But since here it's y = x², the derivative is 2x. So Δy ≈ 2x Δx. So ΔKE should be approximately 2 * (KE) * (Δv / v), because KE is (1/2)mv², so if v changes by Δv, KE changes by 2 (v) * (Δv).

Wait, let me make sure. Another approach: if KE is proportional to v squared, then the relative uncertainty in KE would be twice the relative uncertainty in v. Because (ΔKE)/KE = 2*(Δv/v). So, for instance, if v has a 10% uncertainty, then v² (and thus KE) would have a 20% uncertainty, right?

Wait, let's do the math. Let me think about the formula. The kinetic energy is E = ½ m v². Taking natural logs, ln(E) = ln(½) + ln(m) + 2 ln(v). Taking differentials, dE/E = 0 + (dm/m) + 2*(dv/v). Since dm is negligible, it's (dv/v)*2. So the relative uncertainty in E (which is KE) is twice that of v.

Therefore, if the speed has a 10% uncertainty, the kinetic energy has an uncertainty of 20%. Looking at the options, option G is 30%, H is 20%, so that would be the correct answer, I think.

But wait, wait a second. Maybe I should compute the exact value. Suppose the exact calculation: the variance in KE would be (d(1/2 mv²)/(1/2 mv²))^2 * (m dv + v dv)^2. Alternatively, perhaps using error propagation.

The formula for the relative uncertainty in a product or quotient is additive. But since KE = (1/2) m v², the relative uncertainty would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the relative uncertainties from each variable multiplied by their powers.

Wait, formula: for a function f(x, y) = x^a y^b, the relative uncertainty Δf/f is a*(Δx/x) + b*(Δy/y).

In this case, KE = (1/2) m v². So m is to the first power, v is to the second. So the relative uncertainty in KE is (1 * Δm/m) + (2 * Δv/v). But since Δm is negligible (Δm/m = 0), so it's just 2*(Δv/v). So if Δv is 10%, then 2*10% = 20%, which matches earlier reasoning.

So the uncertainty in KE is 20%, so the correct option is H (20%). Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:15% → no

B:5% → no

C:25% → no

D:40% → no

E:50% → no

F:0% → no

G:30% → no

H:20% → yes

I:35% → no

J:10% → no

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The question involves determining the uncertainty in the kinetic energy (KE) of a ball based on the uncertainty in its speed (v), given that the mass is negligible. The kinetic energy is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), and the uncertainty in KE propagates from the uncertainty in v due to the \( v^2 \) dependence.

The relative uncertainty in KE is twice the relative uncertainty in v because \( \frac{\Delta KE}{KE} = 2 \frac{\Delta v}{v} \). Since the speed has an uncertainty of 10%, the relative uncertainty in KE is \( 2 \times 10\% = 20\% \).

Among the provided options, the correct answer corresponds to 20% uncertainty in KE, which is option H.
