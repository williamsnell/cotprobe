Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about boiling and freezing points of a solution. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that 10.0 grams of urea, which is CO(NH₂)₂, is dissolved in 200 grams of water. I need to find the new boiling and freezing points of the solution. The options are given from A to J, each with different values.

First, I remember that the boiling and freezing points of solutions depend on the number of solute particles they dissociate into. Urea is a covalent compound, and I think it doesn't ionize in water. Wait, but wait—is that right? Let me think. Urea is a neutral molecule, so it doesn't break down into ions when dissolved in water. So, the number of particles (molality) would just be the moles of urea, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the van 't Hoff factor, i, which determines the effect on boiling and freezing points, is the number of particles the solute dissociates into when it dissolves. For urea, which is a neutral molecule, i is 1. So, the solution will behave similarly to a non-ionic solution.

So, I'll need to calculate the boiling point and freezing point depression using the formula:

ΔT = i * Kf * m

But wait, let me get the correct terms. The freezing point depression is given by ΔT_f = i * Kf * m. Similarly, the boiling point elevation is ΔT_b = i * Kb * m.

Wait, but I need to find the boiling point and freezing point of the solution. The pure water's freezing point is 0°C, and boiling point is 100°C. So, the solution will have a freezing point depression and a boiling point elevation.

Wait, right. So, the formula for freezing point depression is ΔT_f = i * Kf * m, and for boiling point elevation, it's ΔT_b = i * Kb * m.

So, what are the values I need? Let me jot down the known values.

Molar mass of urea, CO(NH₂)₂. Let's compute this.

Carbon: 12.01 g/mol
O: 16.00
Each NH₂ group: 14 (14 from NH2) → because NH2 is 14 (14 is 14: 14 comes from 14 (14 is 14? Wait, NH2 is N (14) + 2 H (2) → 16 g/mol. Wait, no: NH2 is NH2, which is 14 + 2*1 = 16? No, wait, wait: NH2 is N (14) + 2 H (2) → so 16 g/mol. So, the molecule is CO(NH₂)₂. So:

CO: 12 + 16 = 28
Each NH₂ group: 14. So, CO(NH₂)₂ is C (12) + O(16) + 2*(NH2: 14 each). So, 12 + 16 + 2*(14) → 12 +16 +28 = 56 g/mol.

Wait, no, wait another way: CO is 12 C + 16 O = 28. Then each NH2 is (14) as N is 14, H is 1 each, so NH2 is 14 + 2(1) = 16. So two NH2 groups → 32. So CO(NH2)_2 is 28 +32=60 g/mol? Wait, that can't be right because urea's molar mass is 60 g/mol? Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Urea is CO(NH2)2. So:

C: 12.01,
O: 16.00,
N:14.01,
each H: 1.008.

Urea: one C, one O, one N, two (NH2) groups.

Each NH2: N is 14.01, H is 2*(1.008)=2.016 → 14.01 + 2.016 =16.026 g/mol.

So, the molar mass of urea is:

12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 14.01 (N) + 2*(16.026) (two NH2 groups).

So 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01.

Each NH2 is 16.026, so two of them are 32.052.

Now, 28.01 +32.052=60.062 g/mol. Approximately 60.06 g/mol.

So, molar mass of urea is about 60.06 g/mol.

So, the moles of urea in 10.0 grams would be mass/molar mass = 10.0 g / 60.06 g/mol ≈ 0.1665 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more precisely.

10.0 / 60.06 = approximately 0.1665 mol. Let me do it more accurately.

60.06 is the molar mass.

10.00 / 60.06 = 0.1664 mol approximately.

Now, the solution has 200 grams of water. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.

So, moles of water = 200 g /18.015 g/mol ≈ 11.10 mol.

So, the total moles of solute and solvent is 0.1664 +11.10 =11.2664 mol.

Wait, but wait, the van 't Hoff factor (i) is the number of particles the solute dissociates into. Since urea doesn't ionize, i=1.

So, molality (m) is moles of solute per kg of solvent. The solvent is 200 grams, which is 0.2 kg.

Therefore, m = moles / kg = 0.1664 / 0.2 = 0.832 mol/kg.

Wait, let me recheck: 10.0g urea → 10.0 /60.06= approx 0.1664 mol.

200g water → 200 /18.015 ≈11.1 mol.

Total moles = 0.1664 +11.1 ≈11.2664.

kg of solvent is 0.2 kg.

m = 11.2664 / 0.2 = 56.332 mol/kg.

Wait wait wait, wait a second! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the van 't Hoff factor calculation, it's the total moles of the solute divided by the kg of solvent. But if the solution is 200 grams of water, which is 0.2 kg, and 10 grams of urea is 0.1664 moles, so the total moles are 11.1 +0.1664=11.266 moles.

So, m= (11.266) / (0.2) = 56.33 mol/kg.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the molality would be higher than I thought. Because a 0.2 kg solvent with 0.1664 moles of urea gives 0.832 mol/kg, but the rest is water, which is 11.1 mol. So, 0.832 +11.1 is 11.932, which is the total moles.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The formula for molality is moles of solute per kg solvent. So, moles of solute (urea) is 0.1664, kg solvent is 0.2 kg. So, m = 0.1664 / 0.2 = 0.832 mol/kg.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I added moles of urea and water, which is correct, but I thought that was the molality. No, molality is only the solute's moles, divided by kg solvent. So m = 0.1664 / 0.2 = 0.832 mol/kg.

So, now I can compute ΔT for both freezing and boiling points.

But which solution is which? The solution is a solution of urea in water. Water has a boiling point of 100.0°C, and a freezing point of 0.0°C. Urea lowers the boiling point and raises the freezing point.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the formula for freezing point depression is ΔT_f = i*Kf*m, and for boiling point elevation, ΔT_b = i*Kb*m.

The freezing point depression, ΔT_f, would be negative because urea is a non-electrolyte, so i=1.

Similarly, for boiling point elevation, ΔT_b = i*Kb*m. Kb for water is 0.512°C/molal. Let me check:

Kf is 1.86°C/molal, Kb is 0.512°C/molal.

So, for the freezing point:

ΔT_f = i*Kf*m = 1 *1.86 *0.832 = 1.553 °C.

So, the freezing point would be 0 + (-1.553) = -1.553°C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no: the formula is the freezing point depression, which is T_f - T_fus = ΔT_f. So, if it's freezing, the freezing point is lower than 0. So, the freezing point would be 0 - 1.553 = -1.553°C.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. The formula is T_f - T_fus = ΔT_f (which is negative when freezing). So, T_f = T_fus + (i*Kf*m). Since i=1, ΔT_f = i*Kf*m = 1.86 * 0.832 = 1.553 °C.

So, the freezing point would be 0 -1.553 = -1.553°C, approximately -1.55°C. 

Similarly, the boiling point elevation: ΔT_b = i*Kb*m = 0.512 *0.832 = 0.426 °C.

So, the boiling point is 100.0 + 0.426 ≈ 100.43°C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is boiling point 100.43°C, freezing point -1.55°C. That matches.

Wait, but wait another second. I think I made a miscalculation in i. Oh, wait, wait! Urea is a neutral molecule, so no ions. So i=1. So, yes, that calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options have option G as boiling 100.86, which is higher. That would be if Kb was higher. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, I think I mixed up Kf and Kb. Let me double-check.

Wait, Kb for water is 0.512°C/m, and Kf is 1.86°C/m.

So, with m=0.832:

For freezing point: ΔT_f = 1.86 *0.832 = 1.553 → T_f = 0 -1.553 → -1.55°C.

For boiling point: 0.512 *0.832 = 0.426 → T_b =100 +0.426=100.43°C.

Looking at the options, option E says boiling point is 100.43°C, freezing point -1.55°C. That's option E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F says boiling point 99.57 and freezing point -1.55. But that's lower. So, option E is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for m.

Wait, I had m = 0.1664 / 0.2 = 0.832 mol/kg. Correct.

Another possible mistake could be in the calculation of i. Since urea is a neutral molecule, i=1.

Wait, what if it were a different compound, like NaCl? Then i=2. But urea, being neutral, remains i=1.

So, the correct calculations are ΔT_f = 1.86 * 0.832 ≈ 1.553 → freezing point is 0 -1.553= -1.55°C.

Boiling point is 100 + (0.512 *0.832)= about 100.43°C.

So, looking at the options:

Option E: boiling 100.43, freezing -1.55 → correct.

Other options: Option G has boiling 100.86, which would be if Kb was higher, but Kb is 0.512. So no, E is correct.

To determine the boiling and freezing points of the solution, we analyze the behavior of urea (CO(NH₂)₂) dissolving in water. Urea is a neutral molecule and does not ionize in water, so its van 't Hoff factor \( i = 1 \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Molar Mass of Urea**:  
   Urea is \( \text{CO(NH}_2\text{)}_2 \).  
   - Carbon (\( \text{C} \)): 12.01 g/mol  
   - Oxygen (\( \text{O} \)): 16.00 g/mol  
   - Nitrogen (\( \text{N} \)): 14.01 g/mol  
   - Each \( \text{NH}_2 \) group: \( 14.01 + 2(1.008) = 16.026 \) g/mol  
   Total molar mass:  
   \[
   12.01 + 16.00 + 14.01 + 2(16.026) = 60.06 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of Urea**:  
   Mass of urea = 10.0 g  
   Moles of urea = \( \frac{10.0}{60.06} \approx 0.1664 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Moles of Water**:  
   Mass of water = 200 g  
   Molar mass of water = 18.015 g/mol  
   Moles of water = \( \frac{200}{18.015} \approx 11.10 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Total Moles in Solution**:  
   Total moles = moles of urea + moles of water = \( 0.1664 + 11.10 \approx 11.2664 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Molality of the Solution**:  
   Molality (\( m \)) is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.  
   Mass of solvent = 200 g = 0.2 kg  
   \[
   m = \frac{0.1664}{0.2} = 0.832 \, \text{mol/kg}.
   \]

6. **Freezing Point Depression**:  
   The formula for freezing point depression is:  
   \[
   \Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m,
   \]  
   where \( K_f = 1.86 \, \text{°C/m} \).  
   Since \( i = 1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta T_f = 1 \cdot 1.86 \cdot 0.832 \approx 1.553 \, \text{°C}.
   \]  
   The freezing point of pure water is \( 0.0 \, \text{°C} \).  
   Therefore, the freezing point of the solution:  
   \[
   T_f = 0.0 - 1.553 \approx -1.55 \, \text{°C}.
   \]

7. **Boiling Point Elevation**:  
   The formula for boiling point elevation is:  
   \[
   \Delta T_b = i \cdot K_b \cdot m,
   \]  
   where \( K_b = 0.512 \, \text{°C/m} \).  
   Since \( i = 1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta T_b = 1 \cdot 0.512 \cdot 0.832 \approx 0.426 \, \text{°C}.
   \]  
   The boiling point of pure water is \( 100.0 \, \text{°C} \).  
   Therefore, the boiling point of the solution:  
   \[
   T_b = 100.0 + 0.426 \approx 100.43 \, \text{°C}.
   \]

### Final Results:
- Boiling point of the solution: \( 100.43 \, \text{°C} \).  
- Freezing point of the solution: \( -1.55 \, \text{°C} \).  

### Correct Option:
The boiling point of the solution is \( 100.43 \, \text{°C} \), and the freezing point is \( -1.55 \, \text{°C} \). This corresponds to **Option E**.
