Okay, so I have this question about selling scotch whiskey to maximize its present value. Hmm, I need to figure out after how many years the person should sell it. Let me think about the problem step by step.

The value of a dollar of scotch at time t is given by V(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t). Oh right, exp is the exponential function. And the interest rate is 5%, so I think that relates to the discounting factor. Oh wait, the PDV (Present Value) is important here. PDV is the current value of a future sum of money considering the interest rate.

So the person wants to sell the scotch at time t, and the PDV of that sale should be as large as possible. To maximize the PDV, we probably need to find the t that maximizes the value function V(t). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the PDV is the value at time t discounted back to present. Oh wait, perhaps I got that backwards.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: PDV is the present value of a future cash flow. So if the person sells it at time t, they receive V(t) at that time. But since the person is considering the interest rate (5%), they need to discount V(t) back to year 0. So the PDV is exp(2√t - 0.15t) multiplied by the discount factor e^(-rt), where r is the interest rate. Wait, but wait, the problem says the value is V(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t), so I think that might already include the discounting. Or maybe it's the value at time t, so to get the PDV, you have to discount it back by r*t. Hmm, the wording says "the PDV of this sale." So PDV is the present value of the sale, which is the amount you would get today if you sell it now. So the value given, V(t), is the value at time t, but the PDV is the present value, which is V(t) multiplied by e^(-rt).

Wait, but wait, the problem says, "One dollar of scotch at year 0 is worth V(t) dollars at time t." Oh, so V(t) is the value at time t of a dollar at year 0. So to get the present value, you need to discount that V(t) by the interest rate. So PDV(t) = V(t) * e^(-rt). Oh wait, no, because V(t) is the value at time t of a dollar at 0. So the present value is V(t) * e^(-rt). But wait, let me think again. Because V(t) is the amount you'd get at time t for a dollar at 0. So to find the present value, you discount V(t) by (1 + r) over t? Or wait, perhaps I should model it properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the PDV is V(t) discounted at the interest rate. So PDV(t) = V(t) * e^(-rt). But wait, if V(t) is the value at time t, then the present value is V(t) / (1 + r)^t. Since r is 5%, that's 0.05. So PDV(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t) * e^(-0.05t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t - 0.05 t) = exp(2√t - 0.2 t).

Wait, but no, because if V(t) is already the value at time t, then PDV(t) is V(t) discounted by r. So PDV(t) = V(t) / (1 + r)^t. So that's exp(2√t - 0.15t) / (1.05)^t. Wait, but 1.05^t is e^{t ln(1.05)}, and 2√t - 0.15t is the exponent. So maybe it's easier to write PDV(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t - 0.05t) = exp(2√t - 0.2t). Because e^{a} / e^{b} = e^{a - b}. So the PDV is exp(2√t - 0.2t).

Wait, but maybe I should think about this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the PDV is V(t) discounted by the interest rate. So V(t) is the amount you get at time t, so the present value is V(t) divided by (1 + r)^t. So PDV(t) = V(t) / (1.05)^t = [exp(2√t - 0.15t)] / (1.05)^t. Hmm, but that might be complicate. Alternatively, perhaps I should model PDV(t) as V(t) * e^{-rt}, which would mean that PDV(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t) * e^{-0.05 t} = exp(2√t - 0.15t -0.05t) = exp(2√t - 0.2t).

But wait, perhaps the better approach is to model PDV(t) as the value at time t, and then find the t that maximizes PDV(t). Because the PDV is the present value of the sale, which is the amount you would get today if you sell it now. So to maximize PDV(t), we need to maximize V(t) * e^{-rt}.

But wait, the question says that V(t) is the value of a dollar at year 0. So V(t) is the amount you get at time t. So the PDV is V(t) / (1 + r)^t. So PDV(t) = V(t) * e^{-rt}, because (1 + r)^t = e^{rt}.

So PDV(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t) * e^{-0.05 t} = exp(2√t - 0.15t - 0.05 t) = exp(2√t - 0.2 t).

So the problem reduces to finding the t that maximizes exp(2√t - 0.2 t). Since the exponential function is increasing, the maximum of exp(f(t)) occurs at the same t where f(t) is maximum. So f(t) = 2√t - 0.2 t.

Now, to find the maximum of f(t), we can take the derivative of f with respect to t and set it to zero. Let me compute f'(t):

f(t) = 2 t^{1/2} - 0.2 t

f’(t) = 2*(1/2) t^{-1/2} - 0.2 = t^{-1/2} - 0.2

Set f’(t) = 0:

t^{-1/2} - 0.2 = 0

t^{-1/2} = 0.2

t^{1/2} = 1/0.2 = 5

So t = (5)^2 = 25.

So the maximum occurs at t=25. So the person should sell after 25 years. Looking back at the options, option A is 25. So the answer should be A.

To determine the optimal time to sell the scotch whiskey to maximize its present value (PDV), we analyze the PDV function. PDV(t) is the amount received at time t, discounted back to year 0 at the interest rate of 5%. The PDV is given by:

\[ \text{PDV}(t) = V(t) \times e^{-rt} \]

where \( V(t) = \exp(2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t) \) and \( r = 0.05 \). Substituting \( V(t) \) into the PDV formula:

\[ \text{PDV}(t) = \exp(2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t) \times e^{-0.05t} = \exp(2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t - 0.05t) = \exp(2\sqrt{t} - 0.2t) \]

To maximize PDV(t), we maximize the exponent \( f(t) = 2\sqrt{t} - 0.2t \). Taking the derivative of \( f(t) \) with respect to \( t \):

\[ f'(t) = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{t}} - 0.2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} - 0.2 \]

Setting \( f'(t) = 0 \):

\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} - 0.2 = 0 \]
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} = 0.2 \]
\[ \sqrt{t} = 5 \]
\[ t = 25 \]

Thus, the maximum PDV occurs at \( t = 25 \) years, corresponding to option A.
