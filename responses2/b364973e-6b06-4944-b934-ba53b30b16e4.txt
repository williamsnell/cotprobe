Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically about a private closed economy. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down.

The question is asking which statement is true about a private closed economy. The options are A through J. I remember that in economics, a private closed economy refers to a situation where there's no government or foreign trade. So, all the economic activities are happening within the households themselves.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Investment is always less than savings. Hmm, wait, in a closed economy, investment is the amount households spend on new capital, like machinery or technology. Savings would be what they don't spend on capital—they save or maybe spend on other things. But in a private economy, it's not clear whether savings are related to investment. In a closed economy, savings would be the amount not invested. So I think in a private closed economy, investment can be less than, equal to, or greater than savings because it's a closed system. So A might not be always true.

Option B: Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income. Wait, when consumption equals disposable income, that means households aren't saving any money. So saving equals zero. That makes sense. So this statement is correct. But wait, does that apply in a private economy? Hmm, in a private economy, savings and investment aren't directly linked. But this statement is about whether saving is zero when consumption equals disposable income. So yes, in that case saving is zero. So B seems correct.

Option C: Investment is always greater than savings. I don't think that's right. In a closed economy, investment and savings could vary. For example, if households save more, then investment might be less than savings, as savings would be higher. Or if they save less, investment could be higher. So C is not always true.

Option D: Saving is equal to zero when consumption exceeds disposable income. If disposable income is higher than consumption, then savings would be positive because they have extra income to spend. So this would mean saving is positive, not zero. So D is the opposite of what the statement says. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving. Wait, in a private economy, is the concept of equilibrium the same as in a closed economy? Or is it different? I'm not sure. In a closed economy, the national income identity says that aggregate expenditure equals national income. So for private, it's like households' savings equal their investment. But this option says when consumption equals saving, that's equilibrium. I'm not sure if that's the case here. Maybe in this scenario, yes, because when consumption is equal to saving, that's where the economy is in equilibrium. But I'm not certain. I'll have to think more.

Option F: The economy is in equilibrium when consumption exceeds saving. That would mean that savings are less than consumption. Not sure. At equilibrium, probably consumption equals saving, so F is not correct.

Option G: Household saving can occasionally be negative. Yes, in cases where a household has more expenses than their disposable income, they would save negative money. So this is true. So G is correct.

Option H: Household saving is always equal to investment. In a private economy, saving is equal to investment (since it's closed), but if you have a private, closed economy, saving would be equal to investment. But wait, saving could be negative, so H is not always true. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. That sounds right because in equilibrium, the total investment (I) equals the total saving (S). So I think this is correct. So I is correct.

Option J: Household saving can never be negative. No, that's incorrect because saving can be negative if a household exceeds their disposable income.

So now I'm trying to figure out which of these statements are correct. Let's go through each option.

If I look back at the options, the question says, "which of the following statements is true." So only one statement is correct.

Wait, but I have multiple statements that might be correct. Let me re-examine.

Looking at statement E: The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving. Hmm. In a private economy, the national income identity says that total expenditure (which includes saving) equals national income. So perhaps when consumption plus savings equals national income, which is the same as national income being equal to investment plus savings. But in equilibrium, investment equals savings, so national income would be equal to consumption plus savings (which is national income). So maybe when consumption equals saving, that's when the economy is in equilibrium. So statement E is correct.

But wait, in a private economy, saving is not equal to investment, or is it? Wait, in a private economy, it's not clear whether savings are related to investment. But in the private closed economy, saving can be positive or negative. So perhaps the condition of equilibrium is when investment equals savings. Because in any closed economy, the equilibrium is when I equals S. So statement I: investment equals saving would be correct. So statement I is correct.

But wait, let me think again. In a closed economy, the national income (Y) equals consumption plus savings (C + S). And the national income also equals investment plus savings (since investment is the total spent on capital). So Y = I + S. So in equilibrium, investment equals savings (I = S). So statement I is correct.

So that makes statement I correct.

Wait, but statement E says that equilibrium occurs when consumption equals saving. Let me think. When would that be? Let's say I = S. Then, Y = I + S = 2I. Also, Y = C + S. So if I = S, then Y = C + I. So if I equals S, then Y is twice I. But if consumption equals saving (C = S), then Y = C + S = 2C. So both cases can happen. So it's not that when C equals S, the economy is in equilibrium. It's more about when I equals S.

Therefore, statement I is correct.

So now, checking the options:

E: Consumption equals saving. Correct condition is investment equals saving. So I is correct, E is incorrect.

Now, looking back, let's list the correct statements:

B: Saving is zero when consumption equals disposable income. Correct, because if C = Yd, then S=0.

G: Saving can be negative. Correct, when C > Yd.

I: investment equals saving. Correct, because in equilibrium, I=S.

Wait, but wait. In a private economy, is the concept of equilibrium where I=S? Or is it different? Because in a closed economy, the national income Y is equal to investment plus savings (Y=I+S). If the economy is closed, then the national income is the same as the private sector's income. So the equilibrium is when I=S because that's the condition where I + S = S + S → Y = S + S → Y= 2S? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the national income (Y) is equal to total expenditure (C + I + G + X - M). But in a private economy, G and M are zero. So Y = C + I + X - M = C + I. And since it's closed, X = Y.

So Y = C + I. But Y is also equal to I + S, because I + S = I + (S) = I + (Y - C). Since Y = C + I, Y - C = I. So S = I. So that implies that I = S. So yeah, in a private economy, I = S is the equilibrium condition. So statement I is correct.

So now, let's look at the options again.

The question asks which statement is true.

Option E: economy in equilibrium when consumption equals saving. From what I've just thought, that's not correct. The correct condition is I = S.

So, E is incorrect.

So which of the other options are correct:

Option B: Correct.

Option G: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

Wait, but how many of the options are correct? The question says which statement is true, implying only one option is correct. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, let's reevaluate each statement.

Option E: economy in equilibrium when C equals S. Correct? Well, no. Because in equilibrium, I = S. So that's statement I that is correct. So if the question is which statement is true, and only one, perhaps only I is correct.

But wait, the options are:

E: economy in equilibrium when C equals S. So if the economy is in equilibrium when I = S, that's statement I. So option I is correct.

So the correct statement is I.

Wait, but looking back, in a private economy, I = S is the condition for equilibrium. So statement I is correct.

But let's see the options again.

So the options are:

A: I < S always. No, can be equal or greater.

B: S=0 when C=Yd. Correct, because if C=Yd, then S= Yd - C = 0.

C: I > S always. No, can be equal or less.

D: S=0 when C > Yd. No, that's the opposite. If C > Yd, then S is positive.

E: Y=C+S when C=S. No, because that's the national income identity. That's always true, but the condition for equilibrium is when I=S. So statement E is not correct.

F: economy in equilibrium when C>S. No, equilibrium is I=S.

G: S can be negative. Yes, when C>Yd, S is negative.

H: S=I always. No, because in a closed economy, S can be negative.

I: Y = I + S when I=S. That's correct because I = S → Y = I + S = 2I.

J: S can't be negative. No, that's incorrect.

So the correct statements are B, G, I. But the question says only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me re-examine the options.

The options are statements A to J. The question is which statement is true.

Looking again:

Options:

E: The economy is in equilibrium when C equals saving.

F: The economy is in equilibrium when C exceeds saving.

Wait, equilibrium in a private economy is when I=S, not when C=S.

So statement E is incorrect.

G says household saving can occasionally be negative. That's correct, because if a household's consumption exceeds their disposable income, they save negative.

I says the economy is in equilibrium when I=S. That seems correct.

B: S=0 when C=Yd. Correct.

G: S can be negative. Correct.

I: Y=I+S when I=S. Correct.

So which statements are correct? B, G, I.

Wait, but the question asks which one is true. So perhaps multiple options are correct, but the question is phrased as "which of the following statements is true" implying only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each again.

Statement E: economy in equilibrium when C = S. I think that's incorrect because the condition is I=S.

So E is incorrect.

So which statements are correct:

B is correct.

G is correct.

I is correct.

Hmm, but the question is a single-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each one again.

Option E: economy in equilibrium when consumption equals saving.

I think that's not correct because the economy is in equilibrium when I=S.

So E is incorrect.

Option G: Household saving can occasionally be negative. That's correct because when a household's consumption is more than their disposable income (they have a budget deficit), their saving is negative.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. That's correct because in equilibrium, I=S.

So now, if the options are as follows, only I is correct. But wait, the question is in English, perhaps in the original question it's phrased differently.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I'm misreading them.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer is which statement is true. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Another way: think of the national income accounting identities.

In a private economy:

Y = I + S + (G - M), but G and M are zero, so Y = I + S.

In equilibrium, I = S.

So Y = I + S = I + I = 2I.

So when Y = I + S, and I = S, then Y = 2I.

So statement I is correct.

Now, looking at the statements:

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when I = S. Correct.

Option E: The economy is in equilibrium when C = S. Incorrect.

Option G: S can be negative. Correct.

So only I and G are correct, but the question asks which statement is true. So perhaps only I is correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to J. So which of these is correct?

Wait, the original question is about a private closed economy. So, in a private economy, the national income is equal to the total savings (since G and M are zero). So Y = C + I = S + I.

But in equilibrium, I = S. So Y = 2I.

So which of the statements are correct.

Statement I is correct.

Statement B: When C=Yd, then S=0. Correct.

Statement G: S can be negative. Correct.

So among the options, multiple could be correct, but the question says 'which of the following statements is true', implying only one.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the options and see which ones are correct.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answers are:

- I: True (equilibrium when I=S)
- B: True (S=0 when C=Yd)
- G: True (S can be negative)

But the question is which is true. So perhaps more than one can be correct. But the original question is a single-choice, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Because:

In a private economy, the national income Y is equal to I + S, and in equilibrium, I = S. So when I = S, Y = 2I.

So statement I is correct.

But in a private economy, when investment equals savings, that's the condition for equilibrium. So statement I is correct.

But looking at the options, which one is correct.

So the options for the question are:

A: I < S → always false.

B: S=0 when C=Yd → true.

C: I > S → false.

D: S=0 when C>Yd → false.

E: Equilibrium when C=S → false.

F: Equilibrium when C>Yd → false.

G: S can be negative → true.

H: S=I → false.

I: Equilibrium when I=S → true.

J: S can't be negative → false.

So the correct options are B, G, I.

But the question is asking which statement is true. So perhaps more than one is correct. But the options are A-J, each is a statement. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but the options are each a statement. So perhaps in the options, only one is correct, and the rest are distractors.

Wait, but the original question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, and the correct answer is one of them.

So perhaps the correct statement is I: investment equals saving.

But let me think about the other options.

Wait, perhaps statement E is correct in the sense that when C=Yd, then S=0. So statement B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should read the options again.

So the options are:

A: I < S always → no.

B: S=0 when C=Yd → yes.

C: I > S always → no.

D: S=0 when C > Yd → no.

E: Equilibrium when C=S → no.

F: Equilibrium when C>Yd → no.

G: S negative → yes.

H: S=I → no.

I: Equilibrium when I=S → yes.

J: S never negative → no.

So the correct options are B, G, and I.

But the question only allows one correct option. So perhaps the only correct statement is option I.

Wait, but when I think about the national income accounting, in equilibrium, I=S. So statement I is correct.

But when I look at the options, the only correct statements are B, G, I.

But the question asks which is true, implying only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision here. Let's try to choose the most correct option.

The correct statement is I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving.

Because in a private economy, the condition for equilibrium is that investment equals saving.

So the answer should be option I.
</think>

In a private closed economy, the national income (Y) is determined by the equation Y = C + I + S, where C is consumption, I is investment, and S is savings. The economy reaches equilibrium when investment equals savings (I = S), as this balances the flow of funds and ensures stable spending patterns. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: "Investment is always less than savings." This is incorrect because investment and savings can vary, and there is no strict rule that investment always exceeds savings.
- **B**: "Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income." This is correct because if consumption equals disposable income (C = Yd), savings (S) must be zero.
- **C**: "Investment is always greater than savings." This is incorrect because investment and savings can vary, and there is no strict rule that investment always exceeds savings.
- **D**: "Saving is equal to zero when consumption exceeds disposable income." This is incorrect because if consumption exceeds disposable income (C > Yd), savings would be positive.
- **E**: "The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving." This is incorrect because equilibrium in a private economy is when investment equals savings (I = S), not when consumption equals saving (C = S).
- **F**: "The economy is in equilibrium when consumption exceeds saving." This is incorrect because equilibrium occurs when consumption equals disposable income, not when consumption exceeds saving.
- **G**: "Household saving can occasionally be negative." This is correct because saving can be negative when consumption exceeds disposable income.
- **H**: "Household saving is always equal to investment." This is incorrect because in a private economy, savings can be negative, making the statement false.
- **I**: "The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving." This is correct because equilibrium in a private economy is defined by the condition I = S.
- **J**: "Household saving can never be negative." This is incorrect because saving can be negative when consumption exceeds disposable income.

The correct statement is **I**: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving.
