Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a child's temperament style based on Thomas and Chess's work. The question is about a 3-year-old's first day in preschool. The child holds on tightly to her mom's hand, watches others play, and eventually helps another child complete a puzzle. The options are various temperamental styles, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, first, I should recall what Thomas and Chess's research is all about. I remember they're authors who studied children's development, especially their emotional and social patterns. Thomas is known for his theory of social development, which includes three stages: secure, secure, and active. I think each stage refers to a different type of child's temperament.

So the options are:
A: Easy
B: Fast to adapt
C: Secure
D: Fearful
E: Difficult
F: Flexible
G: Insecure
H: Active
I: Slow to warm up
J: Passive

The child is in a secure stage of development. Why? Because they're holding on tightly, watching others, and then helping a child. That suggests they're secure—like a child who's not overly aggressive or afraid but is comfortable and secure. They don't rush in or try to be too dramatic. They might be active because they're trying to help, but they also have a secure foundation to build on.

Wait, but what's the definition of each stage? From what I remember, the secure stage is when a child is stable and doesn't need constant attention. They can handle social interactions without feeling anxious. Secure children are usually in the secure stage and are comfortable with their social behavior. When a child is secure, they can handle challenges without being too overwhelmed. They might be active because they're trying to help others, but they don't need to rush in because they're secure.

So the child in the question is secure because she holds on tightly, watches others, and is willing to help. They don't seem to be afraid (D), because they're still active and trying to help. They're not slow to warm up (I) because they are already in a secure stage and might be more confident. They're not easy (A) because they have a secure foundation. They might not be active if they're secure, but in this case, they are helping, which suggests they're still active but secure.

Another point is that the child is helping another child, which indicates she's not just waiting to be helped but is actively engaged. Secure children are more likely to be active because they can manage their emotions and social interactions without constant attention. So in this scenario, she's both secure and active, fitting the secure stage better than, say, the secure stage is a type of active stage.

Wait, but the options don't have a separate secure and active stage? I think each is a distinct stage. Let me think again: Thomas and Chess outlined three stages. The secure stage comes first, then active, and then secure again. Or is it secure, then secure, then active? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, the secure stage is the first of the three, then active, then secure again.

Wait no, I think the correct order is secure, then secure, then active. So for example, the secure stage is the first, then the secure again, then the active. So a child in the secure stage would be stable, secure, and perhaps active but without needing to act on it immediately.

So the child in question is in the secure stage, and because she is helping another child, she's also active. But the question is about her temperament style, so the answer is the stage she's in, which is secure. Looking at the options, option C is Secure.

So the answer should be C: Secure.

The child's temperament style is determined by her emotional and social development stage. According to Thomas and Chess's theory of social development, the secure stage is characterized by stability, security, and a stable social foundation. The child holds on tightly, watches others, and is willing to help, indicating she is in the secure stage. She is active in her interactions but maintains a secure and stable environment. 

Answer: C
