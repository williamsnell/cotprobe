Okay, so I've got this thermal conductivity problem to solve. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have a flat plastic panel with area A = 1 ft² and thickness b = 0.252 inches. It conducts heat at a steady state with temperatures T0 = 24°C on one side and T1 = 26°C on the other. We need to find the thermal conductivity in cal sec^-1 cm^-1 (°K)^-1 at 25°C.

Wait, thermal conductivity, right. I remember the formula for heat transfer through a flat plate. Oh yes, the formula is Q = (k * A * ΔT) / (b), where Q is the rate of heat transfer, k is thermal conductivity, A is area, ΔT is the temperature difference, and b is the thickness. But wait, in this problem, we don't know Q. Oh, but wait, the question is about finding k, so perhaps we need to find the rate first.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. The question gives the heat transfer rate, right? Wait, no, the question says, "the flat piece of plastic was found to conduct heat at a rate of 3.0 watts." Oh, so the power (rate) Q is 3.0 watts. So, Q is 3.0 W.

Wait, let me confirm the units. The answer options have cal per something. Since the formula uses cm and °K, converting to cal might involve some unit conversion.

So, let me write down the variables:

Q = 3.0 W (which is 3.0 J/s)
A = 1 ft². Oh, that's important. Units must be converted to cm² because the formula uses cm.
b = 0.252 inches. Convert that to cm.
ΔT = T1 - T0 = 26 - 24 = 2°C.

Wait, but since the formula for thermal conductivity uses °C, the temperature difference is 2°C. So I can keep that as is, perhaps.

But wait, the formula uses ΔT in Kelvin? Or just Celsius? Because the difference in Celsius and Kelvin is the same. So, if the temperatures are in °C, then ΔT is 2 K. So, the units for k will be in cal/(s·cm·K).

Wait, the problem asks for k in cal sec^-1 cm^-1 (°K)^-1. So the unit would be (cal/(s·cm)) / K → cal/(s·cm·K). Or, in other words, 1/(s·cm·K) is 1/(s cm °K). So the unit is (cal)/(s cm °K).

Wait, so the formula to find k is k = Q * (b) / (A * ΔT). Because Q = (k A ΔT)/b → k = Q b / (A ΔT).

Wait, that's right. So plugging in the numbers:

Q is 3.0 W, which is 3.0 J/s. So we need to convert that to cal because the answer options are in cal. So 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So 3.0 J/s = 3 / 4.184 cal/s → approximately 0.716 cal/s.

So let me compute that:

3.0 J/s = 3 / 4.184 ≈ 0.716 cal/s.

Then, b is 0.252 inches. Let's convert that to cm. Since 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 0.252 * 2.54 = let's calculate that.

0.252 * 2.54: 0.252 * 2 = 0.504, 0.252 * 0.54 = 0.13608. Adding, 0.504 + 0.13608 ≈ 0.64008 cm. Let me check: 0.252 * 2.54 → exact calculation:

2.54 * 0.252 = (2 * 0.252) + (0.54 * 0.252) → 0.504 + 0.13608 = 0.64008 cm.

A is 1 ft². 1 foot is 30.48 cm. So 30.48 cm * 30.48 cm = (30.48)^2 = let's calculate that.

30^2 = 900, 0.48^2 is about 0.2304, and cross terms are 2*30*0.48=28.8. So 30.48^2 = (30 + 0.48)^2 = 30² + 2*30*0.48 + 0.48² = 900 + 28.8 + 0.2304 = 929.0304 cm².

So A is 929.0304 cm².

ΔT is 2°C, which is 2 K.

Now plug into the formula:

k = Q * b / (A * ΔT) → but wait, Q is in cal/s, and the formula uses SI units? Or perhaps not, since all our units are in cm and K.

Wait, let's make sure all the units are consistent. Let's see:

k = (Q [cal/s]) * (b [cm]) / (A [cm²] * ΔT [K])

Wait, that can't be right because that would give cal/(s * cm * K). But the desired unit is cal/(s cm K), which is what we need.

Wait, so let's make sure all the units are correct.

Q is in cal/s (because we converted from 3.0 J/s to cal/s).

b is in cm.

A is in cm².

ΔT is in K.

So let me compute the numbers:

Q = 3.0 J/s = 3 / 4.184 cal/s ≈ 0.716 cal/s.

b = 0.64008 cm.

A = 929.0304 cm².

ΔT = 2 K.

So k = (0.716 cal/s) * (0.64008 cm) / (929.0304 cm² * 2 K )

Compute the numerator: 0.716 * 0.64008 ≈ let's compute:

0.7 * 0.64 is 0.448. 0.016 * 0.64 is 0.01024. So total is about 0.45824 cal·cm/s.

Denominator: 929.0304 * 2 = 1858.0608 cm²·K.

So k ≈ (0.45824) / (1858.0608) → about 0.0002475 cal/(s·cm·K).

Wait, but that seems really small. Let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have kept the units in terms of SI units. Let's think in SI units to check.

Wait, but wait, the answer options are in cal/(s·cm·K). So perhaps the calculation is correct as is, but the answer options are in cal/(s·cm·K), so perhaps 0.0002475 cal/(s·cm·K) is approximately 2.475e-4 cal/(s cm K), which is option B or C.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2.47 × 10^-4 cal s^-1 cm^-1 °K^-1 → which is the same as cal/(s cm K) → so that's what we're getting.

Option C: 1.47e-4 similarly.

Wait, but our calculation gives approximately 2.47e-4.

So option B is 2.47e-4, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the units in the formula. Oh yeah, because when we derived it, we have k = Q*b/(A * ΔT). So the units would be (J/s) * cm / (cm² * K) → (J/(s cm K)) → but since 1 cal is 4.184 J, so let's see:

Wait, the formula is k = Q*b/(A ΔT). Q is in J/s. Multiply by cm, then divide by (cm² * K). So J/(s cm K) → which is cal/(s cm K) as 1 cal is 4.184 J.

Wait, but in our calculation, the value comes out to 0.716 cal/s * 0.64008 cm / (929.0304 cm² * 2 K). So let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute numerator: 0.716 cal/s * 0.64008 cm = 0.716 * 0.64008 ≈ let's compute 0.716 * 0.64008. Let me calculate:

0.7 * 0.64 is 0.448. 0.016 * 0.64 is 0.01024. So total is 0.45824 cal·cm/s.

Denominator: 929.0304 cm² * 2 K = 1858.0608 cm² K.

So 0.45824 / 1858.0608 = Let me compute this division.

0.45824 / 1858.0608 → 0.45824 ÷ 1858.0608 ≈ 0.0002475 approximately.

So 0.0002475 cal/(s·cm·K) → 2.475e-4 cal/(s cm K).

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2.47 × 10^-4 cal s^-1 cm^-1 (°K)^-1 → which is same as 2.47e-4 cal/(s cm K). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The formula I used is Q = k * A * (T1 - T0) / b → so rearranged, k = Q*b/(A*(T1-T0)).

So that's correct.

Wait, but what about the units? Let me check the units again.

Q is in J/s (since 3.0 W is 3.0 J/s). So 3 J/s. Multiply by b (cm), which is 0.64 cm. So (J/s * cm).

Divide by (A * ΔT), where A is in cm² and ΔT is in K.

So the units become (J/s * cm) / (cm² * K) → (J/(s cm K)).

Since 1 J = 1 cal * 4.184, so the unit becomes (cal * 4.184)/(s cm K) → but wait, the formula gives k in cal/(s cm K). Wait, perhaps I'm missing the unit conversion factor. Because in the formula, we're using Q (in J/s), but the answer options are in cal/(s cm K). So perhaps I should have converted the Q into calories first.

Ah! Right, I did that earlier. So when I converted Q from 3.0 W (3 J/s) to cal/s, I got approx 0.716 cal/s. So all the units in the formula are in terms of cal. Then, the result is k as 2.47e-4 cal/(s cm K), which matches option B.

Wait, but I should make sure that the formula uses the correct units. Let me recheck.

The formula for thermal conductivity is k = (Q * b) / (A * ΔT). The units for each term:

- Q: in watts (J/s)
- b: in cm → but for the formula, let's see: since we're using SI units, perhaps I need to convert cm to meters or something.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: let's convert all units to SI.

But I'm getting a bit stuck because I'm a bit confused about the units, but the calculation seems correct.

So the answer should be option B, 2.47e-4 cal/(s cm K), which is option B.

To determine the thermal conductivity of the plastic, the formula for heat transfer through a flat plate is used:

\[
k = \frac{Q \cdot b}{A \cdot \Delta T}
\]

### Given Data:
- Heat transfer rate, \( Q = 3.0 \, \text{W} = 3.0 \, \text{J/s} \)
- Thickness, \( b = 0.252 \, \text{in} = 0.252 \times 2.54 \, \text{cm} = 0.64008 \, \text{cm} \)
- Area, \( A = 1 \, \text{ft}^2 = (30.48 \, \text{cm})^2 = 929.0304 \, \text{cm}^2 \)
- Temperature difference, \( \Delta T = T_1 - T_0 = 26^\circ \text{C} - 24^\circ \text{C} = 2 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 1: Convert heat transfer rate to calories
Since \( 1 \, \text{J} = 0.239 \, \text{cal} \), we convert \( Q \) from watts to calories:
\[
Q = 3.0 \, \text{J/s} \times \frac{1 \, \text{cal}}{4.184 \, \text{J}} \approx 0.716 \, \text{cal/s}
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the formula
Rearranging the formula for \( k \):
\[
k = \frac{Q \cdot b}{A \cdot \Delta T}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the values
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
k = \frac{0.716 \, \text{cal/s} \cdot 0.64008 \, \text{cm}}{929.0304 \, \text{cm}^2 \cdot 2 \, \text{K}}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
0.716 \cdot 0.64008 \approx 0.45824 \, \text{cal·cm/s}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
929.0304 \cdot 2 = 1858.0608 \, \text{cm}^2 \cdot \text{K}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
k = \frac{0.45824}{1858.0608} \approx 0.0002475 \, \text{cal/(s·cm·K)}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the answer options
The calculated value of \( k \) is approximately \( 2.47 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cal/(s·cm·K)} \), which matches option **B**.
