Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about factors that can impact moral intensity. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what moral intensity means. From what I remember, moral intensity refers to how strong the moral feeling is. It's about how intense or strong someone feels about a moral issue. So, factors that influence this would include things that make the situation more compelling, easier to reflect on, etc.

Looking at the question, the options are about what factors can impact moral intensity. The options are A to J, each lists three things. I think the key here is to identify the correct combination of factors related to moral intensity.

The options are:

A: Social dissensus, Cultural immediacy, Proximity
B: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity
C: Temporal consensus, Social immediacy, Proximity
D: Social consensus, Spatial immediacy, Proximity
E: Proximity, Cultural dissensus, Temporal immediacy
F: Proximity, Social consensus, Temporal dissensus
G: Cultural consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity
H: Proximity, Temporal immediacy, Social dissensus
I: Proximity, Social dissensus, Futility of effect
J: Social dissensus, Temporal immediacy, Distance

Wait, maybe I should think about each of these factors.

Proximity: This is when the situation is close. It's about being near or near to something. So proximity makes moral intensity higher because it's immediate and perhaps more impactful.

Cultural immediacy: I think this relates to how connected you are with the culture. If you're from a culture that values certain moral issues more, that could influence how intense your moral feelings are.

Social consensus: If people generally agree on what's important, that could influence moral intensity. Maybe if a group is in social agreement, the situation is more consistent, leading to higher moral intensity.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Social dissensus, Cultural immediacy, Proximity. So, if there's a lot of social disagreement, maybe that's not a factor that makes moral intensity higher. Or perhaps it's the opposite. I'm a bit confused. Maybe high social disagreement would lower moral intensity because people are less aligned.

Option B: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. Social consensus would probably increase moral intensity because people are in line with each other. Temporal immediacy is about timeâ€”so being in the moment. Proximity is about closeness. So this seems plausible. Let me think: if people are in a situation where they are in the moment, and the situation is close, then moral intensity would be high. Social consensus would mean that the group's values are consistent, which would support a high moral intensity.

Option C: Temporal consensus, Social immediacy, Proximity. Temporal consensus is about time. If it's a recent event, then the immediacy might be more immediate. Social immediacy is when people are near each other. Proximity would be if they're close. So, this could be about whether the situation is recent and with others nearby, which would support high moral intensity.

Option D: Social consensus, Spatial immediacy, Proximity. Spatial immediacy is about being in a close physical location. Proximity is also about closeness. Social consensus again, which would mean people are in line. So, if you're in a specific location and the situation is recent, and people are nearby, that could be a factor.

Option E: Proximity, Cultural dissensus, Temporal immediacy. Proximity is about being close. Cultural dissensus is a lot of disagreement. If there's a lot of disagreement, perhaps moral intensity is lower because the group is divided. So, this might lower the impact.

Option F: Proximity, Social consensus, Temporal dissensus. Social consensus again makes moral intensity high. But if temporal dissensus is a lot, that's about time. So, if it's a long time ago, the immediacy is lower. So, maybe the situation is recent but from a group that's in agreement, which would have high moral intensity.

Option G: Cultural consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. Same as option B, but again, option B is more about social consensus. So perhaps G is not the best fit.

Option H: Proximity, Temporal immediacy, Social dissensus. If social dissensus is high, meaning a lot of disagreement, that would lower moral intensity. So, this wouldn't be a factor that impacts.

Option I: Proximity, Social dissensus, Futility of effect. Hmm, "futility of effect" is a concept I've heard in research. It refers to whether the effect is useful or not. But I'm not sure how this relates to moral intensity. Maybe if the situation is irrelevant or unhelpful, but I'm not sure that's a factor in moral intensity. So probably not the right option.

Option J: Social dissensus, Temporal immediacy, Distance. Social dissensus is high, so moral intensity would be low. Plus, distance is about how far apart you are. So this doesn't make sense. It would lower moral intensity.

So, going back to the options, the correct combination is likely option B: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. Because:

- Social consensus would mean everyone agrees on what's important, so the situation is more consistent (higher moral intensity).
- Temporal immediacy is when the situation is recent, which is more impactful.
- Proximity means they're close, so the situation is immediate and perhaps more powerful.

Wait another thought: option B says social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity. So, all three factors together. That makes sense. So the answer should be option B.

The question asks which factors impact moral intensity. Moral intensity refers to the strength of moral feelings. Factors considered include social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity.

- **Social consensus** increases moral intensity as people's values are consistent.
- **Temporal immediacy** highlights the importance of recent situations.
- **Proximity** emphasizes the impact of closeness.

Option B, **Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity**, fits best, as it combines these elements to explain how moral intensity is influenced.

ANSWER: B
