Okay, so I've got this question about a capacitor, and I need to find the insulation resistance. Let me think through it step by step.

First, the problem says it's a precision 1 microfarad capacitor. So, the capacitance C is 1 μF, which is 1e-6 farads. The voltage is 1V at t=0, and then it's disconnected from the source, so it's just discharging. The voltage drops to 0.9V in 100 hours. I need to find the insulation resistance, which I think is the resistance of the material between the plates.

Wait, I remember that for discharging capacitors, the voltage decreases exponentially with time. The formula I think is V(t) = V0 * e^(-t/(RC)), where V is the voltage at time t, V0 is the initial voltage, R is resistance, and C is capacitance.

So plugging in the numbers given. V0 is 1V, V(t) is 0.9V. Time t is 100 hours. Hmm, but I should convert that into seconds because the units for R and C are in ohms and farads, which are SI units. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify, but I think for the formula, it's better to have time in seconds.

So, 100 hours is 100 * 60 * 60 seconds. Let me calculate that: 100 * 3600 = 360,000 seconds. So t=3.6e5 seconds.

Now, the formula: 0.9 = 1 * e^(-t/(RC)).

So, taking natural logs on both sides: ln(0.9) = -t/(RC).

Wait, the left side is ln(0.9). Let me compute that. Ln(0.9) is approximately -0.10536.

So, -0.10536 = -(3.6e5)/(R*C). The negatives cancel out and I can write 0.10536 = 3.6e5/(R*1e-6).

Solving for R: R = 3.6e5 * 1e-6 / 0.10536.

Wait, let me compute that. 3.6e5 is 360,000. Multiply by 1e-6 gives 0.36. So 0.36 / 0.10536 is approximately what?

Let me compute 0.36 divided by 0.10536. Let me see, 0.10536 * 3.4 is about 0.358, which is close to 0.36. So 3.4 is roughly the value.

So R ≈ 3.4 * 1e12 ohms? Because 0.36 / 0.10536 ≈ 3.4.

Wait, but the options are all in 1e12 or 1e13. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let's recalculate.

t is 100 hours: 100 * 3600 = 360000 seconds. So t=3.6e5 s.

The equation is:

0.9 = e^(-t/(RC))

Take ln of both sides:

ln(0.9) = -t/(RC)

So, - ln(0.9) = t/(RC)

So, 100 hours = (t) = 3.6e5 s.

Wait, let me compute 1/(R*C) = (1/(R * C)) = (ln(0.9) * (R C)) = 1/(t) ) → wait, no, let me rearrange:

t/(R C) = -ln(0.9) → R C = t / (-ln(0.9)).

Wait, let's compute t/(R C) = (ln(0.9) is -0.10536, so the negative cancels, so t/(R C) = 0.10536.

So, R C = t / 0.10536.

t is 3.6e5 s.

So, R C = (3.6e5) / 0.10536.

Compute that: 3.6e5 is 360,000.

360,000 / 0.10536 ≈ 3,411,518 ohm-farad.

But since C is 1e-6 F, R is R = (3.411518e6 ohm-F) / (1e-6 F) ) → 3.411518e12 ohms.

So R is approximately 3.4e12 ohms. Looking at the options, option C is 3.42e12, which matches. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again. Let me recompute the division.

360,000 divided by 0.10536.

Let me compute 360,000 / 0.10536.

Well, 0.10536 * 3.4e12 would be 3.4e12 * 0.10536 = 3.4e12 * 1.0536e-1 → 3.4e12 * 0.10536 = (3.4 * 0.10536) * 1e12.

3.4 * 0.10536 is 0.358584. So 0.358584e12 → 3.58584e11, which is 3.58584e11 ohm-farad, but that can't be right because R*C would be in ohm-farad units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me see: R in ohms, C in farads, so R*C is ohm-farad units.

Wait, 3.6e5 s divided by (0.10536) is 3.6e5 / 0.10536 = approx 3,411,518 ohm-farad.

But since C is 1e-6 F, R = (3.411518e6) ohms.

Because R = (3.6e5 s) / (0.10536) → 3.6e5 / 0.10536 = 3411518. Ohms.

So R is approximately 3.41e6 ohms? Wait, no. Wait, wait, because R*C is 3.41e6 ohm-farad.

Oh wait, because R * C = 3.41e6 ohm-farad.

Wait, no, let's see: 3.6e5 s divided by 0.10536 is 3411518 ohm-farad. So R*C = 3.41e6 ohm-farad? That can't be, because 3.41e6 ohm-farad is R*C, but R is in ohms and C in farads. Wait, oh wait, ohm-farad is equivalent to ohms when you multiply R (ohms) and C (farads) because ohm = (voltage)/current, and ohm-farad is (voltage * farad) = (voltage * (1/(ohm*farad)) * voltage) → wait, I'm getting confused. Oh, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. So when I compute R*C = 3.41e6 ohm-farad? But that doesn't make sense because ohm-farad is not a unit. Oh, wait no, the unit is unitless? No, ohm and farad are units, so their product is ohm-farad. But in the equation, it's R*C = (t) / (ln(0.9)).

Wait, perhaps I should calculate R as (t/(ln(0.9))) / C.

t is 3.6e5 s, ln(0.9) is approx -0.10536.

So t/(ln(0.9)) is 3.6e5 / 0.10536 ≈ 3.411518e6 ohm-farad.

Wait, but R is in ohms, and C in farads. So R = (t/(ln(0.9))) / C.

C is 1e-6 F. So R = (3.411518e6) / (1e-6) = 3.411518e12 ohms.

So R is about 3.41e12 ohms. Looking at the options, option C is 3.42e12, so that's the closest. So the answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the voltage decay of a discharging capacitor:

\[
V(t) = V_0 e^{-t/(RC)}
\]

### Given:
- Initial voltage, \( V_0 = 1 \, \text{V} \)
- Voltage at \( t = 100 \, \text{hours} \), \( V(t) = 0.9 \, \text{V} \)
- Capacitance, \( C = 1 \, \mu\text{F} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Time, \( t = 100 \, \text{hours} \)

### Step 1: Convert time to seconds
\[
t = 100 \, \text{hours} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} = 360,000 \, \text{seconds} = 3.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the formula
\[
\ln\left(\frac{V(t)}{V_0}\right) = -\frac{t}{RC}
\]
\[
\ln(0.9) = -\frac{t}{RC}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( R \)
\[
-\ln(0.9) = \frac{t}{RC}
\]
\[
R = \frac{t}{-\ln(0.9) \cdot C}
\]

### Step 4: Substitute values
\[
\ln(0.9) \approx -0.10536
\]
\[
R = \frac{3.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{s}}{-(-0.10536) \cdot 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}}
\]
\[
R = \frac{3.6 \times 10^5}{0.10536 \times 1 \times 10^{-6}}
\]
\[
R = \frac{3.6 \times 10^5}{1.0536 \times 10^{-7}}
\]
\[
R \approx 3.41 \times 10^{12} \, \Omega
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The closest option to \( 3.41 \times 10^{12} \, \Omega \) is **Option C: \( 3.42 \times 10^{12} \, \Omega \)**.
