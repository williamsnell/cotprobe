Question:

When the atria contract, only 30% of the ventricular space becomes filled. How does the additional 70% become filled? Describe the process of the cardiac cycle in general.

Options:

A: Ventricular filling is achieved through nervous stimulation.
B: 70% of the ventricular filling occurs during diastole due to passive flow as the atrial pressure is greater than the ventricular pressure.
C: The additional 70% is filled by the gravitational force when the body is in a specific position.
D: The remaining ventricular space is filled by pulmonary backflow during inhalation.
E: Ventricular filling is supplemented by the contraction of auxiliary heart chambers.
F: Ventricular filling is completed by muscular constriction of the ventricles.
G: Ventricular filling for the remaining 70% is regulated by hormonal changes during the cardiac cycle.
H: Ventricular filling occurs during systole due to active flow.
I: The remaining 70% of ventricular filling is due to contraction of the atria.
J: The last 70% of ventricular filling is aided by the opening and closing of the semilunar valves.

Okay, I'm trying to answer this cardiology question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about how the ventricles fill during the cardiac cycle when only 30% of the space is filled with atrial contraction. So, only 30%, and the rest 70% fills up. I need to figure out how this happens and pick the correct option from A to J.

First, I should remember the structure of the heart. The heart is divided into two atria and two ventricles. The ventricles are the lower chambers, and they contract to pump blood out. The atria are the upper chambers; they relax when the ventricles contract.

The question says that when the atria contract, only 30% of the ventricular space is filled. So, the ventricles are mostly empty, and a lot of their function comes from the atrial contraction.

I think the key here is understanding the phases of the cardiac cycle. The cycle goes through systole and diastole. Systole is when the ventricles contract, and diastole is when they relax.

In diastole, the atrial pressure is higher than the ventricular pressure because the atria are still relaxed. So, the ventricles have to contract to fill up. When the atria contract, the ventricles start to fill, but only 30% of that happens. The remaining 70% must come from other sources.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: " Ventricular filling is achieved through nervous stimulation." That's probably true, but it's part of the process, not the reason for the 70% part. So, this might be correct, but not the answer to the question.

Option B: "70% of the ventricular filling occurs during diastole due to passive flow as the atrial pressure is greater than the ventricular pressure." Hmm, passive flow refers to the natural process of ventricles relaxing normally. So, when the atrial pressure is higher, which it is during diastole, the ventricles have to pump to fill. But why 70%? I'm not sure if it's 70% because of passive flow or something else. Maybe it's about the passive flow overcoming passive resistance.

Option C: "The additional 70% is filled by the gravitational force when the body is in a specific position." I don't think gravitational force is a primary mechanism here. That's more about muscle tension or something else, like muscle movement in other parts, perhaps the heart muscle.

Option D: "The remaining ventricular space is filled by pulmonary backflow during inhalation." Pulmonary backflow is when blood flows back into the lungs through the pulmonary valve when you breathe in. That's during inhalation. But the 70% part—would that be the case here? I don't think so, because that's a separate process, more related to the lungs, not the heart.

Option E: " Ventricular filling is supplemented by the contraction of auxiliary heart chambers." Auxiliary heart chambers, like the Purkinje or other nodes, contract to pump. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question is about the ventricles' own filling, so this might not be the main reason.

Option F: "The remaining ventricular space is filled by muscular constriction of the ventricles." That makes sense. The atrial contraction causes the ventricles to contract, but only 30% fills. The remaining 70% must come from the contraction of the ventricles themselves. So, perhaps the ventricles are being pulled apart more because of the diastolic phase.

Wait, but under the diastole phase, the ventricles are mostly empty. When the atrial contraction occurs, it's a contraction of the ventricles. If only 30% is filled, the rest must be from the ventricles' own contraction. So, the 70% is from the ventricles' own contract—so F.

Option G: " regulated by hormonal changes during the cardiac cycle." I don't think hormones are the main cause here. They might have some role, but the primary mechanism for filling is the contraction of the ventricles.

Option H: "The remaining 70% is due to contraction of the atria." That doesn't make sense. The atria are relaxing, so their contraction would be less. They're the ones relaxing, not contracting.

Option I: "The remaining 70% is due to contraction of the atria." No, that's incorrect. The atria are the ones relaxing; their contraction would be minimal, not the dominant reason.

Option J: "The last 70% is aided by the opening and closing of the semilunar valves." Semilunar valves open and close to allow blood to flow from the ventricles to the atria. But that's during filling, not the empty phase. So, during diastole, this process isn't happening because the ventricles are already relaxed.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be option F. The remaining 70% is filled by the ventricles contracting, especially during diastole.

The question asks how the remaining 70% of ventricular space is filled when only 30% is filled during atrial contraction. 

- **Option A** is partially correct but doesn't explain the 70% part.
- **Option B** suggests 70% is due to passive flow, but the 70% is more likely due to active contraction.
- **Option C** mentions gravitational force, which isn't relevant.
- **Option D** refers to pulmonary backflow during inhalation, unrelated to the ventricles.
- **Option E** talks about auxiliary heart chambers, which isn't the primary mechanism.
- **Option F** correctly identifies that the remaining 70% is filled by the ventricles' own contraction during diastole.
- **Options G, H, I, J** are incorrect as they either involve hormones or unrelated processes like semilunar valves.

The correct answer is **F**, as the remaining 70% is filled by the ventricles' own contraction during diastole.
