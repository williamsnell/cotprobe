Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about real GNP, money supply, and the price level. Hmm, I remember that these are related to the quantity theory of money. 

The question says that real GNP doubles, and the quantity of money increases by 80%. Oh wait, the velocity of money is constant. Right, so velocity is the number of times money gets spent each period. I think the formula is something like M * V = P * Y, where M is money, V is velocity, P is price level, and Y is real GDP.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The quantity theory of money is often stated as MV = PY, right? So if velocity (V) is constant, then M and Y must adjust accordingly to keep the equation balanced, assuming P changes.

In this problem, real GNP (which is Y) doubles. So Y becomes 2Y. The money supply (M) increases by 80%, so M becomes 1.8M. And V is constant. So the equation before and after would be:

Before: M * V = P * Y
After: (1.8M) * V = P' * (2Y)

Wait, but I think the question is about the price level, P. Let's solve for P'. 

So, from the first equation, P = (M * V) / Y. After the changes, P' = (1.8 M * V) / (2 Y). Let's compute that.

That would be (1.8 / 2) * (M V / Y) = (0.9) * P. So the new price level is 0.9 times the original, meaning it drops by 10%. 

Looking at the options, option B says the price level drops by 10%. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the equations. Another way: The growth rate. Real GNP (Y) grows by 100% (doubles) and money (M) grows by 80%. Since V is constant, the price level's growth rate is (80% + 100%) - V... wait, no, that's not right. The equation is M V = P Y. So when M increases by 80% and Y doubles, what's the change in P?

Let me think in terms of growth rates. If M increases by 80% (so M is multiplied by 1.8), and Y doubles (times 2), then the right-hand side becomes 1.8 * 2 = 3.6 times the original M*V. So P must have increased by 3.6 times, but wait that can't be right because the options don't show that. 

Wait, no, that approach might be wrong because I'm considering multiplicative factors. Let me go back to the basic formula: M*V = P*Y.

Before: M1 * V = P1 * Y1
After: M2 * V = P2 * Y2

We can write M2/M1 = (P2/P1) * (Y2/Y1)

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because M/V = P*Y, so if V is constant, then M/V is proportional to P*Y. So, initially, M1/V = P1 * Y1.
After, M2/V = P2 * Y2.

Dividing them, (M2/V) / (M1/V) )= (P2 * Y2) / (P1 * Y1) => M2/M1 = (P2/P1) * (Y2/Y1)

We know Y2/Y1 is 2 (real GNP doubles), M2/M1 is 1.8 (M increases by 80%). So 1.8 = (P2/P1) * 2 => (P2/P1) = 1.8 /2 = 0.9. So P2 is 0.9 P1, which is a 10% decrease. So the price level drops by 10%, so option B is correct.

The question involves analyzing the relationship between real GNP (Y), money supply (M), velocity of money (V), and the price level (P) using the equation \( MV = PY \). 

Initially, the real GNP (Y) doubles, and the money supply (M) increases by 80%. The velocity of money (V) is constant. Using the formula:

\[
\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{P_2}{P_1} \cdot \frac{Y_2}{Y_1}
\]

we substitute the known values:

\[
\frac{M_2}{M_1} = 1.8 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{Y_2}{Y_1} = 2
\]

Rearranging for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{M_2}{M_1} \cdot \frac{Y_1}{Y_2} = \frac{1.8}{2} = 0.9
\]

This means the new price level \( P_2 \) is 90% of the original price level \( P_1 \), indicating a 10% decrease. 

Thus, the price level drops by 10%, corresponding to option B.
