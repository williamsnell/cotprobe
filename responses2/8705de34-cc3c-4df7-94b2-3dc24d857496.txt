Okay, so I've got this question about finding the molecular weight of a gas under certain conditions. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the gas has a density of 2.50 grams per liter, is at 98°C, and the pressure is 0.974 atm. They assume ideal gas behavior, so I can probably use the ideal gas law here. Hmm, right. The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT, but I think there's another form that relates density. Oh wait, maybe using density in terms of molar mass.

Wait, another thought: the density (d) of a gas can be expressed as d = (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. Yeah, that sounds right. So if I can rearrange that formula to solve for M, that would give me the molar mass, which is the molecular weight.

Let me jot that down. So, M = (d * R * T) / P. 

But wait, R is the universal gas constant. I remember that R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when pressure is in atm and volume in liters. Oh wait, in this case, the pressure is given as 0.974 atm, which is a bit less than 1. So I'll have to plug that in.

First, I need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. So 98°C is 98 + 273.15 = 371.15 K. I'll approximate that to 371.15 K for calculations.

Now, let's plug the numbers into the formula. d is 2.50 g/L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 371.15 K, and P is 0.974 atm.

Let me compute M = (2.50 g/L * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 371.15 K) / 0.974 atm.

Wait, let me calculate the numerator first. 2.50 * 0.0821 is 0.20525. Then multiply by 371.15: 0.20525 * 371.15. Let me see, 0.2 * 371 is about 74.2, 0.00525 * 371 is about 1.95. So approximately 74.2 + 1.95 = 76.15. So numerator is about 76.15.

Divide that by 0.974 atm. 76.15 / 0.974 ≈ 78.24. So M ≈ 78.24 g/mol.

Wait a second, but looking at the options: option C is 76.4, H is 78.1, I is 73.8, etc. So 78.24 is closest to 78.1, which is option H. But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Let me redo the calculation more accurately. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, d is 2.50 g/L.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T is 98 + 273.15 = 371.15 K.

P is 0.974 atm.

So M = (2.50 * 0.0821 * 371.15) / 0.974.

Compute numerator: 2.50 * 0.0821 = 0.20525.

0.20525 * 371.15: let's compute this.

371.15 * 0.2 = 74.23.

371.15 * 0.00525 = ?

0.005 * 371.15 = 1.85575.

0.00025 * 371.15 = 0.0927875.

So 1.85575 + 0.0927875 = 1.9485375.

So total numerator is 74.23 + 1.9485 ≈ 76.1785.

So numerator is approximately 76.1785.

Denominator is 0.974.

So M = 76.1785 / 0.974 ≈ 78.24.

Hmm, 78.24 g/mol. Now looking at the options, option H is 78.1 g/mol. So that's the closest.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up Kelvin and Celsius. Oh wait, temperature is 98°C, which is 371.15 K, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should carry more decimal places, but I think the approximate calculation is okay.

Another thing to consider: did I mix up R? Like, sometimes I confuse the value of R. Oh wait, R is 0.0821, not 8.314 or something else. Because if I used the wrong R, the value would be way off. But no, in this case, I think I used the correct R.

Wait, another approach: maybe express R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) is correct. So the calculation seems right. So the molecular weight is approximately 78.24 g/mol, so among the options, option H is 78.1 g/mol, which is the closest.

To determine the molecular weight (molar mass) of the gas under the given conditions, we use the relationship between density, pressure, temperature, and molar mass:

\[
M = \frac{d \cdot R \cdot T}{P}
\]

Where:
- \(d = 2.50 \, \text{g/L}\) (density of the gas),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\) (gas constant),
- \(T = 98^\circ \text{C} = 371.15 \, \text{K}\) (temperature in Kelvin),
- \(P = 0.974 \, \text{atm}\) (pressure).

### Step 1: Calculate the numerator
\[
d \cdot R \cdot T = 2.50 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 371.15
\]
First, calculate \(2.50 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.20525\).  
Then, multiply by \(371.15\):  
\[
0.20525 \cdot 371.15 \approx 76.1785
\]

### Step 2: Divide by pressure
\[
M = \frac{76.1785}{0.974} \approx 78.24 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated molar mass is approximately \(78.24 \, \text{g/mol}\). Among the provided options, the closest value is \(78.1 \, \text{g/mol}\), which corresponds to option H.
