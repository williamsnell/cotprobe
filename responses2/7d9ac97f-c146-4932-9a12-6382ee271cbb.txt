Okay, I've got this question about the calories a woman should eat during pregnancy. Hmm, I remember that pre-pregnancy energy needs are usually around 2000-2500 calories. But during pregnancy, especially the first trimester, I think the body is more active, so maybe she needs more. Oh wait, I've heard before that women need more calories during pregnancy. Like, in the first trimester, maybe they need 300-400 kCal a day. But wait, the options don't have exactly that number. Let me look again.

The options are A to J. Option A suggests no change until the third trimester, adding 500. But I think the increase is more like 200 or 300. Option B says no change, which doesn't make sense because pregnancy does require more energy. Option C says a decrease, which I don't think is correct. Option D says 300 only in second and third, but I've heard that the increase is more consistent, maybe 200-300. Option E is less than 200, which doesn't seem right because she definitely needs more. Option F says only second trimester, which I don't think is the case. Option G says 200 throughout, but I think it's more than that.

Wait, another thought: I remember that in the first three trimesters, women typically gain around 200-300 kCal per day. So if pre-pregnancy is 2500, during pregnancy maybe 2800-3000. But the options don't have 2800, so the closest is 200 or 300. Looking at the options, D says 300 only in second and third. But that's only adding 300, which might be an increase. But wait, maybe the increase is more consistent. Option G says additional 200 throughout, which suggests 200 a day, but that seems too low because I've heard more.

Wait, another angle: The initial increase could be 200-300. But the options don't have that, so the closest is G: 200 throughout. But wait, another point: I think the increase is more like 200 kCal each day during the first three trimesters. So if she's gaining around 200 per day, which would be an additional 200 kCal each day, during each of those trimesters. So the correct answer would be G, which says "an additional 200 kCal throughout pregnancy." So for each of the first three, she needs to add 200.

Wait, but sometimes the increase is more like 300. So perhaps the right answer is G for 200, and another option is H for 300. Let me think again.

I think the correct answer is that during pregnancy, women generally need an additional 200-300 kCal each day. So if the options are G for 200 and H for 300, but the question is asking how much. The options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, the question is asking how many calories she should eat each day during pregnancy. So the correct answer would be that she needs to eat more. The correct answer is that she gains around 200-300 per day, which would correspond to G: 200 over all three, or H: 300. But which one is it?

I think the standard recommendation is that women during pregnancy should gain about 200-300 kCal per day, so each day they need to eat an additional that amount. So if the options are G and H, but the question is about which option is correct. The options are G: additional 200 throughout, and H: 300. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking at the answer options again, the user's options are:

A: No change until third, add 500.

B: No change.

C: Decrease.

D: 300 only 2nd and 3rd.

E: Less than 200.

F: 200 only second.

G: 200 throughout.

H: 300 only third.

I: 500 throughout.

J: 200 only first.

So the correct answer is that she needs to add 200-300 each day. But none have 200-300. So I think the answer is G: an additional 200 throughout, because that would mean each day, she needs to eat 200 more.

Alternatively, another thought: I've read that women's energy needs during pregnancy increase by about 200-300 kCal per day. So the correct answer would be that they need to add 200-300. So the right option is G, because it's additional 200 throughout. So the answer is G.
