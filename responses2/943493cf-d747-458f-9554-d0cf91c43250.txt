Question:

A brother and a sister purchased land under a deed that conveyed title to them as joint tenants with right ofsurvivorship. Common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. The purchase price was $50,000, of which the sister paid $10,000 and the brother paid $40,000. The sisterlater mortgaged her interest in the land. The brother then died testate, leaving his entire estate to a cousin. Thesister later paid off her mortgage debt, and the mortgage was released. At the present time, who owns the land?

Options:

A: Title is entirely in the cousin as the beneficiary of the brother's will.
B: The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory ofmortgages.
C: The brother's share of the land is in probate, while the sister retains her original share.
D: Title is in the sister, the cousin, and the mortgage lender as tenants in common.
E: Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 40% interest and the cousin having a 60% interest.
F: Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.
G: Title is in the sister and the cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship.
H: Title is in the sister as she has paid off her mortgage debt.
I: Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and thecousin having an 80% interest.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this land ownership question. Let me read through it again. 

The problem is about joint tenants in a common law tenancy. The land was purchased for $50k, with the sister paying $10k and the brother paying $40k. The sister morgaged her interest later, brother died, sister paid the mortgage, and now the title is up. The question is about who owns the land now.

Hmm. I remember that joint tenants with right of survivorship share the property together. But there are some nuances when mortgagees come into play.

Wait, the sister morgaged her interest. I think that's a right of survivorship mortgage. So her interest was part of the joint tenancy. When she morgages it, she becomes a mortgagor. But in a joint tenancy, mortgaging can affect the ownership.

Wait, in a joint tenancy, each joint owner has an interest. When one joint owner morgages their interest, that could change who owns the property. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact mechanics. Let me think.

In a joint tenancy, if one joint tenant morgages their interest, they can't transfer it without the other joint tenant's consent. Because the right of survivorship applies. So the mortgagor's interest is part of the joint tenancy but is no longer part of the survivorship unless the other joint tenant takes over.

Wait, but when a joint tenant morgages their interest, they become a mortgagor. And if the other joint tenant dies, does the mortgagor still have the right of survivorship? Or does the survivorship apply only to the surviving joint tenant?

Wait, right of survivorship in a joint tenancy applies to the surviving joint tenant. So if the sister morgages her interest, her interest is part of the joint tenancy. If the brother dies, then the sister's right of survivorship would still apply to her, right? Because the survivorship is about the surviving joint tenant, not the individual mortgagor.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the right of survivorship is about the property, not the individual. The joint tenancy's right of survivorship applies to the surviving joint tenant. So if the sister morgages her interest (so she can't pass it on unless the brother takes it over), but since the right of survivorship is about the joint tenancy, the survivorship refers to whether the other joint tenant (brother) is alive or not. Because the sister's interest is part of the joint tenancy.

Wait, so if the brother dies, the sister's right of survivorship would still apply to her, because the right of survivorship is about the property's ownership, not the individual mortgagor. So the sister's interest is still part of the joint tenancy, and the right of survivorship is to the surviving joint tenant. So the sister's interest is still part of the tenancy.

Wait, but when the sister morgages her interest, she's transferring her share. But the right of survivorship is about who owns the property, not who can take it. So the right of survivorship would still go to the brother, but the sister is morgaging her share. So that would affect the surviving joint tenant's right.

Wait, let me think of the steps:

1. The sister pays $10k. Then she morgages her interest. So her share is in the joint tenancy but can't sell it unless the brother takes it over. But the right of survivorship is to the brother. So when the brother dies, the sister's right of survivorship still applies to her.

Wait, no. Wait, the right of survivorship is not about who the joint tenant is, but who holds the property. So the right of survivorship goes to whoever is alive. So if the sister morgages her interest, her right is to hold that interest until the brother dies. But the right of survivorship would go to the brother, not the sister.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as the right of survivorship applies to the property's ownership. So if the sister has a mortgage, her interest is still part of the joint tenancy. The right of survivorship (the tenancy's right) would go to the brother if he dies. So the sister's interest is still alive, but can't sell it. Because she's morgaging it. 

Wait, no. Let me try to break it down.

Original scenario:

- Joint tenancy, right of survivorship. So the property is held by both the sister and the brother, with the right of survivorship to the brother if he dies.

- The sister buys the land for $10k, brother for $40k. So the total is $50k.

- The sister morgages her interest. So she can't transfer it unless the brother takes it over. But the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the sister's interest is still part of the joint tenancy, but her interest is mortgaged. So when the brother dies, the sister's interest is still alive, but she can't transfer it, and the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the sister's interest is still part of the joint tenancy but not part of the survivorship.

Wait, no. Wait, when the right of survivorship applies, it's that the surviving joint tenant has the right to use the property. So if the sister's interest is mortgaged, her right of survivorship is still hers to the brother. So the sister's interest is still alive, but she can't sell it. The brother can't take it over unless the sister takes it over, but since the sister is still alive, the right of survivorship is to the brother.

Wait, but the sister is the one who morgaged her interest. So she has a claim, but the right of survivorship would transfer to the brother. So when the brother dies, the right of survivorship is to him. So the sister's interest is still alive, but she can't transfer it.

So, when the brother dies, the sister's interest is still in the joint tenancy, and she can't sell it because she's morgaging it. But her share is still hers. The right of survivorship goes to the brother. 

Wait, but the sister's interest is part of the joint tenancy. So she's still part of it. But she can't transfer her interest. So the tenancy remains, but the property's ownership is still with the sister and brother. But the right of survivorship is to the brother. 

Wait, but if the sister has a mortgage, she can't transfer her interest. But the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still owned by both. But the sister's interest is mortgaged. So when the brother dies, the sister's interest remains, but she can't sell it. The right of survivorship goes to the brother.

Wait, but the sister's share is still hers. So the right of survivorship is to the brother, but the sister's interest is still alive.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are about who owns the land after the events.

The key points are:

- The right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still jointly owned by both sister and brother, but the right of survivorship is to the brother.

But sister has morgaged her interest. So she can't sell it. But she can't transfer it because the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still jointly owned by both, but the sister's share is mortgaged.

Wait, no. Wait, the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still held by both, but the right of survivorship passes to the brother. So the sister's share is still in the tenancy, but she can't transfer it. So when the brother dies, he takes over the property, but the sister's share is still hers.

Wait, but the sister has already mortgaged her interest. So she can't sell it, but the brother is alive. So the sister's interest is still part of the joint tenancy, but she can't sell it. So the property is still jointly owned by both, but the sister's share is mortgaged.

But the question is, what is the current owner of the land? The options are about how the ownership is split.

Wait, but the sister's interest is mortgaged, so she can't own the property without the brother's consent. So when the brother dies, the sister's interest is subject to the right of survivorship, but she can't transfer it because she's morgaging it. So the property is still jointly held by both, but the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the sister's share is still hers. The brother takes over the property, but the sister's interest is still hers.

Wait, but the answer options don't reflect this. Let's look at the options.

Option E: Title is in the sister and cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and the cousin 80%. But wait, in a joint tenancy, the interests are typically in common unless otherwise stated. But in the problem, the sister paid $10k, brother $40k, so the initial ownership was in a joint tenancy with equal shares? Or not?

Wait, the question says the purchase price was $50k, sister paid $10k, brother $40k. So the initial shares were 20% and 80%.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, the initial shares are equal unless each contributes to the purchase price. So each joint owner initially has an equal share. So the sister and brother each contributed $10k and $40k, but that's a total of $50k. So the sister's share is $10k / $50k = 20%. The brother's share is 40% /50k = 80%? Wait, no, wait. The purchase price is split based on the contributions. So the sister paid $10k, brother $40k. So the ratio is 1:4. So the sister's share is 1/(1+4) = 20%, brother's 80%.

But in a joint tenancy, each joint owner has a right to use the property without worrying about the other joint owner. But in a joint tenancy, the interest is split between them. So each has a 20% and 80% share. But wait, does that apply here?

Wait, the problem says it's a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. So each joint owner has an interest. The sister's interest is 20%, brother 80%. But the sister morgaged her interest, so she can't transfer it. The right of survivorship is to the brother if he dies.

So when the brother dies, he takes over the joint tenancy, but the sister's interest is still in the tenancy. So the property is still held by both, but their claims are split. The sister has a 20% interest, brother 80% but can't take it over. Wait, but the right of survivorship would pass to the brother, but the sister's interest is still there. So when the sister morgages her 20% interest, the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the sister's interest remains with her, but she can't sell it.

So the current ownership is that both the sister and the brother each have their own shares. The right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still in the tenancy, but the sister's share is mortgaged.

Wait, but in the options, option G says the sister and cousin have joint tenants with right of survivorship. So option G says it's a joint tenancy. But the question states the purchase price was $50k, and the sister paid $10k, brother $40k. So the initial shares were 20% and 80%. So the sister and brother have each taken their share.

But in a joint tenancy, each joint owner's interest is 20% and 80% initially. But sister then morgages her 20%, so she can't transfer that. But the right of survivorship goes to the brother if he dies. So the property remains in a joint tenancy, but the sister's interest is mortgaged.

Wait, but the question is about the current ownership. So the sister's interest is still hers, but her share is mortgaged, meaning she cannot transfer it. The brother now has the right of survivorship, so he takes over the property. But the sister's share is still hers, because she can't transfer it. So the sister's interest is still hers, and the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still owned by both, but the sister's share is mortgaged.

Wait, but when the brother dies, he takes over the property. But the sister's share is mortgaged. So the property is still held by the sister, but her share is mortgaged. The right of survivorship is to the brother, so he takes over the entire property. But the sister's interest is still hers.

So, the current ownership would be that the sister has a 20% interest (but mortgaged), and the brother has 80% (in survivorship but not mortgaged? Or does the brother's share remain as 80%? )

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the ownership structure here. Let me try to think about it again.

When a joint tenancy is created, the ownership is split between the joint tenants. Each joint owner has a right to use the property as a tenant. The right of survivorship is to the surviving joint owner.

In this case, the sister and brother each bought their own share. But the sister, paying $10k, contributed 1/5 of the total (since 10k +40k=50k). So she has a 20% interest, brother 80%. So in a joint tenancy, each joint owner has their own interest. The sister's interest is 20%, brother 80%. 

But then the sister morgages her 20%. So she can't transfer her share. The right of survivorship is still to the brother. So when the brother dies, he takes over the property, but the sister's 20% interest is still hers.

Wait, but the right of survivorship passes to the brother, so the property is held by both. But the sister's interest is still hers. So the sister has her 20% interest, but it's mortgaged. The brother takes over the property, so he holds the entire 50k, but his interest is in the survivorship. Because the right of survivorship is to the brother, he's the one who takes over.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is about who gets the property now. So the sister's share is still hers, but her share is mortgaged, meaning she can't sell it. So the property is still held by both, but the sister's share is subject to a mortgage. The brother takes over, so he takes the entire 50k. But the right of survivorship is to him, so he holds the property, but his share is the total.

Wait, but that's not correct. The right of survivorship is not about the property's current owner but about who can use the property. So if the right of survivorship is to the brother, then the property is still in the joint tenancy, but the sister's share is still hers. The brother takes over the property, but his interest is now in the survivorship.

But wait, no. The right of survivorship would transfer to the surviving joint owner, regardless of who's paying the mortgage. So the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still held by both, but the sister's share is mortgaged. The right of survivorship would pass to the brother, but the sister's interest is still hers. So when the brother dies, he takes over the property. But the sister has a 20% interest in the property, but it's mortgaged.

Wait, but the question is asking who owns the land now. The options are about who owns the land.

Option E says the sister and cousin have tenants in common, sister 20%, cousin 80%. But that's if it's a tenancy in common, not joint tenancy. So that's probably not the case here.

Option G says it's a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. So sister and brother are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. So the sister and brother each have a claim, but the right of survivorship goes to the brother if he dies.

But the sister has already mortgaged her share. So she can't transfer it. So the right of survivorship is to the brother, but the sister's share is still hers. So when the brother dies, he takes over the property, but the sister's share remains. So the property is still in the joint tenancy, with the sister owning 20% and brother 80%.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still held by both, but the sister's share is mortgaged. So the current owner would be the sister, but with a mortgaged share. The brother's share is 80%, but he can't sell it. But in a joint tenancy, the shares are still in the joint tenancy.

Wait, but the sister's share is mortgaged, so she can't sell it. But the right of survivorship is to the brother. So when the brother dies, he takes over the property, but the sister has a 20% claim. So the property is now held by the sister, but she can't sell it. Wait, but the right of survivorship is to the brother, so the property is now with the brother, but the sister has a claim to the property.

Wait, no. If the right of survivorship is to the brother, he takes over the property. The sister's share is in the joint tenancy, but she can't sell it because she's morgaging it. So the property is still in the joint tenancy, with the sister's share being mortgaged. But the right of survivorship (to the brother) has passed, meaning he takes over the property.

Wait, but the sister's share is still in the joint tenancy, just a mortgaged share. So when the brother dies, he takes over the property, but the sister still owns the property in the joint tenancy, but she can't transfer it because she's morgaging it. So the property is still in the joint tenancy, but the sister's share is mortgaged.

So the current owner is the sister, but she can't sell her share. The right of survivorship would have passed to the brother, meaning he takes over the property.

Wait, but the sister's share is still in the joint tenancy, just mortgaged. So when the brother dies, he takes over the property, but the sister's share is still hers. So the property is now in the sister's name, but she can't sell it. The right of survivorship would transfer to the brother, so he takes over the property, but the sister's share is now in the sister's interest, because she can't take it over.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option E: Title is in the sister and cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and the cousin 80%. But that's not a joint tenancy; it's tenancy in common. So that's not the case here, because the purchase price was split between the sister and brother.

So option E is not correct.

Option G: Title is in the sister and cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So the sister and cousin each have an interest, and the right of survivorship is to the cousin if he dies. But in this case, the sister has already morgaged her interest. So this might not be correct.

Wait, option G says the sister and cousin have joint tenants with right of survivorship. But in the problem, the sister's interest is mortgaged, so this might not apply.

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship is to the sister? No, sister's right is to the brother.

Wait, no, the right of survivorship is to the surviving joint tenant. So if the sister morgages her interest, but the right of survivorship is to the brother, then the property is still held by both. The sister's share is mortgaged, but she can't transfer it. So the property is now in the sister's name, but she can't sell her share. The right of survivorship is to the brother, so he takes over the property. But the sister's share is still hers.

So the current owner is the sister, but she can't sell her share. So the sister's interest is still hers, but she's mortgaged.

Wait, but the question is about ownership. So the sister has a 20% interest, which is mortgaged, and the brother has 80% interest, which is in survivorship. So the sister's share is still hers, but she can't sell it. The right of survivorship passes to the brother, but the sister's share remains with her.

So the current owner is the sister, but she can't sell her share. So the answer would be that the sister and cousin each have an interest, with the sister having a 20% and the cousin 80%. But that's not an option.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option E: Sister and cousin as tenants in common, sister 20%, cousin 80%. But that's tenancy in common, not joint tenancy. So the purchase price was split between the sister and brother, so joint tenancy is more likely.

The correct answer is that the sister and the brother are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The sister's share is mortgaged. So the property is still held by both, but the sister's share is subject to a mortgage. The right of survivorship is to the brother, so he takes over the property.

So the current owner is the sister, but she can't sell her share. So the answer would be that the sister and cousin are joint tenants, with the sister having 20% interest and the cousin 80%. But wait, the cousin isn't mentioned. So perhaps the sister and the brother are the only joint tenants.

So the answer would be that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with right of survivorship, sister having 20% and cousin 80%. But that's not an option. 

Looking at the options:

- Option E: Sister and cousin as tenants in common, sister 20%, cousin 80%. But that's tenancy in common, not joint tenancy.

- Option G: Sister and cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship. But that's not the case here, because the sister has already mortgaged her share.

Wait, the sister has a 20% interest, which is mortgaged, and the right of survivorship is to the brother. So the property is still in a joint tenancy, with the sister's share mortgaged and the brother's share in survivorship.

So the current owner is the sister, but she can't sell her share. The right of survivorship is to the brother, so he takes over the property, but the sister's share is still hers.

So, looking at the options, option E is not correct because it's a joint tenancy as tenants in common, not joint tenancy. So that's not the correct answer.

Option G is a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, but in this case, the sister's share is mortgaged, so the correct answer would be that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with right of survivorship, sister 20% and cousin 80%. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A) Title is in the sister and cousin with right of survivorship, sister 20%, cousin 80%. But that's tenancy in common, not joint tenancy.

B) Sister and cousin, title in equal shares, sister 50%, cousin 50%. But that's tenancy in common, not joint tenancy.

C) Sister, cousin, title in equal shares, sister 50%, cousin 50%. Same as B.

D) Sister and cousin, title in equal shares, sister 20%, cousin 80%. But that's tenancy in common, not joint tenancy.

E) Sister and cousin as tenants in common, sister 20%, cousin 80%. That's tenancy in common, not joint tenancy.

F) Sister, cousin, title in equal shares, sister 20%, cousin 80%. Same as E.

G) Sister and cousin, title in joint tenancy, right of survivorship. So the sister and cousin have joint tenancy with right of survivorship. So the sister and cousin own the property, with the right of survivorship to the cousin if he dies. But the sister has already mortgaged her interest, so the right of survivorship is to the cousin, and the sister's share is mortgaged.

Wait, but the question is about who owns the land. The sister has a 20% interest, which is mortgaged, and the right of survivorship is to the cousin if he dies. So the property is still in the joint tenancy, with the sister's share mortgaged. The right of survivorship is to the cousin, so he takes over the property. But the sister's share is still hers.

So, the current owner is the sister, but she can't sell her share. The cousin takes over the property. So the answer would be that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with right of survivorship, sister 20%, cousin 80%.

But that's not an option. The options are:

E) Sister and cousin as tenants in common, sister 20%, cousin 80%. So this is tenancy in common, not joint tenancy.

G) Sister and cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So sister and cousin own the property, with the right of survivorship to the cousin if he dies. But in this case, the right of survivorship would be to the sister, because she's the one who bought the land.

Wait, no. The right of survivorship is determined by the ownership. If the sister and brother each bought their own shares, then the right of survivorship would be to the sister if she dies. But in this problem, the sister has already morgaged her 20% share, so the right of survivorship would be to the cousin, because she's the one who bought the land.

So, the sister and cousin are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The sister's share is mortgaged, and the right of survivorship is to the cousin. So the right of survivorship would pass to the cousin, so he takes over the property. But the sister's share is still hers.

So the current owner is the sister, but she can't sell her share. The cousin takes over the property. So the answer is that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with right of survivorship, sister 20%, cousin 80%.

But that's not one of the options. Let me look again.

The options are:

E) Sister and cousin as tenants in common, sister 20%, cousin 80%.

G) Sister and cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

Wait, the correct answer is that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with right of survivorship, sister 20%, cousin 80%.

But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, the sister and cousin each own an interest, sister has 20% mortgaged, cousin 80% survivorship.

So the answer would be that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with right of survivorship, sister 20%, cousin 80%.

But that's not an option. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) Sister and cousin, title in equal shares, sister 50%, cousin 50%. But that's tenancy in common, not joint tenancy.

B) Sister and cousin, title in equal shares, sister 20%, cousin 80%. Same as A.

C) Same as B.

D) Same as A.

E) Same as B.

F) Same as B.

G) Sister and cousin as joint tenants, right of survivorship. So sister and cousin own the property, right of survivorship to cousin if he dies. But sister has already mortgaged her share, so the right of survivorship would pass to the sister? No, because the right of survivorship is to the surviving joint owner.

Wait, but if the sister and cousin each bought their own shares, then the right of survivorship would pass to the sister if she dies. But in this problem, the sister has already morgaged her interest, so the right of survivorship is to the cousin.

So the sister and cousin are joint tenants with the right of survivorship to the cousin.

So the sister's share is mortgaged, cousin's share is in survivorship.

So the answer is that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with right of survivorship, sister 20%, cousin 80%.

But that's not an option. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) Sister and cousin, title in equal shares, sister 50%, cousin 50%. No.

B) Same as A.

C) Same as B.

D) Same as A.

E) Same as B.

G) Sister and cousin as joint tenants, right of survivorship. So sister and cousin own the property, right of survivorship to the cousin if he dies. But sister has already mortgaged her share, so the right of survivorship would pass to the sister? No, because the right of survivorship is determined by who owns the property.

Wait, perhaps the sister and cousin each own an interest, and the right of survivorship is to the sister if she dies. But the sister has already morgaged her interest, so the right of survivorship is to the cousin.

So the sister and cousin are joint tenants with the right of survivorship to the sister. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship is to the sister, because she bought the land. But no, the right of survivorship is about who owns the property.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the correct answer.

The sister and brother each bought their own shares, so the right of survivorship is to the sister if she dies. But the sister has already morgaged her share, so the right of survivorship is to the cousin.

So the sister and cousin are joint tenants with the right of survivorship to the cousin.

So the answer is that the sister and cousin are joint tenants with the right of survivorship to the cousin, sister 20%, cousin 80%.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is G.

Wait, but option G is "Sister and cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship," which matches our reasoning.

So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The correct answer is **G: Sister and cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship**.

### Explanation:
1. **Joint Tenancy**: The sister and cousin each own an interest in the property, making them joint tenants. This means either one can take over the property, and the other remains the sole owner until the other dies.
2. **Right of Survivorship**: This principle applies to joint tenants, meaning the right of survivorship passes to the surviving joint owner. In this case, the right of survivorship passes to the cousin if the sister dies.
3. **Sister's Share**: The sister has a 20% interest in the property, but it is mortgaged. This mortgaged share represents her claim to the property, and the right of survivorship passes to the cousin.

Thus, the sister and cousin are joint tenants with the right of survivorship to the cousin, with the sister owning a 20% mortgaged interest and the cousin owning an 80% survivorship interest.

ANSWER: G
