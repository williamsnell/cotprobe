Question:

In a secluded county, where prejudice festers and discrimination flourishes, there is a lovely lake, which the county has developed and maintained for recreational purposes. Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership "standards," as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The plaintiff will prevail, because the company is in violation of the county's approved bylaws.
B: The plaintiff will prevail if she can prove the company's policy is based on gender discrimination.
C: The plaintiff will prevail, because the company's policy is discriminatory and violates her civil rights.
D: The plaintiff will lose, because she can use other facilities within the county.
E: The plaintiff will lose, because the company is a private entity and not subject to equal protection laws.
F: The plaintiff will lose, because the company has the right to set its own membership criteria.
G: The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.
H: The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.
I: The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a case involving discrimination against a woman using a golf club. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the scenario carefully.

The county leased part of its lake and surrounding parkland to a company, which required them to build a first-rate yacht house and club. They had to pay 10% of their net profits as rent. The club was open only to members, and there were strict membership standards, including only men being allowed. The membership fee was $5k and monthly dues $75. But there are other facilities available to women. The woman's membership application was denied only because she's a woman, and the issue is whether that's because of discrimination.

The options are A to H, each making a statement about whether the plaintiff will win or lose.

I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's go through each point.

The key issue is whether the company's policy was discriminatory. The bylaws explicitly require members to be male, so any woman who wants to join would be denied membership.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The plaintiff will prevail because the company is in violation of the county's bylaws. That's possible because the bylaws were reviewed and approved, but if the action violates them, the court might decide accordingly.

Option B: The plaintiff will prevail if she can prove the company's policy is based on gender discrimination. But the argument is that the by laws require only male members. If the company's policy is based on that, the woman would still be denied. So B says she can prove that, but the question is whether the court will find the policy discriminatory.

Option C: The plaintiff will prevail because the company's policy is discriminatory and violates her civil rights. This seems to suggest that discrimination is a civil rights issue, which is a point I need to consider.

Option D: She loses because other facilities are available. But the question is about her membership, so her main issue is membership, not other facilities. Unless the other facilities are available to both genders, but the problem says other facilities are available to women, so if she's trying to use one, she has an option. But this doesn't directly address the membership issue.

Option E: She loses because the company is a private entity and doesn't have equal protection laws. I'm not sure if private companies have equal protection protections, but in general, yes, they do. However, this may not directly address the membership issue.

Option F: The company can set its own membership criteria. That's true, but it doesn't address discrimination.

Option G: The case is about classifications based on sex not violating the equal protection clause. But G is incorrect because the issue here is discrimination, not just classification. The by laws may not cover that; the violation is discrimination, which is a higher bar.

Option H: She will lose unless the company can prove some basis for exclusion. This is a common argument in discrimination cases. The court would look for evidence that the policy is discriminatory, like race, gender, etc. If the company's policy is based on gender discrimination, the court might find it's a violation of equal protection.

Option I: She loses because other facilities are available. Again, this is about other facilities but not the membership issue.

So, the key issue is whether the company's policy is discriminatory.

The by laws require only male members. If the company's policy is based on gender discrimination, then denying membership to women is a violation of equal protection. So, the court would likely look for evidence that the policy is discriminatory.

Looking at the options, option C says the plaintiff will prevail because the company's policy is discriminatory and violates her civil rights. That seems correct because the court would consider whether the policy is based on a violation of equal protection.

Option F is incorrect because it's not about equal protection, but about discrimination. Option H is incorrect because the court doesn't need to show that the classification didn't violate the equal protection clause; the issue is discrimination itself, which is a higher standard.

Option C also mentions the plaintiff's civil rights, which is correct because the issue is about the violation of equal protection, which is a civil rights issue. So, the choice is between C and others.

Other options: A says the company is in violation. That's a possibility, but the court would have to decide whether it's a violation of the by laws, not just the company's actions. But the by laws are a fundamental right, so the court would consider that.

Wait, but the by laws are reviewed and approved, and the lease required the company to follow them. So, if the lease was to build a club open to members only, then the by laws would require that. So, if the membership was denied to women, that's a violation of the bylaws, which are part of the state's equal protection. So, the court would likely find that the company violated the bylaws, hence the claim is valid.

Looking again, option C says the plaintiff will prevail because the company's policy is discriminatory and violates her civil rights. The statement's first part (the company's policy) is correct because the by laws explicitly require only male members. The next part (it's a violation of civil rights) is also correct because discrimination is a civil rights issue.

Wait, but option C is a general statement, not necessarily citing any evidence. Option F says the company can set its own membership criteria. But that's about the company's policy, not whether it's discriminatory.

So, the correct option is C, as the court would find the company's policy is discriminatory, a violation of equal protection.

The case involves discrimination against a woman who was denied membership in a golf club due to a policy requiring only male members. The key issue is whether the company's policy is discriminatory and violates equal protection under the equal protection clause of the U.S. Civil Rights Act.

**Option A** suggests the plaintiff will prevail because the lease violates the county's bylaws. While the lease required the company to follow the bylaws, the court must determine if the lease violated the bylaws rather than the company's actions. This is a possible outcome but not the most accurate analysis.

**Option B** claims the plaintiff will prevail if the company's policy is based on gender discrimination. However, the court would focus on whether the policy itself is discriminatory, not just its basis.

**Option C** states the plaintiff will prevail because the company's policy is discriminatory and violates her civil rights. This is correct because the bylaws explicitly require only male members. If the company's policy is based on gender discrimination, the court would find it a violation of equal protection.

**Option D** claims the plaintiff will lose because other facilities are available to women. However, this does not address the membership issue, which is the primary focus of the case.

**Option E** asserts the plaintiff will lose because the company is a private entity. While private companies generally have equal protection protections, this does not directly address the discrimination issue.

**Option F** suggests the company can set membership criteria. While true, this does not address whether the policy is discriminatory.

**Option G** claims the case is about classifications based on sex, but the issue is discrimination, not just classification. The court would need evidence of discrimination to hold the company liable.

**Option H** states the plaintiff will lose unless the company can prove a basis for exclusion. While this is a common argument in discrimination cases, the court would need evidence of discrimination, not just the lack of a basis.

**Option I** claims the plaintiff will lose because other facilities are available. Again, this is about other facilities, not the membership issue.

The most accurate statement is **Option C**, as it correctly identifies that the company's policy is discriminatory and violates the equal protection clause, which is a civil rights issue.

**ANSWER: C**
