Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so it's about a bacterial mutation and the effect of a chemical. I remember that mutations in bacteria can sometimes be repaired, especially through things like the lac operon or other repair mechanisms. Let me break it down.

The question says that the strain has a base pair substitution making it His^- (which I think is the HisL mutation). The mutation rate for spontaneous reversion is 5e-8. But then they added Chemical X to the medium. They plated on minimal and nutrient rich media. Minimal is a10^-2 dilution, and nutrient rich is a10^-3. They got 50 colonies on minimal and 1000 on nutrient rich.

Wait, so minimal medium is a lower concentration of the bacteria. So, if the mutation rate is 5e-8, which is pretty low, maybe the bacteria can't repair it. But the effect of the chemical is probably causing the mutation to be repaired.

If the chemical X is added, perhaps it's causing the mutation to be repaired, so the cells stay mutated. But why would that matter when plated on different media? Maybe the media affects whether the cells can grow.

Wait, the plates: minimal is a10^-2, which is a more concentrated medium, so fewer bacteria. But they have 50 colonies. If the mutation rate is low, the chance of reversion is low, so maybe the number of colonies is higher because the mutation rate is so low that reversion doesn't happen often. But in the nutrient rich medium, which is a10^-3, they have 1000 colonies. Oh, that's a lot. So, lower concentration (more bacteria) results in more colonies, which would suggest that the mutation isn't repaired, because if it were, you’d expect fewer colonies.

So, for the minimal medium (higher dilution, so fewer bacteria), 50 colonies. But if the mutation wasn't repaired, you’d expect fewer. But if it's repaired, then you'd see more, but wait, the mutation rate is 5e-8, which is very low, so reversion is probably not happening often. But in the minimal, the number is 50, which is less than expected if it's repaired. Wait, but the number is 50, which is 5e-2, which is 0.05. But the number of colonies would depend on both the mutation rate and the number of bacteria. Wait, but the mutation rate is per cell, so perhaps the number of cells increases with dilution. Let me think.

Wait, the original population: if the strain is in a10^-3 dilution, that's a higher concentration. So, more cells, and thus more chances to mutate. But the mutation rate is 5e-8 per cell. So, the expected number of colonies would be (number of cells) * (mutation rate).

Wait, but if the mutation is repaired, you'd have more cells with the mutation, leading to more colonies. But if it isn't repaired, you'd have fewer cells with the mutation, leading to fewer colonies.

In the minimal medium, they have 50 colonies. If the mutation rate is low, the expected number of colonies would be (number of cells) * 5e-8. But the number of cells in a a10^-2 dilution is 100 times more than a a10^-3. So, if I assume N cells in a10^-3, then a10^-2 is 10*N. So, expected colonies would be 10*N *5e-8 = 5e-7 * N. But in reality, they have 50 colonies. So, 5e-7 * N =50 → N=50/(5e-7) → N=1e8? That seems high.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation rate is so low that the number of colonies is proportional to the number of cells. So, if the minimal medium has 10 times more cells than the nutrient rich, then the expected colonies would be 10 times higher. If after adding X, the colonies are 50 and 1000, that's a 10x increase in the minimal. So, 50 is 10 times 5, but 1000 is 10 times 100. So, that suggests that the mutation rate is higher than 5e-8. But the problem says the mutation rate is 5e-8.

Wait, but the question states that the mutation rate is 5e-8. So, if you add a substance (X) that repairs the mutations, perhaps the cells are more resistant, but the number of colonies is lower. But in the minimal, which is a10^-2 dilution, the expected number of colonies for the mutated cells would be N_min * mutation rate. But if the cells have been repaired, the number would be N_min * (mutation rate + repair). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the addition of X allows the cells to recover the mutation, leading to them survive and grow, but the number of colonies would be lower than expected if the mutation weren't repaired.

Wait, but in the minimal medium, the number of colonies is 50. The nutrient rich medium is 1000, which is 10 times higher. So, the minimal has 10 times lower concentration than the nutrient rich, but the number of colonies is 10 times higher. That suggests that the mutation is being repaired because the number of cells increases. If the mutation wasn't repaired, you'd expect fewer colonies, but here it's higher. But the mutation rate is 5e-8, which is very low. So, perhaps the cells are more resistant because the mutation is repaired, but the effect is so low that it's not a major factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. If the mutation rate is low, the chance of reversion is low, so the number of colonies should be lower. But here, the minimal medium has 50 colonies, and the nutrient rich has 1000. That suggests that the mutation isn't being repaired, because if it were, the numbers would be lower in both media. But the mutation rate is 5e-8, which is pretty low. So, perhaps the media doesn't matter because the mutation isn't repaired. Alternatively, maybe the media affects whether the bacteria can grow or not.

Wait, but the question says the cells are in minimal or nutrient rich. So, probably, the media affects bacterial growth. But if the bacteria can't grow on minimal, but can on nutrient rich, that's possible. But the initial problem is about the mutation.

So, adding the chemical X is causing the cells to have the mutation repaired. But the number of colonies in minimal is 50, which is fewer than expected if the mutation wasn't repaired. But wait, the mutation rate is 5e-8, which is so low that the chance of repair is higher than not repairing. Hmm, perhaps the media concentration isn't the issue here. Maybe the fact that the minimal is more concentrated (so more cells) but the number of colonies is lower than expected. Wait, perhaps the media being more concentrated affects the growth rate, but the mutation isn't repaired. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the effect of the chemical on the mutation rate. If the mutation isn't being repaired, then you wouldn't see as many colonies. But the numbers are higher in minimal. So, the number of colonies is higher, which suggests that the mutation is being repaired. But the mutation rate is very low, so the repair should be more frequent. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the media is affecting the growth, but not the mutation rate.

Wait, the experiment is adding Chemical X and then incubating on two media. The idea is to see how the cells respond to the chemical. So, the main focus is on the mutation rate. But perhaps the media affects whether the bacteria can survive, but that's a different question.

Wait, considering the results. On minimal medium (a10^-2 dilution), they have 50 colonies. On nutrient rich (a10^-3), 1000. So, 10 times more in the nutrient rich. If the mutation happened, and the cells were able to survive, then they should produce more colonies. But the number is higher in the nutrient rich.

But the media is more concentrated in the minimal. So, perhaps the minimal is more susceptible. Or perhaps the media's growth rate affects the number of cells. Hmm, but the question is about the effect of the chemical on the mutation rate. So, maybe the media doesn't directly affect the mutation rate but affects the growth.

Wait, another angle: the chemical X is a mutagen. So, it can increase the mutation rate. But in the results, the mutation rate is 5e-8. If the chemical increases the mutation rate, then the colonies would be higher. But in this case, the presence of X isn't causing more mutations. So, perhaps X doesn't increase the mutation rate but repairs it.

Wait, but the presence of X leads to more bacteria on the more dilute media. So, the minimal (more bacteria) has fewer colonies than the nutrient rich. So, perhaps the growth rate is not an issue. So, the media doesn't directly affect the mutation rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the media affects the growth, but not the mutation. So, the main point is that the mutation isn't repaired, leading to more cells with the mutation. But the mutation rate is given as 5e-8, which is very low, so repair would be more frequent.

But the problem is that the number of colonies is higher in the minimal. So, perhaps the media doesn't affect it. So, the numbers are higher, but that doesn't necessarily mean the mutation rate is changed.

Wait, perhaps the media affects bacterial growth, but the mutation rate isn't changed. So, the correct conclusion is that the chemical X repairs the mutation.

Wait, but the numbers might be higher because the minimal has more cells, but in that case, if the mutation isn't repaired, you'd expect fewer colonies. So, the higher number suggests that the mutation is being repaired.

But the mutation rate is 5e-8. So, maybe the media's concentration doesn't matter because the cell population is so high that the mutation rate (which is low) doesn't have a big effect. So, the number of colonies is higher because the mutation is being repaired.

So, the conclusion is that the chemical X repairs the mutation. So, looking at the options, option B says that Chemical X repairs the base pair substitution in the bacteria. That would make sense. So, the answer would be B.

The experiment involves a strain of Salmonellatyphimurium that has a base pair substitution (His^-) at a mutation site, with a mutation rate of 5 × 10^-8. This mutation rate is extremely low, meaning that spontaneous reversion to the His^+ form is unlikely. Chemical X is added to the growth medium, and the bacteria are plated on two media: minimal (a10^-2 dilution) and nutrient rich (a10^-3 dilution). The results show 50 colonies on minimal medium and 1,000 colonies on nutrient rich medium. These numbers suggest that the mutation is being repaired rather than being repaired less frequently or not repaired at all.

The mutation rate is very low (5e-8), so the chance of spontaneous reversion is minimal. The higher number of colonies on the nutrient rich medium compared to the minimal medium indicates that the mutation is being repaired, as more cells survive and grow after the mutation is corrected. However, the very low mutation rate (5e-8) means that the repair process is highly frequent, and the difference in numbers is likely due to the difference in bacterial population concentrations between the two media.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Chemical X has no effect on mutation rate** is incorrect because the mutation rate is explicitly stated as 5 × 10^-8.
- **B: Chemical X repairs the base pair substitution in the bacteria** is correct because the mutation is being repaired, as evidenced by the higher number of colonies on the nutrient rich medium.
- **C: Chemical X only allows growth of His^- cells on minimal medium** is incorrect because the bacteria are able to grow on both media.
- **D: Chemical X inhibits growth on minimal medium only** is incorrect because the bacteria can grow on both media, and the presence of X does not inhibit growth.
- **E: Chemical X is beneficial for the bacteria** is incorrect because the bacteria are able to grow on both media, indicating that X does not confer a beneficial advantage.
- **F: Chemical X promotes growth on nutrient rich medium only** is incorrect because the bacteria can grow on both media, and X does not promote growth on one medium more than the other.
- **G: Chemical X selectively kills non-mutant bacteria** is incorrect because the non-mutant strain can grow on both media, and X does not kill them.
- **H: Chemical X increases mutation rate for other genes but not His** is incorrect because the mutation rate is explicitly stated as 5 × 10^-8, and the experiment focuses on the His^- mutation.
- **I: Chemical X decreases the mutation rate** is incorrect because the mutation rate is very low (5e-8), and the experiment does not provide evidence that X decreases the mutation rate.
- **J: Chemical X is highly mutagenic** is incorrect because the mutation rate is extremely low, and the experiment does not provide evidence of high mutagen activity.

The correct conclusion is that **Chemical X repairs the base pair substitution in the bacteria**, as evidenced by the higher number of colonies on the nutrient rich medium.

**ANSWER: B**
