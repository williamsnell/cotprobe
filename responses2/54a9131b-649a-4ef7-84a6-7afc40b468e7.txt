Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the population of Teotihuacán. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Teotihuacán is the largest pyramid in the world. I think it was built in the 16th century, maybe around 1511. I'm pretty sure it was there for religious reasons, like as an observatory for the Mayans.

Now, the options are A:50k, B:200k, C:500k, D:1M. I'm trying to recall if I've heard the population mentioned before. I think it was a big city, so maybe 1 million? Or was it less?

Wait, I'm not 100% certain. Let me think about historical data. I know that the Mayan cities like Teotihuacan were among the most populous in the world at that time. The Mayan population was massive, but the actual population of the city itself might not be as high. Maybe it's closer to 1 million? Or perhaps it's more than that?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the Mayas were around 100 million people when they were around. But that's way in the future. The city itself, as a city, probably had a much smaller population at its peak. So 1 million seems a bit high for a city, but maybe that's the case. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the numbers.

Alternatively, another thought: the Mayas built cities for religious observatories, so maybe the city itself was a place for worship, and maybe its population was manageable. I'm not certain, but I'm leaning towards 1 million being the answer. Or perhaps it's 500,000? I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the population of the Mayan cities at their peak were around a million, but maybe that's the number of people in the city as a whole. So I'm going with option D:1,000,000 people.
