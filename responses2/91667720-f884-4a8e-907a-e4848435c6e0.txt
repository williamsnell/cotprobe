Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about macrostomia. I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about maxillae and their structures.

Macrostomia refers to the abnormal joining or fusion of two parts of the maxilla. I remember that the maxilla has several arches, and when these arches fail to fuse properly, it creates macrostomia. The question is asking which two things are causing this failure, so I need to think about the different arches and where they can't meet.

The options are A to J, each suggesting different combinations. Let me list out the major maxilla structures. The maxilla has a left and right maxillary arches, a mandibular arch (which is like the lower jaw), and a frontnasal arch. Also, there are hyoid arches, which are often fused to the mandibular arch but can sometimes fail.

So, the possible pairs that cause macrostomia would be combinations of these structures. Let's go through the options:

Option A: left and right maxillary processes. That would mean the two arches failing to fuse. I think that's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the most common cause. Maybe it's more about the hyoid and maxillary combining.

Option B: mandibular and hyoid. So, if the hyoid and mandibular are not merging, that would cause macrostomia. I think hyoid is fused to the mandibular arch, so if they don't join, that's a problem.

Option C: maxillary and frontnasal. That's probably not right because the maxillary and frontnasal are both part of the maxilla. They probably do merge, so failure here would be less likely.

Option D: mandibular and frontnasal. Both are on the same side, so they might merge. But I'm not sure if that's the cause. Maybe in some cases, but probably not the primary.

Option E: frontnasal and hyoid. That sounds familiar. I think when the hyoid and frontnasal arches fail to fuse, that causes macrostomia. I remember this happening in cases of maxillary conditissima, where the front and side of the maxilla don't properly fuse, leading to defects.

Option F: frontnasal and maxillary. Hmm, both are on the same side, so I don't think they can fuse. That's probably not it.

Option G: left and right hyoid arches. That's talking about the hyoid arches, which are fused to the mandibular arch. So if they themselves fail to fuse, that would be macrostomia.

Option H: maxillary and hyoid. So, maxillary and hyoid. That would mean the hyoid is not properly fused to the maxillary processes. That could cause macrostomia, but I'm not sure if it's the most common scenario.

Option I: left and right mandibular. Mandibular processes are separate, so I think they wouldn't fuse. That's not the case here.

Option J: maxillary and mandibular. Those are two separate arches on the same side; they should meet. So they're more likely to fuse, not cause macrostomia.

So, looking back, the possible causes are E and G and H. Let me think again. The hyoid arches (G) are fused to the mandibular arch. If they don't fuse, that's macrostomia. Similarly, if the maxillary and hyoid don't fuse (H), that's another cause. Oh wait, but hyoid is part of the maxilla. So if the hyoid and maxillary are not fused, that's a cause. Also, the frontnasal and hyoid (E) would be a case.

Wait, but I remember that the frontnasal is near the upper jaw. So when the hyoid doesn't fuse with frontnasal, that's another macrostomia. Also, when the maxillary and hyoid don't fuse, that's another possibility. So, the question is asking which two are the failure of fusion causing macrostomia.

So the options are E, G, and H.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. The options are each a pair, and we need to pick the correct one. Let me think about the specific cases.

I think the main cause of macrostomia is the failure of the hyoid and frontnasal arches not merging. I remember that in some cases, especially in cases of maxillary conditissima, the front and side of the maxilla (hyoid and maxillary) don't fuse. So that would be E, front and hyoid.

But another case is when the maxillary and hyoid don't merge, leading to macrostomia. So that would be H.

Wait, but the question is asking which two are the fusion failure. So which pair would cause macrostomia.

So looking at the options, E is frontnasal and hyoid. So if hyoid doesn't fuse with frontnasal, that's one cause. Similarly, if maxillary and hyoid don't fuse, that's another. So the question is which two structures are being fused improperly.

Another thought: the maxillae can have either a hyoid or a mandibular arch, but the hyoid is fused to the mandibular. So if the hyoid doesn't merge with the maxillary processes, that's a failure.

So, looking at the options, E and H are possibilities. But the question is asking which two are failing. So, for example, if the hyoid and frontnasal don't merge, that's one scenario.

Alternatively, the maxillary and hyoid not merging would be another scenario. So the correct options are E and H.

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the answer. The options are letters from A to J, so the correct answer is a single letter. So, I need to choose between E and H.

Wait, I'm not certain. Let me think about the structure again. The maxilla has a hyoid arch and a mandibular arch. The hyoid is fused to the mandibular. So, if they don't fuse, that's a macrostomia. So, options E and H are possible.

But what's the correct answer? I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall some textbook notes.

In my notes, I remember that the most common cause is when the hyoid and frontnasal arches don't fuse. That's called maxillae conditissima. So that would be option E: frontnasal and hyoid.

Wait, but another possibility is that the maxillary and hyoid don't fuse, leading to a macrostomia. So the correct answer might be E or H.

Alternatively, I think that the maxilla's front and side (hyoid and maxillary) don't fuse, which would be E. Or the maxilla's maxillae and hyoid don't fuse, which is H.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is E or H.

Wait, but the question is which two are causing the failure. So, which pair would be the two structures that can't fuse.

Wait, another thought: the maxilla has a mandibular arch and a hyoid arch. The hyoid is fused to the mandibular. So if the hyoid doesn't fuse with the mandibular, that's a cause. So that's option G. But if the hyoid doesn't fuse with the maxillary processes, that's option H.

So, the question is asking which two are causing the failure. So, the correct answer is either E or H. But which of these is more likely to cause macrostomia.

Wait, I think the hyoid and maxillary don't fuse, leading to macrostomia. That would be H. Or do the hyoid and frontnasal not fuse, leading to E.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the diagrams. The maxilla has a hyoid arch that's fused to the upper jaw (mandibular). The hyoid is attached to the maxilla's upper and lower sides. When the hyoid and maxillary don't fuse, that's a problem.

So, the correct answer would be either H or E.

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the answer. The options are letters A-J, each being a possible answer. So I need to pick the correct letter.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the correct answer is E. Because the hyoid and frontnasal don't fuse, causing macrostomia. Or H.

Alternatively, another approach: the correct answer is E because when the hyoid and frontnasal don't fuse, it's called maxillae conditissima. So that's option E.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about another angle. The maxillae can have either a hyoid or a mandibular arch. The hyoid is fused to the mandibular arch. So, if the hyoid doesn't fuse with the mandibular, that's a problem. So the pair would be hyoid and mandibular.

Looking at the options, that would be option G: left and right hyoid arches. No, wait, option G is left and right hyoid. Wait, no, the hyoid is a single arch. So I think option G is incorrect because it's describing the hyoid itself, not the combination with the mandibular arch.

Wait, looking back at the options:

G: left and right hyoid arches. That's not correct because the hyoid is a single arch, not two separate ones. So option G is incorrect.

Option H: maxillary and hyoid. So if the hyoid doesn't fuse with the maxillary processes, that's another scenario.

Wait, but the hyoid is fused to the mandibular. So if it's fused to a different part, like the maxilla's maxillae, that's a problem.

So the correct answer is the pair where the hyoid doesn't fuse with the maxilla. That would be either E or H.

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the answer. So the answer must be a single letter. So, if the correct option is E, then the letter would be E. Or if it's H, it's H.

Wait, I'm really getting stuck here. Let me think of the most common case. I remember that when the hyoid doesn't fuse with the frontnasal arch, that's a cause of macrostomia. So that would be option E.

So the correct answer is E, so the letter is E.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options based on the structure of the maxilla and the causes of macrostomia. Macrolaminia occurs when the hyoid and frontnasal arches fail to fuse, leading to abnormal joint formation. This is a common cause of macrostomia. Additionally, the maxilla can have either a hyoid or mandibular arch, and if the hyoid doesn't fuse with the maxillary processes, that also causes macrostomia. Among the options, the correct pair is the hyoid and frontnasal arches failing to fuse, which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: E
