Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Minoans and their behavior during tough times. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, the question is asking about what the Minoans did during periods of great difficulty and stress. The options are various actions like doing art, fasting, building structures, etc. 

I remember that the Minoans were an ancient Greek people, part of the Mycenaean people. They were known for their architectural skills, like their buildings like the Parthenon. But I'm trying to recall their social behaviors.

Option A: Stopped all forms of art and music. I don't think that's right. I think they were very into arts and were involved in various musical traditions. Plus, during tough times, people probably didn't stop doing things; they might have continued to do so.

Option B: Fasted for long periods. Fasting was a common behavior in ancient times, especially in the southern regions like Crete. The Minoans lived in the south, so they probably fasted. But I'm not sure if fasting helped them cope with stress during times of difficulty. It might have been a part of their diet, not necessarily the immediate response to stress.

Option C: Built monumental structures. The Minoans were famous for their architecture, so building structures makes sense as an action they might have taken during stressful times. Maybe they needed more space or for religious purposes, so they built up.

Option D: Xerox adults and occasionally children. I don't recall the Minoans being particularly religious in that way. They were known for their Masks, not necessarily adult or child sacrifice. So this might not be correct.

Option E: Burnt their own houses to the ground. This sounds like a religious act, like the Minoans burned offerings. But burning their own houses would be part of their rituals, but I'm not sure if that was a common or specific action during stress. It might have been more of a general practice.

Option F: Abstained from sexual relations. That's more of a hygiene or religious practice. I don't think the Minoans were known for abstinence from sexual relations, especially during tough times.

Option G: Enacted strict laws and punishments. Again, this seems more like a religious or administrative action rather than a behavior response to stress. They were known for their strict laws, but the question is about what they did during stress, not how they enforced them.

Option H: Buried their possessions. That's a historical detail about ancient Greek citizens, not their social behavior during stress. They had burial rituals, but this doesn't directly answer the question about stress relief.

Option I: Performed complex dance rituals. I know dance rituals were a part of their society, but I'm not sure if they were specifically doing complex ones during tough times. It's more about their cultural practices than a coping method.

Option J: Migrated to different regions. That doesn't seem right. The Minoans were a group, not individuals, and they were part of the Mycenaean people, living in the Peloponnesian League. They didn't migrate.

So, putting it together, the Minoans probably engaged in building monumental structures (Option C) during stressful times. This would allow them to cope with the stress by having large spaces for their architectural needs. Fasting (Option B) might have been part of their diet, but it's not the specific action they took. Their architectural achievements would have been more directly tied to their need for space and cultural presence during tough periods.

The Minoans, as a group, engaged in various activities during periods of stress. However, the most fitting choice is to build monumental structures (Option C). This reflects their architectural prowess, which likely allowed them to cope with stress by providing space and cultural presence. 

Answer: C
