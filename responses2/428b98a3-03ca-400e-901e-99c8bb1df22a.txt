Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about theories supporting the belief that aggression is necessary. Let's see. The question is asking which two theories support the idea that aggression is a necessary trait. The options are A to G, each with different theories.

First, I should recall what each of these theories might relate to. I remember that aggression can be a biological drive. The "Game Theory" is often linked to the idea that animals engage in conflict to survive, which might mean aggression is a survival instinct. Then there's "Catharsis," which I think is a concept from religious beliefs, often about purification and release from suffering, but I'm not sure if that's a scientific theory. Or maybe it's more about religious practices and not a scientific one.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one. 

Option A: "Aggressive Energy" and "Natural Born Killer" theory. I'm not sure about the "Natural Born Killer" theory. It sounds more like a psychological theory, maybe about how certain people are born to have strong vulnerabilities. "Aggressive Energy" might be a theory where aggressive behavior is a fundamental aspect of human nature. So this could be a possibility.

Option B: "Game" theory and "Cognitive Neoassociation." Game theory is about survival, so that's probably a theory that supports aggression. Cognitive Neoassociation isn't familiar to me, but maybe it's a term I haven't heard before. Not sure about this pair.

Option C: "Psychoanalytic" and "Drive." The "Drive" theories, like the drive for security, might support the idea of aggression. But "Psychoanalytic" isn't exactly a theory that specifically supports aggression. It's more about understanding the unconscious and how people develop behaviors.

Option D: "Dominance" theory and "Behaviorist." Dominance theory could be about the necessity of power and control. Behaviorist might talk about learning through conditioning. These both could support the idea that aggression is needed for dominance and survival, but I'm not sure if these are widely recognized.

Option E: "Evolution" and "Conflict." The "Evolution" theory, especially the "Game Theory" part, is about survival. Evolutionary theory often explains why certain behaviors are selected for. Conflict theory in psychology suggests that people are motivated by competition, which could lead to aggression. So this pair seems plausible.

Option F: "Social Learning" and "Biological." Social Learning Theory is about how behaviors are learned through observation and imitation. "Biological" isn't a theory I'm familiar with. Maybe this pair is about how certain behaviors are passed down through generations, but I don't think it's a well-known theory about aggression.

Option G: "Survival of the fittest" and "Catharsis." Survival theory is about survival instincts, which could relate to aggression. Catharsis is a religious concept about purification, but not sure if it's a scientific theory. So this might not be the answer.

Wait, I need to think again. The question is about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary. So I'm looking for theories that suggest that aggression is a necessary trait for survival or well-being.

Option A: "Aggressive Energy" theory (maybe) and "Natural Born Killer" theory. Wait, "Natural Born Killer" is more about genetics, not necessarily about the necessity of aggression. Or is it a theory that states that people are born with certain vulnerabilities that would lead to aggression? Not sure. Alternatively, "Aggressive Energy" might refer to the idea that aggression is a natural part of human behavior, perhaps due to the drive to protect and survive.

Option D: Dominance theory and Behaviorist. Dominance theory could imply that aggression is needed for power and survival. Behaviorist might explain why people are aggressive as a way to maximize their advantage, but I'm not certain about which theories are widely considered.

Alternatively, Option E: Evolution (as in the Game Theory) and Conflict. Evolutionary theory would explain why aggression is seen as advantageous, and Conflict Theory in psychology explains how competition leads to aggression. These two could support the idea that aggression is necessary.

Wait, the question is which options are correct. So each option has two theories.

Looking for the correct pair. I think the "Game Theory" and "Evolution" (as in "Game Theory") are both about survival, so that's a good sign. So Option E: Evolution (Game Theory) and Conflict.

Another possibility is Option D: Dominance theory (which suggests that aggression is necessary) and Behaviorist (which explains the biological drive leading to aggression). But I'm not sure if these are the right theories.

Wait, the "Game Theory" refers to the idea that survival is the goal, so it's possible that aggression is a necessary trait for survival. So the "Game Theory" might be one of the theories supporting it.

Alternatively, the "Evolution" theory posits that aggression is a survival drive, which would fit.

Looking at the options, Option E says "Evolution" and "Conflict." Both of these are related to survival and competition, so they support the belief that aggression is necessary.

The correct answer is E: "Evolution" theory and "Conflict" theory. These theories support the belief that aggression is necessary because "Evolution" explains survival instincts, while "Conflict" theory attributes motivation to competition, both of which are linked to the necessity of aggressive behavior for well-being.

Answer: E
