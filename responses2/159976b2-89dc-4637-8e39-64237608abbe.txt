Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a woman walking on a ship. Let's see, I need to find her speed relative to the water, right? Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

The problem says the woman walks due west on the ship's deck at 3 mph. And the ship is moving north at 22 mph. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, you have to consider both the woman's movement and the ship's movement. Oh wait, right! It's a vector addition problem because both her movement and the ship's movement are in different directions.

So, let me visualize this. The ship is moving north, which is the positive y-direction on a coordinate plane, and the woman is walking west, which is the negative x-direction. So, the ship's velocity is 22 mph north, and the woman's velocity relative to the ship is 3 mph west.

Wait, but the question is about her speed relative to the water, not the ship. So I think I need to combine both her movement and the ship's movement. Since they are perpendicular, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the resultant speed.

Let me jot this down. The ship's velocity is 22 mph north, and the woman's velocity relative to the ship is 3 mph west. So, in vector terms, the ship's velocity is (0, 22) mph, and her velocity is (-3, 0) mph relative to the ship. Wait, no, maybe I should think of the ship's velocity as (0, 22) relative to the water, and the woman's velocity as (-3, 0) relative to the ship. So, the woman's velocity relative to the water is the sum of these two vectors.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as her velocity relative to the ship plus the ship's velocity relative to the water. Because if the ship is moving north at 22 mph, and she's moving west at 3 mph relative to the ship, then from the water's perspective, her total velocity is the ship's velocity plus her velocity relative to the ship.

So, ship's velocity relative to water (V_ship) is (0, 22) mph. Woman's velocity relative to ship (V_woman_ship) is (-3, 0) mph, because west is negative x and north is positive y. So, V_woman is V_ship + V_woman_ship.

So adding those vectors: V_woman = (0 + (-3)) in x, and (22 + 0) in y. So V_woman is (-3, 22) mph.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the ship's velocity is in the north direction, and her movement is west relative to the ship. So yes, her velocity relative to water is the sum of the two vectors.

Okay, so the resultant velocity is given by the vector (-3, 22). Now, to find the speed, which is the magnitude of this vector. So speed = sqrt( (-3)^2 + (22)^2 ).

Let me calculate that: (-3)^2 is 9, 22 squared is 484. So 9 + 484 is 493. So the square root of 493 is the speed. Looking at the options, option C is sqrt(475), H is sqrt(529), G is sqrt(493), etc. So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, let me double-check. The calculation is √(3² + 22²) = √(9 + 484) = √493. Yep, that's right. So the answer is G.

To determine the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water, we analyze the vectors of her motion. The ship is moving north at 22 mph, and the woman walks west relative to the ship at 3 mph. These velocities are perpendicular, so the resultant velocity is the vector sum of the two.

1. The ship's velocity relative to the water is \( (0, 22) \) mph.
2. The woman's velocity relative to the ship is \( (-3, 0) \) mph (westward).
3. Adding these vectors gives the woman's velocity relative to the water as \( (-3, 22) \) mph.
4. The magnitude of this velocity is the speed:  
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (22)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 484} = \sqrt{493} \, \text{mph}.
   \]

The correct answer is **G: \(\sqrt{493} \, \text{mi}/\text{h}\)**.

Answer: G
