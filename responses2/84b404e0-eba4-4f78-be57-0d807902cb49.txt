Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the net price of a bed that's listed at $300. The discounts are 30% first and then 20%. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my discounts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when there are successive discounts, you apply each discount one after another, not just add them up. So, the first discount is 30%, and then on the new price, a 20% discount is applied.

Let me break it down. The original price is $300. The first discount is 30%, so I need to calculate what 30% of 300 is and subtract that from the original price.

30% of 300 is calculated by multiplying 300 by 0.30. Let me do that: 300 * 0.30 = 90. So, the first discount brings the price down by $90. Subtracting that from 300 gives me 300 - 90 = $210. So after the first discount, the price is $210.

Now, the second discount is 20% off this new price of $210. I'll calculate 20% of 210. That's 210 * 0.20. Let me compute that: 210 * 0.20 = $42. So, the second discount is $42. Subtracting that from $210 gives 210 - 42 = $168.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Alternatively, I could calculate the overall discount by adding the percentages and then applying them all at once. 30% plus 20% is 50%, so the total discount is 50% of $300, which is $150. So the net price would be 300 - 150 = $150. Hmm, but that's conflicting with my previous result.

Oh wait, that's a mistake. Because when applying successive discounts, you can't just add the percentages. You have to apply each discount one at a time. So the correct way is to first apply the 30% discount, then the 20% on the resulting price. So my first calculation is correct, leading to $168. The alternative approach of adding the discounts and subtracting from the original price is incorrect because it doesn't account for the order of applying the discounts.

Wait another thing, maybe I should double-check the calculation. So 30% off $300: 300 * 0.3 is 90, so 300 -90 = 210. Then 20% off 210: 210 * 0.2 is 42, so 210-42=168. So the net price is $168, which is option G.

Looking at the options, G is $168, so that must be the answer. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. The discounts are applied first at 30%, then at 20%. So, yes, the correct net price is $168.

The net price is calculated by applying the discounts in sequence. First, a 30% discount on $300 reduces it to $210. Then, a 20% discount on $210 reduces it to $168. Thus, the correct answer is $168.

Answer: G
