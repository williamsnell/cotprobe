Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and spectroscopy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the 1H spectrum of a mixture contains lines with relative intensities α and 3α, and I need to find the ratio of [DMSO] to [AN]. The options are given, so I'll need to figure out the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in such mixtures, the splitting of signals depends on the number of neighboring protons. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, I think, and it's usually used as a solvent but doesn't participate much in the proton exchange. Wait, but wait—DMSO has multiple equivalent protons. Oh right, DMSO is (SO3)2CH2. So each molecule has two methyl groups, and each CH2 is attached to the sulfur. Wait, no, maybe each CH2 is two CH3 groups attached to the sulfur. So each molecule contributes two protons that are split into a quartet because of coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, but wait again. So DMSO is a dipolar aprotic solvent, and in solution, it's in a solvent that doesn't exchange protons with the sample. So in the proton NMR, the exchange doesn't cause splitting because the solvent can't exchange protons. So the splitting comes from the coupling between the solvent protons and the sample, but in this case, the solvent is the organic solvent, so the exchange is not happening, which means the coupling between the solvent and the sample is not observed. Wait, no, wait—wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because in a typical proton exchange, the solvent (like DMSO) and the sample (like DMSO solution) exchange protons, so you don't see splitting from solvent to sample. So in the NMR spectrum, the splitting is due to coupling between the sample protons (like from the organic solvent) and other sample protons. Wait, but wait, DMSO is a high-boiling point solvent and it's a good solvent for exchanging protons. So in the 1H NMR, the splitting would come from the neighboring protons in the same sample, not the solvent.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Wait, wait. Let's think about the splitting in DMSO. The protons in DMSO (which are the CH3 groups) are split because each CH3 is connected to two adjacent CH3 groups. So each proton in the CH3 is split by two neighboring protons. So each CH3 group in DMSO would give a quartet (n+1 = 3+1=4). But wait, maybe wait: in the case of DMSO, each CH3 group is split by the neighboring CH3 groups. Since each CH3 is connected to two other CH3 groups, each proton in a CH3 is split by two neighboring protons. So the splitting would be a quartet. So each DMSO molecule contributes two equivalent protons (the two CH3 groups) each as a quartet. But wait, each CH3 is a singlet because the protons are equivalent and have no neighboring protons within the same group. So two CH3 groups in DMSO would each have a quartet. But since the two CH3 groups are equivalent, the overall effect is a quartet for the two protons, but wait, the coupling is between the two sets of protons, so the overall effect is a quartet for the signal.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the splitting. Let me think again. Each CH3 group in DMSO has protons that are split by the adjacent CH3 groups. So each proton in a CH3 is coupled with two other protons (since each CH3 has three protons, but each is coupled to the others). So each proton in a CH3 is split by two neighboring protons, leading to a quartet. So each CH3 group would split into a quartet. But since the two CH3 groups in DMSO are equivalent, the overall effect is a quartet for the two protons in each CH3. So each CH3 in DMSO contributes a quartet, but since both CH3 groups are equivalent, the signal for the DMSO in the NMR would be a quartet, but wait, no—if the two CH3 groups are equivalent, their signals are the same. So for each CH3, you have a quartet (n=2 → quartet), but since both CH3 groups are identical, the two protons (each with a quartet) would appear as a quartet, but each group is equivalent. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting in DMSO is due to the protons in the DMSO itself. Wait, no. Because in the 1H NMR, the protons we're looking at are the ones that are split into the given lines. The question states that the spectrum has lines with intensities α and 3α. So the lines are due to two different sets of protons. 

Wait, the question says the mixture is DMSO and AN. So the mixture is a solution of DMSO and AN (acetonitrile). The mixture has two different protons environments: the ones from DMSO and the ones from AN. So when you mix DMSO and AN, their protons split into separate lines in the spectrum.

Wait, but wait. An alternative approach: the problem might involve the exchange of protons between DMSO and AN. Because AN is a nonequivalent solvent, perhaps. So when you mix DMSO (where the solvent is more polar and protons are in a specific environment) and AN (a non-polar solvent with more free protons), the exchange of protons between the two solvents occurs. So the solvent molecules (AN) in DMSO exchange protons with the sample, and vice versa.

Wait, but wait. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, so it can exchange protons with the organic sample. So the exchange occurs between the solvent (AN) and the organic solvent (the sample). So the exchange is between AN and the organic sample. So the exchange occurs between the two solvents.

Wait, but in this case, the sample is a mixture of DMSO and AN. So the exchange would be between AN and the organic sample. So the solvent molecules (AN) would exchange protons with the organic sample. So in the 1H NMR, the exchange would lead to splitting into two sets of lines.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. The problem states that the relative intensities are alpha and 3 alpha. So the two peaks in the spectrum have intensities in a 1:3 ratio. Wait, no, the intensities are in the ratio alpha : 3 alpha, so the ratio is 1:3. But no, wait, the first line is alpha, then the second is 3 alpha. So the question says that the lines have relative intensities α and 3α, respectively.

Wait, but perhaps the two types of protons in the mixture are split into two different peaks. So the problem is about the exchange between DMSO and AN. In this case, the protons in DMSO would be exchanged with those in AN, leading to splitting.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up this part. Let's think about the case of exchanging between two solvents. For example, if you have a solution where a proton is present in two different solvents, say, DMSO and AN. When DMSO and AN exchange protons, the signals for the protons in each solvent are split into two peaks in the NMR.

In such a case, the splitting would depend on the exchange rates between the two solvents. The exchange rate (K) is given by the exchange constant, which depends on the solvents. The exchange rate from solvent A to solvent B is K_AB, and from B to A it's K_BA. The exchange constants are related by K_AB = K_BA / (T), where T is the temperature (but perhaps that's not needed here).

In the case of exchanging between two solvents, the two signals (from each solvent) split into each other. The splitting would be determined by the exchange rates. The more exchange occurs from solvent A to solvent B, the more the signal from A is split into two peaks by the solvent B. Similarly, the solvent B's signal is split into two peaks by solvent A.

Wait, but in this problem, the mixture is a solution of DMSO and AN. So the solvent molecules in DMSO will exchange with the organic sample, and the solvent molecules in AN will exchange with the sample.

Wait, but the solvent is AN (acetonitrile) and DMSO. So when DMSO and AN exchange, the exchange rate from DMSO to AN would be K_DMSO-AN, and from AN to DMSO, K_AN-DMSO. The exchange rates affect the splitting of the signals.

So if a proton is present in both DMSO and AN, then the exchange between the two solvents would cause each signal to be split into two peaks. The splitting is based on the exchange rates between the solvents.

In DMSO, the solvent molecules are exchanging with the sample. So a proton in DMSO would be exchanged with protons in AN. Similarly, a proton in AN would be exchanged with DMSO.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think about the problem again. The mixture contains DMSO and AN. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks with intensities α and 3α. We need to find the ratio of their concentrations.

Wait, perhaps each solvent contributes a peak. For example, suppose the NMR spectrum shows two peaks: one from the exchange between DMSO and AN, and another from the same exchange but in the reverse direction. So each solvent has a certain exchange rate, and the splitting depends on those rates.

But perhaps it's easier to model this using the exchange rates. The exchange rates (K) between the two solvents will determine the splitting. Let me denote K as the exchange rate from solvent A to solvent B.

The splitting of a signal depends on the exchange between the two solvents. For example, if a proton is present in both solvents, the signal will split into two peaks. The intensities of these peaks depend on the exchange rates.

Wait, I think I remember that when a proton is present in two solvents, the splitting can be modeled by K_AB and K_BA. The intensity ratio would be (K_BA + K_AB)^2 : (K_AB)^2 : (K_BA)^2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when you have two exchange rates, the two peaks have intensities proportional to (K_BA + K_AB)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the two exchange rates. Let's say the exchange rate from DMSO to AN is K1, and from AN to DMSO is K2. Then, the splitting of the signals in DMSO and AN would depend on these rates.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck on the specifics. Let me think about how the splitting in each solvent would look. In DMSO, the protons would split into a quartet if the exchange rate is K1. In AN, the protons would split into a quartet as well, perhaps, depending on the exchange rate K2.

Wait, but the problem says that the two peaks in the spectrum have relative intensities of α and 3α. The question is to find the ratio of the concentrations of DMSO to AN.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the solvent molecules in DMSO and AN exchange with each other. So the exchange rate from DMSO to AN would be K1, and from AN to DMSO K2. Since K1 and K2 might be inversely related (K1 = K2 / T), but perhaps that's not relevant here.

In the case of exchanging protons between the two solvents, the splitting of the signals would be determined by the exchange rates. So the signal from DMSO would be split into two peaks, and similarly, the signal from AN would be split into two peaks.

Wait, but maybe each solvent contributes to the splitting of the other. So the splitting of DMSO's signal into two peaks is due to the exchange between DMSO and AN. Similarly, the splitting of AN's signal into two peaks is due to the exchange between AN and DMSO.

Wait, perhaps the splitting of the DMSO signal into two peaks is proportional to the exchange rate from DMSO to AN. So the two peaks from DMSO would have intensities proportional to (K1 + K2)² and (K1 K2)², but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the exchange rates. Let me denote the exchange rate from DMSO to AN as K1, and from AN to DMSO as K2. The total exchange rate between A and B is K1 + K2.

The splitting of a signal into two peaks occurs when a proton is present in both solvents. The intensities of these peaks depend on the exchange rates. 

The splitting can be modeled such that the two peaks from the exchange will have intensities proportional to the exchange rates. Wait, but maybe the more exchange occurs from A to B, the more the signal from A is split into two peaks, and vice versa.

Wait, from what I remember, when two solvents exchange protons, the splitting is based on the exchange rates. The more exchange occurs from solvent A to solvent B, the more the signal from A is split into two peaks. So, the signal from the solvent A (say, DMSO) will split into two peaks, and the signal from solvent B (AN) will split into two peaks as well.

But perhaps the relative intensities of the two peaks are determined by the exchange rates. For example, if the exchange rate from DMSO to AN is K1, and the exchange rate from AN to DMSO is K2, then the intensity ratio would be (K2 + K1)^2 : (K1)^2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks in the spectrum are due to the exchange between the two solvents. Let me think of the two protons (one from DMSO and one from AN) being exchanged. Each proton from DMSO is exchanged with a proton from AN, and vice versa.

Wait, perhaps each proton in DMSO and each in AN will exchange, so the total exchange is K1 + K2. The splitting of the signals from each solvent into two peaks is due to this exchange. The relative intensities of the two peaks depend on the exchange rates.

In the case of DMSO, the splitting into two peaks would have a certain intensity ratio. Similarly, for AN. But in this problem, the spectrum shows two lines with intensities α and 3α, which suggests a ratio of 1:3.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the lines have relative intensities α and 3α. So for example, the first line is α, the second is 3α. So the ratio of the two lines is 1:3.

But in the case where the exchange occurs between two solvents, the splitting of the signals could be such that the two peaks have intensities proportional to the square of the exchange rates.

Wait, perhaps the initial idea is that the splitting is based on the exchange between the two solvents. Let's denote K as the exchange rate from solvent A to solvent B. The splitting of the signal in solvent A into two peaks is (K + 1)^2 : 1^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the splitting in each solvent. Let's consider that the two solvents are in a mixture, and the protons in each solvent exchange with each other.

Assume that the exchange rate from DMSO to AN is K1, and from AN to DMSO is K2. The total exchange rate between the two is K1 + K2.

The splitting of a signal into two peaks is proportional to the exchange rates. So, the intensity of each peak would be proportional to (K1) and (K2). Hmm, perhaps that's right.

If the two peaks are due to the exchange between the two solvents, then the relative intensities of the two peaks would be K1 : K2.

In this problem, the relative intensities are given as α : 3α, so the ratio is 1:3.

So K1 : K2 = 1 : 3.

But what's K1 and K2 in terms of the solvents? K1 is the exchange rate from DMSO to AN, K2 from AN to DMSO.

Wait, but the exchange rates are related by K1 = K2 / (T), where T is the temperature. But in this problem, since it's not given, we can assume that K1 and K2 are in a 1:3 ratio.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the ratio of the two concentrations is to be found. So, perhaps the exchange rates K1 and K2 are proportional to the concentrations of the solvents. Because the exchange rate is higher when the concentration is higher, as more solvent molecules can exchange protons.

Wait, but wait. The exchange rate K is proportional to the concentration of the solvent that is acting as the source. So, for example, K1 (exchange from DMSO to AN) is proportional to the concentration of DMSO. Similarly, K2 (exchange from AN to DMSO) is proportional to the concentration of AN.

Let me denote [DMSO] as C1 and [AN] as C2. Then, K1 = k * C1 and K2 = k * C2, where k is a proportionality constant.

The ratio of K1 to K2 is (k C1) / (k C2) )= C1/C2.

But from earlier, K1 : K2 = 1 : 3. So C1/C2 = 1/3 → C1 = (1/3) C2 → [DMSO]/[AN] = 1/3.

But wait, the question is the ratio of [DMSO] to [AN], so [DMSO]/[AN] = 1/3. But the options don't include 1/3 as a correct option. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 3:2

B: 1:6

C:1:9

D:1:1

E:2:3

F:1:3

G:3:1

H:2:1

I:6:1

J:1:2

Hmm, F is 1:3. So that's [DMSO] : [AN] = 1 : 3. But wait, earlier I thought that K1 : K2 = 1:3 → C1 : C2 = 1 : 3 → [DMSO]/[AN] = 1/3. So this would correspond to F:1:3.

But wait, the question states that the ratio of the two intensities is α and 3α. So the ratio of their peak intensities is 1:3. The question is to find [DMSO]/[AN].

But according to the exchange rates, the ratio of the exchange rates is 1:3, which leads to [DMSO]/[AN] =1/(3) → 1:3.

Wait, but wait. No, I think I made a mistake. Because if the ratio of K1 to K2 is 1:3, then the ratio of the concentrations [DMSO]/[AN] is also 1:3. Because K1 is proportional to C1, and K2 is proportional to C2. So (K1/K2) = (C1/C2) → 1/3 = C1/C2 → [DMSO]/[AN] = 1/3.

Which in the options is F:1:3.

But wait, the problem says that the two lines in the spectrum have relative intensities α and 3α. So the ratio of the intensities is 1:3. So in the earlier reasoning, the exchange rates are in 1:3 ratio, leading to the concentrations being in the same ratio. So the correct answer would be F:1:3.

But wait, the problem is about the exchange between solvents, which in turn leads to splitting of the NMR signals. So the correct answer is F:1:3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the exchange rates. Let me think again. Let me model the splitting.

When a proton is present in both solvents, the exchange between them splits the signal into two peaks. The ratio of the intensities of these peaks depends on the exchange rates.

Assume that the exchange rate from solvent A to solvent B is K₁, and from B to A is K₂. The total exchange rate is K = K₁ + K₂.

The splitting of the signal in solvent A into two peaks would be in the ratio of K₂ : K₁.

Wait, no. Because the exchange rate K1 is the rate at which solvent A exchanges protons with solvent B. So, the rate from A to B is K₁, and from B to A is K₂.

The intensity of the peak in solvent A would be proportional to the sum of the exchange rates from B to A and A to B divided by the exchange rate from A to B.

Wait, perhaps the two peaks in the NMR from solvent A would have intensities proportional to (K₂ + K₁)^2 and (K₁ K₂)^2. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the splitting is based on the exchange rates. The more exchange occurs from solvent A to solvent B, the more the signal from A is split into two peaks, and vice versa.

The relative intensities of the two peaks would then be proportional to the exchange rates.

So if the exchange rate from A to B is K₁, and from B to A is K₂, then the two peaks from A would have intensities proportional to (K₂ + K₁)^2 and (K₁ K₂)^2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks in the spectrum are due to the exchange between the two solvents. The relative intensities of these peaks are determined by the exchange rates.

If the exchange rate from solvent A to solvent B is K₁, and from solvent B to solvent A is K₂, then the splitting would be such that the two peaks from solvent A would have intensities proportional to (K₂ + K₁)^2 and (K₁ K₂)^2. But I'm not certain about this.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the splitting as two peaks, where the intensities are proportional to the squares of the exchange rates.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should refer to the answer options. The correct answer is F:1:3.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If the exchange rates are in a 1:3 ratio, then the concentrations are in the same ratio, leading to the ratio of the intensities being 1:3. So that would fit.

But the question is to find the ratio of the concentrations of the solvents. The answer is F:1:3.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F:1:3.

But wait, the options are F:1:3, which is [DMSO]/[AN] =1/3.

So I think the correct answer is F:1:3.

But wait, according to the previous reasoning, the exchange rates are in the ratio of 1:3, leading to [DMSO]/[AN]=1/3, so the answer is F:1:3.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the two lines have relative intensities α and 3α. So the ratio is 1:3. That matches the F option. So the correct answer is F:1:3.

But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that the exchange rates would lead to a ratio of 1:3, which would mean the concentrations are in the same ratio. So [DMSO]/[AN]=1/3, and the answer is F:1:3.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial reasoning was that the ratio of the exchange rates is 1:3, which is due to the concentrations. Because the exchange rates are proportional to the concentration of the solvent.

Wait, so if K1 : K2 = 1 : 3, then [DMSO]/[AN]=1/3. So the correct answer is F:1:3.

Yes, I think that's correct.

So the answer is F:1:3.
</think>

The problem involves a mixture of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and acetonitrile (acetonitrile), and the goal is to determine the ratio of their concentrations based on the relative intensities of the two absorption lines in the 1H NMR spectrum. The relative intensities of the two lines are given as α and 3α, which simplifies to a ratio of 1:3.

The splitting of the NMR signals into two peaks is due to the exchange of protons between the two solvents. The exchange rate from DMSO to acetonitrile (K1) is proportional to the concentration of DMSO ([DMSO]), and the exchange rate from acetonitrile to DMSO (K2) is proportional to the concentration of acetonitrile ([AN]). Thus, the ratio of the exchange rates is directly proportional to the ratio of the concentrations of the solvents.

Given that the relative intensities of the two peaks are 1:3, the exchange rates from DMSO to acetonitrile and from acetonitrile to DMSO are in the ratio of 1:3. This implies that the concentrations of DMSO and acetonitrile are also in the same ratio of 1:3.

Therefore, the ratio of [DMSO]:[AN] is 1:3.

ANSWER: F:1:3
