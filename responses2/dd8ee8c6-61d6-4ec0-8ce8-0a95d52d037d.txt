Okay, so I have this question here about the value of an investment that pays $10 per year forever, and the discount rate is 5%. Hmm, I think I remember something about this from my finance class. Let me try to work through it.

Wait, right, this must be a perpetuity problem. Perpetuity is a type of investment that pays a fixed amount each period forever. The formula for calculating its present value is something like the annual payment divided by the discount rate. Oh yeah, I think it's PV = C / r, where C is the annual cash flow and r is the discount rate.

So in this case, the cash flow C is $10 a year, and the discount rate r is 5% or 0.05 as a decimal. Plugging those into the formula, PV = 10 / 0.05. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 0.05 is 200. So the present value should be $200.

Looking at the options, option E is $200. That must be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I mix up formulas, like using an annuity formula instead of a perpetuity.

Wait, no, an annuity is a series of fixed payments, but when it's forever, it's a perpetuity. So yeah, the perpetuity formula should apply here. Also, I remember that the present value of a perpetuity grows over time because each payment is discounted by a factor that decreases each year. But since the payments are infinite, the present value converges to a finite number, which is exactly what the perpetuity formula gives us.

So applying the formula correctly, 10 divided by 0.05 is 200. So the answer is E. Let me double-check the options: E is $200. Yep, that's the correct one.

The correct answer is E, $200.
