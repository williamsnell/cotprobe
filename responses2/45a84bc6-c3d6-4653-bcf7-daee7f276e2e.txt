Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about the inheritance pattern of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Hmm, I remember that G6PD is an enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, which is crucial for cellular energy production. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think.

I recall that G6PD deficiency is related to a genetic defect, not an environmental factor. So it's not like a disease caused by a mutation in a cell's own genes. So the options about mitochondrial inheritance (D) and X-linked (E, F) might be ruled out because mitochondrial diseases are more about the mitochondria, and X-linked are usually from the father. G6PD is a glycolysis enzyme, so it's more likely an autosomal recessive condition.

Autosomal recessive means that the gene is located on an autosomal chromosome (like the X or Y) and the recessive allele is needed for normal function. So if someone has two copies of the defective allele, they can't function properly. So for example, if someone has both alleles, they can't make G6PD, leading to various complications.

Looking at the options, option H is autosomal recessive. Option E and F are about X-linked, which is male's only genes. G6PD is probably not an X-linked issue because it's needed for normal cellular function, not specific to males. So E and F are likely incorrect.

Option A is Y-linked recessive. Y is male's only chromosome. But G6PD is involved in female metabolism too, right? Or is it more male-specific? Wait, I think G6PD is actually a sex-specific enzyme. So a deficiency in G6PD can affect both males and females, but the basic inheritance is autosomal. So Y-linked recessive wouldn't make sense because the gene is in the same organism regardless of sex.

Option C is autosomal dominant, but that would mean only one defective allele is needed. But G6PD deficiency is a recessive disease, so the allele needs two copies for the disease. So C is probably wrong.

Option I is incomplete dominance, which is when the phenotype is a mix of both alleles. But that's for cases where one allele masks another. G6PD is a dominant disease, not a recessive one. So I think incomplete dominance doesn't apply here.

Option J is non-Mendelian. Mendelian is about simple dominant-recessive patterns, like dihybrid or trihybrid. Non-Mendelian refers to more complex inheritance patterns, like incomplete dominance, epistasis, etc. But this is a simple recessive condition, so J is not correct.

So the options left are A, H, and E. Wait, no, Y-linked (A) and X-linked (E,F). But as G6PD is involved in both sexes, but the question is about the inheritance pattern. The question is about the pattern, which is autosomal recessive. So the correct answer is H.

The pattern of inheritance for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is determined by its role in the glycolysis pathway, which is essential for cellular energy production. G6PD is a sex-specific enzyme, and its deficiency can affect both males and females. However, the inheritance pattern is governed by its recessive nature, where only two copies of the defective allele are required to cause the disease. This is characteristic of an **autosomal recessive** condition.

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Y-linked recessive** is incorrect because the gene is not sex-specific.
- **B: Y-linked dominant** is incorrect for the same reason.
- **C: autosomal dominant** is incorrect because G6PD deficiency is recessive, not dominant.
- **D: mitochondrial inheritance** is incorrect because mitochondrial diseases are unrelated to G6PD.
- **E: X-linked recessive** is incorrect because G6PD is not an X-linked gene.
- **F: codominant** is incorrect because this refers to both alleles masking each other, which does not apply here.
- **G: autosomal recessive** is correct, as G6PD deficiency is autosomal recessive.
- **H: autosomal recessive** is correct.
- **I: incomplete dominance** is incorrect because incomplete dominance refers to a different scenario.
- **J: non-Mendelian inheritance** is incorrect because Mendelian inheritance is simple dominant-recessive.

The correct answer is **H: autosomal recessive**.

Answer: H
