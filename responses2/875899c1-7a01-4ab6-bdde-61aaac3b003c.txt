Okay, so I've got this question about contingency tables and chi-square tests for independence. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is not true regarding the expected frequencies in contingency tables. The options are A, B, C, D, E.

First, let me recall what a contingency table is. Oh right, it's a table that displays the frequency distribution of variables. The chi-square test of independence is used to determine if there's a significant association between the variables.

Now, what's the rule about expected frequencies? Wait, I remember that for a chi-square test, expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5. I think that's the rule to ensure the chi-square approximation is valid.

Looking at option A: Expected frequencies should be at least 5. So A says they should be at least 5, so they sometimes combine categories if needed. That sounds correct. So A is true, so the answer can't be A.

Option B: Expected frequencies should be whole numbers. Wait, wait. I thought the chi-square test is based on expected frequencies, but those expected frequencies don't have to be whole numbers. They can be decimals. Oh right, because the expected count is calculated as (row total * column total)/n. So if n is 20, row total 10, column total 15, expected is (10*15)/20 = 7.5, which is a decimal. So B is incorrect. So if B is the statement that expects whole numbers, that's not true. So B is not true. So the answer can't be B.

Option C: Contingency tables are not required for chi-square tests for independence. Wait, no, I think contingency tables are required. Because chi-square tests look at the frequencies in a contingency table. So C is saying that they are not required, which is false. So C is not true. But wait, let me think again. The question is which is not true. So if C is an incorrect statement, that would be the answer. But wait, the options: the question is looking for the statement that is NOT true, so perhaps more than one is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: Observed frequencies should be whole numbers. No, wait. In chi-square tests, the observed frequencies are just counts, they can be whole numbers. The expected is the calculated expectation, which is a proportion. Wait, no, the expected frequencies are calculated as (row * column)/n, so they can be fractional. So D is wrong because it says observed frequencies should be whole numbers, which is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Contingency tables are not required for chi-square tests for independence. Wait, no, they are required. Because the test is based on the frequencies in a contingency table. So C is false. But the question is which is not true. So if both B and D are incorrect, but the question gives options, perhaps I'm supposed to pick one.

Wait, let me re-examine the options:

A: Expected at least 5. True, so correct, not the answer.

B: Expected are whole numbers. False, so B is a statement that is not true.

C: Contingency tables are not required. False, because they are required.

D: Observed frequencies are whole numbers. False, because observed can be any count, not necessarily whole (it's integer).

E: Categories are not numerical. No, that's not true, because variables can be categorical, but their categories must be numerical for the chi-square test. For example, variables like age categories (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, etc.) are numerical. So E is wrong.

Wait, but the question is which is not true. So all statements except one are true.

Wait, the options: the question is which is NOT true.

So, looking at each option:

A is correct (true), so not the answer.

B: False, because expected can be decimals. So B is a statement that's not true. So B is incorrect.

C: False, because contingency tables are required. So C is incorrect.

D: False, because observed can be any number, not necessarily whole. So D is incorrect.

E: False, because variables must be numerical to assign categories. So E is incorrect.

Wait, that can't be right. The question is, which is not true. So all four options (A to E) except one are incorrect. Wait, no. Let me read the question again: which is NOT true. So among the options, which is false.

Wait, the question is: "Which of the following is not true..." So only one of the options is incorrect.

So let's re-examine each option.

Option A: Expected >=5. True, but requires combining. So A is correct. So the answer can't be A.

Option B: Expected are whole numbers. No, that's wrong because expected can be decimals. So B is not true. So B is the incorrect statement.

Option C: Contingency tables are not required. No, they are required. So C is wrong.

Option D: Observed frequencies are whole numbers. No, observed frequencies are counts, which can be any number, not necessarily whole. So D is wrong.

Option E: Categories are not numerical. No, variables must be numerical to assign categories. So E is wrong.

Wait, this is confusing. Because the question is asking which option is not true. So all options except one are not true.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option B. The chi-square tests can have expected frequencies as decimal numbers. So option B says "should be whole numbers." So B is incorrect because they can be decimals. So B is not true.

Option D says "observed frequencies should be whole numbers." But observed are counts, so they can be any number, not necessarily integers. So D is also incorrect.

Wait, but looking back, the question is which statement is NOT true. So if any of the options (A-D-E) are false, the question is which is not true.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go through each option.

A: Expected >=5. True. So correct, so the answer is not A.

B: Expected are whole numbers. False. So B is not true.

C: Contingency tables required. False. So C is not true.

D: Observed are whole. False. So D is not true.

E: Categories numerical. False. So E is not true.

So all except A are not correct. Wait, that can't be. But the question is asking which is NOT true.

So the question is which statement is not true. So all the options except A are incorrect.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating A.

Wait, looking back, option A says "expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5, and to achieve this, one sometimes combines categories for one or the other or both of the variables." So A is correct. So when the expected is >=5, sometimes they combine, but the expected being >=5 is a condition, not a statement about whether it's true.

So the question is which statement is not true, so only one of the options is false. Let's see:

Which of the following is not true?

Option B: Expected frequencies should be whole numbers. False.

Option D: Observed frequencies should be whole numbers. False.

Option E: Categories are not numerical. False.

So the false statements are B, D, E. But the question is 'is not true', so all except A are incorrect, but the question is only giving one answer.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, looking at option B: "Expected frequencies should be whole numbers." That's wrong. Because the chi-square test can have expected frequencies as decimals. So B is an incorrect statement.

Option D: "Observed frequencies should be whole numbers." Again, observed can be any number, not necessarily integers.

Option E: "The categories are not numerical for either variable." No, variables must be numerical; their categories are based on numerical values. So E is wrong.

So all three of B, D, E are incorrect. But the options are only four, and the question is which is not true. So perhaps I'm misreading the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Option D: "Observed frequencies should be whole numbers." No, because in reality, the observed frequencies can be any number, even fractions, like 2.5 or 3.3. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "The categories are not numerical for either variable." No, the variables must be numerical; otherwise, you can't create categories. So E is incorrect.

So of all the options, B, D, E are incorrect. But the question asks which is not true. So only one of the options is incorrect, but the question is phrased as "which of the following is not true," implying only one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because the question is about which statement is NOT true, and all except A are wrong. But the options are options A-E, each as a possible statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering each option's validity.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, D, or E.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, the question is which is NOT true. So which of the options is incorrect? Let's reevaluate.

Option B says "expected frequencies should be whole numbers." But chi-square calculations can have expected frequencies as decimals. Because expected = (row * column)/total, which can result in fractional values.

So B is incorrect.

Option D: "Observed frequencies should be whole numbers." Observed counts are integers.

So observed frequencies are whole numbers. So D's statement is correct. So D is true.

Wait, wait, but the question is about which statement is not true.

So only B, D, E are incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is B, D, or E.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

The question is which is not true. So all except one are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, another approach: considering that contingency tables are required for the chi-square test. So option C is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is asking which is not true. So perhaps the incorrect statements are B, D, E. But the question gives four options, and only one is the correct answer.

Wait, then perhaps I should reevaluate each option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what is required for the chi-square test.

Wait, the chi-square test requires that the expected frequencies in each cell are at least 5. So that's correct, which is option A. So A is correct; the statement is true.

So the question is which statement is not true. So the incorrect statements are B, D, E.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is B: Expected frequencies should be whole numbers. But that's incorrect because expected can be decimals.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the chi-square test doesn't require the expected frequencies to be whole numbers. It's only that when the expected frequency is less than 5, you combine the categories to make the expected count >=5. So option A is correct because it's a condition to combine categories when expected is less than 5.

So, back to the options: which is not true.

Option B: Expected frequencies should be whole numbers. No, they can be decimals. So B is incorrect.

Option D: Observed frequencies should be whole numbers. Correct, because observed counts are integers. So D is true.

Option E: Categories are not numerical for either variable. No, they have to be numerical to assign categories. So E is incorrect.

Wait, but then B, D, and E are incorrect. But the question is which one is not true. So all except A are incorrect.

Wait, but the question is asking which is not true, so the correct answer would be B, D, or E.

But wait, the question is a multiple-choice question with options A-E, each is a possible statement. So perhaps only one of the options is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is looking for. Let me re-read it.

The question: "Which of the following is not true with regard to contingency tables for chi-square tests for independence?"

So all the options are statements about the chi-square test. Which of these statements is incorrect.

So, looking at each option again.

Option A: Expected >=5, and sometimes combined. Correct.

Option B: Expected are whole numbers. No, they can be decimals. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Contingency tables are required. Wrong, because they are required. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Observed are whole. No, correct.

Option E: Categories are numerical. No, variables must be numerical. So E is incorrect.

So, which of the options is not true. So all except A are incorrect.

Wait, but the options are presented as choices, and the question is which of these is NOT true. So the incorrect options are B, C, D, E. But the correct answer would be the one that is incorrect.

So the options are:

A: True

B: False

C: False

D: True

E: False

So the question is, which is not true. So all except A are not true. But the question only allows one option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the options. Let me think about what each statement is saying.

Option B: "Expected frequencies should be whole numbers." No, because expected can be fractions.

So option B is false.

So if the question is which is not true, the answer would be B, because it's incorrect.

Option D: "Observed frequencies should be whole numbers." No, observed frequencies are counts, which can be any number, not necessarily integers. So D is incorrect.

Option E: "The categories are not numerical for either variable." No, variables must be numerical for the frequencies to be meaningful. So E is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which is not true. So all of B, D, E are incorrect. But the options are presented as possible answers.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the chi-square formula.

The formula is sum over (O-E)^2 / E.

O is the observed count, E is expected. If observed is a count, it can be any number, including fractions. So option D's statement is true. So D is correct.

So, the incorrect statements are B, C, D, E.

Wait, but the question is which is not true, so each option is a statement, and only one is not true.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option B.

Wait, the user's question is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think again.

The question is about a chi-square test for independence.

Options:

A: Expected frequencies >=5. Correct, but sometimes they are combined.

B: Expected are whole numbers. False.

C: Contingency tables are not required. False, required.

D: Observed are whole. False.

E: Categories are numerical. False.

So, the question is which statement is not true. So all except A are incorrect. But the question requires selecting the option that is not true (i.e., incorrect). So which is not true, i.e., incorrect.

So the incorrect options are B, C, D, and E.

But the question only allows one option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question's correct answer is B.

Wait, no, because B is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is B: expected are whole numbers.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that chi-square tests don't require expected frequencies to be whole numbers. So B is incorrect, making B the correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The question is which statement is not true.

Only one of the options is the incorrect statement.

So, the correct answer should be B, D, or E.

But given the options, the correct answer is option B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the chi-square test.

The chi-square formula uses expected counts, which can be fractions. So B is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B: Expected frequencies should be whole numbers. So that's not true.
</think>

To determine which statement is not true regarding contingency tables for chi-square tests for independence, let's analyze each option carefully:

### Option A: "Expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5, and to achieve this, one sometimes combines categories for one or the other or both of the variables."
- This is correct. The chi-square test requires expected frequencies to be at least 5 to ensure the approximation using the chi-square distribution is valid. When expected frequencies are less than 5, categories are combined to meet this criterion.

### Option B: "Expected frequencies should be whole numbers."
- This is incorrect. The chi-square test does not require expected frequencies to be whole numbers. Instead, they can be decimal values (e.g., 7.5). The chi-square formula uses expected counts, which can be fractions, even if observed counts are whole numbers.

### Option C: "Contingency tables are not required for chi-square tests for independence."
- This is incorrect. Contingency tables are required for chi-square tests because they display the observed and expected frequencies, which are essential for calculating the chi-square statistic.

### Option D: "Observed frequencies should be whole numbers."
- This is correct. Observed frequencies are counts of observations and are always whole numbers.

### Option E: "The categories are not numerical for either variable."
- This is incorrect. For the chi-square test to work, variables must be numerical to assign categories, as non-numerical categories would not provide meaningful counts.

### Conclusion:
The question asks which statement is **not true**. Among the options, **B** is incorrect because expected frequencies do not need to be whole numbers. All other options are true statements about chi-square tests.

**ANSWER: B**
