Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about the demand and supply of grapes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that both the demand for grapes and the supply of grapes increase. I remember that when demand and supply change, they can affect both the equilibrium quantity and the equilibrium price. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact interactions between them.

First, demand increases. If demand goes up, that usually shifts the demand curve to the right. On the other hand, supply increases would shift the supply curve to the right as well. So both curves are moving to the right, but in opposite directions.

Wait, so both curves are shifting to the right. How does that affect the equilibrium? Let me recall: when demand increases and supply increases, the equilibrium quantity should increase. Because both curves are moving to the right, the point where they intersect (the equilibrium point) would have a higher quantity. But what about the price?

Hmm, if demand increases a lot, it could push the price up. Or if supply increases a lot, maybe the price goes down. But in this case, both are increasing. So let's think about it with an example.

Suppose initially, demand was D1 and supply was S1. At equilibrium, quantity Q1 and price P1. If demand increases (D2) and supply increases (S2), both D2 and S2 shift to the right. Let's say D2 is more than S2. So after the shifts, the new demand is D2 and new supply is S2.

Wait, but how do they compare? If D shifts to the right and S shifts to the right, but the magnitude depends on the shifts. Let's say for demand, the shift is larger than the supply. Then the new demand curve would intersect the new supply curve at a higher quantity and higher price. Alternatively, if the supply shift is larger, it could lead to either a higher or lower price.

Wait, but the question says both are increasing. So the demand is increasing, so the demand curve moves to the right. The supply is increasing, so supply curve moves to the right. So the new equilibrium quantity is higher. What about price? Let's think about the effect on price.

Suppose the demand increase is not enough to offset the supply increase. So, for example, if demand increases by a lot and supply only increases a little. Then the equilibrium price might rise because the demand exceeds the supply. If the supply increases a lot, the price could fall because the supply is so high.

Wait, but in the specific question, both are increasing. So whether the price rises or falls depends on which shift is larger. But the question doesn't give us the exact amounts. So if both shifts are in the same direction, the equilibrium quantity will increase, but the price could potentially rise or fall depending on the magnitude of the shifts.

Wait, but the question is about the 'simultaneous increase' of demand and supply. Both are increasing, so the equilibrium quantity must rise. What about the price? Let's think about it again. Let's imagine the curves.

Imagine the original equilibrium is at (Q1, P1). Now, D increases, so the D curve shifts right. S increases, so the S curve shifts right. The new intersection is at (Q2, P2).

Case 1: Let's say the increase in demand is larger than the increase in supply. Then, the new equilibrium price would be higher, as the D curve is higher than the S curve. So Q2 > Q1, P2 > P1.

Case 2: If the increase in supply is larger than demand, then the equilibrium price would drop, but quantity would still be higher? No, wait. If supply increases more, the S curve moves further right. So, the new equilibrium is where the higher S meets the higher D. Wait, but that would mean the price is higher because the supply is increasing more. Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, no, think in terms of shifting. Let's take a specific example.

Suppose before any change, P1 is the equilibrium. Let's say the demand increases (D moves right) and supply increases (S moves right). Suppose both shifts are equal in magnitude. Then the new equilibrium price would be the same as before. Wait, no, because demand is higher, but supply is also higher. The new equilibrium will have a higher quantity and the price could be the same, higher, or lower, depending on which shift is bigger.

Wait, no, actually, if both curves shift right, but the quantity increases by the same amount as the price. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think with numbers.

Imagine initial D is higher, but S is lower. Suppose demand increases by 100 units, and supply increases by 50 units. Then the new D is D0+100, S is S0+50. Where do they intersect? Let's say before, D0 intersects S0 at (Q0, P0). After, D0+100 intersects S0+50 at a higher Q and could be higher, same, or lower P.

But wait, in the case where both are increasing, the equilibrium quantity is definitely higher than before. What about the price? It depends on which curve shifts more. If the demand shift is larger than the supply shift, the equilibrium price will be higher. If the supply shift is larger, the equilibrium price will be lower.

However, the question doesn't provide the relative magnitudes of the shifts. It just says both increase. So, the price could either rise, fall, or stay the same. But wait, no. Because both shifts are to the right, but whether the price rises or falls depends on the relative shifts. But since the question doesn't specify, perhaps we are to assume that one shift is larger than the other, but without knowing, we can't say for sure.

Wait, but the question is about the last character. So the correct answer is about whether the price rises or falls.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. When both demand and supply increase, what happens to the equilibrium.

If demand increases and supply increases, but the quantity increases more than the price.

Wait, no. If both curves shift to the right, but for example, demand increases by 100 and supply by 50, the new equilibrium quantity is higher. The price could rise, fall, or stay the same. But in reality, which is it?

Wait, let's think about another way. The effect on price depends on whether the demand shift is larger than the supply shift. If demand increases by more than supply, the price will rise. If supply increases by more, price will fall. If they equal, price remains same.

But since the question doesn't give us the exact amounts, we can't know for sure. So, in the question, it's stated that both demand and supply increase, but the question is about the equilibrium. So the answer must be that the equilibrium quantity increases, but the price change is ambiguous.

Wait, but the options are whether the price is rising, falling, same, etc. Let me look at the options:

A: quantity rises, price rises. So price increases.

B: quantity rises, price change is ambiguous.

C: quantity same, price rise.

D: quantity falls, price rise.

E: quantity same, price falls.

F: both same. Not likely.

G: quantity falls, price falls.

H: quantity rises, price falls.

I: quantity same, price falls.

J: quantity falls, price change ambiguous.

Wait, in our thought, the quantity increases, but the price's direction depends on which shift is larger. Since the question says that both have increased, but without knowing which is bigger, we can't be certain. So, the price could rise, fall, or stay the same. Hence, the price change is ambiguous.

So the answer would be option B: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.
</think>

The question examines the effects of simultaneous increases in demand and supply on equilibrium quantity and price. When both curves shift to the right, the equilibrium quantity necessarily increases. However, the equilibrium price's direction depends on the relative shifts of demand and supply:

1. **Demand increases more than supply**: The price rises.
2. **Supply increases more than demand**: The price falls.
3. **Shifts are equal**: The price remains unchanged.

Since the question does not specify the relative magnitudes of the shifts, the price's change is ambiguous. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is not certain.
