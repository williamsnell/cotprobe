Okay, so I need to figure out what social power is and the three types. Hmm, social power is about the ability of someone to influence others. I remember reading that there are different forms of power people can have. Let me think.

Wait, resource control power is when someone can manage resources in society. Like, if a leader can control the resources that people have, that's resource control. That makes sense. Then there's distributive power, which is about how resources are distributed. That could relate to how people get what they need. And associative power, I think that's about making others like them. Like, a social leader can make others adopt certain behaviors or beliefs.

Looking at the options, option A says resource control, distributive, associative. Option B is about education, charismatic, punitive. That doesn't sound right. Option C talks about cultural norms, which I think is different. Option D is about changing attitudes or behavior, which is more about behavior change than power. Option E is about changing social status, which I think is more about influence than power. Option F is about legal and executive power, which are more about authority than just power. Option G lists coercive, economic, political. That sounds more accurate because those are the main types of power structures. Option H mentions persuasive, identity, expert. I'm not sure about those. Option I is about media, celebrities, grassroots. Those are more about media influence and social movements. Option J is about controlling economic status, which is more about economic power.

So the correct answer should be G. The types of social power are coercive, economic, and political. Because these are the three primary power structures that are considered important in social contexts. Each type serves different purposes in how power is exercised and perceived in society.

The correct answer is G. Social power refers to the ability to influence others and is categorized into three primary types: coercive, economic, and political. These structures are fundamental in shaping social dynamics and power relationships.
