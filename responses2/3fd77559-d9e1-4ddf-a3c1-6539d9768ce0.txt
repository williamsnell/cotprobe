Question:

Consider the following instance variable and methods in the same class.
 private int[][] matrix;
 /** Precondition: array.length > 0.
 * @return the largest integer in array
 */
 private int max(int[] array)
 { /* implementation not shown */ }
 /** @return num1 if num1 >= num2; otherwise return num2
 */
 public int max(int num1, int num2)
 { /* implementation not shown */ }

Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a class with an instance variable matrix which is a 2D array. The methods in question are max(int[] array) and a static max method that takes two ints. The task is to find the value returned by the method call max(max(matrix[2]), max(matrix[3])).

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I need to understand what each part does.

The matrix is a 2D array. Let's see what it's looking like. The user provided the matrix as:

2 1 4 8
6 0 3 9
5 7 7 6
1 2 3 4

So, it's a 4x4 matrix. Let's visualize it:

Row 0: 2,1,4,8
Row 1:6,0,3,9
Row 2:5,7,7,6
Row 3:1,2,3,4

Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, the matrix is stored as a 2D array, but how are the indices arranged? I think each element is accessed via matrix[row][col]. So matrix[2] would be row 2, and matrix[2][3] is 6. Or wait, maybe the indexes are different. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the problem, the matrix is a 2D array. So, matrix[2] refers to the third row (since indexes start at 0). So for example, matrix[2] is the third row.

Looking at the matrix:

Row 0: [2,1,4,8]
Row 1: [6,0,3,9]
Row 2: [5,7,7,6]
Row 3: [1,2,3,4]

So matrix[2] is [5,7,7,6]. So when the method calls max(matrix[2]), which is the max of [5,7,7,6], which is 7.

Then the next part is max(matrix[3]). matrix[3] is [1,2,3,4], so max is 4.

So the method call is max(7,4). Since 7 is larger than 4, the result is 7.

Looking at the options, let's see which letter corresponds to 7. The options are:

A:8, B:0, C:1, D:2, E:9, F:4, G:5, H:7, I:10, J:6.

So option H is 7. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me recheck the matrix and the calculations.

Wait, in the problem statement, the method call is max(max(matrix[2]), max(matrix[3])). So first, compute max(matrix[2]).

matrix[2] is [5,7,7,6]. The max is 7.

Then, compute max(matrix[3]) which is [1,2,3,4]. Max is 4.

So max(7,4) is 7.

So the correct option is H.

The problem requires determining the result of the method call `max(max(matrix[2]), max(matrix[3]))` based on the given matrix.

First, compute the maximum of `matrix[2]`, which is the third row. The values are 5, 7, 7, 6, so the maximum is 7.

Next, compute the maximum of `matrix[3]`, which is the fourth row. The values are 1, 2, 3, 4, so the maximum is 4.

Finally, compute the maximum of 7 and 4, which is 7. The correct answer is H.

Answer: H
