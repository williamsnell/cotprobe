Question:

PhilLeFrancpurchased (25 / 50) bodily injury insurance and $10,000 property damage insurance.The base premium for thebodily injury insurance was $101, while the base premiumfor the property damage coverage was $48. If Phil hada total factor of 1.37 for bodily injury and a total factor of 1.10forproperty damage, what was his premium for each typeof coverage?

Options:

A: $130.37 for bodily injury coverage and $50.80 for property damage coverage
B: $120.37 for bodily injury coverage and $45.80 for property damage coverage
C: $138.37 for bodily injury coverage and $52.80 for property damage coverage
D: $110.37 for bodily injury coverage and $58.80 for property damage coverage

Okay, so I've got this insurance question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me.

Phil bought two types of insurance: (25/50) bodily injury and $10,000 property damage. So, that means he covered up to $25k for bodily injuries and $50k for property damage. Got it. 

The base premium for bodily injury is $101, and for property damage, it's $48. I remember that the base premium is the minimum amount you have to pay regardless of coverage limits. But the actual premium is more than that because of the factors.

The factors are given as 1.37 for bodily injury and 1.10 for property damage. Factors are multipliers applied to the base premium to get the actual premium. So, I need to calculate each individual's actual premium by multiplying the base by their respective factor.

Let me calculate each one separately.

For bodily injury coverage:
Base premium is $101, factor is 1.37.
So, 101 * 1.37. Let me do the math. 100*1.37=137, plus 1*1.37=1.37. So total 138.37. So the bodily injury premium is $138.37.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the factor apply to each coverage separately? Hmm, maybe I should check the question again. The question says "the total factor", but I'm not sure if it's a combined factor or each coverage's factor. Oh wait, no, the way it's phrased, the factors are for each type of coverage. Oh wait, no, I think the factors are applied to each type. So I calculated each correctly.

Wait, no, perhaps the factors are not applied separately. Let me think. Oh, no, I think factors are applied individually. Like, each coverage's premium is calculated by multiplying the base by their respective factor. So the base for bodily injury is $101, factor 1.37, so 101 * 1.37.

Wait, but I just did that and got $138.37. That's option C's first part. But let me check the property damage.

Property damage base is $48, factor 1.10. So 48 * 1.10=52.80. So the property damage premium is $52.80.

Looking at the options, option C says $138.37 for bodily and $52.80 for property. That matches what I just calculated. So option C's first part is correct, and the second part is also correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is $138.37 for bodily injury and $52.80 for property damage.

Wait, but I just did the calculations. So that's option C. But wait, let me double-check the math. 25/50 for bodily, so that's a 25% limit. So, is the factor applied the same way? Or is the factor a percentage of the limit?

Wait, I think the base is the minimum amount, but factors are the multiples. So, for each coverage, the actual premium is base multiplied by the factor. So the calculations I did are correct.

Alternatively, maybe the factors are applied to the limits? No, typically, factors are applied to the base premium. So the initial method is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is correct based on that. But wait, in the options, let me read them again.

Option C: $138.37 for bodily, $52.80 for property.

Wait, but the question says "what was his premium for each type of coverage?" So that's correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that sometimes factors are applied differently. Oh, wait, no. The factors are given as total factors. So for each coverage, you just multiply by their respective factors.

So, for bodily injury, 101 * 1.37= $138.37.

Property damage: 48 * 1.10= $52.80.

So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me look at the options again to make sure. Oh, the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. The options given are:

A: 130.37 and 50.80

B:120.37 and 45.80

C:138.37 and 52.80

D:110.37 and 58.80

So based on my calculation, option C is correct.

The correct answer is determined by calculating the actual premiums for each type of coverage by multiplying the base premium by the respective factor.

For **bodily injury**:
- Base premium: $101
- Factor: 1.37
- Calculation: $101 * 1.37 = $138.37

For **property damage**:
- Base premium: $48
- Factor: 1.10
- Calculation: $48 * 1.10 = $52.80

Thus, the actual premiums are $138.37 for bodily injury and $52.80 for property damage.
