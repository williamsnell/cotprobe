Okay, so I've got this electrolysis problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about passing a current through an electrolytic cell for 1 hour, and calculating the grams of each metal deposited. The setup is that the current is 1.0 amp, and the time is 1.0 hour. They also mention that 96,500 coulombs equal one Faraday. So, I remember that Faraday's laws of electrolysis are involved here, and the key equation is Q = n * F.

Wait, right, Faraday's first law says that the amount of substance deposited is directly proportional to the amount of electric charge passed through the circuit. The formula is m = (Q * M) / (n * F), where M is molar mass, n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant.

So for each metal, I'll need to find out how much charge is passed, then how many moles of electrons that is, then moles of metal, then grams from the molar mass.

Let's break it down for each of the three metals: Ag, Cu, Al.

First, the current is 1.0 amp. Time is 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, so 3600 seconds. Oh wait, charge Q is I * t, so ampere times seconds gives Coulombs. Yes, I think that's right.

So Q = I * t = 1.0 A * 3600 s = 3600 C.

But wait, the Faraday constant is 96500 C/mol. So each mole of electrons contributes 96500 coulombs.

So for each metal, I need to find the number of moles of electrons, then moles of metal, and then grams.

Starting with silver (Ag):

Silver has a +1 charge. So each Ag+ gains one electron. So the reaction is Ag+ + e⁻ → Ag. So one mole of electrons per mole of Ag.

So moles of electrons (n) for Ag is Q / F = 3600 C / 96500 C/mol. Let me calculate that.

3600 / 96500 = approximately 0.037176 mol of electrons.

But each mole of Ag requires one electron, so moles of Ag deposited is also 0.037176 mol.

The molar mass of Ag is about 108 g/mol.

Mass = moles * molar mass = 0.037176 * 108 ≈ let's compute.

0.037176 * 100 = 3.7176, 0.037176 *8=0.2974. Total ≈3.7176 +0.2974=3.015 grams. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C says 4.02g Ag, option A has 1.08g. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check that again. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 3600/96500 = let's compute that accurately.

Compute 3600 divided by 96500:

So 3600 / 96500 = 0.037176 mol e-.

Molar mass Ag is 107.87 g/mol, about 108.

So 0.037176 * 108 = ?

Let me compute 0.037176 * 100 = 3.7176, 0.037176 *8 = 0.297408 → sum is 3.7176 + 0.297408 = 3.815 g? Wait no, wait, 0.037176 * 108 = 0.037176 * (100 + 8) = 3.7176 + 0.297408 = 3.815 grams. So about 3.82g?

Wait, but the options don't have 3.82g for Ag. Hmm. Let's look at the options again.

Options for Ag are 1.08, 0.80, 4.02, etc. Wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong. Wait, wait, perhaps I confused Faraday's constant. Let me double-check the constants.

Wait, 96,500 coulombs per mole of electrons. So that's correct.

Wait, 3600 /96500 = 0.037176 mol e-. So Ag is 0.037176 mol. Ag's molar mass is 107.87 g/mol.

So 0.037176 * 107.87 ≈ let me compute this precisely.

0.037176 *100=3.7176

0.037176 *7 = 0.260232

0.037176 *0.87= let's compute 0.037176 * 0.8=0.029741 and 0.037176 *0.07=0.002602. Sum: 0.032343.

So total is 3.7176 + 0.260232 = 3.9778 + 0.032343= 4.0101 grams. Oh, so approximately 4.01 grams. Looking at the options, option H says 4.02g Ag, which is very close. Option F is 2.00g, which is lower. So option H is Ag: ~4.02g.

Wait, but why do I have 4.01? Let's make precise calculation.

Compute 3600 / 96500.

3600 ÷ 96500 = 3600 /96500 = (3600 ÷ 100) = 36, 36 ÷ 965 = 0.037176.

Wait, 96500 = 96.5 * 1000. So 3600 / (96.5 * 1000) = (3600 /96.5) /1000.

3600 ÷96.5: Let me compute that.

96.5 * 37 is 96.5 *30 = 2895, 96.5*7=675.5 → 2895+675.5=3570.5. Hmm, 3570.5 is less than 3600. 3600-3570.5=29.5.

So 37 + (29.5/96.5) → 37 + 0.3053 ≈37.3053.

So 3600/96500 = (37.3053)/1000= 0.0373053 mol.

So 0.0373053 mol of electrons. Now Ag's molar mass is 107.87 g/mol.

So 0.0373053 *107.87 = ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.0373053 * 100 = 3.73053.

0.0373053 *7.87 = ?

0.0373053 *7=0.2611371.

0.0373053 *0.87=0.0373053 *0.8=0.02984424, 0.0373053 *0.07=0.002611371.

So 0.02984424 +0.002611371 = 0.032455611.

So 0.2611371 +0.032455611 = 0.2935927.

So total is 3.73053 + 0.2935927 = 4.0241 grams.

So approximately 4.02 grams, which matches option H's Ag part.

So Ag is 4.02g, which is in option H.

Wait, but let's check the other metals.

Next, Copper (Cu^2+).

Cu^2+ gains 2 electrons. So for each mole of Cu deposited, 2 moles of electrons are involved.

So moles of Cu = Q/(n * F) = 3600 / (2 *96500) ) = 3600/(193000) = 0.018648 mol.

Wait, 193000 is 2*96500. So 3600/193000=0.018648 mol.

Molar mass of Cu is 63.55 g/mol.

So mass = 0.018648 *63.55.

Let me compute that.

0.018648 *60=1.11888.

0.018648 *3.55= approx 0.06615.

So total about 1.185 g.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

0.018648 * 63.55.

Compute 63.55 * 0.018648:

63.55 * 0.01 =0.6355.

63.55 *0.008= 0.5084.

63.55 *0.000648= approx 0.04115 (since 0.000648 *63.55= approx 0.04115).

Adding them: 0.6355 +0.5084=1.1439 +0.04115=1.185 grams. So approximately 1.185g.

Looking for the options: option B says 3.40g Ag, 1.60g Cu, 1.54g Al. Option H says 4g Ag, 1.18g Cu, which aligns, but wait, wait, let me check option H again.

Option H: Ag:4.02g, Cu:1.18g, Al:0.335g.

So for Cu, 1.18g is correct. Hmm, but let me check the other metals.

Aluminum (Al^3+). It gains 3 electrons.

So moles of Al = Q/(3 * F) = 3600/(3*96500) = 3600/289500 = 0.012418 mol.

Molar mass of Al is 26.98 g/mol. So mass =0.012418 *26.98.

Compute that: 0.012418 *26.98.

Approximately: 0.012418 *27=0.335286, but 26.98 is 0.02 less than 27.

So 0.012418 * (-0.02) = -0.000248.

So 0.335286 -0.000248 = 0.335038 grams, approximately 0.335g.

Which matches option H's Al part.

So putting it all together, each metal's mass is:

Ag: 4.02g

Cu: 1.185g

Al: 0.335g

Looking at the options, option H says all three, but wait, looking again:

Option H says: 4.02g Ag, 1.18g Cu, 0.335g Al.

Wait, but why did I get 1.185 and option H shows 1.18g? Oh, because the calculation was approximate. So perhaps it's correct.

So the correct option is H: Ag:4.02g, Cu:1.18g, Al:0.335g.

Wait, but wait, option H’s Cu is 1.18g, but I thought that the calculation was 1.185g. But perhaps the options are rounded.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I see that option H includes all these. So H would be the correct one.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option H is: 4.02g Ag, 1.18g Cu, 0.335g Al. So it matches.

But wait, wait, but option G says 0.54g Ag, which is way too low, so that's not right.

Wait, but why in the earlier calculation for Cu did I get approximately 1.185g, but the option H says 1.18g. Is that a typo, or am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 3600 / (2 *96500) = 3600 /193000 = 0.018648 mol.

Cu's molar mass is 63.55 g/mol. So 0.018648 *63.55 = let's compute.

0.018648 *60 = 1.11888.

0.018648 *3.55 = 0.06615.

So total is 1.185 grams. So option H's Cu is 1.18g, which is correct to two decimal places (1.18). So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option H is correct.

To determine the amount of each metal deposited during electrolysis, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The formula is:

\[
m = \frac{Q \cdot M}{n \cdot F}
\]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the deposited metal,
- \( Q \) is the charge passed (in coulombs),
- \( M \) is the molar mass of the metal,
- \( n \) is the number of electrons transferred per mole of metal,
- \( F \) is Faraday's constant (\( 96500 \, \text{C/mol} \)).

### Given:
- Current (\( I \)) = \( 1.0 \, \text{A} \),
- Time (\( t \)) = \( 1.0 \, \text{hr} = 3600 \, \text{s} \),

- Molar mass of silver (\( M_{\text{Ag}} \)) = \( 107.87 \, \text{g/mol} \).
- Mass of silver deposited (\( m_{\text{Ag}} \)) = \( n \cdot M_{\text{Ag}} = 0.037176 \cdot 107.87 \approx 4.02 \, \text{g} \).

#### (2) Copper (\( \text{Cu}^{2+} \)):
- Each copper ion gains 2 electrons (\( n = 2 \)).
- Moles of electrons (\( n \)) = \( \frac{Q}{2F} = \frac{3600}{2 \cdot 96500} = \frac{3600}{193000} \approx 0.018648 \, \text{mol} \).
- Molar mass of copper (\( M_{\text{Cu}} \)) = \( 63.55 \, \text{g/mol} \).
- Mass of copper deposited (\( m_{\text{Cu}} \)) = \( n \cdot M_{\text{Cu}} = 0.018648 \cdot 63.55 \approx 1.185 \, \text{g} \).

#### (3) Aluminum (\( \text{Al}^{3+} \)):
- Each aluminum ion gains 3 electrons (\( n = 3 \)).
- Moles of electrons (\( n \)) = \( \frac{Q}{3F} = \frac{3600}{3 \cdot 96500} = \frac{3600}{289500} \approx 0.012418 \, \text{mol} \).
- Molar mass of aluminum (\( M_{\text{Al}} \)) = \( 26.98 \, \text{g/mol} \).
- Mass of aluminum deposited (\( m_{\text{Al}} \)) = \( n \cdot M_{\text{Al}} = 0.012418 \cdot 26.98 \approx 0.335 \, \text{g} \).

### Results:
- Silver (\( \text{Ag} \)): \( 4.02 \, \text{g} \),
- Copper (\( \text{Cu} \)): \( 1.185 \, \text{g} \),
- Aluminum (\( \text{Al} \)): \( 0.335 \, \text{g} \).

### Option:
