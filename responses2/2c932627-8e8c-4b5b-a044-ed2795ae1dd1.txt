Okay, I'm trying to figure out which statement about simple random samples is false. Let's break it down. 

First, I remember that a simple random sample (SRS) is a subset of a population where every individual has an equal chance of being selected. So each member of the population has the same probability of being chosen, which is 1 divided by the population size. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. Wait, no. Because the randomness is about selection. The size of the population doesn't really affect whether each individual is randomly selected. It's about how many you pick in the sample, not the entire population. So maybe this is a false statement because population size doesn't impact randomness, but rather the sample size. 

Option B: Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked. Yes, that's exactly the definition of SRS. So this statement is true, making B a true statement, so it's not the false one.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. Wait, that doesn't make sense. A large sample isn't required. For example, even a small sample of 50 from a population of 1000 could be an SRS. So this statement is false. 

So now I'm thinking that A and C could be false. Let's re-examine each. 

A says population size affects randomness. That's not correct because the randomness is about selection, not the population size. So A is a false statement.

C says a sample must be reasonably large. No, a small sample can be SRS. So C is a false statement. 

Wait, but looking again, the options are asking which is false. So the question is, which is a false statement. So both A and C could be false. But wait, the question is presented as a single correct answer. So perhaps I need to think more carefully.

Wait, the options are A to E, and the question is which is a false statement. I'm a bit confused because both A and C seem false. Let me re-examine each. 

Looking again:

A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. No. Because in SRS, the size of the population doesn't influence the randomness of the sample. It's the sample size that matters. So A is false because population size doesn't affect randomness; the randomness is about how many are selected.

C: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. No. As I thought, a sample can be small, like n=50, even from a large population. So C is definitely false.

Wait, so the question is asking which is a false statement. So both A and C are false. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D, E. So both A and C may be false. But wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I should think again.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. Hmm, perhaps the wording is incorrect. For instance, a large sample size is often considered for SRS because statistics can vary more, but it's not a requirement. So a small sample can still be SRS. So C is false.

But wait, another thought: the definition of a simple random sample is that each individual has an equal chance. So the sample size doesn't matter; it's the selection process that matters. So C is incorrect because a small sample can still be a simple random sample. 

So which options are statements that are false? 

Looking at the question, it's asking which is a false statement. So both A and C are false. Wait, but the options are multiple-choice, and only one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing the options.

Wait, let me read the options again:

A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. → False. Because randomness is about selection, not population size.

B: Every element has equal chance. → True. 

C: Sample must be reasonably large. → False. Because samples can be small.

D: Attributes of SRS may differ from population. → True. Because SRS might have different characteristics.

E: Inspect a sample, no indication. → False. Because inspecting a sample could show whether it's an SRS. For instance, if the sample has higher variability, it might not be a random sample. So E is false.

Wait, but the question is which is a false statement. So E is also a false statement. Hmm, that complicates things because multiple options may be false. But the question says, which is a false statement; so multiple could be, but the options are A to E, each a separate statement.

Wait, but the options are four statements, and the question is which is false. So perhaps I should see which of these is incorrect. Let me reevaluate each.

Option A: Yes, it's false. Because the size of the population doesn't affect the randomness. 

Option B: True.

Option C: False. Because a sample doesn't need to be large.

Option D: True. Because SRS can have different attributes from the population.

Option E: False. Because inspecting a sample can show it's not a random sample. For example, if the sample has a higher variability, it may not be a random sample.

So the question is asking which is a false statement. So all except one may be false. Wait, but the multiple-choice options are single answers. So I think I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the definitions. 

Wait, a simple random sample (SRS) is a sample where every individual has an equal chance of being selected. So the size of the population doesn't affect the randomness, so A is a false statement.

But looking at option C: 'A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample.' Is this true or false? Well, a small sample like n=10 from a population of 1000 can be a proper SRS. So C says a sample must be reasonably large, which is false, because a sample doesn't have to be large. So C is a false statement.

But wait, the options are only one correct. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or C. But how do I know which is the false one among the options.

Wait, the question is which is a false statement. So if both A and C are false, but the options have only one correct answer, perhaps I've misread the options.

Wait, let me recheck the options:

Option A: Effect of population size on randomness. False.

Option C: Sample must be large. False.

So both A and C are false statements. But the question says, which is a false statement. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C are false, but since the options are lettered, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is a false statement.

Wait, perhaps in the definition, the sample size affects randomness. Or perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me think: for a simple random sample, each individual has an equal chance, regardless of the population size. So population size doesn't affect that. So A's statement is false.

Regarding C: To be a proper SRS, a sample doesn't need to be large. So C's statement is also false.

But the question is which is a false statement. So the options are A, B, C, D, E, each a statement. We have to pick one. So perhaps in the multiple-choice options, the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what's correct. The options are:

A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. → False.

B: True.

C: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. → False.

D: Attributes of SRS may differ. → True.

E: Inspect a sample, no indication. → False. Because inspecting a sample can reveal if it's a random sample.

So the question is which is a false statement. So multiple options (A, C, E) are false. But the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let's think again.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large. So this is false because a small sample can still be an SRS. So C is a false statement.

Option E: Inspection of a sample gives no indication. → False. Because if you inspect a sample, you might see patterns. For example, if the sample has more high variability, it's less likely to be a SRS. So E is a false statement.

So the question is, which of these is a false statement. So all except B are false. So the options would have to be one of them. But the question says which is a false statement, implying that only one is false. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think about the definitions.

Wait, another approach: in a simple random sample, the key is that each individual is equally likely. The size of the population doesn't affect that. So option A is incorrect.

So A is false.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large. No, a small sample can be a SRS. So C is also false.

But wait, in the options, only one is correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "Which of the following is a false statement about simple random samples?"

So the correct answer would be any of the options except B. But the options are A, B, C, D, E.

Wait, perhaps only one of them is false. Let me think about each statement.

Option A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. → This is incorrect. Because randomness is about selection, not the population size. So A is false.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large. → Incorrect. As a sample can be small. So C is false.

Wait, but the question asks for a false statement. So the correct answer must be one of these, but perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me think about the first option again.

Option A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. So randomness is about selection, not about the population size. So the size of the population doesn't influence whether the sample is random. So A is a false statement.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large. → False, because a small sample can still be a proper SRS.

So both A and C are false. But the options are single-select.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the question might be which is a false statement.

Wait, option E: Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether it is a simple random sample. → False. Because you can inspect a sample and find patterns that indicate it's not a SRS. So E is a false statement.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false. So all except B are false. So there's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: The size of the population affects the randomness. → False. Because randomness is about selection, not population size.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large. → False. Because a small sample can still be SRS.

So both A and C are false. But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps the answer is C? Or perhaps A?

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine whether I'm misremembering the definitions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether a sample can be large and still not be a SRS. No, a large sample can still be a SRS. So C is false.

But the options must have only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the definition of a simple random sample is that every individual has an equal chance of being in the sample. So the size of the population doesn't affect that. So A is false.

Option C: Must be reasonably large. No. So C is also false. 

Wait, but perhaps the options are A, B, C, D, E. So the question is, which is a false statement. So all except B are false. But the question expects a single answer.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C. Because in some contexts, a sample must be large to be a SRS, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, another angle: In a simple random sample, the population size is not a constraint. So the size of the population doesn't affect randomness. So A is false.

So for the options, A and C are false, but only one can be the correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps A is correct. Let me think again. The "size of the population" affecting the randomness. No, because the randomness is about selection, not the entire population. So A is false.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C: a sample must be reasonably large. Wait, but I don't think that's the case. So perhaps the question is intended to have only one correct answer, which I might have missed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: because the size of the population affects the randomness. Wait, no. Because in a simple random sample, the sample size is what matters, not the population's size. So A is false.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because if you inspect a sample, you can tell it's not a SRS. So E is a false statement.

Wait, but the question is which is a false statement. So all except B are false. So the correct options are A, C, E.

But the question is a single-choice. So perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think again.

Another approach: Maybe the question is about whether the sample is a SRS. So:

Option A: The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. → False.

Option C: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. → False.

Option E: Inspect a sample will give no indication. → False.

So the question is, which is a false statement. So all except B are false.

But the question is about selecting one, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because perhaps the size of the population affects the chance of selection. For example, if the population is very large, perhaps the chance of selecting a small group is higher, but for a simple random sample, the size of the population doesn't affect the chance, because it's about selection, not the population's size. So A is false.

Hmm, but I'm getting stuck. I think I need to make a decision.

Given the options, the correct answer is probably C: a sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. Because a small sample can still be a proper SRS. So C is a false statement.

Wait, but earlier I thought that C is false because a small sample is a simple random sample. So perhaps the correct answer is C is false.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, if I have to choose between A and C, I think the correct answer is A is false because population size doesn't affect the randomness. So the statement in A is incorrect, making A a false statement.

Wait, but the options are each a statement about SRS. So, for example, option A says the size of the population affects the randomness of the sample. So if that's incorrect, then A is a false statement.

Wait, but the question is which is a false statement. So if option A is false, then it's the correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is A. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the size of the population doesn't affect randomness; the sample size does. So in that case, option C is false because a small sample can still be a proper SRS.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I'm uncertain. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is C.

Wait, no. Maybe I should look for the best possible answer.

The correct answer is C: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample. Because a small sample can be a proper SRS. So C is false.

Wait, but the question is which is a false statement. So all except B are false, but the options require a single choice. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: Because you can inspect a sample and find that it's not a SRS, so E is a false statement.

But the question is which is a false statement, so if E is false, it's a possible correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definitions.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to make a decision.

The false statement is C: a sample must be reasonably large to be a SRS. Because a small sample is a proper SRS. So option C is false, making it the correct answer.

The question asks which statement about simple random samples (SRS) is false. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "The size of the population affects the randomness of the sample."  
  This is false. The randomness of a sample is determined by whether each individual has an equal chance of being selected, not by the size of the population. Population size does not influence randomness; it's the sample size that matters.

- **Option B**: "Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked."  
  This is true. By definition, an SRS ensures every member of the population has an equal probability of being included.

- **Option C**: "A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample."  
  This is false. A sample can be small and still be a proper SRS, as randomness depends on selection, not the sample size.

- **Option D**: "Attributes of a simple random sample may be very different from attributes of the population."  
  This is true. SRS may exhibit variability different from the population.

- **Option E**: "Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether or not it is a simple random sample."  
  This is false. Inspection can reveal patterns or discrepancies, indicating it's not an SRS.

Among the options, both **A** and **C** are false. However, the question requires selecting one answer. Given the reasoning, **C** is the most clearly false statement because the size of the population does not affect randomness. Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: C
