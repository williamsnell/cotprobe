Okay, so I've got this math problem here: evaluate −7(y − 6) when y is 8. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember the steps.

First, I should probably substitute y with 8 in the expression. So the expression becomes −7(8 − 6). Right, because y is 8. Now I need to solve the part in the parentheses first. 8 minus 6 is 2. So now the expression is −7 times 2. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the negative sign here. So −7 multiplied by 2. What's that? Well, multiplying a negative by a positive gives a negative result. So −7 * 2 is −14. Let me double-check that. 7 times 2 is 14, and since one of them is negative, it's -14. 

So the result should be −14. Let me look at the options. Option H is −14, so that's probably the right answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the substitution or the calculation. Did I miss a negative sign somewhere? 

Wait another thought: Oh wait, the original expression is −7(y − 6), which is the same as −7 multiplied by (y − 6). Oh wait, I think I did it correctly. Because when you distribute a negative sign with the multiplication, it affects each term inside the parentheses. Wait, no, in this case, it's just −7 multiplied by the quantity (y−6). So you substitute first, then multiply by −7.

Another way to think about it: If y is 8, then y−6 is 2. Then −7 times 2 is −14. Yep, that's correct.

So the final answer is −14, which is option H.

The correct answer is H: −14.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Substitute y with 8 in the expression: −7(8 − 6).
2. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 8 − 6 = 2.
3. Multiply by −7: −7 × 2 = −14.
4. The result is −14, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
