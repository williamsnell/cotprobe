Question:

An employee was hired under a written contract to work for an employer for five years at a monthly salary of $1,500. In addition, the employment contract provided that the employer would pay the employee an annual bonus "to be determined by the employer within two weeks after the year's profits have been ascertained. "At the end of the first year, the business showed a net profit of $50,000. Accordingly, the employer and the employee agreed that the employee should receive a bonus of $5,000. This amount was subsequently paid to the employee. At the end of the second year, the business realized a net profit of $10,000. Once the profit had been calculated, the employer telephoned the employee and offered him a second-year bonus of $1,000. The employee refused and demanded a bonus of $2,000. The employer refused the employee's demand and immediately terminated his employment. Following his dismissal, the employee brought suit for breach of contract against the employer. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The employer is excused for his obligation to pay a bonus, because of the unforeseen downtum in business during the second year.
B: The employee is entitled to a $2,000 bonus as he demanded, since the contract did not specify the conditions for the bonus amount.
C: The employer can terminate the contract as the profits were not as expected.
D: The employee is not entitled to any recovery, because employment contracts are generally terminable at will.
E: The employer has the right to decide the bonus amount, thus there is no breach of contract.
F: The employer is not obligated to pay a bonus as it was discretionary based on profits.
G: The employee is entitled to a bonus equivalent to the first year since the contract did not specify the bonus amount would change.
H: The employee can sue for breach of contract but cannot claim for the second year's bonus.
I: The employee is not entitled to a bonus, but the employee can sue for loss of wages.

Okay, so I've got this contract question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on contracts, but I'll try to recall what I learned in law school.

So, the setup is that an employee was hired under a written contract for five years. The monthly salary is $1,500. The contract also promises an annual bonus to be determined by the employer within two weeks after the profits are ascertained. 

First year: business made $50,000 profit. The employer and employee agreed the bonus is $5,000. That's paid at the end of the first year. Okay, that part seems straightforward. But the second year, profit was $10,000. The employer called to offer a $1,000 bonus. The employee doesn't want $1,000; he wants $2,000. So he demands that. The employer refuses, and they terminated the job.

Now, the question is about whether the employee is entitled to a second bonus. The options are A to H, with F and G being specific.

The options:

A: Employer excused for bonus obligation due to bad profits. But in some cases, if the employer can prove there was a good reason, like a downturn, maybe they can terminate. But in this case, the profits were bad, but they didn't specify. The contract wasn't clear on the bonus amount. So maybe A is not correct because the contract didn't specify the bonus amount.

B: Employee is entitled to $2k since contract didn't specify. Hmm, some contracts have clauses about the bonus amount. But others, like profit-sharing, sometimes have varying amounts. But the problem states the contract says the bonus is determined by the employer. So it's a variable amount. So B might be incorrect because it's not about the variable amount, but whether the contract had a clause about variable amounts.

C: Employer can terminate because profits weren't as expected. Well, the contract didn't specify that it's based on profits. It's a bonus based on profits. The contract only says the bonus is determined by the employer within two weeks after profits. So if the profits were bad, the employer can decide. But if the contract says it's based on profits, then maybe they have a duty to pay the bonus. So if profits were bad, maybe the employer has a duty to pay. So C says the employer has the right to terminate. But if the contract didn't specify that the bonus was tied to profits, the employer might have no duty. So C might not be correct because the contract doesn't specify that the bonus is tied to profits. Hmm.

D: Employee not entitled to any recovery because contracts are terminated at will. But the contract was for five years, with a termination upon breach. The question says the employer terminated the contract. But the termination is based on whether the employee accepted the bonus. So the termination was for breach. So the contract was a written one, but the employee accepted the bonus. So the employer's termination was his breach. But the question is about whether the employee can recover the bonus.

E: Employer has the right to decide the bonus. That's true, because the contract said an annual bonus to be determined by the employer. So the employer can set it. But when the employee didn't accept, the employer terminated. So the problem is about whether the employee can recover, not whether the employer has the right to set it.

Now, looking at the options, which focus on whether the employee is entitled to the second bonus.

Option F: The employer isn't obligated to pay a bonus because it was based on profit. Wait, the contract says the bonus is determined by the employer. So the employer has a duty. So F says they weren't obligated, which might be incorrect. The contract says it's a duty to pay. So F is wrong.

Option G: Employee entitled to a bonus as the contract didn't specify. But the contract says the bonus is determined by the employer within two weeks after profits. So the contract didn't specify the amount. It didn't say the bonus was a fixed amount or tied to profits. So the contract doesn't state whether the bonus is tied to profits or not. So, the employee isn't entitled to a specific amount unless the contract says so. Since it doesn't, G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Employee not entitled to a second bonus, but can sue for loss of wages. Hmm, the contract didn't specify an annual bonus, so the employee didn't get any because there was no clause. So H's reasoning might not hold. Because the contract didn't specify, the employee didn't get the bonus. So, the employee didn't get the second bonus. So H's reasoning that he can't claim it is based on contract terms. But the question is, did the contract specify a bonus amount? Let me check.

The contract said the employer would pay an annual bonus "to be determined by the employer within two weeks after the year's profits have been ascertained." So, it's more of a variable bonus. The amount isn't specified in the contract. So the employee didn't get the bonus in the first place because there was no clause. So H's reasoning that he can't claim is correct. But what about his claim about loss of wages?

Wait, the question is about whether the employee is entitled to the second bonus. So the fact that the contract didn't specify the amount (so it's a variable bonus) doesn't mean the employee can't claim it. He did get the first bonus because the contract allowed for it. So the second bonus would have been a variable amount, but the contract didn't say it's tied to profits. So the employee didn't get the second bonus. So H says he can't claim, which would be correct in that aspect, but the main question is whether he was entitled to the second bonus.

Wait, the problem is whether the employee is entitled to the second bonus. The contract didn't specify the bonus amount, which means the employee didn't get it. So the second bonus didn't exist. So the employee didn't receive the second bonus. Therefore, H's statement that he can't claim is correct, but the question is about whether he is entitled to it. So H's reasoning is right. So when the question is, "which statement is the most accurate," the question is whether the employee is entitled to the second bonus.

So, the correct answer is H is correct. Wait, but the options are about whether the employee is entitled to the bonus. So the question is whether the employee is entitled to the second bonus.

The options are about whether the employee can sue for it. So H says the employee isn't entitled because the contract didn't specify. So if the contract didn't specify the bonus amount, the employee didn't get it. So he didn't get the second bonus. Therefore, H is correct. So the employee wasn't entitled to the second bonus because the contract didn't specify an annual bonus.

So the options are:

A: Dismissing the employer's obligation because of bad profits. But the contract says the bonus is determined by the employer, so if the contract is binding, the employer has a duty to pay. So A is incorrect.

B: Employee is entitled to $2k because the contract didn't specify the amount. But the contract says the bonus is determined by the employer, not that it's variable. So B is incorrect.

C: Employer can terminate because profits weren't as expected. But the contract didn't specify that the bonus was tied to profits, so the employer has no duty. So C is incorrect.

D: Employee not entitled because the contract doesn't terminate at will. But the termination was because the employee accepted the bonus. So the contract was terminated for breach of contract. So the employee can sue for breach, but not for the bonus. So D's reasoning is incorrect.

E: Employer has the right to set the bonus. That's correct because the contract says so. But the employee didn't accept, so the employer terminated. So E says he has the right, which is true. But does that mean the employee can recover? No, because he didn't accept. So E's statement is correct in that the employer has the right, but the employee didn't accept, so he can't recover. But the question is about whether the employee is entitled to the second bonus. So E is correct in the sense of the employer having the right to set it, but the employee didn't accept, so the contract was breached, and the employee can sue for breach of contract. But whether the employee is entitled to the bonus is a different question. 

Wait, the question is about the employee's eligibility to claim the second bonus. So the contract didn't specify the bonus amount, so the employee didn't receive it. So in that case, the employee is not entitled to any recovery for the second bonus.

Looking at the options, which one is correct about the employee's claim.

Option H: The employee can't claim for the bonus because the contract didn't specify. Because the contract didn't say the bonus was tied to profits, the employee didn't get it. So H is correct.

So the options are:

H: The employee can't claim for the second year's bonus.

Wait, the question is, "the most accurate statement?" So which is the correct reason why the employee didn't get the bonus.

H says the contract didn't specify the bonus amount. So he didn't get it. So H is correct.

So the correct answer is H.

The question revolves around whether the employee is entitled to a second annual bonus under the contract. The key points are:

1. **Contract Terms**: The contract states that an annual bonus will be determined by the employer after profits are ascertained. There is no clause specifying the bonus's amount or tied to profits.

2. **Employee's Claim**: The employee received the first bonus as the contract allowed for it. However, the second bonus was a variable amount that the contract did not specify, and the employee did not accept it.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. The contract does not explicitly excuse the employer's obligation to pay a bonus, as it is a variable amount.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The contract does not specify an annual bonus, so the employee was not entitled to a specific amount.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The contract does not tie the bonus to profits, so the employer has no duty to pay a specific amount.
   - **D**: Incorrect. The contract does not terminate at will, and termination was due to the employee's acceptance of the bonus.
   - **E**: Incorrect. The contract allows the employer to set the bonus, but the employee did not accept it.
   - **F**: Incorrect. The contract does not state that the bonus is tied to profits, so the employee was not obligated to receive it.
   - **G**: Incorrect. The contract does not specify an annual bonus, so the employee was not entitled to a specific amount.
   - **H**: Correct. The contract does not specify the bonus amount, so the employee was not entitled to a second annual bonus. The employer has the right to set the bonus, but the employee did not accept it, leading to termination.

The correct answer is **H**, as the contract does not specify the bonus amount, making the employee entitled to no recovery for the second year's bonus.

ANSWER: H
