Okay, so I've got this gas problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: A 5000-cm³ container holds 4.90 grams of a gas when the pressure is 75.0 cm Hg and the temperature is 50°C. Now, they're asking what the pressure will be if 6.00 grams of this gas is confined in a 2000-cm³ container at 0°C. The options are A to J, each with a pressure value.

Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that when dealing with gas problems involving changes in volume, pressure, and temperature, the combined gas law is probably involved. The formula is PV = nRT, right? But wait, sometimes it's easier to use the combined gas law when the amount of gas (n) is involved. Oh wait, but in this problem, the amount of gas is given as 4.90 grams initially and 6.00 grams in the new container. So I think I'll need to use the ideal gas law, considering both initial and final states.

Wait, but wait—because the problem is about finding the pressure in the new container, I should probably use the combined gas law. The combined gas law is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. But I'm a bit confused about the units here. Let me think about the units.

The initial state is 5000 cm³ (which I can convert to liters because I think that's easier) at 75.0 cm Hg pressure and 50°C. The final state is 2000 cm³, which is 2 liters, and 0°C. So I should convert all temperatures to Kelvin.

Wait, but wait, wait. No. Because the pressure is given in cm Hg, which is a unit of pressure, but the ideal gas law uses P in units like atm or Pascals. Oh, wait, but in the combined gas law, the units should all be consistent, so maybe I can use pressure in terms of the same unit. Alternatively, maybe using the ratio approach is better.

Wait, let me get all the units right.

Let me list out the given data:

Initial state:
- Volume V1 = 5000 cm³. Oh wait, 1 cm³ = 1 mL, but I think that's not relevant here. Wait, 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So V1 = 5 cm³? No, wait, 5000 cm³ is 5 liters. Oh no, wait, 5000 cm³ equals 5 liters because 1000 cm³ = 1 liter. So V1 is 5 liters.

Wait no, 5000 cm³ is 5 liters? Let me compute: 5000 ÷ 1000 = 5. So yes, V1 is 5 L.

Temperature T1: 50°C. To convert to Kelvin, add 273.15. So T1 = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K.

Pressure P1: 75.0 cm Hg. I need to convert this to a unit compatible with the ideal gas law. I'm a bit rusty on the conversions, but I remember that 1 atm is 760 cm Hg. So 75 cm Hg is (75/760) atm. Let me compute that: 75 ÷ 760 ≈ 0.09868 atm.

But wait, the ideal gas law uses P in terms of the same unit as the other constants. Alternatively, since the units might complicate things, perhaps it's better to handle all in terms of Pascals or mmHg. Let me think about each step.

Wait, the initial state has P1 = 75 cm Hg, n =4.90 g, V1=5 L, T1 =323.15 K. The final state has P2 = ?, n=6.00 g, V2=2 L, T2 = 0°C → 273.15 K.

Wait, but maybe all the steps should be in terms of the same unit for P. Hmm.

Alternatively, since the problem relates two different conditions, I can use the combined gas law which is (P1 V1) / T1 = (P2 V2) / T2.

Wait, but wait, the amount of gas (n) affects the equation. Or does it? Because in the combined gas law, n is a constant if the process is isothermal or something, but in this problem, no—because the amount of gas is changing. So wait, that complicates things. Because using P1 V1 / T1 = n1 R T1 and P2 V2 / T2 = n2 R T2. Hmm, but in that case, since R is the same, maybe I can set up the ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the combined gas law in terms of the ratio of the two states. So let me write the equations.

For initial state:
P1 V1 / T1 = n1 R T1

Wait, no. Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So for each state, we have:

P1 V1 = n1 R T1

P2 V2 = n2 R T2

If I take the ratio (P1 V1) / (n1 T1) = (P2 V2)/(n2 T2), that gives a relation between the initial and final states.

So the ratio P1 V1/(n1 T1) = P2 V2/(n2 T2)

Wait, that's a way to model it. So solving for P2:

P2 = (P1 V1 n2 T2) / (n1 T1 V2 )

Wait, but in our problem, I think the problem is considering the same gas. Because the amount of gas is given as 4.90 g initially and 6.00 g in the second container. So n2 is 6.00 g, and n1 is 4.90 g.

Wait, but the problem says "the gas is confined in a container"—does that imply the same container, so n remains the same? Or does it not? Because the problem says "the gas is confined in a container" in the initial state, and then the amount changes in the second state.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

"A 5000-cm³ container holds 4.90 gm of a gas when the pressure is 75.0 cm Hg and the temperature is 50°C. What will be the pressure if 6.00 gm of this gas is confined in a 2000-cm³ container at 0°C?"

Wait, so in the initial state, the container has 4.90 grams. Then, in the second state, the same container would hold 6.00 grams? Or is the container changed?

Wait, no—it's a different container, but the same gas? Or a new container that's different. Wait, no, the problem says "a gas when the pressure is 75.0 cm Hg"—so perhaps it's the same gas, and the container has a different volume and temperature.

Wait, the problem states, "if 6.00 gm of this gas is confined in a 2000-cm³ container at 0°C." So it's a different container, so n remains the same as the initial state? No, wait. Wait, the initial container holds 4.90 g. The new container holds 6.00 g. But if it's the same gas, then n changes. Or perhaps the same gas but different quantity.

Wait, but the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again: "the gas is confined in a 2000-cm³ container at 0°C." So, the container is 2000 cm³, and contains 6.00 grams of this gas at 0°C. So n would be 6.00 g, but the initial had 4.90 g. So in the initial state, n1 =4.90 g, and in the final state, n2=6.00 g.

Wait, but wait. Since the problem is all about the same gas, the amount of gas is changing. So that would mean that the process is not isothermal, because n is changing. Hmm. But I'm not sure. Maybe they meant that the same amount of gas is present in a new container. Hmm, possibly I should proceed with the assumption that it's the same gas, so n2 is 6.00 g.

Wait, let me proceed with that assumption. So n2 =6.00 g, n1=4.90 g.

So, the ratio is (P1 V1) / (n1 T1) = (P2 V2) / (n2 T2) → because each state satisfies PV =nRT (so P V =n R T).

So solving for P2:

P2 = (P1 V1 n2 T2) / (n1 T1 V2 )

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

P1 is 75.0 cm Hg.

V1 is 5000 cm³ =5 L.

n1 is 4.90 g.

T1 is 50°C = 323.15 K.

n2 is 6.00 g.

T2 is 0°C = 273.15 K.

V2 is 2000 cm³ = 2 L.

Let me compute each component step by step.

Compute numerator: P1 * V1 * n2 * T2 = 75.0 * 5 * 6.00 * 273.15.

Wait, wait, no, the formula is (P1 * V1) / (T1) = (P2 * V2) / (T2) → P2 = (P1 * V1 * n2 * T2) / (n1 * T1 * V2 )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers numerically.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each part step by step.

Compute P1 * V1: 75 *5 = 375.

Compute n2 * T2: 6.00 *273.15 = 1638.9.

Compute n1 * T1:4.90 *323.15 ≈ 4.9 *323.15.

Let me calculate that: 323.15 *4.9. Let's compute 323 *4 = 1292, 323 *0.9 = 290.7, so 1292 + 290.7 = 1582.7. Plus 0.15 *4.9: 0.735 → 1582.7+0.735=1583.435.

Wait, wait, 4.9 * 323.15 → 4.9 * 300=1470, 4.9 *23.15=113.235 → sum is 1470+113.235=1583.235.

So n1*T1 is approximately 1583.235.

So the denominator for P2 is n1*T1 * V2 → 1583.235 *2 = 3166.47.

The numerator is P1 * V1 *n2 * T2 → 75 *5 = 375; 6 *273.15=1638.9. 375 *1638.9 → Let me compute 375 *1600=600,000; 375 *38.9 = approx 14,617.5. So total is 614,617.5.

So P2 = numerator / denominator → 614617.5 / 3166.47 → Let's compute that.

Hmm, 3166.47 * 190 ≈ 611,429 (since 3166 * 200 =633,200, so 3166 *190= 3166*(200-10)= 633,200 - 31,660 = 601,540. Hmm but 190 *3166 is 601,540.

Wait, 190 *3166.47 = let's compute 3166 *190 = 601,540; 0.47 *190=89.3 → total 601,540 +89.3=601,629.3. Our numerator is 614,617.5, so the 190 gives 601,629.3, and we have 614,617.5 -601,629.3 =12,988.2 left.

So how much more? 12,988.2 /3166.47 ≈4.42.

So total is approximately 194.42 cm Hg.

Looking at the options, option C is 194 cm Hg, which is close to our calculation. So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law, which relates pressure, volume, and temperature for a gas undergoing a state change:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Step 1: List the given data
- **Initial state**:
  - Volume, \( V_1 = 5000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 5 \, \text{L} \)
  - Temperature, \( T_1 = 50^\circ \text{C} = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 \, \text{K} \)
  - Pressure, \( P_1 = 75.0 \, \text{cm Hg} \)
  - Amount of gas, \( n_1 = 4.90 \, \text{g} \)
- **Final state**:
  - Volume, \( V_2 = 2000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2 \, \text{L} \)
  - Temperature, \( T_2 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 0 + 273.15 = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)
  - Amount of gas, \( n_2 = 6.00 \, \text{g} \)

### Step 2: Rearrange the combined gas law to solve for \( P_2 \)
\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 n_2 T_2}{n_1 T_1 V_2}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the values into the equation
- Numerator: \( P_1 V_1 n_2 T_2 = 75.0 \times 5 \times 6.00 \times 273.15 \)
- Denominator: \( n_1 T_1 V_2 = 4.90 \times 323.15 \times 2 \)

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
75.0 \times 5 = 375, \quad 6.00 \times 273.15 = 1638.9, \quad 375 \times 1638.9 = 614,617.5
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
4.90 \times 323.15 = 1583.235, \quad 1583.235 \times 2 = 3166.47
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
P_2 = \frac{614,617.5}{3166.47} \approx 194.42 \, \text{cm Hg}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated pressure is approximately \( 194.42 \, \text{cm Hg} \), which matches option **C: 194 cm Hg**.
