Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the angle of twist in a shaft. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question says: A power of 30 horsepower at 150 rpm is available on a distribution line shaft of 2.5 inches diameter. Two pulleys are 18 inches apart, causing torsional deflection. We need to find the angle of twist, given the shear modulus is 11e6 psi. The options are A to J, with various degrees.

Hmm, I remember that calculating the angle of twist involves some mechanical engineering formulas. Let me think about the relevant equation. Oh right, for torsion in a circular shaft, the angle of twist (theta) is given by the formula:

theta = (T * L) / (G * J)

Where:
- T is the torque,
- L is the length of the shaft (or the distance between the pulleys here),
- G is the shear modulus,
- J is the polar moment of inertia.

But wait, I need to find T first. The power available is given as 30 horsepower at 150 rpm. Oh, right, power in a rotating system is torque times angular velocity. Oh wait, since the units are horsepower and rpm, I should convert everything to SI units or to consistent units.

Wait, but maybe I can use the formula P = T * ω, where P is power, T is torque, and ω is angular velocity in radians per second.

No, wait, but horsepower is a unit of power. So I need to convert horsepower to watts and rpm to radians per second.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Convert 30 horsepower to watts.
2. Convert 150 rpm to radians per second.
3. Calculate torque T using the power equation.
4. Find the polar moment of inertia J for a solid shaft.
5. Plug everything into the twist formula.

Alright, step 1: 1 horsepower is 746 watts. So 30 hp = 30 * 746 = 22380 watts.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, torque is the power divided by angular velocity. So ω is in radians per second, so P (power) is in watts.

So, T = P / ω.

First, converting rpm to angular velocity in rad/s.

150 rpm. One revolution is 2π radians. So 150 rpm is (150 * 2π) / 60 = (150 * π)/30 = 5π radians per second.

So ω = 5π rad/s.

Now, T = P / ω = 22380 / (5π).

Let me compute that. 22380 divided by 5 is 4476. So 4476 / π. π is approximately 3.1416, so 4476 / 3.1416 ≈ 1422 N·m.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 30 hp converted to watts: 30 * 745.7 = 22371 W approx. So 22371 / (5π) = ?

Let me compute 22371 divided by 5. That's 4474.2. Divide by π (3.14159) → 4474.2 / 3.14159 ≈ 1422. So T ≈1422 N·m. Hmm, that's a lot of torque. But okay, perhaps that's correct.

Moving on. Step 2: J for a solid circular shaft is (π d^4) / 32, where d is the diameter.

Wait, the diameter is 2.5 inches. So d = 2.5 inches.

So J = π (2.5)^4 / 32.

Let me compute that. (2.5)^4 is (2.5)^2 squared. 2.5^2 is 6.25. Squared again is 39.0625. So 39.0625 * π is about 39.0625 * 3.1416 ≈ 122.689. Divided by 32: 122.689 /32 ≈ 3.834 square inches^4.

Wait, J in inch-pounds? Or is it in cubic inches? Wait, torque is usually in lb-ft, but J is in in^4. Hmm, but I think in the formula, G is in psi, which is pounds per square inch (psi), which is force per area.

Wait, the formula for J is in in^4. So J is 3.834 in^4.

Wait, but wait: the formula for J is (π d^4) / 32. So, let me compute it again.

d = 2.5 inches.

d^4 = (2.5)^4 = (2.5)^2 * (2.5)^2 = 6.25 * 6.25 = 39.0625.

So, J = (3.1416 * 39.0625) / 32.

3.1416 * 39.0625 ≈ 122.689.

Divide by 32: 122.689 /32 ≈ 3.834 in^4.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, step 4: plug into the formula theta = (T * L) / (G * J).

Variables:

T = 1422 N·m.

L = 18 inches. Wait, but units for G are in psi, which is force per area (lb/in²). Wait, but T is in N·m (which is kg m²/s²), and G is in psi (lb/in²). So units need to be compatible.

Wait, perhaps I should convert everything to consistent units.

Maybe it's easier to work in consistent units. Let's convert all to SI units.

So, let me think:

- T is 1422 N·m.

- L is 18 inches. 1 inch = 0.0254 m, so 18 inches = 18 * 0.0254 = 0.4572 m.

- G is 11e6 psi. 1 psi is (1 lbf)/(1 in²). 1 lbf is 4.44822 N. So 1 psi = 4.44822 N/(0.00064516 m²) ≈ using the conversion factors.

Wait, perhaps easier to convert G to N/m² (Pascals).

1 psi = 6894.76 Pa.

So G = 11e6 psi = 11e6 * 6894.76 Pa.

Let me compute that: 11e6 * 6894.76 ≈ 75,842,360,000 Pa. Wait, 6.89476e3 *1e6 is 6.89476e9? No, wait, 11e6 is 1.1e7, times 6.89476e3 is 7.584e10? Wait:

Wait, 11e6 * 6894.76 = 11 * 6.89476e3 * 1e6 = 75.84236e9? Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate it as 11 * 6894.76 = 75842.36, and then 75842.36e9 Pa.

Wait, 1 psi is 6894.76 Pa. So 11e6 psi is 11e6 * 6894.76 Pa.

11e6 * 6894.76 = 11 * 6,894,760,000 = 75,842,360,000 Pa. So G = 7.584236e10 Pa.

Now, J is 3.834 in^4. 1 in² = (0.0254 m)^2 = 0.00064516 m². So 1 in^4 = (0.00064516 m)^4 ≈ (6.4516e-4)^4.

Let me compute that.

(6.4516e-4)⁴ = (6.4516^4) * (1e-4)^4 = (6.4516)^4 * 1e-16.

6.4516^2 is approximately 41.62. Then 41.62^2 is about 1732. So 1732 * 1e-16 = 1.732e-13 m^4.

So J in m^4 is 3.834 * 1.732e-13 = 6.634e-13 m^4.

Hmm, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using exact conversions.

Wait, J = (π d^4) / 32.

d is 2.5 inches, so in meters, 2.5 inches is 0.0635 meters (since 1 inch = 0.0254 m; 2.5 * 0.0254 = 0.0635 m).

So d = 0.0635 m.

J = (π * (0.0635)^4) /32.

Calculate (0.0635)^4.

0.0635^2 = approx 0.00403225. Then squared again: 0.00403225^2 ≈ 1.626e-5. Multiply by π: 1.626e-5 * 3.1416 ≈ 5.098e-5.

Divide by 32: 5.098e-5 / 32 ≈ 1.593e-6 m^4.

So J ≈ 1.593e-6 m^4.

Now, let's plug into the angle of twist formula:

theta = (T * L) / (G * J)

We have T = 1422 N·m, L = 0.4572 m, G ≈7.584236e10 Pa, J≈1.593e-6 m^4.

So numerator is 1422 * 0.4572 ≈ let me compute:

1422 * 0.4572:

= 1422 * 0.4 = 568.8

1422 * 0.05 = 71.1

1422 * 0.0072 = 10.2384

Adding up: 568.8 +71.1=639.9 +10.2384=650.1384.

So numerator ≈650.1384 N·m².

Denominator: G * J = 7.584236e10 * 1.593e-6.

Multiply 7.584236e10 by 1.593e-6:

7.584236 * 1.593 ≈ 7.584 * 1.593 ≈ let's compute 7 *1.593=11.151; 0.584 *1.593≈0.930. So total ≈12.081.

Then multiply by 1e10 * 1e-6=1e4. So denominator is 12.081e4 = 120,810.

So theta ≈650.1384 / 120,810 ≈ let's compute that.

650 / 120,810 ≈0.00539 radians.

Now, convert radians to degrees: 1 rad ≈57.2958 degrees. So 0.00539 radians *57.2958 ≈0.309 degrees.

Wait, but our options are in increments of 0.1, so 0.3 degrees is among the options. Looking at the options, option B is 0.31 degrees. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

Wait, let's go back to the angle formula:

theta = (T * L) / (G * J)

Wait, Check the units:

T is in N·m.

L is in meters.

G is in Pa (N/m²).

J is m^4.

So N·m * m = N·m².

Pa * m^4 = (N/m²) * m^4 = N·m². So denominator is correct.

So units are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Let me recompute the numerator:

T =1422 N·m.

L=0.4572 m.

So T * L = 1422 * 0.4572.

Let me compute 1422 * 0.4572.

Compute 1422 * 0.4 = 568.8.

1422 * 0.05 = 71.1.

1422 * 0.0072= 10.2384.

Adding: 568.8 +71.1=639.9; 639.9 +10.2384=650.1384 N·m².

Denominator: G=7.584236e10 Pa, J=1.593e-6 m^4.

So G*J=7.584236e10 *1.593e-6.

Multiply 7.584236e10 *1.593e-6 =7.584236 *1.593 *1e4.

7.584236 *1.593 = let me compute precisely.

7 *1.593=11.151.

0.584236 *1.593:

0.5 *1.593=0.7965

0.084236 *1.593≈0.1352.

So 0.7965 +0.1352≈0.9317.

Total 11.151 +0.9317≈12.0827.

So 12.0827e4 =120827.

So denominator is 120827.

theta = 650.1384 / 120827 ≈ 0.005386 radians.

Convert to degrees: 0.005386 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.309 degrees.

So approximately 0.31 degrees. Looking at the options, option B is 0.31 degrees.

But wait, wait a second. Did I make any mistakes in the calculation steps?

Wait, perhaps in the J calculation. Let me check J again.

J is (π d^4)/32.

d is 2.5 inches, so 2.5 inches = 0.0635 meters.

d^4 = (0.0635)^4.

0.0635^2 = 0.00403225.

Square again: 0.00403225^2 = (approx) 0.00001626.

Multiply by π: 0.00001626 *3.1416≈0.00005108.

Divide by 32: 0.00005108 /32≈1.596e-6 m^4.

So J ≈1.596e-6 m^4.

So J is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate T again.

T = P / ω.

P is 30 hp. 30 * 745.7 = 22371 W.

ω is 150 rpm → 150 * 2π /60 = 5π rad/s.

So T=22371 / (5π) ≈22371/(15.70796) ≈1422. So that's correct.

So all the steps seem correct, and the calculation ends up with approximately 0.31 degrees, which is option B.

To calculate the angle of twist (θ) in the shaft, we use the formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{T \cdot L}{G \cdot J}
\]

Where:
- \( T \) is the torque,
- \( L \) is the length of the shaft (or the distance between the pulleys),
- \( G \) is the shear modulus,
- \( J \) is the polar moment of inertia.

### Step 1: Convert Power to Watts
The power is given as 30 horsepower (hp). Converting to watts:
\[
P = 30 \, \text{hp} \times 745.7 \, \text{W/hp} = 22371 \, \text{W}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Torque \( T \)
The angular velocity \( \omega \) is given as 150 rpm. Converting to radians per second:
\[
\omega = \frac{150 \times 2\pi}{60} = 5\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]
Using the formula \( T = \frac{P}{\omega} \):
\[
T = \frac{22371}{5\pi} \approx \frac{22371}{15.70796} \approx 1422 \, \text{N·m}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Polar Moment of Inertia \( J \)
The diameter \( d = 2.5 \, \text{inches} = 0.0635 \, \text{m} \). Using the formula \( J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32} \):
\[
J = \frac{\pi (0.0635)^4}{32} \approx \frac{\pi (0.00001626)}{32} \approx 1.596 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Angle of Twist \( \theta \)
Substituting the values into the formula:
\[
\theta = \frac{1422 \cdot 0.4572}{7.584 \times 10^{10} \cdot 1.596 \times 10^{-6}}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\theta = \frac{650.1384}{120827} \approx 0.005386 \, \text{radians}
\]
Convert radians to degrees:
\[
\theta = 0.005386 \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 0.309^\circ
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
\theta \approx 0.31^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle of twist \( \theta \) is approximately **0.31 degrees**, which corresponds to **Option B**.

ANSWER: 0.31 degrees
