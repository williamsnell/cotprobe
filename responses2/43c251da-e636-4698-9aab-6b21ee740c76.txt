Alright, so I've got this question here about fish tanks, and I need to figure out the total liters of water. Let me take it step by step. Okay, the question says the store has 8 fish tanks, each with 40 liters of water. Hmm, so I need to multiply the number of tanks by the liters per tank to get the total.

Wait, let me think. Each tank has 40 liters, and there are 8 of them. So that's 40 multiplied by 8. Let me do the math. 40 times 8 is 320. So the total liters should be 320.

Now, looking at the options, I see option D is 300 and option I is 320. So I think the correct answer is D, 300? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 40 times 8 is definitely 320. Let me double-check: 40 * 8. 40 times 8 is 320. Yeah, that's right. So option D is 300, which is incorrect. So the correct answer must be D? Or is I the correct one?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me count again. 40 * 8: 40+40 is 80, that's two tanks. Then another 40 each for 6 more tanks, that's 40*6=240. So 80+240=320. So yes, 320 is correct. So looking at the options, D is 300, I is 320. So the correct answer is I: 320. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because sometimes I get mixed up with the multiplication. Oh wait, maybe I should just confirm. 40 liters per tank, 8 tanks: 40 * 8. 40 times 8 is 320. So the total is 320 liters. So the answer is D? Or is it I? No, wait, I thought I was correct earlier.

Wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because 40*8 is 320, which is option I? Wait, looking back at the options: A is 400, B is 380, C is 280, D is 300, E is 360, F is 340, G is 5, H is 420, I is 320, J is 48. So D is 300, I is 320. So yes, the correct answer is I: 320.

Wait, but earlier I thought I was wrong because I thought 40*8 might be 320, which is option I. So the correct answer is I: 320. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the options. Let me make sure I didn't read the options wrong. Oh wait, no, the options are A to J. So I think the answer is I: 320. So the correct option is I.

The total liters of water in all fish tanks is calculated by multiplying the number of tanks (8) by the liters per tank (40), which equals 320. Looking at the options, the correct answer is I: 320.

Answer: I
