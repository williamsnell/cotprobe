Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the payment for an invoice. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem says the Jones House Furnishings Store bought some articles from Howard Hardware Company. They paid $144.27 after discounts. The invoice has terms (3/10) and (n/60). The question is about how much they'll pay if they pay on August 12 and August 14.

Wait, the invoice date is August 3. So August 3 is the starting point.

The payment terms are (3/10) and (n/60). That means if you pay within 10 days, you get a 3% discount. If you pay after 10 days but within 60 days, no discount (n/60). So the net discount is 3%, and no discount beyond that.

Now, part (a): payment on August 12. Let's see how many days are between August 3 and August 12. August has 31 days, so from August 3 to August 12 is 9 days. Because August 3 to August 4 is 1 day, so August 3 is day 0. So August 12 is 9 days later.

Wait, no. Wait, let me count it again. August 3 is the purchase date. So August 12 is 9 days after August 3. Because August 3 is day 0. So August 4 is day 1, so August 12 is day 9. Because 3 to 12 is 9 days.

Wait, maybe another way: the number of days is (12 - 3) = 9 days. Since August 3 is the starting date, August 12 is 9 days later. So that's 9 days, which is less than 10 days. So they qualify for the 3% discount.

So the net price after discounts is $144.27. So for part (a), they pay within 10 days, so 3% discount.

So the discount is 3% of 144.27. Let's calculate that. 144.27 * 0.03 = 4.3281. So subtract that from 144.27: 144.27 - 4.3281 = 139.9419, which rounds to $139.94.

So for part (a), the payment is $139.94.

Now part (b): payment on August 14. August 14 is how many days after August 3? Let's see: August 3 to August 14 is 11 days (3 to 4 is 1, 4 to 5 is 2, ..., 14 is 11 days after 3). Since 11 is more than 10 but less than 60, so they don't get the 3% discount. So they have to pay the net price as is, which is $144.27.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. August 3 is the date. August 14 is 11 days later. So the discount period is 3/10, so 10 days. So 11 days is beyond that. So no discount. Therefore, part (b) is $144.27.

Now looking at the options:

Option I is $139.94 and $144.27. That's a match for (a) and (b). Let me check the options.

Options are given from A to J. Let me look:

Option I: $139.94 and $144.27.

Wait, let me look again. The options:

A: 140.27 and 144.27

B: 140.27 and 145.94

C: 134.94 and 144.27

D: 139.94 and 145.94

E: 134.94 and 139.94

F: 134.94 and 140.27

G: 144.27 and 144.27

H: 144.27 and 149.94

I: 139.94 and 144.27

J: 139.94 and 140.27

So option I is $139.94 and $144.27, which matches our calculations for parts (a) and (b).

Wait, but hold on. Another way to calculate is perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me double-check the terms again. The terms are (3/10, n/60). Does that mean that the first discount is 3%, and no discount beyond that, so n/60 is another 60-day period. So if you pay within 60 days, you don't get the second discount. Wait, no, the terms are (3/10, n/60). So 3% is a 3% discount for 10 days, and no discount for 60 days. So if you pay within 10 days, you get 3% off. If you pay within 60 days, you don't get the second discount. Wait, but the way the terms are written, maybe it's that the first discount is 3% if paid within 10 days, and the second is no discount beyond that. So for example, if you pay on day 10, you get 3% discount. Any payment after that but before 60 days, you don't get the second discount.

Wait, but the term is (3/10, n/60). So this is a common way of expressing discounts. So the first discount is 3% if paid within 10 days. If not, the next discount is no, and it's net 60 days. So the order is: if you pay within 10 days, take 3%. If not, the net is due in 60 days.

Wait, but in our case, the net price is $144.27, and the discount terms are (3/10, n/60). So if you pay within 10 days, you get 3% off. So August 3 to August 12 is 9 days, which is within 10, so 3% discount.

So part (a) is 3% off, $144.27 - 4.3281 = $139.94.

Part (b): August 14 is 11 days after August 3, which is more than 10 days but less than 60. So you don't get the 3% discount. So you have to pay the net price as is, which is $144.27.

So the correct options are I: (a) $139.94, (b) $144.27.

Looking again at the options, option I is the one that matches. So the correct answer is option I.

The correct answer is option I: $139.94 and $144.27.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The invoice amount is $144.27 after discounts of 8% and 5%.
   - Payment terms: (3/10, n/60).
   - Calculate the payment for August 12 (within 10 days) and August 14 (not within 10 days).

2. **Calculations for August 12 (3% Discount):**
   - 3% of $144.27 = $4.3281.
   - Net amount = $144.27 - $4.3281 = $139.94.

3. **Calculations for August 14 (No Discount):**
   - Payment is due in 11 days after August 3, so no 3% discount.
   - Net amount remains $144.27.

4. **Matching with Options:**
   - Option I provides $139.94 and $144.27 for the two dates.
