Okay, so I need to figure out what a command economy is. I'm a bit new to economics, but I remember hearing about different types of economies. A command economy sounds a bit like a government running the economy, so maybe it's controlled by a central authority. Let me break this down.

From what I recall, traditional economies are market-based, where people make decisions based on supply and demand. But a command economy is different. It's probably where the state or government has a lot of control. I think in a command economy, the government or a central authority makes a lot of decisions that affect how resources are allocated.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option F says the resources are allocated based on the commands of a central planning authority. That sounds right because command economies are about central planning. The government decides what to produce, how much, and for whom.

Option B says it's based on market demand. That's more like a market economy. Command economies are different; they're not driven by private markets.

Option A mentions a voting system among citizens. That's more like a socialist system, so that's probably not command.

Option C says the government controls key industries, others are market-driven. That's a mix, but not the whole command model.

Option E talks about even distribution, which is common in command economies. But the main point is the central authority.

Option G is about tradition and cultural practices. That's more like an agrarian economy, not necessarily command.

Option I says prices and production levels are determined by non-profits. I'm not sure, but I don't think that's a defining feature of command economies.

Option J is about competition among private companies. That's more about a market economy, not command.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. The command economy is one where the central authority makes decisions to allocate resources. Option F aligns with that.

The answer is F: A Command Economy is one where resources are allocated based on the commands of a central planning authority. This is because command economies are governed by a central authority, unlike market economies where private forces operate.
