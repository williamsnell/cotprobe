Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this businessman should buy the machine. Let's break down the problem step by step. 

The machine costs $35,000. It's expected to return $10,000 per year for 4 years. I need to consider the two interest rates given: 8% and 2%. The question is whether he should buy it based on these rates.

First, I think about what "net of operating costs" means. It probably means that the business can recover the cost of the machine by the returns, and the operating costs are already factored into the $10,000 figure. So the $10,000 is the net cash flow each year. 

I remember that when evaluating investments, the Net Present Value (NPV) is a good indicator. NPV tells us if the investment's return exceeds the cost of capital. If the NPV is positive, it's a good investment; if negative, it's not.

So, I'll calculate the NPV for both interest rates. The formula for NPV when there are equal annual cash flows is:

NPV = -Initial Investment + (Cash Flow / (1 + r))^n

Where r is the interest rate and n is the number of years. 

Let's compute this for both rates.

First, 8% interest.

Each year, the net cash flow is $10,000. So for each year:

Year 1: 10,000 / 1.08
Year 2: 10,000 / (1.08)^2
Year 3: 10,000 / (1.08)^3
Year 4: 10,000 / (1.08)^4

Adding all these up and subtracting the initial cost ($35,000) will give the NPV.

Alternatively, I can use the present value of an annuity formula for an immediate annuity. The formula is:

PVIFA(r, n) = [1 - 1/(1 + r)^n] / r

So for 8%:

PVIFA(8%,4) = [1 - 1/(1.08)^4]/0.08

Calculating that:

(1.08)^4 is about 1.3605. So 1/1.3605 is approximately 0.735.

1 - 0.735 = 0.265

Divide by 0.08: 0.265 / 0.08 ≈ 3.3125

So PVIFA is about 3.3125. Multiply that by $10,000: 3.3125 * 10,000 = $33,125

Subtract initial cost: 33,125 - 35,000 = -1,875.

So at 8%, the NPV is negative. That means the investment isn't profitable at that rate. So he shouldn't buy it at 8%.

What about 2% interest?

Same PVIFA approach. Let's compute:

PVIFA(2%,4) = [1 - 1/(1.02)^4]/0.02

(1.02)^4 is about 1.0824.

1/1.0824 ≈ 0.9233.

1 - 0.9233 = 0.0767.

Divide by 0.02: 0.0767 / 0.02 = 3.835.

Multiply by $10,000: 38.35 * 10,000 = $383,500.

Wait, wait, no: 3.835 * 10,000 is 38,350.

Wait, no, PVIFA is 3.835, so 3.835 * $10,000 = $38,350.

Subtract initial cost of $35,000: 38,350 - 35,000 = +3,350.

So NPV is positive at 2%. That means the investment would be profitable if the interest rate is 2%. Therefore, he should buy the machine at 2% interest.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B says buy at 8% but don't at 2%. That's correct because at 8% NPV is negative, so he shouldn't buy; at 2%, it's positive, so he should. 

Option B is correct. Looking at the options, the choices are about whether he should buy at each rate. So the correct choice is B.

To determine whether the businessman should buy the machine, we calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) at both interest rates, 8% and 2%, using the present value of an annuity formula. 

**At 8% interest:**
- The formula for NPV is:
  \[
  \text{NPV} = -\text{Initial Investment} + \text{Cash Flow} \times \text{PVIFA}(r, n)
  \]
- PVIFA(8%, 4) is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{PVIFA} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}}{r} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1.08)^4}}{0.08} \approx 3.3125
  \]
- The present value of the cash flows is:
  \[
  10,000 \times 3.3125 = 33,125
  \]
- Subtracting the initial investment:
  \[
  \text{NPV} = 33,125 - 35,000 = -1,875
  \]
- Since NPV is negative, the investment is not profitable at 8% interest. The businessman should **not** buy the machine at 8%.

**At 2% interest:**
- PVIFA(2%, 4) is:
  \[
  \text{PVIFA} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1.02)^4}}{0.02} \approx 3.835
  \]
- The present value of the cash flows is:
  \[
  10,000 \times 3.835 = 38,350
  \]
- Subtracting the initial investment:
  \[
  \text{NPV} = 38,350 - 35,000 = +3,350
  \]
- Since NPV is positive, the investment is profitable at 2% interest. The businessman **should** buy the machine at 2%.

**Conclusion:** The businessman should buy the machine at 2% interest but should not buy it at 8% interest. 

**Correct Answer: B**
