Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Milgram's study and Zimbardo's concept. Let me break it down.

The question says that in Milgram's study, participants were more willing to administer electric shocks when they couldn't see the victim and vice versa. The question is about what Zimbardo's notion is predicted by this finding. The options are various social psychological concepts.

First, I need to remember what Zimbardo's concept is. From what I recall, Zimbardo proposed something called "cognitive dissonance." But wait, the question is about a different phenomenon, so maybe it's not directly about dissonance but more about psychological reactions.

Wait, Milgram's experiment was about social learning and obedience. The scenario is about participants not seeing their victims, leading to more cooperation. But the question is about Zimbardo's notion. So I should think about what Zimbardo's work covers.

Zimbardo's work includes things like cognitive dissonance, psychological reactions, and groupthink. Oh right, psychological reactance. Wait, psychological reactance is when the presence of a situation causes an individual to change their behavior, leading to negative reactions. So in the study, when participants couldn't see the victim, they felt a psychological pressure to administer shocks because they were seeing their own disadvantage. That's psychological pressure, which is part of psychological reactance.

Alternatively, I remember that "cognitive dissonance" involves the feeling of inconsistency, but psychological reactance is more about the body's response to the situation, like fear or anxiety, leading to a change in behavior.

So looking back at the options, option C is "psychological reactance." That seems to fit. Option B is "conformity," which might relate to social pressure, but not specifically to the scenario described. Option A is the bystander effect, which is about others noticing and helping, but that's more about cooperation in general. Option H is "social facilitation," which is when people perform better under certain conditions, like stress, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, another angle: the term "cognitive dissonance" in Milgram's study might indicate that people are facing a cognitive conflict. But the question is about Zimbardo's concept. So maybe it's psychological reactance, which is about the psychological pressure someone feels.

So the correct answer should be C: psychological reactance. Because when participants couldn't see each other, they felt the pressure to take action, which is psychological reactance.

The correct answer is C: psychological reactance.

**Explanation:** Zimbardo's concept of psychological reactance explains how the presence of a situation can cause individuals to change their behavior, leading to negative reactions. In Milgram's study, participants' inability to see each other caused them to feel a psychological pressure to administer shocks, demonstrating psychological reactance.

Answer: C
