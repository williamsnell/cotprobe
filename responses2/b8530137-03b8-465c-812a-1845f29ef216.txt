Okay, so I have this question about Verity Co.'s cash flows and the statement of cash flows. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

So Verity bought some bonds and Treasury bills. The details are: $200,000 of Otra Co. bonds at par, which are classified as available-for-sale. And $50,000 of U.S. Treasury bills, which are classified as cash equivalents.

The question is about what amount Verity should report as net cash used in investing activities in its statement of cash flows. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on cash flows and financial statements, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that in the statement of cash flows, investing activities are usually broken down into sections. I think the main sections are: Investing Activities (which includes purchases and sales of securities), Capital Expenditures, and Other Investing Activities. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Wait, but in this case, the key point is whether the investments are classified as cash equivalents or not. Cash equivalents are typically short-term and highly liquid, like Treasury bills. I think cash equivalents are considered as investments that are held to be used to meet a short-term cash need, so they're reported in the investing activities section, but maybe not as a separate line item since they're so liquid.

So the Otra Co. bonds were purchased at par. Since they're available-for-sale, that means they're part of the investment portfolio, but not held for speculative purposes. So in the investing activities section, they would be reported as a cash outflow because they're being purchased.

But wait, the question is about the net cash used in investing activities. The term 'used' here probably refers to the cash outflow. So if Verity bought the bonds, that's a cash outflow. But wait, the Treasury bills are cash equivalents. Since they're cash equivalents, are they considered as investments or as something else?

Wait, cash equivalents are held to be used for short-term purposes, so they should be reported in the investing activities as part of the investment in short-term assets. So in the statement of cash flows, they are part of the investing activities section, but since they're short-term and liquid, maybe the amount is treated as part of the investing activities, but perhaps the amount isn't considered as a cash outflow? Or is it?

Wait, no. cash equivalents are considered as part of the investment, but because they're liquid, they're reported in the investing activities as a source of funds, not as a cash outflow. Because the company isn't spending cash on them, but rather using their cash on hand. So, the actual cash outflow is the purchase price, but the investment is recorded as a use of cash.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

When a company purchases a security, it's a cash outflow. But if the security is classified as a cash equivalent, does that affect how it's reported? Or is the purchase still a cash outflow.

Wait, in the cash flow statement, the transaction of purchasing a bond would be an investing activity. Specifically, if it's an available-for-sale security, the company would report it as a cash outflow. However, the amount is part of the investment, so perhaps it's classified as an investing activity but not as a cash outflow because it's for speculative purposes.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Available-for-sale securities are considered part of the company's investments. So when the company buys them, it's a cash outflow, as it's spending cash to invest. So that would be net cash used in investing activities.

But wait, cash equivalents are a type of investment. So the purchase of a cash equivalent would still be a cash outflow. Why? Because the company is purchasing an asset (the Treasury bill), which is used to meet a short-term cash need.

But in the cash flow statement, the section for investing activities includes both regular investments and cash equivalents. So the purchase of the Otra bonds, which are available-for-sale, is a cash outflow, and the purchase of the Treasury bills, as cash equivalents, is also a cash outflow.

Wait, but wait a second. I think cash equivalents are always reported as a source of cash, not as a use. Because they're liquid assets that the company uses to meet short-term obligations. So their purchase doesn't require the company to cash out, but rather use its existing cash. So in the cash flow statement, they are presented as investments but as a use of cash.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about how the cash flow sections are structured.

The statement of cash flows has three main sections: operating, investing, and financing. Each has sub-sections.

Investing activities include the purchase and sale of property, plant, and equipment; the purchase and sale of marketable securities (like stocks, futures, options, and options on futures contracts), and the purchase and sale of available-for-sale securities.

Cash equivalents are a subset of marketable securities. So when Verity buys a cash equivalent (the Treasury bill), that's part of the investing activities.

In the cash flow statement, an investment in cash equivalents would be reported as a cash outflow, but actually, since they're liquid, the company isn't using cash; it's simply using its existing cash. So this is a source of cash, but it's a short-term investment.

Wait, but the question is about how much is reported as net cash used in investing activities. So the amount of cash the company spent on these investments.

Wait, but the Otra bonds are available-for-sale, so when the company buys them, that's a cash outflow. For the Treasury bills, since they're cash equivalents, they are also a cash outflow. So the total would be $200k + $50k = $250k.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the classification.

Available-for-sale securities are considered part of the company's investments, and when they are purchased, it's a cash outflow. Similarly, cash equivalents are also investments, but since they're short-term and liquid, they are reported as part of cash equivalents, but in the investing activities section.

Wait, but in the statement of cash flows, do cash equivalents count as investing activities? Yes, because they're part of the investment in marketable securities. For example, if the company has cash equivalents like cash, that's part of their cash, and these are considered investments.

But wait, when you purchase a cash equivalent, the company is using cash, so it's a source of cash. So in the investing activities section, it would be reported as a cash outflow because the company is spending cash to purchase these assets. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I've heard that cash equivalents are treated differently.

Wait, maybe I should think about the accounting treatment. The purchase of a cash equivalent is a cash outflow because the company is using its cash to buy the asset. So that would be a cash outflow in investing activities.

But then, the Treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents, so when Verity purchased $50,000 of them, that's a cash outflow of $50,000. The Otra bonds, though, are available-for-sale, so the purchase would be a cash outflow of $200,000.

So in the statement of cash flows under investing activities, both would be listed as cash outflows. So the total would be $250,000. But looking at the options, option A is $250,000, option H is $250000 (assuming the options are in thousands). So option A would be $250k.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question is about net cash used in investing activities.

Wait, no. Wait, the statement of cash flows for investing activities includes both types of investments. But the net cash used would be the total cash outflow. So if Otra's bonds were purchased, that's $200,000 as a cash outflow. The Treasury bills are $50,000 as a cash outflow. So the total investment is $250,000.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Because the Otra bonds are available-for-sale, which might not be held for long-term speculative purposes. So is the purchase of these bonds considered part of the investment in cash equivalents or available-for-sale?

Wait, the classification doesn't affect how it's reported in the cash flow statement. Whether they're available-for-sale or cash equivalents, the company would record the purchase as a cash outflow in investing activities.

So the total investment would be $250k. So the net cash used would be the sum, so option A, which is $250k.

Wait, but the question is about net cash used in investing activities. Does that mean that the company is using cash in the investments?

Wait, no. Because the company is investing in Otra Co. bonds, which are available-for-sale, and Treasury bills, which are cash equivalents. But the cash outflow is for purchasing both.

Wait, but perhaps the Treasury bill purchase is considered a cash equivalent and thus when you buy them, it's a short-term investment. So the amount spent is $50k, which is part of the investment, but since it's a cash equivalent, it's treated as a use of cash. So the total would be $250k. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The cash outflow is what's spent, regardless of whether it's a cash equivalent. Because the purchase includes the cash being used. So the total is $250k.

Wait, but I've heard that for cash equivalents, the cash outflow is not part of the cash used but is an investment in short-term assets. So in the statement of cash flows, the investment would be listed as a source of cash, not a use.

Wait, but the question is about net cash used in investing activities. So that would be the amount of cash used, not the cash generated from the investment.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: available-for-sale securities are considered part of the investment, and their purchase is a cash outflow, so it's a cash used in investing. Similarly, cash equivalents are part of the investment, but since it's a short-term asset, the company is using cash, so that's a cash used in investing. So both would be subtracted or added.

Wait, no. In the cash flow statement, the transaction of purchasing a security would be a cash outflow, regardless of its type. Because the company is spending cash to invest. So the Otra bonds would be $200k spent, the Treasury $50k, so total of $250k. So the answer would be A: $250,000.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 250,000. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: in the statement of cash flows, the investing activities section would show the cash outflows for both the Otra bonds and the Treasury bills. So the total would be $250k.

Alternatively, perhaps only the cash equivalents are considered as a part of cash used in investing. Wait, no. Because the cash used in investing is about the cash used to purchase the investment, regardless of whether it's a short-term asset.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that both the Otra bonds and the Treasury bill are considered as cash used in investing. So the total is $250k.

So the answer is A: $250,000.

Wait, but another angle: available-for-sale are considered as investments, and so are cash equivalents. So the total would be $250k. So the answer would be H: 250000.

But wait, I'm getting myself stuck. Let me think again.

In the statement of cash flows, the investing section includes all investments the company makes. So, if the company buys Otra Co. bonds for $200k, that's a cash outflow, and the purchase of the Treasury bills is another $50k. So the total investment is $250k. But since both are cash outflows, the net cash used in investing activities would be $250k. So the answer is A.

Wait, but I might be making a mistake. Some sources say that the purchase of cash equivalents is a use of cash, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because the company isn't spending cash but rather using its existing cash. So the cash outflow is the purchase, not the use.

Wait, no. The cash outflow is when the company spends cash to invest. So the purchase of the Treasury bills is a cash outflow, same as the Otra bonds.

So the total is $250k, which would be the answer A.

Wait, but the options don't have H as 250,000. Wait, the options are:

A: 250,000
H: 250,000.

Wait, looking back, the user's options list A as 250,000, so yes, option A is 250k.

Wait, but the initial question is about net cash used. So the total cash outflow is the amount, which is 250k. So the answer is A.

Wait, but I'm now thinking, maybe the Treasury bill purchase isn't considered as an investment in the statement of cash flows because it's a short-term asset and classified differently. Hmm, no, because investing activities include any purchase of assets, whether short-term or not. So both are included.

Wait, but the actual cash outflow is $250k. So the answer is A: $250,000.

The question asks about the amount Verity Co. should report as net cash used in investing activities in its statement of cash flows. Verity purchased $200,000 of Otra Co. bonds at par, classified as available-for-sale, and $50,000 of Treasury bills, classified as cash equivalents. Both securities are considered investments, and the purchase of each is recorded as a cash outflow in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows. 

Available-for-sale securities, like the Otra Co. bonds, are purchased as investments and are classified in the investing activities section. Treasury bills, being classified as cash equivalents, are also considered investments. The total cash outflow from these purchases is $200,000 (for Otra Co. bonds) + $50,000 (for Treasury bills) = $250,000. 

Since both investments are classified as cash equivalents and are purchased, the total amount spent is reported as net cash used in investing activities. The classification of Treasury bills as cash equivalents does not affect the cash flow reporting; it is still treated as an investment in the investing activities section. 

Thus, the correct answer is **A: $250,000**.
