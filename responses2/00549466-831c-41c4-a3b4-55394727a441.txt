Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about what happens to the consumption function and aggregate demand when the stock market is stronger. 

First, I remember that the consumption function shows the relationship between income and consumption. It's usually expressed as C = C0 + cY, where C0 is autonomous consumption and c is the marginal propensity to consume. So, if the stock market is stronger, people might have more disposable income because their wealth increases. This would lead to an increase in consumption, which means the consumption function would increase. So, the consumption function's consumption increases, which is a positive change.

Next, aggregate demand is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy. Aggregate demand is made up of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Now, if the stock market is stronger, it probably leads to higher corporate profits, which could encourage businesses to invest more. So, investment spending (I) increases. 

But wait, does the stock market directly affect net exports? Well, net exports are exports minus imports. If the stock market is strong, people might invest more in local businesses, which could mean less demand for imported goods from foreign consumers. So, maybe net exports decrease. But this is a bit more complex. 

So, the change in consumption is an increase, but the change in investment is also an increase. However, aggregate demand is the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. If consumption increases, that's a positive, but investment increases as well. So, overall, aggregate demand might increase. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about net exports. If the stock market is strong, does that mean more imports or less? Let me think. A stronger stock market might lead to higher corporate earnings, which could be used for investment. But it might also lead to more investment in local businesses, which would increase domestic demand. But net exports would be exports minus imports. If more domestic investment happens, maybe people are spending more on domestically produced goods, which would increase exports. So, net exports could increase as well.

Wait, no. If the stock market is strong, people might be more inclined to invest in local businesses, which are domestic. So, domestic investment increases, which would increase the aggregate demand (since I is part of AD). But also, if more people are making money from the stock market, maybe they're saving more, so perhaps private investment might go up. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to think about the overall effect. If the stock market is stronger, people have more disposable income, leading to higher consumption (so consumption increases). Also, stronger stocks could mean higher corporate profits, which might lead to increased investment. 

So, both consumption and investment are going up. Since AD includes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports, the increase in consumption and investment would cause AD to increase. So, both the consumption function and aggregate demand would increase. 

Looking at the options:

Option B: Increase, Increase.

Option F: Increase, Decrease.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain about net exports. Let me think again. If the stock market is strong, it might lead to more corporate investments, which could go into domestic industries, increasing aggregate demand. Also, higher corporate profits could lead to more investment. So, both I and C (consumption) would increase. 

Therefore, both the consumption function (which is the same as the consumption side) and aggregate demand (AD) would increase. So the answer should be option B: Increase, Increase.

The correct answer is:

**B: Increase, Increase**

When the stock market is stronger, it leads to an increase in disposable income, prompting higher consumption (represented by the consumption function). Additionally, stronger stocks may encourage more corporate investment, which increases aggregate demand. Thus, both the consumption function and aggregate demand increase. 

Answer:  
B: Increase, Increase
