Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the vibrational frequency of the lowest vibration state for hydrogen gas, H₂. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the vibrational frequency for a diatomic molecule like H₂ can be found using the formula ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/(μ)), where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. Oh wait, right, the reduced mass is important here. For H₂, each atom is hydrogen, so their masses are the same. So the reduced mass μ would be m₁*m₂/(m₁ + m₂). Since both are the same, that simplifies to m/2, where m is the mass of a hydrogen atom.

Wait, what's the mass of a hydrogen atom? I think the atomic mass of hydrogen is about 1.00784 amu. I need to convert that into kilograms. Oh right, 1 amu is approximately 1.66054e-27 kg. So 1.00784 amu would be 1.00784 * 1.66054e-27 kg. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.00784 *1.66054e-27 is approximately 1.6726e-27 kg. So the reduced mass μ is (1.6726e-27 kg) / 2 = 8.363e-28 kg.

Next, the spring constant k is given as 5.1 N/cm. Wait, I should convert that into SI units. Since 1 N/m is the same as 100 N/cm. So 5.1 N/cm is 510 N/m.

Now, putting it into the frequency formula. ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ). Let's compute k/μ first. So 510 N/m divided by 8.363e-28 kg. Hmm, that would be 510 / 8.363e-28 ≈ 6.08e29 m^-1.

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(6.08e29) = sqrt(6.08) * 1e14.5. Wait, 1e14.5 is 1e14 * sqrt(10), since 1e14.5 = 10^14 * 10^0.5 ≈ 10^14 *3.1623, which is about 3.16e14. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 6.08e29 is 6.08 *1e29. The square root of 1e29 is 1e14.5, which is 3.1623e14. So sqrt(6.08e29) ≈ sqrt(6.08) * 3.1623e14. What's sqrt(6.08)? That's about 2.466. So 2.466 *3.1623e14 = approx 7.78e14.

Wait, so sqrt(k/μ) is about 7.78e14 s^-1. Then multiply by 1/(2π). Let's compute 1/(2π) ≈ 0.15915. So 7.78e14 * 0.15915 ≈ 1.239e14 s^-1. Wait, that's about 1.24e14, which is 1.24 x10^14. Looking at the options, option F is 4.1e14 and option B is 1.25e14, right? Oh wait, my calculation came to 1.239e14, which is approximately 1.24e14. So option B is 1.25e14, which is very close.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. Did I compute the reduced mass correctly? H₂'s reduced mass. For two atoms of mass m, it's m/2. Yes. Mass of H is 1.00784 amu, so 1.00784 *1.6605e-27 kg is approximately 1.67e-27, divided by 2 is 8.35e-28 kg. So that's correct.

k is 5.1 N/cm, which is 510 N/m. Correct.

So k / μ = 510 / 8.363e-28 = let's compute that again. 510 / 8.363e-28 = (510 / 8.363) * 1e28. 510/8.363 is approximately 60.8 (since 8.363 *60 = 501.78, which is close to 510). So 60.8 *1e28 = 6.08e29. Taking the square root gives sqrt(6.08e29) = sqrt(6.08) * sqrt(1e29) = 2.466 * 1e14.5. Wait, sqrt(1e29) is 1e14.5, which is 3.162e14. So 2.466 *3.162e14 = approx 7.79e14.

Multiply by 1/(2pi): 7.79e14 / (6.283) ≈ 1.24e14. So option B is 1.25e14, which is close. So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the vibrational frequency of the lowest vibration state for H₂, we use the formula:

\[
\nu = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( \mu \) is the reduced mass of the two hydrogen atoms. For H₂, the reduced mass is given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

Since both atoms are identical (H₂), the reduced mass simplifies to:

\[
\mu = \frac{m}{2}
\]

The mass of a hydrogen atom is approximately \( 1.00784 \, \text{amu} \), which converts to kilograms as:

\[
m = 1.00784 \times 1.66054 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 1.6726 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

Thus, the reduced mass is:

\[
\mu = \frac{1.6726 \times 10^{-27}}{2} \approx 8.363 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg}.
\]

The spring constant \( k \) is given as \( 5.1 \, \text{N/cm} \), which converts to SI units as:

\[
k = 5.1 \times 100 = 510 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

Now, calculate \( k / \mu \):

\[
\frac{k}{\mu} = \frac{510}{8.363 \times 10^{-28}} \approx 6.08 \times 10^{29} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = \sqrt{6.08 \times 10^{29}} \approx 7.79 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
\]

Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2\pi} \approx 0.15915 \):

\[
\nu = 0.15915 \times 7.79 \times 10^{14} \approx 1.24 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 1.25 \times 10^{14} \, \text{s}^{-1} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
