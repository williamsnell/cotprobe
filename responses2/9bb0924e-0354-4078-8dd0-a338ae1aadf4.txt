Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about resistors and energy dissipation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember from my classes that resistors dissipate energy in the form of heat. The key here is probably the formula that relates power to voltage and resistance.

The problem says a resistor dissipates energy at a rate of 1 W. Then the voltage across it is doubled. They're asking what the new power dissipation will be. Hmm, right, power in a resistor is given by P = V²/R. Oh wait, and R is the resistance. Since the voltage is doubled, I think that affects the power in a specific way.

So initially, the power is P = V²/R = 1 W. If V becomes 2V, then the new power would be (2V)^2/R. Let's compute that. (2V)^2 is 4V², so the new power P' = 4V²/R. Wait, but since the original P was V²/R, which is 1 W, then 4V²/R is 4 times that. So 4 * 1 W = 4 W. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because if you double the voltage, the power increases by the square of the factor. So 2 squared is 4, so 4 times the original power. So the new rate should be 4 W. But wait, looking at the options, option F is 3 W, G is 4 W, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh! Wait, another formula I remember is P = V * I, but that's when current is involved. Oh, right, because if V doubles, but what about current? Oh, but if R remains the same, then I = V/R. So if V doubles, I would also double. So P = V * I = (2V)(2I) = 4VI = 4P. So yeah, that aligns with the earlier calculation. So the new power is 4 times 1 W, which is 4 W. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I mix up formulas.

Alternatively, I remember the formula P = V²/R. So if V doubles, P becomes (2V)^2/R = 4V²/R = 4*(V²/R) = 4P. So 4*1 W is 4 W. So the new power is 4 W. Looking at the options, F is 3 W, G is 4 W.

Wait but wait, another approach: Ohm's law says I = V/R. So if V doubles, I doubles if R is constant. Power is V*I, which would be 2V * 2I = 4VI = 4P. So same result. So the new power is 4W. So the correct answer would be option F: 3 W? Wait wait, no. Wait, wait, no. The options are:

A:2, B:2.5, C:1, D:0.5, E:0.75, F:3, G:4, H:1.5, I:0.25, J:0.75.

Wait, so G is 4 W. So the correct answer should be G. But wait, wait. Wait, no. What if the resistor's resistance changes? Oh wait, the problem doesn't say anything about changing resistance. It just says the voltage is doubled. So R remains the same. So 4W is the right answer.

So the answer is F:3 W? No, no, wait. Wait, no. Because 3 isn't the correct calculation. The correct calculation is 4W, which is option G. So the correct answer is G.

The problem involves a resistor dissipating energy at a rate of 1 W, and the task is to determine the new rate of energy dissipation when the voltage across the resistor is doubled. The power dissipated by a resistor is given by the formula \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), where \( V \) is the voltage and \( R \) is the resistance. Initially, the power is \( 1 \, \text{W} \), so \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} = 1 \, \text{W} \). When the voltage is doubled (\( 2V \)), the new power becomes:

\[
P' = \frac{(2V)^2}{R} = \frac{4V^2}{R} = 4 \cdot \frac{V^2}{R} = 4P
\]

Since the original power \( P \) is \( 1 \, \text{W} \), the new power is \( 4 \cdot 1 \, \text{W} = 4 \, \text{W} \). Among the options provided, the correct answer is \( 4 \, \text{W} \), which corresponds to option G.
