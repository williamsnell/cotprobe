The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: "They call up more every day.
"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
"But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."
Du Fu, "Ballad of the Army Carts," ca. 750 C.E.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Tang relations with Western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples based on Du Fu's poem. The question is asking which historical method or strategy was used by the Tang to connect with these groups.

First, I'll read the poem carefully to grasp the context. The poem is called "Ballad of the Army Carts" by Du Fu, written around 750 CE. It describes the life of the Tang army, their actions during the war, and their challenges, including the issues with labor and the use of land tax. 

The poem mentions that the Shanxi men, who were part of the Tang army, were never sent home after the war. The District Officers were demanding land tax but ran out of money, referring to it as blood from a stone. So, this shows a conflict between the Tang military and the local rulers or nomadic rulers.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one:

A: The establishment of a network of spies and informants among the nomadic tribes. I don't recall the poem mentioning anything about spies or informants. It's more about military campaigns and labor issues.

B: Adroit diplomacy and establishing client relationships with bordering nomads. The poem doesn't describe diplomatic interactions. It's more about military and economic challenges.

C: The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers. The poem mentions that the tax was insufficient, and the rulers ran out of money. This is about the land tax, not tribute. So, this doesn't fit.

D: The forced relocation of frontier peoples to central China. The poem doesn't show any mention of moving people to central China. It's more about the army's issues, like the labor problem and the economic strain.

E: The use of economic incentives to secure loyalty. The poem talks about land tax (taxation) which is a form of economic control. The rulers tried to impose their will, so maybe this refers to their control through economic means.

F: The negotiation of peace treaties with nomadic rulers. The poem doesn't mention any treaties but rather the internal conflicts within the military. So, not this one.

G: Dissemination of Chinese culture and traditions. The poem isn't about cultural spread; it's about military and economic struggles.

H: The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones. The poem is about the Tang army, not Han. So, no.

I: The ability of the emperor to project military power. The poem does talk about the military's success and the need for loyalty, but I'm not sure if it's about the emperor's power. It's more about the army's success and the internal issues.

Wait, the question is about relations with Western nomadic peoples and frontier people. So, in the poem, the focus is on the military's problems, like labor and land tax. The poem doesn't explicitly mention diplomatic strategies or economic incentives. So, looking back, the question is about the methods used by the Tang to relate with these groups. 

So, the options are about the method. The poem doesn't directly talk about diplomacy, but perhaps it's about military strategies. However, the options don't have a direct match. Alternatively, maybe the answer refers to the payment of tribute, but the poem doesn't say so. Wait, option C is about tribute. The poem does mention that the land tax was insufficient, and the rulers ran out of money. That's about the tribute. So, perhaps C is the answer.

Wait, but another angle: The poem talks about the use of labor, which is part of the military's challenges. But the question is about relations, not military strategies. So, perhaps the answer isn't about military strategies but rather about diplomatic methods.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is about the payment of tribute. The poem does describe the need for tribute, but the key point is that the rulers ran out of money, which is about the tribute. So, the payment of tribute is a way to deal with the nomadic rulers.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the payment of tribute was a way to establish a relationship or to address the rulers' concerns. So, the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, the poem might have shown that the rulers were not happy with the army's success and their own taxes, which might indicate that they had a problem with the army but not necessarily that the rulers were trying to pay tribute.

Wait, the options are about methods used by Tang to relate with western nomadic and frontier peoples. The poem doesn't have a direct answer for that. But the question says, "Based on the poem and your knowledge of history, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following?"

Hmm. The poem doesn't explicitly state a diplomatic approach, but the options don't have a choice that directly refers to military strategies. So, perhaps none of the options directly match, but looking again, the options are about methods, and the poem's focus is on military issues.

Wait, another angle: The poem talks about labor and land tax. The labor was a problem because it was expensive, needing a lot of laborers. So, the rulers were frustrated and ran out of money. So, perhaps this was a way to deal with the nomadic rulers. But the options don't have a choice about labor issues.

Wait, the options are:

A: Spies and informants

B: Diplomacy and clients

C: Tribune payments

D: Relocation to central China

E: Economic incentives

F: Peace treaties

G: Cultural dissemination

H: Centralization of Han

I: Projection of military power

So, the poem doesn't explicitly mention diplomacy or economic incentives. So, maybe the answer is about the payment of tribute, which is option C.

Alternatively, the poem's focus is on the army's issues, but the question is about relations, so maybe it's about the way the rulers dealt with the army's problems. The poem doesn't have a direct answer, but perhaps the payment of tribute is a method, so option C.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The poem is about the army's success and the need for loyalty. However, the question is about the Tang's methods to deal with Western nomadic and frontier groups. The payment of tribute is a method the rulers might have used to deal with the army's issues, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are about the methods the Tang used to relate with these people. So, perhaps the answer is about their military strategy, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, the poem might show that the rulers were forced to pay tribute, which is a way to deal with the army. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, the answer that comes closest is option C: The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers. The poem does describe the need for tribute, but it's more about the military's problems rather than the rulers' loyalty. Alternatively, maybe the rulers were forced to pay tribute, which is a way to maintain loyalty.

Alternatively, perhaps the poem shows that the rulers ran out of money, which is a way to deal with the army. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the answer is option C: the payment of tribute.

Wait, another thought: The poem mentions the need for land tax, which is a form of tribute. So, the rulers were forced to pay, which is a way to establish loyalty. Therefore, the payment of tribute is a method, so option C.

But I'm not sure if the poem explicitly states that. I think the poem is more about the military's struggles rather than diplomatic methods.

The poem by Du Fu describes the challenges faced by the Tang army, including labor issues and insufficient land tax, which led to economic strain. However, the question focuses on Tang relations with Western nomadic and frontier peoples. The poem does not explicitly address diplomatic strategies or economic incentives. It emphasizes military struggles but does not mention methods like diplomacy or tribute.

Analyzing the options:

- **C**: The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers. The poem mentions the need for land tax, which is a form of tribute. This aligns with the idea that the rulers might have sought financial support to maintain loyalty.

Thus, the most plausible answer is that the payment of tribute was a method used by the Tang to deal with the nomadic rulers.

ANSWER: C
