Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much interest Mr. Hendricks has to pay every six months on his mortgage. Let me break this down step by step. 

Mr. Hendricks borrowed $5,000 at a 5% annual interest rate, and he's paying it back in semiannual installments over 20 years. The question is asking for the interest due every six months. 

First, I remember that when dealing with loans like mortgages, the interest is typically calculated using the simple interest formula, but in this case, since the payments are made every six months (semiannual), I think it's actually a bit more involved. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no, wait—this must be a fixed-rate mortgage, which implies that the interest is calculated on the outstanding principal each period. So, the interest for each six-month period would be based on the current principal. 

So, the annual interest rate is 5%. That's 5% per year, which translates to 2.5% per six months, but wait no, wait: 5% annual divided by two is indeed 2.5% per period. Wait, but that's just the interest rate. The actual interest is calculated on the current principal, but since the principal is decreasing each year and each installment is fixed, the interest portion changes each period. So, this is an amortizing loan. 

Wait, so the question is about the interest due every six months. So, in each year, the total interest would be principal times the rate per period. Let me calculate that first. 

Principal is $5,000. The rate is 5% per annum. So, the annual interest is 5% of 5000, which is 250 dollars. So, over two years (20 years), the total interest would be 250 * 20 = $5,000. But since he's making semiannual payments, each payment would be part principal and part interest. 

Wait, but the question is asking specifically for the interest per six months. So, the annual interest is $5,000. Therefore, the interest per six months would be half of that, which is $250. Is that right? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 

Wait, no. The total interest over the life of the loan is equal to the principal multiplied by the interest rate multiplied by the time. But the question is about the interest per period, not the total. 

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how fixed-rate mortgages are structured. Each payment is equal, and each period (semiannual here) consists of a principal payment and interest. The interest portion decreases each period because the principal is being paid down. But the question is about the interest for each six-month period. 

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the interest due every six months. So, if the annual interest is $5,000, then each six months would be half of that, which is $250. So, the interest due every six months is $250. Looking at the options, option E is $250. 

Wait, but wait! Another way to think about it is to calculate the interest on the principal each period. So, the annual interest is $5,000, so the semiannual interest would be half of that, which is $2,500? No, wait, no, no. No, wait, no, the annual interest is 5% of 5000, which is 250. No, that's the total annual interest. So, each six months, the interest is 250 / 2 = $125. Wait, wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. 

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the total annual interest and the semiannual interest. Let me clarify. 

The question is about the interest due every six months. So, the annual interest is 5% of 5000, which is 250, but that's the total interest over the year. So, each six months, the interest portion would be half of that, which is 125. But wait, that's if the interest is calculated as a simple rate. But in a mortgage, the interest is typically calculated on the remaining principal each period, so each payment's interest is based on the current principal.

Wait, but the problem states that he's paying in semiannual installments, so each payment is a fixed amount, which includes both principal and interest. But the question is about the interest portion of each payment. So, perhaps I should calculate the total payment each period and see how much is interest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the fixed payment amount first and then see the interest portion. 

So, the fixed payment would be the same every period. The formula for the fixed payment is the present value of the loan, which is $5000, the interest rate is 5% per annum, paid semiannually, so 2.5% per period. The number of periods is 20 years * 2 = 40 periods.

The formula for the fixed payment is [P * r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ], where P is principal, r is the rate per period, n is the number of periods.

So, P = 5000, r = 0.025, n=40.

So, let's compute that.

First, compute (1 + r)^n. 0.025^40? Wait, that's a very small number. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using the formula:

Payment = P * [ r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

Alternatively, compute each part step by step.

Compute (1 + r) = 1.025.

Compute (1.025)^40. Hmm, that's a bit tricky without a calculator, but perhaps I can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using logarithms or exponentials, but perhaps it's easier to compute it step by step.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the fixed payment can be calculated as:

PMT = P * ( r * (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

So, r is 0.025, n=40.

So first, compute (1 + 0.025)^40.

But wait, I don't remember the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can look it up or use an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate formula for annuity:

PMT ≈ P * ( r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) )

But I might be getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the fixed payment is calculated as a standard annuity, and then each payment includes some interest.

But perhaps I can compute it. Let me try.

Let me compute (1.025)^40. I'll approximate it.

I know that ln(1.025) ≈ 0.02469. So, ln( (1.025)^40 ) = 40 * 0.02469 ≈ 0.9876. So, exp(0.9876) ≈ e^0.9876 ≈ about 2.68. So, (1.025)^40 ≈ 2.68.

So, (1.025)^40 ≈ 2.68.

So, now compute the numerator: 0.025 * 2.68 ≈ 0.067.

Denominator: (2.68 - 1) = 1.68.

So, PMT = 5000 * (0.067 / 1.68) ≈ 5000 * 0.040 ≈ 5000 * 0.04 = 200, so approximately 200.

Wait, but this is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute this using a calculator or look up the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a 40-period annuity. Alternatively, perhaps using the present value formula.

Wait, another approach: the present value (PV) of the annuity is equal to the loan amount. So, PV = PMT * [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ].

So, 5000 = PMT * [ 1 - (1.025)^-40 ) / 0.025 ]

Compute (1.025)^-40. Since (1.025)^40 ≈ 2.68, then (1.025)^-40 ≈ 1/2.68 ≈ 0.373.

So, 1 - 0.373 = 0.627.

Divide by 0.025: 0.627 / 0.025 = 25.08.

So, 5000 = PMT * 25.08 → PMT = 5000 /25.08 ≈ 199.47, approximately $200.

So, the fixed payment is about $200 per period. Since each period is six months, the total fixed payment is $200, but that's the amount each period, so the interest portion would be part of that.

Wait, but the question is about the interest due every six months. So perhaps I need to find out how much of the $200 is interest. 

In a fixed-rate mortgage, each payment includes a portion of principal and the rest is interest. The interest for each period is based on the outstanding principal at the beginning of the period.

So, the first period's interest is 5000 * 0.025 = $125. Then, after paying $125 in interest and the principal portion, the principal reduces. 

But since the payments are fixed, the interest portion decreases each period as the principal is paid down.

But the question is about the interest due every six months. So, if each payment is $200, and the interest portion is 5000 * 0.025 = $125 in the first period, and the principal portion is $75 (since 200 -125 =75). Then, in the next period, the outstanding principal is 5000 -75=4925, and the interest is 4925 * 0.025 = $123.125. So, the interest decreases each period. 

But wait, the question is about the interest due every six months, which is every period. So, the interest for the first period is $125, for the second is $123.125, etc. So, the interest due each period is $125, $123.125, etc.

But the options given are various amounts, but perhaps the options are about the total interest over the period, not per payment. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the interest due per six months, which would be the interest on the current principal for that period.

Wait, perhaps another way to approach this problem is to calculate the interest due each six months as part of the fixed payment. But given that each payment's interest is less than the previous, it's not a constant $125 per six months. However, the question is about the interest due every six months, which is the interest on the principal at the start of that period.

Wait, but the problem is phrased as "How much interest is due every six months?" So, perhaps the interest due per six months is calculated as the interest on the principal at the beginning of the period. But I thought that's 5% annual, so 2.5% per six months, which would be 5000 * 0.025 = $125. So, the interest due every six months is $125. 

But wait, that's only the first period. After the first payment, the principal reduces, so the interest for the next period decreases. So, perhaps the first six months' interest is $125, then the next six months' interest is $123.125, etc. But the options don't include varying amounts. The options are all fixed numbers, so perhaps the question is asking for the interest per period based on the initial principal, which is $125. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the fixed payment is $200, which is the same each period. So, the total interest over the life of the loan is 5000 - 200 * n, where n is the number of periods. Wait, but that's a bit more involved, but perhaps not necessary for this question.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest per six months is the interest on the initial principal, which is $5,000 * 2.5% = $125. So, the interest per six months is $125. So, the answer would be option A: $125.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in the fixed-rate mortgage, each period's interest is based on the outstanding principal. So, the first six months' interest is 5000 * 2.5% = 125. Then, the second period's interest is (5000 - 75) * 2.5% = 4925 * 2.5% = 123.125. So, the interest is decreasing each period. 

But the question is asking specifically for the interest due every six months. So, if every six months, the interest is 125, then 125 would be the interest for the first period, 123.125 for the second, etc. But the options don't vary, so perhaps the question is expecting the interest based on the initial principal, which is $125.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick us into thinking that the interest is fixed every six months, but in reality, it changes each period. So, perhaps the correct answer is $125, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is $125.

But wait, another way to compute the fixed payment is to use the present value of annuity formula. The present value is 5000, the number of periods is 40, the rate per period is 2.5%. So, the fixed payment PMT is equal to PV * [ r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) ].

So, PMT = 5000 * [ 0.025 / (1 - (1.025)^-40) ]

We've computed (1.025)^40 ≈ 2.68, so (1.025)^-40 ≈ 0.373.

So, 1 - 0.373 = 0.627.

So, 0.025 / 0.627 ≈ 0.040.

So, PMT ≈ 5000 * 0.040 = 200.

So, the fixed payment is $200, which is the same as before.

Therefore, each payment is $200, which includes $125 interest and $75 principal. So, the interest due in the first period is $125, the principal part is $75, bringing the principal down to $4925.

In the next period, the interest is 4925 * 2.5% = 123.125, and the principal part is 200 -123.125 =76.875. 

So, each period's interest is decreasing by about $1.875.

But the question is asking for the interest due every six months, which would be the interest in each period. The options don't have varying amounts; they are fixed. So, perhaps the question is referring to the interest per period based on the initial principal.

Wait, but that would be $125, which is option A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the interest due for each payment, the first period's interest is $125, but after that, it's less. But the options don't reflect that. So, perhaps the intended answer is $125, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward, and the interest is simply the annual interest divided by two, which is 5000 * 5% * 0.5 = 5000 * 0.025 = 125. So, option A would be correct.
</think>

The question asks for the interest due every six months on a $5,000 mortgage with a 5% annual interest rate, amortized over 20 years with semiannual payments. 

The annual interest is 5%, so the semiannual interest is half of that, which is 2.5%. Therefore, the interest due every six months is calculated as:

Interest per period = Principal × Semiannual Interest Rate  
Interest per period = $5,000 × 2.5%  
Interest per period = $5,000 × 0.025  
Interest per period = $125  

Thus, the correct answer is **A: $125**.
