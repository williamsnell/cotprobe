Question:

A research project compared the performance of learning disabled and of normal students on ten scales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ~ Revised (WISC-R). Ten univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run to test for differences between the two groups, but use of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) would have been more desirable because MANOVA

Options:

A: can account for more variables simultaneously
B: is a more recent development in statistical analysis
C: reduces the need for subsequent regression analysis
D: can handle larger datasets more effectively
E: usually offers greater protection against Type Il error
F: requires less computational power
G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error
H: allows for more detailed individual participant analysis
I: is conceptually and computationally a simpler and more efficient approach

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about statistical methods, specifically comparing two groups—learning disabled and normal students—on different scales using the WISC-R. The question is about why a MANOVA would be more desirable than a series of ANOVA's.

Let me think. I remember that ANOVA is used when you have a single dependent variable and multiple independent variables. MANOVA, on the other hand, is used when you have multiple dependent variables. So, in this case, the project is looking at ten different scales. That means each scale is a separate dependent variable. So using MANOVA makes sense because it can handle multiple outcomes at once, whereas multiple ANOVAs would require running ten separate tests, which is more complicated and less efficient.

Looking at the options, option A says MANOVA can account for more variables simultaneously. That sounds right because each scale is a variable. So MANOVA would handle all ten together, whereas ANOVA can't do that in one go.

Option B is about being a more recent development. I know MANOVA is a more advanced technique, but I don't think it's specifically a more recent development. I think it's been around for a while, maybe even before the 1970s. So B might not be the best answer.

Option C talks about reducing the need for regression analysis. I'm not sure about that. I think MANOVA can be used with regression, but it's not that it reduces the need. Maybe it's a way around it, but the main point is that MANOVA handles multiple DVs better.

Option D says it handles larger datasets more effectively. I'm not sure. Both methods can handle larger datasets, but I don't recall MANOVA necessarily being more effective in that aspect. It depends on the data structure.

Option E is about Type II error. That's Type I, right? Wait, no. E says "greater protection against Type II error." Wait, no, Type II is the error where you accept a false positive. Type I is when you reject a true null hypothesis. So E is incorrect—probably not.

Option F: requires less computational power. I don't think so. MANOVA needs more computation because it involves matrix operations for the multivariate tests, like MANOVA's overall F statistic which involves multiple sums of squares.

Option G says it offers greater protection against Type I error. Wait, no. Type I is the error I'm discussing. I think Type I is when you reject a true null hypothesis. Type II is accepting a false null. So G is incorrect.

Option H: allows for more detailed individual analysis. I'm not sure about this. I think MANOVA is more about overall group differences and less about individual participant analysis. So H might not be correct.

Option I: conceptually and computationally simpler. I don't think MANOVA is conceptually simpler than ANOVA. It's more about handling multiple DVs, so it's still a bit complex but perhaps more straightforward in approach. So I think I is incorrect.

So the correct answer is A. Because MANOVA handles multiple dependent variables at once, which is what the question is about. Each scale is a different DV, so MANOVA would be more efficient and comprehensive.

The correct answer is A: MANOVA can account for more variables simultaneously.

**Explanation:**
The research compares ten scales of the WISC-R between two groups, necessitating a method that handles multiple dependent variables. MANOVA is suitable for this scenario as it can analyze multiple DVs together, whereas multiple ANOVA analyses would be less efficient. Other options either address different statistical concerns or are not the primary reason for choosing MANOVA over ANOVA.
