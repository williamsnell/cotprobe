Okay, so I've got this question about GNP and the price index. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that in the base year, GNP was $1000 billion. Since then, money GNP increased by $500 billion, and real GNP increased by $250 billion. They want the current price index. 

Wait, I remember that the price index measures how much the price level has changed. Oh right, the formula for the price index is (Nominal GNP / Real GNP) * 100. So in this case, the nominal GNP is higher because money GNP has increased. 

Wait, let me get the numbers straight. The base year's GNP is 1000. Since then, money GNP went up by 500, so the nominal GNP is 1500. Real GNP went up by 250, so it's 1250. 

So plugging into the formula: (1500 / 1250) * 100. Let me calculate that. 1500 divided by 1250 is 1.2, times 100 is 120. So the price index should be 120. Oh wait, looking at the options, E is 120. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second, the question says the last character must be the letter chosen. So the current price index is 120, which is option E. That makes sense. Because when GNP increases, the price index goes up, indicating inflation. So if money GNP increases by 500 and real by 250, the overall increase is 500. The base year's GNP was 1000, so the current price index is 120. Yeah, that's E.

The current price index is calculated using the formula: 

\[
\text{Price Index} = \left( \frac{\text{Nominal GNP}}{\text{Real GNP}} \right) \times 100
\]

In the base year, GNP is $1000 billion. Since then, money GNP increased by $500 billion (to $1500 billion) and real GNP increased by $250 billion (to $1250 billion). 

Plugging the values:

\[
\text{Price Index} = \left( \frac{1500}{1250} \right) \times 100 = 120
\]

The current price index is **120**, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
