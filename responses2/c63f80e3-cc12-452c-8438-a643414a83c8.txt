Okay, so I have this problem here about dividing a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but let me think through this step by step.

Wait, so the question is asking for the number of ways to partition a set of 6 elements into exactly 3 non-empty, ordered subsets. I remember something about counting the number of ways to split a set into subsets, which relates to something called Stirling numbers of the second kind. But wait, are these subsets ordered or unordered?

Oh right! The key here is that the subsets are ordered. So it's not just about partitioning into any subsets but considering the order. For example, if I have subsets {A,B}, {C,D}, {E,F}, this is different from {C,D}, {A,B}, {E,F} because their order matters.

I think the formula for the number of ordered partitions into k subsets is the Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n,k), multiplied by k! because the subsets are ordered. Or wait, no, maybe it's just S(n,k) multiplied by something else. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The Stirling number S(n,k) counts the number of ways to partition a set into k non-empty, unlabeled subsets. So if the subsets are ordered, we need to account for the order, so we multiply by k!.

So for 6 elements into 3 subsets, the calculation would be S(6,3) multiplied by 3!.

I remember that S(n,k) can be calculated with the formula involving combinations and inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, there's a recursive formula for Stirling numbers. But maybe I can find S(6,3) using known values or a formula.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about ordered partitions. Another way to compute this is to consider that each element can be assigned to one of the 3 subsets. But since the subsets are ordered, we need to divide by something? Wait, no. Let me think of it as arranging the elements into ordered lists.

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to model it as assigning each element to one of the 3 ordered subsets, but ensuring that none are empty. So the number of ways is equal to the number of onto functions from a 6-element set to a 3-element set, multiplied by the number of orderings of the subsets.

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, the number of ordered partitions is equal to the number of ordered partitions, which is the same as the number of total functions minus the ones that leave one or more subsets empty. But perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle for set partitions.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the number of ordered partitions into k subsets is equal to k! multiplied by the Stirling number S(n,k). So in this case, it's 3! * S(6,3).

So I need to find S(6,3) first.

Wait, another approach: the number of ordered partitions into k subsets is the same as the number of ordered lists of k subsets whose union is the entire set, and none are empty.

The formula for this is k! * S(n,k). So yes, that's correct.

So I need to compute S(6,3). I think the formula for S(n,k) is given by the sum from i=0 to k-1 of C(k-1, i) * C(n-i-1, k-1-i) * S(n-i, k-1-i)}.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find S(6,3) using a table or known values. I remember that S(6,3) is 90. Let me check: For S(n,k), the values go like S(1,1)=1, S(2,1)=1, S(2,2)=1, S(3,1)=1, S(3,2)=3, S(3,3)=1, S(4,1)=1, S(4,2)=7, S(4,3)=6, S(4,4)=1, S(5,3)=25, S(5,4)=10, S(5,5)=1, S(6,3)=90. So yes, S(6,3)=90.

So the number of ordered partitions is 90 * 3! because 3! is 6, so 90 *6=540. So the answer should be 540.

Looking at the options, option D is 540. So the correct answer is D.

The number of ways to divide a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets is calculated using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(6,3), which equals 90. Since the subsets are ordered, we multiply by 3!, giving 90 * 6 = 540. 

Answer: D: 540
