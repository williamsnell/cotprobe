Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the free electron gas theory and the Fermi energy in copper. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the average kinetic energy E of the free electrons is (3/5)E_F, where E_F is the Fermi energy. They're asking to estimate the average speed of the valence electrons in copper, which has a Fermi energy of 7 eV. The options are all various speeds and energies, so I need to calculate the speed using the given information.

Hmm, I remember that the kinetic energy of a particle is (1/2)mv². So the average kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2 = (3/5)E_F. Oh wait, because the average kinetic energy is (3/5)E_F, right?

So I can set up the equation: (1/2)mv² = (3/5)E_F. I need to solve for v, the velocity. Let's rearrange that. 

v = sqrt[(2 * (3/5)E_F) / m]

Wait, m is the mass of an electron, which is about 9.11e-31 kg. Right.

E_F is 7 eV. Oh wait, I need to convert that into joules because the units in the formula should be consistent. I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 7 eV is 7 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that: 7 * 1.602e-19 = 1.1214e-18 J.

So plugging the numbers in:

v = sqrt[(2*(3/5)*1.1214e-18) / (9.11e-31)]

Let me compute the numerator first. 2 * (3/5) is 6/5, so 6/5 is 1.2. 1.2 * 1.1214e-18 is 1.34568e-18 J.

Divide that by the electron mass: 1.34568e-18 / 9.11e-31 = approx (1.34568 / 9.11) * 1e13. Let me calculate that: 1.34568 / 9.11 ≈ 0.1477. So 0.1477e13 = 1.477e12.

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(1.477e12) = approx 1.215e6 m/s. Hmm, wait, but let me double-check that.

Wait, 1.477e12 is 1.477 x 10^12. The square root of 1e12 is 1e6, so sqrt(1.477e12) would be sqrt(1.477) * 1e6. The square root of 1.477 is approximately 1.215, so 1.215e6 m/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.21e6 m/s, option F is 2.6e6, and option G is 2.2e6. Wait, option B is 1.21e6, which matches my calculation. So the speed is about 1.21e6 m/s.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I did the calculation right.

Wait, wait, the actual calculation:

E_F = 7 eV = 7 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.1214e-18 J.

So (3/5) * E_F = (3/5)(1.1214e-18) = 0.6 * 1.1214e-18 = 0.67284e-18 J.

Then, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v² = 0.67284e-18 J.

So v² = (2 * 0.67284e-18) / m = (1.34568e-18) / (9.11e-31) ) = approx 1.477e12 m²/s².

Taking the square root gives v ≈ sqrt(1.477e12) ≈ 1.215e6 m/s.

So the speed is approximately 1.21e6 m/s. Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option B is 1.21e6 m/s, option G is 2.2e6, option F is 2.6e6.

Wait, but I think I missed a decimal perhaps. Let me check the calculation again. Hmm, no, the numbers seem correct. So the correct answer should be B.

To estimate the average speed of valence electrons in copper, we use the relationship between the average kinetic energy and the Fermi energy. The average kinetic energy is given by:

\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = \frac{3}{5}E_F
\]

where \( E_F \) is the Fermi energy. For copper, \( E_F = 7 \, \text{eV} \). Converting this to joules:

\[
E_F = 7 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} = 1.1214 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The average kinetic energy is then:

\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = \frac{3}{5} \times 1.1214 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} = 0.67284 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The kinetic energy of a free electron is also expressed as:

\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2,
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of an electron (\( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)) and \( v \) is the velocity. Rearranging for \( v \):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{\text{kinetic}}}{m}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 0.67284 \times 10^{-18}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \times 0.67284 \times 10^{-18} = 1.34568 \times 10^{-18}.
\]

Now divide by the electron mass:

\[
\frac{1.34568 \times 10^{-18}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = 1.477 \times 10^{12}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = \sqrt{1.477 \times 10^{12}} \approx 1.215 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Thus, the average speed of the valence electrons in copper is approximately \( 1.21 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: \( 1.21 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \)**.
