Question:

A large man with red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a defendant was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the corrections officer was not present at the scene of the crime.
B: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the case.
C: inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.
D: admissible as a character evidence.
E: admissible as a prior identification.
F: admissible, as it is a part of the arresting officer's routine report.
G: admissible, as it is a part of the chain of evidence in the case.
H: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
I: admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.
J: inadmissible, as it is prejudicial against the defendant.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically regarding testimony and admissibility. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about a case where a defendant was charged with an armed robbery. There were multiple witnesses testifying about seeing a man with red hair who pulled out a gun and robbed the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head, which is unusual.

Now, the prosecution brings in a corrections officer's testimony that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects, and the trial judge needs to decide whether this officer's testimony is admissible.

I need to figure out the admissibility of the corrections officer's statement. Let's break down the elements of evidence that affect it.

First, the hearsay rule applies here. The defendant's own statement about his appearance is hearsay. But the officer's testimony is not the defendant's own statement but an officer's statement. So, the key is whether this statement is hearsay or not.

There are different types of hearsay. There's physical hearsay, which is about the physical characteristics, like hair color. There's hearsay without permission, which is when the statement is made by someone not in the same situation as the defendant. There's also hearsay not within an exception.

The corrections officer's testimony isn't hearsay because it's about the defendant's appearance, which is a characteristic of the defendant. So, it's not hearsay. But wait, maybe it's not physical hearsay because it's about a characteristic, not a specific object of the crime. So, maybe the officer's statement is admissible as a hearsay exception.

Wait, but the question is about whether the officer's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay. If it's hearsay, then the defense's objection is valid, and the officer's statement would have to be admitted as a defense hearsay exception. But sometimes, the officer's statements are allowed in certain cases.

Alternatively, the officer's testimony could be considered a part of the arresting officer's routine report. But I'm not sure if that's an exception.

Wait, the possible options here are about whether the officer's testimony is admissible as a hearsay. So, looking at the options:

Option G says it's admissible as part of the chain of evidence. I think that's a thing. Chain of evidence is when a witness's statement is connected to the next witness's testimony. If the arresting officer's report is part of the chain, then the corrections officer's statement could be admitted as evidence of the arresting officer's knowledge, which would be hearsay.

But wait, the chain of evidence can be used to establish the truth of the matter. If the arresting officer's report is part of the chain, and the corrections officer's statement is a fact maturing from that report, then it might be admissible.

Another angle: The correction officer's testimony is not hearsay because it's about the defendant's appearance, which is a characteristic. So, the objection by the defense is valid, and the officer's testimony is admissible.

Wait, but the options don't have 'admissible as a hearsay exception'â€”the question is about whether it's inadmissible as hearsay. So, perhaps the officer's testimony is not hearsay but could be used as a fact established earlier, making it admissible as part of the chain of evidence.

Looking back at the options, option G is "admissible, as part of the chain of evidence in the case." That's possible because the chain of evidence allows for the accumulation of facts from one witness to another.

Alternatively, if the corrections officer's testimony is hearsay, then the objection is valid. But since the officer's statement is about a characteristic, it's not hearsay. So the objection is not valid, and the testimony is admissible.

Wait, but wait: the officer's statement is not hearsay because it's about the defendant's appearance, which is a characteristic. So the objection by the defense is invalid. Thus, the correction officer's testimony is admissible.

But wait, let me think again. There's the case of the arresting officer's report. If the arresting officer's report is part of the chain of evidence, then any statement that relates to that report could be admitted as a fact. So, if the corrections officer's statement about the defendant's appearance is based on that report, it's admissible.

But is the correction officer's statement hearsay? I think not because it's about a characteristic. So the objection by the defense is not valid, and the testimony is admissible.

Looking at the options, option G is admissible as part of the chain of evidence. So the trial judge would rule it in.

Wait, but another thought: the corrections officer's statement could be considered as a defense hearsay, so the objection is valid, and the testimony is inadmissible. But that would be if it's hearsay. But if it's not, then it's not inadmissible.

Wait, no. If the statement is not hearsay, it's admissible as a fact established earlier. So the objection is not valid, and the testimony is admissible.

So the right answer is G: admissible as part of the chain of evidence.
</think>

The trial judge should rule that the corrections officer's testimony is admissible as a fact established earlier. The corrections officer's statement about the defendant's appearance is not hearsay because it pertains to a characteristic of the defendant. Since it is not hearsay, the objection raised by the defendant is valid, and the testimony is admissible as part of the chain of evidence in the case.

Answer: G
