Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question says a force of 0.20 Newtons acts on a mass of 100 grams, and I need to find the acceleration. Hmm, I remember from school that Newton's second law is involved here. The law is F = m * a, right?

Wait, but wait. Units can be tricky. The mass given is in grams, but the standard unit for mass is kilograms. Oh right, I think I should convert grams to kilograms. So 100 grams is 0.1 kilograms, because 1 kilogram is 1000 grams. So 100 grams is 100/1000, which is 0.1 kg.

Now, the force is in Newtons, which is kg·m/s². So the formula is Force equals mass times acceleration. I need to solve for acceleration, so I'll rearrange the formula: acceleration equals force divided by mass.

Plugging in the numbers: 0.20 N divided by 0.1 kg. Let me do that calculation. 0.2 / 0.1 is 2. So the acceleration should be 2 m/s².

Looking at the options, option C is 2.0 m/sec². That seems right. Wait, but let me double-check the units. Oh yeah, I converted grams to kilograms correctly. So yeah, 0.2 / 0.1 is definitely 2. So the correct answer must be option C.

The problem involves calculating acceleration using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \). The force is 0.20 N, and the mass is 100 grams, which converts to 0.1 kg. Rearranging the formula to solve for acceleration, \( a = F/m \), we get \( a = 0.20 \, \text{N} / 0.1 \, \text{kg} = 2.0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). 

The correct answer is option C, 2.0 m/s².
