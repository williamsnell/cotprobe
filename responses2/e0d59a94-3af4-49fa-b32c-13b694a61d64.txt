Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Ricardian theory of land rents and the single-tax movement from the late nineteenth century. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking about the goal of the single-tax movement and its economic rationale based on the Ricardian theory. The options are A to J, each with a different goal and rationale.

I remember from my economics classes that Ricardo's theory of land rent had to do with how land productivity affects the returns to land. So, he thought that the value of land (rent) depends on how productive it is. If land is more productive, it should be more valuable. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The single-tax movement, I think, was a reaction to how taxes were structured and how they affected different industries. Ricardo argued that land rent is a factor of production, so taxes should be imposed on land to encourage certain economic activities. But the idea of a single tax meant that all taxes would be on the same basis, like wealth or something else, not individual products.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me go through each.

Option A: To eliminate all taxes but a tax on land. That seems a bit vague. I don't recall Ricardo proposing something like that. Ricardo's theory was more about land as a productive factor, not eliminating taxes entirely.

Option B: To tax only corporate profits as a means of funding government. Hmm, I think the Ricardian theory was about transferring taxes from one sector to another. So, maybe a single tax on corporate profits would redistribute taxes, but I'm not sure if that was the goal of the movement.

Option C: To impose a single tax on wealth and capital gains only. That sounds more aligned with the Ricardian idea of taxing wealth, since land rent depends on the productivity of the land, which relates to wealth. So this might be the rationale.

Option D: To replace all taxes with a single tax on income. That doesn't sound right. The Ricardian theory focused on land, not income taxes. Plus, a single tax on income would probably affect all types of goods, not just the land and its productivity.

Option E: To eliminate all taxes. That doesn't make sense. The purpose was not to abolish taxes but to redistribute them.

Option F: To introduce a single tax on consumption goods and services. That could be, but the question is about the theory behind the movement, which was about land.

Option G: To establish a flat tax rate for all forms of income. Again, that's more like a different policy, not directly related to Ricardo's theory.

Option H: To levy a single tax on imports and exports to regulate trade. That's a policy tool, not the theoretical rationale behind the movement.

Option I: To reduce taxes on land to encourage agriculture. That seems related, but I'm not sure if that's the Ricardian theory's exact goal. Ricardo's theory was about land as a factor, not about direct policy on land taxes.

Option J: To increase all taxes. That would be a broad policy, and I don't think Ricardo's theory focused on that.

So, going back to the options, C and I seem relevant. The movement's goal was to redistribute taxes, perhaps because land taxes were too concentrated and taxed in a way that wasn't efficient. By imposing a single tax on wealth and capital, it aimed to reduce the burden on specific industries, like land, which Ricardo thought should be taxed more because land is a "property" that generates returns.

So the movement's goal was probably to reduce the burden on land, and the rationale was that a single tax on wealth and capital would transfer the burden from land to other sectors like industry, thereby encouraging economic growth.

Wait, another angle: The single-tax movement was a response to the idea that land taxes were too concentrated, leading to inequality. By taxing capital and wealth, the idea was to create a more equitable system that would benefit all, not just those in the highest land productivity.

So the correct answer must be C and I. Wait, let me look again. The question is about the movement's goal and its rationale based on Ricardo's theory.

The movement's goal was to reduce taxes on land but I'm not sure that's the exact goal. The movement's aim was to impose a single tax on wealth and capital, which would prevent land from being taxed excessively and would redistribute the tax burden. So, the rationale was that land is a productive factor, and taxes on it should be based on wealth, not on individual products.

So looking at the options, C says: To impose a single tax on wealth and capital gains only. That matches.

The single-tax movement in the late nineteenth century, driven by Ricardo's Ricardian theory of land rents, aimed to redistribute taxes to reduce the burden on specific industries, such as land. The rationale was based on the idea that taxes on land should be based on wealth and capital gains, as land is a productive factor. This movement sought to ensure that land taxes were not concentrated and that they would not disproportionately affect certain sectors, promoting a more equitable tax system.
