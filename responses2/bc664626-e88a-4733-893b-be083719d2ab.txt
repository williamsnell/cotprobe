Okay, so I've got this problem about a series RLC circuit and finding the resistance R that makes it critically damped. Hmm, I remember that for a series RLC circuit, the damping is determined by the damping factor, which is related to R and L and C. 

The formula I think I need is the characteristic equation for the differential equation that describes the circuit. When the damping is critical, the discriminant of the characteristic equation must be zero. Because for a critical damping condition, the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.

The characteristic equation for a series RLC circuit is something like ... wait, I think it's of the form (d²/dt²) + (R/(L)) (d/dt) + (1/(LC)) = 0. Or wait, let me get that right. The standard form for a series RLC circuit is L d²x/dt² + R dx/dt + (1/C)x = 0, or maybe (1/L) d²x/dt² + (R/L) dx/dt + (1/(LC)) x = 0? Oh wait, no. Let me think. The standard form is usually written as L (d²x/dt²) + R (dx/dt) + (1/C) x = 0, which can be rearranged to d²x/dt² + (R/L) dx/dt + (1/(LC)) x = 0. Right, because if we factor out L, we get L*(equation) = 0, so the equation becomes the terms divided by L.

So the characteristic equation is: r² + (R/L) r + (1)/(LC) = 0.

For critical damping, the discriminant D should be zero. The discriminant D of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c =0 is D = b² -4ac. So in our case, a is 1, b is R/L, and c is 1/(LC).

Setting discriminant D to zero: (R/L)^2 - 4*(1)*(1/(LC)) =0.

Solving for R:

(R/L)^2 = 4/(LC)
Multiply both sides by L²:
R² = (4 L)/(C)
Wait, wait, let's re-calculate step by step.

Wait, D = (R/L)^2 - 4*(1) * (1/(LC)) = 0.

So, (R²)/(L²) = 4/(LC) → R² = (4)/(C) * (L/(L²)) ?

Wait, let me do it more carefully.

We have D = (R/L)^2 - (4)/(LC) =0 → (R²)/(L²) = 4/(LC) → R² = (4 L)/(C L²) ?

Wait, wait, maybe I should do it correctly.

Starting from D = (R²)/(L²) - (4)/(LC) = 0.

Multiply both sides by L² C to eliminate denominators:

R² C - 4 L =0 → R² = (4 L)/(C) → R = sqrt(4 L / C).

Wait, wait, let me double-check: 4/(LC) is the term. So,

(R²)/(L²) = 4/(LC) → R² = (4 L)/(C L^2) ? No, that's not right. Wait, let's correct that.

Wait, if (R²)/(L²) = 4/(LC), then R² = (4 L )/( C L^2 )? No, wait, that's 4/(C L). Because 4/(LC) multiplied by L² is 4L/(C).

Wait, no, let me think. Let me take the equation:

(R/L)^2 = 4/(LC) → R²/L² = 4/(LC) → R² = (4 L²)/(LC) → R² = (4 L)/(C) → R = sqrt(4 L / C ). Ah, yes, that's correct.

So R = sqrt( (4 L ) / C )

Alternatively, R= 2 * sqrt( L / C )

Wait, let me compute that. Because 4 L / C is (2^2) * (L/C), so square root is 2 sqrt(L/C). So R = 2 * sqrt( L / C )

So let's plug in the numbers. L is 0.2 H, and C is 0.8e-6 F.

So sqrt( L/C ) is sqrt( (0.2)/(0.8e-6) )

Wait, let me compute that.

0.2 divided by 0.8e-6: 0.2 / 0.8e-6 = (0.2 / 0.8 ) * 1e6 → 0.25 * 1e6 = 250,000 → sqrt(250,000) = 500.

So sqrt(L/C) is 500. Then R is 2 * 500 = 1000 Ohms?

Wait, wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait, no. Because 0.2 / 0.8e-6 is 0.2 / 0.0000008. Let me compute that correctly.

0.2 / 0.0000008 → Let's write 0.2 as 2e-1, 0.0000008 as 8e-7.

So 2e-1 / 8e-7 = (2/8) * 1e6 → 0.25 * 1e6 = 250,000.

So sqrt(250,000) is 500. Then R is 2 * 500 = 1000 Ohms.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1000 Ohms. So that's the answer, right?

But wait, wait a second, I think I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula I used was R = 2 * sqrt( (L)/(C) ). But wait, I think the correct formula for critical damping is R = 2 * sqrt(L/(C)) ?

Wait, wait, in the standard RLC circuit, the damping factor is given by ω_d = sqrt( (R/L)^2 - (1/(LC)) ). For critical damping, ω_d = 0 → (R/L)^2 = 1/(LC) → R² = (1/(LC)) * L² → R² = L/(C) → R = sqrt( L/(C) ) * ?

Wait, that would give R = sqrt( L/(C) ), but that would be for underdamped, I think. Or maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, the characteristic equation for a series RLC circuit is:

d²x/dt² + (R/L) dx/dt + (1/(LC)) x = 0.

The characteristic equation is r² + (R/L) r + 1/(LC) =0.

The discriminant D is (R/L)^2 - 4*(1)/(LC).

Setting D=0 for critical damping: (R/L)^2 = 4/(LC) → R² = (4 L^2)/(LC) ) → R² = (4 L)/(C) → R = sqrt(4 L/C ) → R=2 sqrt( L/C )

Ah, so R is 2 times the square root of L over C.

Wait, but wait, earlier I computed L/C as 0.2 / 0.8e-6 = 250,000, so sqrt is 500, so R is 2 * 500 = 1000 Ohms. So option E is 1000 Ohms.

But wait, looking back at the options, E is 1000. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, I might have confused the formula. Another way: R is given by R = (2 * sqrt(L C )) / something? Wait, no.

Wait, let's think of the standard formula again. The damping ratio, ζ, for a series RLC circuit is given by ζ = (R)/(2√(L C)).

Oh wait, that's a different approach. For critical damping, ζ=1.

So R = 2 ζ √(L C).

Since ζ=1, R=2 * √(L C).

Wait, that's different than what I thought earlier. Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier in the formula.

Wait, so let me redo it.

The damping ratio ζ is given by:

ζ = R/(2 * sqrt(L C)).

So, for critical damping, ζ=1.

So,

1 = R/(2 * sqrt(L C)) → R = 2 * sqrt(L C).

So R=2 * sqrt( L * C )

So now plugging in L=0.2 H and C=0.8e-6 F.

Compute L*C = 0.2 * 0.8e-6 = 0.16e-6 = 1.6e-7.

sqrt(L*C) = sqrt(1.6e-7) = sqrt(1.6)*1e-3.5 ≈ 1.2649 * 3.1623e-4 → Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 1.6e-7, so sqrt(1.6e-7) = sqrt(1.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.2649 * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is approx 3.16e-4.

So 1.2649 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 0.0003998 ≈ 3.998e-4.

Wait, let me calculate that properly.

Wait, sqrt(1.6) is approximately 1.2649. sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 1e-3.5 = 3.16227766e-4.

So multiply 1.2649 * 3.16227766e-4 → 1.2649 * 3.1623e-4 = approx 0.0003998.

So sqrt(L*C)=approx 0.0003998 (Ohms squared? No, units are Ohms (since R is in Ohms, but units are a bit tricky here, but let's proceed.)

So R= 2 * 0.0003998 = approximately 0.0007996 Ohms. Wait, that's 0.7996 mOhms, which is way smaller than the options given. That can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, so I think I got the formula wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should go back. Another approach: the characteristic equation is r² + (R/L) r + (1/(LC)) =0. The discriminant is (R²)/(L²) - 4*(1/(LC)).

Setting to zero: (R²)/(L²) = 4/(LC).

R² = (4 L²)/(LC) ) → R² = (4 L) / C → R= sqrt(4 L/(C)) ) → R= 2 * sqrt(L/(C)).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So with L=0.2 H, C=0.8e-6 F.

So L/C is (0.2)/(0.8e-6) = 250,000.

So sqrt(L/C)=500.

R= 2 * 500 = 1000 Ohms.

Which is option E, 1000 Ohms.

But wait, earlier when I thought ζ =1, I got R= 2*sqrt(L*C), which would be 2 * sqrt(0.2 * 0.8e-6) = 2 * sqrt(1.6e-7) → sqrt(1.6e-7)= ~0.0003998 (ohms?), so R= ~0.0007996 Ohms, which is way too low and not among the options.

So that must mean the correct formula is R=2*sqrt(L/C), which gives 1000 Ohms, option E.

But wait, the problem is that when I plug in the numbers, I get R=1000 Ohms, which is option E. But the options include 1000 as E, so that must be the correct answer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me make sure.

Wait, another source says that for critical damping, the condition is (R^2)/(4 L C) = 1 → R= 2 sqrt( L C )

Wait, no, that can't be because that would give R= 2*sqrt( (0.2 * 0.8e-6) )= 2 * sqrt(1.6e-7)= 2 * 0.0003998 ≈ 0.0007996 Ohms, which is about 0.7996 milliohms, which is way too low. So that can't be right.

So perhaps I should rely on the first formula. The formula when discriminant is zero gives R=2 * sqrt(L/C).

So with L=0.2 H and C=0.8e-6 F,

L/C = 0.2 / 0.8e-6 = 250,000.

sqrt(250,000)=500.

R=2 *500=1000 Ohms. So option E is correct.

So the answer is E: 1000 Ohms.

To determine the resistance \( R \) required for the given series \( RLC \) circuit to be critically damped, we use the condition for critical damping, where the discriminant of the characteristic equation is zero. The characteristic equation for a series \( RLC \) circuit is:

\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \frac{R}{L} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{1}{LC} x = 0
\]

The characteristic equation is:

\[
r^2 + \frac{R}{L} r + \frac{1}{LC} = 0
\]

For critical damping, the discriminant \( D \) of this quadratic equation must be zero:

\[
D = \left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{LC} = 0
\]

Substituting the discriminant condition:

\[
\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{LC}
\]

Rearranging for \( R^2 \):

\[
R^2 = \frac{4L}{C}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
R = \sqrt{\frac{4L}{C}} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
\]

Now, substituting the given values \( L = 0.2 \, \text{H} \) and \( C = 0.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \):

\[
\frac{L}{C} = \frac{0.2}{0.8 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{0.2}{0.0000008} = 250,000
\]

\[
\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} = \sqrt{250,000} = 500
\]

\[
R = 2 \cdot 500 = 1000 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the resistance \( R \) required for critical damping is \( 1000 \, \Omega \), which corresponds to option **E**.
