Okay, so I have this question about fatty acids being transported into the mitochondria. Hmm, I remember that mitochondria have a lot to do with energy production. Oh right, the process is called the citric acid cycle or the TCA cycle, and it's all about converting acetyl-CoA into ATP.

Wait, the question is about where fatty acids are transported once they're formed. I think fatty acids are a type of acetyl-CoA. So they enter the mitochondria. Now, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. I remember that before the TCA cycle, fatty acids are broken down into acetyl-CoA, which are then used in the TCA cycle.

But how are the acetyl-CoA transported? Oh, right! The mitochondria have a transport system called the intermembrane space. Acetyl-CoA enters this space. Once inside, it's bound to a molecule that helps it enter the matrix. What's that? Oh yeah, carnitine. Carnitine is an energy carrier that helps acetyl-CoA enter the mitochondrial matrix.

Wait, what about the options given? Let me look again. The options are A through J. Option A is carnitine. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. So fatty acids are bound to carnitine in the mitochondria. So the correct answer should be A.

Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria by being bound to carnitine. This is part of the process where acetyl-CoA enters the matrix of mitochondria. 

Answer: A
