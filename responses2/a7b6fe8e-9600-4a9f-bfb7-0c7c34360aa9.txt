Okay, so I have this logarithm problem to solve. The question is asking for the value of b in the equation log base b of 343 equals -3/2. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the logarithm log_b(a) = c means that b raised to the power of c gives a. So in this case, log_b(343) = -3/2 would imply that b^(-3/2) = 343. Wait, but negative exponents can be a bit confusing. So, b^(-3/2) is the same as 1 divided by b^(3/2). So, that's 1 over (b^(3/2)) equals 343.

Now, I need to solve for b. Let me rewrite the equation:

1/(b^(3/2)) = 343

That means that b^(3/2) must be equal to 1/343. So, b^(3/2) = 1/343.

I can rewrite 343 as 7^3 because 7 * 7 is 49, and 49 *7 is 343. So, 343 is 7 cubed. So, 1/343 is 1/(7^3) which is (1/7)^3. So, now the equation becomes:

b^(3/2) = (1/7)^3

Hmm, I need to solve for b. Let me think about how to get b from here. Since the exponent on the left is 3/2 and on the right it's 3, maybe I can raise both sides to the reciprocal of 3/2, which is 2/3. That way, the exponent on the left would become 1, leaving b, and on the right, (1/7)^3 raised to the 2/3 power.

So, let's do that:

b = [ (1/7)^3 ]^(2/3)

Using exponent rules, when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So, 3 * (2/3) is 2. So, this becomes:

b = (1/7)^2

Which is 1 squared over 7 squared. 1 squared is 1, and 7 squared is 49. So, 1/49.

Wait, but let me double-check. If b is 1/49, then b^(3/2) should be 343. Let's compute (1/49)^(3/2). The square root of 1/49 is 1/7, because sqrt(1/49) is 1/7. Then, (1/7) cubed is 1/343. So, yes, that's correct because 1/(1/343) is 343.

But wait, looking back at the options given, option F is 7, and option B is 1/49. So, according to my calculation, b is 1/49, which is option B. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent rules.

Wait, another approach: Let me express both sides in terms of exponents of 7. Since 343 is 7^3, and the equation is b^(-3/2) = 343 = 7^3. So, taking both sides to the power of negative 2/3:

b = (7^3)^(-2/3)

Which is 7^(3 * (-2/3)) = 7^(-2) = 1/7^2 = 1/49. Yep, same result.

So, the correct answer should be option B: 1/49.
</think>

The equation is $\log_{b}343 = -\frac{3}{2}$. Converting this to exponential form gives $b^{-3/2} = 343$. Since $343 = 7^3$, we have $b^{-3/2} = 7^3$. Raising both sides to the power of $-2/3$ yields $b = (7^3)^{-2/3} = 7^{-2} = \frac{1}{49}$. Thus, the correct answer is option B: $\frac{1}{49}$.

Answer: B
