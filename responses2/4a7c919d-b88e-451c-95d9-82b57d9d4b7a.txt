Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about babbling and what it includes. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question asks about the last character of the answer, so I need to pick the correct option and make sure it's the right letter. The options are A through J. Let's see what each option says.

First, I remember that babbling is a language learning process. It starts around 4-5 months, and the first sounds are phonemes from the child's native language. So the initial part of babbling is from the child's own language. That makes me think option A says phonemes from the child’s native language only. So A might be the right answer.

But wait, I should make sure. Let me go through each option. Option B says phonemes from the most frequently spoken language. Well, the mother's speech might influence the child, but the baby's native sounds are more important. So B might not be correct because it's more about the child's own sounds.

Option C says phonemes specific to the child's location. I'm not sure about this. Geographical location might affect what sounds are common, but the baby's native sounds are the starting point. So C might not be correct.

Option D talks about phonemes from the parents' native language. That's probably not right either because the baby's own sounds are the foundation.

Option E says morphemes from the child's location. Morphemes are different from phonemes. Morphemes are more about the structure of words, like the 'ing' in 'cat'. So this is probably not correct.

Option F is about phonemes that are easiest for the child to produce. That's more about the child's ability, not the initial sounds.

Option G: morphemes from all languages. That doesn't make sense. Morphemes are language-specific, not all languages.

Option H: morphemes from the child's native language. Again, morphemes are language-specific, so this is incorrect.

Option I says words from the child's heard most frequently. That's about the words, not the sounds. So this is about the words, not the phonemes.

Option J: phonemes from all languages. No, that's not right because it's only the child's own sounds.

So going back, the initial sounds of babbling, the first part, starts with the child's own native language sounds. So the correct answer should be A: phonemes from the child’s native language only.

The correct answer is A: phonemes from the child’s native language only.

Answer: A
