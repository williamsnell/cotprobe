Okay, so I have this question about analog-to-digital converters and sampling rates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the bandwidth of an analog signal is 4kHz. They're using an A/D converter to convert it. And the question is about the minimum sampling rate to eliminate aliasing. Oh right, aliasing happens when you sample a signal at a rate lower than the Nyquist rate, right?

Wait, the Nyquist theorem says that the sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal. So for a signal with a maximum frequency of 4kHz, the Nyquist rate is 8kHz. So the minimum sampling rate without aliasing should be 8kHz.

Looking at the options, option E is 8. So that should be the correct answer.

The minimum sampling rate to eliminate aliasing is determined by the Nyquist theorem, which requires the sampling rate to be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal. For a 4kHz signal, the Nyquist rate is 8kHz. Therefore, the correct answer is E: 8.

Answer: E
