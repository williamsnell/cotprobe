Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about which quantity decreases as the inverse square of distance when you're far from the sources. The options are A through G.

Let me start by recalling what I know about electric and magnetic fields. The inverse square law is something I've heard about before. I remember that Coulomb's law describes the electric field around a point charge. The electric field E from a point charge Q is given by E = kQ/r², where r is the distance from the charge. So that's an inverse square relation. But wait, wait, there are other charges or distributions, like along a wire or in a loop, so perhaps the field isn't the same as the point charge.

The question is about which of these quantities (A to G) decreases as 1/r². The options include electric fields from different sources, like a charged rod, infinite plane of charge, or a charged cylinder. Magnetic fields, on the other hand, include infinite planes magnetized, infinite loops, etc.

So the question is about the field's dependence—like, for example, the electric field from a long charged wire would fall off as 1/r, not inverse square. Because the electric field from a line of charge goes as 1/r; the magnetic field from a long straight wire goes as 1/r as well, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the magnetic field from a long straight wire is actually a circular field, and it's proportional to 1/r. Wait, but the magnetic field from a current loop (option C) is B= (μ₀ I)/(2r²), so that's inverse square.

So, the question is asking which of these is a field that decreases as 1/r² for large distances. So let me go through each option.

Option A: Magnetic field from an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire. That's the same wire as in option C. The magnetic field around it is B = (μ₀ I)/(2π r), so it's proportional to 1/r, not 1/r². So A's field decreases as 1/r, not inverse square. So this can't be the answer.

Option B: Magnetic field from a finite-length wire. I'm not too sure about the exact dependence, but I think for a finite-length wire, the field doesn't fall off as 1/r², but maybe it does as 1/r for some regions. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's circular and the dependence is different. Wait, when the distance is much larger than the length of the wire, the field behaves as if the wire were infinitely long. So perhaps for large r, it's approximately the same as A. So the field would still go as 1/r, not 1/r². So option B's field doesn't decrease as 1/r². So B is not the answer.

Option C: Magnetic field from a current loop. As I thought earlier, the field falls off as 1/r². So this fits the condition.

Option D: Electric field from a finite-length charged rod. For a finite-length rod, the electric field strength varies with position. The field doesn't fall off as 1/r²; it's more like 1/r for points far from the ends. Because the electric field from a finite rod depends on the distance from the rod, and the formula might involve terms like 1/r, not inverse square. So D's field doesn't fit.

Option E: Magnetic field from a uniformly magnetized infinite plane. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the magnetic field outside an infinite magnetized plane is uniform, like B = μ₀ M, which is a constant, not varying with distance. So E's field doesn't depend on r; it's a constant. So it doesn't decrease as 1/r². So E isn't the answer.

Option F: Electric field from an infinite plane of charge. The electric field from an infinite plane is E = σ/(2ε₀), which is a constant; it doesn't change with distance. So F's field is independent of r, so it's not 1/r². So F isn't the answer.

Option G: Electric field from an infinitely long charged cylinder. The electric field around a cylinder is not as straightforward as a line or a ring. Wait, I think the formula for an infinite cylinder is E = (λ)/(2π ε₀ r), where λ is the charge per unit length. So E is proportional to 1/r, not 1/r². So G's field doesn't fit.

Wait, but wait a second—what about the magnetic field from a current loop? Oh, that's option C. So the magnetic field from a current loop (like a solenoid or a ring) is B = μ₀ I / (2r²), which is 1/r squared. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but I remember also that the electric field from a long charged cylinder is E= (λ)/(2π ε₀ r), which is 1/r, so that's not 1/r². So the only option that's 1/r² is option C.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine which quantity decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields, we analyze each option:

1. **Option A: Magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire**  
   The magnetic field around an infinitely long wire is given by \( B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r} \), which is inversely proportional to \( r \), not \( r^2 \). Thus, this does not fit the condition.

2. **Option B: Magnetic field produced by a finite-length current-carrying wire**  
   For a finite-length wire, the magnetic field does not fall off as \( 1/r^2 \) in the far distance limit. Instead, it behaves like \( 1/r \) for points far from the ends of the wire. Therefore, this does not fit.

3. **Option C: Magnetic field produced by a current loop**  
   The magnetic field at a distance \( r \) from a current loop is \( B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2r^2} \), which is inversely proportional to \( r^2 \). This fits the condition perfectly.

4. **Option D: Electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod**  
   The electric field from a finite-length rod varies with position and does not fall off as \( 1/r^2 \) for large distances. It typically behaves as \( 1/r \) in certain regions.

5. **Option E: Magnetic field produced by a uniformly magnetized infinite plane**  
   The magnetic field outside a uniformly magnetized infinite plane is uniform and does not depend on distance. Thus, it does not decrease as \( 1/r^2 \).

6. **Option F: Electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge**  
   The electric field from an infinite plane of charge is uniform and independent of distance, so it does not decrease as \( 1/r^2 \).

7. **Option G: Electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder**  
   The electric field around an infinitely long charged cylinder is \( E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi \epsilon_0 r} \), which is inversely proportional to \( r \), not \( r^2 \). Thus, this does not fit.

After evaluating all options, the only quantity that decreases as the inverse square of distance for large distances is the magnetic field produced by a current loop.
