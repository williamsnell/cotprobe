Okay, so I have this problem about a function f(x) that's strictly convex. The problem says that for any two points a and b where a < b, the portion of the graph between them lies below the line segment connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). That makes sense because strictly convex functions have that property. So, I need to find the range of possible values for f(1), given that the function passes through (-2,5) and (2,9). 

Hmm, let's think about what strictly convex means. A function is strictly convex if the line segment between any two points on the function lies entirely above the function, except at the endpoints. So, for any a and b, the function f(x) lies below the line connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, if a function is strictly convex, then the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. Because if it were lying below, then the function would be concave. So, I think I had it backwards initially. So, strictly convex functions have the line segment between any two points on the function lying above the function. That's the key here.

So, given that f(-2) = 5 and f(2) = 9, and the function is strictly convex, we need to find the possible values for f(1).

Let me recall the condition for a function being strictly convex. I think it involves the second derivative being positive everywhere, but maybe there's a way to express this without calculus.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the concept of the chord slope. For two points a and b, the slope of the line connecting them is (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a). Since the function is strictly convex, the function lies below this chord, so perhaps this gives us a condition on the function's growth rate.

Wait, maybe I should use the definition of strictly convex. For any a < b, we have f((a + b)/2) < (f(a) + f(b))/2. Because the function lies below the chord. So, that means the function's value at the midpoint is less than the average of the function values at the endpoints. That's a key property.

So, applying this to the points a = -2, b = 2. The midpoint is 0, so f(0) < (f(-2) + f(2))/2. Let me compute that: (5 + 9)/2 = 14/2 =7. So f(0) <7.

But wait, that's just a specific point. I need to find f(1). Maybe I can use the condition for another interval.

Let me consider the points a = -2, b =1. The midpoint is (-2 +1)/2 = -0.5. Then, f(-0.5) < (f(-2) + f(1))/2. Similarly, for a =1 and b=2, the midpoint is 1.5, so f(1.5) < (f(1) + f(2))/2.

But I need to find f(1). Maybe I need to set up inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use linear interpolation between the points. But I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: for strictly convex functions, we can model the function as a quadratic function. Because quadratic functions are strictly convex if the coefficient of x² is positive. Let's try that.

Let me assume f(x) is a quadratic function. So, f(x) = ax² + bx + c. We know that f(-2) =5 and f(2)=9.

So, plugging in x=-2: a*(-2)^2 + b*(-2) + c =5 → 4a - 2b + c =5.

x=2: a*(2)^2 + b*(2) + c =9 →4a + 2b + c =9.

Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (4a + 2b + c) - (4a - 2b + c) =9-5 →4b =4 → b=1.

So, b=1. Now, plug back into one of the equations, say the first one: 4a -2*1 +c =5 →4a +c =7.

But with this, we have two variables, a and c. So, we need another condition. Hmm. Since the function is strictly convex, and we have two points, perhaps the condition is that the function is strictly convex, so the quadratic must have a positive leading coefficient.

But wait, if it's a quadratic function, let's see: f(x) = a x² + x + c. The leading coefficient is a, which must be positive for strict convexity.

But without another condition, we can't determine a and c uniquely. So, perhaps I should instead approach this using the convexity condition.

Wait, but f(x) is strictly convex, so for all a < b, the function lies below the chord. So, for any a and b, f(x) ≤ (f(a) + f(b))/(b - a) * (x - a) + f(a) for a < x < b.

Wait, no, I think I should use the definition. Let's denote for a = -2, b=2: the function at the midpoint x=0 must be less than the average of f(-2) and f(2). So, we have f(0) < (5 +9)/2 =7.

But we need f(1). Let's see if we can relate f(1) to other points.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of convexity for linear functions. Wait, but convexity for a function is a bit different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model f(x) as a convex function with known points. Since we know two points, (-2,5) and (2,9), and the function is strictly convex, we can use the fact that the function is above the line connecting these two points. Wait, wait, no: strictly convex functions have the line segment between any two points lying above the function. Wait, earlier I got confused, but let's double-check.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: For a convex function, the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think again.

Wait, no, correction: For convex (concave up) functions, the line segment between two points lies above the function. Wait, no, sorry, I think I've got this mixed up. Let me think again. If you have a convex function, the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. So, if the function is convex, then for any a < b, f((a + b)/2) ≤ (f(a) + f(b))/2. Wait, no, that can't be right because for concave functions, the line lies below. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me get this straight. For a convex function, the function lies below the line segment connecting any two points. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the line segment connecting two points on a convex function lies above the function. Let me search my memory.

Wait, convex functions are those where the line segment between any two points lies above the function. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, in general, for convex functions, the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. For example, the parabola y = x² is convex. If you pick two points on it, say at x=0 (y=0) and x=2 (y=4), the line connecting them would be a straight line from (0,0) to (2,4). The function at x=1 is 1, which is below the line y = 2x. So, for the function y=x², the line segment lies above the function. So, in this case, for convex functions, the line segment lies above the function.

Wait, but the function itself is below the line segment. Wait, no, in the example, the function's value at x=1 (which is 1) is less than the value of the line at x=1 (which is 2). So, the function lies below the line segment between the two points. So, for a convex function, the function lies below the chord connecting the two points. So, strictly convex functions have this property.

So, for a strictly convex function, the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. So, in this problem, given that f is strictly convex, and passes through (-2,5) and (2,9), which are two points. So, for any a < b, the function is below the line segment between (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)).

Wait, so let's model this. Let's think about the line connecting (-2,5) and (2,9). What's the equation of this line? Let's compute the slope: m = (9 -5)/(2 - (-2)) =4/4=1. So, the equation is y -5 =1*(x +2) → y = x +7.

So, the line is y = x +7. Now, since f is strictly convex, the function lies below this line between any two points. So, for any x between -2 and 2, f(x) ≤ x +7.

Wait, but in our problem, we are to find f(1). So, if I can find the maximum possible value of f(1), given that f is strictly convex and passes through (-2,5) and (2,9), then the range would be up to that maximum.

Wait, but since f is strictly convex, the function lies below the line segment between (-2,5) and (2,9). So, f(1) must be less than the value of the line at x=1, which is y=1 +7=8. So, f(1) <8.

But wait, the function passes through (-2,5) and (2,9), so f(1) is between 5 and 9, but due to the convexity, it can't exceed 8. So, the maximum possible f(1) is less than 8. So, f(1) <8.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the maximum possible value for f(1) in the options is 9, but the correct maximum is 8. So, the range of f(1) is (-inf, 8). So, looking at the options, J is (-inf,8). So, the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait a second, another approach: using the condition for convexity. For a function to be strictly convex, the second derivative should be positive everywhere. But since we don't have the function's expression, maybe we can use the concept of supporting lines.

Wait, let's think about the function f(x) at x=1. Since f is strictly convex, the tangent line at any point lies below the function. Alternatively, the function's value at 1 should be less than the average of the values at -2 and 2, but that's only for linear functions. Wait, but in the case of strictly convex functions, the function lies below the chord between any two points, so perhaps f(1) is less than the average of f(-2) and f(2) which is (5+9)/2=7. But earlier, from the line connecting (-2,5) and (2,9), we found f(1) <8. So, which is it?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine this.

The function is strictly convex, so the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. So, for the two points (-2,5) and (2,9), the line connecting them is y = x +7. So, for any x between -2 and 2, f(x) ≤ x +7.

But at x=1, f(1) ≤1+7=8.

But wait, wait. Wait, if f(x) ≤x +7 for all x between -2 and 2, that includes x=1, so f(1) ≤8. So, the maximum value f(1) can take is 8, but the function could approach 8 but not reach it. So, the range is (-inf,8).

Wait, but wait, that's conflicting with the earlier thought that f(1) <7 because of the midpoint condition. Hmm, maybe I got the conditions mixed up.

Wait, let me think again. For strictly convex functions, the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. So, for points (-2,5) and (2,9), the line is y =x +7. So, for any x between -2 and 2, f(x) ≤ x +7. Therefore, at x=1, f(1) ≤1 +7=8. So, f(1) can't be more than 8. So, the maximum possible value is 8, but the function could approach 8 but not reach it. So, the range is (-inf,8).

Wait, but wait, that's conflicting with another approach. Wait, let's think again: for strictly convex functions, the function lies below the chord. So, the chord between (-2,5) and (2,9) is y =x +7. So, for any x between -2 and 2, f(x) ≤x +7. So, at x=1, f(1) ≤8. So, f(1) can be as high as approaching 8 from the lower side, but can't be equal to 8. So, the maximum is 8, but the function can't reach 8. So, the range is (-inf,8).

Wait, but the function's slope at x=1 must be increasing since it's strictly convex. So, the function's slope at x=1 is greater than the slope at x=-2 and x=2.

Wait, the slope between (-2,5) and (2,9) is 1, as calculated before. So, the function's slope at x=1 must be greater than 1 because the function is strictly convex. So, for x=1, the slope is f'(1) >1.

Wait, but how does that affect f(1) given that the function is below the line y =x +7? Let's think about it.

The function at x=1 could be as high as 8, but no higher. So, the maximum possible value is 8, but maybe lower. Wait, perhaps f(1) is between 5 and 8, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the function is a straight line between (-2,5) and (2,9), the slope is 1, and at x=1, it would be y=1+7=8. But since the function is strictly convex, perhaps the function's value at x=1 must be less than 8.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me try a different approach. Let's model the function as a quadratic, as I thought earlier.

Assume f(x) = a x² + b x + c.

We have f(-2)=5: a*(-2)^2 + b*(-2) + c =4a -2b +c=5.

f(2)=9: a*(2)^2 + b*2 +c=4a +2b +c=9.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (4a +2b +c) - (4a -2b +c) = 4b =4 →b=1.

So, b=1.

Now, substituting back into the first equation: 4a -2*1 +c=5 →4a +c=7.

We need another condition to find a and c. Since the function is strictly convex, the second derivative is positive. The second derivative of a quadratic is 2a, so 2a >0 →a>0.

But we don't know the value of a. The problem doesn't give us another point, so perhaps we can't determine a and c uniquely. So, perhaps the maximum value for f(1) occurs when a is as large as possible, making f(1) as large as possible.

Wait, but how? Let's compute f(1):

f(1) =a*(1)^2 +1*(1) +c =a +1 +c.

But from earlier, 4a +c=7 →c=7 -4a.

So, f(1)=a +1 + (7 -4a)= a +8 -4a = -3a +8.

Since a>0, the maximum of f(1) occurs when a is as small as possible. Because as a decreases, f(1) increases. The smallest a can be is approaching zero, making f(1) approach 8. But since a must be positive, f(1) can approach 8 but can't reach it. Therefore, the maximum possible value for f(1) is 8, but not including 8.

Wait, but wait, if a approaches zero, then f(x) approaches a linear function with slope 1, so f(1) approaches 8. So, the maximum f(1) can be is 8, but doesn't reach it. So, the range is (-infinity,8), which is option J.

But earlier, I thought that f(1) must be less than 7 because of the midpoint, but that was under a different condition. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, let's double-check. The function's midpoint is at x=0, and f(0) < (f(-2) + f(2))/2 = (5+9)/2=7. So, f(0) <7. But f(1) can be higher than 7, as in the quadratic case, because f(1) approaches 8.

So, putting it all together, f(1) can be as high as approaching 8, but can't reach it. Therefore, the range is (-infinity,8), option J.

Wait, but another thought: if the function is strictly convex, could the function be above the chord? No, strictly convex functions lie below the chord. So, the function's value at x=1 must be less than the value of the line connecting (-2,5) and (2,9) at x=1, which is 1 +7=8. So, f(1) <8. Hence, the range is (-infinity,8), option J.
</think>

The function $f(x)$ is strictly convex, passing through $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$. For strictly convex functions, the line segment between any two points lies above the function. The line connecting $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ has the equation $y = x + 7$. At $x = 1$, this line gives $y = 8$. Since $f(x)$ is strictly convex, $f(1) < 8$. Thus, the range of $f(1)$ is $(-\infty, 8)$, corresponding to option J.
