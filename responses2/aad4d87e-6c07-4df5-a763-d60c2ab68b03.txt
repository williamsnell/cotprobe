Okay, so I've got this problem about Pallas's orbit, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. The question gives me the orbital period and the eccentricity, and I need to find the semi-major axis. Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws have something to do with orbits and their periods. But wait, I think the formula involves the gravitational constant and the mass of the Sun, right?

Oh wait, Kepler's third law! So the formula is (a^3)/(T^2) = (G*M)/(4π²), where a is the semi-major axis, T is the period, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the Sun. But wait, the problem gives me the period in years and asks for the semi-major axis in 10^11 m units. I think I should convert the period into seconds because the standard form uses SI units.

So, the period T is 4.62 years. How many seconds is that? Well, a year is about 365.25 days, each day has 24 hours, each hour 60 minutes, each minute 60 seconds. Let me calculate that. 

T = 4.62 years * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 min/hour *60 s/min. Let me compute that step by step. 

4.62 * 365.25 = let's see. 4 * 365 is 1460, 0.62 *365 is about 226.3. So 1460 +226.3 = 1686.3, plus 0.25*365.25 is ~91.31, so total T is 1686.3 +91.31 = 1777.61 days.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4.62 * 365.25 = 4 * 365.25 is 1461, 0.62 *365.25 is about 226.185. So 1461 + 226.185 = 1687.185 days approximately. Hmm, but wait, actually, 4.62 * 365.25 is easier to compute as 4.62 * 365 + 4.62 * 0.25.

4.62 * 365 = let's compute 4 *365 is 1460, 0.62 *365 is 226.3 → 1460+226.3 = 1686.3. Then 4.62 *0.25 is 1.155. So total 1686.3 +1.155= 1687.455 days.

So T is 1687.455 days. Convert that to seconds: 1687.455 days * 24 h/day = 40,501.08 hours. Then 40,501.08 *60 min/hour = 2,430,064.8 minutes. Multiply by 60 s/min: 2,430,064.8 *60 = 145,803,888 seconds. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 day = 86400 seconds. So 1687.455 days * 86400 s/day. Let's compute that: 1687.455 * 86400. Let me do 1687 *86400 first. 1687 * 86400 = (1700 -13) *86400. Let's compute 1700 *86400 = 1700 *8.64e4 = 1.476e8 * 1e4? Wait, no, 1700 *86400 = 1700 * 8.64e4 → 8.64e4 *1700 = 8.64 *1700e4. 1700 is 1.7e3, so 8.64 *1.7e3 = 14.688e3 *e4 → 14.688e7 → 1.4688e8? Wait, perhaps I should compute 1687.455 *86400.

Wait, perhaps a calculator approach would be better, but perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Wait, another way: 1687.455 days * 86400 s/day.

1687.455 * 86400 = (I'll compute 1687 * 86400 first, then 0.455...)

1687 * 86400 = 1687 * 8.64e4.

Wait, 1687 * 8.64e4 = (1700 -13) *8.64e4 → 1700 *8.64e4 = 1700 *864e3 = maybe better to compute 1687 *86400.

Alternatively, 1687 *86400 = 1687 *8.64e4 → but perhaps it's easier to compute as 1687 *86400 = 1687 * 864 * 100.

Wait, 864 *1687 = let's compute 1687 *800 = 1,350,000; 1687 *60= 101,220; 1687 *4=6,748. Adding them up: 1,350,000 + 101,220 = 1,451,220; +6,748 → 1,457,968. Then multiply by 100 (since 86400 is 864*100) → 145,796,800. Then add the 0.455 part: 0.455 *86400 = 39,312. So the total is 145,796,800 +39,312 = 145,836,112 seconds. Wait, that can’t be right because 1687.455 days is about 1687 *86400= 1.4687e8 seconds, perhaps I'm getting more precise numbers but maybe I should proceed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the period in seconds by T =4.62 *365.25 *24 *3600. Oh wait, another approach is to note that 1 year is approximately 3.15576e7 seconds. So 4.62 years would be 4.62 *3.15576e7 seconds.

Let me compute that: 4.62 *3.15576e7 = ?

3.15576e7 is 31,557,600 seconds per year. So 4.62 *31,557,600.

4 *31,557,600 = 126,230,400.

0.62 *31,557,600: Let's compute 0.6 *31,557,600 = 18,934,560. 0.02 *31,557,600 =631,152. So total 18,934,560 +631,152 =19,565,712.

So total T is 126,230,400 +19,565,712 =145,796,112 seconds. Oh, which matches the earlier calculation. So T is approximately 1.45796e8 seconds.

Now, the next step is to use Kepler's third law. The formula is:

a^3 = (G*M*T²)/(4π²)

But wait, G is the gravitational constant, which is 6.67430e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2. The mass of the Sun, M, is about 1.9885e30 kg.

So substituting the values:

a^3 = (G*M*T²) / (4 * π²)

I need to calculate that.

Let me plug in the numbers:

G = 6.6743e-11,
M = 1.9885e30,
T = 1.45796e8 seconds.

So compute numerator: G*M*T².

Compute T squared: (1.45796e8)^2 = (1.45796)^2 * 1e16.

1.45796 squared is approximately (1.45)^2=2.1025, but let's compute it accurately.

(1.45796)^2 = 1.45796 *1.45796.

Let me compute 1.45796 *1.45796:

1.45 *1.45 = 2.1025.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

1.45796 × 1.45796:

= (1 + 0.45796)^2
= 1² + 2*1*(0.45796) + (0.45796)^2
= 1 + 0.91592 + 0.20980
= approx 2.12572.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 1.45796 *1.45796 accurately:

Let me compute 1.45796 *1.45796.

First, 1.45 *1.45 = 2.1025.

Then, the decimal parts:

(1.45796)^2 = (1.45 + 0.00796)^2 = (1.45)^2 + 2*1.45*0.00796 + (0.00796)^2.

= 2.1025 + 2*(0.011582) + 0.00006336.

= 2.1025 + 0.023164 + 0.00006336≈ 2.125727.

So T squared is approximately 2.125727e16 s².

Now, numerator: G*M*T² = (6.6743e-11) * (1.9885e30) * (2.125727e16) 

Let me compute step by step.

First, G*M =6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = let's compute 6.6743 *1.9885 = approx 13.27. So 13.27e(30-11) =13.27e19.

So G*M=1.327e20 m³/s².

Wait, 6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = (6.6743 * 1.9885) e ( -11 +30 ) = 13.27e19 =1.327e20.

Then, multiply by T squared (2.125727e16): 

(1.327e20) * (2.125727e16) = 1.327 *2.125727e(20+16) = approx 2.819e36.

Wait, compute 1.327 *2.125727 → 1.327*2 = 2.654, 1.327 *0.125727 ≈ 0.1666 (since 0.125727 *1.327 ≈ 0.1666). So total approx 2.8206e36.

So numerator is approximately 2.8206e36 m³.

Denominator: 4 * π² → 4 * (9.8696) → approx 39.4784.

So a³ = numerator / denominator = (2.8206e36) / 39.4784 ≈ (2.8206 /39.4784) *1e36.

2.8206 /39.4784 → approx 0.07148.

So a³ ≈ 0.07148e36 =7.148e34 m³.

So a = cube root of 7.148e34 m³.

Cube root of 1e34 is 1e11.333... because 1e11 is (1e11)^3 =1e33, 1e34 is 1e33 *10 → cube root is 1e11 * cube root(10) ≈ 1e11 *2.15443469.

So cube root of 7.148e34 is cube_root(7.148) * cube_root(1e34) → cube_root(7.148) is about 1.93 (since 1.93^3≈7.14). 

So a≈1.93 * (1e11 *2.15443469) → 1.93 *2.154e11 ≈4.16e11 meters.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it numerically.

Compute cube root of 7.148e34. Alternatively, since 1e34 is (1e11.333)^3. So cube root of 1e34 is 1e11.333.

Because 1e34 = (1e11.333)^3. So 1e11.333 is about 2.154e11.

So cube root of 7.148e34 = cube_root(7.148) * 1e11.333.

Cube_root(7.148) ≈ 1.93, since 2^3 is 8, which is a bit higher. 1.93^3 = (1.93)^2 = 3.7249 *1.93 ≈ 7.18, which is a bit higher than 7.148. So maybe approximately 1.929.

So a =1.929 * 2.154e11 → 1.929 *2.154e11 → approximately 4.15e11 meters.

Wait, but wait, in the options, option C is 6.25e11, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait, let's go through the steps again. Maybe I messed up a calculation or unit conversion.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula a^3 = (G*M*(T/(2π))^2 )

Wait, no, the formula is a^3 = (G*M*T²)/(4π²). So let's re-calculate using exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the period into years first, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: Use the formula a^3 = (P^2 * G * M) / (4π²), but P in seconds. We already did that.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of T^2. Let me recheck the T.

Wait, 4.62 years is 4.62 *365.25 days = 1687.455 days. 1687.455 days * 86400 s/day = 145,803,888 s.

So T=1.458e8 seconds. Correct.

So G*M =6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = (6.6743 *1.9885) * 1e19 = approx 13.27e19 =1.327e20 m³/s².

So G*M*T² =1.327e20 * (1.458e8)^2.

(1.458e8)^2 =2.125e16. So 1.327e20 *2.125e16 = 2.820e36 m³.

Then, a^3 =2.820e36 / (4 * π²) = 2.820e36 / (39.478) =7.14e34 m³.

So a= cube root(7.14e34) m.

Cube root of 7.14e34 = cube_root(7.14) * cube_root(1e34).

Cube_root(7.14) is approx 1.93.

Cube_root(1e34) is 1e34^(1/3) = 1e(34/3) =1e11.333.

Which is 2.1544e11 m.

So a≈1.93 * 2.1544e11 = approx 4.14e11 meters.

Looking back at the options, option C is 6.25e11, which is higher than my calculation. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: The formula is a^3 = (P^2 * G * M) / (4π²). Wait, but perhaps I should use the formula from the standard version, which is a³ = (P^2 * M) / (4π²) * (1/(G)) ? No, perhaps I did it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation using the formula a^3 = (P² * G * M) / (4π²).

Wait, another approach: I found a^3 = (G*M*T^2) / (4 π²) = (6.67e-11 *1.988e30 * (1.458e8)^2 ) / (4 * (9.87)).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, G*M =6.67e-11 *1.988e30 = (6.67 *1.988) * 1e( -11 +30 )= approx 13.27e19 =1.327e20 m³/s².

Then, T^2: (1.458e8)^2 =2.125e16 s².

So G*M*T²=1.327e20 *2.125e16 =2.820e36 m³.

Divide by 4π²: 4 * (9.8696) =39.4784.

So a^3=2.820e36 /39.4784=7.14e34 m³.

So a= cube root(7.14e34) = approx 4.16e11 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.25e11 m, which is higher than my result. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me compute the period once again.

Wait, 4.62 years: 4.62 *365.25 =1687.455 days. 

Convert days to seconds:1687.455 *86400 =145,803,888 seconds. Correct.

Compute a^3 = (G*M*T²) / (4π²) = (6.6743e-11 * 1.9885e30 * (1.458e8)^2 ) / (4 * π²).

Let me compute G*M*T² numerically.

G*M =6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = let's compute 6.6743 *1.9885.

6.6743 *1.9885 =6.6743 *2 =13.3486 minus 6.6743 *0.0115.

6.6743 *0.0115 ≈0.07670.

So 13.3486 -0.07670=13.2719.

So G*M=13.2719e( -11 +30 )=13.2719e19=1.32719e20 m³/s².

Then, T squared is (1.458e8)^2=2.125e16 s².

Multiply G*M by T squared:1.32719e20 *2.125e16= (1.32719 *2.125) e(20+16)= approx 2.819e36.

Divide by 4π²: 4 * (π^2)=4 *9.8696=39.4784.

So a^3=2.819e36 / 39.4784= approx 7.14e34 m³.

So a= cube root(7.14e34)= approximately 4.16e11 meters.

But looking at the options, option C is 6.25e11, which is larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the cube root. Let me compute cube_root(7.14e34).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using a calculator.

Compute cube_root(7.14e34) = cube_root(7.14) * cube_root(1e34).

Cube_root(7.14) ≈1.93, because 1.93^3=7.18.

Cube_root(1e34)=1e11.333.

So 1e11.333 is 2.154e11 m.

So a=1.93 *2.154e11 = approx 4.15e11 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have 4.15e11, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I computed the period in years instead of seconds.

Wait, 4.62 years is 4.62 years, but if I convert the period into seconds, that would change the result.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let me compute the period in seconds as I did before, 1.458e8 s.

Compute the semi-major axis using the formula:

a^3 = (G*M*T²) / (4 π²).

So let's recompute with the same data.

So a^3 = (6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 * (1.458e8)^2 ) / (4 * (3.1416)^2 )

Which is same as before.

So, a^3=7.14e34 m³.

a= cube_root(7.14e34) = approximately 4.16e11 m.

Wait, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. Using the formula a = ( ( G M )^(1/3) * T )^(1/ ( (4 π²) )^(1/3) )

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

a³ = ( (G M) (T²) ) / (4 π²) → a = [ (G M T²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of T in seconds.

Wait, T is 4.62 years. Let me compute that correctly.

4.62 years =4.62 * 365.25 days.

4.62 * 365.25 = let me compute this:

365.25 *4 =1461.

365.25 *0.62=226.0.75.

So 1461 +226.075=1687.075 days.

Convert days into seconds:1687.075 *86400= 1687.075 *8.64e4.

Compute 1687.075 *8.64e4:

Compute 1687.075 *8.64 = ?

Multiply 1687.075 by 8.64.

Breaking it down:

1687.075 *8 =13,500.000

1687.075 *0.64 = 1,078.128.

So 13,500.000 +1,078.128=14,578.128.

Multiply by 1e4:14,578.128e4=1.4578128e8 seconds.

Wait, no. Wait, 1687.075 *8.64e4 = (1687.075 *8.64) *1e4.

1687.075 *8.64 =14,578.128.

So 14,578.128 *1e4 =145,781,280 seconds.

Wait, earlier, when I computed 4.62 years in seconds as 1.458e8, but now I'm getting 1.458e8 *8.64e4? Wait, no, wait!

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of years to seconds.

Wait, 1 year is 365.25 days.

1 day is 86400 seconds.

So 1 year =365.25 *86400 =31,557,600 seconds.

So 4.62 years =4.62 *31,557,600 = let me compute that.

4.62 *31,557,600 = let me compute 4 *31,557,600=126,230,400.

0.62*31,557,600= approx 19,659,072.

So total is126,230,400 +19,659,072=145,889,472 seconds.

Wait, so earlier, I thought 4.62 years is 1.458e8 seconds, but now it's 1.4589e8, which is approximately 1.459e8 seconds.

Wait, so T=1.459e8 seconds.

Wait, this would change the calculation of a^3.

Wait, let me redo the calculation with T=1.459e8 s.

So G*M=6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30=1.327e20 m³/s².

T squared is (1.459e8)^2 =2.129e16 s².

So G*M*T²=1.327e20 *2.129e16=2.821e36 m³.

Divide by 4π²=39.4784.

So a^3=2.821e36 /39.4784=7.141e34 m³.

Cube root of 7.141e34: cube_root(7.141)≈1.93, cube_root(1e34)=2.154e11.

So a≈1.93 *2.154e11=4.15e11 m.

Hmm, same result as before.

But the options don't have 4.15e11. Let's check the options again:

Options are:

A)5.15e11

B)4.14e11

C)6.25e11

D)3.14e11.

Wait, option B is 4.14e11, which is close to our calculation of 4.15e11. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but why did I get 4.15e11 when using a period in years of 4.62 years? Because I must have made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the mistake I made earlier was converting 4.62 years into seconds as 1.458e8 seconds, which is correct, because 4.62 *31,557,600 =1.458e8.

But earlier, when I computed T in seconds as 1.459e8, it's correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B:4.14e11 m.

Wait, but why in the previous calculation with T=1.458e8, a^3=7.14e34, cube_root is approx 4.15e11.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But wait, perhaps I have made a mistake in the calculation of a^3.

Wait, let me compute a^3 = (G*M*T²)/(4π²).

So G*M*T² =6.67e-11 *1.988e30 * (1.458e8)^2 =6.67e-11 *1.988e30 *2.125e16.

Compute each step:

6.67e-11 *1.988e30 = (6.67 *1.988) *1e19 = approx 13.27 *1e19 =1.327e20.

1.327e20 *2.125e16 = (1.327 *2.125) *1e36 =2.819 *1e36=2.819e36.

Divide by 4π²=39.4784.

2.819e36 /39.4784=7.14e34.

Cube root of7.14e34 is cube_root(7.14) * cube_root(1e34) =approx 1.93 *2.154e11=4.15e11.

Hmm. So that's about 4.15e11, which is close to option B, which is 4.14e11.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier, I thought option C was 6.25e11, which is larger. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, another approach: using the formula a^3 = (P^2 * G * M) / (4 π²).

But perhaps using the formula in terms of the period in years.

Wait, I found a formula online which says a^3 = (P^2 * G * M) / (4 π²). But perhaps when I use P in years, the formula is a^3 = P^2 * (G * M) / (4 π²) * (1/( (1 year)^2 )).

Wait, perhaps I should use P in years to find a.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to use the formula a^3 = (P^2 * G * M) / (4 π²), where P is in seconds. Alternatively, using P in years.

Wait, here's a formula for a^3 when P is in years:

a³ = (P² * G * M) / (4 π²) / (1 year in seconds)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express everything in years.

Let me try that.

The formula when P is in years is:

a³ = (P² * G * M) / (4 π²) * (1 year in seconds)^2 )

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the formula in terms of P in years is:

a³ = (P² * G * M) / (4 π²) * (1 year in seconds)^2 )

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula a^3 = (P^2 * (G * M) ) / (4 π²).

But with P in seconds.

So in our case, P is 1.458e8 s.

So a^3 = (1.458e8)^2 * (6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30) ) / (4 π²).

Compute each part:

(1.458e8)^2 =2.125e16.

6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 =1.327e20.

Multiply by 2.125e16: 1.327e20 *2.125e16=2.820e36.

Divide by 4 π²=39.4784:2.820e36 /39.4784=7.14e34.

Cube root:4.15e11 m.

So the correct answer is 4.15e11 m, which is option B.

Wait, but why did I think of option C earlier? Because I thought 6.25e11 is 1.666e-1, which is much less than 4.15e11. So I think I confused myself earlier.

So the correct answer is option B, 4.14e11 m.

To determine the semi-major axis \( a \) of Pallas, we use the formula:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M T^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

Where:
- \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}/\text{s}^2 \) (gravitational constant),
- \( M = 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Sun),
- \( T \) is the orbital period in seconds.

### Step 1: Convert Orbital Period to Seconds
The orbital period is 4.62 years. Converting this to seconds:
\[
T = 4.62 \times 365.25 \times 86400 = 1.458 \times 10^8 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( G M \)
\[
G M = (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \times (1.9885 \times 10^{30}) = 1.327 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( T^2 \)
\[
T^2 = (1.458 \times 10^8)^2 = 2.125 \times 10^{16} \, \text{s}^2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( G M T^2 \)
\[
G M T^2 = (1.327 \times 10^{20}) \times (2.125 \times 10^{16}) = 2.820 \times 10^{36}
\]

### Step 5: Divide by \( 4 \pi^2 \)
\[
4 \pi^2 = 39.4784
\]
\[
\frac{G M T^2}{4 \pi^2} = \frac{2.820 \times 10^{36}}{39.4784} = 7.14 \times 10^{34}
\]

### Step 6: Take Cube Root
\[
a = \sqrt[3]{7.14 \times 10^{34}} = \sqrt[3]{7.14} \times \sqrt[3]{10^{34}}
\]

Since \( \sqrt[3]{7.14} \approx 1.93 \) and \( \sqrt[3]{10^{34}} = 10^{11.333} \approx 2.154 \times 10^{11} \):
\[
a \approx 1.93 \times 2.154 \times 10^{11} = 4.15 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The semi-major axis of Pallas is approximately \( 4.14 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
