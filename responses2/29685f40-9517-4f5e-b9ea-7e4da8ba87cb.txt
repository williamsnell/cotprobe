Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the frequency of light emitted by a helium-neon laser, which is 632.8 nm. The options are all in the 10^14 Hz range, so I think I'll use the speed of light and the wavelength to find frequency.

Wait, right, the formula is speed of light equals wavelength multiplied by frequency. Oh yeah, c = λν. So to find ν, I need to rearrange that. Oh right, ν = c / λ.

Wait, but what is the speed of light in a vacuum? I think it's approximately 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. But wait, the wavelength given is in nanometers. Because the units don't match, I need to convert nanometers to meters. Oh, because 1 meter is 1e9 nanometers. So 632.8 nm is 632.8e-9 meters.

So plugging into the formula: ν = (3.00e8 m/s) / (632.8e-9 m). Let me compute that. Let's see, 3.00e8 divided by 632.8e-9. Hmm. Let's do the numbers.

Wait, 632.8e-9 is the same as 6.328e-7 meters. So, 3e8 divided by 6.328e-7. Let's compute this:

3e8 / 6.328e-7 = (3 / 6.328) * e^(8 - (-7)) → 3 /6.328 is approximately 0.4737, and 8 +7 is 15. So 0.4737e15, which is 4.737e14 Hz. So approximately 4.737e14.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.738e14 Hz. Oh wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might miscalculate exponents.

Wait, 3e8 is 3x10^8. 632.8e-9 meters is 632.8 x 1e-9 = 6.328e-7. So when I divide, it's (3e8) / (6.328e-7) = (3 /6.328) x 10^(8 - (-7)) → 8 +7=15. So 3/6.328 is about 0.4737 → 0.4737e15 → 4.737e14. So that's 4.737 x 10^14 Hz.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.738e14, which is very close. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me see the other options. Option G is 5.5e14, which is higher. Option H is 6e14. So 4.73e14 is in between 4.73e14 and 4.74e14. Let me recheck the calculation in case I messed up the exponents.

Another way to approach it: 3e8 divided by 632.8e-9 → which is 3e8 / 632.8e-9. Let me compute this in scientific notation. 632.8e-9 is 6.328e-7. So 3e8 /6.328e-7 = (3 /6.328) * 1e(8 +7) → 1e15.

Wait, 3e8 → 3 * 1e8. 6.328e-7 → 6.328 * 1e-7. So when you divide, it's (3/6.328) * (1e8 / 1e-7) = (approx 0.4737) * (1e15). So 0.4737e15, which is 4.737e14. So that's 4.737 x10^14.

Looking again at the options, option I is 4.738e14, which is the closest. So the answer should be I.

To calculate the frequency of the light emitted by the helium-neon laser, we use the formula:

\[
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light, given as \( 632.8 \, \text{nm} \).

First, convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters:
\[
\lambda = 632.8 \, \text{nm} = 632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 6.328 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now, calculate the frequency:
\[
\nu = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{6.328 \times 10^{-7}}.
\]

Simplify the division:
\[
\nu = \left( \frac{3.00}{6.328} \right) \times 10^{8 - (-7)} = 0.4737 \times 10^{15} = 4.737 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is **Option I: 4.738 × 10¹⁴ Hz**.
