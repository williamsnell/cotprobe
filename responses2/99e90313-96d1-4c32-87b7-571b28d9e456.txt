Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
C: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
D: admissible as non-hearsay.
E: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
F: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
G: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
H: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
I: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
J: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I've got this legal question in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down.

Alright, the scenario is this: a man and a woman were involved in a car accident. The man switched lanes abruptly without signaling. The woman then hit the man's car into a median. After the accident, both drivers got out, and a pedestrian, who was emotional and upset, ran up to the man. He shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?"

The question is about whether this statement is admissible in court. The options are various rules about admissibility.

I remember that admissibility can be checked against several exceptions. Let's think about each point.

First, the statement is hearsay because it's a statement made by a third party (the pedestrian) about a previous event (the accident). Hearsay requires a declaration of fact, not an opinion or guess. So option D says it's admissible as non-hearsay, which is wrong because D is about non-hearsay. So D is out.

Now, the next point is whether the statement is admissible. The pedestrian's statement is about the accident, which is hearsay. But in the case of the spontaneous statement exception, the statement is made without knowledge of the statement's truth. So if the pedestrian was in a state of shock or panic, their recollection might be admissible as a spontaneous statement.

Wait, but the fact that the pedestrian is emotional and upset might affect this. Or does the spontaneous statement exception require that the statement is made without knowledge of its truth? Let me recall the rules. The spontaneous statement exception applies when a person is making a statement without the knowledge or opportunity to verify it. So if the pedestrian was in a panic and recalled, that would fit. Alternatively, if he was just reacting to the situation, maybe not.

Alternatively, the accident happened, and the pedestrian came to the scene. Did the pedestrian know what had just happened? The pedestrian's statement is based on their own emotions, which might not necessarily be without knowledge. So maybe the spontaneous statement exception doesn't apply, but the excited utterance exception might.

Wait, excited utterance requires that the statement is made under pressure or excitement. If the pedestrian was in a panic, that's a high bar. Alternatively, the present sense impression exception applies when someone hears a statement that they believe is true but don't necessarily accept as factual, perhaps because they were in a hurry or not fully concentrating. So the pedestrian came in a hurry, so perhaps that's under the present sense impression exception. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is specific. It's a clear statement of fact, but whether it's admissible depends on whether it's hearsay. Since it's a statement from a third party, it's hearsay unless another exception applies.

Another thought: the pedestrian's statement is about the accident, which was an accident. But the pedestrian is not present at trial; the question says the pedestrian is not identified and is not present. So they can't testify directly. So whether the statement is admissible depends on whether it's hearsay or not, and if it falls under an exception.

Wait, the pedestrian is not present, so they can't testify, but their statement is hearsay. So the admissibility depends on whether the statement is admissible as hearsay or as non-hearsay.

Wait, the question is whether the pedestrian's statement is inadmissible. So the options are whether it's admissible or not.

Looking at the options, option E says it's admissible under the excited utterance exception. But wait, the excited utterance exception requires that the statement was made under extreme pressure or excitement. The pedestrian was obviously emotional, but was that in a panic? The question doesn't say. So maybe the excited utterance exception doesn't apply here. Alternatively, the spontaneous statement exception applies when the statement is made without knowledge.

Wait, so the pedestrian is recalling facts based on emotions. If they were in a panic, then their statement would be a spontaneous statement. But if they were just reacting, maybe not. Let me think about the exceptions again.

Another angle: the statement is about what happened. It could be admissible as an excited utterance if it was made under pressure. Or as a spontaneous statement if it was made without the opportunity to verify it.

Wait, the pedestrian's statement is a statement of events (accident) rather than an excited utterance. So it's more about the recollection. So, is it an excited utterance? Well, if it was made under immediate panic, then yes. If not, then maybe not.

Alternatively, the pedestrian's statement could fall under the present sense impression exception. That exception applies when a person hears a statement that they believe is true but don't accept as factual, perhaps because they were in a hurry or not fully concentrating. So if the pedestrian was rushing, maybe their statement is based on a belief that is not necessarily factual. So that might fit.

But wait, the pedestrian's statement is about the accident, which was a specific event. So the exception would require that they made the statement based on their perception of what happened, not as a factual recollection. So in that case, maybe it's not present sense impression.

Wait, but the statement is an emotional response, so it's a recall. So if they were in a panic, then it's spontaneous. If not, then it's present sense impression.

But the question doesn't specify if the pedestrian was in a panic. So perhaps the statement isn't admissible under either excited utterance or present sense impression.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options are A to J. Let me go through them.

Option E is admissible under excited utterance. Option F is admissible under the present sense impression. Option I is admissible under spontaneous statement. Option G is inadmissible because it's opinion. Option H is inadmissible because it's prejudicial.

Wait, the pedestrian's statement is a statement of fact, so it can't be inadmissible as an opinion. So option G is out.

Option H states it's inadmissible because it's prejudicial. But prejudice is about the defendant, not the statement itself. So H is not correct.

Option J is about spontaneous statement. So if the pedestrian was in a state of panic, E would apply. But if not, then F would apply.

But the question doesn't state whether the pedestrian was in a panic. So perhaps the statement isn't admissible under either excited utterance or present sense impression.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is about an accident, which is a specific event. So the statement is hearsay. So, the statement is hearsay unless another exception applies.

Wait, perhaps another angle is the fact that the pedestrian is not identified. If the pedestrian is not present, they can't testify, but their statement is hearsay. So the question is whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible.

Wait, the spontaneous statement exception would require that the statement is made without knowledge of its truth. If the pedestrian was in a panic, maybe the statement was made without knowledge, so E applies.

Alternatively, the excited utterance exception would require that the statement was under immediate pressure. Without that info, maybe not.

Wait, but the statement is made after the accident. So when was the pedestrian in a panic? If the pedestrian was in a panic upon noticing the accident, then their statement would be a spontaneous statement. But if not, maybe not.

But the question doesn't say the pedestrian was in a panic. So perhaps the statement isn't admissible under either.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible under the present sense impression exception. Because the pedestrian was in a hurry or not fully concentrating, but the statement is about the accident, not about the presentation of facts. So maybe F isn't correct.

Wait, but the statement is about the accident, but the exception would require that the statement is a recollection, not a belief. So if the pedestrian was in a state of panic, the statement might be a spontaneous statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception if it was made under pressure. But without knowing, I can't say for sure.

Wait, another thought: the pedestrian ran up to the man. Maybe they were on the side of the road and saw the accident. So perhaps they were in a panic, which would make their statement a spontaneous statement. So E would apply.

But the question doesn't directly state whether the pedestrian was in a panic. So perhaps that's an assumption on my side.

Wait, in the answer options, E is admissible under the excited utterance exception. F is under the present sense impression. The pedestrian's statement is about the accident, so if they were in a panic, it's a spontaneous statement. But if not, then present sense impression.

Wait, but the statement is about the accident. So unless the statement is made based on their belief of the accident's occurrence, it's a hearsay statement.

Wait, but the statement is a recollection of the accident. So, if the pedestrian was in a panic, their statement would be a spontaneous statement. If not, it's a present sense impression.

But since the pedestrian ran up to the man, perhaps they were in a panic. So their statement would be a spontaneous statement.

Wait, but without knowing, I can't definitively say. So in the exam setting, perhaps the answer would be E, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another angle: the pedestrian's statement is about the accident, which happened at the time of the accident. But the statement is a statement of fact, so it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, but the statement is about the accident, so the exception would have to apply to it.

Wait, but the statement is made after the accident, not prior. So perhaps it's not admissible under the excited utterance or spontaneous exception because those exceptions are about statements made prior to the event.

Wait, but the statement is made after the accident, so maybe it's not relevant. Or perhaps the statement is hearsay.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about the exceptions again.

Option A: Inadmissible because the bystander wasn't involved. No, the statement is about the accident, so the bystander is part of the accident. So A is wrong.

Option B: Admissible because it's relevant. Well, it's a statement about the accident, so it's relevant. But if it's hearsay, it's not admissible unless another exception.

Option C: Admissible under excited utterance. If the statement was made under panic, yes.

Option D: Admissible as non-hearsay. No, because it's a statement of fact.

Option E: Admissible under excited utterance. Maybe.

Option F: Admissible under present sense impression. If the pedestrian was in a rush, maybe.

Option G: Inadmissible as opinion. No, because it's not an opinion.

Option H: Admissible as prejudice. No, prejudice is about the defendant, not the statement.

Option I: Admissible under spontaneous statement. If the pedestrian was in panic, yes.

Option J: Admissible under spontaneous statement. Same as I.

Wait, but the pedestrian is not present, so they can't testify, but their statement is hearsay.

The present sense impression exception requires that the statement was made without full concentration, leading to a false belief. So if the pedestrian was in a hurry, their statement might be based on a false belief, making it present sense impression.

So under F, it's admissible.

But the pedestrian's statement is about the accident, so the exception would apply if the statement was made under the pressure of the accident. But I don't know if the pedestrian was in a panic.

Alternatively, the pedestrian was just reacting, so the present sense impression doesn't apply.

I think the correct answer is E, under excited utterance, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, F.

Wait, but the statement is about the accident, which happened at the time of the accident. The excited utterance exception applies when the statement was made under immediate panic. If the pedestrian was in a panic, then E applies.

But the question doesn't state that the pedestrian was in a panic. So maybe the statement isn't admissible under either.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is a statement of fact, so it's hearsay. Unless another exception applies.

Wait, but the pedestrian is not present. So perhaps their statement is not admissible as a hearsay because they can't testify, but that doesn't negate the hearsay nature of the statement. So the statement is still hearsay and thus inadmissible without another exception.

Wait, another angle: the defendant's motion for a mistrial was made by the defendant's attorney. But the defendant's attorney is not identified, so that's irrelevant.

Wait, the pedestrian's statement is hearsay, but the exception for spontaneous statement applies only if the statement was made under panic. Since the pedestrian ran up to the man, perhaps they were in panic. So E would apply.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the statement is admissible under present sense impression because the pedestrian was in a hurry.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is about the accident, not about the act of driving. So the statement is a recollection of the accident, not a belief about the accident. So perhaps it's not present sense impression because the statement is not based on a belief, but on actual memory.

Wait, in that case, the statement would fall under the excited utterance exception only if made under panic. Without knowing, perhaps it's not applicable.

So maybe the correct answer is E. Alternatively, perhaps it's under the spontaneous statement exception.

Wait, but the pedestrian is the witness, not the witness in a position of pressure. So their statement isn't a spontaneous one.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of it as follows: the pedestrian's statement is hearsay. The statement is made after the accident. Unless it's admissible under an exception, it's invalid.

The pedestrian ran up to the man, possibly in panic, so their statement would be a spontaneous statement. So E would apply.

Alternatively, if not in panic, it's a present sense impression.

Wait, but the question doesn't provide any indication that the pedestrian was in a panic. So perhaps the statement isn't admissible under either. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is about the accident, which is an event that happened. So it's hearsay, and the only way to apply an exception is if it's either excited utterance, present sense impression, or spontaneous statement.

I think the correct answer is E. Or perhaps F.

Wait, another approach: the statement is a statement of fact about an accident, so it's hearsay unless another exception applies.

But since the statement is made by a third party, the only way it can be admissible is if it's hearsay and another exception applies. So without another exception, it's not admissible.

But the options include E and F, which are exceptions. So if either applies, the statement is admissible.

Wait, the pedestrian's statement is about an accident. The excited utterance exception requires that the statement was made under immediate panic. The present sense impression requires that the statement was made under stress or hurry.

But the pedestrian's statement is a statement of facts, not a belief, so present sense impression may not apply. Or is it?

Wait, the statement is about the accident, which happened. So the statement is a statement of an event, so it's a hearsay statement. Unless another exception applies.

Wait, the present sense impression exception requires that the statement was made with a sudden emphasis or that the statement was made under the pressure of something else, leading to a false belief. But the statement is about the accident, not about the driver's behavior.

So perhaps it's not present sense impression.

Thus, the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception if the pedestrian was in a panic. Since the pedestrian ran up to the man, perhaps they were in a panic, making E the correct answer.

So the answer is E.
</think>

The pedestrian's statement is a statement of fact about the accident, making it hearsay. Hearsay requires a declaration of fact, not an opinion or guess. The statement is not admissible on its own because it is hearsay unless another exception applies.

The options are analyzed as follows:

- **A**: Incorrect. The bystander was present at the accident, and the statement is relevant to the case.
- **B**: Incorrect. The statement is hearsay, not relevant to the case.
- **C**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible under the excited utterance exception unless the pedestrian was in a panic.
- **D**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible as non-hearsay because it is a statement of fact.
- **E**: Correct. If the pedestrian was in a panic, their statement could be admissible under the excited utterance exception.
- **F**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible under the present sense impression exception because it is not a belief but a statement of facts.
- **G**: Incorrect. The statement is not inadmissible as an opinion, as it is a statement of fact.
- **H**: Incorrect. Admissions are not prejudice.
- **I**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible under the spontaneous statement exception unless the pedestrian was in a panic.
- **J**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Given that the pedestrian ran up to the man and presumably was in a panic, their statement would fall under the excited utterance exception. Therefore, the correct answer is **E**.
