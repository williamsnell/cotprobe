Okay, so I've got this problem here about a patient taking a drug every day. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm.

Alright, the patient takes 150 mg of the drug every day. But wait, the question says just before each tablet is taken, 5% of the drug remains in the body. Hmm, so each time they take it, 5% is left, and then they take another 150 mg. I need to figure out how much is in the body after the third tablet.

Wait, let me think. So each time, the body retains 5% of the drug from the previous dose, right? So each day, the 150 mg isn't completely gone. So the first dose is 150 mg. But after the first tablet, 5% remains. Then they take another 150, so the next dose's 150 is 5% less than the previous day's dose, but wait no, each time the body retains 5% of the previous dose before each new dose is taken.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. Each time they take the tablet, 5% of the drug remains before taking the next. So the first dose is 150 mg. But after taking it, 5% remains. So the body has 150 * 0.05 mg left before the second dose. Then when they take the second dose (another 150 mg), the total becomes 150 + (150 * 0.05) from the previous dose. Then before the third dose, 5% of the total (including the previous doses) remains.

Wait no, the way the problem is worded: "Just before each tablet is taken, 5% of the drug remains in the body." So each time they take a tablet, 5% is left. So the first day, before taking the tablet, 5% of the initial dose (150 mg) is left. So after that, 150 mg is taken, and then the body retains 5% of that 150 mg, which is 7.5 mg. So the next dose is 150 mg, but only 7.5 mg is new, and the previous 150 mg is still there as 5% of 150, which is 7.5, so the body has 150 +7.5=157.5 mg after the second dose? Wait, no, wait. Let me model this.

Wait, maybe I should model the accumulation. Let me think of it in terms of the amount in the body just before each dose.

So, before the first dose, the body has 0 mg. After the first dose, 150 mg is taken. But just before taking the second dose, 5% remains, which is 150 *0.05=7.5 mg. Then the second dose is 150 mg, so just before the second dose, the body has 7.5 mg. So the second dose adds 150 mg, but before taking the second dose, 5% remains, so the new body load is 7.5 +150=157.5 mg. Then before the third dose, 5% of the current load remains, which is 157.5 *0.05=7.875 mg. So when they take the third dose (150 mg), the body has 7.875 mg left before taking it, which is 5% of the previous dose, so the new load is 7.875 +150=157.875 mg.

Wait, but wait. The question says "after the third tablet." So the third dose is taken, and the amount in the body after that would be the sum up to that point, but before taking the third dose, 5% remains. So after taking the third dose, the body has the previous amount (from after the second dose) plus the third dose, but the previous amount is just the one before the third dose.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me model each step.

After first dose:
Just before taking the second dose, the body has 150 mg *0.05 =7.5 mg of the first dose remaining. Then, they take another 150 mg. So the body's load before the second dose is 7.5 mg. So after second dose, the body has 7.5 (from before second dose) plus 150 mg, but wait no, that's not right. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Each time, the body retains 5% of the drug from the previous dose. So the first dose is 150 mg. After the first dose, the body has 150 mg. But just before the second dose, 5% remains, which is 150 *0.05=7.5 mg. So the second dose is taken, which is 150 mg. So the body's load after the second dose is just the 7.5 mg from before the second dose plus the 150 mg taken, but wait, that's not the case. No, wait.

Wait, perhaps the body accumulates the new dose plus the remaining from the previous dose. So after the first dose, the body has 150 mg. But before the second dose, 5% remains, which is 7.5 mg. Then they take another 150 mg. So the body's load becomes 7.5 (previous) +150 (new) = 157.5 mg. But wait, that's after the second dose.

Wait, but the question is about the quantity after the third tablet. So the third dose is taken, and before that, 5% of the body's current load remains.

So let's go step by step.

After first dose (taken at time 0):

Body has 150 mg, but before the second dose, 5% remains. So before second dose, the body has 150 *0.05=7.5 mg.

Then they take the second dose, which is 150 mg. So the body now has 7.5 mg (from before second dose) plus the 150 mg taken, but wait no. Wait, the body's load before taking the second dose is 7.5 mg, so when they take the second 150 mg, their body now has 7.5 mg +150 mg =157.5 mg.

Wait, but that's before taking the third dose. So before taking the third dose, 5% of the body's current load (157.5 mg) remains. So 157.5 *0.05=7.875 mg.

Then, they take the third dose (150 mg), so the body now has 7.875 (from before third dose) +150 mg =157.875 mg.

But wait, the question is asking for the quantity after the third tablet. So after the third dose, but before taking it again. So the body has 157.875 mg, and then they take another 150, but the question is about the quantity after the third, so that would be 157.875 mg. Let me check.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The problem says "just before each tablet is taken, 5% remains." So each time, the body retains 5% of what was taken before. So each dose adds 150 mg, but 5% is carried over from the previous dose.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model each dose and the amount before and after.

Dose 1: taken at time 0. Before taking, 0. After taking, 150 mg. But before taking dose 2, 5% of dose 1 is left: 150 *0.05 =7.5 mg. So after dose 2 is taken, the body has 7.5 (from dose1) +150 (dose2) =157.5 mg.

But the question is after dose 3. So let me model each step:

Dose 1:

- Before: 0
- After: 150
- Before dose2: 150 *0.05 =7.5

Dose2:

- Before:7.5
- After:7.5 +150=157.5

Dose3:

- Before: 157.5
- After:157.5 +150=307.5

Wait, wait, but that's before taking dose3, which is the third tablet. So after dose3, the body has 307.5 mg. But wait, the question is "after the third tablet." So perhaps that's the amount before the next dose. So after the third, they take another, but the question is about the current amount. So the current amount is 307.5 mg.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait the options are all around 145-162 mg.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the steps. Let me try again.

Let me model each step as after each dose, what's the total in the body.

After first dose, taken at time 0. Let me denote each step:

Time 0: before any dose, body is empty.

Take dose 1: at time t=0, 150 mg is taken. But just before taking dose 2, 5% remains. So before taking dose2, the body has 150 *0.05=7.5 mg.

So after taking dose2 (at time t=1), the body's load is 7.5 (from dose1) +150 (dose2) =157.5 mg.

Then, before taking dose3 (at time t=2), the body has 157.5 mg. So 5% remains: 157.5 *0.05 =7.875 mg. So after taking dose3 (at t=2), the body's load is 7.875 +150 (dose3) =157.875 mg.

But the question asks for the quantity after the third tablet. So after taking dose3, the body's load is 157.875 mg. Looking back at the options, option I is 157.875 mg. But wait, the options don't have I as the correct choice because the initial options presented are from A to J, and I is 157.875. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The patient takes 150 mg each day, but just before each tablet, 5% remains. So each day, the body retains 5% of the dose from the previous day. So the first dose is 150 mg. After taking it, 5% (7.5 mg) remains. So the body has 150 mg. Then the next day, before taking the second dose, 5% of 150 is 7.5 mg remains. So the second dose is 150 mg, added to the 7.5, giving 157.5 mg. Then before the third dose, 5% of 157.5 is 7.875 mg remains. So when they take the third dose, the body's load becomes 7.875 +150 =157.875 mg.

So the correct answer is I: 157.875 mg.

Wait, but looking back at the options: option I is 157.875 mg. So the correct answer is I. But I thought the options were A to H, but the initial list shows I as an option. So that's the one.

To determine the quantity of the drug in the body after the third tablet, we model the accumulation of the drug over time, considering that 5% remains in the body before each new dose. The patient takes 150 mg of the drug each day, and 5% of the drug from the previous dose remains before the next dose is taken.

1. **After the first dose:**  
   - The patient takes 150 mg.  
   - Just before the second dose, 5% of 150 mg remains: \( 150 \times 0.05 = 7.5 \, \text{mg} \).  
   - Body load before the second dose: 7.5 mg.  
   - After taking the second dose, the body load is \( 7.5 + 150 = 157.5 \, \text{mg} \).

2. **After the second dose:**  
   - Just before the third dose, 5% of 157.5 mg remains: \( 157.5 \times 0.05 = 7.875 \, \text{mg} \).  
   - Body load before the third dose: 7.875 mg.  
   - After taking the third dose, the body load is \( 7.875 + 150 = 157.875 \, \text{mg} \).

Thus, after the third tablet, the quantity of the drug in the body is **157.875 mg**.
