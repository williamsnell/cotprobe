Question:

Optometrists use a linear scale of lens power, measured in diopters, to prescribe corrective lenses. Sufferers of myopia, or nearsightedness, have difficulty resolving distant objects because the lenses in their eyes are too strong. If a myopic person has a prescription of -5 diopters, what image do her corrective lenses create for distant objects?

Options:

A: An upright, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
B: An upright, virtual image about 5 cm behind her eyes
C: An inverted, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
D: An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
E: An inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
F: An inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes
G: An upright, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes
H: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
I: An upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
J: An inverted, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes

Okay, so I've got this question about myopia and corrective lenses. Hmm, myopia is nearsightedness, right? That means the eye can't focus light from objects that are too far away. So the person has difficulty seeing things clearly at a distance. 

The question says the person has a prescription of -5 diopters. I remember that diopters measure the strength of a lens, and a negative number means a converging lens, which is for farsightedness, not myopia. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, myopia uses a diverging lens because the person's eye can't focus the light from objects far away. So a myopic person's corrective lens is a converging lens, which is a stronger lens. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. My confusion arises because the prescription is in diopters, and myopia uses negative numbers. Oh right, myopia is when the eye can't focus near objects, so the corrective lens has a positive power? Wait, no, no. Wait, correction for myopia is a converging lens, which is a strong lens. So the person's eye requires a converging lens to correct the nearsightedness. But wait, the person has a prescription of -5 diopters. Oh, that's a negative number, which would mean the corrective lens is a diverging lens. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think again. Myopia requires the eye to focus on objects closer than usual, so the eye is stretched. To correct this, the lens needs to converge the light, which is a converging lens. The power is negative because myopia uses a diverging lens. Wait, no. No, I'm getting this wrong. Myopia is when the eye can't see objects clearly beyond a certain distance. So the person's eye is a diverging lens. The corrected lens is a converging lens. So the person's prescription is negative, because the diverging lens (the eye) has a negative power. So the correction would be to add a converging lens which has positive power. The person's prescription is -5 diopters. So the lens they wear is a +5 diopter lens. Which would correct their vision.

So when a myopic person wears this, their eye is being corrected with a converging lens. So the image formed by this lens would be virtual, right? Because converging lenses can only form real images when they're used with objects within their focal point. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the person's eye itself is a diverging lens. When the person's eye is corrected, they're using a converging lens. So the person's eye is a diverging lens. So the person's prescription is -5, meaning the lens is a diverging lens. Wait, no, let's clarify.

I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: Myopia is due to the eye having a strong farsightedness. So the eye's lens is stretched, which is a diverging lens. So the eye's power is negative. So the person's prescription is a negative number. So a myopic person has a negative power (like -5 diopters), meaning their eye is a diverging lens. The correction would be a converging lens, which is a positive power. So the person's corrective lens is +5 diopters. So the person's prescription is -5, meaning the corrective lens is +5.

Now, when the myopic person wears this +5 lens, what image forms? Let me think about the image formation. The person's eye is a diverging lens, and the correction is a converging lens. So the focal length is positive. The lens is now a converging lens. Wait, but the person's own eye is a diverging lens, so what happens when they wear a converging lens?

Alternatively, think about the object at a distance. The myopic eye can't focus the image on the retina. So when an object is at a certain distance, the rays focus behind the retina, creating a virtual image. The correction is to bring the focal point back to the retina. So the person's own eye is a diverging lens, and the corrective lens is a converging lens. So the combination would have a positive power.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of image formation. The myopic person's eye (without correction) is a diverging lens. The correction is a converging lens, so the combination is a converging lens. The person's prescription is -5, which is a converging lens with 5 diopters. So, the person's own eye (without correction) is a diverging lens, and the correction is a converging lens.

Wait, no. Myopia: When the person's eye is myopic, their eye is a diverging lens. The correction is a converging lens (positive power). So the person wears a +5 diopter lens instead of a diverging. So the person's own eye is a diverging lens (so their own power is negative), and the correction is a +5.

So what happens when the person's eye is corrected with a +5 lens? The person's own eye (diverging) is now replaced by a converging lens. So the question is, what image is formed by the corrected lens when looking at a distant object?

Wait, when the person looks at a distant object, the light rays coming from the object are parallel. The diverging lens (without correction) would focus them at some point behind the retina, creating a virtual image. But the person wears a converging lens. So the image is formed by the converging lens.

Wait, but the object is at a far distance, so the rays are parallel. If you have a converging lens, when the object is far away (at infinity), the image would be formed on the focal point. But the focal point of a converging lens is in front of the lens. So the image would be a real image on the same side as the object. Wait, but wait, for a converging lens, the object at infinity will produce an image at the focal point.

Wait, but if the person is wearing a +5 lens, which has a positive power, the focal length is 1/5 m, which is 20 cm. So the focal point is 20 cm in front of the lens. So the image of a distant object (at infinity) would be formed at 20 cm in front of the lens. But the person is wearing this lens, so the image would be 20 cm in front of her eyes.

Wait, but wait, no. Because if the person is looking at a distant object, the image formed by the converging lens would be a real image on the same side as the object. So the image would be real, and located 20 cm in front of the lens. So how far in front of the eyes is that?

Wait, the person's own eyes are 20 cm in front of the lens. So the image is 20 cm in front of the lens, which is 20 cm in front of the person's eyes. So the image is real and forms 20 cm in front of the eyes.

But wait, what about the type of image? Real or virtual? Since the object is at infinity, and the converging lens is in front of the eyes, the image is real and inverted. Oh wait, no. Wait, for a converging lens, if the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point. The focal point for a +5 lens is 20 cm in front, so the image is formed 20 cm in front of the lens. So for the person's eye, which is 20 cm in front of the lens, the image would be 20 cm in front of the lens, which is the same as 20 cm in front of the eyes. So the image is real and inverted.

Wait, but the options. Let's see the options.

Option E says: An inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

So the correct option would be E.

Wait, but wait another moment. Alternatively, perhaps the image is virtual. Hmm.

Wait, when you have a myopic eye, without any correction, the eye's lens is diverging (negative power). So the person's own lens is a diverging lens. The correction is a converging lens (positive power). So when the person looks at a distant object, the incoming light from the object is coming parallel.

The diverging lens (without correction) would have the incoming rays focus at a point behind the retina, creating a virtual image. But when the person wears the converging lens (corrective), the image is formed by the converging lens. So the incoming rays, which were parallel, now focus on the focal point of the converging lens. So the image is formed on the focal point, which is 20 cm in front of the lens. Since the person's eyes are 20 cm in front of the lens, the image is 20 cm in front of the eyes.

So the image is real (because it's formed by converging rays) and inverted, since the image from a converging lens is inverted when the object is at infinity. So the image is real, inverted, and 20 cm in front.

Looking at the options, option E says inverted, real image about 20 cm in front. So E is correct.

Wait, but wait. Myopia allows the correction with a converging lens. So without any correction, the eye's lens is diverging (negative), and the person wears a converging lens (positive). So the combined effect is a converging lens.

Wait, let's think about the image formation. The myopic eye is using a diverging lens (negative), and the correction is a converging lens (positive). So the image is formed by the converging lens. The object is at a distance so that the rays are parallel.

The image formed by a converging lens when the object is at infinity is a virtual image, right? Because converging lenses can only form real images when the object is within the focal length. But wait, for a diverging lens, the object is at infinity and the image is behind the retina. But when you have the correction, the image is formed by the converging lens.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again about the image. The myopic person's own eye is a diverging lens, but the correction is a converging lens. So the combined effect is a converging lens. So the object is at a distance, and the image is formed by the converging lens.

Wait, for an object at infinity, the image formed by a converging lens is at the focal point, which is 20 cm in front of the lens. So the image is 20 cm in front of the lens.

But the person's eyes are 20 cm in front of the lens, so the image is 20 cm in front of the eyes.

So the image is real (since the lens is converging), inverted, and 20 cm in front of the eyes.

So the correct option is E: inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

The question involves understanding the image formation created by a myopic person's corrective lenses. Myopia, or nearsightedness, occurs when the eye cannot focus light from objects at a distance, requiring a converging lens to correct the vision. A myopic person's prescription of -5 diopters indicates that their eye is a diverging lens, and the corrective lens is a converging lens with a strength of +5 diopters.

When a myopic person wears the +5 diopter lens, the light rays from a distant object (parallel rays) are refracted by the lens. For a converging lens, the object at infinity forms a virtual image at its focal point. The focal length of the +5 diopter lens is 20 cm, meaning the image is formed 20 cm in front of the lens. Since the person's eyes are 20 cm in front of the lens, the virtual image is located 20 cm in front of her eyes.

The image formed is real because the converging lens produces real images for objects within its focal length. Additionally, the image is inverted due to the nature of converging lenses. Therefore, the image created by the myopic person's corrective lenses is an inverted, real image located 20 cm in front of her eyes.

The correct answer is:

**E: An inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.**

Answer: E
