Okay, I need to solve the equation x minus 10.5 equals -11.6. Hmm, wait, let me write that down properly. So, the equation is x - 10.5 = -11.6. I remember that to solve for x, I should get rid of the numbers being subtracted from x. So, I need to do the opposite operation, which is adding. 

So, I'll add 10.5 to both sides of the equation to isolate x. Let me calculate that: x equals -11.6 plus 10.5. Wait, what's -11.6 plus 10.5? Let me think about the numbers. 11.6 minus 10.5 is 1.1, but since one is negative, it's -1.1. So x equals -1.1. 

Let me check the options. Option C is -1.1, so that should be the correct answer.
