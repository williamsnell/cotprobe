Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the serial position effect. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that Dan read a list of 30 vocabulary words only once. Now, if he's showing the serial position effect, what would happen when he remembers them two days later?

Hmm. I remember that the serial position effect refers to the phenomenon where the most recently learned items are remembered better than the ones studied earlier. So, the idea is that the latest items are more likely to be remembered accurately. 

Let me look at the options again. The options are A to I, each with a different scenario.

Option A: At the end of the list. That makes sense because if you study the latest items first and then forget them, but the effect says you remember the latest better. Wait, but in the effect, the most recent are remembered best. So if he reads the list once, the first word is the oldest, and the last is the most recent. So if he learns the last word first, then the first word would be the last to be learned, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the serial position effect is about the order of study, not the order of recall. So if he studies the last word first, the first word he reads is the last one he learned. But when he recovers, the first item he remembers would be the last one.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The serial position effect says that the items studied later are remembered better. So, if you study item 1, then item 2, item 3, and so on, then the more recently studied items (like item 30) are remembered better. So, if he's reading the list once, and then remembering it two days later, the words he remembers are probably those that were studied later. So, the last word he read would be the one he's most likely to remember.

Wait, the question says he read the list only once. So he read all 30 words in order. But the effect says that the more recent (latter) items are remembered better. So, the last word in the list would be remembered best. So the words he remembers two days later would be the last ones.

Looking at the options, option E is the last ten words, but that's not correct. Option A is at the end, which would be the same as the last word. So the expected answer is option A. 

Wait, but I thought the effect is that the later items are remembered better. So, the last word in the list is the one he remembers best. So, the answer should be option A: at the end of the list.

Wait, but the options have E being the last ten words. Do I need to think about the number of words? No, the serial position effect doesn't specify how many words are relevant beyond their position. It just says the later ones are better. So, regardless of how many words, the last word is remembered best. So, the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is A: at the end of the list.

**Answer:** A
