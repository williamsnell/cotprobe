Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the palace at Knossos. The question is about the number of rooms it had when it was at its peak. The options are A: 100, B: 500, C: 1,000, and D: 5,000. 

Hmm, I remember reading somewhere that Knossos is associated with the ancient Greek神话. The palace there is famous as a symbol of the island of Sparta. I think it's often called the "Palace of the Gods" or something like that. But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact number of rooms.

Let me think. I recall that in myths, the palace is depicted as a grand structure with many rooms. One myth is that it has 1,000 rooms or more. But wait, another thought: in some versions, it's 5,000 rooms. Or maybe 500? I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely certain which one is the correct number.

I think I read that the palace had over 1,000 rooms, but I'm not sure if it's exactly 1,000 or more. Alternatively, maybe it's 5,000, which seems like a lot, but perhaps it's a myth or a more exaggerated version. Wait, I'm trying to remember when I was a kid. The myth where the palace had so many rooms that it was called the "Palace of the Gods" because it had to be a place where the gods could dwell, each in their own room. That makes sense because many gods are associated with various locations, and having a palace with rooms for each might be a way to represent that.

So if the palace had 1,000 rooms, that's a lot, but perhaps the myth imagines it having over 1,000. But wait, I think the real answer is 5,000. Because I remember reading that in one myth, the palace was said to have 5,000 rooms. That's a lot, but maybe that's a more exaggerated version. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 5,000. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the options are 100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000. The question says "over" so the number is more than 1,000. So the options that fit are C: 1,000 and D: 5,000. But which one is correct?

Wait, I think I've heard that the palace had over 1,000 rooms. So the correct answer would be C: 1,000. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the myth might have more. Alternatively, maybe the myth is that the palace had 5,000 rooms, making it one of the most rooms in the world. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the actual number in the myth is 5,000. So the correct answer is D:5,000. I think that's it. Because I remember that in the myth, the palace was said to have 5,000 rooms, which was a lot. So the peak was over 1,000, but the myth implies it was 5,000.

The correct answer is D: 5,000. This aligns with the myth where the palace at Knossos was depicted to have a grand and elaborate structure with over 1,000 rooms, but the mythically exaggerated number is 5,000 rooms. 

Answer: D
