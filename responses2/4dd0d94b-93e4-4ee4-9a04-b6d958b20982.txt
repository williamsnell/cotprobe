Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about difference feminism, and I need to figure out which option best describes its central thesis. Let me break it down.

Difference feminism is a social theory that focuses on challenging the notion that men and women are fundamentally the same. The idea is that women have different perspectives on various issues like gender roles, rights, and justice compared to men. So, the central thesis is probably about women having unique conceptions of the feminist project beyond men's.

Looking at the options:

- Option A says women and men are the same, which is the opposite of the thesis. So A is wrong.

- Option B talks about men not understanding their differences from women. But that's more about the approach rather than the thesis. The thesis is about their differing ideas, not just that they can't see it.

- Option C says men and women differ only in physical attributes. That's too narrow. Difference feminism goes beyond physical differences to include thought processes and societal roles.

- Option D says men are more towards justice, women focus on fairness. This is about personal perspectives, not the overall difference between men and women, so not the thesis.

- Option E suggests fundamental differences between women. Hmm, that's a bit vague. It suggests that women have a different focus, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest statement. It's about individual focus, but it's still about the difference between the two groups.

- Option F claims women are more on equality, men on fairness. Again, this is about individual differences in focus, not the thesis of fundamental differences.

- Option G says feminism is about eradicating differences. That's a strong statement. It's about acknowledging that men and women, despite their differences, share a common goal. This directly relates to the thesis.

- Option H says men and women have different conceptions of the feminist project. While this is another strong point, feminism as a whole is concerned with erasing these differences, not just the way people see the project.

- Option I says women and men have identical perspectives. This is the opposite of the thesis, so I is wrong.

- Option J suggests women look to context, men to abstract notions. This is about how people apply feminist ideas, which is more about practice than the theory.

So, the key points are that difference feminism seeks to erode the belief that men and women are the same. Therefore, the correct option is G, which directly states that feminism addresses the erasure of differences between men and women.

The correct answer is G: 'Feminism is about eradicating differences between men and women.' This directly reflects the central thesis of difference feminism, which challenges the belief that men and women are fundamentally the same. 

Answer: G
