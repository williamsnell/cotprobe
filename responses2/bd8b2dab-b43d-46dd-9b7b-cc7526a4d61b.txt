Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the electrostatic force between two charged particles. Hmm, I remember that there's Coulomb's Law involved here. 

The problem states that there's a particle with a charge of +3.00 × 10^-6 C and another with -1.50 × 10^-6 C. They're 12.0 cm apart. Oh wait, I should probably convert that distance into meters because in the formula, the units have to be consistent. So 12 cm is 0.12 meters.

Coulomb's Law formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². Right, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is about 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C². Oh wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the charges are opposite in sign, so the force should be attractive. But the question is only asking for the magnitude, so I don't need to worry about the direction here.

Let's plug in the numbers. So q1 is 3e-6 C, q2 is -1.5e-6 C. The product of their magnitudes would be 3e-6 * 1.5e-6. Let me calculate that. 3 *1.5 is 4.5, and the exponents are 10^-6 *10^-6 =10^-12. So 4.5e-12 C².

Now, the distance squared is (0.12 m)^2. Let's compute that. 0.12 squared is 0.0144 m².

Putting it all together, F = (8.988e9) * (4.5e-12) / 0.0144. Let's compute numerator first. 8.988e9 *4.5e-12 = 8.988 *4.5 *1e-3. 8.988 *4.5 is approximately 40.446, so 40.446e-3, which is 0.040446.

Then, divide that by 0.0144. 0.040446 / 0.0144. Let's compute that. Hmm, 0.040446 divided by 0.0144 is approximately 2.8146 N. Wait, wait, let me do that division more accurately. 0.040446 / 0.0144. Let's think: 0.0144 * 2.8 is 0.0144 *2=0.0288, 0.0144*0.8=0.01152. So 2.8 gives 0.03992. That's very close to 0.040446. So the difference is 0.040446 - 0.03992 =0.000526. So how much more than 2.8? Let's compute 0.000526 /0.0144. That's approximately 0.0365. So 2.8 + 0.0365 is about 2.8365. Wait, but wait, that would make it around 2.836 or so.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think differently. Let me compute 0.040446 /0.0144. Let's write them as fractions: 40446e-6 /144e-3. Oh, 40446e-6 is 40446 /1e6, and 144e-3 is 144/1e3. So (40446/1e6) / (144/1e3) ) = (40446 *1e3)/(1e6 *144) = (40446)/(144e3)

Compute 40446 divided by 144000. Let's compute that.

40446 ÷ 144000. Let's see, 40446 / 144000. Let me compute 40446 ÷ 144000. 

Well, 144000 * 0.2818 is approximately 40446. Because 0.28 *144000 is 40320, and 0.2818 *144000 is 40446. So 0.2818 → approximately 0.2818 is 281.8 thousandths? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 0.2818.

Wait, 0.2818 multiplied by 144,000 gives 40,446. So 0.2818 is the exact value. So F is approximately 0.2818 N. Hmm, wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Looking back at the options: options are around 0.92, 1.56, 2.81, etc. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere in my calculation.

Wait wait, let me recalculate. Maybe I messed up the exponents somewhere.

Let me go back.

The charges are 3e-6 and 1.5e-6. So their product is (3e-6)(1.5e-6) = 4.5e-12 C². Correct.

The distance squared is 0.12 m squared. So 0.0144 m². Correct.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So numerator: 8.988e9 *4.5e-12 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 *4.5 first. 8 *4.5=36, 0.988 *4.5≈4.446. So total is 36 +4.446 = 40.446. Then multiply by 1e-3 (because 1e9 *1e-12 = 1e-3). So 40.446e-3 is 0.040446.

Divide that by 0.0144: 0.040446 / 0.0144.

Let me compute this division.

0.040446 ÷ 0.0144.

I can write both as fractions over 1.

0.040446 = 4.0446e-2 = 404.46e-4.

0.0144 = 1.44e-2.

So 404.46e-4 / 1.44e-2 = (404.46e-4) / (1.44e-2) ) = (404.46 / 1.44) * 1e-2.

Compute 404.46 /1.44.

Let me compute 1.44 * 280 = 403.2. Because 280 *1.44 = 280 *1 + 280*0.44 = 280 + 123.2=403.2. So 280 would give 403.2, which is 1.44 *280.

But our numerator is 404.46. So 404.46 -403.2=1.26. So 280 + (1.26/1.44) → 280 + 0.875 = 280.875.

So 404.46 /1.44 = approximately 280.875.

So 280.875 *1e-2 is 2.80875. So approximately 2.8088 N.

Hmm, that's about 2.81 N. Looking at the options, option G is 3.67 N, option H is 2.81 N. So the correct answer is option H, 2.81 N.

Wait, but wait another second. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when I did the multiplication. Let me re-calculate k*q1*q2.

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1 = 3e-6 C, q2 = -1.5e-6 C. So the product is (3e-6)(-1.5e-6) = -4.5e-12 C². But since we take the absolute value, it's 4.5e-12.

Putting it into F = (8.988e9 *4.5e-12) / (0.12)^2.

Let me compute numerator: 8.988e9 *4.5e-12 = (8.988 *4.5) * 1e9 *1e-12.

= (40.446) * 1e-3.

So 40.446e-3 = 0.040446.

Denominator: (0.12)^2=0.0144.

So F = 0.040446 / 0.0144 ≈ 2.80875 N. So approximately 2.81 N.

Looking at the options, option G is 3.67 N, H is 2.81 N. So the correct answer is H, 2.81 N.

To calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two charged particles, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( q_1 = +3.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( q_2 = -1.50 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( r = 12.0 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.12 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the product of the charges
\[
|q_1 \cdot q_2| = (3.00 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (1.50 \times 10^{-6}) = 4.50 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the square of the distance
\[
r^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144 \, \mathrm{m^2}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into Coulomb's Law
\[
F = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.50 \times 10^{-12})}{0.0144}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the numerator
\[
(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.50 \times 10^{-12}) = 40.446 \times 10^{-3} = 0.040446
\]

### Step 5: Divide by the denominator
\[
F = \frac{0.040446}{0.0144} \approx 2.80875 \, \mathrm{N}
\]

### Final Result:
The magnitude of the electrostatic force is approximately \( 2.81 \, \mathrm{N} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is **H: 2.81 N**.
