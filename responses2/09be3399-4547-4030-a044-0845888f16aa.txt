Okay, so I've got this problem here about three partners—Alton, Birch, and Castor—who invested money in a retail hardware store. The total profit is $15,000, and they're going to split it based on their investments. I need to figure out how much Birch should get.

First, let's see the investments. Alton put in $4,000, Birch $5,000, and Castor $11,000. So the total investment is $4k + $5k + $11k, which adds up to $20k. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4,000 plus 5,000 is 9,000, plus 11,000 is 20,000. So the total is $20,000.

The profits are $15,000. They're sharing in proportion to their investments. So Birch's share would be his investment divided by the total investment, multiplied by the total profit.

Let me write this down:

Birch's share = (Birch's investment / Total investment) * Total profit.

So Birch's investment is $5,000. Total investment is $20,000. So 5k / 20k is 1/4. So 1/4 of $15,000 is $3,750. Wait, or is it 15,000 * (5,000/20,000)?

Wait, another way: (5,000 / 20,000) * 15,000. Let's compute that.

5,000 divided by 20,000 is 0.25. 0.25 multiplied by 15,000 is 3,750. So Birch gets $3,750.

Looking at the options, option E is $3,750. So the answer should be E.

The correct calculation shows that Birch's share is 25% of $15,000, which is $3,750.
