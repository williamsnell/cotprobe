Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about charge density on a satellite. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question says a spherical metal satellite accumulates a charge of 2.4 microcoulombs. The diameter is 1.3 meters. And we need to find the surface charge density. 

Wait, surface charge density... Oh right, that's the charge per unit area. So I remember that surface charge density (sigma) is given by Q divided by the area. But wait, the satellite is a sphere, right? So the area would be the surface area of a sphere. Oh yeah, the formula for surface area of a sphere is 4πr², where r is the radius.

But wait, the diameter is 1.3m, so the radius is half of that. Let me calculate that. 1.3 divided by 2 is 0.65 meters. So radius r is 0.65 m.

Now, the area A = 4πr². Plugging in the radius, A = 4 * π * (0.65)^2. Let me compute that step by step. 0.65 squared is 0.4225. Multiply by 4 gives 1.69. So A = 1.69 * π. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 1.69 * 3.1416 is about 5.309 square meters.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations. 0.65 squared is 0.4225. 4 * 3.1416 is 12.5664. Multiply by 0.4225: 0.4225 * 12.5664. Let me compute that. 0.4225 * 12 equals about 5.07, and 0.4225 * 0.5664 is roughly 0.238. Adding together gives roughly 5.308. So approximately 5.308 m².

Wait, but I should probably be more precise. Maybe I should use exact values. Let me calculate it more accurately.

So A = 4 * π * (0.65)^2. 0.65 squared is 0.4225. Multiplying by 4 gives 1.69. 1.69 * π is about 5.309. So A is approximately 5.309 m².

Now, the charge Q is 2.4 microcoulombs. Oh wait, micro is 1e-6, so 2.4e-6 C.

Surface charge density sigma is Q/A. So 2.4e-6 divided by 5.309. Let me compute that. 2.4 divided by 5.309 is roughly 0.452. So 0.452e-6, which is 4.52e-7 C/m².

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 4.5e-7, which matches approximately what I got. Let me go through the options again.

Option A: 7.3e-7 → higher
B: 2.2e-7 → lower
C:5.8e-7 → higher
D:3.6e-7 → lower
E:1e-6 → much bigger
F:6.2e-7 → higher
G:4.5e-7 → matches
H:3.1e-7 → lower
I:1e-6 → nope
J:8.1e-7 → higher.

So the correct answer is G.

To determine the surface charge density (σ) of the spherical satellite, we use the formula:

\[
\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}
\]

where \( Q \) is the charge and \( A \) is the surface area of the sphere. The diameter of the satellite is given as \( 1.3 \, \text{m} \), so the radius \( r \) is:

\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.3}{2} = 0.65 \, \text{m}.
\]

The surface area \( A \) of a sphere is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi r^2.
\]

Substituting \( r = 0.65 \, \text{m} \):

\[
A = 4 \pi (0.65)^2 = 4 \pi (0.4225) = 1.69 \pi.
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[
A \approx 1.69 \times 3.1416 \approx 5.309 \, \text{m}^2.
\]

The charge \( Q \) is given as \( 2.4 \, \mu\text{C} = 2.4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \). Substituting \( Q \) and \( A \) into the formula for surface charge density:

\[
\sigma = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{-6}}{5.309} \approx 4.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C/m}^2.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:

**G: \( 4.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C/m}^2 \).**
