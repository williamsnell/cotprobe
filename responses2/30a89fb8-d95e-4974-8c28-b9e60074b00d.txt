Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about algorithms and their running times. Hmm, the question is asking which algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²) but an average time complexity of Θ(n log n). I remember that different sorting algorithms have different behaviors based on their sorting criteria and how they perform under different conditions.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Counting Sort. I remember that counting sort has a time complexity of O(n + k) where k is the range of input. So if the input is large and the range is also large, it's O(n), but if the range is small, like when all elements are the same, it's O(n). So it's not Θ(n²), so A isn't the answer.

Option B: Shell Sort. I think Shell Sort is an optimization of insertion sort. It sorts elements with gaps, which can lead to better performance than insertion sort but not as good as other sorting methods. Its worst-case time is O(n²), but I'm not sure about its average case. Maybe it's similar to insertion sort, so it's O(n²) in worst and average cases. So B is probably not the right answer.

Option C: Insertion Sort. Oh right, insertion sort has O(n²) worst-case time because in the worst case, each element has to be compared and inserted into its correct position. But the average case is O(n²) as well because each element is compared and possibly moved a few positions. Or wait, no, maybe it's O(n²) both ways. I'm not sure, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, no, both average and worst cases for insertion sort are O(n²) because each element has to be compared up to its position. So that's not the one.

Option D: Bubblesort. I recall that bubblesort has O(n²) in worst case because each of the n-1 passes involves up to n comparisons. But in the average case, it's about (n²)/2 operations, so it's O(n²) as well. So D is probably not the answer.

Option E: Mergesort. Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges them. Its worst-case time is O(n log n) because it always divides and merges in a balanced way. So E is not the answer.

Option F: Selection Sort. Selection sort has O(n²) in both worst and average cases because it repeatedly selects the smallest element and swaps it with the element in its correct position. So F is out.

Option G: Bucket Sort. I'm not too sure about this one. Bucket sort depends on the data distribution. In the best case, where all elements are in one bucket, it can be O(n). In the worst case, it's O(n²) when elements are spread out. So if the data is such that all elements go into a single bucket, it's O(n²). But the average case depends on how elements are distributed. So if the average case is O(n log n), that might not fit. Or maybe if the data is uniformly distributed, it's O(n²). So I'm not sure. I'll have to think more.

Option H: Radix Sort. Radix sort's time complexity depends on the number of digits or significant elements. For example, if it's counting sort, it's Θ(nk) where k is the number of digits. So if k is small, it can be O(n). But for integer data, if the number of digits is small, like base 10, it's O(n). But for other data types, it might have worse time. Also, Radix Sort is stable and can do better in terms of average case. So if the data is such that the number of buckets is small, Radix Sort can be O(n log n). But in the worst case, like when the data is sorted or has certain patterns, maybe it's worse. So I'm not sure if this fits the question.

Option I: Quicksort. Quicksort's average case is O(n log n), but in the worst case, it's O(n²) when the pivot selection is bad, like picking the smallest or largest element each time. So if the algorithm is in average case, it's O(n log n), but worst case is worse. So I'm looking for an average case of O(n log n) and worst of O(n²). So I'm not sure about Quicksort. I think it depends on the implementation, like using a good pivot selection method.

Option J: Heapsort. Heapsort has an average case of Θ(n log n) and worst-case Θ(n log n) as well. Because it's a comparison-based algorithm and always performs the same number of operations. So J is out.

So, let me recap: the question is looking for an algorithm that has worst case Θ(n²) and average case Θ(n log n). So which of the options fit that?

So, checking again:

Possible candidates are:

Option G: Bucket Sort. If in the average case it's O(n log n), but in worst case O(n²), then yes. But I'm not sure about the average case. For example, if the data is uniformly distributed, the time is O(n log n). But if the data is all in one bucket (worst case), then it's O(n²). So that fits because sometimes it's O(n²) but sometimes O(n log n). So that would make G a possible candidate.

Another possibility is Radix Sort. Radix Sort has average case O(n log n) if the number of digits is manageable, and worst case O(n k), where k is the number of digits. So if k is small, say base 10, it's O(n). But in the worst case, it could be O(n²) if all elements are arranged into separate buckets. So for example, if you're sorting 1000 integers from 0 to 999, then each element is in its own bucket, so the time is O(n * 10) = O(10000), which is O(n). So maybe Radix Sort would have O(n) in the worst case if data is spread out, but if data is in a single bucket, it's O(n²). Wait, that depends on the distribution. If the data is such that each element is in its own bucket, the time is O(n). But if the data is arranged in a way that causes many elements to go into the same bucket, it could be worse. So maybe Radix Sort doesn't fit the question as the worst case is O(n²).

So let's think again: the question requires the worst case to be O(n²) and average O(n log n). So what's an algorithm that in worst case is O(n²), and on average O(n log n)?

Option G: Bucket Sort. It can have O(n²) worst case because if all elements are in one bucket, it's O(n²) time. But in the average case, if the elements are spread out, it's O(n log n). So yes, that fits.

So the correct answer would be G.

The correct answer is G: Bucket Sort.

**Explanation:**
- **G: Bucket Sort** has a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²) when all elements are placed into a single bucket, leading to O(n²) time in the worst case. However, in the average case, if elements are uniformly distributed, it has an average time complexity of Θ(n log n). This fits the criteria of having Θ(n²) in the worst case and Θ(n log n) on average.
