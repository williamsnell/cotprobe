Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Pogge's arguments regarding global poverty. Let me try to break it down step by step to figure out the right answer. 

First, the question is asking what Pogge argues about the global poor. The options are a bunch of duties, so I need to recall what each term means in this context. 

I remember that Pogge is a philosopher known for his work on ethics, particularly in the areas of global justice and the ethics of poverty. His arguments often focus on the moral obligations of nations towards others, especially regarding the poor.

The question says that since wealthy countries have directly caused harm, Pogge argues that we (the poorer nations) have very stringent duties. So, the options are about duties towards the global poor. 

Let me go through each option:

A: libertarian duties. I'm not sure about this one. Libertarian duties are more about freedoms and individual rights, not necessarily about the global poor.

B: positive duties towards the global poor. Hmm, positive duties imply that the poor are owed positive actions, maybe to improve their situation. But I'm not too sure about what Pogge would say specifically about duties.

C: duty-free towards the global poor. This seems like it would mean no obligation or even a benefit, which doesn't quite fit with Pogge's argument that poor countries have a direct and severe role.

D: liberal duties towards the global poor.liberal means more individualistic and less government intervention. I don't think Pogge would align with a liberal view here.

E: consequentialist duties towards the global poor. Consequentialism is about the outcomes of actions. Pogge might argue that poor nations have strict moral duties based on the consequences of their actions, especially regarding the poor.

F: conservative duties towards the global poor. Conservative ethics might focus on the good of the people, but again, I'm not sure if this is the right term for his argument.

G: negative duties towards the global poor. Negative duties might imply the opposite of positive, but I don't recall seeing this as Pogge's main point.

H: utilitarian duties towards the global poor. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall good, but again, not sure if that's the term he uses.

I: human rights duties towards the global poor. This relates to rights, like obligations to others, but Pogge's focus is on the global poor, not human rights per se.

J: egalitarian duties towards the global poor. Egalitarian refers to equality, which might not directly relate to the moral obligations of poor nations.

Thinking back, I remember that Pogge's arguments often emphasize the moral obligations of nations towards the global poor. He's critical of the idea that nations have positive duties because it ignores the global poor's suffering and their inherent right to well-being. So, he argues that we have very stringent duties, meaning a lot of positive duties. Positive duties would reinforce the idea that helping the poor is important.

So looking at the options, B says positive duties towards the global poor. That fits because Pogge would likely argue that nations have positive duties, especially given the global poor's suffering and lack of rights to others. 

Alternatively, maybe E is about consequences, but E is a more general term. Since positive duties would imply that there's a moral obligation tied to the positive outcomes, that fits better.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact terminology. I think Pogge's position is that the global poor are an integral part of the global community, and thus nations have positive duties towards them. So the option B seems correct.

The correct answer is B: positive duties towards the global poor. Pogge argues that nations have positive moral duties towards the global poor, emphasizing their inherent right to well-being and the global community's obligation to support them. This aligns with the idea that the global poor are an integral part of global justice and that nations must act with positive duties towards them.

Answer: B
