Question:

Federal law prohibits "willingly and knowingly" taking cash in excess of $10,000 from the U.S. into a foreign country without first reporting the transaction in detail. An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of "willingly and knowingly" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?

Options:

A: No, because the owner's habitual actions imply intent to avoid reporting the cash.
B: No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.
C: Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.
D: No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.
E: Yes, because the owner was not intentionally breaking the law, he was simply unaware of it.
F: No, because ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.
G: Yes, because the owner is not a resident of the U.S. and therefore not subject to its laws.
H: No, because the owner is a business operator and therefore should be aware of such laws.
I: Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.
J: Yes, because the owner was not given a fair chance to defend himself in court.

Okay, so I have this legal question about the U.S. law that prohibits taking cash over $10k into a foreign country without reporting. The owner of a drug store is charged with this, and the question is whether the federal appellate court will reverse his conviction. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that the U.S. has a strict liability law for this. That means even if someone doesn't know the law, they're still liable unless some exceptions apply. The key here is whether there's a mistake of law defense, or if the law requires specific intent.

The owner is taking cash into Canada without reporting, which is illegal. The federal law says you can't do that without first reporting in detail. The owner's main defense is that he knew nothing about the law or broke it. The judge instructed the jury that mistake of law isn't a defense. But wait, the question is about the appellate court, not the initial defense.

Wait, mistake of law is a defense to criminal liability, but if the initial defense is that the law doesn't apply because the person didn't know, then what happens? Oh, but mistake of law isn't the issue for the appellate court when the initial defense is that the defendant didn't know the law.

The main issue is whether the law requires specific intent. The strict liability clause says you don't have to know the law to be guilty unless you have specific intent. So if the owner didn't know the law, does that require specific intent to commit the crime? No, because strict liability allows for that.

Looking at the options:

A: No because habits imply intent. But mistake of law doesn't require that. The owner's actions were done habitually, but that's about intent, not the law. So this might not be right.

B: No because the practice is dangerous. I thought the practice is dangerous, but that's about whether the law is necessary. B is talking about the necessity, not whether the law requires intent.

C: Yes because requires both knowledge and intent. That's correct because the law requires specific intent. So the question is whether the defendant's knowledge was present. The owner's knowledge of the law isn't mentioned or proven.

D: No because the practice is dangerous. Again, same as B; it's about necessity, not about the law's requirements.

E: Yes because not given a chance. That's about fault in court, not the law itself.

F: No because ignorance is not a defense. That's exactly what the question is about.

G: Yes because not a U.S. resident. No, the resident status doesn't affect the law; the law applies regardless.

H: Because he's a business operator. Again, irrelevant because the law applies regardless of occupation.

I: Yes because not given a chance to defend. Same as E.

J: Yes because given a chance. No, irrelevant.

So the question is whether the law requires specific intent. Since the owner didn't know, the answer is that the law doesn't require that. Therefore, the judge's instruction about mistake of law being a defense is not relevant because the defendant's specific intent isn't required.

So the correct answer would be B or F. Wait, the options:

Option B says "No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required." That's about the necessity for the law, but the law doesn't require intent because it's strict liability.

Option F says "No, because ignorance of the law is not a valid defense." That's exactly the point.

So the correct reasoning is that because the owner was unaware, the law doesn't require that, so the answer is F.

The correct answer is F. The owner's ignorance of the law does not negate the strict liability of the offense. The law requires only knowledge of the law and specific intent to commit the crime, not the absence of such knowledge. 

Answer: F
