Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the EM algorithm and Q-learning. Let me see if I can figure this out. 

The question presents two statements and asks whether each is true or false. The statements are about the EM algorithm's properties and a disadvantage of Q-learning.

Starting with Statement 1: "The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the EM algorithm." I remember that EM stands for Expectation-Maximization. From what I recall, EM is an iterative algorithm that aims to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in statistical models, especially when the model depends on unobserved latent variables. The key point is that it's guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood function. But does it always increase? I think yes, because each iteration either increases or keeps the likelihood the same. So Statement 1 is true.

Now Statement 2: "One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment." Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique. It doesn't require knowing the environment model; instead, it learns by trial and error. So the statement is correct in saying that it doesn't require prior knowledge, hence it's a disadvantage. So Statement 2 is also true.

Looking at the options: they're labeled A to J, each with whether each statement is true or false. So both statements are true, which would make option A correct (True, True). 

Wait, but I should double-check. For Statement 2, the description is accurate. Q-learning doesn't need prior knowledge, so it's a disadvantage. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

So the answer should be A: True, True.

The correct answer is A: True, True.
