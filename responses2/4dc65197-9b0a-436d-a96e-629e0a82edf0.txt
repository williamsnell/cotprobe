Question:

A woman joined a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creation of an account before she could enter. On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?

Options:

A: The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.
B: The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.
C: The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.
D: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.
E: The woman will prevail because she did not explicitly agree to the recurring charges.
F: The woman will prevail because she was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges.
G: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.
H: The woman will prevail because the terms were not explicitly stated before she made the initial payment.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this question, so let me read through it carefully. Okay, the scenario is a woman joining a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creating an account before she could enter. She did that, paid $50 for a credit report, and it was supposed to be automatic. But wait, the next 6 months, her credit card was charged automatically, except she received email notices. The terms and conditions say she can't cancel the charges without her prior notice.

Hmm, so the woman entered the account, paid $50, and the credit card started being charged without her knowing. She received email notices, but the condition was for the next 6 months. The question is: who will prevail on whether she was bound to pay for those 6 months until she canceled?

The options are A to H, and I need to choose the right one.

First, let's break down the terms. The site's terms and conditions say she can't cancel the charges without notice. But she didn't pay her $50 upfront. She's confused because she didn't cancel the credit card, but the charges started automatically. She received notice via email, but maybe not via the terms.

Wait, looking at the terms again: when she signed up, the notice was in bold, saying it's a contract. So she didn't access it, but the site required creating the account before entering. That might mean that the terms were available only when she created an account, but she didn't do that immediately.

Now, the key here is whether she was bound to pay the $50. She didn't cancel her subscription, so the default might be that she agreed to the charges without prior notice. Because the charges started even though she didn't cancel, she's not paying without notice. So she's the one who's being bound because she didn't cancel, implying she agreed to the terms.

Wait, but the options suggest different outcomes. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says the company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms. Option G says the company will prevail because the woman didn't cancel and thus accepted the terms.

Hmm, the woman didn't cancel, so she might have implicitly agreed. But in some jurisdictions, if you don't cancel, you're not bound, but the terms might still apply. However, sometimes the terms are considered implied when you don't cancel. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options are about who will prevail. So the question is whether the woman was bound to pay until she canceled. She didn't pay until the charges started, which was a month or two later. So she didn't pay without notice, implying she was bound. So the company's case might be that she didn't pay, but she didn't have notice. Alternatively, the woman's case is that she didn't cancel, so she agreed to the terms.

Wait, but the woman didn't cancel her account, so she didn't exercise the option to terminate the subscription. But the charges continued, so she's not bound. So perhaps the company's position is that she didn't pay, but the charges continued because she didn't cancel. So the default would be that she's bound to pay without notice, but she didn't cancel, so she's not bound. Or wait, maybe the terms were in place, but she didn't pay until the charges started, so she's still bound.

Alternatively, perhaps the terms were in effect regardless because she didn't cancel. So she's implicitly agreed to the charges. If that's the case, the company might argue that she didn't pay because she didn't cancel, but she's not paying, so the company wins because she didn't cancel.

Wait, but the woman didn't cancel, so she didn't have the right to terminate. But the charges continued, so she's still bound because she didn't cancel. So the company's position is that she was bound because she didn't pay without notice. The woman, on the other hand, could argue that she didn't have the right to cancel because she didn't pay, but that doesn't directly tie to the terms.

Wait, but the charges were automatic, and the site's contract says she can't cancel without notice. So the contract is that she's bound to pay unless she cancels with notice. But she didn't cancel, so the charges continued. So she's not bound. So the company's claim is that she didn't pay, but she's not paying because she didn't cancel. The woman's claim is that she didn't have the right to cancel, so she was bound to pay.

But the options are about who wins. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.

Option G: The company will prevail because the woman didn't cancel and thus accepted the terms.

I'm a bit stuck. So, when a service is provided without cancellation, sometimes the service is considered automatically available. But the terms say you can't cancel without notice. So she didn't cancel, meaning she agreed to the charges.

Wait, but in some cases, if you don't cancel, you're not bound to pay, but in others, the default is that you're bound. Maybe the woman didn't pay, so she's not bound to pay, but the default is that she was bound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if she didn't pay, but the terms were in place, she's still bound. So the company is saying she didn't pay, so the terms are in place. The woman is saying she didn't cancel, so she was bound.

Wait, but how is this a binding agreement? The terms say you can't cancel without notice. So the company's argument is that the terms are in place, and she's not paying because she didn't cancel. So the company is correct.

So the woman is the one who failed to cancel, so implicitly she agreed to the terms. So the company's position is that she was bound to pay, but she didn't act. So the company wins because the terms are in place regardless of whether she canceled.

So looking at the options, option D says the company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel and thus implicitly agreed. Option G says the company will prevail because the woman didn't cancel and thus accepted the terms.

Wait, the woman didn't cancel, so she agreed to the terms. So the company would say she was bound because she didn't pay, but she didn't have the right to. Alternatively, the terms are in place regardless of cancellation.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me think of a similar situation. If a service is provided without cancellation, the default is that you can't cancel, but that's not always the case. If the terms say you can't cancel without notice, then in that situation, you're bound to pay.

So in this case, the woman didn't cancel, so she agreed to the charges. So the company would say she was bound, so the answer is D or G.

Wait, the options are about who wins. The question is, on whether she was bound, or on whether she was implicitly agreeing.

If the woman didn't cancel, she was implicitly agreeing to the terms. So the company would say she was bound, so the woman didn't pay because she didn't cancelâ€”so the company is right.

Alternatively, the woman may not have been bound because the contract was provided via the site, which required creating an account. If she didn't create an account, she didn't know the terms. But she did create an account, so the terms were in place when she created it. Then she didn't pay until the charges started.

Wait, that's a different angle. She created an account, so the terms were available. But she didn't pay until the next 6 months. So she's not bound to pay unless she cancels with notice.

So the woman is not bound because she didn't cancel. Thus, the company's position is that she was implicitly bound to pay despite not paying immediately because she didn't cancel. So the company would win because she didn't pay because she didn't cancel.

So the correct option would be D or G.

Wait, option D says the company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel and thus implicitly agreed.

Option G says the company will prevail because the woman didn't cancel and thus accepted the terms.

Wait, the woman didn't cancel, so she implicitly agreed. So the company is saying she was bound, so she didn't pay. So the company wins.

So the answer would be D.

But I'm a bit torn because sometimes, if you don't cancel, you're not bound. But in this case, the terms say you can't cancel without notice. She didn't cancel, so she was bound, but the charges continued because she didn't pay.

Wait, the charges continued even though she didn't pay. So she's not paying because she didn't cancel, but she didn't notice the charges. So the company's argument is that she didn't pay, but she's not paying because she didn't cancel. So the company is correct in saying she was bound, and the woman is not.

So the correct answer is D: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.

Wait, but the woman didn't cancel, so she agreed to the terms, meaning the company is right.

So the correct answer is either D or G.

Wait, the options are:

A: Company wins because notice is bold and easy to find.

B: Terms are contracts of adhesion, mainly unenforceable.

C: The notice was in bold, so woman didn't pay.

D: Company wins because she didn't cancel thus implicitly agreed.

E: She didn't cancel, so she implicitly agreed.

F: She wasn't given notice.

G: She didn't cancel thus accepted.

H: She didn't pay upfront.

Wait, the woman didn't pay upfront. So is she implicitly agreeing to the recurring charges?

So the woman didn't pay the initial $50, but she didn't cancel. So she was bound to pay because she didn't cancel. So, the company's position is that she was bound, but she didn't pay.

So the correct option is D or G.

Wait, if the woman didn't pay, she's not bound, because the terms say she can't cancel without notice. So she didn't pay, but she didn't have notice. So the company is right because she was bound to pay, but she didn't.

So, the woman is not implicitly agreeing because she didn't pay, but the terms being in place.

But the problem is whether she was bound to pay because she didn't cancel. She didn't pay until the charges started. So she was not bound because she didn't pay, but the terms were in place.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me re-examine the options.

Option D: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.

Option G: The company will prevail because the woman didn't cancel and thus accepted the terms.

So, if the woman didn't cancel, she implicitly agreed. So the company is correct in saying she was bound. So the answer is D.

Alternatively, if the terms were in place, she didn't pay, but she didn't have notice. So the company wins because she was bound.

Wait, the options are about who wins. So if the woman didn't pay, the company wins because she was bound. So the woman, perhaps, didn't have the right to not pay if she didn't cancel.

Wait, but the woman didn't pay, so the company wins because she wasn't in the right to not pay. So the answer is D.

But wait, the correct answer is D or G.

The question is whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled. She didn't pay, but she didn't cancel. So she wasn't bound because she didn't pay. Therefore, the company wins because she was bound.

So the correct answer is D: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.

Wait, but in the options, I'm looking for which party will prevail on the issue of whether she was bound. So the answer is the company wins because she was implicitly agreed, so the woman didn't pay because she didn't cancel, but the terms were in place.

So the correct answer is D.

The woman joined a credit reporting site to get her credit reports but faced a situation where she paid $50 upfront for a credit report without canceling. The terms stated she couldn't cancel without notice, and her charges continued despite her lack of cancellation. The key issue is whether she was bound to pay, implying she agreed to the recurring charges.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The contract was provided when she created an account, which was not done by her, so the bold notice doesn't preclude her from using it.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The terms were contracts of adhesion, not enforceable, making this irrelevant.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The notice was only available when she created an account, not upon her initial payment.
- **Option D**: Correct. The woman didn't cancel, so she implicitly agreed to the terms, making the company's position valid.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. She did cancel, so she didn't fail to agree.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. She didn't receive notice of the recurring charges.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. She didn't cancel, so she was not bound by the terms.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. She paid upfront, so she wasn't bound.

The correct answer is **D**, as the company wins because the woman implicitly agreed to the terms by not canceling, despite not paying.
