Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about charges on an x-axis and finding another charge that would make the net force on a charge at the origin zero. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

So, the setup is: there are two point charges on the x-axis. One is +6.0 microcoulombs at x=8.0 meters, and another is -4.0 microcoulombs at x=16.0 meters. We need to find the charge that should be placed at x=24 meters so that any charge placed at the origin experiences no electrostatic force.

Hmm, I remember that if a charge is placed at the origin and there's no net force, the electric fields from the other charges at the origin must cancel each other out. So, the electric field from each existing charge at the origin has to sum to zero.

The electric field E due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law: E = k * q / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (about 8.99e9 N·m²/C²), q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point where the field is being calculated.

Wait, but since the origin is where the charge is placed, r is just the distance from the charge to the origin. So, for the first charge at x=8.0 m, the distance to the origin (0,0) is 8 meters. For the second charge at x=16 m, the distance is 16 m. And we're adding the third charge at x=24 m, which would be 24 m from the origin.

So the electric field at the origin due to each charge is:

E1 = k * (6.0e-6 C) / (8)^2
E2 = k * (-4.0e-6 C) / (16)^2
E3 = k * (q) / (24)^2

We want E1 + E2 + E3 = 0 because the net force is zero.

Wait, but how are the fields arranged? Let me think about the directions. Assuming all the charges are along the x-axis, the positive charge at 8m will create a field to the right (since positive charges create fields away from themselves), and the negative charge at 16m will create a field to the left (since negative charges attract, so the field from -4.0 is towards the origin, which is to the left). The third charge at 24m is positive, which would create a field to the right.

So, the forces (and thus the fields) from E1 and E2 are in opposite directions, and E3 is in a direction that depends on its sign.

Wait, but wait, the problem says any charge placed at the origin would experience no force. So E1 and E2 must cancel each other, and E3 must be zero or something. Wait, no, because E3 is directly from the third charge. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The net electric field at the origin must be zero. So E1 (from +6.0 μC) plus E2 (from -4.0 μC) plus E3 (from the unknown charge) equals zero.

So, E1 + E2 + E3 = 0.

E3 is from the charge at 24m, so E3 = k*q/(24)^2.

Let me compute E1 and E2 first.

E1 = k*(6e-6) / (8)^2 = (k *6e-6) /64 = (k*6e-6)/(8^2) = (k *6e-6)/64.

Similarly, E2 = k*(-4e-6)/(16^2) = k*(-4e-6)/256.

Wait, wait, no: the signs matter because it affects the direction. So, E1 is to the right, E2 is to the left. So, if I take right as positive, E2 is negative.

So, E1 (right) is positive, E2 (left) is negative.

So, E1 + E2 + E3 = 0.

E3 is the field from the third charge. If the third charge is positive, E3 is to the right. If it's negative, E3 is to the left.

So, let's write the equation:

E1 + E2 + E3 = 0.

E1 = k * 6e-6 / (8)^2.

E2 = k * (-4e-6) / (16)^2.

E3 = k * q/(24)^2.

So, substituting:

( 6e-6/(8^2) ) * k  + ( (-4e-6)/(16^2) ) * k + ( q / (24^2) ) * k  = 0.

We can factor out k (since it's non-zero):

k [ 6e-6/(8^2) - 4e-6/(16^2) + q/(24^2) ] = 0.

So, the expression inside the brackets must be zero.

Compute each term:

6e-6/(64) = 6/(64e6) = (6/64) μC/m²? Wait, not sure, but let's compute each coefficient.

6e-6 / (8^2) = (6e-6)/(64) = 6/(64e6) = 3/(32e6) = 3/(32,000,000) )= 0.00000009375 μC/m²?

Wait, no, let's compute the numerical values.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute each term as a coefficient for (1/r²), and then solve for q.

Let me compute E1 and E2:

E1 = (6e-6) * k / (8)^2 = (6e-6 * k) /64.

E2 = (-4e-6 * k) / (16)^2 = (-4e-6 *k)/256.

So the sum E1 + E2 must be equal to -E3, because E3 is the third term.

Wait, no, the sum E1 + E2 + E3 = 0 → E3 = -(E1 + E2).

So, E3 = -( [6e-6 /64] - [4e-6/256] ) *k.

Wait, let me compute the numbers.

Compute each term:

6e-6/(8^2) = 6e-6 /64 = 6/(64e6) = 6/(6.4e7) = 0.00000009375 μC/m².

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each coefficient as (q/ r²), then sum.

So, the equation is:

6e-6/(8^2) + (-4e-6)/(16^2) + q/(24^2) ) = 0.

So,

6/(64) μC/m² -4/(256) μC/m² + q/(576) μC/m² = 0.

Compute each term:

6/64 = 0.09375,

-4/256 = -0.015625,

q/(576) is the unknown.

So,

0.09375 - 0.015625 + [q/(576)] = 0.

Wait, 0.09375 minus 0.015625 is 0.078125.

So,

0.078125 + [q/(576)] = 0.

So, [q/(576)] = -0.078125.

Multiply both sides by 576:

q = (-0.078125) *576.

Calculate that:

0.078125 is 1/12.8 (Wait, wait 0.078125 is 1/12.8? Because 1/12.8 is 0.078125, yes.)

Wait, 576 * (1/12.8) = ?

Alternatively, 576 * 0.078125.

Let me compute 576 * 0.078125.

Hmm, 576 * 0.078125.

Wait, 0.078125 is 78.125e-3.

So, 576 * 78.125e-3.

Compute 576 * 78.125 = ?

Hmm, 576 * 78 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute:

576 * 0.078125 = ?

0.078125 is 1/12.8, so 576 /12.8.

Compute 576/12.8.

12.8 x 45 = 576 (since 12.8 *40=512, 12.8*5=64; 512+64=576). So 576 /12.8=45. So 45 * e-3 μC?

Wait, no. Wait, 0.078125 is 1/12.8. So 576 * (1/12.8) = 576 /12.8 =45.

So, 576/12.8=45. So, 0.078125 *576=45.

So q = -45 μC.

So the third charge must be -45 μC.

Looking at the options: option I is -45 μC.

Wait, the options are:

A: -50,

B: -40,

C: -30,

D: +30,

E:+60,

F:-60,

G:+45,

H:+50,

I: -45,

J: -75.

So the correct answer is I, -45 μC.

To determine the charge that must be placed at \( x = 24 \, \text{m} \) so that any charge placed at the origin experiences no electrostatic force, we analyze the electric fields created by the two existing charges at the origin and ensure their vector sum is zero.

The electric field at the origin due to a point charge \( q \) is given by:

\[
E = k \frac{q}{r^2},
\]

where \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the origin. The sign of the electric field depends on the charge's polarity: positive charges create fields to the right, and negative charges create fields to the left.

### Step 1: Electric fields due to the two charges
1. The charge \( +6.0 \, \mu\text{C} \) at \( x = 8.0 \, \text{m} \) creates an electric field:
   \[
   E_1 = k \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-6}}{8^2} = k \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-6}}{64}.
   \]
   This field points to the right (positive).

2. The charge \( -4.0 \, \mu\text{C} \) at \( x = 16.0 \, \text{m} \) creates an electric field:
   \[
   E_2 = k \frac{-4.0 \times 10^{-6}}{16^2} = k \frac{-4.0 \times 10^{-6}}{256}.
   \]
   This field points to the left (negative).

3. The unknown charge \( q \) at \( x = 24.0 \, \text{m} \) creates an electric field:
   \[
   E_3 = k \frac{q}{24^2} = k \frac{q}{576}.
   \]
   The direction of \( E_3 \) depends on the sign of \( q \): positive charges create fields to the right (positive), and negative charges create fields to the left (negative).

### Step 2: Net electric field at the origin must be zero
For the net electric field at the origin to be zero:
\[
E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 0.
\]

Substitute the expressions for \( E_1 \), \( E_2 \), and \( E_3 \):
\[
k \left( \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-6}}{64} \right) + k \left( \frac{-4.0 \times 10^{-6}}{256} \right) + k \left( \frac{q}{576} \right) = 0.
\]

Factor out \( k \) (since it is non-zero):
\[
\frac{6.0 \times 10^{-6}}{64} - \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-6}}{256} + \frac{q}{576} = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( q \)
Compute the numerical coefficients:
1. \( \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-6}}{64} = 0.09375 \times 10^{-6} \),
2. \( \frac{-4.0 \times 10^{-6}}{256} = -0.015625 \times 10^{-6} \).

Substitute these into the equation:
\[
0.09375 - 0.015625 + \frac{q}{576} = 0.
\]

Simplify:
\[
0.078125 + \frac{q}{576} = 0.
\]

Isolate \( \frac{q}{576} \):
\[
\frac{q}{576} = -0.078125.
\]

Multiply through by 576:
\[
q = -0.078125 \times 576 = -45 \, \mu\text{C}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify the result
The calculated charge \( q = -45 \, \mu\text{C} \) ensures that the net electric field at the origin is zero. This charge creates a field to the left, canceling the fields from the two existing charges.

### Final Answer
The charge that must be placed at \( x = 24.0 \, \text{m} \) is \( -45 \, \mu\text{C} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
