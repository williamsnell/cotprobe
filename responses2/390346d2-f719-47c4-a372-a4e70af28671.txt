Okay, so I have this question about Einstein's special theory of relativity. Hmm, I remember that Einstein's theories are pretty fundamental, but I need to think through this carefully.

The question is asking about what Einstein said about the laws of physics. The options are A to J, each making different claims. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me start by recalling what I know about Einstein's theories. The special theory, which I think is the one about relativity, deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially at speeds less than the speed of light. Oh right, because at speeds close to light speed, relativity effects become significant.

Wait, Einstein's theory of relativity has two parts, special and general. The special theory, I think, deals with inertial frames of reference. An inertial frame is one that's not accelerating. So according to Einstein, the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. So that means, for example, that Newton's laws apply equally in all non-accelerating frames. But if a frame is accelerating, like in a car accelerating, the laws would appear different.

Looking at the options, option B says, "the same in all uniformly moving frames of reference." Uniformly moving, like an inertial frame, so this sounds right. Option A says it's only in non-accelerating, which is a bit more specific. Wait, no, the question is what Einstein said in general. So the theory applies to all frames, regardless of whether they're accelerating. Because in the theory, it's about inertial frames, which aren't necessarily moving at a constant speed. Oh wait, no, an inertial frame can't be accelerating, but a frame can be moving at a constant speed relative to another frame that is accelerating. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think in the special theory, the frames are inertial. So any frame that's not accelerating. So in that case, the laws are the same in such frames. But the question is about whether the laws are the same in all frames, regardless of their motion. If a frame is accelerating, that's a different situation, and the laws would appear different. So the laws are the same only in non-accelerating frames. But wait, that's option A. So what's the correct statement?

Wait, maybe I should think about the implications of relativity. Newton's laws are only valid in inertial frames. So Einstein's special theory replaces that with the idea that the laws are the same in all inertial frames, regardless of their motion. So if two observers are in different inertial frames moving at a constant speed relative to each other, they would see the same laws.

But then, what about frames that are accelerating? The laws don't apply in those frames, so the theory doesn't say anything about them. So Einstein's theory says the laws are the same in all inertial frames, but not about frames that are accelerating.

Looking back at the options, option B says "the same in all uniformly moving frames of reference." Uniformly moving is more general. It includes both non-accelerating and accelerating frames as long as they are uniform. Wait, no. Uniform motion means constant speed and direction. So for example, a car moving at a constant speed (non-accelerating frame) versus a car accelerating. But if so, then in the non-accelerating frame, the laws are the same. But in the accelerating frame, the laws would appear different.

Wait, the question is about the last option's statement. The options are all about what the laws are the same in, or different. So if Einstein said, "the same only in non-accelerating frames," that would be option A. But looking at the options again, option B is phrased as "all uniformly moving frames," meaning any frame that's moving uniformlyâ€”so including accelerated ones. But I thought the special theory only applies to non-accelerating frames.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. Einstein's theory says that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, which are frames that are not accelerating. So any frame that is moving at a constant speed relative to another inertial frame would see the same laws. But if a frame is accelerating, like in a car that's speeding up, then the laws would appear different. So the statement about the same laws applies only to non-accelerating frames. But the question is about what he said about the laws being the same in all frames, regardless of their motion. So if a frame is accelerating, the laws would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options are about what the laws are the same in. So, Einstein's special theory says the laws are the same in all inertial frames. So any frame that is non-accelerating. But the question is about whether the laws are the same in all frames, regardless of their acceleration. So if the frame is not accelerating, then the laws are same. But the question's options include statements about all frames, not just non-accelerating. So perhaps the correct statement is that the laws are the same in all frames, but that's not true because in accelerated frames, they don't apply.

Wait, another angle: Einstein's theory replaces Newtonian physics with the idea that the laws are same in all inertial frames. So the statement in option B is "the same in all uniformly moving frames of reference." Uniformly moving could include any frame, including accelerated ones. But that's not correct, because in accelerated frames, the laws are different.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: same in all uniformly moving frames. So all frames that are moving uniformly, regardless of acceleration.

Option A: same only in non-accelerating frames.

So what's Einstein's statement? He said the laws are the same only in non-accelerating frames, which would make A correct. But wait, the question is asking what he stated about the laws being the same in all frames, regardless of their motion.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again: The question is about what Einstein said. So the options are statements about the laws of physics being the same in different situations.

Option B: same in all uniformly moving frames. So if a frame is moving uniformly, like a car moving at a constant speed, then the laws are same. But if the frame is accelerating (like a car speeding up), the laws are different. So if the frame is accelerating, it's not uniformly moving. So B is saying that in all uniformly moving frames, the laws are the same. But that's not the case, because uniformly moving frames include non-accelerating ones, but any frame that is accelerating is not uniformly moving. So option B's statement is incorrect, because in that case, the laws would be different. So Einstein's theory only applies to non-accelerating frames, not to all uniformly moving frames that include accelerated ones.

Wait, but the question is about the laws being the same in all frames. So if a frame is accelerating, the laws are not same. So Einstein's theory doesn't apply to all frames. So the correct statement is that the laws are the same only in non-accelerating frames. That is, option A.

But wait, option B says: the same in all uniformly moving frames. So for example, if I have two frames, one uniformly moving, and another uniformly accelerated. But the second frame's laws are different. So in that case, the law is different. So the statement in B is incorrect. So the only correct statement is that the laws are the same only in non-accelerating frames, which is option A.

But wait, another thought. The question is about the last character of the answer, which is the letter chosen. So the correct option is either A or B?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The question is, 'The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.' So the correct answer is to choose the letter (A to J), and I have to pick one.

So the options are:

A: same only in non-accelerating frames.

B: same in all uniformly moving frames.

So Einstein's theory says that the laws are the same only in non-accelerating frames. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I thought the options were about what he said about the same laws in all frames. So if the question is about what he said about the same laws being the same in all frames, the correct answer would be A.

Wait, no. Because the correct statement is that the laws are same only in non-accelerating frames. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait, the options are about what he said. So the answer is either A, B, etc.

So the correct answer is A: same only in non-accelerating frames.

So the correct option is A.
</think>

The question asks about Einstein's statement regarding the laws of physics in his theory of special relativity. Einstein's special theory of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, which are frames that are not accelerating. This means that the laws of physics remain consistent in non-accelerating frames but appear different in accelerating frames. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "The same only in non-accelerating frames of reference." This correctly reflects Einstein's theory, as the laws of physics are the same only in non-accelerating frames.
- **Option B**: "The same in all uniformly moving frames of reference." While uniformly moving frames include non-accelerating frames, they also include accelerated frames, where the laws of physics would appear different. Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Options C to H**: These options discuss varying laws in different frames, which contradicts Einstein's theory.
- **Option J**: "Only applicable to objects moving at the speed of light." This is incorrect, as relativity applies to all speeds below the speed of light, not just those moving at the speed of light.
- **Option G**: "Different in all uniformly moving frames of reference." This is also incorrect, as uniformly moving frames include non-accelerating and accelerated frames, where the laws differ.

The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately describes Einstein's key statement about the laws of physics being the same only in non-accelerating frames.
