Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure out the required sample size for the quality engineer's study. Let me see what the question says.

The problem states that the engineer wants to be 98% confident that the maximum error of the estimate of the mean strength, μ, is 0.25. They have a preliminary sample of size n=32, with a sample mean of 35.68 and a standard deviation of 1.723. They're asking how large a sample is required, and there are multiple-choice options.

Hmm, I remember that this has to do with confidence intervals and margin of error. The formula for the margin of error when the population standard deviation is known is E = z*(σ/√n), where z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.

Wait, but in this case, they're using a preliminary sample. Oh, right! Since they're using a sample to estimate the population standard deviation, they should use the sample standard deviation, s, instead of σ. So the formula becomes E = z*(s/√n), and they want to solve for n.

The confidence level is 98%, which means the z-score is the value that leaves 1% in each tail of the standard normal distribution. Let me think, what's the z for 98% CI? I think the z-score for 98% confidence is about 2.326 because it's the value that corresponds to the upper 1% tail (since 1% is split equally on both sides, so 0.99). Let me recall exact values—wait, I'm pretty sure for 98% it's approximately 2.326, but I might be mixing up the exact number. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2.576 for 99% and 1.96 for 95%, so 2.326 for 98% is correct.

So, given E is 0.25, σ is 1.723, and z is 2.326. We can plug these into the formula and solve for n.

Wait, the formula is E = z*(s/√n). Let me rearrange this to solve for n. So, n = (z*s/E)^2.

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, compute z*s/E. So, z is 2.326, s is 1.723, E is 0.25.

So, 2.326 * 1.723 = let's see. 2.326 * 1.723. Let me multiply them: 2 * 1.723 is 3.446, 0.326 *1.723 is approximately 0.561. So total is about 3.446 + 0.561 = 4.007. Then, divide by E, which is 0.25. So 4.007 / 0.25 = 16.028.

Now, square that to get n. 16.028 squared is roughly (16)^2 =256, but let me compute it more accurately.

16.028 * 16.028:

Let me compute 16 *16 =256.

16 * 0.028=0.448.

0.028 *16=0.448.

0.028*0.028=0.000784.

Wait, no, that's not the right way to expand that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use (a + b)^2 where a=16 and b=0.028.

(16 + 0.028)^2 = 16² + 2*16*0.028 + (0.028)^2.

Compute each term:

16²=256.

2*16*0.028 = 32 *0.028 = 0.896.

(0.028)^2= 0.000784.

Adding them together: 256 + 0.896 = 256.896; then +0.000784 is 256.896784.

So approximately 256.897.

So n is approximately 256.897. But since n must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number. So 257.

Looking at the options, option F is 257. So the answer should be F.

To determine the required sample size for a 98% confidence interval with a margin of error (E) of 0.25, we use the formula:

\[
n = \left(\frac{z \cdot s}{E}\right)^2
\]

Where:
- \( z = 2.326 \) (z-score for 98% confidence),
- \( s = 1.723 \) (sample standard deviation),
- \( E = 0.25 \) (margin of error).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
z \cdot s = 2.326 \cdot 1.723 \approx 4.007
\]

Next, divide by \( E \):

\[
\frac{z \cdot s}{E} = \frac{4.007}{0.25} \approx 16.028
\]

Now, square this value to find \( n \):

\[
n = (16.028)^2 \approx 256.897
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to 257.
