Alright, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which formula best symbolizes the given sentence. Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: "Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it." 

First, I need to translate this into a logical expression. Let's identify the main parts.

1. The university raised tuition (U).
2. The president approved of it (P).
3. The board didn't prevent it (B). Wait, does "didn't prevent" mean B is false? Or does it mean "it didn't happen"? Hmm, if the board didn't prevent, it probably didn't do it, so maybe B is the negation, i.e., ~B represents that the board prevented it. Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify.

Wait, the phrase "the board didn't prevent it" probably means that the board prevented it. So if the board prevented it, then the president approved of it (P). So if the board didn't prevent it, then the president didn't approve of it (¬P). But the original sentence says the board didn't prevent it, so it's true that the president approved of it. So maybe B is that the board prevented it, so ~B is that the board didn't prevent it. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the original statement is: Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.

So, the structure is: Raising tuition (U) leads to two things: the president approved of it (P) and the board didn't prevent it (B). So in logic, this is an "since ... and ... and ..." which can be broken down as (U → (P ∧ ~B)).

Wait, or is it something else? Let's think again. The sentence is saying that U is true, and (P and not B) also hold. So the entire statement is a consequence of U holding. So the structure is U → (P ∧ ~B). So the formula would be U → (P ∧ ~B). Hmm, which would translate to U ⊃ (P ∧ ~B). Looking at the options, option J says U → (P ∧ ~B), which is option J.

Wait, but let me check all the options again because sometimes these symbolizations can be tricky.

Option J is U→(P ∧ ~B). So U implies (P and not B).

But let's look at each option:

A: U • (P ⊃ ~B) → U ∧ (P→~B). That would mean U is true, and if P is true then ~B is true. Which might not capture the correct structure. Because if U is true, then P must be true and B must be false. So A is a conjunction, not an implication.

Option B: U→(P ∨ ~B). That's another implication; it would say if U is true, then P or not B. But the original says P and not B, so B's implication would be if U, then either P or not B. Which isn't exactly the same as saying both P and not B. So B is wrong.

Option C: (U ∨ P) • B → U or P is true, and B is true. That doesn't seem right because the original says U happened, and the president approved of it, and the board didn't prevent it. So C seems incorrect.

Option D: U → (~P ∧ ~B). Hmm, that's if U, then not P and not B. But the original says the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it. So D seems incorrect because it's saying U leads to both ~P and ~B, which isn't the same as the "and" in the original.

Option E: (U → P) • B → So U implies P, and B is true. That would mean if U, then P, and B is true. But the original says that because of U, P and B is true. So E would require that B is true, but the original doesn't specify B's truth; it's just that the board didn't prevent it. So E might not be correct.

Option F: U→(P • B). So if U, then both P and B are true. But in the original, the board didn't prevent it, so B is false. So F is incorrect because B is false, but the sentence says the board didn't prevent it, which would imply B is false (since they didn't prevent it). So F would be saying U causes both P and B to be true, which isn't the case.

Option G: (~U → P) • B → If not U, then P, and B is true. That doesn't seem to fit the original statement. The original is about U leading to P and B being true, but G is about not U leading to P and B being true, which is the opposite.

Option H: B → (U • P). So if B is true, then U and P are true. But the original says that when U happens, the president approved (so P is true) and the board didn't prevent it (so B is false). So H's implication is that B being true causes U and P both to be true, which is not the case.

Option I: (P • ~B) → U. So if P and ~B are true, then U is true. That seems incorrect because the original doesn't say that if P and ~B are true, then U is true. The original is about U leading to P and B's negation.

Option J: U → (P ∧ ~B). So if U, then P and not B. That fits because U is true, and then the president approved (so P is true), and the board didn't prevent (so B is false, ~B is true). So J seems right.

Wait, but what about option E: (U → P) • B. So if U is true, P is true, and B is true. But the original says that the university raised tuition (so U is true), so the president approved (so P is true), and the board didn't prevent (so B is false). So E would be saying U leads to P and B being true, which doesn't align with the original. Because in the original, the board didn't prevent, so B is false, so E's structure would be U leading to P and B being true. So E would be U→P and B. So if U is true, P is true, and B is true. But the original says that because of U, P is true and B is false. So E is not correct.

So the correct formula is option J.
</think>

The correct symbolization is option J: U → (P ∧ ~B). This correctly captures the sentence's meaning: the university's raising of tuition leads to the president approving it (~B is false) and the board not preventing it (so B is false, ~B is true).

Answer: J
