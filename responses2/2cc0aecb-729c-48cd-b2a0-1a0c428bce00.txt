Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is dy/dt equals the square root of t, and we know that y(1) is 1. We need to find y(4). The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a differential equation like dy/dt = f(t), you can find y(t) by integrating both sides with respect to t. So in this case, I should integrate sqrt(t) with respect to t. 

Wait, sqrt(t) is the same as t^(1/2), right? So the integral of t^(1/2) dt. I think the integral of t^n is (t^(n+1))/(n+1), as long as n isn't -1. So applying that here, n is 1/2. So the integral would be (t^(3/2))/(3/2), which simplifies to (2/3) t^(3/2). 

But wait, I should add a constant of integration, C, because when you integrate, you get an infinite number of solutions. So the general solution is y(t) = (2/3) t^(3/2) + C. 

Now I need to find the particular solution that satisfies y(1) = 1. Let's plug t = 1 into the equation. So 1 = (2/3)(1)^(3/2) + C. 1^(3/2) is just 1, so 1 = 2/3 + C. Solving for C, subtract 2/3 from both sides: C = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. 

So the specific solution is y(t) = (2/3)t^(3/2) + 1/3. Now I need to find y(4). Plugging t = 4 into the equation: y(4) = (2/3)(4)^(3/2) + 1/3. 

Wait, 4^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(4)^3. The square root of 4 is 2, and 2 cubed is 8. So that term becomes (2/3)*8 = 16/3. Then add 1/3: 16/3 + 1/3 is 17/3. 

Wait, 17 divided by 3 is about 5.666..., right? So approximately 5.666666... So looking at the options, let me see the choices. Option G is 5.667, which seems to match. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. 4^(3/2) is 4^1.5, which is indeed 8. Then (2/3)*8 is 16/3, which is 5 and 1/3, so 5.333... Wait, wait a second. Wait, 16/3 is 5.333..., no, wait, 3 times 5 is 15, so 16/3 is 5.333... Or wait, 16 divided by 3 is 5.333... Wait, but I thought 17/3 is about 5.666... Oh wait, because 2/3 * 8 is 16/3, and adding 1/3 gives 17/3, which is approximately 5.666... So that's correct.

Looking back at the options: G is 5.667, which is the decimal approximation of 17/3. So the answer should be G.

The differential equation is dy/dt = √t. Integrating both sides gives y(t) = (2/3)t^(3/2) + C. Using the initial condition y(1) = 1, we find C = 1/3. Thus, y(t) = (2/3)t^(3/2) + 1/3. Plugging in t = 4, y(4) = (2/3)(8) + 1/3 = 17/3 ≈ 5.667. The correct option is G.

Answer: G
