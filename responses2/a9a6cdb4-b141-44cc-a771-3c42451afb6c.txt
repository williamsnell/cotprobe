Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.
â€”Voltaire, in a letter, 1755

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Enlightenment philosophy and the Romantic Movement. Hmm, I need to figure out which philosopher was questioned on reliance on reason and started the Romantic Movement with the given rationale.

Alright, let's break it down. The question gives me a passage from Voltaire's letter about the Lisbon earthquake and asks which of the options corresponds to the Enlightenment philosopher who questioned reliance on reason and who began the Romantic Movement for a particular reason.

First, I remember that the Romantic Movement was a response to the Enlightenment, particularly to Immanuel Kant. The movement emphasized emotion, reason, and the human condition, often critiquing Enlightenment ideas like reason being the sole determinant of moral behavior.

Looking at the options:

A: Hobbes thought nature was cruel, which relates to his views on human nature, more along the lines of moral philosophy than the Romantic Movement.

B: Rousseau believed society was corrupting the noble soul. That's more about societal issues, not necessarily questioning reason's role.

C: Wollstonecraft against women. She was a proponent of gender equality, which doesn't tie into questioning reason.

D: Diderot thought emotions were superior. He was an early proponent of the Enlightenment's idea of reason, but also believed in the importance of emotion and social harmony. This seems more in line with the Enlightenment rather than the Romantic Movement.

E: Locke felt individuals were corrupted by power. He's known for his ideas on government, but his main work was on natural law and the idea that reason could explain the universe, not directly questioning reason's sufficiency.

F: Kant's view on reason being insufficient. That's exactly the key point. The Romantic Movement was driven by thinkers like Voltaire and others who critiqued reason and argued that it couldn't explain moral complexities.

G: Smith's statement about reason not understanding another's feelings. Smith was an early advocate for reason and social harmony, but the Romantic Movement was more about the role of emotion and reason's limitations.

H: Voltaire criticized nature's cruelty. His letter discusses human suffering, which might be part of his critique, but is it the reason for the movement? Well, he's often associated with radical ideas, but the movement's rationale is more about emotion, not necessarily his critique of nature.

I: Montesquieu's idea that governments aren't fair. That's more about the Enlightenment's critique of power and government structure, which is part of the broader Enlightenment ideas, not the specific movement driven by the reasoning part.

J: Hume, his idea that reason is inadequate to make moral judgments. That's right, Hume is a key figure in the Romantic Movement as he argued against a strict separation of reason and emotion.

So looking again, the options that fit are either F (Kant) or J (Hume). The question is asking which philosopher was questioned on reliance on reason and started the movement. The question's prompt is about the reasoning behind the movement, which is about the rationales given.

Voltaire himself (H) is often seen as a proponent of the Enlightenment, but the movement's rationale is about the limitations of reason. So, between F and J.

The question is about the philosophical movement that began because they questioned reliance on reason. The movement's rationale is about the inadequacy of reason, so the correct answer is J: Voltaire (or H) because of his critique of reason's limitations, but J is the correct option given the options.

Wait, let me clarify. The options are:

H: Voltaire because he criticized nature and suffering.

J: Voltaire because he believed reason was inadequate.

Wait, the options are labeled with the answers.

Wait, the question says, "which of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?" So the question is which philosopher initiated the movement for a specific reason.

Voltaire's letter is about the Lisbon earthquake. His critique was about the nature of reason, so he was one of the initiators.

So the answer would be J: Voltaire because he believed reason was inadequate to explain moral issues.

Wait, but in the options, J is Voltaire because he thought reason was inadequate. So J is correct.

The question asks which Enlightenment philosopher questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement, citing a specific rationale. The Romantic Movement was driven by thinkers who emphasized emotion, reason, and the human condition, often critiquing Enlightenment ideals like reason being the sole determinant of moral behavior.

Analyzing the options:

- **H (Voltaire)**: His critique of nature and human suffering in his letter fits the Romantic Movement's rationale, which is about the inadequacy of reason.
- **J (Voltaire himself)**: His belief that reason was inadequate to explain moral complexities aligns with the movement's theme.

The correct answer is **J: Voltaire because he believed reason was inadequate to make moral judgments**.

Answer: J
