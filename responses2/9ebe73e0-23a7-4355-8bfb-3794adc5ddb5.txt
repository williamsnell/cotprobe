Okay, so I've got this question here that I'm trying to figure out. The problem says I need to find the number that makes the statement true: 48 meters equals Box millimeters. The options are given from A to I. Hmm, I remember that meters and millimeters are metric units, and the prefix 'milli' means a thousandth. So, I think I need to convert meters to millimeters somehow.

Wait, right, 1 meter is 1000 millimeters. So if I have 48 meters, I should multiply that by 1000 to get millimeters. Let me calculate that. 48 times 1000 is 48,000. So, 48 meters is equal to 48,000 millimeters. 

Looking back at the options, option B is 48,000. That must be the right answer. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A is 5, which seems too small because 48 times 5 is 240, which is way less than 48,000. Option C is 48, which would be 48 meters, which is the same as 48,000 millimeters only if we were converting meters to centimeters, not millimeters. So that's not right. Option D is 4,800,000. Wait, 48 meters is 48,000 millimeters, so 4,800,000 is way bigger. Option E is 500, which is much smaller than 48,000. Option F is 5,000, which is still less than 48,000. Option G is 480,000, which is even larger. Option H is 4,800, which is also smaller. Option I is 480, even smaller. So, only option B makes sense. 

I think I'm confident now. The correct answer is B, 48,000.
