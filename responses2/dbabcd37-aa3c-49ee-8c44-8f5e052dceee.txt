Okay, so I'm presented with a question about a child's medical examination and I need to figure out the diagnosis based on the findings. Let me break this down step by step.

The question is about a 4-year-old girl who's having a well-child exam. The key details I've noticed are the grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border and a soft mid-diastolic murmur on the lower left. Also, there are no other abnormalities mentioned.

First, I'll try to recall what each of these sounds represents. 

Systolic ejection murmur (SEMR) is usually a sign of a heart valve issue. The grade of the murmur (2/6) indicates the severity: 2 is moderate, 6 is severe. The 2 here suggests it's either mitral or tricuspid valve dysfunction.

The mention of the sternal border where the murmur is heard is important. MERs are often seen in mitral or tricuspid valve conditions. The fact that the sternal border is upper left and the murmur is along that area, along with the presence of an aortic stenosis, which is a soft murmur in the mid-diastolic, might be relevant. Wait, no, the mid-diastolic is usually from the ventricle, not the aorta. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the mid-diastolic murmur is heard in the lower left. The upper left is MER. So perhaps it's a tricuspid or mitral issue. But also, the aortic stenosis is a soft murmur in the mid-diastolic region. Wait, no, the aortic stenosis is usually a different kind of murmur, probably heard in the mid- ventriculocaroternal area. But in the mid-diastolic part, that might be a different kind. Hmm.

The patient is a 4-year-old, so any condition that's more severe (like atrium regurgitation) might be less likely as a cause of MERs. Also, a 4-year-old might have less of a risk for certain valve conditions, but that's probably not the main point here.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Mitral valve prolapse. That causes a lot of ejection murmur. It can lead to severe heart failure. Also, the upper left sternal border suggests that the left ventricle is ventriculospasm, which is a sign of mitral valve prolapse.

Option B: Tricuspid atresia. That's when the tricuspid valve is closed, leading to a small or no ejection. But the severity is 2/6, which is moderate, not atresia. Also, atresia is more often seen in children, but I think atresia is more acute and would have a different kind of ejection.

Option C: Transposition of the great arteries. That would lead to a lot of ejection, especially since the aorta is in the sternal area. But the aortic stenosis is a different murmur, and the mention of a 4-year-old might not have the aorta stenosis.

Option D: Tetralogy of Fallot. It causes a soft murmur in the mid-ventriculospasm region. But the upper left sternal border shows MER, which is more indicative of mitral or tricuspid issues.

Option E: Atrial septal defect. That causes atrial fibrillation and ejection murmur. But the aortusensitivity is soft and in the mid-diastolic, which is more indicative of a tricuspid or mitral issue. Also, a 4-year-old may have less aetiology for such a condition.

Option F: Ventricular septal defect. That causes Ventricular murmur, which is usually in the mid-ventriculospasm area. But the upper left is sternal, so maybe the aortusensitivity is more in the mid-ventriculospasm. Wait, but the aortusensitivity is soft in mid-diast, which is a different area. So perhaps this is not the one.

Option G: Coarctation of the aorta. That causes a stenosis in the aorta, but the aortusensitivity mentioned is soft in the mid-diast. So maybe not. Also, coarctation would be more likely in a higher age, but again, a 4-year-old might have less.

Option H: Mitral regurgitation. This is similar to tricuspid atresia, but more acute. The severity here is 2/6, which is moderate, so less likely. Also, regurgitation can cause a lot of ejection, which is probably not the case here.

Option I: Aortic stenosis. That's a soft murmur in the mid-diastolic area, but the upper left sternal border is a different location. So perhaps not this one.

Option J: Pulmonary stenosis. That's a different kind of murmur, usually in the chest, not in the sternal area. So not this.

Wait, so the MERs are in the upper left and mid-diastolic. So, could be mitral or tricuspid. Let me think about the characteristics of each.

Mitral valve prolapse (A) leads to ejection murmur. It's a common finding in young children, especially with MERs. The sternal border is upper left, which is typical of mitral. Also, a 4-year-old may have more of this, but it's possible.

Tricuspid atresia (B) would cause a small MER. But the severity here is 2/6, which is moderate, so maybe not.

The soft mid-diastolic murmur could also be tricuspid, but if the mer is upper left, and less severe, maybe tricuspid. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think of the possible causes. The upper left sternal border is a MER, which is usually seen in mitral or tricuspid. The upper part of the sternal is the upper left, and in a mitral, that side is usually ventriculospasm. Mitral issues can cause ejection murmur, especially in children, which could result in a 2/6 grade.

Also, the aortic stenosis is a soft murmur in the mid-diastolic area, but the sternal border is upper left, which is different. So perhaps the soft mid-diastolic is a tricuspid or mitral issue, but the upper part is ventriculospasm.

Wait, so if the upper part is ventriculospasm, it's more mitral. The lower part is mid-diastolic, which is tricuspid. So combining these, maybe it's a tricuspid atresia? Or could it be something else.

Alternatively, the presence of a 4-year-old, the likely answer is a mitral prolapse. Because, in children, especially with MERs, this is a common finding when there's a 2/6 grade. Also, the aortusensitivity in the mid-diast is not as likely because it's more likely to be a tricuspid or mitral issue.

Another angle: the patient is a 4-year-old, so the risk of a tricuspid atresia might be lower, but not impossible. Mitral regurgitation (H) is another possibility, but that can cause a lot of ejection.

Alternatively, the aortic stenosis (F) would have a soft murmur in the mid-diast, but the upper part is a MER. So, the upper is ventriculospasm (mitral), lower is mid-diastolic. So that fits a mitral issue.

So, looking at the options, option A is mitral valve prolapse, which would fit. So the answer is A.
</think>

The patient is a 4-year-old girl experiencing a well-child examination with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur (SEMR) along the upper left sternal border and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. No other abnormalities are noted. The key findings are:

1. **Systolic Ejection Murmur (SEMR):** The severity (2/6) suggests a mitral or tricuspid valve dysfunction. The upper left sternal border points to ventriculospasm, which is a hallmark of mitral valve prolapse.
2. **Mid-Diastolic Murmur:** This is typically associated with tricuspid or mitral issues. The upper part of the MER aligns with ventriculospasm, while the mid-diastolic murmur suggests a tricuspid atresia. However, the severity of the 2/6 grade leans toward a mitral issue.
3. **Risk Considerations:** The 4-year-old's age suggests a lower risk of tricuspid atresia, though it is not entirely impossible. Mitral regurgitation (H) is unlikely due to the ejection nature of the murmur and the presence of aortusensitivity in the mid-diastolic region.
4. **Other Conditions:** Conditions like coarctation of the aorta (G), aortic stenosis (F), tricuspid atresia (B), and coarctation (G) are less likely given the sternal border and mid-diastolic murmur. Pulmonary stenosis (J) is unrelated to the findings.

Given the severity of the MER, the sternal border, and the typical presentation of mitral issues in young children, the most likely diagnosis is **mitral valve prolapse (A)**.
