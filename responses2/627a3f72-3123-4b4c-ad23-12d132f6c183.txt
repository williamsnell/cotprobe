Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about calculating the work done and the corresponding horsepower. 

Alright, the problem states that a mass of 100 kg is being pushed at a constant speed of 2 m/s. The coefficient of sliding friction is 0.25. I need to find the power in watts and then convert that to horsepower. The options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that when an object moves at a constant velocity, the net force is zero. So the applied force must balance the frictional force. That helps because it tells me the force needed.

Frictional force is given by the formula F_friction = μ * m * g, where μ is the coefficient, m is mass, and g is acceleration due to gravity, which is about 9.81 m/s². Plugging in the numbers: 0.25 * 100 kg * 9.81 m/s². Let me calculate that. 100 kg * 9.81 is 981, times 0.25 is 245.25 N. So the frictional force is 245.25 Newtons.

Since the object is moving at a constant speed, the applied force F must equal the frictional force. So F = 245.25 N.

Power is calculated as the product of force and velocity. Power (P) = F * v. So 245.25 N * 2 m/s. Let me compute that. 245.25 * 2 is 490.5 watts. Wait, but looking at the options, A is 490, which is close. But wait, maybe I should be more precise.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 245.25 * 2 is 490.5, so 490.5 watts. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: option A is 490 watts, which would be 490.5 rounded down. But the other option, option E, is 500 watts. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the frictional force.

Wait, no, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the work done is force times distance, but since velocity is constant, work done is force times displacement. Alternatively, power is also force times velocity. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but wait, what's the power in horsepower? Because the question asks for the rate in watts and then in horsepower. So let's first get watts, then convert.

So 490.5 watts. But looking back, option E says 500 watts and 0.67 hp. Option A is 490 watts and 0.66 hp. Hmm. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. Oh wait, wait! The velocity given is 2 m/s, but perhaps it's not the same as the acceleration? No, because it's a constant speed, so acceleration is zero. So my earlier approach is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh wait! Wait a second. No, because when pushing something at a constant speed, the force is just overcoming friction. So power is F * v.

But wait, maybe the question is about the rate at which work is being done. That's exactly power. So 490.5 watts is the power in watts. But looking at the options, option E gives 500 watts, which is a bit more than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the frictional force. μ is 0.25, m is 100 kg, g is 9.8. So F_friction = 0.25 * 100 * 9.8 = 245 N. Correct. The applied force is 245 N, so power is 245 * 2 = 490 W. So that's 490 watts. But the options don't have 490; the closest is option A: 490 watts, 0.66 hp. But wait, option E is 500 and 0.67 hp. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the question. Oh wait, wait a minute—wait, did I miss any other forces? Like, maybe the person is pushing the mass, but perhaps if it's on a slope, there's a component of gravity. Oh, but the question says the floor, so it's a horizontal surface, so no incline. So the only force is friction and the applied force.

Wait, perhaps the coefficient is actually 0.25, but maybe I should have used 0.30 or another value? No, the question states 0.25. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the correct force. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second: when pushing an object at constant speed, the force needed is equal to the frictional force, which is μ * m * g. But wait, is that in the case of horizontal motion, yes.

So 245 N is correct. So 245 * 2 = 490 W. So I'm confident that's correct. So why are the options giving about 500? Oh wait—wait a second, perhaps the velocity given is 2 m/s but that's the rate at which the work is being done, but no, that's not the case. Because power is force applied multiplied by the velocity, which is the actual motion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the power as the rate at which the work is done. So yes, that's correct. So 490.5 W, which is 490.5, approximately 490.5. So looking at the options, option A is 490 watts. So why is there an option E at 500?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.25 * 100 kg = 25 kg, 25 kg times 9.8 is 245 N. Then 245 N * 2 m/s is 490 W. So 490 W. So the option A is 490 W. But option E is 500 W. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass is being pushed, but the question is in another way. Wait, no, because the problem states that the mass is being pushed at a constant speed, so the force is overcoming friction. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the power calculation. Wait, 245 N × 2 m/s is 490 W.

So the power is 490 W, which is option A. But option E is 500 W. So why is that?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute it.

Wait, 0.25 * 100 kg = 25 kg. No, wait, 0.25 * 100 is 25, correct. 25 kg * 9.8 m/s² is 245 N. So that's correct. So the applied force is 245 N.

Power is 245 N × 2 m/s = 490 W. So option A is 490 W, which is option A: 490 watts, 0.66 hp. But according to the calculation, 490 W. So why is option E 500 W? Maybe I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the work done is being done at a constant speed, but perhaps the problem is not considering the force as the only power source. Hmm, but no, the problem says 'work being done' which is the power.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the question is not considering that the work is done against the frictional force. No, no, because the applied force is the same as the frictional force, so the work done is the product.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the power is 490 W, but the question may have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different coefficient.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating power. Let me think: 245 N * 2 m/s = 490 W. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is not about the power being used to overcome friction, but the power needed to push the mass. So yes, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the conversion from watts to horsepower. 

Wait, 1 horsepower (hp) is approximately 745.7 watts. So 490 W is how much in horsepower?

Let me calculate that: 490 / 745.7 ≈ 0.658 hp, which is approximately 0.66 hp. So option A says 0.66 hp. So that would make option A correct.

But in the options, option A is 490 watts and 0.66 hp. So that would be correct. But why is option E 500 watts?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers once more.

Wait, 100 kg * 0.25 = 25 kg. 25 kg * 9.81 m/s² is 245.25 N. Wait, no, 0.25 * 100 kg is 25 kg, right. So 25 kg * 9.81 is 245.25 N. That's correct.

So 245.25 N * 2 m/s = 490.5 W. So 490.5 W is about 0.666 hp. So option A's 0.66 hp is correct.

Wait, but why is option E even an option? I don't see any error in my calculations. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 490 watts, 0.66 hp.

But wait, the options are A to J. Looking again, the options list:

A:490,0.66

E:500, 0.67.

So if the correct answer is 490 W and 0.66 hp, then option A is correct.

But wait, the initial calculation for power is 490.5 W, which is approximately 490 W. So option A is correct, but why is option E even present? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the work done is force times displacement, and that power is force times velocity. But wait, the work is being done by the force applied, so power is correctly 490 W.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the power being used to push, which is the same as the power calculated. So I think option A is correct. But wait, perhaps the problem is about the power in horsepower, but I should double-check the calculations.

Wait, 490.5 W divided by 745.7 W per hp. Let me compute 490.5 / 745.7. 

Let me compute that:

745.7 goes into 490.5 how many times? 

Well, 745.7 × 0.65 is about 483.7. 0.65 hp is 483.7 W. 490.5 - 483.7 = 6.8 W. So 6.8 W is about 0.009 hp (since 6.8 / 745.7 is approximately 0.009). So total is about 0.659 hp, roughly 0.66 hp. So option A is correct.

But wait, the options don't have any other options with 490 W. So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we calculate the power in watts and then convert it to horsepower. The mass is 100 kg, the velocity is 2 m/s, and the coefficient of sliding friction is 0.25. 

### Step 1: Calculate the frictional force
The frictional force is given by:
\[
F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \cdot m \cdot g
\]
where:
- \( \mu = 0.25 \),
- \( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

\[
F_{\text{friction}} = 0.25 \cdot 100 \cdot 9.81 = 245.25 \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the applied force
Since the mass is moving at a constant velocity, the applied force \( F \) equals the frictional force:
\[
F = 245.25 \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the power in watts
Power is given by:
\[
P = F \cdot v
\]
where:
- \( F = 245.25 \, \text{N} \),
- \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s} \).

\[
P = 245.25 \cdot 2 = 490.5 \, \text{W}
\]

### Step 4: Convert power to horsepower
1 horsepower (hp) is approximately 745.7 watts. Thus:
\[
\text{Power in hp} = \frac{490.5}{745.7} \approx 0.659 \, \text{hp} \approx 0.66 \, \text{hp}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the options
The calculated power is 490.5 W (approximately 490 W) and 0.659 hp (approximately 0.66 hp). The closest option is **A: 490 watts, 0.66 hp**.
