Question:

Mr. Riley loaned his friend, Mr. Gillis, $400 to purchase a second-hand car. One year later Mr. Gillis returned $420 to Mr. Riley. During that period, the consumer price index rose by 5%. a) What is the nominal rate of interest in this example? b) What is the real rate of interest?

Options:

A: Nominal rate is 6%, Real rate is -1%
B: Nominal rate is 3%, Real rate is 2%
C: Nominal rate is 5%, Real rate is 0%
D: Nominal rate is 6%, Real rate is 1%
E: Nominal rate is 10%, Real rate is 5%
F: Nominal rate is 2%, Real rate is -3%
G: Nominal rate is 5%, Real rate is -1%
H: Nominal rate is 4%, Real rate is 1%
I: Nominal rate is 4.5%, Real rate is -0.5%
J: Nominal rate is 7%, Real rate is 2%

Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Riley lending his friend Mr. Gillis money. He gave him $400, and after a year, he got back $420. I need to find the nominal and real rates of interest. Oh wait, and also consider that the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 5% during that time. Hmm.

Alright, let's start with part a) about the nominal rate of interest. The nominal rate is basically the stated interest rate without adjusting for inflation, right? So normally, the formula is: 

Nominal Interest = (Return Amount - Principal) / Principal * 100%

So plugging in the numbers: $420 - $400 = $20. So $20 over $400 is 0.05, which is 5%. Wait, but wait a minute, the problem says the CPI rose by 5%. How does that factor in?

Oh, right! The real rate of interest is calculated using the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. But wait, no, the formula for real interest rate is nominal rate minus inflation rate, and you have to consider whether it's nominal minus real or something else. Wait, no, the formula is:

Real Rate = (1 + Nominal Rate) / (1 + Inflation) - 1

Or, if you're calculating it another way, the real rate is approximately the nominal rate minus inflation rate, but only approximately because it's a small number.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about the nominal rate first, so maybe the inflation part is about purchasing power, but for the nominal rate, it's just the return on investment.

Wait, the problem only asks for the nominal rate in part a), so perhaps the inflation part is just extra info. Let me re-read the problem.

The question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So maybe the real rate is related to the inflation, but for part a), it's the nominal rate.

So probably, the real rate is another question, but for part a, it's the nominal rate. So for part a, I think it's 5%, because (420-400)/400 = 5%.

But wait, the options include a) 6% and others. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the real interest rate is calculated using the real return. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me by including the inflation, but part a) is just the nominal rate, so maybe they're separate.

Wait, the question says, "What is the real rate of interest?" Oh, but part a) is just about the nominal rate. So for part a, the answer is 5%, and part b) is about the real rate, which would be 5% - 5% = 0%. But looking at the options, option C is 5% nominal and 0% real. But wait, some options have other numbers. Let me check the options again.

The options for a) and b) are separate. Let me look at the options:

Options A to J:

A) 6%, -1% 

B) 3%, 2% 

C) 5%, 0% 

D) 6%, 1% 

E) 10%,5% 

F) 2%, -3% 

G)5%, -1% 

H)4%,1% 

I)4.5%, -0.5% 

J)7%,2%

So for part a, if the calculation is 5% (20/400), the nominal rate is 5% (option C says 5% nominal, 0% real). Then part b would be 5% - 5% = 0% real. So option C would be the correct answer.

Wait but wait, maybe the calculation for the real rate is (1 + 5%) / (1 + 5%) ) -1 = (1.05/1.05) -1 = 0. So yes, real rate is 0%. So option C.

But looking at the options, another option is a) 6% and b) -1%. So why would the nominal be 6%? Because maybe the return was 6% of the principal, but 420 is 400 +20, which is 5%, so that can't be.

Wait, unless the real rate is calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning, but I think the correct approach is to see that the return is 5% on the principal, so nominal rate is 5%. Inflation is 5%, so real rate is 0%.

So the correct option is option C: 5% nominal, 0% real.
</think>

The nominal rate of interest is calculated as the difference between the returned amount and the principal, divided by the principal, expressed as a percentage. Here, the friend returned $420 after lending $400, resulting in a nominal return of $20. The nominal rate is thus (20/400) Ã— 100% = 5%. The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 5%, but this does not directly affect the calculation of the nominal rate of interest. 

For the real rate of interest, the formula is: 
\[ \text{Real Rate} = \frac{1 + \text{Nominal Rate}}{1 + \text{Inflation}} - 1 \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Real Rate} = \frac{1 + 5\%}{1 + 5\%} - 1 = 0\% \]

Thus, the nominal rate is 5%, and the real rate is 0%.
