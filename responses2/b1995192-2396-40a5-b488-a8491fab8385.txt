Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a freight engine pulling a string of cars. Let me see what it's asking. Hmm, the string of freight cars weighs 200 tons. The coefficient of rolling friction is 0.005. The question is asking how fast the engine can pull the cars along, and the options are various miles per hour.

Wait, I remember that when a vehicle or a train is moving, the power provided by the engine is used to overcome friction and to accelerate the mass. But since the question is about how fast the engine can pull, I think it's more about the maximum speed the engine can achieve, which relates to the power and the frictional force.

So, first, I need to calculate the frictional force. Friction is given by the formula f = μ * N, where μ is the coefficient of rolling friction and N is the normal force. Here, the normal force N should be equal to the weight of the cars, right?

The weight of the cars is mass times gravity. The mass is 200 tons. Wait, I need to convert tons to kilograms because standard units are in kg and meters. I think 1 ton is approximately 907.185 kg. So, 200 tons is 200 * 907.185 = let's calculate that. 200 * 907 is 181,437 kg, but wait, better to compute exactly. 200 * 907.185 = 200*900=180000 plus 200*7.185=1437, so total 181,437 kg.

The gravitational acceleration is about 9.81 m/s². So the normal force N is mass * g, which is 181,437 kg * 9.81 m/s². Let me compute that: 181,437 * 9.81. Well, 180,000 * 9.81 = 1,765,800, and 1,437 *9.81 is approximately 14,092.77. So total is about 1,765,800 +14,092.77 = 1,779,892.77 N. Oh wait, but wait, that's the normal force, which is the weight. So friction force f is μ * N = 0.005 * 1,779,892.77.

Let me compute that: 0.005 times 1,779,892.77 is 8,899.463865 N. So f ≈ 8,899 N.

Now, power is given as 400 horsepower. But wait, power can be in different units. Oh, right, I think 1 horsepower is approximately 745.7 watts. So 400 hp is 400 * 745.7 = let's compute that. 400 *700 =280,000. 400 *45.7=18,280. So total is 298,280 watts, which is 298,280 J/s.

Power is also equal to force times velocity. So P = F * v, where v is in m/s. But wait, in the problem, the options are given in miles per hour. Hmm, so I need to convert the velocity we find from the power equation into miles per hour.

Wait, but the question is about how fast the engine can pull, so I think that's the maximum speed the engine can achieve, which is when all the power is used to overcome friction. So at that point, the engine's power equals the frictional force times the velocity.

So, setting P = F * v. Solving for v gives v = P / F.

But wait, the units here: P is in watts, F is in Newtons. So v would be in meters per second. Then we need to convert that into miles per hour.

So, let's compute v:

v = P / F = 298,280 watts / 8,899.463865 N ≈ 298,280 / 8,899 ≈ let's compute that. 8,899 *34 is about 303,566, which is a little more than 298,280. So 33. So 33 m/s.

Wait, 33 meters per second is about 73 miles per hour? Because 1 m/s is about 2.23694 miles per hour. So 33 m/s * 2.23694 ≈ 73.75 mph. But wait, the options don't have 73. They have 75. Oh, so maybe I have to be more precise with the numbers.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 298,280 divided by 8,899.463865 equals approximately 33.66 m/s.

33.66 m/s * (3600 s/hour) * (1 mile / 1609.34 m) = let's compute step by step.

First, 33.66 m/s * 3600 s/h = 12,117.6 m/h. Then, divide by 1609.34 to get miles. 12,117.6 / 1609.34 ≈ 7.53 mph. Wait, that's around 7.5 mph. But the options don't have 7.5. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the unit conversion. Let me double-check. Let's redo the calculation.

Compute v:

v = 298280 W / 8899.46 N ≈ 33.66 m/s.

Convert m/s to mph:

1 m/s = 3600 m / 3600 s = 3600 m/h. Then, 1 mile is 1609.34 m.

So 33.66 m/s = 33.66 * 3600 m/h = 121,176 m/h.

Then, 121,176 m/h divided by 1609.34 m/mile is approximately 75.3 mph.

Ah, okay, so about 75 mph. Looking back at the options, option B is 75 mi/hr. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought the maximum speed is when all the power is used to overcome friction, but is that actually the case? Because if the engine's power is more than just overcoming friction, it can also accelerate the cars. So, in reality, the actual maximum speed would be when the engine's power is entirely used to overcome friction. But if the system is moving at a certain speed, then the engine's power would be the sum of the power used to overcome friction and to accelerate.

Wait, but in this case, since the problem is asking for the maximum speed the engine can pull the cars, I think that's when the engine is just barely overcoming the friction, meaning the engine's power is entirely used for overcoming friction. So that's the scenario where the engine is providing just enough power to decelerate the cars at that speed. So the maximum speed is when the power is just enough to overcome friction.

So, our calculation gives v ≈75.3 mph, which is option B. But wait, the options don't have B as 75.3, they have B as 75 mi/hr. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that the power is entirely used to overcome friction, but perhaps I forgot to consider that the engine's power is used for both friction and acceleration. But if the engine is just barely able to pull the cars at that speed, then the power is just enough to overcome friction. So the maximum speed is determined by the frictional force and the power.

So, the calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 75.3 mph, which is option B.

To determine how fast the engine can pull the string of freight cars, we analyze the forces and energy involved. The problem involves calculating the maximum speed the engine can achieve, which occurs when the engine's power is entirely used to overcome friction. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Calculate the normal force (N):**  
   The weight of the freight cars is their mass multiplied by gravity. The mass is given as 200 tons, which converts to 181,437 kg. Using \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the normal force is:  
   \[
   N = m \cdot g = 181,437 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \approx 1,779,892.77 \, \text{N}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the frictional force (f):**  
   The coefficient of rolling friction is \( \mu = 0.005 \). Using \( f = \mu \cdot N \):  
   \[
   f = 0.005 \cdot 1,779,892.77 \, \text{N} \approx 8,899.46 \, \text{N}.
   \]

3. **Convert the engine's power to watts:**  
   The engine's power is given as 400 horsepower. Converting using \( 1 \, \text{horsepower} = 745.7 \, \text{watts} \):  
   \[
   P = 400 \, \text{hp} \cdot 745.7 \, \text{W/horsepower} = 298,280 \, \text{W}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the maximum speed (v):**  
   The power of the engine is related to the frictional force and the speed by \( P = F \cdot v \). Solving for \( v \):  
   \[
   v = \frac{P}{F} = \frac{298,280 \, \text{W}}{8,899.46 \, \text{N}} \approx 33.66 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

5. **Convert the speed to miles per hour (mph):**  
   Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{m/s} = 2.23694 \, \text{mph} \):  
   \[
   v = 33.66 \, \text{m/s} \cdot 2.23694 \, \text{mph/m/s} \approx 75.3 \, \text{mph}.
   \]

6. **Match the result to the options:**  
   The calculated speed of approximately \( 75.3 \, \text{mph} \) corresponds to option **B: 75 mi/hr**.
