Okay, so I've got this equation here: 6.73 equals z divided by 7.74. Hmm, I need to find the value of z. Let me think about how to solve this. 

Alright, so the equation is 6.73 = z / 7.74. I remember that to solve for a variable when it's divided by another number, I should multiply both sides by that number. So if I have something like a = x / b, then x is a multiplied by b. Applying that here, I should multiply both sides by 7.74 to get z by itself.

So, doing that, I get z = 6.73 * 7.74. Now I need to calculate that multiplication. Let me break it down to avoid mistakes. 6.73 multiplied by 7.74. Hmm, maybe I can do it step by step.

First, I'll ignore the decimals and think of 673 multiplied by 774. That's a bit tedious, but let's see:

673 * 774. Let's compute this:

Let me compute 673 * 700 first: 673 * 700 = 471,100.

Then 673 * 74. Let me compute that:

673 * 70 = 47,110 (because 673 *7 is 4,711; 4,711 *10 is 47,110).

673 *4 = 2,692.

Adding those together: 47,110 + 2,692 = 49,802.

Now, adding the two parts together: 471,100 + 49,802 = 520,902.

But wait, I forgot about the decimal places. The original numbers, 6.73 has two decimal places, and 7.74 has two as well. So total of four decimal places. So 520,902 would be 520,902.00 when considering four decimal places. But when I multiply 6.73 by 7.74, the correct product is 52.0902, right?

Wait, let me check with another approach. I can use the standard multiplication method.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach. But since I'm doing this manually, let me think. 6.73 times 7.74.

Another way: 6.73 * 7 = 47.11, and 6.73 * 0.74 = ?

Wait, maybe that's not the most efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 6.73 * 7.74 by breaking the numbers into parts.

Wait, let me try another method. Let's think of 7.74 as 7 + 0.74.

So, 6.73 * 7 = 47.11.

Then, 6.73 * 0.74. Let's compute that.

6.73 * 0.74:

Multiply 6.73 by 0.74.

First, 6.73 * 0.7 = 4.711.

Then, 6.73 * 0.04 = 0.2692.

Adding those together, 4.711 + 0.2692 = 4.9802.

So the total is 47.11 + 4.9802 = 52.0902.

Wait, but that gives me 52.0902. That makes sense.

So the product of 6.73 and 7.74 is 52.0902. Therefore, z equals 52.0902.

Looking at the options, option G is 52.0902. So that must be the correct answer.

The equation is 6.73 = z / 7.74. To solve for z, multiply both sides by 7.74:

z = 6.73 * 7.74.

Calculating this step by step, 6.73 * 7.74 equals 52.0902. Therefore, the correct answer is G.

Answer: G
