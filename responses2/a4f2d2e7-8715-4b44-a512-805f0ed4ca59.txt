Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says: What is the area, in square units, of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of 12π units?

Hmm, okay, so first, I need to find the radius of the circle. I remember the formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. So, given that the circumference is 12π, I can set up the equation:

12π = 2πr

To solve for r, I can divide both sides by 2π. Let me write that down:

12π / 2π = r

Simplifying that, 12 divided by 2 is 6, so:

6 = r

Wait, so the radius is 6 units. That means each side of the square is 6 units long. Now, to find the area of the square, I know the formula is side squared. So, area = 6² = 36 square units.

Let me check the options. Option C is 36, so that should be the correct answer.

The radius of the circle is found using the circumference formula \( C = 2\pi r \). Given \( C = 12\pi \), solving for \( r \) gives \( r = 6 \) units. The area of the square with side length \( r \) is \( 6^2 = 36 \) square units.

**Answer: C**
