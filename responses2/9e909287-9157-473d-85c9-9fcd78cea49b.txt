Okay, let's see. I've got this economics question here about a TV manufacturing firm changing prices to increase revenue and profits. Hmm. So the question is whether lowering the price from $350 to $320 was a good decision. 

So first, let me parse the numbers. Before the price drop, they sold 1,000 units per month at $350 each. After the price reduction, sales went up to 1,080 units, and the price per unit dropped to $320. Also, it says the unit production costs didn't change. So the main factors affecting this decision are the price change and the change in quantity sold.

Wait, price drops and increased quantity sold. So revenue is price multiplied by quantity. Let me calculate the original revenue and the new revenue. 

Original revenue was 350 * 1000 = 350,000. New revenue is 320 * 1080. Let me compute that. 320 * 1000 is 320,000, and 320 * 80 is 25,600, so total is 345,600. So the new revenue is $345,600, which is less than the original $350,000. So revenue actually decreased. That's interesting.

Wait, but the question is about whether the decision was a good one. So revenue decreased, which would mean the firm is worse off. But sometimes, even if revenue decreases, if profits go up, the decision could be good. So let me think about what's happening with profits.

Profit is (price - cost) * quantity. Assuming unit production costs didn't change, the cost per unit is the same before and after. Let's call the unit cost 'C'. The original profit per unit was 350 - C, and the new is 320 - C. Since the price decreased, the profit per unit may be lower or higher than cost, depending on the cost. But the quantity sold increased.

But let's see the exact profit change. The total profit before was (350 - C) * 1000. After, it's (320 - C) * 1080. Let me compute these.

Before: (350 - C)*1000 = 350,000 - 1000C.

After: (320 - C)*1080 = 320*1080 - 1080C = 345,600 - 1080C.

Comparing the two, the new profit is 345,600 - 1080C, and the original was 350,000 - 1000C. So the difference is (345,600 - 1080C) - (350,000 - 1000C) = 345,600 - 1080C -350,000 +1000C = (345,600 -350,000) + (-1080C +1000C) = (-4400) + (-80C) = -4400 -80C. So the profit decreased by 4400 +80C. Since the cost (C) is positive, the profit goes down.

Wait, but the original profit was (350 -C)*1000. After, it's (320 -C)*1080. So profit has decreased. So the firm's profits actually went down. But their revenues went down too.

Wait, but the question is whether the decision was a good one. So even though revenue went down, if profits went up, the decision would be good. But here, profits went down. So the firm is worse off.

Wait, but I'm supposed to figure out if the decision was a good one. So let's re-examine. The firm lowered price and saw a 1.08x increase in sales. So the quantity sold went up by 8%. But the price went down by 3.29%. 

The revenue change is a decrease because 320/350 is approximately 0.914 (so about 91.4% of original price), and the quantity went up by 8%, so 0.914 * 1.08 ≈ 0.981, which is a 1.9% decrease in total revenue.

But the firm is comparing revenues and profits. So the question is whether the revenue decrease was offset by an increase in profit.

Wait, but since the unit production costs didn't change, the profit per unit is (320 - C) per unit, and (350 - C) before. Since the price dropped, the profit per unit may be lower than before. But the quantity sold increased. So which effect is stronger?

Let me think numerically. Let's assume the cost is $300 per unit. Then before, profit per unit was $50, and after, it's $20. Original revenue: 1000 * $50 = $50,000. New revenue: 1080 * $20 = $21,600. So the firm's revenue goes down by $28,400.

Profit before: 1000 * 50 = $50,000. Profit after: 1080 * 20 = $21,600. So the profit drops by $28,400 as well.

But wait, that's an example. Let me try another cost. Let's say cost is $320. Before, profit per unit is 30, after is 0. So profit before is 1000*30=30000. After, profit is 1080*0=0. So profit goes down by 30000.

But in both cases, the firm's revenue went down. Let me think about the general case.

Profit change: (price - cost) * quantity. Before: (350 - C)*1000. After: (320 - C)*1080.

Profit change = after - before = (320 - C)*1080 - (350 - C)*1000.

Let me compute this:

= 320*1080 - C*1080 -350*1000 + C*1000

= (320*1080 - 350*1000) + C*(-1080 +1000)

= (345,600 - 350,000) + C*(-80)

= (-4400) + (-80C) 

So the profit change is -4400 -80C. Since C is positive, the profit change is negative. So profit decreased.

So the firm's profits went down, and revenues also went down. So the decision to lower prices resulted in both revenues and profits decreasing.

But the question is whether the decision was a good one. So, in this scenario, the firm's revenues went down, but profits also went down. So the decision didn't lead to any improvement in revenues or profits. So the decision was not good.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute.

Profit change = (320 - C) * 1080 - (350 - C)*1000

= 320*1080 - 1080C -350*1000 + 1000C

= (320*1080 - 350*1000) + (-1080C +1000C)

Compute 320 *1080: let's calculate 320 * 1000 = 320,000, plus 320*80=25,600 → 345,600.

350 *1000 = 350,000.

So 345,600 - 350,000 = -4,400.

The C terms: (-1080 +1000)C = (-80)C.

So profit change is -4400 -80C. Since C is positive, the profit change is negative. So the firm's profit went down.

Similarly, the revenue change is (320*1080) - (350*1000) = 345,600 - 350,000 = -4,400. So revenue decreased by 4,400.

So both revenues and profits went down. So the decision was to lower prices, which resulted in both revenues and profits decreasing.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Wait the options are:

Options:

A: The decision was a poor one

B: The decision had no effect

C: The decision was a good one

D: The decision increased profits

E: The decision increased profits but not revenues

F: The decision increased revenues but not profits

G: The decision had no effect on revenues but increased profits

H: The decision decreased both revenues and profits

I: The decision had no effect on profits but increased revenues

J: The decision increased revenues but not profits

Wait, so the correct decision was to decrease revenues and profits. So looking at the options, which option says the decision decreased both revenues and profits?

Option G says, "The decision had no effect on revenues but increased profits." No, that's not correct because profits decreased. Option H says, "The decision decreased both revenues and profits." Yes, that's exactly what we've found.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The firm's profit went down, so option G says the decision had no effect on revenues but increased profits — but in reality, both revenues and profits went down. So the correct option is H.

Wait no, H says "The decision decreased both revenues and profits." So H is correct.

But wait, let me verify.

So in the first case, before price drop, profit was (350 - C)*1000. After, (320 - C)*1080.

Comparing, since 320 is less than 350, and the quantity increased, but because the price drop is more than the quantity increase multiplied by the per-unit cost.

But the calculated profit change was negative, so the firm's profits went down.

So the decision to lower prices led to both revenues and profits decreasing. So the correct answer is H: The decision decreased both revenues and profits.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the price elasticity of demand is involved here.

Alternatively, perhaps the firm's decision was a good one because the increase in sales was enough to offset the price decrease, leading to higher profits.

Wait, but according to the numbers I computed earlier, profits went down. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me try with a different cost. Let's say the cost is $300.

Original profit: (350 - 300)*1000 = 50*1000 = $50,000.

After price drop: (320 -300)*1080 = 20 *1080 = $21,600.

So profit decreased by $50,000 - $21,600 = $28,400. So profits decreased.

So again, both revenues and profits went down.

Wait, but if the cost were $200, then:

Original profit: (350-200)*1000=150,000.

After: (320-200)*1080=120 *1080= 129,600.

Profit decrease: 150,000-129,600=20,400. So decreases again.

Hmm, so in all cases, the firm's profits went down. Therefore, the decision to lower prices resulted in both revenues and profits decreasing. So the correct answer is option H: The decision decreased both revenues and profits.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial calculations. Because in the question, it says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the correct answer is H, whose last letter is H.

Looking again, the options are:

A: poor one

B: no effect

C: good one

D: increased profits

E: profits up, not revenues

F: revenues up, not profits

G: no effect on revenues, increased profits.

H: decreased both, so last letter is H.

I: no effect on profits, but increased revenues.

J: revenues up, not profits.

So the correct answer is H: The decision decreased both revenues and profits. So the answer is H.

The television manufacturing firm lowered the price from $350 to $320, leading to a 1.9% increase in sales from 1,000 to 1,080 units per month. While this increase in sales may offset the price drop, the firm's unit production costs remained unchanged. To determine whether the decision was a good one, we analyze the impact on revenues and profits.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Original Revenue**:  
   \( (350 - C) \times 1000 \)

2. **New Revenue**:  
   \( (320 - C) \times 1080 \)

3. **Profit Change**:  
   Profit is calculated as \( (Price - Cost) \times Quantity \).  
   The profit change is:  
   \( (320 - C) \times 1080 - (350 - C) \times 1000 \)  
   Simplifying:  
   \( 345,600 - 350,000 - 80C \)  
   \( = -4,400 - 80C \)  

   Since \( C \) is positive, the profit change is negative, indicating a decrease in profits.

4. **Revenue Change**:  
   \( (320 \times 1080) - (350 \times 1000) \)  
   \( = 345,600 - 350,000 \)  
   \( = -4,400 \)  

   Revenue also decreases by $4,400.

### Conclusion:
Both revenues and profits decrease. The firm's decision to lower prices resulted in a decrease in both revenues and profits. Therefore, the correct answer is:
