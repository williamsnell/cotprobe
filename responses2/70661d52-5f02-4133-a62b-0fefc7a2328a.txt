Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the potential difference across a resistor and how it relates to the current flowing through it. 

The problem states that the potential difference V1 is 120 volts with a current I1 of 8.00 amps. Then it asks what current I2 will be maintained if the potential difference is increased to 180 volts. The options are A through J, with various amp values.

Hmm, I remember that Ohm's Law comes into play here. Ohm's Law says that voltage (V) equals current (I) multiplied by resistance (R), so V = I * R. But wait, this applies when the resistance isn't changing, right? So if the resistor's resistance doesn't change, then changing the voltage should change the current proportionally.

So initially, V1 = 120 V and I1 = 8 A. I can find the resistance R using R = V/I. Let me calculate that. R = 120 V / 8.00 A = 15 Ohms. Oh, that makes sense because 8 times 15 is 120.

Now, if the voltage is increased to 180 V, what's the new current? Using the same formula, I2 = V2 / R. So substituting the numbers: I2 = 180 V / 15 Ohms. Let me compute that. 180 divided by 15 is... 12. So I2 is 12 Amps.

Looking at the options, option C is 12.0 amp. So the answer should be C.

Wait a minute, wait. Could there be any other factors here? Like if the resistor was part of a circuit where other components are involved? Oh, but the question doesn't mention anything else. It just talks about the resistor, so I think the assumption is correct. The resistance is constant, so the current should just be V over R.

To solve the problem, we apply Ohm's Law, which states that \( V = I \cdot R \). Initially, the potential difference \( V_1 = 120 \, \text{V} \) with a current \( I_1 = 8.00 \, \text{A} \). Using these values, we calculate the resistance \( R \) as:

\[
R = \frac{V_1}{I_1} = \frac{120}{8.00} = 15 \, \Omega
\]

With the resistance constant, the new current \( I_2 \) when the potential difference is increased to \( V_2 = 180 \, \text{V} \) is:

\[
I_2 = \frac{V_2}{R} = \frac{180}{15} = 12.0 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, the current maintained in the resistor is \( 12.0 \, \text{A} \), corresponding to option C.
