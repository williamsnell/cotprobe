Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the maximum initial velocity a marble can have and still land back in the fishbowl. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's a fishbowl of height 4r/3. The sphere has radius r=6, so let's compute the height first. Oh wait, 4r/3 is the height of the fishbowl. Since r is 6, that's 4*6/3 = 8. So the fishbowl is 8 units tall. And it's made by removing the top third of a sphere. Hmm, so normally, a sphere of radius 6 has a diameter of 12. But this fishbowl is 8, which is less than 12, meaning it's a hemisphere or something else? Wait, no. Wait, a sphere's height from top to bottom is its diameter. So if the fishbowl's height is 8, that's less than the sphere's diameter (which would be 12). So this fishbowl is a spherical cap. Because when you remove the top third of a sphere, the remaining part's height is (2/3)r? Or wait, the original sphere's diameter is 12. If we remove the top third, which is 4 units (since 12/3=4), then the height of the fishbowl is 8. Because 12 - 4 = 8. So that makes sense.

The fishbowl is fixed in sand. The rim is parallel to the ground. So the rim is like the opening. The marble is at the bottom of the fishbowl. All surfaces are frictionless, so no energy loss. We need to find the maximum initial velocity so that the marble lands back into the fishbowl. 

Hmm. So when the marble is given a velocity, it will roll up the side of the bowl. But because it's a frictionless surface, the marble will keep moving until it reaches the highest point on the bowl. But wait, since the bowl is fixed, the marble would go up to the top and then start rolling back down. But the problem is, once it rolls back down, it should come back down to the same height, but since it's a bowl, it might not reach the same height as the original sphere. Wait, the original sphere's radius is 6, but the bowl's height is 8. So the marble is at the bottom, which is 8 units below the top. 

Wait, the center of the sphere is at the top of the bowl. Because the bowl's height is 8, and the sphere has radius 6, so the center is at 6 units from the bottom. So when the marble is given a velocity, it starts moving up the bowl. The maximum height it can reach is when it's at the top of the bowl, which is 8 units above the ground, but the center is at 6. So the marble goes up 2 units above the center. So the maximum height the marble can reach is 6 + 2 = 8 units above the ground? Wait, but the bowl's height is 8, so the top is 8 units above the ground. So the marble starts at the bottom, which is 8 units below the top. So the marble's initial potential energy plus kinetic energy must equal the potential energy at the top of the bowl.

Wait, but the marble is rolling up the bowl. So the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. 

Wait, but the bowl is a surface, and since the surfaces are frictionless, the marble will roll without slipping. However, in this case, the surfaces are frictionless, so the marble will just translate without rotating, or rotate as it goes. But since it's a spherical bowl, the marble will roll along the inner surface. Wait, but if it's a spherical bowl, the marble will roll around the inside, but the surface is frictionless. So the marble's motion is purely translational? Or does it spin?

Wait, no, because the marble is in contact with the bowl, which is a smooth (frictionless) surface. So when the marble rolls around, the only force is gravity. So the marble's velocity will determine its path. But since the surface is a sphere's inner surface, the marble's path is a circle, but it can only go so far before losing contact? Wait, no. The bowl is a surface that the marble can roll on. Since it's a spherical bowl, the marble can only go up to the point where it's no longer in contact with the bowl. But if the marble starts at the bottom, it's on the bottom point of the bowl. As it rolls up, it will reach the top, and then it's no longer in contact with the bowl. That makes sense.

So, for the marble to roll up to the top of the bowl, the initial potential energy plus kinetic energy must equal the potential energy at the top of the bowl. Since the bowl is a sphere, but here we're only considering the height. Wait, the marble's position in the bowl is along the vertical axis. So the height from the ground is 0, and the maximum height is 8 (because the bowl's height is 8; wait no, the bowl's height is 8, so the top is at 8 units. So the marble starts at the bottom, which is 8 units below the top, so 8 units above the ground? Wait, no, the height of the bowl is 8, so what's the position of the marble's starting point relative to the bowl's rim.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the bowl as a spherical cap. The sphere has radius r=6. The fishbowl is a portion of this sphere. The height of the fishbowl is 4r/3 = 8. So the fishbowl is a spherical cap whose height is 8. Because the sphere's radius is 6, the cap height is 8, which is more than the sphere's radius. Wait, no, that can't be because the sphere's radius is 6, so the maximum possible cap height is 12 (diameter). So 8 is possible. Wait, no, the sphere's radius is 6, so the cap's height is 8, which is less than 12, so yes, it's possible. So the fishbowl is a hemisphere? Or a spherical cap.

Wait, a spherical cap's height h is related to the sphere's radius R. The formula for the height of a spherical cap is h = R - √(R² - a²), where a is the radius of the base of the cap. But in this case, the cap's height is 8. So 8 = 6 - √(6² - a²). Wait no, I think I made a mistake. The height of a spherical cap is h = R - (R - a)²? Wait, no, the formula for a spherical cap's height is h = R - something. Let me think again.

The spherical cap's height h is given by h = R - d, where d is the distance from the base of the cap to the top. Alternatively, for the cap, the formula is h = R - (R - a), no, perhaps I should use the formula for the radius of the base of the cap. Let me recall: for a spherical cap of height h and radius a, the relationship is a² = 2 R h - h². So a² = 2 *6* h - h². Rearranged, a² = 12 h - h².

We know the height h of the cap is 8 (the fishbowl's height). So substituting h=8:

a² = 12*8 - 8² = 96 -64 = 32. So a=√32 = 4√2 ≈ 5.6568.

So the base of the fishbowl is a circle with radius a=4√2. But wait, the sphere has radius 6, so the base of the cap is a circle of radius a=4√2. So the fishbowl's rim is a circle with radius 4√2. But the marble starts at the bottom of this bowl.

Wait, the marble is placed at the bottom of the fishbowl, which is a spherical cap. But what's the location of the center of the sphere? The sphere has radius 6, so the center is at a distance of 6 from the bottom. Wait, the bowl is a spherical cap of height 8. The sphere's center is at a distance of 6 from the bottom of the sphere. So the center of the sphere is 6 units above the bottom of the sphere, but the bowl's height is 8, so the bowl's top is 8 units below the bottom. So the center is 6 units from the bottom, and the top is 8 units above the bottom; so the center is 6 - (height of bowl? Wait, no: the sphere's bottom is at 0, top is 12 (if radius is 6). But the bowl's height is 8, so the bowl's top is at 8, meaning the center is at 8/2 =4 units from the top? Wait, no. Let me think: the center of the sphere is at 6 units from the bottom of the sphere. The bowl's height is 8, so the top of the bowl is 8 units above the bottom. So the distance from the sphere's center (6 units from bottom) to the top of the bowl is 6 units (to the bottom of the sphere) + 8 (bowl's height) = 14? That can't be right, because the sphere's diameter is 12. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the setup wrong.

Wait, perhaps the bowl is a part of a sphere. Let me think again. The sphere has radius 6, so its diameter is 12. The fishbowl is a portion of this sphere, with height 8. So the fishbowl is the part from the bottom of the sphere up to a point 8 units above the bottom. Wait, no, the height of the bowl is 8, which would be from the bottom to the top of the bowl. So the sphere's bottom is at 0, and the top of the bowl is at 8. So the center of the sphere is at 6 units from the bottom. So the bowl's top is at 8, which is 2 units above the center. So the bowl's rim is at 8, which is 2 units above the center. So the marble is placed at the bottom of the bowl, so at position (0, 0, 0) if we model it in coordinates.

Wait, perhaps modeling the bowl in a coordinate system would help. Let me imagine the bowl as a spherical cap with radius 6, height 8. The fishbowl is the part of the sphere from θ=0 to θ=θ0, where θ0 is the angle corresponding to the height h=8. The center of the sphere is at (0,0,6), because the sphere's radius is 6, and it's sitting on the ground (assuming the ground is the plane z=0). Wait, no, because if the sphere's center is at (0,0,6), then the bottom of the sphere is at z=0, and the top at z=12. But the bowl's height is 8, so from z=0 to z=8. So the bowl is the part of the sphere from z=0 to z=8. But that's a cap of the sphere. So the bowl's rim is at (0,0,8), and the center is at (0,0,6).

So the marble is placed at the bottom of the bowl, which is at z=0, and the center is at (0,0,6). So the marble's initial position is at (0,0,0). Now, when the marble is given an initial velocity, it will roll up along the bowl's inner surface until it reaches the top, which is at z=8. So the marble's motion is constrained to the bowl's surface, which is a sphere of radius 6.

Since the surfaces are frictionless, the marble will roll without slipping. But wait, since it's a smooth (frictionless) surface, the marble will just translate without rotating? Or will it rotate as it goes? Hmm, this is crucial. Because if the marble is rolling without slipping, it must have both translational and rotational kinetic energy. But in this problem, since the surfaces are smooth, the only forces are gravity and normal force, so the marble will just move along the surface, but its motion would be determined by energy conservation.

But wait, since the bowl is a smooth (frictionless) surface, the only forces are the normal force and gravity. For a marble being rolled without slipping on a smooth surface, the only acceleration is due to gravity. So the motion is purely translational. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the bowl is a curved surface. Wait, actually, no, because the surface is curved; so the marble's motion is along the bowl's surface, which is a sphere. So, it's moving in a circular path. Since there's no friction, the only acceleration is due to gravity; but for a sphere, the normal force changes as the marble rolls. So, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached by energy conservation. The marble starts at the bottom with some kinetic energy and potential energy. As it rolls up, its potential energy increases, and the kinetic energy is converted into potential. But since the bowl is a smooth, frictionless surface, the only force doing work is gravity. So the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should remain constant.

At the bottom of the bowl (initial point), the marble's kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Potential energy is mgh, where h is the height of the marble's position. Wait, but the bowl is sitting on the ground, so the height is zero at the bottom. So the initial potential energy is zero, and the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². When the marble reaches the top of the bowl, its potential energy is mgh, where h is the height of the bowl's top. But wait, the bowl's height is 8, so the top is 8 units above the bottom. So h = 8. So potential energy at top is mg*(8). So at the top, the marble will have kinetic energy (1/2 mv²'), which must equal mg*(8 - 0) = mg*8. 

Wait, but wait. The initial potential energy is zero at the bottom, and the top is at 8 units. So the total energy at the bottom is (1/2 mv²). At the top, the marble's potential energy is mg*(8), and the kinetic energy is all translational, since it's a sphere. So:

(1/2 mv²) = mg*8

Solving for v, the initial velocity at the bottom would be sqrt(2g*8) = sqrt(16g). So g is 9.8, so sqrt(16*9.8) = sqrt(156.8) ≈12.52 units. But wait, that's the velocity at the bottom—so the marble's speed at the bottom is 12.52 m/s.

But wait, that's only part of the problem. The question is about the maximum initial velocity that allows the marble to land back in the fishbowl. So the marble, after reaching the top, is no longer in contact with the bowl. So the marble will slide back down along the bowl's surface.

Wait, but the bowl's height is 8, so the top is at 8. So the marble will, when given enough velocity, reach the top and then start moving back down. But in this case, the problem says the marble must land back in the fishbowl. So it needs to roll back down enough to reach the bottom again.

So the marble's motion is a combination of rolling up and rolling back down. So the maximum initial velocity is such that when the marble is given that velocity, it can reach the top and then roll back down to the bottom, but only if it has enough energy to return. But wait, the question says to find the maximum initial velocity so that it lands back in the fishbowl. So that's only possible if the marble can reach the top and roll back down. But if the initial velocity is too high, the marble might not have enough velocity to reach the top. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the initial velocity is given to the marble. When this velocity is large enough, the marble can go up to the top of the bowl and come back down. So the maximum initial velocity would be when the marble just reaches the top and comes back down to the bottom without any additional energy. Because any velocity beyond that would give it more energy, allowing it to go beyond the top and not return to the bottom.

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum initial velocity would be the one that allows the marble to just reach the top of the bowl and then come back down. So if the initial velocity is such that the marble can reach the top, the maximum is when it just reaches the top with zero velocity at the top. Because any more speed and it would have enough energy to go beyond the top.

So the initial velocity required to reach the top with zero velocity at the top is the critical velocity. So let's model this.

At the top of the bowl, the marble's velocity is zero. The initial velocity is v0, and the marble moves to the top. So the total mechanical energy at the bottom equals the total at the top. The potential energy at the top is mgh, where h is 8. So:

(1/2) m v0² = m g h

Simplify, v0² = 2g h. So v0 = sqrt(2 g h). Since h is 8, v0 = sqrt(16 g) = 4 sqrt(g). So with g=9.8, that's sqrt(16 *9.8) = sqrt(156.8) ≈12.52 m/s.

But wait, in this problem, the marble is given this velocity, and then rolls back down. So after it reaches the top, it starts moving back down, but only as far as possible. So the maximum initial velocity is when the marble just makes it all the way to the top (so that it comes back down to the bottom), but if the initial velocity is higher, it would go beyond the top and not return.

So the maximum initial velocity is when the marble reaches the top without any kinetic energy. So that's the critical velocity. Thus, the maximum initial velocity is 4√10 (since sqrt(16 *9.8) =4√(9.8) =4√(49/5)=4*(7)/√5=28/√5= (28√5)/5= ~12.52 m/s). But wait, 4√(9.8) is the same as 4√(98/10) =4√(49/5) =4*(7)/√5=28/√5= (28√5)/5 = approximately 12.52. So the maximum initial velocity is 28√5 /5 m/s.

Wait, but the problem says to find the maximum initial velocity such that the marble lands back in the fishbowl. So that is exactly the velocity that allows the marble to reach the top and come back down. So that's the critical velocity. So the maximum initial velocity is when the marble just makes it to the top and comes back down. So that's our answer.

Wait, but the initial velocity is given to the marble. So the maximum initial velocity is the one where the marble just reaches the top (and comes back down), which is the critical velocity. So the maximum initial velocity is 4√(9.8), but let's compute it numerically.

Wait, but perhaps the initial velocity is to give the marble enough energy to go up to the top, and then come back down. But wait, the fishbowl is a fixed structure. So the marble can't go beyond the top because there's no place for it. So the maximum initial velocity is indeed the one that allows the marble to reach the top and come back down to the bottom. So that's the critical velocity, which is v0 = sqrt(2 g h) = sqrt(2 *9.8 *8) = sqrt(156.8) ≈12.52 m/s.

Wait, but the problem says to find the maximum initial velocity that allows the marble to land back in the fishbowl. So perhaps the maximum velocity is such that the marble can reach the top and return, but no higher.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The fishbowl is a part of a sphere, with height 8. The marble is given an initial velocity, and when it's given that velocity, it will roll up to the top of the bowl and then slide back down. So to land back in the fishbowl, the marble must reach the top and then return. But if the initial velocity is too low, the marble won't reach the top. If the initial velocity is too high, the marble will go beyond the top and not return. So the maximum initial velocity is the one that allows the marble to reach the top and come back down.

Wait, but no, because if the marble is given a velocity that's just enough to reach the top, and then starts to slide back down, then that's the maximum initial velocity. So the maximum initial velocity is the one that allows the marble to reach the top and then slide back down. So it's the same as the critical velocity.

Wait, so the maximum initial velocity is when the marble just reaches the top with zero velocity. So that velocity is given to the marble at the bottom. So the initial velocity is the critical velocity. So the maximum initial velocity is 4√(9.8) ≈12.52 m/s.

But the problem says to find the maximum initial velocity such that the marble lands back in the fishbowl. So perhaps the answer is the speed that allows the marble to just reach the top, which is 4√(9.8), which is approximately 12.52 m/s.

Wait, but the problem is in the context of a physics problem, so perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the potential energy. The bowl's height is 8, so the top is 8 units above the bottom. So the marble's potential energy at the bottom is zero, and at the top, it's mgh, where h is 8. So that's correct.

So the maximum initial velocity is sqrt(2 g h) = sqrt(2 *9.8 *8) = sqrt(156.8) ≈12.52 m/s.

Wait, but the problem's options don't seem to match this. Let me calculate sqrt(156.8) more accurately.

156.8 divided by 2 is 78.4. So sqrt(156.8) is approximately 12.52 because 12.52 squared is (12 +0.52)^2 = 144 + 2*12*0.52 +0.52² =144 +12.48 +0.2704=156.7504, which is very close to 156.8. So the square root is approximately 12.52 m/s.

But the problem asks for the maximum initial velocity, so perhaps this is the answer. But the problem gives a sphere of radius 6, and a bowl of height 8. Hmm.

Wait, but in the spherical cap, the height h is 8, the radius of the sphere is 6, so using the formula a² = 2 R h - h², a² = 2*6*8 -8²=96-64=32, so a=√32=4√2. So the base of the cap is a circle of radius 4√2. But the sphere's center is at 6 units from the bottom. So the base of the cap is a circle at a height of 6 - (R - a) =? Not sure. Maybe not relevant.

So, in any case, the maximum initial velocity is the one that allows the marble to reach the top of the bowl and then return to the bottom. So the answer is sqrt(2 g h) = sqrt(156.8)≈12.52 m/s.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about this again. The initial velocity is given to the marble. When it's given this velocity, it rolls up the bowl's inner surface. So the marble's initial kinetic energy is all translational. At the top, the potential energy is mgh, and the kinetic energy is zero. So the initial velocity is sqrt(2g h) as before.

Wait, but that's when the marble is given enough velocity to reach the top. But if the initial velocity is less than that, the marble would not reach the top. So the maximum initial velocity is the one that allows the marble to reach the top and then come back down. So that's the critical velocity. So the maximum initial velocity is sqrt(2 g h) = sqrt(156.8)≈12.52 m/s.

So the answer would be approximately 12.52 m/s, but perhaps the exact form is needed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the maximum initial velocity such that when the marble is given that velocity, it reaches the top and comes back down to the bottom. So that's the critical velocity.

So the maximum initial velocity is sqrt(2 *9.8 *8) = sqrt(156.8) ≈12.52 m/s.

But let me calculate it more accurately. 12.52^2 = (12 +0.52)^2 =12² + 2*12*0.52 +0.52²=144 + 12.48 +0.2704=156.7504.

Which is very close to 156.8, so 12.52 is correct to about two decimal places.

So the maximum initial velocity is approximately 12.52 m/s.

Wait, but the problem gives the sphere radius as 6, so perhaps the initial velocity is actually higher. Wait, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy as well. Because when the marble rolls up, it's also spinning. So the kinetic energy is a combination of translational and rotational.

Wait, but the problem says all surfaces are frictionless, so the marble can't rotate. Because the only forces are gravity and normal, but no friction. So the marble would just translate without rotating. But in that case, the marble's kinetic energy is all translational. So the initial velocity is sqrt(2g h). So the maximum initial velocity is sqrt(2g h) = sqrt(2 *9.8 *8) = sqrt(156.8)≈12.52 m/s.

So the answer would be approximately 12.52 m/s. But perhaps the problem expects the exact value, which is sqrt(156.8), but maybe it's better to write it in terms of the sphere radius. Wait, but in this case, the sphere's radius is 6, which is unrelated to the height of the bowl.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the energy conservation and the marble's rotational energy. But since it's a frictionless surface, the marble would not rotate. So it would just translate. So the initial velocity is sqrt(2g h).

So the maximum initial velocity is sqrt(2 *9.8 *8)=sqrt(156.8)=approx12.52 m/s.

Wait, but let's check the calculation again. 9.8 *8 =78.4, multiplied by 2 is 156.8. Square root of 156.8 is about 12.52.

So the answer is approximately 12.52 m/s, but perhaps the correct calculation is with the sphere's radius. Wait, but in this case, the sphere's radius is 6, which doesn't directly affect the height of the bowl here.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the potential energy. The bowl's height is 8, so the top is 8 units above the bottom. So the potential energy at the top is mgh, where h is 8. That's correct.

So the maximum initial velocity is sqrt(2g h) = sqrt(2 *9.8 *8)=sqrt(156.8)=approx12.52 m/s.

So the answer is approximately 12.52 m/s. But looking back, perhaps I should write it as sqrt(156.8) or a simplified form.

Wait, 156.8 can be written as 1568/10 = 784*2/10=784/5. Because 784 *2 is 1568, so 1568/10 is 784/5. So sqrt(156.8) = sqrt(784/5) = 28/sqrt(5)= (28√5)/5.

Because 28^2=784, and sqrt(5) is in the denominator.

So the maximum initial velocity is (28√5)/5 m/s, which is approximately 12.52 m/s.

So the exact answer is (28√5)/5, which can be simplified further.

Alternatively, if we calculate it as a decimal, it's approximately 12.52 m/s.

So the maximum initial velocity that allows the marble to land back in the fishbowl is (28√5)/5 m/s, approximately 12.52 m/s.

Wait, but the question is in the context of a physics problem, so perhaps the exact form is better. So the answer is (28√5)/5 m/s.

Therefore, the maximum initial velocity is (28√5)/5 m/s.
</think>

The maximum initial velocity that allows the marble to land back in the fishbowl is determined by energy conservation. The marble starts at the bottom of the fishbowl with potential energy and kinetic energy. As it rolls up, its potential energy increases, converting into kinetic energy. At the top, the potential energy is maximized, and the marble comes to rest. To return to the bottom, the marble must have enough energy to roll back down without additional forces. Thus, the maximum initial velocity is the critical velocity that allows the marble to reach the top and then return.

Using energy conservation, the critical velocity is calculated as:

\[
v_0 = \sqrt{2 g h}
\]

where \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) and \(h = 8 \, \text{m}\). Substituting the values:

\[
v_0 = \sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \times 8} = \sqrt{156.8} \approx 12.52 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the maximum initial velocity is:

**ANSWER: (28√5)/5 m/s**
