Question:

Congress has recently enacted a statute requiring all males between the ages of 18 and 30 to take a physical examination each year.

Fearful that the information about his herpes condition will become available, he seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid the government from requiring him to take a physical examination. Which of the following is the best constitutional basis in support of the federal law?

Options:

A: The full faith and credit clause.
B: The dormant commerce clause.
C: The necessary and proper clause.
D: The equal protection clause.
E: The commerce clause.
F: The supremacy clause.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically about government statutes and their application. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a statute that requires all males 18-30 to take a physical exam each year. The purpose is to keep information about them for military draft purposes. A 25-year-old law school graduate has herpes and fears that his herpes info will become public, so he's seeking a declaratory judgment to prevent the government from requiring him to take the exam.

The options given are various constitutional bases. I need to figure out which one applies best here.

First, I should recall the different constitutional provisions related to this scenario. I'm a bit fuzzy on some, so let me think.

Option A: Full Faith and Credit Clause. This clause allows the government to transfer powers from the state to the federal government when certain conditions are met. For example, if the state enacts a law, the federal government can transfer its authority. But in this case, the statute is directly enacted by the federal government, not a state. So I'm not sure if the full faith clause applies here. Maybe not the best fit.

Option B: dormant Commerce Clause. The commerce clause allows the government to use government functions for state purposes, as long as it doesn't interfere with national security. The commerce clause is about equitable use of government powers. But wait, the scenario here is about a specific statute requiring an exam. It's about a particular instance, not an ongoing unlimited use. Plus, the question is about a specific person's rights, not about whether the government can use its power of the purse in a way that could interfere with national security.

Option C: Necessary and Proper Clause. This clause protects the government's powers from being used for purposes that are unreasonable or improper. So, if the government is using its power to keep a person's health information for military draft purposes, which is obviously against national security, then the Necessary and Proper Clause might apply. But here, the statute is about a specific age group, so maybe it's more about whether the information is necessary for the purposes of the law. I'm not certain if it's the best fit here.

Option D: Equal Protection Clause. This clause ensures that the government is not using its powers to discriminate against any class of citizens. It's about ensuring that each person is treated equally without unjust treatment. The case at hand is about someone's personal health condition being used for a military draft. So this might not be the right basis because it's about health, not discrimination.

Option E: Commerce Clause. The commerce clause is about the government's use of its powers for state purposes. But this statute is about a specific age group, so it's more about the legality of the law itself, not whether the government is using its powers for specific purposes. The scenario seems to revolve around the constitutionality of the statute, not whether the government can use its power for another purpose.

Option F: Supremacy Clause. This is about power given to the government by the Constitution over the state. It doesn't directly address the constitutionality of a law or a specific instance. So probably not the right choice.

Option G: Raising and Supporting an Army and Navy. That's more of a political or military justification. It's not a constitutional issue. The question is about constitutional basis, so I think this is a distractor.

Option H: Privileges and Immunities Clause. This clause protects individuals from being deprived of certain privileges or immunities for lawful activities. It's about whether someone can exercise certain rights without interference. But again, this seems more about individual rights than the authority of a law.

Option I: To provide for the General Welfare. That's more about public welfare, which is a separate issue from the constitution's scope.

Option J: Due Process Clause. This is about the right of a person to be notified and given a chance to object, especially to decisions that affect their life. This applies to legal procedures, including medical exams. The statute requires a physical exam, which is a legal procedure, and the person is seeking a declaration that the government isn't required to do it. Due process would allow the denial of the requirement, ensuring that the examinee is given the right to opt out.

Putting it all together: The scenario is about a specific person's right to not be required to take an exam. The federal government enacts a statute to require it, but the individual's rights to privacy and the exercise of medical services are protected by the right to due process. The due process clause (option J) prohibits the government from depriving the individual of their right to exercise medical examination or related activities without a valid reason.

The other options don't directly address the legal right here. The necessary and proper clause (C) is about whether the government is using its powers reasonably, but it's more about the legality of the law's purpose, not the right to exercise medical examination. The commerce clause (E) is about using government powers for state purposes, which isn't the issue here.

So the best answer should be the Due Process Clause, option J.

The best constitutional basis for the federal law in this scenario is the **Due Process Clause**. 

**Answer: J: The due process clause.**

The statute requires all males between the ages of 18 and 30 to take a physical examination, which is a legal procedure. The individual seeking a declaratory judgment is seeking to ensure that they are not required to take this exam, which falls under the right to due process. The Due Process Clause protects individuals from being deprived of their right to exercise medical examination or related activities without a valid reason. This applies directly to the scenario, addressing the individual's right to privacy and the exercise of medical services. Other options, such as the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, do not directly address the constitutional basis for the law's requirements or the individual's rights.
