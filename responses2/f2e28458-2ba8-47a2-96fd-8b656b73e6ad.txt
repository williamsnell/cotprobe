Source 1
If then by the Use of Machines, the Manufacture of Cotton, an Article which we import, and are supplied with from other Countries, and which can everywhere be procured on equal Terms, has met with such amazing Success, may not greater Advantages be reasonably expected from cultivating to the utmost the Manufacture of Wool, the Produce of our own Island, an Article in Demand in all Countries, almost the universal Clothing of Mankind?
In the Manufacture of Woollens, the Scribbling Mill, the Spinning Frame, and the Fly Shuttle, have reduced manual Labour nearly One third, and each of them at its-first Introduction carried an Alarm to the Work People, yet each has contributed to advance the Wages and to increase the Trade, so that if an Attempt was now made to deprive us of the Use of them, there is no Doubt, but every Person engaged in the Business, would exert himself to defend them.
—Statement by the Cloth Merchants of Leeds, 1791
Source 2
Come, cropper lads of high renown,
Who love to drink good ale that's brown,
And strike each haughty tyrant down,
With hatchet, pike, and gun!
Oh, the cropper lads for me,
The gallant lads for me,
Who with lusty stroke,
The shear frames broke,
The cropper lads for me!
What though the specials still advance,
And soldiers nightly round us prance;
The cropper lads still lead the dance,
With hatchet, pike, and gun!
Oh, the cropper lads for me,
The gallant lads for me,
Who with lusty stroke
The shear frames broke,
The cropper lads for me!
—Luddite Song, The Cropper's Song, c. 1812

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which economic theory Source 1 is referencing. Let me read through the question again. 

The question asks about the economic theory that Source 1 is supporting. Source 1 is about the textile industry, specifically the textile mills and machines used to produce cotton and wool. The excerpt mentions that these machines have reduced manual labor by a third and have contributed to increased wages and trade. It also talks about the importance of using machines to avoid losing jobs and to keep up with demand, implying that there's a desire for greater advantages in the industry.

I remember from my studies that Source 2 is a song about the Luddite movement, which was a push for better conditions for lower classes, but I'm not sure how that ties into economics here. 

Looking at the options, each option is an economic theory. Let's go through them:

A. Laissez-faire capitalism: That's about allowing free market without government intervention. I don't think Source 1 is talking about free market principles.

B. Protectionism: That's about imposing restrictions on imports, like tariffs or quotas. The Source 1 passage doesn't mention protectionism; it's more about the cotton industry.

C. Bullionism: That refers to the use of bullion (gold) as a form of money, which was a common economic system in the past, especially in the British Empire. The passage doesn't mention bullion at all.

D. Socialism: That's a broad term, but it's more about a planned economy based on class struggle, not necessarily about technological advancements.

E. Monetarism: This theory focuses on money supply and monetary policy, which seems unrelated to industrialization or machinery.

F. Marxism: This is a Marxist theory, which emphasizes class struggle, historical materialism, and the production of surplus value. The passage doesn't mention Marxism, but it's a theory that focuses on class interests.

G. Industrialization: This was a policy movement aimed at industrializing and modernizing societies. The passage discusses technological advancements, which aligns with industrialization theory, where machines and machinery drive industrial progress.

H. Mercantilism: This was the economic system where governments imposed taxes and relied on trade for revenue. The passage talks about using machines to increase trade, which doesn't fit Mercantilism.

Wait, Source 1 is about the textile industry, and the passage discusses technological changes that have reduced manual work. That's more about the benefits of industrialization, which is G. Industrialization.

Another angle: The passage mentions that machines have contributed to increasing wages and trade. This is a positive aspect of industrialization where workers can be paid more and production is more efficient. So yes, that's a support for industrialization.

So the correct answer should be G: Industrialization.

The passage discusses the benefits of using machines in the textile industry, which reduces manual labor, increases wages, and improves trade. This aligns with the economic theory of industrialization, where technological advancements drive industrial progress and efficiency. 

Answer: G: Industrialization
