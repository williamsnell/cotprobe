Question:

Three years ago, Fred invested $10,000 in the shares of ABC Corp. Each year, the company distributed dividends to its shareholders. Each year, Fred received $100 in dividends. Note that since Fred received $100 in dividends each year, his total income is $300. Today, Fred sold his shares for $12,000. What is the holding period return of his investment?

Options:

A: 0.28
B: 0.15
C: 0.18
D: 0.40
E: 0.25
F: 0.30
G: 0.33
H: 0.10
I: 0.23
J: 0.20

Okay, so I have this question about calculating the holding period return for Fred's investment. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that HPR stands for holding period return, which is the total return on an investment over the period it was held. 

The question says that Fred invested $10,000 in ABC Corp three years ago. Each year, he received $100 in dividends, so over three years that's 3 times $100, totaling $300 in dividends. Today, he sold his shares for $12,000. 

Wait, so the total return Fred has is from two sources: the capital gain from selling the shares and the dividends received. The formula for HPR is (Ending Value + Dividends Received - Initial Investment) divided by Initial Investment. Oh wait, no, I think it's (Ending Value + Dividends) minus Initial Investment, all over Initial Investment. 

Let me get the numbers right. Initial investment is $10,000. Dividends received each year are $100, so over three years, that's $300. He sold for $12,000. So the total proceeds are $12,000. 

So putting it into the HPR formula: 

HPR = (12,000 + 300 - 10,000) / 10,000 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Or perhaps the formula is (Ending Value + Dividends) / Initial Investment. Let me think again. 

HPR is the total return over the period, so it's (Ending Value + Dividends) minus the initial investment, all divided by the initial investment. So: 

HPR = (12,000 + 300 - 10,000) / 10,000 

Calculating that: 12,000 + 300 is 12,300. Subtract 10,000 gives 2,300. So 2,300 divided by 10,000 is 0.23, which is 23%. 

Looking at the options, option I is 0.23 and option J is 0.20. So the correct answer should be option I, 23%. 

Wait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. 

So, the formula for HPR is:

HPR = (Selling Price + Dividends Received) / Initial Investment - 1 

Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as (Ending Value + Dividends) - Initial Investment all over initial investment. Either way, the same result. 

So 12,000 + 300 = 12,300. 12,300 -10,000=2,300. 2,300 /10,000 = 0.23. Yep, that's 23%. So the correct answer is option I, 0.23.

The holding period return (HPR) is calculated as (Ending Value + Dividends Received - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment. Plugging in the numbers: (12,000 + 300 - 10,000) / 10,000 = 2,300 / 10,000 = 0.23. 

Answer: I: 0.23
