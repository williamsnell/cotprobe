Okay, so I've got this question about expanded form, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking which expression correctly represents 270,240 in expanded form. The options are A to J, each with different combinations of numbers.

Let me start by remembering what expanded form means. From what I recall, expanded form breaks down a number into the sum of each digit multiplied by its place value. For example, the number 345 would be written as 300 + 40 + 5. So each digit is shown with its place value.

Looking at the number 270,240, I should break it down digit by digit. Let's see, the number is 270,240, which is seven digits long. Breaking it down:

- The first digit from the left is 2, which is in the hundred thousands place. So that's 200,000.
- Next is 7, which is in the ten thousands place. That's 70,000.
- Then comes 0, which is in the thousands place. So that's 0 multiplied by 1,000, which is 0. But I don't see any options with a zero here. So maybe that's not an option, but I'll keep it in mind.
- Then comes 2, which is in the hundreds place. That's 200.
- Next is 4, which is in the tens place. So that's 40.
- Finally, the last digit is 0, which is in the ones place. That's 0, but again, not an option.

Wait, but the options don't have an option with a zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me double-check.

Wait, the number is 270,240. So let's count each digit's place:

The places are:
- 2: hundred thousands (200,000)
- 7: ten thousands (70,000)
- 0: thousands (0)
- 2: hundreds (200)
- 4: tens (40)
- 0: ones (0)

So the expanded form would be 200,000 + 70,000 + 0 + 200 + 40 + 0. But since adding zero doesn't change the sum, it's basically 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40.

Now, looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option A: 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 400. Hmm, that has 2,000 and 400. Where did those come from? Oh wait, maybe they broke it down incorrectly. The original number doesn't have a 2 in the thousands place beyond the 0, so 2,000 isn't part of it. Instead, it's 200 (hundreds). So A is probably wrong.

Option B: 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40. That's what I thought. So that seems correct.

Option C: 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 400. Again, 400 is wrong because the tens place is 40.

Option D: 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,400. Wait, where does 2,400 come from? The thousands place is 0, so there's no 2,000 and 400. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 40. Oh, same as A except for the 2000. That's incorrect because the hundreds place is 200.

Option F: 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 4. Wait, why 7,000? Because 270,240â€” the first digit is 2, then 7 in ten thousands (70,000). So 7,000 is not right. Also, there's a 4 in the ones place, so 4 is correct.

Option G: 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 40. That's 200k + 7k + 200 +40. So 270k is 200k +70k, so 7k is correct. 200k is 200,000, so that's right. 40 is correct. So this option seems correct.

Option H: 200,000 +70,000 +20,000 +40. Wait, that's adding 20,000, which is an additional ten thousands. But the original number is 270,240, so it's 270,000 plus 240. Wait, no, 270,240 is 270,000 + 240. So 270,000 is 200,000 +70,000. So H is adding 20,000, which is incorrect because the original number doesn't have a 20,000. So H is wrong.

Option J: 200,000 +7,000 +20,000 +40. That's 200k +7k +20k +40. 200+7+20=240, so 270k plus 40 is 270,040. But the original number is 270,240. So J is incorrect because it's 270,040, not 270,240.

Wait, let me make sure. The original number is 270,240. So it's 200k +70k is 270k. Then 240 is 200 +40. So expanded form would be 200k +70k +200 +40. So that's 200,000 +70,000 +200 +40.

Looking back at the options, option G is 200,000 +7,000 +200 +40. That's not correct because 7,000 is 7000, not 70k. So that's wrong.

Option B is correct. So the correct answer should be option B.

The correct expanded form of 270,240 is 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40. 

Answer: B
