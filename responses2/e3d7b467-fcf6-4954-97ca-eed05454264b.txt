Okay, let's see. So Jess scored 18 points in her last basketball game. Each basket is worth 2 points. The question is asking how many baskets she made. Hmm, so I need to find out the number of baskets that sum up to 18 points, with each basket being 2 points.

Wait, right, each basket is 2 points. So the total points would be the number of baskets multiplied by 2. So if she made, say, 'n' baskets, then n * 2 = total points. 

In this case, the total points are 18. So I can set up the equation: n * 2 = 18. To find n, I just divide both sides by 2. So n = 18 / 2, which is 9. 

Looking at the options, option H is 9. So the answer should be H.

The total points Jess scored is 18, and each basket is worth 2 points. To find the number of baskets, divide the total points by the points per basket: 18 / 2 = 9. 

Answer: H
