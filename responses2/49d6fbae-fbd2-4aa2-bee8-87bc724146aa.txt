Okay, so I've got this problem here about Steven Fox and his income. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I need to figure out how much he makes from selling the vacuum cleaners. Each cleaner he sells gives him $32.50. He sold 14 of them, so I should multiply 14 by 32.50. Hmm, 14 times 32.50. Let me calculate that. 10 times 32.5 is 325, and 4 times 32.5 is 130, so adding them together gives 325 + 130 = 455. So, he earns $455 from the cleaners.

Now, onto the accessories and supplies. He made $237.40 worth of those. But he gets a 25% commission on that. I need to calculate 25% of 237.40. To find 25%, I can think of it as a quarter. So, 237.40 divided by 4. Let me do that: 237 divided by 4 is 59.25, and 0.40 divided by 4 is 0.10. So, adding those together, 59.25 + 0.10 = 59.35. So, his commission from accessories is $59.35.

Now, adding both earnings: $455 from the cleaners and $59.35 from the accessories. Let me add them up. 455 plus 59.35. 455 + 59 is 514, and then plus 0.35 makes it 514.35. So, his total income is $514.35.

Looking at the options, option A is $514.35. That should be the correct answer.

The total income from sales and commission is calculated as $455 (from 14 cleaners) plus $59.35 (25% commission on $237.40), totaling $514.35.
