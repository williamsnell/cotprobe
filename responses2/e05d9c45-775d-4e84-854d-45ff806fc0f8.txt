Okay, so I've got this question about genetics, specifically about the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. Hmm, I remember that the relatedness of people affects how much they share genes. Let me think this through.

First, the question is asking about first cousins. What's a first cousin? Well, cousins are related by a certain number of generations. Like, siblings are first cousins (1 generation apart), and first cousins are 2 generations apart. So, first cousins share an average of how many genes?

Wait, each person has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. Normally, if you're siblings, you share 23% of your DNA (since each parent contributes one, so that's 50%, but wait, wait no—no, each person has 23 pairs, so the chance that any one pair matches is 1/2, so 50% for each pair. So, for two siblings, the probability that any pair matches is 50%, so the chance all 23 pairs match is (1/2)^23. But wait, that's the probability, but when they ask for the proportion of genes shared, does that mean the actual number of genes shared or the probability?

Wait, the question says "the proportion of genes shared by first cousins is on average." So, I think it's the chance that one gene from each person matches. Or maybe it's the probability that a randomly selected gene from one person matches a randomly selected gene from another. So, for two first cousins, how many genes do they share?

Wait, let's think about their family tree. First cousins are two generations apart. Each generation has two parents. So, each person has two grandparents, two parents, four aunts uncles, and two great-grandparents.

Wait, the number of genes shared by two first cousins. Each person has 23 homologous chromosomes. Two first cousins share 23 × 2 = 46 chromosomes. But wait, no—because each parent contributes one chromosome, so for two siblings, each has one chromosome from each parent. For first cousins, each has two from each parent, so four in total, but wait that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Each person has two sets of 23 chromosomes. So, for two siblings, each has one from each parent, so 23% of the DNA (each parent contributes 1 of 23). So, siblings share 50% of their genome.

First cousins are two generations apart. So, each person has two parents. So, each person has two chromosomes from each parent. So, for each of the two parents, they contribute two chromosomes. So, each person has two from each parent, so four in total. So, if two first cousins each have four chromosomes (two from each parent), how many do they share?

Wait, but wait, siblings share one parent's two chromosomes (since each parent has two?), no. Wait, no: siblings share one parent's two chromosomes (each has one from each parent). First cousins have two from each parent.

So, each person has four chromosomes. So, the chance that any one chromosome matches is 1/2 (since each has a 50% chance to match). So, the probability that all four match would be (1/2)^4 = 1/16. But wait, that's the probability of all four being the same. But the question is about the proportion of genes shared, not the probability. Or maybe it's the probability that any one of their four chromosomes matches.

Wait, but per person, each has four chromosomes. So, the number of genes shared is 4. So, the proportion would be 4/ (2*23) because each person has 23 pairs. Wait, no—each person's chromosome pairs are 23 per set, so 23 pairs. So, their total number of chromosomes is 23 * 2 =46.

Wait, no, wait. Each person has 23 chromosomes in each set, so each person has 23 ×2 =46 chromosomes. So, if you have two first cousins, each with 46, then the number of shared chromosomes is 4 (two from each parent). So, the proportion would be 4/46, which simplifies to 2/23. But wait, that's a proportion, not a probability.

Alternatively, the question is about the probability that any particular chromosome matches. But the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. However, thinking about the formula for calculating the probability that two genes are the same. So, for each chromosome pair, the chance that they match is 50% (since there are two homologous chromosomes, each has a 50% chance to match). Wait, no, wait: each chromosome in a person has a homolog in the other person. So, for each chromosome, the chance it matches is 50%.

But for any two genes to match, all four must match. So, 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 *1/2 =1/16, but wait, that's only per chromosome. But the question is about any particular gene, or the average proportion shared.

Wait, the question is about the proportion of genes shared. So, the average number of matching genes divided by the total possible.

Alternatively, each person has 23 pairs. So, for two first cousins, the number of shared chromosomes is 4 (two from each parent). So, the proportion is 4 / (23 * 2) = 2/23 ≈ 0.087.

Wait, but that's a proportion, not a probability. So, the average proportion is about 4/(23*2) = 2/23.

But wait, the answer options don't have 2/23. Let me check the options. The options are 1/(4), 1/128, etc. So none of the options match 2/23.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of it the wrong way. Maybe the question is about how many genes are shared on average between two first cousins. But wait, the parents each have two, so four in total. So, each person has four chromosomes. So, the average number of matching genes is four, as siblings share two, cousins share four. So, the proportion of genes is 4 / (each person has 23 pairs ×2=46), so 4/46= 2/23 ≈ 0.087. So, the average proportion would be 2/23.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are like 2/23. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: 1.0/4 → 0.25

B: 1.0/128 → approx 0.0078

C: 1.0/2 → 0.5

D: 1.0/512 → approx 0.00195

E: 1.0/2048 → approx 0.000488

F: 1.0/16 → 0.0625

G: 1.0/8 → 0.125

H: 1.0/32 → 0.03125

I: 1.0/64 → 0.015625

J: 1.0/1024 → approx 0.000976

Wait, none of these options match 2/23 (~0.087). Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the proportion of genes shared between two first cousins, but considering that each person has two sets of 23, so four genes. So, the average number of shared genes is 4. The total possible shared genes is 23*2 =46. So, the average proportion would be 4/46 = 2/23 ≈ 0.087. But 2/23 is approximately 0.087 (since 23 * 0.087 is about 2).

Looking at the options, the closest one is option F: 1.0/16 → 0.0625. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the chance per gene. Wait, each gene has a 50% chance of being shared. So, the chance that any one gene is shared is 1/2. But for two genes (since each person has two from each parent, four in total), the chance that all four match is (1/2)^4 = 1/16. So, the chance is 1/16, which is 0.0625.

But wait, the question is about the proportion of genes shared, not the probability. So, perhaps the average number of shared genes is 4, so the average proportion is 4/46 = 0.087, which is about 2/23. But again, this is not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that each person has four genes. So, the average number of shared genes is four. The total possible shared genes is 46 (since 23 pairs, each person has two, so 46). So, 4/46 reduces to 2/23, so approximately 0.087.

But looking at the options again, there are no options that match 2/23. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question's setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that each person has 23 pairs, so 46 genes. So, the chance that a randomly selected gene from one person matches a randomly selected gene from another. The probability is (1/2)^4 =1/16, so 1/16 is 0.0625.

But the question is about the proportion of genes shared, not the probability. So, perhaps it's the average number of genes shared. So, each person has 46 genes. So, the average number shared between two first cousins is 4, as each has four, but wait, no: two first cousins each have four genes, so the shared genes would be four. So, the proportion is 4/46 =2/23≈0.087.

But again, this is not an option. So, maybe I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the first cousins share 0.5 genes on average. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the average number of genes shared per person. So, each person has four genes. So, the average number of shared genes is four, so the proportion is 4/46 = 2/23, which is approximately 0.087.

But looking at the options, the closest one is F: 1.0/16 → 0.0625, which is 0.0625, which is lower than 0.087. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that each person has two homologous chromosomes, so 46 genes. So, the number of shared genes is four, so 4/46 = 2/23 ≈0.087.

Wait, perhaps the options are considering the probability of any gene being shared as the chance per gene. So, for each gene, the chance is 1/2. Since there are four genes, the chance that any one is shared is 1/2, but no, that's not correct—since all four must match. So, the probability is (1/2)^4=1/16. So, the probability is 1/16 → which is 0.0625. But the question is about the average proportion, which would be 4/46= ~0.087.

Hmm, that doesn't match any option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait another angle: Another way to think about it is the number of homologous chromosomes they share. First cousins share two from each parent, so four in total. So, the number of shared genes is four. Each person has 23 pairs, so 46 genes. So, the proportion is 4/46 = 2/23 ≈0.087.

But the options don't have this value, so I must be missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps each person has two sets of 23 chromosomes, so 46. So, the average number of shared genes is four. So, the proportion is 4/ (23 × 2) = 4/46 = 2/23. So, I'm back to the same number.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Each person has 23 chromosomes. So, if they share two from each parent, that's four. So, the number of shared genes is four. So, the average proportion is 4/ (2 ×23) =4/46= 2/23.

But 2/23 is approximately 0.087. None of the options match this. Let's look at the options again:

Options:

A: 1.0/4 → 0.25

B: 1.0/128 → ~0.0078

C:1/2 →0.5

D:1/512 → ~0.00195

E:1/2048 →0.000488

F:1/16 →0.0625

G:1/8 →0.125

H:1/32 →0.03125

I:1/64 →0.015625

J:1/1024 →0.000976

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the per person average. So, for a first cousin, each person has 4 shared genes. So, the proportion of their genes that match is 4/(23×2) =4/46= 2/23. But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the chance that any given gene is shared. So, the chance that any gene from one person is the same as any gene from another. So, since each has 23 pairs, each person has 23 ×2 =46 genes. So, for any two genes, one from each, the chance they match is 1/2. So, the chance that a specific gene matches is 1/2.

But for two genes (since each person has two from each parent), the chance that both match is (1/2)^2=1/4. But that's the probability that both match. So, the expected number of matching genes is 1/4.

Wait, no, no. The number of genes shared is four. So, each can match or not. So, the average number of matching genes is four. The total possible shared genes is 46. So, the average proportion is 4/46=2/23. So, that's about 0.087.

But looking at the options, none of them match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that each person has two homologous chromosomes, so each has 23 pairs, 46 genes. The number of genes shared between two first cousins is four. So, the proportion is 4/46=2/23≈0.087.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, perhaps the question is about the chance that any one gene is shared, not the average number. So, the chance is 1/2. But that's just the chance for one gene, not the proportion.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that each person has 23 chromosomes, so four genes. So, 4/ (23 ×2) =2/23≈0.087.

But again, not matching any option.

Wait, let's think about another approach. The distance between two individuals, in terms of gene sharing. For first cousins, the degree of relationship is 1. So, the formula for the proportion of genes shared is 1/(2^(2*1)) )= 1/(2^2) =1/4. So, 25% of their genes are shared. But wait, that would be 1/4, which is option A (1.0/4).

Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. So, which is correct?

Hmm, I've heard that the formula for the proportion of genes shared between two individuals is 1/(2^(2d)), where d is the degree of relationship. But that might be for the number of generations between them. Let's think.

First cousins are 1 generation apart. So, d=1. So, 1/(2^(2*1))=1/4. So, 25% of genes are shared. So, the proportion is 1/4. So, the answer would be A.

But wait, I thought earlier that the number of shared genes is four, leading to 4/46= 2/23. So, which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let's double-check.

The formula for the probability that two individuals share a gene by coincidence is 1/(2^(2d)), where d is the number of generations apart. So, for first cousins, d=1, so 1/4.

But that's the probability that a randomly selected gene from one person matches a randomly selected gene from another. So, that's the probability. So, the chance is 1/4, which is 0.25. So, option A.

But wait, the question is about the proportion of genes shared, not the probability. So, perhaps the proportion is 1/4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the chance that two people share a particular gene. So, the chance is 1/4, which would be the proportion. So, the answer is A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the number of genes shared is four, leading to a proportion of 2/23. Which is approximately 0.087, which is not among the options.

So, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for the degree of relationship. Let me look it up again.

The formula for the degree of relationship 'r' is r = 2^(-d), where d is the number of generations apart. So, for first cousins (d=1), r=0.5. So, the chance that any gene matches is 0.5. But wait, that's the probability for any given gene.

But in this case, the question is about the proportion of genes shared, not the chance of a gene match.

So, perhaps the formula for the proportion of genes shared is 1/(2^(2d)). So, that's 1/4 when d=1.

So, the proportion of genes shared is 1/4, which is option A.

But earlier, I thought that the average number of shared genes is four, and the total possible is 46. So, the proportion is 4/46=2/23. But that's not 1/4.

Hmm, perhaps the formula I'm recalling is the chance of a gene match, not the proportion of genes shared.

In that case, the chance that any given gene matches is (1/2)^2=1/4, so the probability is 1/4. So, the chance is 25%, which would correspond to option A.

But the question is about the proportion of genes shared, not the chance of a gene match. So, perhaps I've mixed the terms.

Wait, the question is about the average proportion of genes shared. So, for two first cousins, the number of shared genes is four. The total possible genes is 46. So, the proportion is 4/46=2/23≈0.087.

Looking at the options, none of them match 2/23. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating it.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the average number of genes shared is 2. So, the proportion would be 2/46=1/23≈0.0435. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1/4 (option A), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for the number of genes shared. The formula is 2^(2d) -1. So, for d=1, it's 3. So, 3 genes shared, leading to 3/46≈0.0649. But again, not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's think about the formula for the average number of genes shared between two individuals. The formula is:

Average number of shared genes = (2^(2d) - 2)/(2^(2d) - 2)

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the average number of genes shared is (2^(2d) -1), but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the average number of genes shared is 2^(2d) -1. So, for d=1, it's 3. So, 3/46≈0.0649. But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 2^(2d) -1. So, for d=1, 3. So, 3 genes. So, the proportion is 3/46= approx 0.0649.

But again, the options don't have this number.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 1/4 (option A), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1/4, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for the degree of relationship. Let me look it up again.

The degree of relationship (d) is given by d = log2 (2^(2d)), but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 2^(2d) -1. So, for d=1, it's 3. So, 3 genes shared. So, the proportion is 3/46≈0.0649.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 1/4 (option A), as the formula for the average number of genes shared is (2^(2d) -1), so 3, and the proportion is 3/46. But 3/46 is approximately 0.0649, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as (1/2)^(2d). So, d=1, 1/4. So, the chance of a gene match is 1/4. So, the chance is 25%, which is 1/4.

But the question is about the proportion, not the chance. So, perhaps the correct answer is A:1/4.

But earlier I thought that the proportion was 2/23, which isn't an option. So, maybe I made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the proportion of genes shared between two individuals as 1/(2^(2d)).

So, for first cousins, d=1, so 1/(2^2)=1/4.

So, the answer is A:1.0/4.

But wait, earlier I thought that the average number of shared genes is four, leading to a proportion of 4/46=2/23. So, perhaps that's a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/(2^(2d)), which is 1/4 for first cousins.

So, the correct answer would be A:1.0/4.

So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it earlier.
</think>

The proportion of genes shared between two first cousins is calculated using the formula for the degree of relationship (d). For first cousins, d=1, so the proportion is 1/(2^(2d)) = 1/4. This corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A. 1.0/4**
