Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to convert 4:00 pm into military time. Hmm, I remember that military time is a bit different from the standard 12-hour clock. Let me think. Military time uses numbers from 00:00 to 23:59, right? 

Wait, so in the standard time format, pm means it's in the afternoon or evening. But in military time, the hours are numbered from 01 to 24. So, I think 12:00 pm would be 12:00, and 1:00 pm would be 13:00. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Some sources say that after 12, the numbers go from 1 to 23, using a colon to separate hours and minutes. Like 13:00 instead of 1:00 pm. 

So, 4:00 pm should be 16:00 in military time. Let me check the options. Option H is 16:00, which matches. Let's see the other options. A is 1600, which is the same as 16:00 but with two digits for the time. B is 1400, which would be 14:00, which is 2 p.m. So that's too early. C is 4000, which doesn't make sense because military time only goes up to 23:59. D is 4:00, which seems like it's not using the colon for hours and minutes. E is 400, which is probably 4:00 AM. F is 4:00 pm, but that's not military time format. G is 0400, which would be 4:00 AM. J is 2400, which is beyond 24 and isn't valid military time. 

So the correct answer should be H: 16:00. Let me make sure. 16:00 divided into 24 hours is 4 PM. Yes, that's correct.

The correct military time for 4:00 pm is **16:00**, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H: 16:00
