Question:

A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?

Options:

A: Fibroma
B: Mucinous cystadenoma
C: Clear cell carcinoma
D: Teratoma
E: Brenner tumor
F: Serous cystadenoma
G: Endometrioid tumor
H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor
I: Ovarian carcinoid
J: Granulosa tumor

Okay, I need to figure out which option correctly describes the described ovarian mass in the patient. Let's break down the information provided.

First, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a 6-month history of increased facial hair. That makes me think of endometrial inclusion disease, which often causes temporal hair loss. Increased facial hair also suggests that the endometrial tissue is present.

Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago, which is typical, so it doesn't rule out endometriosis. The blood work shows elevated serum testosterone, and the levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within normal ranges. These markers are usually seen in normal endometrial tissue, so that's consistent with normal tissue.

The Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement, which is a sign of endometrial inclusion, as the clitoris is part of the endometrium.

The ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Wait, that's a problem. Because the patient has endometriosis (endometrial tissue), the ovarian mass should be endometrioid, not a conventional ovarian tumor. So the option D, which is 'Teratoma' (ovarian tumor), doesn't fit here.

Looking at the options, option G is 'Endometrioid tumor.' That makes sense because endometriosis is the tissue, and the mass would be the tumor. So the correct answer should be G.

Other options: A is Fibroma, which is a benign tumor, but the patient's test results don't suggest that. B is Mucinous cystadenoma, which is usually seen in the mouth or other areas, not endometriosis. C is Clear cell carcinoma, which is a form of cancer, but again, the mass is endometrioid. E is Brenner's, which is a tumor of the ovary, but Brenner's is rare and usually not in the last 6 months. F is Serous cystadenoma, another type of endometrial lesion. I is a carcinoid, which is an endometrioid but not a solid tumor. J is a granulosa tumor, which is another type of endometrioid but not a common one. So the best fit is G.

The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate an endometrioid tumor. The 6-month history of increased facial hair, combined with high blood pressure and normal markers of androstenedione and urinary 17-ketosteroids, support the presence of endometriosis. The clitoral enlargement and 12-cm mass are consistent with an endometrioid tumor rather than a conventional ovarian tumor. 

ANSWER: G
