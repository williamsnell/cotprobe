Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem says there's a bag with 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. That makes a total of 10 marbles, right? The question is asking for the probability that both marbles drawn are the same color. Hmm, same color could mean either both red or both blue. I think I should calculate the probability for each scenario and then add them together.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. So, first, the first marble is drawn, not replaced, and then the second one. So, the probabilities will depend on the first draw. Oh right, because after taking out a marble, the total number of marbles left is one less, and the counts of each color change accordingly.

So, let's break it down. First, the probability that both marbles are red. There are 4 red marbles initially. So, the probability of picking red first is 4/10. After picking one red marble, there are now 3 red marbles left and a total of 9 marbles. So, the probability of picking red again is 3/9. To find the probability of both events happening, I multiply them: (4/10) * (3/9). Let me calculate that: 4 times 3 is 12, and 10 times 9 is 90. So, that's 12/90. Simplifying that, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 6, so 2/15. Wait, but maybe I should leave it as 12/90 for now and see if it combines with the other probability.

Next, the probability that both marbles are blue. There are 6 blue marbles initially. So, the first pick is blue with probability 6/10. After taking one blue, there are 5 left and 9 total. So, the second pick is blue again with probability 5/9. Multiplying those gives (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90, which simplifies to 1/3. But wait, 1/3 is 30/90, which is 1/3; but I can also write 30/90 as 1/3. But when adding to the red probability, maybe it's easier to keep both in 90 denominator terms.

Wait, so the red probability is 12/90 and blue is 30/90. Adding them together gives 42/90. Simplifying that, both are divisible by 6, so 7/15. So, that would be the probability of both marbles being the same color.

Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of possible outcomes and the favorable ones. Since the order matters here, I'm considering it as permutations. The total number of ways to draw two marbles without replacement is 10*9=90. The favorable cases are the ones where both are red or both are blue.

For both red: The number of ways is 4*3=12 (since you choose the first red, then another red from the remaining). For both blue: 6*5=30. So, 12+30=42. So, 42/90=7/15. Yep, same result. So, the correct answer should be 7/15, which is option I.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the probability that the second marble is the same color as the first. But that would be a different approach. Alternatively, think of it as after the first draw, what's the probability that the second is the same color.

Wait, but I think the first approach I took is correct. Let me make sure I did both red and blue correctly. For red: 4/10 * 3/9 = 12/90. For blue: 6/10 * 5/9 = 30/90. 12+30=42, which is 7/15. So, yes, I think that's the right answer. Looking at the options, option I is 7/15, so the correct answer is I.

The probability of both marbles being the same color is calculated by considering both red and blue scenarios. The total probability is the sum of these two cases. After computing both probabilities and adding them, the result is 7/15.

Answer: I: \frac{7}{15}
