Okay, so I've got this problem about a shunt motor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The problem states: The armature resistance is 0.18 ohms. The supply voltage is 230 volts. The armature current shouldn't exceed 76 amps. I need to find three things: (a) the series resistance at starting, (b) the resistance that can be reduced when accelerating until E_c is 168 volts, and (c) the armature current at starting with no series resistance.

Let me start with part (a). I remember that in a shunt motor, the voltage across the armature and the field (E armature) should be equal. The armature current is I_a = I_s + I_f. Oh wait, but when starting, the field current I_f is zero. So I_a = I_s.

The formula for the voltage drop across the armature is V = I_a * R_a. But wait, in shunt mode, the armature's resistance is in parallel with the field resistance. Oh right, the armature current I_a is I_s plus I_f, but in starting, I_f is zero, so I_a = I_s.

The supply voltage V is 230 V. Also, the armature resistance is 0.18 ohms. But wait, the armature's equivalent resistance is R_a + R_f, but under shunt conditions, R_f is small compared to R_a. Hmm, but for starting, R_f is negligible. So maybe I can model it as V = I_a * R_a.

Wait, but wait. When the motor is starting, the field current I_f must be zero because the armature current is maximum. So the total armature resistance is R_a + R_f. But for starting, R_f is zero, so R_armature = R_a = 0.18 ohms. So I_a = V / R_armature = 230 / 0.18. Let me compute that. 230 divided by 0.18 is approximately 1277.78 A. But the problem says the armature current should not exceed 76 A. Oh wait, wait—this is confusing.

Wait no, the question is about inserting a series resistance to limit the armature current. So when starting, the armature current is higher than 76 A. So we need to add a series resistance so that the total armature current doesn't exceed 76 A.

So, the armature voltage is 230 V, and the armature's resistance is 0.18 ohms plus the series resistance R. The armature current I_a is 76 A. So the total armature resistance is R + 0.18. Using Ohms law, 230 = I_a * (R + 0.18). So 230 = 76 * (R + 0.18). Let me solve for R.

R + 0.18 = 230 / 76. Let me compute that: 230 ÷76 is approximately 3.026. So R = 3.026 - 0.18 = 2.846 ohms. Hmm, but looking at the options, option H says (a) 2.82 ohms. Close enough, maybe rounding. So part (a) is approximately 2.82 ohms. So I would go with option H for part (a).

Part (c): the armature current at starting with no resistance. So without any series resistance, the current is I_a = V / R_a = 230 /0.18 ≈ 1277.78 A. But the options given don't have this exactly. Let me look at the options. Option H's (c) is 1150 A. Hmm, 1277.78 is not 1150, but maybe the options are rounded. Let's check if I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps in part (c), we're not considering the armature's own resistance. So when starting, the armature current is I_a = V / R_a, which is 230 / 0.18 ≈ 1277.78 A. But the options don't have this. Oh, wait, looking at the options, option H (c) is 1150. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is part (c) is miswritten. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the initial question says that in part (c), the armature current is not to exceed 76 A. Oh no, no, part (c) is the current at starting without any resistance. So that's 1277.78 A, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option H's (c) is 1150 A. So perhaps the correct answer is H for (a), and H for (c). But I'm getting 1277.78 which doesn't match any option. Hmm, maybe I need to check the problem again.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again about part (a). The armature resistance during starting must be such that I_a =76 A. So the armature's resistance is R_a + R_s. So 230 =76*(0.18 + R_s). So 230 /76 = 0.18 + R_s. 230/76 is 3.0263. So 0.18 + R_s =3.0263 → R_s=3.0263-0.18=2.8463 ohms. So about 2.85, which rounds to 2.82 in option H. So (a) is H. (c) is 1277.78, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake regarding part (c).

Wait, the question says "the armature current at the instant of starting if no resistance is inserted." So that's I_a = 230 / R_armature. But R_armature is R_a plus R_s, and in this case, R_s is zero. So R_armature is 0.18 ohms. So 230 /0.18= 1277.78 A. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option for (c) is 'none of the above,' but the options don't have that, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the armature current is calculated without considering any other factors. Let me think: when no resistance is inserted, the armature current is I_a = V / R_a = 230 /0.18 ≈ 1277.78 A, which is about 1278 A. So looking at the options, the closest is option H's (c) which is 1150 A. So perhaps H is not the correct answer for (c). Hmm, but how to reconcile this.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding part (c). Let me read the question again: (c) the armature current at the instant of starting if no resistance is inserted. So yes, that's 1277.78. But the options don't have this number. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not an option given. So maybe I made a mistake in part (c). Or perhaps in the options, the (c) part is 1277, which is not in the options. Hmm. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, H's (c) is 1150. So perhaps I'm wrong in my calculation. Let me check: 230 /76 is approximately 3.0263. So 3.0263 - 0.18 = 2.8463, which is about 2.85 ohms, which rounds to 2.82 in option H. So (a) is H. And for (c), perhaps I made a mistake. If no resistance is inserted, armature current is 230 /0.18 = 1277.78 A. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer for part (c) isn't among the options, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps in part (c), the armature current is being considered as the field current. No, no. The field current is I_f, which is zero at starting, so I_a is 76 A. So (c) is the armature current at starting when no resistance is inserted, which is 1278 A, which isn't in the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps part (c) is referring to a different scenario. Let me read the question again: (c) the armature current at the instant of starting if no resistance is inserted. So yes, 230 /0.18 is correct.

But looking at the options, the only option where (a) is 2.82 is option H. But (c) doesn't match. So perhaps I should check the other options for other parts.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: the options are A to J. Let me go through each option.

Option H: (a) 2.82, (b) 0.65, (c) 1150 A. So part (a) is correct. Part (c) is 1150, which is less than 1278. So why would (c) be 1150?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating part (c). Let me think: the shunt motor's armature current is 76 A at starting. So armature voltage is 230 V. So armature's resistance is R_armature = V / I_a = 230 /76 ≈3.0263 ohms. So the shunt resistor is R_s = R_armature - R_f. But R_f is negligible (say, R_f =0), so R_s=3.0263 ohms. So inserting a series resistance of 3.0263 ohms. But again, in the options, no such value is present.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between series and shunt. Let me think about the shunt formula. Oh, wait, perhaps the shunt resistance is in parallel with the armature. So in starting, R_f is zero, so R_armature = R_a. So when no resistance is inserted, I_a =230 /0.18 ≈1278 A. But that's not in the options.

Wait, looking at option H, (c) is 1150 A, which is 230 /1.96. Wait, 230 divided by 1.96 is approximately 1173, which isn't 1150. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the armature's equivalent resistance. Alternatively, could the armature current be calculated using the shunt equation? Let me recall: in a shunt motor, I_a = I_s + I_f. When starting, I_f =0, so I_a = I_s. But perhaps the armature's current is the sum of I_s and I_f, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again: The shunt motor's armature resistance forms a parallel combination with the field resistance. So the armature's equivalent resistance is R_armature = R_a + R_f. So I think I'm right earlier. So for (a), inserting a series resistance R_s to make I_a=76 A, so R_s = R_armature - R_f. But R_f is negligible, so R_s = R_armature, which is 230 /76 ≈3.026, which is about 2.82 ohms (option H). So (a) is H.

For part (c), the armature current at starting with no resistance: I_a =230/0.18 =1277.78 A, which is not in the options. So perhaps the correct option for (c) is not present in the given options, but I have to choose the best possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the shunt in part (c). Wait, no, part (c) says "if no resistance is inserted in the armature circuit." So yes, armature current is 230/0.18.

Wait, perhaps the options have (c) as 1278 A, but the options don't. So maybe (c) is 1278, but none of the options list it. But looking at the options, option H (c) is 1150, which is 230/1.96, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm wrong on part (c), but I can't see another way.

Wait, perhaps in part (c), I'm supposed to calculate the armature current without considering the shunt. No, that's not how it works. The shunt divides the armature current into field current and armature current. So I'm confident that (c) is 1278 A.

But looking at the options, the only one with 2.82 ohms is option H. But the (c) part isn't matching. So perhaps the question is wrong or I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the starting condition. At starting, the armature current is maximum. So, but no, part (a) is about limiting armature current.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is presented differently. Let me think about part (b): inserting a resistance and finding the new value when E_c is 168 V. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps in part (c), the armature current without any resistance is the field current. But that doesn't make sense. The field current is I_f = E_armature / R_f. But without any resistance, I_f=0, so I_a=0. That can't be right either. So I'm stuck on part (c).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at all the options again.

Option H: (a) 2.82, (b) 0.65, (c)1150.

Part (a) is correct if the series resistance is 2.82. Part (b) and (c) don't match, but let's see.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in part (b). Let me think: when the armature accelerates until E_c is 168 V, what's the resistance that can be reduced. The armature's current without starting is I = V / R_armature. So when armature current is I = V/R_armature, and the armature is connected in shunt, the field current is I_f = V - E_c. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c is 168 V. So E_c = I_a * (R_a - R_s). Because R_s is the series resistance. Oh wait, perhaps I should consider the armature's effective resistance as R_a - R_s, since R_s is in series. So E_c = I_a * (R_a - R_s).

So E_c = I_a (R_a - R_s). But at starting, E_c = I_a R_a.

Wait, but when accelerating, the field current I_f is E_c / R_f, since E_c = I_f R_f. So I_f = E_c / R_f.

But in shunt connection, I_f = I_a - I_s. Hmm, perhaps I should model it as I_f = I_a - I_s. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, when the armature current is I_a, the field current is I_f = (E_c - V) / R_f. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to model part (b). At starting, E_c is zero, so I_a = V/R_a=230/0.18≈1277.78 A. When accelerating, E_c is 168 V. The field current is I_f = E_c / R_f. The armature current is I_a = I_f + I_s, but in shunt, I_f = V - E_c (no, that doesn't make sense). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the armature's voltage is E_armature = V - I_s R_s. Because the series resistance R_s is in series with the armature. So E_armature = V - R_s I_s.

At starting, E_armature = I_a R_a. So I_a R_a = V - R_s I_s.

But I_s = I_a (since R_s is negligible), so I_a R_a = V - R_s I_a.

Rearranging: I_a (R_a + R_s) = V.

Wait, but that's the same as the starting condition. So perhaps I'm not getting part (b) right.

Alternatively, when accelerating, E_c is 168 V. So the armature's voltage V is E_c + V_shunt. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the armature's voltage: V = E_armature + V_shunt. Or perhaps V = E_armature + I_s R_s. Because the armature's voltage is the sum of the field voltage and the back EMF (which is I_s R_s due to the series resistance).

Wait, no, the armature's voltage is V_armature = E_f + V_shunt. And V_shunt (the shunt voltage) is I_s R_s, with I_s being the armature current. Because the shunt is in parallel.

So E_armature = E_f + V_shunt = (I_f) R_f + I_s R_s.

But I_f is also I_a - I_s (assuming I_s is the series current; but wait, no, in shunt, I_f = I_a - I_s because I_s + I_f = I_a. So I_f = I_a - I_s.

Putting it all together: E_armature = (I_a - I_s) R_f + I_s R_s.

But we also know that E_armature = V - V_shunt. Or perhaps it's better to think in terms of armature current.

Let me think, when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c = V - V_shunt. V_shunt is I_s R_s, because the shunt's voltage is the armature's current times the shunt resistance.

So E_c = V - I_s R_s.

But I_s is the armature current, so E_c = V - I_s R_s.

Rearranged: I_s R_s = V - E_c.

So I_s = (V - E_c) / R_s.

But the shunt current I_f is I_a - I_s.

So I_f = I_a - (V - E_c)/R_s.

But E_c is known as 168 V.

So I_f = I_a - (230 -168)/ R_s = I_a - (62)/ R_s.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the armature's current is determined by the field and the armature's resistance. So when accelerating, the armature's resistance is lower, so I_a increases. But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and can just look for the correct option from the given.

Option H's (a) is 2.82 ohms, which fits part (a). Part (c) is 1150 ohms, which is not part of the given options. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but since the question says to select from A to J, I have to choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me think: if the armature current at starting is 230 /0.18 =1277.78 A, which is approximately 1278 A. None of the options have this. So perhaps the correct option is not available, but that's not an option provided.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula for part (c). Let me re-express it. When no resistance is inserted, the armature current is I_a = V/R_a =230/0.18≈1277.78 A. So looking at the options, the only option with a value close is option H's (c) 1150 A, but that's not matching. So perhaps the correct answer is H, but part (c) is not correct. But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation for part (c). Let me recheck: 230 divided by 1.96 is approximately 1173.47 A. So 230/1.96 = ~1173.47 A. None of the options have this. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me try another approach. If the armature current at starting is I_a = V/R_a =230/0.18≈1277.78 A.

Looking at the options, the only option with a value close is option H's (c) 1150 A, which is lower than 1277.78. So perhaps the correct option is H, but part (c) is incorrect. But again, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation for part (c). Let me recheck: 230/0.18 is 1277.78 Ohms. So I'm confident that (c) is not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps H is the correct answer, but part (c) is not correct. But that's not possible. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the earlier calculations.

Wait, perhaps part (a) is 2.85 ohms, but option H is 2.82. So that's a minor error but not a big issue. So perhaps the correct option is H, but part (c) is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at part (b). Let me think: part (b) says, "calculate the resistance that can be reduced when the armature accelerates until E_c is 168 V." How?

So when the armature accelerates, the armature current is such that E_c is 168 V. So E_c = I_a (R_a - R_s). Because R_s is in series with R_a, so the effective resistance when accelerating is R_a - R_s.

So E_c = I_a (R_a - R_s).

We know that at starting, E_c =0, so I_a R_a =0. But when accelerating, E_c =168 V.

So 168 = I_a (0.18 - R_s).

But I_a is the armature current when accelerating.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to express I_a in terms of E_c. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a shunt connection.

Wait, perhaps when accelerating, the armature current is I_a = (E_c) / (R_f). Because E_c = I_f R_f. So I_f = E_c / R_f. But in shunt, I_f = I_a - I_s.

Wait, perhaps E_c = I_a R_f.

But I'm not making progress. Let me consider that when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c = I_a R_f. Because R_f is the field resistance. So I_a = E_c / R_f.

So, if E_c is 168 V, then I_a =168/R_f.

But what is R_f? It's the field resistance, which is negligible or known. But in this problem, perhaps R_f is zero, making I_a = infinity, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the armature resistance. When accelerating, the armature's resistance is R_a - R_s. So E_c = I_a (R_a - R_s).

We know that E_c =168 V. So 168 = I_a (0.18 - R_s).

But also, from starting condition, E_c =0 = I_a R_a → I_a =0 if R_a is zero, which it's not. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the armature current is the same as the shunt, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the armature current when accelerating is I_a = (E_c) / (R_f). But R_f =0, so I_a is zero, which can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c = I_a R_f. But then I_a = E_c / R_f. But R_f is... I don't know. If R_f is a fixed value, say R_f =0, then I_a would be infinite, which is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps R_f is the field resistance, which is zero. So I_a = E_c / R_f → 168 /0 → infinity. Which is impossible.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c = I_a R_f. But with R_f=0, I_a is zero, which is impossible. So perhaps the correct approach is that when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c = I_a R_f, but R_f is a fixed value. So I_a = E_c / R_f.

But since R_f is not given, perhaps it's a fixed value, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the armature current is I_a = (E_c) / R_f, but without knowing R_f, perhaps R_f is a fixed value.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c = I_a R_f. So I_a = E_c / R_f.

But what is R_f? It's the field resistance, which is a fixed value, but not given in the problem. So perhaps the problem is expecting us to assume R_f is a constant value, but without knowing it, perhaps the problem is not solvable as given.

Wait, but the problem is given, so perhaps I'm missing another approach. Let me think of it as follows: when accelerating, the armature current is I_a. The shunt is in parallel, so the armature current is divided into armature current and field current. So, the armature current is I_a = I_s + I_f. Where I_s is the series current, and I_f is the field current.

But I'm not making progress. Let me consider time.

I think time is up, and I should proceed to answer based on the prior analysis. So, the correct answer is option H, with (a) 2.82 ohms. But part (c) is not matching any option. So perhaps the correct answer is H, but part (c) is incorrect. However, since the problem requires to select from A to J, I think H is the correct choice, but perhaps the question expects H as the answer, despite part (c) not being correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when accelerating, the armature current is such that E_c = I_a R_f, but R_f is a fixed value. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use R_f as a given value. But in this problem, I don't have R_f. So perhaps I'm missing another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute R_s for part (a), and that's it. So, I think option H is correct, but perhaps part (c) is incorrect, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a formula that I can use to find part (c). Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the armature's resistance is R_a plus the shunt resistance R_s. So, R_armature = R_a + R_s. So, at starting condition, I_a = V / R_armature.

But when accelerating, E_c = V - I_s R_s. And I_a = I_s + I_f.

But I'm not making progress. I think I should proceed, but perhaps the correct answer is H, but part (c) is incorrect. However, the problem requires me to select from A to J, so I think H is the correct answer, but perhaps I made a mistake in part (c).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute R_s as the shunt resistance for part (a), which is H. So, I think option H is correct, but part (c) is incorrect.

But perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me think once more. Let me consider that when accelerating, the armature current is I_a, and the shunt current is I_s. The armature current is I_a = I_s + I_f, where I_f is the field current.

But perhaps the armature current is I_a = I_s + I_f. And E_c = I_f R_f.

But in shunt connection, I_a = I_s + I_f. So, E_c = I_f R_f.

And I don't know I_f. So perhaps I can express E_c in terms of I_s.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as:

At starting, E_c = 0 → I_a R_a =0. So I_a =0 if R_a is not zero. But that's not possible.

When accelerating, E_c =168 V. So, I_a R_a =168 V.

So, I_a =168 / R_a.

But R_a is 0.18 ohms. So I_a =168 /0.18 ≈933.33 A.

Wait, but that's impossible because armature current can't be that high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing another approach. Let me think of the armature's resistance as R_armature = R_a - R_s.

So, E_c = I_a (R_a - R_s).

But E_c is 168 V.

So, 168 = I_a (0.18 - R_s).

And I_a is the armature current when accelerating.

But without knowing I_a, perhaps I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that R_s is the shunt resistance.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as:

From starting condition, E_c =0 → I_a R_a =0.

But when accelerating, E_c = I_a R_f.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when accelerating, the armature current is I_a = E_c / R_f. But I don't know R_f. So perhaps I'm missing another formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct option is H, but part (c) is incorrect, but I'm not sure.

But since the problem requires me to select from A to J, I think option H is correct, but perhaps part (c) is incorrect. However, the problem doesn't specify that part (c) is incorrect. So perhaps I should proceed with option H.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the correct answer is option H, but part (c) is incorrect. However, in the multiple-choice question, perhaps the correct answer is H, but part (c) is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me think again. If the armature current at starting is I_a =230 /0.18 ≈1277.78 A. When accelerating, E_c =168 V. So, I_a =168 / R_f.

But R_f is not known. So perhaps I'm missing another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the armature current is I_a = (E_c) / R_f. But without knowing R_f, perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think of R_f as being a fixed value, and perhaps I'm supposed to assume that R_f =0, which gives I_a = infinity, which is impossible. So perhaps R_f is a fixed value, say R_f = something.

Wait, but in this problem, perhaps R_f is a fixed value, and I'm supposed to find I_a when accelerating.

But without knowing R_f, perhaps I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the armature as being in shunt, so I_a = I_s + I_f. And E_c = I_f R_f.

So, I_a = (E_c) / R_f + I_f.

But also, I_a = I_s + I_f.

So, substituting, I_s + I_f = (E_c) / R_f + I_f.

So, I_s = (E_c) / R_f.

But also, E_c = I_a (R_a - R_s).

But without knowing I_a, perhaps I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as:

From starting condition, E_c =0 → I_a R_a =0. So I_a =0 if R_a is not zero. But that's impossible.

From accelerating condition, E_c=168 V → I_a R_a =168 V.

So, I_a =168 / R_a.

But from shunt, I_a = I_s + I_f.

And E_c = I_f R_f.

So, I_f = E_c / R_f.

Substituting into I_a = I_s + I_f:

I_a = I_s + E_c / R_f.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can express I_s in terms of I_a.

I_s = I_a - I_f.

But I_f = E_c / R_f.

So, I_s = I_a - E_c / R_f.

Substituting into E_a = I_a R_a = I_s + I_f:

I_a R_a = (I_a - E_c / R_f) + E_c / R_f.

Simplify:

I_a R_a = I_a.

So, I_a R_a - I_a =0 → I_a (R_a -1) =0.

So, I_a =0 or R_a =1.

But R_a is 0.18 ohms, which is not 1. So I_a must be zero, which is impossible.

So, this approach leads to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the armature's resistance.

Wait, perhaps the armature's resistance is R_a, and the shunt resistance is R_s. So, the effective armature resistance is R_a - R_s.

So, E_c = I_a (R_a - R_s).

So, I_a = E_c / (R_a - R_s).

Now, E_c is 168 V. So, I_a = 168 / (0.18 - R_s).

But I don't know R_s. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, but perhaps R_s is the shunt resistance, which is the same as the armature shunt. So, R_s is the shunt resistance.

So, R_s is known? Or can I find it?

Alternatively, perhaps R_s is the shunt resistance, which can be found using the formula for armature current.

But without knowing R_s, I'm stuck. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the given options.

Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with option H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the armature current when accelerating.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as follows:

At starting, E_c =0 → I_a R_a =0 → I_a =0 (impossible).

So, when accelerating, E_c =168 V.

So, I_a =168 V / R_a.

But R_a is 0.18 ohms. So, I_a =168 /0.18 ≈933.33 A.

But that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find R_s.

But without knowing R_s, perhaps I'm stuck.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to option H as the correct answer, even though part (c) is incorrect, but I don't know why.

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure about part (c).

The correct answer is **H**, but part (c) **1150 A** is incorrect.
