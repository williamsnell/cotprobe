Okay, so I've got this question about calcium atoms. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think this through. The question is asking which statement about the calcium atom is correct.

First, I remember that an atom consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons determines the element. Calcium is an alkaline earth metal, right? So it's in group 2. Group 2 means it has 2 valence electrons, but that's probably not directly relevant here.

The atomic number of an element tells you the number of protons in the nucleus. So for calcium, the atomic number is 20. That means every calcium atom has 20 protons. So options A and H are talking about 20 protons each, but A says 20 protons and neutrons, and H says 20 protons and 20 electrons. Wait, but I don't know about the neutrons or electrons yet.

Electrons are part of the atom's structure too. The number of electrons equals the number of protons in a neutral atom because the positive charge from protons cancels out the negative charge from electrons. So calcium has 20 electrons. So any statement that includes 20 electrons might be correct. Looking at the options, option F says 40 protons and 40 electrons—that's not right because calcium has 20 protons and 20 electrons. So F is incorrect.

Option G says all calcium atoms have a mass of 20.078 u. Wait, atomic mass is the sum of protons and neutrons, right? So the atomic mass (also called the isotope mass) depends on the number of neutrons. Calcium can have different isotopes. Like, calcium-40, calcium-42, etc. So each has a different number of neutrons. For example, if it's Ca-40, there are 20 protons (so 20 neutrons, since 40-20=20). So the mass of the atom would be around 20.08 u, but each isotope's mass varies. So option G says all calcium atoms have a mass of 20.078 u. That's probably wrong because not all calcium atoms are the same; some are Ca-40, others Ca-42, etc. Their masses would vary.

Option E says all calcium atoms have a mass of 40.078 u. That can't be right because 40 is way too high. The atomic mass is usually around 40 for Ca-20? Wait, wait, no. Ca-40 has 20 protons and 20 neutrons. So mass number is 40. The atomic mass would be around 40 (but slightly more because neutrons have mass). So option E is saying 40 u, which seems too high. Wait, no, the atomic mass of Ca-40 would be about 40.08 u, but option E says 40.078 u. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But I'm not sure, let me think.

Wait, I remember that the atomic mass unit (u) is a measure of mass, but for different isotopes, each has a different number of neutrons, so their mass varies. So option E suggests all calcium atoms have the same mass, which isn't the case. So E is incorrect.

Option D says all calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. Wait, wait, the number of neutrons varies but the number of protons is fixed. So a calcium atom has 20 protons, that's a given. Electrons equal protons, so 20 as well. But the number of neutrons varies. So the statement in D says 'neutrons' are present, which is correct because every atom has neutrons. So D says all calcium atoms have 20 protons, which is true, and all have 20 electrons, which is true. But the statement also says they have 'neutrons' which is correct. So D seems correct. But wait, I should check the other options.

Looking at option C: It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. Wait, wait, that can't be right because in a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. So both protons and electrons are 20. But the statement says 'neutrons' are also present. So option C is incorrect because it's not talking about the presence of neutrons, only protons and electrons. So option C is wrong.

Option J: It contains 40 protons and 20 electrons. No, that's not right because calcium has 20 protons, so J is incorrect.

Option G is about mass, which varies. So G is wrong.

Option A: 20 protons and neutrons. That's incorrect because the number of neutrons varies. So A is wrong.

Option B: All calcium atoms have 20 protons and 40 neutrons. That's incorrect because the number of neutrons varies. So B is wrong.

Option C: It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. Wait, in a neutral atom, electrons = protons. So the atom would have 20 electrons but also 20 protons, but the statement in C includes neutrons. So the statement says 'contains' neutrons, which is correct but not part of the correct description. Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So option C includes neutrons, but that's not part of the correct description. The correct statement should be about protons and electrons. So option C is incorrect.

Wait, no, the question is about correct statements, not about the correct elements. So which of the options accurately describes a correct statement.

Looking again, option G: All calcium atoms have a mass of 20.078 u. That's incorrect as I discussed before, because mass varies with the number of neutrons.

So now, the options are between D and other options.

Wait, option D says "All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." Wait, that's not correct. Because the statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." So it's saying that in every calcium atom, there are 20 protons, 20 neutrons, and 20 electrons. But that's not true because neutrons vary.

Wait, but what about the statement: "All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." Actually, that's correct in terms of the individual atom, but the statement is incorrect because not all calcium atoms have the same number of neutrons. But the statement is about the presence of protons, neutrons, and electrons in any calcium atom. Are all calcium atoms the same?

No, because calcium has isotopes. So some have 20 neutrons (Ca-40), others have 21 (Ca-41), 22 (Ca-42), etc. So each isotope has different numbers of neutrons. So the option D says, "All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." Wait, but that's wrong because some have more neutrons. So the statement is incorrect because it's not true that all have the same number of neutrons. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So, let's recap:

Each calcium atom has 20 protons (so A is wrong because A says 20 protons and 20 neutrons, but not all have 20 neutrons). So D says all have 20 protons, 20 neutrons, and 20 electrons. That's not correct because the number of neutrons varies among the isotopes. So D is incorrect.

So which option is correct?

Wait, looking back, option D says "All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." Wait, no, that can't be right because some have more neutrons. So D is incorrect.

Now, considering the options again, which one is correct.

Looking at option G: All calcium atoms have a mass of 20.078 u. That's incorrect because the mass varies with the number of neutrons. So option G is wrong.

Option E: All calcium atoms have a mass of 40.078 u. That's not correct because as I thought earlier, calcium has a mass in the 40s. Wait, but what's the exact value? I think the atomic mass of calcium is around 40.078 u. But wait, the statement says all have 40.078 u. So option E is incorrect because it suggests all are the same mass, which isn't true.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The atomic mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons. So for Ca-40, protons=20, neutrons=20. So atomic mass is 40.078 u. So that's one isotope. But other isotopes have more neutrons, so their mass would be higher. For example, Ca-42 has 22 neutrons, so mass is 42.034 u. So all calcium atoms have varying masses, but option E says all have 40.078 u, which is wrong.

So let's look at the options again.

Option D is incorrect because it's not true that all have the same number of neutrons.

What about option G? No, mass varies.

Option E: All have 40.078 u. Incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me read option D again. Option D says: "All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." Wait, but that's not correct because the number of neutrons varies. So D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about option G again. It says all have a mass of 20.078 u. But that's not correct because the mass depends on the number of neutrons. So no, G is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should look at each option again.

Option A: 20 protons and neutrons. That's incorrect because neutrons vary. So no.

Option B: All have 20 protons and 40 neutrons. Incorrect because neutrons vary.

Option C: Contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. But wait, in a neutral atom, electrons = protons, which is correct, but the statement says "contains neutrons"—so that's correct. Wait, option C's statement is "It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." So, in a neutral atom, yes, but the presence of neutrons is correct, but the statement is worded as "contains" all three. So option C is correct in terms of the individual atom's components, but the way it's phrased is: "It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." So that's correct, because each has 20 protons, 20 electrons, and some number of neutrons. So option C would be correct.

But wait, option C says "It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons." That's correct, but the option is part of the question—so which option is correct among the choices.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct about the calcium atom. So among the options, which one is correct.

So option C says calcium atoms contain 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. Which is correct because in any calcium atom, the number of protons is 20, electrons is 20, and neutrons varies. So the statement is correct, because all calcium atoms have 20 protons (so correct), 20 electrons (so correct), and some (but not all) neutrons (so correct as the statement doesn't say "all have the same number of neutrons").

So option C is correct?

Wait, but option D says all have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. Which is incorrect because the neutrons vary. So option C is correct.

So among the options, what's correct.

So looking again, the options are:

Option C: It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons.

Yes, that makes sense. Because in any calcium atom, the number of protons is 20 (correct), number of electrons is 20 (correct), and the number of neutrons varies (so the statement is correct as a general statement about the atom).

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

To determine the correct statement about calcium, let's analyze each option systematically:

1. **Option A: "It contains 20 protons and neutrons."**  
   This is incorrect because calcium (Ca) has 20 protons, but the number of neutrons varies among its isotopes. For example, calcium-40 has 20 protons and 20 neutrons, while calcium-42 has 20 protons and 22 neutrons. Thus, this statement is not universally true.

2. **Option B: "All atoms of calcium have 20 protons and 40 neutrons."**  
   This is incorrect because calcium can have different isotopes, each with a different number of neutrons. For instance, calcium-40 has 20 protons and 20 neutrons, while calcium-42 has 20 protons and 22 neutrons. Therefore, this statement is false.

3. **Option C: "It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons."**  
   This is correct. In any calcium atom, the number of protons is 20 (as determined by the atomic number), the number of electrons is also 20 (since the atom is neutral), and the number of neutrons varies among the isotopes. Thus, this statement accurately describes the composition of calcium atoms.

4. **Option D: "All calcium atoms have 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons."**  
   This is incorrect because the number of neutrons varies among calcium isotopes. For example, calcium-40 has 20 protons and 20 neutrons, while calcium-42 has 20 protons and 22 neutrons. Therefore, this statement is not universally true.

5. **Option E: "All atoms of calcium have a mass of 40.078 u."**  
   This is incorrect because the atomic mass of calcium varies depending on the isotope. For example, calcium-40 has an atomic mass of approximately 40.078 u, but so do other isotopes like calcium-42 (42.034 u) and calcium-44 (44.085 u). Thus, this statement is false.

6. **Option F: "It contains 40 protons and 40 electrons."**  
   This is incorrect because calcium has 20 protons and 20 electrons, not 40.

7. **Option G: "It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons."**  
   This is incorrect because while it is true that all calcium atoms have 20 protons and 20 electrons, the statement does not account for the varying number of neutrons among isotopes.

8. **Option H: "It contains 20 neutrons and 20 electrons."**  
   This is incorrect because while all calcium atoms have 20 electrons, they also have varying numbers of neutrons.

9. **Option I: "It contains 20 neutrons and 20 electrons."**  
   This is incorrect because calcium has 20 protons and 20 neutrons in some isotopes (e.g., calcium-40), but not all isotopes have the same number of neutrons.

10. **Option J: "It contains 40 protons and 20 electrons."**  
    This is incorrect because calcium has 20 protons and 20 electrons, not 40.

### Conclusion:
The only correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the composition of calcium atoms: they contain 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons.
