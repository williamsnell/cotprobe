Question:

A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Migraine with aura
B: Bacterial meningitis
C: Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis
D: Herpes simplex encephalitis
E: Influenza encephalopathy
F: Dextromethorphan intoxication
G: Viral meningitis
H: HIV encephalopathy
I: Lyme disease
J: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis

Okay, so I've got this question about a medical case, and I need to figure out the correct diagnosis. Let me take it step by step.

The patient is a 22-year-old college student who's been to the emergency department 20 minutes after seeing her have a seizure. She's confused and can't think of words. She has a headache, cough, and fever for three days, treating with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C, which is pretty high, so that's probably not a low temperature case, like a fever decreasing. 

Her neurological exam shows diffuse hyperreflexia. Hyperreflexia is when the brain is overly stimulated, usually due to things like seizures or other neurological disorders. But she’s confused, so maybe something else is going on.

She has short-term memory deficits and difficulty naming objects. She makes literal paraphasic errors, which suggests that her language processing is impaired, maybe something like a lack of motor skills or impaired speech.

On the MRI, there's bitemporal hyperintensities in the brain. Bitemporal means they're high in the middle and late parts. This can be indicative of certain infections, like74. Epilepsy, maybe. Hyperintensities can also come from infections like BEMV (Epstein-Barr virus), which can cause hyperintensity in the brain.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm³. Erythrocytes are red blood cells, so low numbers (like 340) would suggest anemia. leukocyte count of 121, mostly monocytes. High leukocytes can indicate infections like BEMV (which has a higher leukocyte count than BCG, which is 12-13). Also, protein concentration is 78 mg/dL, which is a bit high for a patient without a history of diabetes or kidney issues, since normal ranges are usually around 35-65 mg/dL (I think, maybe 70 is borderline, but could be a bit high). So maybe BEMV is more likely because it's a higher concentration than normal and has higher leukocyte counts.

Looking at the options:

A: Migraine with aura. They have a headache. It could be a migraine, but the MRI shows hyperreflexia—migraines sometimes cause hyperreflexia. The MRI shows bitemporal hyperintensities, which are more indicative of BEMV or maybe an infection. But wait, hyperreflexia is a sign of migraine. So if she has hyperreflexia, maybe it's a migraine, but she also has a fever, which is a symptom. Also, she's confused, so maybe not just a migraine. But I'm not sure yet.

B: Bacterial meningitis. That would cause a fever, but she's been treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan, which is a fever reducing drug. If she had bacterial meningitis, she would have a severe fever, and maybe a rash. But here, her temperature is 38.9, which is high, suggesting maybe a bacterial infection that's not severe, but it's possible.

C: Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis. This is an autoimmune disease causing encephalitis (brain inflammation) and can lead to hyperreflexia and bitemporal hyperintensities. The CSF has higher than normal proteins (78 vs. normal around 35-40), which is more indicative of BEMV. So this fits.

D: Herpes simplex encephalitis. That's a viral infection, can cause hyperreflexia, and is typically with a fever, usually in a more severe form. But in this case, she's treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan, so probably not a viral encephalitis. Also, the CSF has high proteins, which is more indicative of an infection rather than a viral one.

E: Influenza encephalopathy. Similar to BEMV but less severe. It can cause hyperreflexia, but the CSF protein is higher, which is more BEMV-like.

F: Dextromethorphan intoxication. That would be when someone ingested the drug, leading to a severe, prolonged headache and confusion. Her symptoms are more like a mild confusion, not prolonged. So probably not this.

G: Viral meningitis. This would involve a viral cause, but the CSF has high proteins, which is more BEMV. So probably not.

H: HIV encephalitis. That's an enzyme inhibitor from HIV. It can cause hyperreflexia and bitemporal hyperintensities. But HIV is a viral infection, but I don't know if it would have high protein levels. HIV seems to have lower protein levels in CSF, perhaps around 20-30. So the 78 is higher, so probably not HIV.

I: Lyme disease. That's an infection caused by a parasite, which could cause brain inflammation. It's a rare condition, but could have hyperreflexia. However, the CSF has higher protein than normal, which is more BEMV. So maybe not Lyme.

J: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. This is an acute form of viral encephalitis where the virus infects some cells but doesn't cause a complete breakdown. It causes mild to moderate symptoms, like confusion, but may not be as severe as BEMV. Her symptoms are more like a more severe form. So perhaps this is less likely.

Now, considering the CSF, the higher protein level (78) is higher than normal, which points towards BEMV. So the MRI of brain showing hyperintensities (bitemporal) and CSF with higher than normal proteins are signs of BEMV.

So the correct diagnosis would be Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis, which is option C.

The patient is a 22-year-old college student with a history of a sudden seizure, which is likely due to an underlying neurological condition. The clinical presentation includes a high fever (38.9°C), confusion, difficulty naming objects, and short-term memory deficits. Neurological examination reveals diffuse hyperreflexia, which is a hallmark of seizures or other neurological disorders. The MRI shows bitemporal hyperintensities, a characteristic of conditions like BEMV or viral encephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis indicates an erythrocyte count of 340/mm³, leukocyte count of 121/mm³ (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL, which is significantly higher than normal and more characteristic of BEMV.

Option A, migraine with aura, is unlikely because the patient's CSF suggests an infection, not migraine-like symptoms. Option B, bacterial meningitis, could cause a severe fever, but this patient was treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan, indicating a non-severe infection. Option C, Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis, aligns well with the clinical and laboratory findings, including the high CSF protein level and bitemporal hyperintensities. Options D, herpes simplex encephalitis, and E, influenza encephalopathy, are less likely due to the CSF protein level and the patient's symptoms. Options F, ginton plasmodium intoxication, and G, HIV encephalitis, are rare and less likely given the patient's presentation. Options J, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and I, Lyme disease, are also less likely, as they do not fit the clinical and laboratory data as well as BEMV.

The most likely diagnosis is **Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis**.
