Alright, so I've got this engineering mechanics problem here about belts and slipping. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. Okay, the problem says an engine runs at 1100 rpm, which is 1100 revolutions per minute. It's driving a line shaft using a belt, and the power needed is 25 horsepower. The coefficient of friction is 0.25. They're asking about the belt slip for two angles of contact: 150 degrees and 100 degrees. The options are A to J, each giving different possibilities.

Wait, I remember that belt slip has to do with how much the driving pulley and the driven pulley slip relative to each other. Oh right, when the speed ratio is high, the belt tends to slip more. And the angle of contact affects this slip. The higher the angle of contact (like 150 degrees), the higher the slip? Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So, the formula for belt speed is related to the rotational speed. The formula is v = π * D * N / 60, where D is diameter in inches, and N is speed in rpm. Wait, let me plug in the numbers. The pulley diameter is 9 inches. So D=9 inches. N is 1100 rpm.

Calculating belt speed: v = π *9 *1100 /60. Let me compute that. π is about 3.1416. So 9*1100 = 9900. 9900 divided by 60 is 165. Multiply by π: 165 *3.1416 ≈ 518.36 inches per second. Alternatively, maybe I should keep it in feet or convert differently. Hmm, perhaps I can compute the linear speed in feet per minute? Wait, no, maybe I should compute the angular velocity first.

Angular velocity ω is in radians per second. So, N is 1100 rpm. So 2π radians per revolution. So each revolution is 2π radians. So total angular velocity ω = 2π *1100 /60 = approx 2 *3.1416 *1100 /60. 2*3.1416 is about 6.2832. 6.2832 *1100 is 6891.52. Divide by 60: approx 114.8587 rad/s.

Wait, maybe I should compute the tangential velocity v = ω * r, where r is radius. Radius is 9/2 =4.5 inches. So v = 114.8587 rad/s * 4.5 inches. Let's compute that. 114.8587 *4.5 ≈ 516.86 inches per second. Hmm, but that's in inches per second. Wait, but usually, in belt problems, they use feet, so I should convert inches to feet. 516.86 inches/s is 43.07 feet/s. So the belt is moving at about 43 feet per second.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, since belt velocity is often given in feet per minute for these types of problems. So converting 43.07 feet per second to feet per minute: 43.07 *60 ≈2584.2 feet per minute. That's a high speed. Wait, the problem says the engine is running at 1100 rpm. Hmm. Let me confirm: 1100 rpm is a high speed. So the belt speed is indeed 2584 feet per minute. Okay.

Now, the power transmitted is 25 horsepower. Horsepower to watts: 1 hp ≈ 745.7 W. So 25 hp is 25 *745.7 ≈ 18,642.5 W. Power is also equal to torque multiplied by angular velocity (ω). So tau = P / ω. Let me compute torque. Tau = 18,642.5 W / (114.8587 rad/s) ≈ 163.17 N·m.

But wait, another approach is to use the formula for belt power: P = (T * ω) / 0.7033. Oh wait, no, maybe it's better to derive it. The formula for power transmitted by a belt is P = τ * ω. And τ is the tension. The tension can be related to the power, and also to the velocity. Alternatively, the belt velocity v is related to tension and radius.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula that relates power, torque, and angular velocity. So P = T * ω. But I also know that T is related to the tension on the belt, which depends on the angle of contact and the velocity.

Alternatively, the belt's linear velocity is v = ω * r, which I already calculated as 43.07 ft/s or 518.36 inches/s. So, the formula for power is P = (T1 + T2) * v. But for a crossed belt (which is what I think this is, since it's a line shaft, so the pulleys are crossed), the tensions T1 and T2 are different. For crossed belt, T1 = (P * (v + a)) / (2π * a * cos(θ/2)), and T2 = (P * a) / (2π * a * cos(θ/2)), where a is the radius (half the pulley diameter). Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, for crossed belt, the formula is 1/(2πa) = (T1 - T2)/(P * v). Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: For a crossed belt, the formula for power is P = (T1 + T2) * v. But T1 and T2 can be expressed in terms of the tensions, which in turn depend on the coefficient of friction, the angle of contact, and the velocity.

Alternatively, I remember that for crossed belt, the belt tension can be found using the formula:

T1 = (P * v) / (2a (v cos θ + a)) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the belt speed and the angle of contact to find the necessary formulas.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the required power when using a belt is P = (T1 + T2) * v. And T1 and T2 are related to the tensions and the angle of contact.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the required power for a crossed belt is P = (T1 + T2) * v. But T1 and T2 can be found using the formula:

T1 = (P * v) / (2a (v cos θ + a)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. For crossed belts, the formula for the belt tension is T = (P * v) / (2a (v cos θ + a)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the relationship between the tensions and the velocities.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the tension. Because the power is also equal to the torque multiplied by angular velocity (P = τ * ω). And torque is related to the tension. For crossed belt, the torque is (P * a) / (2 cos(θ/2)), where a is the radius (r). So, the torque τ = (25 hp * 745.7 W/hp) * 0.375 m (wait, no, units are in ft and rpm. Let me think: actually, since the formula uses r (radius) in inches, and v in inches per minute, perhaps I should convert the power into different units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the required torque and then find the belt slip.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think about what I need to find: the belt slip. So the formula for belt slip is given by s = (1 - (f / sin(θ/2)) )^(1/μ), where μ is the coefficient of friction, θ is the angle of contact, and s is the slip. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. The formula for belt slip (s) is s = ( (1 - (f / sin(θ/2)) ) )^(1/μ) - 1. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the belt slip s is given by s = ( (1 - (f * sin(θ/2) ) ) / (f * cos(θ/2)) ) ) / (1 + (f * cos(θ/2)) ) + (f * sin(θ/2)) )/(1 + (f * cos(θ/2)) ) ) - 1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember that for crossed belts, the belt slip is given by s = ( (f / sin(θ/2) ))^(1/μ) ) -1.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for belt slip. Oh, but I can't right now. Let me think about the basics. The belt will slip if the required tension is higher than what the belt can handle. So, if the required tension is higher than the maximum tension the belt can safely transmit, slipping occurs.

So, for a crossed belt, the maximum tension T_max is (P * a * cos(θ/2)) / (2 * μ), I think. Because T_max is given by T = (P * a * cos(θ/2)) / (2 * μ). So if the required tension is higher than T_max, slipping occurs.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the maximum tension is (P * a * cos(θ/2)) / (2 * μ). So, if the tension required is higher, the belt slips.

So, let me compute the tension required.

Hmm, but wait, I don't know the tension yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the required power and then the torque, then get the tension.

Wait, another approach: The power transmitted is P = (T1 + T2) * v. And for crossed belt, the relation between T1 and T2 is T1 = (T2 * (v cos θ + a)) / (v cos θ - a). Wait, perhaps that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, I can use the formula that for crossed belt, T1 = (T2 * a) / (a + (v cos θ + a)) ). Hmm, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, I might need to refer to the formula for the torque.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the belt's maximum tension. The maximum tension T_max is given by T_max = (P * a * cos(θ/2)) / (2 * μ). Because when the belt is under tension, the frictional force is f = μ * T. So, the maximum tension without slipping is when T = (P * a * cos(θ/2)) )/( 2 μ ). Wait, not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the required tension based on the belt's allowable stress. The allowable stress σ is given by σ = (T * μ) / (0.5 * r ), where r is the radius. So, T = (σ * r ) / (2 μ ). But I don't know the allowable stress, which depends on the material. But the problem doesn't provide that info, so perhaps I shouldn't consider it. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the required tension.

Wait, perhaps I should use the belt speed to compute the required torque. Let's see. The power is P = torque * angular velocity.

Wait, P is in horsepower. Horsepower to watts is 1 hp =745.7 W. So 25 hp is 25 *745.7 = 18,642.5 W. Angular velocity ω is 1100 rpm. So in radians per second: 1100 * (2π/60) = 1100 * π/30 ≈ 115.1917 rad/s.

So, torque τ = P / ω ≈ 18,642.5 / 115.1917 ≈ 162.5 N·m. But wait, that can't be right because when you increase the speed, the required torque decreases. Wait, 1100 rpm is the engine's speed, but the transmitted power is 25 hp. So, the belt must be transmitting a torque that, when multiplied by the angular velocity, gives the power.

Wait, but 1100 rpm is the engine's speed; the belt is driven by the engine. So, the belt's angular velocity is the same as the engine's. So ω = 1100 rpm = 1100 * 2π /60 rad/s ≈ 115.19 rad/s. So, torque τ = 18,642.5 W / 115.19 rad/s ≈ 162.5 N·m. So the belt is exerting that torque.

Now, the maximum tension on the belt is T_max = (τ * r ) / (μ * cos(θ/2)), where θ is the angle of contact. Wait, I think for crossed belt, the tension is T = (T_max * cos(θ/2)) / (μ * cos(θ/2) + T_max * sin(θ/2)) ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the required tension by considering the power and the angular velocity.

Wait, the power is P = (T1 + T2) * v. But for a crossed belt, T1 = (T2 * (v cos θ + a)) / (v cos θ - a ). Hmm, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express T1 and T2 in terms of each other.

Wait, another approach: For a crossed belt, the relationship between the tensions is T1 = (T2 * a ) / (a + (v cos θ + a ) ). That might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that T1 = (T2 * ( a + v cosθ )) / ( a - v cosθ ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should proceed differently. Since the problem is about the belt slip for two angles of contact (150° and 100°), I can compute the required power for each case and compare it to the power the belt can transmit at that speed.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the engine runs at 1100 rpm, drives a line shaft by means of a belt. The engine pulley has a 9 in. diameter and 25 hp has to be transmitted." So, the engine's power is 25 hp, but the belt's power is different because of the angle of contact.

Wait, actually, no. The 25 hp is the power transmitted, which is under the belt's tension. So, the power transmitted is dependent on the belt's velocity and tension.

But perhaps the problem is asking whether the belt slip is possible for each angle. So, for each angle, calculate the necessary slip and see if it's possible.

But let me think: for the belt to slip, the required tension must be higher than what the belt can handle. So, for each angle, the required tension is higher than the maximum tension the belt can handle without slipping. So, if the required power is such that the tension is higher than T_max, then slipping occurs.

So, let's compute T_max for each angle. T_max is (P * a ) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ). Wait, I'm not sure about the formula; perhaps I should use the formula T_max = (P * a ) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ), where a is the radius (since a = 4.5 inches in this problem).

Wait, let's compute T_max for each angle.

First, compute a = 4.5 inches.

For θ =150°, θ/2=75°. cos(75°) ≈ 0.2588. So, T_max = (25 * 745.7 W) / (2 * 0.25 * 0.2588) * cm^{-1} wait, but units are in inches, and power is in W (J/s). Hmm, perhaps I should convert the power to W by multiplying by 1 hp=745.7 W. So, 25 hp = 18,642.5 W.

Wait, let's proceed numerically.

For θ=150°, cos(75°)= approx 0.2588.

So, T_max = (18642.5 W) * (4.5 in) / (2 * 0.25 * 0.2588) ) * something.

Wait, maybe the formula is T_max = (P * a ) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ) ). So, units-wise: P is in W, a is in inches (converted to meters?), but perhaps I should use the formula in consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in feet and seconds. 25 hp is 18,642.5 W. Angular velocity ω = 1100 rpm = 1100 * 2π/60 ≈ 115.19 rad/s.

So, the required torque is τ = P/ω = 18642.5 / 115.19 ≈ 162.5 N·m. But since the pulley is 9 inches in diameter, which is 0.75 feet. So, radius r = 0.375 feet.

Wait, but the formula for the required power is P = τ * ω. So, if I calculate τ = P/ω = 18642.5 / 115.19 ≈ 162.5 N·m, but this is the torque, and τ is related to the tension on the belt. So, for a crossed belt, the tension is T = ( τ * a ) / ( μ ), where a is the radius.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me compute the required power for each angle of contact.

But wait, the belt's speed is fixed at 1100 rpm. So, the angular velocity ω = 1100 rpm = 115.19 rad/s. The radius r = 4.5 inches = 0.375 feet.

So, for each angle θ, the required tension T is given by T = ( P * a ) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the required power is P = ( T * ω ) / 0.7033. So, T = ( P * 0.7033 ) / ( ω ). So, T = ( 18642.5 * 0.7033 ) / 115.19. Let's compute that.

18642.5 * 0.7033 ≈ 13,111. So 13,111 / 115.19 ≈ 113.8 N. So the required tension is about 113.8 N.

Now, the maximum tension the belt can handle is T_max = (P * a ) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ) ). Wait, plugging in the numbers:

P = 18,642.5 W.

a = 4.5 inches = 0.375 feet.

μ = 0.25.

θ = 150°, so θ/2=75°, cos(75°)=0.2588.

So, T_max = (18642.5 * 0.375 ) / ( 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 ) ).

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 = 0.12944.

Numerator: 18642.5 * 0.375 ≈ 7,036. W-inches? Hmm, perhaps units are in foot-pounds, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the formula is in terms of torque. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute T_max in newtons.

Wait, perhaps better to compute torque. Since T = (P * a) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ), and torque τ = T * r.

So, T = (P * a) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ), so τ = (P * a * r ) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ) ).

Wait, but r is the radius, which is half the diameter. So, a = r, so τ = (P * r² ) / ( 2 * μ * cos(θ/2) ) ).

So, for θ=150°, T_max = (18642.5 * (0.375)^2 ) / ( 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 ) ).

Compute numerator: 18642.5 * (0.375)^2 = 18642.5 * 0.140625 ≈ 2624. N·m.

Denominator: 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 ≈ 0.12944.

So, T_max ≈ 2624 / 0.12944 ≈ 20,122 N. That can't be right because tension in newtons is way too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think: For a crossed belt, the maximum allowable tension T_max can be calculated as T_max = ( T1_max ) / (μ ), where T1_max is the maximum tension without slip for the direction of the belt. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula T_max = ( (T1_max - T2_max ) * ( μ + cos(θ/2) ) ) / ( μ - cos(θ/2) ) ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the formula for the required power in terms of the belt's tension. The required power P = (T1 + T2) * ω. For a crossed belt, the maximum tension is T1 = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(θ/2) ) ), and T2 = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ sin(θ/2) ) ). So, the sum T1 + T2 = ( P * a ) / (2 μ ) [ 1 / cos(θ/2) + 1 / sin(θ/2) ) ].

Wait, wait, no. T1 = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(θ/2) ), T2 = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ sin(θ/2) ). So, T1 + T2 = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ ) [ 1/cos(θ/2) + 1/sin(θ/2) ) ].

Hmm, perhaps that's a way to compute the required tension. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Wait, let me compute the required tension for θ=150°. The required power is P =18,642.5 W. So, the required tension is T = (P * a) / ( μ * ω ). Wait, no, because T is related to the power as T = P / ω. So, T = 18,642.5 / 115.19 ≈ 162.5 N.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the power is in watts, which is N·m/s. So, T in newtons is P / ( ω in rads/s ). So, T = 18,642.5 / 115.19 ≈ 162.5 N.

Now, the maximum tension T_max is (P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(θ/2) ). So, let's compute that.

P = 18,642.5 W.

a = 4.5 inches = 0.375 feet.

μ=0.25.

θ=150°, θ/2=75°, cos(75°)=0.2588.

So, T_max = (18,642.5 * 0.375 ) / ( 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 ) ).

Compute numerator: 18,642.5 * 0.375 ≈ 7,036.875.

Denominator: 2 * 0.25 = 0.5; 0.5 * 0.2588 ≈ 0.1294.

So, T_max ≈ 7,036.875 / 0.1294 ≈ 54,380 N. That's way too high. That can't be right. So, perhaps I'm using the formula incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the formula is T_max = ( (P * a ) / ( μ * cos(θ/2) ) ) ). Let me compute that.

So, T_max = (18,642.5 * 0.375 ) / ( 0.25 * 0.2588 ) ) = (7,036.875 ) / (0.0647 ) ≈ 108, 420 N. Again, way too high. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the belt slip without considering the power, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the required slip based on the maximum power.

Wait, another approach: The maximum power that can be transmitted by the belt is P_max = T_max * ω. So, T_max = P_max / ω. But since we don't know P_max, perhaps we can compute it based on the current situation.

But wait, in this problem, the engine's power is 25 hp, but the belt is transmitting a different power depending on the angle of contact. So, perhaps I should compute the required power for each angle and compare it to the actual power that would be transmitted.

Wait, but the power transmitted by the belt is given by P = T * ω. So, if the belt is transmitting a higher power than the maximum allowed, then slip occurs.

Wait, but I don't know T_max for each angle. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the required power for each angle and see if it exceeds the power transmitted by the belt.

Wait, but wait, the engine's power is 25 hp, which is being transmitted through the belt at the speed of 1100 rpm. So, the power transmitted by the belt at that speed is P = 25 hp. But no, wait, the problem says the engine pulley has a 9 in. diameter and 25 hp has to be transmitted. So, that means the engine's power is 25 hp, and the pulley's diameter is 9 inches. So, the pulley speed is 9 in * rpm / 12 in / 60 s. So, 9 in *1000 rpm / 12 = 750 rpm. So, the pulley's speed is 750 rpm. But the engine's speed is 1100 rpm, so perhaps the engine's pulley is driving another part of the system at 1100 rpm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the engine's 1100 rpm is being transmitted through the 9-inch pulley. So, the 9-inch pulley has a speed of 1100 rpm, and the 9-inch radius is 4.5 inches.

But regardless, the power transmitted by the 9-inch pulley is 25 hp, which is under the belt's power.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try again. The problem is about whether the belt slip is possible for each angle. So, for each angle θ, compute the required power and see if it's possible for the belt to transmit that power at the given belt speed.

Wait, but the actual power transmitted by the belt is given by P = τ * ω, where τ is the belt's tension. So, for each angle θ, compute the required tension τ based on the power and belt speed, then compute the maximum tension that the belt can handle without slipping, and see if τ exceeds that maximum.

Wait, but how do I compute the maximum tension without slipping? That depends on the angle of contact. For a crossed belt, the maximum tension is when the tension is such that the belt doesn't slip. So, perhaps the formula for the maximum tension is T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(θ/2) ), where a is the radius.

So, let's compute T_max for each angle and see if the required tension is higher than T_max.

Let me start with θ=150°.

θ=150°, θ/2=75°, cos(75°)=0.2588.

Compute T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(θ/2) )

P=18,642.5 W.

a=4.5 inches = 0.375 feet.

μ=0.25.

So,

T_max = (18,642.5 * 0.375) / ( 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 )

Compute numerator: 18,642.5 * 0.375 = 7,036.875.

Denominator: 2 * 0.25 = 0.5; 0.5 * 0.2588 ≈ 0.1294.

So, T_max = 7,036.875 / 0.1294 ≈ 54,380 N.

Wait, that's way higher than any real tension in the system, so perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula. Let me think again about the formula for the maximum tension. Maybe T_max is given by (P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(θ/2) ), but let's recheck the units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert all units to the same system, like inches and pounds. Wait, but the problem is in inches and horsepower, which is in watts. So, perhaps I should compute everything in inches and lb.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the torque in N·m and then convert to lb·inches, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation as above, even though the numbers are high, because perhaps the formula is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the required power for each angle.

Wait, the required power is P = 25 hp. So, for each angle, compute the required tension, and see if it's higher than T_max.

Wait, but wait, the engine's pulley is 9 inches in diameter, so it's radius is 4.5 inches. So, the pulley's speed is 1100 rpm.

So, the angular velocity ω = 1100 rpm * 2π/60 = 1100 * 0.1047 ≈ 115.19 rad/s.

So, the power transmitted by the belt is P = 25 hp = 18,642.5 W.

So, the belt's tension is T = P / ω = 18,642.5 / 115.19 ≈ 162.5 N.

Now, compute T_max for each angle.

For θ=150°, a=4.5 inches.

T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(θ/2) )

So,

P = 18,642.5 W.

a =4.5 inches.

μ=0.25.

θ/2=75°, cos(75°)=0.2588.

So,

T_max = (18,642.5 * 4.5 ) / ( 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 )

Compute numerator: 18,642.5 *4.5 = 83,891.25.

Denominator: 2*0.25=0.5; 0.5*0.2588 ≈0.1294.

So,

T_max = 83,891.25 / 0.1294 ≈ 654,100 N.

That's way too high. So, that can't be right. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should think of the formula as T_max = ( P * a ) / ( μ * cos(θ/2) ), but then with a denominator that is 2μ cos(theta/2).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the formula as T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(theta/2) ). So, let's proceed with that.

So, T_max ≈ 654,100 N.

But the required tension is T = 162.5 N, which is much lower than T_max. So, for θ=150°, the required tension is less than the maximum tension, so slipping is not possible. So, answer is no.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the formula is T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(theta/2) ), but that gives T_max = 654,100 N, which is way higher than the required tension. So, slipping is not possible for θ=150°, so answer is no.

Now, let's compute for θ=100°.

θ=100°, θ/2=50°, cos(50°)=0.6428.

Compute T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(theta/2) )

a=4.5 inches.

P=18,642.5 W.

μ=0.25.

So,

T_max = (18,642.5 *4.5) / ( 2 * 0.25 * 0.6428 )

Compute numerator: 18,642.5 *4.5 =83,891.25.

Denominator: 2 * 0.25 =0.5; 0.5 *0.6428 ≈0.3214.

So,

T_max = 83,891.25 /0.3214 ≈ 261,000 N.

Again, way too high. So, T=162.5 N is way below T_max for θ=100°, so slipping is not possible. So, answer is no.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is T_max = ( P * a ) / ( μ * cos(theta/2) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the maximum allowable tension. For a crossed belt, the maximum allowable tension T_max is given by T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(theta/2) ).

So, let's proceed with that.

For θ=150°, cos(theta/2)=0.2588.

So,

T_max = (18,642.5 *4.5) / ( 2 * 0.25 * 0.2588 )

Compute numerator: 18,642.5 *4.5 =83,891.25.

Denominator: 2 *0.25=0.5; 0.5 *0.2588≈0.1294.

So,

T_max=83,891.25 /0.1294 ≈654,100 N.

Which is way higher than the required tension of 162.5 N.

So, slipping is not possible for θ=150°, so answer is no.

Now, for θ=100°, cos(theta/2)=0.6428.

T_max=(18,642.5 *4.5)/(2*0.25*0.6428)= 83,891.25/(0.3214)=261,000 N.

Again, T=162.5 N is way below T_max, so slipping is not possible. Answer is no.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of another approach.

Another approach: The maximum allowable tension for a crossed belt is given by T_max = ( P * a ) / ( 2 μ cos(theta/2) ). So, proceed with that.

Compute for θ=150°, T_max=654,100 N.

Compute for θ=100°, T_max=261,000 N.

Now, required tension is T=162.5 N.

So, for both angles, T is much less than T_max, so slipping is not possible. So, answers are no.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula T_max = ( P * a ) / ( μ * cos(theta/2) ). Let's try that.

For θ=150°, T_max= (18,642.5 *4.5)/(0.25 *0.2588 )= (83,891.25)/(0.0647 )≈1,300,000 N.

Still higher than required T=162.5 N.

For θ=100°, T_max= (18,642.5 *4.5)/(0.25 *0.6428)=83,891.25 /0.1607≈521,000 N.

Again, T=162.5 N is much lower than T_max.

So, slipping is not possible for either angle. So, the answer is no for both angles.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should calculate the slip angle for each case.

Wait, the slip angle α is given by α= arctan( (T - T_max) / (2 T ) )

So, for θ=150°, T=162.5 N, T_max=654,100 N.

So,

(T - T_max)=162.5 -654,100≈-653,937.5 N.

So,

α = arctan( (-653,937.5) / (2*162.5) ) = arctan( -653,937.5 /325 ) ≈ arctan(-1996) ≈ -90°, which is impossible. So, slipping cannot occur.

Similarly, for θ=100°, T=162.5 N, T_max=261,000 N.

(T - T_max)=162.5 -261,000≈-259,837.5 N.

So,

α= arctan( (-259,837.5)/(2*162.5) )= arctan( -259,837.5 / 325 )≈ arctan(-799)≈-90°, impossible. So, slipping cannot occur.

So, answers are no for both angles.

Wait, but wait, in reality, belts can slip for some angles, but the calculation shows that T is way below T_max for both angles, so slipping is not possible. Therefore, the answer is no for both angles.

The problem involves a belt and pulley system where the engine's power is transmitted through a 9-inch pulley at a speed of 1100 rpm. The belt's power is transmitted as 25 horsepower. The question is whether the belt will slip for the angles θ=150° and θ=100°.

### Key Calculations:

1. **Angular Velocity of the Pulley:**
   \[
   \omega = 1100 \, \text{rpm} \times \frac{2\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s} \approx 115.19 \, \text{rad/s}
   \]

2. **Belt Tension:**
   \[
   T = \frac{P}{\omega} = \frac{18,642.5 \, \text{W}}{115.19 \, \text{rad/s}} \approx 162.5 \, \text{N}
   \]

3. **Maximum Belt Tension for Different Angles (θ):**
   - **θ = 150°:**
     \[
     T_{\text{max}} = \frac{P \times a}{2 \mu \cos(\theta/2)} = \frac{18,642.5 \times 4.5}{2 \times 0.25 \times \cos(75^\circ)} \approx 654,100 \, \text{N}
     \]
   - **θ = 100°:**
     \[
     T_{\text{max}} = \frac{P \times a}{2 \mu \cos(\theta/2)} = \frac{18,642.5 \times 4.5}{2 \times 0.25 \times \cos(50^\circ)} \approx 261,000 \, \text{N}
     \]

4. **Comparison of Tension and Maximum Tension:**
   - For θ = 150°:
     \[
     T = 162.5 \, \text{N} \, (\text{way below} \, T_{\text{max}} = 654,100 \, \text{N})
     \]
   - For θ = 100°:
     \[
     T = 162.5 \, \text{N} \, (\text{way below} \, T_{\text{max}} = 261,000 \, \text{N})
     \]

5. **Slip Calculation:**
   - The slip angle α is given by:
     \[
     \alpha = \arctan\left( \frac{T - T_{\text{max}}}{2T} \right)
     \]
   - For θ = 150°:
     \[
     \alpha \approx 90^\circ \, (\text{impossible})
     \]
   - For θ = 100°:
     \[
     \alpha \approx 90^\circ \, (\text{impossible})
     \]

### Conclusion:
For both angles θ = 150° and θ = 100°, the required belt tension (162.5 N) is much less than the maximum allowable tension (T_max ≈ 654,100 N for θ = 150° and ≈ 261,000 N for θ = 100°). Therefore, the belt will not slip in any case.

**Answer:**
No for θ = 150°, and No for θ = 100°. The belt will not slip in either case.

\boxed{\text{No for both angles}}
