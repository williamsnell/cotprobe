Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this exchange rate problem. Let's see. The question is about a situation where an American firm sells machinery to a British firm for $40,000. I need to describe the flow of money, considering the exchange rate is $2 = £1.

Hmm, let's break this down. The American firm is selling to the British firm. So in the US dollars, they're getting $40,000. But the British firm is going to pay in pounds, right? Because they're the buyer.

Wait, but exchange rates are about how much one currency is worth in another. So $2 equals £1. That means that the British pound is weaker than the US dollar here. So when the American firm sells to the British, they're getting pounds, but in exchange for dollars?

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The American firm is the seller, and the British is the buyer. So the American firm is selling to the British, so they get paid in pounds. But the exchange rate is $2 = £1. So for every £1, the American gets $2.

But in this scenario, the British firm is paying in pounds. So the American firm sells for £20,000 because 40k divided by 2 is 20k. Wait, no. Wait, the exchange is $2 per £1. So £1 is worth $2. So if the American firm sells for $40,000, how much is that in pounds?

Wait, no. Wait, the exchange rate is $2 = £1. So to convert $40,000 to pounds, you divide by 2. So 40k / 2 = 20k. So the American firm receives £20,000 from the British importer. Wait, but wait—maybe I'm getting it backwards. Because if the American is selling to the British, the British has to pay in pounds. So the American is selling for $40k, but the exchange rate is $2 per £1, which means that for every pound, the American gets $2.

So, the British firm would pay the American $20,000 (since £20k * $2 per £1 = $40k). So the American gets £20k in return. So the flow is American exports £20k to the British importers.

Looking at the options, option C says the British importer pays $20,000 to the American exporter. Wait, that can't be right because the American is selling to the British. So the British is paying $20k. So the flow is the American getting £20k from the British. So, the American is the exporter, the British is the importer.

Wait, the problem is phrased as "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the flow of money is that the British importer pays the American exporter. So the American receives pounds from the British.

Wait, but the options are about what each party pays or receives. Let me list the options again.

Option C says the British importer pays $20,000 to the American exporter. That would mean the British is paying the American a dollar amount. But according to the exchange rate, $40k is £20k. So the American gets £20k in exchange for $40k. But the question is about the flow of money: who pays what.

So, the British is paying the American. So the British is the buyer. So the American is selling, so the British is paying their payment.

So, the British importer pays $20,000 to the American exporter. So that's option C.

Wait, but another way: the American is selling for $40k, but the exchange rate is $2 per £1. So the American gets £20k. So the flow is that the American receives £20k from the British. So the British is the buyer, paying $20k to the American exporter.

So the correct flow is: the British importer pays $20,000 to the American exporter. Which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the American is selling for $40k, and the exchange rate is $2 per £1, the British will pay in pounds. So $40k / $2 per £1 = £20k. So the British pay £20k. So, the American gets £20k. So the flow is the American gets £20k from the British.

So the flow is that the British payments are $20k to the American. So option C says that. So the answer is option C.

The correct flow of money is that the British importer pays the American exporter £20,000 to receive the machinery. This is because the exchange rate is $2 = £1, meaning the British firm pays the American firm in pounds. The American firm sells the machinery for $40,000, which translates to £20,000 for the British firm. Therefore, the British importer pays £20,000 to the American exporter.
