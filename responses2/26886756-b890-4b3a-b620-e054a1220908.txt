Okay, so I've got this question here about Jim and Joe being partners and their profit-sharing. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the question says they share profits and losses equally. Last year, their net profit was $28,400. The options are various amounts each partner gets. I need to find out what each partner's profit is.

Hmm, so since it's a profit-sharing equally, each partner gets half of the total profit. So I should divide the total profit by 2. Let me calculate that. 28,400 divided by 2 is... 14,200. Oh wait, but wait, let me make sure I'm doing that right. 28,400 divided by 2 is 14,200 each. That makes sense because if they split the profit equally, each should get half.

Looking at the options, option F is $12,000 each. Wait, that's not what I calculated. Did I miss something? Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe I should think again. Wait, the total is $28,400. So 28,400 / 2 is 14,200 each. So that's $14,200 per partner. But none of the options say that? Wait, looking again: Option F is $12,000 each. No, that's incorrect. Did I read the options correctly? Let me read them again.

Options:
A: $4,200 each
B: $7,200
C: $9,450 each
D: $10,800 each
E: $16,800 each
F: $12,000 each
G: $14,200 each
H: $18,933 each
I: $21,600
J: $28,400

Wait, I see now. Option G is $14,200 each. That's exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option G.

The correct answer is G, $14,200 each.

**Answer: G**
