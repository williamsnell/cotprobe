Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about effusion rates. Hmm, I remember that Graham's law deals with the rates at which gases effuse, right? But wait, isn't Graham's law more about the relationship between the rates of effusion and molar masses? Let me think... Oh right, Graham's law states that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So, the formula is r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where r is the rate, and M is molar mass.

The problem gives me the time for gas X to effuse and the same volume of oxygen. So, since the same volume effusing, and assuming the pressure and temperature are the same, the rates would be inversely proportional to their molar masses. Because effusion rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

Wait, wait. Let me get the details right. The time is inversely proportional to the effusion rate. So, if gas X takes more time than O2, its rate is slower. So, the time ratio is 112.2 / 84.7. Let me compute that: 112.2 divided by 84.7. Let me see, 84.7 times 1.3 is about 110. So, approximately 1.323. So, the rate ratio (r1/r2) is 1/1.323 ≈ 0.756. Because r is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So, r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1).

Wait, no. Let me get this right. Let me denote:

t1 = time for X, t2 = time for O2.

Since the same volume, and same pressure and temperature (assuming ideal gas), the rates r1 and r2 are inversely proportional to their molar masses.

r1 = volume/(rate at X) * effusion rate. Wait, no, effusion rate is volume per unit time. So, the rate is V/(time). So, for effusion, r1 = V/(t1), r2 = V/(t2). Since V is same, r1/r2 = t2/t1.

Wait, no, wait. If r is volume per time, then for same volume, time is inversely proportional to rate. So, r1 / r2 = (t2) / (t1). Because r1 = V/t1, r2 = V/t2. So, r1/r2 = t2/t1.

But according to Graham's law, r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1).

So, I can set up the equation: sqrt(M2/M1) = t2/t1.

Wait, wait, I think I got the ratio backwards. Let me clarify:

The formula for effusion rate is:

r ∝ 1 / sqrt(M)

So, r1/r2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So, if gas X effuses slower than oxygen, then rX < rO2.

So, tX (time for gas X) will be longer than tO2 because t is inversely proportional to r. So, t1 (for X) = (1 / rX) * V; t2 (for O2) = (1 / rO2) * V.

Thus, t1 / t2 = rO2 / rX.

But from Graham's law, rO2 / rX = sqrt(MX / MO2).

Wait, let's write it properly.

rX = k / sqrt(MX), rO2 = k / sqrt(MO2).

So, rX / rO2 = sqrt(MO2 / MX).

Which implies that t1/t2 = (rO2 / rX) = sqrt(MO2 / MX).

Wait, no, let's get that right.

t1 = V / rX,

t2 = V / rO2,

So, t1 / t2 = (rO2) / (rX).

But from Graham's law, (rO2)/(rX) = sqrt(MX / MO2).

So,

t1 / t2 = sqrt(MX / M_O2).

So,

sqrt(MX / 32) = t1/t2.

Wait, M_O2 is 32 (since O is 16, O2 is 32).

So, t1/t2 = sqrt(MX /32)

We have t1=112.2, t2=84.7.

So, t1/t2 = 112.2 /84.7 ≈ 1.323.

So,

1.323 = sqrt( MX /32 )

Squaring both sides,

(1.323)^2 = MX /32.

1.323 squared is approximately (1.3)^2 is 1.69, but 1.323^2 is:

1.323 * 1.323:

Let me compute 1.323 * 1.323.

1.3 * 1.3 is 1.69.

1.3 * 0.023 is 0.0299.

0.023 *1.3 is 0.0299.

0.023*0.023=0.000529.

Wait, perhaps a better way:

(1.323)^2 = (1.3 + 0.023)^2 = (1.3)^2 + 2*(1.3)*(0.023) + (0.023)^2.

1.69 + 0.0598 + 0.000529 ≈ 1.69 + 0.0598= 1.7498 + 0.000529 ≈ 1.7503.

So approximately 1.7503.

So,

1.7503 = MX /32.

So, MX = 32 * 1.7503 ≈ 56.01.

Looking at the options, option H is 56.2 amu, option D is 44.8. So, H is around 56.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio of times.

Wait, let me recheck t1/t2.

Wait, t1 is time for X, which is longer than t2 for O2.

So, t1/t2 = 112.2 /84.7 ≈ 1.323.

So, (sqrt(MX/32)) = t1/t2 = 1.323.

So, squaring 1.323 gives us (1.323)^2 = 1.750.

So, MX = 32 * 1.750 ≈ 56.01.

Looking back at the options: option H is 56.2, which is approximately 56.01. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me recheck all calculations.

Wait, maybe I should compute 112.2 divided by 84.7.

112.2 / 84.7 = let me compute that.

84.7 * 1.3 = 110.11. 112.2 - 110.11 = 2.09. So 2.09 /84.7 ≈ 0.0247. So total is 1.3 + 0.0247 ≈ 1.3247.

So, 1.3247.

So, 1.3247 squared is:

Let me calculate 1.3247 * 1.3247:

1.3 * 1.3 = 1.69.

1.3 * 0.0247 = 0.03211.

0.0247 *1.3 = same as above, 0.03211.

0.0247 * 0.0247 ≈ 0.00061.

Add them all:

1.69 + 0.03211 + 0.03211 + 0.00061 ≈ 1.69 + 0.06422 + 0.00061 = 1.75483.

So, approximately 1.7548.

So, MX = 32 * 1.7548 ≈ 56.15 amu.

Looking at options, option H is 56.2 amu. Option D is 44.8.

So the correct answer would be 56.2, which is option H.

Wait, but why is the time for gas X 112.2, which is longer, so Mx is smaller. Because if a gas takes longer to effuse, its molar mass is smaller. So O2 has a molar mass of 32, and X is 56, which is bigger, so time is longer. So that makes sense.

So, the answer should be option H:56.2 amu.

To determine the molecular weight of gas X, we use Graham's law of effusion, which states that the rate of effusion (and thus the time for effusion) is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas. The formula derived from this law is:

\[
\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_X}{M_{\text{O}_2}}
\]

Where:
- \( t_1 = 112.2 \, \text{s} \) (time for gas X),
- \( t_2 = 84.7 \, \text{s} \) (time for oxygen),
- \( M_{\text{O}_2} = 32 \, \text{amu} \) (molar mass of oxygen),
- \( M_X \) is the molar mass of gas X.

### Step 1: Calculate the ratio of times
\[
\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \frac{112.2}{84.7} \approx 1.323
\]

### Step 2: Square the ratio to find the mass ratio
\[
\left(\frac{t_1}{t_2}\right)^2 = (1.323)^2 \approx 1.7503
\]

### Step 3: Relate the mass ratio to the molar masses
\[
\frac{M_X}{M_{\text{O}_2}} = 1.7503 \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_X = M_{\text{O}_2} \cdot 1.7503
\]

### Step 4: Substitute the molar mass of oxygen
\[
M_X = 32 \cdot 1.7503 \approx 56.01 \, \text{amu}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated molecular weight of gas X is approximately \( 56.01 \, \text{amu} \), which corresponds to option **H: 56.2 amu**.
