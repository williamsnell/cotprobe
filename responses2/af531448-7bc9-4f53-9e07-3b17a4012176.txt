Okay, so I have this logic question here, and I need to figure out the best English interpretation of the given proposition. Let me read it again carefully.

The proposition is: ∀x [Ax ⊃ (∃y)(Hy ∧ Bxy)].

Breaking that down, Ax means x is an apartment. Hx means x is a house. Bxy means x is bigger than y. So the entire statement is saying that for every x that is an apartment, there exists some y that is a house and x is bigger than y.

Hmm, so for any apartment, there's at least one house it's bigger than. Wait, no, because Bxy is x bigger than y, not y bigger than x. So if x is an apartment, then there's a house that x is bigger than. So that would mean that every apartment is bigger than some house, but not necessarily all houses.

Now, let's look at the answer choices. They're all different ways of translating this into English. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Some house is smaller than every apartment. Wait, that's the opposite of what the proposition says. The proposition says every apartment is bigger than some house, so A would be saying every house is smaller than all apartments. That doesn't match.

Option B: Every house is bigger than some apartment. That would mean for every house, there's an apartment that it's bigger than. But the original proposition is about apartments being bigger than houses. So B is saying Hx > some Ax, but the actual proposition is Ax > some Hx. So B is the opposite.

Option C: Some apartments are bigger than all houses. Wait, that doesn't fit either. The proposition says that for every apartment, there's a house it's bigger than. So it's not that apartments are bigger than all houses, but that each has a house below it. So C would mean all apartments are bigger than every house, which is not what it's saying.

Option D: Some apartments are smaller than all houses. No, that's not the case either. The proposition says that each apartment is bigger than at least one house, not that it's smaller than all.

Option E: Some house is bigger than every apartment. That's not right. The original says every apartment is bigger than some house. So E would be saying some house is bigger than all apartments, which is the opposite.

Option F: Every apartment is bigger than some house. Hmm, that sounds similar to what we thought earlier. The proposition says every apartment has a house it's bigger than, so F says that every apartment is bigger than some house. That's exactly what the original proposition states.

Wait, so F is correct. Let me confirm. The proposition is ∀x (Ax → ∃y (Hy ∧ Bxy) ), which is "for all x, if x is an apartment, then there exists a y (a house) such that x is bigger than y." So F is the same as that, just phrased differently.

But wait, looking again, the options are options A to J, and option F says "Every apartment is bigger than some house." That's exactly the same as the original proposition. So F is correct.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The original proposition is ∀x (Ax → ∃y Hxy ∧ Bxy). So for every x that is an apartment, there exists a y that is a house and x is bigger than y. So F says for every x (if x is an apartment, then there exists a y (house) such that x is bigger than y). So F is a direct translation. So F is correct.

Wait, but another way to look at it: The original proposition is saying that all apartments are bigger than at least one house. Because for each apartment, there's at least one house it's bigger than. So F is correct.

But wait, the question is about the best English interpretation. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, option F says "Every apartment is bigger than some house." That's exactly what the proposition is saying. So F is correct.

Wait, but another thought: The way the proposition is structured, it's using Bxy as x being bigger than y. So Ax → ∃y (Hy ∧ Bxy). So for each apartment, there's a house that it's bigger than. So for each apartment, there's at least one house that it's bigger than. So F says every apartment is bigger than some house. That's the same as what the proposition says. So F is correct.

Wait, but I thought option B was correct earlier but that was a mistake. Let me review all the options again.

Option B: Every house is bigger than some apartment. That would mean for every house, there's an apartment it's bigger than. But the proposition is that every apartment is bigger than some house. So their structures are different. So B is incorrect.

So the correct answer is F.

The correct interpretation of the proposition is that every apartment is bigger than some house, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
