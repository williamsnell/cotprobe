Okay, I've got this problem here about calculating the mass of oxygen in a cylinder. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on the ideal gas law, but I think I can work through it.

So, the problem states: A cylinder contains oxygen at 10 atm pressure, 300 K temperature, and a volume of 10 liters. We need to find the mass of the oxygen.

I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Right, where P is pressure, V volume, n moles, R the gas constant, and T temperature. 

Wait, but I don't know the number of moles (n) yet. Oh yeah, I can rearrange the equation to find n. So n = PV/(RT). Right, that makes sense.

But wait, what units do I have here? The pressure is given in atm, volume in liters? Oh, right, because the gas constant R is often used with pressure in atm and volume in liters when the temperature is in Kelvin. So R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) if I remember correctly.

So, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:
P = 10 atm
V = 10 L
T = 300 K
R = 0.0821

So, n = (10 atm * 10 L) / (0.0821 * 300 K)

Calculating the numerator: 10 * 10 = 100.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 300 = let me compute that. 0.0821 * 300 is 24.63.

Wait, 300 * 0.08 is 24, 300 * 0.0021 is 0.63, so total 24.63.

So n = 100 / 24.63 ≈ let's see, 100 ÷ 24.63 is about 4.063 mol.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit unsure about the exact division. Let me do it more accurately.

24.63 * 4 = 98.52. So 4 mol gives 98.52. 100 -98.52 = 1.48 left. So 1.48 / 24.63 ≈ 0.0602 mol. So total n ≈4.0602 mol.

So about 4.063 moles.

Now, to find the mass. Oh right, mass is moles multiplied by molar mass. The molar mass of oxygen (O2) is 32 g/mol. Because O has a molar mass of 16 g/mol, so O2 is 32 g/mol.

So, mass = n * M = 4.063 mol * 32 g/mol = let's compute that.

4 * 32 = 128. 0.063 *32=2.016. So 128 +2.016=130.016 grams.

Looking at the options, option G is 130.08 grams. Hmm, that's close. Oh wait, did I do the calculation correctly?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate n first.

n = PV/(RT) = (10 atm * 10 L) / (0.0821 * 300)

10 *10=100.

0.0821 *300 = 24.63.

100 /24.63 ≈ 4.063 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol (O is 16 each, so two makes 32).

So mass = 4.063 *32.

Let me compute that accurately.

4 *32 =128

0.063 *32 = 2.016.

So 128 +2.016 = 130.016 grams.

The options are:

A:100, B:120, C:150, D:160, E:125, F:140, G:130.08, H:170, I:110.5, J:90.

So 130.016 is approximately 130.02, which rounds to 130.08 grams? Wait, no, 130.016 is about 130.02, which is closer to 130.02, but the option G is 130.08. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the R value. Let me check. Oh wait, sometimes R is taken as 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, but sometimes as 8.314 J/(mol·K). No, no, in this case, since the pressure is in atm and volume in liters, R is 0.0821.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for R. Let's try that. Oh, 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K) is the more precise value. Let me recalculate.

R = 0.082057

V=10, P=10, T=300.

n = (10 *10)/(0.082057 *300) = 100/(24.6171) → approximately 4.063 mol.

Wait, 0.082057 *300= 24.6171.

Now, 100/24.6171 ≈ 4.063 mol.

Hmm, same as before.

So, mass is 4.063 *32 = 130.016 grams.

Looking at the options, the closest is G:130.08. Oh wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the division.

Wait, let me compute 100 /24.6171 more accurately.

24.6171 * 4 = 98.4684.

100 -98.4684 = 1.5316.

So 1.5316 /24.6171 ≈ 0.0623.

So total n ≈4.0623 mol.

So, 4.0623 *32 = ?

4 *32=128.

0.0623 *32 = 1.9936.

So 128 +1.9936 = 129.9936 grams. Approximately 130 grams.

But the option G is 130.08, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in R? No, R is 0.0821 maybe in the problem, but perhaps I should use 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K). So that shouldn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct R value. Let me double-check.

Another approach: 1 mole of gas at STP (0°C, 1 atm) occupies 22.4 liters. But in this case, the temperature is 300 K (which is higher than 0°C, so pressure would be higher than 1 atm). So, perhaps the volume is 10 liters, which is less than 22.4, so pressure would be higher, but in our case, pressure is 10 atm. Hmm, perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Wait, another way to compute: Using R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 * (1 L·atm)/(mol·K) / (24.789 L·atm/J) → 8.314 /24.789 ≈ 0.333 L·atm/(mol·K). Wait, that doesn't make sense because if R is 8.314, then 8.314/24.789 is about 0.333 L·atm/(mol·K). But earlier, I used 0.0821, which is correct because 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) is the right value for ideal gas law in those units.

Another way: Let me compute 10 atm * 10 L = 100 atm·L.

RT = 0.0821 *300 =24.63 atm·L/(mol).

So n= 100 /24.63 → let me compute 24.63 *4=98.52. 100-98.52=1.48. So 1.48 /24.63 = approx 0.0602. So 4.0602 mol.

Molar mass O2 is 32 g/mol. So 4.0602 *32 = ?

Compute 4*32=128.

0.0602 *32 = 1.9264.

Total 128 +1.9264 = 129.9264 grams.

Wait, that's 129.9264 grams, which is approximately 129.93 grams. That's very close to 130 grams. So, looking at the options, the closest is option G: 130.08 grams. Hmm, but that's a bit higher. Why?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the division. Let me compute 100 /24.63 more accurately.

Compute 24.63 * 4.063 = ?

Wait, 4.063 *24.63 → Let's compute 4 *24.63=98.52, 0.063*24.63= approx 1.555. So 98.52 +1.555=100.075. Hmm, which is a bit over 100. Because 4.063 *24.63 is 100.075, which is a bit higher than 100. So perhaps 4.063 is a little high. So 4.063 would mean n=4.063, but the actual n would be a bit less than that, because 24.63 * n =100, so n=100/24.63≈4.063.

Wait, but 4.063 *24.63 is 100.075, which is larger than 100, so perhaps n is less than 4.063. So maybe the precise n is a little less.

But wait, why are my answer choices not matching exactly? Let me recheck the options. Oh, the options are:

A: 100 grams

B:120

C:150

D:160

E:125

F:140

G:130.08

H:170

I:110.5

J:90.

So G is 130.08, which is very close to 129.926.

So perhaps the correct answer is G: 130.08 grams.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

n= PV/(RT) = (10 * 10)/(0.0821 *300) = 100/(24.63) = approximately 4.063 mol.

Mass = 4.063 *32 = ?

4.063 *32. Let's compute 4 *32 =128.

0.063 *32 = 2.016.

So 128 +2.016=130.016 grams. So 130.016 grams is the mass.

Looking at the options, that's very close to G:130.08. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.063 is 63/1000. So 32 * 63/1000 = (32*63)/1000. 32*60=1920, 32*3=96 → 2016. 2016/1000=2.016.

So 130.016 grams. So the closest option is G:130.08 grams.

But wait, why is option G 130.08? Maybe the precise calculation should give a slight difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct R value. Let me compute using R=8.314 J/(mol·K):

PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT)

P=10 atm, V=10 L, T=300 K.

n = (10 atm * 10 L) / (8.314 *300 K) → 100 / (2494.2) → approx 0.0401 mol.

Mass would be 0.0401 *32 = 1.283 grams. But that can't be right because that's way lower than any option. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in R's value. Oh wait, wait, no, the question says the volume is 10 liters, which is 10 L. So when R is 8.314, which is for J/(mol·K), the units are correct.

Wait, 8.314 J/(mol·K) → 8.314 L·atm/(mol·K) as well because 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J, but for these units, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So I think earlier approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the initial setup is correct.

Wait, another thing: Is the cylinder's pressure in atm or in another unit? The question says 10 atm, so correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is G.130.08 grams, but let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the n.

Wait, let me compute n = 10 *10 / (0.0821 *300) = 100/24.63 ≈4.063 mol.

M=4.063 *32 =130.016 grams.

So the correct option is G:130.08 g.
</think>

To determine the mass of oxygen in the cylinder, the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), is used. Rearranging for \( n \), the number of moles, gives:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( P = 10 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( V = 10 \, \text{L} \)
- \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( n \)
Substitute the values into the equation:

\[
n = \frac{(10 \, \text{atm})(10 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(300 \, \text{K})}
\]

\[
n = \frac{100}{24.63} \approx 4.063 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of oxygen
The molar mass of oxygen (\( O_2 \)) is \( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \). The mass is given by:

\[
\text{Mass} = n \cdot M = 4.063 \, \text{mol} \cdot 32 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

\[
\text{Mass} = 130.016 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated mass is approximately \( 130.016 \, \text{g} \), which is closest to option **G: 130.08 grams**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.
