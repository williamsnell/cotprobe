Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Oh right, a chemist is making chlorine gas using MnO₂ and HCl. The reaction is MnO₂ + 4HCl → MnCl₂ + 2H₂O + Cl₂↑. The question is, if he uses 100 grams of MnO₂, what's the maximum volume of Cl₂ he can get at STP. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I think I need to find out how much Cl₂ is produced from 100 grams of MnO₂, then convert that to volume at STP. Right, because at STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So first, I'll calculate the moles of MnO₂, then use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find moles of Cl₂, and then convert moles to liters.

But wait, what's the molar mass of MnO₂? Mn is about 55 g/mol, O is 16 each. So MnO₂ is 55 + 2(16) =87 g/mol. Oh wait, wait, no, wait, 54.94 for Mn is about 55. So 55 + 32 = 87 g/mol. So 100 grams would be 100 /87 ≈1.149 moles of MnO₂.

Now, looking at the reaction, the mole ratio between MnO₂ and Cl₂ is 1:1. So each mole of MnO₂ produces one mole of Cl₂. So moles of Cl₂ = moles of MnO₂ = approximately 1.149 moles.

At STP, 1 mole is 22.4 liters. So 1.149 *22.4 = let's calculate. 1.149 *22.4. Hmm, 22.4 *1 is 22.4, 22.4 *0.149. 0.149 *22.4 is about 3.3376. So total is 22.4 +3.3376=25.7376 liters. Which rounds to about 25.7 liters. Looking at the options, option G says 25.8 liters. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, wait, did I calculate the molar mass correctly? MnO₂ is Mn + 2 O. Mn is approximately 54.94, O is 16. So 54.94 + 32 = 86.94 g/mol. So 100 g / 86.94 ≈1.1505 moles. So about the same as before. So correction: 1.1505 *22.4= 1.1505 *22.4.

Let me compute that accurately. 1.1505 *22.4. 22.4 *1=22.4. 22.4 *0.1505: Let me break it down. 0.1 is 2.24, 0.05 is 1.12, 0.0005 is 0.0112. So 2.24 +1.12=3.36, plus 0.0112 is 3.3712. So total is 22.4 +3.3712=25.7712 liters. So approximately 25.8 liters. So G is correct.

To determine the maximum volume of chlorine gas (Cl₂) produced at STP when 100 g of MnO₂ is used, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the molar mass of MnO₂**:  
   - Mn: 55 g/mol  
   - O: 16 g/mol (×2)  
   - Total molar mass = 55 + 32 = **87 g/mol**.

2. **Determine the moles of MnO₂**:  
   - Moles of MnO₂ = mass / molar mass = 100 g / 87 g/mol ≈ **1.149 moles**.

3. **Use the stoichiometry of the reaction**:  
   The reaction is MnO₂ + 4HCl → MnCl₂ + 2H₂O + Cl₂↑, with a 1:1 mole ratio between MnO₂ and Cl₂.  
   - Moles of Cl₂ produced = moles of MnO₂ = **1.149 moles**.

4. **Convert moles of Cl₂ to volume at STP**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters.  
   - Volume of Cl₂ = moles × 22.4 L/mol = 1.149 × 22.4 ≈ **25.7 liters**.

5. **Select the closest option**:  
   The closest value to 25.7 liters is **25.8 liters**, which corresponds to option G.

ANSWER: G
