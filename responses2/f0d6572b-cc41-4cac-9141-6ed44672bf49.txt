Okay, so I've got this question here about how many positive and negative integers 12 is a multiple of. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I'll try to remember.

Wait, the question is asking for both positive and negative integers. So, 12 being a multiple means that there's some integer, positive or negative, that when multiplied by it gives 12. Like, if 12 is a multiple of n, then 12 = n * k, where k is an integer.

Right, so I need to find all integers n such that 12 is a multiple of n. That includes both positive and negative divisors of 12.

Let me list the positive divisors first. The positive divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. That's six numbers.

Now, for negative integers, each positive divisor has a corresponding negative one. So, -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12. That's another six numbers. So in total, that's 12 integers.

Wait, but wait. The question says "positive and negative integers" but does it include zero? Oh, no, because any number multiplied by zero would be zero, not 12. So zero is not a multiple here. So we don't include it.

So that's 12 integers in total. Let me check if I've missed anything. 12's divisors are indeed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and their negatives. That makes 12 numbers.

Looking at the options, let me see what's available. Option F is 12, which matches what I've calculated. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F.

F: 12
