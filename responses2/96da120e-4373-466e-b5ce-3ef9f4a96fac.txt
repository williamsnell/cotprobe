Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat: if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not? During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, "Logan is the friend of the white man." I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.
â€”Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Logan from the given passage. Let me see. The question is asking which option best expresses Logan's perspective based on the passage provided.

First, I need to read the passage carefully. The passage is about Logan, an Indian leader from 1774. He's appealing to white men, but there's a lot of tension. He says he was a friend to the white men, which shows that he's a love for the white population. But then, the colonel Cresap kills all the relations of Logan, including his women and children, and it's even because he's cold and didn't give him meat or a meal. That's pretty harsh.

He then says he's seeking revenge for the violence he's seen. He killed many and fully glutted his vengeance. The passage also states that Logan has "fullly glutted his blood" meaning his body was fully dug out, showing he's not a victim. His country rejoices in peace, but he doesn't feel fear. Logan never felt fear, so there's no one to mourn for him. He's not seeking revenge, but rather is expressing his anger and then his determination to stop the war.

Looking at the options:

A: Logan believes Indians need to find strength in unity. Hmm, the passage doesn't say much about unity. It's more about the loss of innocence and the harsh killing. So, maybe A isn't the focus.

B: Feeling a sense of superiority over white settlers. Logan is a friend, not superior. He's more of a neutral or even supportive figure, though he does express anger.

C: Power of peaceful negotiation. The passage doesn't discuss negotiation; it's more about violence and revenge. So probably not C.

D: Expanding British settlements must be stopped. Logan is a colonizer, but the passage doesn't suggest he's against expansion. It's more about the harsh treatment of himself and his family.

E: Regrets seeking revenge. The passage says he seeks it, but it's not a sentiment that's expressed. It's more about the consequences of his actions.

F: Laments family loss. The passage mentions his family being killed, but the focus is on his own actions and feelings, not his family's death.

G: Wants peaceful coexistence. The passage doesn't support peaceful coexistence; in fact, Logan's narrative shows he's not even willing to accept his own suffering.

H: Opposes a new peace treaty. Again, the passage doesn't talk about a new treaty; it's more about the harsh treatment of himself and his family.

I: Seeks to incite war. The passage says he seeks revenge, which is more about self-defense than inciting war. So maybe this is the right answer.

Wait, but the options are from A to H, and the passage doesn't mention incitement of war. So it's more about his feelings of being weak and wanting to protect himself from the harsh reality.

Looking back, the passage says Logan "called on me for revenge." So he's seeking it as a form of self-defense. So that would support option I. But wait, the options list I as an option, but looking again, I is "Logan seeks to incite war against the white settlers." But the passage doesn't say he incites war. He's more about revenge for his own actions.

Wait, the passage says he has killed many and glutted his vengeance, but he didn't seek to incite war. So maybe the best fit is option I, but the passage doesn't explicitly say that. Or perhaps another option is better.

Wait, let's read the question again. The question is about Logan's perspective. He's appealing to white men, but in the passage, the focus is on his own actions and his feelings. So looking for which option best reflects his feelings.

Option E is about seeking revenge. The passage says he seeks it, but the question is about expressing his perspective. So E is not the perspective; it's more of a cause. The options are about his perspective, not his actions.

Wait, the options are about Logan's perspective, not his actions. So E is about seeking revenge, but the passage doesn't say he's seeking it as a cause. He's more about his anger and desire to protect himself.

Looking again, the passage says Logan "called on me for revenge." So he's seeking revenge, which is a form of self-defense. So the option that best captures this is I: seeking to incite war against white settlers. But wait, the passage says he "killed many" and "glutted his vengeance." He's not inciting war but rather seeking revenge.

Wait, but the options may not capture the direct action but the underlying perspective. So perhaps option I is not the best. Alternatively, option E is about seeking revenge as a cause, but the passage doesn't say he's seeking it that way.

Wait, perhaps the passage doesn't talk about inciting war. Let me think again. The options are about Logan's perspective, not about his actions. So the options are about his feelings or beliefs. Let me re-read the passage.

The passage says: "Logan was so loved by the whites that their men pointed as they passed, and said, 'Logan is the friend of the white man.'" So Logan is a friend, but also he's a colonizer. Then, during the war, he was idle, advocate for peace, and then he sought revenge, killing his family, etc.

So his perspective is that he's a friend to white settlers, but he's also a defender of his own rights, which include his family. But the passage doesn't mention him opposing war, but he does express anger and wants to protect himself.

Looking at the options, option E is about seeking revenge. The passage says he sought it, but the options are about his perspective. So perhaps the best answer is E: he laments his family's loss, but that's not directly an option. Wait, the options are given as statements about his perspective.

The options are:

E: Regrets seeking revenge.

Wait, the passage says he "called on me for revenge." So he's seeking it as a form of self-defense. So the best option would be E, but the passage says he seeks it, but the options are about his perspective. So perhaps none of the options directly talks about his anger and self-defense. Oh, but the options are phrased as statements about his perspective, not his actions.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

E: Regrets seeking revenge.

But the passage says he seeks it, not that he regrets it. So perhaps E is about his action, not his perspective. The perspective is about his feelings.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because the passage says he seeks revenge, implying that he's seeking it as a cause, not that he's expressing it as a reflection of his feelings. The passage doesn't explicitly state that he's expressing anger, but the question is about Logan's perspective, which is more about his feelings.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options directly capture his anger and self-defense. But the options are about his perspective, so the options are what he believes.

Looking again, the passage says Logan is a friend to white settlers. So in terms of his perspective, perhaps he's more about the cause of peace, not anger. So the options about his feelings: which one best.

Looking at option E: "Logan laments the loss of his family." The passage says he killed his family, but the loss is not expressed as a direct expression of anger. So perhaps he's expressing anger as a form of self-defense, which is a different perspective.

Looking again, the options are:

E: Regrets seeking revenge.

H: Opposes a new peace treaty.

Wait, the passage doesn't mention a new treaty; it's more about the harsh treatment. So perhaps the best answer is E, but the passage doesn't say he's expressing anger. Alternatively, none of the options directly say about his anger.

Wait, the options are about Logan's perspective. The passage says he's seeking revenge, which is a form of self-defense. So perhaps the best answer is E: he laments seeking revenge. But the passage says he seeks it, not that he's expressing it.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: he laments the loss of his family, but that's not directly his perspective.

Alternatively, the options are about his feelings, not his actions. So the options are:

A: Strength in unity.

B: Superiority.

C: Peace over war.

D: Stop British expansion.

H: Oppose new treaty.

I: Incite war.

G: Peace with settlers.

Wait, the passage says Logan's country rejoices in peace but doesn't feel fear, so he's not seeking to stop the war. So options C and H may not be related.

Option E is seeking revenge, which is a form of self-defense. So perhaps the best answer is E: he regrets seeking revenge against the white settlers.

Wait, but the passage says he seeks it as a form of self-defense, not as a cause. So perhaps the best answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage doesn't express anger, only self-defense.

So, considering all, the best answer is E: he laments seeking revenge.

Wait, but the passage says he "killed many; he fully glutted his vengeance." The option E is about seeking it, not about his feelings. So perhaps the answer is E: he laments seeking revenge.

Wait, but the options are about his perspective, not his actions. So perhaps the best answer is E: he laments seeking revenge.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options directly reflect his anger or self-defense. So perhaps the best answer among the given is E.

But I think the passage says Logan seeks revenge, which is a form of self-defense. So that's his perspective, which is expressed as E.
</think>

The passage describes Logan as a colonizer who seeks revenge, which is a form of self-defense. His perspective is centered on his anger and determination to protect his family and rights, which is best captured by expressing his feelings about seeking revenge. 

Answer: E
