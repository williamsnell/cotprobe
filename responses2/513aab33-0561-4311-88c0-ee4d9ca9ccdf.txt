Okay, so I've got a question about a gas thermometer. Hmm, let me think. I remember that a gas thermometer measures temperature by the pressure of a gas. Oh right, because pressure and temperature are directly related when volume is constant, according to Charles's Law.

Wait, the question says it's a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer. So the volume doesn't change, right? So Charles's Law applies here. Charles's Law states that P1/T1 = P2/T2 when the volume is constant. But wait, temperatures in the law should be in Kelvin. Oh yeah, because 0 K is absolute zero.

The question says the gas is at the triple point of water. The triple point is 273.16 K, and it's 6.69 kPa pressure. So that's the pressure at 273.16 K.

The question is asking what pressure would indicate a temperature of 100.00 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, I need to convert that to Kelvin. So 100Â°C is 373.15 K, right? Because 273.15 + 100 is 373.15.

So using Charles's Law: P1/T1 = P2/T2. So P2 is the pressure at 373.15 K. P1 is 6.69 kPa at 273.16 K.

Calculating P2: P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1) = 6.69 kPa * (373.15 / 273.16).

Let me compute that. 373.15 divided by 273.16. Let me approximate that. 273 is about 273, and 373 is about 1.366 times that. Because 273 * 1.366 is about 373. So 373/273 = 1.366. So 6.69 kPa multiplied by 1.366.

Wait, let's do it more accurately. 373.15 divided by 273.16. Let me compute that. Let's see, 273.16 * 1.366 is approximately 373.15.

So 1.366 times 6.69. Let's compute that. 6 * 1.366 is 8.196, and 0.69*1.366 is about 0.946 (since 0.7 * 1.366 is 0.9562, so 0.69 is close to that). So 8.196 + 0.946 is about 9.142 kPa. Oh wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1.366 is a rough estimate. Let me compute 373.15 / 273.16 more precisely. So 273.16 goes into 373.15 about 1.366 times. Let me compute 273.16 * 1.366 = ?

Wait, 273.16 * 1.366:

First, 273.16 * 1 = 273.16.

273.16 * 0.3 = 81.948.

273.16 * 0.06 = 16.3896.

273.16 * 0.006 = 1.63896.

Adding those parts together: 273.16 + 81.948 = 355.108. Plus 16.3896 is 371.4976. Plus 1.63896 is 373.13656. Which is very close to 373.15. So yes, 1.366 is correct.

Now, 6.69 * 1.366. Let me compute that. 6*1.366 is 8.196, 0.69 * 1.366.

0.69 * 1 is 0.69.

0.69 * 0.366 is 0.69 * 0.3 is 0.207, 0.69 * 0.066 is about 0.04554. So 0.207 + 0.04554 = 0.25254.

So 0.69 * 1.366 is 0.69 + 0.25254 = 0.94254.

So total P2 is 8.196 + 0.94254 = 9.13854 kPa, approximately 9.14 kPa.

Looking at the options, option I is 9.14 kPa. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we use Charles's Law, which states that for a gas at constant volume, \( \frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2} \). The temperature must be in Kelvin. The given data includes:

- Triple point of water: \( P_1 = 6.69 \, \text{kPa} \), \( T_1 = 273.16 \, \text{K} \)
- Desired temperature: \( T_2 = 100.00^\circ \text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_2 = 6.69 \cdot \frac{373.15}{273.16}
\]

First, calculate the ratio \( \frac{373.15}{273.16} \approx 1.366 \). Then:

\[
P_2 = 6.69 \cdot 1.366 \approx 9.14 \, \text{kPa}
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is \( 9.14 \, \text{kPa} \), which corresponds to option I.
