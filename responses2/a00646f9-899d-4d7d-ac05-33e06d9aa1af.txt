Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting how many integers from -200 to 200 are congruent to 5 mod 13. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that congruent modulo a number means that when you divide the number by that modulus, the remainder is the same. So in this case, numbers that are congruent to 5 mod 13 leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 13.

First, I should figure out what range of numbers we're dealing with. The problem says from -200 to 200, inclusive. So that's 401 numbers in total. But I don't think I need the total; I need the count of numbers that fit the mod condition.

Let me think about the structure. Any number congruent to 5 mod 13 can be written as 13k + 5, where k is an integer. So I need to find all such numbers within the range from -200 to 200.

So I should find the smallest number in that range that is >= -200 and of the form 13k +5, and the largest number <=200 of the same form. Then, I can find how many terms are in this arithmetic sequence.

Wait, but how do I find k? Let me write the inequality:

-200 ≤ 13k +5 ≤ 200

So I can subtract 5 from all parts:

-205 ≤ 13k ≤ 195

Then divide all parts by 13:

-205 /13 ≤ k ≤ 195/13

Calculating those divisions:

-205 ÷13 is approximately -15.769… So the lower bound for k is -15.769. But k must be an integer, so the smallest integer k that is >= -15.769 is -15.

Similarly, 195 ÷13 is 15. So the upper bound is 15.

So k can be from -15 to 15, inclusive. Wait, but let me check if 13*(-15) +5 is within -200.

13*(-15) is -195, plus 5 is -190. That's within -200, so yes.

And 13*15 +5 is 195 +5 = 200, which is exactly the upper limit. So k can range from -15 to 15.

Now, how many integers is that? From -15 to 15 inclusive. Hmm, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b -a +1. But wait, when a is negative, I have to be careful.

Wait, from -15 to 15, that's 15 negative numbers, 15 positive, and zero. So 15 +15 +1 =31. So 31 numbers.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation.

From -15 to 15 inclusive. Let me count: -15 is the first, then -14, ..., down to 15. So the count is 15 + 15 +1 (since 0 is included). So that's 31 numbers.

But wait, I should confirm with another approach. Maybe plug in the values.

For k =15: 13*15 +5=195+5=200, which is within the range.

k=-15: 13*(-15) +5= -195 +5= -190, which is >=-200.

But wait, what if k is -16? Let's see: 13*(-16)= -208. So -208+5= -203, which is less than -200. So that's outside the range. So k can't be -16.

Similarly, k=16: 13*16=208. 208+5=213, which is beyond 200. So k can't be 16.

So yes, k ranges from -15 to 15, inclusive, which is 31 numbers.

Looking at the options, 31 is option D. So the answer should be D:31.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm missing some numbers or overcounted? Let me double-check.

Another way: The numbers congruent to 5 mod13 in this range form an arithmetic sequence: -190, -177, ..., 200. The first term is -190, the last is 200, common difference 13.

Number of terms is ((last - first)/d) +1. So (200 - (-190))/13 +1 = (390)/13 +1 = 30 +1=31.

Yes, that confirms it. So 31 numbers.

The numbers congruent to 5 mod 13 in the range from -200 to 200 form an arithmetic sequence starting at -190 and ending at 200, with a common difference of 13. To find the number of terms, we calculate ((200 - (-190))/13) + 1 = (390/13) + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31. 

Answer: D: 31

The answer is \boxed{D}.
