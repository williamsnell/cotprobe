Okay, so I have to figure out which option gives the most representative sample for a survey at a shopping mall. Let me think through each option. 

The question is asking for the most representative sample. So, a representative sample is one that accurately reflects the whole population, which in this case is all the people who shop at the mall. So the survey should include people from various demographics to give a fair picture.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Conducting the survey at one shoe store. Hmm, that's probably not representative because it's only for shoe buyers. People who shop there might have specific preferences or behaviors that don't represent the whole mall. It's a small group, so the sample is skewed.

Option B: Online survey targeting only mall's registered customers. Wait, but online surveys can sometimes miss people because they might not be on the internet, or they might not be registered. Also, if it's a specific time or place, it might not reach everyone. So this might not be representative either.

Option C: Conducting the survey at all clothing stores. If they choose all clothing stores, that's a broad range. But wait, clothing stores might have different demographics. For example, they might target people who like clothes but maybe not food or other shopping habits. So this could be a problem because the sample might not include people who don't shop at clothing stores or have different purchasing habits.

Option D: Conducting the survey only on weekends. That could be a problem because people might shop on weekdays, especially if they're working. The survey might miss the peak shopping times, leading to an underrepresentation of certain demographics, like younger people or those who shop more frequently on weekends.

Option E: Conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall. This seems like a good approach because it's a physical location where people typically come to shop. It's a good representation of the general mall population because most people go there for shopping regularly.

Option F: Conducting in the mall parking lot. This is a specific area where a lot of people park. It might not include people who use the mall for other reasons, like for classes or meetings. So the sample might not represent everyone who shops at the mall.

Option G: Conducting the survey at all shoe stores. Similar to option A, but here the shoes are part of the mall. So again, it's limited to shoe buyers, which isn't representative.

Option H: Conducting the survey a mile away from the mall. That's probably the same issue as option B. People might not be interested in the survey in that area, or the survey might not reach those who are nearby but might shop elsewhere.

Option I: Conducting the survey at one specific time of the day. Maybe if they do it at a certain time, like a weekday morning, it might capture more people than if they do it at night. But it could also miss people who shop later in the day, leading to a biased sample.

Option J: Conducting the survey at the mall's food court. The food court is a place where people eat, so maybe the survey might not capture people who shop for other reasons, like buying clothes or electronics. It could also include people who are at the food court because they're eating, not shopping.

So, going back to option E: the entrance. This is the most likely to represent the general mall population because it's where most people shop. The other options either target a specific group (A, G, J) or are not a physical location where people usually shop (B, D, F). 

Wait, but option G also targets shoe stores, which is a subset of all stores. So the best option is E because it uses a physical location where people commonly shop.

The most representative sample would be conducted at the mall's entrance (option E), as it is a physical location where people typically shop. This ensures a broad and accurate representation of the entire mall population.

Answer: E
