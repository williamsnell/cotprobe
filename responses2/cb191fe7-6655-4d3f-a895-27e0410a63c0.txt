Okay, so I've got this problem here about scale models. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the model of the park has a scale of 1.5 centimeters to 50 meters. And we need to find out what the distance between two trees, which are 150 meters apart in real life, would be on the model.

Alright, first, I remember that scales are ratios. So, 1.5 cm represents 50 meters. Wait, the problem gives the scale as 1.5 cm to 50 meters. So, that's a ratio of model to real. So, model distance is 1.5 cm for every 50 meters in reality.

The task is to find the model distance for 150 meters. So, I need to set up a proportion here. Let me write that down:

Model distance : Real distance = 1.5 cm : 50 m

So, if the real distance is 150 m, what's the model distance?

I can set up the equation as:

1.5 cm / 50 m = x cm / 150 m

Wait, or maybe I should think of it as model to real is 1.5 cm per 50 m. So, model distance is (1.5 cm / 50 m) multiplied by the real distance.

Let me compute that.

First, let's find out how many centimeters correspond to 1 meter. Since 1 m is 100 cm, 50 meters is 50 * 100 = 5000 cm.

So, 150 meters is 150 * 100 = 15,000 cm.

Now, the scale is 1.5 cm for 5000 cm. So, for 15,000 cm, how much model distance is that?

I can set up the proportion:

1.5 cm / 5000 cm = x cm / 15000 cm

Solving for x:

x = (1.5 cm * 15000 cm) / 5000 cm

Wait, that makes sense. Alternatively, I can think of scaling factor. The scale is 1.5 cm : 50 m, so the scaling factor is 1.5 cm per 50 m. Or, to find out how much 150 m is on the model, I can see how many times 50 m fits into 150 m. Let's see: 150 divided by 50 is 3. So, the model must be 3 times smaller.

Wait, no, wait. Because the scale is model to real. So, 1.5 cm is for 50 m. So, for 150 m, which is 3 times 50 m, the model distance is 3 times 1.5 cm. Let me compute that.

3 * 1.5 cm = 4.5 cm. Wait, that would be 4.5 cm. But let me check with the other method to make sure.

Wait, let me go back. The scale is 1.5 cm equals 50 m. So, to find x, which is the model distance for 150 m, I can set up a proportion.

x / 150 m = 1.5 cm / 50 m

So, solving for x:

x = (1.5 cm / 50 m) * 150 m

The meters cancel out, so:

x = (1.5 * 150) / 50

1.5 * 150 is 225. 225 divided by 50 is 4.5. So, x is 4.5 cm. Wait, but wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier thought.

Wait, I thought earlier that scaling factor was 3, but with that calculation, 4.5 cm. So, which one is correct? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let me think of it as the model is scaled down by a factor. The model is 1.5 cm for 50 m. So, the scale factor is 1.5 cm per 50 m. To find the model distance for 150 m, we can compute how much 150 m is in terms of model.

So, 50 m is 1.5 cm. So, 1 m is (1.5 cm) / 50 m = 0.03 cm/m. So, each meter on the real park is 0.03 cm on the model.

So, 150 m is 150 * 0.03 = 4.5 cm. So, that's the correct model distance. So, the model would show 4.5 cm between the two trees.

Looking at the options, option F is 4.5 cm. So, the answer should be F.

The model scale is 1.5 cm to 50 m, meaning 1.5 cm represents 50 meters. To find the model distance for 150 meters, we calculate the scaling factor: 150 m / 50 m = 3. Thus, the model distance is 1.5 cm * 3 = 4.5 cm.

Answer: F: 4.5 centimeters
