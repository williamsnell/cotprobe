Okay, so I've got this bond problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what I remember about bonds and interest rates.

The bond sells for $1,000, which I think means its face value is $1,000. The annual interest it pays is $80. So the coupon rate would be 80 divided by 1000, which is 8%, right? But wait, no, wait—because the problem is about the nominal and real interest rates. 

Now, the monetary authorities predict the price level will increase by 5% next year. Hmm, so the inflation rate is 5%. 

I remember there's something called the Fisher equation, which relates nominal interest rate, real interest rate, and inflation. The formula is usually something like (1 + nominal rate) = (1 + real rate) * (1 + inflation). Or maybe it's nominal rate = real rate + inflation + (real rate * inflation). I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think it's about how nominal rate is adjusted for inflation.

Wait, the real interest rate is the nominal rate minus inflation, but that's a simplified approach. Wait, I think the exact formula is (1 + r_nominal) = (1 + r_real) * (1 + i_inflation). Where i_inflation is the inflation rate.

So, given that, let's plug in the numbers. The bond pays $80 per year. So, the nominal interest rate is 8% because $80 is 8% of $1000. So r_nominal is 8%? Or is there more to it?

Wait, but the bond is priced at $1000, so if it's selling at par, then the coupon rate equals the yield to maturity. So the nominal interest rate is 8%, right? Because 8% of 1000 is 80.

But then, the problem is about the real interest rate. So I need to calculate that. The real interest rate is the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. So 8% - 5% is 3%. So the real interest rate is 3%.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct because sometimes people use approximation formulas. The Fisher equation says r_real ≈ r_nominal - i_inflation. So if that's the case, 8% -5% =3%, which would make option G correct.

Looking at the options, option G says nominal is 8%, real is 3%, which matches what I calculated.

Wait, but wait—could there be a mistake here? Because the bond's price is considered. Oh wait no, because the problem states the bond is selling for $1,000, which is par. So the coupon rate is 8%, and the real rate is 3% because the inflation rate is 5%. So correct.

Another thought: sometimes, the nominal rate could be higher or lower. Wait, wait, but the bond's coupon rate is 8%. Since the price is at par, the yield is 8% regardless of the expected inflation. Wait, but the question is about the real interest rate, which is adjusted for inflation.

So, the real interest rate is 8% minus 5%, which is 3%. So the real rate is 3%, the nominal rate is 8%. So the correct answer should be option G: nominal 8%, real 3%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is "Nominal interest rate is 8 percent per year, Real interest rate is 3 percent." So that's the right answer.

The bond sells for $1,000, meaning its face value is $1,000, and it pays an annual interest of $80. The nominal interest rate is therefore 8%, calculated as $80 / $1,000. The monetary authorities predict a 5% increase in the price level, indicating an inflation rate of 5%.

To calculate the real interest rate, we use the Fisher equation: 

\[
1 + r_{\text{nominal}} = (1 + r_{\text{real}}) \times (1 + i_{\text{inflation}})
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
1 + 0.08 = (1 + r_{\text{real}}) \times (1 + 0.05)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
1.08 = (1 + r_{\text{real}}) \times 1.05
\]

Dividing both sides by 1.05:

\[
r_{\text{real}} = \frac{1.08}{1.05} - 1 = 0.02857 \approx 2.857\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the real interest rate is approximately 3%.

Thus, the nominal interest rate is 8%, and the real interest rate is 3%. The correct answer is:

**G: Nominal interest rate is 8 percent per year, Real interest rate is 3 percent.**
