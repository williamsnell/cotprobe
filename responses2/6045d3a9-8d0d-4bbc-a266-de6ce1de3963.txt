Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about Aquinas and his examples of self-evident propositions. I need to figure out which of the options isn't one of his examples. Let me think.

First, I remember that Aquinas, especially in his Summa Theologica, discussed various propositions that are self-evident or self-justifying. These include things like the existence of God, the Trinity, the idea that the same thing can't be both affirmed and denied, and others like the Law of Sines in geometry.

Looking at the options:

A: "Man is a rational being." I think Aquinas didn't accept this as a self-evident. I remember something about his theological arguments, like the "first cause" argument, where he might have posited that rationality is a necessary thing, but this statement might be one of those he didn't accept as self-evident.

B: "All bachelors are unmarried." This seems like a basic categorical statement, like "All S are P." Categorical propositions are self-evident because they are about the category itself. So this is one of Aquinas' examples.

C: "Night follows day." This is a scientific fact, not necessarily self-evident. It depends on observation and understanding of cause and effect. So this might not be one he considered self-evident.

D: "The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees." Geometry is a self-evident truth, especially from Euclidean principles. So D is an example Aquinas would include.

E: "The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time." This is the principle of non-contradiction, which is self-evident in classical logic. So E is an example.

F: "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us." This is a moral or divine truth. I don't think Aquinas considered this as self-evident. Instead, he might have discussed divine necessity or the nature of God, but this seems more like imperative or interpretative than a self-evident axiom.

G: "A square has four sides." This is a geometric truth, self-evident. So G is an example.

H: "Every whole is greater than its part." This is a universal truth, self-evident. H is an example.

I: "Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another." This is the principle of substitution, self-evident. So I is an example.

J: "An effect depends on its cause." This is a cause-effect relationship, which is self-evident. So J would be an example.

Wait, looking back, option F is about the light of God's countenance being signed upon us. I thought Aquinas didn't consider this as self-evident. Instead, he might have talked about God's necessity or the nature of light being God's gift. So F is the answer because it's not one of his examples. The others are self-evident.

The correct answer is F: "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us." This is not an example of a self-evident proposition attributed to Aquinas.

**Answer: F**
