Okay, so I've got this question about strategies to reduce aggressive behavior in children. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking which strategy would be least effective at making kids less aggressive. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that reducing aggressive behavior is often about finding ways to stop kids from being aggressive in the first place. So the strategies should target the root cause of aggression, not just handle the behavior itself.

Option A is social skills training. I think that's a good one because teaching kids how to communicate, manage emotions, and handle situations can help them become less aggressive. It's about the child's internal processes, which might reduce aggressive behaviors.

Option B is encouraging competitive sports. Competitive play can definitely make children more aggressive because they're pushing each other to be better. That seems counterproductive. Positive reinforcement might help, but it's not effective if the child is already competitive. So maybe this is the least effective strategy.

Option C is exposure to a nonaggressive model. If kids see their peers or adults being nonaggressive, they might internalize that and develop a fear of aggression. This could be a powerful way to reduce aggressive behavior. So this strategy is probably effective.

Option D is opportunities for catharsis. Catharsis is a term I think I've heard before, like when someone goes through a difficult situation and feels happy again. It's a way to process emotions and reduce stress. Applying this to children, maybe it can help them cope with the stress of being around people who are aggressive. It might reduce aggressive behavior because they can process their feelings and stay calm.

So putting it all together. The least effective would be B, encouraging competitive sports. Because if kids are already competitive, this doesn't help; it might make them more aggressive. The other options are more about teaching them how to handle situations, which is better for reducing aggression.
