Question:

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39째C (102.2째F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: MRI of the right knee
B: X-ray of the right knee
C: Surgical intervention
D: Physiotherapy
E: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy
F: Nuclear scan of the right knee
G: Antibiotic therapy
H: Corticosteroid injection
I: Application of a knee brace
J: Arthrocentesis

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's go through it step by step. The patient is a 14-year-old girl with a 2-day history of fever, pain, and swelling in her right knee. She mentions she injured the knee last week while playing soccer and finished it. She has no rash or joint pain, and her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. Now, the exam findings are swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema, with limited range of motion. Her temperature is 39째C (102.2째F), BP 110/80 mmHg, and pulse 95/min, respirations 20/min.

So, the question is about the next steps in management. Let's break down the options.

First, I need to understand the imaging findings. The knee has swelling, which could be due to a tear or an infection. The tenderness and warmth suggest it's not a hard joint, which is a red flag. Limited range of motion usually suggests a tear of the cartilage, because if it's a ligament or fibula, the range would be limited. So, maybe the knee is torn.

What would the options suggest?

Option A: MRI. If the knee is torn, MRI could show the extent of the tear, which might guide treatment. But if the tear is small, maybe it's a less severe issue.

Option B: X-ray. X-rays are used for fractures, which are more definite and can give a clearer view. Without knowing if it's a soft tissue injury, X-ray might not be definitive.

Option C: Surgical intervention. If it's a medial-torso injury, surgery might be needed. But the patient said she finished the game, so maybe she's not having a serious issue.

Option D: Physiotherapy. For a torn knee, you'd probably start with physical therapy to restore function, not direct treatment.

Option E: NSAIDs. That's for inflammation, but if it's a torn cartilage, NSAIDs would be less effective.

Option F: Nuclear scan. That's not a standard procedure. They might be confusing it with a CT scan or something else, but not applicable here.

Option G: Antibiotic therapy. If infection is present, antibiotics would be needed. But without knowing about the infection yet.

Option H: Corticosteroid injection. That's for inflammation, so if there's swelling, but if it's a tear, maybe less needed.

Option I: Knee brace. Sometimes braces help with mobility and reduce swelling, but if the knee is already torn, a brace might not help much.

Option J: Arthrocentesis. That's for joint involvement, but the patient's description doesn't suggest that.

So, considering the exam findings: swelling, tenderness, warm, limited range. So the most likely problem is a torn cartilage. Because the knee is still functional (she finished the game) but has swelling and tenderness, which points to a tear.

So if the knee is torn, what's the next step? She would need to undergo surgery. For example, if it's a medial-torso tear, they might perform a meniscus operation or a meniscus dissection. But since it's a knee injury, maybe a meniscus or meniscal tear.

Another possibility: maybe it's a ligament tear, but that's less likely since the range is limited, which suggests cartilage rather than ligament.

So the next step would be surgical intervention, which is option C.

Let me think about the other options. Option D is physiotherapy, which is for function. But if it's a torn cartilage, the doctor would likely perform surgery. So D isn't the next step.

Option G is about antibiotics, but if there's an infection, that's a separate consideration. But without knowing if it's a bacterial infection or something else, it's hard to say. However, if the patient is young and hasn't had an infection before, maybe it's not.

So, the proper next step is to perform surgery, which is option C.
</think>

The patient's 2-day history includes a 2-day fever, pain, and swelling in the right knee, with limited range of motion, which suggests a torn cartilage. The exam findings indicate swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema, consistent with a medial-torso or meniscus injury. Given her age and recovery from a previous injury, non-surgical intervention is unlikely. Therefore, the next step is to undergo surgical intervention, likely a meniscus or meniscal tear, to address the injury.

**Answer: C: Surgical intervention**
