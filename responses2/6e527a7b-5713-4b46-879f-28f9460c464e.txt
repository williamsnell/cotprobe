Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the 31P NMR spectrum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see...

The question says that a single line is seen in the 31P spectrum of a solution of sodium phosphate. The 31P chemical shifts for H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ are 3.42 ppm and 5.82 ppm respectively. The question is asking about the chemical shift when the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4⁻. The options are from A to J.

Wait, what do I remember about phosphate ions and their isomers? Sodium phosphate is Na3PO4, which dissociates into Na+ and PO4³⁻. But wait, wait—no, wait. No, wait! Sodium phosphate is Na3PO4, which actually gives PO4^3- when it dissociates. But the phosphate species in solution are different. Let me think: the phosphate ion can exist in various forms because phosphate has three resonance structures. So the predominant forms are H3PO4 (which is a weak acid), H2PO4^- (the conjugate base), and HPO4^2- (a resonance structure).

But wait, in solution, the phosphate ion (PO4^3-) is very weakly acidic. So the solution of sodium phosphate would have H3PO4 (weak acid), H2PO4^- (a weak acid), and HPO4^2- (a weak base). Wait, no, wait: H2PO4^- is a base, right? Or is it an acid? Because, when you have a solution of Na3PO4, the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the problem mentions H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the solution is a mixture of both. So, when you have a solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, their 31P shifts are 3.42 ppm and 5.82 ppm, respectively.

Now, the question is about the pH when pH equals pKa of H2PO4^-.

Wait, the pKa of H2PO4^- is 7.2. Because I think the second pKa is around 7.2. So if pH equals that, pH is 7.2. Wait, but H2PO4^- is a weak acid. So when pH > pKa, it's the protonated form (H2PO4^-), and when pH < pKa, it's the deprotonated form (HPO4^2-).

Wait no, wait: Let me recall. For H2PO4^-: the first dissociation is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-. So if pH is greater than pKa (7.2), the H2PO4^- is protonated; if less, it's deprotonated.

So when pH equals pKa (7.2), the solution is at the midpoint between the two forms. Wait, but wait, that's when the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are equal. That's the buffer region. So in this case, the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 1.

Now, the 31P chemical shift is influenced by the electronic environment around the phosphorus atom. So when the pH is higher than pKa, the H2PO4^- is protonated, which would change the electronic environment. Wait, but wait: the 31P chemical shift is influenced by the adjacent group. So in the HPO4^2- form, the phosphate has a negative charge on the oxygen, which would have a stronger electronic environment. So the 31P shift for HPO4^2- is higher (since it's more deshielded) than H2PO4^-.

Wait, but wait: the given values are 3.42 ppm for H2PO4^- and 5.82 ppm for HPO4^2-. So when pH is higher than pKa, H2PO4^- is protonated, which would lower the effective chemical shift, or maybe cause a shift in the other direction. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, I remember that the 31P chemical shifts for phosphorus can be influenced by the adjacent groups. For example, in the H2PO4^- form, the adjacent group is a hydrogen (since it's H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-). In the HPO4^2- form, the adjacent group is an oxygen with a negative charge.

Wait, but when H2PO4^- is deprotonated (HPO4^2- form), the adjacent group is more electronegative (since the oxygen has a negative charge), which would lead to a higher chemical shift. So if the solution's pH is higher than pKa, you have HPO4^2- dominant, so the chemical shift would be higher than 3.42 ppm.

Wait, but the question is asking what the chemical shift would be when pH equals the pKa of H2PO4^- (which is 7.2). So at pH 7.2, the solution is a buffer where H2PO4^- is 50% H2PO4^- and 50% HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the 31P NMR spectrum, the chemical shift is usually influenced by the electronic environment. So what's the shift when the solution is in the buffer region (pH = pKa), where the two species are present in equal amounts?

Wait, maybe I need to think about whether the chemical shift depends on the pH when the solution is at the pKa. Or perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the behavior of 31P shifts. The 31P chemical shift for H2PO4^- is about 3.42 ppm. When the solution is at pH higher than pKa, H2PO4^- is protonated (HPO4^2-), which could change the chemical shift. Wait, or does the chemical shift depend on the adjacent electron density?

Alternatively, maybe the 31P chemical shift in the H2PO4^- form is influenced by the electron density. I think that when the H2PO4^- is deprotonated, the electron density around the P atom is higher, which would cause a lower chemical shift. Because more electron density would make the P less shielded, leading to a lower ppm (since higher chemical shift is more deshielded). Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the 31P chemical shift is influenced by the electron environment. If the P is surrounded by more electron density, it's less deshielded, so the chemical shift would be higher (because the nucleus is less shielded). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, higher chemical shift (like 5.82 ppm) is more deshielded, so the P is more shielded. No, wait, no. Wait, the chemical shift depends on the shielding. If the environment around P is more shielded, the chemical shift increases. If the P is deshielded, the shift decreases.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for H2PO4^- (acidic form), the chemical shift is around 3.42 ppm. When it's deprotonated (HPO4^2-), the chemical shift increases because the P is more deshielded. So when pH is higher than pKa, the P is in the HPO4^2- form, which has a higher shift (5.82 ppm).

So in the buffer region (pH = pKa), the solution has equal amounts of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the average shift would be the average of 3.42 and 5.82 ppm, which is (3.42 +5.82)/2 = 9.24/2 = 4.62 ppm. But wait, that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm thinking about this the wrong way.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking about the chemical shift when pH equals pKa of H2PO4^-. So that's pH 7.2. At this pH, the solution is a buffer solution where the two forms are present in equal amounts. But wait, does the chemical shift change in this case?

Alternatively, perhaps the 31P chemical shift is determined by the effective hydrogen's environment. Maybe when the solution is at the pKa, the hydrogen is a proton, but wait, no, because the H2PO4^- is a protonated form; the HPO4^2- is the deprotonated form. So perhaps the shift doesn't change because the concentration is equal, but the question is about the shift when pH is pKa.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the 31P NMR spectrum's shape. The 31P spectrum of phosphate is usually a broad peak around 3.4-5 ppm. It's a sharp peak because there are only two isomers. But when the pH is around the pKa, the peak can broaden, but the question is about the chemical shift.

Wait, I'm not sure. Another approach: when the solution is in the buffer region, pH = pKa, the ratio of H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- is 1. So the average chemical shift would be the average of the two shifts. So (3.42 +5.82)/2 = 4.62 ppm. But looking at the options, option H is 4.62 ppm. So that would be the answer. But wait, the options don't have 4.62 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 6.10 ppm
B:3.98 ppm
C:5.00 ppm
D:3.41 ppm
E:4.33 ppm
F:3.50 ppm
G:5.82 ppm
H:4.62 ppm
I:4.50 ppm
J:2.98 ppm

Yes, option H is 4.62 ppm. But wait, is the shift at pH=pKa exactly the average of the two isomers?

Hmm, wait. At pH equal to the pKa of H2PO4^-, the solution is a buffer with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in equal amounts. So the 31P NMR would have a peak that's the average of the two shifts. So the chemical shift should be about (3.42 +5.82)/2 = 4.62 ppm. So option H is 4.62.

Wait, but the question says, "the chemical shift when the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4^-". So that's when the pH is 7.2, and the ratio of H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- is 1. So the average would be 4.62. Hence, option H:4.62 ppm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 4.62. So that's the answer.

The problem involves the 31P NMR spectrum of a solution of sodium phosphate, where the chemical shifts of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are given as 3.42 ppm and 5.82 ppm, respectively. The question asks for the chemical shift when the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H₂PO₄⁻, which is 7.2. 

At pH = pKa, the solution is a buffer where the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are equal. In such a buffer region, the average chemical shift of the two isomers is calculated as:

\[
\text{Average chemical shift} = \frac{\text{Chemical shift of H₂PO₄⁻} + \text{Chemical shift of HPO₄²⁻}}{2} = \frac{3.42 + 5.82}{2} = 4.62 \, \text{ppm}.
\]

Thus, the chemical shift at pH = pKa of H₂PO₄⁻ is 4.62 ppm. Among the given options, this corresponds to option H: 4.62 ppm.
