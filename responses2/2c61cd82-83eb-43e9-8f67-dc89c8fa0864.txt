Okay, so I need to figure out how many ribs there are in the human body. Hmm, I remember that humans have ribs, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. Let me think. I think about the structure of the body. The body is made up of bones and muscles, and the skeletal system has different parts like the head, neck, and the rest of the body. 

Wait, the head has two heads, right? Each head has a certain number of ribs. Oh yeah, each head has 2-3 pairs of ribs. Wait, no, maybe each head has 2 pairs, so that's four ribs? Or is it two per head? Or is it more? I'm a bit confused here. 

I think each head has four ribs, but I'm not totally sure. Let me try to recall. Oh, right! Each head has four ribs. So two heads would mean 4 x 2 = 8 ribs. But wait, isn't there another part called the chest? Oh, the chest has two additional ribs. So if each head has 4, and there's a chest, that's 4+4+2=10? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. 

Wait, another approach. I remember that humans have a total of 22 ribs. Oh, wait, that's the chest. So the total number of ribs would be 22? Or is it more? No, wait, no, the chest is part of the body, not a rib. So the total number of ribs in the body is 22? Or is it 24? Or wait, perhaps 24?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to structure this. The body is divided into the head, neck, and the rest. Each head has a certain number of ribs. The head has two heads, each with four ribs. So that's 4 x 2 = 8. Plus the chest, which has two additional ribs. So 8 + 2 = 10. But wait, that doesn't make sense because I'm pretty sure the total number is 22. 

Another thought: the chest has two pairs of ribs, which is four, but wait, no, the chest has two separate pairs, each pair being two ribs. So each pair has two ribs, so two pairs is four. So, 4 for the head, 4 for the chest, but wait, that would be 8, but I thought the total was 22. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the total number of ribs is 22, which includes the chest. So each head has 4, two heads make 8, plus 14? No, that adds up to 22. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total number of ribs is 22, including the chest. So 22 is the correct answer. But I'm not certain because sometimes I might confuse the numbers.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the last character of the answer. The options are from A to J. Let me see the options again:

A:42, B:24, C:18, D:36, E:40, F:28, G:22, H:30, I:20, J:32.

So the correct answer is 22, which is option G. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is 22, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
