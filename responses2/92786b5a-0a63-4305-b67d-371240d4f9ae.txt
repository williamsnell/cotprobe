Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, right? Let me read it again. It says that an air molecule is moving at 500 m/s, and I need to find its kinetic energy. Oh, and the mass is given as 4.6 × 10^-26 kg. Hmm, okay, I remember that kinetic energy is calculated using the formula KE = ½ mv². That makes sense, right?

Wait, let me break it down. So, KE is one-half mass multiplied by velocity squared. So I need to plug in the numbers. Let me jot this down. The mass m is 4.6e-26 kg. Velocity v is 500 m/s.

So first, I'll square the velocity. 500 squared is 250,000. Oh, that's 2.5e5. But wait, 500 is 5e2, so 5e2 squared is 25e4, which is 2.5e5. So, correct.

Next, I multiply that by the mass. So 2.5e5 m²/s² multiplied by 4.6e-26 kg. Let me multiply those. 2.5 *4.6 is... let me calculate. 2 *4.6 is 9.2, and 0.5 *4.6 is 2.3, so total 11.5. So 11.5e(5-26) = 11.5e-21, which is 1.15e-20. But wait, that's just the product mv². Oh, right, because KE is half of that. So then I need to divide by 2.

1.15e-20 divided by 2 is 0.575e-20. Wait, 0.575e-20 is the same as 5.75e-21. So KE is 5.75e-21 Joules. Looking at the options, option I is 5.75 × 10^-21 J, so that's one of the choices. But wait, another option is E, which is 4.6e-26, but that's the mass, not the kinetic energy. Let me check the options again.

Options: A:7.3e-26, B:9.2e-21, C:3.45e-21, D:2.3e-21, E:4.6e-26, F:2.875e-20, G:6.9e-22, H:1.15e-19, I:5.75e-21, J:1.15e-20.

So option I is 5.75e-21. So that's the correct value. So the answer should be I. But wait, did I do all the calculations right?

Let me double-check. 500 squared is 250,000, which is 2.5e5. 2.5e5 multiplied by 4.6e-26. Let's compute the exponents: 10^5 *10^-26 is 10^-21. Then 2.5 *4.6 is 11.5. So 11.5e-21. Then dividing by 2 gives 5.75e-21.

Yes, that's correct. So the kinetic energy is 5.75e-21 J. Looking at the options, that's option I. So the correct answer is I.

To compute the kinetic energy \( K \) of a gas molecule moving at a speed of \( v = 500 \, \text{m/s} \) with a mass \( m = 4.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \), we use the formula for kinetic energy:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

1. **Calculate \( v^2 \):**  
   \( v^2 = 500^2 = 250,000 = 2.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \).

2. **Compute \( m v^2 \):**  
   \( m v^2 = (4.6 \times 10^{-26}) \times (2.5 \times 10^5) \).  
   Multiply the coefficients: \( 4.6 \times 2.5 = 11.5 \).  
   Add the exponents: \( 10^{-26} \times 10^5 = 10^{-21} \).  
   Thus, \( m v^2 = 11.5 \times 10^{-21} = 1.15 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \).

3. **Divide by 2 to find kinetic energy:**  
   \( K = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.15 \times 10^{-20} = 0.575 \times 10^{-20} = 5.75 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J} \).

4. **Compare with the options:**  
   The calculated value \( 5.75 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J} \) matches option **I**.
