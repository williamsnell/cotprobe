Question:

The Experimental Company is now producing and selling 17,000 units of product per year at a sales price of $250 each. It has had a profit objective of 20 percent return on a $2,000,000 investment. Its present cost structure is as follows: Manufacturing costs: Fixed costs $400,000 per year Variable costs $175 per unit produced Selling and administration expenses: Fixed expenses $135,000 per year Variable expenses $25 per unit sold Ten hours are required to produce a unit of product. The company is interested in pushing its rate of operations to 100 percent of its capacity-20,000 units of product. It believes that it can raise its price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting its present sales volume. In addition, it believes that it can increase its sales to productive capacity with minor design and quality improvements that will increase variable manufacturing costs by $5 per unit, and with accompanying promotion that will increase its variable selling and administration expenses by $5 per unit for all units sold. The company would like to achieve a profit objective of 25 percent on its investment. REQUIRED: 1) Can the company, within the price increase limitation indicated, achieve its new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased variable costs and expenses required? 2) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the new profit objective? 3) What sales price would achieve the old profit objective?

Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about the Experimental Company. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The company is currently producing and selling 17,000 units at $250 each. They have a profit target of 20% on a $2,000,000 investment, which is $400,000 profit. But they want to increase their production to 20,000 units, which is 100% of capacity. 

First, the question is about whether they can achieve their new profit objective under certain conditions. Let's see: they can increase the price by up to 5% without changing sales volume. So, the new price would be $250 * 1.05 = $262.50. But wait, they might not have to raise the price—maybe they're considering that as an option. However, the question says they can raise the price by up to 5%—so I think they might choose to do that if that helps them reach their target profit.

Next, if they do increase the price, they can adjust their costs. The problem states that variable manufacturing costs will increase by $5 per unit, and variable selling and administration expenses will also go up by $5 per unit. So, their total variable costs per unit would go up by $10. But they can also increase production capacity to 20,000 units to meet the demand. 

Wait, but the question is about whether they can achieve the new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with these increased costs and promotions. So, they want to see if producing 20,000 units at the new price and adjusted costs can meet the 25% profit target.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the new profit target. 25% of $2,000,000 is $500,000 profit.

2. Determine the new total costs and revenues when producing 20,000 units at $262.50 each.

3. Also, consider that variable costs increase by $5 each, so the per-unit cost is higher. Also, they might need to pay fixed costs and any other expenses.

Wait, but the original fixed costs were $400,000 for manufacturing and $135,000 for administrative expenses. So, fixed costs remain the same, but variable costs increase.

Wait no, the problem says that they can increase their sales to productive capacity with the promotion. So, the fixed costs might remain the same, but variable costs would go up. Let me check the problem again.

The problem states that variable manufacturing costs will increase by $5 per unit, and variable selling and administration expenses will increase by $5 per unit. So, each unit's variable cost goes up by $10. So, per unit cost is $175 + $25 + $10 = $210? Wait, no, let me get the breakdown right.

The original data:

- Variable manufacturing cost: $175 per unit.
- Variable selling and admin: $25 per unit.

If they increase variable costs by $5 each, the new per-unit variable manufacturing cost is 175 +5 = 180. Variable selling and admin is 25 +5 =30. So, total variable cost per unit becomes 180 +30 = $210. 

Wait, but the company is pushing capacity, so perhaps they can't just make 20k units. But the problem says they're interested in pushing to 100% capacity. So, maybe they can produce 20k units, but the fixed costs remain the same, so they need to cover both fixed and variable costs. But wait, maybe production is constrained by capacity.

Alternatively, maybe it's not the case. Wait, the problem says they can increase production to 20k units. So, perhaps they can produce exactly 20k units at the new price, with increased costs.

Wait, no, let me re-read the question for clarity: the company is interested in pushing its rate of operations to 100% of its capacity (20k units). They can increase their sales to productive capacity with minor design and quality improvements that will increase variable manufacturing costs by $5, and the promotion will increase variable selling and admin by $5 each for all units sold. 

So, the company can reach full capacity, but their variable costs will go up by $5 each. So, manufacturing cost per unit: 175 +5 = 180. Variable selling/admin: 25+5=30. So, per unit cost is 180+30=210.

But wait, the original fixed costs are $400k for manufacturing and $135k for admin. So, the total fixed costs are 400k +135k =535k. Then, variable costs per unit are 210.

Wait, but when they increase production to 20k units, they can produce 20k units. So, the total variable cost would be 20k *210=4,200,000. Fixed costs are 535k, so total costs are 4,200k +535k=4,735,000.

Their revenue would be number of units sold (20k) multiplied by the new price. The new price is $262.50, so 20,000 *262.50 =5,250,000.

So, total costs are 4,735k, revenue is 5,250k. Profit would be 5,250k -4,735k=515,000.

But their target is a 25% return on investment (ROI) of $500k. So, they need to make $500k profit. Their current profit is $400k, so they need an additional $100,000. Let's see if 515k meets that. Yes, 515k-400k=115k. But they need 100k. So, they can reach that. But wait, the question is whether they can achieve the new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased costs and promotions.

Wait, but the question is two parts:

1. Can they achieve the new profit objective?

2. What's the new sales price?

Wait, the first question is about the new profit objective, but the way the problem is structured, the first part is whether they can reach the new target profit, and the third part is about the old profit objective. Wait, no, the question in the problem is a bit unclear.

Wait, the problem says: 1) can they achieve their new profit objective by reaching full capacity with increased costs and expenses. 2) What's the new sales price? 3) What's the old sales price.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine.

The problem is split into three parts, but the way the question is presented is:

Question 1: Can they, within the price increase limit, achieve their new profit objective by reaching full capacity with increased variable costs and expenses?

Question 2: What's the new sales price to achieve the new profit.

Question 3: What's the old sales price to achieve the old profit.

Wait, but the actual question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says:

"1) Can the company, within the price increase limitation indicated, achieve its new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased variable costs and expenses required?"

2) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the new profit objective?

3) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the old profit objective?

Wait, no, the last sentence says:

"1) Can the company, within the price increase limitation indicated, achieve its new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased variable costs and expenses required?"

2) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the new profit objective?

3) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the old profit objective?

Wait, no, the user instruction says:

The problem is about whether the company can achieve the new profit objective by increasing production to 20k. And also about the old profit objective.

So, the first part is: can they achieve the new profit objective by reaching full capacity with increased costs and expenses.

The second part is: What's the new sales price.

The third part: What's the sales price to achieve the old profit.

Wait, so the third part is the old profit objective, which is 20% on 2k million, which is 400k profit.

But for the second part, the new sales price is 262.50.

So, for the first part, they are considering increasing production to 20k, so they need to calculate the required profit.

So, the first part's answer would be whether the new profit is 500k.

Let me compute.

Under the new scenario:

Fixed costs: 535k.

Variable cost per unit: 180 (175+5) +30 (25+5) = 210.

Number of units:20,000.

Revenue: 20k * new price.

Profit = revenue - (fixed + variable costs) = 20k * new_price - (535k + 20k *210).

We need profit to be 500k.

So, 20k * new_price - (535k + 4,200k) = 500k.

So, 20k * new_price = 500k + (535k +4,200k) = 975k +535k? Wait, wait, let me compute:

Wait, 535k +4,200k =4,735k. So,

20k * new_price =500k +4,735k=5,235k.

So, new_price =5,235k /20k =5,235 /20 =261.75.

So, the new price would need to be $261.75 to achieve the 500k profit.

But wait, the first part of the question is whether they can achieve the new profit by increasing price and capacity. So, in this scenario, their new price would be $261.75, which is lower than the original $250, but that's part of the new price calculation.

Wait, but the first part of the question says, "can they achieve their new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased variable costs and expenses required?" So, in that case, they can, but the required new price is $261.75. So, the first part's answer is yes, and the new price is $261.75.

Wait, but the options in the question (A to J) provide possible new and old prices, so let's check the correct options.

The options are:

A: $258.00, $259.50, $253.00.

B: $257.50, $258.75, $252.00.

C: $269, 269.50, 263.

D: 262.50, 261.75, 255.

E: 255.50, 262.75, 265.

Hmm. So for the first part, the new price is 261.75, but none of the options have that as the second choice. Looking at the available options, option D has 261.75 as the second number. So, that's part of the answer.

Wait, but the first part is whether they can achieve the new profit by reaching full capacity. So, yes, they can, but the required price is 261.75. So, the first part's answer would have the new price as 261.75, but looking at the options, the second choice in option D is 261.75, but the first is $262.50. Wait, no, that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps the increase in price is 5% but they can choose to raise it to $262.50, which would be their new price. But that would be part of the scenario. Let me think.

Wait, the first part of the question is whether the company can achieve the new profit by pushing to full capacity with increased costs and selling at the new price. So, if they raise the price to 262.50, would that allow them to reach the new profit of 500k?

Wait, let's compute that scenario.

At 20k units, 262.50 each.

Revenue =20k *262.50 =5,250,000.

Variable costs:20,000 *210=4,200,000.

Fixed costs:535,000.

Profit =5,250,000 - (4,200,000 +535,000) =5,250,000 -4,735,000=515,000.

Which is 515k, which is more than the target of 500k. So, this would achieve the new profit.

However, is the price allowed to go up to 262.50? The question says, "they can raise their price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting sales volume." So, the new price could be 262.50, but whether they can choose to go that high is a possibility.

But the first part of the question is whether they can achieve the new profit by increasing price to 262.50 and reaching full capacity. So, in that case, yes.

But let's think about the options. Looking at option D, which has a sales price of 261.75 for the new target, but option B has 261.75 as the second choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate.

Let me compute the required revenue for a 500k profit.

Fixed costs are 535k.

Variable costs are 20k *210=4,200k.

Total costs:535k +4,200k=4,735k.

Profit is revenue -4,735k=500k.

So, revenue =500k +4,735k=5,235k.

So, price per unit =5,235k /20k=5,235/20=261.75.

Thus, the new price would have to be $261.75 to reach 500k profit.

Looking back at the options, the second part of the first question would be $261.75.

But in the options, the choices for the second part of the first question are:

A:259.50

B:258.75

C:269.50

D:261.75

E:255.50

So, D's second part is 261.75. But the first part of the question is whether they can achieve the new profit by pushing to capacity. So, the answer for the first part is yes, and the new price is 261.75, but that's not an option for the second part of the first question.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait another look:

The question is, part 1: can they achieve the new profit by pushing capacity, given the increased costs and promotions. So, the answer to that part is yes. And the new price is 261.75. Now, in the options, the second part for the first question is 261.75, but looking at the options again, the first part's correct answer is yes, and the second part's correct answer is 261.75, but the options don't have D's first part as 262.50. Wait, no, looking again, in the options, the second part for the first question is 261.75 (option D), but the first part of the question is whether they can achieve the new profit by pushing capacity, which is yes.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the options. Let me think: the options present the third part as the old sales price, and the second part as the new sales price. So, the first question's options are A to J, each having three possible options, but the way they are presented is perhaps the first question's options have the first part as the correct price.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options given.

The available options are:

A: $258, $259.50, $253.

B: $257.50, $258.75, $252.

C: $269, $269.50, $263.

D: $262.50, $261.75, $255.

E: $255.50, $262.75, $265.

F: $267.50, $268, $262.50.

G: $270, $270.50, $265.

H: $263.50, $264, $258.50.

I: $265.50, $265.75, $260.

J: $260.50, $260.75, $250.

So, the options for the first part (new price) are the second part in each. So, the first part is yes, and the new price is 261.75. But wait, looking through the options, option D's second part is 261.75. So, the first part of the question is yes, and the second part is 261.75, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, but the first part of the question is about whether they can achieve the new profit by pushing full capacity. So, the answer is yes, and the new price is 261.75. But the options for the first part are their second choice. So, option D's second choice is 261.75, which would be the correct answer for the first part.

But wait, the first part is a yes or no question. So, the correct answer is yes, the new price is 261.75. But looking at the options, the second part of the first question is 261.75, which is option D's second part.

So, for the first part of the question: yes, and the new price is 261.75.

Now, part two of the question, the third part (option D) says 261.75 is the old price, which is 255. So, the old sales price is 255.

Wait, no, option D's third part is 255. So, the old price is 255.

Wait, but the old price is when the company is not pushing full capacity. So, perhaps in the old scenario, the company's price is lower.

Wait, but the problem is not clear on this. So, perhaps I should proceed to answer each part step by step.

First part: Can they achieve their new profit objective by reaching 20k units, and what is the required price to do that? Let's say they can, and the price would need to be 261.75.

So, the first part's answer is yes, and the new price is 261.75.

Now, the old part: the problem is asking about the old profit objective, which is a 20% return on $2 million, which is $400k profit.

So, in the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, what is the profit?

In the old scenario, the company produces 17,000 units (I think, because 20,000 is capacity, but perhaps the old scenario is 17,000 units, but the problem states that the company is producing 17,000 units, as per the initial problem statement: the present price is $250, and the original problem says that the company is producing 17,000 units, with fixed costs of $400k.

Wait, no, let me go back.

In the initial problem statement, the company's fixed costs are $400k, variable manufacturing is $175 per unit, variable selling and admin is $25 per unit.

So, the company is producing 17,000 units, with fixed costs of 400k, variable costs of 175 +25 =200 per unit.

Wait, no, fixed costs are 400k regardless of production.

Wait, perhaps the company is producing 17,000 units at a price of $250, with fixed costs of 400k, variable costs of 200 per unit.

But the problem is about whether they can reach 20k units at a higher price.

But perhaps in the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, they can only produce 17,000 units. So, the fixed costs would be 400k, and variable costs 200 per unit.

So, the profit would be revenue (17,000 * old_price) - fixed costs - variable costs.

But the old_price is not given. Wait, but perhaps the old scenario is where the company can't push to capacity, so they have to produce 17,000 units at the current price or lower.

Wait, the problem is confusing. So, perhaps I should approach the problem step by step.

Let me consider the first part: whether the company can achieve the new profit objective by reaching 20k units at a price of 261.75.

If they do so, they can achieve the 25% ROI. So, the question is yes.

Now, the old part: what's the old price? The old price is probably the price when the company is operating without pushing to capacity. So, perhaps the old price is higher than the new price of 261.75. Wait, but that can't be, because the new price is 261.75, which is higher than the old price.

Wait, but the old scenario is when they don't push to capacity, so they can't push to 20k units. So, in the old scenario, they could produce 17,000 units at a lower price. Wait, but without pushing to capacity, perhaps they can't push to capacity and can only produce 17,000 units at the current price or lower.

So, the old price would be the price at which they can produce 17,000 units, which is the same as the current price, which is $250. But that's not making sense because they can't push to capacity at the same time.

Wait, perhaps the old price is lower than $250, allowing them to produce 17,000 units.

Wait, but the problem is unclear on this point. So, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the old price is the price that would allow them to produce 17,000 units at the same time, and calculate accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the old price is the price that, when they produce 17,000 units, their revenue would cover their costs.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed with the calculations.

In the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, the company can produce 17,000 units. So, fixed costs are 400k, variable costs per unit is 200.

So, the total costs are 400k + 17,000 *200.

What's 17,000 *200? That's 3,400,000.

So, total costs:400k + 3,400k =3,800k.

So, if the price is P, then revenue is 17,000 * P.

Profit is 17,000P -3,800,000 = desired profit.

But in the old scenario, the problem says that the company can reach full capacity with increased costs and expenses. So, perhaps the old scenario is when they can't push to capacity, and can only produce 17,000 units.

So, the old price is the price where they can produce 17,000 units, which is the same as the current price, $250.

But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the old price is the price where they can produce 17,000 units at a lower price, and the company can push to capacity by increasing the price and the number of units.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the old price is the price that allows them to produce 17,000 units, and the new price would be the price that allows them to produce 20,000 units.

So, in the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, they can only produce 17,000 units. So, the revenue is 17,000 * old_price =17,000 *250=4,250,000.

But in the new scenario, they can produce 20,000 units, so revenue is 20,000 * new_price.

So, in the old scenario, the company's total cost is fixed costs plus variable costs. But without pushing to capacity, the company's variable costs are based on 17,000 units.

So, in the old scenario, fixed costs are 400k, variable costs are 17,000 * variable cost per unit. Hmm, perhaps the variable cost per unit is $200.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not clear, so perhaps I should proceed with the calculations.

In the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, the company can produce 17,000 units. So, the revenue is 17,000 * current_price =17,000 *250=4,250,000.

The total cost is fixed costs (400k) plus variable costs (17,000 * variable cost per unit). The variable cost per unit is 200.

So, total variable costs:17,000 *200=3,400,000.

Total costs:4,200,000.

So, profit is 4,250,000 -4,200,000=50,000.

So, in the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, they make 50k profit.

But in the old scenario, the problem is about whether they can push to capacity with increased costs and promotions. So, perhaps in the old scenario, the company can't push to capacity, but the new scenario is pushing to capacity.

So, in the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, the company can make 50k profit.

But in the new scenario, they can push to capacity, which would require increasing the price and units.

So, the old price is when they can produce 17,000 units at the same time, which is 250.

But that's not helpful because they can't push to capacity at the same time.

Alternatively, perhaps the old price is the price when they can produce 17,000 units, and the new price is when they can produce 20,000 units.

So, in the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, the company makes 50k profit.

In the new scenario, they push to capacity, which requires increasing the price and units.

So, the old price is 250, and the new price is the price that allows them to produce 20,000 units.

So, in the new scenario, the company can produce 20,000 units, which would be at a higher price. So, the old price is 250, and the new price is 261.75.

Wait, but that's the same as the first part of the question. Hmm.

So, perhaps the old price is 250, and the new price is 261.75.

But looking back at the options, the correct new price for the first part is 261.75, which is option D's second part.

So, for the first part of the question, the new price is 261.75, which is option D's second part.

Now, the old part: what is the old price?

In the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, the company can only make 50k profit.

But the old price is when the company can produce 17,000 units, which is 250, but that can't be, because they can't push to capacity at the same time.

Alternatively, perhaps the old price is when they can produce 17,000 units, and that price is 250, and without increasing the price, they can't push to capacity, so the old price is 250.

But the problem is about pushing to capacity, so perhaps the old price is irrelevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

In the old scenario, without pushing to capacity, the company can produce 17,000 units. So, the fixed costs are 400k, variable costs are 17,000 *200=3,400k. So, total costs are 3,800k.

The profit is revenue (17,000 * old_price) -3,800k.

In the old scenario, what is the old price? It's when the company can produce 17,000 units. So, the old price is the price that allows them to produce 17,000 units, which is presumably the same as the current price, 250.

Wait, but that's not helpful because they can't push to capacity at the same time.

Alternatively, perhaps the old price is when they can produce 17,000 units, which is 250, and the new price is when they can produce 20,000 units, which is 261.75.

So, the old price is 250, and the new price is 261.75.

Wait, but that would be the same as the first part of the question. So, perhaps the old price is 250, and the new price is 261.75.

But the first part of the question is about whether they can achieve the new profit by pushing to capacity, and the new price is 261.75, which is option D's second part.

So, perhaps the old price is not required, as the question is only about the new part.

Alternatively, perhaps the old part is about the old price, which is when the company is producing 17,000 units, which is the old price.

But without pushing to capacity, the company can only make 50k profit.

So, in the old scenario, their profit is 50k, so 17,000 * old_price -3,800,000 =50,000.

So, 17,000 * old_price =4,250,000.

Thus, old_price =4,250,000 /17,000=250.

So, old_price is 250.

So, the old price is 250, and the new price is 261.75.

So, the first part of the question is about whether they can achieve the new profit by pushing to capacity, which is yes, and the new price is 261.75.

The second part is about the old price, which is 250.

But looking at the options, the correct old price is 250, which is not directly present in the options, but perhaps in option D, the third part is 255, which is not correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: 258, 259.5, 253

B: 257.5, 258.75, 252

C: 269, 269.5, 263

D: 262.5, 261.75, 255

E: 255.5, 262.75, 265

F: 267.5, 268, 262.5

G: 270, 270.5, 265

H: 263.5, 264, 258.5

I: 265.5, 265.75, 260

J: 260.5, 260.75, 250.

So, the correct old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

Wait, but the old scenario is when they can produce 17,000 units, which is the same as the current price, 250.

But the question is about whether they can push to capacity, which is possible, but the old scenario is when they can't push to capacity, which would require a different price.

So, perhaps the old price is 250, which is correct, but it's not present in the options except in option J as the third part.

But in the options, the correct old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

But looking back, the old scenario is when they can produce 17,000 units at the same time, which is 250.

But the company can't push to capacity at the same time, so the old price is 250, and the new price is 261.75.

So, for the first part of the question: is the new price 261.75? Yes, and that's option D's second part.

For the old part: the old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

So, the correct answers are:

First part: yes, new price is 261.75.

Second part: old price is 250.

But looking at the options, the correct old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

Wait, but the old scenario is when they can produce 17,000 units at the same time, which is 250.

So, the old price is 250, and the new price is 261.75.

Thus, for the first part of the question, the new price is 261.75, which is option D's second part.

For the second part, the old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

So, the correct answers are:

Question 1: yes, new price is 261.75.

Question 2: old price is 250.

But looking at the provided options, the correct answers are:

Question 1: yes, new price is 261.75.

Question 2: old price is 250.

But looking at the options, the correct old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

But in the options, the correct old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

Wait, but the options are the same for each question, so perhaps the correct answer is option D for the first part and option J for the second part.

Wait, no, the options are the same for each question. So, perhaps I'm misreading.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

The options are:

A: 258, 259.5, 253

B: 257.5, 258.75, 252

C: 269, 269.5, 263

D: 262.5, 261.75, 255

E: 255.5, 262.75, 265

F: 267.5, 268, 262.5

G: 270, 270.5, 265

H: 263.5, 264, 258.5

I: 265.5, 265.75, 260

J: 260.5, 260.75, 250.

So, each option has three numbers.

So, for the first part of the question, the correct new price is 261.75, which is option D's second part.

For the second part, the correct old price is 250, which is option J's third part.

But looking at the provided options, the correct answer to the first part is option D's second part, and the correct answer to the second part is option J's third part.

But in the options, each part is a separate question. So, perhaps the correct answers are:

Question 1: 261.75

Question 2: 250

But in the options, the correct answers are:

Question 1: Option D

Question 2: Option J

Wait, but I'm not sure if the options are per part or per question.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answers are:

Question 1: 261.75

Question 2: 250

But looking at the options, the correct answer for the first part is option D, and for the second part, option J.

But in the given options, each option is a triplet, so each option corresponds to a question part.

So, the correct answers are:

Question 1: Option D

Question 2: Option J

But in the context of the question, the correct answers are:

Question 1: 261.75

Question 2: 250

So, the correct answers are:

1. 261.75

2. 250

Looking at the options, the correct answer for the first question is option D, and for the second question, option J.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating the problem, and the correct answers are:

The first part of the question is asking whether the company can achieve the new profit objective by pushing to capacity, and the answer is yes, with the new price being 261.75.

The second part of the question is asking what the old price was, and the answer is 250.

But given the options, the correct answer for the first part is option D, and for the second part, option J.

So, the correct options are:

Question 1: D

Question 2: J

But I'm not sure if the options are per question or per part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answers are:

Question 1: D

Question 2: J

But the initial option is:

A: 258, 259.5, 253

B: 257.5, 258.75, 252

C: 269, 269.5, 263

D: 262.5, 261.75, 255

E: 255.5, 262.75, 265

F: 267.5, 268, 262.5

G: 270, 270.5, 265

H: 263.5, 264, 258.5

I: 265.5, 265.75, 260

J: 260.5, 260.75, 250.

So, for the first question, the correct answer is option D, and for the second question, the correct answer is option J.

But looking at the question, the first part is asking about the new price, and the second part is about the old price.

So, the correct answers are:

1. 261.75

2. 250

Thus, the correct options are D and J.

But I'm not entirely confident, but I think that's the best I can do.
</think>

The correct answers are:

1. **Yes**, the new price is **261.75**.

2. **250**, the old price is **250**.

So, the correct options are:

1. **D**

2. **J**
