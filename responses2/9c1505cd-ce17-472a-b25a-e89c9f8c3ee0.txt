Okay, so I've got this question about spatial Poisson processes. Let me try to break it down. The process is spatial and has a constant intensity of 11 in d-dimensional space, where d is at least 2. The question is about finding the ratio N(S)/|S| as the radius r of the ball S goes to infinity. 

Alright, so N(S) is the number of points in the Poisson process within the ball S. The volume of S is |S|. The intensity is 11, which I remember is the average number of points per unit volume. Wait, but intensity for spatial processes is usually the average number per unit area or volume. So, for a Poisson process, the expected number of points in a region is the intensity multiplied by the volume of the region. So, E[N(S)] should be 11 * |S|. 

But the question is about the ratio N(S)/|S| as r approaches infinity. Hmm, as r grows, |S| becomes very large. But wait, N(S) is a random variable, so we need to consider its behavior in the limit. If the process is homogeneous and stationary, the ratio might tend to the intensity. Or perhaps it depends on whether the process is scaled.

Wait, let's think again. The intensity is 11, which is the expected number per unit volume. So, the expected value E[N(S)] = 11 * |S|. So, the ratio E[N(S)] / |S| = 11. But the question is about the limit of N(S)/|S| as r→∞. Since N(S) is a Poisson random variable with mean 11|S|, the ratio is almost surely equal to 11, right? Because for a Poisson process, the number of points in a region tends to the intensity times the volume, so the ratio should approach the intensity as the volume increases.

Wait, but wait, wait. The question is about the limit of N(S)/|S| as r approaches infinity. If |S| approaches infinity, then for any fixed point, the density is 11. So, the ratio N(S)/|S| should approach 11. But wait, no, because N(S) is a Poisson variable. So when r is very large, |S| is very large, but N(S) is also a Poisson variable with a mean proportional to |S|. So, the ratio is like a Poisson variable divided by its expected value. I remember that for Poisson variables, N(S)/E[N(S)] tends to 1 in probability as the expected value grows. So, as |S| approaches infinity, E[N(S)] is 11|S|, so N(S) is Poisson(11|S|), so N(S)/|S| is Poisson(11) divided by |S|, but that's not the case. Wait, no, N(S) is a Poisson(11|S|), so N(S)/|S| is Poisson(11), but scaled by 1/|S|. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that for a homogeneous Poisson process, the number of points in a region is Poisson distributed with intensity equal to the expected number. So, if the intensity is 11 per unit volume, then in a region of volume V, the expected number is 11V. So, the ratio N(S)/V would have a Poisson distribution with mean 11V, so in the limit as V→infty, the ratio would be approximately 11. But that's in expectation. The question is about the limit of the ratio itself. Because N(S) is Poisson, the ratio could vary, but in probability, the ratio is equal to the intensity in the limit. So, I think the limit is 11.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If we have a Poisson process with intensity λ, then the number of points in a region of volume V is Poisson(λ V). So, the ratio N(S)/V is Poisson(λ V)/V. As V becomes large, the Poisson distribution becomes approximately a normal distribution with mean λ V and variance λ V. So, the expected value is λ V, so the ratio E[N(S)/V] = λ V / V = λ. But the ratio itself, N(S)/V, is a random variable. In probability, for a Poisson variable, the ratio is equal to the Poisson parameter in the limit as the parameter tends to infinity. Wait, no, that's not right. 

Wait, more accurately, for a Poisson variable X with parameter λ, the ratio X/λ tends to 1 in probability as λ→∞, because the variance is λ, so σ is sqrt(λ), so by Chebyshev's inequality, P(|X - λ| ≥ t) ≤ (λ)/(t²). So, if λ is large, X is about λ with variance λ. So, X/λ is about 1 with variance 1/(λ), so as λ increases, X/λ converges in probability to 1. But in our case, the ratio is N(S)/|S|, and N(S) is Poisson(11|S|). So, N(S)/|S| is a Poisson(11)|S| / |S|, which is Poisson(11). But wait, that can't be right because that would imply that N(S)/|S| is Poisson(11), which doesn't depend on |S|. But that's not possible because as |S| increases, N(S) increases as well, so the ratio would approach 11.

Wait, maybe the way to think about it is that for a homogeneous Poisson process in a large volume, the average density is 11 per unit volume, so N(S)/|S| should approach 11. So the limit would be 11. But let me check the options. Option F is 11.0, so that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the intensity is 11, then the expected number of points in S is 11 * |S|. So, the expected value of N(S)/|S| is 11. But is the ratio itself going to be 11? Or is it that as |S| becomes large, the Poisson distribution's variance increases, but the ratio would converge to the mean.

Alternatively, suppose the process is in 3D, so d≥2. The Poisson process's number density is 11 per unit volume. So, the number of points in a region is Poisson(11 * V), where V is the volume. So, N(S) is Poisson(11 V). Then N(S)/V is Poisson(11) divided by V. Wait, no, that's not correct. N(S) is Poisson(11 V), so N(S)/V is Poisson(11). So the ratio is a Poisson(11) variable divided by V. But that can't be right because V is a variable that's going to infinity, so the ratio would be Poisson(11) over a very large number, which is almost zero except for the mean. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Another approach: the expected value of N(S) is 11 |S|. So, the expected ratio is 11. But for the ratio to converge in probability, the variance of the ratio should go to zero. Let's compute the variance of N(S)/|S|. Since N(S) is Poisson(11|S|), the variance is also 11|S|. So, Var(N(S)/|S|) is Var(N(S)) / |S|² = (11 |S|) / |S|² = 11 / |S|. As |S| approaches infinity, this variance approaches zero. So, the variance of the ratio goes to zero, which implies that the ratio converges in probability to its expectation, which is 11. Therefore, the limit as r→infty of N(S)/|S| is 11.

So the correct answer should be F: 11.0.

The question concerns a spatial Poisson process with intensity 11 in R^d (d≥2). We are to find the limit of N(S)/|S| as the radius r of the ball S approaches infinity.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Poisson Process**: The Poisson process has an intensity (number per unit volume) of 11, so the expected number of points in a region of volume V is 11V.

2. **Volume of the Ball**: The volume |S| of a ball of radius r is proportional to r^d. As r→∞, |S| grows rapidly.

3. **Number of Points in S**: The number of points N(S) is Poisson distributed with parameter 11|S|. Thus, E[N(S)] = 11|S|.

4. **Expected Ratio**: The expected value of N(S)/|S| is E[N(S)]/|S| = 11|S|/|S| = 11.

5. **Variance Consideration**: The variance of N(S) is 11|S|, so Var(N(S)/|S|) = (11|S|)/|S|^2 = 11/|S|. As |S|→∞, Var(N(S)/|S|)→0.

6. **Convergence in Probability**: Since the variance goes to zero, N(S)/|S| converges in probability to its expectation, which is 11.

### Conclusion:
As r→∞, N(S)/|S| converges to 11.
