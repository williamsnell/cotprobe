Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about chemical potential. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what chemical potential is. From what I remember, the chemical potential of a substance is related to its ability to undergo a chemical change. It's like the 'cost' or 'value' of that substance in terms of its interactions with other substances.

The problem states that there's a mixture of water and ethanol with a mole fraction of water of 0.60. Oh wait, mole fraction is the ratio of the moles of one component to the total moles of all components. So if water is 0.6, ethanol must be 0.4, since 0.6 + 0.4 equals 1.

Now, the question is about chemical potential. I think the key here is that in a mixture, the chemical potentials are related. For an ideal solution, the chemical potentials are inversely proportional to their mole fractions. Wait, no, wait. I remember something about the Gibbs-Duhem equation here. Right, the Gibbs-Duhem equation connects the changes in chemical potentials of components in a solution.

The Gibbs-Duhem equation for two components (let's say A and B) is: 

x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0

Where x is the mole fraction and dμ is the change in chemical potential. Oh wait, no, wait. Another version is that the sum of mole fractions times the change in their chemical potentials is zero. So, x_A * (dμ_A) + x_B * (dμ_B) = 0.

But wait, in this problem, the mixture is of water and ethanol. So maybe we can apply this equation here. Let me write it down.

Let me denote water as component A and ethanol as component B. So x_A is 0.6, and x_B is 0.4.

The given change in chemical potential (dμ_A) is +0.25 J/mol. We need to find the change in chemical potential (dμ_B), which is ethanol's change.

According to the Gibbs-Duhem equation:

x_A * dμ_A + x_B * dμ_B = 0

So plugging the numbers in:

0.6 * 0.25 + 0.4 * dμ_B = 0

Let's compute 0.6 * 0.25. That's 0.15. So:

0.15 + 0.4 * dμ_B = 0

Subtract 0.15 from both sides:

0.4 * dμ_B = -0.15

Divide both sides by 0.4:

dμ_B = (-0.15) / 0.4 = -0.375 J/(mol)

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have -0.375. Hmm. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 0.15
B: -0.15
C: 0.60
D: 0.25
E: -0.25
F: 0.38
G: -0.20
H: -0.75
I: -0.38
J: -0.60

Hmm, none of these is -0.375. Oh wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.6 * 0.25 is 0.15. 0.4 * dμ_B = -0.15. So dμ_B is -0.15 /0.4 = -0.375. So that's correct. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the equation uses the negative of the change in chemical potential? Let me think again. The equation is x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0. So if the chemical potential of water increases, ethanol's must decrease. So the change in ethanol's is negative.

So dμ_A is +0.25, thus dμ_B is negative.

Wait, but the calculation gives me -0.375, but the closest option is F, which is 0.38. Oh wait, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake. Let me re-calculate:

0.6 * 0.25 = 0.15.

So 0.4 * dμ_B = -0.15.

So dμ_B = (-0.15)/(0.4) = -0.375.

Hmm, none of the options match. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the change in the chemical potential of ethanol, but the equation is set with some signs. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x_A dμ_A = -x_B dμ_B. Let me confirm the correct form.

Oh wait, I think I messed up the sign. The Gibbs-Duhem equation is:

x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0

So, rearranged, x_A dμ_A = -x_B dμ_B

So, dμ_B = (-x_A / x_B) * dμ_A

Plugging in: (-0.6 / 0.4) * 0.25 = (-0.6/0.4) *0.25.

0.6 /0.4 is 1.5, so negative of that is -1.5. Multiply by 0.25: -0.375.

So yes, same as before. So perhaps none of the options match, which is a problem.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. The problem says, "the chemical potential of water increases by 0.25 J/mol". So dμ_A = +0.25.

So, dμ_B is negative.

But the options only go down to -0.38. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh! Wait a second, perhaps the equation is the other way. The correct equation is:

x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0 → dμ_B = - (x_A / x_B) * dμ_A

So, x_A is 0.6, x_B is 0.4.

So, dμ_B = - (0.6 / 0.4) * 0.25

0.6/0.4 is 1.5, so -1.5 *0.25 = -0.375.

Again, same result. So why is the option not present? Let me look at the options again.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles. No, the mole fractions are correct. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in the chemical potential of ethanol in terms of the mole fraction's change. Wait, no, the problem states a change in the mixture composition, which is a change in the mole fractions as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in sign when applying the equation. Let me try again.

Gibbs-Duhem equation:

x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0

Thus,

0.6 * 0.25 + 0.4 * dμ_B = 0

0.15 + 0.4 dμ_B =0

0.4 dμ_B = -0.15 → dμ_B = -0.15 / 0.4 = -0.375.

Hmm. None of the options have -0.375. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a mixture but about a single component, but the question says a mixture of water and ethanol. So that's not the case.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the answer is -0.38 J/(mol), which is option F. But why? Did I miscalculate the value?

Wait, let me compute 0.6 * 0.25 again. 0.6 *0.25 is 0.15. Yes.

So, 0.4 * x = -0.15 → x = -0.375.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is intended to be a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I inverted the equation. Let me think: perhaps the equation is x_A dμ_A = x_B dμ_B. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the difference in chemical potentials between the two components. Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: for a solution, the chemical potential is μ = μ_A + μ_B, and for ideal solutions, the partial molar properties are additive. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in chemical potential is inversely related. So, for an ideal solution, the change in chemical potential of component A is proportional to its mole fraction change.

Wait, another formula: the change in chemical potential for component B is (x_A / x_B) times the change in chemical potential of A. But wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like the relation between the chemical potentials and the volume or something else. Hmm, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the question: it's a mixture of water and ethanol, so they are two components. The mole fraction of water is 0.6, so ethanol is 0.4. The chemical potential of water increases by 0.25 J/mol. What's the change in ethanol's chemical potential?

So, applying the Gibbs-Duhem equation again.

x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0

So,

0.6 * dμ_Water + 0.4 * dμ_Ethanol = 0

Given dμ_Water = +0.25 → 0.6 * 0.25 = 0.15.

So 0.4 * dμ_Ethanol = -0.15 → dμ_Ethanol = -0.15/0.4 = -0.375 J/(mol).

So, the chemical potential of ethanol changes by -0.375 J/(mol). None of the options match this. So perhaps the options provided have a typo, but let's look again.

Looking at the options, the closest is F: 0.38, which is about 0.375 but positive. Alternatively, perhaps when I compute 0.6 * 0.25, I should have 0.3, but 0.6 * 0.25 is 0.15, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when applying the equation. Let me think again.

Another approach: The change in chemical potential of ethanol is negative. So, the possible options are A to G. None have -0.375.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mole fractions. Wait, in a 0.6 mole fraction of water and 0.4 of ethanol, the total is 1. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula dμ_A = - (x_B / x_A) * dμ_B.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, let me think again.

The correct relation is x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0. So, dμ_B = (-x_A / x_B) * dμ_A.

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario. Another scenario: perhaps the problem is considering the change in chemical potential using the relation for ideal solutions, where μ = μ° + RT ln (γ). But that's getting more complicated and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the fact that in an ideal solution, the change in chemical potential of each component is inversely proportional to its mole fraction. So, the change in μ_A is inversely proportional to x_A.

So, if x_A increases, μ_A decreases. So, for ethanol, which has a lower mole fraction, its μ would increase more.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is -0.38. Wait, 0.38 is approximately 0.375. So perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest hundredth. So, -0.375 is approximately -0.38. So perhaps the correct answer is F.

But why the options don't have -0.375? Or maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the chemical potential of water increases by 0.25, which is a change of +0.25. So, the change in ethanol's chemical potential is (x_A / x_B) * (dμ_water), but with a negative sign? Let me think.

Wait, no, because the equation is x_A dμ_A + x_B dμ_B = 0. So, perhaps the change in μ_A is 0.25, so dμ_B = -(x_A / x_B) * dμ_A.

Which is as before, (0.6 / 0.4) = 1.5 → dμ_B = -1.5 * 0.25 = -0.375.

Wait, unless I'm supposed to use the reciprocal relation, but I don't think so.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but since the closest option is F, which is -0.38, perhaps that's the answer intended. So, the correct answer would be option F.

To solve the problem, we use the Gibbs-Duhem equation for a two-component system:

\[
x_A \, d\mu_A + x_B \, d\mu_B = 0
\]

where \(x_A\) and \(x_B\) are the mole fractions of components A (water) and B (ethanol), respectively, and \(d\mu_A\) and \(d\mu_B\) are the changes in chemical potentials of components A and B. The given mole fraction of water is \(x_A = 0.6\), and the mole fraction of ethanol is \(x_B = 0.4\). The change in chemical potential of water is \(d\mu_A = +0.25 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}\). We need to find the change in chemical potential of ethanol, \(d\mu_B\).

Rearranging the Gibbs-Duhem equation:

\[
x_A \, d\mu_A + x_B \, d\mu_B = 0
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
0.6 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot d\mu_B = 0
\]

Calculate \(0.6 \cdot 0.25\):

\[
0.6 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15
\]

Substitute back into the equation:

\[
0.15 + 0.4 \cdot d\mu_B = 0
\]

Solve for \(d\mu_B\):

\[
0.4 \cdot d\mu_B = -0.15
\]

\[
d\mu_B = \frac{-0.15}{0.4} = -0.375 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}
\]

Thus, the chemical potential of ethanol changes by \(-0.375 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}\). However, none of the provided options exactly match this value. The closest option is **F: -0.38 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}**, which is approximately \(-0.375\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: F
