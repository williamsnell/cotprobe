Okay, so I have this question about how light enters the eye. Let me think through this step by step. The question is asking where light enters the eye, and the options are various parts of the eye structures. 

First, I remember that the eye has several components. The cornea is the clear top covering the eyes, right? Then there's the lens, which is a transparent structure that focuses light into the eye. The retina is the light-sensitive part at the back of the eye, where light enters and is processed. The vitreous humor is the clear fluid inside the eye that holds things like the lens, cornea, and retina together.

Wait, the question is about where light enters. Light enters through the cornea. Because the cornea has a tiny slit called the corneal aperture, which allows light into the eye. The lens then focuses that light onto the retina. So, the initial entry point is the cornea. 

Looking at the options, option B is cornea. So the answer should be B. The other options don't fit as well. For example, the lens (option I) is where light is focused, not where it enters. The cornea is the entry point. The vitreous humor (option F) is part of the eye but isn't the entry point. The corneal aperture (like the tiny hole) is a part of the cornea. The retina (A) is where light is processed, not where it comes in. The pupil (G) is a part of the retina, so that's the exit point, not the entry. The optic nerve (E) is outside the eye, so that's not relevant here. The blind spot (D) is a part of the retina, so that's the exit. So the correct answer is B.
